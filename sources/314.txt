THE FIRE WALK.
By Andrew Lang.
The subject of this paper has, perhaps, nothing to do with
psychical research. The phenomena described are purely physical,
nor is there, apparently, much reason to suppose that they have
any cause in the human mind. But, in history, they have often
been associated with anecdotes of miracles, and with persons who
had credit as miracle-workers. These have handled or walked
through fire without any lesion or cautery. Of course, it is conceiv
able, barely, that in certain abnormal states of mind, men might be
insensible to the action of fire. But no such state of mind would
prevent fire from doing its normal work on the body. Moreover,
I shall show that fire failed to cauterise the naked feet of a normal
British official, whose mental condition was much as usual.
The subject occurs everywhere in history, legend, folk-lore, law and
early religion, and yet nobody has thought it worth while to collect
the ancient reports and to compare them with well-authenticated
modern examples. In Mr. Tylor's celebrated work, Primitive Culture,
only one or two casual allusions are made to the theme. " They built
the high places of Baal, in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause
their sons and daughters to pass through to Moloch," that is, to pass
through the fire, " whether in ritual or symbolical sacrifice " (Primitive
Culture, Vol. II., p. 281). As a supposed rite of purification the
ceremony is again touched upon lightly (Vol. II., p. 429). Again,
" The ancient ceremony of passing through a fire, or leaping over
burning brands, has been kept up vigorously in the British Isles"
(Vol. I., p. 85), namely, at the midsummer ceremonies, when it is,
or was, the custom to jump over, or run through, light fires. Nobody
would guess that a rite of passing deliberately, and unscathed, through
ovens or furnaces yet exists in Japan, Bulgaria, the Society Islands,
Fiji, Southern India, Trinidad, the Straits Settlements, the Isle of
Mauritius, and, no doubt, in other regions. We must distinguish
between such sportive playing with fire as prevailed recently in these
isles and the more serious Fire Ceremony of Central Australia, which
tests endurance, on the one hand, and the apparent contravention of
a natural law, on the other. Again, we must discount the popular
reply that the hand can be rapidly plunged into molten metal and

withdrawn without injury, for we do not happen to be concerned
with such a brief exposure to heat. Once more, the theory of the
application of some unknown chemical substance must be rejected,
because, as we shall prove, there are certainly cases in which nothing
of the kind is done. Moreover, science is acquainted with no sub
stance—alum or diluted sulphuric acid, or the like—which will
produce the result of preventing cauterisation. Sir William Crookes,
at least, is not familiar with any such resources of science. His
evidence as to tire-handling by D. D. Home is familiar, and I
understand that Mr. Podmore can only explain it away by a
hypothesis of a trick played in a bad light, by means of an asbestos
glove or some such transparent dodge (Studies in Psychical Research,
pp. 58-59). Perhaps he adds a little " hallucination " on the part
of the spectators. But asbestos and hallucination are out of the
question in the cases which I am about to quote. Home was,
or feigned to be, in a state of trance when he performed with fire.
The seeress of Lourdes, Bernadette, was also in religious contem
plation when she permitted the flame of a candle to play through her
clasped fingers (which were unscathed) for a timed quarter of an
hour. 1 Some Indian devotees, again, aver that they " meditate " on
some divine being while passing over the glowing embers, and the
Nistinares of Bulgaria, who dance in the fire, are described as being
in a more or less abnormal mental condition. But even this condition
is absent in the well-attested Raiatean and Fijian examples, in which,
also, no kind of chemical preparation is employed. Finally, where
savages are concerned, the hardness of the skins of their feet is dwelt
upon. But, first, the sole of a boot would be scorched in the circum
stances, while their feet are not affected ; next, the savages' feet
were not leathery (so Dr. Hocken avers) ; thirdly, one of the
Europeans who walked through the fire at Rarotonga declares that
the soles of his own feet are peculiarly tender. Thus every known
physical or conjectured psychical condition of immunity fails to meet
the case, and we are left wholly without an ascertained, or a good
conjectural, " reason why " for the phenomena.
I shall begin with the most recent and the most authenticated
cases, and work back in time, and in civilisation. Mr. Tregear, the
well-known lexicographer of the Maori and the allied Mangarova
languages, lately sent me the twenty-ninth number of The Journal of
the Polynesian Society, March, 1899, Wellington, N.Z. Professors
Max Miiller and Sayce are Honorary Members of the Society, which
studies Polynesian languages, customs and conditions. Mr. Tregear
attests the upright, truth-telling character of the British official, who

TE UMU-TI,
OB FIRE-WALKING CEREMONY.
By Colonel Gudgeon,
British Resident, Rarotonc.a.
In this Journal, Vol. II., p. 105, Miss Teuira Henry describes this
ceremony as practised in Raiatea, of the Society Group. We have lately
received from Colonel Gudgeon the following account of his experiences in
walking bare-footed across the glowing hot stones of a native oven, made in
Rarotonga by a man from Raiatea. Since the date of the paper quoted, it
has come to light that the Maoris of New Zealand were equally acquainted
with this ceremony, which was performed by their ancestors. On reading
Colonel Gudgeon's account to some old chiefs of the Urewera tribe, they
expressed no surprise and said that their ancestors could also perform the
ceremony, though it has long gone out of practice. —Editors.
I must tell you that I have seen and gone through the fire ceremony of
the Umn-Ti.
The oven was lit at about dawn on the 20th of January, and I noticed
that the stones were very large, as also were the logs that had been used in
the oven for heating purposes.
About 2 p.m. we went to the oven and there found the tohtinga (a
Raiatea man) getting matters ready, and I told him that, as my feet were
naturally tender, the stones should be levelled down a bit. He assented to
this, and evidently he had intended to do so, for shortly after, the men with
very long poles that had hooks, began to level the stones flat in the oven,
which was some twelve feet in diameter. He then went with his disciple
and pointed to two stones that were not hot, and instructed him the reason
was that they had been taken from a marae, or sacred place.
He then unwound two bundles, which proved to be branches of a large-
leaved Ti (or Dracccna) plucked, it is said, from two of these trees standing
close together, and it is said that the initiated can on such occasions see the
shadow of a woman with long hair, called te varua lino (evil spirit), standing
between the trees. The right hand branch is the first plucked, and it is
said that the branches bend down to be plucked.
So much for the Shamanism, and now for the facts.
The tohunga (priest) and his tauira (pupil) walked each to the oven, and
then halting, the prophet spoke a few words, and then each struck the edge
of the oven with the ti branches. This was three times repeated, and then
they walked slowly and deliberately over the two fathoms of hot stones.
When this was done, the tohunga came to us, and his disciple handed his ti
branch to Mr. Goodwin, at whose place the ceremony came off, and they
went through the ceremony. Then the tohunga said to Mr. Goodwin, '" I
hand my mana (power) over to you ; lead your friends across." Now, there
were four Europeans—Dr. W. Craig, Dr. George Craig, Mr. Goodwin, and
xxxvi.] The Fire Walk. 5
myself—and I can only say that we stepped out boldly. I got across
unscathed, and only one of the party was badly burned ; and he, it is said,
was spoken to, but, like Lot's wife, looked behind him—a thing against
all rules.
I can hardly give you my sensations, but I can say this :—that I knew
quite well I was walking on red hot stones and could feel the heat, yet I was
not burned. I felt something resembling slight electric shocks, both at the
time and afterwards, but that is all. I do not know that I should recom
mend every one to try it. A man must have mana to do it ; if he has not,
it will be too late when he is on the hot stone of Tama-ahi-roa.
I cannot say that I should have performed this wizard trick had I not
been one of the fathers of the Polynesian Society, and bound to support the
superiority of the New Zealander all over Polynesia,—indeed all over the
world. I would not have missed the performance for anything.
To show you the heat of the stones, quite half-an-hour afterwards some
one remarked to the priest that the stones would not be hot enough to cook
the ti. His only answer was to throw his green branch on the oven, and in
a quarter of a minute it was blazing. As I have eaten a fair share of the ti
cooked in the oven, I am in a position to say that it was hot enough to cook
it well.
I walked with bare feet, and after we had done so, about 200 Maoris
followed. No one, so far as I saw, went through with boots on. I did
not walk quickly across the oven, but with deliberation, because I feared
that I should tread on a sharp point of the stones and fall. My feet also
were very tender. I did not mention the fact, but my impression as I
crossed the oven was that the skin would all peel off my feet. Yet all I
really felt when the task was accomplished was a tingling sensation not
unlike slight electric shocks on the soles of my feet, and this continued for
seven hours or more. The really funny thing is that, though the stones
were hot enough an hour afterwards to burn up green branches of the ti,
the very tender skin of my feet was not even hardened by the fire.
Many of the Maoris thought they were burned, but they were not, at
any rate not severely.
Do not suppose that the man who directed this business was an old
tohniiga. He is a young man, but of the Raiatea family, who are hereditary
fire-walkers.
I can only tell you it is mana—mana tangata and mana atiia.
On this report a few remarks may be offered. (1) No preparation
of any chemical, herbal, or other sort was applied to the Europeans, at
least. (2) " The handing over the mana" (or power) was practised by
Home, sometimes successfully (it is alleged) as when Mr. S. C. Hall's
scalp and white locks were unharmed by a red-hot coal : sometimes
unsuccessfully. A clergyman of my acquaintance still bears the
blister caused when he accepted a red-hot coal from the hand of Home,
as he informs me by letter. (3) The " walk " was shorter than seems
common : only twelve feet, four paces. (4) A friend of Colonel
Gudgeon's was badly burned, and the reason assigned was a good
6 Andrew Lang. [part
folk-lore reason, since the days of Lot's wife, of Theocritus, and of
Virgil : he looked behind. (5) The feeling as if of " slight electric
shocks " is worthy of notice. (6) Colonel Gudgeon clearly believes
that a man without mana had better not try, and by mana, here, he
probably means " nerve." As we can hardly suppose, in spite of
Home, that mana, in a supernormal sense, can be " handed over " by
one man to another, Colonel Gudgeon's experience seems equally to
baffle every theory of " how it is done." Perhaps we can all do it.
Members of the Society may make their own experiments. Perhaps
Colonel Gudgeon faced fire in a manner so unusual as a result of Dr.
Hocken's description of the Fijian rite at Mbenga, an isle 20 miles
south of Suva. This account was published in the Transactions of the
New Zealand Institute, Vol. XXXI., 1898, having been read before
the Otago Institute on May 10th, 1898, and is here reprinted in full
as follows :—
AN ACCOUNT OF THE FIJI FIRE CEREMONY.
Bv Dr. T. M. Hocken, F.L.S.
Amongst the many incidents witnessed during a recent visit to the
tropical islands of Fiji, probably none exceeded in wonder and interest that
of which I propose to give some account this evening, and to which may be
applied the designation of "fire ceremony." It is called by the natives
" vilavilaireco." In this remarkable ceremony a number of almost nude
Fijians walk quickly and unharmed across and among white-hot stones,
which form the pavement of a huge native oven—termed " lovo "—in which
shortly afterwards are cooked the succulent sugary roots and pith of the
Cordyline terminalis, one of the cabbage trees, known to the Maoris as the
"t»," and to the Fijians as the "masawe." This wonderful power of fire-
walking is now not only very rarely exercised, but, at least as regards Fiji,
is confined to a small clan or family—the Na Ivilankata—resident on Bega
( = Mbenga), an island of the group, lying somewhat south of Suva, aud
twenty miles from that capital.
A small remnant of the priestly order at Raiatea, one of the Society
Islands, is yet able to utter the preparatory incantation, and afterwards to
walk through the fire.
It exists also in other parts of the world, as in parts of India, the Straits
Settlements, West India Islands, and elsewhere. Very interesting accounts
of the ceremony as seen at Raiatea and at Mbenga are to bo found in the
second and third volumes of the Journal of the Polynesian Society, and in
Basil Thomson's charming South Sea Yarns. These descriIjtions filled our
small party of three—my wife. Dr. Colquhoun, and myself—with the desire
to witness it for ourselves, and, if possible, to give some explanation of
what was apparently an inexplicable mystery. Our desires were perfectly
realised.
The Hon. Mr. A. M. Duncan, a member of the Legislative Council of
Fiji, and agent at Suva of the Union Steamship Company, to whom I
carried a letter of introduction from Mr. James Mills, the managing
director of that company, was most courteous and obliging, and promised
xxxvl] The Fire Walk. 7
his best efforts in the matter. His energy and ready response succeeded,
with the result that a large party from Suva enjoyed such a day as each one
must have marked with a red letter.
It was necessary to give the natives three days in which to make their
preparations—constructing the oven and paving it with stones, which then
required heating for thirty-six or forty-eight hours at least with fierce fires
fed with logs and branches. They had also to gather their stores of food to
form the foundation of the huge feast whose preparation was to succeed the
mystic ceremony. During these three days we lost no opportunity of
collecting from former witnesses of the ceremony whatever information or
explanation they could afford, but with no very satisfactory result : the facts
were undisputed, but the explanations quite insufficient. Some thought that
the chief actors rubbed their bodies with a secret preparation which rendered
them fireproof ; others that life-long friction on the hard hot rocks, coral-
reefs, and sands had so thickened and indurated the foot-sole that it could
defy fire ; but all agreed as to the bonajides of the exhibition. The incident
recounted in the Polynesian Journal was also confirmed—where Lady
Thurston threw her handkerchief upon the shoulder of one of the actors,
and, though it remained there but a few seconds before being picked off by
means of a long stick, it was greatly scorched.1
The story or legend attached to this weird gift of fire-walking was told
us, with some variation, by two or three different people, and it is mainly as
follows : A far-distant ancestor of the present inheritors of this power was
walking one day when he espied an eel, which he caught, and was about to
kill. The eel squeaked out, and said, "Oh ! Tui Na Galita ( = Eng-Galita),
do not kill me ; spare me. I am a god, and I will make you so strong in
war that none shall withstand you." " Oh, but," replied Na Galita, " I am
already stronger in war than any one else, and I fear no one." "Well,
then," said the eel, "I will make your canoe the fastest to sail on these
seas, and none shall come up with it." " But," replied Na Galita, "as it is,
none can pass my canoe." "Well, then," rejoined the eel, "I will make
you a great favourite among women, so that all will fall in love with you."
"Not so," said Na Galita, "I have one wife, of whom I am very fond, and
I desire no other." The poor eel then made other offers, which were also
rejected, and his chances of life were fading fast when he made a final
effort. "Oh, Na Galita, if you will spare me, I will so cause it that you
and your descendants shall henceforth walk through the masawe oven
unharmed." "Good," said Na Galita, "now I will let you go." This
story varies somewhat from that told in the Polynesian Journal.2
The eventful morning was blazingly hot and brilliant, and the vivid-blue
sky was without a cloud as we steamed down towards Mbenga in the
s.8. " Hauroto." Mr. Vaughan, an eminent inhabitant of Suva, who has
charge of the Meteorological Department there, was of our party, and
carried the thermometer. This was the most suitable for our purpose
procurable ; it was in a strong japanned-tin casing, and registered 400°
Fahr. We had also three amateur photographers.

Owing to the numerous coral-reefs and shallows, we finally transhipped
into the " Maori," a steamer of much less draught. Approaching the silent
verdure-clad islet, with its narrow beach of white coral sand, we saw a thin
blue haze of smoke curling above the lofty cocoanut trees at a little distance
in the interior, which sufficiently localised the mysterious spot. We now
took the ship's boat, and soon, stepping ashore, made our way through a
narrow pathway in the dense bush until we came to an open space cleared
from the forest, in the midst of which was the great lovo, or oven.
A remarkable and never-to-be-forgotten scene now presented itself.
There were hundreds of Fijians, dressed according to the rules of
nature and their own art—that is, they were b'ghtly garlanded here and
there with their fantastic lihdikus of grass, ornamented with brilliant
scarlet and yellow hibiscus flowers and streamers of the delicate ribbonwood.
These hung in airy profusion from their necks and around their waists,
showing off to advantage their lovely brown glossy skins. In addition,
many wore clean white cotton snZks, or pendant loin-cloths. All were
excited, moving hither and thither in wild confusion, and making the forest
ring again with their noisy hilarity. Some climbed the lofty cocoa-palms,
hand over hand, foot over foot, with all the dexterity of monkeys. The
top reached, and shrouded amongst the feathery leaves, they poured down a
shower of nuts for the refreshment of their guests.
The celerity with which they opened the nuts was something astonishing,
and afforded an example, too, as to the mode of using stone implements. A
stout, strong stick, 3 ft. long, and sharpened at both ends, was driven into
the ground, and a few smart strokes upon it soon tore from the nut its outer
thick covering. The upper part of the shell was then broken off by means
of a long sharp-edged stone as cleanly and regularly as the lid of an egg is
removed with a knife, and then was disclosed a pint of delicious milk, a
most welcome beverage on that overpoweringly hot day.
The great oven lay before us, pouring forth its torrents of heat from
huge embers which were still burning fiercely on the underlying stones.
These were indeed melting moments for the spectators. The pitiless noon
tide sun, and the no less pitiless oven-heat, both pent up in the deep
well-like forest clearing, reduced us to a state of solution from which there
was no escape. Despite this the photographers took up their stations, and
others of us proceeded to make our observations. The lovo, or oven, was
circular, with a diameter of 25 ft. or 30 ft. ; its greatest depth was perhaps
8 ft., its general shape that of a saucer, with sloping sides and a flattish
bottom, the latter being filled with the white-hot stones. Near the margin
of the oven, and on its windward side, the thermometer marked 114°.
Suddenly, and as if Pandemonium had been let loose, the air was filled
with savage yells ; a throng of natives surrounded the oven, and in a most
ingenious and effective way proceeded to drag out the smouldering unburnt
logs and cast them some distance away. Large loops of incombustible
lianas attached to long poles were dexterously thrown over the burning
trunks, much after the manner of the head-hunters of New Guinea when
securing their human prey. A twist or two round of the loop securely
entangled the logs, which were then dragged out by the united efforts of
scores of natives, who all the while were shouting out some wild rhythmical
xxxvi.] The Fire Walk 9
song. This accomplished, the stones at the bottom of the oven were
disclosed, with here and there flame flickering and forking up through the
interstices. The diameter of the area occupied by those stones was about
10ft., but this was speedily increased to a spread of loft, or more by a
second ingenious method. The natives thrust their long poles, which were
of the unconsumable wi-tree (Spondias dulcis), between the stones at
intervals of perhaps 1ft. A long rope-like liana—tea—previously placed
underneath the poles, and 1 ft. or 2 ft. from their extremities, was now
dragged by scores of lusty savages, with the effect of spreading and levelling
the stones. This done, our thermometer was suspended by a simple device
over the centre of the stones, and about 5 ft. or 6 ft. above them ; but it
had to be withdrawn almost immediately, as the solder began to melt and
drop, and the instrument to be destroyed. It, however, registered 282°
Fahr., and it is certain that had not this accident occurred, the range of
400° would have been exceeded, and the thermometer burst.
During all these wild scenes we had seen nothing of the main actors—of
the descendants of Na Galita. Doubtless to give more impressive effect,
they had been hiding in the forest depths until the signal should be given
and their own supreme moment arrive. And now they came on, seven or
eight in number, amidst the vociferous yells of those around. The margin
reached, they steadily descended the oven slope in single file, and walked,
as I think, leisurely, but, as others of our party think, quickly, across and
around the stones, leaving the oven at the point of entrance. The leader,
who was longest in the oven, was a second or two under half a minute
therein. Almost immediately heaps of the soft and succulent leaves of the
hibiscus, which had been gathered for the purpose, were thrown into the
oven, which was thus immediately filled with clouds of hissing steam. Upon
the leaves and within the steam the natives, who had returned, sat or stood
pressing them down in preparation for cooking the various viands which
were to afford them a sumptuous feast that evening or on the morrow.
But for us the most interesting part of the drama was over, and it only
remained to review observations and draw conclusions. Just before the
great event of the day, I gained permission to examine one or two of the
fire-walkers prior to their descent into the oven. This was granted without
the least hesitation by the principal native Magistrate of the Rewa district,
N'Dabea by name, but generally known as Jonathan. This native is of
great intelligence and influence, is a member of the Na Galita Clan, and has
himself at various times walked through the fire. On this occasion he took
no other part in the ceremony than that of watching or superintending it.
The two men thus sent forward for examination disclosed no peculiar feature
whatever. As to dress, they were slightly garlanded round the neck and
the waist ; the pulse was unaffected, and the skin, legs, and feet were
free from any apparent application. I assured myself of this by touch,
smell, and taste, not hesitating to apply my tongue as a corroborative. The
foot-soles were comparatively soft and flexible—by no means leathery and
insensible. Thus the two Suvan theories were disposed of. This careful
examination was repeated immediately after egress from the oven, and with
the same result. To use the language of Scripture, " No smell of fire had
passed upon them." No incantations or other religious ceremonial were
10 Andrew Lang. [part
observed. Though these were formerly practised, they have gradually fallen
into disuse since the introduction of Christianity. I did not succeed in
procuring the old incantation formula ; doubtless it was similar to that of the
old Raiatean ceremony, which is given in the second volume of the Polynesian
Society's Journal, p. 106.
Whilst walking through the fire, Dr.Colquhoun thought the countenances
of the fire-walkers betrayed some anxiety. I saw none of this ; nor was it
apparent to me at either examination. The stones, which were basaltic,
must have been white-hot, but due to the brilliance of the day this was not
visible.
Various natives, being interrogated for an explanation, replied, with a
shrug, " They can do this wouderful thing ; we cannot. You have seen it ;
we have seen it." Whilst thus unable to suggest any explanation or theory,
I am absolutely certain as to the truth of the facts and the bona fides of the
actors. A feature is that, wherever this power is found, it is possessed by
but a limited few. I was assured, too, that any person holding the hand
of one of the fire-walkers could himself pass through the oven unharmed.
This the natives positively assert.
My friend Mr. Walter Carew, for thirty years a Resident Commissioner
and Stipendiary Magistrate in Fiji, has frequently conversed with Jonathan
(referred to above), who, whilst withholding no explanation, can give
none. He says, "I can do it, but I do not know how it is done"; and,
further, that at the time he does not experience any heat or other
sensation.
Does any psychical condition explain these facts, as suggested in Lang's
Modern Mythology ? I certainly did not observe any appearance of trance
or other mental condition. In connection with this Mr. Carew thinks that
intense faith is the explanation, and that if this were upset, the descendants
of Na Galita would be no longer charmed. But it is difficult to see how any
mental state can prevent the action of physical law. Hypnotism and
amesthetics may produce insensibility to pain, but do not interfere with
the cautery.
Many of the so-called fire miracles are remarkable indeed, but are
readily explained, and by no means come within the present category.
Such, for instance, as plunging the hand, which is protected by the
interposed film of perspiration assuming the globular state of water,
into boiling lead. Similarly, many conjuring feats. At the beginning
of this century an Italian—Lionetti—performed remarkable experiments
—rubbed a bar of red-hot iron over his arms, legs, and hair, and held
it between his teeth ; he also drank boiling oil. Dr. Sementini, of
Naples, carefully examined these experiments, and experimented himself
until he surpassed the fire-proof qualities of his suggestor. He found
that frequent friction with sulphurous acid rendered him insensible to
red-hot iron ; a solution of alum did the same. A layer of powdered
sugar covered with soap made his tongue insensible to heat. In these
and similar instances, however, an explanation, though probably not a
very sufficient one, has been given, but in that forming the subject of
this paper no solution has been offered. Lang's chapter on the "Fire
Walk " should be consulted ; his account of the Bulgarian Nistinares is
xxxvi.] The Fire Walk. 11
as wonderful and inexplicable as anything here recited. The whole subject
requires thorough scientific examination.
My next case occurs among a civilised race, the Japanese, and is
vouched for by Mr. Lafcadio Hearn, an American writer, whose book
I have not at hand, and by Colonel Andrew Haggard (The Field,
May 20th, 1899, p. 724). Colonel Haggard saw the fire-walk done in
Tokio, on April 9th, 1899. The fire was six yards long by six feet
wide. The rite was in honour of a mountain god. Ablutions in cold
water were made by the performers, and Colonel Haggard was told by
one young lady that she had not only done the fire-walk, but had been
" able to sit for a long time, in winter, immersed in ice-cold water,
without feeling the cold in the least." After some waving of wands
and sprinkling of salt, people of all ages walked through, not glowing
stones in this case, but " red-hot charcoal." " I examined their feet
afterwards,- they were quite soft, and not a trace of fire upon them."
Colonel Haggard says that the rite is "a very unusual thing" in
Japan ; many of the Japanese living in Tokio had never heard of it
before. Colonel Haggard was unable to get any clear answer as to
why the rite is performed. The priest talked something about a good
God who had power over the bad element of fire. It is not clear how,
the rite being so unusual, two Japanese ladies told Colonel Haggard
that they had " frequently gone through the fiery ordeal."
If any one is anxious to know the particulars of the rite as
practised in the isle Mauritius, he may communicate with our police
officials there, who annually superintend the performance. Coolies
from southern India do just what is done by Japanese and Fijians.
Our administration, however, does not permit women to pass through
the fire.
After giving these recent examples in Mauritius, Japan, Rarotonga,
and an isle of the Fijian group, I am obliged to fall back on the
evidence already set forth in Chapter XII. of my book, Modern
Mythology (1897). The Bulgarian practice I take from the Recueil de
Folk-lore, de Litte'rature et de Science, edited by the Bulgarian Minister
of Public Instruction, with the aid of Drs. Schischmanof (whom I
know personally) and Mastov. In a private letter, Dr. Schischmanof
hints at extase religieuse, as in the self-mutilations of Dervishes and
Fakirs. Their performances are extraordinary enough, but there was
no religious ecstacy in the little Japanese boy of six, whom Colonel
Haggard saw pass through the fire, none in Colonel Gudgeon, none in
the Fijians observed by Dr. Hocken. The fire-walkers in Bulgaria
are called Nistinares, and the faculty is regarded as hereditary. We
find the same opinion in Fiji, in ancient Italy, and in the Spain of the
last century. In Spain the fire-walkers were employed to help to put
12 Andrew Lang. [part
out fires. The story is given in the essay on the last Earl Marischal,
in my Companions of Pickle (p. 24), and is derived from d'Alembert's
account of the Earl : " There is a family or caste in Spain, who, from
father to son, have the power of going into the flames without being
burned, and who, by dint of charms permitted by the Inquisition, can
extinguish fires." The Duchess of Medina Sidonia thought this a
proof of the verity of the Catholic faith, and, wishing to convert the
Earl, asked him to view the performance. But he insisted on lighting
the fire himself, and to that the Spaniards would not consent, the Earl
being a heretic.
To return to the Bulgarian Nistinares, they dance in the fire on
May 21st, the feast of Ss. Helena and Constantine. Great fires of
scores of cart-loads of dry wood are made. On the embers of these
the Nistinares (who turn blue in the face) dance and utter prophecies,
afterwards placing their feet in the muddy ground where libations of
water have been poured forth. The report says nothing as to the
state of their feet. The Nistinare begins to feel the effect of the fire
after his face has resumed its wonted colour and expression.
As for India, I may cite Mr. Stokes, in The Indian Antiquary,
(II., 190), Dr. Oppert, in his Original Inhabitants of India, (p. 480),
and Mr. Crookes, in Introduction to Popular Religion and Folk-lore in
Northern India, (p. 10). Mr. Stokes uses evidence from an inquest on
a boy that fell into the fire and died of his injuries, at Periyangridi.
The fire-pit was 27 ft. long by 7i ft. broad, and a span in depth.
Thirteen persons walked through. Mr. Stokes did not witness the
performance (which is forbidden by our law), but explains that the
fire " would hardly injure the tough skin of the sole of a labourer's
feet." Yet it killed a boy !
The incredulous say that the fire-walkers smear their feet with oil
from the fat of the green frog. Dr. Oppert admitting that " the heat
is unbearable in the neighbourhood of the ditch," says that the
walkers "as a rule do not do themselves much harm." This is vague.
Equally vague is the reference to rumours about "a certain preservative
ointment."
In Trinidad, British West Indies, Mr. Henry R. St. Clair, writing to
me, describes (September 14th, 1896) the feat as performed by Indian
coolie immigrants. He personally witnessed the rite, which was like
that described to me by Mr. Stephen Ponder. In both cases, the per
formers were Klings. The case witnessed by Mr. Ponder took place in
the Straits Settlements, Province Wellesley. The trench was about
20 yards long by 6 ft. wide and 2 ft. deep. A pyre of wood, 4 or 5 ft.
high, was lighted at noon ; by 4 p.m. it was a bed of red-hot embers.
The men, who with long rakes smoothed the ashes, could not stand the
heat " for more than a minute at a time." A little way from the end
xxxvi.] The Fire Walk. 13
of the trench was a hole full of water. Six coolies walked the whole
length, and thence into the water. " Not one of them showed the
least sign of injury." They had been prepared by a "devil-doctor,"
not a Brahmin. On a later occasion Mr. Ponder heard that one of
them fell "and was terribly burnt."
In these cases, Trinidad (and Mauritius) and the Straits Settle
ments, the performers are South Indian coolies. In all cases there
were multitudes of European spectators, except in Mauritius, where,
I learn, Europeans usually take no interest in the doings of the
heathen.
Turning to Tonga, we have the account of Miss Teuira Henry
(Polynesian Journal, Vol. II., No. 2, pp. 105-108). The sister and
sister's child of Miss Henry have walked over the red-hot stones,
as in the Rarotonga and Fijian cases. The ovens are 30 ft. in
diameter. The performance was photographed by Lieutenant Morn£,
of the French Navy, and the original photograph was sent to the
Editor of the Polynesian Journal, with a copy from it by Mr.
Barnfield, of Honolulu. The ceremony, preparatory to cooking the
ti plant, is religious, and the archaic hymn sung is full of obsolete
words. Mr. Hastwell, of San Francisco, published a tract, which I
have not seen, on the Raiatean rite, witnessed by himself. The stones
were " heated to a red and white heat." The natives " walked
leisurely across " five times ; " there was not even the smell of fire on
their garments " (cited in the Polynesian Journal, Vol. II., No. 3).
There is corroborative evidence from Mr. N. J. Tone, from Province
Wellesley, Straits Settlements, in the Polynesian Journal, II., 3, 193.
He did not see the rite, arriving too late, but he saw the fire-pit, and
examined the naked feet of the walkers. They were uninjured. Mr.
Tone's evidence is an extract from his diary.
As to Fiji there are various accounts. The best is that of Mr.
Basil Thomson, son of the late Archbishop of York. Mr. Thomson
was an official in Fiji, and is a well-known anthropologist. HIs
sketch, in his South Sea Yarns (p. 195, et seq.), is too long for
quotation. The rite is done yearly, before cooking the masdwe (a
draccena) in the oven through which the clan Na Ivilankata walk.
" The pit was filled with a white-hot mass, shooting out little tongues
of white flame." " The bottom of the pit was covered with an even
layer of hot stones . . . the tongues of flame played continually
among them." The walkers planted "their feet squarely and firmly on
each stone." Mr. Thomson closely examined the feet of four or five
of the natives when they emerged. " They were cool and showed no
trace of scorching, nor were their anklets of dried tree-fern burnt,"
though "dried tree-fern is as combustible as tinder." "The instep is
covered with skin no thicker than our own, and we saw the men plant
14 Andrew Lang. [part
their insteps fairly on the stone." A large stone was hooked out of
the pit before the men entered, and one of the party dropped a pocket-
handkerchief upon the stone " when the first man leapt into the oven
and snatched what remained of it up as the last left the stones."
Every fold that touched the stone was charred. Mr. Thomson kindly
showed me the handkerchief. He also showed me a rather blurred
photograph of the strange scene. It has been rudely reproduced in
the Folk Lore Journal, September, 1895.
Such is part of the modern evidence ; for the ancient, see jEneid,
XL, 784, et seq. ; Servius on the passage ; Pliny, Hist. Nat., VII., 2 ;
Silius Italicus, V., 175. This evidence refers to the Hirpi, of Mount
Soracte, a class exempted from military service by the Roman
Government, because, as Virgil makes Aruns say, " strong in faith we
walk through the midst of the fire, and press our footsteps in the
glowing mass." The Hirpi, or Wolves, were probably a Totem group,
like the Wolf Totem of Tonkaway Red Indians ; they had, like the
Tonkaway, a rite in which they were told to " behave like wolves."
(Serv., ^Eneid, VII., 800). The goddess propitiated in their fire-walk
was Feronia, a fire-goddess (Max Miiller), or a lightning goddess
(Kuhn), or a corn goddess (Mannhardt). Each of these scholars bases
his opinion on etymology. You see that scholars differ !
I have merely given evidence for the antiquity, wide diffusion,
and actual practice of this extraordinary rite. Neither physical
nor anthropological science has even glanced at it (except in Dr.
Hocken's case), perhaps because the facts are obviously impossible.
I ought to make an exception for Sir William Crookes, but he,
doubtless, was hallucinated, or gulled by the use of asbestos, or both.
Perhaps Mr. Podmore can apply these explanations to the spectators
whom I have cited. For my part, I remain without a theory, like all
the European observers whom I have quoted. But, in my humble
opinion, all the usual theories, whether of collective hallucination
(photographic cameras being hallucinated), of psychical causes, of
chemical application, of leathery skin on the soles of the feet, and so
on, are inadequate. There remains " suggestion." Any hypnotist,
with his patient's permission (in writing and witnessed^ may try the
experiment.
Since this paper was written I have seen an article, "Les Dompteurs
du Feu," on the same topic, by Dr. Th. Pascal (Armales des Sciences
Psychiques, July —August, 1899). The first part of the essay is an
extract from the Revue The'osophiqiw Frangaise. No date is given,
but the rite described was viewed at Benares, on October 26th, 1898.
I am unable to understand whether Dr. Pascal is himself the spectator,
xxxvi.] The Fire Walk. 15
and narrator, of the Revue The'osophique, or whether he quotes (he
uses marks of quotation) some other writer. The phenomena were
of the usual kind, and the writer, examining the feet of two of the
performers, found the skin of the soles fine and intact. In four cases,
in which the performers had entered the fire after the procession—with
the Master of the Ceremonies and two excited persons, who split cocoa-
nuts with swords—had gone, there were slight cauterisations, healed
two days later. The author of this passage speaks of a Brahmin
(apparently " The Master of the Ceremonies ") who observed to Mr.
Govinda Das, " that the control of the fire was not so complete as
usual, because the images of the sanctuary had been touched by
Mahomedans and others in the crowd."
The second case, not given with marks of quotation, occurred in the
park of Maharajah Tagore, on December 7th, 1898. "A Frenchman,
the son of Dr. Javal of Paris, was present." The narrator, "nous," was
also present and went up, after the rite, to venture his hand in the
furnace. He was warned that the Brahmin had left, ten minutes
before, and that "the fire had recovered its activity." The Maharajah,
however, caused the ceremony to be repeated, and some minutes after,
all was ready. The narrator then traversed the fire, barefoot, at un
petit trot, "a little less than two paces a second." As 100 yards can
be run in ten seconds, this trot was remarkably slow. He felt in paces
one and two a sensation of burning, in the five following paces a sensa
tion of intense heat. There were three small brown marks on his feet,
which formed blisters, but did not interfere with walking, and healed
"in some days." He now learned that the Brahmin's premier aide did
the ceremony not quite successfully. He is convinced that, but for
the ceremony, he would have been seriously injured.
The third case was at Benares, in February, 1899. Three Hindoos
collided and fell in : neither they nor their clothes were burned.
The author clearly regards the performers of the ceremony as
able " to tame considerably the destructive energy of the fire."
This, of course, is the theory of the savage devotees. The ceremony
was only a procession of sacred images carried in a glazed sanctuary,
and words, not known to the spectator, were uttered by the Brahmin.
Holy water was sprinkled, and a cocoa-nut was thrown into the oven.
As has been said, incantations are pronounced in Fiji and elsewhere.
To the anthropologist the close resemblance of the rites in Polynesia
and India is an interesting circumstance.1
The subject seems to me to deserve further examination by medical
experts.
1 In the World Wide Magazine (December, 1899), a Japanese lady describes the
performance witnessed by Colonel Haggard, already cited.

DISCUSSION OF THE TRANCE PHENOMENA OF
MRS. PIPER.
II.—Bv Mrs. Henry Sidgwick.
It is scarcely necessary to remind readers of the Proceedings of
what the evidence concerning Mrs. Piper's supernormal powers con
sists ; but as in this paper I propose to add to the discussion of it
without adding to the evidence itself, it may be as well briefly to
describe what my data are. The first paper about Mrs. Piper appeared
in 1890, in Proceedings, Vol. VI. It is entitled, "A Record of Certain
Phenomena of Trance " and consists of an introduction by Mr. Myers,
an account of sittings with Mrs. Piper in England by Professor Oliver
Lodge, an account of other sittings with her in England by Dr. Walter
Leaf and a brief account of his own experiences with Mrs. Piper by
Professor William James ; the whole extending to 223 pages. The
next contribution to the subject was "A Record of Certain Phenomena
of Trance," by Dr. Richard Hodgson, which appeared in Proceedings,
Vol. VIII., in 1892, and which is a paper of 168 pages, describing
and discussing sittings with Mrs. Piper in America. This was followed
in 1898 (Proceedings, Vol. XIII.), by "A Further Record of Certain
Phenomena of Trance," by Dr. Hodgson, extending to 298 pages, and
this again by a paper by Professor W. Romaine Newbold, entitled, "A
Further Record of Certain Phenomena of Trance, Part II.," occupy
ing 44 pages of Proceedings, Vol. XIV. To these may be added a
" Discussion of the Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Piper," by Mr. F.
Podmore, in the same volume, which,—though, like the present paper,
it does not add to the evidence,—throws interesting light on it.
Besides the above published papers, I have through the kindness of
Dr. Hodgson had access to certain unpublished notes of sittings held
previous to 1898, of which I have made some use in what follows.
Further evidence has been accumulating since the publication of
Professor Newbold's paper, and both Dr. Hodgson and Professor
Hyslop have, I understand, important further light to throw on the
subject ; but of this I know nothing at present in detail.
So much for the data ; I must add a few words as to the assump
tions I shall make regarding the origin of the information given by
Mrs. Piper. In the first place, I accept the conclusion arrived at, as
Professor Newbold says, (Proceedings, Vol. XIV., p. 7), by "every
one so far as I know, who has studied the case at any length, that it
xxxvi.] Discussion of Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Piper. 17
was not consciously got by Mrs. Piper during waking life and then
fraudulently palmed off on the sitter as supernormal " ; or, as Dr. Leaf
puts it: (Proceedings, Vol. VI., p. 559) "as to the first and most
obvious question, whether she consciously acquires knowledge with
regard to her sitters, with the intention of deceiving, I may say most
positively that I regard such a supposition as entirely untenable."
Further, I do not believe that the information as a whole is drawn by
normal means from the mind of the sitter ; I agree with Dr. Leaf that
" the more I consider the whole of the evidence, the more I remain
convinced that it gives proof of a real supernormal power, subject,
however, under conditions at which we can hardly even guess, to
periods of temporary eclipse," (Proceedings, Vol. VI., p. 561) ; or, as
Professor Lodge says, (Proceedings, Vol. VI., p. 443), "concerning the
particular means by which she acquires the different kinds of informa
tion, ... I can only say with certainty that it is by none of the
ordinary methods known to Physical Science."
What explanation then can we propose for the phenomena 1 In
discussing this question, I shall assume that telepathy— in the sense of
the impression of one living mind by another otherwise than through
the recognised channels of sense—may be taken as provisionally
established by the evidence collected by our Society and other
investigators. This being granted, I agree with Professor Lodge (op.
cit., p. 451) "that thought-transference is the most common-place
explanation to which it is possible to appeal " in the case of Mrs.
Piper. But in Dr. Hodgson's last paper he endeavoured to carry us a
momentous step further. He concluded that the hypothesis that we
are—in some instances, at least—in communication with the spirits of
the dead through the entranced Mrs. Piper is now practically proved.
This seems to me to be too tremendous a conclusion to base on
observation of a single medium ; even such prolonged observation as
Mrs. Piper has submitted to. I fully admit, however, that there is
very considerable evidence for it, and I propose to adopt it as a
working hypothesis for the purposes of the present paper.
Accordingly, the question I wish to argue is a subsidiary one, which
arises when this hypothesis is accepted. Granting communication from
the dead, I wish to argue for Telepathy versus Possession as the mode
of communication,—in an extended sense of the word Telepathy,
which I must begin by explaining.
So far, though a good deal of evidence has been collected for the
occurrence of telepathy between living minds both spontaneously and
experimentally, it has not been of much use to formulate hypotheses
as to what telepathic communication consists in and how it occurs,
because we have not been able to get the phenomenon sufficiently
under control to give us a chance of verifying hypotheses about it.
o
18 Mrs. Henry Sidywick. [part
But it may safely, I think, be assumed that, granting the existence of
telepathy, the explanation of it must lie in one of two lines. It may be
a physical process—a communication between brain and brain analogous
to light or electrical induction or gravitation. In this case it would
reveal to us a hitherto unknown sense, an unknown power of the
human body. Or it may be a spiritual process,—a communication
between mind and mind in which the physical world is not concerned ;
any cerebral change in the percipient being a consequence of it and
not a part of its cause. In this case it would tend to establish
scientifically the existence of mind apart from body, with the further
chain of probabilities that the mind continues to exist when the body
is dead, that it continues able to carry on telepathic communication
with minds in the body, and, indeed, that telepathy is of the nature
of the communication of disembodied spirits with each other. Con
versely, if we could prove the existence of the dead and their power
of communicating with the living, we should make it probable that
telepathy between the living was a non-physical process.
This intimate connection between the possibility of communication
with the dead and a theory of telepathy makes it, I think, convenient,
when we are discussing the evidence for the former, to use the word
Telepathy in a sense wide enough to include any communication
between mind and mind otherwise than through the recognised
channels of sense, whether the minds communicating be in the body or
not, and it is in this sense that I here use it.
The thesis then that I wish to maintain is this : Granting, for the
sake of argument, that the evidence concerning Mrs. Piper proves,
not only that there is telepathic communication between her trance
personality and living persons,1 but that knowledge is in some way
derived from those who are dead, we have still no sufficient reason to
think that the intelligence actually communicating by voice or writing
with the sitter is any other than Mrs. Piper herself. Call it Mrs.
Piper's trance personality, dream personality, secondary self, subliminal
self, or what you will, but it is still Mrs. Piper ;—Mrs. Piper in
communication of a supernormal but partial and uncertain kind with
other minds—minds of the living and of the dead—and conveying to
the sitter by voice and writing the information thus obtained, mixed
up with much that has been acquired or imagined in a normal way.
I am, of course, aware that, compared with the great question
whether communication with the dead takes place at all, the question
whether it reaches the sitter's waking consciousness through Mrs.
Piper's intelligence or directly is comparatively a small one. Never
theless, for those who answer the first question in the affirmative, it is
1See Proceeding! S.P.R., Vol. XIII., p. 373, for Dr. Hodgson's view as to this.
xxxvi.] Discussion of Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Piper. 19
important to know as far as possible how the communication occurs,
and for those to whom the first question is still an open one, the second
may have an important bearing on its solution ; for the facility with
which we accept new facts necessarily depends much on the coherence
or incoherence of the theory into which they have to fit. At any rate,
the two questions are distinct, and in considering the bewildering
mass of Piper evidence it cannot but be advantageous to look at it
from different points of view and to examine each question in detail,
and as far as may be by itself ; and I think that Dr. Hodgson, in his
able analysis of the Piper evidence, has hardly done justice to or
discussed sufficiently the hypothesis that in all cases, and however true
it may be that there is really communication between the living and
the dead, the intelligence communicating directly with the sitter,
through Mrs. Piper's organism, is Mrs. Piper.
The alternative hypothesis to which Dr. Hodgson inclines, and
which, even when not explicitly stated, seems constantly to be assumed
in his summary of the evidence for communication from the dead, is
that spirits other than Mrs. Piper's use her organism when she is
entranced, and that in particular the spirits of certain dead persons
known to certain sitters speak to them directly with her voice or write
for them directly with her hand. This is the hypothesis I wish to
oppose. It is the obvious alternative to the hypothesis which I am
about to advocate, again saying emphatically that I only hold it
provisionally and not as a final conclusion. To pass a final judgment
on the whole complicated subject of Mrs. Piper's trance utterances, to
decide what we can regard as proved by them, would, I think, be
premature ; and to pass judgment on parts of it without regard to the
whole, and without further experiment with other persons more or less
similarly endowed, would be rash.
The fact with which we have to start,—and which, prima facie,
gives plausibility to the supposition that when Mrs. Piper is in trance
the intelligence communicating through her is not her own,—is that it
invariably says it is some one else, and frequently acts a part unlike
Mrs. Piper's ordinary personality with very considerable consistency.
My own experience has been solely with the Phinuit control, and
those sittings in which I have taken part as sitter (as distinguished
from reporter) have been bad—that is, have afforded no indication
whatever of supernormal knowledge. Nevertheless I felt as others do,
not only that the Phinuit personality did not confuse itself with Mrs.
Piper's normal self, but that the sitter was under no temptation so to
confuse it. Conversation with it differed from conversation with Mrs.
Piper in her normal state as naturally as conversation with one
acquaintance differs from conversation with another. I have no
doubt that the case for regarding the communicating intelligence as an
c 2
20 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part
independent individuality seems yet stronger when it represents itself
as being an intimate deceased friend of the sitter's, sustains the part
with vigour, and, besides showing knowledge which it is difficult to
suppose to be derived from any one but the deceased, exhibits traits
characteristic of him and recognises appropriately his friends and
acquaintances. And the illusion is strengthened by the fact that two
seeming individualities are capable of communicating simultaneously,
one by the voice speaking and one by the hand writing.
It is, however, well known through experience that neither the
assertions nor the beliefs of secondary personalities are in themselves
worthy of credence, any more than one's dream impressions are ; and,
moreover, that—as may be seen in the case of some hypnotised
persons —they can often by suggestion be made to act, and apparently
believe themselves to be, any given character. The mere assumption
and successful personation by the trance personality of a character
different from Mrs. Piper's affords, therefore, no sufficient ground for
believing that it is not herself. Nor does the possession by the trance
personality and the normal Mrs. Piper of two more or less independent
chains of memory prove anything, for a similar distinctness in chains
of memory may easily be observed between the hypnotic trance
personality and the waking personality of the same individual, and
even between different stages of hypnotisation of the same individual.
(See Mr. Gurney's papers on "The Stages of Hypnotism," Proceedings,
Vol. II., "Stages of Hypnotic Memory," Vol. IV.; also L' Automatism*
Psychologique, by Professor Pierre Janet.)
Nor again does the simultaneous existence of two apparently
independent intelligences, one speaking and the other writing, prove
anything, for this phenomenon too may be observed in good hypnotic
subjects when the supposition that either intelligence was any other
than the subject's own would be obviously absurd. (See Mr. Gurney's
paper on "Peculiarities of Certain Post-Hypnotic States," Proceedings,
Vol. IV., and also Professor Janet's book.)
The only thing that would prove the communicating intelligence
not to be Mrs. Piper would be the possession of a stream of con
sciousness provably continuous with that of some other person and
discontinuous with that of Mrs. Piper. Proof of this would be
exceedingly hard to obtain, because if telepathy between the dead
and the living be possible, we may suppose either active prompting
of Mrs. Piper's trance personality by another spirit, or passive com
munity of ideas between the trance personality, the sitter and the
spirit of the deceased. Either might enable the trance personality to
produce a semblance of possessing the stream of consciousness of the
deceased within the limits of the communications that occur. The
trance personality actually claims sometimes that it is prompted, as
xxxvi.] Discussion of Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Piper. 21
above suggested, by another spirit. For instance, in a sitting of
Dr. Thaw's {Proceedings, Vol. XIII., p. 567), when his friend Dr. H.
was supposed to be communicating, not directly, but through Phinuit,
a long speech was made so characteristic of Dr. H. that Dr. Thaw,
wishing to know whether he or Phinuit was speaking, said, " Can you
tell me anything about Dr. Phinuit ? " The answer was, " I'm talking
to you myself, you rascal ; I'm talking for him." " Well," said
Dr. Thaw, "you're trying to make us think he's talking," to which
Phinuit replied, " I'm simply telling you what he says. I'm trying to
imitate him."
It will be replied that though it may be almost impossible to
produce clear proof for the world that the communicator is what he
professes to be, yet in spite of this difficulty, practically adequate proof
has been obtained in such a case as George Pelham's. For in this case
there is so much that is characteristic in small ways, in manner,
expressions used, etc., and in particular so unfailing a recognition of
friends, and recognition of them in a manner appropriate to each, that
for those who knew G. P. the conclusion is inevitable that no mere
prompting by G. P., no combination of reading of G. P.'s and the sitter's
minds by the trance personality could enable it to give so exact a
representation of him. The communicator must be G. P. himself.
It is, no doubt, impossible for one who has not had the special
experience on which subjective estimates of this kind are based to
judge fully of their value ; many small points involved can hardly
be conveyed in words, and others are of too intimate a nature for the
sitter to be willing to publish them. I think, however, that the
importance of the evidence for direct communication afforded by such
experiences may easily be over-estimated. I would point out, in the
first place, that the representation given of the deceased person must
from the nature of the case be of a very limited kind. For instance,
when the soi-disant G. P. communicates, he usually does so in writing,
the whole of Mrs. Piper's body except the hand being in an inert
condition. At the best, therefore, he is limited to the words he
writes and to the possibilities of dramatic representation of a person's
whole maniere d'etre through the movements of the hand alone. The
handwriting, it will be remembered, is not like that of the living G. P.
The case is not materially improved when the communication is by
spoken words, for gesture and expression and voice are still excluded
from the likeness, " and the language shows a tendency to depart more
or less from the language that would have been used by the com
municator when living" {Proceedings, Vol. XIII., p. 332). A likeness
under these circumstances must bear to a full dramatic representation
of a person somewhat the relation that a clever pen and ink sketch
done in a few strokes bears to a finished portrait in oils. The likeness
22 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part
may be unmistakable in both ; but that in the sketch, being limited to
a few salient points, requires much less minute knowledge of the
subject to produce.
In the second place, the likeness of the trance personality to the
person it purports to be does not strike every one equally. Thus Miss
W. writes (Proceedings, Vol. VIII., p. 29): "The clearly marked
personality of that friend, whom I will call T., is to me the most
convincing proof of Mrs. P[iper]'s supernatural power, but it is a proof
impossible to present to any one else." Yet her mother felt, after a
sitting, that "it did not really seem likeT." (Proceedings, Vol. VIII.,
p. 33.) And Mr. Marte, a friend of G. P.'s, formed, we are told, an
opinion entirely unfavourable to Mrs. Piper, from which I infer that
he did not think the personation of G. P. successful. (Proceedings,
Vol. XIII., p. 429).
The personation, again, is sometimes very imperfect, even within the
narrow limits possible. Thus, in Miss A. M. R.'s experience, the
communicator purporting to be her friend seems to have presented a
mixture of the characteristics of that friend and of Phinuit. She
writes (Proceedings, Vol. VIII., p. 113) :—
When my friend H. takes control of the medium, it seems to be quite a
different personality [from Phinuit], although there is something in the voice
or manner of speaking that is like Dr. P[hinuit]. The voice, however, is
not nearly so loud. When I asked him once why this was, he told me
that Dr. P[hinuit] was right by him, and that he could not stay a moment
without his help. In a great many little ways he is quite like what my
friend used to be when living, so much so that I am afraid it would take a
great deal of explanation to make me believe that his identical self had not
something to do with it, wholly apart from the medium's powers, or from
anything that may be in my own mind concerning him.
One more thing about these personations of known individuals I
may notice. They seldom, if ever, I think, profess to present them
selves in proprid persond at once. At their first appearance their
communications purport to come through some one else ; or, as Dr.
Hodgson expresses it, they " require some practice in handling the
writing mechanism, and at first the assistance of G. P. or some other
experienced amanuensis has usually been required." (Proceedings,
Vol. XIII., p. 376.) Thus at first Phinuit speaks for G. P., G. P.
writes for John Hart when he first communicates, and so forth. This
is what we should expect to happen if Mrs. Piper's trance personality,
with the aid of the sitters, and by means of knowledge accumulated
normally and supernormally, gradually acquires a more or less coherent
conception of the individual it ultimately takes itself to be. So, too,
on this hypothesis, should we expect the gradual improvement in the
personation which seems—in some cases, at least—to occur.
xxxvi.] Discussion of Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Piper. 23
So far I have tried to show that the grounds on which the belief is
based that the direct communicator is the person it alleges itself to be
may easily be less cogent than at first sight appears, even when that
person is known to the sitters, and is more or less successfully repre
sented. I now go on to show that the communications afford in ,
certain cases positive grounds for believing that the direct communicator
is not the person it professes to be and probably believes itself to be,
and, further, that it is Mrs. Piper's trance personality.
Inconsistencies, incoherences and contradictions in a communi
cator's account of himself, oblivion and error about things which it
seems inconceivable that the real person should have forgotten or be
mistaken about, and an intellectual standpoint inferior to his in life
are, it will be admitted, good reasons for doubting the communicator's
claim to identity. Suggestibility, a tendency to false excuses and
prevarication, to claim powers which it does not possess, a tendency
also to recur foolishly to things that have turned up at previous
sittings but have lost their interest, are characteristics of an automatic
personality. And that the automatic personality is here Mrs. Piper's
is confirmed by certain intellectual limitations, an interest in certain
kinds of trifles, and certain impressions as to what has occurred, which
the communicator exhibits, and of which the origin is most easily
found in Mrs. Piper's training and habits. I shall try to illustrate
these points by examples.
Phinuit is, of course, a glaring instance of a communicator whose
account of himself is inconsistent, incoherent and altogether impossible.
Mr. Leaf puts the case briefly, as follows (Proceedings, Vol. VI.,
p. 560) :—
That Dr. Phinuit is what he gives himself out, the spirit of a departed
Marseillais physician, I may say at once that I do not see the least ground
for believing. His own word does not, in view of his moral standard, apart
from other considerations, carry even a presumption of veracity ; nor has a
single one of the numerous statements he had made as to his life on earth
proved capable of verification. On the other side, his complete ignorance of
French is a positive ground for disbelieving him, and one which he has never
been able to explain.
The case against him is shown to be even stronger in the report
made by Dr. Hodgson in 1892. (Proceedings, Vol. VIII., pp. 50-54.)
Dr. Hodgson was not at that time inclined to believe Phinuit to be a
" spirit," and if he is more inclined to think so now, it is because the
G. P. control vouches for him in some sort.
The group of communicators whom Dr. Hodgson refers to in the
last section of his last paper on Mrs. Piper (Proceedings,Vo\. XIII., pp.
407-412)—the so-called "spirit guides" of Mr. Stainton Moses—again
are apparently so hopelessly at sea about their alleged earth life, and so
24 , Mrs. Henry Sidgwich [part
..
ignorant about Mr. Moses himself and what they were supposed to
have taught him, that I cannot see how it is possible to believe them
to be what they represent themselves as being. Mr. Moses' "spirit
guides," whether phases of Mr. Moses or not, wrote through his hand
that they were the spirits of certain definite persons known to history.
The names they gave have not, I believe, been published, and are
known to very few persons. In Mr. Moses' writings they appear under
the pseudonyms, Imperator, Mentor, Rector, Doctor. If, therefore,
they could, through Mrs. Piper, give the unpublished names which Mr.
Moses has left on record, it would be a very interesting piece of
evidence. But though Mrs. Piper's hand has written various different
names as being theirs, none are right ; and not only are wrong names
given, but they are supported for a time with insistence and detail,
only to be rejected afterwards in favour of others equally wrong. The
soi-disant Doctor, for instance,—in Dr. Hodgson's MS. records of
sittings—claims to be Homer, who sang of Troy, and is indignant when
it is doubted. Mentor, again, maintains, during more than one sitting,
that he is Ulysses, says (Dec. 7th, 1896) that he "often, often" sees
Telemachus, and that Penelope—though he does not apparently
remember her name till Dr. Hodgson suggests it— is with him always.
I do not see how elaborate false statements of this kind, inconsistent
with the claims of the communicators to be Mr. Stainton Moses'
" guides," are to be accounted for by any amount of difficulty experi
enced by them in using Mrs. Piper's organism as a writing machine.
The soi-disant guides of Mr. Moses are guaranteed by G. P. just as
Phinuit is, and this Dr. Hodgson seems to regard as a reason for
believing in their independent existence. But surely it may be equally
well regarded as a reason for believing the G. P. control to be itself a
phase of Mrs. Piper's trance personality. Moreover, believing in G. P.'s
guarantee involves us in difficulties, for he is capable of corroborating
false statements; e.g., Doctor's statement that he was Homer. And
further (on April 23rd, 1897), Rector warns Dr. Hodgson "not to rely
too much upon the statements made as tests, so-called, by your friend
George. He is too far away from your earth now to be clear in regard
to tests, test-conditions, etc." If the guaranteed spirits throw doubt
on the trustworthiness of the guarantors, where are we ?
As an instance of ignorance and mistake about its own name in a
personality professing to have been known to the sitter, I may quote a
remark of "Mrs. M." in Proceedings, Vol. XIII., p. 348. She says:—
The aunt of my husband's who died in June, 1894, has often sent me,
through Phinuit or my husband, some appropriate sounding message, and
twice purported to write herself, but never seemed able to give her own
name correctly ; it is an unusual name, probably unique in this country, and
I tried to get it written a number of times, but with no success.
xxxvi.] Discussion of Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Piper. 25
If the writing intelligence was really the aunt, this forgetfulness
of her name is odd, but it is still more odd that she should make
incorrect guesses.
A curious instance, not yet published, I think, of false statement
by the communicating intelligence occurred on one occasion (March
7th, 1894) when Dr. Hodgson had given the entranced Mrs. Piper
a MS. of Dr. Wiltse to hold. Later in the sitting Dr. Wiltse himself
was personated, the communicator stating in a confused way that he
was dead and his body in the water. Dr. Wiltse is well known to
readers of the Proceedings as having communicated several interesting
experiences to the Society, which have been published. In reply to
Dr. Hodgson's questions, one of these was described by the soi-disant
Dr. Wiltse sufficiently for identification, leaving no doubt as to the
person intended by the communicator. But all the time Dr. Wiltse
was alive and well and going through no abnormal experience of any
kind ; nor was any knowledge shown by the communicating intelligence
of his actual doings or surroundings. We may surely more easily
attribute this personation to a freak of Mrs. Piper's trance personality
than account for it in any other way.
Again, is it possible to suppose that Mr. Moses, who never was in
Professor Sidgwick's house, should, writing with Mrs. Piper's hand,
send a message, " when you see my friend Sidgwick, kindly ask him if
he remembers the evening we spent together at his own home " 1
Besides specific concrete statements, inconceivable as coming from
the person the communicator professes to be, we find evidence in
certain cases of a much lower intellectual standpoint than was his
on earth. Take, for instance, Professor James' account of the " E.
Control " (Proceedings, Vol. VI., p. 656) :—
The first messages came through Phiuuit about a year ago, when, after
two years of non-intercourse with Mrs. Piper, she lunched one day at our
house and gave my wife and myself a sitting afterwards. It was bad
enough ; and I confess that the human being in mo was so much stronger
than the man of science that I was too much disgusted with Phinuit's
tiresome twaddle even to note it down. When later the phenomenon
developed into pretended direct speech from E. himself, I regretted this,
for a complete record would have been useful. I can now merely say that
neither then, nor at any other time, was there, to my mind, the slightest
inner verisimilitude in the personation. But the failure to produce a
more plausible E. speaks directly in favour of the non-participation of the
medium's conscious mind in the performance. She could so easily have
coached herself to be more effective.1
Or, again, G. P., when he ventures on philosophical subjects, is apt
to miss the point in a way which I understand the real G. P. would

not have done in this life. I know Dr. Hodgson does not altogether
agree, but it seems to me impossible to .read the following more
detailed account of the sitting of which part is briefly described in
Proceedings, Vol. XIII., p. 428, and believe that the alleged G. P.
understood the questions or knew what he was talking about. No
difficulties of communication or interruptions from the sitters will
account for the absence of relevancy in his remarks.
M. : What do you think now about your argument on one and the many,
one or many ?
G. P. : "I was not absolutely wrong, but still I can hold a little different
argument now, John." . . .
M. : What do you think now about the multiplicity in the universe ?
G. P. : "I am convinced of the reality of the ego "
M. : He is getting off the track a little I guess.
G. P. : "which I want to explain after I answer your questions."
M. : What do you now think 1
G. P. : "My, the world will still go on multiplying and progressing and
advancing in knowledge."
M. : What do you now think of the appearance of unity and the multi
fariousness of phenomena ? Is there really a unity, or is it all contributed
by our intelligence ?
G. P. : " Oh, Marte, this is yes, there is a unity most certainly, help me
a little please."
M. : You know, George, you thought that the appearance of unity was all
due to our imagination ?
G. P. : " This light is weak I know, but I have answered your question on
that, and told you I was wrong." . . .
M. : What do you think of cosmical weather, George ?
G. P. : " It is certainly caused by . . . [undecipherable] . .

" that helps me ; ask your question again. . . ."
M. : What do you think about cosmical weather, Chauncey Wright's

G. P. : ". . . so my good friends can understand my answer. Marte,
you know what I mean. Oh, you were right most ..."
Mrs. Howard : Write again, most what ? Absolutely ?
G. P. : "Emphatically, it is iwt atmospherical weather."
Mrs. Howard : George, you are writing so fast ; now wait and see if
Hodgson can read that.
G. P. : "Why don't you help me" . . .
R. H. : We can't read after "emphatically" ; that is all we can read.
G. P. : "Atmospheric is the word, now I."
M. : Well, now that you have got into that world, George, have you got
any new light upon the character of natural law 1 Do you now find that
law is . . .
G. P. : " Yes, law is thought."
M. : Do you now find that law is permanent ?
G. P. : " Cause is thought."
xxxvi.] Discussion of Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Piper. 27
M. : That doesn't answer.
G. P. : "Ask it."
M. : Is law permanent, or is it only transitory result ?
G. P. : "It is permanent"
M. : Then do you agree with Chauncey Wright 1
G. P. : "and everlasting."
M. : Then do you agree with Chauncey Wright ?
G. P. : " Most certainly on that point."
Mr. Howard : What do you think of his views on cosmical weather ?
G. P. : "He knows nothing, his theory is ludicrous."
M. : He just said he agreed with him. That was the point I was asking
about, the permanency of law.
Other instances of communication below the education and intelli
gence of the supposed communicator will be found in a subsequent
part of the argument.
I proceed now to the manifestation of characteristics which belong
to automatism, beginning with suggestibility. The following is an
instance from Proceedings, Vol. XIII., p. 346. Mrs. M. writes :—
On February loth and March 7th, 1895, Miss Edmunds had two sittings
for me ... I asked Miss Edmunds to ask my husband to write his full
name, which was not on my visiting card, and which she could not possibly be
aware of. The name was at once correctly written, but for some reason Miss
Edmunds did not think it was right, and asked if the writer was quite sure
of it. The name was then differently written, though commencing with
the same letter R (which was on my visiting card).
Having once been assumed, it becomes established, and at a sitting
which Miss Edmunds had for Mrs. M., on January 25th of the follow
ing year (1896), the name was written again in the same way, though
Miss Edmunds then knew it was wrong, and knew what the real name
was. Now it is not likely that Mr. M., had he been in direct communi
cation with Miss Edmunds, could have been induced by the mere
expression of a doubt to substitute a name that was not his for the
true one. But if we conceive Mrs. Piper, dreaming as it were, and in
partial and fragmentary communication of a telepathic nature with
other minds, such as appears to occur between percipient and agent in
thought-transference experiments, the whole incident falls into line
with previous experience.1
In this particular case we have the interesting phenomenon of the
communicator being led by suggestion off the right track on to a
wrong one. But any one who has had sittings with Mrs. Piper will
1 It should be noted that Mrs. M. believes that her husband had actually com
municated through Mrs. Piper. Her summing up of the impression the whole series
of sittings made on her, given in Proceedings, Vol. XIII., p. 348, is interesting and
instructive. It will be seen that the giving of a wrong name was combined with
good dramatic impersonation.
28 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part
remember how indications given by the sitter are followed by the
communicating intelligence. Mr. Clarke, whose sittings are recorded
in Proceedings, Vol. VI., pp. 569-581, notes an instance of such
following of an intentionally false lead. Phinuit says (p. 574) :—
"You are the fellow that has got the hole in the ground with the black
things in it." (Sitter : " Coals ? ") " Of course, do you think I am a fool ?
There is something to come from that hole yet, because I see light beyond it."
[Note by the sitter :] "In the former sitting mention had been made of a
town lot and buildings as 'interest in the ground.' The vagueness of this
reference is here developed, by a question intended to be misleading, into
definite error."
Such incidents exhibit a form of the " fishery "—to use Professor
Lodge's word—so much practised by Phinuit, and which appears to
many simply a fraudulent attempt to get from the sitter the informa
tion to be reproduced to him as supernormally acquired. But though
there is no difficulty in supposing a trance personality guilty of such
deliberate attempts to make its powers seem greater than they are, I
think it probable that much of the apparent fishery is unconscious, and
merely due to a dream-like readiness to take ideas indiscriminately,
whencesoever they come, and weave them into a whole.
A disposition to assume powers not possessed and to resort to
prevarication and false excuses to account for ignorance or failure are
moral defects which are well known to be frequently exhibited in
automatic writing, and which are abundantly exhibited in Mrs. Piper's
trance utterances, whether spoken or written. I have said moral
defects, but perhaps it would be more correct to say defects partly
moral, partly intellectual. The habit of attributing to reason actions
and opinions really due to impulse or sentiment, and the consequent
necessity of finding plausible reasons afterwards in order to maintain
self-respect as a reasonable being, is common in human nature, and the
man who does it usually thinks he has really been influenced by the
reasons he alleges to himself and others. The apparently lower moral
standpoint of the automatic personality may be at least partly due to
abeyance of the critical faculty, which tends to render the powers
assumed and the excuses made occasionally so absurd that it is difficult
to believe the communicating intelligence to have taken itself in
by them.
The kind of thing I refer to is well described by Dr. Leaf in the
following passage (Vol. VI., p. 560) :—
Phinuit, in fact, exhibits just the low moral tone which we so often find
in table-talking, planchette, and other manifestations, as we now regard
them, of the secondary self. He swears freely, and indulges in slang of the
vulgar New England sort, in a way quite alien from the manners of Mrs.
Piper. This is, of course, a trifle ; but it is more serious when we find him
continually making attempts to deceive. If he is not able to make a right
xxxvi.] Discussion of Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Piper. 29
statement, he is always ready with a guess of more or less ingenuity to
conceal his ignorance, or at least with some ambiguity or subterfuge which
should make a show of turning the difficulty. Hardly a sitting passed
without his making at least a few statements which were altogether wrong.1
As a particular instance of Phinuit's prevarication I may quote a
passage in a discussion of him by Dr. Hodgson (Vol. VIII., p. 50) :—
Concerning his inability to speak French, Phinuit's original explanation
to me was that he had lived in Metz the latter part of his life, and there
were many English there, so that he was compelled to speak English, and
had forgotten his French. I replied that this explanation was very sur
prising, and that a much more plausible one would be that he was obliged
to use the brain of the medium, and would therefore manifest no more
familiarity with French than she possessed. This—trite enough—suggestion
appeared to Phinuit also more plausible, since a few days later he offered
it himself to another sitter as an explanation of his inability to sustain a
conversation in French !
But no one denies that, whatever Phinuit may be, he possesses many
of the characteristics of an automatic personality, and I may be asked
to produce instances of prevarication in other personations. Here,
then, is one perpetrated by a communicator professing to be Mr. Stainton
Moses. At a sitting (recorded in MS.) on November 14th. 1896, he
says : " Give my love to . . . Myers, Watts, Massey, Wedgwood,
Bennett, and any other friends who may inquire for me." Dr. Hodgson
naturally replies, " But Wedgwood is with you now, isn't he t " To
which the communicator, with obvious insincerity, rejoins, " I intended
this. He just mentioned to send his love also."
G. P. is the supposed communicator in the following case. He
had been asked at a previous sitting for names of the members of a
certain association. He says : —
I answered part of that question [the part he answered was correct], but
did not give the names of the other two people, because it would be no test,
because I told her [Mrs. Howard] the names of the other two in life, and as
she knows them, if I was to give the names in her presence, they would
say it was thought-transference. No, I shall reserve the two names to tell
Hodgson some time when he is alone with me, because he does not know
them. [All true.] (Proceediwjs, Vol. XIII., p. 303.)
Dr. Hodgson remarks on this, " Many will regard this as perhaps
an excuse for ignorance, as names subsequently given were not
correct." I confess to being one of the many, but I think it would be
hard on G. P. to attribute the false excuse to him.
An experiment frequently tried in sittings with Mrs. Piper is to
ask the " control " to visit distant people or places and report what is
(i Cf. also Mr. Myers' remarks on automatic personalities, Proctcdhiqs, Vol. VI.,
p. 4-W.)
30 Mrs. Henry Sidywick. [part
seen. The communicator generally professes to be able to do this ; but
the profession is seldom justified by the results, though there are
apparent exceptions. Now that Mrs. Piper's trance personality should
imagine it has this power, and should accordingly dream that it visits
the places—that, in fact, Mrs. Piper dreaming should imagine the
whole thing—is natural enough ; but it is, I think, going out of our
way to complicate hypotheses by attributing the dream to G. P. or
"George Eliot." While the series of hitherto unpublished sittings to
which I have more than once referred was going on, Mr. Myers was
holding a series with another medium in England. It had been arranged
between him and Dr. Hodgson that supernormal communication
should, if possible, be established between the two. Mrs. Piper's
"controls"— "George Eliot" especially—professed to visit Mr. Myers'
circle and to give and receive messages. Not once was there a
glimmer of truth in what was said. Mr. Myers wrote : " Yours up to
April 23rd inclusive received. Not a vestige of truth ; no messages
received ; whole description erroneous." After hearing this, " George
Eliot " continues to assert that she gave the messages, and saw the
sitters, and when Dr. Hodgson asks, " How about the numerous
messages that you brought back from Myers 1" replies, "We would
ask you to ask him to consider carefully what his thoughts were, that
is, those not put into actual speech." Observe that it is not merely
the failures that I lay stress upon, but the reiterated false statements
that things have been seen which have not been seen, and messages
received that have not been received, or delivered that have not been
delivered. We find (Vol. XIII., p. 345) Mrs. M.'s husband similarly
professing to repeat messages, but always giving them quite wrong,
except in one case, and in that case there had been no deliberate
experiment. Of the same character are the incidents connected with
Miss Hannah Wilde's letter, of which Professor James gives the
following account in 1890 (Vol. VI., p. 657) :—
Mrs. Blodgett, of Holyoke, Mass., and her sister, devised, before the
latter died, what would have been a good test of actual spirit return. The
sister, Miss H. W., wrote upon her death-bed a letter, sealed it, and gave it
to Mrs. B. After her death no one living knew what words it contained.
Mrs. B., not then knowing Mrs. Piper, entrusted to me the sealed letter,
and asked me to give Mrs. Piper some articles of the deceased sister's
personal apparel to help her to get at its contents. This commission I
performed. Mrs. P. gave correctly the full name (which even I did not
know) of the writer, and finally, after a delay and ceremony which occupied
several weeks on Phinuit's part, dictated what purported to be a copy of the
letter. This I compared with the original (of which Mrs. B. permitted me
to break the seal) ; but the two letters had nothing in common, nor were
any of the numerous domestic facts alluded to in the medium's letter
acknowledged by Mrs. Blodgett to be correct. Mrs. Piper was equally
xxxvi.] Discussion of Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Piper. 31
unsuccessful in two later attempts which she made to reproduce the con
tents of this document, although both times the revelation purported to
come direct from its deceased writer.
This subject of Miss Hannah Wilde's letter continues to recur at
sittings long after the above passage was written, and always with
equal futility. It is an instance of the foolish return to a subject
which has lost its interest, which we find in cases where co-ordination
is lacking, as in automatic writing or second childhood. Dr. Hodgson
notices this characteristic, and describes it as follows (Vol. X1IL,
p. 333) :—
That the writing should frequently—especially towards the end of the
sitting, as the communicator becomes exhausted and stupefied, and loses the
power of inhibition—become extremely automatic and dreamy is to be
expected ; and questions put to the communicator in this state will be
answered by the first vague associations that rise to the surface of the failing
consciousness. Not only is this the case, but such irrelevant (as they may
be) associations occasionally tend to recur at later periods, when the com
municator lapses into the same stage of dreaminess, precisely as they might
be expected to do in ourselves. For example, in the latter part of Professor
Norton's sitting on May 26th, 1894, when Professor Norton put a question
which G. P. living iu full consciousness would have answered by a reference to
an essay he wrote at Harvard on Jane Austen, G. P. replied by references to
what he had written about Robert Noyes (pseudonym), the life of whom he
had published not long before his death, and to articles in the Sim, a New York
paper with which he was connected at the time of his death. Professor
Norton then mentioned Jane Austen. On two or three later occasions, at the
end of a sitting, when the writing became particularly dreamy, the name of
Professor Norton appeared in connection with that of Jane Austen.
The difference between Dr. Hodgson's interpretation of this dream
like futility and my own is that he is disposed to attribute it to the
difficulties of a spirit other than Mrs. Piper in using her organism,
while to me it seems an indication that the communicators are no
other than Mrs. Piper herself in trance.
So far the qualities I have wished to call attention to in the
communications—indications of suggestibility and so forth—are such
as might occur in any automatic writing. But it somewhat strengthens
the case to note that there are many things in the communications
which are natural enough if we suppose them to come from Mrs.
Piper, but decidedly less so if attributed to the supposed com
municator. I think it is to Mrs. Piper's own interest in such
trifles that we may trace the frequent recurrence in the sittings of
domestic details—new hate, lost pocket-handkerchiefs, etc.—and to the
customs of Mrs. Piper's social circle that we may trace such a false
statement by the supposed G. P. as the following :—In answer to the
question, " Can't you tell us something . . . your mother has
32 Airs. Henry Sidgivick. [part
done?" he replies, "I saw her brush my clothes and put them away.
I was by her side when she did it." As a matter of fact, G. P.'s
clothes were brushed and put away after his death, as Mrs. Pelham
wrote, not by herself, but by " the man who had valeted George."
G. P. was not likely to suppose that his mother would personally brush
his clothes, or to be interested in the matter at all ; but in Mrs. Piper's
mind the idea would easily associate itself with the ideas of his death
and his mother.
Phinuit's intellectual attainments were notoriously limited to Mrs.
Piper's. We have already referred to his ignorance of French, and
again Dr. C. W. F. (Proceedings, Vol. VIII., p. 51) questions whether
Phinuit's medical knowledge extends " beyond what Mrs. Piper has
read in ' Domestic Medicine.' He always gives the common or vulgar
names of the medicines he describes, and never their botanical ones."
Similar limitations are conspicuously shown in references to history,
literature, and science. We may take the statement by the alleged
Sir Walter Scott that there are monkeys in the sun as an instance.
This is mentioned by Professor W. R. Newbold (Proceedings, Vol.
XIV., p. 48) in connection, as the reader will remember, with a very
curious and interesting incident indicating thought-transference from
a distance between himself and Dr. Hodgson and Mrs. Piper, which
I need not enter into here.
The most glaring instances of what I mean naturally occur in the
course of non-evidential parts of Mrs. Piper's trance utterances, which
have not generally been published. I will give some from the MS.
records of unpublished sittings. Here is a biological statement
made on January 27th, 1897. Imperator says, the "interior," the
" spirit," comes in " in the bird and the monkey," not in the horse
or the dog ; for " the brain of each is of a lower quality, and has
practically no mind." All birds and monkeys, he says, have " in
teriors," but no other animal except man. The following again are
specimens of chemistry and physics. Rector says, on February 1st,
1897, that " the spiritual ether is not composed of oxygen and
hydrogen . . . it is composed of the finer tissues termed lumini-
ferous ether." And Imperator tells Dr. Hodgson on February 5th,
1897, that "the etherial or spiritual body is composed of air, light,
and a large amount of hydrogen " . . . " heat, light, air, hydrogen."
Later in the sitting he says " it is known to us as ether," and further
" the body of the medium becomes filled with luminiferous ether
. . . until it is so distended that it cannot contain any more."
Dr. Hodgson naturally expostulates about some of these statements,
and Imperator accordingly modifies his views as the sitting proceeds,
and finally arrives at the assertion that " the ether body is a subtle
and exquisite matter known to us as vacium . . . not on the
xxxvi.] Discusxion of Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Piper. 33
same plane as hydrogen at all." And we are reduced to a still more
hopeless state of confusion between mind and matter when we are
told next day that "vacium" is "known as love." Confusion in all
this there undoubtedly is, but it is, I think, clearly the confusion of a
person talking about what he does not understand, not the confusion
of a person who knows, but has a difficulty in expressing himself.
And the same is true of the communicator's views on literary and
historical matters. For instance, Mentor, on December 7th, 1896,
when professing to be Ulysses, is asked by Dr. Hodgson after Achilles.
He says "the murderer." Dr. Hodgson: "He slew Hector." Mentor:
" Yes," and later he explains " His intentions were not evil, it was
an insane impulse." On another occasion (June 4th, 1897) "George
Eliot " describes her meeting with Bacon, who says, " You have
questioned my reality. Question it no more. I am Shakespeare." On
March 30th, 1897, again, " George Eliot " met " several distinguished-
looking gentlemen,—Shelley and Chaucer, the original and only
writer of ' Canterbury Tales,' then Burns" ... "I also saw the
original Adam Bede " . . . " also Homer."
The same want of knowledge is shown in the statements of Mrs.
Piper's " Imperator " about Melchisedek — such as that "just before
Israel was sent into bondage " Melchisedek " departed and returned to
(Sod" (on February 22nd, 1897), or (at the same sitting), that "about
the time of his [Melchisedek's] ascending there came the tribe known
as the Jews." Again (February 23rd), an interval is assumed between
the days of Melchisedek and of Abraham during which " none better,
purer, more godlike reigned than he." After this Dr. Hodgson gave a
brief account of the blessing of Abraham by Melchisedek, and the
next day (February 24th), when taxed with having spoken of the days
between Melchisedek and Abraham, Imperator says, " That is wrongly
registered ; there was no time between." Again, on March 10th,
" Imperator " says that Melchisedek reigned spiritually all through
the days of " Abraham, Moses, Elijah and Elisha down to the days of
King David." Now Mr. Stainton Moses' " Imperator " said a good
deal about Melchisedek which has been published in Spirit Teachings,
and which, though there is no ground for supposing it to be all true,
is at any rate sensible and coherent, and such as we should expect
from an educated man. A comparison of the account given by Mrs.
Piper's Imperator and Mr. Moses' Imperator reveals some faint
resemblances between the two—just enough to suggest that Mrs. Piper
had seen the passages in Spirit Teachings, as was doubtless the case,
since Dr. Hodgson left a copy with her on January 27th. The
reproduction, if reproduction it can be called, is certainly not what
one would expect from a person who had got up what had been said in
order to reproduce it. But on the other hand, the remarks I have

quoted and referred to will hardly, I think, seem to any one to be
those of a person who understands what he is talking about and is only
hindered from making it clear by a difficulty in manipulating the
machinery of communication. They are statements which can only be
explained by supposing absence of knowledge.
The illustrations I have given are, I think, sufficient, or perhaps
my readers may think more than sufficient. It only remains briefly to
recapitulate the argument. We have presented to us in Mrs. Piper's
trance a number of soi-disant different personalities—some of them
known to have lived and to be now dead, some of them living, some
probably imaginary. The statements and the intellectual calibre of
many of them are utterly inconsistent with their claims, and even in
the best personations there are lapses which cannot easily be explained
if we are in direct communication with the professed communicator.
These lapses and limitations, and other characteristics of the communi
cations, are just such as have been frequently observed in secondary
personalities, and in particular correspond to what we should expect
to find in Mrs. Piper's secondary personality under the suggestive
influence of the conditions of the sittings. I am, therefore, driven
to the conclusion that Mrs. Piper's trance-intelligence has a strong
tendency to unconscious dramatic personation ; and is continually
dreaming itself to be a number of different persons under the influence
of suggestion (including self suggestion) somewhat as an ordinary
hypnotic subject can be made by suggestion to assume different
characters with startling dramatic effect. At the same time—as
we have assumed throughout—along with the limitations there are
fragments of knowledge exhibited by the trance personality in some
sittings, which it is very difficult to suppose to have been acquired
by Mrs. Piper in any normal way. A large proportion of these
fragments of knowledge are in the minds of the sitters, some are
in the minds of distant living persons, and a few were, so far as
we can tell, known only to the dead. And further the selection
and grouping of some of these fragments, even when they might
have been learnt from living minds, is, as Mr. Hodgson has pointed
out, sometimes most easily explained by supposing that the dead are
partially responsible for it. Now, if we may assume that telepathy
is possible between living minds and between the minds of the living
and of the dead, and that the process in the two cases is similar, we
find that our facts arrange themselves in a comparatively simple
way. Mrs. Piper, we suppose, has in trance an unusually developed
telepathic faculty. As in telepathic experiments with hypnotised
subjects, ideas come to her in more or less dream-like sequence with
out her being generally able to trace their origin, which is sometimes
telepathic and more often not.
xxxvi.] Discussion of Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Piper. 35
It is introducing a complication almost gratuitously to suppose that
communication with the dead is different in kind from telepathic
communication with the living, and that, in order to communicate,
the dead must turn out Mrs. Piper's spirit and themselves take its
place in her organism, —their want of practice in using it being
the cause of the confusion and imperfection of the communication.
Confusion and imperfection we certainly find ; but we always have
found them in thought-transference experiments, and we do not try
to account for this by supposing that the agent's spirit makes direct
use of the percipient's nervous system to express through it the num
bers or diagrams to be transferred and, owing to want of the same
practice in using the percipient's brain that he has in using his own,
often gives the wrong number ! Why, if the communication occurs
at all, it should be so fragmentary and irregular, wo cannot tell.
Where the failure in the transmission occurs we do not know. It may
well be in the organism ;—it is conceivable that potentially and sub-
liminally all minds are in telepathic communication, though the results
emerge into consciousness obscurely and incompletely, and often not
at all. But to suppose the organism to be the cause of the failure is a
very different thing from the ponderous hypothesis that another spirit
uses that organism, and uses it imperfectly.
It would not, however, be fair to call the hypothesis of spirit
possession quite gratuitous, for there is a difficulty in the telepathic
hypothesis to which I have not yet referred. It is that agents differ.
Some persons in the body seem capable of acting as agents when others
are not, and agents in the spirit similarly vary ; but while we can
suppose that the difficulty in the case of living agents is physical and
due to the agent's organism, we cannot thus account for it in the case
of the dead. It is probable enough, however, that the difficulties may
sometimes be psychical, especially as this would be analogous to our
experiences in daily life, when the difficulties human beings have in
making themselves understood by one another are by no means only
physical.
But there is another factor playing an important part in the
Piper sittings which has hardly, I think, received the consideration it
deserves, and to which these differences in the veridicality of the
communications are evidently at least partly due, namely, the sitter.
The success of sitters in obtaining interesting communications varies,
as we know, enormously, and there are persons who sit with Mrs.
Piper—have even sat often with Mrs. Piper—and though they receive
plenty of communications, receive none which there is the slightest
reason to suppose supernormal at all. It is, I think, the case that the
sitters who obtain most evidence of supernormal communication of
some kind are those whose sittings afford evidence of supernormal
d 2
36 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part
communication of all kinds, both of thought-transference from the
sitter and of communication with the dead or with distant living
minds. If it were only a question of information derived by Mrs.
Piper telepathically from the sitter, it would be easy to attribute the
failure of an unsuccessful sitter to his being a bad agent ; but a good
sitter seems in some way to make the process of transmission easier,
even when he does not seem to be the source of the information.
I do not think Dr. Hodgson has attempted to explain this. He,
of course, recognises the fact, and says, indeed (Proceedings XIII.,
p. 371), "There are certain persons who appear to be almost entirely
unsuccessful as regards communications from their ' deceased ' friends,
and indeed at ' sittings' altogether, and from causes which apparently
inhere in themselves." But these causes appear to Dr. Hodgson—
judging from what he says further on in the same paragraph—to be
such things as want of attention or of desire to succeed ; or, again, to
quote his words, " It may even be that the state of mind of some
persons is actually repellent to the efforts which their 'deceased' friends
make to communicate." Such causes as these, no doubt, may operate,
but there is something more. I speak as one who has uniformly
failed, whether as agent or percipient in thought-transference experi
ments, or as sitter with Mrs. Piper and other mediums, and I am
sure that the cause is not want of sympathy or desire to succeed, or
belief that success is possible. After years of failure the inevitable
absence of hope may have a damping effect, but this will not account
for failure when hope is still fresh. I think it is certain that the sitter
does not serve only as an attraction to his deceased friends, but that,
—granting, as I am doing throughout, the genuineness of Mrs. Piper's
power,—there are subliminal qualities in the sitters which make the
exercise of this power possible with some and not with others. Now
this is not, I think, consistent with the hypothesis that the commu
nicator in the other world uses Mrs. Piper's organism directly ; for if
so, why should it be more difficult for him to speak or write for A
than for B? We require a hypothesis which allows for all three
minds—the minds of the deceased friend, of Mrs. Piper, and of the
sitter—being subliminally concerned in the result.
In attempting to frame such a hypothesis, two things should, I
think, be borne in mind. First, I cannot but assume that, whatever
other sources of information Mrs. Piper may draw from, she does
sometimes draw telepathically from the sitter's mind. Evidence
excluding other possible sources of information is, almost necessarily,
rare, but it is afforded when mistaken ideas of the sitters are
reproduced. As instances of this I may refer to an experience of Pro
fessor Newbold's, given in Proceedings, Vol. XIV., pp. 9, 24 ; also to
an attempt of G. P. to describe the contents of a letter presented by
xxxvi.] Discussion of Trance Phenomena of Mrs. Piper. 37
Mrs. Howard, when what G. P. said corresponded not with the actual
letter, but with one which Mrs. Howard mistakenly thought she had
presented (Proceedings, Vol. XIII., p. 320).
Secondly, our other investigations have produced some evidence,
though not a great deal, pointing to the possibility of telepathic com
munication between the dead and living persons in a normal condition
(not entranced)—evidence of the same kind, though much less in
amount and in cogency, as that which apparitions at the moment of
death afford of telepathic communication between the dying and their
living friends. I do not propose to go into this here, and will only
refer the reader to a paper by Mr. Gurney and Mr. Myers on
" Apparitions occurring soon after Death," in Proceedings, Vol. V.,
and to Chapter XVII. of the " Report on the Census of Hallucina
tions," Proceedings, Vol. X. I think now, as I and the other writers
of the Report thought then, that the amount of evidence is not in
itself sufficient to constitute anything like a conclusive case for post
mortem agency. Still it should not be ignored.
Now, obviously, if we once admit that telepathic impacts sometimes
reach the normal consciousness of percipients through hallucinations,
there is no need to suppose that those which do so are all the telepathic
communications which occur. An unknown proportion—perhaps a
very largo proportion—may, for aught we know, never rise above the
subliminal consciousness ; just as ideas suggested to a hypnotised
person may remain entirely unknown to him when he is awake, or may
in some cases be brought to his waking knowledge by his own
automatic action or by a suggested hallucination.
If, then, it be granted that we are not without reason for thinking
that Mrs. Piper may be in telepathic communication with the sitter,
and that the sitter may, without knowing it, be in telepathic relation
with his dead friends ; and also —what seems to be certain—that the
sitter plays some important part in bringing about the results obtained
through Mrs. Piper, is it not conceivable that his function is, to some
extent, that of a channel of communication? The departed spirit
communicates, we may suppose, telepathically directly with his friend
the sitter, but this communication is entirely subliminal, and the sitter
is not normally conscious of it at all. Mrs. Piper in trance receives
telepathically impressions from some sitters which do rise, partially at
least, to her trance consciousness, and are then given back by her to
the sitter through the ordinary channels of sense in speech or writing.
Mrs. Piper in trance plays, on this hypothesis, a part analogous
to that of a bad mirror reflecting very imperfectly the contents of the
sitter's subliminal consciousness, coloured and distorted by the con
tents of her own. She does for the sitter, in a different way, exactly
what a veridical sensory hallucination does. Such a hallucination —
38 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part
say, an apparition at the moment of death—is generally an embodi
ment of many associated ideas from the percipient's own mind
combined with what we may suppose to be the immediate result of
the telepathic communication from the dying person. The percipient
will see his friend most likely in clothes of a familiar aspect and with
a familiar expression, in a position fitting in with his own physical
surroundings ; all these adjuncts to the idea of the friend being
generally, it would seem, due to the percipient's own associations with
the friend. Similarly we may suppose that Mrs. Piper derives from
the sitter impressions subliminally received by the latter from the
dead, combined with ideas previously in the sitter's mind, and repro
duces these further complicated by her own ideas. Sometimes—indeed
generally—there would be no evidence of any communication from
the deceased, the sitter's own ideas being, so far as appeared, alone
reflected. Further, it would not be at all inconsistent with the hypo
thesis that Mrs. Piper should herself, as well as the sitter, receive
in some instances direct communications from the dead. One result,
we may observe, would follow if the process resembles that which I
suggest. Mrs. Piper's trance personality would in the course of a
series of sittings gradually acquire as part of its own stock of ideas
a definite conception of the deceased agent, and as this happened, it
would become more and more difficult to distinguish veridical com
munications from those for which Mrs. Piper alone is responsible.
Any hypothesis must, with the very small amount of knowledge
we at present have, be exceedingly tentative, and the one I have
ventured to suggest, if true at all, can only be a very rough approxi
mation to the truth. The mere attempt to state it, probably gives a
misleading definiteness to things of which we have only a very dim
perception. But I know of no other hypothesis which seems to me to
fit at all even the very limited number of facts which we can regard
as provisionally established, or legitimately assumed to be so for the
purposes of the present discussion ; and I have ventured to bring it
forward in the hope that it may suggest lines of observation and
experiment which may throw light on the very obscure and difficult
questions involved in Mrs. Piper's phenomena.

DISCUSSION OF THE TRANCE PHENOMENA OF
MRS. PIPER.
III.—Reflections on Mrs. Piper and Telepathy.
By Andrew Lang.
. In Dr. Hodgson's " Further Record of Observations of Certain
Phenomena of Trance" (Proceedings, Part XXXIII., pp. 284-413), he
promises to consider objections to his provisional hypothesis. Such
objections I venture to produce. In 1898 his hypothesis was that
"the chief communicators" (with Mrs. Piper) "are veritably the
personages that they claim to be " (p. 406). This means, of course,
that, in Dr. Hodgson's opinion, Mrs. Piper is actually " possessed "
(in the old phrase) by the spirits of the dead. This is indeed a
"far-going" theory. But if we reject it, and also reject the idea
that Mrs. Piper is a conscious impostor, and in collusion, for example,
with such people as " Mrs. Howard," we must try to produce some
other hypothesis. The hypothesis of telepathy from the living has
been advanced, and has been met by Dr. Hodgson with arguments
of considerable force. Though I have no theory to offer myself,
perhaps I may be allowed to make a few remarks on the problem ;
especially as regards the telepathic explanation. When I published
The Making of Religion in 1898, one of my purposes was to set
forth alleged savage parallels to the "psychical phenomena" recorded
by the Society as occurring among civilised peoples, European and
American. Among such phenomena occurs the " possession " of a
human " medium " by a god or a ghost. When the medium at
Delphi, or in modern Burmah, China, Polynesia, savage North
America, New Zealand, or Africa, becomes convulsive, and afterwards
utters prophecies or other statements about what cannot normally
be known to him or her, the pre-scientific theory was that the organisa
tion of the medium is being used by a god or spirit. But this
" spiritistic " theory has been employed by mankind to explain
almost every kind of obscure phenomenon, and has in every field
been rejected by science; apparently with justice. When the theory
is now revived by Dr. Hodgson to account for the singular case of
Mrs. Piper, one cannot but regard it, a priori, with extreme
40 Andrew Lang. [part
suspicion. There are other grounds for distrust. Thus Dr. Phinuit,
the soi-disant spirit of a French doctor, is notoriously ignorant of
French, and not one of his statements about his earthly life admits
of verification. He is, or was, not only vulgar beyond belief, but also
tricky, evasive, false, dishonest. Thus Professor Peirce (May 1st, 1892)
says, after a "sitting," "Phinuit seemed to me to be constantly groping
after indications from me to correct and direct his intelligence, and
in some cases he seemed to be so directed." The "sitting" is "a
struggle for knowledge to which the sitter contributes."
I know how much some Psycliical Researchers dislike evidence
from anthropology, but a Zulu sitting with a possessed woman could
not be better described than in Professor Peirce's words. The sitters
are expected to give indications by beating the ground when the
seeress is right, and the seeress, like Mrs. Piper, constantly asks
tentative questions. "Who's Herbert?" "I get a Maria in your
surroundings ? " with a pause of interrogation. This is Mrs. Piper's
method: compare Callaway, Religion of the Amazulu, pp. 361-374.
As to the evidence for the Zulu method, it is explicitly set forth
in Bishop Callaway's Zulu texts and translations ; or see Making
of Religion, pp. 152, 153. The coincidence of Zulu and Piperian
methods is exact, as far as the " struggle for knowledge to which the
sitter contributes " is concerned. Professor Trowbridge, again, was
"struck by a sort of insane cunning in the groping of the woman after
something intangible " (Proceedings, Part XXXIII., p. 526). Pro
fessor Norton thought Mrs. Piper's conditions "analogous to those of
an ill person dreaming a suggested dream, in which trains of dreams
to which the dreamer has been accustomed are modified by the special
conditions of the moment." He made no doubt of Mrs. Piper's good
faith, but what is the good faith of " an ill person " in a dream
modified by the sitters?
Thus both Phinuit and Mrs. Piper's performances in general have
produced the worst impression on various and most intelligent
observers. Professor Macalister says : " I let her see a blot of ink
on my fingers, and she said that I was a writer." This implies, of
course, that, through her apparent trance, Mrs. Piper's normal self
was on this occasion wide awake and eager to catch at any knowledge
that could be normally acquired. Even if Mr. Macalister had been
happier in later sittings that blot remains indelible. Mr. Macalister
"thought the whole performance an imposture and a poor one."
Later, an American author, cited as Mr. Marte, who knew " G. P.,"
" formed an opinion entirely unfavourable to Mrs. Piper." Dr. Weir
Mitchell is a thoroughly qualified observer as a physician and a
man of the world, and he says that had he not heard Professor
James's statements, he would have come to the conclusion " that the
xxxvi.] Mrs. Piper and Telepathy. 41
whole thing was a fraud and a very stupid one." Later sittings, of
course, might have altered that opinion. [Proceedings, Vol. VI., pp.
605-606 ; Part XXXIII., pp. 429-483). Mr. Barkworth, as far as his
own experiences went, set down any successes to muscle-reading.
I might quote many such results, but what chiefly confirmed my
own suspicions were the so-called communications, through Mrs
Piper, of Professor Oliver Lodge's deceased uncle. I have not space
for a detailed comparison of what Mrs. Piper said with what was
said by a surviving brother of Mr. Lodge's uncle as to some in
cidents of their distant boyhood. But lately I went through the
two accounts with a member of the Society, certainly not prejudiced
against Mrs. Piper, and I think he admitted that in only one case (the
possession by the uncle of a dried snake skin) did the revelation of
the dead really harmonise with the recollections of the living kins
man of Mr. Lodge. Of course, my memory may exaggerate. The
events, moreover (though they did not really occur at all as the dead
uncle described them), were exactly such as do arise in the expe
riences of almost every human boy. Readers can examine critically
the two statements, and decide for themselves (Proceedings, Vol.
VI., pp. 465-557). For these and other reasons I conceived that
Phinuit, at all events, was only a morbid secondary personality of
Mrs. Piper's. Now such personalities, or moods, or whatever we call
them, are notoriously apt to be dishonest, detestable, and the very
reverse of the patient's normal character. The old English proverb
says " Ale is another man "—that is, the alcoholic mood differs from
the normal personalty. The character of the dipsomaniac (say. Prince
Charles Edward) is the precise contrary of the victim's original
character. To take a more recent instance. The Dundee Advertiser
lately (December, 1899) published the sad story of a local artisan.
He got " mad drunk," doubtless on some infamously adulterated
whisky, went home and beat his mother to death. He then strayed
out, fell into some water, and on emerging knew what he had done.
He at once gave himself up to the police. Whisky was "another
man," and a much worse man.
Worse, too, than the normal self of the patient is, as a rule, the
non-alcoholic " secondary personality ; " the " preposterous scoundrel,"
as Professor Shaler calls Phinuit. In " unfortunate subjects of
abnormal conditions of the brain," says Mr. Huxley, " the dis
turbance of the sensory and intellectual faculties is not unfrequently
accompanied by a perturbation of the moral nature, which may
manifest itself in a most astonishing love of lying for its own
sake." He cites a case of a soldier whose left parietal bone was
fractured by a bullet. In his normal life he is honest, intelligent,
and kindly. In his abnormal intervals "he is an inveterate thief,"
42 Andrew Lang. [part
and all his proceedings present " a close parallel to the phenomena
of somnambulism and of mesmerism," including examples of strange
lucidity. Mr. Huxley cites " De l'Automatisme de la Memoire," by
Dr. Mesnef, in L'Union Medicate, July 21st, 23rd, 1874. His own
text is in Culture and Science, 223-231. The whole story is most
curious, and worthy of attention.
Now not only is, or was, Phinuit dishonest and tricky, but even
"G. P." frequently gives absolutely false information when asked
about what is occurring at a distance. He says, for instance, that
his father is writing a letter (an easy guess) when he is not. The
late Mr. Moses, when invited to give the real names of Imperator and
Co. (his " controls ") gives wrong names. The attempts of G. P. to
translate liartp i)fiSiv 6 iv rois ovpavo'a (Part XXX IV., p. 46; read as if
part of Mrs. Piper's mind was guessing on the lines suggested by
Pater (pater noster). The false information is given with perfect
aplomb, and is "not right, though natural enough," i.e., a deliberate
guess (Part XXXIII., pp. 345, 346, 347). The communicator is
"Mr. H."
We are told that subtle traits of the dead are recognised by their
friends in these communications. Thus a husband recognised familiar
phrases of his dead wife's, such as, " Well, I should say I had ! "
" Don't 1 1 " " Well, I guess ! " (Proceedings, Part XXXIII., p. 504).
But surely these phrases are excessively common in the conversations
of American women, if we may judge by the dialogue of American
novels. On the other hand, deliberate evasiveness and calm falsehood
were not the traits of G. P. and the rest when alive. Therefore I
would attribute these traits, at least, to Mrs. Piper's " preposterous
scoundrel " of a secondary personality.
That spirits, in the next life, making use of Mrs. Piper's brains,
nerves, voice, and hands, should be confused, is intelligible. But
why should they be impudently mendacious, absurdly ignorant, and
furtively evasive ; fluent in twaddle, and " groping " when a simple
question as to something familiar to them when alive is asked, that is,
in many cases ?
If Mr. H., or Phinuit, or G. P. were honourable spirits, they would
say that they don't know, when they don't know. They would not
give false information, " natural enough " (easily guessed), but totally
wrong. Such proceedings, on the other hand, are characteristic of a
secondary personality, which is occasionally supplied with right facts
by guess, muscle-reading, or even telepathy. Dr. Hodgson has ably
argued that the failures and confusions " fit the claim " of spirits,
and do not fit the theory of telepathy (Part XXXIII., pp. 391-396).
But the points on which I have dwelt do assuredly harmonise with the
notorious character of the secondary personalities of people honest in
xxxvi.] Mrs. Piper and Telepathy. 43
their normal state. And these points do not fit the character of
honourable spirits, eminently the reverse. Mr. Newbold insists on
this, in the case of Mr. Moses (Part XXXIV., p. 41). Indeed Mr.
Podmore. with his views of the performances of the incarnate Mr.
Moses (Part XXXIV., pp. 52-53) must regret that Mr. Moses and
his crew of " controls " have invaded Mrs. Piper.
In reviewing my book, The Making of Religion (Part XXXIV.,
p. 131) Mr. Podmore censures my remarks on Mrs. Piper (p. 151).
Dr. Hodgson's report (Part XXXIII.) came out, as I said, while my
book was passing through the press, and I had neither space nor time
for criticism. I merely said that the report did not win me to
Dr. Hodgson's opinion, namely, that the " chief communicators "
were spirits of the dead, and that I was sure my own dead friends
would steer clear of Mrs. Piper. I added that her interest for me was
" purely anthropological." If she deals with the dead, so, apparently,
do similar savage mediums. If the pretence is rejected in their
case, it will need a great deal of evidence to prove an exception for
Mrs. Piper.
Another example of this argument occurs. Speaking for the
"spirit" theory, Dr. Hodgson says (Part XXXIII., p. 396) that the
best results are got by treating the communicators as if they really
were spirits. "We should soothe him .... express sympathy,"
and so on. The Chinese know this, and, in using their peculiar
planchette, they adulate the communicators, and set out for them
wine, fruit and cakes. Even English planchettists (not believing in
spirits) address the " communicators " with flattery, and think that
the results are improved. Would Dr. Hodgson argue that they and
the Chinese are dealing with real spirits ? The argument seems as
good in one case as in the other,—that is, granting the improvement
in results.
So far, then, I think that the " communicators," even the best, do
show notes of the dishonest secondary personality of Mrs. Piper.
G. P., to be sure, recognises Phinuit as a real entity, a spiritual entity,
and surely G. P. should know ! But, if so, how can we account for
Phinuit's inability to prove that he ever existed on earth, and for his
ignorance of French 1 Dr. Hodgson says that many things are in
explicable by his theory of spirits, just as many " biological incidents "
have not been fully explained by the theory of evolution. (Part
XXXIII., p. 406). But the things not accounted for by the theory of
spirits are obviously of a morally suspicious nature, and include a very
low moral element. This is not, I am apt to think, the case with the
"biological incidents" unexplained; perhaps it could not be. Still,
the spiritual supercheries, after the fullest allowance for the confusion
of a spirit dealing with Mrs. Piper's body, donnent furieusenient a
44 Andrew Lang. [PART
penser. Thus it is odd that when asked to describe distant actions by
Mrs. Howard, G. P. should go wrong by a day, while he is quite awake
to our mere human time when communicating in ordinary sittings
(Part XXXIII., pp. 304-308). Perhaps he only succeeds, as is sug
gested, when people are thinking " strongly and emotionally " of
him. (Let us remember this.) Still, why confuse the time? The
volubility of G. P. in platitude contrasts again, as I have said,
unpleasantly with his accustomed hesitation when asked for a humble
test of his identity.
There is another point on which I venture to think that the
wonted precision and fulness of Dr. Hodgson's notes are absent.
We need to know, in each case, whether the sitter did, or did not,
hold Mrs. Piper's hand, and we also need to know how long the sitting
was in point of time. We must have information as to the chances of
muscle-reading.
Very singular are the possibilities of muscle-reading, of which I
give an example. Experiments were recently made on a blind, deaf
mute, a girl, to see whether she was utterly without hearing. She
looked pleased when music was played, annoyed or alarmed when
a hideous din was produced. But it was observed that she was
then holding the hand of a lady, her instructress. The lady being
placed at some distance, no sound that could be made affected the
expression of the child's face. No doubt her sense of touch was
exceedingly keen, but so may be Mrs. Piper's, when entranced and in
contact with the hand of her "sitter."1
Though Mr. Podmore accuses me of " liking my psychical bric-a-brac
restored and decorated," whereas Mrs. Piper's bric-a-brac is " battered
and worm-eaten," I do not feel guilty ! Even in a book written only
for entertainment (Hook of Dreamx and Ghostx), I investigated historical
cases by the aid of MSS. and rare books, and Celtic living tradition.
Overcoming the inexpressible tediousness and distastefulness of the
task, I have, in fact, several times read carefully through most of the
Piper records. I must now confess that, taking the G. P. notes alone,
I think there is primd facie reason for further inquiry. Dr. Hodgson
1 The case referred to is that of n deaf, dumb, and blind American child, Helen
Keller. See Mind, XIV., ji. 306. We read, " Whereas Miss Sullivan" (the lady
who instructed the child) "had been disposed to credit her with some inexplicable
mental faculty, it now appears, on closer observation, that her power of divining the
thoughts of those she is with may be wholly explained by her acute perception of
their muscular vibrations." I think I have rather overstated the case, because I
originally took it at second-hand from the conversation of a psyohologiea] friend, who
later supplied the exact reference. This is instructive, but it remains true that the
child showed signs of appreciating sounds when she held Miss Sullivan's hand ;
and not when Miss Sullivan placed her hands on a table. If Miss Roller is alive
and well, experiments a la Piper might be made with her, if she entertains no
objection.

shows, moreover, that written reports cannot convey the same impres
sion as is produced by years of personal experience ; and there must
he strong evidence in what overpowers his scepticism. Again, we are
not permitted to know, as he knows, the most telling evidence, and
that must be allowed for in our conclusions.
I do not think that the normal Mrs. Piper makes private inquiries.
That hypothesis I gladly discard. In the case of G. P. we learn
(Part XXXIII., p. 295) that he died by an accident, in New York, in
February, 1892. Mrs. Piper was then in New York, and probably read
about the affair (G. P. being, apparently, a more or less notable
person), in the newspapers. She could, if she chose, make inquiries ;
she might hear gossip (though I lay no stress on this), and G. P. did
not begin to possess her till several weeks later. But I do not
suppose that Mrs. Piper heard of Mr. Hart's studs (once G. P.'s), or
of " Katherine," and of circumstances connected with her which Mr.
Hart did not know that he knew, and probably never had known. I
would incline to explain these things (Part XXXIII , pp. 297-298) by
muscle-reading (if Mr. Hart held Mrs. Piper's hand, about which
nothing is said), or by telepathy. In M. Bourget's case, his hand was
in that of Mrs. Piper, and she took a very long time to give him
information which he certainly thought surprising.
Probably Dr. Hodgson ought to record the time occupied in a
conversation which may look very short in print, and certainly we
should know whether the sitter held Mrs. Piper's hand or not. These
facts Dr. Hodgson must have known in M. Bourget's case ; my recol
lection is that M. Bourget told me that he held Mrs. Piper's hand, and
that the sitting was fairly long. He remained, even so, unable to
explain the results, as he has said in print (Figaro, January 14th,
1895 ; Proceedings, Part XXXIII., pp. 495-499).
I recognise the importance of the case of Mr. Hart, Katherine,
and G. P.'s studs, and of similar examples.
We now come to the Howards, who did not see Mrs. Piper till
about three weeks after Mr. Hart. Here, again, I do not know if these
most intimate acquaintances of G. P. held Mrs. Piper's hand during
the sittings, nor is the time occupied by the conversations given.
These details ought, I venture to think, to be recorded. On the
hypothesis of Mrs. Howard's collusion, almost all the mystery vanishes.
[ believe in no such matter (knowing, as I do, nothing about Mrs.
Howard). In no such matter do / believe, but it is, to the sceptic, a
theory more acceptable than the theory of possession by the soul of a
dead man. But, in the case of collusion, Mrs. Howard (Part XXXIII.,
p. 306) would have told Mrs. Piper what she was going to do on April
28th (when Mrs. Howard was to have a sitting), not what she did on
April 27th. It was what she did on April 27th, that G. P. described
46 Andrew Lang. [part
as events of April 28th. Dr. Hodgson, in a similar case, suggests that
Phinuit was " getting glimpses into the mind of Mrs. Holmes, was
reading off some of her past experiences" (Part XXXIV., p. 307).
So Mrs. Piper may have read in Mrs. Howard's mind, on the 27th,
and transferred the results to the 28th, time being perhaps rather
mixed to her secondary self. Mrs. Piper's "secondary personality"
was as likely to do all this as G. P. was ; atid he is rather less of a vera
causa. Phinuit, by the way (Part XXXIII., p. 314) does not seem to
have known that G. P. knew Greek, and, indeed, in the next world he
knows very little.
In all cases, knowledge by G. P. of what occurs here, at a distance
from his sitter, seems to be "obtained indirectly and telepathically
through the minds of living people, rather than by a direct visual
perception, such as we enjoy" (Dr. Hodgson, Part XXXIII., p. 315).
If this be true, why suppose a surviving G. P. at all ? Mrs. Piper's
own " secondary personality " may be able to do all that G. P. (on the
animistic hypothesis) is supposed to do, —for example, could reel off, by
aid of telepathy, the long private communications to Mr. Howard who
was present (Part XXXIII., p. 322). G. P. was strongest with his
most intimate friends, and I admit that one does not see why this
should be so, if G. P. is only a function of Mrs. Piper's secondary
. personality. That fact, certainly, seems to be against the hypothesis
of mere telepathy between the living. We can scarcely argue that
G. P.'s friends only happened to succeed best with Mrs. Piper.
This brings us to the question whether Mrs. Piper's remarkable,
though direly interrupted, successes, say with G. P., are due to
information from the spirit of that gentleman, or to telepathy on the
side of Mrs. Piper, tapping, as it were, the minds not only of living
persons beside her, and often known to her, but also of living persons
distant, and unknown to her, though known to people in her room.
To this obviously wild hypothesis we are almost driven, if we reject
the theory of fraud, and the theory of communicating spirits of
the dead.
The hypothesis of fraud rests on a vera causa ; thus we might
say that Robert Houdin was bribed to give a false testimonial to the
clairvoyance of Alexis Didier. On David Hume's theory, a long set
of impostures is the most legitimate explanation of Mrs. Piper's
successes. For reasons given by Dr. Hodgson, I cannot accept the
theory of imposture by Mrs. Piper, in her normal state. For one
thing she could not afford the expense of private inquiries, which
would more than swallow up the profits.
Turning, then, to telepathy, Dr. Hodgson argues that there are
limitations, which gradually disappear, in the news given by persons
recently dead, and there are limitations at first sittings. (Part
xxxvi.] Mrs. Piper and Telepathy. 47
XXXIII., p. 392.) Moreover, good telepathic living agents (as they
seem to be) fail constantly with certain dead "communicators." But
G. P. was very lucid at first, though recently dead, and dead by an
accident. "First sittings," "first communicators," again, may be
confused, but the confusion may be due to the living "agents"; in
fact, as far as I see, the failure may always be due to living agents,
dealing with another living agent, Mrs. Piper. We know so very little
about telepathy that we can hardly argue on this side of the matter at
all. Possibly I fail to grasp Dr. Hodgson's full meaning in pages
391-393. " That memories of little children recently dead should have
a special telepathic agency" seems extremely natural, just as G. P.
is said to succeed most when people are thinking " strongly and
emotionally " of him. People do think " strongly and emotionally " of
dead children, and, perhaps, that kind of thought of the living sitter is
most readily caught by Mrs. Piper. Just so, if persons who died as
children forget childish things, as we are told, that may be because
the survivors, after many years, have themselves forgotten them
(though the subliminal self never forgets), and cannot wire them to
Mrs. Piper by telepathy or muscle-reading. Regarding the effect as if
of real traits of the personality of the dead, produced on the living
who knew them, it is evidence, I fear, only for the survivors them
selves. On the other hand, it is not like the late G. P., it was no trait
of his, to give false information with aplomb, nor was it like the late
Mr. H. to repeat, as true, what was only a " natural " guess. ^Thus the
sitter who knew the dead, may think he recognises personal traits.
But this may be due to his own memory of these traits, which are
telepathically reproduced by Mrs. Piper, or due to self-delusion, and
certainly other very important moral traits of the dead are often
reversed, and unrecognisable.
We are dealing here with a most imperfectly known agency,
telepathy ; with a better-known agency, the secondary personality ;
and with another wholly unknown agency, spirits of the dead. The
preference for any of these Laputan alternatives is apt to be decided
by personal bias. But, to a faint extent, telepathy has the advantage
of being a vera causa. The advocates of telepathy, attempting to
explain Mrs. Piper's successes, may fall back, as Dr. Hodgson says,
on "the hypothesis of telepathy from the living, that the subliminal
consciousness of the sitters, and also of distant living persons, might
he drawn upon by the living." Thus, Mr. Pelham is doing something,
in Washington, with a photograph of his son, G. P., and G. P. reports
this, at Boston, through Mrs. Piper. The explanation (apart from
guess or collusion) will be that Mrs. Piper got at the subliminal con
sciousness of the remote Mr. Pelham, and so on in other similar
cases. Such a telepathic explanation is " to the Greeks foolishness."
48 Andrew Lang. [part
Dr. Hodgson (Part XXXIII., p. 393) cites Mr. Oliver Lodge thus :
" It ought to be constantly borne in mind that this kind of thought-
transference, without consciously active agency, has never been
experimentally proved. ' How can you experiment consciously in
the unconscious ? But Dr. Hodgson adds that the successes and
failures do not show any direct relation to the conscious minds of
the sitters. Clairvoyance of Mrs. Piper's, or communication between
her and the subliminal self of Mr. Pelham, would cover the case of
the photograph at Washington, without calling up the ghost of G. P.
But, suppose G. P. communicates to Mrs. Piper what is unknown to
the sitter, but known to A. or B. at a distance, who are known to the
sitter. Can telepathy be forced to cover that 1
Dr. Hodgson puts the case thus : " We must then make the
arbitrary suppositions that Mrs. Piper's percipient personality gets
into relation with the minds of distant living persons, (1) who are
intimate friends of the sitters, at the time of the sitting " (as in the
case of Mr. Hart, who knew the Howards), " and (2) who are scarcely
known, or not at all known, to the sitter," but, in one of two cases at
least, were known to Dr. Hodgson, who was present (Part XXXIII.,
p. 394, p. 372). All this would imply "a selective and discriminative
capacity in Mrs. Piper's percipient personality " (as in the personality
of whoever inflicts a telepathic hallucination on a person at a distance),
and, widening this theory to cover all cases, " we reach a conception
which goes as far as the 'spirit ' hypothesis itself."
The conception does go as far,—but not in the same direction. It
stretches a more or less accepted hypothesis, —telepathy ; it does not
introduce an old but discredited hypothesis, the direct action of
the dead.
Now the stretching of the telepathic hypothesis was almost
forced on me (if I was to have any hypothesis) during Miss Angus's
experiments with a glass ball. I presume that these experiments
were " experimental," in Mr. Lodge's sense of the word, but I am not
certain. (Making of Religion, pp. 94-112.) There was in these
experiments, apparently, "a selective and discriminative capacity in
'Miss Angus's' percipient personality." But there was no room for
the theory of the spirits of the dead, for all concerned were alive. To
be sure the Polynesians explain all water-gazing by a theory of spirits,
but Dr. Hodgson will not agree with the Polynesians (Ellis, Poly
nesian Researches, II., p. 240).
Again and again Miss Angus, sitting with man or woman, described
acquaintances of theirs, but not of hers, in situations not known to
the sitters, but proved to be true to fact. Now the " far-going "
hypothesis of direct clairvoyance was here excluded (in most cases, not
all) by conditions of time. In one instance Miss Angus described
xxxvi.] Mrs. Piper and Telepathy. 49
doings from three weeks to a fortnight old, of people in India, people
whom she had never seen or heard of, but who were known to her
" sitter." Her account, given on a Saturday, was corroborated by a
letter from India which arrived next day, Sunday. In another case
she described (about 10 p.m.) what a lady, not known to her, but the
daughter of a matron present (who was not the sitter), had been doing
about 4 p.m. on the same day. What the person seen was doing was
not a thing familiar, for I asked that question. Again, " sitting "
with one lady, Miss Angus described a singular set of scenes much in
the mind, not of her "sitter," but of a very unsympathetic stranger,
who was reading a book at the other end of the room. I have tried
every hypothesis, normal and not so normal, to account for these and
analogous performances of Miss Angus. There was, in the Indian
and other cases, no physical possibility of collusion ; chance coincidence
did not seem adequate ; ghosts were out of the question, so was direct
clairvoyance. That Miss Angus (who, by the way, was in the most
normal and wide-awake condition) had got into touch with the
Absolute, and was making discriminating selections from the stores of
Omniscience, did not seem likely, because her crystal pictures appeared
to be directed by the mind of a person present, not always the sitter.
Nothing remained for the speculative theoriser but the idea of cross
currents of telepathy, between Miss Angus, a casual stranger, the
sitters, and people far away, known to the sitters or the stranger,
but unknown to Miss Angus. Unpublished examples of these things
went on the same lines. Miss Angus picked up facts, unknown to the
sitters, about people known to them but not to her.
Now, suppose that Miss Angus, instead of dealing with living
people, by way of visions, had dealt by way of voice, or automatic
handwriting, and had introduced a dead " communicator." Then
she would have been on a par with Mrs. Piper, yet with no aid
from the dead. Her cases do not differ from Mrs. Piper's cases,
except in copiousness, and in the circumstance that her condition
was normal, and that she was new to all such exercises. Of
course, like Mrs. Piper, she had failures. I asked her to try to
see the room of a person known to me by correspondence only,
a person whom I never met (it was a room in Africa, though
of course I did not say so), and she failed. It was trying her
rather high. We did not seek to improve the result by exclaiming
" Dear Tom, Dick, or Harry, in Bengal, Edinburgh, or the Soudan, or
the Red Sea, do try to appear more frequently in the glass," as Dr.
Hodgson addresses the dead " communicators." We could not do that,
because the essence of the game lay in Miss Angus's ignorance about
Dick, Harry, and Tom, who were kept private in the mind of the
sitter. Otherwise the performances of Mrs. Piper and Miss Angus
50 Andrew Lang. [part
were on a par (except for the deadness of the persons concerned),
granting the difference of the methods of crystal-gazing, on one hand,
and of trance-speaking, or automatic writing, on the other.
Not to rely solely on Miss Angus, I take another instance. My
friend Mr. Lesley is known to the world as a man of business, a
golfer, and a composer. He can see crystal-pictures, but (like most
of my acquaintances who possess the faculty, including my cook) has
hardly any interest in the practice. One day Mr. Lesley and I had
been talking about a lady, unknown to him, but known to me, though
I had never seen her house. Mr. Lesley began to look into a glass
water-jug, and described what he saw, the interior of the hall of a
house, with a good deal of detail. Neither of us recognised the
house. I happened later to tell this to the lady of whom we had been
talking; she said, " Whv_«+hat is -w*u_house," and, on visiting it, I
found that in all respects it "answ&^jTffcvMr. Lesley's description.
It may be a commah^ype of hall, but I HiLwt remember having seen
one like it elsewherfe, nor«tli»lpi\tj_liOsieyjkn^Tw\any such place.
Now, suppose tlVaj^the lady who occupied tMe house had been dead.
And suppose that, instead of looking at a%biss water-jug, Mr. Lesley
had gone into a trkrtQe,Jaa\T^iujJW^{c^j)r that the dead lady was
speaking with his voice. utlp[iii«"*fof^vhen asked for a test she had
described the hall in her house (which was unknown to me and Mr.
Lesley) with certain curious details. Would not Dr. Hodgson argue
that this might be better explained by the hypothesis of communica
tion through her spirit than by telepathy between Mr. Lesley and
anybody not present who knew the house 1 Yet, as its owner was
and is alive, the theory of a spirit is wholly impossible, and if not
telepathy a trots, then some other non-spiritualist theory must account
for the facts, as for the facts in Miss Angus's cases.
Miss Angus's successes may not be due to cross-telepathy, nor may
Mr. Lesley's success ; very likely that is the wrong explanation. But
of all known " supernormal" explanations, that alone is viable, in these
instances, and it is not, I think, incapable of application to Mrs.
Piper's cases. Of course I do not reject the explanation by spirits,
in Mrs. Piper's case ; I only state the objections which occur to me,
combined with the fact that Mrs. Piper is saturated with the animistic
hypothesis, and has a dishonest secondary personality, if not dozens
of such personalities. In Miss Angus's performances Mr. Podmore
suggests (Part XXXIV., p. 130) my own provisional guess of
telepathy a trois. It is a guess, even a wild Laputan conjecture
But we are here concerned with Laputan themes and speculations ;
like Mr. Darwin, we are making "fools' experiments." Dr. Hodgson's
hypothesis may be right ; but, in this region of dreams, we ought to
hold very lightly by all hypotheses : and, surely, we ought not to

argue from one of them in favour of that old belief, the posthumous
existence of the human spirit, and its power of communicating with
the living, through a living organism. This is to base faith on a
conjecture about conjectures. Moreover, in ordinary normal material,
such as philological or anthropological speculation, we often see how
science overshoots her mark, remaining for a generation in sure
confidence about a theory which the next generation explodes. "We
ought not to let our psychical theories affect our practical beliefs. To
do that may be to prepare for ourselves, or for our successors, a cruel
disappointment.
My objections are tendered with the consciousness that Mrs. Piper's
communications, to Mr. Howard, for example, are far more copious
and minute than the visions of the crystal ball gazer. But the two
sets of automatisms have common features in the way of picking up
knowledge, not, in many cases, possessed by the sitter, though familiar
to some other living person. And as spirits can (I suppose) have
nothing to do with this in the crystal cases, they may have nothing to
do with it in that of Mrs. Piper. Moreover, the visions in the glass
ball did not play tricks, or give false information. You, the sitter,
might think of Tom or Dick, and nothing might appear at all in the
glass, or something quite unknown to everybody might appear. But
Dick or Tom were not seen in situations which they never occupied, or
in actions which they never attempted, except perhaps in two cases,
apparently suggested by the expectations of the sitters. Possibly these
cases of cross-telepathy may be to the point. On Dr. Hodgson's side,
Mrs. Piper's re-creation of a personality, such as G. P., for example, is,
at his best, seems indeed a very difficult argument for an objector to
meet. Moreover, the conceivable " form of consciousness " of Mrs.
Piper, " like a dome of many-coloured glass," with colours corre
sponding, more or less, to many personalities of the dead, is indeed
" very much an unknown quantity." Alas, the whole problem is a
series of unknown quantities ! We remain none the less grateful to
Dr. Hodgson for such disinterested labour in a region which Professor
Shaler, most naturally, found uninteresting, because " I don't see how
I can exclude the hypothesis of fraud." Frauds by secondary person
alities, I fear, can hardly be excluded. We are like Porphyry, so many
centuries ago, in his wrestlings with "lying spirits." But, unlike
Porphyry, Dr. Hodgson has not been discouraged.
Since writing this paper I have been allowed to see in proof
Mrs. Henry Sidgwick's " Discussion of the Trance Phenomena of
Mrs. Piper." l We agree as to the notes of the " secondary per
sonality " of Mrs. Piper among her professed communications from
1 That is, the paper printed above, immediately preceding Mr. Lang's.—Ed.

the dead. We agree in not accepting the savage theory of " posses
sion," at least at present. But granting telepathy a trois (which
is a great deal to grant), I see no reason for the hypothesis that
Mrs. Piper ever receives telepathic communications from the dead.
Has she ever communicated a single thing that was known to a
dead person, but to no living man or woman ? Such are my doubts ;
my bias is a desire not to believe that the dead are in any way
mixed up with sittings at so many dollars. It would not surprise me
if some normal explanation (at which I cannot guess) were finally to
be found for even the most puzzling of all these phenomena. I am not
quite such a failure as Mrs. Sidgwick is personally as an intermediary
in these experiments. Twice my thought has (apparently, and in the
absence of any other hypothesis known to me) been "picked up" by
an experimenter, and in neither case was it my surface thought.
These things bias one in favour of the belief that there is something
here into which it may not be waste of time to inquire.

IV.
ON SOME PHILOSOPHIC ASSUMPTIONS IN THE
INVESTIGATION OF THE PROBLEM OF A FUTURE LIFE.
By F. C. S. Schiller.
There is always a flavour of impertinence about the intervention of
a philosopher in a subject of scientific research. He cannot, as such,
make original contributions to the facts, and when he makes an
attempt to criticise the contributions of others, he is terribly prone to
do so from the a priori basis of some far-fetched cosmic theory which
nobody else in the world besides himself believes in or even under
stands, and so becomes comic instead of cosmic. If, again, he contents
himself with ponderously pondering on the accepted facts of a science
he becomes a bore, consuming time and getting into the way of more
practical workers.
It seems clear, therefore, that the usefulness of a philosopher is
very limited. It is undeniable only in cases where he is needed to
clear out of the way other philosophers who have become obstreperous
and obstructive; but for the moment there did not seem to be anybody
in sight whom the spirit had moved to vilipend Psychical Research
a priori, and who, therefore, required to have the error of his ways
brought home to him in technical language.
Hence I was somewhat at a loss to see why the Council of the
S.P.R. should have deemed it expedient to request me (at very short
notice) to write a paper, the purely theoretical character and hurried
composition of which demand, I feel, the most abject apology. Indeed,
I could not have been induced to say anything at all, but for the
fact that philosophy seems to me to have also a function, not yet
mentioned, which may enable it to be scientifically suggestive and
serviceable, at all events at a certain stage in the development of a
science.
The function in question is that of discussing the working methods
of a science, of exhibiting their full scope and logical implications and
connections, and considering the merits of the alternative ways of
treating the subject. Such a critical methodology of a science is
necessarily dull, but, perhaps, on that account, all the better adapted
for philosophic discourse. And in view of the intellectual myopia
which scientific specialism engenders, there are, perhaps, few things
more salutary, as an unpleasant medicine is salutary, than for a
54 F. C. S. Schiller. [part
science to become conscious of the working assumptions, or, if you
will permit me so to call them, the methodological postulates, on which
it proceeds.
In the case of Psychical Research, in particular, the discussion of
such methodological assumptions seems to be more novel, easier and
more useful than in disciplines which have reached a more assured
position among the sciences. It is likely to be more novel, because of
the novelty of the whole subject. It is likely to be easier to dissect out
and contemplate in abstraction the methodological assumptions of an
inchoate and infant science, because its organism is not so strongly
knit and the flesh of fact does not so closely shroud the bone of method
by which it is supported ; it is still in a low stage of organisation in
which the whole may be taken to pieces and put together without
much injury to the vitality of its parts. An advanced science on the
other hand is far more difficult to handle : it imposes on the philosophic
critic by its very mass of coherent and consistent interpretation ; it
appeals to him by its noble record of service to the human race ; it
crushes him by the sheer weight of immemorial authority. In it facts
and theories have long been welded together into so indissoluble a union
that the former can no longer be questioned, while the latter have for
the most part risen to the dignity of indispensable ' necessary truths '
implied in the very nature of the human mind and underlying the
whole structure of human knowledge. We gain little help therefore
from the assumptions of sciences like mathematics and mechanics in
considering what assumptions should be made in a new subject like
Psychical Research ; we learn little about the making of a science
from sciences which can neither be unmade nor remade, and in whose
case it requires a considerable effort of philosophic thought to realise
the methodological character of their fundamental postulates. More
might perhaps be learnt from the assumptions of parvenu sciences
which have but recently obtained full recognition, but for the fact
that a critical dissection of their methods is decidedly dangerous.
For the " arbor scitmtiae " seems in their case to have developed a
symbiotic arrangement greatly resembling that whereby certain trees
protect themselves ; just as any attack on the latter is ferociously
resented by a host of ants which the tree provides with food and
shelter, so any interference with such a science is sure to draw
down upon the mildest critic the onslaught of an infuriated pro
fessor who lives upon the science. In Psychical Research, on the
other hand, no such danger is to be apprehended ; we have not yet
developed any professionals whose mission it is, as William James has
wittily remarked,1 to kill out the layman's general interest in the
1 Human Immortality, init.
xxxvi.] On Some Philosophic Assumptions. 55
subject, and hence the philosopher may proceed at his leisure to observe
how the science is made and to try instructive experiments with its
working methods, without fear of offending vested interests.
Again a philosophic discussion of possible methods is likely to be
more useful in Psychical Research because such methods are still
plastic cartilage, as it were, which has not yet grown into rigid bone,
and may be moulded into a variety of forms. Hence by reflecting
betimes upon the advantages of alternative methods, the philosopher
may flatter himself that he can be of real service in guiding the
course of investigation, or at least in helping it to avoid certain
pitfalls. Not, of course, that even here he would be wise to pre
sume to lay down the law a priori as to the actual working and
merits of the various methods ; he should content himself with
expounding the logical characteristics which sound methods in
Psychical Research must possess, and explaining why exactly they
must possess them.
I do not propose, however, on this occasion to discuss the
methodological value of the assumptions made in Psychical Research
generally, but only in so far as they affect the question of a future
life. The reasons for this are obvious. The possibility of a future life
provides the motive force in our inquiries. It is true that the S.P.R.
is unique in aiming to solve this problem in a scientific way, but
though we are scientific, we may yet be honest—in avowing the
existence of a practical motive. If attacked on this score, let us meet
our critics with the doctrine that in this respect at least we are not
unique, inasmuch as in the end all true science is inspired by practical
motives, and that it is the fear, no less than the hope, of a future life
that renders its possibility so urgent a subject for scientific considera
tion. Moreover, just now the evidence in connection with Mrs. Piper's
trances seems to have brought this possibility well above the horizon
of the S. P. R., while at the same time much confusion and prejudice
still seem to prevail about it which philosophic criticism may help to
dissipate.
I may begin by passing over with a merely formal mention the
assumptions which are required for every scientific investigation. As
a matter of course we must assume that the phenomena under
investigation are knowable and rational in the sense of being amenable
to determinable laws. The need for this assumption is so plain that
a priori attacks on Psychical Research on the score of undermining
the fundamental principle of all scientific research can hardly be put
down to anything but voluntary or involuntary ignorance of the
grossest kind.
Next we must enunciate a methodological axiom with which at
first sight few will be disposed to quarrel, viz., that we must proceed to
56 F. G. S. Schiller. [part
the unknown from what is known to us. The remark is Aristotle's,1
and I may be suspected of quoting it merely because Oxonians can.
but rarely resist the temptation of quoting Aristotle. But in reality
it is not such a truism as it appears, at least in the meaning I propose
to put upon it. It means in this connection that, both psychologically
and logically, we must interpret any supposed future life by the know
ledge we have acquired of our present life. It is a methodological
necessity, in other words, that we must project this world into the
next, if ever we purpose scientifically to know it. Our assumption may
be wrong in the sense that it may be wrecked on barrier reefs of im
penetrable fact—possibly it will be—but, right or wrong, we can work
with no other at the outset. As we go on we shall no doubt detect the
initial crudities of our assumptions, and correct them as our knowledge
grows. But whatever differences we may discover between the two
worlds must rest upon the postulate of a fundamental identity, in
default of which our reason would be merely paralysed. From a
complete otherness of the other world nothing would follow ; a future
life in which everything was utterly different would mean nothing to
us, and in proportion as the difference grows the practical efficacy and
theoretical knowableness of the conception diminish.
Now this, I venture to think, is a philosophic result of considerable
practical importance.
( 1 ) It goes a long way towards explaining the anomaly of the feeble
ness of most people's religious beliefs about the future life. For the
heavens and hells of the various religions, in spite of their pretensions
to evoke forces which should utterly dwarf the three-score years and
ten of our mortal life, are found in practice to constitute motives so
weak that they are continually routed and set aside by the trivial
temptations of the moment. The reason is that they have ordinarily
been conceived as differing too radically from the known conditions of
life to excite the same serious belief, to require the same matter-of-fact
forethought as, e.g., next year's crops or to-morrow's money market.
And so the belief in a future life, even where it has not been degraded
into a merely verbal assent to a traditional formula, has commonly
lacked that intimacy of association with the ordinary concerns of life
which is needed to render it psychologically efficacious as a motive
to action.
(2) Again, it turns out that the spiritists were by no means wrong
in principle when they proceeded to construe the future life, of which
they believed themselves to possess cogent evidence, very much on the
lines of our earthly life. Their constructions may in detail be as crude
and absurd as their adversaries allege—I am neither familiar enough

xxxvi.] On Some Philosophic Assumptions. 57
with the literature to discuss this point nor convinced that they are—
but it is a mistaken prejudice to reject such accounts a priori as too
trivial or undignified to be ascribed to the inhabitants of another
world. Owing, no doubt, to the unduly tragic view we have come to
take of death, the prejudice that the decease of Brown, Jones and
Robinson must instantly transmute them into beings of superhuman
powers and tastes, and transport them into regions where they are
initiated into the uttermost ecstasies and agonies of the scheme of
things, has become almost universal. Indeed, I have often been
amused to see how strongly this notion influences people who are really
entire disbelievers in the possibility of any future life ; while scorning
everything ' supernatural,' they reject the spiritist's version thereof as
not supernatural enough, because they are quite sure that if there were
a future life at all, it would have to be as full of angels and demons
as what they would call ' the traditional mythologies.' In a more
respectable form the same feeling shows itself in the large number of
persons who refuse to accept the evidence, e.g., in the Piper case,
because they do not like the sort of life to which it seems to point.
This may seem a somewhat naive ignoratio elenchi, but the psychical
researcher can hardly afford to smile at it, for he is continually having
it impressed upon him how very serious are the obstacles which pre
judices of this sort form to the discovery and recognition of the facts,
and how manifestly the ' will to believe ' is the ratio cognoscendi of
truth. Hence a systematic challenge of the whole assumption that
another world must be as different as is conceivable (or rather incon
ceivable) from this, may serve to clear the atmosphere.
And inasmuch as the groundlessness of a false assumption is never
revealed more clearly than by a request for the reasons on which it
rests, I should like, for my own part, to add to the general challenge
a particular request, asking philosophers to show cause why a hypo
thetical ' other ' world must necessarily be conceived as out of time
and out of space. The conviction that this must be so underlies, I
am sure, much of the high philosophic scorn of empirical spiritism and
popular theology, but I do not think it would be easy to support it by
a valid and cogent philosophic argument. For so long as temporality
and spatiality form indispensable characteristics of the only world we
experience, the presumption surely is that they will pervade also any
other, until at least a definite method has been suggested whereby
they may be transcended.
(3) Thirdly, it must be recognised that the methodological principle
of interpreting the unknown by the known tells strongly in favour of
the simpler, and prhnd facie easier, theory of the agency of personal
spirits as against the more complex and unfamiliar notions of an
impersonal clairvoyance, or subliminal consciousness, or non-human
58 F. C. S. Schiller. [PaRT
modes of cognition by gods, devils or cosmic principles of a more or
less unknowable kind. I am very far from thinking that we should in
such matters hastily commit ourselves to the interpretation which
primd facie seems the most plausible, or, indeed, to any definitive
theory whatsoever, and I should be sorry to see the ingenious attempts
to provide a non-spiritistic explanation of the phenomena in question
prematurely abandoned—if only on account of their excellence as
mental gymnastics—but I cannot admit that such attempts are one
whit less anthropomorphic in principle than the ' spiritist ' hypothesis
(they only stray further from their human model), while I cannot help
admitting that methodologically they are more cumbrous and so
considerably inferior.
Admitting, therefore, that as a working theory the hypothesis of
the persistence after death of what we call the human personality
possesses considerable advantages over rival theories, let us inquire
further by what methods, resting on what postulates, that theory may
be verified.
(1) We may rule out once more the notion that such a future life
is essentially supernatural in character. This notion has been a
favourite with believers, but it is easily turned into a terrible weapon
in the hands of their adversaries. For the supernatural is, as such,
incapable of investigation, and belief in it must be mere faith, exposed
to every doubt and jeer, if, indeed, it can be even that, seeing that
a real faith must be nourished by at least partial and prospective
verification in fact. Hence the answer to this notion is simply this :
that if the future life be really ' supernatural ' in the sense of having
no connection of any sort with nature, there could not possibly he any
evidence of it, and it would have to be for us non-existent ; while if
there be evidence of it, this would ipso facto include it in the widest
conception of nature, and render the nature of the connection between
this world and the next a legitimate subject for scientific research.
If, therefore, the connection be rare and precarious, the reason cannot
possibly be that from time to time some audacious spirit has impiously
achieved the impossible by breaking through the natural order ; it
must be in the peculiarities of the natural order itself. Or, to sum up
in a single phrase a discussion which would long have become needless
but for the persistence of attempts to dispose of an inconvenient
investigation of facts by logical quibbles about words, if ' supernature '
is to be retained, it must not be in the sense of something alien and
hostile to ' nature,' but strictly as meaning a higher department or
aspect of nature itself.
(2) We must suppose a certain continuity of psychological con
stitution in the human spirit throughout every phase of its existence.
This does not imply that death may not be a great event, involving a
xxxvi.] On Some Philosophic Assumptions. 59
great gain (or loss) in the intensity and extent of consciousness and
memory ; it asserts only that if we are to have knowledge of a future
life at all, we must assume that the general characteristics of mental
life will persist. "Without this there could be no proof of ' spirit-
identity ' ; without ' spirit-identity ' there could be no proof of a
future life. Unfortunately, however, this assumption of ours would
lead us to expect that the proof of 'spirit identity ' would be difficult.
For it is psychologically far more probable that the moral character
and the feelings would traverse the shock and change of death
unshaken, than that little bits of knowledge about terrestrial affairs
would persist in equal measure. Yet it is these latter that afford the
best tests of ' spirit-identity.'
(3) As we must try to explain all the facts by principles already
known to be valid, we must account for the remarkable dissociation
between this world and the next by the principle of psychological
continuity. That such dissociation must exist will hardly be denied by
any one who has realised how very rare an experience a 'ghost' is, even
with the most expert of ghost seers and in its most favoured haunts.
But it would seem that if the departed still retained their personality
and psychical continuity, ' ghosts ' ought to be more plentiful than
blackberries, and unhedged by that divinity which makes people so
reluctant to make a clean breast of their ghost stories. Primd facie,
therefore, it requires explanation that in spite of psychic continuity so
much dissociation should prevail.
Nevertheless it may, I think, be shown that the assumption of
psychical continuity would be quite compatible with the prevalence
of an almost complete dissociation between this world and the next.
For any. great event tends to dissociate us from our past, and this
would apply a fortiori to an event like death, which ex hypothesi
launches us into a new world. A new world, moreover, would
engross us not only by its novelty, but also by the practical need of
accommodating ourselves to new conditions of existence. Hence the
psychological conditions for great concern about the world we had left
behind us would hardly be present. This argument, moreover, could
be considerably strengthened by psychological observations with
regard to the interest which is taken in the affairs of our world by
the aged. For it would be unlikely that an interest which had
already grown faint should effectively maintain itself amid the dis
tractions of a new life.
And even if the desire to communicate were felt, it could hardly be
assumed that the knowledge and power to do so would at once be at
the disposal of the new-comer, who, for aught we know, might find
that, as upon his entry upon this scene, a period of helplessness and
dependence analogous to infancy had to be passed through.
GO F. C. S. Schiller. [part
It would seem probable, therefore, that to render communication
effective, quite as systematic and sustained an effort would be needed
on the other side as is being made by the S.P.R. on this, while the
self-regarding motives for making it would be indefinitely less potent.
For while each of us ought to Aaw1 a strong personal interest in deter
mining what his prospects may be after death, no such case could be
made out for a retrospective interest of the departed in our world.
And in their world the prevalent sentiment might esteem it better to
leave us in our present doubt and discourage attempts to pry into the
possibilities of communication with another world still more strongly
and sincerely than the majority of us do now. This, indeed, will
appear the more probable when we remember that, according to the
principle of psychic continuity, the same, people will be making the
.same sentiment in both cases. Nevertheless, it is conceivable that some
day a fortunate coincidence of the efforts of an infinitesimal minority
on both sides should succeed in establishing spirit-identity and forcing
upon the reluctant masses of men the scientific fact of a future life
which they did not in the least desire to have so established. Even
then, however, we should still be very far from any definite and
detailed knowledge of the nature of the future life in itself, the
difficulties of transmitting which would increase enormously in pro
portion as the dissociation between the two spheres of existence
became greater.
Thus the general upshot of our discussion so far would be that a
future life which was accessible to scientific methods of proof would
necessarily appear to be of a somewhat homely and humdrum character.
Broadly speaking, our conceptions of it would rest on the assumption of
social and psychic continuity, and they would tend to suppose that the
reward and punishment of the soul consisted mainly in its continuing
to be itself, with its true nature revealed more and more clearly to
itself and others. Hence there would be but little room for epic flights
of a lurid imagination, and those who hanker after the ecstasies of the
blessed and the torments of the damned would have to go, as before,
to the preachers and the poets. We may, however, trust these latter
to work up a more copious material into pictures quite as edifying and
thrilling as those of Homer, Dante and Milton.
I have assumed hitherto, without a hint of doubt, the general
possibility of the conception of a future life. But, after all, this also
is an assumption, of a very vital character, and one which has been
strongly impugned on a priori grounds. I shall devote, therefore, my
1 I emphasise the 'ought,' for, as a matter of empirical fact, the present number
of those who are scientifically interested in the question to the extent of a guinea per
annum appears to be about 1500 !
xxxvi.] On Some Philosophic Assumptions. 61
concluding remarks to disposing of such philosophic attempts at an
a priori suppression of the question and to stating some of the
philosophic considerations which lead me to think the conception of
a future life a valid and non-contradictory one, whether or not we
can find empirical evidence of its actual existence. On the first point
I may be brief : 1 should not deny that it is possible to devise meta
physical systems which will render the persistence of the individual
consciousness improbable and even impossible, and which consequently
close the question to all who really believe them. Personally, I
believe those systems to be demonstrably wrong, but it is enough
for our purpose that they should be gratuitous, and that we may, at
least equally well, adopt metaphysical views which leave the question
open, or even lead us to regard a future life as a priori probable
enough, and needing only verification a posteriori.
Hence, speaking for myself—and in so personal a matter one must
speak for oneself if one wants to speak to the point—I cannot at all
appreciate the enormous antecedent difficulty which so many philo
sophers seem to feel about the conception of a future life. Even its
mast difficult implications, like, e.g., the transition from one world to
another, seem to become quite easy, if we start from the proper philo
sophic basis. Let us, for instance, assume—as I think we must do in
any case—the philosophic position of an idealistic experientialism.
I use this clumsy phrase to designate the view that ' the world ' is
primarily ' my experience,' plus (secondarily) the supplementings of
that experience which its nature renders it necessary to assume, such
as, e.g , other persons and a ' real ' material world. In that case the
world, in which we suppose ourselves to be, is, and always remains,
relative to the experience which we seek to interpret by it, and if that
experience were to change, so necessarily would our ' real ' world. Its
reality was guaranteed to it, so long as it did its work and explained
our experience ; it is abrogated so soon as it ceases to do so. Hence
we may conceive ourselves as passing through any number of worlds,
separated from each other by (partial) discontinuities in our experi
ence, each of which would be perfectly real while it lasted, and yet
would have to be declared unreal from a higher and clearer point
of view.
Nor would this conception remain an empty form, which we could
not find anything in our experience to illustrate. I venture to affirm
that we are all of us perfectly familiar with what it feels like to pass
from one world into another. When we fall asleep and dream, we pass
into a new world, the space, time, persons, and laws of which, tlwugh
they persist in principle, have no very obvious connection with the
corresponding characteristics of our waking life. It is true that the
reality of each dream-world is very precarious : it is dissolved by every
62 F. C. S. Schiller. [part
clumsy interruption from a more ' real ' world, in the ex post facto
judgment of which the dream-world is fleeting, chaotic, and un
manageable. Hence the consensus of common sense declares dream
experiences to be unreal—though, it may be noted, it has taken men
a long time to arrive at this conclusion and to disabuse themselves
of the notion that after all there must be a literally veridical and
inspired meaning in all their experiences. What has not been realised
with equal clearness—probably because the observation seemed to
have no direct practical bearing—is that the existence of unreal
worlds of dream-experience casts an indelible slur on the claim of
our present waking life to absolute reality. What has happened once
may happen again, and when we wake to another world our terrestrial
life may appear as grotesque a parody, as misleading a distortion, of
true reality as the most preposterous of dreams.
Now this, which may be regarded as an awakening of the soul from
the point of view of the subject of the experience, is at the same time
the dissolution of his dream-world and life. That is, from the point
of view of the beings that interacted with him in that world and life—
supposing, of course, that his ' unreal ' experience was, as even dreams
are, veridical to some extent—it is his withdrawal, his death. Hence
the " paradoxes about death " which I have already had the honour of
propounding to the members of the S.P.R.,1 and to which I am now
trying to supply a sort of commentary. " No man ever yet perished
without annihilating also the world in which he lived," i.e., the world of
his experience, or as we may perhaps say with still more accuracy, the
objective world, in so far as it was assumed to explain his experience.
Moreover " no man ever yet saw another die, but if he had he
would have witnessed his own annihilation " : inasmuch as he could
never see the other's self and so a fortiori could not observe its
destruction ; what he saw was the ' death ' of a ' body ' which was
merely a phenomenon in his own world of experience. But if,
per impossibUe, he could have witnessed the destruction of the
subject of a world of experience, his own destruction, as a phe
nomenon in such a world, would have been included in the
catastrophe. Thus both these paradoxes are designed to bring
out the essential and incurable philosophical ambiguity of ' death.' -
Death is not the same thing for him who experiences and for him who
witnesses it. It forms the limiting case which involves the breakdown
of the great social convention, whereby we postulate (for practical
purposes) a common world which is experienced by us all.3 Even
i In the S.P.R. Journal for March, 1898, Vol. VIII., p. 204.

xxxvi.] 0)1 Some Philosophic Assumptions. 63
during life that convention is maintained only at the cost of excluding
from reality all such experiences as are personal, or divergent, or
incapable of forming a basis for common action. At death it breaks
down altogether, and the long suppressed divergence between the
world of 'my ' experience and the 'objective' world, which is nobody's
experience but is supposed to account for everybody's, dominates the
situation.
When a man dies his relation to the common world apparently
ceases,1 but for what reason we cannot say. It may be that he has
ceased to be ; it may also be that he has ceased to interact with us—-
until we also have followed his example. Similarly when we witness
a death, all that we can safely and scientifically say is that a peculiar
feature in our experience which impelled us to assume a self-conscious
spirit, analogous to our own, in order to account for the behaviour of
the complex of phenomena we called the body of our fellow man, has
undergone a change such that the behaviour of his ' body ' no longer
warrants the inference of the presence of his ' spirit.' Again, the
reason may be that the spirit is destroyed, or that it has ceased to
animate the ' body.' Thus it would seem as though all that could be
affirmed for certain about death was that it was a disruption of the
common world in which spirits acted together ; what else or what
more it was would remain in doubt—the spirit may have perished or
it may have 'passed away.'
Thus, so far as philosophy can determine, it would seem as if the
chances of destruction and survival were exactly equal and that we
were doomed to doubt for ever. Nevertheless, considerations may
be adduced which must add decisively to the weight of the latter
alternative. For it should be noted that the two alternatives are
not equally well situated with respect to empirical evidence. No
conceivable empirical evidence can suffice to establish the destruction
of the soul at death, because none can even be relevant to the issue.
For it can only concern appearances in the common world of the
suTvivors, it can only prove that the rupture of connection with it
at death is utter and entire. But that is not enough. A scientific
proof, therefore, of the annihilation of the soul is rigorously im
possible. On the other hand, there is no such intrinsic impossibility
about a scientific proof of the persistence of consciousness through
death ; there is, in fact, no particular difficulty about conceiving
empirical evidence sufficient to establish this doctrine with as high a
degree of certainty as we have for any of our beliefs as to matters of
fact. The whole difficulty consists in getting the evidence. If we had
1 " To die is to cut off our connection with our friends ; but do they cut us, or we
them, or both, or neither?"—Ibid., p. 205.
64 F. C. 8. Schiller. [pakt
succeeded, all we should need to do would be to modify our original
assumption that death meant. an absolute rupture of relations, an utter
dissolution of the common world. We should have to say instead, that
death altered the mode of communication of spirit with spirit, render
ing it different and difficult without interrupting it altogether. But,
properly interpreted and manipulated, the common world would
persist through death. What exactly would be the nature of the
common world, thus extended to include a life after death, philosophy
could not, of course, forecast ; that would remain a question for
positive research to determine.
Hence it is manifest that I have reached a point at which the
philosopher must modestly stand aside ; he can reassure the psychical
researcher that no a priori impossibilities block his way and that no
authentic fact can be too anomalous to be explained ; he can clear his
eyes of the prejudices which obstruct a clear vision of the goal, but its
actual achievement must be the reward of the courage and endurance
of the empirical researcher who fights his way to it step by step through
thickets of complex and perplexing fact, and barbed-wire entangle
ments of hostile human prejudice.

SUPPLEMENT.
A STUDY IN SPIRITISTIC HALLUCINATIONS.
By Professor Harlow Gale.
Dr. E. S. was a physician in St. Paul, Minn, with a special reputation
for success in diphtheria, a graduate in 1872 of Trinity College, Hartford,
and of Rush Medical College, Chicago ; an unusually vigorous, decisive, and
intelligent man. He was a disbeliever in religion and somewhat offensively
so. He became associated with people below his own intellectual and social
grade, but not to the vicious extent which he was subsequently fond of
exaggerating. When thus about 45 years of age, with grey hair and beard,
and still a bachelor, he experienced in 1894 a sudden and dramatic conversion
to "Christian Spiritualism." Ho then gave up all practice and interest in
his profession and in the real estate business to which he had chiefly given
his time for several years, and devoted himself with intense single-
mindedness and enthusiasm solely to the propagation of this faith. With a
small independent income, he did not make it a money business nor himself
a professional, but in shabby clothes and with the barest necessities of life
he gathered a little group of converts about him. His time was occupied in
visiting these friends, studying his Bible and reading, and holding meetings
three times a week in his room in a business block.
In about two years he came into communication1 with Dr. Hodgson, to
whom he described himself and his work in the following characteristic
letter :—
329|, Jackson Street, St. Paul, Minn., May 7th, 1896.
(Dr.) (I presume you do not care for title) Richard Hodgson,

My dear Doctor :—Your esteemed favour of the 5th inst. duly received.
In reply will try to be brief. In the first place I wish to avoid all unnecessary
notoriety. It will be impossible to condense more than two years' extensive
experiences, and the accounts of hundreds of meetings, into a single letter.

for them, will—D.V.—receive some interesting communications, upon my assurance
of such being welcome from me, and of more definite knowledge of your address.
Youre, Dr. E. S.
66 Professor Harlow Gale. [Supplement.
Medical College i all1 a graduate of an Eastern Institution ; am now forty
odd years of age ; brought up a Christian, but from certain disbeliefs and
teachings of the so-called churches, I became, if not an infidel—I think,
while by no means an atheist, I was an infidel in belief, and certainly in
practice and life—but heard voices onco and a while, and saw clairvoyantly,
but did not understand these manifestations, [nor] try to bother with them,
and while they lasted—" annoyed me" as I used to think—I fancied I was
on the verge of insanity : finally I attended a spiritualist meeting with much
cowardice and shamefacedness, saw what they called, and what I now know
were materialisations, and could get when alone table rappings, table-
tippings, and see clairvoyantly. But the table rappings and table-tippings
did not continue long. I finally met a business-man, who was a friend, and
he reluctantly told me he had seen Our Saviour many times, and that he saw
and communicated with his late wife by asking God, Our Father, in the
name of Jesus Christ, if he might be permitted to do so. His late wife was
a devout Christian. I shook hands with him and said I would try it that
night. I wanted to see my mother whose body had been buried many years
before. I prayed The Father, in the name of Jesus Christ, if it was in
accordance with His Will, not to her injury, peace or discomfort, and for my
good, that I might see my mother. I was all alone in my then bed-room,
doors locked. I saw her immediately, fully recognised her and was very
thankful for the vision. Then I asked God in Christ Jesus' name to let me
know the truth as He willed, notwithstanding my former infidelity, so-called
science, lies of priests, preachers, or myself, or any other sources of errors.
I began to see more clairvoyantly ; in daylight, and to write automatically,
and these matters were often (or rather never found not to be true) proven
true, with reference to past events or future events. Never once untrue ;
often true. I began holding private meetings with my clairvoyant friend,
who had for over twenty years, at different times, seen Jesus Christ. At
first we did not see Him ; but our own friends, and many of the departed
members of our families came, and gradually brought, introduced, and made
us acquainted with persons of hundreds, nay, thousands of years previously
existent in the flesh. They talked, my friend could hear and distinguish
their different voices, etc. Finally the Master came, and has come very
often to our meetings now for over six months. He has cured one man who
tells me he has been "doctored" for over ten years for progressive loco
motor-ataxia, and by many physicians. I have taken the Master by His
substantial Spiritual Hand, hear Him talk to me often, and hear many others.
Now the Master has now been seen by twelve different people ; some have
seen Him many times. We are informed comparatively few will see Him
before He comes at the beginning of the reign of a thousand years, which
coming, we believe and have been informed, would be a spiritual coming, at
least, to the hearts and minds of human beings. We use no curtain. The
Master forbids it. We gather to worship Him, have seen Him accompanied
by the Blessed Virgin, Mary Magdalene, Martha, Lazarus, all the Apostles
and many, many others. Several times by angels (who never were in the
flesh), His messengers. The man whom he cured was cured instantly,
nothing was said by the Master about curing him. When the man went
away from the meeting he could walk as well as ever, and had no pain.
Part xxxvi.] A Study in Spiritistic Hallucinations. 67
Four besides himself were at the meeting ; the cured man and myself only
saw the Master. The Master spoke briefly to me ; some timo to this man,
who said he heard Him, saw Him, and felt Him, and His hands. I saw and
heard Him. The four present (besides the sick man) felt the sick man,
who while mentally happy, was wet and cold. A Dr. Dunlap has seen The
Master and others, —Abraham Lincoln one of them—at our meetings. He
only saw the Master once, and briefly. Some of us have seen the Master
very many times, and for—sometimes—not only half-an-hour, but even an
hour, or more, at the time. One Jewish gentleman has seen him when alone,
once in a town-place of business— in Minn., recently while in New Haven,
Conn., and yesterday while with me. I and two others have seen the
Master in the clouds of Heaven (seemingly to me, very near me) ; and not
to me for a few minutes, but for a long while, He followed me. It was a
glorious sight. He has unlocked doors for me. He reveals himself not to
all whom I wish. My wishes seem to have no control over who may see
Him, or what shall occur, or whom He may bring with Him. Many self-
righteous, of course, call me insane. I rejoice, remembering His words, but
am sorry for their ignorance. Subliminal consciousness, etc., and such
theories I am fully aware of. I can only say they do not work with me, or
any one else so far as I can judge, at our meetings. Now I have only given
you a very briof outline of what would require volumes to tell, in order, and
with details. Perfect sequence of occurrences has not been followed. Tried
to get man to write out an account of his sickness, and cure ; but cannot
prevail upon him so far. He will tell those who do not approach him "with
a jostling air " generally. He is more than ordinarily intelligent. Was
not what is called "a religious man" previous to my talking to him about
Christian Spiritualism. I feel the spirits, have heard them sing wonderful
music—two electric lights burning at the time, —had them take hold of me
forcibly indeed ; this and singing when alone ; not expecting anything of the
kind. Have seen the Dear Lord and heard Him speak, while He manifested
Himself both as the Saviour, The Infant Saviour, The Father and The Holy
Spirit. As the Saviour He comes in a brown robe, as The Father in a
wonderful blue robe, as The Holy Spirit in still more wonderful and
dazzling white robe. Often in all ways, with a golden crown upon, or high
in the air above His head. I will enclose a card which explains itself. He
often says ' ' The time of my coming to the whole world is near at hand. " "To
do what we can to prepare the world for His coming." After speaking to mo
I generally ask Him to give some mark of approval or disapproval to what I
say He has just said to me. He generally approves by gently bowing His
Head, or that and moving the hands. Once He added to another person
something additional. Excuse haste. — Yours, etc., ™ ci
1 Two long letters of ten foolscap pages together were written to Mr. Hodgson on
two successive days in August 1896, though Dr. S. apologised for his haste and
having been too busy to write before. In these he described more in detail the
materialisations of Christ to him, specially His clasping him tightly about the neck,
his holding St. John upon his breast as the Master had done at the last supper, and
enumerated other personages visible to him and some of his friends as Dante, Beatrice,
Hypatia, Julius Ciesar, Pontius Pilate, Lincoln, Hancock, Garfield, Admiral Poote,

This letter was sent by Mr. Hodgson to me to interview Dr. S. I thus
found him in June, 1896 ; and in a long interview, which he could with
difficulty end, went over the above events in more detail. He invited me to
of his phenomena. " I cannot find people with brains, sufficient knowledge, truth,
and leisure, and with the heart and disposition to investigate with me as 1 would, and
do most earnestly wish these great and wonderful manifestations should be investigated.
The so-called Christians are too much in the dark, too ignorant, or too indifferent.
And the infidels do not believe in Jesus Christ's divinity, and therefore they never
can, even though ahle clairvoyants often, see Him at all, or even his more noted
Saints." "O for intelligent, pure-minded, pure devoted, capable, and disinterested
fellow helpers and investigators ; who do not wish notoriety, nor seek selfish aims, and
who could afford and would devote the time to obtaining the results."

join his circle, gave me the names of ten persons who had seen Christ at his
meetings, and kindly started me off alone on a trip to interview these
persons. The following notes of a seance will give a fair sample of his
methods and results. Though he usually held his meetings at his own room,
he occasionally did at the homes of his friends, and this one was held at the
house of Mrs. F. B., who had lately become a professional Clairvoyant and
Healing Medium.
" 633, Cedar-street, St. Paul, Sunday evening, June 7th, 1896.
"Thirteen persons present, including Mrs. Gale and myself. A covered
lamp gave light enough for one to distinguish men from women in the circle,
but not features. Dr. S. sat in an arm-chair about four feet from the ends
of the circle in front of a pair of brown portieres, covering a double door.
He did not at any time appear to be in a trance condition, sat upright with
his hands on the arms of the chair, and his outline at least was visible to us
during the entire meeting. He offered prayer and there was frequent
singing interspersed during the evening. Several times he urged the sitters
who saw anything at all to speak of it, and he occasionally asked different
persons if they did not see this or that. After some waiting and silence Dr.
S. said, 'The Master is here on either side.' Mrs. B. said, ' I see Him in a
brown robe, He is blessing us.' Dr. S. : Tm so glad you said that, for I
felt He was blessing us.' Then Dr. S. gave a disconnected religious talk
which he said the Master gave through him. He then announced General
Grant as there for Capt. S., but Capt. S. did not see him, though he had
seen him living. The General then purported to talk through Dr. S.,
referrini; to the ' Little Vedas.' Mrs. B. said she saw him in his uniform
with bright buttons, and added that Henry Ward Beecher was there by Dr.
S's. side and with a book in his hand. But Dr. S. said, ' Yes, but I am not
through with General Grant yet.' Beecher, however, also gave a talk about
the Virgin Mary, etc., in a disjointed way, quite unlike his natural flowing
eloquence. Dr. S. said, ' What is back of me on the curtain ? ' Mrs. B.
'Across,' and through suggestions from Dr. S. allowed it was white and
about two feet high. Asked if there wasn't something at the foot of it, Mrs.
B. piped up, ' Mary Magdalene.' Discussion between them about the hair,
which had 'tawny lights in dark brown' to Dr. S., but to Mrs. B. was
' dark brown and shiny all around.'
"Dr. S. saw a bunch of flowers behind Dr. D. and said they were coming
nearer him, whereat Mrs. B. saw a whole bushel full of flowers on the floor
in front of Dr. S. Mrs. W., next to the place where the flowers were
described, said she smelled them ; Mrs. B. then also did and called them
• white roses.' One other lady thought that possibly she smelled them, but
Dr. S. did not and no one else.
"The light was now nearly all put out, though patches of light came
through the blinds on to the wall and curtain back of Dr. S., and other
streaks under and through the cracks in the door behind him. Dr. S. then
saw a high back chair in the corner of the room by Dr. D. and with peacock
feathers about it. Mrs. B. then described an Indian man, large and massive,
with pompous look, and called him Pocahontas. Dr. S. asked if he wanted
to talk and Mrs. B. said, ' Yes, he nods with his head.' This she usually
said for the advent or departure of each figure. The Indian then made
70 Professor Harlow Gale. .[Supplement.
through Dr. S. a long tirade against FitzIIugh Lee, (as they finally made
out with the help of Capt. S.) for murdering an Indian and fleeing to Cuba.
Capt. S. then suggested that the real Pocahontas was a girl, and a young
man sitter sustained this fact. Dr. S. came to the rescue of Mrs. B. by
saying he 'got it as a man,' etc. Much exhaustion came upon Dr. S. after
this Pocahontas epfsode, which had lasted some time, and he asked Mrs. B.
to describe St. Peter, who was there. So Mrs. B. said he had ' white hair,
brown beard, shaggy eyebrows, somewhat bald, and high forehead ' ; Dr. S.
explaining the brown beard through his growing younger in the spirit
world ! He made a speech through Dr. S. in which he promised to appear
to us all in our homes, especially to Capt. and Mrs. S. An Indian girl, 'Red
Clover,' was then announced, daughter of 'White Feather' and other
pedigree. ' Dear Red Clover ' was a great favourite, and on Dr. S's suggestion
shook hands with Mrs. W., so that Mrs. W. exclaimed, 'Why, I believe I
almost see her.' She also made a speech through Dr. S., who thanked her
for having cured a sick woman lately through him. Dr. S. saw a lily over
between Dr. D. and Mrs. Gale. Dr. D. had a niece named Lily, who was
sick ; but Dr. S. insisted this belonged to Mrs. G. Mrs. B. also saw it ' as
tall as Mrs. G.' Then followed much discussion as to the symbolical mean
ing of this lily. It was decided that it was a message from some one,
perhaps Mrs. G.'s mother. But, after much fishing about and finding from
Dr. D.'s direct question that Mrs. G.'s mother was not in the spirit world,
Mrs. B. echoed Dr. S.'s suggestion .of its being from an aunt (which was
possible). Then with relief Dr. S. laughed and said he saw a turnip with
the lily. Mrs. B. allowed she saw something 'round, long, and red on top.'
Then followed a long discussion in which the lily and turnip were finally
interpreted to mean that there was a difference of religious opinion between
Mrs. G. and the departed aunt, in which Mrs. G. must get rid of some
Unitarian tendencies. (It came out in some later conversations that this
association of Unitarianism with Mrs. G. had been gained through a
newspaper notice of the singing of my cousin, Miss Gale, in the Unitarian
Church in St. Paul.) Dr. S. then asked Mrs. G. if she was not con
nected with Universalists or Unitarians, but was disappointed to find her
a heathen.
"The Master was again announced, Dr. S. explaining that he sometimes
sees the figures behind him, 'through the back of his head.' He explained
the Pocahontas mistake by her name being confused with the real one of
Powhatan. He instanced another mistake which once occurred when a Mr.
Taylor's father was given as dead, but when found living was given as
' spiritually dead,' adding 'S. could not help it—it upset S.'
" Dr. S. laughed again in apparent relief and said he saw a cow and a lot
of calves there, but no explanations were offered. Coming back to Mrs. G.,
Dr. S. told her that if she ' only got rid of some little things and in fact of
some big things, and kept at it, she would be able to see and develop.'
Then followed a rambling talk about a Saracen, ' Pinoalto, ' with some
prophecy. Finally Dr. S. asked Mrs. B. if she saw something on his head,
and she saw a wreath of flowers. The meaning of this was not enlarged
upon. The meeting broke up and ended in a general conversation. Capt.
S. asked Dr. S. if he should pay Mrs. B. anything and he replied, 'Just as
Part xxxvi] A Study in Spiritistic Hallucinations. 71
you please. It is not necessary, but, if you feel like it, it will help her
out.' Whereat Capt. S. paid her one dollar, but no one else seemed to
give anything."
During the evening, as always in his conversations, Dr. S. made frequent
reference to his own disinterestedness, aversion to notoriety or even publicity,
and showed a naive pride in his position as a non-professional medium of
such revelations to his grateful friends.
Aside from the alleged clairvoyant perceptions of sight, hearing, touch,
and smell, described by Dr. S. and Mrs. B., the only other persons
confessing any were the case of flower-odour by Mrs. W. and possibly another
lady, the doubtful touch of a hand by Mrs. W. and a confession from Dr. D.
— extorted after repeated urgent suggestions by Dr. S. —that he saw a light
on the curtain which might possibly be a head. Mrs. Gale and I saw nothing
except the streaks and patches of light which came through the blinds and
cracks, and the changing coloured patches of the retina's own light projected
on the wall or curtain. These latter we could of course see just as well with
the eyes closed. The alleged perceptions then were not objective as in the
ordinary materialisation seance, where every one present can see something
in common, however much the objective sense perception may be variously
enlarged by illusions.
In an interview three days after this meeting Dr. S. explained that in his
experience so far the figures had maintained about the same degree of reality,
i.e. "etherialisation," and only "materialisation" when seized by the hand.
He considered the former the higher manifestation, though that began with
him, and yet he desired somewhat, —and his followers still more— the latter
form. To my queries, he had not made direct experiments of seeing the
figures with the eyes closed, but believed he could and did, and described
again seeing behind him "through the back of his head.'' About darkness,
it only makes the colours brighter, otherwise he could see as well in good
light, which they sometimes had in their meetings. Walking with me in
bright daylight through the crowded business streets he would describe,
in pauses between his greetings to his many acquaintances, the figures in the
air before and behind us and which were accompanying him. In all these
communications from the spirits Dr. S. showed great earnestness and
sincerity, in spite of somo levity and a good deal of common-placeness quite
below the normal level of his intelligence and conversation.
"In the second meeting at which we were present on a Monday evening
in June, 1896, in Dr. S.'s own room, there was more seriousness. Here Dr.
S. sat nearer in our small circle of only eight persons and with a background
of a large black cloth on the wall behind him. Though he turned off the
electric light in his room, it was at no time completely dark, for various
streaks and patches of light came through the blinds and transom. After
the Master, as usual, appeared ' a little Italian girl playing a harp,' a
Jewish girl for a Mr. Lazarus, Zacchieus for quite a stay, and then the Table
of the Lord's Supper was described by Dr. S. as before us and administered
spiritually, Mrs. B. indicating the position of the Master in his service
around the circle. Then 'Sophie,' Mr. A.'s wife, was announced, accom
panied by a historical Minnesota Indian squaw, 'Old Betz,' who brought
frogs' legs to Mr. A. as she had formerly done in real life. A dove
72 Professor Harlow Gale. [Supplement.
also brought herbs in an envelope to Mr. A. from his wife. Mr. A. was
greatly moved and welcomed her with great emotion, said she was with him
'every hour of the day and half of the night.' He kept asking Dr. S.
if she did not say something more, and Dr. S. described her as looking like
a beautiful young girl of fifteen, at which age Mr. A. had a photograph of
her. Though Mr. A. did not see her, he said he felt her all down his arm
and knew that she was there. Then Mrs. B. described, as standing behind
me, a tall, thin-faced, black-coated man, who, with a note-book, was taking a
record of the meeting. He could not reveal his identity till I became a
believer, which would surely happen if I kept searching and came to know
the truth.
"In this circle Mr. A. was the only one who saw anything outside of Dr.
S. and Mrs. B. For though Mr. A. did not see his wife, he said he saw two-
figures described near Mr. Lazarus, the figure behind me, some flowers, and
the ' Master as a child ' back of Dr. S. At the beginning of the meeting,
however, Dr. S. was disappointed that Mr. A. did not see and moved his
seat to the middle of the circle. Dr. S. made great efforts in vain with Mr.
Lazarus, who had formerly confessed to having seen something, and once
had him come up and hold his (Dr. S.'s) hands. In addition to the stray
lights entering the room and the retina's projected light I could also see
after long fixation a light boundary contrast about Dr. S.'s head. On my
describing this in response to Dr. S.'s frequent questioning of each of us,
they took this as a great confession and were enthusiastic for my develop
ment, which Mrs. B. thought might possibly come in a year, or even in six
months, though her own had required nine years. Dr. S.'s last words to
us were characteristic of much talk during the evening as always, —'Don't
think S. a saint—I wish he were one.' "
On again joining the circle ten months later, in April, 1897, I found
much the same group of devoted friends and enthusiastic disciples in various
grades of " development." The aged Dr. D. saw a great deal, and though
"Sophie " did not come to Mr. A. he groaned in joy and said the meetings
were getting better and better. Methuselah appeared opportunely for Dr.
S. to ask if he really lived to be 969 years old, and on his nodding assent Dr.
S. explained, with the confidence of authority, how some St. Paul clergymen
had tried to bring his age within our historical limits by a new explanation
of the ancient Hebrew system of reckoning time. A beautiful and
intellectual Babylonian female figure was described by Dr. S. near me, and I
was told to rise, wipe my hand, and she would take it. Dr. S. and Mrs. B.
said she did, and my negative confession did not prevent their talking much
about it. More theological metaphysics had grown up during the past year,
"the infant word " e.g. being quite a puzzle to the newer disciples. On my
student companion mildly suggesting that perhaps imagination had something
to do with the appearances, Dr. S., was warmly indignant, gave him a long
talk, seized his head violently with both hands and asked if that was
imagination, for so they came to him.
During these meetings there was never any appearance of effort at, or
opportunity for, deception ; but in December, 1890, an interesting opportunity
occurred to test Dr. S.'s faith and honesty. During a two-and-a-half hours'
Hart xxxvi.] A Study in Spiritistic Hallucinations. 73
interview I chanced to show him some alleged spirit photographs of Mumler,
Boston, which I had just got from one of the best known photographers in
St. Paul, and though he had never seen any before he did not show much
interest in them. But he immediately suggested that I wrap up some photo
graphic plates in black paper, enclose them in a box, seal it securely, and the
Master had given him to understand that if left with him eight hours he
could perhaps get a photograph of the Master. So the next day when alone
in a dark room of my laboratory, I wrapped two 4 by 5 plates in three layers
of black paper and two layers of black cloth, tied them with a string and
sealed the knots, packed these in a plate box, sealed its four corners, put
this in the outside cover, sealed a string around the whole, took drawings of
all these strings and seals, and took this package to him in the forenoon.
I offered to come later in the day and develop the plates after the eight hour
limit, but he now wanted to keep them over night. So two days later we
met, went to the dark room of Zimmerman Bros., well known dealers in
photograph materials, and developed the plates with hydrochinon. He had
expressed much anxiety that the box should not go into any other person's
hands and that I, with him alone present, should develop the plates.
Nothing came upon the first plate with ten minutes' development, though we
examined it frequently, and nothing on the second plate after fifteen minutes'
development. Dr. S., standing by, asked many questions and seemed in
ignorance of the process. He was very much disappointed, and said that the
Master told him just then—as he stood iu a listening attitude—that we must
try it again and keep at it, for "according to your faith shall it be unto you. "
Finally after the Hypo bath Dr. S. spied something on the first plate, an
irregular patch about an inch in diameter, and said it was a face. The longer
he looked at it, the more certain he became, till after a few moments he pointed
out—on my asking—the nose, chin, beard, and long hair, as he had described
them. On taking the plate out into the cellar for better light he called an
electric light repairer, who, on the Doctor's suggestion, admitted it was a
face. But on Mr. Zimmerman being appealed to, he said there was nothing, it
looked like a plate which had not been exposed. And on the Doctor's calling
his attention to this face in the corner, he wiped the plate on the back side
and the "face" disappeared with the dirt and water. Somewhat chagrined
at this, the Doctor hurriedly left, while I washed the plates, dried them, and
still could find nothing on them. On taking all the wrappings with me and
carefully examining them, as I had of course not been able to do when I
opened the boxes and wrappings in his presence, I am very sure he had
made no attempt to open the box when in his possession.
A month later 1 told him I was ready for another trial, as he had proposed.
But his faith had somewhat weakened, for though he still expects some time
to get these material proofs, he considered it for the present premature and
a waste of time. I found later from Mr. Zimmerman that Dr. S. had
visited him after our failure, and his weakening of faith was evidently due
partly at least to Mr. Zimmerman's discouragement. However, toward the
end of our interview he wanted me to bring some plates as before and sit
■with them in my lap during a meeting, so as not to allow them out of my
possession. On my suggesting a camera as necessary, he thought that
would almost surely be successful. But as the main point of testing any
74 Professor Harlow Gale. [Supplement.
disposition toward trickery had been tried, it did not seem worth while to
continue these trials further.
As to any other physical or real evidence of the existence or presence of
his spirits, Dr. S. could not offer anything of evidential value. He asserted
that a door had been unlocked for him, showed me the door and explained
the conditions, but thoy were too uncertain to amount to anything. His few
alleged cases of the communication of past knowledge from the spirits were
not even reputable cases for telepathy. And though his prophecies were a
great source of pride to himself, they seemed to reveal nothing more than
could easily be accounted for by chance and the reproduction of his
knowledge as an oinuivorous reader of newspapers. (One day before his
departure I found him tearing up a great quantity of newspaper clippings
which he had collected in a large ledger.) The following prophecy printed
in the St. Paul DUpntch, dated and published August 12th, 1895, was
characteristic of his religious life and dealt with current newspaper topics.
" THE BRIGHT FUTURE.
" Which the Spirits Predict for the Favored North-West.
" Great Crops in Store.
"for the next three years there will be bountiful harvests to be
garnered in these states—twin cities will be united in the
name of st. paul—canals now projected will be actual facts,
and the great metropolis will teem with the commerce of a
WORLD.
" As long ago as last February the Dispatch printed a crop prediction,
furnished "by spirits" through the medium of a favored individual, which
has been verified with wonderful accuracy of detail. The spirits now furnish
another, a little more sweeping in its scope, which is appended:
"The first week in February, 1895, a Christian spirit was permitted by The
Master, to impart to certain people, assembled in The Name of the Master,
and worshipping Him, certain very important revelations about certain com
ing events, which prophecies have all been verified by the events having
taken place in the meantime. These prophecies given in February, 1895,
related to the great and bountiful crops, which would be given, and given to
the people of the Northwest by the Master this present year.
"Several persons can testify that very early in the season the February
prophecies were made known to them.
"There have lately been given more prophecies of still greater events
and importance to the people, particularly of the Northwest. They have been
given by the same Christian spirit, speaking in the name and by the power
of the Master, Christ Jesus, on Aug. 7, 1895. These prophecies, no
one, not disposed to believe, need believe. The persons to whom they have
been given do believe, and are thoroughly convinced that events related*
therein to come, will come, for they have proven these Christian spirits
many times, and in many matters of even far greater importance than those
Partxxxvi.] A Study in Spiritistic Hallucinations. 75
relating to material prosperity ; that is, the Divine Government of the entire
universe by God, our Heavenly Father, by the Divine Son, Jesus Christ,
Our Redeemer, the Master, and through the Master, the Holy Ghost, the
Spirit of Truth, the Comforter, the Holy Spirit of God, working on all good
spirits, whether in the spirit world, or still in the flesh. The prophecies
made Aug. 7, 1895, are briefly as follows :
"First—That the present crops in the three states of Minnesota, North
and South Dakota, all these prophecies are primarily related to the states
mentioned, are greater than any estimates yet made, and supposed to be
reliable by the general public. The crops for the next four years following
will be bountiful in these same three states, while crops in certain other
parts of the world during part of the same period will be less than the
average crops during ordinary years, excepting Illinois and Indiana, during
the next two years will bear the average crops. In other Northwestern
regions the crops will be also fair, but not so abundant as in these three
states.
"Thirdly —That a great waterway will be made within the next ten
years, and great ocean ships will land where Minneapolis now is.
" Fourthly—The next great change will be that the Twin Cities will
become one great city, and that (greatly enlarged), the united cities will be
called St. Paul, which will extend many more miles farther eastward and a
great many more miles westward ; that a great many towns will spring up
along the waterway from the lakes to the City of St. Paul.
" Fifthly—Other great events will be the great manufactories for manu
facturing and producing by electrical processes, iron and steel, which will
directly employ large numbers of men, and especially benefit millions of
people in the states of Minnesota, North and South Dakota. That the
State of Minnesota will increase in population very many hundreds of
thousands ; and that most of the now waste lands will be cultivated ; that
Minnesota will become one of the favored fruit growing sections, and that
the climate during the winter will become much warmer ; that great and large
boats will float in the Mississippi river, to what is now called Minneapolis,
from the South and from the Atlantic, through the Great Lakes to the then
City of St. Paul ; that ships from the South and ships from the North will
be locked up and down at the then City of St. Paul and other points neces
sary to the successful operation of this great waterway.
"There will be a great many large manufactories in successful operation
in the then City of St. Paul, particularly in rolling mills, and iron and steel
manufacture.
" These prophecies are of the true Christian spirits, who come in the
name of the Master, Jesus Christ, and in and by Him only.
"True Christian Spirits."
Over a year after these prophecies I heard him dispute very dogmatically
about them with a well-known business man to whom he was formerly family
physician. He once wanted mo to see our largest miller to tell him about
some kind of a dredge which could dig the river channel very easily, giving me
,exact details and figures as it had all been given him by the spirits.
76 Professor Harlow Gale. [Supplement.
After his conversion he despised his former profession and especially the
medicine, against which he could hardly say enough. But he seems
gradually to have come to heal through the alleged mediumship of spirits.
After one or more cases of partial relief to deafness, his first and still his
greatest case occurred in the spring of 1896 and is referred to in his letter
above. Mr. A., having been a railway conductor for fifteen years, bocame
afflicted with locomotor ataxia until he could only walk with difficulty by the
aid of a cane. He consulted the president of Rush Medical College, Chicago,
who gave him something for partial relief, but could not offer him any hope
of cure. Having left the railway and become the proprietor of a small hotel
in St. Paul, and with his lameness now about four years old, he attended
one of Dr. S's meetings. There he saw the Master approach him with out
stretched hands, felt the hands on his head, heard Him say something ending
with "rise and walk," at which he rose and walked off easily. During this
laying on of His hands he " felt as if burning up," in which condition Dr. S.
had all the ten persons present touch Mr. A. Though he is now slow in his
speech and movements, he has had no relapse, and as I have seen him several
times during the past two years and since shortly after his cure I can testify
that he walks without any dragging of the foot. He became an enthusiastic
Christian as well as Spiritualist, by far the most consistent and devoted of
Dr. S.'8 followers, and has "never ceased to thank the good Lord daily for
this miracle. "
At meetings since this Dr. S. would occasionally describe the "Master's
laying on of hands " for some one's betterment. He said that an Indian
spirit also had effected several cures at patients' homes. These healing*
increased until during his last year in St. Paul they occupied much of his
time. He had moved from his private room to an obscure office, and though
primarily for better quarters for his tri-weekly meetings, yet with his
medical library again set up and his plain door sign of Dr. E. S., he was in a
better situation for his spirit treatment. Thus one day in January, 1898, I
found a Mrs. W. there, who, after her testimony as to the spirits she had
seen, described the stomach trouble for which she had gotten relief from Dr.
S. as from no one else, though she had travelled about considerably. By
this time, however, he had returned somewhat to his regular medicine, for
in addition to the spirit treatment he also gave her a medical prescription.
As he impressively bade her good-bye, never expecting to see her again on
earth, she was greatly moved and could not sufficiently express her gratitude
to him for her bodily relief and religious awakening. Two of his later
patients I also interviewed. Mrs. Johnson, 106, East Fairfield Avenue,
West St. Paul, though she came to the door on crutches, claimed that she
had been greatly helped by Dr. S. in her long-standing rheumatism. She too
had the greatest gratitude for this relief and said he had stimulated her to
have more will power and courage. Frau Haase, on the River Flats, had
been a general invalid for seven years, especially with pains in her back.
Without any medicine Dr. S. had made her a new woman, and, though she
had some returns of pain, can now will them away herself. Similar cures
she now makes for her neighbours. Her gratitude to Dr. S. was unbounded,
and she showed a painful anxiety for his safety since his departuie. Almost
all his patients were women.
Part xxxvi i A Study in Spiritistic Hallucinations. 77
He had frequently spoken of his stay in St. Paul as being uncertain, said
that he might leave at any time, and showed many signs of unrest. Finally
in January, 1898, I found him really packing up to leave. Mingled with his
customary paradoxical and pseudo-humility talk, he gave as one of his reasons
for leaving that all his followers were too ignorant and he himself the only
scholar. He seemed discouraged at the slowness of his propagandism. Also
he complained to me for the first time of lack of financial support. The aged
Dr. D., a retired physician, he abused roundly as " too stingy to come " to
him more, though he never demanded money from him or any one. Mr. A.
was the only one who had given him money at his meetings, about two or
three dollars all together, and, as he himself said, " had been repaid a dozen-
fold." His patients gave him money or not, spontaneously, according to
their means. Some, as Mrs. J., insisted on paying him every visit ; others,
as a working girl, Miss C., paid for the medicine, in case he added any to
the spirit treatment. Others, as Frau H., could and did give him nothing.
But he felt imposed upon by some who could afford to give, but who did not.
Thus he was "not making his office rent," and in vigorously tearing up his
great collection of newspaper scraps, letters, and writings, he showed his
righteous and violent indignation. And it seems from his business agent, a
well-known lawyer, that there was much justification for this feeling ; for in
trying to help financially some of his followers, as well as owing to depressed
business conditions, he had gotten his property so tied up and his income
therefrom so reduced that he had to accept whatever any one offered him.
And though his habits of living were the simplest and cheapest, yet he is
described as being to some of his followers " generous to a fault." He would
tell no one but his agent where he was going, and though his friends inferred
to the Klondike, he has been reported as in Seattle, Wash.1 His absence
was to be for an indefinite time and very doubtful if he ever returned.
Thus in Lohengrin mystery and with evident consciousness of a mission to
perform, he left St. Paul in February, 1898, for some place "where he would
be very busy."
To judge of the nature of Dr. S. 's own spirits, it will be of much value to
first go over the testimony of his friends, as I gathered it in interviews and
notes at the time. Mrs. A. J. C, a widow about sixty, mother of one of the
highest legal officers of the state, had in June, 1896, seen Christ three times
in Dr. S.'s presence, once in his room and twice in different houses of his
friends. The figure appeared in vapoury grayish outline, as if about one
hundred yards off. It had a smooth face, hair parted in the middle, a crook
in the hand, was always accompanied by two female figures, one being Mary
the Mother, the other was Dr. S.'s mother. They always appeared just
back of Dr. S. Though the room was dark, she could see the faces of those
present. Dr. S. had at the outset described to Mrs. C. and her friend Mrs.
P. how the Master would come, and she saw it substantially as he had
described, though Mrs. P. did not. The figures appeared suddenly and did

investigation of his phenomena. He was then engaged in commercial life.

not form gradually. She saw them, however, also with her eyes closed and
her hands held before her eyes, trying this experiment several times. She
had no impression that it was the Master beyond the resemblance of the
figure to the conventional pictures of him and Dr. S.'s word. Since these
meetings she has often tried in the twilight to call up voluntarily these
figures, but not succeeded. However, when lonely in her own room and
longing for her mother, she can suddenly see her in the same vapoury way,
but, when anxiously trying to do so, cannot see her. Dr. S. had originally
invited her in the hope of her seeing her husband, but this she has not
succeeded in doing. Messages, however, of no special purport were given by
Dr. S. as coming from the late Mr. C. Mrs. C. doubts genuine materiali
sation, but is investigating spiritualism in accordance with a promise to
her husband when on his death-bed. She believes that as a girl she had
clairvoyant power, saw occasional figures all through her life and described
a persistent one which she saw constantly during the months preceding the
birth of one of her sons and which she believes marked the whole unusual
appearance of this son. Since starting her investigation of spiritualism, the
frequency and variety of these figures have greatly increased, till now,
(August, 1898), she has seen "hundreds." She still, however, much to her
sorrow, has never seen her late husband. She thinks Dr. S. a very pure and
high-minded man, but eccentric and in danger of being unbalanced.
Mr. A., who experienced the dramatic cure of locomotor ataxia, has seen
" lots of figures, as many as ten about Dr. S. at once," and still (August,
1898) sees his wife, mother, and the Master in his hotel ; but he thinks he
has seen only one real materialisation and that was once when his mother
put her arm about him. All the others he described as more spirit-like, and
yet opaque enough that he cannot see objects through them.
Miss McC., about thirty years of age, in the office of a large business
house, had seen Christ alone and with a friend of hers before she knew of
Dr. S. She has since then seen him at Dr. S's. two or three times and also
when alone. Thus she thought that Dr. S. claimed too much in his special
privilege as the medium of Christ's appearance. As a consumptive she was
having treatment from Mrs. B., the professional friend of Dr. S., " to see if
the spirits were of any value " for her sickness.
Captain E. S., real estate agent, is a spiritualist through his wife, who is
an amateur medium. They both have been twice to Dr. S.'s meetings, but
neither saw anything, " although Mrs. S.'s mediumship is strong." A pro
fessional medium, Mrs. H., whom they once took with them, claimed to see all
that Dr. S. did. With a high regard for Dr. S., Captain S., however, thinks
him in danger of being unbalanced by exclusive devotion to his work.
T. B., a student friend of mine, and now a physician, visited Dr. S. one
afternoon in June, 1896, was warmly welcomed, and entertained by a long
talk. As a sample, apparently, of his power, Dr. S. volunteered a descrip
tion of B.'s grandmother, as he saw her playing the piano ; but, on learning
that she never saw a piano, he symbolised it as joy at B.'s getting on the
right track. In the evening B. attended one of the regular meetings. The
usual appearances of the Master were described, perfume suielled, Dr. D.
saw something, Mr. A. got excited and saw everything, Miss McC. saw
something. But B. neither smelled nor saw anything, except the flickering

lights on the wall which came through the transom or window. Dr. S. took
much trouble and evident pride in following B. up with long letters and
invitations for more visits and meetings, and in encouragement for his study
of these all-important phenomena.
F. F. W. , a German-American lawyer, about fifty, was introduced to me
with much explanation at lunch one day by Dr. S., and, on walking back to
Dr. S.'s office together, he urged and insisted that Mr. W. should tell me
what he had seen. But Mr. W. had to mildly protest that he himself had
really seen nothing as yet, but was merely developing, although Dr. S. had
told me that Mr. W. had seen General Grant ; but Mr. W. admitted that
Dr. S. had correctly told him about his having met General Grant in the
south part of Milwaukee, soon after the war. In a subsequent talk with me
alone, Mr. W. described the varying patches of form and colour which he
had seen at the meetings, and which were evidently the retina's own light.
Mr. W.'s wife, however, sees clairvoyantly, and was successful in the first
meeting reported above. Though Mr. W. has no confidence in professional
mediums, he believes Dr. S. to be perfectly sincere and genuine.
Frau H., one of his patients, a middle-aged woman, besides seeing the
Master at Dr. S.'s, described in detail her seeing Him in her own house.
But she has not seen many others of the biblical characters.
W. B. , lawyer and business agent of Dr. S.'s, has attended three or four
meetings, and the first time he saw nothing. But the second time, on
fixating with effort and extreme tension, he once or twice saw what they
called the "face transfiguration," once to that of General Grant, although,
he allowed, the whiskers were not different from Dr. S. 's. He is sure that
once, anyway, he recognised a transfigured face before any one else described
or named it, though he is not sure whether he first spoke of it. The trans
figured face was very fleeting. Having been warned by his wife against
being completely hypnotised, he did not make the same effort to see at the
next meeting, and then saw nothing. Mr. B. thinks the Doctor has tele
pathic powers from his own account, and believes him thoroughly honest
and sincere.
There is only one witness who seems to me of no evidential worth, and
that is the professional, Mrs. B., who was only occasionally present at the
meetings, though she happened to be at the three which I attended. Her
ready and cheerful manner of echoing or anticipating all the usual round of
figures described by Dr. S., the ridiculous mistakes she made (as, for
example, in the Pocahontas matter), the business way in which she adver
tised herself for patients and encouraged every novice to sit for the
development of his natural mediumistic powers, the transparent super
ficiality with which she once announced her starting a Bible class at her
home for weekly study—all these things were highly suspicious of her
genuineness, and quite opposed in general to the Doctor's traits. So I
doubt very much whether she really saw anything, and I believe she
deceived him. For, to my expressed objections to her in my last inter
view with him in January, 1898, he was not concerned, and believed her
to the end his good friend, though he included her among his ignorant
followers. But Mr. A. tells me that Dr. S. warned him and others "not
to take too much stock in what she said." Mr. A. himself had become
80 Professor Harlow Gale. [Supplement.
suspicious of her, as having too much imagination, for he thought it was
strange that she always saw what he did, but that he by no means always
saw what she described. Another reason of distrust which he gave was
quite characteristic of such a mental composition, viz., that Mrs. B. had
told him that his wife had not appeared to him for some time because
she had been sick, but when she did again appear, and he asked her if
the sickness was the reason, she denied it, and said she had been oft' on
the Master's business. There is a possibility, of course, that she may
have been in collusion with Dr. S., supposing him to have been con
sciously deceiving.
When then we come to the question of Dr. S.'s own genuineness, two
components of his character must be specially considered. First, he had
undergone an intellectual change which so disturbed his mental equilibrium
that he was carried largely, if not altogether, over that vague and broad
transition towards the category of the insane. When a man with the
scientific education of a physician is suddenly "converted" in middle life
to the literal belief in biblical theology adopted by Dr. S. ; or when, in other
words, a mature mind abandons reasoning by facts and induction for the
theological deduction from authority and for poetical analogies, that is a
regression to unreasonableness. And Dr. S. 's unreasoning in this sphere made
him dogmatic and imperious in other things. He frequently ridiculed my
trying to get at the "chemical basis," as he expressed it, of his spirits, and
said I could never see till I joined him in first believing. On my seriously
trying to explain my efforts to find a psychological basis for his spirits, he
would cut me short authoritatively, saying he knew all those things and that
they had nothing whatever to do with his Christian Spiritualism. And yet
I could not find that he had seriously studied or considered any natural
explanation of his phenomena. His intense emotional concentration in this
subject so contracted his intellectual life that he had no longer any interest
in the overwhelming mass of the world outside his narrow theological limits.
Secondly, this intellectual concentration of attention and interest was
accompanied by an abnormal heightening of the feeling-component in his
character. For his intense pride in his mission showed itself constantly in
many forms. It often became laughable under the cover of his continual
pseudo-humility talk, —"don't think S. a saint," "it's no credit of S.'s," "S.
is a mere nothing." Though he did not proselytize to any one's annoyance,
yet his greatest happiness was to get some one to whom he could "talk
spirits ; " and any new possible convert was followed up tenaciously with
talks, visits, introductions and letters. He never associated himself with
any religious or spiritualistic church or organisation, but evidently had
more pride and pleasure in forming and being the privileged head of his
little circle of followers. When I asked him about other spiritualists and
especially what he thought of the materialisation phenomena, then being
given at our neighbouring N. W. Spiritualistic Camp Association, he would
only say, " God bless them—perhaps they have something ; " but he never
seemed to have had there or elsewhere any experience of the usual clair
voyant phenomena and cabinet materialisation. He emphasised the fact
that he was a Christian Spiritualist, in that he was a Christian first of all
and then by logical necessity a Spiritualist, which he feared was not the
p&rt xxxvi.] A Study in Spiritistic Hallucinations. 8L
order or relative importance with most Spiritualists. He explained the rare
appearances of Christ and other biblical characters as due to the lower plane
of the ordinary mediums, and thus by inference, the special communion of
which he was the instrument was a Divine mark as surely as that of Parsifal's
and Sir Galahad's. And yet the number of his followers who had seen
the Master—and this was the test of his disciples—only grew from twelve
in June 1896 to about thirty at the beginning of 1897, and about fifty in
1898, at the end of his four years' activity in this new faith in St. Paul.
So in this case then we find the delusion of grandeur, which is so commonly
a characteristic in the unbalanced feeling-life. The pecuniary motive of the
professional was absent, and the only apparent motive was the altogether
disproportionate satisfaction which he got in this obscure life as the centre
of his heterogeneous group of Christian Spiritualists.
With these abnormal intellectual and emotional characteristics, then, I
think it most probable that Dr. S.'s spirits were for the most part real to
him and not assumed. It seems rather probable that with his anxiety for
success and converts he may have unconsciously come to add merely verbal
details or even whole descriptions to his apparently real sense perceptions.1
But that the Master and a large number of figures were honestly real to him,
I believe, from his self-sacrifice for his cause, sincerity, and lack of sufficient
motive for complete deception, whether conscious or unconscious. But the
only visual objective reality corresponding to the spirits seemed to be the
projected lights of the retina, stray patches and streaks of light entering
the room, and perhaps some boundary-contrasts and after-images. For the
hearing, touch and smell perceptions of the spirits and spiritual objects, I
have no evidence of any objective reality. Some of the cutaneous or
muscle sensations constantly present with attention and some singing in
the ears may have been the nucleus of the touches and voices. Whether,
then, these alleged clairvoyant etherialisations and materialisations should
be catalogued under illusions or hallucinations depends on whether there
were any objective perceptions and point of attachment. This objective
element being apparently at most so inconsiderable, these phenomena of
Dr. S.'s should more properly be classed as hallucinations or in part as
pseudo-hallucinations.2 This is probably the more justifiable from Dr.
S.'s own statement in his letter above that before his conversion he "heard
voices once in a while and saw clairvoyantly, but did not understand these
manifestations," and was annoyed by them till he fancied himself on the
verge of insanity. With this exaggerated or even pathological tendency to
hallucinations came the suggestion from his old German friend of seeing
Christ. The mental changes wrought by his conversion were exactly fitted
to develop this hallucination and the others would develop most naturally
by association, intense attention, and hallucinatory projection.
This process can be traced in his followers even more clearly. The most
instructive witness was Mrs. C, with a hallucinatory predisposition from
girlhood, and who only needed the emotional loneliness of her widowhood

and the directing suggestion of Dr. S. to immediately see the Master. Her
experiments with closed eyes show all her figures to bo no more than hallu
cinations. Similar is the case of the hotel-keeper, Mr. A., in his loneliness
for his wife, and perhaps some predisposition to hallucination as shown by
his nervous degeneration in locomotor ataxia. With these preparations, the
confident assurances of Dr. S., the apparently miraculous relief of his lame
ness by suggestion, and his enthusiastic acceptance of Dr. S.'s religion, all
aided in giving a hallucinatory objectivity to his ideas and feelings ; while
for other followers who needed more training in attention and emotion.
Dr. S.'s method was well fitted. The long waiting and expectation in
darkness, the enviable descriptions of successful "seeing," the frequent
encouragement and urging for the sitters to describe anything they saw,
the personal interrogation whether they did not see this or that—all this
aroused partial or occasional success.
This case of spiritistic hallucinations is of special interest, it seems to
me, as being so comparatively simple, so free from the usual confusion of
accompanying fraud, unconscious deception, genuine physical phenomena and
telepathy, automatic writing, etc. Thus it affords a clear view of the process
of the development of spiritistic hallucinations, helping to fill an evidential
gap in the "Report on the Census of Hallucinations," where one reported case
gave rise to the remark that " it is possible that habitual attendance at
spiritualistic seances may lead in some persons to the seeing of apparitions
and hearing of voices." (Proceedings of the S.P.R., Vol. X., p. 176.) Mr.
Gurney, from his study of the earlier Census, had also thought that "it
must be admitted as nossible that mere verbal suggestion may act similarly
[i.e., to hypnotic collective hallucinations] on certain minds at certain times,
without tho preliminary of any definite hypnotic process." (Phantasms of
the Living, 1886, Vol. II., pp. 187-8.)
In helping to reduce the separation between suggestion m the con
ditions of hypnosis and of normal life the case under consideration is also
valuable. For the late progress in the understanding and explanation of
hypnotic phonomena has been by freeing them from the marvellous and
abnormal, and by connecting them with the better known facts of our
normal mental life.
But it is in the help it affords in explaining some parts of the usual
medley of mediumistic phenomena that this case is more immediately
valuable. For with some basis of genuineness, the usual phenomena of
any medium or group of spiritualists are a bewildering conglomerate, and
yet an apparently homogeneous whole, because they are usually all ex
plained on one hypothesis. But, more and more, in all psychological
phenomena it is becoming necessary first to separate the phenomena into
as many categories as possible and then seek for the explanation of each
class. Throughout my acquaintance with this case I have had continually
in mind its possible application to the clearing up of such enigmas as
the experiences of W. Stainton Moses and the high testimony on record
to the marvels of D. D. Home.
There was much in common as to characteristics and methods between
Dr. S. and Mr. Moses. There were the same impatience, obstinacy,
Part xxxvi.] A Study in Spiritistic Hallucinations. 83
irritability, lack of humility and stubbornness of mind. ( "The Experiences
of W. Stainton Moses," by F. \V. H. Myers, Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. IX.,
pp. 247, 252, 293). Dr. S.'s professional education was more scientific, but
his social environment was not so high. There was, however, on the whole
a more serious religious purpose and level in Dr. S.'s phenomena, and a
more devoted self-sacrifice to his mission, (ibid., pp. 258 and 334.) Both
were amateur mediums, giving their manifestations to only a small circle
of friends, Mr. Moses being the more exclusive. And while avoiding
notoriety, both were willing their experiences should be used as testimony
and aided in their publication.1 The fundamental motive of both seemed to
be the satisfaction of authority and leadership. The intellectual character
of the witnesses to Mr. Moses' phenomena were higher than Dr. S.'s, but
there were similar emotional conditions of admiration, unsuspiciousness and
expectation.
When one now reviews Mr. Moses' phenomena to separate any possible
class of hallucinations, it is of course impossible to draw any clear-cut and
certain lines. Unfortunately we have not a sufficiently full report of the
methods and conversations during the seances to judge of the amount of
verbal suggestion. But it seems to have been quite sufficient (as in ibid., p.
322, in Dr. Speer's Report) for the training of expectation until, after
repeated se'ances, the sitters knew by association what to expect from any
name, sound, light, odour, or touch. Some of the visual phenomena seem
undoubtedly hallucinatory. Mr. Moses tells us that the most successful
large luminous appearances, as well as the most perfect musical sounds,
occurred when he was in a state of unconscious trance (ibid., p. 268 and
276), and thus we must usually rely directly on the testimony of the sitters.
The luminous haze and globes, together with their movements described by
Dr. Thompson (ibid., p. 274), seem quite possible as hallucinations, and
the similar ones in Dr. Speer's statement (p. 275) seem to have been held
by a probably hallucinatory hand and drapery, even if the lights were
objective. Here the process of verbal suggestion is well described, when
the "controlling spirit informed me that he would endeavour to place a
light in the medium's hand. Almost immediately a light came. 'Now I will
show you my hand.' A large, very bright light then came up, and inside of
it appeared the materialised hand of the spirit. He told me that the folds
which I saw around the light were drapery, and to prove it he brought the
light and passed the drapery over the back of my hand several times."
One more evident case of hallucination was in Mr. Moses' "vision"
where "Dr. and Mrs. Speer saw misty light but nothing more" (p. 293).
A moving column of light, seven feet high, with a large glowing mass of
light, the cross behind the medium's head, and the cluster of oblong lights,
(p. 297) may have been partly, if not wholly, hallucinatory. In this se'ance,
as in most, the description is not full enough for us to be sure that objective
stray lights were not present as the basis of illusions. Dr. Speer is said in
Mr. Moses' account to have first seen the light, and Mrs. Speer's testimony
1 Dr. S.'s case was thus more similar to Mr. Moses' than the case of Mr. Z.,
reported by Professor Sidgwick in his paper on "Disinterested Deception" in the
Journal S.P.R., Vol. VI., p. 274 ; for Mr. Z.'s case lacked the religious and publioity
motives.

to it is wanting, though she was present. Four months later Dr. Speer
recalls seeing "the hand and arm." (p. 306.) Seven months after these
other phenomena began, the first human figure was recorded by Mrs. Speer.
"We saw a form surrounded with light, standing between myself and the
medium." (p. 302.) But it is not mentioned either in Mr. Moses' or Dr.
Speer's notes. Again four months later Mr. Moses recorded : "Dr. and Mrs.
Speer and I saw a jfigure carrying it [scent] apparently. I also saw a figure
in the middle of the table when the lyre was sounded there." (p. 312.)
But neither Dr. nor Mrs. Speer testified to the former figure, and Mr.
Harrison, who was present, is not included in Mr. Moses' account as seeing
the figure.
Dr. Speer alone then notes the beginning of numerous lights:— "Be
tween thirty and forty spirit lights appeared, many of them as large as
large oranges. They began near the floor, then ascended, and at last by
request came within our circle, so that we might have touched them.
Many of the lights were amorphous, or rather, formless. They succeeded
each other with great rapidity," (p. 313.) At the next seance he notes
similar lights emerging from the aperture of the curtain of a cabinet
which had been fitted up, and in which Mr. Moses sat. With such
a convenience it seems more probable that these lights were produced
objectively by the medium, as the lights are said to have cast reflec
tions upon objects, and some were so large and bright as to show the
whole of the lintels and door posts. (p. 313.) Under those cabinet
conditions at the following seance Mr. Harrison seems, from Dr. Speer's
notes, to have seen these lights. The medium having suggested going
upstairs to the cabinet, and trying for lights, Dr. Speer notes that " they
came almost immediately, of various shapes and sizes, some very large/'
He gives rough drawings of their shapes and continues, "they were all of a
pale bluish green, or rather greenish blue, tint. Many of them had a
perfectly distinct hard outline and bright nucleus. Mr. Harrison says that
such lights could by no possibility be imitated [Mr. H. was an electrician],
and imagines that they were produced by hands holding crystals with drapery
falling on them." (p. 314.) The shapes and colours of these lights are
thoroughly characteristic of the projections of the retina's own light. It is
suspicious of the trustworthiness of the medium's account that Mr.
Harrison's imagined explanation of the light by the hand and drapery in
Dr. Speer's notes is given in Mr. Moses' account as a described fact. Again
Dr. Speer notes "a large number of splendid lights, apparently held by
hands, were seen in the cabinet. I myself saw an arm apparently holding
one of these lights." (p. 317.) But no testimony is given to these by Mrs.
Speer and Dr. Thompson, who were present. Another similar case two
days afterwards occurred at which Mr. Percival joined the family group.
Again, sitting with Dr. Speer alone, Mr. Moses himself records having
" witnessed the formation of some eight or nine very beautiful spirit lights.
They formed quite close to me and near my left hand, about a foot from the
floor, floating upwards till they reached the level of the table and became
visible to Dr. Speer. They were expressly made at my side, instead of, as
usual, at my back, so that I might see them. They seemed to develop from
a very bright speck, about the size of a pea, until they attained the size of a
Part xxxvi.] A Study in Spiritistic Hallucinations. 85
soda* water tumbler, and showed a soft luminosity like pale moonlight. They
seemed to be covered with drapery and to be held by a hand. They faded
slowly out, remaining visible about thirty or forty seconds, or perhaps a
minute. The largest would be about eight inches long." (p. 319.) As Mr.
Moses did not himself usually see anything, this is an interesting description.
For, as far as it is genuine, it is characteristically hallucinatory. Dr. Speer's
corroboration to this seance is not recorded ; but the next day, during their
trip together in Ireland, he records that " fifteen great lights showed them
selves, varying from the size of an orange to that of a shaddock." (p. 321.)
The next day Dr. Speer recorded, in a longer account of the usual lights
and hands, that the control speaking through Mr. Moses "explained the
process of making the lights, and told me that the folds I saw around them
hanging down were really drapery, which he would prove to me. He then
brought the light close to my hand, and brushed it backwards and forwards
with as distinct a materialised drapery as can well be conceived. This feat
he repeated first on one hand and then on the other, five or six times, at the
same time directing my attention to the character of the light and the
tangibility of the drapery." (p. 323.) This is an excellent example again of
the suggestion process, though a later direction to lean forward and close his
eyes till told to open them seems to complicate any explanation with a
probable element of trickery. The more permanent visibility of a cylindrical
light is recorded later ; forty-five minutes being given by Dr. Speer and
five minutes by Mr. Moses, who contrasts this with the other lights which
"have faded very rapidly, lasting from ten seconds to, perhaps, a minute."
(pp. 325-6.) This discrepancy of its permanency is apparently a mistake
of Dr. Speer's or a misprint, for later he records the same light "for some
minutes." (p. 328.)
Mrs. Speer's account is again given at another seance where she saw "two
or three very large lights. One must have measured with its drapery quite
two feet in height ; he [the control] brought it close to my face, and brushed
my hands many times with the drapery ; he also touched my hand, and his
hand felt as human as my own. The lights were not good, as Mr. S. M.
was ill, and the atmosphere was not right, and this interfered with their
development. The medium then said he saw a fresh spirit standing by
Catherine." (p 329). Though Mrs Speer did not see this figure she
noted that on joining the medium and Dr. Speer and " sitting down, I saw
a bright figure standing behind Mr. S. M." (p. 329.) Neither of these
figures was seen by Dr. Speer, who only records : " Three splendid lights
appeared ; an arm was seen [not mentioned as seen by Mrs. Speer or Mr.
Moses] ; drapery repeatedly thrown over us.'' (p. 329.) Mr. Moses' own
explanation of these lights is interesting. In this seance he recorded "a
number of lights, some of which were comparative failures, the nucleus only
being visible. This nucleus Mentor has explained that he brings with him,
and in unfavourable conditions he is not able to surround it with the
luminosity which he gets from the circle." (p. 328.) At a seance throe
weeks later he recorded: "When we went up into the cabinet upstairs,
Mentor made some very clear lights, one of which endured over four minutes.
I had been very anxious to try the duration of the light, because an imitation
of such lights is made by phosphorised oil ; but lights so made are of very
86 Professor Harlow Gale. [Supplement.
brief duration. I believe a favourable trial would show that Mentor's light
would last seven or eight minutes." (p. 331.)
In the published notes from the second and subsequent years' experiences
(Proceedings S.P.K., Vol. XI., pp. 24 to 114), we will not follow the lights
more in detail, Beyond the light reported by Dr. Speer (ibid. p. 31), which
"remained visible for upwards of forty minutes" and the Prophet's little
light, which Mr. Moses records as giving answers through flashes during a
long conversation with him (p. 38), and which so seem more objective than
hallucinatory, there is nothing new as compared with the first year's lights.
In only four cases is there the evidence of one of the sitters besides Mr.
Moses. But a very suggestive feature in these later experiences is the
increased frequency of "visions" and human figures described by Mr.
Moses. Only three figures were reported in the first year, one by Mrs.
Speer (IX. p. 302), and two by Mr. Moses (pp. 312 and 329), and on the
hallucination theory we should expect that after the practice and suggestion-
training of the first months there would be an increase of the more com-
plicated and complete figures over the simpler lights with their partially
visible hands, arms, and drapery.
Mr. Moses recorded that he saw " a veiled figure standing by Dr. S. Mrs.
S. could see the light, but could not distinguish the figure." But later in the
same seance he was, " as is frequently the case, clairvoyant, and described
the face of the Emperor, his waxed imperial and moustache, his impassive
marble face, and wound up by saying he was a ' regular Mephistopheles.'
The form was just in the same place and apparently could not come within
the circle." (XI., p. 33). Dr. Speer records this of the " clairvoyant member
of the circle," (p 34), but not of himself.
Now occurs the first record of one of Mr. Moses' curious visions which
he had experienced twice before. (See pp. 36, 37). The next day also, "on
coming out of the trance, I saw and described the spirit as one of command
ing mien, with a short robe girt round the waist, and a crown with a cross ►{«
in the centre, just as the Prophet has a star. In his hand he held a long
wand, terminating in a cross. He said nothing, and gradually faded from
view." (p. 37). Again a few days later Mr. Moses was clairvoyant and
described his grandmother again. "She had a child with her. I also
described the Prophet and Theophilus, and several spirits who were
apparently at the ceiling over the table, and were showering down scent "
(p. 38) and he "described clairvoyantly the Prophet and the Seer together—
the latter a young and very beautiful spirit, the Prophet dignified and aged.
Also Grocyn and a tall spirit by Dr. Speer whom I did not know. There
was a deal of light in the room." (p. 40.) This latter condition Mrs.
Speer described as the room being "filled with spirit light, large masses
floating about in every direction." (p. 40.) An interesting record in the
hallucinatory objectivity of Mr. Moses' progress now occurred. " In the
midst of the seance, when perfectly clear of influence, I saw Theophilus and
the Prophet. They were as clear and palpable to the eye as human beings
would bo in a strong light. Placing my hand over my eyes made no difference,
but turning away I could see them no longer. This experiment I repeated
several times. I also saw the little Catherine. This is the first time I re
member being so clairvoyant in a seance without being previously entranced. "

(p. 43.) Five more figures are recorded, either by Mr. Moses or Mrs.
Speer, as seen by Mr. Moses alone, (pp. 45, 46, 48 and 58.) "Once two
very clearly defined figures were near Dr. Thompson, visible to both of us,"
(i.e. to Mr. M. and Dr. T.'s son), (p. 52) but the latter's evidence is wanting.
The last recorded event of this class is another vision of Mr. Moses' (see
pp. 59 and 60).
These records extend over the first two and a half years of Mr. Moses'
phenomena. Of the later experiences of the last three years the son of Dr.
Speer, Mr. Charlton T. Speer, has given a very suggestive summary.
" Numerous lights were generally visible to all the sitters. The lights were
of two different kinds— objective and subjective ; the former were usually
like small illuminated globes, which shone brightly and steadily, often
moved rapidly about the room and were visible to all the sitters. A curious
fact in connection with the.ie lights always struck me, viz., that looking
on to the top of the table one could see a light slowly ascending from the
floor and to all appearances passing out through the top of the table, the
table itself apparently not affording any obstacle to one's view of the light.
It is a little difficult to explain exactly what I mean, but had the top of the
table been composed of plain glass, the effect of the ascending light as it
appeared to one's organs of vision, would have been pretty much the same
as it was seen through the solid mahogany. Even then, to make the parallel
complete, it would be necessary to have a hole in the glass top of the table,
through which the light could emerge. The subjective lights were described
as being large masses of luminous vapour, floating around the room and
assuming a variety of shapes. However, Dr. Speer and myself being of
entirely unmediumistic temperaments, we were only able to see the objectiee
lights, but Mr. Stainton Moses, Mrs. Speer, and other occasional sitters
frequently saw and described those which were merely subjectiee. Another
curious point in relation to the objective lights was that, however brightly
they might shine, they never—unlike an ordinary lamp —threw any radiance
round them or illuminated the smallest portion of the surrounding darkness
when it ivas dark—in the slightest degree." (Proceedings IX., pp. 345-6.)
It seems questionable whether the objective lights here described were not
partly illusion, if not hallucination. The latter point of the non-radiance of
the objective light is contradictory to several of Dr. Speer's notes, as above
quoted. (See Proceedings IX., p. 313.)
On collecting together the phenomena of hearing, there is much more
difficulty in separating the probably hallucinatory from the real sounds.
But with an undoubted large basis of real sound to be accounted for, there
is besides, in the details of localisation, quantity and quality of sound,
much which can most probably be explained as illusion. For in localisation,
e.g., we know experimentally how helpless one is in distinguishing sound as
front or back and as to distance.
In my own experience in a semi-professional group of spiritualists, some
raps, which I made on the legs of my chair in the middle of the circle, were
localised by one of the circle as coming from a brie a-brac cabinet high up
on the wall, about eight feet to my left, and this was acquiesced in by
others. Again, Mrs. Gale and I, at a materialisation seance, had localised
the sounds of a mouth organ as coming from the cabinet about ten feet in
88 Profexsor Harlow Gale. [Supplement.
front of vis, until Mrs. Gale stood at the cabinet curtain, when it seemed to
be about four feet to her right ; and only considerably later did we discover
that it came from a sitter immediately in front of us.
The " fairy bells," described by Mr. Moses and Mrs. Speer, show well
these possibilities of illusion, if not of hallucination. Mrs. Speer records :
" I then heard a sweet tinkling sound like a clear bell close to my ear ; it
moved and played in front of the medium, who was still deeply entranced,
and afterwards it played over the middle of the table, when Dr. S. heard it
for the first time. It was a striking manifestation ; the notes were so clear,
sweet, and low—we named it 'fairy bells.' " And again : "Before meeting
this evening we heard the ' fairy bells ' playing in different parts of the
garden, where we were walking ; at times they sounded far off, seemingly
playing at the top of some high elm trees, music and stars mingling together,
then they would approach nearer to us, eventually following us into the
seance room, which opened on to the lawn. After we were seated the
mmie still lingered with us, playing in the corners of the room, and then
over the table round which we were sitting." (XI, pp. 56 and 57.)
Clairaudience is only reported by Mr. Moses himself in his group ;
and, like the clairvoyance, coming more often, if not altogether, after the
first year. He reports a long conversation with a figure, "John C."
(XI., p. 45), and "Judge Edmunds" (p. 49). Mr. Moses gives this sug
gestive description:— "The peculiarity of the seance was that when I
could hear the sound no one else could, and vice eersa. I heard by clair
audience and not by natural hearing, being very deaf with my cold. On
request I was enabled to hear the sound with my natural ear, but I
described it long before it was heard by the others, and heard it fre
quently when they did not. At the same time I was unconscious of
sounds apparently made on the table under my nose." (p. 50.)
In the sense of smell the phenomena were decidedly material, as judged
by Mr. Percival's account (IX., pp. 272, 273), and Dr. Speer's : "Scent
thrown in great quantities —so much was thrown at Mrs. S. 's eye as to
produce excruciating agony and congestion of the eye, with almost blind
ness for twenty-four hours " (p. 328) ; and after a " large quantity of
Sp. Pulegii . . . the dining-room cloth and my own nether habiliments
had to be exposed to view in the back garden ; and on the following
morning our dining-room floor and passage had to be freely fumigated
with pastilles." (p. 339).
But if the phenomena of smell were probably not hallucinatory, those of
touch, again, probably were. The touch of drapery on Dr. Speer's hand
(pp. 275, 323) was promised by the medium as proof, and thus acted as
a most natural preparatory suggestion. As in the other senses, Mr. Moses'
own experience here too was most real. He records : — " The most curious
part of the se'ance was that in which an elaborate attempt was made to
relieve my bronchitis. When we made the usual break, after sitting for about
forty minutes, I was perfectly conscious of two materialised hands making
passes over my head, throat, chest and back. . . . The sensation of
the hands was perfectly distinct and unmistakable." (XI., p. 49.)
In reviewing these experiences of Stainton Moses for a probable element
of hallucination, I am, of course, aware that any reasonable deduction to
Part xxxvi. A Study in Spiritistic Hallucinations. 89
be made on account of this explanation from the unprecedented variety
and great mass of his spiritistic phenomena (see IX., p. 336) will be
comparatively small. The overwhelming mass of the phenomena and all
the greatest marvels still remain unsolved. But from these I think
another indeterminable amount must be subtracted. For with this hallu
cinatory tendency in the simplest phenomena, it seems probable that
both Mr. Moses' and his witnesses' accounts of the physical phenomena
are unconsciously exaggerated and distorted ; and this to a degree beyond
the ordinary possibilities of mal-observation, owing to these special mental
characteristics and to training conducive to hallucinations and illusions.
(See Davey and Hodgson on the " Possibilities of Mai-Observation " :
Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. IV., 381, Vol. VIII., 252.) Though, as has
been said, different persons will make various estimates of the amount
of Mr. Moses' experiences which can reasonably be accounted for by
hallucinations and illusions, yet it seems to me Dr. 8. 's case has been
helpful in giving us materials for some explanatory reduction of these
puzzling spiritistic experiences. How the larger mass still remain
ing can be explained is a separate question, which, though out of
the bounds of this paper, I cannot but think can be similarly analysed
as due to automatic writing, some small residuum of perhaps genuine
physical phenomena and telepathy, and more or less unconscious and
disinterested deception prompted by the pleasure of leadership and
authority. (See Mr. Podmore's treatment of Mr. Moses' case in his
Studies in Psychical Research, 1897, pp. 115 to 119.) Some such analysis
of these alleged spiritistic phenomena seems to me much more reasonable
than Mr. Myers's disjunctive that "the permanent fraud of the whole
group, or the substantial accuracy of all the records, are the only hypo
theses which seem to me capable of covering the facts," (Proceedings, IX.,
p. 254), and later, having excluded the former alternative, he concludes:—
" I therefore regard the reported phenomena as having occurred in a
genuinely supernormal manner." (Proceedings, Vol. XI., p. 25.)
The allowance for hallucination in the high testimony to the phenomena
of D. D. Home has been suggested and followed out in some detail in Mr.
Podmore's Sttuiies in Psychical Research (pp. 121-124).

90 A Case of Alleged Loss of Personal Identity. (Supplement.
II.
A CASE OF ALLEGED LOSS OF PERSONAL IDENTITY.
The following account is an abridged report of an alleged loss of
personal identity, and presents many features ditEcult of interpreta
tion, and not without interest. It describes the history of a Mr. Hall,
discovered at Mankato, Minnesota, at which place he declared that he
could not recall his past life. Upon further investigation this past
life was traced, and many conspicuous fraudulent facts ascertained in
connection with it. The man had an obvious reason for desiring to
wreck his connection with the past : and an attempt to evade the
consequences of his acts, ingenious, but not unparalleled, might appear
at first sight the simplest explanation. Yet those who have come into
personal contact with the man decline to accept this plausible
hypothesis. The case seems more probably one of those obscure cases
on the borderland of abnormal personality—cases where it is so
difficult to ascertain how much is responsible conscious decision, and
how much uncontrollable epileptic changes.
On the 14th of October, 1896, says Professor Harlow Gale : —
A gentlemanly and intelligent Englishman about 50 years of age walked
into Mankato, Minnesota, and registered at the City Hotel as "John
Harrison, St. Paul." The expenses of lodging and breakfast having ex
hausted his money, he left the hotel the next morning, and wandered about
town all that day and the following night. In the morning he returned faint
and weary to the hotel, told the clerk he had no money, and offered his
umbrella as security for breakfast. He then inquired for the Episcopal
Church, and thus found his way to the Rector of the church, Rev. George
H. Davis, to whom he said he could not recall his past life. He knew he
was a churchman, showed an Episcopal Prayer Book, recalled having
presented some girls from his Sunday School class for confirmation at some
Easter two or three years ago ; had been in the habit of acting as lay-reader
somewhere, and had perhaps been in the furniture business. He knew,
however, that his name was not Harrison, though he could not recall his real
name. Bur, beyond these facts he said he remembered nothing ; could not
tell whence he came into Mankato (except that he walked by a bluff and
across a bridge into town). His consecutive memory broke off at that point
two days before. Having asked to be directed to a physician, Mr. Davis
took him to Dr. J. VV. Andrews, corner of Cherry and 2nd-streets, to
whom alone he told the same story. He was then further sure that his
wife and children were dead ; that he had lost his valise and pocket-book,
t did not know where or when. He thought he had left home several
Part xxxvi. A Case of Alleged Loss of Personal Identity. 91
weeks ago ; had had means ; had been in Winnipeg ; was engaged somewhere
in business for himself, and that this was the first attack of the kind he
had had. He said he never tasted liquor, and was in apparent good health.
So he was taken to the hospital to await the probable recovery of his lost
memories. A week after his admission, hearing of the cyclone at St. Louis,
he said he recalled something how that injury looked. Acting on this
suggestion, Prof. C. F. Koehler, Psychologist at the State Normal School at
Mankato, gave him a railroad map. This he scanned till he came upon the
Mobile and Ohio railroad, which seemed familiar to him. Following this
along he came to Fruitdale, Ala., where he then recalled having been in the
lumber business. After this experience he called on Mr. Davis, and seemed
very happy at being on the track of his identity. Shortly before this he
had, after some apparent effort, recalled the name of Blanchard, Chamber of
Commerce, Chicago, with whom he had been in business. Through Dr.
Andrews he had written him, telling him of his loss of identity, and asking
for help. Mr. B. replied that he thought he recognised the man from Dr.
Andrews' description, and would come from Chicago to see him, whereat he
was happily excited. On November 5th Mr. Blanchard came, was gladly
received by his former business associate, who now recalled the saw-mill and
most of the people in his employ. On Mr. B.'s telling him his name was
John Hardcastle Hall, he then for the first time recalled that it was. He
could not remember when he left Fruitdale, or Mobile, but did recall being
in Chicago in June. Only pleasant recollections seemed to return to Hall
as he chatted and chuckled along with his former business friend.
Mr. B. now accused him in severe terms of dishonesty, and threatened
him with arrest. But, to "liar, forger, embezzler, defaulter," etc., Hall only
listened in a dazed way, and with a surprised and hurt expression. He knew
nothing of the §400 drawn in Mobile, nor of the §300 borrowed there, nor
could he account for some $2,300 sent, more than to think he must have
paid it out. He asked why he should have been so anxious to send for
Mr. B. if such things had occurred, and he was liable to be prosecuted.
Mr. Blanchard, later in the day, gave an account of his connection with
J. H. Hall. It appeared that he had arrived at Fruitdale, Alabama, penni
less ; he started a project of a saw-mill there, securing local support ; had
called on Mr. Blanchard, presenting unexceptional references, none of them,
however, extending into the immediately preceding seven years, and had
finally induced him to provide capital for the saw-mill. This Hall superin
tended, sending monthly reports to Blanchard at Chicago, the accounts being
altogether fraudulent, Hall intercepting all the money instead of paying the
employes.
" Hall was industrious to a high degree, feverishly active, the first at
the mill in the morning and the last to leave, always going hero and there,
hut accomplishing nothing. He was not a good business man, yet the
business would have been successful had he acted squarely. He
was a master of lying and forged letters, and carried on a systematic course
of deception. He did petty thieving when he could have gotten more from
me. He forged a letter purporting to be written by one Slater to himself,
saying that the writer had §1,500 to invest, and would give it to Hall to use in
the business if he (Slater) could have a position. I was led to believe that this
92 A Case of Alleged Loss of Personal Identity. [Supplement.
was done, and that Hall had put this money into the business ; yet I after
wards learned that the letter was a forgery and not attempted to be an
imitation of Slater's handwriting. Slater was a common deck hand on a
boat and had no money, but Hall gave him a good position to keep up the
deception, but did not pay him anything. Hall put no money into the
business.
" Hall's non-payment of his men and the storekeepers began to make them
clamorous for money, and he came back two weeks later and wanted money.
I had none then, but told him to go back to the State line and I would
telegraph him $400 then. This was done. Hall got on the train for
Fruitdale, and when the train arrived there the labourers were on the
platform, demanding their money. The foreman rushed in and stated that
the men were highly excited and that they must be paid. Hall coolly took
from his pocket a big roll of bills and told the foreman that he had more
than enough money to pay every man. He then took from another pocket
a big package of what purported to be bills and handed it to the foreman,
saying that there was the exact amount to pay the men. The foreman took
the package and got off just as the train was pulling out. He found on
examination that the package was merely paper cut up and shaved down to
the size of bills and wrapped in paper.
"Hall went on to Mobile that night and borrowed §300 from a friend and
then disappeared, but has never been seen or heard of since, until I met
him to-day. He wrote to me on June 17th on stationery of a prominent
Mobile hotel where he was not stopping, saying that he was feeling sick
that day, and that ' the mental strain and worry of the last 14 days has
almost broken me up.' This was the day that he disappeared and the last that
I ever heard from him. He got about $10,000 of my property on a tissue of
falsehoods.
" Hall was the reverse in his habits of what a defaulter usually is. He
was frugal and stingy, and his habits were correct, and he never tasted
liquor. At Chicago, if I did not invite him to my house, he would go to a
twenty cent lodging house and a ten cent lunch counter. He does not act
differently now from what he did when I knew him before. There is the
same timid hesitancy in his bearing. Although he was a systematic embezzler,
I shall not have him arrested or prosecute him, as I do not care to be
revengeful, and he has no means that I know of.
"His is a most curious case. I don't think that he was crazy during the
six months that he was in business with me, and I am at a loss to know
whether he is feigning his present condition. If he is, which I think
probable, he may have sent for me on account "f being oppressed by the
fear of arrest. He can remember the good that he has done and forget the
evil, for he seems not to remember his bad deeds in Alabama."—Manlato
Free Press.
In a final private conversation with Hall the following day before
returning to Chicago, Mr. B. talked very kindly, offering to forget the past
and to furnish Hall with money to go wherever he wished to make a fresh
start if he would only tell Mr. B. what he really knew. At this Hall broke
down in tears and sobs, but could recollect nothing more and could not
accept the offered assistance.
Part xxxvi.] A Case of Alleged Loss of Personal Identity. 93
On the other hand, a Mr. W. P. Stuart, who had known Hall in
Fruitdale, wrote on November 4th to the effect that he was convinced of
Hall's honesty, and that his affairs, although involved, would have been by
no means hopeless but for his flight. With regard to the question of Hall's
mental condition, a letter was received from a clergyman who had known
him in Dallas, Tex., and who spoke of him as having been temporarily
insane. In response to enquiries there came the following letter : —
" State of New York—Manhattan State Hospital,
" Ward's Island, New York City,
" March 22nd, 1898.
"A. E. Macdonald, M.D.,
" General Superintendent.
" Male Department,
" Percy Bryant, M.D.,
" Medical Superintendent.
" Dear Sir, — I beg to say, in reply to your inquiries, that on the 27th
of August, 1895, a patient named John Harrison, alias Hall, was admitted
to this hospital. The patient was discharged before I assumed charge here
as Superintendent, and therefore I am unable to give you any information
derived from personal observation. He was discharged November 12th of
the same year, and sent to Dallas, Texas, where his parents lived. [?] It
appears from the records that correspondence had been had with Rev.
Edward Wickens, of Dallas.
"The records further show that the patient, upon admission here, was
dull, depressed, and could give little information of himself, except to state
that he had been in New York City a few days. It also appears that he
was much confused. When released he had recovered from his depression
and physical inactivity. —Very truly yours,
" Percy Bryant,
" Medical Superintendent.
" Harlow Gale, Esq.,
" Instructor, Univ. of Minnesota,
" Minneapolis, Minn."
This former condition, resembling his present, except with only a few
days' loss of memory, occurred then shortly before the starting of the
Fruitdale lumber scheme in which he interested Mr. Blanchard.
It appeared later, from articles in St. Paul papers, that in 1893 Hall had
been obliged to leave Seattle, where he had had the management of a large
box factory. But no serious dishonesty had been alleged against him there.
His career in Seattle was terminated by the discovery that he had undergone
a term of imprisonment in St. Quentin, California. Of the particulars of
this affair in California very little seems to be known. From Seattle Hall
went to Dallas ; then followed his stay at the N.Y. State Insane Hospital,
and some time after that the Fruitdale venture. An attempt was made to
obtain from him some connected account of his career by means of
hypnotism, but with very little success.
Finding no employment in Mankato, he went to Minneapolis in December,
1896. There, while seeking some opening in business, he took a prominent
94 A Case of Alleged Loss of Personal Identity. [Supplement.
part in church work, and won the good opinion of his neighbours. But in
the autumn of 1897 he disappeared once more, leaving behind him no few
unpaid bills and an impaired reputation. He was in Cincinnati during the
winter of 1897-8, and since then nothing more has been heard of him.
After examining Hall's career, Professor Gale concludes as
follows :—
When one now looks back at this strange mental composition to analyse
and classify it, there appear to mo two important characteristics connecting
him over toward the insane :—
1. A delusion of grandeur (" Grossowahn "), as shown in his restless
activity and pleasure in these series of large schemes started on such small
foundations. His absorption in them was intense, leaving him no interest
for other things except his church. In my interviews with him he could
not get away from talk about himself ; some brain micro-photographs, which
1, for this purpose, showed and explained to him, had no interest. In hiR
church, even, he pushed himself forward everywhere in an unusually com
manding way.
2. The common delusion of persecution was an easier explanation of his
series of failures than the reasonable and evident lack of foresight, capital,
and honesty. But no such reasoning would affect him. The reversed
judgment of his friends, who came to know him thoroughly, was explained,
too, in this way.
With these two characteristics (which are only exaggerations of the
normal mental components of pleasure in activity and success and of
suspicion) is specially connected the question of his consciousness of, and
responsibility for, his dishonest practices, however great or small they
really have been. That he is not a deliberate and conscious knave or even
deceiver seems to me reasonably sure. And as, therefore, the ordinary
motives which influence the average mental complex do not come into his
consciousness with inhibitory or motor force, he is not responsible as is the
average man. His case is of much interest as an example of the many
components of knowledge, feeling, and motor reaction which constitute the
manifold complex "mind," and the limitless variety of these combinations,
with the wide transition region between sanity and insanity. In its non-
responsibility the case illustrates the modern " necessity " of willing as a
reign of law in mental life as against the old metaphysical " freedom." His
would be a case for restraint and not punishment.
As to the genuineness of his loss of personal identity, it seems to me, in
some degree at least, genuine, and perhaps entirely so. His unstable,
nervous temperament, with its excessive activity and disposition to worry
and suspicion, were favourable to such a catastrophe. For the first collapse
in August, 1895, though only of short duration, there seems no motive for
deception, except to gain a retreat and rest. And if the first one was
genuine, the still greater stress of circumstances, which culminated in
June, 1896, was enough to cause a greater mental rupture. However,
the suspicious limits of his recovered memories remind one of the often
wonderfully ingenious reasoning and cunning self-control of the insane,
and give much evidence to the probability that with some real loss of
Part xxxvi.] A Case of Alleged Loss of Personal Identity. 95
memories he consciously or unconsciously—as it seems to me more likely—
used his more or less mental break to cover his dishonesties.
I am fortunate to be able to append the following examination of Hall
by Dr. H. A. Tomlinson, superintendent of the St. Peter State Hospital for
the Insane, and gratified at the approach of my conclusion to his judgment
founded on such greater knowledge and experience.
March 23rd, 1898.
. . " The man was undoubtedly an epileptic, the muscular out
break being absent and replaced by the establishment of so-called double
consciousness. This was evidenced by his conduct and history, both as
given by himself and learned from others afterwards. I did not know
anything about Mr. Hall's ever having been in a hospital for the insane, but
should not be surprised to learn that he had been in several, for that is the
usual history of such cases. I did not make any notes of my examination
of this man, and my recollection is hazy as to details. I remember,
however, having noticed several of the stigmata of degeneracy, and among
them some asymmetry in arterial distribution and location. Besides, the
radial artery on one side was quite small, while on the other it was
disproportionately large. Several similar cases to this one have been
reported, and one I knew myself much more peculiar than this one.
There is no doubt but that this man was markedly defective morally, and
traded on his peculiar mental condition, of which he was more conscious
than he was willing to admit or recognise. These cases seem very clear to
me, presenting only exaggerations of those characteristics which make the
confidence man and dead-beat conspicuous, the difference being that one
acts with definite purpose and from preconceived plans, while the other is
the creature of environment, apparently acting automatically upon the
suggestions of those around them."
In the prosecution and preparation of this study I wish to express my
sincere thanks for the kindness and aid of Rev. George H. Davis, Dr. J. W.
Andrews, Prof. C. F. Koehler, Mr. E. F. Searing, of the Mwnkato Free
Press, and Dr. H. A. Tomlinson.

NOTE BY MR. F. C. S. SCHILLER
on his Review of Prof. Munsterbero's "Psychology and Mysticism"
(in Proceedings S.P.R., Part XXXV., p. 348).
I am informed that I have given great offence to Professor Miinsterberg
by quoting incompletely (in the last number of these Proceedings, p. 358) a
passage from the article on "Psychology and Mysticism," which I criticised
and which he has since republished in a book entitled Psychology and Life.
I feel, therefore, that I owe Professor Miinsterberg the reparation of a full
quotation and the readers of the Proceedings an explanation of how the
omission came about.
Professor Miinsterberg's full context runs as follows (Atlantic Monthly,
p. 78; Psychology and Life, p. 260): "Why do I avoid these seances? It
is not because-I am afraid that thoy would shake my theoretical views and
convince me of mysticism, but because I consider it undignified to visit such
performances, as one attends a variety shoto, for amusement only, without
atternptiiuj to explain them, and because I know that I should be the last man
to see through the scheme and discover the trick."
The clause which I have italicised was omitted by me (with the due
asterisks) simply because it seemed to me to convey the unjust and
offensive innuendo, which recurs with such deplorable frequency in his
article, viz., that no one can be supposed to take an honest, serious and
scientific interest in the topics of Psychical Research. Now I had already
protested against this assumption on p. 350 of my article, and so did not
think it necessary to draw attention to a passage whose only novelty seemed
to consist in the indication it seemed to afford of a habit of attending variety
shows on the part of Professor Miinsterberg. Of course if I could have
anticipated that this omission would really prevent Professor Miinsterberg
from defending himself against the somewhat damaging charge of having
recklessly misconstrued the whole position of the S.P.R., I should have been
delighted to quote him at any length.
As it is, I regret rather that 1 quoted so much and did not omit the first
clause also. For, I may point out, it was not really and seriously relevant to
my general argument, or even to the immediate discussion, which at that
point consisted mainly of "chaff" about the "surpassing inuocency of his
character " to which Professor Miinsterberg had so ingenuously confessed.
On the whole, therefore, I may assure the readers of Proceedings that my
position with regard to the passage complained of is thoroughly defensible,
though I forbear to show this more fully lest I should continue to give
offence to Professor Miinsterberg.
With regard to that gentleman himself, I can only say that if he feels
hurt I am sorry, but that he himself provoked the tone of my criticism by
Partxxxvi.] Note on Review of Professor Miinsterberg. 97
the tone of his article. The S.P.It. has always welcomed criticism ; it has
endured much that was not always inspired by that fulness of knowledge
and accuracy of statement which are so conducive to the effectiveness of a
criticism. But the time has come when it need no longer offer both cheeks
to any smiter who chooses to arm himself, not with reason, but merely with
the professorial handle to his name. Nevertheless, I believe I am expressing
only the general sentiment of the S.P.R. in saying that, as soon as there is
manifested on Profesbor Miinsterberg's side any disposition to drop the mis
placed and irritating tone of professorial superiority and a priori dogmatism,
there will be no persistence in the persiflage which was needed to defend the
interests of the S.P.R. from being crushed by the weight of authority in the
eyes of the general public. And as soon as it is admitted by Professor
Miinsterberg that on our side also there are men who are honestly desirous
of truth and fact, we shall readily respond by admitting that truth and fact
are far more likely to be elicited by co-operation for truly scientific
purposes and by truly scientific methods, than by recrimination. And even
if co-operation should prove impracticable, the field of psychology is surely
wide enough to admit of the toleration of those who, in a truly scientific
spirit, though perhaps with more than the usual scientific boldness, have
ventured to penetrate into a vast and intricate mass of residual phenomena.

REVIEWS.
The Alleged Haunting of B House, including a journal kept during the
tenancy of Colonel Le Mesurier Taylor. Edited by A. Goodrich-Freer
(Miss X.), and John, Marquess of Bute, K.T. (London: George
Redway. 1890.)
This is the house of which Mr. Myers wrote to the Times in June, 1897 :
''I visited B , representing that Society [the S.P.R.] . . . and
decided that there was no such evidence as could justify us in giving the
results of the inquiry a place in our Proceedings."
From the evidential standpoint Mr. Myers' verdict was no doubt right ;
but nevertheless the Editors, who prefix the above quotation as a motto to
their book, are in my judgment fully justified in publishing the result of
that inquiry. Of the hundreds of accounts of haunted houses contributed
during the last seventeen years to the Society's archives, we have very few—
probably not more than four or five—in which the evidence is based, to any
considerable extent, on contemporary documents, and any addition to this
small number is therefore very welcome.1 And B House is a fairly
typical case. The Editors bring forward what appears to be ample proof that
the house had the reputation of being haunted for many years prior to their
visit, though the manifestations on which that reputation rested would seem
to have consisted mainly of inexplicable sounds ; there is but little first
hand evidence for visual phantasms prior to 1897, and where first-hand
documents are quoted, they do not always bear a date (see e.g., pp. 13 and
17). But the phenomena during Colonel Taylor's tenancy were surprisingly
numerous and varied, and were recorded day by day and with all needful
fulness.
For all that, the journal is quite unimpressive. Partly, no doubt, this
very want of impressiveness is a tribute to the excellence of the record ;
if the ghostly sights and sounds in other haunted houses had been as faith
fully set down day by day, they might be found to make even duller
reading.
But there are other reasons why this laborious journal of " phenomena "
fails to impress. The inexplicable incidents recorded consist mainly of
sounds, occurring most frequently at night, but not seldom also in the day
time, which are described by numerous witnesses as being unusually striking,
distinct, and varied in character. No experiment, however, was made to
determine the actual source of the sounds. A phonograph is mentioned
1 One such case is recorded in Proceedings, VIII., p. 331, another in Proceedings,
VI., p. 266. One or two other casea will be found in the Journal.
Part xxxvi.] Review. 99
in the early part of the book, but it was never employed. The house, as
the Editors inform us, stands in a well-known seismic area ; but a seismo
meter was actually introduced only on the last night of the tenancy, when
the noises had already ceased to be heard. But apart from the use of
instruments requiring, probably, expert handling, there is much that might
have been done and was not done. The bedrooms, or some of them, were
fitted with fixed basins, with pipes communicating with the outer air ; and
the whole house was furnished with a system of hot water pipes, which
were in working order during part of the period under consideration. Some
experiment might surely have been made to determine whether these metal
pipes, contracting or expanding under changes of temperature, had anything
to do with the sounds heard. Miss Freer and her coadjutor do not appear
even to have determined whether or not the sounds which they described day
after day were objective. Professor Lodge thinks that they were, but "not
impressive," and " not distinct enough to be evidential " (pp. 192-200).
Colonel Taylor writes, " I heard many noises in the night during my stay at
B , but they were of much the same sort I have been accustomed to hear
at a similar time in other houses. I think that some of our witnesses may
have given them undue prominence under the influence of their own
expectancy. The clairvoyant visions of ' Ishbel ' in the grounds are not of
great evidential value for the scientific world in general, and I think that
any amount of ' voices ' could be read into the noises of the running stream,
near where she is seen, by those who wished to hear. Still there are some
objective noises which cannot be easily accounted for in an ordinary way "
(p. 153).
But, after all, the main reason why the recital of these various mani
festations fails to impress us has still to be told. It was Miss Freer who
first saw a ghostly figure ; it was again Miss Freer who first heard ghostly
noises, and throughout these records it is Miss Freer who is most frequently
and most conspicuously favoured with "phenomena." Miss Freer has
shown that she knows how to observe clearly and how to record accurately,
but, for all that, her testimony in a matter of this kind carries very little
weight.
Of course I intend nothing in derogation of Miss Freer's moral and
intellectual qualifications. Miss Freer's testimony to ghostly sights and
sounds fails to impress because she is liable, in a quite unusual degree,
to hallucinatory experience, and because many of her hallucinations, as
she has herself shown in her article on Crystal Vision (Proceedings V.,
pp. 486 el seq.), are purely subjective, being merely the recrudescence
of previous sensory or intellectual experiences. Miss Freer is not, of
course, responsible for this mental idiosyncrasy, but, obviously, it seriously
impairs the value of her testimony to experiences which owe their in
terest, for most readers, solely to the presumption that they may not
be of a purely hallucinatory order, but may possibly have their origin in
telepathic or even extra-human sources. But we are entitled to ask why
Miss Freer does not apply to her visions in " haunted " houses the same
canons which she has applied with conspicuous success to her visions in the
crystal. When, to take a well-known case, Miss Freer saw in the crystal a
vision of a sea-shore succeeded by the vision of a huge mouse (Proceedings
H 2
100 Frank Podmore. [Supplement.
V., p. 512), she found the explanation of the incongruous spectacle in the
revival of subconscious images called up in her mind a few days before by
two lines of poetry :—
" Only the sea intoning,
Only the wainscoat mouse."
Now consider the following experience in B House. " In the
afternoon (February 6th, 1897) an experiment was made with the apparatus
known as a Ouija board, and this, as is very often the case, resolved itself,
after a time, into automatic writing. There is in the library a portrait of a
very handsome woman, to which no name is attached, but which shows the
costume of the last century. Her name was asked, and the word ' Ishbel '
was given several times. ... In reply to questions as to what could be
done that was of use and interest, the writers were told to go at dusk, and
in silence, to the glen in the avenue, and this, rightly or wrongly, some of
those present identified with what had been called Scamp's Copse " (i.e., a
small fir plantation, at which the dog had twice already barked uneasily).
They went to the copse accordingly, and Miss Freer saw there, in the dusk,
the figure of a nun. Upon this Miss Freer builds a theory of the identity
of the nun with the Ishbel named by Ouija ; but as the figure seen did not
correspond with the portrait already referred to, she finds the original of
her vision in one Isabella (Gaelic, Ishbel), a sister of a former owner of the
house, who had actually taken the veil. Again, since the figure of the nun
as seen did not apparently tally with the figure of the lady whom it was
assumed to represent, the theory is still further elaborated by the assump
tion that the figure seen by Miss Freer reflected the (hypothetical) mental
picture of the real nun formed in the mind of a former inmate of the house,
who had never seen the lady in the flesh ! (p. 226, etc.) For myself, I
can more easily believe that the nun, like the mouse, had her birth in the
percipient's imagination.
Whatever view we take of the matter, it is a point of some interest that
two witnesses—one other lady and one man, the Rev. Mr. Q.,—after they
had heard what Miss Freer had seen, saw the nun in her company ; and
that several persons, when the burn was running, hoard the nun and her
companion conversing. The only other experience of evidential importance
was the vision of a crucifix, seen independently by the Rev. Mr. Q., Miss
Freer, and a gentleman who had stayed in the house some years previously.
The account of the last named, however, is given some years after the
incident, and after he had heard of the later experiences.
It should be added that Miss Freer saw one or two other human figures,
and dogs, about the house at various times ; that a servant also saw a
figure, and that a visitor, Miss Langton, had a dream in which she saw
the figure of a man, afterward recognised from her description. Of the
pulling off of bedclothes, the feeling of chill, the sensation of a presence, and
other vague feelings of the kind, it is hardly necessary to speak.
The phenomena ceased after a service performed by a Bishop on the
morning of May 6th.

Neurypnology : or, The Rationale of Nervous Sleep considered in, relation to
Animal Magnetism or Mesmerism, and illustrated by Numerous Cases of
its successful Application in the Relief and Cure of Disease. By James
Braid, M.R.C.S., C.M.W.S., etc. A New Edition, edited with an
Introduction Biographical and Bibliographical embodying the Author's
later Views and further Evidence on the Subject. By Arthur Edward
Waite. (London : George Redway ; 1899.)
The above work comprises : (1) a biographical introduction, which gives
a short account of Braid's life, and a more extended one of his writings ;
(2) a reproduction of the original edition of NeuryImology, which forms the
greater bulk of the volume ; (3) an appendix of editorial notes chiefly drawn
from Braid's later works ; and (4) a bibliography of Braid's writings.
According to Mr. Waite little is known about Braid in this country, and
there is no trustworthy bibliography of his writings. His later works, rare
and almost unknown, have been traced with difficulty. Mr. Waite, however,
claims to have been successful in his researches, and presents, as their
result, a work on Braid which he asserts to be substantially complete.
Mr. Waite has undoubtedly rendered a service to hypnotic literature, but
he has not made the most of the material collected, and his work is neither
as complete nor as accurate as he believes it to be. The following are a few,
amongst many, objections which might be urged against it. Thus, we are
told that the discovery of hypnotism alone lifted Braid out of the groove of
the ordinary practitioner. This is incorrect. Before he discovered hypno
tism, Braid had operated on 262 cases of Talipes, 700 cases of Strabismus,
and 23 cases of Spinal Curvature, and his reputation as a surgeon attracted
patients from all parts of the country.
Although Nenrypnology is historically interesting, it must not be
forgotten that it was written almost immediately after Braid commenced
his hypnotic work, and that later his views underwent a complete change.
The French translation of Nenrypnology is more valuable than Mr. Waite's
reprint, as in an appendix of 36 pages it gives a full translation of Braid's
last manuscript, containing a summary of his more matured theories. This
is barely referred to by Mr. Waite.
Some passages show a somewhat unusual want of care in compilation.
Thus (pages 317 to 319) a case of torticollis cured by suggestion is recorded
at length, and we are told that a year later there had been no relapse. The
case is repeated (pages 343 to 344) along with the fresh statement that
"whether the cure was permanent does not appear from the narrative."
The bibliography, to which Mr. Waite attaches great importance, only
imperfectly reproduces those I myself published at earlier dates (Brain,
Part LXXIII., Spring, 1896 ; Proceedings of the Society for Psychical
Rtxearch, Part XXX., June, 1896; Reene de VHypnotisme, June, 1898).
In seven of the works referred to by Mr Waite, the title is wrong or
incomplete ; in twenty-one, quoted from medical journals, neither volume
nor page is given. The only new material is two unimportant letters in
reply to one from "James Simpson, Esq., Advocate," erroneously described
by Mr. Waite as "James Singer," while in my bibliographies are to be
found nine of Braid's writings which are omitted from Mr. Waite's.
102 ./. Milne Bram well. [Supplement.
Further, some of Braid's works, of which Mr. Waite has been unable to
trace a single copy, have long been in my possession.
According to Mr. Waite, Braid's connection with the debated subject
of phrenology terminated with the phreno-hypnotic experiments recorded
in " Keurypnulogy." The subject, we are told, remains where he left it,
while Dr. Foveau de Oourmelle's verdict, viz., that the phenomena are
as likely to bo the result of real action as of unconscious suggestion, is
accepted by the unprejudiced. Mr. Waite is ignorant of, or ignores,
Braid's later experiments. From these Braid concluded that all phreno
logical phenomena were the result of direct or indirect suggestion, and
arose either from a previous knowledge of phrenology, or from a system
of training during hypnosis. They manifested themselves when points
were touched which audible suggestion had taught the subjects to associate
with particular ideas. Further, pressure upon the head was not necessary,
and the associations could be established in the same artificial way between
the phenomena and other parts of the body. Finally, the excitation of the
muscles of expression was capable of arousing corresponding ideas in the
subject's mind.
It is certainly surprising to be told at the present day that the phenomena
of phrenology are as likely as not to be genuine.
Mr. Waite's account of Braid's views on mesmerism or animal magnetism
demands serious notice. Formerly, according to him, it was generally but
erroneously believed that Braid opposed animal magnetism ; thanks, how
ever, to French writers, this error has been rectified. Braid was the
champion and witness of animal magnetism, and placed the central fact of
mesmerism beyond all further dispute. In opposition to this, it is to be
noted, and the point cannot be too strongly insisted upon, that the primary
and cardinal fact upon which Braid founded all his theories of hypnotism
was the purely subjective origin of its phenomena. Everything depended
on the physical and mental condition of the patient ; not on the volition
or passes of the operator which threw out magnetism, or called into action
some occult fluid or medium. Braid never swerved from this view. Later
he repeated it more emphatically and demonstrated experimentally that all
the phenomena attributed to magnets, metals, drugs in sealed tubes, could
bo equally well produced by direct or indirect suggestion when the exciting
agents were absent. Thus, a wooden magnet acted like a real one when
the subject was deceived as to its nature, whereas a genuine one produced
nothing if the subject did not know it was there.
According to Mr. Waite, " The metalo-therapeutic theory first discovered
by Burq and developed by Charcot, inaugurated a new era of hypnotism,
and led to that long series of researches connected with the Salpetriere
School of Paris, which have done so much to obscure, if not indeed to
tarnish, the rival lustre of the Nancy School of Lie'bault. "
This view of metallo-therapeutics is many years too late. The views of
Burq, which were shared by F.lliotson and the mesmerists of his day, were
successfully combatted by Braid. Charcot simply revived an old fallacy,
which the Nancy School, following in Braid's footsteps, again overthrew.
As far back as the International Congress of Psychology of 1892 the
Charcot theories had practically ceased to excite scientific interest.
Part xxxvi.] Review. 103
According to Mr. Waite, " It has been rightly observed that Braid, the
discoverer, so to speak, of suggestion, by no means fully realised the
possibilities of suggestion of the unconscious kind." Bernheim, and other
writers unacquainted with Braid's later works, had previously made similar
statements. It is difficult, however, to understand how Mr. Waite could
commit a like error. Braid repeatedly, clearly and emphatically pointed
out that unconscious suggestion accounted for all the phenomena which the
mesmerists attributed to magnets, metals, and occult fluids. Sometimes, he
said, the suggestions were given in their most obvious form by the operator
verbally predicting in the subject's hearing the nature of the phenomena
which ought to appear. At others they were given less directly by passes,
manipulations, excitation of the muscles of expression, etc., but these owed
their power, not to their physical influence, but to the ideas thoy excited in
the subject's mind. When all forms of suggestion were rigorously excluded
the mesmeric phenomena did not appear. This, Braid asserted, proved the
influence was a mental one ; were it electric, suggestions were as unnecessary
in the case of the subject as in that of a galvanic battery.
Apparently Mr. Waite believes in animal magnetism, metallo-therapeutics
and phrenology. All these things Braid successfully combatted, and to
attribute to him any belief in their existence shows an absolute failure to
grasp the spirit and significance of his teaching.

My Experience of Hypnotic Suggestion as a Therapeutic Agent. By Hon.
J. M. Creed, M.L.O., M.R.C.S. Eng., L.R.C.P. Edin., Sydney.
(Sydney, 1899.)
This paper is reprinted from Tlie Australian Medical Gazette, of January
20th, 1899, and was originally read before the N.S.W. Branch of the British
Medical Association, on December 23rd, 1898. The author is a well-known
medical man and a member of the Legislative Council of New South Wales,
so his views demand attention. He has been using hypnotism in his
practice for some years, and he recalls his experience in this pamphlet.
The interest of the paper is almost entirely medical, and, like Professor
Bernheim of Nancy, the author hypnotises patients for all kinds of diseases,
and finds suggestion relieves symptoms, even where it does not cure the
disease. For instance, in a case of pleurisy, accompanied by much pain, he
was able to give entire relief by suggestion, and it was only by the per
sistence of the physical signs that he was able to assure himself that the
pathological condition still existed. As he points out, the control of pain is
a very important matter in many cases, for pain lowers vitality, prevents
sleep, and retards recovery. This is especially the case in surgery, where
mental and bodily repose are greatly conducive to satisfactory and rapid
repair. Dr. Creed is quite enthusiastic about the effect of suggestion in
gastric ulcer. Here, he thinks, it acts by enabling the patient to take
nourishment freely without pain, and so cures the ulcers by improving
the state of the blood and raising the tone of the system.
On several occasions the patient has, in the absence of the surgeon,
been able to control pain by inducing amesthesia by a prearranged signal.
104 Dr. Charles Lloyd Tuckey. [Supplement.
For instance, Mr. H. burnt his hand severely with molten and flaming
" Chatterton's compound," the melting point of which is very much higher
than that of sealing-wax. By placing the forefinger of his left hand to his
lips he was able to inhibit the sensory nerves, and though the injury was
followed by deep ulceration, he felt no pain while the wound was healing.
Pain, of course, serves a useful purpose, and is Nature's danger-signal
to direct attention and care to the part. Without it, serious injury might
be done without the subject being aware of it, as sometimes happens in
hysterical and paralysed persons. But pain is nearly always in excess of
requirements, and it is a great blessing to be able to control it.
Dr. Creed seems to have been very successful in asthma, and he men
tions a curious experience in this disease. The patient was a clerk in a
Government office, and had suffered from asthma for 14 years. Hypnotism
greatly relieved her, and she only got attacks when she took cold. When
away from Sydney, she used to write to the doctor and ask him to send
directions by telegraph, and these suggestions always gave her relief. On
one occasion he was away, and her friends arranged that a telegram should
be sent as if from him in reply to her note. It failed to relieve her, as she
said she knew somehow it was not genuine. On his return ho sent another
telegram, and that proved successful. It is difficult to believe that the
curative agency was anything but expectant attention and suggestion in this
case, and one would like to know if there was not something in the form of
the first telegram or in the behaviour of her friends which aroused the
patient's suspicions.
Dr. Creed has treated many bad cases of alcoholism with great success ;
and he says that no one who is a good hypnotic subject need suffer from
sea-sickness.
Like all medical hypnotists, Dr. Creed finds his best subjects among the
intellectual and healthy-minded classes, and he even says that he has
generally found hysterical women are not hypnotisable. He is strongly of
opinion that the dangers of hypnotism are overstated, and he contends that
a hypnotised person cannot be made to do anything opposed to his waking
conscience. There we must beg to differ from Dr. Creed, and we think it is
much better not to minimise the dangers of hypnotism, but to look them in
the face and take the proper precautions against them. Granted that a
person of strong principle cannot be induced to commit a crime whilst in the
hypnotic state, or by means of post-hypnotic suggestion ; but we know that
many people only refrain from doing evil from expediency or fear. These are
the weak-kneed people who are often too easily influenced without hypno
tism. By suggestion with hypnotism the power to influence them is greatly
increased, and the danger of this fact is not decreased by ignoring it. The
remedy is, of course, easy. Let hypnotism be used with the same pre
cautions as surround the administration of chloroform or laughing gas.
There is one other feature of Dr. Creed's excellent paper which we think
might be amended with advantage. It is too much a record of success, and
though he disclaims considering hypnotism a universal panacea, we should
like to be told what proportion of failures he has met with. However, in
this respect Dr. Creed is in good professional company, for medical men who
write on their special subject are notoriously optimistic.
PartxxxvLi Review. 105
It must be a matter of gratification to the Society for Psychical Research
to see one of the subjects Edmund Gurney and its other founders did so
much to bring to the front now occupying a recognised and honourable
position as a therapeutic agent. This is shown by such papers as this by
Dr. Creed, and is a sign of the times.

The Effects of Mind on Body as Evidenced by Faith Cures. By Henry H.
Goddard, A.M., Fellow in Psychology, Clark University. (The
American Journal of Psychology, Vol. X., No. 3 ; April, 1899, pp.
431-502.)
The author here presents "a brief survey of the field, that portion of
the data which is of most psychological interest, and some of the con
clusions, from an extended study of mental therapeutics. We hope to
present in a later publication an extended report of all the work referred
to." The material was gathered through answers to a syllabus, personal
interviews and investigations with various "healers " and their patients, and
from the literature of the various sects, —for the author uses " Faith Cures "
as comprehending the various forms of distinctive suggestion treatment.
Christian Scientists are largely considered, including a sketch of their
leader, Mrs. Eddy ; "Divine Healers" are followed up in the large move
ment of Dr. Dowie, of Chicago, and the itinerant Schlatter ; and " Mental
Science " as the most reasonable form, through its founder, Dr. Quimby.
The author's "result of this investigation, extending over more than two
years, is the absolute conviction based upon experience, only one or two
items of which we can give here, that the curative principle in every one of
the forms is found in the influence of the mind of the patient on his body.
In other words, however different the claims and the method, the explana
tion of all is the same." These religious forms of suggestion are then
compared with cases in the practice of regular physicians and in hypnotism.
After a review of the failures and limitations of the faith cures, the con
clusion is that their "greatest field is in the realm of prevention" (p. 499),
and that "suggestive therapeutics must take its place by the side of drugs
rather than to assume to supersede them." (p. 488.) The concluding
psychological discussion is extremely valuable. Thus the whole article is
the most timely, interesting and able study that has appeared in this fruit
ful field since Dr. and Mr. Myers's Mind-Cure, Faith-Cure, and the Miracles
of Lourdes (Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. IX., p. 160), which the present study
has unfortunately not mentioned, together with the several other studies on
this subject in the Proceedings S.P. R. But a wide circle of students await
Mr. Goddard's complete report with impatient eagerness. „ n

L'Annie Psychologique, Cinquiime Annie. (Paris, Schleicher Freres.)
L'Anne'e Psychologique for 1899 is an even more striking monument of
scientific diligence and fecundity than the previous volumes have been.
The contributors of important articles, besides those by MM. Binet and
i '
106 F. W. H. Myers. [Supplement.
Henri, are perhaps this year more numerous than usual. But the amount
of work done by these two savants,—the Editor and the Secretaire de
Redaction,— in the way both of original experiment and of accurate and
critical analysis of the work of others—seems rather to increase than to
diminish. Most strongly must it be said that the volume is an indispensable
aid to any student of Psychology.
Yet although this may be truly affirmed, it is only fair to add that in
some cases the subjects of research seem scarcely of sufficient importance
to occupy for long the attention of scientific minds. The elaborate Biblio
graphy contains the titles of 2,558 books or articles connected with
Psychology which appeared in 1898. This list represents a great mass of
intellectual effort, from which, perhaps, fewer leading ideas have in fact
emerged than might have been hoped in an age where really illuminating
generalisations in science are wont to be so promptly pursued.
There are two papers, both of them from M. Binet's indefatigable pen,
which bear on subjects which have been discussed in these Proceedings : one
is on Suggestibility, one on "L'illusion de fausse reconnaissance," for which
I have elsewhere suggested the name Promnesia. To speak frankly, both
these papers seem to me to illustrate a tendency which runs through all
this mass of work,—a tendency to treat the easy parts of the subject with
completeness and mastery, and to ignore altogether those diffictdt parts
which we in these Proceedings do make honest, if not always convincing,
efforts to explain. Thus, the article on Suggestibility sets forth clearly and
ingeniously a number of causes which predispose to the supraliminal recep
tion of suggestion ; but it scarcely even touches on the profounder puzzles
of their subliminal reception,—apart from the conscious knowledge of the
subject, and beyond the domain of his conscious will.
Characteristically enough, we find in the course of this article a long
analysis of an everyday experiment of Professor Patrick's in automatic
script, but of Mrs. Piper's trance-writings—from which that very paper of
Professor Patrick's takes its rise—not a word. The easy thing is additionally
explained ; the difficult problem—Dr. Hodgson's Report —remains as item
1,249 in the Bibliography without further notice.
With the article on the deja vu—paramnesia or promnesia—the case is
somewhat similar. The conclusion reached on p. 742 is merely the obvious
common-sense one which explains most of the recorded phenomena—but
not all. " The memory which is renewed has made a part of another con
scious state—call it A—at the moment when it was stored up in the mind,
whereas the subject, when he recalls the memory, is in conscious state B.
On account of the analogy between the two states, the earlier perception A
becomes fused into the actual perception B ;—the two syntheses are brought
thus into a sort of collision. The Group A tends more or less to reconstitute
itself, in spite of the antagonism of the Group B ; there is a struggle, a
competition, between two different conscious states, resulting in a dis
tressing sense of duplication, of loss of personality. One feels oneself
changed and no longer the same, because the forgotten Group A recovers
activity and tries to supplant the actual Group B."
M. Binet does not claim originality, except of expression, for this
explanation, which is, in fact, obviously sufficient for the commoner cases.
PartxxxvL] Review. 107
"We may lay aside," he says, "the hypothesis of cerebral duality due
to Wigan, and that of telepathy due to Lalande ;—this latter hypothesis,
m fact, is so extraordinary (tellement bizarre) that one cannot understand
how it can have been put forward in our times." (Let readers who do
not think it worth while to send us fresh evidence for telepathy, because
they suppose that every one admits it, note that last phrase !)
Well, it may be that neither telepathy nor cerebral duality in any form
is really needed here ;—but if M. Binet wishes to make certain of this,
he should first manage to dispose in some way or other of some of the most
remarkable of the cases which he himself cites. If, for example, J. H.,
the military doctor, did in truth repeat phrases from Ferdinand le Noceur,
before they were uttered by the actors,—as Lalande tells us, —what is M.
Binet's explanation for that 1
I certainly cannot complain if M. Binet, with all he has to read, has
not read pp. 340-347 of Vol. IX. of the S.P.R. Proceedings. Nor can
I expect that anything which I have there advanced is at all a final solution
of these puzzles. Nevertheless, our psychology is hardly yet so profound
that it suffices to set forth with clarity ingenious deductions from what we
already know. The history of far less complex studies should teach us that
it is dangerous to assume too soon that any given science has for us no more

Argument.
1. Psychical Research is no longer felt to need the recommendation'
of names independently eminent in other branches of study.
2. Yet if recognition is to be paid primarily to actual work per
formed for our Research, the name of Edmund Gurney must occur as
that which all would fain have honoured ;—the man whose attitude
towards our Research was of the loftiest, the most unselfish kind ; the
man who felt most strongly the sheer moral need of discovering a
future life, if the cruel injustices of this life are to be conceived as
compatible with a First Cause worthy of love or worship.
3. For most men the quest of immortality will answer to a stronger
element of personal desire ;—although such desire need not imply bias
in the estimation of evidence.
4. No attachment to Christian tradition, no recognition of the need
and value of high intuitions, should blind us to the fact that only on
truths scientifically demonstrated can a world-philosophy or world-
religion be based.
5. Yet the facts proved by Science have not thus far been adequate
to satisfy the spiritual needs of mankind. May not Science discover-
further facts which may at any rate prove the preamble of all religions ?
6. Such is our attempt ;—for we believe that by maintaining unity of
method in our search for every form of truth we have the best chance
of discovering new facts of deep spiritual importance.
7. And, in fact, this line of inquiry has already pointed us to a
hidden, subliminal world within us,—and through that world to an un
seen, but responsive, spiritual world without.
8. And if the messages from that unseen world be felt at present
to be inadequate to our desires, yet our faith in the coherence and
intelligibility of at least the material universe should lead us to trust
that clarity and dignity cannot be permanently lacking in any system
of communications which may proceed from the Universe of Spirit.
9. We seem, indeed, to be awakening into a new consciousness
of the living solidarity of the human race, in this world and the

next, which will afford an adequate motive for utmost effort and
highest hope.
10. But if we are thus to gain the advantage of scientific certainty
for our deepest beliefs, we are bound in return to treat the scientific
virtues as necessary to salvation.
11. The especial function of the Society for Psychical Research
should be to insist upon this view, and to form an advisory centre for
widespread investigation.
12. For aid in this task we can address our claim alike to the
scientific and to the religious world ; our wider Science, of which
Religion is the subjective aspect, must come not to destroy, but to
fulfil.
1. When I heard, in absence from England, that the Council of
this Society had done me the honour of electing me as its President for
the current year, I felt that a certain definite stage in the Society's
evolution had been reached at an earlier date than I should originally
have expected.
My predecessors in this Chair, I need not say, have, without excep
tion, been men of the highest distinction. The list has included men
whose leadership would confer honour on any body of men whatever ;- -
on such bodies, for instance, as the British Association or the House of
Commons. We have been grateful to these eminent persons for lending
the sanction of their names to our early beginnings. And we have other
names in reserve of similar distinction ;—destined, I hope, some day to
adorn our list of Presidents. Yet for the current year the Council
have preferred to choose a man who has little claim to such a dis
tinction, beyond the fact that he has worked for the objects which
our Society seeks, from days even before the Society's formation ;—
and that he is determined to go on thus working so long as his
faculties may allow. So have our friends chosen ; and if a man may
speak thus of his own election, I think that the choice is appropriate
enough. For the time has come when we may fairly indicate to the
world that we believe our Society can stand on its own bottom ; that
it carries on a branch of scientific work which, although novel and
tentative, is legitimate and honourable ; and therefore that we do
not need to put forward in its prominent positions only those names
which have been made independently illustrious by good work of other
kinds performed elsewhere. As representing the principle that the
plain, unadorned Psychical Researcher is just as respectable in his own
way as anybody else, I am proud indeed to see my humbler name
inscribed after the names of Henry Sidgwick, Balfour Stewart, Arthur
Balfour, William James, and William Crookes.
L
112 F. W. H. Myers. [pakt
2. But here one thought must rise ;—must rise for all who knew the
early days of this research, but most of all for me ;—-Would that
Edmund Gurney were standing where I stand now ! For us who knew
him best the years since he left us have but served to illustrate his
uniqueness and to deepen his memory ;—have made us feel how much
of the humorous adventure, the sympathetic fellowship, the deep delight
of this research of ours has with him passed irrevocably away. On
the lighter side of things, we can never renew the intellectual enjoy
ment of those years of our small beginnings spent at his side ;—watch
ing how his flashing irony, his fearless dialectic, dealt with the attacks
which then poured in from every quarter ;—with the floundering
platitudes of obscurantist orthodoxy, or with the smug sneers of popular
science, belittling what it will not try to understand. On the graver
side, we shall hardly see another example of just that attitude of mind
with which Gurney entered on this research,—and which made for us
so deep an element in his incomparable charm.
For in that many-chorded nature sympathy was the deepest strain ;—
sympathy which flowed forth indeed to those he loved in such penetrat
ing and intimate tenderness as few mortals have had the happiness to
know,—but which expended itself more widely in a profound compas
sion for the multiform sorrows of men. And thus, as needs must
happen in those responsive minds which hear, in the Apostle's words,
the whole creation groaning and travailing until now, there came to
him the conviction that the question of life after death was the only
test which we could really apply to the existence of a Providence ;—
nay, that it was no mere articulus stantis aut cadentis Ecclesue, but in
sombre earnest, for all humankind, the articulus stantis aut cadentis
Dei. Strangely enough, it was for others rather than for himself that
Gurney desired this great possibility ; his own mournful and stoic
temper dwelt little on any personal hope. But he felt that if the First
Cause has summoned into life on earth, though it were but one single
man alone, miserable amid all the happy;—one single soul foredoomed to
eternal protest and inescapable woe ;—then that First Cause is not a God
to whom a good man can offer love, or a just man worship. Alas ! how
many theologies does this clear moral axiom shrivel as with burning fire !
how many philosophies does it scatter to the winds !—philosophies of
men walking delicately on wordy bridges across the grim abyss of things,
—satisfied that the world is well enough, while round them wronged,
degraded lives by millions are perishing in agony and for ever. It was
in response to such easy optimism that Gurney's logic was the most
intolerably trenchant, his sombre silence the fullest of sad scorn ;—
for in truth this contented blindness of sealed spirits is in itself the
vilest woe of man. He could not avert his eyes, and disport himself
in a fool's Paradise. He could not weave a web of words, and stifle
xxxvu.] Presidential Address. 113
in a philosopher's dream. Suffer me to apply to my friend for a
moment even those lofty lines in which a great poet has invoked the
greatest :—
"Thou that seest universal Nature moved hy universal Mind ;
Thou, majestic in thy sadness at the doubtful doom of humankind."
3. It is well that this noble figure should stand at the entrance of
our research ;—should show how unselfish may be the impulse which
has prompted to eager labour,—eager even beyond the limit which
physical powers allowed. But assuredly the mass of us Psychical
Researchers have no need whatever of heroic virtue. We have enough
and to spare of such motives as appeal to ordinary men. We have the
stimulus of intellectual curiosity,—more richly satisfied, I think, in ours
than in any other quest ;—and beyond this most of us, I think, have the
healthful, primary desire for the prolongation—the endless prolongation
—of life and happiness. I know, indeed, that for various reasons some men
of strong and high nature, as well as many men of feebler nature, do fail
to feel this desire; but on the whole one must regard that form of Wdt-
Schrwrz as but a passing mood of our race's immaturity,—as what
physicians call a neurosis of development ;—one must admit that usually
when a man cares little for existence this is because existence cares
little for him, and that it has been doubt as to the value of life and love
which has made the decadence of almost all civilisations. Life is the
final aim of life ; the mission of the highest Teacher was that we
might have it the more abundantly ; and the universe strives best
towards its ultimate purpose through the normal, vigorous spirit to
whom to live itself is joy.
The danger, then, for our research will lie not in lack but in excess
of motive ; our minds may be biassed in their judgment of evidence by
a deep instinctive desire. For my own part, I certainly cannot claim
such impartiality as indifference might bring. From my earliest child
hood—from my very first recollections—the desire for eternal life has
immeasurably eclipsed for me every other wish or hope. Yet desire is
not necessarily bias ; and my personal history has convinced myself—
though I cannot claim that it shall convince others also—that my
wishes do not strongly warp my judgment,—nay, that sometimes the
very keenness of personal anxiety may make one afraid to believe, as
readily as other men, that which one most longs for.
For when, after deriving much happiness from Christian faith, I felt
myself forced by growing knowledge to recognise that the evidence for
that culminant instance of spirit return was not adequate, as standing
alone, to justify conviction, I did honestly surrender that great joy ;
although its loss was more grievous to me than anything else which has
happened to me in life.
l 2
114 F. W. H. Myers. [part
Then with little hope—nay, almost with reluctant scorn—but with
the feeling that no last and least chance of the great discovery should
be thrown aside, I turned to such poor efforts at psychical research as
were at that time possible ; and now it is only after thirty years of
such study as I have been able to give that I say to myself at last,
JIabes totd quod mente petisti—"Thou hast what thine whole heart
desired ; "—that I recognise that for me this fresh evidence,—while
raising that great historic incident of the Resurrection into new
credibility,—has also filled me with a sense of insight and of thankful
ness such as even my first ardent Christianity did not bestow.
Yet if I thus find the happiness which sprang from far-reaching
Tradition and Intuition surpassed by the happiness which springs from
a narrower, but a more stable range of demonstrated fact, I nevertheless
speak in no spirit of reaction or of ingratitude towards traditions and
intuitions which must yet, for many a century, be potent for the
salvation of men. I by no means take for granted that any
scientific inquiry, any induction from empirical facts, can afford
to man his only or his deepest insight into the meaning of
the Universe. I have no controversy with those who say that
contemplation, revelation, ecstasy, may carry deep into certain
hearts an even profounder truth. I recognise also that our Science is
a conventional structure ; that it rests on assumptions which we cannot
fully prove ; or which even indicate, by their apparent inconsistency,
that they can be at best but narrow aspects of some underlying
law imperfectly discerned. All this we may all admit ; just as we
admit the inadequacy, the conventionality, of human speech itself.
Speech cannot match the meaning which looks in an hour of emotion
from the eyes of a friend. But what we learn from that gaze is
indefinable and incommunicable. Our race needed the spoken and
written word, with all its baldness, if they were to understand each
other and to grow to be men. So with Science as opposed to Intuition
Science forms a language common to all mankind ; she can explain
herself when she is misunderstood and right herself when she goes
wrong ; nor has humanity yet found, at any rate, since that great
wedding between Reason and Experience, which immortalises the name
of Galileo,—that the methods of Science, intelligently and honestly
followed, have led us in the end astray.
It is only in the region of inquiry into a spiritual world—I mean a
world of immaterial and yet individual realities—that these truisms are
still in danger of being taken for paradoxes. At once the intimate
interest and the extreme obscurity of that investigation have long
prevented it from being kept fully and fairly in that scientific field
where man's attempts at all other knowledge are now collected and
appraised. In their rude beginnings, no doubt, Religion and Science
xxxvii ] Presidential Address. 115
were indistinguishable. The savage observed such scanty facts as he
could get at, and tried to shape both his practical and his spiritual life
upon that observation. But his need of a theory of the unseen world
(to put his vague hopes and terrors into our own phraseology) went far
beyond what his scraps of experience could teach him. " What must
1 do to be saved 1 " was a question to which he could not find, yet
would not wait for an answer. He fell into grotesque fancies, which
his experience did not really support ; and the divorce of Religion from
Science at once began.
The spiritual need which thus acted on the savage continues to act
on the civilised man. He too is impelled to build his faith on grounds
outside his sphere of observation, to enlarge the safe, general, and per
manent formula for religion in various more or less unsafe, specialised,
and transitory ways. For it is—may one not say 1—a safe, general, and
permanent formula for religion if we regard it as man's normal sub
jective response to the sum of known cosmic phenomena taken as an
intelligible whole. Under the title of Natural Religion this forms
at least an element in all the higher forms of faith. Nevertheless it is
felt to be inadequate ; because the observable phenomena of the
Universe, so far at least as they have yet been observed, have not been
such as to evoke (save in some few minds) the full hope, the full
devotion which our developed nature yearns to feel. To live by
Natural Religion alone has been like living on turnips in the field.
Most men demand their spiritual nutriment in a more assimilable form.
The philosophical or the poetical contemplation of Nature has not
satisfied them in the past ; nor can they hope that the scientific con
templation of Nature will satisfy them any better now. They turn
aside from the ambiguous pageant, the circumspect scrutiny ; they
specialise the name of Religion upon some clear, swift, extra-scientific
knowledge as to the dealings of unseen Powers with mankind.
On such knowledge, or supposed knowledge, the peoples of East and
West have stayed in many fashions their soul's desire ; but, neverthe
less, we all know too well that even yet there is no spiritual food
attainable in the precise condition in which it will meet all healthy
needs. We are all forced to feel that in the present divided and un
stable condition of beliefs there is plausibility in the Agnostic's appeal
to us to halt and mark time ; in his insistence that we have not really
evidence, up to modern standards, which can support any definite creed
in matters remote from ordinary methods of proof. Some men, indeed,
have ventured explicitly to reply that Christian Faith need not be
founded on the same kind of demonstration as Science ; that Tradition
and Intuition can well supply her outward form and her inward glow.
Urged among those who have much of consecrated tradition, of noble
intuition in common, this high claim may seem convincing as the gaze
116 F.W.H. Myers. [part
of a friend. But it has the inevitable weakness already indicated.
Introduce other persons of different race but equally sincere, the
Buddhist, the Parsee, the Jew—nay, the saint of science, like Darwin
—and you can meet these men no longer on the ground of Christian
Tradition or Intuition—you can meet them on the ground of Science
alone. Thus even among spiritually-minded men we seem forced back
into the view that Science can be the only world-philosophy or world-
religion ; —the only synthesis of the Universe which, however imperfect,
is believed in semper, ubique, et ab omnibus, by all who can under
stand it.
5. This conclusion, however, as already implied, at present satisfies
nobody. The Christian says that it is mere mockery to pretend that
Science can be the base of Religion ; for it tells us nothing of the
spiritual world. " Naturally," replies the Agnostic, hardening into
Materialism; "since there is no spiritual world of which to tell."
" The Universe," cried Clifford triumphantly, " is made of ether and
atoms, and there is no room for ghosts."
So soon, however, as the man of science takes this tone—so soon as
he passes, so to say, from Huxley to Clifford—he loses his strong
position, the Agnostic's raison d'etre. Clifford had not really turned
over his atoms thoroughly enough to make sure that no ghost was
hidden among them. As indisputably as any worshipper of Mumbo-
Jumbo had that eager truth-lover framed an emotional synthesis which
outran his Science.
Is, then, the passivity of pure Agnosticism the attitude with which
we ought to be content I Ignoramus et ignorabimus—should this be
the single clause of our creed ? Surely that were too tame a surrender
to the Sphinx and her riddle ; which, in the old story, turned out after
all to be rather easy to guess. Why should we not simply try to find
out new facts here, as we have found out new facts everywhere else
where we have looked for them 1 Just here we have not looked for
them yet, because neither the priests of our religions nor their critics
have till now been disposed for the quest. The priests have thought it
safest to defend their own traditions, their own intuitions, without going
afield in search of independent evidence of a spiritual world. Their
assailants have kept their powder and shot for the orthodox ramparts,
ignoring any isolated strongholds which formed no part of the main
line of defence.
This search for new facts is precisely what our Society undertakes.
Starting from various standpoints, we endeavour to carry the newer,
the intellectual virtues into regions where dispassionate tranquillity has
seldom yet been known. As compared with the claims of Theologians,
we set before ourselves a humbler, yet a difficult task. We do not seek
to shape the clauses of the great Act of Faith, but merely to prove its
xxxvn.] Presidential Address. 117
preamble. To prove the preamble of all religions; to be able to say to
theologian or to philosopher : " Thus and thus we demonstrate that a
spiritual world exists—a world of independent and abiding realities,
not a mere ' epiphenomenon ' or transitory effect of the material
world—a world of things, concrete and living, not a mere system of
abstract ideas ;—now, therefore, reason on that world or feel towards it
as you will." This would indeed, in my view, be the weightiest service
which any research could render to the deep disquiet of our time ;—
nay, to the dexklerium orbis catholici, the world-old and world-wide
desire.
6. First, then, we adopt the ancient belief—implied in all mono
theistic religion, and conspicuously confirmed by the progress of modern
science—that the world as a whole, spiritual and material together, has
in some way a systematic unity ; and on this we base the novel pre
sumption that there should be a unity of method in the investigation of
all fact. We hold therefore that the attitude, the habits of mind, the
methods, by aid of which physical science has grown deep and wide,
should be applied also to the spiritual world. We endeavour to
approach the problems of that world by careful collection, scrutiny,
testing, of particular facts ; and we account no unexplained fact too
trivial for our attention. Seeking knowledge before edification, we aim
not at what we should most like to learn, but at what we have the best
chance of learning ; we dabble among beggarly elements ; we begin at
the beginning.
Into this frame of mind the long habit of our race in matters
religious has made it difficult fully to enter. I have found it helpful
to imagine what would be the procedure of some extraneous inquirer
into the nature and fate of men—some inquirer exempt from their
hopes, their fears, their presuppositions.
Let us suppose, then, that "a spectator of all time and all existence,"
a kind of minor Cosmotheorus, as Plato might call him, were speculating
from the standpoint of this planet, as to what was likely to be the true
position of the human race in the scheme of the Universe. Such an
ohserver would be compelled to start from the facts before him. He
would begin his investigation, therefore, not with God but with man.
He would analyse the faculties of which he found man possessed, and
would infer in what environment they were designed to operate—of
what system, that is to say, of cosmic laws, expressing a special
modification of the ultimate energy, the energy contained in the human
race formed an integral element. His first discovery would be that the
obvious material environment, which is all that most men know, does
not exhaust the faculties nor cover the phenomena of human life.
Most of man's senses, indeed, he could explain as concerned solely
with matter. Sight he could not thus explain ; and the study
118 F. W. H. Myers. [part
of light would lead him to discover the etherial environment—a system
of laws, that is to say, which, while fundamentally continuous with the
laws of matter, doas yet supply a new conception of the Cosmos, at
once more generalised and more profound. But still the central
problem of man's being would remain unsolved. Life and thought
could not be referred to the working either of aggregated molecules or
of etherial undulations. To explain Life by these two environ
ments would be as impossible as it had been to explain Light by
the material environment alone. Might there not be yet another
environment—metetherial, spiritual, what you will ? Was there any
way of reducing this vast and vague problem of Life to manageable
definiteness \ Were there measurable traces of human faculty working
in apparent independence of material or etherial law ? Such traces, if
he sought long enough, I maintain that he would assuredly find. He
would find (as we have found) instances of telassthesia, or perception
beyond the sensory range ; instances of telepathy, or direct communica
tion from mind to mind ;—nay, telepathic messages from the so-called
dead—signs and apparitions by which minds discarnate impressed them
selves upon minds still robed in flesh. How far the ether, in some of
its unknown properties, may be concerned in these operations, our
Cosmotheorus might be better able to guess than we. To him, perhaps,
no environment would seem discontinuous with any other environment.
But, at any rate, here would be definite traces of a new environment
of Life and Thought ; traces of the mutual action of minds, embodied
and unembodied, in apparent independence of matter.
I must not here follow our imagined inquirer further ; but surely
we leave him launched upon a series of observations and experiments
which have no inherent flaw in their basis, and no assignable limit to
their scope.
7. I have dwelt at some length upon this line of argument, because
I think that, in some form or other, it is our duty to have it always
forthcoming, our duty to set it before the world in varying expression,
until our age is really convinced that this great branch of knowledge,
which deals with things unseen, can form no exception to those rules bv
which experience shows us that all valid knowledge has hitherto been
won. So confident, indeed, do I feel in this gradual but certain
method of approach—in this open, unfrequented way—that even if it
had thus far failed to lead us to any discovery, I should feel bound to
pursue it still. But it has not failed. This persistent analysis of un
explored faculty has revealed to us already far more than I, for one,
had ever dared to hope. I may surely say with no more than the
licensed exaggeration of epigram, that our method has revealed to us a
hidden world within us, and that this hidden world within us has re
vealed to us an invisible world without.
xxxvii.] Presidential Address. 119
Within each man, I say, there is a world of thought and of percep
tion which lies outside the margin, beneath the threshold, deeper than
the surface-tension of his conscious being.
" We were the first that ever burst
Into that silent sea."
We at any rate were among the earliest to attempt to explore and
map out that strange, submerged region—half lumber-room and half
king's-treasury—where amid things outworn lie things unborn, and
possibilities of our unimaginable Future lurk among the exuviae of our
immemorable Past. And yet in this confusion all is implicitly con
gruous and consecutive ; each trace of faculty, whether it lie behind
our actual stage of progress or before, belongs to a series of develop
ments of personality whose terms have no assignable limit ;—a series
which carries us onward without a break, from dream and hallucina
tion and bewilderment, up to the utterances of discarnate spirits and
the visions of ecstasy.
For, in truth, from the mind's inward vision we may learn more
than from the seeing of the eye ; from inward audition more than
from the hearing of the ear. The automatisms which steal their way
upward from hidden depths to manifestation amid man's sensory per
ceptions and voluntary acts are found on analysis to contain elements
of knowledge not attainable in any normal fashion. Such knowledge
is shown in telepathic messages between living men, and in apparitions
which tell of men dying, and in evidential messages from men whom
we call dead. All this —in Phanto&ms of the Living and in fourteen
volumes of Proceedings—I claim that we have adequately shown.
And of late years we have advanced and consolidated these frag
mentary and fugitive indications of the spirit's survival by certain
records of trance-phenomena and spirit-possession ;—records as yet
inchoate and imperfect, yet which must needs be faced and dealt
with by all serious men.
8. But here I must needs stay a moment to prevent any misunder
standing. Throughout this address, of course, I am speaking for myself
alone. I am not giving utterance to any collective view, but to my own
view of the general drift and result of our collective action. But at
this point I know that most even of those who may have gone with me
thus far will,—and quite justifiably,—suspend their adhesion. Few
even of my own colleagues have had full reason to believe that matter
of real importance has yet been received from behind the veil, and in
the world at large the general impression that even those messages
which look evidentially as though they had come from discarnate spirits
are yet practically futile and incoherent is strongly and naturally
operative in checking public interest in what seems so strangely baffling
a research.
120 F. W. H. Myers. [part
I will not now protest, as I might protest, against the accuracy of
this general impression of the actual facts. Accepting it for the sake
of argument, I will confine myself to one simple line of a priori reason
ing, which seems to me sufficient to show what, in the supposed case, is
our plain, scientific duty. I say, then, that if once it be admitted,
—as we are now assuming, for argument's sake, that it is admitted—
that it is evidentially probahle that some of these messages do indeed,
in however indirect or confused a manner, emanate from an unseen
world,—then it is a blasphemy against the faith of Science to doubt
that they must ultimately prove to be of serious, of supreme
importance.
The faith to which Science is sworn is a faith in the uniformity, the
coherence, the intelligibility of, at any rate, the material universe.
Science herself is but the practical development of this mighty
postulate. And if any phenomenon on which she chances on her onward
way seems arbitrary, or incoherent, or unintelligible, she does not
therefore suppose that she has come upon an unravelled end in the
texture of things ; but rather takes for granted that a rational answer
to the new problem must somewhere exist,—an answer which will be all
the more instructive because it will involve facts of which that first
question must have failed to take due account.
This faith in the uniformity of material Nature formulates itself in
two great dogmas—for such they are ;—the dogma of the Conservation
of Matter, and the dogma of the Conservation of Energy. Of the
Conservation of Matter, within earthly limits, we are fairly well
assured ; but of the Conservation of Energy the proof is far less com
plete, simply because Energy is a conception which does not belong to
the material world alone. Life is to us the most important of all
forms of activity ;—of energy, I would say,—except that we cannot
transform other energies into Life, nor measure in foot-pounds that
directive force which has changed the face of the world. Life comes
we know not whence ; it vanishes we know not whither ; it is inter
locked with a moving system vaster than that we know. To grasp the
whole of its manifestation we should have to follow it into an unseen
world. Yet scientific faith bids us believe that there, too, there is
continuity ; and that the past and the future of that force which
we discern for a moment are still subject to universal Law.
Believing, then, that the whole Cosmos is such as to satisfy the
claims of human Reason, we are irresistibly led to ask whether it
satisfies other claims of our nature which are as imperious as Reason
itself. Infinite Intelligence would see the Cosmos as infinitely in
telligent ; but would infinite Goodness also see it as infinitely good ?
We know too well the standing difficulties in the way of such an
assumption. They are that which we call Evil, and that which we
xxxvii.] Presidential Address. 121
see as Death. Now as to Evil,—which for us here and now seems so
ineffaceable a blot on the idea of Omnipotence,—we can perhaps never
theless just conceive that for the Cosmotheorus all these defects and
incompatibilities of human impulse and sensibility may seem as
relatively infinitesimal in the unimaginable Sum of Things, as for
us are the whirl and clashing of molecules in the dewdrop, which
cannot mar for our vision its crystalline calm.
But death, as it presents itself to us, cannot be similarly explained
away. If it be really, as it seems, a sheer truncation of moral
progress, absolute alike for the individual and for the race,—then
any human conception of a moral universe must simply be given
up. We are shut in land-locked pools ; why speak to us of an in
finite sea 1
What, then, should be the impulse, what the faith of Science, if she
finds even the least reason to suspect that this truncation is in fact
illusory ; that on the moral side also there is conservation and persist
ence ;—conservation not only of such ether-vortices as we assume to
underlie our visible matter, but of the spiritual systems or syntheses
which underlie the personalities of men!—persistence not only of crude
transformable energies, but of those specific non-transformable energies
which inform a Plato or a Newton, and which seem the only com
mensurate object towards which the whole process of evolution can
tend 1 Surely in such a case, whatever dreaminess or confusion may
mark the opening of intercourse with worlds indefinitely remote,
Science should summon all her fundamental trust in the coherence,
the intelligibility of things, to assure her that the dreaminess must pass
and the confusion clear, and that the veriest rudiment of communica
tion I)etween world and world bears yet the promise of completing and
consummating her own mighty dogmas,—of effecting a unification of the
universe such as she has never ventured to hope till now 1 What are
our petty human preconceptions worth in such a case as this 1 If it
was absurd to refuse to listen to Kepler, because he bade the planets
move in no perfect circles, but in undignified ellipses ;—because he
hastened and slackened from hour to hour what ought to be a heavenly
body's ideal and unwavering speed ;—is it not absurder still to refuse
to listen to these voices from afar, because they come stammering and
wandering as in a dream confusedly, instead of with a trumpet's call ?
because spirits that bend nigh to earth may undergo, perhaps, an
earthly bewilderment, and suffer unknown limitations, and half remem
ber us and half forget 1
Nay ! in the end it is not for us to choose ;—we needs must join in
this communion with what grace we may. We cannot, if we would,
transform ourselves into the mere cynical spectators of an irrational
universe. We are part and parcel of these incredible phenomena ; our
122 F. W. H. Myers. [part
own souls shall soon be feeling the same attraction, the same hesitancy,
upon the further shore.
" I am the doubter and the doubt,
And I the song the Brahman sings."
Let us do what we can, then, to dignify the situation. Let us try, then,
whether a more serious response on our part may enable the senders of
the messages to speak with clearer voice. To whose care indeed has such
response been hitherto for the most part left ? May not the instances
where adequate precautions have been taken, adequate record made, be
counted on the fingers of one hand 1 Might not our unseen corre
spondents turn the tables on us when we complain of their incapacity, and
ask whether it was worth while to do better for the "domestic muffs" of
Mme. Blavatsky's far-famed ce'nacle, or for the sitters at the "materiali
sation seances " of the " Vampires of Onset " ?
Assuredly we modern men have taken, in other quarters, more
trouble than here is needed, with far less hope of reward. What has
given its worth to the study of comparative religions except our steady
effort to comprehend and to co-ordinate such childish and stammering
utterances as have marked the rise in one nation after another of those
•spiritual needs and conceptions which make in the end the truest unity
of the race of man 1 What should we have learnt from the Vedas,
from the Book of the Dead —nay, from the Christian records them
selves—had we approached those sacred texts in the spirit alternately
of Simple Simon and of Voltaire 1
9. The time, I think, is ripe for a generalisation wider than any
which those ancient books contain. For just as a kind of spiritual
fusion of Europe under Roman sway prepared the way for Christianity
to become the European religion, so now also it seems to me that a
growing conception of the unity, the solidarity, of the human race is
preparing the way for a world-religion which expresses and rests upon
that solidarity ;—which conceives it in a fuller, more vital fashion than
either Positivist or Catholic had ever dreamed. For the new conception
is neither of henefactors dead and done for, inspiring us automatically
from their dates in an almanac, nor of shadowy saints imagined to
intercede for us at Tribunals more shadowy still ;—but rather of a
human unity, —close-linked beneath an unknown Sway,—wherein every
man who hath been or now is makes a living element ; —inalienably
incorporate, and imperishably co-operant, and joint-inheritor of one
infinite Hope.
Of course, I am not here supposing that any human gaze can pierce
deeply into the world unseen. Such communion as we may hold with
spirits in any degree comparable with ourselves must needs be on a
level far beneath the lowest of " Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms,
xxxvii.] Presidential Address. 12$
Virtues, Powers";—nay, must be in the very vestibule and antechamber
of the outermost of the courts of Heaven. These souls of ours are but
infantum animasflentes in limine primo ;—the first and humblest con
scious links in a wonderful order ;—trembling still and half-bewildered
at a future vaster than we know. I do not presume to forecast what
we may come in time to learn ; I only say that for the present hour
there will be enough of motive to urge us to utmost effort to rise in the
scale of being, if we can once be certain that such noble spirits as we
have known by earthly intercourse or earthly record do still concern
themselves with our progress, and still from their higher vantage-ground
call to us that all is well.
Men objected of old to Copernicus that if our earth really swept
round the sun in so vast an orbit, there should be an apparent displace
ment—a parallax—in the position of the fixed stars. Such parallax
was long sought in vain ; till at last advancing skill detected it in
some few stars nearer than the rest ;. and our relation to these near
luminaries proved to us our veritable voyage through the star-strewn
deep. Perhaps in the spiritual world as well we have strained our gaze
too exclusively on luminaries that are beyond the parallactic limit ;
and eyes turned steadily on some nearer brightness may teach us at
last our kinship and community in the firmament of souls.
Not, then, with tears and lamentations should we think of the
blessed dead. Rather we should rejoice with them in their enfranchise
ment, and know that they are still minded to keep us as sharers in
their joy. It is they, not we, who are working now ; they are more
ready to hear than we to pray ; they guide us as with a cloudy pillar,
but it is kindling into steadfast fire.
Nay, it may be that our response, our devotion, is a needful element
in their ascending joy ; and God may have provided some better thing
for us, that they without us should not be made perfect ;—v.1 non sine
nobis consummarenlur.
10. To most of my hearers I doubt not that this forecast of a coming
co-operation between incarnate and discarnate spirits will have seemed
speculative and premature. My defence is that I believe that upon
our own attitude towards these nascent communications their progress
and development depend, so that we cannot too soon direct serious
attention to the high responsibilities opening on our view. And now
yet another practical question is ready, I think, for immediate discus
sion. All great changes in speculative belief must modify in some
way man's immediate duty. In what way must our idea of duty be
modified, be expanded, if a religion is offered to us which no longer
depends on tradition and intuition only, but on reason also and on
experiment; which is not locked away in an emotional compartment of
124 F. W. H. Myers. [part
our being, nor adapted to the genius of special races alone, but is oecu
menical as Science is oecumenical, is evolutionary as Science is evolu
tionary, and rests on a permanent and provable relationship of the
whole spiritual to the whole material world ?
No full answer to such a question can as yet be attempted or
divined. But one point is clear ;—and on that point it is already
urgently necessary to insist. We must maintain, in old theological
language, that the intellectual virtues have now become .necessary to
xalvation. Curiosity, candour, care ;—these are the intellectual
virtues; —disinterested curiosity, unselfish candour, unremitting care.
These virtues have grown up outside the ecclesiastical pale ; Science,
not Religion, has fostered them ;—nay, Religion has held them scarcely
consistent with that pious spirit which hopes to learn by humility
and obedience the secrets of an unseen world. Here surely our new
ideals suggest not opposition but fusion. To us as truly as to monk
or anchorite the spiritual world is an intimate, an interpenetrating
reality. But its very reality suggests the need of analysis, the risk of
misinterpretation ; the very fact that we have outgrown our sacerdotal
swaddling-clothes bids us learn to walk warily among pitfalls which
call for all the precautions which systematic reason can devise.
Upon a new scheme of beliefs, attractive to the popular mind as the
scheme which I prefigure, a swarm of follies and credulities must
inevitably perch and settle. Yet let those who mock at the weaknesses
of " modern Spiritualism " ask themselves to what extent either ortho
dox religion or official science has been at pains to guard the popular
mind against losing balance upon contact with new facts, profoundly
but obscurely significant t Have the people's religious instructors
trained them to investigate for themselves ? Have their scientific
instructors condescended to investigate for them 1 Who should teach
them to apply to their "inspirational speakers" any test more searching
than they have been accustomed to apply to the sermons of priest or
bishop ? What scientific manual has told them enough of the hidden
powers within them to prevent them from ascribing to spiritual agency
whatever mental action their ordinary consciousness may fail to recog
nise as its own 1
The rank and file of Spiritists have simply transferred to certain
new dogmas—for most of which they at least have some comprehensible
evidence—the uncritical faith which they were actually commended for
bestowing on certain old dogmas,—for many of which the evidence was
at least beyond their comprehension. In such a case ridicule is no
remedy. The remedy lies, as I have said, in inculcating the intellectual
virtues ; —in teaching the mass of mankind that the maxims of the
modern savant are at least as necessary to salvation as the maxims of
the mediaeval saint.

11. Now here, I take it, lies the special, the characteristic duty of
the Society for Psychical Research. It is a duty far wider than the mere
exposure of fraud ; far wider than the mere production of specimens of
patient and intelligent investigation. Our duty is not the founding of
a new sect, nor even the establishment of a new science, but is rather
the expansion of Science herself until she can satisfy those questions
which the human heart will rightly ask, but to which Religion alone has
thus far attempted an answer. Or rather, this is the duty, the mission, of
the coming century's leaders of spiritual thought. Our own more special
duty is to offer through an age of transition more momentous than man
kind has ever known, that help in steadying and stimulating psychical
research all over the world which our collective experience should
enable us richly to bestow. Such function ought, I say, to be ours
indeed. We alone have taken the first steps to deserve it. I see
our original programme completely justified. I see our raison cFStre
indisputably established. I see all things coming to pass as we
foresaw. What I do not see, alas ! is an energy and capacity of our
own, sufficient for our widening duty ;—enough of labourers for the
vineyard so ripe for harvest. Speaking, if so I may, for the remnant
of that small company of labourers of the first hour of the day, I must
confess that our strength, at least, cannot suffice for the expanding
task ;—nay, could not so suffice, even if Edmund Gurney were with us
still ;—n0n, si ipse mens nunc adforet Hector. Other workers, good
men and true, have joined themselves to us;—but we have need of many
more. We invite them from each department of science, from every
school of thought. With equal confidence we appeal for co-operation
to savant and to saint.
12. To the savant we point out that we are not trying to pick
holes in the order of Nature, but rather, by the scrutiny of residual
phenomena, to get nearer to the origin and operation of Nature's
central mystery of Life. Men who realise that the etherial environ
ment was discovered yesterday need not deem it impossible that a
metetherial environment—yet another omnipresent system of cosmic
law—should be discovered to-morrow. The only valid a priori pre
sumption in the matter is the presumption that the Universe is infinite
in an infinite number of ways.
To the Christian we can speak with a still more direct appeal.
"You believe," I would say, "that a spiritual world exists, and that it
acted on the material world two thousand years ago. Surely it is so
acting still ! Nay, you believe that it is so acting still ; for you believe
that prayer is heard and answered. To believe that prayer is heard is
to believe in telepathy-—in the direct influence of mind on mind. To
believe that prayer is answered is to believe that unembodied spirit does
actually modify (even if not storm-cloud or plague-germ) at least the
126 F. W. H. Myers. [part
minds, and therefore the brains, of living men. From that belief the
most advanced ' psychical ' theories are easy corollaries. You may reply,
indeed, that the Church, or the Bible, has told men all of the unseen
world that they need to know, and that whatsoever is more than this
eometh of evil. What say you to this argument when it is retorted on
you by Omar with his Koran 1 "
But let us cease to speak as though the infinite Unseen World
were a mere preserve or battle-ground of theologies. If every dogma
ever promulgated from the Vatican were literal truth, Science would
still affirm that scarcely anything of that world was known. If
Religion be more than " the guess of a worm in the dust, and the
shadow of its desire," it must be (I say once more) the spirit's normal
answer to objective fact. The Cosmos is what it is, and Revelation
can do no more than reveal it. Holiness itself must be the reflection
of a reality behind the veil. If this be so, then Science has come not
to destroy but to fulfil ; Religion must needs evolve into Knowledge ;
for Religion can in no age admit an aim narrower than the prayer of
Cleanthes, —the willing response of the soul to all she knows of
cosmic law.
Out of the long Stone Age our race is awakening into conscious
ness of itself. We stand in the dawn of history. Behind us lies a vast
and unrecorded waste—the mighty struggle humanam c&ndere ijent«m.
Since the times of that ignorance we have not yet gone far ; a few
thousand years, a few hundred thinkers, have barely started the human
mind upon the great axms of its onward way. It is not yet the hour to
sit down in our studies and try to eke out Tradition with Intuition—
as one might be forced to do in a planet's senility, by the glimmer of a
fading sun. Daphni, quid antiquos sigiurrum suspiois ortus ? The
traditions, the intuitions of our race are themselves in their infancy ;
and before we abandon ourselves to brooding over them let us at least
first try the upshot of a systematic search for actual facts. For what
should hinder? If our inquiry lead us first through a jungle of fraud
and folly, need that alarm us 1 As well might Columbus have yielded
to the sailors' panic, when he was entangled in the Sargasso Sea. If
our first clear facts about the Unseen World seem small and trivial,
should that deter us from the quest 1 As well might Columbus have
sailed home again, with America in the offing, on the ground that it
was not worth while to discover a continent which manifested itself
only by dead logs.
One final word to each main division of our critics ;—to those first
who have been disappointed so often that they refuse to listen to any
further promise of news from the Unseen ;—and then to those who
relying on some grander revelation,—whether received from without
them or from within,—disdain our slow collective process and
xxxvu.] Presidential Address. 127
comminuted fragments of truth. I would remind the Agnostic that a
pike was once kept in the same tank with a perch. There was at first
a sheet of glass between them ; and the pike bruised his nose so often
in snapping at the perch that in time he gave up that endeavour—as
the Agnostic his endeavour after proof of a spiritual world—with a
sigh or a sneer. Then silently the transparent screen was removed ;
but now the pike was so convinced that his prey was unreachable
that—like the Agnostic in presence of our new evidence—he continued
simply to let the perch alone.
For those other men I will resort to a bold metonymy, and will speak
of that great incurrent truth to which each man severally holds under
the figure of the great stone at Ephesus which fell down from Jupiter.
The faithful who proclaimed that wondrous fall were essentially in the
right,—were far more in the right than the freethinkers who derided
it. But whence and why that stone had truly fallen,—how vast the
significance of that cosmic trajectory and rushing flame,—this could
he known only when humble labourers had catalogued many a lesser
congener of the mighty mass ; and had gathered the meteoric dust
from the ocean's floor ; and had learnt that no field of heaven had
been found so desolate as not to carry still the impress of ultimate
energy and universal law.

PART I.
Introductory.
After my previous lengthy paper " On the So-called Divining
Rod," published in Part XXXII. (Vol. XIII.) of our Proceedings, some
apology is due for a second paper on this subject ; the more so as the
subject itself, to most intelligent people, appears a contemptible one
and unworthy of prolonged and serious scientific inquiry. It certainly
is not one I should have chosen for investigation. However, having
been urged to undertake it, those who may have had the patience to
road the mass of evidence given in my former paper will probably have
come to the same conclusion as that to which I have been led,—in spite
of very different preconceived ideas, —namely, that the whole subject is
one eminently worthy of careful investigation ; not only as a question of
folk lore and of historical interest, but also because several problems
of considerable psychological and also physiological interest appear to
be involved. In addition to which the main problem before us is a
settlement of the disputed point whether mere shrewdness, an " eye
for the ground " and experience on the part of the so-called " diviner "
afford a sufficient explanation of the success which he so often achieves.
It is true that the subject at first dispirits and repels the
investigator from the quantity of rubbish that overlays it and the
credulity and ignorance that surround it, and which characterise so
many of the enthusiastic votaries and writers on the divining rod, both
in ancient and modern times But this is equally true of many other
xxxviii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 133
obscure questions which this Society was founded to investigate, and
it is our business to try and discover, with the divining rod of science,
the treasure that is buried beneath any soil. As Sir John Herschel
has truly said of scientific research in general :—" He that has seen
obscurities, which appeared impenetrable, suddenly dispelled, and the
most barren and unpromising fields of inquiry converted into rich and
inexhaustible springs of knowledge on a simple change of our point of
view, or by bringing to bear on them some principle which it never
occurred before to try, will be the last to acquiesce in any dispiriting
prospects."1
Before entering upon the discussion of the fresh evidence I have
collected, it may be convenient to those who approach this subject for
the first time if I briefly state by whom, and the purpose for which,
the divining rod is at present employed, and how it comes to pass that
what appears at first sight to be a mere relic of a superstitious age
survives amid the scientific light of the present day. Readers of my
previous report will, I hope, forgive the repetition.
There are in the country districts of England a certain class of
persons who profess to be able to discover, without geological or local
knowledge, the exact location of any underground " spring " or subter
ranean course of water supply.2 For this purpose they usually, but
not always, employ a forked or Y-shaped twig, generally of hazel or
some pliant wood. Grasping the ends of the fork in a particular
manner,—to which great importance is usually attached, albeit the
mode of holding has varied in late years in an amusing manner,—the
holder fixes his attention upon the slightly raised point of the twig,
and thus becoming as far as possible oblivious to the world around,
he traverses the ground. When supposed to be approaching the
hidden source the twig is seen to quiver, and when the "diviner"
believes he is vertically over the " spring," so vigorous is the motion of
the twig that it forcibly strikes the holder's body, and, if short enough
to escape the body, rotates rapidly, though the holder appears to be
doing his utmost to restrain its motion; a fact that he will emphatically
corroborate, and which seems to be undeniably proved by one limb of
the twig being often snapped across, under the strain of the opposing
forces. The holder of the twig generally appears much exhausted by
the effort ; in some cases he complains of sickness or giddiness,
1 Discourse on the Study of Natural Philosophy, p. 8.
- 1 put the word spring in inverted commas, as this term is invariably employed by
the "water-tinder." As so used, it is, however, often a very misleading expression.
In order to remove misconception on the part of non-geological readers, I have given
the reason why this expression is usually incorrect in an Appendix on "Geological
Views of the Distribution of Underground Water," which will be found in my
previous Report. See also Appendix B., p. 340, in the present Report.
134 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part
occasionally the pulse rises, he breaks out into a violent perspiration,
and trembles all over. As a rule (but not always) he asserts that he
experiences singular sensations, resembling muscular cramp, when he
is over an underground water-course. These sensations are so well
marked that in some cases he discards the use of the twig and trusts
to his sensations alone.1 If now the place be carefully noted beneath
which the hidden water-course is asserted to exist, the probability
is that, however often the spot be crossed by the holder of the twig,
the same phenomena recur, even when his attention is distracted, or
another and independent diviner employed. Further, if a well be dug
at the spot so indicated, water will usually be found at no great depth
below the surface. These water-finders, or diviners, are widely and
regularly employed, not by ignorant folk, but by some of the most
distinguished and clever people in England, by Cabinet Ministers and
Judges, 2 by shrewd business men and large landowners — men not
likely to waste their money on a silly superstition. In parts of the
south-west of England, in Somersetshire particularly, these water-
finders are held in high esteem, and are known as "dowsers," and
their rod as the "dowsing rod."
This alleged power of finding underground water, when to an
ordinary observer there appears nothing to betray the presence of
a spring below, is not confined to a professional and paid class
of men, but is found among amateurs, young and old, male and
female, and in all classes of society. Nor is the dowser only met
with in England ; he is found to-day in some parts of France,
Italy, Switzerland, Germany, Denmark, Scandinavia, and Finland, and
flourishing in the United States, Canada, Australia, and doubtless
in other places of which I have no direct evidence. Many instances
of the wide distribution of the dowser were given in my former paper,
and others will be given in the evidence to be cited later on.
In my previous paper I gave an account of fourteen contemporary
English dowsers, all of whom make or add to their living by this means,
and, in addition, evidence was given of the practical use of the rod by
upwards of thirty amateurs of both sexes and ranging over every class
in society, from elderly magistrates to young children. Since then
several other dowsers, both professional and amateur, have come under
my notice (see p. 234). I have not, however, found any Scotch or
Irish professional dowsers, though these countries regularly invite
the services of English dowsers. I should say there are at the present

time in England at least a score of these men engaged in the business
of water finding, and a very profitable business some of them find it
to be. Curiously enough I have come across no women professional
dowsers, though this is contrary to what one might expect.
The etymology of the word dowsing rod is uncertain;1 it is first men
tioned by the philosopher Locke in 1691, who speaks of the "deusing rod
or virgula divina." Locke was a native of Somersetshire, born under the
shadow of the Mendips, and for upwards of two centuries the Mendips
have been, and still are, the radiating point and stronghold of the
dowser. The term " dowsing rod " is preferable to " divining rod,"
as the latter, or rather its Latin equivalent virgula divina, was used
by Cicero, Tacitus and other writers of antiquity to denote a wholly
different thing, namely, divination by rods or bits of stick ; and no
doubt a good deal of the prejudice which the term divining rod creates
at the present day is due to the fact that it suggests to most people
some form of rhabdoruancy. The forked divining rod, or virgulafurcata,
our modern dowsing rod, is not much older than the age of printing,
and was first described in one of the earliest treatises on mining,
Agricola's De re Metallica, published in 1546; for its original use was in
the search for metallic ores, and, thus used, it spread from South Germany
to the South of France and thence over Europe, reaching England
towards the end of the 16th century.2 Not until the 17th century was
it used in the search for underground water, but whether for ores or
water, the business-like way in which it was employed 3 distinguished
it from the ancient virgula divina, the efficacy of which was supposed
to depend on the ceremonies and Kabbalistic words which accompanied
its use. But among the superstitious and ignorant some of the
practices of rhabdomancy clung to the new rod along with the old
name; hence it is that in several descriptions of the divining rod from
the 16th century down to the present time we find special importance
1 See Appendix A to my former paper. With great deference I am inclined to
believe the etymology suggested on p. 261 of that Appendix, viz., from the middle
English dnschen, to strike, is after all the most likely : the objection raised to this
by Professor Skeat on the ground of the pronunciation being dowz is much weakened
if not destroyed by the fact that it is very frequently pronounced in other ways.
Moreover I find that when the rod was first brought to England at the end of the
16th or beginning of the 17th century, it was called "the striking rod," schiagruthe,
by the German miners who brought it over.
'-' In Germany the word wiinschd ruthe (wishing rod) was, and is still, used as the
equivalent both of the old divining rod, viryula divina, and the more modern dowsing
rod, the virgula furcata ; though, as mentioned in the previous foot-note, the German
miners of the 16th century called the latter schlag-nUhe. Several German writers,
long before the age of printing, speak of the wunschel rulhe, and a forked wiintchel
ruthe, it is true, is referred to by one Nithart, a German writer of the 14th century,
but in these early cases it was the ancient magic wand, or virgula divina.

attached to the day of the month the diviner was born, the particular
kind of twig employed, the day or hour on which it was cut, or the
way it turns for underground water or metallic ores, etc.
Here, for instance, is an illustration of the survival of this super
stition, and also of the use of the rod in Jutland. In Kristensen's
Jyske Folkeminder (Popular Traditions of Jutland), published at
Kolding, 1S88, Vol. IX., Section 822, under the heading, Folketro und
bonde regler (Popular Beliefs and Farming Rules), the following
passage occurs :—
It has been a general custom that, when a well was to be dug, word was
sent for a " water-shower " (vand-viser), who went over the ground with a
forked (Idoftet) willow-wand. If the twig began to twist about in his
hand, there was water near the surface, and digging could be begun with
confidence.
Much the same procedure was followed to discover ore. A two-year-old
willow-shoot was taken, which was forked in growth. If water was to bo
found it must be of a different age. One who can find ore may not be able
to discover water : it depends upon what month they are born in. l
Those who have had experience of an investigation of this
kind, where people are afraid of being laughed at for giving their
testimony, will understand the labour of obtaining accurate evidence
of eye-witnesses who are willing to append their names. The cor
respondence entailed in this inquiry has been endless ; not far short
of 6,000 letters had to be written for the purpose of my previous
report. Upwards of 200 cases of water-finding by dowsers in recent
years have been investigated ; in each case the independent evidence
of disinterested persons who had witnessed the experiments was sought.
Generally speaking such evidence was obtained, the witnesses allowing
their names and addresses to be given. Altogether, 152 cases of dowsing
were cited in my previous paper ; of these 140 were successful,—that is,
the predictions of the dowser were verified, a well was sunk on the
spot and water found at the place indicated,—and 12 were failures.
As one is far less likely to hear of the failures than of the
successes of amateurs, let us confine our attention only to the profes
sional dowser. Omitting a remarkably successful series of cases by an
American dowser, which Dr. Hodgson kindly investigated, 105 cases of
British professional dowsers were given in my former paper ; of these
95 were successful and 10 were failures. That would make the record
1 I am indebted to Mr. W. A. Craigie of Oxford for kindly searching Kristensen's
works for me, and for the translation of the foregoing passage. Kristensen is an
authority on Danish folk-lore, though his books are not to be found in the British
Museum. The use of the divining rod in another part of Scandinavia is referred to
in my previous paper, p. 245. Professor Lochman, of the University of Christiania,
recently read a paper in that city in which he said his scepticism on the subject had
been overcome by his own personal experience with the rod.

of failure less than 10 per cent., which is certainly remarkably small.
1 have endeavoured to find the percentage of failure which skilled
geologists or other scientific experts have made when they are con
sulted as to water supply,—for failures, and sometimes very costly
failures, they have,—but it is difficult to ascertain. I doubt if their
percentage of failure is less than the average dowser's ; probably it
varies very much with the individual employed in each case.1 As
might be expected, some professional dowsers, especially those who
are fond of advertising themselves in newspaper paragraphs, have a
poor record, and some are unadulterated humbugs. These do their
best to conceal their failures, and their success is probably no greater
than would have been obtained had a well been sunk at haphazard
without their aid. For in many districts of England, the water-bearing
area, for shallow wells, lies over a large extent of country, and in such
districts one cannot go far wrong in sinking anywhere.
I may remark here that, whilst the idea of the illiterate dowser
concerning the distribution of underground water is often most
grotesque, yet, if I may venture to say so, it is not impossible that
the geologist has a good deal to learn on this subject. Although,
as Mr. T. V. Holmes, F.G.S., remarks, many dowsers think water
exists here and there beneath the surface of the ground, like a
pot of buried coins, instead of, as is often the case, in sheets,
wherever a permeable stratum, like sand or gravel, meets an imper
meable one like clay or slate ; yet on the other hand the wide
practical experience of those dowsers who are well-sinkers has been too
much overlooked by geologists.2 Underground watercourses do exist,
under certain geological conditions, and it is here, where an error
can easily be made, that the true test of the dowser comes in. In
deep artesian wells skilled geological knowledge is always necessary,
but even this sometimes fails completely. Now it must be remem
bered that the professional dowser is sublimely ignorant of geology
and has, in general, a contempt for science, — as a rule, he is an
illiterate man. It was noticed more than a century ago, both in
Germany, France, and England, that " peasants who do not puzzle their
minds with doubts or reasonings" (I quote from Pryce's famous mining
work of 1778) are the most successful dowsers. This is true to-day.
The well-known dowser, the late J. Mullins, was a working mason
and well-sinker, and his success as a dowser in the discovery of under
ground water was really phenomenal ; he rarely was at fault, and I
think we may take it he was the most remarkable dowser this century
has produced.
1 The geologist, however, labours under restrictions which the dowser is free
from ; see on this Mr. Holmes' letter, p. 140.
2 In support of this view, see Dr. A. B. Wallace's letter on p. 374.
138 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part
Two cases of John Mullins' success were critically and fully
investigated in my former paper—one at Horsham, on the estate
of Mr., now Sir, Henry Harben, and the other at Waterford, for
the large factory of Messrs. Richardson. In both of these, as
might be expected, the best geological and engineering advice had
been obtained prior to calling in the dowser. It was only when
the resources of science were exhausted,—over £1,000 having been
spent in each case in fruitless sinkings and borings in different
places on the estate,—that Mullins was at last sent for, in 1889
to Waterford, and in 1893 to Horsham. He was an entire stranger
to the neighbourhood in both cases, and was received, not unnaturally,
with a good deal of suspicion. At Horsham he quickly pointed
out two places where an abundant supply of water would be found
within a moderate depth, and his predictions were verified to the
letter. I have visited the spot and obtained the evidence of eye
witnesses, including Sir H. Harben, and at my request the place
has been visited by competent geologists. The case was ably discussed
from a geological point of view by Mr. T. V. Holmes, F.G.S., past
President of the London Geologists' Association, and Mr. E. Westlake,
F.G.S., in my previous Report, pp. 221-230 and 278-280.
The case of Waterford is still more remarkable ; I will not repeat
the details, which will bear careful study, as it is, I think, one of the
most remarkable cases in the whole voluminous literature of the rod.
Suffice it to say, that the rock there is of a hard slaty nature called
Ordovician, it is hidden beneath a surface bed of some 40 ft. of
boulder clay and in the search for water various wells and borings had
been fruitlessly made, one boring being over 1,000 ft. deep. Not far
from this deep and useless boring, made under the best scientific advice,
Mullins found the twig turn vigorously ; he traced what he said was a
line of copious water supply—either a line of jointing or a " fault "
in the hidden rock—and fixed on one point as being the best to sink
the well, asserting water to the extent of 1,500 gallons an hour would
be found at a depth of some 80 or 90 ft. I need not say that
no one believed him, but in despair a boring was made at this spot,
when suddenly, at the depth of 81 ft., water burst up the bore tube
and rose half way to the surface. After pumping day and night, the
supply could not be run dry ; it was measured and the yield was found
to be 2,000 gallons per hour, which has been maintained with but
slight fluctuations from 1889, when the experiment was made, to the
present time, a period of eleven years. These statements have the
advantage of being corroborated by eye-witnesses and by letters
written at the time, not by gullible, ignorant people, but by educated
men, including a well-known local geologist, Mr. Budd, who held as
it were a watching brief against Mullins ; and by Mr. Kinahan, a
xxxvm.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 139
distinguished geologist of H.M. Irish Geological Survey, as well as by
Mr. Richardson himself. In fact Mr. Kinahan (who, as one of the best
Irish geological authorities, was consulted by Mr. Richardson), writes to
me : "As far as the actual results went I failed, and the diviner
'wiped my eye.'" No surface observation nor experience, nor "an
eye for the ground " can explain this Waterford case, nor some others
I shall refer to in the sequel.
On the other hand, in the opinion of competent geologists who
have kindly given me their aid in this inquiry, several cases where the
dowser has had a striking success, and which at first sight appear to
suggest some power transcending any recognised faculty, were found,
upon geological observation on the spot, to be capable of explanation
by the rapid detection of surface indications of underground water
by the dowser. This will be seen from the useful geological notes
Mr. T. V. Holmes, F.G.S., has kindly appended to some of the cases
in the previous and also in the present Report. A fuller investigation
of several cases was, at my request, undertaken by Mr. E. Westlake,
F.G.S., who has made a special study of hydro-geology, and whose
valuable co-operation throughout this inquiry I have already acknow
ledged. Mr. Westlake selected a group of cases, given in the previous
Report, which appeared to be evidential of some special faculty
possessed by the dowser, and visited each of the places ; the result
of his investigations is given in the able paper which forms an
Appendix to the present Report, see p. 315. It will be observed
that Mr. Westlake is of opinion that many of these cases can be
explained without calling in the aid of any novel faculty or instinct
on the part of the dowser—merely a sharp eye for the ground was
required. At the same time we must remember it is much easier
to prophesy after the event than before it, and it remains to be seen
whether our geological friends would have thought the location of
the site in these cases quite as obvious before the well had been sunk,
or the dowser had visited the spot, as it seemed to be afterwards.
However that may be, I gratefully accept the opinion of geological
experts, and will here quote a letter which expresses Mr. Holmes'
views on the subject.

I may add that I am attracted, not repelled, by the supernormal, for
our senses must give us extremely limited perceptions of things as compared
with the perceptions possible to more highly gifted beings. Hence, among
ourselves, there is no improbability in the existence of powers of special per
ception in individual cases, even though the total range of perception
may not be supernormal. Thus if the line A.B. represents the normal range
of a sense, there may be abnormally gifted persons whose range is not
140 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part
greater, but is more extensive at one end of the scale, if correspondingly
less so at the other, like the line C.D.
A. B.
C. D.
However, it has always struck me that while stories of apparitions, &c.,
are treated with a curious ultra-scepticism in many cases, the dowser's
claims to supernormal powers have been admitted with the most extra
ordinary alacrity.1
As the position of our old towns and villages testifies, the men who knew
where water might be attained at a depth of from 5 to 50ft. have always
been with us. Geologists generally do not trouble themselves with water,
as regards supply for dwellings, though anxious to know whether the super
ficial formations are deep sea, shallow sea, estuarine river, glacial, etc.
And the cholera in the first half of tho century so discredited water from
superficial deposits that supplies from those sources have not been trusted,
even when sufficiently good. The dowser's supply is voted excellent, and
he is triumphant where a hydro-geologist would feel that he would be
deservedly blamed for recommending it, should it become polluted and cause
disease.
All I feel is that an eye for ground can do very much and can be
immensely developed by experience. The dowser needs no geological know
ledge beyond what he might have had a century ago. The most remarkable
successes of dowsers are those in which sensitiveness to the proximity of
water cannot have helped them, while their views as to its distribution seem
fatal to the hypothesis that they are influenced by special sensitiveness.
Somehow, the more one looks ink) cases, the more the supernormal recedes.
I quite agree with you that the twisting of the twig—though a most
interesting phenomenon—has no [direct nor invariable] connection with the
nearness of underground water. m y rrOLmys
The dowser asserts that he does not concern himself with the
nature of the ground, but is guided solely by the twisting of his
forked twig or by some peculiar sensation he experiences. In this
case one would have expected to find some blind dowsers, as the
blind are peculiarly sensitive in some directions, but—though I know
the extensive literature of the divining rod pretty thoroughly— I
have not been able to find a single blind dowser in any country in the
world during the four centuries the dowsing rod has been employed.
It may be urged that blind people could not engage in the peregrina
tions required of a dowser, nor properly hold the forked twig if they
had a guide. This may be so, but I do not think it is the true
answer, for I can find no account of the sudden and involuntary
twisting of the rod in the hands of any blind person under any

nor by myself.—W.F.B.
xxxvni.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 141
conditions : blind people may not have been tried, and I intended,
had time permitted, to have tested the inmates of a blind asylum.
The true explanation, I believe, will be found in the fact that the
rod only moves in the hands of a novice when he has seen it "work" in
the hands of somebody else ; it would no doubt move with many blind
people if they had previously felt the hands and the twig of a dowser
when the latter is twisting. In any case the absurdity of imagining
there is any direct connection between underground water and the
motion of the so-called divining rod is seen from the fact that the first
use of the rod was for finding underground ores, then for finding
buried treasure, then for tracing lost cattle or boundaries, then for a
multitude of uses in the moral world (until its employment for this
latter purpose was forbidden by the Inquisition in 1701), and at the
present day dowsers profess to discover, not only underground water
and mineral lodes, but hidden coins, water or gas pipes, etc., by the
twisting of their rod. Obviously, therefore, the peculiar involuntary
motion of the rod and what causes this motion is one thing, and the
existence of an alleged dowsing, or water-fiuding, faculty is quite
another.
Object of our Investioation.
This brings us to an important point in our investigation. We
must know clearly wJiat we are seeking for. Is it for the cause of
the motion of the dowsing rod, or for a proof or disproof of an alleged
" dowsing faculty," or for a particular explanation of that faculty,
assuming it to exist? Now it will be found that nearly every
scientific investigator of the divining rod during the last 100
years has set out with some theory of the action of the dowsing
rod, which, when he has satisfactorily demolished, he has asserted
the whole thing was a fraud. Some of the most famous names
in French scientific history a century ago, when they showed that
electricity afforded no explanation of the movement of the divining
rod, asserted they had disproved the existence of the alleged faculty
itself. Had they been versed in the history of the subject,
they would have found that a century prior to their day equally
eminent French savants asserted the same thing, because they had
demonstrated the devil was not the cause of the twisting of the forked
twig. And now, in our own day, no less eminent French, American,
and English men of science assert,—electricity and the devil having
been laid,—that involuntary muscular action on the part of the
dowser finally disposes of the divining rod and the mystery of an
alleged dowsing faculty. This, of course, is equally erroneous.
Assuming this explanation to be established, all that it explains
is the twisting of the rod. Here is an instance of this fallacy.
142 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part
Mr Emerson, to whom I have already referred1, published in the
American Journal of Science (SiUiman's Journal) for 1821 a series of
remarkable cases, showing how underground water had been found by
dowsers where it had previously been sought for in vain. Five years
later he was led to an ingenious theory of the motion of the rod as due
to involuntary muscular action, an explanation we may readily admit :
then after blindfolding a young boy, in whose hands the forked twig
moved, albeit he had never been tested as a dowser, Mr. Emerson
draws the following sweeping conclusions from the failure of some
fallacious experiments which we have given later on, p. 212 :—
The pretensions of diviners are worthless. The art of finding fountains
and minerals with a succulent twig is a cheat upon those who practise it, an
offence to reason and to common sense, an art abhorrent to the laws of
nature, and deserving of universal reprobation.
I venture to say that the majority of scientific men who have read
Emerson's papers will imagine he has proved his assertions, and that the
question had been finally settled by him, just as in Europe it was con
sidered that Chevreul in 1854 had settled the question by a similar
explanation, forgetting that the astronomer Lalande had also given a
similar explanation in 1782. What a hardy perennial this superficial
and easy dismissal of the whole subject is may be seen in a recent
letter in the scientific journal Nature (January 6th, 1898), which I
have quoted elsewhere, p. 288. Here, once more, an American professor
tells us "the whole secret of the divining rod " is to be found in the
involuntary muscular action of the operator.
And so also with regard to blindfolding. If well-conducted
experiments, with a good dowser, show that blindfolding prevents the
dowser from fixing on the same spots that he did when he could see,—
places where he alleged underground water to exist, —all we have
proved is the extreme improbability of any direct influence of the
water on the dowser, or any clairvoyant perception on his part.
Failure when blindfolded does not prove the dowser to be a charlatan,
but merely that a particular physical or psychical explanation is im
probable. For the success of the dowser under normal conditions may
still be due to some instinct or faculty, derived from a rapid but sub
conscious observation and interpretation of the surface indications of
underground water or mineral lodes, or his success may be due merely
to experience and shrewd observation, which, from habitude, has almost
ceased to excite a conscious effort As eyesight would be necessary in
either of these cases, the dowsing faculty, if there be such, would in
this event take its place along with other familiar illustrations of
keenness of perception in men and animals.

Let us therefore clearly recognise in our experiments what is the
aim we have in view. A particular theory may be proved to be wrong,
but the important point is to obtain trustworthy evidence of all the
facts in each case, and when a sufficiently wide range of evidence is
before us, to endeavour to arrive at some explanation. It is for this
reason that I have been compelled to burden this and the previous
Report with such an accumulation of cases, for the subject is full of
difficulties from a scientific point of view, and any explanation we
may give must be based upon an extensive survey, and is likely to be
either a tentative or a complex one.
We may summarise the objects of our investigation as follows :—,
I. Whether the alleged claim of the dowser to a special faculty,
or even facility, in the discovery of underground water or mineral
lodes has any basis in fact, and if so :—
(i.) Whether this is due merely to knowledge acquired by the
dowser from experience and careful observation of the ground ; or
(ii.) Whether such information is derived by some instinctive
and subconscious process of observation on the part of the
dowser, or perhaps hypenesthetic discernment of surface signs too
faint to be perceived by the ordinary observer ; or
(iii.) Whether there is evidence of any supernormal perception
by the dowser—that is, information derived subconsciously other
wise than through the ordinary channels of sense.
II. The evidence for and the explanation of: (i.) the sudden and
often uncontrollable movement of the rod in the hands of the dowser ;
(ii.) the apparent transmission of this power of motor-automatism from
a sensitive to an insensitive person ; and (iii.) the singular malaise
and convulsive spasm which is associated in so many dowsers with the
involuntary motion of the rod.
III. The History and Bibliography of the subject. These have
been prepared, but the matter is so voluminous that it must be
published later on.
I propose to begin with No. 1 —further tests as to the alleged
claims of the dowser.

PART II.
Experiments by the Author.
S 1. The Carru/oona Experiments,
It has been suggested l that the most satisfactory test of the
alleged claims of the dowser would be to carry out some experiments
under my own personal supervision, boring or sinking wells in places
where the dowser indicated water would or would not be found. As I
have said elsewhere, this can only be a very restricted test, owing to the
expense involved, and, unless care be taken, may be as inconclusive
as were Professor Sollas's two test borings described in the previous
Report, pp. 220 and 221. However, I determined to make the
attempt, and have done so this spring and summer, with the results I
will now give. In order that an impartial judgment may be arrived
at by my readers a somewhat detailed account is, I fear, unavoidable.
Certain precautions were necessary if any satisfactory evidence one
way or the other was to be obtained. (1) The place chosen must be
one entirely unfamiliar to the dowser, and no opportunity must be
allowed him of knowing beforehand where the experiment is to be
made, otherwise the dowser might make a prior careful examination
of a geological map of the district (assuming he had access to such
maps and could understand them — a possible assumption) ; such
examination would doubtless yield a good deal of valuable information
to a clever man. (2) The district selected must be one geologically
suitable, that is to say, not a large water-bearing or waterless area,
the character of which he might discern at a glance, and where he
could not go wrong anywhere in predicting water or no water.
(3) The dowser should be taken direct to the place and not allowed to
get any information from persons living in the neighbourhood as to
the position of any existing springs or wells. (4) The persons who
accompany the dowser should also be ignorant of the likeliest spots
where water would or would not be found, lest they perchance
consciously or unconsciously convey their knowledge to the dowser.
These conditions were all successfully met, the place I selected
—a mountainous region in the co. Wicklow, four miles from Bray—
admirably fulfilling the geological conditions required, and a region I
believe no dowser had ever visited. I wrote to two or three of the
best known English professional dowsers, asking them if they could
come over, and as Mr. Stone replied he was shortly coming to Ireland,
I arranged to see him. On his arrival he had no idea where the

experiment was to be made, nor did I tell him, but took him
straightway to the place. My friend Mr. B. St. G. Lefroy accom
panied us to take notes as an independent careful observer, and the
memorandum he has written will be given directly. It was Easter
week, 1899, and the day was fine. Mr. Stone told me he had never
been in co. Wicklow before, and I have no doubt that is quite time.
Leaving our car in the Rocky Valley, we ascended the mountain road
leading round a hill called Carrigoona, on the lower slopes of which
there are patches of cultivated ground, but the quartzite rock of which
the hill is composed juts out here and there, though the hillside is
generally covered with two or three feet of alluvial soil, on which
gorse and heather and bracken grow, clothing the mountain with a
garment of beauty. The panorama from the mountain-side is also
one of unsurpassed beauty, and stirred the emotions of my geological
friends who afterwards visited the spot with me.
For the accompanying geological map of the district I am in
debted to the kindness of H. M. Geological Survey. The field we

view of the surrounding country is shown in the picture opposite,
Fig. 2 ; this is taken from a rocky eminence on the south-eastern
corner of the field E and is therefore looking nearly west : Carrigoona
mountain is seen on the right hand side of the picture ; only the
summit of the quartzite knoll in the middle distance is visible when in
the field, where the boring operations are seen going on as described
subsequently.1
Experiment I.
Having secured the necessary permission, I took Mr. Stone first to
the field, E, Fig. 1, rather over an acre in extent, and asked him to
begin operations. He pulled out a slender forked twig from his pocket,
and immediately walked round the field ; at one spot the twig forcibly
revolved, and he said we should find plenty of water there, less than
15 ft. deep. The spot was marked, and after traversing the field two
or three times he asserted that water was flowing from north to south
along a line or region he traced out, but that at the side of the field very
little, if any, water would be found.2 " Bore anywhere along this line,"
he said (see dotted line in Fig. 3), " and you will get plenty of water,
but very little or none over there," i.e., on the east side of the field.
The places were marked and subsequently fixed by measurement, so
that the marks could be removed. All round the field was a rough
stone wall, overtopped to a height of 8 ft. or 9 ft. by a thick gorse
hedge, so that it was impossible to see a plateau of rock that flanked
the east and west sides of the field beyond the boundary wall ; I
mention this for a reason that will appear presently. The field was
on the mountain side, it sloped downwards from north to south, was
uniformly covered with grass, and had no trace of water anywhere on
the surface.
Experiment II.
From this field we crossed the mountain and went to an enclosed
piece of the commons on the western side of Carrigoona, marked W on
the map, Fig. 1. Here, again, I asked Mr. Stone to select two test
places. He walked round the field, but there was no motion of his
forked twig. It so happened a friend had purchased this field in order
to erect a summer cottage, and particularly wanted to find a spring.
Noticing a patch of rank and very green grass I asked him to try that
spot. " No good," he said ; " it's no good boring anywhere in this
field ; there is little or no water." Pressed to try once more, he fixed
on one spot as best to bore, but said only a little water, "of no use,'

the two dots marked in W, Fig. 1.
Experiment III.
Three weeks later a country gentleman, Mr. J. H. Jones, of
Mullinabro House, Waterford—who some years ago accidentally
discovered that the rod moved in his hands, and had had some success
in his own neighbourhood as an amateur dowser—kindly agreed, at

my request, to try the same fields. Mr. Jones had never been in that
district before, and knew nothing of the places marked by Mr. Stone.
These marks had been carefully removed prior to Mr. Jones' visit.
As before, Mr. Lefroy accompanied us, and we agreed to let Mr. Jones
go round the fields alone, so that no hint could be derived from any
involuntary indications on our part. Mr. Jones used a small, slender
forked twig, which he held in the same way as the elder Mullins. We
xxxvin.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 149
went, first, to the larger field on the east of Carrigoona. On completing
his perambulation of the field we examined the places marked by Mr.
Jones. The spot where the twig moved most vigorously with him,
and where he was confident we should find water, was not a foot
distant from the place selected by Mr. Stone, as we found subsequently
by measurement with the tape. This was at No. 1, in Fig. 3. Mr.
Jones also asserted the watercourse ran from north to south in the field,
in the same direction as marked out by Mr. Stone ; but from the
movement of the twig he asserted we should also find water a few feet
on the east side of the place marked No. 1, but flowing towards Stone's
line. We then crossed the mountain to the smaller field on the western
side ; after Mr. Jones had traversed it with his " rod " he said much
as Mr. Stone did, that very little, if any, water would be found there.
Borings.
It was not until July, 1899, that the boring apparatus arrived.
Mr. Stone had kindly placed it at my disposal, so that the only
expense incurred was for labour and the services of his brother, Mr.
E. Stone, who was a skilful working engineer. A four-inch bore-hole
was made in each case; a hardened steel "jumper" and the usual boring
tools being employed. Fig. 4, p. 146, shows the boring apparatus at
work. Mr. E. Stone is standing on the left of the picture, and the men
are boring with the jumper. The thick gorse hedge is seen round the
field. From conversation with the farmer who had tilled the
eastern field for many years, we expected to reach the bed rock
some 6 ft. below the surface, and I anticipated a laborious and
costly boring if we were to get anything better than surface
water. As I had taken a farmhouse for the summer on the northern
slope of Carrigoona, I was able daily to inspect the result of the
boring operations. We commenced at the spot marked No. 1 in
Fig. 3, and a foot below the surface struck a very hard dry clay ;
this went on for a depth of 8 ft., with slow progress, until suddenly,
after two days' work, a bed of sand was encountered, through which
the "jumper" sank, and water rushed up the bore-hole to within
4 ft. of the surface. After 4 ft. of sand a bed of gravel was reached,
but the quantity of water was so great that the sides of the lower
part of the bore-hole were constantly washed in, and we could not
sink deeper until a lining tube .was obtained. As this could only be
procured in London, we proceeded to test the east side of the field,
where Mr. Stone said little or no water would be got. Here No. 2
bore-hole was sunk, and nothing but a hard clay, with stones intermixed
in one part, was met with till the rock was reached at a depth of
12 ft., when a little water was found between the rock and the
impermeable stratum above it. I made them continue boring to a
150 [part

depth of 1 ft. 6 in. into the solid quartzite rock, but no more water was
obtained. We then began No. 3 bore-hole, on what Mr. Stone called
the "water-line." The boring was similar in its results to No. 1, the
water-bearing permeable stratum being struck 6 ft. below the surface,

and abundant water rose in the bore-hole. The boring was continued
when a bed of soft plastic clay was reached, and after this a hard clay
mixed with pebbles. I was astonished at not reaching the rocky bed,
and determined to continue the boring ; after we had gone to a depth

hole at a spot that seemed to uie most likely to yield water, where the
ground appeared moister, and was covered by a patch of rank grass.
The boring, No. 4, in Fig. 6, proved difficult and very tedious. Instead
of clay a rocky débris mixed with clay was encountered below the
surface-soil ; at 9 ft. deep the bedrock was reached, and, thinking we
might strike a fissure it was bored to a depth of nearly 3 ft., but not a
drop of water was obtained. Then I had a bore-hole sunk at the spot
fixed on by Mr. Stone as likely to yield a little water, but " no use,"
as he remarked, (this is No. 5 bore-hole) ; here, after the shingle, we

reached a hard dry clay, and continued boring through this until the
rocky bed was encountered at a depth of 14 ft. from the surface, but
no trace of water was found. This field slopes sharply down from east
to west, and No. 5 borehole is at some 10 ft. lower level than No. 4,
which is on the upper eastern side of the field. . Finally, I had a small
trial bore made at the lowest point in the field adjoining the mountain
road, but only dry shingle, and no sign of water, was met with. Here,
again, Stone's predictions were verified ; there might have been a little
water between the impermeable clay and the rocky bed when he made
his trial at Easter, as it was then in the early spring, after rains.1 The
borings were all made in the long drought we had during the summer

the bottom of this bore-hole, see P.S. to his memorandum, p. 150.

of the present year ; it was, therefore, all the more astonishing to
find such a good supply of water in the No. 1 and No. 3 borings in the
eastern field.
After the perforated lining tube had arrived we were able to go on
boring in No. 1 hole, but found a second bed of clay below the gravel,
and reached no rock, though we went down 20 ft. All the water was
therefore supplied by the permeable layer between the two impermeable
clays. In order to test the quantity, I procured a pump and 15 ft. of
iron tubing, and found that No. 1 bore-hole yielded five gallons a
minute, which, if the supply held, would be equivalent to over 7,000
gallons in the 24 hours. After pumping 10 minutes, however, the
pump choked, and the water was then found to stand 8 ft. from the
surface ; it had been lowered about 4 ft. in the four-inch bore-hole.
The water was flowing in all the time through the perforations in the
lining tube, but not sufficiently rapidly to maintain a constant level, as
the pump was a powerful one. The temperature of the water was some
20 deg. F. below that of the air. No. 2 bore-hole contained so little
water that we were able, in a few minutes, almost to empty the bore
hole by ladling out the water with a small tin can. The pump had
to be sent back to Dublin for repair, and another trial was postponed
till early in November, as my geological friends thought a more crucial
test would be afforded at that period of the year.
I will now give the account of Stone's visit, which Mr. Lefroy
kindly sent to me.
August, 1899.
On April 2nd, 1899, Professor Barrett invited me to accompany him and
Mr. Stone, an English "dowser," to a field in the Rocky Valley, co. Wick-
low. We drove directly from Bray station to the field, which is enclosed
by a high stone fence, partly covered by a gorse hedge. The configuration
of the immediately adjacent land cannot be seen from the field, owing
to its situation and the height of this fence and hedge. The area is between
one and two acres in extent. Mr. Stone had no opportunity afforded him of
examining the surroundings of the field except upon the side of approach,
nor did he, I fully believe, receive any information on that subject, to which
he made no reference in my hearing, and was apparently indifferent. I
watched him closely, but saw no sign of attention on his part to surface
indications, if any existed.
He traversed the field in various directions, holding a fork of the
divining rod between the forefinger and thumb of each hand. His manner
was that of easy confidence, and he readily maintained a conversation at the
same time. At certain points the rod in his hands was violently twisted.
One of these points, marked "No. 1" on the plan, Fig. 3, he stated to be that
most suitable for boring purposes and he declared that a sufficient supply
of water for domestic use would be found there at a very moderate depth.
To the best of my recollection he said not more than 15 ft., but of this I am
not now certain. The other points at which the rod was notably contorted
154 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part
were in a line south from this, which he attributed to the existence of an
underground watercourse. The direction of this is shown on the plan by
the dotted line.
The positions of these points Professor Barrett and I measured at once
and noted on a rough plan. The line of the asserted watercourse was
marked by taking the distances from the side of the field. Except on
that line, only very slight movements of the rod were anywhere observable,
and an area in the eastern portion of the field was designated by Mr. Stone
as practically waterless. The test boring subsequently made in this area is
marked "No. 2" on the plan.
On April 22nd, I again visited the place with Professor Barrett and Mr.
Jones, of Waterford, an amateur "dowser." The same conditions were
repeated. He saw no more of the surrounding land than was strictly
unavoidable and appeared to pay no attention to that or to any indications
other than those furnished by the "rod." No marks had been left by
which the places selected by Mr. Stone as yielding water could have been
identified or guessed at. Mr. Jones walked over the field as Mr. Stone had
done, the "rod" behaved similarly in his hands, and his results were
practically the same. The difference of a foot or so in the "best" point
selected may be reasonably attributed to his crossing the line of the water
course referred to at a different point.
From this field, which is on the eastern side of Carrigoona Hill, we went,
on the day first mentioned, to the western side, and Mr. Stone was asked to
find a spring in a small field on that side. He walked over this field in the
same manner with the rod, and said that no water, or so little as to be
useless, would be found in it,—that there were traces of water at a certain
spot, but that it would be "no good boring." Mr. Jones also went with us
to this other field and he confirmed what Mr. Stone had said of there being
little water to be found there. -n o n t
B. St. G. Lefroy.
P.S.—Since the borings have been made, I have measured and verified
their positions with Professor Barrett, and on November 5th, 1899, I again
visited Carrigoona, and made a careful examination of the borings. In the
field on the eastern side, the one first tried by Mr. Stone, I found the water
in boring marked No. 1 in the plan [see Fig. 3] standing 6 ft. from the
ground level. The water in boring No. 3, on the line of the watercourse
alleged by Mr. Stone to exist, stood 6 ft. 3 in. from the surface of the
ground. The boring No. 2 was dry. In the field on the western slope of the
hill I found the upper boring [No. 4] quite dry, and the lower boring [No. 5]
had four or five inches of water in it [Fig. <5], These results agree with the
predictions made by Mr. Stone, and also by Mr. Jones, before the borings
were made. B gT Q L
Although the excellent maps of the Irish Geological Survey had
given me a general knowledge of the suitability of the locality chosen
for the experiments before they were made, it seemed desirable that
the opinion of some recognised geological authorities should be obtained.
For this purpose I asked some of my geological friends, who were
xxxviii.] 0?i the So-called Divining Rod. 155
intimately acquainted with the geology of that district, to visit the
fields where the experiments were conducted, and I gratefully acknow
ledge their kindness in doing so and furnishing me with the accom
panying valuable reports. It would have been fairer to the dowser
had I asked the geologists to come be/ore the borings were made, as
the depth (which I informed them) to which borings Nbs. 1 and 3
were made, and yet no rock reached, revealed the unsuspected fact
that the field was on the site of an ancient and deep V-shaped
depression or narrow valley between the rocks, probably an ancient
river bed now filled with drift. The first report is from my friend and
colleague Professor Grenville Cole, F.G.S., the professor of geology in
the Royal College of Science, Dublin.
August 20th, 1899.
(i) The Rocky Valley is cut by denudation through the ancient series of
shales and sandstones, altered to slates and quartzites, which occur in the
Sugar Loaf area,1 at Bray Head, and at Howth. Unless a fissure were
fortunately struck, it would be very difficult to find water in this series. It
is not a water-bearing series in itself, as is well known to residents at
Howth, who are in the habit of collecting rain and surface-water.
But in the Rocky Valley area, considerable deposits of glacial drift occur,
varying from clays to permeable sands, filling all the ancient hollows carved
in the slates and quartzites. A trained eye readily picks out, by contour
and the green or cultivated patches, the position of the sands and gravels
where they abut on the older series.
The heights are formed of slate and quartzite, on which heather and
some thin bogs accumulate.2 The rainfall on these is considerable, and
soaks off down into the old waterways, carved before glacial times, in the
rocky bed. As these hollows are full of drift, the drift, where sand and
gravel prevail, absorbs the water. The supply at any point, by tapping the
drift, must depend greatly on the extent of the impervious gathering-
ground round about, and would, in any case, probably diminish in autumn
after a dry summer.
(ii) The field selected for boring in the Rocky Valley shows a marked
green surface, with the hard quartzite sloping steeply down close at hand on
either side. It falls towards the valley, and so, evidently, does the old
rocky bed under the infilling of drift. Water would accumulate in the
infilling, and would probably flow slowly down along the middle line of the
old hollow. Its constancy may be doubted, but can be tested satisfactorily
after the present dry season (August, 1899). A trained eye would certainly
select the central line of the field, along the ancient stream-hollow, for
Grenville A. J. Cole.
1 The "Sugar Loaf" is the miserable n^dern name given to one of the most
beautiful and impressive mountains in the co. Wioklow, a mountain rising to
nearly 1700 ft. high, and flanking one side of the Rocky Valley as Carrigoona
does the other.—W. F. B.
2 This refers to the Sugar Loaf, as there are no bogs on Carrigoona.—-W.F.B.

Profexsor W. F. Barrett.
In a subsequent letter Professor Cole says :—
I think a professional engineer would undoubtedly bore two or three
holes along the line under which the two rock slopes at either side meet ;
this line might or might not be along the lowest line of the hummocky
surface of the field above, where the borings were made. I am clearly of
opinion that a casual visitor who knew anything about general conditions
of water supply would proceed a good distance from the obvious rock on
either side before he predicted a fair water supply. But I also feel with
you that the rapid survey and determination in two minutes or so [by the
dowser] show either exceptional powers of observation or confidence in
some power not possessed by ordinary engineers.

looking east.
With all deference to my friend Professor Cole, I am quite sure
that the rocky contour immediately on each side of the field was not
observed by Mr. Stone, nor could it be seen from the side that we
approached. It requires a trained geological eye, after traversing the
ground round about, to arrive at the conclusions stated by Professor
Cole. I myself had been over the place dozens of times, having spent
two summers in the neighbourhood, and I confess that before the borings
were made there appeared to me no evidence that the " hard quartzite
sloped steeply down close at hand on either side," leaving a deep
ravine filled in with glacial drift. As can be seen to some extent from
the photograph reproduced in Fig. 7, to all appearance the local
xxxvni.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 157
opinion seemed probable enough—that the field was simply a layer of
a few feet of clay over a rocky bed which was nearly level from east
to west.1
It was desirable, in order to decide the question as to the exact
levels of the respective bore-holes, that a careful survey of the field
should be made For this purpose my friend and former student,
Mr. J. A. Cunningham, B.A., kindly assisted me in taking the levels
shown in Figs. 8 and 9 on the next page. In these diagrams the
vertical scale is exaggerated five times the horizontal, the surface
depression shown in Fig. 8 not being perceptible in the field. These
diagrams illustrate the probable geological sections of the field from
bore-hole No. 1 to No. 2, nearly west and east, and also the section
from north to south. It will be observed in Fig. 8 that the
nearly dry borehole No. 2 is actually a little lower than the
water-bearing hole No. 1. Possibly water might be found between
Nos. 1 and 2 ; in fact, Mr. Jones predicted it would be a few
feet to the east of No. 1. But this can only be settled by boring at
intervals across from west to east ; I hope to be able to do this
eventually. As the bed rock was not reached in bore holes Nos. 1 and
3, its representation in both sections is in part imaginary, as is the
lateral extent of the layer of sand in Fig. 8.
For the next memorandum I am greatly indebted to my friend
Mr. J. R. Kilroe, of H.M. Geological Survey of Ireland. Mr.
Kilroe, it will be remembered, gave me the benefit of his geological
knowledge in the famous Waterford case described in the previous
Report, and on the present occasion he at once responded to my
request and, at considerable inconvenience, came from a distance on
purpose to inspect the field.
Carrigoona Hill, rising to the moderate height of 802 ft. above the sea,
commands one of the most attractive and varied panoramas in Wicklow.
From its foot, eastward, spreads the park-like country containing and
adjoining Kilruddery, the Earl of Meath's demesne, to the town of Bray
and the sea beyond. North-westward the hill overlooks the Dargle Valley
which separates it from the Dublin and Wicklow Mountains. Southward
the eye is attracted by the valley of Killough, from which, on its east side,
rises almost precipitously the Great Sugarloaf Mountain to a height of
1,659 ft. —this beautiful conical hill being separated from Carrigoona by the
narrow, weird gorge known as the Rocky Valley. Further eastward the
Little Sugarloaf Mountain bounds the landscape beyond the vale of
Kilmacanoge.
The hills named above—Carrigoona, with the Great and Little Sugarloaf
,—constitute a group standing above the general level of the surrounding
country, a circumstance attributable to the greater resistance offered to

disintegration by quartzite, which forms the hills, than by the slate rock
which prevails in the lower ground. Bands of slate also occur with the
quartzite ; and the results of unequal denudation are apparent in the
uneven—in some places, rugged—aspect presented by the higher ground.
The rocky bed is largely covered with a mantle of glacial drift, which,
though chiefly occurring in the low ground, is of fairly general distribution,
resting in various places on the hill-sides, and partially filling hollows
between crags. In these latter cases, the drift consists of local rock
detritus, chiefly a mixture of sand, clay, and pebbles of slate and quartzite.
Limestone pebbles also are interspersed in the drift which skirts the hill
slopes ; but few, if any, are to be found at higher elevations. The drift in
the latter positions usually contain lenticular layers of sand and gravel,
which form favourable reservoirs for underground water.
Alluding to the immediate topography of the ground experimented upon
(E, Fig. 1), it is situated on the south-eastern slope of Carrigoona Hill, adjoin
ing the Commons, that is, the heathery and rocky portion of the hill near its
summit. Descending the slope, one observes crags of quartzite jutting up
on either side of a hollow, which is partially filled with drift of the character
described above. The south-eastern drainage of the hill would naturally
in part flow along this hollow, and would rapidly disappear, were there
no drift. The drift, however, intercepts the drainage, and would merely
retard its flow were it quite porous in texture ; but it is comparatively
impervious, with the exception of the sand and gravel layers ; and whatever
drainage-water percolates through, reaches and is retained by the layers,
which consequently are ready sources of supply when tapped.. These are
almost horizontal, probably dipping more or less from the sides towards the
centre, and somewhat basin-shaped when spreading to any extent over the
area occupied by the field. Hence, when such a stratum is pierced, the water
rises to a height in the boring corresponding to its head in the basin-shaped
layer—higher than the layer at its centre ; and practically to the same height
in borings which tap the same source—as in the case of the two successful
borings with which we are concerned here.
Judging, then, from geological data, the nature of the ground would
suggest as the most promising site for a water-boring, a point, say, midway
between the quartzite crags—perhaps a little nearer to the western crag
than the eastern, say 40 yds. from the former and 60 from the latter. The
successful borings [Nos. 1 and 3] have, on the dowser's advice, been put
down some 22 yds. from the west side of the field (lying immediately
between the crags) and some 70 yds. from the east side.
It is very improbable—at least, very difficult to understand—that a
merely casual visitor to the place, however shrewd, if not versed in
geological facts, could divine the existence of water in the field by a
cursory inspection, much less indicate with any accuracy the spot and
depth at which it would be found. The success attending the experiment
here .is rendered the more striking by the dowser's additional prediction
that water would not be found in the other field at the west side of
Carrigoona (W, Fig. 1) ; though, to the ordinary observer, there would
appear to be at least as much probability of finding a supply in this
place as in the one above described. j j^ Xilroe.
160 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part
Mr. Kilroe s opinion is all the more valuable as he is a recognised
authority on the " drift," and it will be seen, from the last sentence in
his interesting and full report, that he regards the dowser's prediction
as very curious and remarkable, and, a fortiori, still more striking
as having been given before any knowledge of the nature and slope of
the underlying ground had been obtained.
For my own part, I do not think geological knowledge, nor even
observation of the rocks of the neighbourhood, has anything to
do with the dowser's success. If a plausible explanation is to be
found, it is much more likely to be in the impression made upon
the dowser by some surface indications of water. This impression
may be an entirely subconscious one, and probably is more effective
when it is so, and it ultimately evokes the involuntary motion given
to the twig: for it certainly is involuntary—a purely reflex action—in
a genuine dowser.
Although there were absolutely no indications of water in the
experimental field, E, Fig. 1, yet on the way up to it there is a small
spring (marked S in the map, Fig. 1) emerging from the rock,
and flowing over the grass beside the road. This spring is not
derived from the field, but comes from quite another direction,
though a casual observer could not tell this.1 A little beyond
there is also evidence of some feeble springs.2 Mr. Stone may
have rapidly, and more or less unconsciously, perceived all that I
have described, and when he traversed the field his subconscious
self may have made good use of this information, and drawn a very
happy but accidental conclusion therefrom. It could hardly have been
his conscious self, for he was talking to me of other matters all
the time, and appeared quite as astonished as I was when the twig
forcibly leapt up and twisted round as he crossed the dotted line
on Fig. 3. There was a barely perceptible contraction of the
muscles of the hand when the twig thus vigorously turned ; the
movement is one that I never yet found any one able consciously to
imitate without a good deal more visible muscular exertion. But
that matter I will refer to again later on.
As regards Experiment II., where it will be remembered no water
was found, there is in one corner of the field a hole some 6 ft. deep,
with the débris from it lying about. This hole is quite dry, and, of
course, the nature of the surface-soil can be seen from the sides of the

hole and the débris, which consists of shingle and rocky débris. Mr.
Stone passed sufficiently near the hole to have examined it if he wished
to, but he seemed to pay not the least attention to it. Again, however,
this dry hole may have been the means of setting his subconscious
self to work, and have led to the result already described. It would,
however, have been an unsafe induction from any conscious process of
reasoning, for the boring No. 5 revealed quite a different material
beneath the surface from that in the hole and in No. 4 boring, which
was on the same level as the hole.
I have now placed on record all the information about these
experiments which my geological friends and careful observation have
enabled me to obtain, and I leave the matter to the judgment of each
reader.
§ 2. Experiments at Kingstown.
Experiment IV.
When Mr. Stone was in Ireland he came to Kingstown, and I asked
him to see if he could find any underground water in the De Vesci
grounds which are in front of my house. This place had already formed
the subject of experiment, see Part XXXII., p. 175. Though I did
not inform Mr. Stone of this fact, he might possibly have read of it in
the previous Report, and hence I do not attach much, if any, value
to this experiment, though, even assuming he had a vague recollection
of the plan given in the former Report, it would have been of very
little service to him. Referring to that plan (p. 175) the site of a
disused well is marked : it is entirely concealed beneath the lawn, and
only one or two persons know of its existence. The rod moved
vigorously directly Mr. Stone passed over this spot, and he asserted a
spring existed below, which he traced across the gravel path to the
centre of the wood marked "shrubbery" on the plan; here, he
declared, a plentiful supply of water would be found. To fix the
place a snap-shot photograph was taken of Mr. Stone at this moment,
see next page. Mr. J. H. Jones also tried the sameplace before he
visited Carrigoona with me, and he, too, from the prompt motion of
the " rod," fixed on a spot very close to that selected by Mr. Stears and
Mr. Stone. There is no doubt water does exist below this spot, at no
great depth ; but whether it is generally diffused surface-water or not
1 have no means of knowing. There is a famous ever-flowing spring
on a lower level not far from the grounds, but this was unknown to
the dowsers. More to the point is the fact that by careful observation
one can see a very slight circular depression on the evenly-covered
sward, where the mouth of the well once existed. This possibly may
have started a similar subconscious suggestion in each case ; any

information or involuntary suggestion from myself or others was
guarded against. In any case the experiment cannot be regarded as
of much value, though the triple coincidence is certainly curious.1
Experiment V.
One other experiment I made with Mr. Stone. He told me that
he had been able to detect buried water pipes or drains when water

snap-shot of mr. stone dowsing.
1 As these pages were passing through the press a curious incident occurred in the
De Vesci grounds, which removes all doubt of there being a watercourse at one of
the very spots marked by all three dowsers. Here, after long continued heavy rain,
the earth suddenly full in, to the consternation of the gardener who was driving a
lawn-mower over the spot ; a deep hole was left, on examination of which by myself
and the gardener it was seen that an ancient-built watercourse (still carrying water)
ran some 5 ft. below the surface, and had broken in. The " oldest inhabitant " knew
nothing of this watercourse (for it was not a mere surface drain), and apparently led
to the old well which is supposed to be there.

was flowing through them, and he at once consented to try the
experiment in my presence. I therefore asked him to come into my
garden, under the surface of which ran a water pipe, and tell me when
the water was running or not. In the present case a water tap was
turned on and off at the back of the house, completely out of ear-shot
of Stone, who was in the front, and a system of signals was arranged
so that I knew when the water was or was not running ; the signals
could not be seen by Stone, nor would he have known their meaning.
As the house water supply comes through the buried garden pipe,
when the tap was turned on at the back a flow of water was at once
set up in the garden pipe. The result of this experiment showed that
the number of times Stone proved to be right was very little different
from the number given by pure chance coincidence. Hence this
experiment, so far as it goes, was adverse to the dowser's belief that
he could detect whenever water was running in a pipe.1 The elder
Mullins, now dead, was often successful, I am informed, in a similar
experiment, though I do not know what precautions were taken ;
except in the case narrated by my friend Master Bruce, and given
on p. 83 of the previous Report, and in the experiment by Mr.
Finch-Hatton given in Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. II., p. 102 ; but a good
many instances of success, under strict conditions, would be required
to be at all conclusive. A series of experiments of this kind were,
however, tried a century ago, with the famous French dowser Bleton,
and the results were certainly very remarkable (see p. 269).
This ended my experiments with Mr. Stone, and I have to thank
him for his ready courtesy in submitting to any test I wished, not only
without fee, but at some inconvenience to himself, as he put 'off an
engagement in England in order to stay a night in Kingstown at my
request. I intended to have tried blindfolding him and taking him
over the same ground the following day, but neither he nor I could
spare another day just then ; he promised, however, to submit himself
to that test when I or any friend could carry it out, either in England
or over here. An account of a successful experiment of this kind with
Mr. Stone is given in Part V., p. 210.
1 The pipe was only a small leaden one, about j in. bore. The experiment U each
a very simple one, and precautions to avoid misleading inferences can so easily be
taken, that I hope some of our members may be induced to test any dowser in their
neighbourhood who may be willing to try. I should be grateful for any information
on this point. Care must, of course, be taken that no other taps are turned on in the
house whilst the experiment is in progress, and that no sound of the running water,
either in the pipe or from the tap, reaches the dowser.

Cases where the Dowser found a Good Supply op Underground
Water near to a useless Well or Boring previously
sunk to as great or greater depth.
No. 1. The Sha7iklin Experiments.
Without multiplying the evidence needlessly, I will now give a few
more cases that have reached me where a useless well or boring having
been sunk without the aid of the dowser, the latter found a good supply
of underground water hard by, and at a less depth. Some forty cases of
this kind were given in the previous Report ; and although at first
sight such cases appear to afford strong evidence of some supernormal,
or at any rate some peculiar, faculty possessed by the dowser, a critical
investigation on the spot reveals that this conclusion is unwarranted
in many cases. Assuming that the dowser has a keen eye and con
siderable experience in his business, such successes could often be
explained by shrewd guesses on his part. Most geologists who have
so far overcome their prejudices as to believe the dowser may, to
some extent, be an honest man, would explain all his successes in
this way, attributing them to a conscious exercise of his power of
observation. For my own part, I venture to disagree : the geologist
speaks from his own experience, and rarely has he seen a dowser at
work or investigated the evidence on his behalf. It is certainly not
by a conscious exercise of his powers of observation that the dowser
usually succeeds ; sub-conscious observation and interpretation of
surface indications there may be, and doubtless often is—we may
call this instinct if we like. The question before us is, can we stretch
this explanation to cover the whole ground ?—for we are bound first to
exhaust every known or possible explanation. To enable the reader
to arrive at the geological evidence in the cases I am about to cite,
I am greatly indebted to my geological friends, Mr. E. Westlake,
F.G.S., and Mr. T. V. Holmes, F.G.S. The former has in several
cases conducted a critical investigation on the spot, and the latter has
in many cases appended valuable geological notes.
In the previous report (Proceedings S. P. R., Vol. XIII., p. 60)
a brief account is given of the success of two amateur dowsers at
Shanklin, in the Isle of Wight. Subsequently I visited the spot and
obtained fuller particulars at first-hand. As the case seemed one
eminently worthy of careful geological investigation, I requested Mr.
Westlake, F.G.S., to make an independent examination and report.
xxxvni.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 165
Accordingly he did so, and the accompanying able report which he
has drawn up is the result of his inquiries.
Report by E. Westlake, F.G.S.
On visiting the Isle of Wight in 1897 at Professor Barrett's
request, for the purpose of examining the cases at Wootton and
Arreton, criticised in the columns of Nature, I took occasion to
inquire into some experiments at Shanklin, cited on p. 60 of his
former paper, which were exceptional as having been made by mem
bers of the Local Board, who were themselves the dowsers. I found
that, though three or four eminent geologists had been previously
called in, they had altogether failed to find water, while the three
dowsers had been as uniformly successful. As the strata at the point
in question are as well known to geologists as any in England, this
result was rather unexpected, and I have therefore taken some pains
to get at the circumstances. After visiting the place on four
occasions, and through the kindness of Mr. Milman Brown, the
Chairman of the District Council (who has revised this account),
and others concerned, I am now able to give the main particulars,
which to make intelligible I will preface by a few words on the
geological situation.
The Shanklin reservoirs are in the Gault Clay a mile south of the
town, at the sources of the small stream which issues in the Chine.
The collecting ground is the southern mass of the Chalk and Upper
Greensand, the water issuing at the base of the latter where it rests
upon the Gault. The valley is a right-angle facing the north and
east, due to the main joints in the Greensand, which run E. and W.
and N. and S. The dip of the strata is 1 in 45 (1 £°) south. Along
the sides of the valley the Greensand has a local inward dip of from
2° to 8°, due to the slipping out of its base upon the Gault, forming
fissures which increase in size as they descend. On account, however,
of the tendency of the water to run southwards, the valley is un
favourably situated for springs, and on its sides one only has been
utilised, viz., on the south side just below the top cottage, The Retreat ;
the remainder are in the copse at the head of the valley.
Greatwood Copse, the scene of the water-finding, occupies a semi
circular hollow a quarter of a mile wide at the angle of the valley.
The effect of this hollowing is that the Greensand, which extends for
a quarter of a mile to the north, obtains in the copse a slight southern
face traversing the fissures aforesaid, and it is here that the springs
take their rise. The well (to be described presently) which was sunk
at a spot indicated by J. Mullins, the late famous dowser, is placed in
this southern face—the very best place, geologically speaking, i.e., on
166 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part
the above theory that the main supply comes from the north-east corner
of Shanklin Down. As the consumption of water in the town has been
continually increasing (in 1898 it was about 50,000 gallons a day),
while the supply has never been large (about 40,000 gallons in Septem
ber, 1898), there have been continual efforts to augment it, which, as
far as they relate to our inquiry, are as follows :—
The first wells in the copse, Mr. Brown informed me, were sunk in 1875
by the London engineers, Messrs. Quick. The east well, 150 yards west of
the road, is 55 feet deep, and held (September, 1898) 9 feet of water ; its
cover is 411 feet above Ordnance Datum (i.e., above sea-level). The west
well, 20 yards further in, is 420J feet O.D., and 65J feet deep, with 10 feet
of water. There is thus a difference of only 1 foot in the bottoms of the
wells. They are connected by a sub-water heading so as to form virtually
one well, and by a middle heading for syphoning purposes, the floor of
which averages 383 feet U.D. They supply, I am informed by Mr. E. C.
Cooper, the town surveyor, about 4,000 gallons a day. The water, when
syphoned, stood (September, 1898) at 366 feet O.D. When not syphoned
it stood (December, 1899) at 382 feet O.D. ; in winter it rises till it over
flows the outer sill of the middle heading at 388 feet O.D.
The upper heading, which is close by, was driven without expert advice
above a wet place in the copse, and followed the water in a westerly direction
for a distance of from 400 to 500 feet. This heading starts at a level of 401£
feet O.D., at a point 15 yards west of the middle heading and IS feet above
it. (See Fig. 12.)
About 1878 Mr. H. Bristow, F.R.S., F.G.S., of the Geological Survey,
was consulted by the Board, and visited the spot. On his advice the upper
heading was extended to a point about 900 feet west of the entrance
directly under the old chalk pit on Shanklin Down, but without getting any
appreciable addition to the flow of water. When I measured it in December,
1899, the quantity was 9,000 gallons a day, which, however, is below the
average ; the turncock, Mr. Whittington, said when the flow was good it was
double this. That hardly any water was found in Bristow's extension is
probably due, as pointed out by Mr. Topley, F.R.S., in a subsequent report,
to its having been driven " at too high a level " ; " water," he adds, "might
be found by a well or boring at the far end, but would probably not rise into
the heading."
In 1885 the Board consulted two other geologists, Mr. W. Topley,
F.B.S., of the Geological Survey, whose report in May of that year I have
just cited, and Mr. Mark Norman, author of a geological guide to the Isle of
Wight, but their schemes of sinking to the Lower Greensand were not only
costly but problematical.
In 1893, as a last resort, the Board called in Mr. John Mullins, the
well-known Wiltshire dowser, who marked several spots in the field to the
south of the reservoirs, but the conditions were too onerous for them to sink
there. On their own land, however, by the S. W. corner of the upper
reservoir, which was from 50 to 100 yards to the north of Mullins' marks,
they sank a well 30 feet deep, but without getting water. Then they got
Mr. Parsons, the Brading harbour-master, to bore at the bottom of the well

for 97 feet—i.e., to 127 feet from the surface—but he got no water, only
bad air, which suffocated him, his son, and his men, who were all found dead
in the well one morning in July. Mr. Thorn, of Manchester, continued the
boring from 200 to 300 feet deeper into the Lower Greensand, but after
diminishing the bore from 8 to 4 inches the Board refused to sanction a
further reduction and the boring was abandoned. The borehole is now
disconnected. The well has a supply from surface soakage of from 400 to
800 gallons a day, which is not used. I may remark on the foregoing that
Mullins' marks, being on the outcrop of the Upper Greensand, offered a
reasonable prospect for finding water, whereas the site chosen for the well at
a level of 373 feet O.D., being on solid Gault clay, could have only a little
from surface percolation.
In 1895 the Board consulted Mr. A. Strahan, F.G.S., of the Geological
Survey (who had re-surveyed the district), on the prospect of obtaining
a supply by a deep boring on the same site. In his report of September of
that year he says, "I do not think there is a more favourable site, from a
geological point of view, in the immediate neighbourhood." His plan, like
that of Messrs. Topley and Norman, was to sink some 400 to 700 feet, and
pump from the Ferruginous Sands below the sea-level; "but this," said
Mr. Brown, " would have cost us a great deal, and he could not promise us
anything certain when we got there."
Returning to Mullins' operations, it appears that after he came, early in
1893, two members of the Board, Messrs. Brown and Bailey, who had found
the twig turn in their hands, started dowsing in the copse on their own
account. They each found the twig turn at certain places nearly coincident ;
one of these places they found to be the same spot previously fixed upon by
Mullins. At this spot (No. 1, see map, Fig. 11) they sunk a well 26 feet
deep, and at two points of their own (Nob. 2 and 7) they sank wells 28 feet
and 64 feet deep. Though No. 1 is only 100 yards to the north of the
headings and No. 2 only 40 yards south, a good supply of water was found
in the three wells. No. 1 supplied, at first, 7,000 gallons a day ; No. 2,
about 10,000 gallons. No. 7 required, at first, nine days to pump it out ;
at the present time, however, it only supplies about 2,000 gallons a day.
In 1895, again following the twig's indications, they sank four more wells
(Nos. 3, 4, 5 and 6), in all of which water was found. Nos. 3 and 4 have
supplied from 1,500 to 2,000 gallons a day. No. 5, when dug, had 2 feet of
water which ran freely, but has since failed. No. 6 (72 feet deep) has not
been connected to the reservoir. These additional supplies, though quite
inadequate for a growing town, had, said Mr. Brown, kept them going for
the time being. The height of the ground at these wells (Nos. 1 to 7) I
found, by levelling from St. John's Church, to be 415, 415, 413, 419£, 447A,
465 and 466 feet O.D. All the wells are now covered over, except No. 7,
but I have ascertained their respective depths to be, approximately, 26, 28,
28, 30, 33, 72 and 64 feet ; their bottoms are, therefore, approximately, 389,
387, 385, 389J, 414£, 393 and 402 feet O.D. Hence, except in No. 5, the
water lies at levels between the middle and upper headings, showing the
dowsed water to come from the same stratum as that in the othor wells and
headings. In No. 7 the water stands at 416J feet O.D., so that the ex
haustion of No. 5 is probably due to its not having been sunk deep enough.
XXXVIII.] 169
On the So-called Divining Rod.
The geological position of Parson's well is in the Gault clay, which
is penetrated after the first 100 feet, the remainder of the boring being
in the sandstones of the Lower Greensand (Neocomian). Quick's wells
and the middle heading are in the passage-beds between the Gault and
Upper Greensand, which pass into one another insensibly. The upper
heading is mostly in the Upper Greensand, the base of which, according
to the Geological Survey, is a little below the path in the copse, and
coincides nearly with the 400 feet contour. The dowsed wells start in
the Upper Greensand, and, except No. 5, penetrate to the passage-beds.

The dowsers' first total includes the first flows (always exceptionally
large) for Nos. 1 and 2 ; in the second total, which I took in
December, 1899, after a very dry season, most of the wells had gone
dry. Thus, for comparison with the engineers' total, the dowsers'
first total is too large, and the second too small. To compare the
water found by them respectively, we ought properly to have figures
either for all the first flows, or for some time when the springs were
high enough to get flows from all the wells. Mr. Cooper writes
(July 11th, 1900): "I think if you put the value of the [dowsers']
wells at their best as a third the value of the headings, you will then
be stating their [relative] value very fairly." According to this
estimate, and taking the amount of excavation into account, the
dowsers obtained nearly twice as much water per foot as the other
water-finders. Of the success of the latter, five-sixths was due to
empirical means, one-sixth to the engineers, and none to the geologists
who went either above or below the proved water-bearing bed. The
dowsers on the other hand went straight to the point by putting their
wells into the water-bearing bed itself.
The relative professional failure, however, does not entitle the
dowsers' results to pose as mysterious. The top of the Gault is typically
water-bearing : the well-known landslip at East End, a mile or two
distant, is due to the water in this very bed, the level of which in the
copse was known from Quick's two wells. The probability, therefore,
of some water at this horizon no geologist would doubt. What they
did doubt was whether a useful quantity would be found in the copse
by driving or sinking at haphazard : thus in his report Mr. Topley says,
alluding to Mr. Bristow's attempt, " Galleries have been driven into
the Upper Greensand for the purpose of intercepting springs . . . and
I cannot recommend any further experiments in this direction." The
subsequent experiments of the dowsers, introducing ex hypotliesi a new
method of discovery, do not throw light on the problem of haphazard
sinking, except in so far as the doubtful utility of wells Nos. 5 and 6
tends to show that a useful quantity of water is not to be met with
xxxvm.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 171
everywhere. The results of the experiments may be considered under
their (1) qualitative and (2) quantitative aspects :—
(1) The finding of some water in all the dowsers' wells if claimed
as evidence for dowsing involves the assumption that water could not
be found everywhere by sinking into the passage beds. Between this
and the geological deduction that it probably could, there is no direct
evidence to decide. Quick's wells, though supporting the geological
view as far as they go, are close together, and inadequate for com
parison with the dowsers' seven distributed over the copse.
(2) The 50 per cent, superiority of the seven dowsed wells
assumes that Quick's wells represent the average of as many trials by
ordinary methods ; granting this, the superiority seems too slight to
exclude accident. In support of the dowsers' opinion that they had a
faculty for pitching on the right places, Mr. Brown mentioned that in
one or more wells they came on loose rubble like that filling the
fissures in the adjoining quarries, which made him think they had hit
on a "vent" (water-bearing fissure) : this was confirmed by Mr. Young,
the sinker of wells Nos. 2 and 7. Failing an examination of the wells
at the time, we can now only judge of the extent of this feature from
its probable consequences in an increased supply, so that it does not
add to the evidence. Hence the dowsers' success cannot I think be
pressed in either aspect, for want of proper terms of comparison.
There remains the broad result that for equal amounts of work
the dowsers got twice as much water as the engineers, while the
geologists got hardly any. As regards surface signs of water in the
copse I did not notice any in relation to the dowsed wells, and have
given the dowsers the benefit of assuming there were none. But the
absence of a reason for digging somewhere in particular may lead to
digging nowhere, and in such cases the rod may succeed by supplying
a motive for digging. The sceptic may urge, " the dowser turns the
twig and fortune does the rest." We see, however, that geological
explanations of dowsers' successes do not necessarily show that the
geologists would have found the water themselves.—E.W.
No. 2. The Errol Case.
The following case is of interest, as it was first published in the
columns of one of the leading engineering journals, The Engineer, for
October 8th, 1897, after an editorial note on the Divining Rod. The
writer of the accompanying letter to The Engineer is a member of a
well-known engineering firm in Perthshire :—
Errol Works, Errol, Perthshire, October 1st, 1897.
Referring to your article on the above subject, as you say of your
self, " There was no one in the world more anxious to believe that these
172 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part
divinations were hoaxes than I was." The worst of it is, they will keep on
succeeding. I will give you my own experience. A. gentleman in this
parish—Mr. Clark, of Taybank—started above where he thought he would
get water. He went down, I think, over 460 ft., and got none. He heard
of a water-finder, now deceased—Mullins by name. Of course, he did not
believe in him, but thought he would give him a trial. A lot of folks turned
out to see him, amongst them the Rev. Robert Graham, LL.D. My father
and I were also present. I was quite sure there was nothing in it. Mullins
was first taken to the bore Mr. Clark had in progress. He was not told it
was a failure. He was taken over it with his V-shaped hazel twig, and
asked how much water would be got there. He said, " You may go down
hundreds of feet, and you will not find any water." He—Mullins — dis
covered water not fifty yards from this bore. He indicated its course, and
marked it by pegs driven into the ground. He told Mr. Clark if he went
down 40 ft. to 50 ft. he would get so many gallons of water, and, if what
he said was not true, he would pay for the digging of the well. Mr. Clark
dug it, and got the supply named at the depth stated. Mullins held the
ends of the V-shaped twig in his hands—an end in each hand—firmly.
Whenever he came over running water the twig turned round and
round, and, if held long enough, the twig twisted till it broke. When
Mullins had the twig in his hands, he more than once allowed me and
another party to take an end each, where the twig projected past his hands.
We held on as hard as we could, and with the turning of the V part of the
hazel twig, it was twisted till it hung by the bark. Yet another proof. I
took the V-shaped wand in my hand, and passed it over running water
without any result. Mullins laid his hands on my wrists, and grasped them
firmly, when the twig instantly began to turn, and continued turning till he
removed his hands. He never touched the twig while it was in my hands.
Whatever folks may say to the contrary, there is something in it. " Facts
are chiels that winna ding, and darna be disputed."
Duncan A. Morton.
In reply to my inquiries Mr. Morton writes :—
Errol Works, Errol, Perthshire, October llth, 1899.
Yours of 9th inst. came duly to hand. I regret that I never replied to
yours of October 14th, 1897. As I have not much time at my disposal, I
will reply as briefly as I can to your queries. Before Mullins came, Mr.
Clark had made a bore 430 ft. deep, and got little or no water, and that little
he did get was bad and generally supposed to come from some drains or
something of the kind. Mullins came and was taken over the bore with his
rod, and said, " You can go down a thousand feet and you will not find any
water there." He discovered a spring at once 100 yards from the bore at a
depth of 40 ft.—an abundant supply of good water—first-rate water, indeed.
Mr. Clark uses it yet, though there is a district supply now ! Mullins said
water would be got at a depth of 35 ft. to 40 ft., and if not, he would pay
for the digging of the well.
I was as determined against the rod as any man alive till I saw it, but I
could not shut my eyes to facts.
xxxviii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 173
I took the V-shaped hazel wand in my hand, and passed over where
Mullins said there was running water. The twig never moved, but when
ever Mullins grasped my wrists the twig turned round and round till it
broke and hung by the bark. I explained all this in my letter to the
Engineer, October, 1897.
I saw Mr. Clark, of Taybank, last night, and he gave me the particulars.
Mullins indicated the course of the running water, and we put in pegs, and
they just looked like (in an uneven line) the wriggling of a stream, and came
out right in line on the face of the rising ground with a drain which Mr.
Clark had made, and which he said cut through a stream of water.
I shall be glad to reply to any further inquiries from you.
Duncan A. Morton.
I have also heard much to the same effect from Mr. Clark, and, in
a subsequent letter, Mr. Morton informs me he has, at my request,
seen Mr. Clark again, and sends me the following additional par
ticulars. The exact depth of the useless boring was 432 ft. This
bore first went through a stiff blue clay or marl, turning to red
when deeper ; the water that was eventually obtained was insufficient
and not good. Mullins' well was dug 40 ft. and then bored to a total
depth of 80ft., when the water rose to within 12 ft. of the surface;
in spite of very dry weather and continual use it has never fallen
below 17 ft. from the surface. It was the old Mullins, now dead, who
was employed.
Mr. Holmes' geological comment on this case is as follows :—
Looking at the general geological map of Scotland by Geikie, I find Errol on
the " Old Red Sandstone " Series. The beds pierced in the deep boring were,
however, it is said, clay or marl. (It may be worth remarking that a name
such as Old Bed Sandstone only implies a series of rocks of a certain relative
age in which red sandstone is the predominant rock.) Of course clay and
marl are not likely to give a decent water supply at any depth. But close to
Errol come the alluvial deposits of the Carse of Gowrie, and these (or any
other alluvial deposits) would give a fiat surface, contrasting in the most
marked way with ground where Old Red Sandstone formed the surface beds,
and might furnish a good supply of water at 35 ft. or less. I don't know
the place, but the rough diagram below will explain the general difference. If
the river Tay ran through soft clay, the slopes outside the river deposits
would be more gentle in contour than would be the case with harder rocks,
but the practised eye would hardly fail to distinguish between slope and flat
whether on the Tay, the Trent or the Thames. T V H
The diagram showing the conjectured geological section, which Mr.
Holmes kindly adds to his note, is not reproduced, as it is of course
only a conjecture. I should be extremely obliged if any of my readers
in Perthshire would make further geological inquiries into this case, as
it is evidently one of considerable interest. It will be remembered
that it was old John Mullins who was the dowser in the famous
174 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part
Waterford case, which was so fully discussed in the previous Report.
The useless bore in that case was over 1,000 ft., and there were
absolutely no surface indications to guide him.
No. 3. The Lytes Cary (Somerset) Case.
The following is a very interesting case. The dowser, in this
instance, was an amateur, the late Mr. E. M. Hippisley, a leading
surveyor and land agent in "Wells, Somersetshire, who was singularly
successful as an amateur dowser (see p. 216). In a paper on his own
experiences in dowsing that he read at the Bishop's Palace, in Wells,
in April, 1892, he stated :—
At Lytes Cary [near Kingsdon, Taunton] there is an interesting old
English house with a chapel in good preservation, which, with some
modern [farmhouse] buildings, enclose a large courtyard. I found [by
dowsing] on the south side near the garden, indications of water, and had a
well sunk 25 ft. deep, in which the water rises to within 13 ft. of the surface,
and here a singular incident occurred. During the past year part of the
paving on the opposite side of the yard gave way, when an old well was
discovered 45 ft. in depth, but no water in it, and only 30 ft. from the
new well.
Mr. Westlake kindly went over to Lytes Cary and made a careful
examination of the surroundings, and of the geological conditions as
well as the facts of the case. He reports to me as follows :—
May, 1900.
" Lytes Cary is in the southernmost bend of the river Cary, in
Somersetshire. The farmhouse is in the occupation of Messrs. Porter
and Porter, who aided my inquiries in every way. I was first shown
the sites of the wells, both quite covered over and concealed ; they are
about 40 ft. apart. The old well was carefully built, and is 60 ft. deep
(not 45 ft., as Mr. Hippisley thought) so I was informed by the
estate builder, who had measured it himself. He told me also that
Hippisley's well is 25 ft. deep, sunk in the marl all the way down, and
the sides are strong enough to stand without masonry.1 It still con
tinues to give an abundant supply to the house, and contained 9 ft. of
water when last opened. There are also three other wells on the N.
and W. of the premises, about 190, 140, and 80 ft. distant from
Hippisley's well ; one of them, the furthest off, is 22 ft. deep, and
yields a small supply of " suspicious " water ; the second, which once
contained a few feet of foul water, has been filled up ; and the third
was long ago abandoned and used as a cesspool.
" The farm premises are all on level ground. The strata at the
farm, according to the geological survey, are Lower Lias, which, as
1 This does not necessarily show the strata were different.
xxxviii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 175
seen in quarries about a mile to the north, consists of the usual thin
limestones with partings of marl, and has little permeability except in
the vertical joints. The beds at the farm appear to underlie the
above, but there are no surface indications, geological or otherwise, to
show that water is more likely to be found at one spot than another.
Had the existence of the old well been known a geologist would have
been chiefly concerned to avoid its proximity. In finding water so
near it Mr. Hippisley certainly achieved the improbable, though, as
agent for the estate, he was thoroughly acquainted with the place,
except the existence of the old dry well, which had been lost sight of
by all. A characteristic of the Lower Lias is to hold water in unsus
pected fissures. This places the hydro-geologist at a disadvantage,
and renders this formation a suitable ground for dowsing, or chance
discovery, as the case may be. I have referred to other cases of the
dowser's success in the Lower Lias in my Report, p. 315.—E. W."
No. 4. The Sherburn-in-Elmet Case.
I heard that Mr. Stone had been engaged by the owner of some pro
perty at Sherburn-in-Elmet, Yorkshire, to find a water supply where a
well, over 150 ft. deep, already existed, but had run dry, and that
Stone had predicted by the " rod " that an abundant supply would
be found less than 50 ft. from the old well at a depth of 60 ft., and
that, upon boring, Stone's prediction was verified and a good supply
obtained. I wrote to the owner of the property, Mr. Lolley, for an
exact statement of the facts, and had the following reply :—
Northfield House, Lovell Road, Leeds, December 6th, 1899.
It is quite true we had a well 70 ft. deep; and had bored about 90 or
100 ft. from the bottom of the well without finding water. The well had
been in use about fifteen years, and always had a good supply until an
artesian well was sunk in the low-lying part of Sherburn, after which we
seemed to lose the water.
Seeing Mr. Stone's testimonials, I applied to him. Mr. Stone visited
Sherburn and said that there was a good supply of water some 60 ft. deep
beneath a place he indicated, about 15 yds. from the old well, and on the
boring being carried out the water teas found at 62 ft. deep.
Walter Lolley.
This case is of interest, and I should be glad of some further
information concerning it, especially of the geological character of
the locality. Sherburn-in-Elmet is midway between Leeds and York,
and Mr. T. V. Holmes, F.G.S., informs me it lies near the bottom
of the slope of the Magnesian Limestone, which here dips down to
the Old Red Sandstone that overlies it in the valley. I wrote to
176 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part
Mr. Lolley to ask if he had kept a record of the strata bored through,
and he replies :—
Leeds, December 28th, 1899.
The borehole at Sherburn was through limestone and clay, the rock is
the "Magnesian" limestone, and my property is on the eastern slope of
this ; in fact, the lower part of the village further east is on the alluvial
clay of the Vale of York. The water was found in a layer of gravel and
clay in the borehole after getting through the limestone.

No. 5. The Tiddington House (Oxford) Case.
The following letter appeared in the Farmer and Chamber of
Agriculture Journal for October 18th, 1897. The case is interesting
as the artesian well borers were attempting to bore through the
Oxford clay, whilst the dowser, as in many other cases, evidently found
a permeable surface stratum, of sand or gravel, above the clay.
Tiddington House, Oxford, October, 1897.
Being without water for my garden and stable, except what was fetched
by water cart some distance day by day and caught from rainfall, and this
altogether unsatisfactory, I experienced a great difficulty in getting a proper
water supply, and eventually decided to employ a firm of artesian well borers
to bore for water for my use in 1883. A spot was decided upon, and a
boring put down to a depth of 312 ft., which cost me over £300, and no
water whatever was obtained ; all I have for my money is the piece of
parchment containing the sections of the boring and a few samples of the
formation. ...
I engaged Mr. Tompkins to search my property for a water supply
. . . and instructed him to carefully test my stable yard, as this was the
site I was most anxious to find water on. After carefully searching this
property he reported that no water existed there, and that it would be simply
useless to attempt to obtain water here. I then informed him of what I had
previously done, aud the amount of money I had uselessly spent. Thus the
water-finder proved correct in his first test.
A move was then made into the gardens, and, after going over them, the
water-finder reported a stratum of water was running across the corner of the
garden, and was an overflow from a spring above. Ho traced up this stratum
of water. The twig he was using was a white thorn cut in the shape of a V,
which he held by the two prongs apex downwards. As he walked over this
stratum of water, the twig kept rising in front of him until he came to the
head of the spring l in the upper part of the paddock above, when it turned
completely over and over, and so strong was the upward movement of the
rod that it bent considerably in its frantic endeavour to turn over, and on
being held firmly by the water-finder, it broke off in his hand. Naturally,
we were all surprised and astonished at such a remarkable occurrence.
1 This is an absurd but favourite expression of Mr. Tompkins, who is under the
delusion that underground water originates in a reservoir, and that the higher up
you trace the " spring " the more copious the supply.—W. F. B.
xxxvm.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 177
I instructed Mr. Tompkins to prepare me an estimate to sink a well four
feet diameter in the clear, and to supply and erect a wind engine and storage
tank. The well was put in hand, and at a depth of 30 ft. water was struck.
The well was steined up before sinking deeper, and a strong pump put down
to keep the water under, and before sinking many feet it became necessary
to put on seven men to keep the water going. From the inrush of water
the bottom men were working up to their knees in water, and the moment
the pump and buckets stopped they were in danger of being drowned out.
The work proceeded under these circumstances for a week or so, until it
became useless to continue the work owing to the abundance of water ;
10,000 gallons per day being the yield of the spring at a depth of 37 ft., and
this site is at a higher elevation than my stable yard. I cannot speak too
highly of Mr. Tompkins' practical success, both as regards his finding water
and the satisfactory way in whSh he has carried out the work.
G. W. Bennett.
In reply to my inquiries Mr. Bennett confirms the statements in
his published letter and adds :—-
Tiddington House, Oxford, October 9th, 1899.
My well has never gone dry, neither this summer nor last, though it gets
low generally about November or December. The only drawback to the
windmill is, I find, we have not always enough wind to pump, and sometimes
we are four or five days without wind for pumping for drinking purposes.
There are [not] and never have been any wells near where Mr. Tompkins
found the water with the divining rod.
G. W. Bennett.
Mr. Holmes' comment on this case is as follows :—
Oxford stands upon "Oxford Clay," the thickness of which varies from
300 ft. to 600 ft. (Woodward). But over the greater part of the site the
Oxford clay is covered by gravel, which is usually from 8 ft. to 20 ft. thick.
And gravel on a higher level is often found to cap the plateaux of the
district. I do not know whether Tiddington House is in or near Oxford.
The unsatisfactory boring of 312 ft. was evidently in the Oxford Clay. But
the satisfactory supply was evidently from sand and gravel lying above the
Oxford Clay. But the gravel on which Oxford stands is not that deposited
by the rivers Isis and Cherwell, but is of the higher level and older date.
Where in Oxford and its suburbs, between the Isis and Cherwell, the ground
is covered by a thick mass of superficial sands, gravels, etc., there the ground
m likely to be higher than where the Oxford Clay is bare. And the contours
of the ground will tell at once to the practised eye where there is bare clay
and where there is a gravel-capping above it, or river-gravel at a lower level.
Of course, if, in this case, the successful sinking had been in the gravel of
the Cherwell or Isis, and the house on the Oxford Clay, it would have been
at a lower level than the house. It appears, however, to have been at a
higher level than the house—or at least the stable yard. Gravel seems to
have the same way of capping the highest ground in the Oxford Clay
country that it has in the London Clay districts.
T. V. H.
178 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part
Mr. Holmes' geological diagnosis of this case is confirmed by the
following letter, which I received in reply to my inquiry as to any surface
indications, and as to the nature of the boring and also the distance
apart of the useless boring and Tompkins' well. The sand or gravel
bed was evidently thicker than intimated by Mr. Holmes, and no doubt
the rush of water came when the well-sinkers got close to the under
lying impermeable clay. All the same, this does not explain how
Tompkins hit on the right spot, for " the practised eye " of the well-
sinkers who put down the useless bore, and that of Mr. Bennett's
gardener, failed to discover the right spot.
Tiddington House, Oxford, January 3rd, 1900.
The Tompkins well is on rather a higher elevation than where we bored
in 1883, and is quite 160 yards from that boring. The Oxford clay is
certainly capped by sandy grit or gravel. We first took off about 3 or
4 ft. of turf mould ; then went into a red sand which continued some
25 or 30 ft., when the water came in so fast they could not go on digging
the well. To the ordinary eye, no one could possibly have said where to hit
upon the spring. Mr. Tompkins went backwards and forwards in a zigzag
course with the twig till he came to what he calls " the fountain head,"
where he cut a sod out of the turf to show the well-sinkers where to begin
to dig the well.
I should say we are about 40 ft. above the level of the river Thames,
which connects with the Isis at Dorchester, Oxon., and there it is called
" Thamisis " or Thames. We are nine miles from Oxford, and nearly two
from the river Thames. Q w Bbnnett.
No. 6. The Chelford (Cheshire) Case.
The following letter appeared in the Manchester City News for
October 23rd, 1897. The writer is the head of a well-known firm of
chartered accountants in Manchester.
Bella Vista, Heaton Moor.
Having noticed the great amount of controversy that has of late been
manifested, together with the number of articles that have appeared in
various contemporaries, on the so called divining rod as a means of discover
ing water supplies, I venture to give you an account of my recent experience
with a water-finder and his work.
Having had occasion to obtain a new water supply for a house in Cheshire,
the opinion of a firm of artesian well borers was obtained. They recommended
that at a certain spot an artesian well should be sunk, with the idea of
tapping a spring of water, and at the same time to have the advantage of an
artesian well to ensure absolute purity. Accordingly a contract was obtained
and a well [boring] made, with the hope of finding a supply of water at a
reasonable depth ; and after several months' work, entailing considerable ex
pense, boring was carried to a depth of about 480 ft. But the long looked for
supply of water was not obtained, and after trying for some time to get a
supply of water from this deep well, I found that it was almost useless, and
xxxvin.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 179
in the end had to be abandoned as a failure. I then, for the first time,
sought the advice of a firm of water-finders who use the divining rod, and
having made an appointment with Messrs. John Mullins and Sons, Colerne,
Box, Wiltshire, I met a member of their firm on the estate.
In the simplest way possible he began to prospect the grounds for what
he called a spring, or water-bearing strata. Carrying in his hands a
V shaped hazel twig, holding the point downwards, with one fork in each
hand, he began to walk across the lawn, and after walking a distance of
about twenty yards he suddenly stopped, with the twig automatically twist
ing in his hands. He declared that here a spring existed at a depth from the
surface of not more than 40 ft. To convince me that he could not govern
the action of the twig in his hands, he requested me to grip the ends of the
twig, and so try to keep it from turning, but in trying to do so I was quite
powerless. After trying for some minutes to gauge the volume of the
spring, which he professed to do by the action of the twig, he then gave
what he considered to be the approximate yield of water per day, and pro
ceeded to trace the direction in which the spring was running. Having gone
into the kitchen garden, he said the spring was only 10 ft. from the bore
which had previously been made to so great a depth.
In order to prove that he had faith in his own method, he asked to be
allowed to undertake the necessary work, and to obtain the supply of water
which he had predicted, at the same time undertaking that if his predictions
were not substantiated, the work done by him would not be charged for. A
contract was entered into on these terms. As a result, the well has been
made, and, at a depth of 36 ft., a good supply of water has been found. The
water is of excellent quality.
I venture to trouble you wth these facts, because I think that this
method of discovering springs of water deserves to be better known.
Charles William Nasmtth.
I wrote to Mr. Nasuiith for some additional particulars and
received the following reply :—
69, Princess Street, Manchester, June 6th, 1898.
In reply to yours of the 31st ult. re the water supply at Mereleigh, Chel-
ford, I have very little to say beyond that which I gave in my letter
addressed to the Citg News of October 22nd, except that Mullins was quite
a stranger in the neighbourhood, and had no knowledge of the subsoils. He
first found the spring of water on the lawn, and traced its course from the
lawn to the kitchen garden, and the site he selected for the well was 10 ft.
from the deep bore, and at this site the well has been made, with the result
given in my letter, and the supply is still satisfactory.
The subsoil where the spring was found was sand, with about 13 ft.
of clay on the surface and clay below the level of the spring, but it appears
that in the old deep bore it was all clayey.
No other authority was previously consulted beyond the firm who did the
boring. They, I believe, worked by the geological chart of the neighbour
hood.
Charles William Nasmith.
180 Professor W. F. Barrett. [pakt
Mr. Nasmith also sent me a plan of the estate with position of the
useless boring and Mullins well, but this adds nothing to the informa
tion given in his letter. In reply to Mr. Nasmith, the artesian well
borers, Messrs. Timrains, wrote to the local papers to say that the well
sunk by Mullins merely yielded surface water and was therefore unsafe
to use for drinking, that the surface soil was sand and an old disused
well sunk in this sand existed close by. Mr. Nasmith, however,
maintains that the Mullins well does not yield surface water, but is
sunk below an impermeable stratum of clay. I submitted the whole
correspondence to Mr. T. V. Holmes, who writes in reply as follows :—
28, Crooms Hill, Greenwich Park,
London, S.E., June 11th, 1898.
As to the discrepancy between the accounts of Timmins and Nasmith as
to the strata at Chelford, I can offer only the following remarks :—My
experience of the sections obtained from well-sinkers and borers is that they
are extremely careful as to details, and go into more detail than a geologist
usually would. The well-sinker will not mistake darker-coloured sand, which
owes its special hue to saturation with water, for clay.
Then, if we suppose that there were locally 13 ft. of clay at the surface,
the water found in both old and new wells evidently came from the same
source, the lower part of the sand ; and if the occasional surface clay did not
protect the old well from surface pollution, it would not protect the new one.
As regards the deep boring, the new red marl would be mainly what
might be termed clayey, and its top would probably be not many feet
below the level of the water in the sand.
I enclose a rough diagram to illustrate the general nature of things.
The alternatives as regards water in the district are evidently that you
either get it from tho surface sand and gravel, or from the new red
sandstone hundreds of feet below. Any surface clay (supposing it not to
be made ground ; see subsoils memoir), being of no practical importance.
T. V. Holmes.
It is clear, therefore, from Mr. Holmes' letter that he regards the
clay as occurring in patches on the surface and affording no real
protection from possible pollution from surface drainage. In reply to
my further inquiries Mr. Nasmith informs me that the old condemned
well was 18 feet deep, the useless boring is 480 feet deep, whilst the
new well, the supply from which he informs me is still " very satisfac
tory," is 36 feet deep. Chelford is near Alderley Edge in Cheshire.
Shallow wells, certainly, often yield safe potable water, as is seen
from the following letter which I received from the Rev. J. G. Geare
in reply to my inquiries :—
Farnham Rectory, Bishops Stortford, May 26/7i, 1897.
In reply I beg to say that Mullins, junr., found on my rectory of three
acres a splendid spring of good water with his divining twig on September
xxxviii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 181
28th, 1893. He found water at less than 20 ft. depth. A boring was made
and a well (brick) was sunk to 15 ft. depth. The water was analysed, and
found good, and since then I have had a bountiful and unfailing supply
through a rotary pump action.
I may add that Mullins was always correct as to depth to sink a well
and the best place to bore. His was a first visit, and no test previous to
his had been made. j Q GeabEi Recfcor
Upon which Mr. Holmes remarks :—
Whether the water from surface beds is wholesome or not depends
largely on the density of the population around any given well. Nobody
can get water absolutely pure. But the poor geologist would hardly venture
to recommend surface supplies, for finding which the dowser is hailed as a
supernormally gifted benefactor. T V H
No. 7. The Welwyn Case.
The writer of the next letter is known to Mr. F. W. H. Myers,
who kindly sent me the letter.
The Node, Welwyn, Herts, October 30M, 1899.
I sent for a water diviner last summer, as I wanted advice about the
water supply here, our well not being satisfactory. When the diviner came
he at once found out the direction of the spring supplying my well and
advised me to make a heading in a certain direction which he marked, and
which I afterwards carried out, 150 ft. below the surface. The well-sinkers
found, before they had carried this heading 6ft., the inrush of water was so
great they had to stop, in spite of a steam engine which kept going night and
day with powerful pumps.
After trying every device for keeping water out of an accumulator house,
which always seemed to be rising, in spite of a concrete floor 6 in. thick, the
same diviner told me exactly where a spring caused the trouble. We tapped
it from the outside, and now the place is perfectly dry.
I held one side of the forked rod myself and the " diviner " the other, and
when we came to water [alleged underground water] the strain was so great
on my fingers I was obliged to ask him to stop. From the position of the
rod it was absolutely impossible for him to produce the pressure, which in-
creased with the strength of the stream. Montague Price.
The last paragraph of this interesting letter I will refer to again
when dealing with the motion of the rod. In reply to my inquiries
as to the name of the dowser, the geological strata, and whether any
surface indications or other wells existed to guide the dowser's choice,
Mr. Price replies as follows : —
The Node, Welwyn, Herts, Noeember 7th, 1899.
Anthony, of Huntingdon, was the "diviner" we employed here last
June. Nobody knew where the spring came from supplying the well.
182 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part
When the "diviner" arrived, being Saturday afternoon, the workpeople
had gone and I certainly did not know where the water came from. I was
with him all the time he was here, and he did not go down the well, which is
over 150 ft. deep.
There is no well anywhere near the existing one, and, so far as I know,
there was no surface indication to guide the diviner. In fact, he found the
spring on adjoining property, 50 yards from the well. We drove the heading
in the well (already existing) 150 ft. below the surface in pure chalk. Other
springs he found on my property, but I had no occasion to try them.
Montague Price.
Mr. Holmes explains this case as follows : —
In this case the supply from a well in the chalk 150 ft. deep being
unsatisfactory, the dowser simply recommended a heading. This is a
common and well-known contrivance in such cases. Water in the chalk,
the great water-bearing formation of S.E. England, circulates by the
lines of bedding and jointing, especially the latter. Where the lines of
jointing are feebly developed the supply of water from the chalk is usually
feeble—the permunent saturation leeel being of course reached. The usual plan
then is to drive a heading or headings in order to tap additional joint lines ;
one direction being about as good as another. T V H
Mr. Holmes' comment on the geological aspect of this case is that
the dowser simply advised doing what a skilled engineer or geologist
would recommend. But it must be remembered on the other hand
that the dowser probably knew nothing of geology or engineering ; I
doubt if he even knew that the well was in the chalk, as he came from
Huntingdon. Assuming, however, he knew all this, and was a
geologist in the bargain, how did he find out the direction in which to
make the heading which reached so large a supply " before 6 ft. " had
been driven? The Richmond headings1 were driven great distances in
the chalk under the advice of the best geologists and engineers, and
yet to a large extent failed to accomplish their purpose. Was it by a
mere bit of luck that here, as in many other cases, the dowser
succeeded ri

The next is a letter addressed to Mr. Stone, the dowser, from a
Mr. Stevenitt.
Minting, Horncastle, Lincolnshire, February 7th, 1898.
I beg to inform you that I dug a well at the second place marked by you,
viz., about 20 yds. from the stockyard in grass field, and found water. I
dug a well 42 ft. deep, so that I should have a good supply for the yard.
We have plenty for ourselves and several neighbours, who fetch it regularly

for drinking purposes. I feel sorry I did not know of you sooner ; it
would have saved me something like £200 in boring 290 ft., where I only
found salt water at 135 ft. deep. m „
I wrote to Mr. Stevenitt, who confirms the above statement and
tells me the useless bore is only 45 yards from the well. He was for
twenty-five years Superintendent of Police in the County Constabulary.
As regards this case Mr. Holmes remarks :—
In Lincolnshire the gratitude for good water at 42 ft. on the part of Mr.
Stevenitt is most intelligible. May it never be polluted by soakings from
the stockyard to any injurious degree.

No. 9.
The next letter is from the Managing Director of the Bermaline
Makings, Haddington, where Mr. Gataker was the dowser employed.
We may state that, previous to our communicating with Mr. Gataker,
we had decided to put down an artesian bore at a different part of our
ground. On arrival Mr. Gataker started over the ground at a fair speed
with the palms of his hands towards the earth. After proceeding some
distance he was able to locate a spring at the end of our new maltings. He
then proceeded over a strawberry field belonging to us, and at about 70
yards from where he located the first spring he located another. He
guaranteed that from either of those springs we would get a supply of about
20,000 gallons per day at a depth of from 100 ft. to 150 ft. We put down
a 4 in. bore at the first spring, and are pleased to say that at a depth of 102 ft.
we are getting a supply of about 100,000 gallons per day, and the water is
coming up with great force. We believe it will rise to about 40 ft. above
the surface. We tested it at 13 ft., when it overflowed with a strong
pressure.
We challenged the editor and readers of an Edinburgh evening newspaper,
who seem to think that water was to be found in any part of our ground,
to put down a similar bore half-way between the two springs located by Mr.
Gataker in our ground, and if the same quantity of water was found at the
same depth we would pay the expense of putting down the bore, and if not
found, the party challenging was to pay the expense ; but up to now the
challenge has not been taken up by any one.
It might interest your readers to know the strata the bore went through,
and we have much pleasure in enclosing you a copy of the journal, from
which you will see that it was after piercing 14 in. of the fourth layer of
sandstone that the water was struck, and as soon as the crust of this layer
was broken, the water came away with a rushing noise.

Managing Director.
184 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part
It is to be regretted this challenge was not accepted, as it would
have been a very crucial test, though, from geological considerations,
we are disposed to think the newspaper would have won. Mr.
Montgomerie, however, in his letter to the Edinburgh newspaper,
states his reasons for believing that water would not be found " at
any part of the valley of the Tyne." He says :—
Bermaline Makings, Haddington, January \ith, 1899.
During the excavations for the new bridge here, there was dug out a
hole 40 ft. square by 13 ft. deep alongside our mill dam, with only about
3 ft. of an embankment between the water and the hole. We naturally
expected that this hole would be filled up with water rising through the
gravel bed ; but to our surprise there was not a drop of water came up.
Any water that found its way into the working came in at the north-east
corner—that is, the corner furthest from the river.
There is a firm in East Lothian, not far from Haddington, who put down
a bore without calling in the aid of a " water-finder." They have, I believe,
sunk it to a depth of 660 ft., and, failing to find water, have had to abandon
the bore.
I should be glad of any further information regarding the deep
bore-hole here mentioned, as neighbouring artesian wells do not
usually vary like this.
In reply to my inquiries Mr. Montgomerie states that his success
ful borehole is about 100 ft. above the sea level ; he sends a "journal
of the bore," showing the strata passed through. First, 20 ft. of
sand and gravel, then 6 ft. of boulder clay, followed by 19 ft. of fire
clay, after that 45 ft. of sandstone and what are called " faikes " in
alternate layers, then 8 ft. of marl, and, finally, sandstone, the depth
of the bore being nearly 103 ft.
No. 10. The Aspley Heath (Bedford) Case.
The next case is also one where a deep, unsuccessful bore had been
made prior to the dowser's visit. The account here given was pub
lished in the Midland Counties Herald for April 7th, 1»98.
A Bedfordshire gentleman, Mr. Plater, wanted water for his house, so got
a firm to sink a well 60 ft. deep, this being the depth at which it was expected
water would be found. However, none was found, and then sinking was
continued to 100 ft. deep, but still without success. A bore was then put
down at the bottom of this well a further 66 ft. deep, making a total depth of
166 ft., but still no water. At Mr. Plater's request a water expert visited
the place, and said it was useless to continue working at that spot, for
no water would be found ; but he felt absolutely confident that by sinking
a well at a spot only 39 ft. from there, there ought to be a plentiful supply
of water at about 100 ft. or so. Mr. Plater acted on his advice, and at
116 ft. an abundant supply was found. The old well, although so close,
is said to be still as dry as a bone.

I wrote to Mr. Plater, enclosing the above report, and obtained
the following reply :—
Silver Birch, Aspley Heath, Woburn Sands, R.S.O.,
October 16th, 1899.
I return the press cutting which was enclosed with your letter to me of
the 9th inst. It is correct. In reply to your three questions :—
1. As stated in the newspaper cutting, an unsuccessful attempt was
made to a depth of. 166 ft., at which we had bored several feet into
Oxford clay.
2. No further useless wells or borings were made near the successful
well.
3. There is an ample supply of water obtained from the well sunk on
the spot indicated by Mr. Gataker.
I may state that my property at Aspley Heath, Bedfordshire, where the
wells were sunk in 1896, is about 500 ft. above sea level.
Mr. Gataker stated that water would be found on the spot indicated,
but not under 100 ft. from the surface.
Arthur C. Plater.
Mr. Holmes remarks : " The boring in Oxford clay was unsuccess
ful, and Mr. Gataker was successful. The interesting point is the
statement in the newspaper cutting that the useless well was only
39 ft. from the good one. Mr. Plater, however, does not seem to
confirm this statement.—T. V. H."
I wrote again to Mr. Plater with regard to this latter point and
also to inquire whether he was present when the dowser visited the
spot, and whether he could tell me the strata bored through in his
new well. Mr. Plater replies as follows :—
Silver Birch, Aspley Heath, Woburn Sands, R.S.O.,
December Uth, 1899.
In reply to your letter the distance between the two wells, about 39 ft.,
is quite correct. The new well is 116 ft. deep. I was present when Mr.
L. Gataker expressed his opinion that water would be found at a depth of
about 100 ft. I have lost my record of the strata through which we bored in the
old well, but to a depth of about 90 ft. sand, with occasional layers of iron
stone, formed the principal feature ; at about 130 ft. we bored through 6 ft.
of fuller's earth, and after more sand we bored into the clay several feet,
and then ceased work. I think the water in the new well is on a bed of
fuller's earth. The level of the mouth of the new well is about 14 ft. lower
than that of the old. The latter is now used as a rainwater tank.
Arthur C. Plater.
Though I am not a geologist, the explanation of this case appears
to me simple. The bed of fuller's earth found at a depth of 130 ft.
in the old well evidently forms the bottom of the new well, which is
186 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part
116 ft. deep and 14 ft. lower level = 130 ft. As fuller's earth (a
silicious clay) is a nearly impermeable water bed, when this was pierced,
as in the old well, the water would escape into the sand below the bed.
If the record of the old boring was shown to Mr Gataker, or known to
him, the explanation of his successful prediction is also easy ; though
I have no doubt it would be rejected by all concerned, as dowsers
trust more to themselves than to any information given them.
It will be seen from the notes which Mr. Holmes and Mr. Westlake
have so kindly added to many of these cases, that a geological explana
tion of why the dowser found water in the places he indicated is clear
enough. The important point is, would these places have been selected
by a shrewd observer, or even by a skilled geologist, before the dowser
had visited the spot? In some cases this might, as in No. 10, have
been so ; on the other hand a considerable body of evidence exists to
show that the dowser, though ignorant of geology and an entire
stranger to the locality, succeeded, where expert geological or engineer
ing advice, aided by careful local observation, completely failed.
Those who have taken the trouble to read the previous Report will
recall several cases of this kind, notably the Waterford case on
p. 106 et seq., the Horsham case, p. 117 et seq., the Uppingham case,
p. 127 et seq., Sir Welby Gregory's case, p. 96, etc.
Then again, if merely shrewd observation and considerable
experience as well-sinkers afford a sufficient explanation of the
dowser's success, how are we to explain the achievements of young
dowsers and other complete novices 1 Take the case of the French
charity boy Bleton recorded in Part X, p. 257, or, referring to the previous
Report, take the cases of the eleven-year-old Cornish lad given on
p. 36, Vol. XIII., or the young daughter of an estate agent given on
p. 33 et seq., or the daughter of an English clergyman on p. 38, or the
young son of another clergyman on p. 39, etc., etc. Then, too, we
have other amateur dowsers of all ages and in all ranks of life, whose
successes in the discovery of underground water certainly appear at
first sight to be greater than mere observation or good luck would
account for. Numerous instances of this were given in the previous
Report, and a few additional cases of successful amateur dowsers, such
as his Honour Sir Richard Harington, Bart., are quoted later on.
One of the four methods suggested by me to test the pretensions
of the dowser (see p. 251 of last Report) is "separate and entirely
independent examination of the same ground by different dowsers."
The evidence on behalf of this test I will now proceed to cite.

PART IV.
Experiments with Two or More Dowsers Independently Tried
on the Same Ground.
No. 1. The Cheltenham Experiments.
I am indebted to our fellow-worker, Lieut.-Colonel Le M. Taylor,
of Cheltenham, for the following interesting report of his own and
other experiments at Cheltenham. It appears that in 1896 the
Directors of the Cheltenham Steam Laundry, anxious to obtain a
supply of water for the laundry, at Colonel Taylor's suggestion and by
arrangement with him, employed two dowsers, independently of each
other, to locate the best site whereon to sink a well. Colonel Taylor
arranged first to take Mr. Tompkins to the laundry, and after he had
fixed on the place or places where water would be found, the laundry
directors were to employ a second dowser and the results were to be
compared. The following is an abridged account of the proceedings
given in a local newspaper : —
A "diviner" went over the ground a week or so ago in company with
several of the directors. He subsequently wrote a report which, according
to an arrangement unknown to the diviner himself, the directors sealed and
kept strictly secret. As business folk, the directors were not going to trust
to the decision of one expert, and, therefore, another was engaged to go
over the ground on Wednesday in company with other directors, who did
not know what the result of the former experiment was, in order that there
might be no unconscious collusion or "thought reading," Mr. Chesterman,
of Bath, the chief huntsman on this occasion, seemed to think that his task
was none too easy, as it is not always that a reliable supply of water can be
found in a small field of clay soil, such as that at the side of the laundry to
which his prospecting was restricted. Taking one of his small, slender
twigs, he held it in front of him with his arms lowered and one end of it in
each hand, so that the angle of the fork pointed very slightly downwards,
about three feet from the ground. Thus he commenced to walk slowly in a
straight line across the field. Suddenly the twig gave a turn in the
operator's hands, began to revolve, and continued to do so while he remained
within the area in which he experienced the "shock" of water. The two
directors attempted to stay the revolving motion of the twig while the
operator carried it over the affected area, but though each seized one end of
it, they could not do so, the ends of the twig, in fact, slightly lacerating their
fingers as it turned in resistance to all the pressure they could employ.
Similar results were obtained with the wire. Then Dr. Cardew walked across
the affected spot with the twig in his hands, but the simple apparatus remained
quite stationary until Mr. Chesterman placed his hands on the doctor's wrists,
when it began to revolve. —Cheltenham Echo, December 10th, 1896.

Professor W. F. Barrett.
How far the sites fixed on by the two dowsers coincided will be
seen from Colonel Taylor's report and drawings, which I now append.
LleUT.-COLONeL TayLor'S RePorT.
On December 8th, 1896, I was informed that Mr. Chesterman, of
Bath, had been engaged by the Directors of the Hatherley Laundry
to "douse" for water on their property, and that he was to arrive the
next day. I wrote him a note and asked him to call on me when he had
finished, which he kindly did. On his arrival I showed him my plan
of the laundry ground and asked him to point out where he had found
water. The dotted lines on the plan, Fig. 13, show the places indicated
by him, and these agree also with the information I subsequently got
from Mr. Wilkins, one of the directors, who accompanied Mr.
Chesterman during the experiment. Mr. Wilkins also told me that
Chesterman had found indications of water about the place I have
marked E, but as it was not a strong stream, no more was done about

it. Mr. Chesterman has been for years in the Indian D.P.W., and
therefore quite understands a plan. No one who was at the former
experiment at Hathcrley was present on December 9th, and Mr.
Wilkins did not open the envelope containing the record of what Mr.
Tompkins had done till the trial was over. Mr. Chesterman was not
told that another man had gone over the ground, though, as he told
me, he suspected it after he had completed his search from being asked
what he would say if another finder had indicated other places.
All parts of the field near the laundry seem equally open to their
choice, but it might be said that a desire to make things pleasant for
the Laundry Company may have influenced each of them to locate
water near the engine house, well knowing that water would most
likely be found everywhere.1
Previous to Mr. Chesterman's visit Mr. Tompkins had been to my
place to conduct the experiments on finding coins already sent you,2

Rough plan of Garden behind Colonel Taylor's house.
The continuous line indicates the stream found by Mr. Tompkins, November 23rd ;
the dotted line those found by Mr. Chesterman, December 9th.
1 Colonel Taylor sends a geological map of a section of the district, taken from
Murchison's Geology of Cheltenham. Sand occurs in patches up to SO feet in depth,
over the lias formation, which latter is probably some 300 or 400 feet thick at
Cheltenham ; shallow wells sunk in the sand would yield surface water, and wells
sunk 70 to 130 feet about Cheltenham frequently yield water, which, however, is more
or less saline. But the laundry experiment is, if anything, adverse to the dowser.
—W. F. B.
J These experiments will be given in a subsequent paper.—W. F. B.
190 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part
and I had also asked Mr. Tompkins to indicate any place in my garden
where underground water would be found. He traced the line
of an underground stream and I marked it with pegs (about four
inches long) driven in quite to their head; one spot g, Fig. 14, he
specially noted.
I told Mr. Chesterman about my experiments with Mr. Tompkins
and asked him if he would go into my garden and try to locate a
stream found by the latter. He kindly consented. It was quite dark
when we went out, but it made no difference ; in a short time he
found water at f, Fig. 14, and said the stream ran parallel to the road.
He then, passing up by the hedge, found the rod turn at the point g,
when he said he was crossing a stream. I put down my hand to mark
the place with a peg when it came into contact with the end of the peg
I had previously put in to mark the spot Tompkins had selected. It was
much too dark for either of us to see the pegs even if we had searched
for them. Chesterman then walked down the centre and afterwards
the inner edge of the tennis ground and crossed the stream at n and i
respectively. The dotted line on the plan of my garden will fairly re
present the flow of water underground as indicated by Mr. Chesterman.
How far, from these experiments, it may be considered that the
subterranean streams influenced these two men I cannot say ; I think,
however, something more than chance must have dictated their choice
of ground.
Mr. Tompkins follows his stream when he has once struck it, the
" wand " pointing the way when the stream takes a turn, and he
estimates the distance underground of the water and the yield by the
position assumed by the rod and his feelings generally.
When Mr. Chesterman discovers a stream he does not attempt to
follow it, but steps back, and then again approaching it at right angles
marks the spot where he first feels the indication of water. He then
goes some paces forward so as to cross the stream, turns round, and
again approaches it, marking the spot where the water is again first
felt. By dividing the distance between his two marks he gets a point
directly over the water, and by a scale, which he has worked out from
experience, he judges the distance below at which the water is flowing
by the distance between one of the points where he first feels the water
and the point immediately over it.
For example, when the horizontal distance is loft. the water will
be 20 ft. below, and when the distance on the ground is 5 ft. 3 in. the
stream should be 85 ft under the surface.1
1 Colonel Taylor here gives a plan of Chester-man's method, but it is hardly
necessary to reproduce it, as it is purely imaginary and exactly opposite to the
system described by Mr. Emerson in the American Journal of Science and followed
by some dowsers in England. —W.F.B.
xxxvni.] On the So-called Divining Rod. lQ|
Every dowser, however, uses the method which he feels answers
best ; a water-finder whom I saw at work two or three years ago found
the distance of the water underground by raising his rod above his
head and then lowering it slowly till he felt " first contact " of
influence and then he calculated by a scale he had made.
December 13th, 1896. Le M. Tayloe.
On inquiry I learn from Colonel Taylor that the directors of the
laundry have not sunk a well, after all, at the place indicated by the
dowsers, as they feared, Colonel Taylor says, " that the water, when got,
might turn out to be ' Monkey Brand.' "
No. 2. The Westbury-sub-Mendip Experiments.
Among the numerous letters and evidence of various kinds relating
to the divining rod, which Mr. Vaughan Jenkins (to whose painstaking
zeal this inquiry owes so much) has kindly sent me, there is a good
deal of correspondence relating to a dowser named Thomas Pavey, of
Cheddar. I will only refer to one case where the late Mr. Nalder, of
Westbury-sub-Mendip, Wells, Somersetshire, employed Pavey and
another dowser quite independently of each other to go over his
ground at different times. I condense what Mr. Nalder says in a
couple of letters to Mr. V. Jenkins written so far back as October and
November, 1882 :—
"I got the two men [Mr. Nalder writes] at a month's interval
apart—quite unknown to each other or of what the other had done—tc
test my field for water, and though there was nothing to guide them, the
rod moved within two yards of the same spot in each case ; moreover
they each traced the same direction as the line of the underground
watercourse. In other parts of the field the twig would not work (or
only very slightly), but it moved strongly where they asserted the
' spring ' existed. I had a well sunk at this place and came upon a
splendid water supply at 39 ft. Below the surface soil we passed
through a bed of gravel, 2 to 2J ft. deep, then came upon a very hard
dry substance called by the well sinker ' wark.' The water rose in the
well up to within 2 ft. of the top and remains so. The well-sinker
told me he had sunk five wells at different places where Mr. Pavey
found the twig moved strongly, and in each of the cases he had
found abundance of water."
In a subsequent letter Mr. Nalder writes :—
Westbury-sub-Mendip, Wells, Somerset, Noeember 21st, 1882.
I was at Cheddar this morning speaking to my butcher, Mr. John
Branch, and he reminded me of a circumstance I had quite forgotten. It
seems he came over to Westbury to see me shortly after Mr. Pavey had
192 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part
marked out the spot for my well, and as Mr. Branch said he could " work
the twig," he cut a forked twig from the hedge, and went to the same spot
marked out by Mr. Paeey, and of which there was not the least sign what
ever, as I had not begun the well. So this made three persons who had
found the spring by the twig. Frank j Naldkr
There was some correspondence on this case in the London Times
during October, 1882. The former owner of Mr. Nalder's place pooh-
poohed the thing and said the dowsers were only joking, to which
Mr. Nalder properly says : " If so, it was a capital joke for me."
No. 3. The Thomastown Experiments.
It has been already mentioned in the Carrigoona experiments that
a friend living near "Waterford, Mr. J. H. Jones, was an amateur
dowser. Mr. Jones tells me that, having seen Mullins locate the site
for a well in his neighbourhood, which turned out remarkably
successful, he was astonished to find the rod also moved in his own
hands and he writes to me as follows :—
Mullinabro, Waterford, Noeember 29th, 1897.
I began experimenting with the rod as a sceptic—and thoroughly
prejudiced against it, and thinking that its action in a diviner's hands was a
mere trick or sleight of hand —but I am now convinced that the thing is
genuine, and that the rod is moved in consequence of some action or
influence produced in persons susceptible when near or over subterranean
wator- J. H. Jones.
It will be remembered that Mr. Jones, in our Carrigoona experi
ments, independently pointed out the same places that Mr. Stone
indicated as water-bearing or waterless. Mr. Jones has had
several experiences of this kind, and a recent one is worth referring
to. Water was much needed for a new convent, in Thomastown, co.
Kilkenny, and, after some unsuccessful attempts to obtain a supply
had been made, an English dowser was sent for ; he pointed out a
certain region in the convent grounds where a supply of underground
water existed, estimating the depth at about 80 feet ; an unlikely
place it seemed, as the convent field was at some altitude. Mr. Jones
was asked to try his hand independently, knowing nothing of the place
pointed out by the English dowser and having nothing to guide
him. The result was that he fixed on the same place, and I learn
that any possible telepathic influence was also out of the question.
Accordingly a well six feet in diameter was sunk at the spot indicated
as best by both dowsers. After passing through a layer of surface
soil and rocky débris, the solid rock was encountered at the depth of
15 ft. from the surface, and (at a cost of several hundred pounds)
xxxviii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 193
the well was sunk in a hard micaceous quartzite. The Administrator
of the parish writes as follows to Mr. Jones :—
Thomastown, Co. Kilkenny, September 21st, 1899.
I am happy to say that we have got water on the exact spot pointed out
by you and Mr. Wills [the English dowser]. We are now 70 ft. deep, and
since we reached 60 ft. water has come—so far, however, in small quantities
insufficient for our needs ; we are therefore continuing the boring. The
well-sinkers declare they never encountered a harder stone. It is getting
soft at one side, and sand is coming up with the water, a good sign. All
the springs are very low now, and we expect a good increase of water during
the winter- John Roe, Adm.
P.S. —I should mention the water is increasing every day for the past week.
In reply to my inquiry the Rev. J. Roe writes :—
Thomastown, co. Kilkenny, December 8th, 1899.
In your letter of the 9th ult., you have asked me three questions : 1st,
"Is water difficult to find in Thomastown, etc.?" I may state that water
is not very difficult to find here, but as the convent is situated in a rather
elevated position, we anticipated considerable difficulty in finding water. The
site of the house is really charming, but the great drawback was water ; in
fact, some wise heads told us we should never get it. However, we were
determined to try our luck, and as the tradesmen were putting the finishing
touches on the building, we began sinking operations. The spot selected at
first was about 12 yds. from the kitchen door. The men worked on for about
15 ft. when we came upon the rock. We were very doubtful at first about
our success, and having come upon rock so soon we nearly lost courage, and
dreaded the great expense necessary even in trying to find it. I consulted
Mr. Hynes, architect, Cork, and he advised me to bring over Mr. Gataker or
his man. At first I laughed at the idea, and though I had heard and read a
little about the divining rod, I was most sceptical as to its results. After
some persuasion I communicated with Mr. Gataker and he sent over his
partner, Mr. Wills, at a cost of of £10. When he arrived he looked at the
site already selected, and after some evolutions of his rod said he should
abandon it, as there was only a very, very small ripple, and at great depth.
He then went through the whole field with his rod and marked out two or
three places where an abundant supply of water could be obtained, but
selected a rather elevated spot in preference to the others. He said we
would most certainly get water at about 80 ft. and so many gallons per hour.
By a most singular coincidence Mr. Jones came on the scene accompanied
by a mutual friend, Mr. O'Connell (engineer), Kilkenny, and this brings me
to your second question. We invited Mr. Jones to have a try with his rod,
and he pointed out the exact spot, and traced out the water in the same line
as Mr. Wills had done. They were quite independent of one another, and
Mr. Jones knew nothing about the coming of the English dowser, or what he
had already done. Mr. Jones could not tell the depth, nor the quantity,
etc., but he was certain there was a strong current of water. I noticed in
the operations when they came over the places where water could be found,
Mr. Wills' rod jumped up and Mr. Jones's down. f
o
194 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part
Third question. We have now gone down about 76 ft. and the men have
ceased to sink any deeper, as we consider we have got a sufficient supply
of water for the convent. To-day the pumping apparatus, etc., has arrived
from some English firm, and I expect it will be in working order by the
first of next month. I need not tell you how difficult it was to bore through
the rock and how expensive it has been upon us. The architect was anxious
that we should go deeper, but the men found it very difficult to carry on the
blasting operations, because of the constant flow of water. I must ask you
to excuse me for the long delay in writing this, but I have been very busy.
I may add that I am uow convinced that the divining rod is no sham,
but genuine, and I cannot explain its influence on some susceptible people
when they come over or near water. Jqw Roe, Adm
In a concluding letter, Father Roe, in reply to my question why he
did not in the first instance consult a geologist, writes as follows .—
Thomastown, co. Kilkenny, December 11th, 1899.
It would have been wiser to have consulted a geologist before begin
ning the sinking operations, but I was obliged to act very economically.
I did not mean by "boring " a small borehole, for the well is 6 ft. in
diameter at least from top to bottom ; I only used the word as a pumping
phrase. I did not intend that my letters should be published, as they are
not very fit, but if you think they can be of any service to you in your
valuable researches, you have my permission to use them.

No. 4. The Claverton Manor Experiments.
In the previous Report (p. 95) a case is quoted from the Pro
ceedings of the Bath Field Club where two dowsers independently fixed
on the same spots in an estate belonging to the Deputy-Lieutenant
of Gloucestershire, Mr. H. D. Shrine, J.P. As one of these dowsers was
an amateur, and an Archdeacon, the case is above all suspicion of
collusion, and through the kindness of Mr. Vaughan Jenkins I
obtained the following fuller account of the experiment contained in a
letter written to Mr. V. Jenkins by Mr. Shrine, who was an eye
witness. The date is somewhat remote, but the facts are not disputed.
Claverton Manor, near Bath, December 20th, 1882.
In reply to your questions relating to my experience of the use of the
divining rod for the discovery of water, the facts are these :—About twenty
years ago, intending to build a cottage residence on the top of Warleigh Hill,
adjoining the hamlet of Conkwell, I employed a man named John Mullins, a
reputed spring-finder and well-sinker living at Coleme, Wilts., to find water,
which he did by means of a forked twig of hazel or thorn. He was, so far as
I know, an entire stranger to the place, and could not have known anything
about the springs. I took him to the top of the wood in a flat field, the
subsoil of which for a great depth was known to be oolite rock. He pointed
xxxviii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 195
out by means of his forked twig where water was, in his opinion, to be found
under the surface, but at what depth he did not pretend to say. In every
instance where he said he found water, there was to my knowledge a
spring low down in the wood in a line with the spot indicated.
He afterwards made some attempts to find water on the lawn in the
front of the house, and traced a spring upward to a spot on the grass plot in
front of the greenhouse where, some years before, in moving a large arbutus
tree we had found a spring of water. To test the man's water-finding
powers more closely, before I allowed him to sink the well, I invited my
friend and neighbour Mr. Earle—late Rector of Monkton Farleigh, and now
Archdeacon of Totnes, who had the gift himself, and who had found several
wells by this process—to meet Mullins in the field near Conkwell. He did
so, and though unaware of what places Mullins had selected, they both
agreed in a very remarkable manner in the spots where the hidden springs
were ; the forked twig turned with him at the same places as with Mullins.
On this conjunction of their discoveries I decided to sink a well, and at a
little over 80 ft. deep we came to a bed of yellow clay and found water. The
bed was, however, too thin, and the men sank the well to over 100 ft. deep,
when they came to a blue marl or lias, and we have a fair supply of water
about 4 ft. deep.
Since then and quite recently Mullins has found for me several springs
in Claverton and sunk two wells, in one of which the water was found not
more than 6 ft. below the surface, where we had no idea there was any. In
each instance of his finding by the twig a spring on the hill, he traced it
down to an existing spring unknown previously to myself. He also found
for us the course of several drains, the lines of which had been forgotten by
the workpeople, and in every case was right and saved us much trouble in
digging.
It certainly appears to me that Mullins is himself a believer in the
divining rod, and if it is a mere trick or deception, it is strange that he
could not communicate it to his own son who works with him. The twig on
the approach to a spring curved upwards in his hands without the least
appearance of action on his part.
Henry D. Shrine.
No. 5. The Pontyberim Experiments.
Another case where two dowsers, in this case both were amateurs,
independently fixed on the same spot is given me by Mr. J. F. Young,
of Llanelly. A friend of Mr. Young, a contractor, was building some
cottages at Pontyberim, a mining village noted for its anthracite coal,
eight miles from Llanelly. Wishing to select a site for a well, the
contractor asked Mr. Young (who is well known in the locality as an
amateur dowser) to come over and fix the best spot. Mr. Young tells
me he had never been to the place before, and on arrival, after casting
about with his twig, he fixed on a certain line along which he asserted
underground water would be found. Having done this, he begged
the contractor, Mr. Williams, to try the rod himself. This he did, and
f
q 2
196 Professor W. F. Barrett. [pakt
to his surprise Mr. Williams found the rod moved vigorously, and
apparently spontaneously at the same place found by Mr. Young.
Then Mr. Young went out of sight of Mr. Williams, and having traced
the course of the water-bearing fissure, as Mr. Young believed it to
be, he returned and asked Mr. Williams to do the same. Aware of
the influence of unconscious guidance by hand or look, Mr. Young
informs me that he took special care to avoid this, and kept out of
sight whilst Mr. Williams tried. On subsequently comparing notes,
the same line was found to have been traced by both. Mr. Williams'
sister, Mrs. Rees, to whom the cottages belong, was present, and adds
her testimony. I have received independent reports from both Mr.
Young and Mr. Williams. Here is the account given by the latter ;
after relating what I have stated above, Mr. Williams says :—
Pontyberim, October 20th, 1899.
Mr. Young then asked me to stop where I was, while he went to the side
of the building in order to trace the course of the undergr6und water. In a
short time he returned and begged me to try if I could find it. I did so, and
had not gone far before the curious "electrified" sensation again returned,
and the action of the twig could be seen moving over a certain spot, which
proved to be the same as that located by Mr. Young.
But still I was in doubt as to the probability of the existence of water
there until a couple months after that, and in the worst of the last dry
season, I resolved to put it to the test, and commenced sinking a well at that
spot. On reaching a depth of 14ft. from the surface, I had the gratification
of striking on a strong spring of clear and beautiful water, rising since to 6ft.
and 6ft. in the well and so it now continues, a result of much importance to
my sister, Mrs. Rees. JoHN WnjJamS.
I have read the above account of the finding of the spring on my
premises, and the account is true in every particular. Martha Rees
No. 6. The Mayfield Ex]ieriments.
I am indebted to Dr. Leadam for kindly sending me the following
detailed account, accompanied with a map, of his experiments with
two dowsers, whom he tested, independently of each other, on his
estate in Sussex. Mayfield and Stone Mill are both on the " Hastings
Beds," a series of sands and sandstones alternating with clays ; see
Topley's memoir on the Geology of (he Weald.
167, Gloucester Terrace, Hyde Park, W. , Decendier 7th, 1899.
I have a small property near Mayfield, in Sussex, a hilly district
principally soft sandstone formation with hard sandstone strata, as at Tun-
bridge Wells.
In 1895, as I wanted a further water supply, I sent for Mr. Gataker ;
he stated he had never been in the place before, and I accompanied him
xxxviii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 1&7
throughout the experiment. As my primary object was to have an in
creased convenient supply for the farm buildings adjoining Stone Mill, I took
him over there, and he soon marked a spot, C, as promising a good supply
at 70 ft. depth. He then indicated spots D and E, giving from 50 to 70 ft.
as the probable depth ; a smaller but satisfactory supply at F, but, as
he remarked, it was altogether out of the way of the farm.
As I also wanted a supply for the small house at the Stock-yards, I then
took him round there, and he pitched upon A as a spot for a good supply at
80 ft. I then told him that I believed there must be water somewhere near
the surface, as an underground dairy could not be kept satisfactorily dry, so
he walked round the house, and outside the garden gate, about 30 yds. from
the house, he marked a place, B, where he said we should find a sufficient
supply for that small house at 12 ft. from the surface. I may say that the
pond drawn near there is a surface pond and nearly dry in summer.
I determined to try first at B, and set an ordinary well sinker to dig a
well ; exactly at 12 ft. he came upon water in a stratum of blue marl.
I had this dug down to 20 ft., brought the pipe for a house pump into
it, and it has been in constant use ever since, and stood steadily at about
12 ft. from the surface during the late dry summer ; though neighbours were
allowed to use the well, the water did not sink more than 1 or 1J ft.
Being well satisfied with this, I then set the same meu to dig a well
at E, and, after digging through varying strata, the man below, whilst
digging in rather firm rock at 61 ft., suddenly called out to be hauled
up as the water rushed up in volume at his feet. This flow was estimated
at 300 gallons per hour, but there is a stratum of broken rock and rubbish
about 1^ ft. above, through which the water flows away ; for that reason and
its distance from the house, and a suspicion that the broken stratum in
some way rendered the water unsatisfactory, I have not taken it into use,
and my farm people have continued till now to supply themselves from the
small stream shown in the map.
Having determined this summer that I would dig or bore somewhere
nearer the farmhouse, I thought, before doing so, that I would have another
diviner over to see, as a matter of interest, to what extent his opinions
agreed with Mr. Gataker's. You were kind enough, in answer to my
inquiry, to recommend Mr. Stone, and he came in August. He also had
never been in the place before, and 1 met him on arrival and accompanied
him round.
I took him first to the field near some ponds on the map ; the ponds
were certainly hidden by trees, and are in a dip in the ground so that Mr.
Stone could not have noticed them. He marked a spot at G, then at H,
and traced that flow back towards G, all at about 70 ft. depth. Also at I,
and at K, and at L, a large flow, "bubbling up," as he expressed it, at about
50 ft. depth, and flowing in both directions from there. L is about the
highest point in the field (A having been an ordnance survey station).
He then marked M exactly where Mr. Gataker had marked C four years
before, and N, O and P, which he considered one stream at about 60 or
70 ft. depth or rather less, and when I afterwards told him of Mr. Gataker's
markings ho said he thought his own places better, and that they were
branches of the same supply. Similarly he marked Q and II, which appeared
198 [part
Professor W. F. Barrett.
to be the stream which Gataker had marked at F on its way to the meadow
at the bottom, and I was already aware that somewhere about there a good
supply was coming down to the stream and percolating into it.
Mr. Stone recommended boring at P, and I accordingly allowed him to
send his foreman and boring tools to do it. They went through 5 or 6 ft. of
mould, then about 30 ft. of sand rock, unfortunately a very hard seam, then
about 3 ft. of blue clay. At 42 ft. 6 in. they again got into sand rock, and in
that at 47 ft. reached water, which rose about 6 in. up the bore hole. It
remains at about that level and is estimated at 200 gallons per hour, but I
have not yet got a pump fitted. Before writing to me Mr. Stone advised
that the boring should be carried deeper (I think there was no justification

for this, as I considered it simple speculation and stopped it), his view bting
that by going deeper we should strike a stronger spring and perhaps have
the water fill the bore hole to the surface. The boring showed that the
water-bearing rock (or sandstone) reached to 58 ft. 6 in., then blue clay to
61 ft., rock to 65 ft., and blue clay again to 69 ft. We therefore have, in my
opinion, run a great risk of losing the water altogether. The layer of clay
from 40 ft. to 42 ft. 6 in. was peculiar, almost black, and I am sending you
by parcel post a sample of it, and if there is any peculiarity about it, I should
like to know.
I will report later to you the working of the supply when it is fixed.
W. W, Leadam.

P.S.—With two streams of water on the map you may perhaps wonder at
the need for boring, so I must explain that in the summer time the mill
stream is so small that it takes three days to refill the millponds after use,
and the water is very irony. The other stream is only just enough in
summer to supply my house by a hydraulic ram. It is good water, and
appears in summer entirely supplied by percolation from the water stratum
indicated by the diviner at P, Q and R.
The foregoing case is instructive, not from the coincidence of the
spots C and M chosen by Gataker and Stone independently, a coinci
dence that was possibly accidental, but from the illustration it affords
of the dowser's notion of underground water. With the utmost
assurance, wherever he goes (if his rod turns) he proceeds to trace out
narrow streams of water flowing underground, just as streams flow on
the surface. Now in the foregoing case the geology of the district is
perfectly well known and underground streams, such as are imagined
by the dowser, are out of the question.
Mr. Holmes makes the following remarks on the foregoing case :—
Maytield and Stone Mill are not on the same subdivision of the Hastings
Beds, but they agree in being both on sandy, not clayey beds. Topley gives
the details of a quarry showing 36 ft. of stone "at the curve of the main
road half a mile West of Mayfield." (p. 77.) He also mentions some fine
natural exposures of sandstone rocks (between Mayfield and Stone Mill) as
" continued down the valley towards Stone Mill." Thus the dowser there
abouts would have not only the evidence of hard rock interbedded with clay
or other soft stuff, deducible from the contours of the ground, but the
actual sight of the sandstone. I note that Dr. Leadam told the dowser
that there must be water somewhere near the surface (par. 3), as an under
ground dairy could not be kept dry, near B, and that then the dowser
decided that there was water, at B, 12 ft. from the surface—a very simple
deduction therefrom.
Granting the dowser's honest faith in himself and his rod, it is easy to
understand how he might say to himself when in a farm yard, or other
enclosure near a house,—" That would be a convenient spot for a pump or
well, if there is a stream of water there." Any other dowser would probably
take the same view and hence both would try that spot in the first place and
give it an unconscious preference. T V H
Other cases of two or more dowsers tried on the same ground
independently of each other are given both in the present Report (see,
e.g., p. 203) ; and in the previous Report eight or nine such cases were
referred to and some particulars given, see Vol. XIII., pp. 32, 40,
47, 70, 81, 89, 95, and 210. All of these were successful, but in
many of these cases the exact conditions of the test or of the ground
are insufficiently described. There is, therefore, a considerable body
of evidence of a certain value, but of what value it is hard to say,
existing upon this instructive point.

PART V.
Experiments in Blindfolding the Dowser.
In the previous Report, pages 175 and 205, I described some
experiments made by myself on carefully blindfolding two dowsers and
noting whether they were able, by the movement of the rod, to indicate
the same spots when blindfolded as when not blindfolded. If there be,
as all dowsers and most of their supporters believe, a subtle influence
exerted by underground running water upon the dowser, then blind
folding should make no difference. The same remark applies if the
dowser be psychically sensitive, possessing, e.g., some kind of clair
voyance, —provided always the dowser is at his ease, i.e., if he joins
heartily in the experiment.
In all experimental work it is essential for success that the
instruments you employ are suitable for the purpose in view and
also in good order. Having selected the proper instruments, the
mental atmosphere in physical experiments does not affect the results,
as we are dealing with non-living matter, but the physical conditions are
all important. In experiments with living beings, the physical surround
ings (except in so far as they produce discomfort) are unimportant, but,
as we are now dealing with living instruments, our experiments are
sure to fail or be inconclusive if the instrumental appliances we have to
employ are out of order ; and they are very apt to be deranged by a
sudden change in the psychical conditions. Modern physical and
chemical research has taught us the profound influence exerted by an
imperceptible difference in the materials we are dealing with ; the
tendency of all psychical research is to reveal that an influence quite
as profound is exerted by an imperceptible difference in the mental
apparatus we employ. Though this may seem quite reasonable and
obvious to most of us, it has taken physicists 200 years to learn the
former truth, and we should not therefore be surprised if those to
whom psychical research is new overlook, or even ridicule, the latter.
It may be remembered that some years ago Professor Ray
Lankester, F.R.S., published an account of some experiments he
had made in blindfolding a dowser, a lad named Rodwell, and a
good deal of public interest was excited by what Professor Lankester
and many others considered to be his complete exposure of the
trickery of dowsers in general and of this lad in particular. Now,
whilst I have no wish to be an apologist for this dowser, as similar
experiments which I made with him (p. 205 of the last Report) were
inconclusive, and in one instance adverse, yet it must be remembered
xxxviii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 201
that Professor Ray Lankester, though a distinguished naturalist, is not
an equally distinguished experimentalist. His scepticism regarding
phenomena that do not lie within the range of his experience might
almost be termed ferocious, and, on the occasion referred to, it can
hardly be said he dealt with the living instrument—the dowser—
as gently as he would have dealt with his microscope. Upon this
point I may perhaps quote a sentence from a letter which I received
some time ago from Mr. T. V. Holmes, F.G.S., who is quite as keen a
critic as Professor Lankester, but somewhat better informed in all that
relates to the subject of the present research. Mr. Holmes writes :—
With regard to the experiments of Professor Ray Lankester on the
alleged power of Rodwell, I am very decidedly of opinion that no result
of any value could be obtained unless the boy was quite at his ease, and that
he would require much more tact and geniality to put him at his ease than
a mau would. Now the impostor, or semi-impostor, shows his hand to the
genial man, and is rigidly on his guard in the presence of the ungenial, as
though "sweetness and light" never co-existed in the same person.
This is a sagacious observation, and bears out what I have already
said with regard to those who are engaged in any experimental work
connected with our Society.
No. 1. Experiments by the Author.
Returning to my own experiments, described in the previous
Report, those narrated on p. 175 were made at Kingstown with
Mr. Stears, who readily consented to be blindfolded, but who only
approximately fixed on the same spots when he could not see as when
he could see. The other experiments were made at Wimbledon (p. 205)
with the lad Rodwell, who strongly objected to be blindfolded, for the
reasons there given, but who at last consented : in two experiments
he was completely wrong and in a third he was fairly correct. It may
be urged that, Rodwell being blindfolded against his will, the experi
ment was not a fair one, as he was not at his ease ; this I quite admit.
Hence I can only regret that, taken as a whole, my own experiments
were, as I have said, inconclusive.
No. 2. Mr. Pease's Experiments.
Mr. E. R. Pease made two experiments with a blindfolded
dowser, which are described in his report on the divining rod, published
in Vol. II. of our Proceedings, p. 85. These, like my own experiments,
were inconclusive, and even had the dowser been successful, the result
would have been of little value, as it is stated the dowser was " led
over the same ground " in both cases. Unconscious muscular suggestion
might well have vitiated the experiment.
202 Professor W. F. Barrett. [pakt
No. 3. Experiments by Lord Winchilsea and others.
But there is a good deal of evidence by other experimenters on
the blindfolding of dowsers. Eight cases in addition to my own
experiments were given in the previous Report. Some of these are
with amateur dowsers, as Mr. Golding, of Booking, Essex, p. 28 (in all
cases pages refer to the previous Report, Proceedings S.P.R., Vol.
XIII.) ; and Colonel Aldworth, D.L., of co. Cork (p. 31), and also
a young farmer he mentions ; another case is given on p. 40. A
careful experiment made by Mr. J. E. Marshall, of Leeds, with the
dowser Adams, is described on p. 48 ; an experiment with Lawrence,
on p. 70 : and with the late J. Mullins, on p. 95 ; an experiment made
by Sir Welby Gregory, also on Mullins, on p. 97 ; and one by the late
Earl of Winchilsea (then the Hon. Finch Hatton, M.P.) also on
Mullins (same page). Here Earl Winchilsea states :—
Mullins was then blindfolded, and though led round by a different route,
again fixed on the same spot. At first he overran it a foot or so and then
felt round, as it were, and seemed to be led back into the exact centre of
influence by the twig.
This experiment is more fully described in Proceedings S. P. R.,
Vol. II., p. 102. In this case it was the discovery of a pipe of running
water, but the success of the dowser may have been due to involuntary
muscular suggestion, as Mr. Finch Hatton states he " led " the dowser.
The same explanation may also account for the success that is asserted
in several of the other cases mentioned in the previous Report, though
unfortunately the particulars respecting them are too meagre to be of
much value, except perhaps in the case given by Mr. Marshall.
I will now quote some further cases of blindfolding which have
since reached me. The first of these is a very interesting case, and
here again J. Mullins is the dowser. The introductory part of this
case is also of interest, and might have been added to the cases given
in Part III.
No. 4. Mr. Hoskyns' Experiments.
In the Somerset and Dorset Notes and Queries for June, 1897,
the Editor publishes a letter from a Mr. H. W. Hoskyns, written to
him on January 2nd, 1889. Mr. Hoskyns, whose letter, together
with information he has subsequently sent me, I abridge, says :—
Having an impure supply of water on his estate, North Perrott
Manor, Crewkeme, Somersetshire, he sent for the late John Mullins, the
well-known dowser, who, by means of tho rod, fixed upon the best site for
sinking a well, estimating the water to be about 25 ft. below the surface.
The well was sunk, solid rock was soon encountered, and after 25 ft. below
the surface had been reached, and a considerable thickness of rock pierced,
still no water was found. Suddenly, however, when 25$ ft. had been
xxxviii.] On the So-called Divining Bod. 203
reached, an inrush of water took place, so rapid that the men had to be
hurriedly withdrawn from the well, and the water rose 23J ft., or 2 ft. from
the surface, and has given a constant supply ever since, even in the driest
summers. An old well near contained water that was so polluted that it
could not be used, though the well had been cleaned out severW times.
The spring found by Mullins has given a constant supply of pure water.
Not far off, Mullins indicated the site of a second well, which proved
equally successful. Mr. Hoskyns adds that one of his labourers found he
also had the power of using the rod, a fact corroborated by the Editor, the
Rev. C. H. Mayo, M.A., who visited the spot.1
There is an interesting sequel to this. In consequence of Mr. A.
Lang's notes on my previous Report, in Longman's Magazine, Mr.
Hoskyns wrote to Mr. Lang upon the subject, and the latter forwarded
me the letter. Mr. Hoskyns writes :—
North Perrott Manor, Crewkerne, December, 1897.
With regard to the tests suggested by Professor Barrett in order to
ascertain the reality of a dowsing faculty,2 the following appears to satisfy
Nos. 1 and 2, i.e., separate examinations by different dowsers independently
of each other, and blindfolding the dowser. Mullins having on his visit here,
in 1888, given several (half-a-dozen or so) indications of water in the lane by
the two cottages, I had pegs put in on the strip of grass land opposite these
indications, and thrust in very low, so as only just to be seen when looked
for, and not showing above the grass, so that the cottage children should not
pull them up or displace them. Some rather long time after, when I had
made up my mind to go to the further expense of making a draw-well (not
a deep one) for the cottages, having meanwhile heard that a labourer on my
estate, one George Elson, had the dowsing power, I went with him myself,
had him bandaged tujhtty and deeply, well oeer the noxe, and in addition made
a steady man keep his hands over the bandago, whilst Elson walked down
the lane in question, holding the twig. At each halt that he made, the twig
turning downwards for water, I looked for Mullins' peg, but the grass had
grown over them and they were all quite undiscernible. So I made Elson
and his guide (for being completely blinded, he stumbled occasionally)
scrape a mark on the road surface with their boots. When we had come to
the end of the lane, I returned with these men and one or two others
1 My best thanks are due to Mr. Hoskyns for giving every facility to Mr.
Westlake, F.G.S., who, at my request, kindly visited the spot and made a careful
geological examination and report on this case. Mr. Westlake reports that the old
foul well was probably between 20 and 30ft. deep. Mullins' well, about 18 yds. distant,
is sunk in the Inferior Oolite, and at a depth of 25J ft. water rushed rapidly in
through a joint in the rock. This well gives a splendid pure supply, even when the
river is nearly dry ; the water is probably dammed up by a downthrow of Fuller's-
earth, which passes close to the farm. The second well indicated by Mullins is
50 yards further west, is only 18 ft. deep, and does not give so continuous a supply.
All three wells are at nearly the same surface level.—W. F. B.
! See p. 251 of the previous Report.
204 [PAHT

(Elson being then unblinded) and we all made close search for the Mullins'
pegs, eeery one of which, without exception, proved to be immediately opposite
one of Elson's boot-marks on the road. This uneducated labourer could
have had no geological, or even rule-of-thumb, knowledge of water-bearing
strata, for the place was quite strange to him.
The only objection, so far as I can see, that can be raised to this
extremely interesting test is that the guide, who kept his hand on
the bandage over the labourer's eyes, might have known where the
pegs were placed, and unconsciously tended to arrest the dowser at
the right spots, in fact, a case of " muscle-reading," as in the so-called
willing-game. This is likely enough if the pegs were discernible, but
Mr. Hoskyns distinctly says they were not, and as some time had
elapsed since Mullins visited the place, no one seems to have remem
bered the exact spots where the pegs had been put. I have had some
correspondence with Mr. Hoskyns about this interesting experiment.
He informs me that Elson's guide knew nothing whatever about
Mullins' pegs ; involuntary guidance is therefore excluded.
No 5. Mr. Westlake's Experiments.
I asked Mr. Westlake, who was living near Crewkerne, to repeat^
with Mr. Hoskyns' permission, the blindfolding experiment with Elson.
Mr. Westlake reports :—
On April 24th, 1900, I went with Mr. Hoskyns and his agent, Mr. Slade,
to Pipplepen farm. I walked down the same lane with Elson to a little stream
at the bottom, a distance of 1,050 ft., in the course of which his twig turned
seven times. I then carefully blindfolded him, and on retracing our steps,
the twig turned ten times, five of which corresponded nearly or quite with
his first marks, as under :—

Elson was not held, and was only told (to prevent accidents) to keep to
the right or the left. The results may have been somewhat impaired, first,
by the steward, Mr. Slade, who accompanied us, having touched Elson with
a stick (with a view to guiding him straight) at the points 1 and 5, imme
diately after which the twig turned ; and, second, there was more or less
conversation, at Nos. 8, 9, and 10, Slade informing Elson that he had
passed the cottages (a landmark between 7 and 8), that the point 8 he had
just indicated was the well (by the roadside), and so on.
In view of such sources of error, I think Mr. Hoskyns' experiment much
better than mine, but, as I understand that some of those who took part in
it had seen Mullins' pegs when they were put in, one cannot feel certain
that the experiment was an absolutely conclusive one.
In the afternoon, I made a further trial with Elson in an orchard at North
Perrott, where he had previously indicated two springs. Slade remained at
a distance. Elson having found the points, I blindfolded him and, starting
him from a little distance and directing him by voice, I got him to cross his
marks. He thereupon re-found the spots three times, his marks at one of
them being only a yard apart. It is possible he may have been able to
reckon the distance ; and I noticed also towards the end of the experiment
that the bandage had slipped a little, and I could see the upper corner of
his left eye, so that he may have been guided by the trees. Thus the result
was probably inconclusive.
Elson's hands and arms are very muscular ; he uses stout hazel forks and
grips them very hard, and they turn downwards with corresponding strength,
usually breaking, sometimes at the fork, but generally on one side ; he then
takes a fresh grip nearer the fork, and so on, till the stick may be used up to
within an inch or so of the fork. When it turned over the stream his forearm
muscles were strongly contracted. He says it usually makes his left thumb
numb, and that he feels the effects in his biceps the day after. Mr. Slade
said Elson had found water for many of the neighbours, and had never had
a failure. The farmer also told me Elson had predicted water at another
point half a mile to the east at 30 ft., and that it was found at 27 ft., and
rose to within 5 or 6 ft. of the surface. —E. W.
No. 6. Mr. Denison's Experiments.
For the next very interesting letter I am indebted to my
friend, Mr. B. St. G. Lefroy, who informed me that a Canadian
scientific friend of his—Mr. Denison, of the Toronto Meteorological
Observatory—had been making some experiments in blindfolding
an amateur dowser. At my request Mr. Denison kindly sent the
following account :—
Denison Square, Toronto.
With regard to the experiments with the "divining rod," I made a full
note of them at the time and copy the following from my note-book :—June
19th, 1898. Rode over to Mr. Harris' residence at Clarkson, 18 miles west
of Toronto. At dinner Mr. H. told the following story. "Last year my
well near the house became dry, I sent for a well-digger to increase depth.
206 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part
Before doing so he asked permission to explore with a hazel wand to
ascertain if another spring would be found deeper before going to expense
of digging. He said he had discovered a stream which would flow into the
well from west to east, a few feet below present level. The well was then
deepened, and, when down 3 ft., water did flow in from the west, so rapidly
it was difficult to pump fast enough to enable men to lay the bricks. Ever
since there has been a good supply of fine water. It was at this time I found
the hazel wand would turn in my hands also. The stick was Y-shaped, and
held firmly by both hands with thumbs turned outwards."
After dinner I got Mr. Harris to cut a forked plum stick about 20 in.
long—he had used a hazel before and felt sure plum would not work ; how-
aver he grasped the plum switch firmly, as explained, holding it vertically
before him. As he approached the well, the stick began to turn down in jerks
until when over the stream to west of the well the rod turned so much that
the bark was twisted near his hands. Mr. Harris is a powerful man and
endeavoured to hold the rod in its original position. I then got him to
explore other parts of the lawn and at 100 ft. from latter the rod again
turned down. I then blindfolded him and allowed a sceptic in the party to
turn him round about several times and then lead him in different directions;
but when he came over the first and second spots, where the rod turned
before, it again twisted down. He was once more turned about and asked
to walk as requested not in contact with any one, but the same results
occurred. He then tried an ordinary willow, and also a lilac
twig, with good f] results. When a dry stick was used
he obtained no I I action. Finally, I bent |) a galvanised
wire thus :— J \^ When Mr. Harris held W this like the
twig, it not only moved downwards ^n^ but twisted
round to such an extent as to form a loop thus :— ^*~ which assumed
its natural shape as he moved away from stream.
I also got him to follow a stream for several hundred feet. Mrs. Harris
tried without any result, but when Mr. H. grasped her wrists as she
approached the spring, the rod turned forcibly. One daughter, aged 15, had
also the power. When Mr. H. held the rod and Miss H. grasped his wrists,
there would be a momentary increase in the vigour of the rod twisting, and
when the daughter held the rod and her father grasped her wrists, a similar
action occurred.
Out of the twelve persons who tried the above experiments, two had the
power well developed, two slightly, while the remaining eight almost nil.
When the weaker members used a rod over 4 ft. long, their slight muscular
action was clearly shown by the far end of rod turning down. When
Mr. H. held the rod exactly perpendicularly, it sometimes turned inwards
until it pressed heavily against his chest. At the end of the experiments
Mr. Harris' hands were considerably blistered.
I will try to follow up these experiments. P iff T)
It is to be hoped that Mr. Denison will do so, as the letter shows
him to be a very careful observer, and I am greatly obliged to him for
the trouble he has taken in the matter. It will be observed that
xxxviii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 207
Mr. Denison distinctly states that in his second experiment the blind
folded dowser was not in contact with any one, and yet was equally
successful. This is therefore an important and excellent experiment,
and more evidence of this kind is much to be desired.
In these experiments with about 2 in 12 persons, or say 16 per
cent., the divining rod "worked," i.e., the forked twig suddenly revolved
independently of volition of the holder. I should say this is not an im
probable percentage, although in 1810, Professor Sementini (the Regius
professor of chemistry in the University of Naples)—in an essay he
published entitled, Pensieri e Sperimenti sulla Bacchetta Divinitoria,
asserts that with five out of six persons on the average he found the
"rod" would move, that is over 80 per cent. This large percentage
was doubtless due to the position of unstable equilibrium in which the
rod was held, though it is possible this class of automatic action may
be more common in some countries than others. Another savant,
Amoretti (see p. 246), who had a wide experience, states that
he found about 20 per cent, of those he tried were susceptible ;
this fairly agrees with my own estimate above. If any of my
readers who are interested in the subject will try, and get their
friends to try, the " rod," or auloscope, as I have suggested it should
be called, and let me know with what success, I should be grateful.
The method of holding the rod is fully described in Appendix C to
the last Report.
It will be noticed that Mr. Denison says a dry stick would not
work, but any forked green twig would do and also wire. This is the
experience of many others who can use the rod and who usually
attribute it to the dry stick being a non-conductor of electricity ; it is
very improbable that electricity has anything to do with the matter ;
the reason is doubtless that the green twig is more supple and elastic,
for whalebone is used by some dowsers in preference to a twig.
No. 7.—Dr. ThouveneVs Experiments.
The next evidence is a remarkable statement made a century ago
by a distinguished and learned French physician—Dr. Thouvenel.
This statement refers to the young French dowser, Bleton ; the
evidence relating to Bleton's powers as a water-finder is given in con
siderable detail subsequently, pp. 257 et seq. Here I need only say that
Dr. Thouvenel, having heard of Bleton's alleged powers, determined
to test them thoroughly from a scientific standpoint. He did so,
and published the results in a work called Me'moire physique et
medicinal, montrant des rapports entre les phe'nomenes de la baguette
divinatoire, du Magnetisme et de VElectricild. Paris, 1781. A second
memoir was published later, and though his theory of the divining
208 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part
rod was, I believe, mistaken, that does not affect the evidence I will
now cite. On pp. 77-80 of his first me'moire Thouvenel gives a
summary of the tests he made with Bleton in Lorraine. The follow
ing is a translation of the passage :—
I took the precaution to repeat several times all the experiments just
described in detail, after having carefully blindfolded Bleton ; in addition
his arms were sometimes fastened behind his back leaving his forearms only
just sufficiently free to hold the baguette at the extremity of his fingers,
sometimes even confining these in order to hinder, if possible, all mechanical
movement. These precautions were not taken for my own satisfaction, as I
was already entirely convinced.
I conducted Bleton to places which he had never seen ; I took him
towards springs of which I knew, but which he could not know of, at other
times over ground where neither of us knew what might be found.
Whenever he experienced his peculiar sensations—and the baguette had
repeatedly turned at the same spot, —I then led him far away, bringing him
back by quite different roads, still with his eyes bandaged. . . . When
he had followed the course of an underground spring—sometimes for more
than a quarter of a mile, across mountains, rock, or forests, and indicated
on the way numerous sub-divisions of the same spring—I made him return.
He then re-conducted me himself, though still blindfolded, only supported by
one arm, to the point from which we set out, without straying a single step
from the line previously traced and marked by pegs, which were often hidden
beneath the surface. He re-found all the subterranean rivulets already
pointed out, and followed exactly the sinuosities of the underground stream.
It frequently happened that we came across springs whose course was
interrupted by walls, terraces, or wide ditches, so that in order to enable
Bleton to overcome these obstacles, I had to procure ladders, or take long
detours, or in some way get him conveyed across ; nevertheless, although
blindfolded, he soon regained the course without the aid of his eyes.
Sometimes in order to try and deceive him, if his senses were concerned,
I placed false marks as if to indicate a spring ; sometimes after he had
followed a spring across several fields, I moved the pegs some feet away
without his knowledge. Nevertheless, he was never led astray and always
rectified such errors. In fine I tried all sorts of ways to deceive him, and I
can testify that in more thun six hundred trials, I did not succeed in doing
so one single time.
M. Jadelot, the Professor of Medicine in Nancy, Thouvenel states,
was a witness of, and co-operated in, all his experiments, which
extended over a space of two months, and was no less struck than
he was with the strength and importance of the evidence obtained.
In addition to the foregoing we have successful blindfolding tests
made with Bleton by a small committee of savants quoted in No. 15 of
Part X., p. 269. What are we to say to the above evidence? It
is true that Dr. Thouvenel mentions that he "led " Bleton when bind-
folded, and therefore involuntary muscular suggestion may possibly
account for most of the success of Bleton, but the results appear too
xxxviii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 209
remarkable and too uniformly successful to be wholly explained in this
way ; nor is it clear that Bleton was always touched by Dr. Thouvenel,
who, it must be remembered, was a man of scientific training and habit
of mind. Moreover, if the blindfolded dowser succeeds, as in Nos. 4,
5, and 6, when involuntary muscular action appears an inadequate
cause, another explanation must be sought, and this explanation may,
if established, be the true cause of success in some of the other cases
where muscular guidance is possible.
No dowser of whom we have any knowledge in the present
century seems to have rivalled Bleton, though it is much to be
regretted no scientific man ever took the trouble carefully to test
the remarkable powers of the late Mr. W. Lawrence, of Bristol, and
Mr. J. Mullins, of Chippenham—names that will be familiar to
readers of my previous Report. It will be noticed that Bleton, like
Stone and other dowsers, mentions the peculiar sensations he experi
enced when over underground water ; this may be a delusion, but
the coincidence is remarkable, as it is wholly improbable the English
dowser ever heard of Bleton, or had obtained the idea from him.
As already remarked, I do not know of any blind dowsers ; if such
exist, it would be most interesting to ascertain what degree of success
they achieve. Of course, if there be any supernormal power possessed
by a dowser, it is improbable that blindness would be prejudicial to
its existence.
I will here add two or three cases which, though startling at first
sight, may be capable of explanation by muscular guidance, and there
fore I will not weary the reader with multiplying other instances of
this kind that have reached me.
No. 8. Judge Spinks' Experiments.
A striking case of the success of an amateur dowser when
blindfolded is narrated by a judge in British Columbia ; this was also
given in the previous Report, p. 27. His Honour Judge Spinks writes
to Mr. P. W. H. Myers as follows :—
Vernon, Okanagan, B.C., February 27Wi, 1893.
The rod works in my hands. I was rather sceptical, and thought that
my own mind might work in some unknown manner on the rod and cause it
to turn down where I fancied there ought to be water. I was blindfolded
and led about with the wand, for about an hour at least, until I could not
hold the wand upright without great pain. Each time the wand dipped, a
peg was driven into the ground to mark the spot. I was walked in all
directions, and passed over the same ground again and again, but in no
instance did the rod fail to dip when it came to a peg. I have sunk two
wells on the credit of the wand, and in both instances have found water, in
both these instances contrary to the advice of the well-sinking experts. The
power appears to increase rapidly with use. When experimenting with the
B
210 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part
rod over a water hose, I had the water turned on and off several times, and
could distinctly feel the jar that one hears in such cases.
Ward Spinks.
In a subsequent letter Judge Spinks gives some additional evidence.
A third well was sunk upon the indications afforded by the rod and
also proved successful ; between two of the wells the rod would not
move ; there the foundations of his house were subsequently dug and
proved dry, though "only a few feet from being immediately between
wells 2 and 3." I wrote recently to Judge Spinks to inquire whether
the pegs were put in before he was blindfolded and if some one led him
all the time he was unable to see. To this I received the following
reply :—
^ ' Rossland Club, Rossland, B.C., January 12th, 1900.
It is some years since Mr. Streatfiold and I experimented with the
" wand," and my memory may be at fault. As well as I can remember, the
facts were as follows:—I found several places where the "wand" dipped
and marked them by driving pegs into the ground. Afterwards Mr.
Streatfield led me blindfolded over the ground and the "wand" moved
over every peg, I believe; I then led him and the "wand" dipped in his
hands as it did in mine ; he was blindfolded also. We led each other by the
arm, so there ims contact. Of late years I have been travelling too much
to make experiments, but I tried the "wand" last Fall, and was surpised
to find that it did not work with me as it use to. »,- i,•
\\ ARD SPINKS.
It will thus be seen that in this case the amateur dowser was
touched, or led, by a friend who could see, and hence the evidential
value of the case is destroyed, as unconscious muscular guidance might
account for the success achieved when blindfolded.
No. 9. Mr. Withncll's Experiments.
The next case relates to the blindfolding of Mr. W. Stone, evidence
of whose success as a dowser was given in the last Report and also in
the preceding pages. The following Report is abridged from Morton'x
Lincolnshire Almanac for 1899 : —
Some two years ago the late Mr. J. B. Dunham, of the firm of Messrs.
Dunham and Sons, Horncastle, commissioned Mr. Stone to find a supply of
water at his farm, High Toynton, near Horncastle, where it was needed
badly. On reaching the farm Mr. J. B. Dunham declared his intention of
putting the dowser to a severe test. With a V-shaped hazel twig cut from
a hedge close by, the diviner went over the ground in question, a field
located on an incline some 200 yds. from the main road, and soon indicated
a spot where he averred a plentiful supply of pure water would be found at
a depth of about 25 ft. As he passed and repassed over this particular spot,
the dowsing twig, held in the manner before described, turned and bent
completely over towards him. The two spectators, watching every move
ment, candidly informed the diviner that they believed the turning of the
xxxviii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 211
twig was due to some sharp movement on the part of the holder, and Mr.
Stone readily acceded to the request that each in turn should be allowed to
hold the mystic twig, as he himself held it, over the same place. But do as
they would, the twig never moved in the slightest with either. Mr. Stone
then suffered himself to be completely blindfolded and led away from the
spot which he had indicated as the place where water would be found. His
two guides, holding his arms (in the hands of which the twig was loosely
held), led him about in a circle and then in a zig-zag fashion, managing by
devious ways to lead him over the located spot, previously marked by a
stake, and each time as the diviner crossed it the twig curled as before. At
the same time those on each side of him distinctly felt a twitching in the
diviner's arms, such as might be caused by an electric shock. When the
coverings from his eyes were removed, Mr. Stone remarked that he knew
from the sensations he experienced that he had crossed the place he had
pointed out two or three times. Our previous doubts were removed ; and
more particularly was this the case when a short time afterwards a well was
sunk on the site, and a most excellent spring of pure water found at a depth
of 24 ft. In September last the writer journeyed to the same locale and
found that the supply of water was as good and as strong as ever, being
even more than was required on the farm.
Having ascertained that the writer of the above report was a
journalist named Mr. F. Withnell, who took an active part in the
experiment, I wrote to Mr. Withnell to inquire whether he had blind
folded Mr. Stone effectively, and received the following reply :—
News Office, Homcastle, Lincolnshire, September loth, 1899.
The Divining Rod was a thing unknown to me before I came into
Lincolnshire. Therefore, as a journalist (of fifteen years' standing, and a
member and officer of the branch of the Institute of Journalists for ten
years), combined with a scepticism born of a rough life and much travel
abroad, I determined to investigate the matter for myself. I will vouch for
the particulars contained in the report, and if necessary can give you the
names and addresses of other persons (men of standing and experience) who
have put Mr. Stone, in his water finding, through a similar ordeal, and
assure me they are, as the result, fully convinced of Mr. Stone's power of
finding water, and even gauging the depth at which it is to be found in
apparently the driest of places.
I blindfolded Mr. Stone personally ; closely folding a silk handkerchief
and tying it tightly over his eyes, afterwards pulling a close texture bag,
made of canvas, over his head and twisting the mouth of it round his neck.
There was no mistake, therefore, that the blindfolding was thorough, and
that he was totally unable to see downwards. Mr. Stone assured me, and
those who were with me, that he had never before been over the ground,
and that it was purely on account of the hazel twig turning over in his hands
that he was able to say that water would be found at that spot. I was
thoroughly satisfied with the experiment and said so, and my companions
also expressed themselves in similar terms.
I have been with Mr. Stone on other water-finding excursions since
then, and I have never known him fail in his findings or be wrong in his
r 2
212 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part
calculations as to the depth, which he approximately estimated in each case.
He informs me. that he has had failures, but these are of rare occurrence
and separated by long intervals. May I add that I have only been brought
into contact with Mr. Stone professionally. He resides at Old Bolingbroke,
which is nine miles distant from Horncastle, where I live.
Frep. C. Withnell.
As Mr. Withnell knew the spot fixed on by Mr. Stone, and it
was " marked by a stake," it is quite possible to explain Mr. Stone's
success in this blindfolding experiment by some involuntary muscular
action on the part of " his two guides holding his arms ; " albeit both
Mr. Withnell and Mr. Stone have written to me subsequently, stating
that no guidance was possible, as touching was excluded. This may
have been another trial at the same place. Here is Mr. Withnell's
letter :—
27, Bridge Street, Horncastle, Lincolnshire, June Sth, 1900.
As regards my account of the blindfolding of Mr. Stone, I certainly wish
it to be understood that Mr. Stone proceeded alone and untouched after
being blindfolded when searching for water on Mr. Dunham's farm at High
Tointon ; the only place where I personally have submitted him to a test.
After Mr. Stone was blindfolded, I and the late Mr. Beavis Dunham simply
led him away from some paraphernalia that was on the ground and against
which he might have stumbled, and then, releasing our hold, we allowed him
to take whatever course he chose to take, assuring him, on his own request,
that we would carefully watch him and give him a warning shout if in his
peregrinations he appeared likely to blunder against the hedge. As he
walked about free from obstruction, we neither touched him nor called out to
him. I have only this week verified this by conversation with two others who
were on the ground at the time, viz. : Mr. Dunham's foreman and another.
Fred. C. Withnell.
No. 10. Mr. Emerson's Experiments.
So far I have quoted the dowser's success when blindfolded, but there
are cases of failure. I have mentioned one, when I tested Rodwell at
Wimbledon in 1890. Professor Ray Lankester's test of the same lad
is a well-known instance of failure, and the following case of failure is
so little known that I refer to it at some length, as it appeared in the
leading scientific organ in America, the American Journal of Science,
now called Silliman's Journal, and doubtless had much influence on
scientific opinion in America. The investigator is the Rev. Ralph
Emerson, who five years previously had published a paper in the same
journal on some successful experiments with the divining rod. Mr.
Emerson's paper is so very long that I am compelled to summarise
what he says with regard to the blindfolding experiment.
In 1821 he found at a farm in Ohio that a successful well had been sunk
at a spot indicated by a "diviner," where no sign of water previously existed.
xxxviii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 213
One of the fanner's sons, a lad of 12, discovered the rod "worked" in his
hands, and it was this young lad Mr. Emerson tested. In the first instance
the young dowser, with his eyes open, professed to trace the course of an
underground vein of water, the position being marked by Mr. Emerson ;
the boy was then blindfolded, led a short distance away from the spot and
told again to trace the course of the water. He did so and the rod moving,
he declared he was over the spot ; this turned out to be perfectly correct.
But on a second and a third attempt he failed, and afterwards "incessantly,"
so that, Mr. Emerson adds, "there could be no mistake, the illusion of all
attraction underground vanished at once. The motion of the rod remained,
but it must be accounted for some other way." Mr. Emerson then shows
how the motion of the rod may be caused by a very slight muscular action on
the part of the dowser ;—this part of his paper is worth notice and is given
subsequently (p. 287). He explains the success of the blindfolded lad on the
first occasion by his probably keeping count of the steps he took, but that
his incessant failures afterwards were due to his losing count, and hence Mr.
Emerson concludes that the boy was a " young fox " and " the pretensions
of the diviner are worthless." 1
A singularly illogical and unscientific conclusion, but one very
characteristic of the numerous "exposures" with which the history
of this subject abounds. The surprising thing is that a precisely
opposite conclusion was not arrived at, viz., that the lad was not right
every time, and that Mr. Emerson did not as triumphantly assert
that he had conclusively established the truth of a mysterious
influence exerted by the "veins of water" on the boy, and so "set
the question for ever at rest " on behalf of the dowser. For, on
reading the account carefully, it seems that Mr. Emerson in every
case was holding the blindfolded boy : " I took him lightly by the
elbow " ; "I guided him back " ; "I led the lad to the next spot
and he missed it again " ; "I led him to and fro, but he failed
incessantly," etc. Now, if the boy had been a "young fox," he might
with perfect ease have been right every time, simply by allowing
himself to be guided by the muscular indications which Mr. Emerson
might have given involuntarily whenever he crossed the right track,
just as successful finds are made in the " willing game." The whole
series of experiments made by Mr. Emerson are absolutely valueless,
and hence his conclusion is equally so. There is, further, no evidence
to show that this young boy was a " dowser " at all ; not only,
therefore, was the experimenter unskilled, but the instrument he
employed was probably defective, and a confusion of thought existed
in the experimenter as to the object sought for (see p. 141).

PART VI.
Details of a Few Further Cases of Amateuk Dowsers.
Those who may have read the previous lleport will remember the
numerous cases of amateur dowsers that are there cited, particulars
being given of upwards of twenty-five individuals of both sexes, and in
all ranks of life, who had discovered by accident that the forked twig
twisted round in their hands, and had used its indications with some
success in the discovery of underground water. It may be of interest
if I now give somewhat fuller details of a few of the additional cases
of amateur dowsers that have reached me.
No. 1. Sir R. Harington, Bart.
Among notable persons who have found that they could successfully
use the divining rod, and who have made use of its indications with
advantage, may be mentioned his Honour, Sir Richard Harington,
Bart., Chairman of Quarter Sessions for Herefordshire. In the County
Council Times, for July 17th, 1897, Sir R. Harington published the
following interesting letter of his experience with the rod : —
Whitbourne Court, Worcester, July IMA, 1897.
I discovered, quite by accident, and at the age of fifty-seven, that I
possessed this power [of using the divining rod]. I was building a new lodge
to this place, and, desiring to find a water supply, I sent (more from curiosity
than from any belief in its efficacy) for the gardener of a neighbour, who
was said to be able to use the divining rod. He came. I watched his
proceedings, and then requested him to allow me to try the rod myself. I
did so, and, to my great surprise, found that with me it assumed the vertical
position in the same places in which it had done so with him. He discovered
water, but the place which he assigned to it turning out inconvenient, I
proceeded to investigate on my own account. I had in the meantime been
told the method employed to estimate the depth of the water beneath the
surface. I found indications of water at a depth which I estimated at about
17 ft. to 20ft. I caused a well to be sunk, and a small supply was found at
about 18 ft. This, however, was at the beginning of a long drought, and
late in the summer the supply failed. I tried again at the same place, when
my rod told me there was water about 10 ft. deeper. I had the well
deepened, and found more, fortunately just within the 28 ft. limit, and there
has since (this was five years ago) been a sufficient and unfailing supply for
the use of the lodge.
The most practical use I have since turned my power to is the discovery
of leaks in a large artificial piece of water round my house. This for some
distance runs parallel to tho course of a brook at a much lower level, a road
xxxviii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 215
passing along the top of the embankment, the slope of which is covered with
wood and undergrowth. Occasionally a rat or rabbit makes a hole, which
draws off the water, and is difficult to find by ordinary search. I always
find it easily with the divining rod.
I have never been at the trouble to ascertain how many kinds of wood
are serviceable, but the peach and Spanish chestnut will serve with me as
well as hazel.
As may be supposed, I am not constantly searching for convenient places
to dig wells ; but I occasionally use the rod for the purpose of showing
friends how it acts, and they generally try it themselves. I very rarely find
any one who possesses the power which I do alone, but almost invariably
when the person who cannot use it alone holds one end of the fork and I
the other, it works ; in some cases more strongly than with myself alone.
But I do not find that I have the power claimed by Mr. Gataker of
estimating the volume of the water. The effect on me is the same, whether
it is a mere trickle or a copious current.
That the power exists, and that it depends on some natural cause
connected with the physical idiosyncracy of the individual possessing it, the
operation of which is not yet understood, I cannot, after the evidence of my
own senses, doubt. To stigmatise the action of those who do possess it as
charlatanry appears to mo a specimen of that arrogant ignorance which
despises what it cannot understand.
I may add that the extent of the power seems to vary in individuals.
For example, I cannot calculate the volume ; my original instructor could
not calculate either depth or volume, and, although the rod usually acts
when held by another person and myself as above described, one of my
daughters appears to have a kind of neutralising power, and when she holds
one end of the fork and I the other, it will not act at all.
If the Local Government Board official, who, I understand, threatens
Mr. Gataker and his fellows with prosecutions under the Vagrant Act, will
do me the honour of calling here at any time when I am at home, I shall be
happy to try the experiment with him, and let him try for himself—first,
whether he possesses the power alone, and, secondly, if not, whether the
rod acts with him jointly with me. His scepticism will not affect its action.
The power is obviously purely physical.
RlCHAED HARINGTON,
Chairman of Quarter Sessions for Herefordshire.
In reply to my inquiries Sir Richard Harington was good enough
to write me at length confirming the facts mentioned in his published
letter, and he also states that, on the other hand, the rod seemed to
give him a wrong indication on one occasion.
In a chalk soil in Essex two or three years ago it indicated water on a
friend's property near the surface. My friend dug down to the depth
guessed, but found none, and I dissuaded them from incurring further
expenses, lest I should be mistaken.
The principal practical use to which I have put the power is to fix
the locality of leaks in the bank of an artificial piece of water, and in
216 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part
determining the course of underground drains and leaks therefrom. For
these purposes I have found the power practically useful.
Sir Richard Harington in reply to my question as to whether he
could give me any further particulars of the use of his power, or the
dates, etc., at which he found the leaks in the bank, writes as follows ;
after giving some details which are contained in his published letter,
he adds :—
Whitbourne Court, Worcester, October 29th, 1899.
It has occasionally happened that leakage into the brook has taken place
through rat holes and the like, the locality of which my servants have been
unable to discover. When this has been the case, I have used the divining
rod, which has always told me correctly where the leak was. I cannot give
dates, but the event has occurred on two or three occasions during the last
ten years.
The piece of water in question is supplied at one end from the above-
mentioned brook by means of a culvert of some length .
It appearing that there was waste of water in this culvert, I tried the
divining rod, walking parallel to it. It told me, as the fact turned out to
be, that the leaks were numerous, so many, indeed, that it was useless to
repair the culvert, inside which I had to lay glazed pipes. This took place
in the year 1898. Richard Harington, Bart.
The use of the " rod " to find a hidden leak in a culvert or reservoir
has been successfully tried by others ; see, e.g., p. 41 of my previous
Report, where the amateur dowsers, Messrs. Young and Robertson, inde
pendently fixed on the same spot. Mr. Westlake, F.G.S., has recently
informed me of another case, where the dowser, R. Pavey, of Cheddar,
did the same thing at the moat round the Bishop's Palace at Wells.
An engineer was first employed, and had spent £20 in trying to find
the leak, but failed. Pavey, though a stranger, found the leak at once,
and it was then stopped at a cost of a few shillings. Mr. Westlake
visited the place and ascertained the facts ; he states the engineer was
much impressed by Pavey's success, as he, after careful and costly
examination of the place, had failed. Experiments of this kind are
worth careful repetition under strict scientific supervision.
No. 2. Mr. E. Hippisley.
One of the most successful amateur dowsers of whom I have
heard was the late Mr. Edwin Hippisley, a leading man in Wells,
Somerset. Mr. Hippisley was a member of the Institute of Surveyors,
and his firm, Hippisley and Sons, are the principal surveyors and
land agents in Wells. At a meeting of the Wells Archteological
Society, held at the Bishop's Palace, in Wells, in April, 1892, Mr.
Hippisley read a paper on his experiences with the dowsing rod. A
xxxvm.] On the So-called Divining Bod. 217
verbatim report of that paper appeared in the Wells Journal for
April 21st, 1892, together with an interesting discussion that followed,
in which the Bishop of Wells, who was in the chair, the Dean, and
others took part. Mr. Hippisley's paper is too long to quote, but the
following are some abridged extracts from it. Though his theory (a
common one) is improbable, his facts are of considerable interest.
In using the rod I always find the point turn upwards to a nearly vertical
position when approaching an underground spring, and it reverses its action
after the spring is passed over : upon turning round and walking over the
same spot the same thing occurs. The only theory I can form is that those
persons who have the "gift," as it is called, are more susceptible to electrical
action, water being a good conductor of electricity, and that the rod is
moved owing to some sensation in, or electric influence on, the body of the
operator.
Mr. Hippisley then proceeds to give details of numerous instances
of his discovery of underground water by means of the rod, which
proved of great practical value.
For instance, at the Lodge to the Cemetery at Portway, at the
Sanatorium near Axbridge, at cottages near East Horrington, at
Burcot, at Wookey Hole, and at two or three other estates in
Somerset. At Cotford Farm, near Taunton, a well was being sunk
for the Western Somerset Asylum, and after 50 ft. had been sunk,
Mr. Hippisley, by means of the rod, directed the men to drive a
heading west of the well, when a largely increased supply of water
was obtained. Another and remarkable case at Lytes Cary I have
already given on a previous page (see p. 174.)
No. 3. Mr. J. If. Jones.
The next case is that of a country gentleman to whom I have
already referred, and who is well-known to me, Mr. J. H. Jones, of
Mullinabro, near Waterford. In answer to my request for a brief
account of his experience, Mr. Jones writes as follows : —
Waterford, January 3rd, 1900.
Some few years ago, a friend and neighbour of mine, after trying in vain
to obtain an unpolluted water supply for his house, decided on enlisting the
services of Mr. Mullins, the dowser. I was asked to witness the experiments
and was glad to do so.
Mr. Mullinn, on his arrival in Waterford, per steamer, drove rapidly to
his client's house and in a few minutes indicated an underground water
supply near the house quite unconnected, as he alleged, with the flow to a
polluted pump-well in the stable yard ; he pointed out a favourable spot for
sinking, where subsequently a splendid supply of pure water was found at
about 30 ft. deep. On the evening of Mullins's visit, I, for curiosity, cut a
forked rod similar to the one he used, and experimenting in a field at home,
218 Professor W. F. Barrett. [PART
found, to my surprise, that at one place the rod turned vigorously in my-
hands. Walking onwards in a zig-zag direction (similar to the way Mr.
Mullins proceeded in tracing an underground flow of water), I traced the line
of flow detected by me until I found its outcrop in a never-failing spring at
some distance from the place where I first found the rod to turn. The
direction of the flow to this spring greatly surprised me, for I had hitherto
imagined that the spring was fed from a lake, the water from which, at about
half-a-mile from the spring, disappeared under the face of a limestone cliff,
emerging in a short distance. Here, I imagine, there could be no "sub
conscious " influence derived from my knowledge that a spring existed some
distance from where I first felt the influence of the rod, inasmuch as the line
of flow traced out by me by its moans was in a direction nearly at right
angles to my preconceived notion of the direction of the supposed feeder of
the spring.
The ensuing evening I tested myself where Mr. Mullins had found the
line of flow for my friend, and I found I could trace it exactly as he had
done. Here it might be said I was unconsciously influenced by Mr.
Mullins's action, but, as I traced the flow for some fields beyond where he
stopped and where neither of us had any idea the line ran, the theory of
the influence of his findings on me seems to break down.
The above experiments converted me (in spite of my determination at
first to doubt the buna fides of the dowser's indications) from being a
prejudiced sceptic to being a confirmed believer in the genuineness of the
dowser's claims to point out underground flows of water.
What is the mystic influence emanating from water, and why it should
produce the effect I have described is a problem for scientists to solve.
It is marvellous to find a flow of water, as I have proved, exercising a
strong influence through 70 to 80 ft. of a dense quartzite rock.
The influence is in my case independent of contact with the ground. It
effects me though insulated by standing upon a support resting on glass. I
can feel the influence of underground water in a house as readily in the
topmost storey as on the ground floor. I can also feel it— apparently as
strongly as when standing on the ground,—when I am riding, driving, or
travelling by rail, and this not over predetermined places, but over untried
ground.
Mr. Jones then goes on to describe how he endeavoured to verify
the accuracy of the indications given by the rod by going over ground
that had been previously traversed by other dowsers before he was
acquainted with the places they had fixed upon as water bearing ; the
result, he says, convinced him that some peculiar effect was produced
upon hitn by underground water, an effect that caused a certain
spasmodic muscular contraction in his arms and hands, thus producing
an involuntary movement of the rod. Mr. Jones states that on
approaching the spring, the point of the rod begins to creep upward
and is more or less violently jerked into a vertical position when
directly over the water ; the rod he recognises as merely an index of
some peculiar impression produced upon himself.

No. 4. Mr. J. D. Enys, F.G.S.
In the preceding Report (Vol. XIII., p. 7) it was mentioned
that the President of the Royal Geological Society of Cornwall, Mr.
J. D. Enys, F.G.S., was an amateur dowser. In a recent letter to me
Mr. Enys says :—
Enys, Penryn, Cornwall, May fith, 1900.
In answer to your questions I may say (1) that only a slight feeling is
produced in me when the rod commences to move over underground water,
but a distinct feeling of relief when I let it go. (2) In a place I indicated
(which place was also chosen by the dowser who showed me how to use the
rod) an abundant supply of water was reached at 96 ft., which has stood the
test of the late dry season.
The clerk of my Parish Council here (St. Gluvias), Mr. .). Lowry, tried
the rod, at my request, over a place where I knew a spring existed ; suddenly
I heard him cry out, with genuine surprise, " It is alive, sir ; it is alive."
This exactly describes the sensation when the rod moves. I am unable, how
ever, to form any opinion of scientific value on the action of the rod.
John D. Enys.
The interest of this letter is in the fact that not only is Mr. Enys
a gentleman of high standing in his county, but he is also an able
geologist. I asked Mr. Enys if he would try some blindfolding
experiments, with precautions to avoid unconscious muscular guidance
and other possible sources of error, but he has not as yet had time to
do so. I hope he will pursue the subject.
No. 5. Mr. J. F. Young.
In the previous Report, I referred on page 40, to two amateur
dowsers, Mr. J. F. Young and Mr. Robertson, of Llanelly, S. Wales,
who have written a little book on the divining rod. Mr. Young has
had an extensive correspondence with me, and has also in person
related to me the numerous experiments he has made with the rod in
the attempt to arrive at some solution of its perplexing movements.
I have been much struck with Mr. Young's enthusiasm, intelligence and
scientific spirit, and it may be interesting to put on record the follow
ing account which Mr. Young has sent me of his own experience.
The account is of greater interest from the fact that Mr. Young
was unaware, until he subsequently read my previous Report, that
the divining rod, like planchette, was an autoscope, and therefore its
movements were profoundly influenced by any predetermined idea or
suggestion. Mr. Young's experience is very similar to that of some
early writers on the rod, such as Zeid'er, who in his Panlomysterium
gives an account of the manifold objects which excite the motion of
220 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part
the rod, and hence suggested the title of his book.1 Mr. Young writes
to me as follows :—
Llanelly, South Wales, July 3rd, 1897.
I will, with your permission, place before you some of my personal
experiences with the "rod," trusting you will understand I am only a
struggling tradesman, with but little learning and very little spare time, but
with an earnest desire to search for the truth, and with that object I have
been for years an ardent reader of mental physiology, and psychological
books of all kinds.
I soon became convinced that the movement of the rod was due to an
involuntary action on the part of the "diviner." To prove this I have
watched carefully my own hands (and others') and in every case when the
subject sought for has been found, 1 observe a difference in the relation of
one hand to the other ; there is in my own case a slight advance of the right
hand. In other cases with larger rods, I note the arms at the elbows, which
are usually fixed to the side, give greater indications of a closer grip, and the
hands are clenched together ; others watching have confirmed my views.
What causes this involunary movement of the muscles I cannot say, but
I will give a series of cases where it is produced and where I have used the
rod successfully.
Water-finding was the first which engaged my attention ; finding the rod
turn in my hand, I tried every available means of proving the reality of a
water-finding faculty. At last I was convinced of its truth and its useful
ness to mankind. Electricity is generally put forward to explain mysteries
we know nothing of, and I fell into this same trap. I set to work, and made
many electrical appliances (which gave me great pleasure, as it revealed what
I previously knew but little of) to tost the matter, both in relation to the
soil, the atmosphere and my own personality, and at one time I thought I
had it within my grasp, but alas, with more knowledge, events transpired
which toppled my electrical theory over. I left electricity for the study of
"Odic Force," Animal Magnetism, Telepathy, Clairvoyance, Automatism,
etc., and latterly the Spiritualist hypothesis, including in its wide range our
" subliminal consciousness," and I look upon this last as one that meets the
questions at all, or nearly all points ; and here I may add in opposition to
some arguments which have been put forth by some, it seems to me, taken
on the lines of this latter theory, it becomes a proper subject for investiga
tion by the S.P.R., as it is a question of the; study of human personality
and not of the rod.
I take it that the different sensations and experiences of different water-
finders is a matter of idiosyncrasy, as in my own person these vary according
to conditions, from a strong convulsive feeling at one time, another a state
of ecstasy, at another a peculiar, unpleasant feeling at the pit of stomach,
and latterly a quick shock, darting, as it were, through the nervous system

1700. It has eleven plates and thirty-one figures of different kinds of " divining rods,'
made of every kind of forked article, such as tongs, snuffers, etc Later on, I will
make further reference to this lxxik, an excellent abstract of which has been made
for me by Miss Stokes.
xxxviii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 221
at the moment of the perception. This sensation belongs especially to
Class G of experiments (see below).
In a number of the experiments the rod seems indispensable, but even
then merely as an indicator, its motion being a notification to my brain that
the influence has taken place, which otherwise would not have reached my
consciousness, and for these especially delicate tests I use the form of
instrument enclosed. It is a small aluminium fork, light and delicate to the
touch, and, being nearly void of elasticity, no tension can be put on. The
instrument I hold lightly between finger and thumb of each hand, and when
it acts, it either slowly creeps up or suddenly twists at the moment of the
impression.
The experiments for convenience of reference I will classify, commencing
with Class A, which includes all experiments with water, the feet in every
case coming directly or indirectly in contact with the soil, the latter through
the medium of a horse, or some form of conveyance, or anything that
touches terra firma. The so-called insulation by bottles and other non
conductors, or even rubber boots, may be traced in their several effects to
imagination on the part of the water- finder.
I have made some very critical tests in this direction, and have found all
so-called insulation a failure.
I may here remark that in all investigation in this matter (with a good
sensitiee) that suggestion, thought or spoken, of the agent plays a very
important part.
Class B includes the finding of metals of all kinds, either hidden, buried,
or lying on the surface. A coin or two may be (by another person) hidden
with some opaque covering. The hands of the sensitive, with or without the
rod, being merely passed above the table, its whereabouts is at once localised
and the finger goes down straight upon the coin. Telepathy cannot explain
this, as it can be so arranged that no one can know where the coins lie.
With the case of coins I must not omit to include the singular fact that
where metal has lain, it leaves an influence for many hours, which can in the
early hours be detected as well as the coin. Or, on a country road, say, but
seldom used, I can locate the track of the wheel and the spots where the
horse has trod. A wonderful variety of experiments can be made under this
group.
Class C. —The finding of heat rnys that have fallen on earth, stone, wood,
etc. : of a shadow7 or line of light, etc.
Class l). —The localising of a given spot, say a square inch, on which
sound has been projected closely ; this vibration soon passes away, and cannot
be done unless tried at once.
Class K.—Currents of electricity in a wire ; but this is difficult to prove,
as the influence might be due to the metal and not electricity, as in the case
of water flowing through metal pipes.
Class F. —The finding of a locality where friction has been made, say
rubbing a floor, carpet, etc., if dry. On a dry walk it is successful ; on a
wet one, not so.
Class G. — Under this heading the experiments are so numerous that my
naming two or three will give you an idea how easy it would be to extend
222 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part
them ; the phenomena taking place here are really the same that underlie
the whole of the phenomena connected with the divining rod faculty.
Mrs. Young (my wife) whom I shall hereafter call the agent, and myself
the subject.
Expt. 1. —Picture to yourself Mrs. Y. sitting at one end of a room; a
certain line is indicated on which I shall walk down the room from her and
with my back toward her ; she has a watch before her, and at a given moment,
only known to herself, wills me to stop ; that moment the rod moves and I
stop. Sometimes when in good form I can do so minus the rod.
Expt. 2 —Mrs. Y. in same position fixes mentally, unknown to me (my
back always toward her) on a sprig, flower or pattern on the carpet iu a
given line. I start on the quest ; as soon as my foot "touches the spot," the
rod moees.
Expt. 3.—I now walk along near the wall. Mrs. Y. has fixed on a spray,
flower, picture, bracket, vase or some such small object, say the height of
my shoulder or head. As soon as I get opposite the signal comes. Many of
these are conducted by the agent in one room and the subject in another.
You will observe here also there cannot be any bodily contact.
Expt. 4. —Cut, say, a dozen pieces of paper all alike, an inch square,
mark one only, as you like, say pencil initials or a number. After stirring
and mixing up, place all on floor in different parts, not knowing the nmrked
ono. The subject walks about, and ultimately finds the marked paper. In
this way you cut out thought reading or telepathy.
Expt. 5. —A hair from head or beard is placed on the floor, the subject,
of course, being absent. The agent leaves the room, accompanied with a
stranger (who is not in the secret) to see fair play ; or the subject may be
blindfolded or walks backward. As soon as he reaches the spot his rod
moves. I won't trouble you with more, as you can picture to your mind's
eye scores of similar experiments, those above narrated, with others quite
its extraordinary, all indicating an intelligence—call it what you will—not
under our control. It is almost needless to add that times occur with me
and also with the agent when this cannot be done, and there are times when
the power, whatever it may be, appears to be overflowing. It is, however,
exhausting, and, after half-a-dozen experiments, a rest is required. I will
do my best to carry out any other experiments you may suggest, and hope
what I have recorded may be of some use.
The foregoing experiments must simply be taken for what they
are worth ; they are not quoted as of evidential value, for we do not
know, e.g., how far any involuntary and unintentional signs from the
" agent " may have reached the " subject" of these experiments. The
detection of points de repere by hypnotised subjects, usually attributed
to hyperesthesia, resembles Mr. Young's detection of the track of a
horse, etc., by the use of rod, and I am inclined to think the explana
tion in both cases is similar. I have given this letter at length, as it
demonstrates the all-important part played by any suggestion or idea
in producing the involuntary muscular action that causes the twisting
xxxvin.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 223
of the rod. It further shows how absurd is the dowser's notion that
underground water must be indicated when the forked twig twists
round in his hands.
No. 6. Mr. R. G. D. Tosswill.
Through watching Mr. Young's use of the forked twig in Devon
shire, a gentleman at Budleigh Salterton, Mr. Tosswill, found the twig
also moved when he held it. He soon became an enthusiastic amateur
dowser, and sent me the following account of his experience after
reading my previous Report :—
Budleigh Salterton, Devon, October 13th, 1897.
The first time that 1 saw the " hazel rod " used in seeking for water was
on August 11th, 1897.
My friend who used it was searching for the spot underneath which a
small stream of water was flowing through the adit of an old disused copper
mine. He asked me to walk alongside him and closely observe the move
ments of the rod as he passed over the water. I did so, and soon observed
the top of the rod quiver, and then move slowly forward and outwards away
from his bodj', until the point of the rod pointed downwards to the ground
at his feet.
He then asked me to try it, and walk over the same course that he had
taken, holding the rod in precisely the same manner. I did so, holding the
rod perpendicularly, with the end of either branch laid on the palm of
each hand, with Angel's and thumbs tightly closed, and back of the hands
downwards.
On advancing, I fully expected to find that if the rod moved at all in my
hands, it would do so in precisely the same manner as it did with my friend.
To my astonishment, however, I found that on coming to the same spot, the
rod quivered slightly, and then moved towards my own body, imoards, and
then downwards, pointing to the ground. This was exactly in the opposite
direction to which it had previously moved when in my friend's hands.
Since then I have used the hazel rod or some other " autoscope " nearly
every day in seeking and tracing underground springs, water pipes, drains,
hidden coins, etc. Hazel, willow, beech, thorn, elm and honeysuckle twigs,
as also copper and other wire rods or forks that I have used, holding them
perpendicularly either in the closed hands or between the thumbs and
forefingers, move always in the same direction, i.e., inwards and towards
my body, and then downwards pointing to the ground.
Robert G. D. Tosswill.
No. 7. Mr. G. II. Ward-Humphreys.
In the Cheltenham Examiner for March 24th, lt97, Mr. G. H.
Ward- Humphreys gives a lengthy report of his first experience with
the divining rod, which affords a good illustration of the genesis of
an amateur dowser and the amazement—shared by educated as well
as illiterate persons— excited by the apparently automatic motion of
the twig.
224 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part
The night before, Mr. Gataker had expressed the belief that I was likely
to possess the power of " divination " ; and he was now very anxious for me to
try my luck at once. He cut several twigs and armed me with one, and
then, taking me down to the side of the lake where water already found
was pouring in, he suggested I should walk across the covered-in stream.
This I did three or four times in succession, holding the twig, but I was
conscious of nothing, nor did I see any movement of the twig. He then,
however, laid his hands upon the back of mine, and he walking backwards
in front of me, we together crossed over the flowing water. Immediately
the V-shaped twig turned completely round in my grip. Perhaps it is
unnecessary to say anything about the astonishment with which I regarded
this extraordinary movement of the inanimate twig. But what happened
afterwards was even more remarkable : for, on going round to unbroken
ground upon the other side of the lake, at one spot I felt the twig, which
1 was carrying with its point downward, so turn in my hand that the point
was raised through an angle of 90deg. Inquiries elicited the fact that this
spot was exactly over a stream which had been found twelve months ago.
But even now I was not convinced : though I could not believe that the
others were deceiving me, I thought it possible that I might be deceiving
myself. So I suggested that I might be blindfolded, led some distance from
the spot where I was then standing, and then should be guided in such a
direction that I must cross the line of the same stream. This was done,
and I started my walk at a distance which I afterwards found to be about
60 yds. away. Walking then in the direction I have indicated, I suddenly
became aware that the twig was commencing to move. This tendency became
stronger at every step. I cast to the right and to the left, and finally guided
by the stronger movements of the twig, walked some 15 yds. to the left of
my original path and then stopped, the twig having now moved through an
angle of 180 deg. My companions, who had hitherto been silent, were greatly
amused at the sceptic [the writer]—who found, when able to see, that he had
stopped about 3 ft. away from a peg which had been put in to mark the site
of one of Mr. Gataker's springs ! After this, scepticism vanished.
It will be observed that Mr. Ward-Humphreys states that when
blindfolded he was "led," so that the explanation of his success in that
case may be due to the involuntary guidance exercised by those who
were touching him.
No. 8. Mr. G. F. Attree.
In the Estates Gazette for February 3rd, 1 900, Mr. G. F. Attree, an
auctioneer and estate agent of Brighton, gives a lengthy account of nis
experiences as an amateur dowser. He points out how prejudiced he
was against the whole subject until, after watching a dowser at work,
he discovered to his surprise that the twig moved in his own hands,
twisting round whenever he came to the places marked by the dowser.
He goes on to say :—
The operator holds the two ends of the twig so that the point of the V
is at a right angle with his body and the thumb of each hand is in contact
xxxviii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 225
with one end of the twig. In this position he walks over the land where he
wishes to ascertain what springs exist. On coming over running water (no
matter how deep it may be from the surface) the operator feels a tingling
sensation in his hands and arms, and the twig immediately twists over until
its point has completed more than half a circle.
During the year 1898 I spent much of my little spare time with the twig,
frequently testing springs which I could prove through existing wells, and by
this means, and by measuring the width of the influence on the surface of
the ground, became able to gauge accurately the depth and strength of a
number of springs. ... I cannot say why so few persons possess the
power, nor what the current is that passes from running water through the
body of the operator, causing the twig to twist. All I have been able to
ascertain is, that it is not an ordinary electrical current, for insulation by
glass or indiarubber, which will stop the one, has no effect upon that which
is brought into force in water-finding.
Mr. Attree is an enthusiastic believer in the " rod," and objects to
the term " divining-rod " and " water-diviner," as he affirms there is no
guessing or divining or pretending practised by an honest water-
finder, the motion of the rod being due to some cause beyond the
control of the operator : he states that he has successfully made use of
the indications of the rod in finding " springs " for the benefit of his
friends and neighbours. Several of these instances are given by Mr.
Attree, and I have recently received some interesting additional
evidence of Mr. Attree's faculty as an amateur dowser.
The interest of this case is the additional illustration it affords (1)
of the involuntary muscular action that causes the motion of the
twig ; (2) of the accompanying peculiar sensation affirmed by so many
dowsers; (3) of insulation not affecting the motion; (4) of the im
plicit belief of the operator that whenever the rod twists the presence
of underground water must be indicated ; and (5) of the readiness with
which incredulity becomes credulity when something (such as the
twisting of the rod) happens contrary to the sceptic's expectation ;
the dowser's erroneous views about "springs" and " head of the
spring " being forthwith accepted without examination.

PART VII.
Miscellaneous Cases.
I will here add a few stray cases that do not come under the
previous classification. The following was kindly sent me by the
Right Hon. Sir Edward Fry, D.C.L., F.R.S, etc. To those who
imagine that dowsers are only employed by the credulous and
ignorant, this testimony, from one of the highest judicial authorities
in our country, who is also a man of science, is a sufficient reply.
Failand House, Bristol, October 13th, 1898.
I have sunk in four places for water near here. The first time was some
twenty-five years ago at Failand House Farm. There I was guided by Mr.
Lawrence, a well-known dowser, who lived somewhere in Gloucestershire.
I sank for water and got some, but subsequently, under Mr. Merry-
weather's advice,1 I deepened the well, and have now a very good supply,
which has shown no signs of failure even during the prolonged drought of
this year.
I sank a well about 20 ft. in Faulkner's garden—on my own selection
of the spot—got no water, and gave up the pursuit.
About six years ago I sank a well near this house, and got %vater at, I
think, 36 ft. This now supplies this house and the garden, stables, etc., etc.
The site was chosen by a dowser, who came over with my architect, Mr. Price,
of Weston-super-Mare.
I was not here either when Lawrence dowsed for the farm well, or Mr.
Price's friend for the well near this house, and know nothing in particular
about their proceedings.
I consulted Mr. Merryweather same years ago about sinking a well near
this house, and he dowsed and thought he could find a line of water, but I
did not act on that suggestion.
Last year, wanting to get a water supply for a farm (Lower Failand
Farm—Parson's) I again consulted Mr. Merryweather. He came with his
two sons, to one of whom he attributes the power of dowsing, and 1 went over
the ground with theni, and he ultimately advised me to drive a tunnel into
the hill. He did this work for me, and found water, though it has failed
during the long drought. I am not sure whether there is not a leak in the
tunnel.
There is no doubt a good deal of water in the hill on which all the land
in question lies, but how far it is to be found everywhere I cannot say.
I rather incline to the belief that the old red sandstone, which is the rock,
is traversed by faults or lines of weakness, and that down these the
water passes.
1 Mr. Merryweather is another dowser. See previous Report, p. 72. He died
recently.
xxxvm.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 227
In the search for water of last year Mr. Merryweather certainly did not
rely on the watch spring alone.1 He considered also indications of
water on the surface (from the character of the herbage) and the presence of
small springs or droppings of water in the rocky sides of the lane, from
which we drove the tunnel. He has been a well-sinker for years before he
took to dowsing, and would, I am sure, scout the notion that he should
neglect other indications of water. I may add that I have known him for
many years—that I have employed him not only as before mentioned, but
on other matters relating to drains, etc., and that 1 believe him to be a
thoroughly honest man. Edwaxd Fry
The fact mentioned by Sir Edward Fry that Merryweather is in
part intentionally guided by surface indications is very interesting.
This, however, is not usually the case with other dowsers, so far as I
know. The value of surface indications is referred to more fully in
another part of this paper. Sir Edward Fry also sends me the follow
ing extract from a volume called Memorials : Part II, Personal and
Political, by the Earl of Selborne, Vol. II., p. 384-5.
In a letter to his daughter, the Countess of Waldegrave, under date
September 25th, 1893, Lord Selborne writes, after referring to the effects
of the drought :—"Willie" (i.e., the present Earl of Selborne) "brought
a water-finder from Wiltshire to see if he could find near the reservoir any
underground water which could be used for increasing the supply there,
and he did find it as he said, but till this is verified by sinking to the neces
sary depth I shall suspend my belief, though the same man has been
successful in finding it at Hatfield and for Lord Jersey." To this a note is
added, " The divining rod proved successful."
There are, I believe, no professional dowsers in Ireland, though
English dowsers are in considerable request in certain parts of the
country, and there are a few amateur dowsers. The following case of
an amateur dowser, who is a farmer in the co. Tyrone, has lately
reached me through a friend : —
Mullantean, Stewartstown, October 17th, 1899.
The water-finder, William M'Crea, who lives near Stewartstown, was
here to-day, and found two springs for us. It is really wonderful the way
the rod turns in his hands ; it broke nearly in two, though it was a strong
piece of ash. He says he sleeps badly the night after he does much of it,
and at the time it feels as if the sinews of his arms were being torn out.
He first tried the rod about twenty years ago, when an uncle of -his came
from America, who had made a good deal of money there by finding springs,
so he tried if he had the power, and found he had. He can tell how far the
spring is down by counting the feet from where the rod begins to tremble
1 Mr. Merryweather, like the late Mr. Lawrence, always preferred to use a long
piece of flexible steel rather than a forked twig as an indicator, or "autoscope."—

until it turns over, —double that distance is generally right, but he won't
engage that, though he says in most of the wells sunk he has been right to
a foot or two. He has found a fine spring lately for the creamery at Moy,
and it has done well ever since. He can tell of no failure, so far, that he
has had. He is a man about fifty years of age, and has a good farm near
this, so ho does not do it for money. We will begin, I hope, to dig our well
soon, and I will let you know how it gets on. The spring, he asserts, begins
on a hill, and continues all down the field and up to the house, I suppose
400 yards or more, and that it could be tapped anywhere we choose.
C. M. Kennedy.
I have also received other cases where McCrea was successful, but
he dislikes using the rod, as he says "it seems to take such a lot out
of me."
Through the kindness of friends I have received some particulars
of the successful use of the rod for finding underground water by one
or two other amateur dowsers in Ireland, such as the late Mr. Thos.
Purvis, of Wexford, of whom Mr. J. Haughton, of Ferns, co. Wexford,
informs me that Mr. Purvis enabled his family to obtain a splendid
supply of water on their premises, " as abundant to-day as forty years
ago when the well was sunk."
Colonel King-Harman, of New Castle, Ballymahon, Ireland, is
another Irish amateur dowser, and in reply to my inquiries told me
that a former steward of his had been a successful dowser in America ;
Colonel King-Harman having kindly obtained the man's address,
I wrote to him and had the following reply in answer to my
questions :—
Whitfield Farm, Kilmeaden, Co. Waterford, October 30th, 1899.
My experience of the divining rod was in Manitoba, Canada. There the
rod proved successful every time but once, and I have every confidence
would have done so then, but we struck on a vein of sand, and tho well
would not hold out.
I dug one well where other twelve were dry, and this one had abundance
[of water] ; it was finished by Government. Other six wells I dug myself
out there, on the condition that if no water, no wage. All that I had to
guide me was the rod, and in all those places water was scarce.
I cannot give the addresses of all I dug for, but by writing to Mr.
Angus, postmaster, Logoch, Manitoba (for whom I dug the first well), you
can have the names of all the places.
I have tried the rod in Co. Waterford for Major Chavasse on very dry
hilly ground ; he has not yet dug.
I have no special feeling in my hands or body when the rod turns.
George Mitchell.
In Bibby's Quarterly (a farming journal) for November, 1897, is an
illustrated account of a Cornish dowser named George Williams, who
xxxvm.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 229
lives at Falmouth. It seems he accidentally discovered that the rod
moved in his hands, and was successful in tracing a lode by its means.
Subsequently he used it for water, and several cases of his success are
quoted. I wrote to the author of the article for further particulars,
and had the following reply : —
Rosvean, Falmouth, Cornwall, January 26th, 1898.
George Williams has recently found a spring for me in the country near
Falmouth. It was not where I had hoped or wanted, but his hazel rod
pointed where the spring was. I was present while he walked all over the
field. The work, he says, is always very exhausting to him. The spring, a
fine jet of water in the rock, was found 28 feet below the surface. No one
present knew anything about a watercourse there, and there was nothing to
suggest it.
The spring at the vicarage (built on the hill at Budock) was 70 feet below
the surface ; it was also found by Williams. Rtthaw F C v
In a subsequent letter Miss Gay tells me that in sinking her well,
a solid slaty rock was encountered and dynamite had to be used ; the
water, when reached at a depth of 28 ft. was so abundant that "even
through the drought of last summer it was never below 6 or 7 ft."
I visited Falmouth and saw the place where Williams found a
water supply for Miss Gay. It certainly seemed an unlikely spot, on
dry rocky ground between Budock and Penjerrick : the geological
formation is a clay slate (Devonian), near its junction with the
granite ; as Mr. Westlake remarks, " water tends to run off the
granite into the fissures of these slaty rocks, affording an excellent
testing ground for the dowser " ; here and there the water makes
its way to the surface as seen by certain " springs " marked on the
map not far distant. I had an interview with Williams ; he is a
working man, a mason, and, like other dowsers, has the most child
like faith in the indications of his " rod " : he showed me several
testimonials from gentlemen in Cornwall who spoke highly of his
services in finding water on their estates. But I had no opportunity
of making a personal investigation of any of these cases. Miss Gay
states that Williams has been engaged by the Great Western Railway
Company to " dowse " at Truro for water and that he has worked with
success for the Ecclesiastical Commissioners on various occasions.
Among the dowsers with whom I have had some correspondence is
Mr. H. A. Canning, who is a sanitary and hydraulic engineer at
Market Lavington, Wiltshire. Mr. Canning tells me that seeing a
dowser at work some twenty-five years ago he tried his hand, and
discovered that the forked twig " worked " equally well with him. He
encloses me a list of names of gentlemen for whom he has been
successful in finding water by the indication of the twig. In one case
230 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part
the twig moved at a spot between two wells 100 ft. apart, which gave
little or no water ; on sinking at the spot indicated, an abundant supply
was obtained. This may be so, but I have not verified the statements.
Mr. Canning, in a letter to the Standard in January, 1889, states that
upon finding the rod suddenly move at a certain spot he was then
blindfolded, and again on traversing the same spot the rod moved.
He adds there was an unmistakable but indescribable feeling upon
approaching the spot beneath which underground water existed, a
sensation that could not possibly be avoided, even though an effort was
made to do so. It is certainly a remarkable circumstance, whether
this sensation be illusory or not, that for 200 years the great majority
of dowsers in all parts of the world have quite independently asserted
the same thing, and as a rule believed that this peculiar sensation, or
malaise, existed only in their own case.
An interesting account of.an East Anglian dowser, Mr. Child,
recently appeared in the Eastern Daily Press. Mr. Child, who was
formerly in business in Norwich, now lives near Hadleigh in Suffolk,
and, like the majority of dowsers, was originally a Somersetshire man.
When living near Wells in Somerset he saw a dowser at work, and
was greatly astonished to find the rod twisted round in his own hand
at the same places. Several instances of his success are given in the
newspaper report referred to, but these I have not attempted to verify.
I have already mentioned a Cheddar dowser named Thomas
Pavey (p. 191 J.1 The son, Rowland Pavey, of Cheddar Mill, is also a
dowser, but has lately abandoned the use of the forked twig, and
trusts to what he calls a "New Science" in his water-finding ex
peditions. What this mysterious science is he does not tell the
public. I have had some correspondence with Pavey, and his letters
are full of rhodomontade. Though he will not tell me what his
wonderful secret is, he assures me it is " a science of sciences, and
to keep it secret is keeping hid a field of wonderful discoveries that
cannot be exhausted by scientists, as it is, I believe, the outcome
of a higher state of civilisation." (!) In a printed circular he sends
me he states that, though his science is in a crude state, yet the
" science of geology will be surpassed, the uplifting of mountains
and what lies hidden far beneath will be understood. There will
be no more secrets in water-finding, and the human body will be
understood as it never was before," beside a multitude of other
revelations, which he enumerates, ranging over the universe ! In
spite of all this nonsense, the Rev. H. H. Streeten, who writes to
1 F. H. Pavey, p. 234, another Cheddar dowser, is a connection of these Paveys.
xxxviii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 231
me from Easton Vicarage, near Wells, tells me, in answer to my
inquiries, that "Pavey certainly has a remarkable knowledge of the
earth. How he has acquired this knowledge is a different question,
but in localities he has never before visited he will in a short time
tell you where the springs of water are, and generally he will say
at what depth water is to be found underground. He is a quiet,
nice-minded man." Mr. Westlake, who has visited Pavey, says he
is a genuine enthusiast, with a firm belief in his " gift." The follow
ing report of an eye-witness describes how Pavey usually goes to
work in determining the depth at which water would be found under
ground. In this particular case—
He knelt down on one knee with his head resting on one hand, and gazed
downwards for about half-a-minute, afterwards giving it as his opinion that
it would be necessary to go down approximately 60 ft. As he predicted, a
good spring was struck within a few inches of the depth mentioned. The
supply is plentiful, as is evidenced by the fact that, after it had been left
during the night, three hours were occupied in getting sufficient water out
of the well to enable a commencement to be made in lining it with brick.
There is, however, no evidence to show he was not aware of the
depth of other local wells.
However striking some of these cases of the success of the dowser
may appear to the lay mind, to an expert field geologist, who knows
the district, the explanation is often simple enough. Here, for example,
is a case in point. Mrs. Hollands, of Dene Park, Tonbridge, kindly
sent me an account of the success which attended the dowser (Mr.
Gataker) at her place, but informed me they had not made any
previous attempts to find water, and adds :—
Dene Park, Tonbridge, October 17th, 1899.
We dug in two places, and found water about the depth he [the dowser]
told us—fifteen to twenty-five feet. Two of these wells are now most valu
able, in these long seasons of drought. Without them we should not have
enough water to supply the house at all. MmNIE HoLL4HD8-
Mr. Holmes, F.G.S., remarks on this case :—
At Dene Park, near Tonbridge, a gravel patch capping the Weald Clay
seems to have been tapped. I learn from Topley's Geological Survey
Memoir on the Weald (1875) that there are many outlying patches of gravel
at high levels in that district. Dene Park is rather more than two miles
north of Tonbridge. Gravel patches are mentioned (p. 185) as existing near
Starve Crow Farm (about half-a-mile south-east of the house at Dene Park)
and east of Little Park (about a quarter of a mile north of Dene Park). The
dowser would need simply a good eye for contours, as in the Oxford case.
T. V. H.
232 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part
In addition to the cases which I have already cited, I have before
me a number of other illustrations of the dowser's success in finding
water, and very often correctly estimating the depth at which it would
be found. In these cases, however, the replies I have received to my
inquiries have shown that no previous attempt to obtain a water
supply had been made, and several state that water would probably
have been found without the dowser's aid, only they wanted to "make
sure " before sinking a well. This correspondence has also shown
how misleading are many of the reports appearing in some of the
provincial newspapers. These reports doubtless give the dowser's own
version of the matter. To quote a typical instance, the Bath Chronicle,
which appears to be Mr. Gataker's favourite organ, contains two
misleading statements in its issue of October 22nd, 1896. One is as
follows :—
Another striking testimony to the ability of Mr. Leicester Gataker, the
water expert, of Bath, has just come to hand. In the face of much
scepticism he recently undertook to supply Mr. Smith Barry, M.P., Cor-
dangan Manor, near Tipperary, [with water] for the purposes of a dairy, on
special terms of "no water, no pay." He foreshadowed 300 gallons an
hour at from 25 to 35 ft. deep. On this he at once started his men to carry
out the sinking of the well. At a depth of 32 ft. a supply of 400 gallons
has been obtained as a result.
I wrote to the Right Hon. Smith Barry for information, and his
estate agent (Mr. G. C. Townsend) replies that " the results of Mr.
Gataker's work here have not been sufficiently successful to justify me
in giving you the information you ask."
The other statement, a few lines above in the same paper, is as
follows :—
Mr. G. Marshall, of Sarnesfield Court, Herefordshire, was getting pretty
well tired of well-sinking at the time he engaged the services of Mr.
Leicester Gataker, but his latest move has been most successful.
In reply to my inquiries Mr. Marshall states that he sunk no wells
before Mr. Gataker's visit, but simply made " catch-pits " to collect
surface water. In further correspondence Mr. Marshall informs me :—
Heralds' College, London, E.C., October IQik, 1899.
In reply to your questions—
1 and 2. Before Mr. Gataker found water for me at Sarnesfield I had
built a large tank and attempted to collect surface water, which failed me in
a dry season.
3. Mr. Gataker came and indicated two spots within a short distance of
my tank, telling the number of feet to sink the wells and the amount of
water I should find. His estimate was perfectly correct, and since I have
had the wells sunk I have had a most satisfactory supply. The late dry
summer has been a severe test, but there has been a full supply of water,
xxxviii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 233
■
and I have no reason to believe there will ever be otherwise. It is curious
how many people appear to have the power of water finding did they know
how to use it. Several of us tried when Mr. Gataker was at Sarnesfield, and
when he placed a twig in their hands it moved, but with myself, although
Mr. Gataker gripped me firmly by the wrists, there was no movement.
George W. Marshall.
Sarnesfield is near Weobley, about ten miles north-west of Hereford.
I asked Mr. Marshall what was the need of a dowser, as probably
surface water would be found anywhere in shallow wells at Sarnesfield.
He replies :—
Heralds' College, London, E.C., October 19th, 1899.
Of course, on a soil like ours at Sarnesfield, which is on stone, you can
get water anywhere when you get down to the rock ; but the point which
shows Gataker's skill is that being told whereabouts (a mile and a half from
my house) I wanted water found, he fixed the spots to sink the wells, and
told accurately the depth to go and the quantity of water which would be
George W. Marshall.
Mr. Holmes remarks :—
The Gataker cases are an excellent illustration—as you remark—of the
deceitfulness of newspaper reports. Mr. Marshall's second letter reduces
very considerably the atmosphere of wonder enveloping the first.
T. V. H.
Much of the wonder which the dowser creates, in the unscientific
mind, arises from the notion which he invariably fosters that under
ground water is found in narrow streams or " springs," and that
without his aid in hitting upon the exact spot where to sink a well,
the chances are you would have missed the water altogether. It is
true that in certain districts the geological formation causes under
ground water to be found in fissures or narrow streams, and there, as
I have said before, the real test of the dowser is to be found. Such a
formation prevails in the county of Somerset, as Mr. Westlake has
shown in his instructive Appendix (p. 315). In the next Part, I
have cited some failures of dowsers and the probable percentage of
successes they obtain. It must, however, be clearly understood that
neither in this Report, nor in the previous one, have I selected favour
able cases and omitted others which were adverse. Every case that
has reached me has, as far as possible, been investigated, either by
correspondence with the person who employed the dowser, or by a visit
to the spot by my geological friends.

PART VIII.
Professional Dowsers in England and "Wales and their
Probable Percentage of Failures.
§ 1. List of Dowsers and Hints as to their Employment.
It may be convenient in concluding this part of our work, to
append a list of professional dowsers in England and Wales. The
stronghold of the dowser is to be found in those districts where the
geological formation renders it difficult to discern underground sources
of water, such, for example, as in the Lower Lias and amid the lime
stone regions of Somerset and Gloucestershire and in the South of
France. In and around Cheddar there are numerous professional
dowsers ; to some of these I have already referred. With the help
of Mr. Westlake I have drawn up the following list of professional
dowsers now living in England and Wales. No doubt there are
several others of whom I have not heard, and there are, of course, in
addition numbers of amateur dowsers, some of whom have been
remarkably successful. It will be noticed that even in this im
perfect list no less than eighteen professional dowsers are found in
Somersetshire, more than half the total ; and several who now live
elsewhere, such as Mr. Child and Mr. Stears, originally came from
Somersetshire.

It may not be out of place in this connection to give one or two
practical hints to those who intend to employ a dowser, or " diviner,"
as they usually like to be called.
(1) Ascertain the geological conditions of the place where a water-
supply is wanted : in numerous cases where a water-finder is employed
his advice is wholly unnecessary (see Appendix A. and also B.).
1 Since the above list was printed I have been informed that Mr. Wyburn (a
member of the Society of Friends) takes no fee, therefore he can hardly be reckoned
among professional dowsers. The list of Somerset dowsers might no doubt be easily
extended by further inquiry, t.g., George Elson, labourer at North Perroth, p. 205.
236 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part
(2) If a large supply is wanted and a deep artesian well or boring
to be made eschew all dowsers and consult a good hydro-geologist.1
(3) If only a moderate supply is required, —-especially in certain
formations where geology is of little help,—select a couple of dowsers
of good repute, and let each give his opinion unknown to and inde
pendently of the other.2
(4) As the best dowsers I know have been more or less illiterate
men, their loss of time would be amply repaid by offering them a
moderate fee and travelling expenses.
(5) If the water-finder is willing to sink or bore on the faith of his
opinion, obtain his estimate, and if found to be reasonable, offer him
so much per cent, extra on the condition of " no water no pay," taking
care to have a written agreement as to the limit of expense involved.8
What this extra percentage should be depends on the geological con
ditions. Taking the country indiscriminately, 15 per cent, would
probably be reasonable, but if "fissure water" (see p. 341) pre
dominates, and moreover, if geological advice has already been sought
and on trial has proved a failure, an extra rate of 25 per cent. is not
unreasonable, if a certain supply be stipulated for.
§ 2. Recent Cases of Complete or Partial Failure in Water-Finding
by English Dowsers.
Though nearly every professional dowser thinks he can be no more
mistaken in trusting to the twisting of his rod for the indication of
underground water, than a magnet can be mistaken in its selective
attraction of iron, yet it is hardly necessary to say the dowser is by no
means free from mistakes. He has his failures, sometimes costly
failures to those who employ him. Several of his failures I detailed
1 Mr. Westlake, F.G.S., in reference to this adds the following note:— "Even
where deep wells are necessary, experience has shown it is sometimes advantageous
to supplement geological advice by calling in a dowser, for, though a definite water
level may exist, the quantity found at a given spot is often a matter of chance : such
a case I saw recently near Newbury, where the dowser, Tompkins, had found, at a
depth of over 100 ft. in the chalk, so large a supply that steam pumping-gear had to
be used, whereas in two or three other wells in the neighbourhood, with water at
about the same hydrostatic level, the quantity was much less. It is difficult, how
ever, to say how far chance coincidence may account for such lucky hits."
2 On the question of independent exammation by different dowsers, see Part IV.,
and also the last sentence but one in Professor de Mortillet's letter, p. 244.
3 The reason for this will be seen in the next few pages. The dowser will usually
make a rough estimate of the quantity of water likely to be found and the depth at
which it exists ; with some dowsers this estimate is often wonderfully close, with
others it is as often wrong. It is desirable, therefore, to bear this in mind and also
that the quantity of water yielded by all shallow wells varies largely with the season
of the year.
xxxviil] On the So-called Divining Rod. 237
in the previous Report, and I will here cite a few more that I have
since met with ; others of course exist that I have not heard of. But
whilst I have been obliged to omit numerous instances of the dowsers'
success which were of no evidential value, I have not omitted any of
their failures which were verified upon inquiry ; meaning by failure,
complete disappointment of the expectations raised by the water-finder.
As I have quoted an instance of Mr. Gataker's success at Aspley
Heath, p. 185, here is an instance of his failure in the same neighbour
hood. It is contained in a letter to Mr. Myers from a friend of his
—the daughter of a former Professor at Cambridge—-who writes most
indignantly, and states that Mr. Gataker's predictions were not in any
way fulfilled. The place is at Woburn Sands, and it seems that before
Gataker's visit a well had been dug about 70 ft. deep in the Oxford
clay without finding water. When Mr. Gataker came, he fixed upon a
spot where he said a large water supply would be obtained—at what
depth is not stated. A well was dug and only a little water obtained,
even when headings were driven radiating from the sides of the well.
The writer of the letter suggests that the investigation of every
dowser should be confined to the question of whether " he ever made a
mistake, for if water were not found in the place and at the depth
predicted by the diviner, I should consider him an impostor." I am
afraid this " short way " with dowsers would not carry the investigation
very far. The writer concludes by expressing a wish to write to the
Spectator " on the wickedness of diviners and the extraordinary folly
and credulousness of educated persons in believing in them."
Other dowsers besides Mr. Gataker have their share of failures, in
spite of all their attempts to explain them away. Here is a case of the
discomfiture of another dowser, related in detail in the Daily Mail for
December 28th, 1897. It seems that a member of the Legislative
Council of Jamaica, whilst on a visit to England, engaged the services
of a "diviner" to locate the site for wells in a district in Jamaica
which had suffered greatly from the neod of a water supply. Handsome
terms were offered by five parochial boards in Jamaica to the water-
finder, who on his arrival in their neighbourhood was received with
enthusiasm, and very soon, by means of his rod, pointed out several
places where water would be found.
At Mandeville, a charming village in the hills, he pegged out part of the
course of a subterranean stream and retired to lunch at a neighbouring
hotel. In his absence some wags removed his pegs and lined out a totally
different course. On his return the diviner took up the new direction and
continued it for over a hundred yards more, and did not discover his
mistake until one of his admirers pointed out the deception. But no
borings for water had yet been made, and the authoritative statements
of the diviner were unchallenged. At length the necessary implements
238 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part
were obtained, and an attempt was made at several points to reach the
water so confidently indicated. At one point where water was predicted as
at a depth of 40 ft., a boring of 150 ft. was made, with the only result that
no water could be found, the machinery eventually broke down, and after
going down about 200 ft., the borer could not be extracted. The same
ridiculous result occurred in other places, and up to the present at none of
the points indicated by the diviner has water been found.
Like all other newspaper reports, this needs confirmation, but it is
no doubt fairly correct. In 1897, Mr. Stears informed me he had entered
into a contract to dowse for water in Jamaica, and he no doubt was
the unfortunate dowser employed. Nor is this the only costly failure
he, as well as some other dowsers, have had.
In the previous Report (p. 173) I gave some details of a failure on
the part of Mr. Stears which led the Parish Council of Bardney,
Lincolnshire, to a very heavy and useless expenditure. At a spot in
dicated by the dowser they bored to a great depth and found no water.
I have since heard from Mr. Hind, the Clerk to the District Council,
who informs me they continued boring to a depth of 450 ft., at a cost
of £300, and found no water. The bore-hole then caved in. Bardney
is about ten miles east of Lincoln.
As I have pointed out again and again, whatever success attends the
dowser is mainly due to his discovery of a moderate water supply yielded
by comparatively shallow borings or wells, i.e., from 15 to 50 ft. deep
(see previous Report, Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. XIII., pp. 235, 240, etc.).
Hence it is a great pity that District and County Councils, when they
want a large water supply, do not consult a good hydro-geologist.
Mr. C. E. de Ranee, F.G.S., one of the best authorities on water
supply, published in 1891 an admirable paper on The Underground
Waters of Lincolnshire, which I recommend to the Bardney District
Council. They will find in it a record of deep borings not far from
their own town.
Another case, more or less a failure, in which Mr. Stone was the
dowser, has reached me from Messrs. Attenborough and Timms, of
Northampton. They had originally sunk and bored to a depth of
70 ft. at Dassett Sidings, near Burton (between Fenny Compton and
Kineton railway stations), and found no water. Mr. Stone was then
engaged, and with his rod fixed on a place 125 yds. distant where
he stated water would be found: "a sufficient supply, he thought,
would be reached at 90 ft., but the exact depth he could not say."
Here Messrs. Attenborough bored to a depth of over 100 ft. ; near
the surface, as Stone had said, a little water was met with, but on
testing with an artesian pump at the greater depth, " the result was
unsuccessful," and in a recent letter to me (June, 1900) Messrs.
Attenborough state : " We spent a great deal more money than we
xxxviii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 239
were given to understand would be necessary, and, seeing no prospect
of success, stopped the work after boring to over 100 ft."
Many of the professional dowsers undertake the work of sinking
or boring for water at the spot they have selected, and, as in the
above case, frequent disputes arise from this cause, the dowser wanting
to go on boring, at his customer's expense, when he fails to obtain an
adequate supply of water at or beyond the depth he estimated. It is
necessary, therefore, to warn all those who intend employing a dowser
as well-sinker to make a definite arrangement beforehand, such as I
have suggested on p. 236.
Mr. Westlake, in the course of his investigations in the south-west
of England, heard of some half-dozen cases of expensive failures on
the part of the dowsers there employed ; particulars of these cases
and the names of the dowsers have not yet reached me. Mr. Gordon
Harris, A.M. Inst. C.E., in a useful paper on "Water Supply to
Country Mansions," read before the United Service Institution on
December 4th, 1899, after referring to dowsing for water and my
previous Report on this subject, mentions a case where a dowser
predicted a water supply at 160 ft. depth on an estate in Hertford
shire. Mr. Harris, being consulted, showed that as the London clay
had here to be pierced to reach the chalk, no water could be found
under 200 ft. ; a boring was made at the spot and geology triumphed.
Mr. T. V. Holmes, F.G.S., in his excellent paper on the Divining
Rod published in the Journal of the Anthropological Institute for
November, 1897, to which I have already referred, mentions three or
four cases where dowsers had partially or completely failed ; two of
these I referred to in the previous Report (p. 236),—(1) one was when
Mr. Tompkins was employed at Porthcawl in Glamorganshire ; the
geological formation at this place is, I find, some 15 to 20 ft. of red
marl and shale, resting on a deep bed of Triassic Conglomerate ; (2)
the other case was at Ampthill in Bedfordshire, where 10 to 20 ft. of
the lower Greensand rest on a bed of Jurassic clay over 500 ft. thick.
In both these cases, as might be expected geologically, a small supply
of water was found not far below the surface, and no increased supply
after boring to a much greater depth.
These two partial failures are of considerable public interest, as the
dowsers were in each case engaged by the respective District Councils,
and the costs incurred were disallowed by the auditors to the Local
Government Board. In reporting the case the local newspapers state
that :—
Mr. W. A. Casson, the Local Government Board auditor, in giving his
decision, quoted Professor Barrett, who had written a monograph " On the
So-called Divining Rod," which was published in the Proceedings of the
Society for Psychical Research. Though apparently strongly biassed in
240 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part
favour of diviners, Professor Barrett admitted that their general ideas of
water were absurd, as they imagined springs to exist like buried treasure,
located to an area of a few square inches, or as underground rivers which
they professed to trace within an inch on either side. He (Mr. Casson)
regarded divination as a survival from times when magic and witchcraft were
generally believed in.
Like many others, Mr. Casson was misled by the name divining
rod ; he should, however, be more careful in his official utterances ; if
he had read my report, he could hardly have made the foolish statement
that I was "strongly biassed"; a judge or a jury are not said to be
biassed when they arrive at a decision after patiently hearing the
evidence on both sides that has been brought before them.
The reason assigned by the auditors for their decision was that the
diviners made a pretence of claiming some supernatural power in
finding underground water (this is a mistake ; no dowsers claim such
power ; " abnormal " is meant), and it was stated the judges had laid
down that
" the pretence of a power, whether moral, physical, or supernatural, with
intent to obtain money, was sufficient to constitute an offence within the
meaning of the law."
The fees charged by the dowsers were therefore illegal, as they
could not be recovered in a court of law. In addition, the Porthcawl
auditor surcharged the District Council with the expenditure on the
boring, amounting to over £500.1 Throughout England and Wales
the public interest excited in the matter was great. I received nearly
100 cuttings from various newspapers relating to the subject ; the
editors for the most part lamenting the benighted and superstitious
practices of the Porthcawl and Ampthill councillors. " It is im
possible," said the Leeds Mercury in reference to this case, " to
plumb the depths of human credulity."2 But the surcharged Councils
appealed, and ultimately, in answer to a question in the House of
Commons, on August 7th, 1899, the President of the Local Govern
ment Board, the Right Hon. J. Chaplin, upset many beliefs by stating
that the appeals were allowed and the auditors' decisions reversed,
" the Board having been advised by their own legal adviser that the
reasons assigned by the auditors for making the disallowances did
not support the action they took in point of law." Hence, after
1 Subsequently, the auditor must have amended his decision in respect to this, for
according to Mr. Chaplin's statement in the House of Commons, the only sums
disallowed were the small amounts for the diviner's fees. The best accounts of the
Porthcawl case will be found in the lengthy reports in the Cardiff Western Mail for
July 20th, 1897. el acq. The Ampthill case will be found fully reported in the Bedford
Times for June 5th, 1897, ct »tq.
2 A few exceptions to this general outcry were to be found in some journals,
notably Truth, the Eeening Standard, and the Local Goeernment Journal.

this, Urban and Rural District Councils are left free to employ any
competent water-tinder they choose to select, whatever method he may
employ. This is surely a wise decision, founded, I expect, less upon
legal views than upon the experience which Mr. Chaplin and other
members of the Government have had of the usefulness of dowsers
on their own estates.
$ 3. Percentage of Failures.
This leads on to the question of the percentage of failures of different
dowsers. I have tried to obtain from some of the professional " water-
finders " a record of all the places they have visited in the course of say
twelve months, so that by inquiry at each place I might ascertain the
number of successes and of failures. But it is impossible to know if
the record sent is a complete one. I have received from two dowsers a
long list of persons and places, and have written to each person named
with the result that all these cases were more or less successful, but the
failures are just the ones that are not likely to be sent. Mr. Gataker
frankly says in a letter to me that he has had occasional failures, which
he cannot account for except by his state of health. The dowser very
often explains away a failure by saying the depth is merely greater and
the quantity of water less than he predicted, but all depends upon how
much greater depth or how much less water. It would be much better
if each dowser would keep a faithful record of all his engagements, and
then take the public into his confidence, and give the results of his
work and references to each of his employers. This, I suppose, we
can hardly expect in the present state of human nature.
An estimate of the number of failures on the part of professional
dowsers may perhaps be obtained from the extra charge some of them
make when sinking wells on the " no water, no pay " system. That is
to say, they agree to sink a well for a certain sum at the spot they
have selected by the rod, and if water is not found at the place they
predicted, and in about the quantity they estimated, then no charge is
made ; the loss falls on the dowser. If however, all turns out satis
factorily, a somewhat higher charge is made for sinking the well than
an ordinary well-sinker would charge, or if no guarantee be given by
the dowser. This extra charge varies with different dowsers, and is of
course their insurance against failure; it expresses, however, something
irvrre than the percentage of absolute failures, for water may be found,
but the supply may be insufficient, or the depth may be greater than
was allowed for in the contract.
I have inquired what this extra charge is, and, as might be ex
pected, it varies. Mr. Gataker makes an additional charge of 25 per
cent. on the " no water no pay " system ; a similar additional rate is, I
T
242 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part
understand, charged by Mr. Chesterman ; l Mr. Tompkins in reply to
my inquiry, says: "25 to 30 per cent. extra would cover the risk"; Mr.
Stone says he does not work on that system, but would be willing to
undertake work on the terms of only charging out of pocket expenses,
in addition to his fee, if water is not found.2 The late John Mullins
(see p. 75 of my previous Report) made no extra charge, and (as a rule)
was willing to forego all payments if after sinking the well a sufficient
supply of water was not found. His sons, who carry on the business,
and one of whom is a dowser (see p. 98 of last Report), inform me "we
do not generally make any extra charge for giving a guarantee of find
ing water ; on three occasions only we charged 15 per cent, extra on the
contract for making the well." They enclose me copies of some of their
contracts for large amounts; several of these, I notice, contain the clause
"in the event of not obtaining a supply of 1,000 gallons per day of
twenty-four hours, we will make no charge for the work done." But a
thousand gallons per day is a very small supply for expensive operations,
and contaminated surface water might easily yield this amount.
I am inclined to think we may take from 10 to 15 per cent, as
the average percentage of failures which occur with most English
dowsers of to-day, allowing a larger percentage for partial failures,
meaning by this that the quantity of water estimated and the
depth at which it is found have not realised the estimate formed
by the dowser. This latter, however, though of great practical
importance, is foreign to our inquiry, for what we want to know is
whether, after making every allowance for shrewdness of eye, chance
coincidence, and local or geological knowledge, the dowser has any
instinctive or supernormal power of discovering the presence of under
ground water. The answer to this question is to be found by a study
of the cases cited in this and the previous Report, and is discussed in
a subsequent Part (p. 303). Here I will only add that the reader
who has followed me will have seen how absurd is the dowser's notion
that the mere twisting of his forked twig is an infallible indication of
underground water. As I have already shown (Vol. XIII., p. 253),
the movement of the twig is due to a sub-conscious suggestion, and
this may arise from many causes besides the assumed influence of
underground water on the dowser.
1 In a recent contract between the District Council at East Knoyle and the
dowser, Chesterman, so many gallons per twenty-four hours were stipulated for, and
a certain depth not to be exceeded. The contract was taken at ordinary ratei',
Chesterman to receive 25 per cent. extra if he succeeds and to pay all if he fails : as
the District Council have, I understand, already lost £150 over a well sunk upon
geological advice, they have made a good bargain.
2 This is a most unsatisfactory arrangement, for the dowser, being the contractor,
makes himself the judge of what is an adequate supply of water and what the depth
of the boring should be. I have heard some complaints of Mr. Stone in this respect.

PART IX.
Continental, Colonial, and Californian Cases of the Use of the
Rod in the Search for Underground Water.
§ 1. Continental Dowsers.
In the previous Report, on p. 23, I mentioned that a French writer
had published in 1850 a little book called Hixtoire de VHydroscopie et
de la Baguette Divinatoire, and I spoke of the author, who was in
early life a successful and, I believe, professional dowser, as "a M.
Mortillet." I was unaware at the time that the author was the same
person as Professor Gabriel de Mortillet, who has a European reputa
tion, and is one of the most distinguished anthropologists in France.
I therefore owe an apology to Professor de Mortillet, and expressed
this in sending him a copy of the Report. It is often remarked
that it would be of great value if a competent scientific man were
also a dowser, and could give us his personal experience. Here we
have a case in point, and to this may be added the case of Mr.
Enys, F.G.S., the President of the Royal Geological Society of Corn
wall, a letter from whom is quoted on p. 219. Professor de Mortillet's
little book is not now accessible ; the author, in reply to my inquiries,
writes to me as follows :—
St. Germain-en-Laye, pres Paris, 18 Decembre, 1897.
Je regrette beaucoup de ne pas pouvoir vous envoyer mon HLstoire de

As the summary Professor de Mortillet gives of his views on the
baguette is of general interest, I append the following translation of the
communication he refers to in L'A/as, February, 1S96 :—
The name "hydroscope " has been given to those persons who experience
certain special sensations on passing over subterranean watercourses.
Sometimes, though very rarely, the sensation is sufficiently strong fur the
subject to be directly conscious of it. In most cases hydroscopes are
compelled to use an instrument in order to recognise the fact. The instrument
employed is either a pendulum (pendule) or a rod. The pendulum is carried
in the hand, so that the least trembling of the arm sets it in motion. As to
the rod, it is a twig slightly bent, which the operator rests upon the index
fingers of each hand so as to balance it. The least motion of the fingers
towards or away from each other is then sufficient to displace the centre
of gravity, which, passing from the centre of the rod towards the ends,
and from the ends towards the centre, naturally causes the rod to turn. But
this is not the true divining rod. This last is a stem, dividing into two
branches nearly of equal size, and forming as acute an angle as possible.
The end of a branch is grasped in each hand, and it is bent back in such a
manner as to be in tension (resisting the pressure of the hand). These
recurved and bent branches endeavour to spring back to their original
straight line, which causes their point of union to move. To use this rod,
an equilibrium as unstable as possible is set up, so that it may be disturbed
by the least nervous jar, which will cause the instrument to move Such are
the principles governing the pendulum and the rod. The nature of the
wood is a matter of indifference. Hazel is preferred, because it forks more
frequently, and the rods are more flexible than is the case with other trees.
Pendulums and rods move over certain points in the hands of persons
who are especially sensitive. These points are supposed to be over under
ground watercourses. As a matter of fact, this is generally, but not always,
the case. I have seen important works undertaken merely upon indications
furnished by hydroscopy, with full success. But, at other times, I have seen
it fail.
This much, however, is certain, which I can affirm as the result of
experience, that the point chosen by one diviner will also be chosen by
others brought from a distance, and completely ignorant of the preceding
experiments. A real phenomenon to study does therefore exist.
What has discredited this phenomenon is the attempt to employ it in
moral matters, such as the search for robbers, assassins, etc.
I would call special attention to the penultimate paragraph, as
expressing the opinion of a distinguished man of science who knows
what he is talking about.
It will be noticed that Professor de Mortillet refers to the use of a
pendule as well as a baguette.1 The former is not, I believe, anywhere
1 I have referred to the so-called pendule cxploratiur in the previous Report,
p. 10. It consists simply of a ring or little ball, suspended by a thread which is held
between the fingera, and, thus held, the involuntary motion of the hand sets it

employed by dowsers in England, but it is in use in some parts of
America, and is described in an article in an American journal, the
Democratic Review for 1850 The writer calls himself " An Old Rods-
man," and states that some diviners in searching for metals use a
forked twig, or two pieces of whalebone, and others a "small metallic
ball suspended by a horse-hair or silk thread As the operator
approaches the hidden mine, the ball deviates more or less from the
perpendicular, and this points out the proximity of the object sought."
A very similar pendule is referred to in the next case, as employed by
some French sourciers, or water tinders. These sourciers, lam informed
by those in the South of France to whom I have written, are to be
found in Dauphine, Savoie, and Beaujolais, but in smaller numbers
than formerly. A friend in France writes as follows :—
Lyons, July 2nd, 1898.
M. Raoul de Cazenove (a relative of Demi Cazenove) lately built himself
a chateau, and after all was finished, found he had everything heart could
desire except water. He knew of an old fanner reputed as a "sourcier,"
and went to him. He consented to come, but as he expressed it, "for
love, not for money, as I never intended doing it again ; it exhausts me so
terribly." He came, found, and was exhausted, so much so that they ha 1
much ado to fit him for returning home.
I wrote to M. de Cazenove, who kindly sent me the following
particulars :—
Chateau du Sober, La Salle, Gard, July Uih, 1898.
I am happy to send you the few particulars I possess on the subject.
Answering your two questions, I may say, 1st, since thirty years or so, I
have had on many occasions to ask the "sourciers' " services. I have asked
their help fourteen times ; their researches have been successful in nine cases.
Our country is very irregular, abrupt anil rocky ; so no wells have been
bored. Water is to be found in digging horizontal galleries ; most of these
go from twenty to one hundred metres [about 66 to 330 ft. "J; many are bored
in granite ; some others in "calcaire" [limestone].
2nd. When I have observed the "sourcier" at work he feels a particular
sensation, or malaise, which increases as he approaches the hidden water.
Some use a rod ; many of them a heavy watch, hanging by its chain ; some
of them don't use any instrument. We have a lot of "sourciers " in the
country (mountains of the Cevennes) ; some of them are amateurs, many are
professionals. Their estimation of the depth and volume of water is quite
empirical ; hence mistakes and frequent deceptions result. Sometimes their
oscillating and appears to endow the pcndule with a sort of intelligent activity. A
considerable literature has arisen over the pendule, a toy which afresh excites the
ast nishment of succeeding generations. It is really a simple form of "autoscope,"
and can claim a remote antiquity, divination by an oscillating ring or pcndult having
been used by the ancients ; it was employed by Hilarius in the 4th century to ascer
tain who would be the successor to Valens ; Chevreul, in his Baguette Divinatoire,
pp. 132 et >eq., gives the whole passage.
246 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part
long experience furnishes them with sufficient indications, but they have no
rules ; only personal and nervous feeling.
Many professional "sourciers" exist in France in various parts. I
remain at your disposition for further inquiries.
R. de Cazenove.
Continental " Hydroscopes " in the Early Part of the Century.
One of the most successful water-finders in the early part of the
19th century was the French Abbe" Paramelle; he did not employ a rod,
but trusted to his instinct, guided by a knowledge of hydro-geology
which he had gained through careful observation. I have devoted an
Appendix to Paramelle (see p. 352), as his case forms an instructive
contribution to our research.
The subject of Continental dowsers would be incomplete without
reference to the writings of Thouvenel, Amoretti, Count Tristan and
Baron Du Prel. Dr. Thouvenel I have already referred to, and his
experiments with the dowser Bleton are given in the next Part.
Thouvenel, towards the close of the 18th century, went to Italy and
there experimented with another dowser, or " hydroscope," a lad
named Pennet,1 who professed to find buried metals and coal, as well
as underground water. Some of the results were so surprising that
the great naturalist, Spallanzani, was much impressed, but as Pennet
was, according to a letter published by Biot,2 subsequently found
tricking at Florence, Spallanzani concluded he also had been tricked
and withdrew his former opinion. I do not know whether Biot had
reliable evidence for his statement, for we all know that with many
sceptics any evidence is thought good enough, if it serves to discredit
phenomena new to science.
Amoretti, who was an Italian savant of some note, published
various papers on his experiments with the Divining Rod, chiefly with
two dowsers, one the lad Pennet, and the other, a boy, Anfossi.3
In Vol. XIX. of the Opuscoli Scelti, Amoretti, in a letter to Fortis,
1 See an article by Dr. Thouvenel in Melanges d'histoire natnrclh de physique,
etc., Vol. III., Paris, 1807.
2 Reprinted in 1858 in his Melanges scientifiques et litttraires, tom. II., p. 80.
In the Bibliography of the Divining Rod, which Mr. Westlake has with each
immense industry prepared, numbers of papers in French, Italian, and German will
be found between 1800 and 1810, arising out of Dr. Thouvenel's investigations.
3 Amoretti's papers on the divining rod, in the British Museum, are mainly found
in the Soc. Ital. dellc Scitnzt for 1813 and 1816, and earlier papers in the Opuscoli Scclti
suite Scicnze from 1 7'J8 to 1804. The later papers were published separately under
the title of Delta Rabdornanzia ossia EUttrmiwtria animate. Part I. of this book was
translated into German, and a paper on the same Hubject by J. W. Ritter added,
with plates showing various rods held both by hands and feet. Some of Amoretti's
papers were also translated into French and published in Fortis' Mimoires.
xxxviii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 247
dated December, 1796, states : (1) That an Augustinian friar had, by
means of the rod, found an underground spring, which had since
supplied the country house of Signor Dolbecchi ; (2) that one Sanzio,
a surgeon, found his pulse rose twelve to fifteen beats faster per
minute when standing over subterranean water ; (3) that an insen
sitive person holding a divining rod became sensitive and the rod
moved, when his hands were held by a sensitive [i.e., a dowser] ; (4)
particulars are given of a sensitive (a boy) who could locate under
ground water by his feelings, without using a rod : Pennet and
Anfossi (other sensitives) also said the same. Amoretti, like Pro
fessor Sementini, Ritter, and others, believed in the close connection
of electricity with the movement of the rod. The Count de Tristan
was likewise fully convinced of the electric origin of the dowsing
faculty; his knowledge of physics was, however, very slight. In 1826
he published the result of numerous experiments with the divining
rod in the valley of the Loire in a book called Recherches sur quelques
ejfluves terrestres. An outline of these experiments is given by Dr.
Mayo, F.R.S., in his excellent book, Truths Contained in Popular
Superstitions, and by Chevreul in his Baguette Divinatoire, pp. 122
et seq.
The influence of " suggestion," whether conscious or unconscious,
was not considered nor guarded against by any of these experimenters,
nor was the effect of involuntary muscular action sufficiently recog
nised till later. Hence Amoretti, Ritter, Tristan, and very often
Thouvenel, were led to attribute to animal electricity phenomena that
were mainly due to suggestion. Thousands of experiments have been
made and volumes written on the divining rod and the pemlule (or
magic pendulum), all of which are valueless owing to the non-
recognition of this source of error ; I will, however, return to this
later on.
In the autobiography of that learned and singular man, Zschokke,
an account is given on p. 143, of several dowsers (or Rhabdomantins,
as Zschokke calls them) whom he had met in Switzerland ; they are
to be found, he states, in almost every canton. Dr. Ebel, of Zurich,
a well-known geologist, sent Zschokke one of these dowsers to test ;
he adds that the Abbot of St. Urban, in Lucerne, was a successful
dowser. Zschokke was at first very incredulous, but his incredulity
disappeared after the numerous tests to which he subjected a young
female dowser.
The German Dowser, Beraz.
Du Prel, who is best known by his suggestive work, Die Philosophic
der Mystik (admirably translated into English by Mr. C. C. Massey),
published a short essay on the Divining Rod {Die Wiinschelruthe) in
248 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part
1890. In this essay Du Prel gives an account of Beraz, a notable
German dowser. The following is a translation of this part :—
[In 1888] a friend in the South asked me to call upon Beraz, the spring-
finder (who is since dead, but who lived at that time in Munich), and to
make arrangements with him. It was necessary to find springs in a newly
laid out health resort, which was unprovided with a water supply. My
friend gave me (the quite unnecessary) advice, not to consult any learned
professors, etc., on the subject of Beraz. I visited Beraz, and while waiting
for his appearance, noticed—amongst others—the portrait of a gentleman
hanging in the room. This gentleman, Beraz informed me, was his maternal
grandfather, Professor Ritter ; I naturally asked whether he were the
author of the Siderixmus, and was answered in the affirmative.1 The
testimonials that Beraz received are sufficient testimony to his powers As
the subject is one of great interest to the public generally, and to land-
proprietors especially, I give a few dates of the finding of springs, with the
places at which they were found, and addresses at which any one interested
may obtain full proof for the asking :—The Capuchin Monastery on St.
Nicholas-berg in the Wurzburg (1877) ; the Corporation of Gart, near
Traunstein (1876) ; the Institute of Young Ladies at Altotting (1882) ;
Narr's Brewery in Zirndorf, near Nurnberg (1875), the Community of
Algund, near Meran (1882).
I have conversed with a person who witnessed one of Beraz's experiments
on an occasion when he announced that there was a spring at a depth of
80 ft., and the spring was found at 83 ft. I do not doubt but that Beraz was
sometimes unsuccessful, but, ou the other hand, I am sure that many an
enlightened corporation has lavished great sums on bringing water to thoir
towns, which they might have obtained much more reasonably by employing
a spring-finder.
In the London Times for February 11th, 1885, I find the following
account of water-finding by Beraz in Bavaria :—
The Allgemeine Zeitung gives some interesting particulars of remarkable
success in indicating the presence of water springs on the part of a man
named Beraz, who seems to be a recognised authority in such matters. The
scene of his performances was in the Bavarian highlands, at a height of
more than 1,300 ft. above the level of the sea. The commune of Rothen-
berg, near Hirschhorn, suffered greatly from want of water, and invited
Beraz last autumn to endeavour to find some source of supply for them. He
inspected the locality one afternoon in presence of the public authorities
and a reporter of the Allgemeine Zeitung, and announced that water was to
be found in certain spots at depths which he stated. The first spot was in the
lower village, and he gave the likely depth at between 62 ft. and 72 ft., adding
that the volume of water which the spring would give would be of about the
diameter of an inch and a quarter. After incessant labour for four weeks,
1 Ritter's Sidcrismua, Du Prel remarks in another place, had lain uncut in the
Public Library of Munich from 1808 to 1887, apropos of which he adds very truly
" the scepticism of many is merely ignorance." Ritter conducted some investigations
on the divining rod in Munich in 1806, with an Italian named Campetti.—W. F.B.
xxxviii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 249
consisting mainly of rook blasting, the workmen came on a copious spring
of water at a depth of almost 67 ft. What he declared about a water source
for the upper village was very singular. He pointed to a spot where he
said three watercourses lay perpendicularly under one another, and running
in parallel courses. The first would be found at a depth of between 22i ft.
and 26 ft. of about the size of a wheaten straw, and running in the direction
from south-east to north-west. The second lay about 42 ft. deep, was of
about the size of a thick quill, and ran in the same direction. The third,
he said, lay at a depth of about 56 ft., running in the same direction, and as
large as a man's little finger. The actual results were as follows :—The first
watercourse was struck at a depth of 27| ft., running in the direction in
dicated, and having a diameter of one-fifth of an inch. The workmen came
on the second at a depth of 42J5 ft. ; it had a diameter of i/5ths of an inch.
The third was found at 62| ft. below the surface, and having a diameter of
yths of an inch—all three running in the direction Beraz had indicated.
The statements made by the reporter, who says that he was an eye
witness, are so circumstantial that they have the appearance of being
trustworthy, but it is to be regretted they were not the subject of
careful inquiry and corroboration at the time ; the more so as Iiothen-
burg is in the very centre of German scientific culture. If any readers
of this Report, who may be visiting Bavaria, can give me additional
information or*, this case, I should be grateful.1 Assuming the facts to
be as stated, they are of the greatest interest and theoretic importance,
for this case must be classed along with the Waterford case and a few
others of a similar type.
In Nasse's Zeilachrift fiir Psychisctw Aertze for 1821, Professor
D'Outrepont, Ph.D., of VViirzburg, gives some interesting facts con
cerning a dowser at Malmedy (a town on the Belgian frontier) with
whom he was acquainted. Mr. E. T. Bennett has translated Dr
D'Outrepont's paper, and published an abridgement of it in the S. P. R.
Journal for June, 1899, p. 83. It is therefore accessible for those
readers who wish for further information.
§ 2. Califomian Dowsers.
Amid the mass of correspondence which has reached me, often from
distant parts, I have had several letters from California, where it
appears there are several professional ore-tinders and water-finders, or
" water witches," as they are often locally called.
1 1 have to thank the Editor of the Times for sending me the editorial address of
the Allgemeine Zeitung, to which I wrote in the hope that the reporter referred to
might still be on the staff of that paper and able to give me some additional
confirmation of his statements. Unfortunately, however, I learnt in reply that this
was not the case ; nor could the Editor of the Allcgemeine Zeitnny ascertain who the
reporter was ; Beraz, he informs me, is dead ( Du Prel had stated this).
250 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part
One correspondent, Mr. B. F. Dixon, of Escondido, California, the
head of a firm of orange growers, writes as follows :—
Escondido, California, Noeember 22nrf, 1897.
Having read a review of your treatise on the Divining Rod in the papers
here, the following facts may interest you.
In the full of 1865 an acquaintance in Kansas had engaged a person to
locate a well on his place. The man held a forked peach twig, which moved
strongly at a certain spot. Upon my laughing at such utter nonsense, the
man asked me to try. Treating it as a joke, I did so, holding the forked
twig as I saw it held by the water-finder. To my astonishment, at the spot
where the water finder had marked, I felt what seemed like a slight electric
shock and immediately the forked twig turned violently in my hands. I
held the stick as tight as I could to prevent it moving, but it twisted right
round to the ground. I was dumbfounded and the joke was turned against
me. A well was sunk at the spot and a good supply of running water
obtained.
When it became known that I was a "water-witch," my services were
sought for and I have since located a large number of wells, without making
any charge. I have been surprised to find how accurate the indications of
the twig have turned out ; even in the depth I have rarely been far out ! 1
Mr. Dixon states he could give me many instances of his success
when previous attempts to find water had failed. He quotes one case
of his in considerable detail, which I will abridge. An acquaintance
of his in Kansas had spent large sums in sinking several wells on his
40 acre farm, but had got no water, though some of the wells were
70 ft. deep. At last he begged Mr. Dixon to come over and try his
hand. Mr. Dixon went and prospected with his peach twig ; he was
surprised to find the twig move strongly at one spot, indicating a
plentiful water supply, which he estimated at only 18 ft. deep. It
suited the owner's purpose better to sink a well a few feet from this
spot and at a depth of 22 ft. water was found streaming in from the
direction indicated by Mr. Dixon. As the well caved in shortly after,
the owner decided to sink a walled-in well at the very spot marked by
the twig, and at less than 20 ft. from the surface came upon so
abundant a supply of water that it has served the whole farm ever
since. I have no reason to doubt the accuracy of Mr. Dixon's state
ments, but it is desirable to have them confirmed by independent
observers, and therefore I should be grateful to any of our friends in
California who may live near Escondido if they would kindly send me
some further particulars.
Concerning one Californian dowser, a Captain Godfrey, I have
received an enormous mass of correspondence, forwarded to me by
1 Mr. Dixon does not say how he ascertains the depth by the motion of the twig.
xxxviii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 251
Dr. Hodgson and various other friends. Some of the evidence is
remarkable, and I hope to find time to give an abridgement of it at a
future time. Captain Godfrey declares he is so powerfully affected
by the neighbourhood of underground veins of ore or running
water that he is made quite ill. He attributes it all to electricity (!)
and his wife writes voluminous letters, asking for scientific enquiry.
This I have attempted to obtain, but Captain Godfrey declines to
submit to any tests. Dr. Hodgson has taken much trouble over
this case, and referred me to one of the members of the S. P. R.
in California, Mr. Radcliffe -Whitehead, who had recently visited
Captain Godfrey. I wrote to Mr. Whitehead, and had the following
reply : —
P.O. Box 144, Santa Barbara, California, March 6/A, 1898.
I called on Captain Godfrey in Pasadena, where he lives, two months
ago. He is a fine old man, and from what I have seen and heard I should
judge him to be above all suspicion of fraud. From the statements made
to the Society and similar ones made to me, I have no doubt that he has
some curious faculty, in fact, is a sensitiee.
The difficulty of going further with this case lies thus. Captain Godfrey
says :—
1. " I don't care a rap for the scientific aspect of my case."
2. " I suffer physically when I experience the sensations given me by
underground streams of water or veins of metal."
3. "I don't care to make experiments, nor will I seek for water for a
fee. I will only do so if I am to have a share in the ' development ' (as we
call it here) of said water."
Now I, as a developer of water on my own land,—I am making two
water tunnels at this time,—should be willing enough to employ Captain
Godfrey to " locate " water for me for a fee, but I am not disposed to agree
to his terms, though I have complete faith in his honesty.
I will write to him shortly and try to induce him to change his mind, but
as he has lately refused a neighbour of mine who made a similar proposal, I
confess I have not much hope. However nous renuns. I will report.
Ralph Raucliffe-Whitehead.
In a subsequent letter Mr. RadcliffeWhitehead informs me he has
failed to induce Godfrey to change his mind, and mentions another
Californian dowser he knows, and is about to employ. Another
one of our Californian members, to whom I had written about
Captain Godfrey, after undertaking to do what he could, writes as
follows :—
2,727, Ellendale-place, Los Angelos, California, U.S.A.,
February 17th, 1898.
My own experiments have been with a man who is a little ashamed of his
power, and does not attempt to explain it. He is honest beyond question,
and has submitted to such complete tests—being tested when blindfolded ;
252 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part
finding buried waterpipes ; and by the actual discovery of water in places
where it was least to be expected—that I am reluctantly forced to believe
that some such power exists, especially as a complete test satisfied me that it
was not a case of mind-reading.
I have no knowledge of divining for water without a rod, but one of my
farmers, who is an honest and clear-headed fellow, tells me that in his Iowa
home they found all their wells by aid of a man who almost had convulsions
when passing over running water. He gives some curious cases of wells so
found, after attempts to get water in the same farms without his aid had
failed, and one case where the man had a fit at a house-warming, and
declared that the trouble came from a spring under the house. On digging,
a powerful and valuable spring was discovered near the surface. If you
value such evidence, I shall be glad to get the exact facts and the man's name
f,,r you" Walter Nordhoff.
Various instances of the use of the rod for finding underground
water in other parts of the United States and in Canada were given in
the previous Report on pages 27, 44, 59, C2, and 215-220.
§ 3. South African Dowsers.
The use of the divining rod has even extended to Bulawayo. In
an article in that able English journal, the Surveyor, which refers to the
" cold scrutiny " and " careful dissecting " to which the diviner has been
subjected in our previous Report, the following instance of the use of
the rod in Bulawayo is quoted from a correspondent to a South African
newspaper : —
Having sunk on the spot located through the medium of the divining
rod, I have, at a depth of 30 ft., struck the water ; whereas my neighbour,
at considerable expense, two years ago sank, on the same line and only 30
yards away, to a depth of 45 ft. without any result whatever. I am now
convinced of the great expense which the rod may save in sinking for water.
This must be taken for what it is worth, as no names are given. In
South African journals for August, 1897, particulars are given of a
clerical water-tinder.
"It will be remembered," says the Grahamskmni Journal "that some
months ago the Rev. Father M.irconnes, of St. Aidan's College, who is an
adept in the use of the divining rod, made certain predictions as to the
finding of water in certain spots, which he pointed out. The Government
sieam drill, under Mr. J. L. Caithness, has now found water just outside the
Chronic Sick confines at Cape Corps Camp on the Commonage. The water
was found at a spot pointed out by the diviner. It was first tapped at
21 ft. by an excavation Mr. Caithness was making to get his bore loose,
and at 37 ft. a supply of quite 6,000 gallons per diem was tapped. The
water is good and fresh. Again, at the St. Andrew's College, where Father
xxxviii.] On the So-called Divining Hod. 253
Marconnes pointed out a spot, ami said there was water at 40 ft., the precious
fluid has been tapped exactly at 40 ft., and in good quantity."
Father Marconnes writes in a subsequent number of the Grahams-
town Journal that ho prefers to call his divining rod a water compass,
or hydro-magnet, as it is a " scientific instrument," and clearly indicates
that electricity is the true cause of its action ; he does not, however,
give any evidence in support of his belief. I do not quote this case as
of any evidential value, for I have not been able to verify it, and more
over there is nothing to indicate that water would not have been found
without Father Marconnes' aid, but I give it simply to indicate the
widespread use of the rod.
As is well known, the divining rod was frequently used during the
17th century for tracking suspected persons, and for other purposes in
the "moral world." Among the native races in South Africa the rod
appears to be still in use for a like purpose. Though outside the range
of the present Report, the following incident in connection with the
siege of Mafeking has attracted so much attention that I will briefly
refer to it here. A Press Association telegram appeared in the English
newspapers of April 18th, 1900, to this effect:—
April bth.
Lieut. Frank Smitheman, the renowned Matabele scout, got through the
Boer lines, and arrived here yesterday, carrying an Imperial Government
despatch for Col. Baden-Powell. He had an adventurous journey, spending
two nights in coming from Ramathlahama on foot.
Lieut. Smitheman, who knows every inch of the country, was accom
panied by a clever native runner, who uses a divining rod to ascertain the
position of the enemy. This rod he handles after the fashion of the Wilt
shire water-finder, thoroughly believing in its efficiency.
Lieut. Smitheman's feat is one of the utmost importance. Only two
whites have entered the town since the beginning of the investment.
Two centuries ago (in 1692) the famous dowser, Jacques Aymar,
became notorious by his discovery (through following the indications
of the rod) of the murderer of a poor wine-seller in Lyons, and in 1703
he was employed to identify the Camisards by the same means. Since
then (owing chiefly to the rod being condemned for any use in the
" moral world," see p. 258) its employment for criminal purposes has
disappeared in Europe. Inquiry may prove that the South African
report is not to be credited, or the "diviner" worthless, but the case
of Jacques Aymar is as well attested as any fact in history.1 I have
in my possession a mass of original documents, published at the time,
which place the really extraordinary character of Aymar's discovery of
1 The best modern account of this story is given in Figuier's Histuire du Mtr-
reillcux, Vol. II., Chap. 5.
254 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part
the murderer of the Lyons wine-seller beyond doubt. Nor is there
any improbability in the circumstance, if we here regard the dowser as
a bloodhound following a trail, which his sub-conscious self picks up
and indicates through the involuntary motion of the rod he carries.
§ 4. Australian Dowsers.
In the previous Report (Vol. XIII., pp. 45-47) I gave an account
of four successful amateur dowsers in Queensland and New South
Wales. Several other cases of Australian dowsers have since reached
me. Two cases are of such interest that I will briefly refer to them,
as in both these cases the dowsers were gentlemen of good standing
and intelligence.
(1) The following account has been sent me by Mr. Vaughan
Jenkins ; it was published in the Sydney Stock Journal and in the
Annidate Chronicle (a New South Wales paper) for April 14th, 1900.
The report is too long to quote, and I give a summary of its essential
parts.
The President of the Armidale Cattle Show, Mr. F. J. White (a well-
known man), was greatly in need of a water supply on his estate, Saumarez.
For twenty-four years that his family have lived there they have had to cart
water from a distance, as did their predecessor, Mr. Thomas, attempts to
find water on the place having failed. Eventually Mr. White sunk a deep
well, 120 ft. deep, through the solid rock, but no water was reached. A
friend who was visiting the place happened to he an amateur dowser, and,
seeing the useless well, offered to try his luck with the divining rod. He
did so, and the rod turned vigorously at a certain spot. Here another well
was sunk, and at 35 ft. water was struck, it rose to 20 ft. from the surface,
and now supplies the place and the gardens. Mr. White then tried the rod
himself and found to his surprise it turned in his hands : trusting solely to
its guidance, he has since sunk six more wells, and found water in every spot
so indicated. He is now so firmly convinced of the value of the rod that
he has recently offered to pay the cost of digging any well if its indications
turn out wrong. The writer of the article went as a sceptic to investigate
and report, but his amused incredulity became astonishment when he found
the twig turned in his hands also. He remarks : " I don't believe in that
twig business, but the facts are against me. Will somebody explain ? "
The foregoing newspaper report must be taken for what it is worth,
as I have not had time to verify it by independent inquiries.
(2) The other case I have received through the kindness of a
West Australian friend, Mr. E. T. Scammell, 37, St. Mary Axe,
London, E.C. The dowser in this case was his friend, the late Mr.
E. H. Deuington, for many years an Australian journalist of high
xxxvm.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 255
standing and unimpeachable integrity. At my request Mr. Scammell
obtained a lengthy narrative, accompanied by the corroborative
testimony of independent witnesses, from Mr. Derrington. This
account is of interest from the fact that Mr. Derrington became a
very successful dowser for mineral lodes, particulars of which will be
given in that part of our work. Mr. Derrington writes :—
Coolgardie, W. Australia, May 24lh, 1898.
Newspaper editorship during many years predisposed me to regard with
strong scepticism all fads and faddists. I, with courtesy, declined even to
witness experiments with the so-called "divining rod"—a name as absurd
and untrue as any I have ever heard, since there is no divination in the
whole process. Ignorance and credulity may still employ it, but no
educated man would employ it. But, some fourteen years ago, there
occurred in the colony I have made my home for now nearly half a century,
one of the periodical droughts for which unfortunately South Australia has
become noted. The misery and ruin in the out-lying agricultural districts
were forced upon my attention, and then the pretensions of the water-
finders came to my mind, and I resolved upon an impartial investigation,
remembering what a priceless boon would be conferred if hidden supplies
of water could be discovered in the waterless districts. I applied to an
old German of most respectable antecedents and strong common-sense, who
was renowned as a successful exponent of the art. Without giving me any
illustration, he at once placed in my hand a V-shaped eucalyptus twig, and
whilst he remained at the entrance-gate, requested me to cross from one
side to the other through his garden. I did so, and midway was astonished
by the twig (held by the points in the forks of the thumbs, the fingers
being closed over it in the palms of the hands) suddenly up-rising and
standing perpendicularly, entirely without my volition, and falling back into
its horizontal position when I had passed one particular spot. I repeated
the experiment a number of times with the same result, only that I noticed
a singular sensation as of an electric current through the spine whenever
the twig moved as described. My friend watching then showed me that I
had stood over a concealed water-channel fed by a spring from the upper part
of his garden, and complimented me upon being the most sensitive water-
finder he had ever met. This was my first acquaintance with this unknown
faculty. I laid aside scepticism and eagerly made use of this method to
assist the distressed farmers with whom I came into contact.
I have since made very numerous experiments, with a view to an
accurate estimate of the cause and effect ; and I have submitted to a variety
of crude tests, many of which were designed less for the discovery of
a scientific basis than to throw ridicule upon an obscure phenomenon.
Pseudo-scientists are prone to sneer at what they cannot understand, but
I hold there is in ascertained results sufficient ground to justify the hope
that, at some not far distant future, a possibility of effecting economic results
of incalculable value in the discovery both of underground water and ore
by means of the so-called divining rod.
As to the nature of the influence which moves the rod, I am inclined to
believe that in certain sensitives there may possibly be set up a current or
256 Profevsor W. F. Barrett. [part
influence by the electrical currents in the underground water or metallic
veins. For I discovered subsequently my "galvanometer," the rod, moved
whenever I was over metallic veins or even metals on the surface of the
8round- E. H. Derrington.
In the foregoing narrative no evidence is detailed to show that Mr.
Derrington's predictions were verified by digging or boring, nor that he
succeeded when other means had failed ; he adduces, however, some
striking evidence of his success in the discovery of mineral lodes, but
this part of his letter I will give in another place His electrical
theory sounds a plausible one; it is much the same as Dr. Thouvenel's
a century ago, but is unsupported by any scientific evidence and will
be referred to later on. I may add that in the recent obituary
notices of Mr. Derrington in the South Australian newspapers, a
high tribute is paid to him ; he was not a man likely to be led
astray by hasty inferences as to the value of the indications afforded
by the divining rod.
I now propose to give a somewhat detailed account of that
remarkable French peasant lad, Bleton, whose performances as a
water-finder Dr. Thouvenel has made famous.
xxxviii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 257
PART X.
Bleton, the Notable French Dowser of the Last Century.
Barthelmy Bleton, to whom reference has already been made (on
p. 20 e.t seq. of the previous Report) was born at Bouvantes in
Dauphiny, somewhere between the years 1740 and 1750.1 He was
the son of a poor peasant, was brought up by charity in one of the
Carthusian monasteries of Dauphiny, and became a herdsman. An
accidental circumstance seems to have led to the discovery of Bleton's
peculiar faculty. Here is the account which I find given by one of Dr.
Thouvenel's correspondents, who writes from Dijon on April 14th,
1781, and who adds he has certain proofs of all that he has stated.2
The following extract is translated from the original letter : —,
Bleton, when seven years of age, had carried dinner to some workmen ;
he sat down on a stone, when a fever or faintness seized him ; the workmen
having brought him to their side, the faintness ceased, but each time he
returned to the stone, he suffered again. This was told to the Prior of the
Chartreuse, who wished to see it for himself Being thus convinced of the
fact, he had the ground under the stone dug up ; there they found a spring,
which, I am told, is still in use to turn a mill.
A similar account is given by another contemporary quoted by
Figuier, and by the writer in the Monthly Review for 1782, who
quotes from a French pamphlet, the writer of which states the
circumstance is " confirmed by many local witnesses." Some confirma
tion of the foregoing story is gained from a remark made by the Prior
"de la Chartreuse de Lyon" in a document testifying to Bleton's
extraordinary faculty (quoted by Thouvenel) that Bleton " was quite
as well able to detect underground water when he was seven years old
as he is now." (March 3rd, 1781.)
In any other part of the world except Dauphiny the coincidence
of the boy's illness and the presence of an underground spring would
1 The exact date of hia birth is uncertain, nor is it of any consequence. The above
date is deduced from an incidental observation in the evidence about to be cited. In
1773, as appears from another witness, Bleton's faculty was so well known that he
was then in request as a water-finder or sourcicr. Our principal knowledge of Bleton,
as will be mentioned presently, is derived from the writings of Dr. Thouvenel, one of
Louis XVI. 's physicians ; he always spells the word Bleton, not Bleton.
* See Dr. Thouvenel's Mimoirc Physique et Midicinal, 1781, p. 251 ; Monthly
Review, 1782, Vol. LXVIL, p. 554 ; Figuier's La baguette divinatoire, p. 365. Figuier

probably soon have been forgotten. But, a century before, Jacques
Aymar and his rod had made this province famous for its diviners,
Aymar having been followed by many who claimed a similar '' gift."
As, however, the Inquisition had forbidden the use of the rod in the
"moral world," that is, for tracing criminals, or determining boun
daries, or settling lawsuits, etc. (its use for these purposes having
become a most mischievous superstition and scandal), these diviners,
or tourneurx, were chiefly water-finders, or soureters. Bleton was
therefore at once considered to be a new and sensitive sourcier. Some
tests followed which confirmed this view. Doubtless, custom
demanded that he should have a rod, and the subsequent use by
Bleton of a nearly straight rod, resting on the forefingers of each
hand, satisfied the sense of sourcier propriety. The rod was very
slightly curved, and rotated more or less rapidly on its axis when
Bleton came over an underground spring. Dr. Thouvenel states he
counted from 30 to 80 revolutions per minute, and upwards.
The rotation of the rod was doubtless caused by involuntary
muscular action on Bleton's part. There is no reason to suppose he
moved it intentionally ; in fact, it is a very difficult, if not impossible,
feat to accomplish by volition, except to one long practised in sleight
of hand, as any one can prove who supports a short slightly-curved
stick on his forefingers, and attempts to cause it to rotate from " 30 to
80 times a minute." On the other hand, there is no reason to assume
any other motive power than muscular action, as the famous
astronomer Lalande showed that Bleton's rod could be made to rotate
by this means. To this I have already referred in my previous paper,
and will quote Lalande's own words later on, on p. 273.
How Bleton came by this novel form of rod is not told us.1
Possibly it was a survival in Dauphiny of an old type of the virgula
divina. A straight rod, supported horizontally between the forefinger
and thumb of each hand, is described and depicted on the title page
of that interesting old book on the divining rod, La Verge de Jacob2
1 The only notice I can find of the peculiarity of Bleton's rod is in a letter "from
a distinguished physician " cited by Thouvenel in support of Bleton's faculty. The
writer says (p. 277 of Thouvenel's Memoirc) that although nearly all the tourncitrs,
i.e., dowsers, he has known, use a forked rod, yet some in Germany use a simple rod,
very slightly curved, placed across the back of the hand, " ou comme Bleton, sur
l'extrémité des deux doigts indicateurs. " This reference to Germany is probably
taken from De Vallemont's Phyiiqve Occidte (1693) where there is a picture of a man
holding the rod in this way (see next woodcut). Still earlier, in 1640, the learned
German Jesuit, A. Kircher, describes a straight-pivoted divining rod which rotates
when held horizontally between the forefingers of each hand (see upper figure on the
wood-cut, Fig. 17). This, he remarks, he has seen used by some German diviners :
see Kircher's Magna sire de arte Maynetica, p. 724 of the 1640 edition.
■ It need hardly be said that this, like every other early work on the divining
rod, is perfectly worthless from the point of view of modern science.
XXXVIU.] 259
On the So-called Divininy Hod,
(see D on the woodcut, Fig. 1 6), which was published at Lyons in
1693. In the third chapter of this book the writer says that in
order to ascertain if a person really has the faculty of finding a
hidden spring, he must let a straight stick rest across his hands, in
the manner shown in the lowest figure of the woodcuts on this and the
next page ; if he has the faculty the stick begins to rotate.1 Bleton
was probably tested in this way, and subsequently used this rotating
rod as the outward and visible sign of the inward commotion he

experienced. This is the more probable as the little book, La Verge
de Jacob, was likely to be well known in Dauphiny, being published
at the neighlxiuring town of Lyons, where also Bleton was frequently
engaged. (See also the woodcut on p. 274.)
The singular physiological effect produced upon Bleton by under
ground springs seems to have been retained more or less throughout his

life. A sort of convulsive spasm seized him, affecting the diaphragm
and pulse. Abundant evidence of the genuineness of this "com
motion " is given by a number of unimpeachable witnesses. But this
aspect of our subject I will return to in a later section, when the
medical report Dr. Thouvenel gives of the peculiar symptoms exhibited
by his " patient " will be quoted. Here I will only add thatJBleton's
sensibility appeared to vary, being greater in dry weather and before
meals. It entirely ceased during an illness he had, and did not return
Fio. 17.
until three months subsequent to his recovery. The rate of rotation of
the baguette was observed closely to correspond with the physiological
effect produced. When Bleton moved away from an underground
spring, the symptoms disappeared as rapidly as they arose, and the
pulse resumed its normal rate. Stagnant water appeared to make
no impression on him, nor the water of exposed rivers, lakes, <fee.
This latter is indeed a singular, and at first sight appears a suspicious
circumstance, difficult to reconcile with any physical theory of the
phenomena. But equally singular is the fact that it is affirmed by all
diviners from the time of Jacques Aymar in 1693 down to the present
xxxvm.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 261
day,1 and not in one country but wherever the divining rod is in
use, not the least singular fact how this tradition (if it be only
such) has spread, for diviners, as a rule, are illiterate men, ignorant
of any language but their own. Let us now examine what experi
mental evidence history has preserved on behalf of Bleton's alleged
powers.
The principal source of information is found in two treatises
entitled Memoire Physique et Medicinal, by Dr. Thouvenel, who was a
distinguished French physician.- The first treatise was published in
1781 and the second in 1784, and both are almost entirely devoted to
a record of observations with Bleton and an exposition of Thouvenel's
electrical theory of the phenomena.3 The best English summary of
these memoires is to be found in that old but well edited register of
current literature, the Monthly Reciew for 1781, 1783, and 1784.
There are, unfortunately, few details given by Thouvenel of his
own experiments with l-tleton.
No. 1.—Here, however, is one, which he says is a complicated test
to which he submitted Bleton. I will give an abridged translation
(pp. 69 and 70).
Over a stone bridge, of one arch, pass four small wooden aqueducts,
carrying water to Nancy. Only the engineer, who had never seen Bleton,
knew the exact position of these four rows of pipes, their distance apart,
depth underground, etc., the whole being well covered by earth and vegeta
tion. He gave me secretly information on this, of which Bleton was entirely
ignorant. The latter was then taken across this bridge, as though to return
to the town, after various experiments had been made in the neighborhood,
and without being told that fresh experiments were to be made. Just
before reaching the bridge, he asserted water was flowing beneath him, and
the sensation continued with slight gaps, while crossing and in front of the
bridge to a distance of five or six feet. He retraced his steps several times
before finding distinctly the four channels, and was much astonished to
1 In 1689 an interesting correspondence (to which I will return) took place
between those acute intellects, Fathers Malebranche and Le Brun, on this very point.
For a discussion of the sensations alleged to be experienced by dowsers, see
Proceedings S.P.R.. Part XXXII., Appendix D., p. 272.
a The great French Biographical Dictionary gives an admirable account of
Thouvenel's life, which deserves to be more widely known. Like Dr. Elliotson, in
defence of mesmerism, Dr. Thouvenel had to face a storm of obloquy for his courage
in defending Bleton. His long and patient investigations were treated with contempt.
He left France for Italy at the time of the Revolution, and died in 1815.
3 I have to thank II. Holland, of 2, Rue des Chantiers, Paris, for enabling me to
obtain a copy of Thouvenel's earlier and more important Memoire, together with
other rare French, German and Italian books, pamphlets, and newspaper cuttings
of the last century bearing upon the baguette divinatoire. To those engaged in
any special literary research I can heartily commend M. Holland's courteous help
and excellent agency.
262 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part
find them so near. He was then told that they were simply four hollow tree
trunks made to .serve as aqueducts.
Thouvenel then describes other tests as to the distance apart of
these pipes, and remarks that as a small stream about 3 feet wide was
flowing some 10 feet beneath the bridge, he endeavoured to ascertain
what effect it had on Bleton ; a careful experiment showed that the
agitation of the diviner and the rotation of the baguette sensibly
increased on crossing the stream. There is nothing, however, in these
experiments to exclude the effect of telepathy or even involuntary
suggestion upon Bleton's mind. It is, however, only within recent
years that the powerful influence of suggestion, both on mind and
body, has received the attention of physiologists, and therefore we
need not te surprised that some of Thouvenel's experiments are
capable of a different interpretation from that which he gave. For
example, he found that when his sourcier was over a spring and the
baguette turning strongly, the convulsive movements of the body and
the rotation of the rod were almost arrested the moment he touched
Bleton with various " magnetic compositions recently electrified " !
Experiments were also made when Bleton was insulated, but these
I will deal with in another part, as the belief that insulation stops
the movement of the rod is almost as widespread as that of the
different effects of running and stagnant water.
On pp. 77-80 of his first memoire Thouvenel gives a summary of
the tests he made with Bleton in Lorraine. The following is a
translation of the passage ' : —
I took the precaution to repeat several times all the experiments just
described in detail, after having carefully blindfolded Bleton ; in addition
his arms were sometimes fastened behind his back leaving his forearms only
just sufficiently free to hold the baguette at the extremity of his fingers,
sometimes even confining these, in order to hinder if possible all mechanical
movement. These precautions were not taken for my own satisfaction, as I
was already entirely convinced.
I conducted Bleton to places which he had never seen ; I took him
towards springs of which I knew, but which he could not know of, at other
times over ground where neither of us knew what might bu found. When
ever he experienced his peculiar sensations—and whenever the baguette
repeatedly turned at the same spot, —I then led him far away, bringing him
back by quite different roads, still with his eyes bandaged. . . . When
he had followed the course of an underground spring—sometimes for more
than a quarter of a mile, across mountains, rock, or forests, and indicated
on the way numerous subdivisions of the same spring— I made him return.
He then re-conducted me himself, though still blindfolded, only supported by
one arm, to the point from which we set out, without straying a single step

from the line previously traced and marked by pegs, which were often hidden
beneath the surface. He re-found all the subterranean rivulets already
pointed out, and followed exactly the sinuosities of the underground stream.
It frequently happened that we came across springs whose course was
interrupted by walls, terraces, or wide ditches, so that in order to enable
Bleton to overcover these obstacles, I had to procure ladders, or take long
detours, or in some way get him conveyed across ; nevertheless, although
blindfolded, he soon regained the course without the aid of his eyes.
Sometimes in order to try and deceive him, if his senses were concerned,
I placed false marks as if to indicate a spring; sometimes after he had
followed a spring across several fields, I moved the pegs some feet away
without his knowledge. Nevertheless, he was never led astray and always
rectified such errors. In fine, I tried all sorts of ways to deceive him, and I
can testify that in more than six hundred trials, I did not succeed in doing
so one single time.
M. Jadelot, the Professor of Medicine in Nancy, Thouvenel states,
was a witness of, and co-operated in, all his experiments, which
extended over a space of two months, and was no less struck than he
was with the strength and importance of the evidence obtained.
Another distinguished savant who was converted to a belief in the
baguette was M. Sigaud de la Fond, whose published testimony
Thouvenel quotes (p. 289 et seq.). But the most important evidence
on behalf of Bleton is contained in the numerous letters and affidavits
Thouvenel appends to his work. These are the replies he received
from various well-known persons who had employed Bleton, and
whose opinion he had asked. I will quote some of these directly.
In addition to the foregoing, Bleton found one or more valuable
springs (as testified by letters or proces-verbaux) for the Marquis de
Torcy in Poiton, for the President of Lamoignon in Basville, for the
Bishop of Laon in Annisy, for the Count dAdhemar in Thun, for the
Duke d'IJzes, Count de la Blanche, Count du Bourg, President
d'Ornacieux, M. de la Borde, and many other French personages of
distinction. There are also brief statements from 20 other persons
for whom Bleton found plusieurs belles sources, in addition to the 17
letters or affidavits quoted at length by Thouvenel. In these pieces
justificatives Thouvenel as a rule gives only the initials of his corre
spondents ; the documents, he tells us, are all signed and some legally
attested, but some of the writers might object to their names being
published ; moreover, he adds that in physics names add nothing to
the facts themselves.1
No. 2.—In one statement, however, this rule is departed from,
and Thouvenel humorously prefixes the heading : " Proces verbal

as the author of these Memoires.
26-1 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part
sur Bleton . . . papier timbre", paraphe", collationne, etc., etc. (Bon
pour ceux qui aiment ces petites formalites)," and the testimony is
certified by, and attested before, a list of signatories whose names
and official titles are appended. In this case the evidence of the
various municipal officers of the Commune of St. Jean-en-Royant in
Dauphiny is given. Bleton was a native of, and resided in, this
commune (Bouvantes being a parish therein), and the proces-verbal
states that Bleton had possessed the gift of finding springs for about
30 years, and had practised it much to the advantage of the inhabitants
of the commune. Specific instances are then cited of the more
important springs Bleton had found in arid ground—springs which
were still running, the witnesses affirm, and had largely increased the
value of the property in the commune: owing to these discoveries, fertile
and productive land had, in several places, now replaced the previously
barren soil. The Chief Clerk of the neighbouring commune states that
Bleton found for him an ample spring in a district where no water was
previously known to exist, the result of which was that the ground,
which formerly was of little or no value, now is a valuable property.
The signatories of the proces-verbal further testify that Bleton had
discovered during the preceding 20 years a quantity of springs in
other neighbouring communes, some of these being of so great a
volume that machinery was worked by them.
No. 3.—Another document also signed by M. A., an inhabitant
of St. Jean de Royant, states that the value of his property had
been increased tenfold by the springs discovered on it by Bleton.
No. i.—The Prior of the Chartreuse de Lyon testifies (March 3rd,
1781) that Bleton had found several springs for him and had not once
been mistaken, though his estimate of the depth and volume of the
water he acknowledged to be conjectural. Bleton's discovery of his
liability to err on this point being, he adds, the only progress he had
made since he was seven years old, when " il etoit aussi savant qu'il
Test actuellement." The Prior states that when he held Bleton's
wrist, the change in Bleton's pulse was so perceptible upon arriving
over an underground spring that the fact was as obvious to him as to
the sourcier, a baguette being perfectly needless.
No. 5.— The CJtevalier de M , formerly Captain of the Pied
mont regiment, testifies that he has been convinced of Bleton's powers
in spite of the prejudices he previously entertained. Having put
Bleton to all the proofs he could think of, he never once found him
mistaken. " Whatever the power is," he remarks, " it is not the mere
movement of the baguette that astonishes me—that might be a matter
xxxviii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 265
of skill—but the effect on Bleton's pulse and nervous system were
unmistakeable, and these cannot be simulated. Moreover," he con
tinues, " j'ai fait toutes les chicanes que mes doutes m'ont inspirees,"
until doubt became impossible. The Chevalier describes in detail one
of several tests he made ; he brought Bleton to his own house, arriving
after dark ; in passing through the village, which Bleton had not visited
before, Bleton suddenly stopped and said water was there ; he followed
it in the darkness and arrived at a spot where he declared the spring
existed ; he was right ; it was, in fact the source of the fountain of
the castle. Other tests are also given : altogether a remarkable and
weighty testimony.
No. 6.—M. de F., the receiver of taxes for Autun, states that a
strong spring was discovered on his place by Bleton. In order to
test the sourcier, M. de F. afterwards blindfolded him, and took him
over the same ground ; Bleton marked precisely the same spots he
did previously when not blindfolded ; this experiment he repeated
several times.
No. 7.—Dr. de C. (a neighbour of M. de F.) took Bleton to his
house, where Bleton accurately traced the course of the water pipes, a
fact confirmed by the workmen who had laid them.
No. 8.—M. le Comte de M., of Chagny, describes several careful
tests he made of Bleton. In one, after Bleton had accurately indicated
an underground spring (the existence of which was known to the
Count, but unknown to Bleton) and traced its direction, which was
noted, the Count then carefully bandaged Bleton's eyes with a thick
handkerchief, and, in order to mislead him, turned him round several
times ; nevertheless Bleton correctly indicated the same course of the
spring, in spite of frequent attempts made to divert him. Holding his
wrist, the Count noticed that the change in the rate of Bleton's pulse
was very marked when he came over the spring.
No. 9.—The Bishop of M. describes how his Archbishop tested
Bleton's ability to discover running water : (1) Bleton correctly traced
the buried water pipes in the Archbishop's grounds when water was
flowing through them ; (2) Unknown to Bleton the water was then
turned off and he was asked to repeat the trial, and he completely failed
to find the pipes ; (3) Again the water was secretly turned on, and
Bleton once more correctly indicated the direction taken by the pipes.
No. 10.—The Chevalier de S., commandeur de Malte, states that
many years previously his grandfather had made several attempts
to find water at his Chdteau pres de la Cdte de Saint-Andre, had
266 Professcn- W. F. Barrett. [pakt
even sunk a well to the depth of seventy feet, which had to he
abandoned. The Chevalier de S., and his brother, the President d'O.,
in 1735 sent for a sourcier they knew of who traversed the estate,
using an iron rod they had picked up as a baguette. Upon their
expressing surprise at his ability to use so novel a divining rod, the
sourcier replied, " the rod is of no consequence, it is the peculiar
feeling I have when over an underground spring that guides me."
In 1773 (thirty-eight years later) the Chevalier heard of Bleton and
sent for him. On his arrival he was taken to the terrace, where the
rod began to rotate, and the site of the well was correctly indicated.
To estimate its depth Bleton went to, a certain distance on each side,
the rod rotating in an opposite direction as he moved away from the
spring. By observing the distance and decreasing force of the rotation,
Bleton estimated the depth of the well to be 64 feet : its actual depth
was 66 feet.
Bleton was then taken to a hill behind the chateau, when he
pointed out the existence of several springs in the spots marked ; the
following winter a well was sunk at one of these spots and water
found at a depth of 18 feet, a narrow layer of sand being struck after
piercing through the upper very hard rock. This spring has never run
dry, even in times of great drought. Two years later (in 1775) Bleton
was again tested on the same estate and he indicated another spring,
the depth of which he estimated at 33 feet ; a well was sunk at this
spot and the prediction was verified. Some time after, the two springs
were joined by underground conduits ; these conduits Bleton accurately
traced when he was again summoned to the chateau in 1779.
In 1781 a fourth visit to this estate was made by Bleton. This
time he discovered another spring, which he estimated at 25 feet deep;
a well was sunk and at 35 feet an abundant supply of water was
obtained ; this also issued from a layer of sand beneath the hard
superincumbent rock.
Some experiments were then made by the President d'O. and his
brother as to the movement of the baguette when Bleton was placed in
various positions. The rod turned when he lay on his back, but not
on his stomach, nor did it turn when it was placed on his loins when he
was lying down. Bleton was then suspended upside down and the
baguette placed on the soles of his feet ; it did not rotate. Bleton,
however, showed them that when the rod was placed nearly perpen
dicularly with one end resting on the palm of the left hand, and the
other in the air, encircled by a ring formed of the finger and thumb of
the right hand placed a little below the point, the baguette " pirouetted
slowly," when over a spring.
This interesting document ends by suggesting the desirability of
placing le tourriKur de baguette on a sheet of resin or a glass-legged

stool and noticing whether his peculiar sensations are still experienced,
or whether they resemble the sensations one has when thus insulated
and connected with an electric machine. If, remarks the Chevalier,
running water gives off subtle emanations, they must be comparable
to those of light, and possibly suffer refraction and reflection in their
course. The document is signed by the President d'O., who states
that he did not write it, but he approves ; and that the facts narrated
were all witnessed by him, his son, the Chevalier de S., and other
persons, and he adds his conviction that Bleton employed no
charlatanerie in any of his proceedings.
No. 11.—On the lands of the Abbe de Vervains there were certain
springs, all trace of which had long been lost ; they were, however,
known to exist from the ancient title-deeds of the estate. A lawsuit
hinged upon the question of their existence being actually proved.
When search for the springs had been made in vain, Bleton was sent
for. He came and indicated the place where these springs existed.
Their actual existence was then discovered, and the lawsuit
terminated.1
No. 12.—Surgeon-Major N., of St. Geny Laval, near Lyons, testifies
that Bleton came to a part of his estate which was rocky and arid,
and found one spot where the baguette indicated a considerable
spring, which he estimated to be at a depth of some 55 feet. A well
was sunk, but no water found at this depth. Bleton was, therefore,
sent for again. He tested the ground once more, asserted confidently
that a good spring would be found at a few feet lower, remarking that he
was often mistaken as to the depth when it was over 30 feet.2 The
well was, therefore, deepened, and at 7 or 8 feet lower so powerful a
spring gushed forth that it was impossible to sink deeper, as the water
rapidly rose in the well, which was 5 feet in diameter. The witness
adds, "A useless land has thus been converted into a meadow."
No. 13. —P. I. G., and Seigneur D., Conseiller du Parlement de B.,
affirm that they brought Bleton to Tanyot, in Bourgogne, where he was
subjected to various tests, three of which are cited : (1) He was asked
to find the course of some water pipes that had been laid some time
previously and which were completely covered by earth and grass,
so that no difference was apparent on the surface of the ground.
Bleton immediately discovered the position of, and accurately traced,

the course of these pipes. (2) He was asked to find the spring which
supplied a neighbouring well, and to estimate its depth. This he did
quite accurately, and stated it was a very feeble spring, which the
owner of the well certified was also correct. (3) He was asked to
find a supply of water for their chateau. For some time he searched in
vain, but eventually in another direction he found six small springs:
their position was marked by pegs. Upon digging at these spots,
springs were found in each place at about the depth and volume
he indicated. These springs were then connected by a deep trench,
and furnished an abundant supply of water for both house and
garden.
It is needless to translate and summarise the other documents,
which contain similar evidence. Thouvenel's treatise, however, is not
the only source of our information about Bleton. Accounts of this
sourcier are to be found in many of the French journals of that period.
I am indebted for much of the subsequent evidence to the excellent
and impartial narrative of Bleton given by Louis Figuier in the
seventh chapter of the second volume of his Histoire du Merveilleux,
which contains some facts I have not met with elsewhere.
No. 14.— In the Journal de Paris of May 13th, 1782, an account
was published of some careful experiments made to test Bleton's
powers in the gardens of the Luxembourg under the direction of
M. Guillaumot " intendant general des batiments du roi," who was
accompanied by inspectors and officials of the gardens. The report
states :—
Sorti du Chateau d'Eau, Bleton a suivi dans la campagne l'aqueduc
d'Arcueil avec une precision telle que, pour nous servir d'une de M.
Guillaumot, si ce plan venait a se perdre, on le referait sur les traces
de Bleton.
The report states that M. Guillaumot verified from the plans the
angles and sinuosities made by the (I presume subterranean) aqueduct,
and these the report adds : " nous dirons presque math&natiques
designes par Bleton." Two days later the experiments were repeated
in the presence of the municipal authorities and a crowd of spectators.
The report states :—
Ici les expériences ont 6te telles qu'a l'exception de deux seuls temoins,
qui avaient publiquement avancu qn'ils ne croiraient pas, meme en voyant,
qu' a cette exception pres, sur cinq cents spectateurs, il n'en est pas

Other trials followed in the presence of ministers of state, ambas
sadors, magistrates, scientific men and the clergy, and the Journal de
Paris, in summing up the experiments, records that Bleton followed

No. 15.—Some rigorous experiments were made by a committee of
six savants, who drew up a report dated, "Paris, May 25th, 1782."
This report, which was signed by all the member?, states that Bleton,
having been blindfolded with extreme care by a succession of black
and then white linen bandages, with cotton wool stuffed up the sides
of his nostrils, was taken to the garden of one of the members of
the committee, wherein a water-pipe ran underground to a distant
fountain. The jets of this fountain had been removed, so that the
water ran into the basin, and off through an overflow pipe, quite
noiselessly. Here Bleton indicated running water at certain spots
which were marked; he was then made to retrace his steps 10 or 12
times, and it was found that the baguette turned nearly, but not quite,
invariably when he crossed the same spots : at the places where the
water entered the basin and where the overflow pipe discharged he
was always right. This they verified at least a dozen times. The
experiments lasted two hours, with a short interval for rest ; during
the whole time Bleton was blindfolded, and during part of that time
M. Thouvenel was not present.
According to the writer of the article in the Monthly Review for
1782 :—
These successes led the Queen of France to employ Bleton, and the
springs that have been found in consequence of his indications have
fertilised and embellished several arid districts, among which Trianon is a
striking example, as that delightful seat has acquired new charms by
Bleton's discoveries.1
The Editor of the Journal des Spectacles, in a figure of speech, we
must assume, states that Bleton, by his discovery of numerous springs,
had changed Dauphiny from an arid soil, which produced nothing, to
one of the richest in France. Dr. Ginetz, writing in the Journal de
Paris for November, 1807, states that, "The efficacy of the baguette is
nowhere contested in Dauphiny. I have myself," he says, " frequently
1 According to Fijjuier, however, Bleton had some failures at Trianon, mistaking
averns and dry conduits for underground water.
270 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part
observed the effects of the baguette, and can state from personal
experience its success in seeking for springs and metallic veins." 1
In Thouvenel's second Mhnoire, published in 1784, a further
account is given of his experiments with Bleton. This eminent physi
cian was commissioned in 1 783 by Louis XVI. to examine and report
on the mineral and medicinal waters of France, and to aid him in
the discovery of any fresh mineral springs, he obtained permission
to engage the services of Bleton.2 Most of this second Memoire is
therefore occupied with tracing hot springs and mineral waters, with
conjectures as to the source of the former, and attempts to verify the
electrical hypothesis which Thouvenel had formed, of the influence of
subterranean springs on the diviner.
We need not concern ourselves with the latter, as the experiments
cited are certainly open to criticism, and would only excite a smile in
the wider scientific knowledge of the present day. It is, however,
now known, as Thouvenel conjectured, that there are subterraneous
electric currents, the strength of which fluctuates in various places
and from time to time. It is certainly a curious coincidence, if it be
no more, that upwards of one hundred years ago this French physician,
on the faith of Bleton's sensations, maintained that these electrical
manifestations appeared in general to run east and west.3 Current
electricity itself was not discovered till ten years later, the existence
of earth currents was not known till Barlow's experiments in 1849, and
the general trend of these currents east and west was a still more
recent observation.4
1 It was in Provence (the adjoining province to Dauphiny) that Lady Milbanke,
in 1772, first saw the use of the divining rod. In a dry, mountainous region north of
the Durance, the Marquis d'Ansonis had found water by a sourcier, and the Marquis,
whose faith in the divining rod was unbounded, converted Lady Milbanke to his
views after witnessing experiments on his estate.
2 Figuier states that, owing to Bleton having indicated the existence of some
natural oil springs on this expedition, he was engaged on his return by the Govern
ment Department of Mines to search for similar springs in the neighbourhood of
Paris. Figuier adds, the high sanction thus given to Bleton's peculiar faculty shows
the estejm in which he was held, and distinguishes him from the common run of
tourneurs de baguette.
3 Thouvenel thought that the electrical effects, east and west, were associated
with all metals, except iron, which he affirms gives a north and south direction ; as he
associated the latter with terrestrial magnetism, this looks as if the results of his
experiments were often vitiated by involuntary svggeation on Thouvenel's part.
4 There are some other curious observations in this treatise which illustrate
Thouvenel's scientific spirit. Thus, by the aid of Bleton, Thouvenel traced the
source of the hot springs of Bourbon Lancy to a mountainous region abounding in
coal ; not only sm, but a similar result appeared constantly to occur with other hot
springs he examined, and he affirms that eventually their origin was to be found in or
near masses of coal, to chemical changes in which he attributes their high temperature.
Geologists would not, I imagine, endorse this view. Variations in the conductivity of

Contemporary Opinion Adverse to Bleton.
Among those who, after experimenting with Bleton, formed an
unfavourable opinion of his reported powers was the Abbé Mongez, one
of the principal contributors to the articles on Natural Philosophy in
the Paris EncyclopMie ; but, according to Dr. Thouvenel, these ex
periments were intended to be unfavourable, and the experimenters, by
designing a number of ingenious tricks to deceive Bleton, in reality
deceived themselves. Certainly the parti pris of most of the scientific
investigators of Bleton was very evident, and to a large extent vitiated
both the experiments made and the conclusions drawn from them.1
These experiments were made for the most part in the church and
garden of St. Genevieve in the presence of several savants. An account is
given of them in the Journal de Paris for June 16th, 1782, and proces-
verbaux of the experiments are to be found in the Journal de Physique
of that year.2 It is needless to enter into the details ; suffice it to say
that the report concludes by stating that Bleton found water pipes,
springs, etc. on all sides, whereas there were no water pipes and no
springs beneath him. The attempt to explain away this failure, which
Thouvenel made, shows that believers in the divining-rod can be no less
blind and prejudiced than their opponents. Doubtless the experiments
were wholly inconclusive in face of the abundant testimony in Bleton's
favour, some of which we have cited. The writer in the Monthly Review
seems to have given the true explanation of these experiments. Admit
ting that Bleton did fail, he remarks, " this will not appear surprising
when we consider this poor timorous man led about blindfold, harassed,
fatigued, and perplexed with cross questions," and he adds, "even the
Abbé Mongez admits that Bleton was sometimes quite correct." In
fact, as the Reviewer I have already quoted justly remarks :—
" The public have no curiosity to know how far tricks and ingenious
means of deception can go in disconcerting or suspending the exercise of
rocks and the existence of past or present volcanic action,— in a word, the internal heat
of the earth,—are, I believe, the sufficient causes now recognised : but we must
remember our author wrote upwards of a century ago.
1 Ah the able contemporary reviewer, to whom I have already referred, remarks
(Monthly Review, 1782, Vol. LXVII, p. 554), "It is certainly possible that even an
honest zeal for the discovery of imposture or enthusiasm may be exerted in a manner
not perfectly adapted to the discovery of truth. . . . It is observed by all that
Bleton is uncommonly timorous and easily disconcerted, even so far as to suspend his
impressions. This we can well conceive, be his talent ever so real. The very talent
seems to announce a sensibility of nerves that may render him peculiarly susceptible
of perturbation. Who has not seen schoolboys of the most retentive memories lose
the remembrance of the best learned lesson by being intimidated ? "
- I have not seen these, and am indebted to Figuier for the references, who adds
that Guyton de Morveau (a well-known savant) gave some interesting details
about Bleton in the Journal dc Nancy.
272 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part
Bleton's natural talent ; they only desire to know whether he in reality
possesses this talent, when left to himself and allowed the free use of his
faculties." »
But, like all other dowsers, Bleton unquestionably failed at times.
Figuier names four places, and also "dans quelques " autres lieux,"
where wells were dug at the spots indicated by Bleton and no water
found, even when the wells were sunk to a depth lower than had been
estimated by the sourcier. In his able paper on the Divining Rod,
read before the American Institute of Mining Engineers in 1883, Dr.
Rossiter Raymond quotes, —without, however, naming his authority, —
several instances where Bleton failed to find the same spot, after being
blindfolded, that he had indicated previously. These experiments are
probably those to which we have referred on the last page, and com
mented on by the Monthly Review for 1782.2
After the lapse of a century it is instructive to notice how fre
quently the adverse criticism of Bleton arose from his critics assuming
a particular explanation of the lad's sensitiveness, or of the motion of
his rod, and having demolished their theory, they roundly asserted the
boy was a charlatan,—a mode of argument not unknown to scientific
critics of the S.P.R. at the present day.
Thus, Bleton's sensitiveness being supposed to be due to some
electric influence, he was mounted on an insulating stool and his rod
at once ceased to move, but resumed its motion when he was on the
ground. A famous physicist, Charles, who conducted this experiment
a century ago, when Bleton was on the insulating stool, secretly con
nected the lad with a wire to the earth ; still the rod remained passive
although the insulation was destroyed. Whereupon Bleton was openly
denounced as a charlatan by his scientific critic. All that this ex
periment proves is the influence of suggestion on the motion of the
rod. As the lad knew nothing of electricity, he must have been told
that the insulating stool would intercept the power, and so the rod
ceased to move when he was mounted on the glass-legged stool, and it
remained motionless when the insulation was destroyed, as care had
been taken to avoid any suggestion of this reaching Bleton. I made
a precisely similar experiment with a dowser at Waringstown, in
i Monthly Review, Vol. LXVII. p. 555.
* This is the case, I have since ascertained. Dr. Raymond has derived his infor
mation from Kiguier's excellent essay on the Baguette Divinatoire, published a few
years ago, but he does not give the facto quite correctly : moreover, followmg the
example of many others who ignore what they cannot explain, he dismisses in a few
words the abundant testimony that exists as to Bleton's successes, fairly enough given
by Figuier, and emphasises (in fact, exaggerates) any failures that were reported.
Chevreul did just the same ;—see, e.g., p. 113 of his work on the Baguette Divinatoire,
published in 1854.
xxxviii.] On tJœ So-called Divining Rod. 273
Ireland, in 1896 (see previous Report, Vol. XIII., pp. 80 and 246), and
the result was exactly the same ; when the dowser believed he was not
in electrical connection with the earth, his twig ceased to move ; when
he believed he was electrically connected, the forked twig instantly
twisted round, though the electrical condition was the same in both
cases. The object of my experiment was to dispose of the widely
spread but mistaken idea that insulation prevents the motion of the
rod. Even on his own hypothesis, the French experimenter with
Bleton was mistaken; for the theory that some electrical influence
from underground water affects the dowser, and so starts the motion
of the rod, is not touched by insulating the dowser ; as every tyro
knows, standing on a glass-legged stool merely prevents electric con
duction from the earth and does not impair electric induction. This
latter, though a plausible hypothesis, has, however, no experimental
evidence in its favour and need not be here discussed.
Again, the eminent astronomer, Lalande, believed he had conclu
sively demonstrated Bleton was a rogue because he established the
fact that the peculiar rod Bleton employed could be rotated by sleight-
of-hand. The fallacy of this line of argument, though persisted in at the
present day, has already been pointed out (see p. 141, etc). As, how
ever, Lalande is often quoted as having " exposed " Bleton, it is worth
giving in extenso the communication which this famous savant made to
the Journal des Savants, (or Sçavans as it was then spelt) for August,
1782, p. 558. Here is the quotation from the copy in the British
Museum :—
"Un nommé Bléton, né dans un village, près de Grenoble, a prétendu
avoir un propriété extraordinaire de sentir les eaux souterainnes par un
tremblement convulsif. Ce sourcier, ou hydropyrete, plaçoit sur ses doits une
baguette ou une verge de métal, courbeé en arc, et on la voyoit tourner
rapidement. Ce stratagème était plus adroit que celui des sourciers qui
courent les villages, et qui marquent des sources aux paysans, moyennant la
plus mince rétribution. Ceux-ci serrent leur baguette dans leurs mains, et
pour peu qu'on ait envie des regarder, on s'apperçoit facilement qu'il suffit de
ferrer la baguette inégalement ; sa courbure détermine nécessairement un
mouvement de rotation ... il [Dr Thouvenel] n'était plus assez calme

doigts, ne fùt-il que d'une ligne, suffira pour que les extrémités l'emportent
à leur tour, et que le sommet de l'arc vienne en haut. Si on les écarte, à
l'instant le sommet de l'arc descendra, et avec une pareille alternative, le
mouvement peut continuer aussi longtemps qu'on le jugera à propos. Un

Faute d'avoir apperçu ce petit mécanisme.'M. Thouvenel a fait un livre

tourner une baguette pareille dans une assemblée de l'Académie des

10 Juin, 1781, s'est moqué de la nouvelle physique, ainsi qu'on l'avait fait
dans le dernier siècle.
But whilst M. de Lalande clearly demonstrates that slight mus
cular action can move the rod, somewhat as Bleton moved it, he does
not trouble to make any enquiry on the only point of real value, viz.,
whether Bleton was more successful in finding underground water than
chance or shrewd observation would account for. Nevertheless, the

weight of Lalande's authority crushed Thouvenel and his prote'ge"
Bleton. It was taken as a matter of course that the latter was
a clever trickster, who had duped the public. Conjuring books
showed how to work the rod a la Bleton. A book by H. Decremps,
called La Magie devoiUe, published in Paris in 1784-, devotes a lengthy
chapter to this, showing not only how to rotate a slightly curved rod
(held as in Fig. 18) by the quivering of the index fingers, but also how
a manikin can be made to imitate the search for water in this fashion.
This chapter was copied into the Encyclope'dis Methodique for 1792,
and an English translation of Decremps' book was published in 1785
under the title of The Conpirer unmasked . . . with directionsfor
the tricks of the Divining Rod. But the whirligig of time brings its
revenge ; Decremps, whose book was all the vogue a century ago, is
to-day forgotten, and Bleton is now the subject of scientific study.
The rotation of Bleton's nearly straight rod was no doubt due to
the same cause as the twisting of the forked twig of the dowser at the
present day, viz., an involuntary muscular movement arising from
some sub-conscious suggestion (see p. 291); how he, in common with
other dowsers, derived this usually correct suggestion of underground
water, when no one else knew of its presence, is the problem that we
must consider in the sequel to this paper (see Part XIII.).
Thouvenel gives no picture of Bleton nor of his manner of holding
the rod. I have searched through many works in the hope of finding
a picture given by some contemporary writer of the use of this curved
rod, and at last discovered the accompanying drawing given in the
reprint of Amoretti's papers entitled Rhabdomanzia, from the copy of
the German translation of which, published in 1809 (in the Royal
Society Library), Fig. 18 is reproduced. The picture shows the lad
Pennet holding the rod as Bleton did, but the rod appears rather
larger and more curved than Bleton's rod. Thouvenel, and afterwards
Amoretti, experimented with Pennet (see p. 246).
Here I must conclude the report of this remarkable dowser, which
has grown to a length much greater than I anticipated. My apology
must be that it is the first time a full summary of the evidence has
been presented to the English public.

PART XI.
Involuntary Muscular Action and the Motion of the Rod,
Pendule, or other Autoscopk. Motor Automatism.
§ 1. Evidence as to the Involuntary and Uncontrollable
Motion of the Rod.
To an onlooker, who sees a dowser at work for the first time, one
Of the most startling things is the sudden and apparently spontaneous
motion of the forked twig, a motion so vigorous that one of the limbs
of the twig is frequently broken, whilst the dowser is apparently doing
his utmost to restrain its motion. The common explanation of a
sceptical public is that this is merely a trick on the dowser's part to
mystify his dupes, but the evidence I have adduced, both in the
previous and present Report, shows that this view is quite untenable.1
The only other alternative recognised by scientific men is that the
motion of the twig must be caused by some involuntary muscular
action on the part of the dowser. It is true Melancthou and the rest
of the learned world of the sixteenth century thought that the motion
originated in the twig itself, and was a necessary consequence of the
"law of sympathy2," but the learned Jesuit Father Kircher (one of
the founders of experimental science) about the year 1650 showed that
the twig itself was inert, and that in some way the motion was com
municated from the dowser himself 3 to the forked twig. Malebranche
and Lebrun, fifty years after this, urged with resistless logic that
the explanation of the divining rod was to be found in the sport of
good-natured or mischievous devils, " the badinage of demons " ; but
whether these philosophers thought the demons got hold of the end of
the stick and twisted it, or gave supernormal strength and skill to
the dowser, I do not know4. This spirit theory, apparently, is the
view of some people at the present day. Spirits may swarm in the
1 1 am referring to honest dowsers ; impostors may exist here as elsewhere.
3 Every age has its fashionable fetishes, or idola theatri; this " law of sympathy"
was a notable idol of the learned world in the 16th and 17th centuries. The move
ment of the rod to hidden veins of metal or water was supposed to be due to the
" sympathy " between certain kinds of wood and metals, etc.
3 See Kircher's Magnes sivc de Arte Magnctica (1640), p. 724, and his later work,
Mundus Subterraneiu, Vol. II., p. 200.
4 Malebranche refers Lebrun to both St. Augustine and Porphyry in support of
his view that the devils cannot be always at work tempting mankind, but must have
moments of relaxation like human beings ! Hence come their little jokes in table
rapping, opening doors, etc., so Porphyry thinks. (See Lettres qui dicouvrent /'illusion
del philosophes $ur la baguette. Paris, 1693, p. 230, et seq.)
xxxviii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 277
neighbourhood of mediums and dowsers, only it needs a good deal of
evidence to prove it, and it will be some time before science will accept
any evidence of that kind. Hence the only alternative before us is
that some involuntary and more or less unconscious muscular action
on the dowser's part causes the twig to turn and sometimes break.
In the previous Report I have discussed this question (see pp. 243
and 244) and shown that the curious muscular spasm, which probably
causes the motion of the rod, is certainly involuntary, and,—when the
rod is held as some dowsers hold it,—cannot be intentionally imitated
by a conscious effort, without considerable skill in legerdemain. To
this statement the only criticism I have received is from those who
maintain that this is an inadequate explanation, and that the evidence
points to some power beyond involuntary muscular action. Here is
the view of that distinguished naturalist and acute observer, Dr.
A. R. Wallace, F.R.S., who writes to me as follows :—
If the rod does move wholly by muscular action, it does not at all affect
the power of the dowser in finding water, —but the fact should be proved.
To me, the evidence you adduce shows that it is not muscular action, and if
this can be proved it, of course, places the dowser in the rank of a physical
" medium," which I have always held him to be. If the two facts you state
are facts : (1) That the motion of the rod cannot be intentionally produced
(by any novice) without visible muscular action of an energetic kind ; and
(2) that in an outsider's hands, holding the rod for the first time, it will
often move if the dowser holds his wrists, and with no conscious, and little
visible, muscular action on the experimenter's part,—then it follows that
the motion is not produced by muscular action at all, but is a physical
phenomenon analogous to hundreds of others occurring in the presence of
"mediums."
• I think you should have said : "The obvions explanation, of course, is
that the rod is moved by the hands of the operator, acting consciously or
unconsciously. There are, however, many difficulties in the way of this
view, and many facts which seem directly opposed to it." After which your
various statements would follow naturally. Now, they seem to me to be in
the nature of a non sequitur ! . . .
Of course, I am a confirmed lunatic in these matters, so excuse the ravings
Of a lunatic, but sincere, friend, AmMB R WallaC£
All that Mr. Wallace writes is worth attention ; it would certainly
have been wiser on my part, in the last Report, to have used the words
he suggests rather than the more dogmatic phrase I employed. Other
correspondents have also urged that muscular action, whether conscious
or unconscious, is an insufficient explanation of the phenomena actually
observed. In the Journal of the S. P. R. for December, 1897, Mr.
E. T. Bennett cites some of the evidence I gave in the previous Report
in support of this view. Mr. Bennett urges, with much cogency, that
as Faraday's explanation of table-turning being due to involuntary
278 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part
muscular action is now recognised as inadequate to cover all the
phenomena of this kind, so in like manner this explanation fails to
cover all the cases of the twisting of the divining rod, and hence some
other cause, external to the dowser, is probably at work. There is no
doubt some force in Mr. Bennett's argument, to which I replied in the
same number of the Journal.
The descriptions given by different observers are so similar that
we may take them as correct, and certainly it would seem that no
conscious muscular action could produce the effects described. Mr.
Bennett (Journal S.P.R., December, 1897) therefore asks, "Have we
any grounds which justify us in attributing to unconscious muscular
action, physical effects which it is beyond the power of conscious
muscular action to produce 1 " My reply is : in hypnosis, somnambulism,
hysteria, etc., subjects can perform muscular feats impossible to them
in their normal self-conscious state. Whatever tends to concentrate
muscular action upon one single dominant idea enables the subject to
accomplish what otherwise he could not do. Moreover known causes
must be assumed as operative until they are proved to be inadequate.
The two facts, (1) and (2), named by Mr. A. R. Wallace in his letter,
are, however, sometimes disputed, and it is therefore desirable to cite
some of the facts already given and add further information, from
different witnesses, on these two points.
The violence of the motion of the rod is shown in numerous cases
I quoted in the previous Report. Thus on p. 7, Mr. Enys, F.G.S., who
is an amateur dowser, states " the rod broke short off in front of my
hands, and did so a second time in the same place," i.e., where under
ground water existed. On p. 26, Miss Grantham (daughter of Judge
Grantham), describing what occurred with the Rev. J. Blunt, another
amateur dowser, states " so strong was the impulse, that we found
unless Mr. B. relaxed his hold, the twig broke off near his fingers."
Lady Milbanke, also an amateur dowser, had the same experience,
p. 42.1 Mr. Percy Clive states, on p. 35, that when he held the rod
and Mullins put his hands on his wrists, the rod " twisted round in
my hands with such force that when I held it tight it broke." Mr.
Cecil Woolley, of Lincoln, the agent to Trinity College, Cambridge,
states, on p. 242, that the late J. Mullins having gone over the ground
and indicated water in one spot, " I took the twig in my own hands
and went over the same spot with no result. He (J. Mullins) then took
hold of my wrists without touching the twig himself and when we
together walked over the same place, the twig turned up in my hands.
This was, I suppose, caused by muscular action on my part, but if so, it
1 The pages in this paragraph all refer to the previous Report, iVoceedinj/s
S.P.R., Vol. XIII.
xxxviii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 279
was certainly, as far as I was concerned, perfectly unconscious action.
My mental attitude was one of neutrality ! " Lord Burton makes a
very similar statement, p. 103. Mr. Budd, a geologist, describes what
occurred with Mullins when he came over underground water at
"Waterford. He writes, p. 110, " Mullins held the forked twig between
his second and third fingers as if you were going to write, the point of
the fork downwards. At No. 1 [i.e., over the spot where a large
supply of underground water was found] the point lifted itself up,
until it turned over backwards and twisted itself until it broke . . .
The clerks then held [another forked twig] with him, and held his
hands ; always the same effect." In another place, seeing the frantic
motion of the twig when Mullins came over underground water, a
gentleman tried to stop its motion by gripping the twig in two places
with smiths' tongs, " one pair securing the tips and the other the fork,
but the contortions still went on between the points held," p. 87,
and so on.
In the present Report numerous independent witnesses of unim
peachable integrity and some with high scientific attainments testify
to the same class of facts, viz. :—(1) the automatic and apparently
irresistible motion of the twig in the hands often of a complete
novice, and (2) that, when the forked twig does not move in a person's
hands, if the dowser takes one limb of the twig, or even places his
hand on the wrist of the insensitive person, the previously inert twig
now turns vigorously and often breaks in two in the effort to resist its
motion. As regards (1), see the letter from the President of the
Royal Geological Society of Cornwall on p. 219,1 who states that the
clerk of his Parish Council, on finding the rod suddenly twist in his
hands, called out, " It is alive, sir, it is alive ! " Mr. Enys adds :
" This exactly describes the sensation when the rod moves." Mr.
Dixon, a large fruit-grower in California, on p. 250 states : " I held
the stick as tight as I could to prevent its moving, but it twisted right
round." Mr. Denison, of the Toronto Meteorological Observatory, on
p. 206, gives a careful record of the violent twisting of a forked plum
stick or bent wire used as a divining rod by an amateur dowser. Mr.
Bennett, of Oxford, on p. 176, refers to the frantic motion and
ultimate breaking of the twig " held firmly " in the dowser's hands.
Other similar cases will have been noted by the careful reader. As
regards (2), see Mr. Morton's letter to The Engineer given on p. 172 ;
Mr. Morton found the rod would not move in his hands, but when the
late John Mullins, the dowser, "laid his hands on my wrists and
grasped them firmly, then the twig instantly began to turn and con
tinued turning till he removed his hands. He never touched the twig
1 The pages in this paragraph refer to the present Report.
280 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part
while it was in my hands." Mr. Montague Price, in his letter on
p. 181, states :—
I held one side of the forked rod myself and the "diviner" the other, and
when we came to water [alleged underground water] the strain was so great
on my fingers I was obliged to ask him to stop. From the position of the
rod it was absolutely impossible for him to produce the pressure, which
increased with the strength of the stream.
Mr. Denison, of Toronto, states, on p. 206, that his friend " Mrs.
Harris tried without any result ; but when Mr. H. [who was an
amateur dowser] grasped her wrists, as she approached the spring, the
rod turned forcibly," and so on.
The usual practice, after watching a dowser at work, is for some
of the onlookers to try if the forked twig will move in their hands.
Generally speaking, one or more, out of perhaps ten or twelve persons,
discover to their astonishment that the twig curls up in their hands
at the same places at which it did with the dowser. Here is such
an experience. Mrs. Hollands writes to me as follows :—
Dene Park, Tonbridge, October 9th, 1899.
In answer to your note of inquiry about the divining rod, the whole
thing is rather a long story, but the practical result of the water dowser's
visit was to find water which now supplies the house. One of my daughters
found she had the strange power which moves the divining rod, and it works
for her now quickly over any spring. It is most interesting, as you can feel
the rod if you take one side of it and take one of her hands, she holding the
other end of the rod—it struggles up, and would break off altogether if you
did not allow it to move. My daughter has since found several springs on
the estate, where we have sunk wells. They have stood us in very good
stead these last dry seasons. ,» TT
J Minnie Hollands.
A similar experience is given by Miss M. Craigie Halkett, who
published some excellent photographs of a dowser at work in Sketch
for August 23rd, 1899. Miss Halkett writes to me as follows :—
Lauriston, New Eltham, Kent, September 8th, 1899.
The man depicted in the photographs is not a water-finder by profession.
He is a tenant farmer residing at Catcott, a village near Bridgwater, and
merely exercises the art to oblige his neighbours. Several of the country
people in this neighbourhood (Somerset) have the gift. It has never been
known to fail.
Personally, I was rather sceptical on the subject, but was converted by
the stick turning in my hands when standing over a spring. There were
about six persons present at the time ; all tried it, but it would turn for no
one excepting the man in the picture and myself. I experienced a sort of
tingling sensation in my arms and wrists, but otherwise was quite unaware
when the forked stick began to turn, it seemed to go over so quickly.

Miss Halkett does not say how she knew she was " standing over
a spring " when the twig turned in her hands : this statement is very
characteristic of many others that have reached me.
I received the following from a Civil Engineer, Mr. J. W. Parry,
who also sent me an interesting article he had written on water-finding,
which appeared in the Pioneer of India :—
19, Southmoor Road, Oxford, Noeember 2nd, 1898.
I have read with much interest your work on " dowsing " in the Psychical
Research Society. I was a sceptic, but after reading the 140 cases you
mention, it is quite impossible to doubt any longer. I was lately at Padstow,
Cornwall, where the following authenticated case occurred which you might
like to verify.
It appears a dowser was lately sent for, as some waterworks were
projected. The squire, Mr. Prideaux-Brune, and his two daughters came
to see the operations of the divining rod . On a spot being indicated by the
dowser, one of the young ladies said, " Oh ! let me see if I can do it."
Unfortunately, she had not the gift, nor had her sister. Squire Prideaux-
Brune, then taking the twig, walked back a few paces. On passing the spot
his arms shook violently, and would not be controlled. The young ladies
were laughingly sceptical, and said, " Oh ! papa, you are humbugging."
He replied, " I am doing nothing of the kind, and can't help my arms
shaking," or words to that effect.
You do not mention any cases as occurring in India, where there is a
a good deal of so-called divining. I have seen diviners lying naked with their
ears to the ground, pretending that they could hear the subterranean water.
Don't you think that's somewhat beyond our ken, even though the Asiatic
has marvellously sensitive organs of hearing on certain occasions 1
J. W. Parry,
Late Executive Engineer, Indian State Railways.
I wrote to Mr. Prideaux-Brune, who is a Deputy-Lieutenant and
J.P. for the county, and received the following reply : —
Prideaux Place, Padstow, Cornwall, February 11th, 1899.
Some months ago Messrs. Merryweather sent a diviner here, so I
witnessed his extraordinary powers. I myself manifested a slight power, and
when the diviner held my wrists it was intensified—one man, a non-believer,
was as successful as the diviner. Another man attempted, and was not in
the slightest degree affected, even when the diviner held his wrists. A very
strong man tried to wrest this rod from the diviner's hands without success,
and, finally, in the struggle the rod broke. In my own case I felt the
muscles in my arm between the hand and the elbow for a day or two
affected in the same way as if I had a slight electric shock.
Charles G. Prideaux-Brune.
In this case, as in the former, there is no evidence to show that the
involuntary motion of the " rod " had any connection with the near
ness of underground water.
282 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part
I will now cite some evidence that shows (1) how little visible mus
cular action there is when the twig moves in the hands of a dowser; e.g.,
Mr. A. Lang says (see below) he "could detect no muscular action ;" and
further (2) how the amateur in whose hands the twig turns believes
he is exerting his will and muscular force to prevent its motion.
In Longman's Magazine (November, 1897) Mr. A. Lang writes :—
I have thrice been with amateurs, in whose hands a twig twisted over
subterranean water. One was a very learned professor of the Greek language,
who, having seen the thing done by a water-finder, found that he had the
same faculty. The second was a land bailiff, who had discovered his gift in
the same way, and employed it for his own purposes on his employer's estate.
. . . The third was a lady, whose mother had the faculty, and found her
own well by using it. I tried, in company with each of the three. With the
two men I failed—my twig would not turn where theirs turned. It did twist
where the lady's twisted, and the sensation was curious ["just as if the
rod were alive," Mr. Lang adds in writing to me] ; but I am inclined to
fancy that the mere resistance and spring of the wood caused it to jerk itself
upward at one spot, though I cannot say why it failed to do so at other spots.
The bailiff tried holding my wrists while I held the twig, but without effect.
I held his fingers, when the twig writhed in his hands, but could detect no
muscular action on his part. In no case did we dig, or make any attempt
to find water where the twigs twisted ; all we were able to do was to
examine the action of the twig ; active at certain spots, passive at others.
The forked twig is so held that you resist its natural spring. Of course, no
twig at all is used by some water-finders, who rely on their sensations
merely, and speak of the twig as a mere index or stage property.
In Sir Herbert Maxwell's pleasant book of sport and natural history,
Memories of the Months, is an account of experiments with Mullins, a
professional, and not a man of education. Mullins had worked at Middleton,
and Lord Jersey ' ' had been not only gratified, but astonished at his success."
Experiments were next made at Osterley, before scientific characters . . .
Mullins's rod, in this case, "twisted so violently that, when he held it tight,
it broke in his hand." He said that he had a shivering along his spine on
these occasions. When he stood on a plate of thick glass the rod did not
twist, which he attributed to the non-conducting of electricity. An
uneducated man always chatters about electricity. The glass acted, if at
all, byway of negative "suggestion." Mullins was then blindfolded, but
here Sir James Crichton-Browne objected that the blindfolding was
inadequate. The researches of the Psychical Society have proved (in other
experiments) that practically no blindfolding is adequate, or, at least, is
beyond suspicion. Sir James wanted to introduce cotton wool. Mullins said,
"Don't you believe my word ? " Sir James replied, " I believe nothing but
what I see " (not a very scientific posture, I fear), and Mullins would not
play any longer. He was an uneducated man ; he did not understand the
position ; he took Sir James's agnosticism as a personal affront, and so the
matter ended. Nevertheless, Sir Herbert says, "were I in straits to find
water, I should employ without hesitation a professional water-finder—rod
and all—if there remains one as successful as Mullins was."
Xxxviii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 283
Practically the dowser finds water in a paying ratio of successes over
failures. How he finds it he probably does not know himself. I do not
doubt that the rod is wagged (where the finder is honest) by unconscious
muscular action, as in "table-turning." So we are left at largo in that
cheerful and luminous field of inquiry, the Philosophy of the Unconscious,
or Subconscious. Some indication, through the normal senses perhaps, or
through some unexplored sense, reaches the successful finder, and, uncon
sciously obedient to this hint, he unconsciously uses his muscles and wags
the stick. I conceive that to be the humour of it, but a large number of
experiments is needed before one can even raise a good presumption in
favour of the hypothesis.
The following letter which Dr. Hodgson has sent me is an illus
tration of the involuntary and apparently uncontrollable motion of
the rod in the hands of a mining engineer, who tried it for the first
time :—
350, East 69th Street, New York, July 23rd, 1892.
I see a paper on the diviniDg rod in Vol. II. of your Proceedings, and
would bring to your notice a curious experience of mine with regard to this
which I published in the Engineering and Mining Journal of December 9th,
1876, which created quite a discussion in that journal.
"I was much interested in that part of a lecture on Mining by Professor
W. Smyth, F.R.S., of the Royal School of Mines, London, relating to the use
of the divining rod for finding mineral veins or subterranean springs of water,
and published in your journal of September 9th. Because a reason cannot
be given for an alleged phenomenon is no cause why it should not exist, or
if existing, why it should not be inquired into. Most of the discoveries of
science would not have been made, had inexplicable phenomena been set
aside as being unworthy of attention because no reason could be given for
them at the time when first observed.
"I have heard of the Cornish Witch,hazel from my childhood, but
always thought it a fable till one day in the woods of Pennsylvania one of
my men mentioned that springs could be found by means of a forked switch
of any kind of fresh cut hard wood. I laughed at the idea, but he insisted,
so I made a trial by standing astride a small brook, one branch of the fork
in each hand, the stem standing out horizontally. What was my amazement
to find that the latter bent slowly down with a force I was entirely unable,
to counteract. The experiment was quite .sufficient to make me credit all
that had been attested of the divining rod, though I have never tried it
over mineral veins.
" Professor Smyth says that all persons are not able to produce the
effect, which may very well be, just as Spiritualists pretend that some
persons are naturally more adapted to act as mediums than others. And
may not the power exerted by them on chairs and tables have some con
nection with the force manifested by means of the divining rod ? Unless,
indeed, the force which makes the twig bend be caused by the vital power
of the person holding it. These, however, are the very questions to be
solved, should a competent person take them up. s
284 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part
"I am glad to see that so distinguished a man as Professor Smyth has
the courage to assert his belief iti what it is the fashion to consider as an
exploded fallacy by persons who have never tried it or made proper inquiries
regarding it."
That some unknown force is at work I am confident. It seems
melancholy that the very men who pooh-pooh such phenomena merely
because they cannot explain them, are of the class generally called scientific.
D. COGHLaN.
Dr. Hodgson wrote to Mr. Coghlan suggesting that unconscious
muscular action was the probable cause of the motion of the rod ; Mr.
Coghlan replies as follows :—
350, East 69th Street, New York, Jidy 29</i, 1892.
Your favour of yesterday received. In answer to your suggestion that my
own unconscious muscular force caused the bending of the rod, I can answer
decisively, No !
AVhen I said to my informant regarding the phenomenon that I could by
my muscular exertion prevent the bending, he expressed the situation
forcibly by saying the bark of the twig would be first twisted off. Of course
in this he exaggerated, but still it expressed, rather forcibly to be sure, the
tendency of the twig's point downwards. The switch is held with the palms
of the hand turned upward and the branches of the fork grasped firmly, the
main stem projecting horizontally. I cannot conceive how any unconscious
muscular action could cause the horizontal stem to become vertical, which
position is attained by a twisting of the fibres of the wood.
1 have lately tried the same experiment under what I considered similar
circumstances, but failed completely, whether owing to the wood used not
being of the proper kind, (for you may remember that in Cornwall they
suppose the witch-hazel the proper thing to use in searching for mineral
veins), or whether owing to decay of nervous power on my part through age, I
€M,not telh D. Coghlan.
The opinion so emphatically expressed by Mr. Coghlan, that the
motion of the rod was not due to any muscular action, conscious or un
conscious, on his part is shared by nearly all who find the rod twist in
their hands. Here, for example, is one of numerous instances I might
cite. In a letter published in the Standard newspaper for January 2nd,
1 889, Mr. W. Bell, of East-Lyss, Petersfield, states that after seeing a
dowser at work, he tried the forked twig himself and to his utter amaze
ment, when he came near the spot at which the twig moved with the
dowser, he saw the point bend forward and then it suddenly turned
down towards the ground as he crossed the spot. He adds :—
Some force independent of my will, and acting contrary to my muscular
resistance, drew the point of the twig towards the earth. Of this I am as
firmly convinced as I am that the sun rose yesterday. It was not a matter
in which I could have been self-deceived, and the same effects could not be
produced by trickery [voluntary effort is no doubt meant].
xxxviii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 285
In the same number of the Standard a professional dowser, J.
Blanchard, of Wisbech, writes to say that he has " proved the rod is
not moved by the involuntary action of mental expectancy on the
muscles of the performer " (!), by putting on a pair of gloves, when the
rod ceases to move. No doubt the rod would be more difficult to
manipulate, whether voluntarily or otherwise, with gloves on. But all
these results, however, like the standing on insulating supports, etc.,
are mainly due to what Mr. A. Lang, in the passage just quoted, calls
" negative suggestion." That is to say, anything which gives rise to a
sub-conscious suggestion determines the motion or arrest of the rod.
In connection with this I may cite the distinguished anthropo
logist, Dr. E. B. Tylor, F.R.S., who, in a lecture delivered at Oxford in
1883, relates his experience with the divining rod as follows :—
"I happened to be staying at a friend's house in the Mendip district,
where it [the divining-rod] is still used by well-sinkers and miners, and at
my request a regular practitioner was sent for. ... It does not appear that
he fraudulently moves the rod, but my sensations led me to agree with
Chevreul that the slight movements of the hands are unconsciously guided
to accumulate into impulses sufficient to cause the twig to dip or rise. I
noticed that when I could allow my attention to stray, the rod would from
time to time move in my hands in a way so lifelike that an uneducated
person might well suppose the movement to be spontaneous. It is hardly
necessary to say that the rod always moves where the bearer's mind suggests
an object." [Dr. Tylor then gives an amusing illustration on this point :
the dowser having stated the rod always moved when he reached the main
spring underground, the rod also moved over a watch, the dowser suggesting
that it did so because it was over the mainspring of the watch ; his mind,
Dr. Tylor remarks, being controlled by the verbal association into a d«lusive
analogy of effects] (Nature, May 17th, 1883, p. 58).
§ 2. Evidence that the Motion of the Rod is due to Unconscious
Muscular Action.
We will now pass on to evidence which shows that the motion of
the rod i3 really due to the muscular action of the dowser, notwith
standing that there are certain positions in which the rod is held
where it seems to be impossible for the dowser to move it. Such, for
example, as that shown in the plate on page 134, in my previous
Report, where the dowser, Stone, is shown holding a thick forked rod
depending from the forefinger, second finger, and thumb of each
hand. Mr. Stone himself asserts that there is no movement of his
fingers, and that he holds the rod in this way because it cannot be
moved by the dowser ; but a careful eye-witness, Mr. R. J. Charleton,
writes to me as follows :—
I must contradict the assertion that no movement of Mr. Stone's fingers
could be detected whilst he is using the divining rod. I watched him most
286 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part
closely, and distinctly noticed that his forefingers, second fingers and
thumbs, between which he held the ends of the forked stick, were strongly
compressed upon the pliant wood. At the same time there was an inward
twisting action of the fingers which had the effect of raising the apex of the
rod. Tremendous muscular force was apparently being used, to such an
extent, in fact, that the operator's hands became quite swollen and tremulous
when he had completed his experiments. I have myself been able to verify
this explanation in my own person repeatedly, though I could not move
such thick twigs as Mr.. Stone employs, but his muscular development is
greater than mine and ho is in constant practice.
I, too, watched Mr. Stone carefully in his use of the forked rod.
In the Carrigoona experiments, the sudden leaping up, as it were, of
the twig when Mr. Stone came to the position No. 1 in Fig. 3 was
most remarkable, the more so considering the way the twig was held.
There was evidently some muscular spasm, as Mr. Charleton says, but
it was obviously involuntary, and neither I nor a friend who was with
me could imitate the action by any conscious exertion on our part.
But perhaps the best testimony is afforded by the following letter
I received from Mr. J. F. Young, of Llanelly, a most successful
amateur dowser, animated by a truly scientific spirit. Mr. Young
was at first inclined to think that the movement of the rod was
entirely spontaneous and quite independent of the dowser, but after I
had drawn his attention to the matter, he writes as follows : " I see
that the motion of the rod, which is always held in tension by the
water-finder, is really due to unconscious muscular action ; this is
specially noticeable with a watch-spring which I generally employ.
In fact, I am so convinced in this matter, after endless experiments,
that I defy any one to prove the contrary." A Somersetshire incum
bent, writing in Notes and Queries,1 gives corroborative testimony,
and states that, when holding the rod in the same way as the pro
fessional dowser he employed, " the harder I grasped the stick to
prevent it turning, the more it turned, till at last it broke in two, and
hurt /he hand that held it."
But this is no new explanation of the motion of the rod, for the
fullest and best account of its motion,—based upon experimental
evidence, —is given by the American writer to whom I have already
referred, Mr. Emerson, in the pages of the American Journal of Science
(SUliman's Journal) for 1826. The writer shows how startling and
apparently miraculous is the sudden motion of the rod, in the hands of
a good water-finder, —and remarks, if there be a fraud, the diviners are
themselves the dup.°s. It is true, he goes on to say, that nearly every
one can urge it to turn iu a fashion, but only in the hands of a very
few does it move, not only without urging, but contrary to their best
i Series 1, Vol. X. (1854), p. 155.
xxxviii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 287
efforts. He himself tried again and again, but failed. At last, one
day, watching a young and successful diviner, he noticed the peculiar
spirit and air of determination with which he handled the rod.
Hoping to catch his lively manner [Mr. Emerson says] I took the rod
and tried my hand again. When I got to the bank of the rivulet the rod
began to move, and I could not restrain it. He who for the first time in his
life has received an electric shock will recognise the sensation which I
experienced when I felt the limbs of the rod crawling round, and saw the
point turning down in spite of every effort my clenched hands could make
to restrain it. In this contest between myself and the rod the bark was
stripped off the twig. The secret appeared to be to hold the rod in a
spirited manner [by this he apparently means a determined and confident,
not a weak and hesitating, manner], for since then the rod has never failed
to move in my hands, nor in the hands of those I have instructed.
Mr. Emerson then gives directions how to hold the rod in order to
exhibit its startling motion ; if the diviner releases his firm grasp, he
goes on to say :—
The rod can no more turn than an unbent bow can throw an arrow.
By grasping the forked rod smartly the bow is strained and then if the rod
be pliant and the hands moist, it will creep round slowly and mysteriously.
But if the rod be large, its motion when smartly bent may become
ungovernable. The direction of the motion of the rod forwards or back
wards depends on whether the wrists are allowed to turn to their natural
position or are slightly more strained outwards.
Two large goose quills tied together at their tips, or two pieces of
whalebone similarly fastened and held as a divining rod, Mr. Emerson
found to work quite as well, or even better, than a forked twig. This
part of Mr. Emerson's paper is excellent, but of course explains
nothing more than the apparently spontaneous and vigorous motion
of the rod.1
Professor Wadsworth, of Michigan University, has recently pub
lished a letter in Nature- giving a similar explanation of the motion
1 Mr. Thos. Blashill, F.R.I.B.A. (late superintendent architect of the London
County Council) has sent me a lengthy and careful analysis of the illustrations given
in my previous Report, showing the method of holding the rod, and he concludes
that, " In every case in which the rod is shown in the hands of the water-finder,
while he is actually searching for water, the two prongs of the fork are bent, some
times slightly but often very considerably,'' and he infers that this bending accounts
for the motion of tho rod. No doubt a considerable strain is put on the forked rod
by some professional dowsers, but not by all ; the explanation of the motion of the
rod is not quite so easy as Mr. Blashill and others who have not themselves seen it in
use imagine. Even Mr. Emerson's and Mr. Young's statement that the rod is always
held in a state of strain is not invariably true. Moreover the rod used by Bleton and
others a century ago simply reste.d on the two forefingers : we shall deal with this in
the sequel.

of the twig to that given by Emerson seventy years previously. It is
amusing to see how entirely ignorant of the whole subject are many
scientific men who are ready to instruct us. Professor Wadsworth
says, in concluding his letter :—
The whole secret of the divining-rod seems to lie in its position in the
hands of the operator, and in his voluntarily or involuntarily increasing the
closeness of his grasp on the two ends of the branches forming the fork.
If the foregoing conditions are fulfilled, the twig will always bend down—
water or no water, mineral or no mineral. Any one can be an operator, and
any material can be used for the instrument, provided the limbs forming the
fork are sufficiently tough and flexible.
As I have said, any one can twist the rod if it is held in a
particular manner, but I am afraid Professor Wadsworth's contri
bution can hardly be said to have solved " the whole secret of
the divining rod."
Just as a pen or pencil registers conscious acts of the brain by
small muscular motions of the fingers, so the divining rod indicates
sub-conscious acts of the brain by small and usually involuntary and in
sensible muscular motions on the part of the so-called diviner. It is not
necessary to call the man who writes or who reads a letter "a diviner,"
though he is so in a sense, and it is equally unnecessary to call a man
" a diviner " who employs a forked stick to indicate the twitching of
the muscles of his lower arm. Though the honest dowser himself
declares he does not move the forked twig, this is simply a proof that
the motion is to him both involuntary and unconscious. It is needless
to labour this point, but it may be worth while to dispose of it once
for all.
How, ask several correspondents, can a man move a stick, the
motion of which he is consciously resisting ? The muscles, it is urged,
cannot simultaneously be doing opposite things. It certainly looks
mysterious, but it is not really so to the trained physiologist. Through
the kindness of my friend, Dr. Purser, Professor of Physiology at
Trinity College, Dublin, I have been able to have this question tested
in the person of an amateur dowser, an Irish gentleman, to whom I
have already referred, Mr. J. H. Jones, who was good enough to allow
himself to be made the subject of experiment in the grounds of
Trinity College, Dublin. Dr. Purser subsequently wrote to me as
follows :— T c D^ Decemfier 19Wli 1897
The interview with Mr. Jones was held under rather unfavourable circum
stances, owing to the storm, but I think I was able to see the movement by
which the turning of the stick is effected. .
The movements by which the stick is turned are :—(1) A rotation of the
forearms, or one of them ; (2) a flexion of the inner fingers, by which tho
xxxviii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 289
stick is made a lever of the first order with very short distance between the
fulcrum and the power, or perhaps a lever of the third order. It was
impossible to follow the movements when the stick was rapidly twirled, or
when Mr. Jones walked rapidly and the rod suddenly turned and he said :
"There is water here." But when he stood over the place where he said
underground water existed, and professed to struggle against the motion of
the stick, the movement was evident, and I had no difficulty in imitating
the movements myself, although, of course, not so dexterously as Mr. Jones
did. As to whether the movements are conscious or unconscious I cannot
express any opinion,—but that the stick is moved by the muscles of the
arm and not by any occult influence cannot be doubted, I think, by any
reasonable being. F pDBSER
To the lay reader, no doubt, there is considerable difficulty in under
standing how this explanation covers all the facts, if such cases as those
I have quoted earlier are correctly described. The breaking of the
forked twig can only be accomplished by a rigid grasp of one of the
forks, and a rotation of the twig by the hand holding the other fork.
This is probably what occurs ;—the skill and strength required to do
this, without much visible motion of the hand, being as much beyond
the conscious effort of the dowser as the feats of a somnambulist or
hypnotised person are beyond the power of the same person in his
normal state ; and the physiological explanation is probably much the
same in the two cases, namely, an automatic concentration and dis
charge of most of the available nervous energy of the individual into
one narrow channel. Only a trained anatomist is competent to give
an opinion on this question, for he knows which muscles to observe,
whilst the startling effects of auto-suggestion are well known to
physiologists.
In support of this view I will here quote an extract from the report
of a small committee who, in 1894, critically examined a dowser at
work. The committee of investigation consisted of the pathologist
and the assistant physician of one of the Bristol hospitals, Mr. Mole,
F.R.C.S., and Dr. F. H. Edgeworth,—the latter having made neurology
a special study—and the Rev. R. A. Chudleigh, of West Parley
Rectory, Wimborne, Dorset. Mr. Chudleigh, who acted as reporter,
though not an M.D., has made a life-long study of both physiology and
pathology.1 The committee were therefore well qualified. They were
fortunate in securing the co-operation of a skilful amateur dowser, who
placed himself, as well as his estate (on the border of the Mendips),
entirely at their service. In the course of a lengthy report, Mr.
Chudleigh says : " If there be one thing which is perfectly clear, it is

and have been much struck with his true scientific habit of mind and wide range of
knowledge.
Y
290 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part
that the movement of the wand is due to an unconscious muscular
contraction, just like other muscular contractions, except that it is
unconscious." Albeit, he goes on to say, " The violent tremor which
convulsed the over-strained arm is itself enough to suggest witchcraft
to an ordinary spectator, and yet I am sure that it is nothing more
than what is known as muscle-clonus." Anatomical reasons are then
given to account for the sudden violent motion of the rod, and the
report continues : " A precisely analogous phenomenon is seen in those
cases where a spinal wound or a spinal poison throws the whole body
into universal spasm ; but the flexors master the extensors and the
back muscles overpower the front ones, the result being the frightful
and well-known pose called opisthotonus." The writer then points
out that the sudden spontaneous tension of the muscles of the arms
which occur when the dowser believes himself to be over a spring is
probably due to auto-suggestion ; "this auto-suggestion makes a diviner
positively tetanic when he knows or thinks that water is present."1
The symptoms described in the foregoing were more strikingly
exhibited by the late Mr. W. Scott Lawrence than by most other
dowsers ; a vivid description is given by an eye-witness on p. 69 of
the previous Report.8
Severe muscular spasm, as is well known, can be caused by sugges
tion in hypnotic subjects. In HittelFs Somnambulism and Cramp,
New York, 1860, muscular contractions are described as caused by
auto-suggestion—e.g., " If Miss A. ventured to eat with a silver spoon,
the muscles of the mouth soon became rigid, etc." Every physician is
acquainted with cases where often alarming muscular spasm, as of the
glottis, is due to purely ideo-motor action. " The idea of a particular
motion," as the physiologist Miiller long ago remarked, " determines
the current of nervous action towards the necessary muscles, and
gives rise to the motion independently of the will." Dr. Edgeworth
sends me an instance of this under his care at the Bristol Infirmary.
He writes :—
A man wlio had an affection of the spinal cord was given mercury
by injections into his arm. His legs (the part affected) got well, but he
developed the idea that his arm had been poisoned, and as a result has a

3 When Lawrence came over a place where he asserted an underground spring
existed—and which proved true on sinking a well at the spot,—the writer states :—
" I can only describe the antics of that twig as a pitched battle between itself and
him ! It twisted, it knocked about, it contracted and contorted the muscles of his
hands and arms, it wriggled, and fought, and kicked, until it snapped in two—and
then—what made it painful to watch until I got used to it, the old man reeled, and
clutched hold of any one nearest to him for a few moments. It evidently exhausts
him very much, though afterwards I asked him what effect it had on him, and he
said it only made his heart beat most violently."—Letter to Mr. W. Whitaker, F.R.S.

hysterical paralysis of the injected arm. These auto-suggestions are very
difficult to remove. . . . In my opinion they afford an explanation of the
motion of the " divining rod."
F. H. Edgeworth.
§ 3. Consideration of Bleton's Motor-Automatism.
It may be argued by some readers that the foregoing explanation
of the motion of the forked twig cannot apply to the singular and
rapid rotation of the slightly curved rod used fey Bleton. Certainly
the facts, as carefully narrated by Dr. Thouvenel on pp. 53-76 of his
first Me'moire, were very curious and are worth attention.
In the first place it is wholly improbable that the rotation of
Bleton's baguette, any more than the twisting of the forked twig by
the dowsers of to-day, was due to any conscious muscular effort on the
part of the sourcier or water-finder. In fact, if the reader will try to
rotate a slightly curved stick resting on his forefingers, as shown in
Fig. 18, p. 274, he will realise how difficult it is to accomplish, keep
ing, withal, his hands and arms as far as possible motionless. But
difficult as it is to imitate this motion, it is not impossible, as Lalande
showed in the passage I have quoted on p. 273, though I have no
doubt the attempt to imitate the rotation was a very clumsy one.
For the effects of involuntary muscular action are surprisingly difficult
to imitate by voluntary effort. That some muscular action really took
place on Bleton's part is seen from Thouvenel's own admission, opposed
as he was to this idea. On p. 114 of his first Me'moire, he says, in a
passage I will translate :—
I have perceived several times that the approach of the arms and a
certain tour de main on the part of the sourcier [Bleton] contributed to
give the baguette its first impulse of rotation over feeble springs.
It is true that he does not notice this at other times : but a careful
observer (M. le Comte de M ) quoted by Thouvenel on p. 188 of
his Me'moire, says :—
I have reason to suspect that [the motion of] the baguette is a little
aided by an almost insensible movement of the shoulder.
Albeit the Count himself tried without success to turn the baguette
at a spot where it moved with Bleton. Thouvenel tells us Bleton
judged with singular accuracy of the volume of the hidden spring by
the rate of rotation of the baguette, as well as by the violence of the
convulsive movements of his body which simultaneously occurred.1
1 I have mentioned already (p. 260) that the motion of the rod with Bleton (as
with some dowsers of to-day) was subsidiary to the convulsive spasm and malaise
which he experienced, when, as he alleged, an underground spring existed beneath.
T 2
292 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part
Furthermore, he was able to judge of the depth of the spring in the
following manner: on leaving the spot beneath which he alleged water
was to be found, the baguette ceased to turn, but when he had gone a
certain distance the baguette suddenly gave a single rotation in the
opposite direction. The distance at which this occurred from the spot
at which it stopped turning was, according to Bleton, the approximate
depth of the spring. The results given in the depositions quoted by
Thouvenel show that Bleton was usually fairly correct in his estimate
of the depth when it did not exceed 30 ft. ; beyond that he did not
profess to be able to judge. One witness, however, states that even
at small depths Bleton was often at fault.
The rate of rotation and the retrograde as well as the direct
motion of the baguette were no doubt simply ideo-motor phenomena,
the result of an involuntary muscular effort prompted by some auto
suggestion. The difficulty here, as elsewhere in our inquiry, is to
trace the genesis of this probably subconscious suggestion.
§ 4. Apparent Transmission of Motor-Automatism from a Sensitive
to an Insensitive Person.
There is, however, another problem connected with the motion of
the rod which we must not pass over, and that is, the remarkable fact
so frequently noticed that when the dowser lays hold of the wrist or
hand of a person with whom the rod will not turn, the twig instantly
moves. I have quoted numerous instances of this from excellent wit
nesses on pp. 278 and 279. This apparent transmission of the power of
involuntary muscular action was noticed by Thouvenel to occur with
Bleton a hundred years ago. On p. 59 of his Me'moire Thouvenel says
that, when Bleton placed his fingers on the hand of a person with whom
the baguette would not turn, then the rod instantly rotated when they
approached an underground spring. M. le Comte de M , whom I
quoted just now, states that, whilst the baguette would not move in
his hands, yet when Bleton held them the rod then began to turn,
much to his astonishment. A few years later Amoretti indepen
dently discovered the same thing when Pennet touched his hands. He
states the rod then turned against his (Amoretti's) will whenever he
stood over veins of metal. I have referred to this on p. 247. Compare
this with the similar experience (only with a forked rod) described by
a mechanical engineer, Mr. Morton, given on p. 172 of the present
Report, or with the precisely corresponding experience of an able
lawyer (the land agent to Trinity College, Cambridge), Mr. Woolley,
given on p. 278.
There can, therefore, be no doubt about this curious fact, which
seems to occur most conspicuously only with notable dowsers, such as
xxxvm.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 293
Bleton and the late J. Mullins. What is the explanation of it? I
expect it will be found not in the transmission of any voluntary or
involuntary motion from the sensitive to the insensitive person, but in
the transmission of a suggestion to the latter. If so, any mode of
impressing such a suggestion would do as well, if it be emphatic and
indirect. The charming away of warts, of which we have such striking
and well authenticated instances, is a case where any kind of indirect
suggestion will do, if it be strongly impressed on the recipient.1
And by the word suggestion is meant, as Professor Pierre Janet
defines it, the influence which one person exercises upon another indepen
dently of the voluntary consent of the subject.2 That is to say, certain
individuals will submit to a foreign influence and obey it, without
having consented or intended to obey and without even knowing they
were obeying. Now the influence of suggestion is most strikingly seen
in these involuntary or automatic phenomena, and cases analogous to
the apparent transmission of the motion of the baguette from one
person to another occur with the pendule and in the so-called wi/ling
game. If one person, A, finds the pendule will not oscillate in his
hands and another, B, finds it does oscillate freely with him, then
when B clasps the free hand of A, the pendule now oscillates for A
or the direction of the oscillation can be instantly changed by C
clasping B's free hand, and again changed if D clasps C's other hand
and so on through a large circle ; B, C, and D desiring the chango to
occur. Again, in the " willing game," I found in 1879 that
The intervention of a second person (who was ignorant of what had to be
done) between the willer and the subject, the hands of each resting on the
shoulders of the one in front, did not seriously interfere with the result
attained.3
Furthermore, with a sensitive subject, if the operator or willer
merely placed three fingers lightly on the back of the subject's head,
the latter would write correctly words known only to the operator,
even if Greek words and characters were used, though the subject
knew nothing of Greek.4 Professor Janet gives a simpler case where
1 See Journal S.P.R., Vol. VIII. (1897-98), pp. 7, -10, 96, etc., also an admirable
work by Miss Feilding on Faith-Sealing, Chaps. I. and IV. (Duckworth and Co.,
1899). In hypnosis a direct suggestion appears effective, whereas in the normal state
an indirect suggestion seems most potent. e.g., touching or stroking the warts, tying
a thread round the wrist, etc. But why is it that only some persons have this
suggestive power? la it the faith of the charmer in his remedy or the faith of the
patient ? And why is faith, with its necessary self-surrender, the nexus between the
conscious and the sub-conscious life? the powers of the latter being so miraculous,
because so foreign to the former.

the operator holds the left hand of the subject and the latter with his
right hand writes the words known only to the operator.1
If we admit telepathy, i.e., true thought-transference, as a vera
causa, no doubt it plays an important part in many of these phenomena
of suggestion, and my original object in 1879, when making the experi
ments I have described, was to show that the theory of the transmission
of an idea by involuntary muscular action had to be pushed to such a
grotesque extent that it became easier to believe in a purely mental,
rather than in a muscular transmission of the suggestion made by the
operator. Whichever view is taken, the important part played by
suggestion in all these phenomena is unquestionable, and it was to
this fact I drew the attention of psychologists, I believe for the
first time, in a paper read before the British Association so long
ago as 1876.2
§ 5. Historical Note.
In concluding this part we should not forget that one of the first
scientific men in this century who drew attention to the varied effects
of involuntary muscular action was Chevreul. In his work on the
divining rod (La Baguette Divinatoire, Paris, 1854), Chevreul shows
how the rod may be moved in this way. The principle which Chevreul
enunciates, and which he maintains accounts for many diverse phe
nomena, is one with which we are now of course perfectly familiar ; he
thus expresses it :—
Le deVeloppoment en nous d'une action musculaire qui n'est pas le
produit d'une volonte, mais le reaultat d'une pensee qui se porte sur un
phenomene du monde exterieur, sans preoccupation de Taction musculaire
indispensable a la manifestation du phenomene, va servir de centre de
railliement aux faits dissemines ; je le designerai par l'expression de principe
du pendnle cxplurateur.3
Twenty-one years before the publication of his work on the
Baguette, Chevreul had addressed a letter to the famous Ampere,
(published in the Revue ties Dense Mondes for 1833) in which he
clearly states that the movement of the pendule, which was exciting
much attention at that time, was due to " un mouvement musculaire
de mon bras, quoique insensible pour moi " and he points out the
intimate connection between the will or intention of the operator and
the resultant movement of the little ring or ball suspended by a
thread from his fingers. He thus clears away a mass of perplexing
and misleading observations which had been published by numerous
1 L'Automatisme Psychologique, p. 373. Paris, 1889.

xxxviii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 295
previous experimenters on the pendule, all of whom believed some
intimate connection existed between the oscillation of the little ball
and the electric state of the operator or of the object that was tested.1
A German savant, Professor Gilbert, had before this shown in
Gilbert's Annalen der Physdk, Vols. 26 and 27, how worthless
were the inferences drawn from these experiments by Ritter,
Amoretti, Gerboin and others ; Gilbert subsequently published his
papers in 1808.2
In the numerous papers and books on the baguette and pendule pub
lished on the Continent between 1796 and 1816, the controversy, often
violent in tone, does not turn upon the main question whether the
so-called diviner or dowser could or could not discover underground
water better than ordinary mortals,—for except in Thouvenel's original
Me'moire, little or no evidence is adduced on this point—but whether
"animal electricity " was or was not the cause of the twisting of the
rod. The disputants, as usual, cared less to know the actual facts than
to prove their particular theory to be true. Moreover the attention of
the scientific world at the early part of the 19th century was directed
to electricity by Volta and Galvani's discoveries, and it was natural
that many investigators should see in the sudden and mysterious
motion of the baguette and the pendule an effect analogous to the
spasmodic contraction of the legs of a dead frog which Galvani had
shown was due to an electric stimulus. In fact, Volta himself was
consulted and took part in some of these experiments with the
baguette, but his opinion is not stated.
From the baguette and the pendule public attention was afterwards
directed to "table-turning," and the illustrious Faraday, in 1854, con
clusively proved by experiment that it was quite possible for the
sitters to make tables gyrate by involuntary muscular action on their
part.3 Chevreul refers to Faraday's experiments on p. 220 of his

3 Faraday's explanation of table turning is undoubtedly a eera causa for a certain
class of so-called spiritualistic phenomena, but it is only applicable within a limited
range, as every investigator of spiritualism knows. It is of course not impossible
that some of the phenomena of the divining rod may, in like manner, be found to
transcend any explanation now recognised by science ; for the varied manifestations
of automatism insensibly pass from the normal to the supernormal. At present,
however, we are not, in my opinion, justified in assuming the motion of the rod to be
explicable by other than known causes.

work on the Baguette, and groups all these cognate phenomena under
one common explanation : the essential factors, according to both
Faraday and Chevreul, being—(1) the intention of the operator that
the movement should take place in a certain direction, and (2) that he
should be unaware he is exerting any effort of will, or any muscular
force, in carrying out his intention. Professor Ch. Richet has more
recently discussed the subject with wider knowledge, but I have not
yet read his work.1 Dr. Liébeault2 takes much the same view as
Chevreul, but believes that the dowser, from gazing at the point
of his rod, becomes partially hynotised, a view that I have also sug
gested, but the hypnosis, if it exists, is certainly very slight in most
dowsers.
In his masterly work, L'Automatisme Psycholoaique, Professor
Pierre Janet devotes a section to the consideration of the motion of
the divining rod. He confirms Chevreul's view as to the involuntary
motion of the rod and pendule, but he goes further and shows that
these automatic actions are " 1° sans le vouloir, et 2° sans le savoir."
Chevreul admits the first, but asserts that the movements are due to
a conscious intention on the part of the operator to make the rod
or pendulum move in a certain direction ; the knowledge and thought
of the operator are, therefore, involved, though his will may not
actively co-operate. Janet shows that this is a mistaken view; the
movement, as he rightly insists, takes place without the conscious
intention of the operator. He remarks :—
M. Chevreul pousse aussi loin que possible l'explication des faits par la
tendance au mouvement créee par les images conscientes, mais quand les
faits depassent cette theorie, il retombe dans les explications banales par
la fourberie et la simulation. ... II faut aller plus loin que M.
Chevreul et, apres avoir admis des actes sans volonte^ il faut parler des
pensees sans conscience [consciousness] ou en dehors de notre conscience.3
Chevreul, we see from the foregoing, was no exception to that
familiar type of mind which fancies trickery or simulation afford the
only explanation of facts that lie beyond the range of its experience
or its theories. In one of his conversations with Eckermann, Goethe
shows how every new scientific truth has to encounter the fierce
opposition of this class (see the motto on p. 132).4
Dr. Hodgson sends me, as this sheet was passing through the press,
a case (given in the foot-note on next page) he has received from an

American friend which illustrates the entire inadequacy of Chevreul's
point of view.1
Professor Pierre Janet goes further and shows that in these and
other phenomena of automatism,
II y a done, dans certains ens, plus qu'un acte automatique, manifesta
tion involontaire d'une image visuelle et auditive ; il y a une véritable
action sub-consciente, une veritable collaboration de la seconde personnalite'
avec la premiere.—(L'Automatisme Psychologique, p. 374.)
The class of persons who exhibit one or more of the varied pheno
mena of automatism are those whom M. Janet calls les individus
suygestibles ; persons who are readily influenced by suggestion from
within or without, whose mind is easily dominated by a single idea.
This may explain why it happens, as was noticed 150 years ago, that
the best dowsers are not educated people, but more or less ignorant
persons, who— according to Pryce— {Mineralo'gia Cornubiensis, p. 118)
" hold the rod without puzzling their minds with doubts or reasonings."
Such persons best exhibit the " reflex " action to which the motion of the
rod is due, the prompting of suggestion not being interfered with by
volition. But where will and reason are supreme, such automatic actions
are brought into subjection by the intelligence. In other words, when
our conscious self, which speaks through voluntary muscular movements,
is dominant, the subconscious self is submerged. Hence in order that
any subconscious suggestion may take effect in some form of automatic
action, the reason and will must be in abeyance.
In fine, the controlling force of Suggestion is to the subconscious
life and its expression in involuntary 7tiuscular action and tissue-
change what the Will is to the conscious life and its expression in
voluntary muscular action.
Summary.
Summing up this lengthy discussion we see that the curious
phenomena attending the motion of the so-called divining rod are
capable of explanation by causes known to science. They are not
isolated phenomena, but belong to the large group which exhibit in
various ways the play of motor automatism, and illustrate in a
striking manner the profound effect which suggestion has in deter
mining, directing or modifying these phenomena.
1 "New Lebanon, N.Y., July 1st, 1900. I spent a whole day nearly with an old
gentleman here—afarmer, rather above the average in intelligence—a man of much local
influence. He says that ten years ago he laughed at the witch- hazel ' superstition,'
thinking it nothing more. About that time he bought a farm, which he found—after
buying—to be poorly watered. A neighbour, coming with a threshing machme, had
difficulty in getting water for his engine. This neighbour said one of kit neighbours
had found water with the 'witch-hazel crotch.' My man sneered at the idea.

another. Got a stick ; tried it ; wouldn't work. Gave the stick to my man. The

When some instrumental means is used to exhibit these involun
tary muscular movements, it is desirable to employ a generic term,
such as the word autoscope, as suggested in the previous Report. The
divining—or dowsing—rod is, therefore, a convenient out-of-door
autoscope, and when held in a state of strain, as it often is, becomes,
from its unstable or balanced equilibrium, very sensitive to almost
imperceptible muscular action on the part of the dowser. (See, on this,
Professor de Mortillet's own observations, given on p. 244.)
As I said in the previous Report : It is just because these auto
matic actions appear to be so novel, and detached from ourselves,
that they are apt to be so misleading to some and so mischievous to
others. Interpreted on the one hand as the play of a wonderful occult
force, science has refused to have anything to do with phenomena
which seem to obey no physical laws, but are capricious and self-
determined. Interpreted on the other, truly enough, as the exhibition
of a free and intelligent agent, some infernal or discarnate spirit has
been fixed upon as the cause, and a fictitious authority for which there is
no warrant has been given to tlieir indications. Whether in any case
these intelligent automatic movements exhibit information outside the
memory of the individual who uses the autoscope ; or a knowledge
beyond that which may have been unconsciously derived (a) from those
present by sign-reading or thought-transference, or (b) from the sur
roundings of the automatist, by his hyperresthetic discernment of faint
indications, is a problem which can only be solved so as to gain general
acceptance by long and patient enquiry, of which our Proceedings
are an earnest, and to which this monograph may afford a small
contribution.
latter took it merely in complaisance ; walked along a few rods ; suddenly it went
down. He couldn't stop it. Thought it was an involuntary muscular contraction ;
tried it again ; held it as tightly as possible : passing over the same line, a few rods
down the hill, it turned again, and so strongly that the bark ' peeled ' in his hands.
The thresher man declared there was water beneath. My man said he should want
to see it before he believed it, the surface giving no indication of it. Thresher man
wanted water for his boiler and dug. Only a few feet down struck a small stream,
sufficient to feed his boiler. Since then my man has experimented a good deal. As
a result of his work, he now has a small reservoir on the hillside back of his buildings,
in a place where no water was known before, which supplies his barn the year round
and affords a limited supply for use in case of fire. The reservoir is fed from two
small springs discovered by the turning of the witch-hazel fork in his own hands.
While with me he walked about over a good deal of territory. The fork turned
down every time be passed over a trickle of visible water, without exception. It
also turned several times where no water was visible or suggested. In two of these
places I and a man with me dug down a few feet. In the one case we found a vein
in the rock filled with iron pyrites crystals ; in the other we struck a sheet of solid
slats rock about 30 in. down, which we had neither tools nor time to drill into
or through : there is an old tradition of lead veins—from which the Indians
used to smelt out lead—in the very place where his fork turned over the slate
rock."

PART XII.
The Malaise of the Dowser and its Orioin.
Nearly all dowsers assert that when the rod moves in their hands,
or when they believe that underground water is beneath them, they
experience a peculiar sensation, which some describe as felt in the
limbs like the tingling of an electric shock, others as a shivering or
trembling, and others as an unpleasant sensation in the epigastric
region. With all there is more or less of a convulsive spasm, some
times of a violent character. This malaise is very marked in some
cases, but not experienced in others. That these physiological disturb
ances have a purely psychological origin is obvious—(1) from the fact
that they are not experienced when the dowser is off duty, that is,
when he has no suspicion that he is in the neighbourhood of under
ground water, and (2) that like effects are not produced by the much
greater masses of visible water in rivers, lakes, or the sea. The
interesting point is that these psycho-physiological phenomena have
a real existence ; they exist among dowsers in all countries, and can
be traced back, as historical investigation shows, for upwards of two
centuries. In the preceding Report I devoted an Appendix to this
subject, and to avoid repetition would beg those of my readers who
are interested to refer to the cases I have there quoted.1
Let us briefly note the principal facts. In the first place it is
not, as some imagine, only when the "diviner" is in the presence of
underground water that this physiological disturbance occurs. In the
Journal des Scavans (Savants) for January, lo93, a copy of which I
possess, a physician of some note, Dr. Chauvin, writes that, when the
well-known Jacques Aymar was sent for to trace, by means of his rod,
the murderer of a Lyons Marchand de Vin, Aymar was taken into
the cellar where the murder was committed ; suddenly his baguette
moved violently, and he was seized with convulsive spasms. Dr.
Chauvin, who was present, adds :—" II ne fut pas plutot entré qu'il se
sentit tout emu, et que son poux s'eleva comme une grosse fievre."2
1 Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. XIII., p. 272, et seq.
• Aymar, as my readers probably know, set out on the track of the murderer,
who had hitherto baffled all the attempts of the police to discover his whereabouts,
and, guided by his baguette, tracked him " for 45 hours on land and 30 hours on the
water," crossing and recrossing the Rhone, until at last he pointed out a man, found
in a soldiers' camp, as the assassin. The man was arrested, taken to Lyons, tried,
found guilty, and subsequently confessing his crime, was put to death by being
broken at the wheel. There are numerous corroborative official depositions in this
remarkable case ; among others is the prowl eerbal of an eye-witness, M. de Vagny,
the Procureur du Roi.
300 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part
A century later another distinguished French physician, Dr.
Thouvenel, independently notices much the same thing with the
water-finder, Bleton. Dr. Thouvenel gives a detailed medical report
of his own long-continued observations, and states that when Bleton
believed he was over a subterranean spring he was seized with an
extraordinary malaise, which affected his diaphragm and produced a
sense of oppression in the chest ; at the same time a shivering sets in
and the pulse falls, his body trembles, and, in a word, he exhibits
"all the characteristics of an attack of convulsive spasm."1 Similar
symptoms manifested themselves in the Prior of a convent at Autun,
who was an amateur dowser and contemporary of Bleton. A few
years later the Italian savant, Amoretti, noticed the same symptoms
occur whenever the lad Pennet came over a vein of mineral ore or of
coal. Amoretti states that a surgeon, Sanzio, an amateur dowser,
found his pulse accelerated twelve to fifteen beats per minute when
the rod moved in his hands (see p. 247).
Dr. Mayo, F.R.S., who, as Professor of Anatomy and Physiology
in King's College and in the College of Surgeons in London, was a
most competent observer, describes corresponding symptoms which he
observed in 1847 in a youth in Russia. The lad had never seen a
"divining rod" before, but when Dr. Mayo instructed him how to
use it, and made him walk over a spot where he had reason to believe
an underground spring existed, the forked twig twisted round, much
to the lad's astonishment, and at the same time Dr. Mayo states the
lad declared that
he felt an uneasy sensation which quickly increased to pain at the pit of the
stomach, and he became alarmed, so that I bade him quit hold of the rod,
when the pain ceased. Ten minutes later I induced him to make another
trial ; the results were the same.2
As Dr. Mayo was apparently unaware of Thouvenel's writings, he
could hardly have anticipated or suggested the malaise experienced by
his subject, but the effect observed was doubtless due to the same
psychological cause as in the previous cases.
Abundant modern instances of a similar physiological disturbance
and convulsive spasm occurring with various dowsers in different
countries will be found in the cases cited in the previous and present
Report (see, e.g., pp. 230, 244, 245, 251, 252, etc.). Mr. J. F. Young,
whose experiences as an amateur dowser are given on p. 219, says :—
I have noticed, when divining, unpleasant and peculiar symptoms always
occur when I am over an underground spring ; often a convulsive feeling and
staggering comes on.

xxxviii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 301
He goes on to describe how the sensation is chiefly felt at the
epigastrium, and that his father, who was also an amateur dowser,
used to stagger and vomit when the rod turned in his hands. An
experiment was once made with old Mr. Young to test whether these
symptoms were genuine ; it is described in detail in my previous
Report, p. 276. Mr. Young was carefully blindfolded and led about
by a circuitous route, but directly he came over the spot where he had
been seized with these symptoms before, and which had been purposely
marked, " he reeled as before and would have fallen if I had not held
him up. Directly he came off the place he was all right." The con
vulsions that seized the famous dowser, Mr. Lawrence, whenever he
came to a place beneath which he asserted underground water to exist,
have been described on a previous page (foot-note, p. 290).
There are some sceptical friends who would explain these phe
nomena by asserting that these different dowsers conspired to exhibit
similar symptoms as a bit of stage business in order to impress the
onlookers. It is, I think, unnecessary to waste time in disputing
such a belief if any one cares to hold it.
How, then, are we to explain these curious pathological phe
nomena? The facts are certainly incontestable and, I venture to think,
deserve more attention from physiologists than they have yet received.
They are not, however, peculiar to the use of the so-called divining
rod, but are found to exist more or less conspicuously in other cases of
motor automatism. Professor Pierre Janet has drawn attention to
very similar convulsive phenomena and physiological disturbances as
associated with other phases of automatism.1 Prior to this, how
ever, in the first volume of the Proceedings of our Society, I pointed
out that in trials with the " willing game,"—which is one phase of
these varied automatic phenomena, — curious physiological disturb
ances were often produced, such as dizziness, hysteria, and incipient
trance. 2 In fact, a malaise, manifesting itself in different ways, and
with different degrees of intensity in different subjects, is a usual con
comitant of motor automatism and its allied phenomena.
The singular connection of visceral sensation,—a visceral con
sciousness as it were,—with a particular psychical state is familiar to
us all in emotion3. Emotion, in fact, is afeeling excited by an idea or
train of ideas, and therefore the sensations experienced by the dowser
1 L'Automatismc P!iichologique, p. 208, etc. ; Paris, 188!).
2 Proceedings S.P.R. for 1882, Vol. I., p. 57.
3 Professor James holds that our feeling of the bodily changes as they recur is
the emotion ; he writes, " If I were to become corporeally aniesthetic, I should be
excluded from the life of the affections, harsh and tender alike. ' ' Physiologically,
may we not really define emotion as certain visceral or vascular disturbances, set up
by suggestion, the sensation of these disturbances being the feeling of emotion ?
302 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part
are strictly emotional disturbances. Whether emotion is primarily a
cerebral process, as some physiologists maintain, the visceral or
vascular disturbance being secondary ; or whether, as other eminent
physiologists hold, the psychical process of emotion is secondary to the
excitation of the visceral organs,—through certain stimuli causing the
discharge of a nervous impulse into those organs,— is a matter that
does not concern us here, albeit physiologists may find in the facts I
have cited some fresh light thrown on this controversy. The point of
interest to us is that (1) the malaise or other sensation felt by the
dowser is probably an emotional effect, and (2) the fresh evidence
afforded of the nexus existing between emotion and muscular action,
whether this latter be conscious or, as with the dowser and his rod,
unconscious. As Professor Sherrington, F.R.S., an able physiologist,
in a recent paper on Emotion (Nature, Vol. 62, p. 331), has said : —" It
would be consonant with what we know of reflex action if the spur
that started the muscular expression should simultaneously and of itself
initiate also the visceral adjunct reaction."
Furthermore, in many cases where subconscious acts are performed,
as M. Janet points out, a state of partial catalepsy supervenes.
Catalepsy, as Dr. Ochorowicz has shown, is a state of mono-ideism,1
that is, a "mental condition which concentrates every action upon
one single and dominant idea and is not counterbalanced by any
other." Now this is precisely the condition of the dowser when he
"sets" himself to dowse, and in some cases he passes into a state of
complete catalepsy when the idea culminates. It is not, therefore, a
question of underground water or mineral ore, but merely the result
of suggestion acting upon a state of mono-ideism.
The malaise, or other sensation felt by the dowser, is, therefore, in
all probability, an emotional disturbance, the mind being dominated by
a single idea and the subject being a person on whom suggestion is
operative : using the word " suggestion " in the sense which I have
already defined as an impression or influence exercised without the
knowledge or consent of the subject being concerned.
We have now narrowed the issue down to the problem of " how does
this subconscious suggestion arise in the case of the successful
dowser 1 " Here we enter upon the final stage of our inquiry.

PART XIII.
Origin of the Stimulus that gives rise to the Motor Automatism
op the Dowser.
§ 1. Is it Derived through the Ordinary Channels of Sense?
It now remains for us to try and ascertain what gives rise to the
suggestion or stimulus which causes the involuntary motion of the rod
—in other words, what is it originates the motor automatism of the
dowser? What is it "pulls the trigger"? Evidently this suggestion
or stimulus cannot be purely accidental and worthless, for, as we have
seen, the operations of a good dowser are attended with unquestion
able success, a success far beyond that which mere chance coincidence
can account for. This being conceded, we now turn to the possible
explanations already stated at the beginning (p. 143).
(i.) Is this success due merely to knowledge acquired by the dowser
from experience and observation of the ground and perhaps occasional
hints from bystanders ? In that case success would be arrived at by
an exercise of judgment, or some would say cunning ; shrewd observa
tion and the piecing together of stray information would be the main
business of the dowser. Under these circumstances sub-conscious
suggestion and motor automatism are wholly out of the question—the
motion of the rod must be a purely voluntary act ; and if so the
forked twig of the dowser, like the wand of the conjuror, becomes a
piece of stage property, or of charlatanry, to mystify the public. This
has hitherto been the usual scientific view, but it is, I maintain, now
proved to be untenable ; the motion of the rod is unquestionably, as
Professor Janet has said, "sans le vouloir et sans le savoir" on the part
of the dowser. It is quite possible the experience gained by the dowser,
or any observations he has made on the spot, may be of service to
him, but if so, it must lie at the background of his consciousness and
not form part of a process of reasoning. We are thus driven to
inquire :—
(ii.) Is this information or suggestion derivedfrom some sub-conscious
process ofobservation on the part of the dowser, or hyperteslhetic discern
ment ofsurface signs too faint or complex to be perceived by the ordinary
observer ? There is much to be said on behalf of this view, for surface
signs of underground water do exist and for shallow wells such signs
are of great value independently of geological knowledge. On p. 248
of the previous Report, I pointed out the nature of some of these signs,
and since that Report was published, an excellent little Manual on the
discovery of water-sources has been published in France, wherein the
304 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part
surface indications of underground water are very clearly set forth.1
Much of this knowledge goes back to ancient times. Vitruvius,
Augustus Caesar's famous engineer, gives a lengthy account of surface
signs which were employed in his day to find underground water :
some appear fanciful, but many are still in use. Pliny, in his Natural
History, refers to the same thing. Moreover, the letters of Cassiodorus
(the statesman and secretary of Theodoric, King of the Ostrogoths),
written at the beginning of the sixth century, show that in his time
there were certain people held in high repute, and called " Aquilegi,"
who appear to have been professional water-finders. Cassiodorus
explains how this valuable art had arisen from careful observation of
the surface of the ground, etc.2 Now the modern dowser may more
or less unconsciously note these indications and,—without being able to
give any rational explanation of how it comes about, — the impressions
made upon him by these surface signs may create the sub-conscious
suggestion which causes the involuntary motion of the rod.
The extraordinary success of the Abbe- Paramelle as a water-finder,
or " hydroscope " as he was called, supports this view. Paramelle tells
us he was guided entirely by the knowledge he had acquired from a
careful study of the surface of the ground, and to defend himself from
the attacks made upon him, he wrote a treatise to put on record the
methods he employed. As this work appears almost wholly unknown
in England, I have given an outline of it in Appendix D, see p. 352 ;
to this I would refer my readers. But the rapidity and certainty
with which Paramelle is stated, on trustworthy evidence, to have
located the site, probable depth and volume of water in wells under
50 feet deep, can hardly be accounted for by an exercise of ordinary
conscious observation and judgment. It is much more like an act of
intuition, for between 1839 and 1854 he had located 10,000 sources
of underground water and his failures appear to have been only from
5 to 10 per cent, of the whole. Though Paramelle believed he could
teach his system, his pupils did not achieve their master's success and
the school he hoped to found died out. On the whole, there can, I
think, be little doubt that the French AbW arrived at his conclusions
sub-consciously, though he employed no rod to give automatic
expression to his instinctive opinion.
But it is not only in water-finding that the trained scientific
observer, such as a field geologist, is often less successful in reading
surface indications than those who appear possessed of some instinctive
discernment of the signs sought for. Thus, in the discovery of china
1 I have given a brief notice of this little book by M. Auscher on p. 382 of the
present Report.
> See Appendix F.. p. 370.
xxxvm ] On the So-called Divining Rod. 305
clay (the basis of our best English china), I am informed by a high
authority, Mr. Fred. W. P. Jago, that :—
The workmen in the china-clay district (near St. Austell, in Cornwall)
will point out where a bed of china clay in its natural state of decomposed
granite lies hidden under what they term the slad. [Mr. Jago goes on
to say] : As my father and myself have been engaged in this kind of mining
for nearly seventy years, I also could fairly point out where there was a bed
of china clay below the surface, but I would defy the scientific geologist to do
so from his inspection.
Yet our workmen will even tell you the extent of such a bed—from their
knowledge of the peculiar formation of the surface of the ground—before an
atom of the clay has been seen or dug up from, say 8 or 10 feet below. The
term slad expresses this, but it is as hard to describe as it would be for one
to describe his own handwriting.
I have always suspected that dowsers have a somewhat similar knowledge
as to water and lodes.
Feed. W. P. Jago.
Here then we have a case where success can hardly be due to any
conscious process of reasoning ; the judgment seems to be more or less
instinctive, though doubtless it has been gained by experience. Much
the same thing occurs in the location of metallic lodes. From very
early times, the signs of underground ore have been noticed by miners,
references to these indications are to be found in all the leading works
on mining published in the 16th and 17th centuries.1 A distinguished
authority on mining, the late Professor Warington Smyth, F.R.S.,
remarked in a lecture delivered in 1869 :—
There is some foundation for the idea that metallic lodes affect vegetation ;
the herbage is often brighter and better over certain lodes and worse over
others. A certain class of plants will grow over the lode and not on adjacent
parts. Veins containing decomposing iron pyrites are slightly warmer, so
that there is rather a higher temperature over them ; dow or hoar frost will
not lie long on the lode, so that its presence can be traced early in the
morning. A peculiar odour from the sulphurous gases pervades the direction
of a lode, and sometimes at night a faintly luminous appearance is seen over
certain metallic lodes.2
As we shall see in Book III., the dowser has gained remarkable
success not only in finding underground water but mineral lodes, and
hence the probability that he is guided by some surface indications is
greatly increased from the fact that such indications are found in both
these cases. It may, however, be urged that ordinary observation and
judgment would be sufficient in each case to explain success without
assuming any instinctive or subconscious process. But this view, as
1 See especially G. Agricola's De Re Mctallica, Basle, 1546.

under the article " Mining." See also Pryce's Mincralogia Cornubientis, etc.
z
306 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part
we have seen, is inconsistent with the phenomenon of motor auto
matism, and, moreover, common sense, aided by observation, knowledge
and reasoning, would long ago have displaced the dowser had the
Latter not been found to be of greater practical value.
It must, therefore, be admitted that if surface indications deter
mine the suggestion that starts the automatic motion of the rod, these
indications are not deliberately sought for, but that a subconscious
and hypercsthetic discernment of faint signs that escape the ordinary
observer is quite possible on the part of the successful dowser.
Many instances have been given in our Proceedings of definite
motor reactions, sometimes of a remarkable character quite unaccom
panied by consciousness,1 and many illustrations have also been given
of what at first sight appears an almost miraculous sense of perception,
really due to a transitory hyperaesthetic and subconscious condition on
the part of the subject.- It is, therefore, I think, unnecessary for me
to contend further that the foregoing explanation is really a vera causa,
but I now proceed to show that it is not the whole cause and may really
play a very unimportant part in the matter.
§ 2. Is the Suggestion Pure Chance or Derived from some Super
normal Source of Perception ?
Whilst the explanation just given may cover some of the facts, it
fails to explain those cases where surface indications of underground
water do not exist, owing either to the surface being made ground or
covered with buildings, or with a layer of 30 or 40 feet of " drift," or
the water itself existing in fissures or cavities so far beneath the surface
that it is inconceivable its presence could be indicated by any super
ficial signs. Now, an attentive study of the cases I have cited in the
present and the previous Report shows that the dowser's success is not
limited to localities where surface indications may be conjectured.
Take, for example, the classical case of Waterford, so fully described
and discussed in the previous Report, pp. 106-117. The able geologists
who have examined that case clearly show that surface signs could
have nothing to say to the dowser's success. Take again in the

weather prognostication. If a code could be arranged so as to interpret its indications,
I have no doubt it would become as famous in foretelling the weather, say twelve
hours ahead, as in finding underground water or mineral ores ; supposing that a sub
conscious discernment of faint signs really occurs with the dowser. Leeches used to
be employed as weather prophets : see on this subject of animal presentiments my

present Report the Errol case, p. 171, when the same dowser (the late
John Mullins) was employed, or the Lytes-Cary case, p. 174, or the
Carrigoona experiments, p. 144, or the Shanklin experiments, p. 164, or
the case of Beraz, p. 248, or many of Bleton's cases, p. 264, or others
I might quote. All these cases point to one of two conclusions —
either they are the result of chance coincidence, lucky hits on the part
of the dowser, or that the dowser possesses some faculty new to science.
Let us take the first alternative. What are the chances of success
in, say the Waterford case ? Here the geologists show that Mullins
must have hit upon a line of fault in the Silurian rocks " 80 ft. below
the surface," or " a porous stratum concealed beneath the drift,"
—which is here over 40 ft. in thickness (see the Report by Mr. J. R.
Kilroe of the Geological Survey of Ireland, given in my former
Report, Proceedings S.P.R.,Vol. XIII., p. 116). Now before the advent
of Mullins three borings (iii one case to the depth of 1,000 ft., in
another to a depth of 392 ft.) had been made on scientific advice in
places near the spot selected by Mullins ; one of these borings had
been made on the advice of Mr. Kinahan, F.G.S., of the Geological
Survey, and yet in each case no water had been found. The chances
of hitting a line of fault or porous stratum were, therefore, extremely
small. I have talked over this with Mr. Kilroe, who has visited the
spot and is one of the best geological authorities on that district, and
he tells mo that a " lucky fluke " on the part of the dowser, though
conceivable, is almost incredible. This also was evidently the opinion
of the local geologist, Mr. Budd, who was present at the borings, and
of Mr. Kinahan himself. Moreover, Mullins predicted the exact
depth of the fissure within a foot or two and was right in the volume
of water that was found. These are contemporary statements made
by those who were at first prejudiced against the dowser.
From the study of these and other cases I have therefore been
driven to the conclusion that neither surface signs, nor hypera.sthetic
discernment, nor chance coincidence, can account for all the successes
of a good dowser like Bleton in the last century or the late J. Mullins
and others in recent times. This is precisely the conclusion which Mr.
Westlake, F.G.S., has independently arrived at from a careful geological
examination on the spot of other cases selected from my previous
Report, see Appendix A., p. 337. In his analysis, Mr. Westlake assumes
the dowser knew all the local indications of the underground water, and
he is disposed to read back into the dowser's mind the hydro-geological
knowledge which was gained after the dowser's well had been sunk.
Notwithstanding all this, Mr. Westlake concludes that a certain
percentage of cases (10 to 15 per cent.) defy any explanation known to
science except chance coincidence. Here then the issue is knit. Can
it be shown that the outstanding cases are explicable as merely lucky
308 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part
hits due to pure chance on the part of the dowser ? I think the
onus probandi of this must be left to those who challenge our methods
of inquiry, or deny the existence of any avenue of knowledge other
than the recognised channels of sense.
§ 3. Is any Physical Cause at all Likely ?
In seeking for an explanation of these outstanding cases, I do not
think we need consider any physical cause. Recent scientific discoveries,
such as the X-rays and wireless telegraphy, have made the public
familiar with the fact that bodies like earth and bricks and flesh, which
are opaque to light, may be transparent to electric waves. But
though the penetration of opaque bodies by invisible radiation has
long been known to scientific men, the unscientific mind naturally seizes
the idea that just as electric waves have been shown to pass unimpeded
through walls and mountains, so some electric influence from under
ground water is likely to pass through the superincumbent earth and
affect the dowser. But then we must assume an electric influence also
proceeds from mineral ores and that the dowser is a delicate electroscope,
and this is pure assumption. It is true our knowledge of the world
around is very limited, but 200 years ago the philosopher Malebranche
showed, from the uniformity of nature, how untenable was any
explanation based upon an imaginary physical influence produced by
underground water or metals upon the dowser.1 Whatever effect is
produced by underground water or ore would be produced in a greater
degree by the proximity of water or ore on the surface. Nevertheless,
the dowser appears quite insensible to the mass of water in a river,
lake, or the ocean, or to masses of metal or ore within his sight.
There is, however, another physical hypothesis which is more
plausible, and which at one time suggested itself to me. We are
insensible to certain physical forces which are ever streaming through
us, such as the magnetism of the earth ; we are likewise insensible to
the motion of the earth in space, but we should become alarmingly
sensible of the latter if it were interrupted or suddenly changed. It
is conceivable the dowser may be a person gifted with a sense affected
by any slight interruption in the continuity or modification of the
lines of terrestrial, magnetic, or electric force. Underground fissures
may be imagined to produce such a modification or want of continuity
in the ambient field of force, and thus their presence might be
detected by certain organisations. But I do not attach the least
value to this conception as an explanation of the success of the

dowser ; for, inter alia, there is no evidence to show that the dowser
is more affected than ordinary persons by any of the physical forces ;
and the interruption of a magnetic field of force enormously greater
than that due to the earth is absolutely unfelt by the dowser. No,
the key to the mystery that remains must, in my opinion, be sought in
the psychical and not in the physical world.
§ 4. Probable Explanation of the More Remarkable Successes
of the Dowser.
There is abundant evidence in our Proceedings that the information
subconsciously given by some automatists often transcends the ordinary
sense perceptions. Cases of so-called clairvoyanca resting upon excellent
testimony are known, see e.g., the cases cited in Mrs. Sidgwick's paper
on the " Evidence for Clairvoyance," or Dr. Alfred Backman's " Experi
ments on Clairvoyance," and the supplementary papers to both of
these contained in Vol. IX. of the Proceedings S.P.R., also the
evidence cited by Mr. Myers in Vol. XI., pp. 367-404. It is true the
science of to-day does not recognise any such super-sensory extension
of knowledge, yet nothing is clearer to those who have made a careful
and critical study of psychical phenomena, not only that telepathy is a
fact, but that to the subconscious or subliminal self, the elements of
time and space have not the same limitations as they have to our
conscious self. Even Schopenhauer, in his Versucht iiber Geistersehen,
long ago said, " He who doubts the fact of clairvoyance is not sceptical
but ignorant." This is, perhaps, a stronger assertion than I should
be disposed to make, but of the reality of this " far seeing " power, I,
among others, have had indubitable proof after carefully conducted
experiments with persons in the deep hypnotic state, and the same
condition is often seen in the allied state of somnambulism. Those
who on a priori grounds deny the possibility of any such transcen
dental perceptive power should read the conclusions unanimously
arrived at by the nine distinguished members of the French Royal
Academy of Medicine, who were appointed by the Academy to report
on mesmeric phenomena. After five years' investigation this Com
mittee presented their lengthy Report to the Academy in June, 1831.
They state they began the inquiry with " inexperience, impatience
and distrust," which at first militated against them. Ultimately,
after the most rigorous tests, they " conclude with certainty " that
the faculty which has been designated clairvoyance does really exist
in certain subjects in the mesmeric state.1
1 See Colquhoun's translation of this Report published in 1833. In an Appendix
the Editor gives several remarkable cases of clairvoyance, attested by some eminent
Continental physicians as occurring in certain cataleptic patients, who—like the
dowser—appeared to have the seat of this perceptive faculty in the epigastrium.
310 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part
The question arises, Is this condition ever found in persons
who, like the dowser, are in their normal waking state, not in a
hypnotic or somnambulic trance 1 I have tried to put this ques
tion to the test of experiment with an amateur dowser, and the
result of the preliminary experiments (which are all that have so
far been made), affords considerable support to the hypothesis of
some kind of clairvoyant faculty in the particular dowser tested.
I have given an account of these experiments, together with some
additional evidence bearing on the same subject, in Appendix E.,
p. 359.1
Professor Janet, in a passage I have quoted on p. 297, points
out that evidence of a secondary personality is afforded in cases of
motor automatism such as the dowser exhibits. Now, we know
that in automatic writing the secondary self frequently exhibits
transcendental sources of information ; the Ego seems to pass beyond
its usual narrow threshold of sensibility, the veil is lifted which
hides scenes spatially distant.2 Mr. Myers has cited cases of
what he terms cosmopathie impressibility on the part of the
automatist ; that is, transcendental impressions which come to men
from the surrounding world, impressions "borne like seed on the wind,
rather than wittingly directed towards him by the voluntary or
involuntary sympathy of any assignable intelligence."3 The sensibility
of the dowser may be of such a kind, but humbler, geopathic and not
cosmopathie. I have no doubt, however, that in years to come we
shall see in all these phenomena the manifestation of the transcendental
Subject which lies in the background of our being, and remains
unrevealed to our self-consciousness. Thus we have been led from the
study of such a matter-of-fact and practical question as the discovery
of underground water by the dowser to the very centre and mystery
of our complex personality.
Here, however, we do well to remember that there is but a step
from the sublime to the ridiculous. For the emergence of the
subconscious self and its expression in some form of motor automatism
involves the more or less complete surrender of our reason, of self-
consciousness and the voluntary control over our actions ; the reins
of will are, as it were, thrown down and the automatist becomes the
1 A belief in the existence of clairvoyance among certain persons in the normal
state is, I find, the foundation of the repute in which the so-called Zahoris were once
held. As the Zahoris are sometimes referred to in modern literature, and no one was
able to give me any information about them, after some search I was able to obtain
the historical information given in Appendix F., p. 367.
* Upon this subject see Baron Du Prel's Philosophy of Mysticism, translated by
Mr. C. C. Masaey.

sport of every wayward impulse or passing suggestion.1 Hence, the
worthlessness of many of the indications and messages given through
different forms of autoscope, whether forked rod, tilting table or
scribbling pencil.
We may, therefore, expect any auto-suggestion to make itself
apparent in the motion of the divining rod, and this is the case ; when,
however, the dowser " sets himself," as he expresses it, then the
indications afforded by the movement of his rod are directed towards
the object of his search, and the suggestion may now arise : (1) from
various hints he has gathered or knowledge he possesses becoming un
consciously operative ; or (2) from his subconscious and perhaps
hyperaesthetic discernment of the surface signs of underground water
or ore ; or (3) from some kind of transcendental discernment possessed
by his subconscious self. For my own part, I am disposed to think that
this last cause, though less acceptable to science, will ultimately be
found to be the truer explanation of the more striking successes of a
good dowser.2 My reasons for thinking so are : (i) the success which
certain dowsers have achieved in discovering underground water, when
surface indications were out of the question, and when previous
borings, as deep or deeper, in the immediate vicinity failed to discover
water ; (ii) the success which has attended young or ignorant dowsers,
such as Bleton, who cannot be supposed to have an intuitive knowledge
of the surface indications of underground water ; and (iii) the evidence
afforded by carefully blindfolding the dowser.
The only alternative explanation in these cases appears to me
to be that of chance coincidence, and to the majority of thoughtful
persons this will doubtless seem the more probable alternative ; but
the probability of its being so will be recognised as extremely small by
those who will take the trouble to apply, so far as can be done, the
doctrine of chances to the facts I have cited. On the other hand, the
probability that an explanation is to be found in some extension of
our knowledge of human personality, something new to science, and
something akin to what has been termed clairvoyance, gains consider
able weight from a critical study of cognate phenomena described in
our Proceedings and elsewhere. And surely, even if the majority of
1 It is obvious that such persons cannot be as fully responsible for their actions
as the rest of mankind. Readily influenced by their environment and controlled by
suggestion, such " suggestible persons " (among whom are all so-called "mediums")
when met with suspicion and the suggestion of fraud, frequently exhibit the very
characteristics their critics have imagined them to possess. The investigators, in
fact, have unconsciously suggested the rile that the subjects have played.
2 If this be the case, the dowser ought to be able to indicate the position of any
buried object, as well as underground water and mineral lodes, albeit surface indica
tions in these latter may count for something. I have dealt with this wider question
in Appendix E., p. 359.
312 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part
cases of the success of the dowser are explicable by known causes, yet,
as Kant said of the attested story of Swedenborg's clairvoyance, " the
amazing inferences that would have to be drawn if only one such
event could be proved " will, I hope, stimulate further inquiry, so
that the conclusion I have reached may be confirmed or disproved.
I do not for one moment profess that the explanation I have sug
gested is anything more than a provisional and tentative one. A final
solution is not likely to be reached until the subject has been critically
examined and discussed by scientific men from different points of view.
But if many years' experimental investigation gives me any right
to express an opinion, I am convinced that the only method by which
we can hope to bring these elusive and perplexing phenomena out of
the " disorderly mystery of ignorance," in which they have lain
neglected for so long, into the " orderly mystery of science," is by a
careful collection of trustworthy evidence, supplemented by experi
mental investigation wherever it is possible, and then by the fearless
suggestion of some working hypothesis which will enable future in
vestigators to direct their inquiries to definite issue, and thus
overthrow or establish the provisional explanation that has been
suggested. This is obviously the method by which the whole edifice
of modern science has been reared ; it is nothing more than the
application of the inductive philosophy to psychical research And
we may confidently expect much more rapid progress in this difficult
region of inquiry when it becomes evident that there is not only
something to investigate, but that some solid addition to our know
ledge or some useful practical result will issue from the inquiry. A
larger number of trained investigators will then be attracted, and
though psychical research can never offer the commercial stimulus
to which the recent development of electrical science is almost
wholly due, yet it presents to us many problems of profound
interest.
For thirty years those of us who founded this Society have striven
to ascertain whether the information derived through the recognised
channels of sense embraced the whole of the accessible sources of
knowledge ; whether also the normal phenomena of Nature,—manifested
to us as the accidents of time, space, and mass, in terms of which all
natural phenomena may be expressed, —were really the bed-rock upon
which the whole superstructure of human science must be raised ; or
whether the order of Nature can be proved to contain an even vaster
procession of phenomena than is now embraced within the recognised
limits of science : in fine, whether we could ever reach by scientific
methods the profounder, more enduring, and transcendent realities
that lie beneath the material surface, as thought lies behind its
utterance in language.
xxxviii.] On the So-called Divining Rod. 313
There are some avenues of approach to this great quest which seem
barred to many earnest searchers after truth ; the limitation of our
faculties may possibly render certain pathways to knowledge inaccess
ible under the conditions of our present existence. But we cannot,
o priori, condemn any inquiry unless it has been conclusively proved
to be phantasmal and worthless, issuing in a dreary and fatal waste
of human effort, or beset with intellectual and moral confusion to
those who engage in it. Such warnings can hardly be said to apply
to the present investigation. And if the outcome of our inquiry only
establishes the fact that what appeared supernormal and transcen
dental is, after all, explicable by an extension of known perceptive
powers, even then our time will not have been wasted, for we shall
have enlarged our knowledge of human faculty and human usefulness.
For my own part, I have been driven to believe that some dowsers—
' ' Whose exterior semblance doth belie
The Soul's immensity "
nevertheless give us a glimpse of—
" The eternal deep
Haunted for ever by the eternal mind."
Conclusion.
(1) For some centuries past certain individuals locally known as
dowsers have declared that they can discover the presence of under
ground water, mineral lodes, coal,1 building stone,2 or other buried
objects which may be sought for by the apparently spontaneous
motion of the so-called divining rod; when their pretensions have
been tested, the result, though by no means uniformly in their favour,
has been so remarkable that chance coincidence appears a wholly
inadequate explanation.
(2) Any explanation based upon trickery or unconscious hints from
bystanders, or the detection of faint surface indications of the con
cealed object, or other known cause is insufficient to cover all the facts.
(3) The movement of the rod or forked twig is only a special case
of motor automatism exhibited by a large number of individuals,3
1 Both Pennet and Bleton were tested for this a century ago, and several
competent witnesses were convinced of the fact.
* See, for example, the full and excellent narrative of a Belgian dowser, given by
Professor D' Outrcpoint, translated by Mr. Bennett, Assistant-Secretary of the
S.P.E., and published in the Journal of the S.P.R. for June, 1899.
8 A century ago Professor Sementini estimated that 80 per cent, of Italians could
"work " the rod, but Amoretti thinks this number excessive ; he gives 20 per cent.
My own impression is that Amoretti is not far wrong. In England, perhaps, cne
or two in every dozen persons would be found susceptible.

and arises from a subconscious and involuntary " suggestion " im
pressed on the mind of the dowser.
(4) Accompanying the involuntary and usually unconscious mus
cular contraction which causes the motion of the forked twig or rod,
many dowsers experience a peculiar malaise and some a violent
convulsive spasm. This is a psycho-physiological effect, akin to
emotion. Moreover, the state of mono-ideism of the dowser creates
a condition of partial catalepsy when some suggestion causes the idea
to culminate.
(5) This subconscious suggestion may arise from a variety of
causes ; sometimes it is merely an auto-suggestion, at others it is
unconsciously derived through the senses from the environment, but
in a certain number of those who exhibit motor automatism the sug
gestion appears to be due to some kind of transcendental perceptive
power.
(6) Such persons appear only able to exercise this transcendental
faculty when their normal self-consciousness is more or less in abey
ance, or when it is completely submerged, as in profound hypnosis.
(7) This subconscious perceptive power, commonly called "clair
voyance," may provisionally be taken as the explanation of those
successes of the dowser which are inexplicable on any grounds at
present known to science.
I wish to add a word of hearty thanks to the Editor of our
Proceedings, Miss Johnson, for the kind assistance she has rendered
in the reading of the proofs of this paper and for many useful
suggestions.

APPENDIX A.
REPORT ON SOME CASES OF WATER - FINDING BY THE
DIVINING ROD.
By E. Westlake, F.G.S.
During the printing of Professor Barrett's paper published in
July, 1897, I made an analysis of his cases, and selected forty in which
it was stated that, prior to the dowser's success, a deeper but
unsuccessful well or boring had been made in the immediate
neighbourhood. These are cited, at the foot of page 2-52 of his paper,
as offering presumptive evidence of something in dowsing beyond
chance or experience. As it seemed desirable they should be looked
into from a geological point of view, I have since undertaken, at
Professor Barrett's request, an examination of twenty-one of them, i.e.,
of seventeen published in his paper (Nos. 9, 17, 24, 26, 27, 286,
42, 43, 47, 48, 57, 60, 77, 90, 99, 105, and 121),1 and of four others
subsequently received. Beyond aiding in their understanding, I soon
found that geology had little to do with the matter ; the dowser
does not profess, and probably seldom has, a knowledge of it ; his
conclusions seem usually drawn from more obvious considerations.
In psychological experiments, essentially modifiable by suggestion,
it is absolutely necessary to have the conditions, if not under control,
at any rate precisely recorded ; if they are not, it is impossible to
arrive at certain results. An observer coming after the event must
allow that the dowser may have seen, or heard of, the position of
neighbouring water, and have drawn his conclusions accordingly. -
This I have done throughout the paper, with the result, it may be,
of minimising marvels that really exist : if so, it will only need
experiments more precisely noted to lead to their establishment.
Of the twenty-one cases I examined, five were in the South and
sixteen in the West of England ; seventeen similar cases in the North
and East I was unable to visit. Those in the Isle of Wight I saw in
November, 1897; those in Surrey and Sussex in June, 1898, and
those in the Wrest of England in May, 1899. I have arranged them,
according to evidential considerations, in the following groups,

Owing to remoteness of date, I have been unable to obtain
sufficient information about these cases to include them in a critical
examination, but append the following notes : —
No. 24. Sodbury.—The Rev. R. S. Nash, of Old Sod bury
Vicarage, writes that in 1853, the date of the publication of Phippen's
book, the Rev. Mr. Foster was rector of Dodington, about one mile
S.W. of Sodbury. The Rev. J. A. James, the present rector, informs
me that there are three wells on the premises, the deepest of which is
about 60 feet. The water in it stands two or three feet from the
surface, and has never been lowered to 20 feet even in two exception
ally dry summers, so that nothing is now known about the alleged
tunnel. The strata are Lower Lias, as in the celebrated case at
Shepton Mallet Station (Group (e), No. 60), to which this is, therefore,
closely parallel.
No. 26. Shepton Mallet Gaol. —I am informed by a warder, Mr.
J. G. Barnes, that all the wells at the prison are filled up ; but the
strata being Lower Lias, and only a quarter of a mile west of the well
in No. 60, the geological conditions are doubtless similar.
1 Tho term "old well" designates the deeper, but unsuccessful, well sunk prior
to the dowser's.
xxxviii.] Appendix A 317
No. 48. Well at Mr. Samuel Lang's Kennels, Bristol.—Inquiries in
Bristol elicited that Mr. Lang had not been heard of for some years.
Professor Lloyd Morgan, F.R.S., tells me that the kennels were at
the further end of Cold Harbour Lane, Redland, on Lower Lias or
Rhaetic, so that we have here another case of a tunnelled well in this
formation. Seven out of the eighteen cases which follow were also in
Lower Lias, which thus appears to present conditions, i.e., as to
difficulty of finding water, which are adapted to the dowser's art.
Group (b) —Old Well Too Deep.
Yarlington House [Additional Case]. In a letter to Mr. Andrew
Lang, Mr. T. E. Rogers, M.A., Deputy Chairman of the Somerset
Quarter Sessions, Chancellor of the Diocese of Bath and Wells, etc.,
writes :—,
Yarlington House, Whicanton, December 4th, 1897.
Over fifty years ago a very respectable farmer at Ditcheat, Kingston by
name, a tenant of Squire Dawes, was well known in this part of the country
for his success in the discovery of underground springs.
In my own case he was attended with extraordinary success. My grand
father, when building this house in 1782, sank 135 ft. for a well, and only
then came to a very slight supply ; so trifling, that after having for some
few years drawn up water with the aid of a donkey, he closed the well
altogether, and used to send nearly half a mile for spring water. Upon my
sending for this man Kingston, in 1846, he found a spring not 20 yards
from the old well, which has quite sufficiently supplied the house, and at a
depth of about 32 ft.
I should mention that Kingston used not a thorn but the main-spring of
a watch. He had no idea how the action was produced, and was not
conscious of any sensation passing through him. He assured me that the
influence acted with equal force on the main-spring in his hand whether the
spring [of water] was 10 or 50 yards deep. I have walked with him holding
one end of the main-spring, which in my hand was perfectly atiS" and
immobile, while the end in his hand was twisting and turning so violently
that, unless he let it go, it must inevitably have snapped ; and on some
occasions it did absolutely snap T F R i
On visiting Yarlington, Mr. Rogers showed me the sites of the two
wells, which are about 40 yds. apart. He informed me that the
depth of the old well was 130 ft. or a little more, and that the water
in the new well was found at a depth of 35 ft. in oolite.
At the entrance lodge, 300 yds. E.N.E. of the new well, and on
the same level, is a well 40 ft. deep, containing 5 ft. of water : the
lodgekeeper said it was a good supply, sinking only 3 ft. in the
driest summers.
Mr. Rogers said that below the loose oolite (Inferior Oolite) which
forms the top of the hill, is a little layer of marl, and below this a
318 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part
sandy loam (Midford Sands). The oolite and sands are seen in the
sides of the road going down to Yarliugton village, about 130 feet
below the house.
From the water in the wells at the house and the lodge occurring
at the same level in the same horizontal bed of limestone, I infer that
it is held up by the marl and forms a continuous stratum, which in
the old well was lost by penetrating into the permeable sands below.
Since writing the above, I see that sheet 18 of the Geological
Survey, which was published July 5th, 1850, four years after the new
well was sunk, shows a line of fault passing N. and S. exactly over
it ; but, as there is no reason to suppose that geological maps are
drawn with this degree of accuracy, it is more likely, if a fault has
anything to do with the matter, that the old well was on it, since its
tendency would be to let out the water at the bottom—in which case
the dowser may claim whatever credit there is for not putting his well
on the same line. Mr. Rogers has revised the foregoing.
Group (c)—Old Well on the Side of a Hill.
A well so situated is no evidence for any unusual faculty in a
dowser who finds a better supply in the interior of the hill at a slightly
higher level, especially where the escarpment is steep and the strata
rather impermeable, as in the case of two wells (Nos. 2 and 3) on
either side of Locking churchyard (see Group (d), No. 28, par 2 ; p. 321).
Group (d)—Dowser's Well the Deeper.
No. 9. Eeercreech Junction. — [An unsuccessful well was sunk to nearly the
same depth as a second, which was located with the twig 6yds. from it, and
yielded 36,000 gallons a day. Date about 1892. Proceedings S.P.R., Vol.
XIII., V. 33.]
The well at Messrs. Roles' milk factory is situated a few yards
to the south of the railway station. The strata are the upper part
of the Lower Lias. The proprietor called an old man answering
to the name of Tommy, who had worked in the unsuccessful well. He
said it was from 50 to 55 ft. deep in hard blue marl, and that about
40 to 50 ft. down they had tunnelled in three directions —in one
direction for about 17 ft. This well is now filled up.
The new well is 12 to 15 ft. distant from the old one The
proprietor said its depth was from 65 to 67 ft., and that it contained
over 40 ft. of water. The top soil consisted of 10 to 12 ft. of
yellow clay, blue at the bottom, and below this 55 ft. of very hard
blue marl which had to be blasted, but which fell to pieces on exposure
to the weather. At the bottom was a thin seam of " scale " or hard
rock about half an inch thick, and on breaking through this the water
rose quickly. About 3,000 gallons a day are used for the milk factory.

At Owley Farm, about 180 yds. S.W. of the wells and about 18 ft.
lower, is an old well 49 ft. deep, containing 44| ft. of water. The
bottom of this well is thus on a level with that of Roles' new well,
and the water in it also stands apparently at the same level. From
this we may infer that the strata are approximately horizontal, and
that the same stratum of artesian water has been tapped in each case.
I therefore quite agree with "Tommy," who said, referring to the
unsuccessful well, " I believe if we had gone down deeper we should
have found the spring." Mr. H. J. Roles, to whom I submitted the
foregoing, writes : —•" Your report re the well at this place appears to
me to bo correct."
The local opinion of the difficulty of finding potable water is shown
by the circumstance that the supply for the Junction is brought by rail.
No. 17. Sturminster Newton. —[A well was sunk 50 ft. without a drop of
water. Mr. J. F. Young and three of his family pointed out a spot a few
yards away where a well was sunk, which at a less depth delivers a plentiful
supply. Proceedings S.'P.R., Vol. XIII., p. 40.]
The wells referred to by Mr. Young are situated a few hundred
feet from an escarpment of Corallian rock (Coral Rag on Calcareous
Grit) about 50 ft. high, facing west and overlooking the river Stour.
The "village doctor," Dr. J. Comyns Leach, The Lindens, Sturminster,
informed me that the unsuccessful well, referred to by Mr. J. F. Young,
was sunk by him (the doctor) at the house about 60 yds. to the N.E. of
his own, now occupied by Dr. R. A. Beaver. It was first sunk to a
depth of about 35 ft., when it held 16 ft. of water, but on sinking it
3 ft. lower the water was lost. In June, 1893, the well sinker lost
his life in the well from bad air, in consequence of which it was
abandoned, after going to a total depth of 41 feet.
The second or successful well is 30 yds. from the first, and was
placed at a convenient spot in the stable yard without reference to
any predictions by Mr. Young or his family, of which the doctor was
unaware. It is 45 ft. deep and holds 6 or 7 ft. of water.
Eighty yards west of the second well, there is at the doctor's own
house a third well (marked P. on the Ordnance map), which is only
38 ft. deep and holds from 7 to 14 ft. of water, according to the season.
Hence, as these three wells are on level ground, and in a tolerably
pervious rock, there is nothing remarkable in having found water in
the stable well below the bottom of the unsuccessful one. Dr. Leach,
who has revised this account, never had to pay for carting water ;
and this is confirmed by Mr. J. F. Young's father, Mr. Robert Young
(the author of works in the Dors.'t dialect), to whom, as also to Mr.
J. F. Young, I have submitted the foregoing. The latter writes that
his report to Professor Barrett was first sent for local correction, but
320 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part
that probably part of the information sent him might have been based
upon hearsay.
No. 27. Shepton Mallet Brcicery. —[A boring was carried to some 140 feet
without success. Then the water-finder, Sims, indicated a spot on another
part of the premises, where a well was sunk and a magnificent spring was
discovered in a fault of the rock at a depth of 40 feet. Proceedings S.P.R.,
Vol. XIII., p. 49.]
The diviner in this case was Mr. Charles Sims, a professional
dowser, now living at Pilton, a village rather more than two miles
from Shepton Mallet. The Anglo-Bavarian Brewery is situated on
a submerged island of Carboniferous Limestone, and the unsuccessful
well was sunk in the front yard, through Lower Lias and Limestone,
to a depth, according to a foreman who had been present, of about
100 or 120 ft., the lower half of this being a 6 inch boring.
Mr. Sims' well is in the hamlet of Bowlish, 500 yds. distant from
the unsuccessful well and 95 ft. below it. The land is at the extreme
point of the Company's premises, and was acquired consequent on
the successful sinking. The well is 22 ft. in diameter and 40 ft.
deep. It is in the bottom of a narrow valley, and 65 ft. south of a
small stream, the river Sheppey, which runs west from Shepton
Mallet. Just above the well a quarry is being worked in littoral
Lower Lias limestones without the usual clayey partings ; on the
other side of the valley, 200 yds. to the north, is a protrusion of
Carboniferous limestone ; but the well itself, according to Mr. Phillis,
a geologist formerly at the brewery, is almost certainly in Lias.
He said they got no water at first even at 40 ft ; but he went
down the well, and, seeing a place that looked damp, told them he
thought they would get it by driving there, which they did, and it
was found to drain the wells in Coombe Lane to the south. The
water came in from both sides of the valley, but he thought it too far
from the stream to filter through, though possible. The supply was
insufficient for the brewery, and is now discontinued in favour of that
from an open spring at Darshill, a mile lower down the valley.
The case is not evidential on account of the wells being so remote
the successful one being also the lower of the two, and placed at the
most likely spot for water. This was also the opinion of the people
at the brewery and of Mr. Phillis, who have both revised the above.
No. 28. Locking. —[Two wells, Nos. 3 and 4, sunk without a dowser,
33 ft. and 12 ft. deep respectively, are dry during summer. No. 1, a dowsed
well, 150 yds. distant, is 20 ft. deep and has a constant supply. No. 2, a
dowsed well on the Vicarage lawn 120 yds. distant, is 31 ft. deep with ft
plentiful and constant supply. Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. XIII., p. 50.]
xxxviii.] Appendix A. 321
On visiting Locking, in company with our informant, Mr. W.
G. Hellier, I found (referring to the sketch-map given on page 51
of Professor Barrett's paper) that just north of well No. 4 an east
and west fault throws down horizontal Lias on the north against
Red Marls on the south. The marl has been worked out by a stream,
and the dowsed well (No. 1 ) is in the bottom of the valley not far from
the same ; whereas the non-dowsed wells (Nos. 3 and 4) are near the
top and bottom respectively of the steep scarp of Lias, and are not
less than 30 and 10 ft. respectively higher than No. 1. Hence, as
No. 1 reaches a level 20 ft. or more deeper than either of them, the
occurrence of a constant supply of water in it is no evidence for
dowsing. «
The church and vicarage on the top of the hill are on practically
level ground, which, at the other dowsed well (No. 2), may be a few
(say 5) feet above No. 3 : No. 2 is also stated to be 2 ft. shallower,
and to contain plenty of water. On the other hand, No. 3 is sunk on
the steep side of the hill, which cannot be expected to hold water so
well as at No. 2, some 50 yds. back from the edge.
Locking is the only place where I did not take measurements ;
going round with Mr. Hellier I could not at the time, and it did not
seem worth while to return for the purpose. At the well on Sandford
Green, which we next visited, I found the measurements had been
correctly given by Mr. Hellier, so presume those he gives for Locking
are correct. The well is in Red Marl of the Trias, and contained
19£ ft. of water. The site of the old well, now filled up, was about
20 ft. distant, but, as no record of its depth has been kept, no
conclusion can be drawn.
Ladyswood Park [Additional Case].—The following paragraph
appears in the Bristol Times and Mirror of March 7th, 1891, p. 16 ;
and, with the words in brackets, in the Medium of March 13th,
p. 167 :—
Ever since the erection of the new mansion at Ladyswood Park, Sherston
Magna [Wiltshire], the question of its water supply has been one of trouble
and serious consideration. A few years ago, Sir T. Dancer, Bart., had two
wells sunk, but without success in finding water. The estate having recently
been purchased by Mr. Francis Davis, he determined to requisition the
services of Daniel Lacy [a local diviner]. Lacy went to work with his little
twig, and discovered a spring about 15 yds. from the two existing useless
wells. He at once set his men to work, and after sinking to a depth of
60 ft. found an abundant spring, the output being practically inexhaustible.
Ladyswood Park is the " Ladyswood Farm " of the old one-inch
map ; it is about a mile S.E. of Sherston, on a plain of Forest
Marble. On visiting Ladyswood in May, 1899, Mr. Davis showed me
2 a
322 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part
the position of the three wells, and said he had just measured the
depth of Lacy's, which was 74 ft, and that the water stood 53 ft.
from the surface, higher than he had ever known it before. I then
saw Sidney Lacy, of Sherston, who said he had helped his father sink
the well, which was in thin bedded rock much the same all the way
down. They struck the water at the bottom after putting in a blast.
The new well is certainly lower than the old one, but they would not
have got water by sinking the old one deeper, because his father, after
trying the stick, said they would not, and he had never known his
father wrong.
With regard to the old wells, Sidney Lacy said he went down the
second (B) u. remove the pump, and should think the depth was from
60 to 70 ft., but couldn't say exactly. The first (A) was also about
60 ft. : it was Lawrence, of Bristol, who dowsed it and sunk it. Mr.
Davis said the B well was sunk by Mr. Simon Evans, of Sherston.
Evans said that, as near as he remembered, its depth was 44 or 54 ft.,
with some water, and that on boring another 25 ft. with a three-inch
bore they got plenty : the A well was, he said, 25 ft. deep, with no
water.
As water in thin-bedded, horizontal limestones would probably lie
in a uniform stratum, the failure of the old wells is sufficiently
explained by, according to Lacy's figures, their not having been sunk
deep enough, or, according to Evans', not deep enough to hold the
water met with in his boring.
Group (e)—Heading driven towards Known Water.
No 42. Henbury. —[In this case Mr. Crisp, the architect, writing in 1883,
says that when water was required at Mr. Butterworth's new house, a
geologist predicted plenty at a depth of 150 ft., where he said the Mountain
Limestone rested on a bed of clay. They sank 150 ft. and bored 10 ft., but
found no water. Then the diviner, Lawrence, predicted water about 20 ft.
from the well, and advised driving a heading about 100 ft. from the surface.
They drove 30 ft., and got a good and regular supply. Proceedings S.P.R.,
Vols. II., p. 104, and XIII., p. 67.]
Rockwell, which is the name of Mr. Butterworth's house, now
occupied by Mr. Frank Jolly, is situated on the north side of the
road, one mile S.W. of Henbury and five from Bristol. The well is
in Mountain Limestone, and about 50 yds. from its escarpment,
which runs parallel to the Severn and shows the rock much faulted
and contorted, as it was in the well. This escarpment is a Triassic
cliff flanked by a beach deposit of Dolomitic Conglomerate. On the
lower slopes are Red Marls which help to hold up the water in the
limestone ; the ground at the foot of the hill at Lawrence Weston
being 120 ft. or more below the ground at the welL
xxxviii.] Appendix A. 323
The principal point omitted in previous reports of this case is the
existence of an old well 123 yds. to the S.S.W. of Rockwell well and
123 ft. deep, with water standing 94 ft. from the surface. This
old well belongs to a disused Friends' Meeting House : the place is
now called Fern Hill and is occupied by Mr. H. Fedden. At Rockwell
well the ground is about 19 ft. below the old well, and the water stands
81 ft. from the surface, or about 6 ft. below the water in the old well,
which, allowing for the distance, shows both wells to be probably
in the same stratum of water. And, as Rockwell well is 150 ft. deep,
the bottom of it is 75 ft. below the level of the water in the old well.
The heading at Rockwell runs from the well under the front of the
house, which lies to the S.S.W. The length of the heading, Mr. Jolly
told me, is about 75 ft. ; but Mr. Crisp, the architect, in his report
says it is about 30 ft. ; and Mr. Mereweather, the contractor, gives it
as 24 ft. ; the important point is the direction, directly towards
the old well.
Mr. Mereweather informed me that the Rockwell well was sunk
without getting water beyond a soakage from the top layers after
rain ; he noticed, however, a damp place on one side about 100 ft.
from the top ; Mrs. Bengough then tried the ground with a divining
rod, which turned at a point 16 ft. from the well. Mrs. Bengough in
her own account {Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. II., p. 104) says the distance
was about 6 ft., and that Lawrence came later the same afternoon, and
in the presence of herself and of many persons who had witnessed her
trials, pointed to the same place. [Crisp says the point Lawrence
indicated was about 20 feet from the well.]
Mr. Mereweather told me that neither Mrs. Bengough nor Lawrence
went down the well, and that he was not present when Lawrence came.
But as we cannot now be sure that Mereweather's information about
the damp place had not reached one or both of them indirectly, or that
they had not heard of the old well —which indeed the old house itself
was sufficient to suggest—it remains doubtful whether Lawrence's in
dication shows more than knowledge normally acquired. At any rate
he proposed the obvious course of driving a heading in the direction of
the old well, and 25 ft. below the level of the water in it.
No. 60. Sheptmi Mallet Station.—[The contractors write in 1882 that in
1874 they sank a well 103 (or 90) ft. through blue lias rock with no traces
of water. Then John Mullins with a twig predicted an abundance at 15 (or
50) ft. from the well, and advised a heading, on driving which the water
rushed in and the miners rushed out, and their tools and watches are there
till this day. Proceedings S.P.R., Vols. II., p. 107, and XIII., p. 86].
The well in question supplies locomotives at Charlton Station, of
the Somerset and Dorset Railway, on the eastern side of Shepton
2 a 2
324 Professor W. F. Barrett, [part
Mallet ; it is placed between the rails and the building marked
"Tank" on the 25-inch map. My principal informant here was Wm.
Baiss, an old man at the station, who said that, though not present
when Mullins found the water, he was working on the railway near
by and heard all about it. He said they sank through several sorts
of stone to a depth of 90 ft., without water. (Mr. Hickes, in the
Daily Graphic, also gives the depth as 90 ft. ; Mr. Whitaker, the
locomotive superintendent at Highbridge, writes that it is now about
80 ft.) Then about 8 or 9 ft. from the bottom they drove a heading
in an easterly direction through some blue marl, and struck a spring
at from 15 to 20 ft. from the well. No red marl was met with, and
he thinks the well is probably all in Lias. Mr. John Phillis, a local
geologist (who has revised this account), agrees in this, and does not
think they got down on the limestone (Carboniferous), the nearest
outcrop of which is a mile distant. The engine-attendant stated
that they pumped some 20,000 gallons a day, which has never failed
even in the driest summers. Mr. Whitaker says that, when no
pumping is done, the water stands below rail level about 37 ft. in
winter and about 51 ft. in summer.
At a point 280 yds. north-east of the well, at the bottom of a
valley in which runs a little stream—the river Sheppey—rises an open
spring. It supplies Charlton brewery, and may have been long known,
as the Roman Fosseway passes within a few feet of it. Its escaping
level is 43 ft. below the ground at the station well, and hence within a
foot of the average level of the water in it.
Close by the station well, and on the same side of the rails, a
quarry shows 15 ft. of Lower Lias, dense, well-jointed blue and white
limestones in beds of about one foot thick, alternating with from
one to three inches of hard blue sandy clay. Notwithstanding the
generally impermeable appearance of these beds, we must take it as
possible, not to say probable, that, with a head of 50 ft. of water at
a point variously given as from 15 to 50 ft. distant from the well,
there would be at least a dampness on that side. In the account
written by the contractors in 1882 [Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. II.,
p. 107), we read that "on his arrival he [Mullins] went down the
well," so that his location of the water "after he came up" cannot
now be taken as showing more than his conscious or unconscious
observation, or inference from the position of the brewery spring,
which he was probably told of, as I was.
Since writing this I have seen the quarry a few hours after heavy
rain and found it hold the water, except in the N.E. corner, where a
main joint, running exactly in the direction of the brewery spring,
forms a swallow-hole. It was doubtless such a joint as this that
Mullins' heading cut into.

Group (f)—Dowser's Well near Known Water; Old Well
usually Remote.
No. 43 (the same as No. 59) Hedgecocks. —[The architect, who in 1878
(or 1879) was erecting a house for Mr. J. T. Ronton, at Hedgecock's Farm,
writes in 1883 that the contractors "proceeded to form a well close to the
new building, and had bored a very considerable distance without coming to
water." Then Liwrence predicted water a few yards from the boring, and
they sank about 40 ft. (some 42 ft.) exactly on a good spring B, which, he
believes, continues to supply the house. There was an old well A some
100yds. distant with little or no water. Proceedings S.P.R., Vols. II., pp.
103-104 ; and XIII., p. 68.
In 1897, W. Renton, son of J. T. R., writes that the two wells, about
27 ft. deep, were only land springs and apt to get dry. So he had John
Mullins divine a place, C, within six inches of which he found a good supply
at about 26 ft. He also employed Mullins on three other successful wells.
Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. XIII., p. 86.]
Hedgecock's Farm is on the border of Sussex about four miles N.W. of
Horsham. On visiting it in June, 1898, I found it in the occupation of the
Duchess di Santo Teodora, and the name changed to Oakwood House ; and
now (1899) to Oak Grange. Mr. Jupp, a well sinker, who had been employed
on Mullins' wells, told me there were three wells on the premises, of which
two had been found by Mullins about 1893. One C, at the back of the house,
now built over, is, he said, in hard blue marl 25 ft. deep with only 2^ ft. of
water, and can be pumped out in about twenty minutes, though Mullins said
there was water sufficient for everything. Another well, D, marked by
Mullins close to the road some 50 yds. west of the house, is 20 ft. deep
in blue marl and has a good lot of water. Another, E, dug about 1893
is 15 (or 30) ft. deep and supplies the vineries.
I also saw a new well, F, that had just been sunk 100yds. or so north
of the house, 43 or 44 ft. deep in soft dark marl (Weald Clay). A slight
spring had been met with at 25 ft. ; and at 40 ft. in a dove-colored marl
water was found, which rose 7 ft. in a night and stands about 21 ft. from the
surface.
Thus against one unsuccessful boring we have at least six successful
wells, of which A and F sunk without a dowser are 27 and 44 ft. deep ; while
the dowsed wells B, C, and D, are 42, 25, and 20 ft. As the ground is
approximately level, I infer a main water-bearing bed at about 40 ft. and a
minor one at from 20 to 25 ft.
This is supported by the occurrence of water at other points along the
level ridge which extends from Hedgecocks over two miles westwards to
Rudgwick (Ridgewick). Thus the entrance lodge has a draw-pump ; the
adjoining cottage, 15 ft. lower, has a well 25 ft. deep ; Rudge Farm,
600yds. W., has a draw-pump ; a cottage 1,600 yds. W. has a well 18ft.
deep with 5 ft. of water ; and a quarter mile further a spring rises about
13 ft. below the top of the ridge.
This ridge is the first high ground in the Weald south of Leith Hill, and
represents the escarpment of a hard or porous bed ; which, according to
Topley (Geology of the Weald, p. 104) is the same, " No. 2, sand and sand
stone," that forms the water-bearing bed at Warnham Lodge, ljf miles
326 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part
E.S.E.—already described, Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. XIII., pp. 278-279.
The elevation, about 280 ft. O.D., is also the same.
At Hedgecocks, though the bed is less permeable, water seems to have
been found everywhere except in the contractors' boring, the actual depth
of which I have been unable to ascertain ; in their letter (Vol. II., p. 103)
they do not refer to it at all. If as deep as the wells, it corresponds with
the dry ground in the Warnham Lodge bed. The case is interesting from
the successful employment of two leading English dowsers, though the
necessity for their services may not be altogether demonstrated.
No. 47. Park Farm.—[Lawrence marked two spots at each of which,
after boring 10 ft., water was struck. As many persons said water might be
found anywhere in the field, the tenant, as a test, bored to the same depth
midway between the places, and found the subsoil to be perfectly dry.
Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. XIII., p. 71.]
This is the same place as the " Parks Farm " of the old
one-inch map : it is on the Gloucester Road, S.E. of Frampton-on-
Severn, and two miles north of Dursley Junction. The subsoil is stiff
clay of the Lower Lias. Lawrence's well is just outside the garden
gate, and is, Mrs. Prout said, 25 ft. deep ; 10 yds. south of it is a pond
about 10 yds. in diameter and 2 ft. deep, the level of which is 4J ft.
below the ground at the well.
Sixty yards north of the well is another pond about 15 yds. in
diameter. The unsuccessful boring was made midway between these
ponds.
The other successful boring was made, I was informed, by a man
on the farm, about 20 yds. to the north of the north pond ; he said
they got at the bottom a sort of marly stuff, not very hard, in which
the water came.
Mrs. Prout said that the water in Lawrence's well is salt, and is
not used, and that all the water to Stonehouse is salt. The ponds go
dry in summer, but Lawrence came at the end of March, or beginning
of April, when they were full.
I think the proximity of the successful borings to the ponds (10
and 20yds.) raises a presumption of their connection; and similarly
the boring midway between the ponds may have been unsuccessful on
account of its comparative remoteness.
I have not been able to communicate with Mr. Prout, but the
steward, Mr. T. T. Vizard, of Dursley, writes in regard to the fore
going :—" Your particulars are, so far as I know, correct. I do not
think the well can be supplied with water from the ponds near,
because I believe the ponds become dry in the summer, but that the
well always contains water."
Perhaps, however, as the well is not used, it would be safer to say
that there is no evidence either way, as water would remain below
ground after drying at the surface.

No. 57. Norton Hall. —[A neighbour had bored through over 1,200 ft. of
Lias clay, then over 100 ft. more, and got no water he could utilise. At the
lodge local well-sinkers got no water at 30 ft. J. Mullins predicted water
in the stable yard at about 30 ft., which was found at about that, and rose
20 ft. He also predicted close to the house a very strong spring about
20 ft. down, and on sinking 17 ft. it came so fast they could sink no further.
Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. XIII., p. 84.]
This is the same place as the " Lower Norton Farm " of the
old one-inch map : it is three miles north of Campden. The Hall
stands at the end of a ridge of Lower Lias. Mr. Bruce said that die
" gravel " in the clay consists of pebbles, which is suggestive of
Drift (?). He gave me every facility for examining the wells at -the
house, of which there are three, viz :—
(a) An old well in the house yard 25 ft. deep, and 11 ft. 9 in. to
the water ; supply insufficient ; this had been shown to Mullins.
(4) Mullins' well in the stable yard, 28 ft. 6 in. deep, and 8 ft. 9 in.
to the water.
(c) Mullins' well, " close to the house," by the drawing-room window,
17 ft. deep, and 1 1 ft 8 in. to the water.
On levelling, I found c to be 6 in. above a, and a 2 ft. 5 in. above 6.
Hence the water in b and c is at the same level, and that in a 7 in.
lower. But a had been pumped that morning. Hence the water in
all three wells is on a level. Mr. Bruce said also that pumping a
lowers c. Hence the water in all three wells is in the same stratum.
The unsuccessful well at the entrance lodge, though on the same
ridge and nearly the same level as the Hall, is 6OO yds. distant. It is
probably in a different stratum, and at any rate is too remote to be any
proof of the absence of water at other points in the neighbourhood
of a, b, and c.
Mr. Bruce, who has revised the foregoing, writes : —" I have always
thought that immediately round my house was ' Oolite ' (' Brash ' the
country people call it) but only a little on the surface and a very
limited area, 100 yds. or so." If stone occurs here it would tend to
form a natural reservoir. He adds, "The deep boring is at Kift's
Gate, 1 J miles to N.E. of this, and lies a good deal higher "—i.e., on
or near Meon Hill (Marlstone, or top of the Lower Lias).
No. 77. A mold's. — [The owner writes that the old well, about GO ft. deep,
had a quite inadequate supply, and was bored 100 ft. without getting more.
He says, "I sent for W. H. Mullins, and he said there was water at about
GO ft. deep on the top of a hill 300 yds. from the old well. He dug a well
on the site and found water at a depth of 90 ft., and now we have an abun
dant supply." Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. XIII., p. 99.]
This place is in Surrey about three-quarters of a mile south of
Holmwood Station, and is all on the upper part of the Weald Clay.

Mr. Bayley said that the old well at the house was 60 ft deep in grey,
soapy, shaley clay, and gave an inadequate supply of water ; it was
bored another 100 ft. without getting any more.
Mr. W. H. Mullins' well is about 650 yds. distant at the northern
extremity of the property. It is close to the railway, on a little rising
ground so as to be convenient for gravitation, and is 40 yds. from and
18 ft. above a stream of water which is fed by springs from Leith
Hill and flows all the year round. Mr. Bayley's gardener informed
me that the well was sunk 99 ft. deep in grey, soapy clay without
stone (Weald Clay). There were little springs the size of a straw all
the way down, but the supply was small — about 3 ft. in the twenty-
four hours—and it became necessary to augment it.
Between the well and the stream is a narrow, flat piece of ground
apparently alluvial in character, and about midway on this the rod
indicated water. Here, 6£ ft. above the stream, a second well was
sunk to a depth of 10 ft., and an abundant supply was found which
rises to about the level of the stream. This supply is carried through
by a drain into the first well, which, in Mr. Bayley's letter ( Proceedings
S.P.R., Vol. XIII., p. 99) gets all the credit of it.
As, however, I see no reason to suppose that the water comes from
anywhere but the adjoining stream, I cannot regard this case as
showing more than ordinary observation.
No. 90. Woodside, Wootton, Isle of Wight.—[An old well, B, 12ft. deep
had a small supply very scarce through the summer. Another well, A, was
sunk 120 ft. and got no water. The diviner, W. Stone, then indicated an
enormous spring at a point 200 ft. from and on the same level as B, and
about 560 ft. from and 14 ft. above A. Here he sunk a well, C, 7 ft. deep,
and got an abundant supply nearly always running. Proceedings S.P.R.,
Vol. XIII., pp. 130-133.]
The unsuccessful well A (see plan on p. 132 of Professor Barrett's
paper) is about 225 yds. (not 350, as Taylor said) to the north of
Stone's well, and about 50 to 60 ft. lower (not 14 ft.l. It is
the lower part of the Bembridge Marls, and, as it is stated to be
120 ft. deep, must pass through the Bembridge Limestone into the
Osborne Marls.
The other well B, according to Mr. Taylor, the gardener at Woodside,
is 12 ft. deep, and afforded a small supply. According to Mr. W. H.
Cole, a former tenant of Wootton Farm, it was dug when the Wood-
side house was built, about 1850, and the water was brought down
in pipes. Mr. Stone's statements, that it is " 30 ft. deep and no
water," and that " the owners of the estate had never been able to
obtain water," are incorrect. This well is in sands of the Hamstead
series.
xxxviii.] Appendix A. 329
The first well sunk by Stone was, Mr. Taylor informed me, at
a point about 20 yds. to the east of B, but he did not get enough
water and the well was abandoned ; if so, Stone's statement that he
found an enormous spring in ten minutes is incorrect.
Stone then dug the well C 60 yds. to the S.E. of B, and thence
carried a trench about 80 yds. to the south as far as the road, the
ground at all these points being practically at the same level. This
trench was about 10 ft. deep and cut through gravel (Pleistocene
Plateau), sand (Hamstead Beds), and some clay (Bembridge Marls).
The water is collected by a drain and carried into C ; the principal
flow was met with a few yards from C.
More recently, in order to supply another house, another collecting
drain has been carried up on the south side of the road, and curved
round into the field to the west of Stone's drain, so as to head off the
further end of it, since when, Taylor said, there has been a noticeable
falling off in the supply. Subsequently also to Stone's visit a sand pit
has been opened about 130 yds. west of C, showing 3 ft. of gravel on
sand, in which at a depth of 15 ft. a body of water was found. The
outcrop of this sand coincides nearly with that of the plateau gravel ;
the two together forming a natural reservoir over a quarter of a mile
wide capping the hill.
Along the eastern edge of the hill I saw some ponds, and rills of
water running down to the creek : Mr. Cole said there were nine
such " runs " of water within a mile, and that they run all the
year round. I also discussed the matter with the agent for the
Woodside estate, Mr. George Barton of Wootton Farm, with Mr.
W. H. Cole, and with Mr. John Newbury of Wootton, all of whom
agreed that there was water everywhere on the top of the hill, that
it was known to every one, and that it did not want a divining rod
to find it. These opinions expressed after the event must be taken
for what they are worth ; on the other hand, the occurrence of water
at other points on the hill-top, and in particular at B, 60 yds. distant,
from which the house had been formerly supplied, was a matter of
common knowledge.
Arreton, Isle of Wight.1—The diviner, W. Stone, writes that a dry well
had been sunk to a depth of about 50 ft., within 20 yds. of which, he says,
"I discovered in a few minutes a spot beneath which a good supply of water
was flowing," and all the natives were astonished ; "I however, guaranteed
a spring at 10 ft. . . . and my men tapped water at 9 ft., which quickly

rose to the top," and he kid it on to the rectory and village by gravitation.
ProceedUqs S.P.R., Vol. XIII., pp. 130-131, 133.]
This is the only case inserted by Professor Barrett without local
inquiry, which he asks for on p. 133 of his paper ; as such it was not
numbered or claimed as evidence ; but, having been published, I give
a more correct version as showing the humours of the subject. The
village of Arreton lies at the foot of the downs that form the
central Cretaceous escarpment. Besides going over the ground, I
obtained information from Mr. George Barton, of Wootton Farm, who
had got the dowser to go to Arreton, from a resident at Arreton, and
from Mr. Orchard, the parish clerk.
They say that the dowser's quoted statements are incorrect, and
that where he placed his first reservoir he never got any water at all.
He was so sure there was water that, before getting any, he began by
making a large reservoir 9 ft. deep with pipes down to the cottages on
the S.W. side of the church. There was rain and snow at the time
(the Daily Graphic of April 18th, 1S92, says : " the snow on the 16th
was four inches deep in most parts of the Isle of Wight ") which filled
the reservoir 2 ft. deep, and with that and the water in the pipes he
got, when the tap was turned on at the cottages, a powerful jet
which was photographed ; but after a few minutes it ran out and there
has never been a drop since. The photograph appeared in the Daily
Graphic, of April 23rd, under the heading " A Water Wizard in the
Isle of Wight," together with a statement that the spring had proved
more than sufficient to supply the wants of the village.
The dowser then tried, said Mr. Orchard, to find a spring higher
up the hill by running back a trench from the top of his tank, but
when he got 22 ft. deep he got into the freestone and then he stopped,
because he knew that if he got any water it would run away. This
point would be some 30 yds. north of the reservoir. Forty yards
further up the hill Upper Greensand is seen dipping 40 deg. into the
hill, and, if the "freestone " forms its base, then the dowser's reservoir
and trench must be on the apex of a wedge of Gault Clay, the last
place in the district where there could be any water. Or if they
occupy (as according to the new six-inch geological map they do,
though I doubt its accuracy) a similar position on the outcrop of the
Carstone, a coarse, hard grit beneath the Gault, the apex of this mass
of sand rock would be equally incapable of holding water. If, as the
dowser states, an unsuccessful well was sunk within 20 yds. of his, to
a depth of 50 ft., without finding a drop of water, it shows that the
water-level in this Neocomian sandrock is still lower.
Failing to find water here, the dowser then made a second reservoir,
40 ft. below the first, on the east side of some marshy ground in a
little valley above the churchyard, and thence carried a drain alongside
xxxviii.] Appendix A. 331
the marsh some 30 yds. to the north. This reservoir is 7 to 8 ft. deep
to the spring of the dome. Its bottom, which is 5 to 6 ft. below the
level of the marsh, is a peaty " sog " (Anglice, saturated bog) through
which the water rises freely. The water contains iron and peat, and a
new supply will have to be obtained.
This case is only quoted as an illustration of the untrustworthiness
of statements made by interested parties and of newspaper reports.
No. 121. Stroud.—[A boring had been made to a depth of 70 ft. but no
water found. At a point 300 yds. distant Mr. Gataker predicted water at
50ft., and a good spring was actually found at 45ft. Proceedings S.P.R.,
Vol. XIII., p. 180.]
In this case the unsuccessful boring had been made at the
bottom of an old well at Farm Hill House, in the terrace at the
top of the lawn. The butler who showed it me said it was about
50 ft. deep, and contained plenty of water except one very dry
summer. Before Mr. Gataker came, Messrs. Orchard and Peer, of
Stroud, bored some 20 ft. at the bottom of it with the idea of
getting more water, and did not. This firm, who are not professional
well-sinkers, write that the well is 30 ft. deep, and that they bored
35 ft. deeper in clay, clay bats and marl clay. The well is about
240 yds. south of Gataker's, and at a level from 50 to 60 ft. lower.
There is also a well under the house still in use. These wells are in
the top of the Upper Lias.
Mr. Gataker's well is in the field above the house and is 45 ft.
deep, with water 24 ft. from the surface. He (Gataker) said the
water would be found 60 ft. down, but they got it at 40 ft. all
round the sides of the well. The rock, according to Mr. Bastin, the
gardener, consisted of 20 ft. of rock rubble and sandy freestone
(Inferior Oolite remanie), with yellow clay at the base : below this
was 10 ft. or so of slate-coloured clay, and several feet of loose reddish
grit like sea sand, and gravelly rubble with water (Midford Sands).
At the house of Mr. Allen's gardener, 110 yds. west of Gataker's
well and from 6 to 7 ft. above it, is a well which the gardener, Mr.
Harwood, said contained plenty of water. Mr. Riley, a working
plumber in Stroud, who had repaired it two years ago, said it was
from 35 to 40 ft. deep, and contained more than 5 and less than
1 0 ft. of water, which would make the water about 30 ft. from the
surface. Hence the water in Gataker's well stands at the same level.
There is also, 300 yds. E.S.E. of Gataker's well and from 60 to
70 ft. below it in the same field, a well 16 ft. deep, containing 8 ft.
of water, affording a small but good supply for cattle. About 50 yds.
short of this a spring rises in wet weather and forms a bog ; this,
according to the Survey map, marks the base of the Midford Sands.
332 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part
Also along the ridge going to Whiteshill (called " The Plain "—
see Geological Survey, sheet 34, N.W. corner), from quarter to half
a mile north of Gataker's well and from 65 to 50 ft. above it, are live
wells about 50 ft. deep, containing from 3 to 13 ft. of water at the
base of the Inferior Oolite.
The occurrence of these wells to the south, west, east and north
of Gataker's renders it probable that there is water everywhere in the
field ; especially as it is on the outcrop of the Midford Sands, which
are the main water-bearing bed of the district.
Mr. G. P. Milnes, the water surveyor at Stroud, who had had
charge of the job for Mrs. Holloway, agreed with me that the case
did not need a dowser.
No. 99. Melksham. —[A well was sunk 21ft. and bored a further 18 ft.,
but no water of any consequence was met with. In the extreme corner of
the field Tompkins predicted water at not over 25 ft. At 30 (or 22) ft. a
spring came up like a fountain, and has yielded a plentiful and unfailing
supply. Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. XIII., pp. 146-148.]
The town is situated just in the middle of an Oxford Clay vale.
The unsuccessful well was sunk in the meadow at the back of the
butter factory, and 33 yds. from the river Avon. It contained a little
water which percolated from the river.
Mr. Tompkins' well is from 80 to 90 yds. to the W.S.W. of
the first well, and 50 yds. from the river and from 10 to 12 ft. above
it. The water is 1 1 ft. from the surface. The engineer said there
was a good supply, and he did not think it had to do with the river.
The soil, Mr. Maggs' son said, was stiff white clay and blue marl
without any rock, and he thought was mostly made ground, as they
found pipes and old chain. Since the feather factory had cut a drain
-20 ft. deep, some 30 yds. to the south of the well, it had not had so
much water ; this a neighbour confirmed, and said that lots of water
was met with in the drain at the point nearest to the well. There is
also a well which supplies an old house some 40 yds. from Tompkins
well on the side remote from the river.
Hence, as Tompkins' well is in what appears to be an alluvial flat,
where water was known to exist within 50 yds. on either side, I cannot
regard its occurrence at the point indicated by him as surprising. He
did, however, find a much larger supply and at a greater distance from
the river than in the first well.
Mr. J. Maggs, who has revised the foregoing, writes :—" In my
opinion the general tendency of [your] report is to minimise the
importance of Tompkins' well.
"But the facts are: The first well was absolutely useless as a water
supply, whilst the present one rarely fails to supply 3,000 to 5,000
xxxvin.] Appendix A. 333
gallons daily. Further, Tompkins was unacquainted with the neigh
bouring well. Water was found at the precise depth named by
Tompkins, and, when tapped, the men at work in the well had to
hurry up or would have been overwhelmed with the sudden rush."
Two attempts I made to interview the well-sinker failed, so that
I cannot say whether Tompkins hit on a permeable stratum in the
Oxford Clay or on a permeable patch in the river alluvium.

Lytus Cary [Additional Case]. —Here water was found by a dowser
at a depth of 25 ft., and only 40 ft. from a dry well 60 ft. deep.
Further off were two or three other wells, one of which contained
some potable water, which lessens the improbability of finding it, but
the spot remains an unlikely one, nor could I discover any reason for
its selection. I have described the case more fully on pp. 174-175.
Wimblekurst, Horsham [Additional Case]. —On this estate, which
is half a mile north of Horsham station, water has been found at two
places by Mr. W. H. Mullins for the owner, Mr. E. Allcard. The
well at the house is 76 ft. deep and supplies about 500 gallons a day.
Fifty yards to the north of this, Mullins found water at 25 ft. only ;
the amount, however, that has been pumped daily is comparatively
small, less than 100 gallons.
At the farm in North Heath Lane, about 350 yds. further north,
is a well 67 ft. deep which always went dry in dry seasons, though
hored to 83 ft. In October, 1897, at a point 50 yds. to the east, Mullins
predicted a spring at 70 or 80 ft., and proceeded to sink on the terms
of "no supply, no pay." Water was struck at 54ft., and the well,
which is 60 ft. deep, holds 10 ft. of water and yields a large supply.
The rock consisted of sand and sandstones of varying hardness with
some lignite and ironstone ; the water-bearing bed being a dove-
colored marl. These beds are the Upper Tunbridge Wells Sand ; and
being of freshwater origin, and hence usually lenticular and patchy,
may be expected to hold water in pockets. We have here a com
paratively large body of water standing 17 ft. above the bottom of
the old well and 33 ft. above the bottom of the boring ; the surface
of the ground being practically level, with no surface indication
whatever to show that there should be water at one place rather
than another.
Since writing this, I hear that at the two cottages by the road,
130 yds. S.W. of Mullins' well, there is a well (marked p. on the 25
inch map), only 11 ft. deep, which always supplies enough water for the
two houses. Mullins did not put his well in the direction of this
surface water ; still its occurrence diminishes the argument from its
334 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part
absence in the deep well, and makes chance discovery a possible
alternative.
Mr. Allcard, who has revised the foregoing, writes, November
16th, 1899: — "The well at the two cottages has been dry lately,
whereas Mullins' well at the farm has given a good supply all the dry
summer. What we should have done without it I do not know,
and I recommend any one wanting water to employ him, and not
waste money on chance on their own account."
No. 105. Tui/ Farm. —[The following abstract is from the accounts by
the steward, Mr. T. W. Pickard, written in 1893 and 1896 (Proceedings
S.P.R., Vol. XIII., p. 154). It includes additions received from him dated
November 6th and 25th, 1899, and the whole has had his revision : —
About 30 years ago a well was sunk at the Farm for some distance, and
then abandoned on account of bad air. After this another well was dug,
167 ft. deep, but no water was found. Some short time before 1893 I
personally took the depth ; it was then quite dry, and the old men living at
the place never remembered water there.
In 1893 Mr. Tompkins, of Chippenham, was engaged. I purposely met
him at the station and drove him to the place. He had no idea to what
part of the estate he had to go until he got there, and he had no private
conversation with any of the men there. He went over the ground tracing
all the springs to one point, 450 ft. from the old well and from 8 to 10 ft.
above it, and said that water would be found at a depth of 70 ft. I have
marked on the enclosed tracing from the 25 in. map, as near as I can
recollect, the lines he traced (they form a star of six sinuous lmes over
100 yds. long).
After he had found the place for the new well I took him to the old well,
which had been covered up with strong timber ; to mark the site there was a
small heap of mould on which cucumbers were growing. I sent him over
this with his twig, which made no movement. I then told him he had been
over an old well several times : I told him the depth, and asked him how he
thought it possible to find water nearer the surface such a short distance
away. He replied that the old well was out of the run of the springs.
We dug at the spot selected, and the first 20 ft. of chalk was rubbly
[probably decomposed]. Nearly 70 ft. down we came on a level bed of
solid flint about 6 to 9 in. thick ; and at 70 ft. on open fissures mostly
vertical, which were wet as though water had recently passed through ;
there was a very slight dribble at the time.1 At about 118 ft. we struck two
springs on opposite sides of the well giving a strong supply, and sunk an
additional 6 ft. before the water gained the upper hand. The well is 124 ft.
deep, in ordinary white chalk with flints, which continued to the bottom.
The well holds 12 ft. of water, the same as when first dug. The water at
1 Through one of those, according to Mr. Sherlock, a young man at the Farm,
a draught of air came with such force as to be heard at the surface, showing an
open fissure of great extent. He said the well takes an hour to pump out, and
refills in twelve or less.
xxxviii.] Appendix A. 335
the bottom came through vertical fissures and horizontal veins, and princi
pally from the west side from the directions Tompkins had named from
either end of the plantation (an enclosure on the hillside to the W. and
S.W.). We have since bored some 20 ft. to obtain a better supply, but T do
not think it has improved it. The old well has been filled in with the
chalk, etc., from the new one.]
This I regard as the best case I have yet met with in favour of
the dowser. The farm is situated in a remote hollow of the Sussex
downs, midway between Glynde and Newhaven. The valley of which
it is a ramification falls into the sea at Bishopstone, three miles to
the south : half way down the Newhaven Water Company are pump
ing a considerable supply from wells. The old well was close to the
farm, and the level of the ground at the well is about 260 ft. above
the sea.
The new well is 150 yds. further up the valley, and about 22 ft.
above the old well. Hence the water standing 12 ft. deep in the new
well has a level of no less than 77 ft. above the bottom of the old
well. The new well is in chalk with flints. On the heap from it, shown
in the photograph (p. 337), I found a spine of Cidaris sceptri/'era, which
is common in the zone of Micraster cor-anyuinum, so that the thick
flint-bed 70 ft. down is probably the strong and constant M. cor-
a//^»i/»t»?i-tabular described by Dr. Rowe as occurring between
Beachy and Seaford Heads about 62 ft. above the zone of M. cor-
testudinarium (Proc. Oeol. Assoc, 1900, Vol. XVI., pp. 322, 323, 329,
332, 336, Plate IX.). According to this reading the new well is sunk
entirely in the M. corangninnm chalk and to within 8 ft. of its base ;
which last may account for finding some other fossils, as two or three
specimens of 1/olaster placenta, which are commoner in the lower zone.
The bottom of the old well is similarly 57 ft. deep in the zone of
M. cor-lestudinarium and 52 ft. above its base—it being 109J ft. thick
on the coast (Ibid., p. 327).
Water in the chalk usually lies at a gentle gradient1 which is
however, modified by the density of particular beds, and by the
presence of fissures. In the lithology of the beds as seen on the
coast there is nothing to explain the absence of water in the old
well, or its preferential occurrence in the new well, which is
doubtless due to fissures. Water in chalk usually flows in fissures,
1 The gradient of water in chalk varies considerably, e.g., 13 ft. in a mile
(Clutterbuck) ; 45 and 47 ft. in a mile (Bland) ; these are normal conditions.
Exceptionally we have 93 and 102 ft. in less than a mile (Bland) ; 155 ft. in half a
mile (Lucas); and 50 or 9O ft. in less than 100 yards (Anstead). This last, which
Lucas says is greater than he had ever met with, is the only instance I have found at
all parallel to that at Toy Farm. (See Prestwich's Water-btarin,j Strata, p. 62, and
Trans. Inst. Sureeyors for 1878, Vol. X., pp. 30G-314.)

i.e., in the main planes of jointing, which in this district, as shown by
the direction of the valleys, run N. and S., and E. and W.
The narrow valley, approximately N. and S., in which the farm
lies, is slightly sickle-shaped. The house with the old well is about the
middle of the handle, so to speak, and the new well at the ferrule end,
the valley at this point being contracted by a slight bulge from the
east, which may, and probably does, indicate the position of an
underground fissure. With this may be taken the fact, noted by the
steward, Mr. Pickard, that the water flowed into the well from the
sides of the valley rather than from its upper end.
Whether Mr. Tompkins noticed a slight surface feature of this kind
—I did not myself till I was leaving and saw it foreshortened—and,
if he did, whether he drew the right inference from it, may be doubtful.
I think a geologist at any rate would have taken no account of it, but
would have advised deepening or tunnelling the old well.1 We must
remember, however, when we are dealing with automatism, that the
mere existence of a difference in the valley unnoted, still less reasoned
on, by the dowser, may have been felt by his subconsciousness, intensely
alert for every indication, and so have determined his action—on
which, unlike the geologist, he can, when his judgment fails, fall back.
He can revert to that prehuman thinking of which Cowper says :—
" Reasoning at every step he treads, man yet mistakes his way, whilst
meaner things whom instinct leads, are rarely known to stray."
Hence, at Toy Farm, we have, I think, either a case of discovery
by automatism, or else of accidental coincidence. In the latter con
nection we may note that where water has not been found at one
end of a property it might be natural for a dowser, in the absence of
anything to guide him, to try for it at the other end, where also the
pump at (p) may have suggested it.
Since writing the foregoing I have heard from Mr. David Caplin,
Messrs. Duke and Ockenden's foreman, who writes in reply to
inquiries : —
New Road, Buxteil, Noeember 27th, 1899.
By what I can remember about the well I sunk at Toy Farm, the chalk
down to about 60 ft. was of a very hard yellow nature with a lot of black
flints. Below this for about 10ft. there were places where I should think
water had been passing through at one time. From 70 ft. to about 110 ft.
the chalk was in more of a block, but not so hard. The remainder of the
1 Professor Barrett asks what a geologist would have done under the circum
stances, He would hardly have sunk the old well another SO ft. to the nodular
beds in the //. planus zone, as they are here too doubtfully water-bearing; and,
failing a damp place to drive on, the best plan would have been to drive from the
bottom on the chance of cutting fissures. Water could so have been found, and the
probable quantity and cost computed from similar work in the district, as at the
Brighton Waterworks.

sinking was in a much whiter chalk with black veins in it, and we did not get
any water till within about 2 ft. of the fissure, which I believe is about 6 ft.
from the bottom of the well. There were two fissures coming into the well,
not opposite one another, but one I should think about due west and the
other north-west, and there was no water coming from the east side at all.
This rather favours Tompkins' idea of springs meeting at a point
than mine of a main east and west fissure ; Mr. Pickard, however,
mentions springs from opposite sides. The point could only be settled,
if at all, by examining the well, which I was unable to do at the time
of my visit owing to the obstacles of the pump and staging.
CONCLUSION.
Out of 21 cases of a water-supply obtained by means of a dowser,
which I have now personally examined on the spot, there are, in my
opinion, only three—the three last described —which may be called
evidential of some supernormal faculty. To these may perhaps be
added the partial evidence at Melksham (No. 99) ; and at Warnham
Lodge (No. 58, described Vol. XIII., p. 279), where, though the bed
was known to be water-bearing, the dowser had, I found, succeeded
in predicting a dry place. I have thus met with from three to five
cases, or from 15 to 25 per cent., in which his success could not have
been due to information normally acquired.
In the other cases, while the dowser may have known but a part
of what I describe, I could seldom feel certain what he did or did not
know. From what I have seen of Somersetshire dowsers at work, I
agree with Professor Barrett that they do not seek for information—
neither do they avoid it, and in the general conversation that ensues
when the folks come out to see the water-finding it would be surprising
if something was not said about existing water. Firmly believing in
an external force moving the rod, the dowsers seek for water as one
might seek for iron with a compass, and a group of them over a
particular peg will confirm each other's indications with as much
satisfaction as if " suggestion " had never been heard of. But as
Professor Barrett has shown that the involuntary motion of the rod
is due to unconscious suggestion, of normal or supernormal origin,
—the subconsciousness standing ready to act on the slightest hint—
we must make sure that normal hints have been kept out of our experi
ments before we can use them as arguments for the supernormal. It
seems to me, therefore, that most of the success in dowsing (say three-
fourths) may be attributed to information reaching the dowser in a
normal way, the subconscious synthesis of which determines the
movement of the rod. The evidential fourth may be due to chance
coincidence, or to some yet undiscovered faculty.
xxxviii.] Appendix A. 339
The popular vogue which dowsing has obtained in this country,
and which appears to be increasing, is due to something more than
mere success. The involuntary but visible movement of the twig
inspires the dowser with a confidence in himself, and his employers
with a confidence in him, that no amount of reasoning would. This
confidence in subconscious pronouncements, which is as old as humanity,
implies here a belief in some supernormal relation between the rod and
water. If existing, and involving the dowser's mind, my own opinion
is that it is likely to show itself in the same way as other sub
conscious faculty, i.e., fitfully and occasionally.
It is, I suppose, well within the mark to assume that three-fourths
of most automatisms are subjective, i.e., revivals of memory, or dream
like imagination, and that one-fourth is a liberal estimate for the
supernormal. To suppose, then, that the supernormal element in
dowsing, if such there be, will appear in any larger proportion, seems
to me highly improbable. We may expect it to form a residuum
which will be discovered only when, as in stellar parallax, many
concurrent causes have been eliminated. This is what I have
attempted to do in this report.
Note.
[The foregoing able report by Mr. Westlake shows on the one
hand the value of investigation on the spot by a competent geologist,
and on the other how much easier it is to be wise after an event than
before it. Moreover, with laudable anxiety to avoid any bias in
favour of the dowser, Mr. Westlake has no doubt gone to the opposite
extreme. For he assumes the dowser possessed minute local and
stratigraphical knowledge, had inspected all existing wells, and had
ability to draw inferences from all these data. These assumptions
are not justified. The dowser, usually an ignorant man, is brought
into a district he has probably never seen before, he asks no questions,
but immediately sets to work perambulating the ground with his
forked twig, and the whole business is over in a very short time.
If under similar conditions, and before opening the ground, a field
geologist would tell us whether the dowser's prediction is likely to be
right or wrong, that would be a fairer test of whether the dowser's
success is mainly due to " a sharp eye for the ground," and I hope
this test will be made by any who may have the opportunity. I
agree, however, with the general conclusion arrived at by Mr. West-
lake, but think that probably a larger percentage of the dowser's
success—especially of certain dowsers—is due to some cause at present
unknown to science.—W. F. B.]

APPENDIX B.
NOTE ON THE GEOLOGY OF SOMERSET IN RELATION TO
DOWSING.
By E. Westlake, F.G.S.
The mineralised ridge of the Mendip Hills just above the middle
of the county has been the seat of mineral-dowsing since the time of
Queen Elizabeth. The practice was probably introduced into Corn
wall simultaneously, but has become practically extinct for this
purpose in both localities. In Somersetshire, however, local conditions,
favouring the later application of the rod to water-finding, have pre
served its use to the present day. The Mendip itself consists of
permeable Palaeozoic rocks—Mountain Limestone on a core of old
Red Sandstone—in which the water for the most part sinks to too
great a depth to be reached by wells. It is the Secondary rocks lying
to the north and south—the Trias, Lias, and Oolite—forming what
De Ranee calls a " supra-pervious " series and yielding underground
water, which have determined that Somersetshire and not Cornwall
shall be the centre of water-dowsing.
The two last (Jurassic), which occupy about half the area of the
county, may be described as alternations of clays and limestones, the
sand beds being few and subordinate. The Oolites, especially in
the upper part, consist of clays often of great thickness, alternating
with massive limestones forming reservoirs in which it is compara
tively easy for a geologist to predict water ; although even here,
the limestones being well consolidated, success where quantity is
required may depend upon the accidental striking of a water-bearing
fissure.
In the Lower Lias, which forms most of the low-lying arable land
of the county, clays and limestones alternate every few feet or inches,
and are alike impermeable, as De Ranee indeed terms the whole
formation. When uncovered in the quarries they are seen, however,
to be traversed by cracks and occasional faults, like much-skated-upon
ice, which allow of a slow percolation and the storage of small bodies
of water. 1 There is no record of any copious supply, and the finding
even of a domestic supply depends on a chance meeting with these
water-bearing joints of which there is no sign at the surface. This,
which is the geologist's extremity, is the dowser's opportunity ; or, in
1 Water not only sinks through the Lias, but rises through it, as in the springs of
Bath and Cheltenham.
xxxvm.] Appendix B. 341
other words, it is not surprising that where common-sense ends, the
uncommon-sense attributed to the dowser should be in demand. The
water, it is true, is sometimes impure, the fissured character of the
formation being more favourable to pollution near farms or villages
than to purification. Thus at the town of Somerton the well water
was analysed by the Rivers Pollution Commission and found to be
nearly all dangerously polluted.1
We may note, moreover, that dowsing is not carried on on the
Somersetshire moorlands, which comprise the high-lying impermeable
Devonian areas of Exmoor and the Quantocks drained by surface
streams, and the low-lying alluvial levels debouching on the Bristol
Channel where water lies near the surface. Cornwall also consists of
palaeozoic clay-slate (" killas ") with granite and other igneous rocks,
all of which throw off the water, except the little that percolates in
fissures.
There are two main types of underground water—what may be
termed bed-water, or seepage, filtering through the pores of beds ; a
and fissure-water, or drainage, flowing through their joints. 8 The
first type characterises permeable beds, the second the impermeable.
To the latter condition the consolidation due to ages tends to bring
all the aqueous rocks ; all the igneous are so from the time of cooling :
1 The local dowser, however, an old farmer, ha9 proved equal to the occasion,
and guarantees a pure supply by " andalyzing " the water, as he terms it, by means
of two twigs held simultaneously.
2 There is no English term for this : "interstitial water," or " quarry-water," is
properly the water held in the capillary pores of a rock and not expelled short of dry
ing. The Scotch dialect word, seepage, is, however, used in the United States to
designate the water that soaks through and oozes from the soil, and is so employed
by Mr. King (see under). It has the sense of oozagc, and contrasts with drainage
(water flowing freely in non-capillary channels).
8 The movement of underground water, or ground water as it is called (Germ.
Orundwasser), has just been elaborately treated in two papers by Messrs. F. H.
King and C. S. Slichter, in the 19th Annual Report of the United States Geological
Sureey, 1899, Part II., pp. 59-294, 295-384 ; Washington. The motion of water in the
pores of beds, typically sands and sandstones, is very thoroughly discussed both from
the experimental side and from the mathematical laws of capillarity. The authors
allow, however, that their conclusions are radically modified by the occurrence of
fissures, and that the actual motion of the water is very different from what it would
be in homogeneous beds in which percolation proceeded through the pores
alone. Thus, in the Dakota artesian basin, which consists of Cretaceous sands
and sandstones particularly favourable for the storage and transmission of water, Mr.
King shows that the largest theoretical seepage, or capillary flow, is only one-sixth of
the observed flow (Ibid., p. 249), so that about 80 per cent. must take place through
fissures. In less permeable beds this proportion is probably largely exceeded. Thus,
in a flume of the West Los Angelos Water Company, the observed flow exceeded the
largest capillary computed nearly tenfold {Ibid., p. 255). Mr. Slichter appends a
list of 79 papers on the subject, chiefly in German.
342 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part
such rocks are seen in the Palaeozoic of Cornwall, Wales, the Lake
district, etc. 1
Bed-water is the more usual form, in the sense of being the one
most met with in the populated lowlands. But as we pass from the
looser rocks in the south-eastern counties to the more consolidated in
the west, the proportion of fissure-water increases, till in the moun
tains there is nothing else. Tending to keep in compartments, it is
difficult for a geologist to predict its level, and still more its exact
place or quantity. In these Palaeozoic districts, however, surface
water is usually abundant and good, and the dowser is superfluous ;
and so also in the Tertiary where the rocks hold only bed-water.
His happy hunting ground lies therefore, as we have seen, in the
intermediate conditions of the Secondary rocks, such as exist in
Somersetshire.

1 An illustration from Llanelly is furnished by Mr. J. F. Young, who says in a
letter to Professor Barrett :—" In the Coal Measures exposed in a new dock near here
numerous springs have been intersected, issuing with considerable force through
fissures in the rock, some of which were horizontal whilst others were vertical. In a
new coal pit they are sinking near my residence I noticed the same thing, showing
beyond dispute that underground water in this and similar districts does circulate
through fissures, or follows the dip of the strata, and that intervening portions at
some distance below the surface may be quite dry. "

anterior to the first employment of the rod in the search for under
ground water. The introduction of the virgida diviria, or, as it should
be called, virgulafurcata, into England took place, I have little doubt,
in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, when German miners were brought
over to develop the mineral wealth of Cornwall. They appear to have
brought with them their scldag-ruthe (striking-rod) —our modern
forked divining-rod—-and the phrase " striking " the vein, now extended
to "striking" oil, etc., is probably a survival in modern English of the
term used by these old German miners. The word "dowsing-rod " is,
I venture to think,—with all deference to my philological friends,—
the translation of schlag-rulhe into middle English. (See note to p. 135.)
On p. 343 is a picture (Fig. 21) of these German miners at work
with their virgula furcata. It is taken from the edition published
at Basle in 1546 of the great folio on mining, De re Metallica, by
G. Agricola. Successive scenes are shown in one picture : at A the
dowser is traversing the ground ; at B he has struck ore, which
on digging is subsequently found and pointed out by two overseers.
The cutting of the rod from a willow is seen on the right. The
serious, business-like air of the men holding the rod is evident ; this
is also apparent in another woodcut to be found in an edition of
Sebastian Munster's Cosmography, published in 1 550. These are the
earliest authentic descriptions and representations of the modern
forked divining rod that I have been able to discover.1 Another early
picture of dowsing for minerals (from a rare Italian work on mining)
is given on p. 345 ; a photograph was taken by permission from the
copy in the British Museum.
From Cornwall the use of the rod spread to the lead mines in the
Mendips, and in the 17th century it was widely employed in the
search for ore in that district of Somersetshire. Billingsley, in his
General View of Somerset, published in 1797, gives a lengthy account of
its use and of the esteem in which the rod was held in his time for the
discovery of lead ore. But as the mines became exhausted the
dowsers found employment in the search for underground water. A few
i Chevreul and other writers attribute the earliest description of the rod to the
alchemist who went by the name of Basil Valentine, quoting a passage from his
Letztes Testament, in which the use of the rod (schlag-ruthe) in the search for ore
is described, and erroneously giving a date in the 15th century for that work. The
first edition of Basilius Valentinus. . . His Last Will and Testament was dated
1657, and translated from Fratris B.V. . . Gcheime Bucher oder letzes Testament
(1645). Mr. Westlake tells me that this is abridged from Bergwerckschatz, etc.
(1618), edited in 1600 by Elias Montanus, a physician of Brieg, in Silesia. The
authorship is attributed in a concluding poem to Nicolaus Soleas, but whether
—as an MS. note on the title-page of the copy in the British Museum says—
"genuinus Autor hj libri fuit, " is uncertain. This earlier work describes the
schlag-ruthe and other rods at much greater length.

Somerset dowsers still use the rod in the search for lead and zinc ore,
and it was important to make a strict experimental test of such
dowsers,—under the supervision of a competent geologist,—before
they disappeared altogether. Mr. Westlake, F.G.S., kindly undertook
to do this for me, and the authorities of the Friends' school at Sidcot
generously placed their grounds at our disposal for this purpose. The
following Report gives the result of Mr. Westlake's experiments with
the different dowsers he employed. Some of these, however, were
water, and not mineral dowsers. This should be borne in mind in
reading the Report, for if the detection of surface indications affords
an explanation of the dowser's success, as some maintain, then the
results obtained with dowsers unaccustomed to search for mineral ore
ought not to show greater success than chance coincidence would
account for, whereas the report shows that they do.
EXPERIMENTS IN MINERAL-DOWSING AT SIDCOT.
By E. Westlake, F.G.S.
Dowsing for mineral in the Mendips has been practised, as we know
from various historical notices, for the past 250 years. On visiting, in
the course of an inquiry into water-dowsing in 1899, the mining
villages towards the western end of the hills, I found that mining
operations had ceased some eighteen or twenty years back. I inter
viewed one or two of the old dowsers still living, who had used
their art in former times, but found it was not now possible to obtain
details or verification of the circumstances.
The only course open seemed therefore to be to make fresh trials
with those dowsers who professed themselves able to find mineral.
Several acres of land in the neighbourhood of Winscombe belonging
to a Friends' school, which, while known to be mineralised, had not
been mined, offered a favourable spot for experiment. I accordingly
went over the ground with four dowsers independently, viz.:—
(1) Thomas Day, of Shipham, an old mining dowser, who professes
to be able to find lodes, not necessarily mineralised.
(2) Rowland Pavey, a young miller of Cheddar, who professes to
find underground objects by some secret art ; (had not found mineral).
(3) Thomas Foord, a labourer of Shipham, an inexperienced dowser.
(4) William Kerslake, of Wells, a tailor and professional water-
finder ; (had never searched for minerals before).
Tho localities tried were within a space of 300 yards east and west,
and 100 yards north and south, and comprised :—
(a) An old cricket field west of the school, at a quarry in which
ore had been found some twenty years since by Thomas Day.
(b) Some ground in and adjoining the girls' tennis court.
xxxviii.] Appendix G. 347
(c) A burial ground in which ore had been found in 1866, and a
garden adjoining.
(d) A ploughed field a little to the north.
The soil at these places is mostly thin ; the underlying rock is the
Dolomitic Conglomerate at the base of the Trias, which consists of
pebbles of various Palaeozoic rocks, the whole weathering reddish, and
having a southerly dip of a few degrees. The rock is traversed by
occasional lodes and veins, nearly vertical, running east and west, and
carrying the ores of lead, zinc, iron, and manganese, but they are
here too thin to have been worth mining.
The points indicated by each dowser separately I marked in
such a way as to be imperceptible to those who came after, and
I also so arranged that they did not have an opportunity of
communicating with one another. I went round with each dowser,
but except in a general way I did not know where the previous
marks were, and therefore sources of error from conscious or un
conscious collusion may be considered excluded. With each dowser
the twig turned over a space of a yard or two, corresponding
probably with their ideas of the width of the lodes, and I
marked the central points. Pavey indicated 5 places, Day 28,
Foord 2, and Kerslake 26. The marks are numbered consecutively
1 to 61 on the accompanying plan, and the dowsers who indicated
them are distinguished for brevity by an initial, e.g., P3 = mark No. 3
indicated by Pavey (see plan on p. 350).
At seven places two of the dowsers approximately coincided within
distances varying from 1^ ft. to 8 ft. Two of these, adjoining the
tennis court, I found to be in made ground, and did not open up on
account of the expense. Of the other five I opened, one in the field
and one in the garden showed only solid rock ; in the remaining
three we found a well-defined vein of ore.
At three other single marks I opened up there was no sign of ore,
though at one or two Mr. Clark thought there were signs of a lode.1
In reckoning the dowsers' success their marks should be taken as
extending a yard on either side the centre.
The results are given on the next page in tabular form.
At No. 4, though Kerslake's mark, K 56, was 4 ft. south of the
vein, it was only 2 ft. from the south wall (foot wall) of the lode, and
1 ft. from the buff coloration due to the same, and was hence a practi
cal success. Day's mark 3 ft. further south is neither a success nor
altogether a failure ; it may perhaps reckon as half successful. This
No. 4 pair of marks I had thought before digging to be the most

Winacombe, for the interest be has taken in these experiments.

Subsequently to the above dowsing I was told by Frank Knight
that the grave of William Tanner, who died November 8th, 1866, had
yielded lead ore ; he was watching the meteors of that date from the
school-house roof, and noticed that the grave-diggers stopped blasting,
thinking the end of the world had come, and that graves were
superfluous ; they afterwards sold the ore in Bristol for 25s. The
dowser Day was aware that ore had been found in one of the graves,
and after he had made his marks I asked him to point it out, but he
could not identify it. He might, of course, have retained some latent
memory of its whereabouts ; still as the gravestones are small, uniform
in size, and flat on the ground, and hence neither legible nor
distinctive 12 yds. away, I was interested to find on plotting the
plan that his mark, D 33, was exactly on the straight line, 18 yds.
long, joining the No. 4 vein with W. Tanner's grave.
At this point (No. 5) I opened the ground to verify the lode, and
found it running just north of D 33 towards a point 2 or 3 yds. north
of the grave aforesaid. Clark said it was "very promising lead-bearing
ground," and, on sinking in it to a depth of 4 ft., we struck the vein.
Day's mark was 1 J ft. south of the foot wall, and 3ft. south of the
vein—another success. Kerslake's mark, K 58, was 6 ft. further
south ; so that, taking the two sides of the hedge, each dowser made
one decided success and one doubtful one.
Taking the success of individual dowsers, Day, the miner, was right
in 1\ places out of 5 ( = one half). As he had in former years seen
the ore at the adjoining points, and knew the general run of the lodes,
it may be said that his memory, conscious or subconscious, may have
caused the twig to turn at the right places; and this view is
favoured by the circumstance that in the garden, which was quite shut
off by the hedge from any view of the burial ground, he was 5 ft. off
the lode. Still, in making this criticism, we should bear in mind that
one of the uses—according to Day, the chief use—of dowsing in
practical mining, is to " pick up " the " lode " or " course " of mineral
at no great distance from its working face, and that this he did at
Nos. 9 and 33 with absolute accuracy, and of course without the ore
being in the least visible anywhere. Mr. Knight told me that ore had
also been found at the school at the S.W. corner of the inner court,
near D 27, but I have not reckoned this anything for Day, not know
ing how far he knew the circumstances.
Kerslake, the tailor from Wells, a comparative stranger to the
place, was right in \\ places out of 5 (= one-third nearly); I may
have told him that ore had been found in the burial ground, but
beyond this his success was not derived from local knowledge.
Pavey had a partial success at P 3 where he was 6 ft. off the vein,
but in the two other holes dug on his sole indication there was nothing
350 [part
Professor W. F. Barrett.
Fio. 23.
xxxviii.] Appendix G. 351
whatever, unless we reckon Clark's opinion about P 4. His propor
tion of success was thus one-sixth.
Among general objections which may be taken to these experiments,
which I could only do quickly and extempore, are : (1) that the ground
was known to be mineralised : (2) that the miner Day, having formerly
dowsed over the property, refused to waste time by trying over the
northern or southern portions (he made, however, one N. and S.
traverse of the cricket field without result) ; (3) that to save the time
of the other dowsers and with a view to getting coincidences I took
them over the same ground ; (4) that, by way of encouraging them, I
mentioned to one or other that ore had been found in the quarry or
burial ground, and must therefore assume it known to all. While
such points make it difficult to calculate whether the success exceeds
chance or local knowledge, I am inclined to think that it does.
The probable result of opening the ground at haphazard may be
judged to some extent by the section exposed in the turnpike road,
which lies in a cutting several feet deep for twice the distance shown
on the plan, but shows a lode only at one place opposite the quarry.
It is also practically certain that the discovery of the mineral lodes
did not depend on any surface indications, as both in the cricket field,
garden, and burial ground, there was a layer of turf or vegetable soil
over and completely concealing the lode.
These experiments in their practical success and in the difficulty of
proving more, are in a line with ordinary water-dowsing. They are, I
think, a further illustration of the power of the automatic mind to
gather and utilise information from all sources. What these sources
are can only be settled by more systematic trials, which should if
possible take the form of tracing known objects, the chances of finding
which can be calculated. Such are, e.g., water pipes, gas pipes, electric
wires, and subways carrying water or mineral.1 An old German
mining-book describes the twig as used to find where to sink a shaft
from the surface of the ground to some particular point in the mine.
With known objects all the dowsers' predictions can be checked, which
is impossible where, as in the above experiments, each point has to be
opened up. Opening the ground to find unknown objects is not only
expensive but inconclusive, as the dowser may always maintain that
the object will be found at a greater depth.
E. W.
1 Mr. Pavey is, I understand, prepared to trace underground objects of any kind ;
he has succeeded, I am told by Mr. M. P. Porch. Magdalen, Oxford, in finding
human and mammalian fossils in the Cheddar Caves beyond the result of chance
excavation.

Paramelle.
The story of the Abb6 Paramelle and his extraordinary success as
a water-finder (or hydroscope as he was called) is so little known in
England that it is worthy of more than a passing notice. Paramelle
was born in 1790, and in 1818 was appointed cure and afterwards
Abbé of St. Jean L'Espinasse, moving from there to St. Ceré in the
Department of Lot in the south-west of France. A man of keen obser
vation and scientific spirit, he was struck with the remarkable difference
between the numerous springs, streams, and well-watered area of the
eastern half of the Department and the difficulty with which water
was obtained in the twenty-four arid cantons of the western half.
Here the population were impoverished by having to expend a large
part of their time in laboriously carrying water from distant wells to
supply the wants of their families and their cattle. Prompted, he
tells us, by charitable feelings, he spent two years in the fruitless
search for springs, in the hope that he might be able to supply the
poor folk of the arid region with the benediction of a bountiful water
supply. In this he failed, and got the reputation of searching for the
quantities of buried treasure which the English were supposed to have
left behind when long ago they evacuated that district. He then set to
work to compare the geological characteristics and rainfall in the two
regions ; the arid part was calcareous, but had the same rainfall. The
springs, he rightly conjectured, were only due to the rainfall ; where,
then, did the rainfall go to in the arid region ? It must penetrate
the soil and accumulate, ultimately making its way underground to
the river valleys. Guided by his own observations, Paramelle was
gradually led to put his theories to the test, and found them verified.
He then travelled further afield, and at lost he tells us that after nine
years of exploration and observation he felt sufficient confidence to go to
what we should now call the County Council of the Department of Lot
and ask them to place a certain sum at his disposal to test his theories
by sinking wells in certain places where he predicted water would be
found in the arid communes. The Council acceded, and in 1827
granted him a sum of 600 francs to make experiments, the communes
that were benefited to contribute an equal sum. Eight places were
selected by Paramelle in as many communes, but it was considered at
that time so impossible to find water in these calcareous plateaux that
three communes refused to incur the expense, though five who did
were in each case rewarded by an abundant supply.
xxxvm.] Appendix D. 353
In the proces verbal of the Council of the Department of Lot for
1829 these remarkable successes are recorded. Paramelle, —now the
learned savant, M. l'Abbe' Paramelle,— is called in to explain his
theories, and a further sum of two thousand francs placed at his
disposal and a generous recognition paid to his learning and self-
sacrificing devotion. Two years later the Council record that in
sixteen out of seventeen localities the predictions of Paramelle had
been verified, a perennial water supply being found at the place, depth,
and of the volume he had indicated. His fame becoming known,
applications to find water in waterless districts poured in to such an
extent that with his Bishop's permission he relinquished his ecclesiastic
duties and became what we should now call a hydro-geologist, what
he called a "geognostic," and the public of that day a hydroscope.
Disclaiming the infallibility which was thrust upon him, the local
newspaper accounts of the period, some of which I have read, all
speak of his modesty and marvellous success. Many explain his
secret as a gift of God, others as the work of the devil. The poor
people, however, answered very much in the words of the blind man
cured by our Lord, " Whether he be a sorcerer or a messenger of
God we know not ; this we know, that whereas we were perishing for
want of water, now by his help we have an abundance." By per
mission of the authorities, Paramelle hereafter made a fixed and
modest charge of ten to forty-five francs for his services in each case,
except to the poor, to whom no charge was made (I am afraid this
would not satisfy our English water-finders, whether geologists or
dowsers), and for twenty-one years he spent from sunrise to sunset
every day, except Sundays, for nine months in every year at the work
of water-finding.
In 1843 the proces verbal of the Council General of Lot records
that in their department alone 338 wells had been dug at places
indicated by Paramelle, and, of these, 305, or 90 per cent., yielded an
abundant supply of potable water, in every case found at the depth he
had predicted. In other parts he had also found 683 sources of water
supply ; and when in 1854, at the age of 64, he practically gave up his
active work, the Abbe asserts that in 25 years he had located over
10,000 sources of underground water, and he estimated that between
8 and 9,000 wells had been dug at the sites he had selected. He
endeavoured to find out the percentage of failures he had had, but iu
spite of circulars he sent out, got very few replies; he believes, however,
that his failures were under 5 per cent. of his total trials. Whether
5 per cent. or 10 per cent., as the above official records indicate from his
entire results, his astonishing success is, I venture to think, beyond
anything I have heard modern expert geologists claim. A remarkable
testimony to the value of his work I found in an old number of the
2 c
354 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part
Journal a"Agriculture Pratique for April 1845. The Journal quotes a
letter the Prefect of Lot wrote to the Prefect of Versailles, stating
that up to that time about 6,000 new sources of water supply in 30
departments had been discovered by the Abbé Paramelle, and the
actual money value of the springs thus found was, he says, estimated
at not less than four to five million francs.
In 1846 the Acade'mie of Reims published a report in their
Comptes Rendus from a committee of six of their members appointed
to enquire into Paramelle's theory and work. In this lengthy and
careful report the committee express their high opinion of Paramelle's
character and the results of his work, and quote a number of letters
and certificates from various officials in different parts of France,
testifying to his success. His proportion of failures is estimated as
rather less than 5 'per cent. In almost every instance quoted, the depth
at which water was found was under 50 feet. As to his theory, the
committee report that, though true in a sense, it is imperfect and not
always applicable, nor do they consider that a knowledge of it would
enable another, not possessed of Paramelle's special talents, quick
recognition of all surface indications and long practice, to be equally
successful. Paramelle himself declared, however, that in a few months
of study and three of field practice, he could teach anyone of ordinary
intelligence all that he knew. That might be, but he could not
communicate his almost unerring instinct.1
Paramelle, however, unlike most prophets, seems to have had more
honour in his own country than elsewhere. His success was declared
by outsiders to be impossible, doubt was thrown on the reality or per
manence of the springs he had found, one savant asserts that his
procedure was unscientific and valueless, whilst a writer in one of
the French journals, for 1842, says whatever success he had was due
to impressions, sensations, and convulsions, and, doubtless, diabolic
visions that he experienced. This writer adds: "The only difference
between Paramelle and other sorcerers is that he conceals the diabolic
signs he receives, glossing over his magical proceedings with a lot of
scientific jargon." 2
1 M. Auscher, in his recent handbook of hydro-geology (L'Art de dicov-vrir les
Sources; Paris, 1899), states that the best known of Paramelle's pupils was M. Amy
de Pannessieres, who also wrote upon the discovery of underground water. But I
do not know of his writings nor of any record of his success as a water-finder.
M. Auscher refers repeatedly to Paramelle's work and successes, although his
theory is said to have been found in part defective or erroneous. Some of Paramelle's
occasional failures M. Auscher attributes to his neglect of surface indications,
such as the comparatively rapid melting of snow over underground water, local
mists, the character of the vegetation, etc., but of some at least of these
Paramelle was aware, and it is difficult to know to what extent he did neglect or
rely on them in practice.

xxxviii.] Appendix D. 355
To meet his critics Paramelle determined to publish the methods
which had guided him. He states that in 1827 he had written a
work "on the art of discovering springs." This he revised and
published in 1856 ; three editions were quickly sold, a German trans
lation was made by the Professor of Geology in Freiberg, a Spanish
translation followed, and so highly was the work esteemed that the
Spanish Ministry ordered every municipality to purchase a copy. A
fourth enlarged French edition was published in 1896, after Paramelle's
death. This I have read, and if the earlier ones resemble it, I do not
hesitate to express my amazement at the neglect of this work in
England. The wealth of geological and useful practical knowledge
gained, through field observation, by this French Abbé two generations
ago is astonishing. He must have been an odd mixture, for he
includes in his work a number of laudatory press notices. l From
these, however, we gain a description by eye-witnesses of his method
of procedure ; and these merit some attention. First, there is the
unimpeachable evidence of one of the most distinguished French
savants, M. Geoffroy St. Hilaire, who, in a memoir read before the
Paris Academy of Sciences, in 1836, writes as follows:— "The Abbé
Paramelle's skill in discovering springs rests on the science of observa
tion, and not on the instinctive movement of the divining rod. He
has acquired by practice such acuteness of observation that, after a
single and rapid inspection of the surface of the ground, he can
indicate the place and the depth of any underground sources that may
exist. His success has been so remarkable as to convince the most
incredulous." Nearly every eye-witness says the same thing. A
Journal at Aix says that, " Without any hesitation, and after a rapid
glance, Paramelle at once indicates not only the very spot where to
sink a well, but the depth it will have to be sunk and the volume of
water that will be obtained. All this in so laconic and precise a
fashion that scepticism vanishes." Another journal, Le Rhutenoia,
writes, on February 15th, 1837 :—"The Abbe' Paramelle simply looks
round, says, ' Here you will find the spring at such a depth and of
such quantity ; it comes in this direction, and the water will be of
such and such a quality ' " ; and so on, in upwards of a score of other
Press notices which are included in the chapters XXX. and XXXI.
of Paramelle's work. Similar testimony is borne in the Report of the
1 It is possible that some of these laudatory notices were inserted after Paramelle's
death by the editor of the fourth and last edition, the only edition I have been able
to consult. This contains the preface to the third edition, published in 18G5 ; in this
preface, which Paramelle himself wrote, he states that in spite of some hostile
criticism, none of his statements have been controverted, and after exercising the
greatest care in revision, he has found nothing essential to withdraw. Hence, he adds,
the present (third) edition is merely a reproduction of the earlier ones with some
additional facts and quotations which support the conclusions he had reached.

Commission appointed by the Academy of Reims already referred to,
and in a paper published in 1835 by the French Society Central*
d'Agriculture, LVIP Cahier, p. 326.1
The last chapter of Paramelle's book gives a very interesting
summary of the various methods that had been adopted in ancient and
in modern times (i.e., before the present century) for the purpose of
discovering underground water ; to this part of our subject we may
return later.
What then was the secret of Paramelle's method ? This he has
disclosed, or professed to disclose, in his book, L'Arl de De'couvrir Its
Sources. He did not use any form of divining-rod ; he tells us the
rod would never turn in his hands, though he had often tried it, and
he regarded the users of the baguette with undisguised contempt.
The hypothesis upon which he worked, to state it in the most
general form, was that underground water behaves precisely like
water that is visible on the surface of the earth. Just as in the latter
case waters that are precipitated upon the surface of the earth and
fail to penetrate the superficial soil, gather into rivulets and join
streams and rivers, following in their course certain suitable channels,
so must underground waters behave. Thus the waters which percolate
through the upper earth, on reaching a bed of impermeable rock or
clay, will form into little filaments of water, these will unite into
rivulets, which again will join larger subterranean water courses, and
so on until they finally reach the surface or possibly emerge in the bed
of a river or lake. Throughout their course they will follow hollows,
depressions or folds in the impermeable stratum analogous to those
in which surface waters flow. The position of these underground
channels, our author asserts, can be determined by observation of
the surface. This branch of his subject Paramelle explains with
much detail, but it will be sufficient here to give a bare outline of
his views.
Subject to certain exceptions, it may be said that he held the
conformation of the surface to correspond in some important features
with that of an impermeable stratum beneath it. A valley or longi
tudinal depression, whether large or small, marks, he says, the position
of an underground stream. In broad valley bottoms the principal
watercourse will usually be found on the line of intersection of the
sides. Subsidiary gullies or hollows indicate the affluents. In a fairly
level country, where the depressions can be only slightly marked, he
describes how it is still possible with minute precautions and by close
observation to detect them.
1 For these and other rare papers relating to Paramelle I am indebted to
M. Holland, of 2, Rue des Chantiers, Paris, whoso excellent book agency I have
previously had to thank.
xxxviii.] Appendix D. 357
The existence of such outward signs of hidden streams of water
Paramelle attributes to the natural tendency of the surface to conform
to its supporting bed, and also to subsidence due to the constant
carrying away of matter by the underground current.
The quantity of water likely to be found at a selected point he
estimated from the area drained. The quality of the water he inferred
from the nature of the soil through which it had filtered, and the
depth at which it ran mainly from ordinary geologic data.
Paramelle did not claim that his method was applicable to the
discovery of sheets of underground water or water-logged strata of
wide area, or, one may suppose, to water at a great depth. The
former case, however, he believed to be of very rare occurrence, and
to others, for which his general plan would be unsuitable, he refers
candidly, and suggests several ingenious considerations.1
It may be inferred, from the foregoing brief sketch of Paramelle's
views, as well as from the contemporary notices of his work, that his
success lay in the discovery of shallow, or what are sometimes called
surface, wells, that is, wells from 10 to 30 or 40 feet deep, and his
observations are evidently based on the superficial beds which lie on
the older rocks. As Mr. T. V. Holmes, F.G.S., has pointed out in the
interesting letter I have already published,2 " This perception of
water-bearing surface beds is quite independent of a knowledge of
geological structure. Indeed the rise of geology as a science tended to
put this older knowledge of water-bearing surface beds into the back
ground. The Geological Survey had been at work man)' years at the
deep-seated geology of England and Wales, before any ' drift-maps,'
or those showing these superficial beds, were even thought of. .
1 Mr. B. St. G. Lefroy, to whom I am indebted for kindly making, at my
request, the foregoing concise summary of Paramelle's working hypothesis, writes to
me as follows:—"Paramelle's theory can hardly have been developed, ex post facto,
to disarm the popular superstition which his abnormal success created, for in 1 829 a
local French journal (quoted on p. 382 of Paramelle's work) states that his success
was based on geological theories he had arrived at, and the local newspaper reports
emphasise the fact that he viewed the land, in some cases not going on it at all.
"The impression which he makes on me is that, granting his premises, his
conclusions are drawn with admirable common-sense and candour ; and that even if
he be a scientific heretic, twenty-five years of observation, a naturally good eye for
ground and some modicum of truth in his conjectures, might well account for his
successes without invoking any supernormal faculties.
"The gist of the difference between Paramelle and orthodox geologists, I venture
(with the deference of conscious ignorance) to submit lies in the question :—Is a
water-bearing stratum a sponge or a filter"! (I mean principally. Of course it must be
both to some extent). If the latter, would not his view be correct—ex necessitate rei f
(Water would percolate by gravity into depressions). Another way of contrasting
Paramelle and hydro-geologists might be to say that the former fixed his mind on the
impermeable stratum while the attention of the latter is mainly directed (I think) to
the presence or absence of a water-soaked bed above it.
sProcecdiiw S.P.R., Vol. XIII., p. 222.
358 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part
But geologists seldom bestow much thought on these various drift-beds
unless interested in flint implements." Perhaps I may here add paren
thetically my earnest hope that good "drift-maps" of the whole of
the British Isles will soon be published by the Geological Survey. The
need for and practical value of such maps has been most strongly
impressed upon me during these investigations. Both Mr. Kilroe and
Mr. Holmes have pointed out to me how misleading the ordinary
maps may be to a person who wishes to obtain a moderate water
supply by sinking a well.
I am not in the least competent to give any opinion upon Para-
melle's theories. They may excite a smile among geologists of the
present day, or they may awaken interest or arouse criticism. In any
case, his phenomenal success in the location of underground water
needs explanation, even assuming that he did not discover the more
abundant sources found in deep wells. For my own part, I believe
that the experience he had gained by long observation in the field,
and the instinct he had thus acquired, accounted for a good deal more
than he could rationally explain. Hence, like the successful dowser
of past and present times, it was his sub-conscious far more than his
conscious life that was concerned in the process of water-finding. That
no mere knowledge of the theories he sets forth in his book will enable
any one to become a second Paramelle is obvious from the fact that,
although his book has been widely read on the Continent during the
last seventy years, no such renown has been subsequently gained by
any Continental water-finder, nor, I believe, by hydro-geologists any
where, as attached to this simple-minded French Abb&

Evidence of Clairvoyance in Dowsers.
It is obvious that if a good dowser has any power whatever of
subconscious supersensory perception, surface indications of the object
sought for will have very little to do with his success, and he
ought to be able to tell the position of a hidden coin or any buried
object as well as that of underground water and mineral lodes. Now
it is well known that the majority of dowsers from the earliest times
have always asserted that they could do this ; in fact, the first use of
the divining rod was for the purpose of discovering buried treasure.1
It would take me too far aside from my present purpose if I entered
into the history of this part of my subject and the evidence that
exists on its behalf ; this I propose to do in another paper. It is
sufficient to say that I have collected a large amount of evidence
which shows,—in spite of my strong previous belief to the contrary,—
that the success of the dowser in finding concealed objects is greater
than seems possible to account for by chance coincidence. Indications
may in some cases have been unconsciously afforded by those present
who knew where the object was hidden, but, allowing for this and
other sources of error, there appears to be in these experiments a
degree of success with certain good dowsers like the late John
Mullins that points to the existence of some faculty analogous to
clairvoyance.- With several amateur dowsers there is similar evidence.
Mr. Tosswill, of Budleigh Salterton (see p. 223), made in the presence
of two witnesses a series of successful experiments in finding con
cealed coins, every care being taken to avoid unconscious indications
1 There is an amusing account in the life of William Lilly, the astrologer, of how
he accompanied Davy Ramsey, "his Majesty's clockniaker," in the year 1834, to
search for buried treasure by means of the divining rod iu the cloisters of West
minster Abbey, the Dean having given permission, and how the demons raised a
storm and drove them away. One of the epigrams of Sheppard, published in 1651,
satirises this use of the rod ; but Continental and, to a less extent, English, literature
of that and an earlier period, contains frequent reference to the use of the rod for
finding buried treasure. Even so recently as September 28th, 1882, the Paris corre
spondent of the London Times relates how the Government Director of Fine Arts
in Paris had that week ordered, in his official capacity, a search for treasure (sup
posed to have been buried a century previously), to be made by means of the divining
rod. The search was, however, fruitless. A leading article on the subject appeared
in the Times for October 6th, 1882.

being given by the witnesses. I have specially to thank Mr. Tosswill
for his kindness in assisting this inquiry, and taking a railway journey
of four hours solely for the purpose of enabling these tests to be made.
Mr. Young, of Llanelly (see p. 221) has made similar experiments
in the presence of a previously sceptical witness. Mr. Jerman,
F.R.I B.A., a well-known architect in Exeter, who is an amateur
dowser, found he also was successful on making an attempt at finding
a carefully concealed coin, though one such experiment is of little
value. Enough evidence, however, exists to make it worth while
for those who find they have the power of motor automatism
to pursue somewhat similar experiments, and I hope this will
be done.
I regret that I have not made more experiments of this kind myself
with different dowsers. The fact is, I was for a long time entirely
sceptical of the statements made, and my own experience confirmed
this scepticism. For early in this inquiry I made some experiments
with a dowser, Mr. Stears, on concealed masses of metal, which were
unsuccessful ; these are related in the previous Report, p. 176.
Again, Colonel Taylor made, at my request, a careful experiment
at Cheltenham with the dowser, Mr. Tompkins, on concealed coins ;
these also were unsuccessful. And yet both these dowsers seem
to have had singular success in this very direction on other occasions
with different experimenters. It is natural to assume such success
was due to careless experiment. Perhaps so. On the other hand, we
do not require to assume —we know—how very fitful are the psychical
conditions which ensure success in any experiments connected with
the sub-conscious state, such, e.g., as telepathy. Hence it would
be an error to attach as much importance to the failure of a
particularly psychical test experiment as we should to the failure
of a corresponding physical experiment the conditions of which
are known.1
Recently I have, however, had a certain amount of success in
a more severe test to which I submitted this hypothesis of "clair
voyance." In my correspondence and interview with Mr. J. F. Young,
of Llanelly, who is a member of our Society —and to whom I have
frequently referred as a successful amateur dowser—I found that he
had occasionally with success tried automatic writing. I therefore
asked him to try if a pencil held in his hand would write certain
1 In his admirable address to Section A of the British Association last year,
Professor Poynting, F.R.S., pointed out how essentially different are the results to be
expected from experiments with living compared with non-living matter. He
remarks: "Taking the psychical view, in the living being there is always some
individuality, something different from any other living being, and full prediction in
the physical sense, and by physical methods, is impossible."

words or numbers I would enclose in a sealed envelope : he agreed.
"Whereupon I printed some words of three letters, placed them
between a fold of thick paper, and enclosed each in an opaque
envelope which was sealed with my own seal as well as otherwise
securely fastened. Three such envelopes I posted to Mr. Young at
Llanelly, and asked him to try if by automatic writing or by the rod
he could ascertain what words of three letters I had written. In
reply he said :—
On receiving your letter I gave the envelopes to my sister-in-law, who took
charge of them till I was ready to make the experiment. When at leisure
in the evening she gave me one of the envelopes marked (3), which I placed
inside my cap, and put cap and envelope on the top of my bald head. I
sat at a table, as usual, with a pencil in my hand, and made up my mind as
blank as possible, patiently waiting till my hand appeared controlled to
write without any volition on my part. After waiting for a little while my
hand suddenly scribbled out, on an old postcard which was lying near, the
enclosed, which looks like O N W, or else the last letter is E, ONE. I send
the postcard to you with the scribble on it. Will you please say what the
word is ? I return the envelope.
I found the experiment very tiring, as if some vital force were ex
hausted, and will try the other envelopes another time.
J. F. Young.
P.S.—Before posting this letter, I made a second experiment with
another of your envelopes, the one marked (2). First I tried with the
rod in my hands, my sister slowly repeated the alphabet aloud ; this she did
three or four times. After the first repetition the rod moved at the letters
A, B and C and no others. I then tried automatic writing with my eyes
shut ; the enclosed came, starting from the x —it looks like A. B. On
a second attempt the same letters came somewhat clearer.
On receiving the envelopes from Mr. Young I examined them
carefully ; they had not been tampered with in any way. On opening
No. 3, I found the word ONE, and in No. 2 the word CAB. Here is

the hope that a more extended series of trials may yield result* of no
slight value.1
I begged Mr. Young to try the third envelope and let me know
the result. He promised to do so, but unfortunately serious illness
and death invaded his family, and after his own recovery he has not
yet felt disposed to go on with the experiments. Prior to his experi
ment with my envelopes, he gave me the result of some experiments
of a similar kind I had asked him to make in his own way. I have
entire confidence in Mr. Young's integrity, but the results which I
will give must be taken for what they are worth. Mr. Young writes
on January 5th, 1 900 :—
I made a few trials this evening. I cut some squares of paper all alike,
put a number of one figure on each, then turned the square upside down,
1 I should be very glad if any of my readers, who find that a forked twig held
between their hands automatically moves when they pass over certain spots, would
make some experiments to ascertain if they possess an incipient clairvoyant
faculty. Let them, for example, take two packs of cards, spread out one pack (or
one suit from the pack), on the table, faces up, draw from the other pack (or cor
responding suit) a card, face down, and place it, unseen, say beneath the waist
coat; this humours the idea (p. 366) that the epigastrium is the most sensitive
seat of this occult vision. Then walk slowly round the table on which the cards
are disposed, note if the twig moves over any particular card, and compare the
result with the concealed card. Or they might try the eimpler card game which
Mr. A. Lang has described in Longman's Magazine, Vol. XXXI., p. 279: viz., take
up a card from the top of a shuffled pack and, without looking at it, try if some
vision of a card floats into the mind ; then compare the result with the actual card
held. Mr. Lang finds he is generally successful in this game on the first two or
throe trials, but afterwards his guess becomes mixed or hopelessly wrong : this I
have also noted in thought-transference experiments. I should be grateful for any
record that may be sent to me (addressed Kingstown, co. Dublin) of such experi
ments, or of any similar ones that may suggest themselves to my readers.
xxxvm.] Appendix E. 363
shuffled them about in every way, and then picked up one of the squares
with my eyes closed, put it on the top of my head and placed my cap on, it
fitting close to the crown of my head. Then I made myself as passive
as possible, and either slowly repeated the figures till a certain one seemed
to be right, or the impression of a particular figure came as soon as I
put the cap on my head; when it came thus quickly, it was invariably right.
This is the result, and the order in which I took up the figures, of course
one at a time, x denotes a wrong guess :—
Figure on square ... S|4|7|5|S|2|9|3|6|1|
Figure guessed ... x|4|7|6|x|2|9|x|6|l|
The experiment was very exhausting, so that I could not go on any
longer.
It is curious that the figure 3 should both times be wrong. Mr.
Young also tells me he was successful three times out of four with a
similar experiment, only using a rod in his hands and repeating the
figures to himself.
Previous to making these experiments, Mr. Young had written to
me as follows :—
In the year 1893 I had a remarkable experience when out water-finding
with the rod. (It happened to be very dry weather at the time. Whether
this had anything to say to it I don't know, but this peculiar experience
ceased when rain set in.) I found that after " setting " myself to use the
rod, i.e., getting into an abstracted mental condition, lost to all around,
when, or just before, the rod turned, I could, —as it were clairvoyantly,
—see the underground springs and actually appeared able to trace them out
as I walked along. My friend Mr. Robertson, who, as you are aware, also
uses the rod with success as an amateur water-tinder, tells me he alao had a
similar experience,1 and we have since read that a "diviner " named Adams,
a Somerset man, frequently asserted the same thing.
All this may, of course, be a mere illusion, but that it is occasion
ally a veridical illusion seems to he indicated not only from the
subsequent test experiments which I have narrated, but also from the
fact that in the case of others who have had a similar experience,
water has been found beneath the spot, though previously searched
for in vain in the immediate neighbourhood.
Here, for example, is such a case. In the English edition of
Reichenbach's researches on his so-called Od force, Dr. Ashburner
devotes a lengthy note on pp. 90-106 to the divining rod, and gives a
remarkable instance of a girl who when mesmerised appeared to be an
excellent dowser ; when entranced, if the hazel twig moved in her
hands, she exclaimed she saw the water a few feet beneath the surface,
and gave a vivid description of it. Dr. Ashburner quotes in full the
1 Mr. Robertson is joint author with Mr. Young of a little book on the divining
rod, in which they narrate their experience and give a good deal of miscellaneous
information.—W. F. B>

letter he had received from a lady, a friend of his, giving a minute
account of this experiment, which was made in a field adjoining the
lady's house in Hertfordshire. At the spot where the rod turned and
the girl declared she saw the water, a well was dug, and an abundant
supply of good water was found a few feet below the surface., though
previously the lady states that they had " very bad water and had
long been unable to find a good spring."1
I hope that some tests may be made in England or in the Conti
nental schools of hypnotism on the possible dowsing faculty of patients
under hypnosis. Of the occasional " lucidity " or "clairvoyance " of
subjects in the deeper hypnotic trance I have received some striking
evidence, and have personally verified the fact in one very sensitive
subject whom I had hypnotised. -
Though of very slight evidential value, it may be worth referring
to the curious old case of Parangue, narrated by Figuier in Chapter
VIII. of his excellent treatise on the Baguette Divinatoire. Parangue
was born near Marseilles in 1760, and when quite a child appeared
able to discern clairvoyantly the presence of underground water, and
was successfully employed at several places for this purpose. Figuier
is naturally somewhat sceptical about this case, for the particulars of
1 This took place more than 50 years ago, and it seem,d hopeless to obtain any
confirmation of this case, as no names were given by Dr. Ashburner; but, curiously
enough, a letter was sent me from a lady living at Waterford, who, wriiing to a
friend apropos of my previous Repor', gave an account of a visit she paid in 1847 to
her aunt in Hertfordshire, Miss B., and narrates the very circumstance described by
Dr. Ashburner as happening in her aunt's field before her visit. The writer confirms
several of Dr. Ashburner's statements, that the girl dowser was Miss B.'s lady's
maid, and also that Miss B. (who narrated the facts to Dr. Ashburner) was an
exceptionally clever and intelligent lady, not likely to be mistaken, and that there
had previously been great difficulty in getting good drinking water, but the spring
found by the blindfolded [this is probably a slip of memory] girl was still used in the
house. Reference is made to Miss B.'s deep interest in mesmerism, but not to any
mesmerising or clairvoyance of the girl. Miss B. probably would not speak of this
to her young niece. My correspondent was unaware that Dr. Ashburner had
written anything on the subject.
• On a future occasion I propose to publish the details of a remarkable case of
this kind sent to me sume years ago by a competent observer, the rector of a large
parish in Cumberland, who was also Chairman of the local Bench of Magistrates.
The subject in this case was a lady, a sufferer from chronic illness, who had
greatly benefited by hypnotic treatment carried out by my informant under the
direction of her medical attendant. In the course of time she developed what
appeared to be a clairvoyant faculty, and the particular test experiment to which
she was submitted, —and which I carefully investigated and verified (so far as it
was possible) at the time,—convinced me, as it had already convinced my in
formant and others, that sooner or later science will haee to admit the existence,
in certain cases, of a supersensory perceptive power. In this instance any ex
planation based on fraud, or hyperesthesia of vision, or chance coincidence, or
thought-transference was more inconceivable than the admission of some faculty
new to science. *

which he quotes the Abbe Sauri, who firmly believed in Parangue,
and who states that the child was thrown into a paroxysm whenever
it was brought over a hidden underground spring.1
Whatever value is to be attached to such narratives as the fore
going, there undoubtedly exists a body of testimony from many able
and distinguished men, in different countries and in different pro
fessions, who have become convinced by personal investigation that
certain persons can detect the presence of hidden objects in some
transcendental manner. I have already referred on p. 247 to the
opinion expressed by Zschokke. He was a man of great erudition
and versatility, possessed of a wide knowledge of men and affairs,
holding a high position as member of the Great Council of State,
Lieut. -Governor of Basle, and historian of Switzerland. He is there
fore an excellent witness. In his Autobiography, first published in
1842, he states:—
In almost every canton of Switzerland are found persons endowed with
the mysterious natural gift of discovering, by a peculiar sensation, the
existence of subterranean waters, metals, or fossils. I have known many
of them, and often put their marvellous talent to the proof. One of them
was the Abbot of the Convent of St. Urban, in the canton of Lucerne,
a man of learning and science ; and another a young woman, who excelled
all I have ever known. I carried her and her companion with me through
several districts entirely unknown to her, but with the geological formation
of which and with the position of its salt and sweet waters I was quite
familiar, and I never found her deceived. To detail circumstantially every
experiment I made to satisfy myself on this point would take up too much
space at present, but the results of the most careful observation have
compelled me at length to renounce the obstinate suspicion and incredulity
I at first felt on this subject, and have presented me with a new phase of
nature, although one still involved in enigmatical obscurity.
The evidence on behalf of clairvoyance is really more extensive
and of greater weight than is commonly known, and those who contest
this evidence will find themselves impaled on the horns of a dilemma ;
they must either admit thought-transference and stretch that explana
tion to an absurd length, or they must admit the fact of clairvoyance,
—meaning by this latter the transcendental perception by certain
individuals of an object or writing which cannot be seen by, and is
unknown to, those present. It is to be noted that cases of clair
voyance with persons not in the mesmeric sleep usually occur with
1 In an article on Modern Maijie by M. Shele de Vere, published in 1873, it is
stated that "Catherine Beutler, of Thurgovia, Switzerland, and also Anna Maria
Briegger, of the same place, were both so seriously affected by the presence of water
that they fell into violent nervous excitement when they happened to cross places
beneath which large quantities of water were concealed, and became perfectly
exhausted." Long ago, a Portuguese lady, one Pedegacha, is also stated to have been
similarly affected by underground springs.
366 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part
sufferers from catalepsy or some allied disorder.1 The sense of vision
in these cases (and also in some hypnotised subjects) appears to be
transferred to the epigastrium ; the subject pressing the card or
writing to the pit of the stomach in order " to see it," as if the
viscera were the seat of vision. Now it is worthy of note that this
inquiry has led us to the conclusion that some dowsers also possess, in
greater or less degree, a subconscious clairvoyant faculty, and that
such persons exhibit symptoms of induced catalepsy and experience
singular sensations in the epigastrium when the object sought for is
transcendentally "perceived" by them. I have already pointed out
in Part XII. that the visceral sensations of the dowser are probably
emotional disturbances, arising from a psychical state, and it is likely
enough that a similar explanation accounts for the cataleptic subject
believing he sees with his stomach, the sensation being there. But
this explanation merely accounts for the secondary effects observed ;
the induction of the psychical state still remains a mystery. And
here it seems to me that a wholly independent and different investi
gation should ultimately lead to conclusions so similar to those arrived
at by other investigators nearly a century ago can hardly be a mere
accident. A cause common to both, to be found in some perceptive
power new to science, appears primd facie to be indicated.

The Zahoris.
In a footnote on p. 5 of my previous paper on the Divining Rod
{Proceedings S.P.R., Part XXXII.), I quoted a writer in the Quarterly
Review for 1822, p. 373, who states that "the faculty of using the
divining rod is evidently the same as that possessed by the Spanish
Zahoris, though the latter do not employ a hazel twig." The Spectator,
in an nrticle on the Divining Rod on October Hth, 1882, also refers
to the Zahoris in the same casual way, as if every one knew all about
them. On inquiry I could find no one who could give me any
information beyond a reference to the meaning of the word as given in
Spanish dictionaries. Thus, in Lopes' Spanish Dictionary the word
" Zahori " is explained as follows :—" A vulgar impostor pretending to
see things, although hidden in the bowels of the earth, if not covered
with blue cloth." Again, " Zahoria " is said to be "The art of seeing
as above. The performer must be born on Good Friday." Newnan
and Barretti, in their Spanish dictionary, use identically the same
words, and the Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy has a
similar description, ending, "Lynceus homo subterranea videns."
The word " Zahori " is really from the Arabic, meaning " clear,"
" enlightened " ; it was, in fact, equivalent to the term a " clairvoyant,"
as that word is now used. The same root occurs in Hebrew, and
is the origin of the title " Zohar," the famous bible of the Kabbalists.1
It seemed, therefore, to be a matter of historical interest to
ascertain what was known concerning these Zahoris. The earliest
account I have been able to find of the Zahoris comes to us from
Mexico in the year 1557. It is contained in a folio volume in the
British Museum, entitled Phisica Specufatio, etc., Mexici, 1557?
written by one Alphonsus {Gutierrez) a Vera Cruce. This work was
reprinted in Salamanca in 1559. In his discourse on the Soul,—
1 The Zohar is a mystical commentary on the Pentateuch, the title being sug
gested by the command in Gen. i , 4, "Let there be light," with the exposition
of which the work begins ; it was compiled between the 3rd and 13th centuries. The
" Zoharites " were an ephemeral Jewish sect of theosophJBts, swearing by the Zohar ;
founded about 1750 they had, of course, nothing to do with the Zahoris of two
centuries before.
5 I have to thank Mr. E. Westlake, —who has devoted unwearied patience to the
compilation of a complete bibliography of the divining rod,—for the discovery of this
rare volume in the British Museum. It must have been one of the earliest books
ever printed in Mexico. To Miss E. Stokes my best thanks are also due for the
excellent translation of this and other passages in the British Museum.
368 Professor W. F. Barrett. [pakt
De Anima, lib. ii., speculatio ii., pp. 300-301 (or pp. 376-377 of the
Salamanca edition), Alphonsus writes as follows :—
Specidatiwi II. of Enchanters, Salntators,1 and of the People vulgady
called Zalwris.
There is no one who denies that there may be such an arrangement
in a man's eyes, that he may be enabled to see at a great distance to
which another man's eyes cannot reach. In the same way there may be
such an arrangement as to enable a man to see an object through some
diaphanous medium, whilst other eyes are incapable of discerning the
shape of the object through the same medium. But I cannot conceive that
any one's sight can be so constructed that he can see an object behind a
wall or any opaque substance ; for sight is the effect either of outward
transmission, [i.e. from the eyes] as some maintain, or of inward reception,
as the majority declare. It is not clear how the shape of anything can reach
the eye, when it is hidden in the earth, and behind something opaque and
not diaphanous ; for how would it pierce through the earth or penetrate
the stone? For such shape would necessarily be absorbed on coming in
contact with an opaque body, and could not find transit, because it is not a
diaphanous body. Wherefore such shape could not reach the eye, neither
could the object itself be seen. And I do not see how they [the Zahoris] can
perceive (as they say) abscesses or humours in the internal organs of a man,
(their sight not being impeded by the body or clothes) ; nevertheless they
themselves assert that they can, and in the same way, on entering a temple
where dead bodies lie, that they can clearly perceive the internal organs of
the corpses, if they cast their eyes down. Nevertheless I do not give full
credence to their assertions. For these things may be illusions wrought of
the devil. Nevertheless I do not condemn them ; for I have known men
otherwise upright, who have declared they see these things. I confess I do
not know what cause can produce such natural power ; for it is not the same
as that alleged by enchanters and salutators ; but is quite different, for
the Zahoris say the object is made visible by natural means, by radiating
its shape to the eye ; if so, it is necessary that the medium through which it
passes should be diaphanous ; otherwise the shape does not become visible.
All philosophers say that air and water are diaphanous mediums, and all
things that partake of their nature ; but the earth and opaque bodies are not
of that kind.
A few years later a famous Jesuit of Louvain, Martin Delrio,
published his great work Disquisitionum Magicarum in three folio
volumes. I came across a copy of this work, published in 1599, in the
famous library founded by Archbishop Marsh in Dublin.2 In the
first volume, ch. iii., pp. 11 and 12, of this work, Delrio refers to
1 The word talutator means in low Latin a '- pointer out." The index finger was
called digitus ealutatorius, not only from its being used for familiar salutation, but
also for pointing out.—W. F. B.
4 Mr. Elworthy, in his treatise on "The Evil Eye," refers to Delrio's work as
published in 1603. This must be a later edition. My own slight literary researches in
connection with the history of the Virgula Divina have impressed me with the
enormous labour and erudition displayed in Mr. Elwortby's classical work.

the Zahoris (he calls them Zahuris), and the following translation
gives the principal statements he makes : —
A race of men in Spain are known who are called Zahuris; we may
name them Lynxes ; when I was staying at Madrid in the year 1575, such a
boy was to be seen there. They relate that these people see things that are
hidden in the inward bowels of the earth, veins of water and treasures of
metals, and corpses placed within sarcophagi. This thing is most fully received
and well known. Not only Pindar, Tzetzes, and other poets have thought
this possible, but philosophers also (e.g., Coel. Rhodig., lib. 16), some of
whom ascribe this power to a melancholy humour.1 ... I think they
know veins of water by the vapours exhaled from those places morning and
evening. They know veins of metal from the grass, of whatever kind, that
usually grows there. Treasures and corpses I would consider to be indicated
by demons. . . . They are accustomed to restrict this faculty of seeing
to certain days, the third and sixth day of the week, which is a token
of a secret pact. Besides, the redness of the eyes, which is particularly
to be observed in Zahuris, would rather injure than assist clearness
of sight.
It is interesting to note the prevalent idea of that period, and
long afterwards, that demons have the principal hand in the discovery
of hidden treasure, otherwise Delrio's conjectures indicate shrewd
observation on his part. The "redness of the eyes" is a curious trait.
Another reference to the Zahoris is to be found in a work
published in 1643 by Juan Eusebio Nieremberg, entitled Curiosa
y Oculta Filosophia, 3rd edition; Madrid, 1643. (Reprinted in
Barcelona, 1645, see pp. 81-82.) Chapter LXXVI. of this work is
devoted to the power of the Zahoris, and the following is a trans
lation of the chief portion (pp. 284-285) :—
Less is heard of the sight of the modern Zahoris, though it cannot be
taken as certain. Celio Rodiginio favours their cause, judging that there
may be a natural means of seeing through large, opaque bodies. Another
attributes what they say they see to the effect of a melancholy humour.
This would be a good explanation if facts did not follow their imagination or
sight ; but springs are found where they point them out, metal where they
say they see it, and the dead with all their marks which they perceive, so
that it must be attributed to some other cause than melancholy.
But knowledge of where water is to be found underground may be
acquired without much difficulty, without its being necessary for the sight
to pierce the earth. It was the ancient office of the Aquilegos,° whose art
was the knowledge of where water was to be found, at what depth, and of
what quality it was. Marcellus wrote of these things among the Romans,
and is quoted by Cassiodorus. In the time of the king Theodoric a
1 Melancholy here means madness; as Milton says, "Moonstruck melancholy,
moping madness."—W.F.B.
' Aquilegus (in Latin) was one skilled in seeking out water ; see Facciolati's
Latin Dictionary.—W. F. B.
2 I)
370 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part
very celebrated Aquilegus came from Africa, whom Theodoric affectionately
recommended to Apronianus that he might give him a suitable salary. The
mode of discovering the water was by the presence of certain herbs, briars,
reeds, and other green trees, by certain species of mosquitoes, and light
vapours which arose from the spot, and by other means which they took,
such as placing dry wool in certain parts at night, well covered, to see if
it would be found damp. Sweet and salutary waters are qualified by the
south and east wind, and the heavy and less salutary fall with the north and
west wind. The same thing may be urged concerning the knowledge of
mmes of metal, for there may be in the same way natural signs of them, and
certain herbs which signify their presence.
As to the assertion that the Zahoris can see the buried dead and
certain particular marks upon them, Alphonso de Vera-cruz, in the second
book of his Anima, and Father Delrio, on the Medea of Seneca and in
the first book of his l&ag'ui, attribute this to evil arts ; and I can see no
grounds for opposing them, the more so that the power of the Zahoris is
limited to certain days, such as Tuesdays and Fridays, which to me is a
suspicious circumstance ; also the redness and inflammation of the eyes
usually found among these people seems to prove that they rather blind
their sight than sharpen it.
The most interesting part in this quotation is Nieremberg's refe
rence to an ancient cult of water-finders, or " aquilegos," as he calls
them. In the State papers and letters of Cassiodorus, which form
our chief knowledge of Theodoric, king of the Ostrogoths (circa a.d.
454-526), whose chief minister Cassiodorus was, the reference to the
aquilegus will be found in Epist. LIIL, lib. 3, p. 58. The famous
Jesuit, Father Kircher, in his Mund. Sub. lib. 5, p. 266, also refers
to the method employed by the aquilex (as he terms it) in water-
finding.
Another Spanish writer, Feyjoo, in his Theatro Crilico Universal,
Madrid, 1732, tome III., pp. 101-118, published a paper entitled
Vara Dioinaturia, y Zahories.1 This paper is principally concerned
with the discussion of the well known case of Jacques Aymar, whose
story was then attracting universal attention. In section VII. the
Zahories are referred to, and the author treats them with scepticism,
remarking that the multitude is generally credulous, and among all
people men of critical faculty and sound judgment are few. He
continues :—
The name Zahoris is applied to a class of men of whom it is said that
their vision penetrates opaque bodies, thus causing to appear whatsoever
may be hiddon away fathoms deep below the surface of the earth. Perhaps
1 My friend and colleague, Professor J. P. O'Reilly, Foreign Secretary to the
Royal Irish Academy, most kindly translated the whole of this lengthy Spanish
paper tor me, and I wish here to express my great indebtedness to my learned friend
for this and other laborious translations he has cheerfully made for the purpose of my
inquiry.

we have inherited thetu from the Moors, since the word Znhori seems
Arabic.1
It cannot bo advanced that this virtue is either natural or supernatural ;
consequently it must be condemned as either feigned or as superstitious. It
is not natural, since light does not penetrate into the depth of opaque bodies.
In consideration of this we have declared (in the 2nd Vol., Second Discourse)
as fabulous what is pretended of the penetrating vision of the lynx, and at
present we will include under the same rule that son of Aphareus, King of
the Messenians, to whom many ancient authors attribute the same excellence
of sight as that ascribed to the lynx, giving him in consequence the title of
" Lynx-eyed " (Linceo), because, said they, he could see through the trunks
of trees and rocks, a falsehood which Apollonius, in his poem of the
Argonauts, immensely exaggerates, pretending that he fathomed with his
vision the depths of the earth, even to being able to see what was taking
place in Hell. Nor do I think that more credit should be accorded to what
Varro, Valerius Maximus, and other writers tell of that man called Strabo,
who iu the first Punic war saw from the promontory of Lilyboeum, in Sicily,
and counted the vessels which were leaving the port of Carthage, the
distance being 130 miles. Even were the atmosphere perfectly diaphanous,
which it is not, there would still be the difficulty that the vessels situated at
a distance of 130 miles would form in the centre of the retina an angle so
extremely acute that the image would be insensible, as those know who are
versed in optics.
As little can it be alleged that the talent or power of the Zahoris is
supernatural. In the first place, it is not credible that it has God as its
special author, since it is a virtue whose only use is to serve greed. It is not
announced that the Zahoris disinter treasures to furnish assistance to the
poor, or to make war on infidels. In the second" place, because, neither in
the sacred writings nor in ecclesiastical history do we read that God 1ms
granted this virtue as a permanent habit to any of His many illustrious
servants. How then can it be believed that, while refusing it to all
these His most intimate friends, He has reserved it for men in no way
remarkable by their merits ? In the third place, supernatural graces are
not limited to any particular nation, and of Zahoris, they are said to exist
only in Spain.
1 In the past century (says the Marquis de St. Aubin, tome 3, lib. 4. cap. 2) it
was declared that there were in Spain certain men who saw what was under ground
to a depth of 20 pike handles (picas). Many philosophers failed not to discover (as
they thought) reasons for persuading people that this might hapiien quite naturally.
He then states that the Mercure franrais of the year 172.S, published an account of a
Portuguese lady (named Pedegascha). She declared she saw what was in the earth
to a depth of thirty to forty fathoms, hut as regards the human body, she could not
see into it if clothed, the clothing preventing her vision. But the body being un
covered, she was able to observe all the interior parts, even the abscesses or any other
defect there might he, as well in the humours or soft parts as in the holid. It may be
that this fable had its origin not in Portugal, but in France. But this author does
not give credence to the existence of the Zahoris, justifying himself mainly for his
refusal of assent to my testimony, since having cited my work, he terminate** thus :
" The testimony of this Benedictine, being that of a Spaniard, is of great weight to
give assurance of the falsity of this opinion." [Feyjoo was a Spanish Benedictine.]
2 D 2
372 Profesxor W. F. Barrett. [part
Among the vulgar there is the belief that God dispenses this grace only
to those who are born on a Good Friday, without considering that there
should be an infinity of Zahoris, since many there are who are born on that
day. Others limit the power to the circumstance of being born at the
particular moment at which the Passion is being chanted. Even with this
restriction it would follow that there should be in the whole extent of Spain
from 700 to 800 Zahoris, since this total, more or less, results from the
supposition that about the same number of men are born every d;iy and
hour of the year, and that Spain (including Majorca and excluding Portugal)
possesses seven and a-half millions of persons, which is the population
determined by Sefior Don Geronymo de Urtariz in his excellent work, Theory
and Practice of Commerce and of Sailing. Consequently, on this computation
there would not be a province of Spain which had not four or five dozens of
Zahoris. Where are they, that we may see them ? Nor can it be said that
those who pretend to this grace hide it, since God does not concede virtues
that they may be of no use.
There remains then but to say that this virtue is superstitious, and that
those who exercise it have a compact, either expressed or implied, with the
devil. In truth, the work of extracting gold from the depths of the earth
is more of a nature to be attributed to diabolical influence than to the
Divine assistance, since an abundance of that precious metal rather promotes
vice than favours virtue. Such, indeed, appears to have been the thought
of the ancients when they pretended that Pluto, the infernal divinity, was
the first discoverer of mines of gold and silver.
The author then goes on to say that if the Zahoris really do exist,
they are either wizards or rogues, and he prefers to think the latter,
-as the former would involve a diabolical compact, a far greater crime
than being a mere rogue.
I have quoted this extract at some length, as it gives an interesting
picture of the habits of thought of a learned Spaniard 1 20 years ago.
It is evident the writer had no personal knowledge of the Zahoris, his
information about them appears only to be derived from traditional
stories coming from a preceding century. During the present century
I have only come across casual references to the Zahoris, and this race
of pretended seers, some of whom possibly may have had supernormal
vision, has long died out, even the very meaning of the word being
known to comparatively few.
In concluding this note I wish specially to acknowledge my in
debtedness to the wide learning and scholarship of my friend the Rev.
Maxwell Close M.A., for much kind assistance both here and else
where in this research.

Scientific and Literary Opinion.
Before closing the present Report it may be instructive to refer to
some of the scientific and literary reviews of the previous Report.
Before doing so I will quote, by permission, the following interesting
letters sent to me by two distinguished men of science.
I will first quote a letter from one of the highest authorities on
geology, Sir Archibald Geikie, D.C.L., F.R.S., etc., to whom my hearty
thanks are due for writing at such length :—
28, Jermyn Street, London, S.W., Noeember 8th, 1897.
On my return last week from a prolonged tour in Eastern Europe I
found among the papers and books awaiting me your Monograph on the
Divining Rod, and I spent most of yesterday in reading it. First let me
thank you for sending me a copy and next congratulate you on the
publication of so fair, temperate and interesting a statement of the
whole case.
As you may believe, my experience has chiefly been among the failures
of the dowsers, and I have necessarily been led to form a rather low
estimate of these men and their pretensions. But your narrative leads me
to recognise that I have never seen the other side, and that I may have done
them injustice. It seems to me that a large proportion of their successes
are such as any intelligent man, giving himself up to the observation of water
supply, might easily accomplish without anything more than mother wit to
guide him. It is most difficult to get accurate information regarding their
failures, and the true proportion these bear to their successes. The evidence
of the men themselves in this matter is not wholly satisfactory, nor is that
of their employers who have found water.
In all such matters I try to keep my mind open. There are so many
mysteries in nature that one learns every day how foolish is the attitude of
those men of science who dogmatically assert that such and such phenomena
are "bosh," "rot," "deception," "fraud," and all the other choice terms
they have so freely at command. I have been accustomed to look at the
dowsers as either self-deceived or consciously deceiving others. And even
after perusing your most interesting volume I am not prepared at once to
abandon this attitude. But you have brought forward such a body of
evidence that I must hold my judgment in suspense for a time. If I can be
satisfied that there is any instinct, faculty, or whatever you choose to call it,
whereby a man can detect the presence of underground running water, I shall
never say another word against dowsing, though I shall still think some of
the dowsers little better than rogues.
If there is such an instinct, why should it not show itself as unfailingly
in a young and inexperienced hand as in an old and hardened sinner ? You
attribute some of the failures to the inexperience of the performers. But if
374 Professor W. F. Barrett. [pant
,*,,
the effects are due to some direct reaction of the water below upon the
operator above, and not to any observation or reasoning on his part, it may
be open to question whether the faculty or instinct requires experience for
its development. Arch Geikie
Two criticisms are contained in the foregoing interesting letter :
(1) Sir Archibald Geikie suggests that a large proportion of the suc
cesses of the dowser are such as mother wit would account for. The
evidence adduced in the present Report enables us to judge whether
this is so, and the question has been fully discussed. (2) The other
criticism is that contained in the last paragraph of the letter. I do
not for one moment believe there is any " direct reaction of the water
below upon the operator above " ; neither a direct nor an indirect
action of a physical nature is at all probable. If, however, the dowser
is able to detect the presence of underground water by any sub
conscious process, or even supernormal instinct, it is conceivable that
experience and practice may consciously or subconsciously be of some
assistance, and I am disposed to think they are. Sir Archibald
Geikie refers to his experience of the failures of dowsers. I wish
particulars of these had been sent to me, as sometimes they rest
on hearsay. A great failure of Mullins was reported at Carlow and
referred to by my geological friends. Here is the result of an
investigation of it on the spot which I asked an able geologist to
make :—
Geological Survey of Ireland, Dublin, July 16tfi, 1900.
I have made inquiries about Mullins at Clonmel, as promised, and found,
to my disgust, that the people there made the poor man drunk and turned
his performances into a laugh !
J. R. KlLROE.
I will here add the letter of another distinguished naturalist,
Mr. A. R. Wallace, LL.D., F.R.S., who writes as follows :—
Parkstone, Dorset, September 12r/i, 1897.
I read your excellent and very thorough paper with the greatest ]A,eosvre,
and noted a few points of slight disagreement on which 1 determined to
write to you.
I have long been convinced of the reality of the power of the
"dowsers." Your resume shows how impossible it is to convince men
by any amount of evidence till the time is ripe for them to receive it.
The large amount of the evidence is even a disadvantage. Few will read
and iceiyh the mass of evidence you have collected, and I have no
doubt many of the sceptics will accuse you of believing anything you
are told.
Now for my criticism. At p. 239 you say there are two points adeerse to
the dowser— one being their "absurd" idea of the general distribution
of underground water—either as springs on definite spots or as narrow
xxxvni.] . Appendix G. -•]75
underground rivers. But if they really and as a rule believed the former—of
which I can find no evidence in your Report—it would, as it seems to
me, not be adverse to their possession of some exceptional faculty, but
in their favour.1 For if they are totally ignorant of the real laws of
water-distribution, the chief objection, that they work by acute observation
and knowledge, falls to the ground. And as to the second "absurd"
supposition—of water being often in narrow underground streams or
veins—if your evidence proves anything, it proves that it is often a fact,
and how can believing in a fact of nature be "absurd"? Again, the
whole of the dowsers' business would be gone if the geologists' theory
of saturated strata or surfaces was always or generally true. For then,
as is the case over considerable areas, any one, could get water by sinkmg
to the necessary depths to reach the water-bearing stratum. Consequently,
in such districts dowsers are never required. But where the reverse is
the case—and your neighbour may have a good well at 30 ft. while you
sink 60 ft. in vain— in such districts alone the dowser is employed ; hence,
to him, all the available evidence shows underground water to be strictly
limited. If he professes to know that this is the unieersal mode of
distribution, of course he would be "absurdly" ignorant, but 1 am not
aware that he ever says so ; whereas the geologists do say, or imply,
that the reverse is so generally the case that the dowser can do nothing
except by guess, etc., etc. ! If either of the two is "absurd," it is not
the dowser.
Some geologists are sublime in their inconsistency. One geologic critic
says "any cottager could have given the same advice" as the dowser,
—as if in a district where "every cottager" knew where to obtain water,
any man would be fool enough to get either a dowser or a geologist to
find it !
Mr. Wallace then discusses the question of unconscious muscular
action as the cause of the motion of the rod, but this part of his letter
I have quoted in Part XL when dealing with that subject. As
before remarked, whatever Mr. Wallace writes is worthy of most
careful consideration, for his opinions generally prove to be right
in the long run, his observation being keener, and his range of know
ledge wider, than most of his critics.
In connection with the question of the influence of evidence on
belief referred to in the second sentence of Dr. A. R. Wallace's letter,
it may not be out of place to quote here the opinion of one of the
1 I stated on the page referred to by Mr. Wallace that according to geological
opinion " underground water usually exists in wide saturated areas " and this opinion
was discussed more fully in Appendix B to the previous Report. At the same time
I ventured to say that the evidence cited in that Report ixiinted to the frequent
occurrence, underground, of permeable channels as well as permeable areas, and hence
that geologists had not sufficiently recognised the truth of the dowser's point of
view. As a matter of fact, the dowser's most successful achievements are just in
those districts where geologists most often fail, viz., in regions where underground
water does exist in narrow fissures or channels. This is shown in Mr. Westlake's
useful Appendix, p. 3-40.—W. F. B. ^

earliest and best friends of the S.P.R., Mr. C. C. Massey, who writes
to me as follows :—
I am more than ever convinced that it is not so much evidence as a
disposition to credit it that is wanted. Is there such a thing as a purely
objective standpoint towards evidence ? I doubt it, as also I doubt that any
evidence whatever can avail to overcome an adverse subjective standpoint.
I think the true function of evidence is quite misconceived when evidence is
supposed to be that which generates belief. p p Massfy
There is much truth in what Mr. Massey says ; whether it be due
to the inertia of our mental processes, which tends to preserve habits
of thought in the straight line along which they have been started, or
whatever be the cause, there is a real difficulty in believing in anything
unfamiliar to us, and it requires a genuine, and often painful mental
effort to overcome our tendency to keep on the old lines of thought.
Hence it is that the flimsiest evidence, if it appeals to our preconceived
ideas, is usually accepted without question ; whilst, by the majority of
people, the weightiest evidence is rejected, if it requires a dislocation
of our familiar ideas. This is amusingly illustrated by a story recently
told me of an old countrywoman, who firmly believed her sailor son,
when he mentioned Pharaoh's chariot-wheels as lying on the shores of
the Red Sea, but was insulted by his silly stories when he told her that
he had seen flying fish V
On page 221 of my previous paper I refer to the then President of
the Geologists' Association of London, Mr. T. V. Holmes, F.G.S.,
as having recently read a paper on the divining rod before the
Anthropological Institute. That paper has since been published in
the Journal of the Institute, and I have to thank Mr. Holmes not
only for the kind reference to my work in his paper, but also for much
valuable help which he has from time to time freely given to me, and
for his suggestive criticisms from the point of view of a field geologist.
And here let me say that in the practical examination of this
question the co-operation of a geologist is necessary. With the
exception of Mr. Westlake, F.G.S., whose valuable aid I have
already acknowledged, the difficulty has been, just as in other
departments of the work of this Society, to induce those to give
us their help whose scientific training in a particular direction renders
them specially qualified to conduct an investigation such as the present.
If, however, I may judge from the letters that have reached me from
some eminent geologists, the evidence given in my previous paper
renders such co-operation less improbable in the future.
Turning now to the scientific Press, the leading organ of British
science, Nature, had a lengthy review of the Report, a review which
xxxvin.] Appendix G. 377
could hardly be described as written in a judicial spirit. l Neverthe
less I am grateful to the reviewer for his kindly personal references,
and for drawing my attention to a weak piece of evidence that
was inserted in the Report, which I will deal with first.
On p. 130 of the Report particulars are given of what appears to
be a good case on behalf of the dowser at Wootton, in the Isle of
Wight. The report in the Morning Post was confirmed by the dowser,
and also by the owner of the estate, a clergyman, who, in reply to my
inquiries, stated that " it is quite true that he [the dowser] discovered
an abundant supply of water where efforts had previously been mado
in vain." The Nature reviewer, speaking from personal knowledge of
the place, challenges this, and says that three useless wells were sunk
by the dowser's advice, and that it did not need a diviner to discover
water where it was eventually found. I asked Mr. Westlake, F.G.S.,
who has made a special study of hydro-geology, to visit the place and
report to me : he kindly did so, and from his report, contained in
Appendix A, p. 328, there seems little doubt that this case affords no
evidence for or against the dowser. It appears, however, that the
Nature reviewer is inaccurate in one respect. After visiting the spot
in November, 1897, and making careful inquiries from residents in the
neighbourhood, Mr. Westlake writes to me as follows :—
I found that local opinion did not coincide with that of the reviewer in
Nature. My informants, Messrs. Cole, Turner, Newbury and Barton, said,
after reading the review, they knew nothing about the three useless wells
which, according to the reviewer, had been sunk at the diviner's instance in
the waterless Oligocene clays. It was true that wells had been sunk in these
clays near the railway station, and one at Woodside, without success, but
they had not been located by diviners. It was the local people' without the
rod who made these mistakes, and as they were jealous of the diviner, a
stranger " from the mainland," I think I should have heard of any mistake
he made. What the diviner did was to find water where everybody—after
the event—knew it was. The reviewer says it " did not need a diviner to
discover" it—meaning, should not have needed—with which last I quite
agree, and regard the Wootton experiments as no evidence one way or
the other.
Curiously enough, not far from the place singled out by the
geological reviewer in Nature is a case where the geologist failed to
find water and the dowser succeeded. This has been given in detail
in Part III., p. 164.
To return, the "principal criticism," remarks the Nature reviewer,
" we have to make on Professor Barrett's collection of facts is, that he
does not give enough weight to the natural tendency of mankind

378 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part
to conceal their failures." I was well aware of the difficulty of
arriving at a just estimate of the number of failures on the part of the
dowser, but every effort was made to ascertain them, and this point is
specially referred to at the outset of the previous Report on p. 4, again
on p. 63, and again on pp. 238 and 239. As I wish to emphasise this
aspect, I will repeat what was then said :—
It must be borne in mind that (especially among amateur dowsers) one is
more likely to hoar of success than failure, and therefore an extensive and
searching inquiry is necessary before any safe induction can be drawn
(p. 239) . . . All that was possible in the present investigation was to
make the range of evidence as wide and unbiassed as possible, and not
exclude a single case of failure that was substantiated. This has been done
(p. 238). (The pages refer to the previous Report.)
It must not be forgotten that, even with skilled geologists, failures
are by no means unknown in their predictions of water supply, though
I am not aware of any treatise on hydro-geology that thinks it
essential to arrive at and set forth the percentage of failures which
different geologists have had. Because some people have had a
costly experience of the vanity of human opinion, even of expert
geological opinion, that is no reason for rejecting the mdispensable
help which expert geologists can give in selecting a suitable site
for the boring of an artesian well. It is true they sometimes lead
to an outlay of £19.600 to no very obvious purpose, but then
what the town loses in water and rates, geology gains in strati-
graphical knowledge. To some of these scientific gains, at the
cost of the ratepayers, I have referred on p. 235 of the previous
Report. In fact, one of the best English hydro-geologists, Mr.
De Ranee, F.G.S., states in a letter to me, which I quoted on
p. 234, that the predictions (as regards water sources) of even
leading geologists, who are not specialists, "rest upon chance," and
he would not be surprised to hear their failures were as numerous
as the dowsers' ! If both rest upon chance, that certainly would be the
case, but if either the dowsers' or the geologists' failures are notably
fewer than chance would suggest, then the predictions of one or
the other do not rest upon chance. Obviously, the question of the
dowser's success is one thing ; how he arrives at it quite another, and
the latter is a matter of insignificance to any one who merely wants
to sink a well. A scientific inquiry, such as I have attempted, neces
sarily embraces both these questions.
Following upon this review is a letter from Mr. Wadsworth, of the
Michigan College of Mines,1 a letter which was largely quoted by the
\ i Nature, January 6th, 1898.
xxxviii.] Appendix G. 379
English press as exploding the whole of the dowser's claims.1 I have
already referred to and quoted from this letter on a preceding
page, p. 288, so that I need only say that Mr. Wadsworth's theory is
a little belated, apart from its failing altogether to account for the
correspondence of the movement of the rod with the presence of
underground water.
I will now briefly refer to some of the comments on the Report
that have appeared in the ordinary newspaper press. A large collection
of press notices, reviews and articles based on that report have reached
niea; but as might be expected, instructive criticism on any of the
subjects which occupy the attention of our Society is rarely to be
found in the columns of the ordinary daily or weekly newspaper press,
with the honourable exception of one or two papers such as the
Spectator, and from erudite critics such as Mr. A. Lang, to whom
I am also indebted for the excellent outline of the Report given in
Longmans Magazine for December, 1897.
A p.ussing reference must also be made to an able and interesting
review of the Report that occupied several columns of that influential
French newspaper, the Journal des De'bats. The review was signed,
and was from the pen of a naturalist and critic, M. H. de Varigny, to
whom my hearty thanks are due for his careful study and summary of
my previous paper, and also for some useful information he has
subsequently sent to me.
A well-known Cardiff newspaper devoted a leading article to a
concise and fair outline of the Report, which led to a vigorous and
protracted correspondence in its columns, between a worthy self-taught
local geologist and our friend the Rev. A. T. Fryer, whose kind
assistance I have already acknowledged, and to whom my thanks are
due for his able and temperate letters in the Western Mail. I am also
indebted to the editor of the Richmond Times for information he has
kindly sent me, and for devoting so large a space in his journal to an
outline of my Report and its discussion.
1 Mr. Wadsworth's theory was anticipated by his own countryman, Mr. Ralph
Emerson, in 1826. As mentioned in my previous paper, this is not Ralph Waldo
Emerson, but an able contemporary of his who entered the ministry a little earlier
than his famous namesake ; it was some time before I discovered there were two con
temporary Ralph Emersons, probably fellow-students.
- It is only right that I should here acknowledge the care and skill with which
Durrant's Press Cutting Agency have supplied me, not only with these press notices,
but also with many hundreds of paragraphs and articles on the subject of the divining
rod and the search for underground water in general. All of these have been read
and a few have led to useful correspondence, but, as a rule, these newspaper extracts
are wearisome and worthless.
S
380 Professor W. F. Barrett. [fart
Several columns of a weekly journal, the New Aye, were also
devoted to a friendly discussion of the report and on the S.P.R.
in general. The article is signed, and the writer, Mr. D. Balsillie,
like so many others, assumes that a plausible explanation of any
obscure phenomenon is probably the correct one, forgetting that
any experimenter worthy of the name is sure to have exhausted
all obvious explanations before he ventures upon the publication
of any experiments which he believes point to some fresh addition to
our knowledge. Mr. Balsillie takes it for granted, from Hansen and
Lehmann's experiments, that nasal whispering " explains " thought-
transference, and says, almost in Dr. Scripture's1 words : —
Thus the mystery of thought-transference without contact has been
cleared up in a way which any one can verify for himself who has access to a
psychological laboratory.
This has been so conclusively answered by Professor Sidgwick and
Professor James that I will not dwell upon it; but Mr. Balsillie draws
from it the inference that, as the dowser only detects running, and
not stagnant, water, he probably derives his information from some
sub-conscious perception of sound, and hence he adds :—
It might be worth Professor Barrett's while to give some heed to what
we have said above about the psychological explanation of thought-
transference.
The possible exaltation of sense perception on the part of the
dowser has been dealt with in the previous and the present
Report.
It only remains for me to thank the Editor of Light for the
full and excellent summary of the Report that appeared in his
journal.
A brief notice of two books on the divining rod, which have been
recently published, may here be added. Neither of these books has
any scientific or literary value. One is an extraordinary medley, written
by an enthusiastic believer in the rod, and the other is simply a trade
advertisement of a professional dowser. I should have passed them
both over, but they formed the points d' appui for two interesting
articles in the Daily News, and one was the subject of a lengthy review
in Nature, usually considered a scientific journal.2 The first-named
book is by Mr. Beaven, and is called Tales of the Divining Rod. It is
quite impossible to notice this book seriously, as it is a rhapsody in
turgid English on the glorious " mysteries of rhabdomancy," compiled
by a tenant farmer and fruit grower of Hereford, who has found the
1 The New Psychology, p. 260.
1 Nature, November 2nd, 1890.
xxxviii.] Appendix G. 381
dowser of considerable use to his fruit farm. Mr. Beaven's experience
of the rod I gave in the previous Report, on pp. 157 and 158, but in
his book, fiction is so intermingled with fact that the author tells us,
when we come to Chapter XXI :—
All that I have hitherto written concerning the divining rod has been
mixed more or less with the imaginative . . . but now, to the end of
the book, the truth, and the truth only, shall be stated. That at least is
my intention.
This laudable intention he strives to carry out by transposing
to the remaining half of his volume a large part of my previous
paper ; but, just as in the earlier half he allowed his readers to
guess which was fact and which fiction, so in the latter half he leaves
them, as a rule, to guess which are his own words and which
are mine.
Mr. Beaven tells us on p. 201 his theory is that, owing to the
beneficence of the Creator, every
imprisoned spring sends up an urgent and unmistakeable message to the
surface . . . for man's special benefit. . . . Were those electrical
influences visible, we should probably see every hill and dale dotted over
with electric waving mounds, each uprising coil containing a central column
which whirls in an eccentric manner precisely over each fountain head ;
while connected with most of these magnetic mounds are electrical currents
waving on the earth's surface over the exact track of every subterranean
watercourse. (!)
These " waving electric currents " are perceived by certain " gifted
individuals" who have a " secretive electric power," etc. But I need
not proceed further, we shall all agree that somebody's brain certainly
"whirls in an eccentric manner," and Mr. Beaven's book will at any
rate afford entertainment to any scientific man who happens to
read it.
The other book, as I have said, is an advertisement issued by the
dowser, Mr. B. Tompkins, who writes after his name " W.F."
(meaning water-finder). Mr. Tompkins' Theory of Water-finding (as
his book is called), is even more amusing than the descriptive letters
he has conferred upon himself ; his theory is, of course, " Electricity."
He and Mr. Beaven resemble the rustic who, describing to me a
ghostly light he had seen at a certain spot, said (in answer to my
inquiries as to what the light resembled), that " it was just like an
electric light." When I asked him where he had seen the electric
light, he replied " I never seen it, maister, but it were just like it."
So Mr. Tompkins tells us all about electricity, what it really is,
how it moves the rod, and how he has thus been able to " unfold the
382 Professor W. F. Barrett. [part
-.
bewildering enigma of the divining rod" . . . and how he trusts
ere long to receive the reward due to his efforts.
Of a very different character is an excellent little manual on the
discovery of underground water by E. S. Auscher, entitled L Art
de de'couvrir les Sources (Paris, Balhere, 1899). This book is not
meant for hydro-geologists, but to meet the needs of those who require
a general knowledge of the method of finding underground water. It
also includes a wide range of subject matter subsidiary to its main
object, such as the analysis of water, the best methods of boring, etc.
A section is devoted to the btu/uetle divinatoire (divining rod), but
here the author, like so many other writers on this subject, falls into
numerous errors, not only in the history of the baguette, but in its
mode of use, etc. He states (p. 144) that
the skill of the operator consists in moving the index fingers (les index) so
slightly that the rod appears to turn automatically, as if it obeyed a super
natural impulse.
And yet, a few pages further on, the author states that the dis
tinguished members of the commission appointed by the Paris
Academy of Sciences to inquire into the baguette,1 arrived at the
conclusion that the motion of the rod was due to unconscious muscular
action on the part of the operator. Moreover, M. Auscher appears to
be unaware that one of the most eminent anthropologists in France,
Professor Gabriel de Mortillet, was once a successful dowser with the
baguette, and has written a little book on the subject, entitled Hisloire
de I'hydroscopic et de la baguette divinatoire, which was published in
1850. M. Auscher often refers to the work of L'Abbe" Paramelle as
a water finder, and speaks of him with a certain respect. So little
is known of Paramelle in England that I have given an outline of his
life-work and book in Appendix D (see p. 352), and have devoted some
space to a discussion of his methods, in so far as they relate to the
general subject of this paper.
As these sheets are passing through the press a statement has
appeared in several English and foreign newspapers that a new French
Commission had been appointed to inquire into the evidence on behalf
of the baguette divinaloire (divining rod), and that a hydraulic engineer
was appointed president of the Commission, giving his name and
address. After several futile attempts to get further particulars,
I received at last two badly printed circulars—one advertising the

the French Academy nominated a Committee of three eminent men, MM. Chevrenl,
Boussingault, and Babinet, to report on a paper on the BtujueUe Dirinatoire which
had been presented by a M. Riondet. Chevreul was requested by his colleagues to
draw up the report, which led to the. publication of his work on the Divining Rod

business of the engineer in question and soliciting the favour of
a commission, and the other stating that the Socie'te' Magne'tique de
France (whatever that may be) had appointed a committee of five
persons, chiefly members of that Society, to report on the "apparatus"
employed by sounders to seek for underground water. In answer to
inquiries from an English amateur dowser, the business president
of this so-called commission states that he is deputed "to make a
precise inquiry into the mathematical laws (!) of the bm/uetle," and he
adds his opinion that money ought to be made out of the sourciers'
business. From which the scope and scientific value of this commission
may be inferred ; very different from the 1853 Committee referred to
in the foot-note on the previous page.

SUPPLEMENT.
I.
PSEUDO-POSSESSION.1
By F. W. H. Myers.
I have selected for joint discussion two books which, while differing
widely in scope and purpose, do nevertheless agree in furnishing
striking examples of a kind of study which is at present of prime
importance to the psychologist.
Both works contain careful analyses of certain cases of modified
or multiplex personality;—ranging from the hysterical ide'es fixes with
which Dr. Janet deals, to the complex case of apparently sane and
healthy, yet enormously active, subliminal mentation which forms the
subject of Professor Flournoy's book.
Now I hold that all accessible modifications of personality should be
studied in detail and in connection ;—so that all may ultimately fall into
their place in that long series which extends from the confines of
insanity on the one hand up to possession and ecstasy on the other.
We ought through such study to attain a much wider conception
than of old of the possibilities which lie hid in man. For the psycho
logist must surely feel more and more the insufficiency of the physician's
conception of ordinary health and sanity as a summit from which all
other states constitute a decline. It will not do any longer to regard
human nature only with the aim of maintaining it as it already is.
That is the doctor's view, and it was the necessary view for science to
begin with ; but the time has come for disinterested curiosity as well as
for mere therapeutic care. There exists a greater range, we may fairly
suppose, in the scale of cosmic existence above human nature than there
exists below it; and, while taking care not to narrow or injure our exist
ing powers, it should also now be our object to learn, if possible, how
to extend them. Janet's book is important on the one side; Flournoy's
takes us one short step onwards on the other. Both books are not
only learned and painstaking but even brilliant. Few students of

morbid psychology have ever shown an acumen equal to Dr. Janet's ;—
few writers on matter of difficult controversy have ever produced so
delightful an impression of absolute, instinctive candour as Professor
Flournoy. The literary execution is in each case first-rate, and the
mastery of these works is one of the most agreeable as well as essential
tasks of the experimental psychologist.
To begin with Professor Janet. It must be remembered, of course,
that the aim of his work is medical, and great though its philosophical
interest is, a certain allowance must be made throughout for the
environment of the Salpetriere. In that atmosphere human beings are
apt to get divided somewhat too simply into medecins and malades,—
mon excellent maitre and la pauvre dlse'quilibree. In hospital lectures it
is not easy to remember that there is a great world outside the hospital
where faculties are more mixed and ideals perhaps more expansive.
Once outside the hospital—to make at once what small reserves I
have to make as to Dr. Janet's competence—this acute physician walks
with a less certain step. The paper on crystal-gazing, for instance, in
Vol. I. of the present work, while ingeniously illustrating such part of
the subject as hospital practice can teach, does yet merely evade the
harder problems involved ;—evades them so adroitly that beyond this
one sentence it calls for no comment here.1
Since there are over a thousand large closely-printed octavo pages
to deal with in Professor Janet's book, some slight preliminary sketch
of its main topics will be of use to the reader.
The first volume deals with experimental studies on the troubles of
the will, the attention, and the memory ;—troubles which are in most
cases associated with ide'es fixes or hypertrophies of some one " systema-
tised group " of memories or emotions.
Thus the volume contains in Chap. I. the striking case of
" Marcelle,"—a patient in whom "aboulia," or defect of will, is the most
marked of many symptoms. Chap. III. is devoted to cases of loss of
memory ; Chap. IV., V, IX., to other extensive confusions and
disabilities, induced by the persistence of ide'es fixes below the conscious
threshold. Chap. X. is a history of actual pseudo-possession, showing
the mischief wrought by a fixed idea self-suggested in continued reverie.
Other chapters on allochiria, hemianopsia, contractures, paralysis, etc.,
show these subconscious self-suggestions operating in curiously limited
and definite ways.
1 Since I' shall (have nothing else but admiration and adhesion for Dr. Janet's
work, I think it right here to call attention—his own attention most of all—to Mr.
Andrew Lang's criticisms in The Making of Religion, p. 367, seq. These strictures,
coming from an eminent writer who is assuredly not chargeable with any parti pria
in favour of the marvellous ;—assuredly not lacking either in urbanity or in acumen ;—
deserve, I think, to be pondered by Dr. Janet, with no mere thought of controversial
rejoinder.
2 E
386 F. W. H. Myers. [Supplement.
The second volume contains observations on no less than 152 cases.
Whether the disorders are classed as "psychical" or as "somatic,"
they all illustrate the same general thesis ;—namely, the great variety of
ways in which the hypertrophy of some idea, impression, impulse, or
memory, can invade and disintegrate that human personality, which
needs the maintenance of an equilibrium between so many complex
and competitive agencies within.
It is satisfactory to find that hypnotic suggestion,—used by Dr.
Janet with great patience and tact,—is able gradually to remove a
great number of these mental spasms and insistent memories.,. It is
not, of course, enough to make the suggestion crudely and bluntly. In
order to enable it to take, it must be grafted adroitly upon the patient's
mental condition of the moment. First of all, one must discover the
hidden sources of her trouble,—of which sources, strangely enough, she
is often herself unaware ;—and then one must gradually suggest
successive slight modifications in the painful memory. " The incident
which gave you the shock was not so bad as you think ;—it really
happened thus and thus," says Dr. Janet, —until at last the old horror is
forgotten,—or transformed into something grotesque or innocuous.
Thus one patient is led to believe that the haunting word " cholera "
is really the name of a Chinese general ;—another, who has loved not
wisely, but too well, is induced to see the lover of her hallucinatory
memories with head transformed into a pig's ;—and undergoes a
revulsion of feeling, a la Titania. (Vol. II., p. 135.)
Another curious case (Vol. II., p. 256) in which hypnotism first
explained the trouble and then did much to amend it, is that of a boy
" Rou," whose short life has been plentifully interspersed with hysterical
" fugues " or escapades, of which (like Ansel Bourne, Proceedings,
Vol. VII., p. 221) he loses all memory when he returns to normal life.
He comes to himself suddenly,—in a forest,—in a convent,—in a street-
passage,—and, as I say, remembers nothing ;—except an occasional
drenching from rain or river,—which has, in fact, for the moment,
partially awakened him from his somnambulic state. Hypnotisation,
however, brings back the memory of the " fugues " (just as it did with
Ansel Bourne), and we find that they have all been the working out
of an ide'e fixe,—that of going to sea as a cabin-boy. During these
fugues the lad was anresthetic, and consequently endured cheerfully
extraordinary hardships, allowing himself with perfect insouciance to
be treated by rough canal-men like a beast of burden. Hypnotic
suggestion was able to avert these fiu/ues whenever the boy was dimly
conscious that they were coming on ;—although his brain was too pro
foundly affected to make the prognosis a hopeful one.
Many of these cases remind us of the narratives of Drs. Breuer
and Freud, in their Studien iiber Hysterie, noticed in S.P.R. Proceedingx,
Part xxxviii] Pseudo-Possession. 387
Vol. IX., pp. 12-15. I give as a sample one case of this type,
(Janet, Vol. II., p. 234), where hysterical attacks depending on the
revival of a scheme of emotion (e'tat e'motif sysh!matique) which has
become subconscious are cured by this same process of first di»:mvr'mg,
and then gradually removing, the alarming memory.
A girl of 18, designated as Lie, has suffered for two years from
almost daily convulsive attacks. Each attack constitutes a revival of
a past scene, constituting in rudimentary form a secondary state of
personality. The attack begins with syncope, and the return to
conscious life is a return to a condition of terror, with cries of " Lucien,
Lucien" ;—as if appealing to some one for defence ;—then she rushes to
the window and cries " Thieves ! " and then gradually re-enters her
ordinary state. Asked what she can remember of such a scene, the
girl can recollect nothing. She thinks that her attacks were originally
induced by distress and fear at the sight of her father's drunkenness.
She knows no one called Lucien. She came to Paris alone, and there
seems to be no external way of supplying any possible defect in her
memory.
Hypnotism, however, comes promptly to the physician's aid.
Thrown into the hypnotic sleep, the patient recovers at once the details
of a tragic story of her childhood ;—of an insult offered to her, from
which a " Lucien " had defended her ;—and of a theft at the chateau
where she worked, which followed a few days later. These terrifying
events gave rise to attacks of syncope, somnambulism, etc. ;—and those
attacks had now, in their turn, obliterated the memory of the events
from the patient's waking mind. When she was reminded of them,
they gradually recurred to her ;—and at the same moment the convul
sive attacks which had been troubling her more or less ever since the
events occurred, entirely ceased.
Here is another remarkable case (p. 248) of the efficacy of hypnotic
suggestion, first in discovering the nature of a mental confusion, and
then in curing it. A young officer, Pk., is brought to the Salpetriere,
having fallen down in the Champs Elysees, and seeming entirely
bewildered on rising up again. Arrived at the hospital, he holds out
his hand to Dr. Janet and addresses him as Dr. N.—a doctor at a
militarv hospital at Brest. Asked what he means, and where he
supposes himself to be, he replies, " We are at the military hospital at
Brest, and you are Dr. N. They brought me here a few days ago—in
May, 1896." As a matter of fact, this occurred on July 6th, 1895.
Next day, the patient is in a different phase, and knows quite well that
he is in Paris,—although he remembers nothing about imagining himself
to be at Brest. On inquiry it appears that this young man of twenty-
eight is suffering from the combined effects of typhoid, dysentery,
marsh-fever, sunstroke, an unfortunate marriage, and a tendency to
388 F. W. H. Myers. [Supplement.
absinthe. These troubles have made him hysterical, so that if he
receives any shock or stimulus—as a threat of divorce or a glass of
brandy—he is apt to become unconscious, and then to act in all sorts of
odd ways, till he wakes up again in surprise and with no recollection.
Fortunately he can be thrown at once into a somnambulic state
which brings back the memory of the spontaneous somnambulisms.
He is then able to explain how he came to suppose himself to be in the
hospital at Brest and in the year 1890. He had, in fact, while walking
in the Champs Elysees, been planning to apply for treatment in a
military hospital, and calculating that by about May, 1896, he would
be in the hospital at Brest, where he knew the aforesaid Dr. X.
Falling into his secondary state, he had no longer the ability to
distinguish between this reverie and reality ;—and the continuing
reverie substituted itself for the actual surroundings, so that he
imagined himself to be already in the Brest hospital,—as if his
calculation had already worked itself out.
So soon as his excessive modifiability had thus been discovered, it
was comparatively easy to give him the suggestions needed to set right
his habits and to inspire him with strength for the future. He has
since distinguished himself in military service abroad.
The stories of these distressed patients are not always thus tragic.
The characteristic " anguish of doubt," for instance,—the recherche
atu/oissante which makes many lives miserable,—may centre itself on
some subject not intrinsically painful. Thus a patient of Legrand du
Saulle's (as Dr. Janet reminds us) suffered from a perpetual anxiety to
feel sure whether any woman whom he happened to have met was
pretty or plain. An attendant was paid to answer, " Plain, sir ! I
should say, decidedly plain ! " to each inquiry ;—and the too sensitive
heart was kept at rest. But on one occasion his master asked this man
during a railway journey as to the looks of the young woman at the
ticket-window of the station whence they had started ;—and the man
was stupid enough to say that he had not observed her. This led to a
terrible crisis, and the valet had to travel back the whole way in order
to bring his report, " Plain, sir ! decidedly plain ! "
Another distressing but somewhat grotesque case was that of a
kleptomaniac who stole from everybody, but especially from himself.
Worse than the somnambulic hero of an old Ingoldsby Legend, who
buried a fresh pair of his own trousers every night in the garden,
this boy could keep nothing by night or day from his own marauding
hands. He stole from himself when he was asleep, but he stole from
other people when they at any rate were wide awake, and saw perfectly
what he was doing. In fact, the psychological interest of this case
lies in the poor fellow's own condition at the moment of his thefts,—
which was a kind of semi-hypnotisation by involuntary self-suggestion,
Burt xxxvin.] Pseudo-Possession. 389
closely resembling the half-hypnotised state into which an awakened
subject falls when the time comes for him to execute some post-hypnotic
suggestion. This unwilling kleptomaniac seemed to be subject to a
permanent self-suggestion to carry off any object which he particularly
noticed ; and his own gaze at a silver spoon would throw him into a
dreamy condition in which he inevitably put that spoon in his pocket.
Another melancholy aberration, which is not without its comic
element, is described by Janet under the heading of " Dipsomania of
oaf4 an lait, complicated with kleptomania of petits pains."
Mme Pt., a nervous personage, suffered from a dyspepsia which
her doctor mistakenly attributed to dilatation of the stomach. He
limited her to a wineglass of liquid at each meal, and made her live
mainly on dry toast. Her husband supported the doctor, but meantime
she saw him drinking cafe" au lait and eating rolls with gusto and
freedom ;—" c'e'tail pour elle le supplice de Tantale." One day her
patience gave way. When her husband's back was turned, she threw
herself upon a roll which he had left on his plate, then rushed to the
cremerie, and made herself an excellent cafe" au lait. She was none the
worse for it ; her husband it was who died. After his death the
passion for cafe" au lait grew on her, so that when her stock of milk was
exhausted at night she would tread her room in anguished longing till
the crSmeries opened in the morning. Not venturing to drink more
than two cups at the same cremerie, she would wander about Paris and
drink at various shops 20 or 30 cups per day.
All these cups she duly and promptly paid for. But a morbid
aggravation came. She wanted rolls with her coffee ; but now that there
was no one to forbid her the rolls, they lost their savour,—the savour
of petit pain dejendu. A way of supplying this savour occurred to
her ;—she stole the rolls. She would go to a shop and pay for one roll,—-
and adroitly make several others fall into a Gampish umbrella. Having
collected a dozen or so, she would go home to eat them, and start
again.
Now, this poor woman—this coffee-megalomaniac, as an erudite
friend of Professor Janet's has termed her—becomes not infrequently
very uncomfortable inside. She detests her own obsession, her ideejixe ;
—but she cannot cure herself ; nor had Professor Janet, at the time of
writing,, succeeded in curing her. .
A grotesque, yet a mournful story! a tragedy of the "free breakfast
table ' ! nay, a satire on all the inordinate cravings of men, whose
insatiability is the penalty for their self-abandonment, and which
disgust by the very fulfilment of desire. Dr. Janet's book contains
examples of "fixed subconscious ideas" at various depths of submer
gence ;—the most completely forgotten being often the most potent for
mischief. A fixed memory of this kind,—removed, so to say, from the
390 F. W. H. Myers. [Supplement.
general mental circulation,—may act in precisely the same way as an
actual lesion to motor nerves, inducing definite physical disabilities.
"The contraction persists," says Dr. Janet of one such case (Vol. I.
p. 344) " because the emotion persists, involving always the same
psychological and physiological consequences. It is, so to say, a,ji.wd
emotion ;—a variety of fixed idea of which we from outside can see only
one exterior manifestation, while the patient herself is unaware of the
interior phenomenon which determines it."
To attempt to cure such patients without first discovering the
true cause of mischief by some automatic message (such as writing
or crystal vision or utterance in hypnotic trance) which emanates
from subliminal strata of their being, is like trying to open a secret
drawer without having discovered the spring. The minute and patient
attention which Dr. Janet bestows on such cases contrasts strikingly
with the rough and ready methods thought good enough for hysterical
patients by doctors of the old school. It means, of course, one more
application of true scientific method to problems which the Philistine
physician did not think worth his science. There can be no better
example of this than Dr. Janet's treatment of a singular problem which
the mistakes of brutal ignorance turned in old times into a veritable
scourge of our race. I speak of demoniacal possession ;—in which
affliction Dr. Janet has shown himself a better than ecclesiastical
exorcist.
I give here a typical case of pseudo-possession. Achille,—as
Professor Janet calls him,—was a timid and rather morbid young man ;
but he was married to a good wife, and nothing went specially wrong
with him until his return from a business journey in 1890. He then
became sombre and taciturn,—sometimes even seemed unable to speak,
—then took to his bed and lay murmuring incomprehensible words, and
at last said farewell to his wife and children, and stretched himself out
motionless for a couple of days, while his family waited for his last
breath.
(Vol. I., p. 382.)—"Suddenly one morning, after two days of apparent
death, Achille sat up in bed with his eyes wide open, and burst into a
terrible laugh. It was a convulsive laugh which shook all his limbs,—
an exaggerated laugh which twisted his mouth ;—a lugubrious, satanic
laugh which went on for more than two hours.
" From this moment everything was changed—-Achille leapt from
his bed and refused all attentions. To every question he answered,
'There's nothing to be done ! let's have some champagne ! it's the end
of the world ! ' Then he uttered piercing cries ' they are burning me ;
—they are cutting me to pieces ! ' "
After an agitated sleep, Achille woke up with the conviction that
he was possessed with a devil. And in fact his mouth now uttered
part xxxviii] Pseudo-Possession. 391
blasphemies, his limbs were contorted, and he repeatedly made un
successful efforts at suicide. Ultimately he was taken to the Salpetriere
and placed under Professor Janet, who recognised at once the classic
signs of possession. The poor man kept protesting against the odious
outrages on religion which he attributed to a devil inside him, moving
his tongue against his will. " Achille could say, like a celebrate!
victim of possession, Pere Surin, ' It is as though I had two souls ; one
of which has been dispossessed of its body and the use of its organs,
and is frantic at the sight of the other soul which has crept in.' "
It was by no means easy to get either at Achille or at his possessing
devil. Attempts to hypnotise him failed, and any remonstrance was
met with insult. But the wily psychologist was accustomed to such
difficulties, and had resort to a plan too insidious for a common devil to
suspect. He gently moved the hand of Achille in such a way as to sug
gest the act of writing, and having thus succeeded in starting automatic
script he got the devil thus to answer questions quietly put while the
raving was going on as usual. " I will not believe in your power,"
said Professor Janet to the malignant intruder, " unless you give me a
proof." " What proof ? " " Raise the poor man's left arm without his
knowing it." This was done,—to the astonishment of poor Achille ;—
and a series of suggestions followed, all of which the demon trium
phantly and unsuspectingly carried out, to show his power. Then came
the suggestion to which Professor Janet had been leading up. It was
like getting the djinn into the bottle. " You cannot put Achille
soundly to sleep in that armchair ! " " Yes, I can ! " No sooner said
than done,—and no sooner done than Achille was delivered from his
tormentor,—from his own tormenting self.
For there in that hypnotic sleep he was gently led on to tell all his
story ;—and such stories, when told to a skilled and kindly auditor, are
apt to come to an end in the very act of being told.
Achille had been living in a day-dream ; it was a day-dream which
had swollen to these nightmare proportions, and had, as it were, ousted
his rational being ;—and in the deeper self-knowledge which the
somnambulic state brings with it the dream and the interpretation
thereof became present to his bewildered mind.
The fact was that on that fateful journey when Achille's troubles
began he had committed an act of unfaithfulness to Ids wife. A
gloomy anxiety to conceal this action prompted him to an increasing
taciturnity, and morbid fancies as to his health grew on him until at
last his day-dream led him to imagine himself as actually dead. " His
two days' lethargy was but an episode, a chapter in the long dream."
What then was the natural next stage of the dream's development ?
"He dreamt that, now that he was dead indeed, the devil rose from the
abyss and came to take him. The poor man, as in his somnambulic state
292 F. W. H. Myers. [Supplement.
he retraced the series of his dreams, remembered the precise instant
when this lamentable event took place. It was about 1 1 a.m. ;—a dog
barked in the court at the moment, incommoded, no doubt, by the smell
of brimstone ;—flames filled the room ;—numbers of little fiends scourged
the unhappy man, or drove nails into his eyes,—and through the wounds
in his body Satan entered in to take possession of head and heart."
From this point the pseudo-possession may be said to have begun.
The fixed idea developed itself into sensory and motor automatisms ;—
visions of devils, uncontrollable utterances, automatic script—ascribed
by the automatist to the possessing devil within.
And now came the moment when the veracity, the utility, of this
new type of psychological analysis was to be submitted to yet another
test. From the point of view of the ordinary physician Achille's
condition was almost hopeless. Physical treatment had failed, and
death from exhaustion and misery seemed near at hand. Nor could
any appeal have been effective which did not go to the hidden root
of the evil ;—which did not lighten the load of morbid remorse
from which the whole series of troubles had developed. Fortunately
for Achille, he was in the hands of an unsurpassed minister to minds
thus diseased. Professor Janet adopted his usual tactics ;—what
he terms the dissociation and the gradual substitution of ideas. The
incidents of the miserable memory were modified, were explained away,
were slowly dissolved from the brooding brain ;—and the hallucinatory
image of the offended wife was presented to the sufferer at what
novelists call the psychological moment,—with pardon in her eyes.
" Such stuff as dreams are made of ! "—but even by such means was
Achille restored to physical and moral health ; he leads now the life of
normal man ; he no longer "walketh in a vain shadow, and disquieteth
himself in vain."
The title of " pseudo-possession " which I have given to this review
is partly justified by the case just described. Yet, as we shall presently
see, this is not the form of pseudo-possession which is most difficult to
understand and classify.
In Achille's case we have nothing but disease and delusion ; we
shall presently find it harder to explain phenomena one stage higher,
where the submerged mental action is complex and in no way hurtful ;
—yet cannot be interpreted as evidencing an external control.
I will conclude my notice of Dr. Janet's book by touching on a
cognate problem of which again only the early stages have come under
his observation ;—but where the relation of each stage to the stage above
it is as yet inextricably obscure. I speak of ecstasy;—of all that range
of sensations which present themselves as a temporary "standing-forth"
from the body, with more or less conscious or definite communion
with or entry into a spiritual world.
v»rt xxxviii.] Pseudo-Possession. 393
This phenomenon, alleged in many centuries and many nations, has
usually been explained in one of two ways ;—neither of which seems to
me satisfactory.
a. In the first place, it has been connected by theological writers
with the dogmas of the special religion in which they believed ;—and
which their ecstatic visions are assumed to corroborate. As an example
of such treatment I may allude to the recently published Bampton
Lectures by Dr. Inge on Christian Mysticism, which have justly
attracted admiration from their tone, alike scholarly and devout. Un
fortunately, however, these qualities are not sufficient for the task of
showing that there is any real connection between the ecstasies into
which Pagans and Buddhists just as much as Roman Catholics or
Protestants have fallen and the dogmas or traditions of any one of the
great sections of the Christian Church. The impression which a reader
familiar with the operation of self-suggestion is likely to carry away
. from Dr. Inge's book is rather of wonder that there is not a stronger
case for such connection ;—that self-suggestion has not given a more
decided flavour of Christian dogma to the very vague,—though often
deeply genuine,—accounts of ecstatic experiences which Dr. Inge has
been able to collect. I will not pursue a line of argument which it
would be invidious to press, and which will hardly meet with any
scientific opposition.
Rather I will turn to the other habitual type of explanation, —that
which explains away all ecstasy as a mere subjective symptom—a
hysterical experience which medical science should treat as it treats an
idee fixe or a recurrent contracture.
Here, I think, is just one of the points where the psychologist
should be on his guard against the physician. The psychologist, as I
have so often said, must remember that there are phenomena above
ordinary human nature as well as below it, and that if anywhere we
can trace an ascending series of vital phenomena, it is very unlikely
that we are ourselves standing at that series' superior limit.
There is undoubtedly a lower limit to what I may term the ecstatic
series ;—a rudimentary or hysterical ecstasy which seems to be nothing
more than a mere blankness and vacancy. First above that perhaps
we may place two cases which Dr. Janet briefly mentions ;—adding (I
am glad to see) a hint that he may return to the subject later.
The first of these cases is that of a girl, " Celestine," who is a
definitely hysterical subject. (Vol. I., p. 302-3). After an attack of
hysterical anger she remains absolutely motionless on her bed, arms
and legs stretched out, fists closed, and teeth clenched.
"This condition, which may be prolonged for two or three days
if not interfered with, is psychologically very remarkable. The
patient, entirely insensible to all external stimuli, retains a certain
39-t F. W. H. Myers. [Supplemeni.
consciousness ; she has complex dreams, which she has forgotten on
waking, but of which she recovers memory in hypnotic trance. These
varied dreams are specially characterised by a feeling of well-being,
of beatitude ; the patient feels no link with earth, is unconscious of
her body, and seems to float in air. I have noticed the same feeling of
beatitude in another patient, who loses the possibility of motion and
the consciousness of her body. One wonders whether there is any
relation between the two phenomena."
The next case of ecstasy (Vol. I., p. 95) carries us one step higher,
and occurs in a woman who is intelligent and not anaesthetic, but who
presents certain symptoms classed by Drs. Raymond and Janet as
hysterical—especially stigmatisation—or the mark as of a wound
imitating Christ's Passion, which used to rank as a sign of sanctity.
This xtupnatise'es wound is on the foot,—in imitation of the mark of
the nail. Her ecstasies are of the accustomed saintly type ;—and the
following accidental test of her condition during ecstasy forms an
incident probably unique in the long history of stigmatises from
S. Francis to Louise Lateau.
Dr. Janet was collecting series of reaction-times from various
subjects ;—testing, that is to say, the quickness and regularity with
which they could make a motor response (as pressing a button, etc.)
to some irregularly recurring stimulus, of touch, sound or sight. Of
course the quicker and more regular the response, the more highly does
the experimenter rank the attention and capacity of the subject.
"This subject," says Dr. Janet, "was very docile, and tried to fix her
attention on the sound of the signal and on nothing else. But after
about a quarter of an hour, I perceived that an unforeseen incident
seemed likely to disturb the experiment. Vk. began an attack of
ecstasy. Her eyes half closed, her head sank backward, and her face
assumed an expression of beatitude. . . . Little by little her body
rose on tiptoe, the left arm took a horizontal position, and she placed
herself in the attitude of crucifixion which is common in her ecstasies.
I was struck by observing that her right arm did not raise itself as
much as usual, for the top of the forefinger continued to touch the
button used in the experiment (iuterritptenr). Thus, in spite of the
complete ecstasy, the tracing continues to be produced. I prolonged
this singular experience of taking reaction-times during a religious
ecstasy for two hours and a-half. Hhe then awoke, but with a remark
able fidelity to her promise, she continued to reply to the signals during
and after her process of awakening, so that I was able to get a graphic
reaction-curve taken before, during, and after the ecstasy."
Omitting details, I may say that the graphic response was quickest
and most regular during the height of the ecstasy;—in spite of attempts
made by Dr. Janet to disturb the subject by sudden noises, pinching,
Part xxxviii.] Pseudo-Possession. 395
etc.,—attempts which had no effect at all in distracting her from her
duty, although she must have felt them, since she retains her power of
sensation in the trance.
The general lesson which Dr. Janet draws from this and other
experiments is that the more automatically you can get the reaction
performed the better it is performed ;—in short that subliminal attention
is more trustworthy than supraliminal. On the present case he adds the
following reflections :—
" Is it likely that Vk., during the crisis of ecstasy, when she raises
to heaven a face of beatitude—when she takes the position of cruci
fixion,—is bestowing on my signals a closer attention than at the
moment when she is quietly sitting in an armchair with nothing to
do but to listen ?
" Moreover, she does partially remember her ecstasies, and she tells
us of the unspeakable joys which she has been experiencing. While
she was responding to my signals she felt herself flooded by religious
emotion. ' I felt an ineffable sweetness on my lips ; presently they
closed ; a torpor stole over my limbs, but the torpor was full of sweet
ness.' Then in complete ecstasy : ' I saw the Holy Sacrament in a
light, a radiance, a glory inexpressible, and I was filled with unspeak
able gladness. A voice within me made me understand that by the
act of communion I carried Jesus within me as though I were a living
monstrance.'
" But I will not here discuss (continues Dr. Janet) the ecstasies of
this patient ; the phenomenon is too striking to be treated thus inci
dentally. I merely remark that during this ecstasy she made a long
meditation, not without philosophical and poetical value, on the union
of the soul with God. I observe also that she remembered this reflec
tion, and remembered also the noises which I made in the room, and my
pinches on her arm. When I asked her as to the special point of her
attention to my signals and her own answering movements, she
answered, ' I believe that I kept my hand on the machine, as you told
me, but God must have guided my hand to obey your orders, for I was
not myself able to pay them any attention.' "
I must now reluctantly leave Dr. Janet's book ;—observing only
that in the midst of this record of multiform disintegrations and con
tortions of personality we have here come, nevertheless, upon certain
signs of increased faculty,—of subliminal steadiness of muscular
action under difficulties,—of ecstatic happiness, and even of intel
lectual exaltation.
The book to which I now turn has for readers of our Proceedings
an even directer interest. It happens, no doubt, to any group which
pursues for many years a somewhat unfamiliar line of inquiry that
396 F. W. H. -Myers. [Supplement.
those of their points which are first assailed get gradually admitted,
so that as they become interested in new points they may scarcely
observe what change has taken place in the reception of the old. The
reader of early volumes of our Proceedings will often observe this kind
of progress of opinion. And now Professor Flournoy's book indicates
in a remarkable way how things have moved in the psychology of the
last twenty years. The book,—a model of fairness throughout,—is
indeed, for the most part, critically destructive in its treatment of the
quasi-supernormal phenomena with which it deals. But what a mass
of conceptions a competent psychologist now takes for granted in this
realm, which the official science of twenty years ago would scarcely
stomach our hinting at !
One important point may be noticed at once as decisively corrobor
ating a contention of my own made long ago, and at a time when it
probably seemed fantastic to many readers. Arguing for the potential
continuity of subliminal mentation (as against those who urged that
there were only occasional flashes of submerged thought, like scattered
dreams) I said that it would sewn be found needful to press this notion
of a continuous subliminal self to the utmost, if we were not prepared
to admit a continuous spiritual guidance or possession. Now, in fact,
with Professor Flournoy's subject the whole discussion turns on this
very point. There is unquestionably a continuous and complex series
of thoughts and feelings going on beneath the threshold of con
sciousness of M"e "HeUene Smith." Is this submerged mentation due
in any degree or in any manner to the operation of spirits other than
M"e Smith's own 1 That is the broad question ; but it is complicated
here by a subsidiary question ;—whether, namely, any previous incar
nations of Ml!e Smith's,—other phases of her own spiritual history,
now involving complex relationship with the past,—have any part in
the crowd of personalities which seem struggling to express themselves
through her quite healthy organism.
Mlle Smith, I should at once say, is not, and never has been, a
paid medium. She occupies a leading post on the staff of a large
maixon de commerc? at Geneva, and gives seances to her friends, simply
because she enjoys the exercise of her mediumistic faculties, and is
herself interested in their explanation.
Her organism, I repeat, is regarded, both by herself and by others,
as a quite healthy one. Mlle Smith, says Professor Flournoy, declares
distinctly that she is perfectly sound in body and mind, in no way
lacking in equilibrium, and indignantly repudiates the idea that
there is any hurtful anomaly or the slightest danger in mediumship
as she practises it.
" I am so far from being abnormal," she writes, " that I have never
been so clear-sighted, so lucid, so capable of judging rapidly on all points,
Part xxxviii] Pseudo-Possession. 397
as since I have been developed as a medium." No one appears to
dispute this estimate, which the facts of Mlle Smith's progress in her
line of business distinctly confirm.
" It is in fact incontestable " (continues Professor Flournoy) " that
Helene has a head extremely well organised ; and that from a business
point of view she manages admirably the very important and com
plicated department of which she is at the head in this large shop
where she is employed ;—so that to accuse her of being morbid simply
because she is a medium is to say the least an inadmissible petitio
principii so long as the very nature of mediumship remains a thing so
obscure and open to discussion as is still the case. . . .
" It is clear that there exist amid the ranks of the learned faculty
certain spirits narrow and limited, strong in their own specialities, but
ready to cast their anathemas at whatever does not fit in with their
preconceived ideas, and to treat as morbid, pathological, insane, every
thing which differs from the normal type of human nature, such as they
have conceived it on the model of their own small personalities. . . .
" But in the first place the essential criterion in judging of a human
being's value is not the question whether he is in good or bad health,
like or unlike other people, but whether he fulfils adequately his special
task,—how he acquits himself of the functions incumbent on him, and
what may be expected or hoped from him. I am not aware that Miss
Smith's psychical faculties have ever interfered with her accom
plishment of any of her duties ;—rather they have helped her therein ;
for her normal and conscious activity has often found an Unexpected
assistance,—which non-mediums lack !—in her subliminal inspirations
and her automatisms, which effect a useful end.
" In the second place, it is far from being demonstrated that medium-
ship is a pathological phenomenon. It is abnormal, no doubt, in the
sense of being rare, exceptional ;—but rarity is not morbidity. The
few years during which these phenomena have been seriously and
scientifically studied have not been enough to allow us to pronounce
on their true nature. It is interesting to note that in the countries
where these studies have been pushed the furthest, in England and
America, the dominant view among the savants who have gone deepest
into the matter is not at all unfavourable to mediumship ; and that, far
from regarding it as a special case of hysteria, they see in it a faculty
superior, advantageous, healthy, of which hysteria is a form of
degenerescence, a pathological parody, a morbid caricature."
The phenomena which this sensitive (Helene Smith is Professor
Flournoy's pseudonym for her) presents cover a range which looks at
first very wide, although a clearer analysis shows that these varieties
are more apparent than real and that self-suggestion will perhaps
account for all of them.
398 F. W. H. MyeT8. [Supplement.
There is, to begin with, every kind of automatic irruption of
subliminal into supraliminal life. As Professor Kournoy says (p. 45) :—•
"Phenomena of hypermnesia, divinations, myst r ious findings of lost
objects, happy inspirations, exact presentiments, just intuitions, teleo-
logical (purposive or helpful) automatisms, in short, of every kind:—
she possesses in a high degree this small change of genius ;—which
constitutes a more than sufficient compensation for the inconvenience
resulting from those distractions and moments of absence of mind
which accompany her visions ;—and which, moreover, generally pass
unobserved."
And here I reach an appropriate point at which to remark that
this book of Professor Flournoy's is not the first account which has
been published of Mlle Helene. Professor Lemaitre, of Geneva, printed
two papers about her in the Annales des Sciences Psychiques ;—first, a
long article in the number for March-April, 1897,—then a reply to
M. Lefebure in the number for May-June, 1897. In these papers he
distinctly claims supernormal powers for M1Ie Helene,—implying a
belief in her genuine possession by spirits, and even in her previous
incarnations, and in the reality of the extra-terrene or ostensibly
Martian language. I read these papers at the time, but put them
aside as inconclusive, mainly because that very language, on which
M. Lemaitre seemed most to rely, seemed to me so obviously factitious
as to throw doubt on all the evidence presented by an observer who
could believe that denizens of another planet talked to each other
in a language corresponding in every particular with simple French
idioms, and including such words as quisa for quel, quise' for quelle,
ve'teche for voir, veche for vu ;—the fantastic locutions of the nursery.
M. Lemaitre remarks, as a proof of the consistency and reality of the
extra-terrene tongue, " L'un des premiers mots que nous ayons eus,
me'tiche,, signifiant monsieur, se retrouve plus tard avec le sens de
/uimme." That is to say, having transmogrified monsisur into me'tiche,
Helene further transmutes les messieurs into ce'e me'tiche ;—in naive
imitation of ordinary French usage. And this tongue is supposed to
have sprung up independently of all the influences which have shaped
terrene grammar in general or the French idiom in particular ' And
even after Professor Flournoy's analysis of this absurdity I see
newspapers speaking of this Martian language as an impressive
phenomenon !
Very possibly the same critics might object, say, to the utterances
of the Thaw children through Mrs. Piper (S.P.R. Proceedings, Part
XXXIV.) as too trivial and childish for a spiritual world. Yet surely
it should hardly be needful to say that on the principle of continuity a
child passing from earth into that world will still be occupied with
childish things ;—while, on the other hand, the evolution of another
Part xxxvm.] Pseudo-Possession. 399
planet, if it has culminated in conscious life at all, can hardly have
culminated in a conscious life into which we could all of us enter
affably, with a suitable Ollendorff's phrase-book under our arms ;—
" eni cf'e me'tiche one (jude","—"ici lea hommes (messieurs) sont bons,"—•
" here the men are good " ;—and the rest of it.
Yet I am bound in fairness to say that, judging M. Lemaitre too
sweepingly from this linguistic standpoint, I assumed that one remark
able incident which he quotes could probably be explained away ;—
whereas Professor Flournoy has not really explained it away at all.
This is the case of Jean le Carrieur. Stated briefly, it is admitted that
Helene, after experiencing a hallucinatory smell of sulphur (charac
teristic of a quarryman's work), had a vision of a man working, never
known to her, who sent a message to a Mme Mirbel, not present at the
seance. This man, and the scene in which he appeared, were clearly
recognised by Mrae Mirbel as belonging to her childish memories ;—
while it is most improbable that the little incidents in question should
ever have reached HeMene's ears. Mme Mirbel had, however, been
present at some of Helene's seances, and Professor Flournoy thinks
that on one of these occasions the subliminal self of Helene had drawn
these memories telepathically from Mme Mirbol's mind. This kind of
possibility, of course, has always to be faced. Its relative probability,
as compared with spirit-influence, has to be inferred in each case from
a wide group of experiences. But whatever the solution which we
adopt for this incident of the quarryman, it must, I think, go some
way towards proving Mlle Helene's supernormal gifts.
At seances, —where the deeper change has no inconveniences,—
Helene undergoes a sort of self-hypnotisation which produces various
lethargic and somnambulistic states. And when she is alone and safe
from interruption she has spontaneous visions, during which there may
he some approach to ecstasy. At the s&inces she experiences positive
hallucinations, and also negative hallucinations, or systematised
anwsthesiae, so that, for instance, she will cease to see some person
present, especially one who is to be the recipient of messages in the
course of the seance. " It seems as though a dream-like incoherence
presided over this preliminary work of disaggregation, in which the
normal perceptions are arbitrarily split up or absorbed by the sub
conscious personality,—eager for materials with which to compose the
hallucinations 'which it is preparing." Then, when the s&mee begins,
the main actor is Hellene's guide Leopold (a pseudonym for Cagliostro)
who speaks and writes through her, and is, in fact, either her leading
spirit-control or (much more probably) her most developed form of
secondary personality.
Helfene, indeed, has sometimes the impression of becoming Leopold
for a moment (p. 117). Professor Flournoy compares this sensation with
400 F. W. H. Myers. (Supplement.
the experience of Mr. Hill Tout (S.P.R. Proceedings, Vol. XL,
p. 309), who feels himself becoming his own father, who is manifesting
through him. It should be added that, although somewhat pompous,
Leopold always appears both sensible and dignified. "Leopold," saya
Professor Flournoy (p. 134) "certainly manifests a very honourable
and amiable side of Mlle Smith's character, and in taking him as her
' guide ' she has followed inspirations which are doubtless among the
highest in her nature."
The high moral quality of these automatic communications, on which
Professor Flournoy thus insists, is a phenomenon worth consideration.
I do not mean that it is specially strange in the case of Mlle Smith.
She appears to be (if the phrase is thought permissible in describing
a medium) a person of remarkably well-regulated mind. One is not
surprised that her subliminal self should be as blameless as her supra
liminal. But in reality the remark here made by Professor Flournoy
has a much wider application. The almost universally high moral
tone of genuinely automatic utterances,—whether claimed as spirit
communications or proceeding obviously from the automatist himself,—,
has not, I think, been sufficiently noticed, or adequately explained. I
will mention two points which have struck me as specially noticeable.
In the first place I have read many pulpit and other attacks on
" spiritualism," under which name all automatic utterance is commonly
included, and I cannot remember any instance in which such an
attack has been made effective by the quotation of passages of immoral
tendency—base, cruel, or impure. The attack, so far as I know, has
always been of a kind which, in the eye of the philosopher, is rather
complimentary to the writings attacked. For it seems (and this is the
second point to which I wished to call attention here) that no one of
the various conflicting Churches has been able to claim the general
drift of automatic messages as making for its special tenets. The
various controversialists, where they have been candid, have admitted
moral elevation, but,—from their various opposing points of view,—
have agreed in deploring theological laxity.
I must indeed confess myself unable to explain why it is that
beneath the frequent incoherence, frequent commonplaceness, frequent
pomposity of these messages there should almost always be a substratum
of better sense, of truer catholicity, than is usually to be heard except
from the leading minds of the generation. It is possible that in some
hidden way the Zeit-Geist affects the subliminal strata even of persons
superficially narrow and bigoted by an influence urging them all in
somewhat the same direction ;—so that the best available thought of the
age is inspiring the age more profoundly than we know. And it is
possible also that these utterances may bear in reality some obscure
relation to truths profounder than we have as yet normally acquired.
Part xxxviii.] Pseudo Possession. 401
What is omitted, indeed, from current beliefs is as significant as what
is added thereto, and the general product looks more like a very poor
account of something which in itself is great and new, but dimly
apprehended, than like a compromise between conflicting dogmas, or a
selection from familiar hortatory themes.
Thus much I think it was fair to say ;—or I may speak more strongly
and maintain that thus much it was a positive duty to insist upon. It
is only right that this mass of communications, taken as a whole, should
be defended from the random accusations of journalist or pulpiteer.
Yet, in view of what is here to follow, I must lose no time in defining
the limited extent to which my support of automatic messages goes.
I think, then, that in evidential messages,—where there is real reason
to believe that an identified spirit is communicating,—there is a marked
and independent consensus on such matters as these spirits profess
themselves able to discuss. And, again, in non-evidential messages,—
in communications which probably proceed from the automatist's
subliminal self,—I hold that there is a remarkable and undesigned con
cordance in high moral tone, and also in avoidance of certain prevalent
tenets, which many of the automatists do supraliminally hold as true.
But I also insist that these subliminal messages, even when not inco
herent, are generally dream-like, and often involve tenets which
(though never in my experience base or immoral) are unsupported by
evidence, and are probably to be referred to mere self-suggestion.
Prominent among such tenets is one which forms a large part of
M,le Smith's communications ; namely, the doctrine of reincarnation,
or of successive lives spent by each soul upon this planet.
The simple fact that such was probably the opinion both of Plato and
of Virgil shows that there is nothing here which is alien to the best
reason or to the highest instincts of men. Nor, indeed, is it easy to
realise any theory of the direct creation of spirits at such different
stages of advancement as those which enter upon the earth in the guise
of mortal man. There must, one feels, be some kind of continuity,—
some form of spiritual Past. Yet for reincarnation there is at present
no valid evidence ; and it must be my duty to show how its assertion
in any given instance,—M"e Smith's included,—constitutes in itself a
strong argument in favour of self-suggestion rather than extraneous
inspiration as the source of the messages in which it appears.
Whenever civilised men have received what they have regarded as
a revelation (which has generally been somewhat fragmentary in its
first delivery) they have naturally endeavoured to complete and
systematise it as well as they could. In so doing they have mostly
aimed at three objects; (1) to understand as much as possible of the
secrets of the universe ; (2) to justify as far as possible Heaven's deal
ings with men ; and (3) to appropriate as far as possible the favour or
2 F
402 F. W. H. Myers. (Supplement.
benefit which the revelation may show as possibly accruing to believers.
For all these purposes the doctrine of reincarnation has proved useful
in many countries and times. But in no case could it seem more appro
priate than in this last revelation (so to term it) through automatic
messages and the like. And as a matter of history, a certain vigorous
preacher of the new faith, known under the name of Allan Kardec,
took up reincarnationist tenets, enforced them (as there is reason to
believe) by strong suggestion upon the minds of various automatic
writers, and set them forth in dogmatic works which have had much
influence, especially among Latin nations, from their clarity, symmetry,
and intrinsic reasonableness. Yet the data thus collected were
absolutely insufficient, and the Livre des Esprits must simply rank
as the premature formulation of a new religion,—the premature
systematisation of a nascent science.
I follow Professor Flournoy in believing that the teaching of that
work must have directly or indirectly influenced the mind of M"e
Smith,—and is therefore responsible for her claim to these incarnations
previous to that which she now undergoes or enjoys.
On the general scheme here followed, each incarnation, if the last
has been used aright, ought to represent some advance in the scale of
being. If one earth-life has been misused, the next earth-life ought to
afford opportunity for expiation,—or for further practice in the special
virtue which has been imperfectly acquired. Thus Mlle Smith's present
life in a humble position may be thought to atone for her overmuch
pride in her last incarnation,—as Marie Antoinette.
But the mention of Marie Antoinette suggests the risk which this
theory fosters,—of assuming that one is the issue of a distinguished
line of spiritual progenitors ;—insomuch that, with whatever temporary
sets-back, one is sure in the end to find oneself in a leading position.
Pythagoras, indeed, was content with the secondary hero
Euphorbus as his bygone self. But in our days Dr. Anna Kingsford
and Mr. Edward Maitland must needs have been the Virgin Mary and
S. John the Divine. And Victor Hugo, who was naturally well to
the front in these self-multiplications, took possession of most of the
leading personages of antiquity whom he could manage to string
together in chronological sequence. It is obvious that any number of
re-born souls can play at this game ;—but where no one adduces any
evidence it seems hardly worth while to go on. Even Pythagoras
does not appear to have adduced any evidence beyond his ipse
dixit for his assertion that the alleged shield of Euphorbus had in
reality been borne by that mythical hero. Meantime the question as
to reincarnation has actually been put to a very few spirits who have
given some real evidence of their identity. So far as I know, no
one of these has claimed to know anything personally of such an
Part xxxviii.] Pseiulo-Possession. 403
incident ;—although all have united in saying that their knowledge
was too limited to allow them to generalise on the matter.
Helene's previous incarnations,—to return to our subject,—do
perhaps suffer from the general fault of aiming too high. She has to
her credit a pre-incarnation in the planet Mars ;—another as an Indian
Princess ; and a third (as I have said) as Marie Antoinette.
In each case there arc certain impressive features in the impersona
tion ; but in each case also careful analysis negatives the idea that we
can be dealing with a personality really revived from a former epoch,
or from a distant planet ;—and leaves us inclined to explain everything
by "cryptomnesia" (as Professor Flournoy calls submerged memory), and
that subliminal inventiveness of which we already know so much.
The Martian pre-incarnation was naturally the most striking at
first sight. Its reality was supported by a Martian language, written
in a Martian alphabet, spoken with fluency, and sufficiently interpreted
into French to show that such part of it, at any rate, as could be com
mitted to writing was actually a grammatical and coherent form of
speech.
This to the ordinary reader sounds like good evidence. To the
student of automatisms, on the other hand, as I have already said, it
irresistibly suggests the automatist's own subliminal handiwork. It
is a case of "glossolaly," or "speaking with tongues" ; and we have no
modern case—no case later than the half-mythical Miracles of the
Cevennes—where such utterance has proved to be other than gibberish.
I have had various automatic hieroglyphics shown to me, with the
suggestion that they may be cursive Japanese, or perhaps an old dialect
of Northern China ;—but I confess that I have grown tired of showing
these fragments to the irresponsive expert, who suggests that they may
also be vague reminiscences of the scrolls in an Oriental tea-tray.
It seems indeed to be a most difficult thing to get telepathically
into any brain even fragments of a language which it has not learnt.
A few simple Italian, and even Hawaian, words occur in Mrs. Piper's
utterances, coming apparently from departed spirits, but these, with
some Dutch words recently given through another sensitive, form, I
think, the only instances which I know. And, speaking generally,
whatever is elaborate, finished, pretentious, is likely to be of subliminal
facture ; while only things scrappy, perplexed and tentative have
floated to us veritably from afar.
Analysis of the so-called Martian language proves it to be no excep
tion to this rule. It is, in fact, a childish, though elaborate, imitation
of French ;—whose true parallel lies in those languages of the nursery
which little brothers and sisters sometimes invent—as a tongue not
understanded of their elders. The outbursts of this Martian speech
are noticeable as a parallel to the "deific verbiage," which used to
404 F. W. H. Myera. [Supplement.
throng through the lips of Mr. le Baron (Proceedings, Vol. XII., p. 277),
and for a long time impressed itself upon him as having some reality
in it somewhere.
The most interesting peculiarity, indeed, in the Martian tongue is
its exclusively French formation ;—which would seem to argue its elabo
ration in a mind familiar with French alone. Now Mlle Smith, —who,
by the w'ay, is no linguist,—had some German lessons in her girlhood,
and one is thus led to the curious supposition that the Martian tongue
was invented by some element in her personality which preceded the
German lessons.
I fancy that I have mentioned somewhere, but I may perhaps recall
here, a trivial experience of my own illustrative of this ingenious
hypothesis of Professor Flournoy's. I once dreamt that I saw an
epitaph in Greek hexameters inscribed on a wall,—of which on waking
I remembered only one line—•
Avrap 6 p(V Kara yqv dakcphv KVtre baKViiptvov nvp.
I could not construe this line, which is, in fact, nonsense :—till I
remembered in a sudden flash a certain sense of shame felt by me as a
small boy at having thought that Koto meant under, —as though (ierra yr)v
were yrjs Kuto>-
The line, then, had a meaning : " But he, indeed, beneath the
earth, embraced the strong consuming flame ;"—not a well-chosen
sentiment for an epitaph, perhaps, but yet up to the ordinary level of
one's dreaming self. There must, then, have been some fragment of me
yet surviving from innocent boyhood, and blundering subliminally in
the same old style.
This fact of the different age of M"e Smith's life to which
her hypnoidal elucubrations in this aspect belong seems to me to
constitute one of the most interesting psychological points in her
mediumship. It tends to show that her secondary personalities are
probably in their origin—as has sometimes l)een suggested—phenomena
partly of reversion in the ordinary personality,—survivals or momentary
returns of inferior phases, overpassed for a longer or shorter time, and
which should normally have been absorbed in the development of the
individual instead of appearing externally in strange proliferations.
Just as teratology illustrates embryology, which in return explains
teratology, and as both of these unite in throwing light on anatomv,
similarly one may hope that the study of the facts of mediumship may
some day help to furnish us with some just and fruitful view of normal
psvchogenesis,—which in return will enable us better to comprehend
the appearance of these singular phenomena ;—so that psychology in
general may thence acquire a better and exacter conception of human
personality.
Part xxxviii.) Pseudo-Possession. 405
The faculty here touched upon—the strong reviviscence of long-past
emotional states—seems to me eminently characteristic, at any rate, of
artistic and poetical genius.
The artist must needs desire to have his whole life to draw upon.
He must often wish to live in the past more vividly than in the present,
and to feel again what he has felt, even more than to see again what he
has seen. Visual and auditory memories, pushed to absolute vividness,
become hallucinations of vision or audition ; and this point of absolute
hallucination few artists are able or even desire to reach. But
emotional or affective memory may for some gifted natures be pushed
on to all its old actual vividness with pure gain to art ;—nay, if the man
himself has grown more capable of feeling, then the revived emotion
(like certain optical memory-images) may even go beyond the original.
Thus Sully Prudhomme says, in speaking of a hidden insurgent
memory of this type : " C'est meme cette reviviscence qui seule me
permettrait de retoucher les vers que cette petite aventure, si ancienne,
m'a fait commettre, et de faire beneficierde l'experience que j'ai acquise
dans mon art l'expression de mes sentiments d'autrefois." And he asks
whether every memory of feeling does not assume a certain character of
hallucination. Wordsworth (as Aubrey de Vere has told us, and as the
sonnet "Surprised by joy," shows) had very much the same experience.
And Littre (Revue Positive, 1877, p. 660) describes what he calls the
" affective automnesia,"—or spontaneously arising flow of emotion with
which quite suddenly, and late in life, he remembered losing a young
sister when he was ten years old : " Ce meme evenement s'est reproduite
avec une peine non moindre, certes, que celle que j'éprouvais au moment
meme, et qui aila jusqu'a mouiller mes yeux de larmes."1
This train of reflections, I think, well illustrates that kinship
between the working of what is admitted as genius and the dreamlike
subliminal mentation with which we are here dealing, of which I have
often spoken, and to which I must again presently recur.
Turning now to the Hindoo pre-incarnation, we observe that it
offers a linguistic problem of a rather different kind. Certain Sanscrit
letters are written, and certain Sanscrit words are uttered ;—mixed, it
is true, with much quasi-Sanscrit gibberish, and not exceeding what a
quick eve and memory might pick up in a few hours from a Sanscrit
grammar. Helene, however,—whose complete good faith is vouched
for on all sides, and who herself undoubtedly believes with her whole
heart in the spirit-hypothesis,—-denies that she ever consulted or even
to her knowledge saw, a Sanscrit grammar. Again, M. Flournoy's
careful researches have shown that incidents of the Indian history, or
pseudo-history, on which the narrative of this incarnation turns, are
1 See Ribot, P«i/chologie des Sentiments, p. 152.
406 F. W. H. Myers. [Supplement.
undoubtedly derived from a particular passage in a rare and antiquated
history of India by de Marlfes,—which M"e Smith asserts that she
never saw, and which it seems very improbable that she should have
seen. This knowledge is worked up in a way indicating considerable
familiarity with the East, and quasi-Indian tunes and gestures are
employed with great verisimilitude.
I need not here go into the details of the more modern and
accessible characterisation of Marie Antoinette.
In the facts which I have already given, we have got this problem
reduced to its narrowest form ; and I shall set forth, as barely possible,
;i theory which Professor Flournoy has not invoked. I agree with him
that the notion of the truth of the Indian romance must be quite
dismissed. But I do not therefore think it certain that MUe Smith must
have unconsciously seen de Maries' history and a Sanscrit grammar.
On the contrary, I think it just possible that the knowledge of
de Maries and of Sanscrit may have been clairvoyantly acquired by
Mlle Smith's subliminal self,—-or even may have been communicated
to that subliminal self by a spirit which may have been concerned in
the composition of these romances. I should defend this apparent
absurdity somewhat as follows :—
If spirits do act upon human minds, they probably so act sometimes
to amuse themselves, as well as to please or inform us. I know of no
evidence, indeed, of their having any power to injure us, but I think that
there is a good deal of evidence of tricky, playful interference. I think
that a kind of literary impulse to write or act out romances, through
the intermediacy of some human being, is perhaps one form of this
mystifying intervention. I think that traces of such a phenomenon
occur in the psychical history, for instance, of Mr. Stainton Moses, and
of a lady quoted in these Proceedings as Miss A. The possibility
can hardly be tested ;—but should, I think, be noticed here.
I pass on from these reincarnational romances to certain minor, but
interesting phenomena, which Professor Flournoy calls teleological
automatisms. These are small acts of helpfulness—beneficent sywrgies,
as we might term them, in contrast with the injurious synergies, or
combined groups of hurtful actions, with which hysteria has made us
familiar. We have already printed several incidents of this type in our
Proceedings and Journal. (See, for instance, the trivial but instructive
case of Mrs. Verrall and the envelopes, Proceedings, Vol. XI., p. 191.)
"One day," says Professor Flournoy (p. 35), "Miss Smith, when
desiring to lift down a large and heavy object which lay on a high
shelf, was prevented from doing so because her raised arm remained
for some seconds as though petrified in the air and incapable of move
ment. She took this as a warning, and gave up the attempt. At a
subsequent seance Leopold stated that it was he who had thus fixed
Part xxxviii.i Pseudo-Possession. 407
Helene's arm to prevent her from grasping this object, which was much
too heavy for her, and would have caused her some accident.
" Another time, a shopman, who had been looking in vain for a
certain pattern, asked Helene if by chance she knew what had become
of it. Helene answered mechanically and without reflection—' Yes, it
has been sent to M. J.' (a client of the house). At the same time she
saw before her the number 18 in large black figures a few feet from the
ground, and added instinctively, ' It was sent eighteen days ago.'
[This was in the highest degree improbable, but was found to be
absolutely correct.] Leopold had no recollection of this, and does not
seem to have been the author of this cryptomnesic automatism."
A similar phenomenon has also been noted (p. 87) when warning is
conveyed by an actual phantasmal figure.
Mlle Smith has seen an apparition of Leopold, barring a particular
road, under circumstances which make it probable that M"e Smith
would on that day have had cause to regret taking that route. (Cf.
Apparition seen by lady near open lift ; and warnings to Socrates to
change his route. Proceedings, Vol. VIII., p. 345, and Vol. V., pp.
540-542.)
The next question is as to whether supernormal faculty of any
kind is manifested in Helene's phenomena. There does appear to be
some telepathy (see p. 363, etc.), and of telepathy Professor Flournoy
speaks as follows :—
" One may almost say that, if telepathy did not exist, it would be
necessary to invent it. I mean by this that a direct action between
living beings, independently of the organs of sense, is a thing so in
accord with all that we know of nature that it would be difficult not
to assume its existence a priori, even were no sign of it perceptible.
How could one believe, indeed, that centres of chemical phenomena
so complex as the nervous centres could find themselves in activity
without transmitting various undulations,—X, Y, or Z rays,—passing
through the skull as the sun passes through glass, and going on to act,
at any distance, on their homologues in other skulls ? It is a mere
question of intensity.
il If telepathy is considered strange, mystic, occult, supernormal,
etc., it is because this character has been gratuitously conferred on
it by making of this imponderable link between organisms a purely
spiritual communication of soul to soul, independent of matter and of
space. That such a metaphysical union does exist I am ready to
believe, but it is to introduce a gratuitous confusion if one substitutes
this problem of high speculation,—which abandons the strictly scien
tific ground and sets aside the principle of psycho-physical parallelism,
—for the empirical problem of telepathy, which is perfectly concordant
with that parallelism and in no way contradicts established science."
408 F. "W. H. Myers. [Supplement,
Now, of course, it has been obvious from the outset of our re
searches that it would be very desirable if we could trace some relation
between telepathy and ether-vibrations. There are doubtless endless
vibrations waiting to be explained ;—and telepathy is a phenomenon
greatly in need of an explanation. The more complex any object is,
moreover, the more strangely it will vibrate ;—and the more sensitive
any object is, the more strangely will it receive and respond to
vibrations.
Nevertheless when we have said this,—as Sir W. Crookes has said it
with great impressiveness {Proceedings, Vol. XII., pp. 348-352),—we
have said nearly all that can be said for the vibration-theory of telepathy.
And yet the real difficulties of the subject are only beginning.
It is, of course, plain that if we are to get any true notion of telepathy
we must in some way generalise from our own petty experiments and
limited observations. No one supposes that the few emergent cases
which happen to have become accessible to our view comprise the
whole range of what must by its very nature be a great fundamental
law.
Now the generalisation which the vibration-theory calls on us to
make is as follows : Ether-vibrations are constantly emanating from
every human brain, and every human brain is capable of receiving such
vibrations and of representing them in consciousness.
These vibrations are assumed to radiate in all directions equally (as
all ether waves must do), and to be unaffected by earthly distances
or earthly objects ; but nevertheless only to become perceptible when
they impinge upon a brain which is fitted to receive them either by
emotional sympathy or by some natural sensitivity. Their action on
the percipient's brain is assumed to be instantaneous ;—although we
may allow some period of latency before they represent themselves in
his consciousness. Of course, the more this latency is insisted on, the
less plausible does the vibration-theory become.
Again, the vibration must represent itself to the percipients as a
pattern which must in some way resemble the pattern which emanated
from the agent. Thus, to recur to our early experiments with cards,
our old friend the two of diamonds is bound to be the two of diamonds
still ; or if it cannot come out as the two of diamonds exactly, it yet
ought to get as near it as it can, and to appear, say, as the two of hearts.
When the idea to be communicated becomes more complex,—and most
ideas are more complex than the two of diamonds,—we may fairly allow
a wider range of similitude. The vibration-pattern received is sup
posed to lx; modified by the recipient brain;—modified often out of any
pictorial, resemblance to any impression which we can suppose the
agent's brain to have despatched. The great extent of such apparent
modification, indeed, does not affect the vibration-theory alone, but any
Part xxxvm.] Pseudo-Possession. 409
theory of telepathic impact as opposed to excursive presence, or invasion
on the agent's part. Gurney repeatedly, in Phantasms of the Living,
discussed this topic, and especially that form of difficulty which lies in
the habitual appearance of the agent's person to the percipient ;—albeit
the agent, at a moment of death or crisis, is not likely to be thinking of
the aspect of his own body. Gurney argues, however, that a sense
of one's own aspect is deeply rooted in all our minds, and may
naturally be represented to others as a part of any message which
comes from our unconscious strata. But such a theory, difficult in
any case, has to be greatly strained if we are to suppose that a
pattern of brain-vibrations which for the agent represent, say, the
shock of the rupture of an aneurism, become for the percipient a
picture of a smiling gentleman dressed for walking, with great coat
and cane. (See Phantasms of the Living, Vol. I., p. 210, Case of
N.J. 8.)
A still greater difficulty for the vibration-theory is presented by
collective telepathic hallucinations. It is hard to understand how A
can emit a pattern of vibrations which, radiating equally in all direc
tions, shall affect not only his distant friend B, but also the strangers
C and D, who happen to be standing near B ;—and affect no other
persons, so far as we know, in the world.
The above points have been fair matter of argument almost since
our research began. • But as our evidence has developed, our conception
of telepathy has needed to be more and more generalised in other and
new directions,—still less compatible with the vibration-theory. Three
such directions may be briefly specified here ;—namely, the relation of
telepathy (a) to telnesthesia or clairvoyance, (/;) to•time, and (c) to dis
embodied spirits, (a) It is increasingly hard to refer all the scenes of
which percipients become aware to the action of any given mind which is
perceiving those distant scenes. This is especially noticeable in crystal-
gazing experiments, (b) And these crystal visions also show what, from
the strict telepathic point of view, we should call a great laxity of time
relations. The server chooses his own time to look in the ball ;—and
though sometimes he sees events which are taking place at the moment,
he may also see past events,—and even future events. I at least cannot
deny precognition, nor can I draw a definite line amid these complex
visions which may separate precognition from telepathy, (c) Precog
nition itself may be explained, if you will, as telepathy from dis-
emlxxlied spirits;—and this would at any rate bring it under a class of
phenomena which I think all students of our subjects must before long
admit. Admitting here, for argument's sake, that we do receive com
munications from the dead which we should term telepathic if we
received them from the living, it is of course open to us to conjecture
that these messages also are conveyed on ether-waves. But since those
410 F. W. H. Myers. [Supplement.
waves do not at any rate emanate from material brains, we shall by
this time have got so far from the original brain-wave hypothesis that
few will care still to defend it.
I doubt, indeed, whether we can safely say of telepathy anything
more definite than this : Life has the power of manifesting itself to life.
The laws of life, as we have thus far known them, have been only laws
of life when already associated with matter. Thus limited, we have
learnt little as to Life's true nature. We know not even whether Life
be only a directive Force, or, on the other hand, an effective Energy.
We know not in what way it operates on matter. We can in no way
define the connection between our own consciousness and our organisms.
Just here it is, I should say, that telepathic observations ought to
supply us with some hint. From the mode in which some element of
one individual life,—apart from material impact,—gets hold of another
organism, we may in time learn something of the way in which our
own life gets hold of our own organism,—and maintains, intermits, or
abandons its organic sway.
Most instructive of all will it be if we can obtain telepathy from
discarnate spirits,—and especially if we could get any glimpse of a rela
tion between their mode of being and the cosmic ether. On this point
Professor Flournoy writes as follows (p. 394) :—
" It is obvious that the hypothesis of spirits involves no d priori
impossibility or absurdity. It does not even contradict, as is sometimes
supposed, that fundamental law of physiological psychology—the
psychophysical parallelism—which insists that every mental phenomenon
must have a physical correlative. For in spite of our habit of con
sidering the molecular or atomic phenomena of the brain, the cata-
bolism of the neurones,—as the true concomitant of the conscious pro
cesses, it is quite possible—-it is even probable enough—that these
molecular movements do not constitute the ultimate physical term
immediately adjoining the mental world (cdtoyant le monde mental),
but that the true physical or spatial correlatives of psychological or
non-spatial phenomena ought to be sought in the vibrations of that
imponderable matter, the ether, in which ponderable atoms and mole
cules are plunged somewhat after the fashion of grains of dust in the
atmosphere."
I quote these words because,—-obvious as their contention must
seem to all thinking persons,—it is common enough to see phrases used
as though our notions were still bounded by the molecular;—-as though
we did not know, as certainly as we know anything, that the great
mystery of existence is only just beginning, in that inconceivable world
of ether, precisely where our utmost analysis fails us, and our mathe
matics are reduced to a jungle of infinities and of contradictions.
Put xxxvni.) Pseudo-Possession. 411
And now as to the question of possible telepathy from the dead in
Helene's case. The instance with most in its favour is described by
Professor Flournoy as follows (p. 406) :—
In a sitting at my house (February 12th, 1899) M1le Smith has a vision of
a village on a height covered with vines ; she sees a small old man coming
down thence by a stony road. He looks likes a " demi-monsieur " ;—buckled
shoes, large soft hat, shirt-collar unstarched, with points rising to his cheeks,
etc. A peasant in a blouse whom he meets bows to him as to a personage of
importance ; they talk a patois which Hélene cannot follow. She has an
impression that she knows the village ; but she cannot identify it. Soon the
landscape disappears, and the old man, now clothed in white and seen in a
luminous space [implying that he is in the next world] seems to come nearer.
At this moment, as she sits with her light arm resting on the table, Leopold
dictates with the forefinger, Lower her arm. I obey ; Helene's arm at first
resists strongly ; then yields at once. She seizes a pencil, and during the
usual struggle as to the way to hold it [i.e., whether in her own habitual
fashion,—between forefinger and middle finger, —or in the ordinary way]
"you are squeezing my hand too hard ! " she cries to the imagined little old
man who, according to Leopold, wishes to write through her;—"You hurt
me ; don't press so hard ; what can it matter to you whether it is a pencil or a
pen ? " Then she drops the pencU and takes a pen, and holding it between
thumb and forefinger writes slowly in an unknown handwriting, Cliaumontet
syndic. Then returns the vision of the village ;—we wish to know its name ;
and she ends by perceiving a guide-post on which she spells out Chessenaz, —
a name unknown to us. Finally having, at my desire, asked the old man
the date when he was syndic, she hears him answer, 1839. Nothing more
can be learnt ; the vision disappears and gives place to a possession by
Leopold, who in his big Italian voice talks at length about various matters. I
question him on the incident of the unknown village and syndic ; his answers,
interrupted by long digressions, are to this effect : "I am looking—
I turn my thoughts along that great mountain with a tunnel in it whose
name I do not know [Leopold, —the soi-disant Cagliostro, —who returns
from the 18th century, is naturally not well up in modern geographical
names ;—but this is the hill of Fort de l'Ecluse] ; I see the name
of Chessenaz, —a village on a height, —a road leading up to it. Look
in that village ; you will find the name [Chaumontet] : try to verify
the signature ; you will get a proof that the signature is really that of
this man."
I ask him whether he sees all this in H&fene's memories— " No " ;—or
whether she has ever been at Chessenaz:— "Ask her; she will know; I
have not followed her in all her excursions."
Helene, when awake, could give no information. But next day I found
on the map a little village of Chessenaz in the department of Haute-Savoie,
at 2(5 kilometres from Geneva.
A fortnight later, Helen sees the vision of the other day reappear ;—the
village, the little old man ;—but accompanied by a cure, who seems intimate
with him, and whom he calls " my dear friend Bournier." Leopold promises
that this cure will write his name for Helen.
412 F. W. H. Myers. [Supplement.
At the next sitting in my house, March 19th, I remind Leopold of this
promise . . . The cure at last takes her hand as the syndic had done,
and writes very slowly the words Burnier saint.
I wrote to the Mairie at Chessenaz, and the Mayor, M. Saunier, was
good enough to answer me at once. "During the years 1838 and 1839," he
said, " the syndic of Chessenaz was Jean Chaumontet, whose signature I find
in various documents of that date. We had also for cure M. Andre Burnier,
from November, 1824, to February, 1841, during which period all the
actes rfes naissances, etc., bear his signature. But I have found in our
archives a document with both signatures, which I send you."
[Reproductions of actual signatures, and of signatures given by M11*
Smith. The handwritings were markedly similar.]
Professor Flournoy's first idea naturally was that M1Ie Smith had
seen at some time or other some acts or documents signed by the
syndic or the cure' of Chessenaz, and that these visual impressions had
reappeared in her somnambulic state, and had served as internal
models for the signatures which she traced in trance.
Careful inquiry, however, made it clear that M1Ie Smith (whose
probity, I may here repeat, is beyond question) had never been at
Chessenaz,—still less consulted its parish archives. Whether the
handwriting of its syndics, before the cession of Savoy to France,
could ever have fallen under her eyes in some old record or certificate
belonging to friends in that neighbourhood is a question incapable of
absolute proof.
As the matter now stands I cannot claim that any true communica
tion from the departed has as yet been established for M"e Smith. Her
case is still on the verge of proof.
And here I shall of course be met with the inquiry : WThat influence,
then, must the case of M"° Smith have upon your interpretation of
the case, say, of Mrs. Piper ? Can you maintain that there is a funda
mental difference hetween this elaborate case of pseudo-possession, and
that other case, so closely resembling it, in which you claim that
George Pelham was no mere personification effected by Mrs. Piper's
subliminal self 1 Have you really a criterion by which to judge the two
groups of phenomena ? and can you explain how it is that, if funda
mentally different, they are superficially so much alike 1
My answer to the first question must be, as it has ever been, that we
have a criterion,—consisting not in the manner in which the messages
are given, but in the actual evidential content of those messages them
selves. I claim that, whereas in Mlle Smith's messages there is hardly
any real indication of an individual and recognisable focus of memories,
belonging to a human person, and such as no other known person
could simulate ; in George Pelham's case on the other hand there ix
such indication ;—pushed so far as to render it highly improbable that
that focus or chain of memories is decomposable into fragmentary
Pan xxxvin.] Pseudo-Possession. 413
recollections,—is a mere aggregate of scraps of knowledge telepathi-
cally gathered from many quarters, and subliminally fused into an
apparent unity. I am, in short, simply more confirmed than ever in
my conviction (as against the mere facile admissions of spiritist writers)
that a strict and thorough analysis of automatic messages is absolutely
essential,—and will result in showing the genuineness of a very few of
these messages by dint of their intrinsic evidential superiority to all
the rest.
To the second question asked above,—-as to the explanation of the
similarity between pseudo-possession and true possession, I reply that
from my point of view it was to be expected that such cases should
occur,—that the action of subliminal phases of personality upon the
organism should reach a point of close resemblance with the action of
external spirits upon the organism.
I regard the human organism as an entity whose life, as apart from
any informing spirit, is beyond our intellectual grasp. Whatever
independent life the cells of my organism may possess, I can only
regard that organism as a machine, which my own spirit habitually
works—partly supraliminally, partly subliminally—but which may
be partially worked also by some other incarnate spirit or by a
discarnate spirit. Each of these controlling agencies necessarily
controls the organism in much the same way ;—that method being
determined in fundamentals by the structure of the organism itself ;—
in detail by the supraliminal education which I happen to give to the
organism. Thus the power of making cries and gestures inheres in the
structure of the organism ; I educate this power into speech and
writing, which I use for ordinary conscious purposes.
Now suppose that some submerged phase of my personality gains
the power of manifesting itself, it will have to use the accustomed
methods. It may not, indeed, be able to use all of them. It may not,
for instance, be able to speak. Or it may not have the whole of my
knowledge at its command. Thus, to take the weakest case of
subliminal control, a fraction of myself uses my organism in a dream,
but can neither make me write nor make me speak, —although it may
cause restless gestures. Nor has the dream command over more than
a small fraction of my knowledge ; and the knowledge over which it
has command may l)e knowledge taken from a far-back period of
my history.
And now suppose that another incarnate spirit telepathically
influences my organism. In order to do this it can use practically the
same mechanism which a dream can use. It can affect me with
sensory hallucinations, or it can prompt me to brief utterances and
gestures, like those of somnambulism. It cannot, as a rule, do much
more than this, as our telepathic cases show. Yet sometimes, especially
414 F. W. H. Myers. [Supplement.
if the agent is asleep, he can influence the percipient to automatic
writing in a rather more prolonged way.
Let us pass on to the further hypothesis that a discarnate spirit is
influencing the organism. We shall now, at any rate, have something
like analogies to which to appeal. Falling back upon known pheno
mena, we can suggest, for example, that the possessing spirit may act
like an extraneous idee fixe, developing into an extraneous secondary
personality. It is, indeed, through the working out of this parallel—
here merely hinted at—that we may best be able to trace, as I hope
may be some day possible, a real continuity between subliminal and
extraneous influences upon the ordinary personality ;—and to discover,
perhaps, that spirit-control (or pneumaturgy) may play the same part
in expanding our ideas of multiplex personality as hypnotism has
already played in expanding our ideas of hysteria and somnambulism.
Deferring such discussion till a more fitting moment, I will con
clude with a few general reflections which this remarkable case of
Professor Flournoy's,—nay, which even some of Dr. Janet's morbid
cases,—seem to me to suggest to the psychologist who cares to'look beyond
either the narrowing hospital-walls or the perplexing seance-room.
The chief reflection is that we are as yet but in a childish or
rudimentary stage of our use of the human brain. That brain is in
truth (as some one has said) but " a virtual organ " ;—an organ en wte
d'acquisition, which man is slowly learning to use, —but with very
little notion either of how it came to be what it is, or of what it
ultimately may be.
No one, indeed, knows how it came to be what it is. No one has
even plausibly explained that great difference between the simian
and the savage organ which seems so incommensurate with any observa-
able difference between the hairy chimpanzee and the hairy Aino.
Some naturalists argue that much of the savage's brain-power must lie
dormant ;—must somehow be a mere reserve for the later calls of a
more complex existence. If this be admitted, we must surely go on to
admit that a large proportion of the brain's capacity is dormant still.
I do not mean to predict that our race will necessarily include in the
future individual minds more powerful than any minds in the past.
This question ultimately depends upon that unknown factor,—the
nature of the sources from which spiritual life is infused into mortal
organisms. Let us admit that judging by the last two thousand years
we have little ground for confidence in any such advance of the
highest individual level. Let us not be rash enough to prophesy
that there will ever be a sculptor better than Praxiteles, or a lyric
poet better than Pindar. Yet the important fact is that the great
spirits of the past made use only of certain portions of the human
brain which had through some historic cause been the first to be
Part xxxvm.] Pseudo-Possession. 415
developed. The spirits of Pindar or Praxiteles dwelt, so to say,
in the palace-chambers of their mysterious habitation ; they knew
nothing of the foundations on which the City of Mansoul was builded,
or of its treasure-houses in the living rock.
Of course Helene's intellect, though serviceable enough in common life,
is not of a calibre to confer new knowledge or delight on educated men ;
but for Helene's one-in-a-hundred mind substitute the one-in-a-million
mind of Louis Stevenson ;—let him dream—not Helene's insipid tale of
" Esenale," but " Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde," and one sees at once the
advantage of relegating voluntary ends to automatic execution,—and so
at once saving brain-centres from expensive friction and getting the
needed thing done (like those reaction-time measurements of Dr.
Janet's during ecstasy), with a verve and a completeness which conscious
effort finds it hard to rival. May not that effortless concurrent
utilisation of all elements of the personality hold ultimately somewhat
the same relation to our present painful thought as multiplex tele
graphy holds to the old slow and single transmission along the wire I 1
Let us frankly confess that we cannot in the least tell what the
brain will do till we try. The assumed balance of our faculties and
our environment is altogether chimerical. The environment is unknown
and infinite, and the faculties must simply be trained as far in every
direction as they can. We have attained no position of permanent
stability, and we have nothing to tell us a priori what will be the next
faculties which our race will evolve. And yet popular science some
times speaks as though nearly everything in human nature had been
observed already !—as though normality had been defined, aberrations
classified, a mass of experience acquired which our successors will only
have to work out in detail ! A vain conceit ! a monstrous prematurity !
Rather let us remember that only by an abiding consciousness of our
own inevitable childishness can we prevent those successors from
looking on our religions with pity, and on our science with contempt ;—
while they analyse with a smile our rudimentary efforts at self-realisa
tion,—remarking " how hard a thing it was to found the race of man."
1 The same characteristics were observable in M"<' Smith's other forms of mental
and bodily effort. "It may be remarked," says Professor Flournoy on this topic,
' ' that the drawings, embroideries, and other artistic works which were at all times
the favourite occupation of her leisure, and in which she excelx, were almost always,
from her childhood onwards, not copies of external models, but products of her own
invention, marked with the original and quaint characteristics of her inward pictures.
Moreover, these pieces of handiwork wrought themselves out under her fingers with
an ease and a rapidity which astonished herself ;—they worked Ihemacleet, so to say."

REVIEWS.
The Scientific Investijiition of Physical Phenomena with Mediums. [Mediumi-
cheskiya Fizicheskiya Yavleniya i ikh Nauchnoe Izsledovanie.] By M. M.
Petrovo-Solovovo. (St. Petersburg, 1900.)
The name of Mr. Petrovo-Solovovo, now Secretary of the S.P.R. for
Russia, is well known to our members. He has often contributed to our
publications, and his judicial and acute mind marks him out for a valuable
inquirer into psychical problems. We heartily welcome his new book—the
most important publication which he has yet essayed in this region. It is
strictly confined to a review of the work which has been done in the
scientific investigation of physical phenomena, and discusses no theories ;
it hardly even shows leanings. It is, in short, at once a most useful review
of the reports of previous observers and a criticism of their methods ; and
it contains, moreover, a certain amount of hitherto unpublished observa
tions. Most of these refer to the Russian medium, Sambor, but we are
glad to see a chapter of experiments from the pen of our veteran corre
sponding member, Mr. Aksakoff, to whom the book is dedicated. To
Sambor we will return presently, first giving a short resume' of the rest
of the book.
In his Introduction Mr. Solovovo tells us at once that he has (most
wisely) limited his field by rigorously excluding all reports which seemed
inadequately guaranteed either by the competence of the observers or the
conditions of their experiments. Mr. Stainton Moses, for instance, appears
only in a footnote, on the ground that faith in his reports is solely founded
on personal belief in his veracity. On the other hand, Mr. Solovovo does
not exclude experiments with mediums detected in fraud—to have done so
would indeed have reduced his work almost to vanishing point ; but while
duly mentioning such detection in the case of the mediums who have been
proved fraudulent, he urges that the fact, while calling, of course, for
redoubled vigilance, does not invalidate experiments where the conditions
have been really satisfactory. He discusses very soberly and wisely the
difficulties of the inquiry, and, after rejecting all d priori objections to the
possibility of the asserted phenomena, admits that all previous experi
menters, with the single exception of Crookes, have left something to
desire ; but this he urges not as an argument against the facts themselves,
but as a summons to further and more scientifically conducted experiments.
The spirit of his Introduction is, in short, thoroughly scientific ; he himself
says that he feels himself further from the thorough-going spiritist than
from the hardened sceptic.
From these preliminary considerations Mr. Solovovo passes to the record
of the facts themselves. Most of them, if not familiar, are at least accessible
Part xxxvm.i Reviexvs. , 417
to English readers. He speaks, in chronological order, of de Gasparin's
experiments on the movement of tables without contact in 1854, Hare's in
1855, and the Report of the Committee of the Dialectical Society in 1869—a
body of observers, by the way, who seem to be unique in the facility with
which they obtained physical phenomena almost ad libitum with unpaid and
unprofessional mediums. On this follows an account of Sir William Crookes's
experiments, especially those with Home—a series of observations which, as
Mr. Solovovo remarks, still, after thirty years, stands quite alone in its value
as scientific evidence for the phenomena in question. Next comes an account
of Zollner's experiments with Slade, with especial reference to " passage of
matter through matter " in the production of knots on closed loops of string,
and in this chapter, as confirmatory of Zollner's results, are included the
Russian experiments with Sambor. Mr. Solovovo then gives a brief account
of some experiments made in 1883 by Mr. Aksakoff with Mrs. Fox Jen'eken,
hitherto unpublished. In this case the medium's hands were held by one of
the sitters, and were further rendered visible by being laid upon a surface of
luminous paint. Under these conditions objects at a distance from the
medium were moved, a small bell, while floating in the air, was visible owing
to the luminous paint with which it was coated ; the sitters were touched by
hands not belonging to any of them—hands of which the faint outline could
be seen against the various luminous surfaces, and of which marks were left
upon smoked paper not within the medium's reach. We then go on to an
account of the inquiry into "direct writing" on slates carried out by the
S. P. R., where Mr. Davey's experiments played so remarkable a part. The
importance of these Mr. Solovovo fully recognises ; but he is still of opinion
that the testimony of Mr. Emmette Coleman and Professor Coues, who say
that they saw such writing actually going on before their eyes at a seance
with Mrs. Francis, must weigh sufficiently to establish the possibility of the
phenomenon. And when he urges that those members of the Society who
hold that Davey's experiments render worthless all evidence dependent on
continuous attention should have refused to investigate Eusapia Paladino, it
must be admitted that he has logic on his side. He is however hardly
correct in supposing that this criticism affects Mr. Hodgson, who took part
in the Cambridge experiments not because he thought them of any value, but
at the request of the S.P.R., because he was convinced that he could
demonstrate their worthlessness.
An account of Eusapia herself occupies the last and longest section of the
book. Mr. Solovovo himself was present at some fifteen sittings with her,
first at Milan and afterwards at St. Petersburg. His own evidence, however,
he modestly relegates to a footnote, admitting that he was not satisfied with
the way in which her hands were held on most occasions. But after a full
consideration of the results of the Cambridge sittings, he comes unhesitatingly
to the conclusion that in spite of her proved deceit, many of her phenomena
are genuine ; his belief is founded mainly upon M. Richet's gradual progress
from scepticism to conviction, and on Mr. Myers's final adhesion after the
Cambridge experiments had led him to avow his disbelief.
But the special interest of the book for Western readers lies rather, as I
have already intimated, in the detailed accounts of experiments with Sambor.
Some of these have already appeared in the Annales lies Sciences Psychiques ;
2 O

but much at least of the following is, I believe, naccessible except in Russian,
and deserves translation as a typical sketch of Sambor's phenomena, though
from the point of view of evidence it leaves something to be desired.
The first portion of this very remarkable narrative is supplied by Dr.
Fischer from his own notes ; the remarks interposed are in Mr. Solovovo's
words.
Seance of April 13th, 18!i4, *» "ie rooms of Mr. S. A. Bezsonojt.
The seance began at 9 p.m. A circle of fourteen persons, excluding the
medium, joined hands, holding them on their knees. In the middle of the
circle stood a small oval table, on which were laid a guitar ; a handbell ; two
slates tied together with string, the ends of which were sealed to a piece of
cardboard (a piece of slate pencil was placed between the two) ; a sealed
envelope containing a piece of pencil and a clean sheet of paper, one corner
of which had been torn off and kept by Mr. F. (two members of the circle
signed their names on the envelope) ; and a piece of string, both ends of
which were sealed to a card with the seals of two persons present. The
medium, having been searched, sat with his back to the fireplace, and Messrs.
Bezsonoff and V. took charge of him. Those present began to sing, and
the lights were then put out. By the heavy breathing of the medium it was
clear that, with brief intervals, he fell some four or five times into a trance,
during which luminous stars appeared, chiefly on his right side. The sitting
lasted for half an hour, and, after an interval, was resumed at 10 p.m. under
the same conditions, except that Mr. V.'s place next the medium was taken
by Mr. Tour. The light was again put out. Luminous stars began to
appear frequently. The medium stood up in a trance, when there was a
sudden tinkling on almost all the strings of the guitar. This continued
audible for some time, as though some one were running fingers over the
strings. A piece of glass coated with luminous paint lying on the table was
thrown to the ground. Then there was a sound as though something dropped
on to the table and thence to the ground—a piece of stearine candle, as
appeared later. At the same time a musical box standing on the chimney-
piece behind the medium began to play of itself ; it had run down at the
beginning of the seance and had not been rewound. An interval was taken
at 10.30 and the sittings resumed at 11. Those present rearranged their
seats and the medium was placed with his back to the door leading to the
next room. The same pair as before took charge of the medium, and in
addition Mr. Tour's right hand was fastened to the medium's left by a tape
wound twice about the medium's wrist and fastened with fixed knots. Mr.
Bezsonoti' held the medium's right hand in his left. The light was put out.
After a short time the medium began to shiver and move about. He was
sitting on an Austrian chair, and began gradually to move further and
further away from the table, so that the rest had to extend the chain
towards him. The medium suddenly fell to the ground and began to snore
loudly and groan. The two who were holding his hands declared that he
rose into the air, drawing their hands after him, and that they could not find
his legs. At this time Mr. Tour moved his leg round over the part of the
floor where, to judge by the position of the medium's hands, his legs should
have been, but the space was vacant. When Mr. Tour mentally desired to
Pan xxxvm.] Review. 419
know where the medium's legs were, he suddenly felt on the hand which was
bound to the medium the soles of two feet, which convinced him that the
medium was really in the air. On the other side Mr. Bezsonoff declared
that the medium was upon him, and was touching him with his hips. The
medium then came down to the ground and again rose into the air with his
chair. Mr. Bezsonoff, who held his right hand, immediately announced this,
and drew forward his right-hand neighbour's hand for him to feel the chair
in the air. During all this time there were two or three flashes of stars.
After this Mr. Bezsonoff declared that an Austrian chair was hanging by the
back on the hand by which he was holding the medium, and had slipped on
to it from the medium's hand. The medium -then fell with violent con
vulsions on to a sofa close by, drawing his two neighbours with him, and
while still in a trance called for light. As soon as it was turned on the
whole party saw an Austrian chair passed by its back over Mr. Bezsonoffs
left hand, with which he was holding the medium's right ; the medium was
in a trance.
After an interval of half-an-hour, the sitting was again resumed at twelve
midnight, with a fresh arrangement of sitters. The medium sat with his
back to a writing-table, between the same neighbours. Mr. Tour's right
hand was again fastened to the medium's left. At Mr. Tour's request, the
guitar was laid on the writing-table outside the circle. The medium sat on a
heavy chair of ash-wood, which was brought in from the entrance hall. The
light was put out and ringing began. One of us expressed a wish to hear
sounds on the guitar, but stars flashed two or three times behind the medium
instead. The medium fell in a trance off the chair, snoring and struggling.
His right hand neighbour, Mr. Bezsonoff, declared that, without losing hold
of the medium, he had got the chair on which the medium was sitting passed
over his arm by the back ; and the next minute said that the chair had been
taken off again. One or two minutes later the medium's left-hand neighbour
declared that the same chair had been passed by the back over his arm which
was tied to the medium. At the same instant all the strings of the guitar
twanged as though some one had passed a finger over them. The medium
in trance called for light. When it was turned on, all saw the above named
chair with its back passed over Mr. Tour's arm which was fastened to the
medium. The seance closed at 1 a.m. Among those present was Mr.
Aksakoff.
Dr. Fischer, in a letter to me of July 29th, 189!), adds : —"The medium
was under very careful control, as the chair experiment was not unexpected,
but was particularly looked for, though we were by no means sure of success.
During the sitting, while Mr. Tour had his right arm fastened to the medium's
left, and in addition was holding the latter's hand in his own, we kept on
asking him if he was holding on, or noticed any attempt of Sambor's to get
free from the fastening. Mr. Tour definitely and categorically asserted that
no such attempts were made by Sambor, and that he was holding his hand
very firmly all the time. The same question was constantly addressed to
Mr. Bezsonoff on the other side, and he too constantly replied that the hand
of which he had charge never escaped for an instant from his own."
We have been favoured with a very curious and detailed account of the
same phenomena by Mr. Tour. After some general observations on the
2 o 2
420 Walter Leaf. [Supplement.
composition of the circle which took part in the seances with Sambor in the
spring of 1894, and on the occurrences observed, Mr. Tour continues :—
"One peculiarity of all the experiments carried on with Sambor is his
extreme restlessness when entranced. He is constantly twitching, cracking
his joints, and producing groans which are obviously genuine ; he sways from
side to side, and slips from his chair to the floor. It is needless to say that
with a man of Sambor's youthful and rather powerful frame such experiments
are very fatiguing for both his neighbours. Moreover, the close atmosphere
throws him into a violent perspiration, and the moisture on his wrists, in spite
of all the efforts of those who are holding him, often enables him to slip them
free for a moment. This possibility inevitably undermines an observer's
faith in any phenomena where there is room to suspect that the medium's
hand may have been employed in a moment of freedom. This was emphati
cally the case with myself in one of the sittings at Mr. Bezsom:.ffs in the
spring of 1894, when I was holding the medium's hand and Mr. Bezsonoff his
right.
" When, in the midst of Sambor's convulsions and struggles, I suddenly
felt a slight pressure on the right arm with which I was holding the medium's
left, I immediately allled for light. I then saw, like the rest, an Austrian
chair hanging by the to]) bar on my right arm below the shoulder. It was
one of the chairs which had been put round the table for the sitters, who had
been obliged to stand up owing to the medium having risen to the ceiling, as
they must otherwise have broken the chain.
" It is right to point out that, in our previous sitting that evening, a chair
had been hung in precisely the same manner on Mr. Bezsonoffs arm ; a fact
to which some of those present wished to attribute great importance. Now,
when exactly the same thing happened to me, I remembered for certain that
during the trance and levitation of the medium his hand had more than once
slipped out of mine for a moment. Of this I told those who were present,
explaining that in my opinion no weight should be laid on the appearance of
the chair on my arm, as it might have been seized by the medium during one
of the moments when his hand was free, and dropped upon my arm when the
circle was reformed. I remember that my shameless incredulity was attacked
without mercy by others present, and Mr. Aksakoff and Mr. Pribytkoff, if I
am not mistaken, tried to convince me, from their experience of spiritism,
that similar phenomena were common enough, especially with weak mediums ;
and that if anyone doubted, we should try to repeat the experiment, but this
time with hands bound together, which would do away with all doubt.
"I acceIited the proposition with pleasure, and once more we all sat round
the table in a circle. I took control of the medium on the left, and my right
hand and wrist were tied to Sambor's left with a plain new tape, fastened
with several knots. Bezsonoff took control of the right side, but his hand
was not tied like mine. The light was put out, and we waited.
"The usual sparks began to appear, floating in curved lines through the
air. The medium fell as before into a stormy trance, with convulsive move
ments ; he then rose to his feet, and at this moment I felt some sort of touch
on my right arm near the shoulder. As I could not use my hands without
breaking the circle, I bent my head down to the right, and with my temple
struck something hard below my shoulder ; this 1 announced, and asked
Partxxxvm.] Review. 421
for light. It was turned on, and there, hanging on my right arm, was a
chair—not a drawing-room chair, but a heavy arm-chair from the hall ; one
that had not at the beginning of the seance been in the study, the door of
which had remained all the time carefully closed. The fastening by which
my hand was attached to the medium's remained perfectly intact, just as it
had been put on ; the knots were perfect, and the efforts with which they
had been drawn tight were not trifling, as the livid mark of the tape round
my wrist remained visible for several days. The whole of this part of the
sitting did not hist more than four or five minutes.
" Of course I was amazed, and my incredulity was put to shame, though it
would not capitulate without an effort. The first idea that flashed across me
was that there might have been some remissness on the part of the medium's
right-hand neighbour, whose hand was not fastened to Sambor's as mine was.
In that case the medium, I thought, might have caught the chair (on the
appearance of which through the closed door of the study I did not dwell)
with his right hand, and somehow or other got through the aperture in the
back, so as to pass it on to my arm. I now sincerely regret the slur which I
thus cast upon Mr. Bezsonoff, whose interest in the investigation of truth
was certainly no less than my own ; but facts or appearances which strike at
the root of convictions which have grown up with us from infancy are not to
be accepted without a struggle of the inner consciousness. In my blind
scepticism I tried to pass the back of the arm-chair over Sambor ; but the
efforts of three of us only succeeded in getting the upper aperture 3i in.
above his knee, beginning from the ground ; further up the thighs we could
not move it, for the dimensions of the aperture were only 10A x 8jf in. It
was perfectly clear that in order to pass the aperture in the chair-back over
the body of the medium it would have been necessary to slice off 2 or 3 in.
of both his sides from shoulders to thighs, and in addition to prune off his
right arm !
"Foiled in this, I had recourse to another supposition: how was the chair
made ? Was there any secret flaw in it ] We all set about examining it,
but after the most rigorous search could find no ingenious joints or secret
springs of any sort. The chair was just a plain, high-backed arm-chair of
ash-wood, such as is commonly to be seen in entrance halls, and sometimes
in dining-rooms.
"There was nothing for it ; scepticism had to sing small and make the
best of the fact, however strange at the present stage of our knowledge
of nature."
Mr. Tour concludes with an expression of his conviction that none of
the phenomena he saw with Sambor require, or even suggest, any ' ' trans
cendental," supernatural, or spiritistic explanation. He regards them as
manifestations of a still unknown force innate in the medium, and perhaps
capable of development.
Mr. Solovovo points out that the narrative of Mr. Tour in some points
differs from that of Mr. Fischer, but not in matters which touch the essence
of the problem. The most noteworthy, of course, is the discrepancy about
the chair found on Mr. Tour's arm. In Dr. Fischer's notes, written at the
time, this is the chair on which the medium had been placed when the circle

was formed : in Mr. Tour's, written five years later, it becomes an "apport,"
brought into the room through a closed door. We have evidently another
instance of the tricks played by memory even on the most conscientious
witnesses, and a warning of the little value of all that is not set down in
black and white at the moment.
It only remains to congratulate Mr. Solovovo on the thoroughness and
skill with which he has marshalled his facts, and on the sobriety and caution
of his criticism. He has of necessity laid the greatest weight on the per-
sonal standing and scientific reputation of his witnesses ; but it must not be
forgotten that no real solid foundation will have been laid for the scientific
establishment of these investigations till the mass of them is so great that
this personal element is finally eliminated. This will, to all appearance, be
a long task ; but Mr. Solovovo has contributed a valuable stimulus to the
necessary patience and perseverance in inquiry.

L'Iiicohhh et Us Problemes Psychiques. Par Camille Flammarion-. (Paris,
1900.)
M. Camille Flammarion is known in this country not merely as the
author of numerous works on astronomy, scientific and popular, and several
philosophical romances, but also as one who has almost from the outset
taken a keen interest in the problems of Spiritualism and those other debat
able phenomena which form the subject matter of psychical research. His
cird of election to the " SociSte Parisienne des etudes spirites," signed by
Allan Kardec himself, is dated, he tells us, November, 1861. Between
thirty and forty years ago his name was very familiar in this country as that
of a scientific man who had boine testimony to the reality of the physical
phenomena of Spiritualism and as an adherent of the Reincarnation doctrine
then current among the French Spiritists. And if his utterances on such
matters have of late years been less frequent and less pronounced, it is not
apparently from any diminution of his general interest.
The present work contains the results of an appeal, avowedly suggested
by our own Census of Hallucinations, inserted in the Annates Politiquea et
Litteraires and other Parisian papers. The questions, slightly differing from
those employed in our own census, which were addressed to the readers of
the Aniudes, ran as follows :—
(1) Haee you, at aiij time, experienced wl/kh awake, a clear impression of
seeing a human being, or hearing him, or being touched bg him, without being
able to refer thix impression to any knaicn cause f
(2) l)id such impression coincide with a death'
In the event of having had no such impression, readers were asked to
write No on a postcard, and sign it with name or mitials.
In the result M. Flammarion received 4,280 replies—2,456 negative and
1,824 affirmative. Of these latter he has selected several hundred for
publication in the present work.
Of course, in writing (p. 88) that his questionnaire is analogous to the
Census of Hallucinations conducted by a Committee of the S.P.R.,
M. Flammarion is under a misconception. The objects achieved by that
Part xxxviii.] Reviews. 423
Census were, no doubt, manifold ; but two of the primary aims were to
ascertain the proportion of sane persons who had experienced hallucinations,
and of such hallucinations to ascertain the proportion which coincided with
some outside event, chiefly death. It is obvious that neither of these aims
is met by M. Flammarion's questionnaire. Clearly a very small proportion
of those who had had no hallucinatory experience would spend two sous and
some trouble on the despatch of a postcard. And, again, of those who had
experienced hallucinations, such whose hallucinations were, on the face of
them, significant, would naturally be much more likely to take the trouble
to write them out for the gratification of a stranger. Our own work in the
Census has, of course, familiarised us with these considerations ; but
M. Flammarion has not apparently realised their importance, for in one
place (p. 222) we find him arguing as follows :—
" If these things were hallucinations, illusions, freaks of the imagina
tion, the number of those not coinciding wilh a death would be considerably
greater than the number which do so coincide. Now, we find the contrary
has been the case. My inquiry proves it to demonstration. I asked my
readers to be good enough to send me all cases, whether coincidental or not.
[Of the cases sent] there were not more than seven or eight per cent, of
apparitions without coincidences. Precisely the reverse ought to have been
the case if we were dealing with hallucinations."
The last sentence puts the case in a nutshell. The reverse ought to have
been the case, and if M. Flammarion's inquiry had been a real census, he
would no doubt have found that the reverse is the case, in France as in
England.
It must sound ungracious thus to criticise a book which is a substantial
and most acceptable contribution to our knowledge of this obscure subject.
But so much was necessary at the outset ; and before proceeding to quote
some of the illustrations of telepathy given in the book, some further
words of caution are necessary. M. Flammarion, as he tells us, received
over 1800 affirmative answers. The mere work of reading through and
assorting this mass of correspondence must have been considerable. It
would clearly have been a most laborious task for one man to undertake the
further correspondence and minute inquiries necessary to raise these
preliminary accounts to the evidential standard which the S.P.R. has learnt
in the course of eighteen years' investigation to set bofore itself. The
appeal was issued only in the spring of last year. If M. Flammarion had
undertaken, singlehanded, to write in all cases where necessary for further
details, to examine into the question of other hallucinations experienced
by the percipients, to obtain corroborative evidence, to verify dates, to
interview in person the more important witnesses, and in short to do all
that we have thought it necessary to do in the course of our inquiries, the
result of his labours could not have been published until far on in the first
decade of the coming century. We must be grateful to him that he has
done what he could, and we must remember that no other writer probably on
the same lines would have effected so much. I spoke just now of corre
spondents being reluctant to take the trouble of writing out their
experiences for a stranger. But it was no doubt precisely because M.
Flammarion is not a stranger to them that these 1,800 persons who have
424 Frank Pod-more. [Supplement.
never seen him in the flesh have been willing to do so much. They have
read his works, they have found profit in his luminous and vivid descriptions
of the vast mechanism of the heavens, and delight in the fairy tales «.t
Science and the glimpses of unimagined worlds which he has given to them.
And having received bo much they have been glad to make such return as
was possible.
Excluding cases quoted from Phantasms of the Living and other public
sources, M. Flammarion has given us no less than 157 cases of apparitions
coinciding with a death. Fifteen of them were related to him by persons of
his acquaintance ; the remainder were sent in answer to his questionnaire.
Of the 157 cases the greater number are naturally second or th.rd hand, and
many are introduced by such phrases as " When my maternal grandfather,
who died in 1882 at the age of eighty, was a young man . ." Some are
purely traditional. Again, a large number of the first hand cases are
concerned simply with inarticulate noises, such as raps, clangs and heavy
thumps, which are afterwards found to correspond in time with a death.
Such noises, as not being prima facie of human origin or necessarily
suggesting a human presence, were excluded by the terms of our own Census
question and might equally have been held to be excluded by the terms of
the questions already quoted. There remain perhaps a score of first-hand
cases relating to visions or voices definitely suggesting a human presence.
The following is one of the cases received from his own acquaintances which
induced M. Flammarion to undertake his more extended inquiry.
"III. (pp. 70, 71).—M. Andre Bloch, a young musician of great talent,
holder of the prix de Rome and a member of the Astronomical Society of
France, sent me quite recently the following account of an incident of the
same kind, which happened in 1896—only the other day, that is (Cest
d'hier) :—
" Dear Master, —In June, 1896, during the two last months of my stay
in Italy, my mother came to join me in Rome. She lodged close to the
Academy of France in a family boarding-house in the Via (Jregoriana, where
you yourself lodged. As, at that time, I still had a piece of work to
complete before returning to France, my mother went sight-seeing in the
city alone, m order not to interrupt me, and only joined me for luncheon at
the Villa Médicis towards noon. One day, however, I saw her come in,
about eight o'clock in the morning, quite upset. On questioning her. she
replied that, whilst dressing, she had suddenly seen, close to her, her nephew
Rem'' Kraemer, who looked at her and said laughing, ' Oh ! yes, I am really
dead.'
" Being very much frightened at this apparition, she had hastened to
join me. I soothed her as well as I could, and then I kept up a conversa
tion on other topics.
" A fortnight afterwards we returned to Paris, after having travelled
through part of Italy, and we then heard of the death of my cousin Rene,
which had taken place on Friday, June 12th, 1896, in the flat in which his
parents lived, 31, rue de Moscou. He was fourteen years of age.
"Thanks to a certain piece of work on which I was engaged at the time
of my mother's entrance, I was able to ascertain the date and even the hour
of the incident.
Part xxxvin.] Reviews. 425
•'Now on that day, my little cousin, who had been ill for several days
with peritonitis, began the struggle with death at about six o'clock in the
morning and died at noon, after having several times expressed a wish to
see his aunt Bertha, my mother.
" It is to be noticed that not a word had been said to us of my cousin's
illness in any of the numerous letters which we received from Paris. It
was well known that my mother had a special affection for this child, and that
she would have returned to Paris had he had but the slightest finger-ache.
They had not even telegraphed the news of his death to us.
"I must add that, owing to the difference of longitude, when it ie six
o'clock in the morning at Paris the clocks at Home indicate the hour of
seven, and it was exactly at that time that my mother had this vision.
" ANDItfi Bloch.
" 11, Place Malesherbes, Paris."
The case, it will be seen, depends upon a single memory. But it is
fairly recent (M. Flammarion's view of what constitutes quite recent
evidence differs, it will be seen, from ours) ; and, though technically
second hand, it is for evidential purposes, at any rate as regards the bare
fact i if the vision and of the impression made by it on the percipient, on a
par with a first hand case, since the narrator heard of the vision before he
received news of the death.
No. XVII. is an interesting case and is again recent. M. Georges
Merlet, Juge de paix at Malesherbes, on the evening of the 1st December,
1898, at 9.30, experienced a violent and unaccountable panic which appears
to have produced a quite unusual impression upon him. The next morning
he received news of the death of an aged uncle, and immediately connected
it with the panic of the previous evening. The death had in fact occurred
at 9.30 p.m. Unfortunately the attack of panic, in itself perhaps not
unique, or sufficiently distinctive, was not connected at the time with the
death. Moreover, as the Oxford Tutor said, we could wish that it had been
a nearer relative.
The next case is less recent, but attested by a second witness.
" XIX. (p. 97).—On December 4th, 1884, at half-past three in the
morning, I was wide awake, and had just got up, when I saw v, vy
distinctly the apparition of my brother Joseph Bonnet, ensign in the
2nd regiment of Spahis, in garrison at Batna, in the province of Constantino
(Algeria). At that time he was engaged in the manoeuvres, and we did not
know exactly where he was. My brother kissed my forehead, I felt a
cold shiver, and he said to me very distinctly, 'Good-bye, Angela, I am dead.'
Very much touched and quite upset, I woke my husband at once, saying
' Joseph is dead ; he has just told me so.'
" As that day, December 4th, was my brother's birthday (he had com
pleted his thirty-third year) and we had been talking of this anniversary the
evening before, my husband assured me that this apparition was only
inspired by my own thoughts and considered it the result of nervous
excitement. During the whole of that Thursday I was quite distracted. At

nine o'clock in this evening we received a telegram ; before opening it I
knew its contents. My brother had died at Kenchela (Algeria) at three
o'clock in the morning.

" I certify the above account, given by my wife, as perfectly accurate.
"OSmaN EsPERON.
" Retired captain, chevalier of the Legion
of Honour, at Bordeaux."
In the next case we have a clairvoyant vision, said to have been related,
at the time. But the incident again depends upon a single memory. It
should perhaps be pointed out, however, that in a case of this kind it is
difficult to estimate and quite easy to exaggerate the weight which the
corroboration of the second witness really adds to the original statement.
With members of the same household constantly occupied with the same
interests and having to a large extent the same common memories, any
circumstances which affect the memory of the original witness will tend to
some extent to affect the memory of him who corroborates. If, in the case
which follows, the vision had grown more definite with years, if even
the identification of the vision with the percipient's mother was not made
until some days later, it is possible that the husband would still be found to
corroborate the account given in the text. Probably few husbands could
afford to disappoint legitimate expectations in such matters.
"XXX. (pp. 104-5).—My dear mother died on Saturday, April 8th,
1893. The previous Wednesday I had received a letter from her, in which
she told me that she was not suffering very much from her heart complaint,
and spoke of an expedition she had made on Saturday, April 1st, near our
country house at Wasselonne. I had been intending to go out on that
Saturday, April 8th. I dined quietly at noon, but towards two o'clock a
terrible fear possessed me. I went upstairs to my room and threw myself
into an armchair where I burst into sobs. I saw my mother lying on her bed,
with a cap of gathered muslin on her head, which I had never seen her
wear, and dead. My old servant, uneasy at not hearing me moving about,
came up to me, and was surprised to see me in such despair. I told her
what I had seen, and how afraid I felt. She would have it that my nerves
were out of order, and persuaded me to finish dressing. I went out of the
house, hardly knowing what I was doing. Five minutes later I heard my
husband's quick step behind me ; he was bringing me a telegram : ' No hope.
Mother will not live through the night.' 'She is dead,' I said ; 'I know
1 have seen her.'
" I went home and we prepared to start by the first train. It was half-
past two o'clock by Paris time when I saw my mother on her deathbed, and
three hours later we learnt by telegram that she had died suddenly at half-
past three o'clock by Strasbourg time. She had not been ill, and only went
to bed two hours before her death, complaining of cold and of being very
sleepy. She did not think she was dying, for she had a letter read to her by
my father who was standing at the foot of the bed. She did not ask to see
her children, but I think she must have thought of me when she was passing

away. As I did not reach Strasbourg till Monday, about eleven o'clock, my
mother was already laid in her coffin ; but those who had laid her out,
described to me, just as I had seen it, the muslin cap, which they left on
when they buried her.
" A. Hess.
" Alby."
Strasbourg time, it should be noted, is Central European time—that is,
about one hour in advance of Parisian time.
The next case is interesting as belonging to a type of which we have very
few authentic instances ; so few, indeed, that it is permissible to doubt
whether such incidents do really occur. The present case, depending again
upon the unsupported memory of an anonymous narrator, can hardly be
said to add much to the weight nf the evidence.
" XXXIII. (p. 107).—On the 22nd January, 1893, I was summoned by
telegram to my aged aunt of eighty-four, who had been ill for several days.
' ' On my arrival I found my dear aunt at death's door, and scarcely able
to speak. I took up my place by her bedside and did not leave her again.
Towards ten o'clock in the evening I was keeping watch, seated in an arm
chair near her, when I heard her call with astonishing strength : ' Lucy !
liucy ! Lucy!' I got up quickly and I saw that my aunt had quite lost con
sciousness, and heard the death-rattle in her throat. Ten minutes later she
drew her last breath. Lucy was another niece, and my aunt's god-daughter ;
she did not come to see her as often as my aunt wished ; my aunt had
several times complained of her to the nurse.
"The next day I said to my cousin Lucy : 'You must have been very
much surprised to receive the telegram informing you of our aunt's death."
She replied : ' Not at all, I was rather expecting it. Just imagine, the
night before, about ten o'clock, when I was sound asleep, I was rudely
awakened, hearing my aunt call me " Lucy ! Lucy! Lucy!" I could not
sleep for the rest of the night.' There is the occurrence, which I certify to
be quite accurate, and ask you only to give my initials if you publish it, for
the town in which I live is made up for the most part of frivolous, ignorant
people or canting hypocrites. ,,p x t> »
The case which follows is remarkable because the narrator admits that
she cannot prove the coincidence to be exact. In the numerous secondhand
cases here recorded I have not found one in which the coincidence was
not exact to the hour—sometimes even to the minute,
"XXXVIII. (p. 110).—It was a few days before July 24th, 1895 ; I had
had just undressed mjself and was standing near my bed ; my husband was
in his dressing room at the time ; being wide awake, I saw my grandmother's
face all wrinkled, much more puckered than in reality, and as wan as the
face of a corpse. This passed like a Hash of lightning, but it distressed me
extremely. I did not say anything about it at the time, such things always
appear ridiculous when repeated, and the next day my mother let me know
that my grandmother had had a serious paralytic seizure which had rendered
her quite unconscious. She died indeed a few days afterwards. I have not

ascertained whether the hour at which I had seen her corresponded with the
time when she lost consciousness. Being an ardent Catholic, aged 35 years,
the wife of a barrister, everything which concerns the world beyond interests
me extremely. But I ask you not to make my name known, this town
being chiefly made up of empty-headed people, much given to gossip.
"L.M., a A."
In the next case we have the simultaneous occurrence of inexplicable
sounds to witnesses at a considerable distance, the impressions coinciding
with a death. Unfortunately the year is not given, but perhaps it may be
assumed to be the year in which the narrative was written— i.e., 1899. It
is not, of course, a strong case.
"XLVII. (pp. 116-117.)—On the night of the 19th to 20th May, shortly
before eleven o'clock, I was still awake, my wife already asleep at my side,
when I very distinctly heard a heavy body fall on the floor of the upper story.
My wife at once sat up and said, ' What is the matter t '— 'A loaf must have
fallen,' I replied. The stock of loaves was kept in this upper room.
•' While I was speaking we heard another noise similar to the first, then
a third much louder. I then got up, struck a light, and going up the
wooden staircase which led to this attic, satisfied myself that all was in order
there, and the loaves in their places. A dread presentiment tiiok hold of me
concerning my brother John, who was ill ; but I did not let it appear, and
when my wife asked me what had caused these unusual noises, I told her,
that I might not frighten her, for I knew her to be very nervous, that some
of the loaves had fallen.
" The next day what was my astonishment to see my sister, who then
lived at Nimes, come in in great agitation. She told me that about eleven
o'clock she had heard a noise on her table, and again when she was hardly
awakened a great commotion in the large cupboard. I then took her into
the kitchen. 'John is dead ! ' I said— 'Yes,' she replied, 'it was he.'
" A month later we heard that our dear John had died in the Birkaden
hospital (Algeria) during the night of the 19th to 20th May.
" Mariub Mariooe, Remoulin (Gard).
Here, again, are two recent cases ; the fact that the narrator in each case
admits not having ascertained the exactness of the coincidence gives some
assurance of their accuracy in the main circumstances.
"LXV. (pp. 126-7). —Two years ago my brother went as draughtsman
with M. de Bonchamp's expedition to explore Africa. I had had no news
of him for a long time, when one night I woke with a start, and saw my
brother distinctly hilled by the spear of a savage. This occurrence made
such a vivid impression on me that 1 remained awake till morning, and was
haunted by the vision for several weeks. A few weeks later I received the
news of my brother's death in Abyssinia ; he was killed by the spear of a
savage on November 14th. The event must have coincided with the vision.
Unfortunately I omitted to write down the exact date at the time. I can,
however, affirm that my vision took place in November.

when one day, at three o'clock in the afternoon, I saw some one who I knew
was in Italy pass along the street in front of my window. It made so
strong an impression upon me, that Ffelt uneasy for the rest of the day and
told one of my cousins about it. (I was wrong not to make a note of the
exact day and hour.) A few days later I heard that the person whom I had
seen pass (a doctor who had attended me, and to whom I was much attached)
had just died suddenly in Italy from the rupture of an aneurism. I think I
may affirm that not more than twenty-four hours elapsed between the time
of the apparition and that of this doctor's death. The doctor died

" XCIV. (pp. 142-3).—In response to your request with regard to facts
of the psychical order, I beg to report the following case. My father, M.
Fleurant, a retired schoolmaster, and my mother, a schoolmistress, living at
Thenay (Indre), will vouch for its authenticity. It was in 1887, in the
month of February. My mother had then at Evreux an only brother,
for whom she had a great affection, and who on his side made much
of her.
" Unfortunately, my uncle was attacked by a disease which was to bring
him down to the grave, in spite of science and of the good nursing of his
family. Towards the end of the previous year my mother had been to see
her brother, and saw for herself the gravity of the disease. The doctor
assured her that the end was more or less near.
"On the 11th of the month already mentioned, towards six o'clock in the
eeening, my mother was in the cellar of her school, and came up from it
overcome with indescribable emotion : she had heard three piercing cries
addressed to herself in the course of a few seconds ; they seemed to come
through the air-hole of this cellar, which faced north.
' ' She said to my father : ' My brother is at the point of death ; I have
just heard him calling '
" The next day but one she received a letter, dated the 12th, in which
was the announcement of my uncle's, Ernest Barthelemy's, death.
" Mile Blanche de Louvigny, the writer (i.e., amanuensis) of this letter,
who had nursed the invalid up to his last moments, said that he had in
cessantly called my mother. My mother has often repeated these details,
and she is still convinced that she was really in connection with her
brother in thought for a few moments, although she cannot explain
this phenomenon. I acquaint you with these details, hoping that they
may be of service to you in the search after the causes which produce
such effects.

In case CIX. M. Flammarion finds it necessary to append a note that he
is not responsible for the opinions expressed by his contributors. The
narrator explains that when a child of twelve he was encore mi pen de'cot,
and in the habit of saying his prayers nearly every evening. One evening
ha prayed with unusual fervour for his grandmother, and immediately after
closing his eyes had a vision of that relative. The next day he learned that
his grandmother had died at that very hour. The effect of that experience
on the trained intellect of a French schoolboy was singular. " Depuis ce
moment," he concludes, "comme je m'etais adresse a Dieu pour me con-
server ma grand'mere longtemps, et qu'il ne m'a pas exauce, j'ai cesse avec
raison de croire en lui. On dit qu'il exauce les prieres de tous ceux qui ont
recours a lui. En voilh, une preuve, et aussi de la blague qu'est la religion

In case CXXX. again the coincidence is not exact. But there are some
fine dramatic touches in the story :—
" CXXX. (pp. 166-7). —One of my fellow students (I am a lady doctor)
had gone to India as medical missionary. We lost sight of each other, as
often happens, but we were still attached.
"One morning, during the night of the 28th to 29th October (I was then
at Lausanne) I was awakened before six o'clock by little knocks at my door.
My bedroom opened into a corridor, which ended on the staircase of the
storey. I left my door half-open to allow a big white cat, which I then had,
to go hunting during the night (the house swarmed with mice). The knocks
were repeated. The night bell had not rung, neither had I heard any one
come upstairs.
" By chance my eyes fell upon the cat, which was in its usual place at the
foot of my bed. It was sitting up, quivering and growling, its hair on end.
The door shook as though moved by a slight gust of wind, and I saw a
figure appear wrapped in a sort of vapoury white stuff, like a veil thrown
over something black. I could not distinguish the face well. The figure
came up to me. I felt an icy breath pass over me ; I heard the cat growl
furiously.
" Instinctively I shut my eyes, and when I opened them again every
thing had vanished. The cat was trembling in every limb, and was bathed in
perspiration.
" I admit that I did not think of my friend in India, but of another
person. About a fortnight later I heard of the death of my friend during the
night of the 29th to 30th October, 1890, at Srinaghar, in Cashmere. I heard
afterwards that she had succumbed to an attack of peritonitis.

"(p. 184). —Towards half-past seven o 'clock, I felt a box on my ear of
extraordinary violence. I began to call out ; my mother came to me directly,
and asked me what was the matter. I told her that I had been struck and
that my cheek hurt me ; besides this, my mother observed that my cheek
was red and swollen. Uneasy at what had happened my mother was
impatient for my father and brother to come home. My father did not
come in till nearly nine o'clock ; my mother told him at once what had taken
place, and when she mentioned the time, my father replied, ' It was just that
time when her grandmother drew her last breath.' For more than six
months I kept the marks of a right hand on my right cheek ; it was very
apparent, especially after I had been playing and my face was redder, the
traces of the hand being white ; this was observed by hundreds of people.

"(p. 185).—Now, this same day, May 31st, 1895, about half-past nine
in the morning, whilst my wife was attending to domestic duties in the
house, our little girl, then at the age of two years and a- half, came up to her
mother and said in her baby language : ' Mother, look at godfather (my
eldest son was his sister's godfather), look, mother, I am playing with him.'
" 'Yes, dear, play away,' answered her mother, who did not attach any
importance to the child's words at the moment. ,
" But the little girl persisted, in spite of her mother's indifference, and
added : ' But, mother, come and see godfather—Look at him, lie is there !
Oh ! How nicely he is dressed ! ! ! '
" My wife noticed that while she was talking the child seemed as though
she was transfigured. She was aroused by it just at first, but soon forgot
the incident, which had only occupied a few minutes. It was not till two or
three days later that she remembered all the details.

Psychical research has no use for details which are not remembered until
two or three days after the receipt of the news which gave them significance.
In addition to the apparitions of the dying, the book contains a few
instances of transmission of ideas and images not at times of exceptional
crisis ; and a large number of dreams, telepathic, clairvoyant, and prophetic.
As these cases also lack corroborative evidence it has not been thought worth
while to quote any illustrations here. M. Flammarion's own attitude to the
subject has already been partly indicated. To begin with, he does not
consider that the apparitions of which specimens have been quoted above
432 Frank Podmore. [Supplement.
are rightly classed as Hallucinations. We know what hallucinations are, he
says, and we know how they are caused, and these aie not of them nor do
they proceed from similar causes (p. 221). He objects therefore to the
title "Hallucinations telepathiques," given to the French abridgment of
Phantmrns of the Living, as " titre inexact et denature " (p. 223) ; he objects
equally to Mr. Myers' felicitous coinage "veridical hallucinations" (p. 248).
But his own conception of the nature of these apparitions is a little difficult
to grasp. He has no doubt that they are caused by some action of the
dying man's brain ; that this action (psychic force) gives rise to movements
in the ether which are propagated to a distance like any other ethereal
movements : and affect kindred brains. This transformation of psychic
force into ethereal undulations, may, he suggests, be analogous to the trans
formation of sound into electric waves, and back again into sound, in the
telephone (p. 373).
Later, after explaining that the object of his researches is to ascertain
whether the human soul has an existence independently of the body and
survives its destruction (p. 564), he proceeds to consider which of the forces
known to us have an independent existence. Light, heat and sound are
clearly not independent existences—they are only sensations produced in
our organism by ethereal or aerial movements. But electricity, he is inclined
to think, probably exists as a real entity, the ether being an electrical
substance (p. 571), and in considering the physical effects produced on
kindred brains by the apparitions, he finds himself compelled to conclude
that "something" has proceeded from the dying man. Proximately, no
doubt, the "something " is but an ethereal vibration, as in the case of light.
But the vibration must be caused, and he is satisfied that no anatomist or
physiologist would venture to say that the cause would be found in the
physical structure of the brain (p. 573).
But it may be argued, as against M. Flammarion, my organism will affect
not merely a kindred organism, but any man with the normal complement of
senses, or any appropriate mechanical receiver, at a distance which is limited
only by the imperfection of our optical and other physical instruments.
What is the difference between the vibrations starting from me which affect
my friend's eye, and those equally starting from me and equally transmitted
by the ether, which, ex hypothesi, affect my friend's brain direct ? If the
one of the two vibrations is of the earth, gross, mechanical and subject to
the law of the conservation of energy, how can we prove that the other is
not also ? Or, conversely, if these prove immortality and the supremacy of
the soul of man, hive not those an equal claim to give like testimony? In
truth M. Flammarion can give no reasonable grounds for the faith that is
in him. He distinguishes between the origin of the one set of effects and
the other; but he has no argument to offer. "On sent la une proprtete'
inconnue, non de l'organisme physique, mais de l'etre pensant (p. 573),
and again "Nous ne pouvons nous laisser guider dans nos jugements cIue par
le sentiment intime qui resulte en nous de la discussion des phenomenes "
p. 574). M. Flammarion may be right ; but he must give up talking of
"scientific methods" and "scientific demonstration."

Treatment by Hypnotism and Suggestion: or, Ps,jcho-Therapeutics. By
C. Lloyd Tuckey, M.D. Aberd. Fourth Edition, revised and enlarged.
(Bailliere, Tindall and Cox, 20, 21, King William Street, Strand,
London, 1900.)
Cure by suggestion is perhaps the oldest of all methods of treatment.
In the childhood of all races the few simples used for their known power as
drugs pure and simple were largely overshadowed by charms, incantations,
and fantastic methods of cure which depended for their effect on their
power over the imagination of the patient. In those early times the priest
and physician were usually one and the same, and it followed that, until quite
lately, all such methods of cure have been in the hands of priests, soothsayers,
white witches and the numerous tribe whose interest it was to keep the idea
of the supernatural before the minds of their patients as the true means of
cure. In the present day, even in the most civilised parts of the world, we
still have miraculous cures at grottoes and wells, Christian Scientists, faith
healers, and quack healers of every description. It is a matter of regret
that almost up to the present medical men have been so much prejudiced by
the element of obvious quackery and humbug surrounding these cures as to
confound with them the results obtained by students of psycho-therapeutics.
The comparatively recent emergence of the art of medicine from empiricism
or charlatanism has perhaps made the present professors of the art morbidly
sensitive to anything which smacks of that dark age, and which it is difficult
to analyse by the scientific methods they have now become accustomed to.
It was inevitable in starting a new study of so difficult a nature that
numerous mistakes should be made and theories promulgated which were
soon to be proved untenable. The English medical school has hardly made
a fair allowance for this. Part of the reason may be that, whereas in
Germany and France large numbers of works on the subject have appeared,
in England the books which have debated the subject in a fair and equable
manner have been but few, and some of the most notable are by foreign
authors. Dr. Lloyd Tuckey's volume states the case for psycho-therapeutics
in a manner which should convince an impartial critic of the value of its
methods. He justly insists on the importance of such a powerful aid to the
physician's means of combating disease. His quotation of Professor Pitres
is apt and to the point. "Be physicians, gentlemen, and not hypnotisers,
but learn to apply hypnotism and be ready to use it in suitable cases."
With all the resources of latter-clay scientific research at his disposal, there
still remains a large field of disease which is the despair of the physician.
A large section of it consists of diseases caused by the imagination or by
causes which have had their first effect on the imagination. These, as is
truly pointed out, are anything but imagmary diseases. It is in these cases
that the method of treatment by suggestion strikes at the root of the evil in
a manner that no other kind of treatment can approach. And here a point
on which Dr. Lloyd Tuckey lays stress may well be emphasised. This
method does not weaken the will-power of the patient, but strengthens his
power of self-control. The dangers of hypnotism have always been a
bugbear which, like many others, requires but careful investigation to
reduce to a very small quantity.
2 H
434 G. F. Roger8. [Supplement.
Though the main use of hypnotism must be in diseases of a psychical
nature, yet, as Dr. Lloyd Tuckey points out, the influence of the mind over
the processes of the body is so great that we may fairly look to it as a most
valuable reinforcement in the treatment of many other diseases. We all
know the value of personality in a doctor's curative powers, and it would be
well if the influence of mind over body were a subject which all medical men
had a scientific knowledge of. The characteristics enumerated by Dr. Lloyd
Tuckey as necessary for the successful practice of psycho-therapeutics for
curative pur[K)8es are those which every medical practitioner should possess:—
"Firm will, unlimited patience, calm temperament, tact, medical knowledge
and judgment."
The common belief that hysterical and mentally unstable people are
specially good subjects for hypnosis is here well refuted,—experience shows
that strong, healthy, intellectual men are easily influenced, though those
also who are sick and reduced in bodily strength are peculiarly suscep
tible. The value of the different methods of sending to sleep is discussed ;
the less strain, the better. No mention, however, is made of the method of
inducing sleep by passes, which is of all methods the one that imposes least
strain on the subject. Charcot's interpretation of the hypnotic state and
method of inducing it is in my opinion rightly condemned in favour of that
of the Nancy School. Many interesting cases are given of the effect of hypno
tism on various diseases. It is extremely satisfactory to note the number of
dipsomaniacs cured, one third of two hundred cases. The shortness of time
required, —one month,—also contrasts favourably with the length of residence
found necessary in homes for the cure of such cases. The relegation of the
practice of hypnotism to the hands of medical and other scientific men is,
with justice, strongly advocated.
In a treatise on the therapeutic side of hypnotism, the purely psychical
side has necessarily been left in the background. Still, to the student of
Psychical Research, Dr. Lloyd Tuckey's book affords many valuable hints on
psychology. I do not know whether all would agree with the statement
"that vivid consciousness only exists when nervous impulses are sent
through new or little-used channels." Education, or the establishment of
these paths as easily travelled tracts, is, I think, required to attain a vivid
consciousness of festhetic feelings.
In the course of so many years' familiarity with the hypnotic state, it is
inevitable that many of the psychical phenomena which often accompany it
must have come under Dr. Lloyd Tuckey's cognizance. Although he rightly
deprecates experiment on patients, yet I am sure he must have accumulated
enough material for a treatise on the workings of the psychical side of man
which would make a very desirable companion to the present lucid work on
Psycho-Therapeutics. G. F. Rqo u^.
Occult Japan: or, The Way of the Gods; an Esoteric Study of Japanese
Personality and Possession. By Percival Lowell. (Houghton,
Mifflin and Co., Boston and New York, 1894.)
When the normal man sees the word "occult " attached to the title of a
book, he is generally disposed to shy from its contents. Even the most
Part xxxviiio Reviews. 435
normal, however, need have no apprehensions in approaching Mr. Lowell's
very lively and entertaining volume, while students of the curious class of
phenomena described,—phenomena of which there are traces in varying forms
from earliest times to the present day, and in all countries from farthest
East to farthest West,—will find the subject dealt with in a manner showing
much care and observation. Most Orientals are apt, as a rule, to withhold
their marvels from the eyes of strangers; in Japan, however, to judge from
Mr. Lowell's experiences, there seems to be but little of such reticence. So
readily indeed was he welcomed by the priests of all sects to the performance
of their sacred mysteries, that it is a matter for astonishment that the wide
spread system of induced divine possession which he was thus enabled to
witness should have waited until now for investigation. Mr. Lowell even
supposes that the very existence of the system was unknown to foreigners
until he himself, as the result of a chanco encounter on the summit of the
sacred mountain Ontake, was led to explore it. While practised also among
the Buddhists, Mr. Lowell is inclined to trace the origin of these esoteric
rites to Shinto, the primitive religion, which, for many centuries displaced by,
and intermingled with, imported Buddhism, is now, as a consequence of the
nationalist movement of 1867, restored in a purified form to popular favour.
"Shinto," he says, "is the Japanese conception of the Cosmos. It is a com
bination of the worship of nature and their own ancestors ... A lack
of psychic development has enabled these seemingly diverse elements to fuse
into a homogeneous whole. Both, of course, are aboriginal instincts. Next
to the fear of natural phenomena, in point of primitiveness, comes the fear of
one's own father, as children and savages show. But races, like individuals,
tend to differentiate the two as they develop. Now, the suggestive thing
about the Japanese is that they did not do so. Filial respect lasted, and by
virtue of not becoming less, became more, till it filled not only the whole
sphere of morals, but expanded into the sphere of cosmogony. To the
Japanese eye, the universe itself took on the paternal look. Awe of their
parents, which these people could comprehend, lent explanation to dread of
nature, which they could not. . . . The thunder and the typhoon,
sunshine and the earthquake, were the work not only of anthropomorphic
beings, but of beings ancestrally related to themselves. In short, Shinto,
their explanation of things in general, is simply the patriarchal principle
projected without perspective into the past, dilating with distance into
deity." Hence the union of the Japanese and their gods into a kind of family
whole, each section standing on terms of more or less intimate intercourse
with the other, —truly a communion of the saints. The gods vouchsafe them
selves daily to the people and are ever ready to oblige with small services,
either by way of working a miracle or so when required for the entertain
ment or edification of their children and admirers, or by directly entering
into possession of one of them in order to converse with and impart useful
spiritual information to the rest. It is with these miracles and these posses
sions that Mr. Lowell's book mainly deals. Of the former, it is clear that
the author does not think much. The chief forms of miracles, or god-arts,
are the ordeal by hot water ; the ordeal by hot coals—a rite very similar to
the fire-walking of Fiji recently written on by Mr. Andrew Lang ; the
walking on edges of sharp swords ; and the calling down of fire from heaven—
2 h 2
436 Everard FeUding. [Supplement.
to light a pipe or other useful end. So gracious are the gods that, while
usually reserving these manifestations of divine skill for stated festivals,
they are perfectly willing, by private treaty with their priests, to perform
these prodigies to order, at any time or place that may be convenient.
With a little good will, and perhaps a slight tendency to suggestively or
expectationally induced amesthesia, a tougher cuticle, and perhaps—
for the more sure performance of the last-named miracle—a convenient
burning-glass, Mr. Lowell hints he could have done just as well him
self, given a similar audience. A good stout sole and some useful skill
to the thaumaturge ; a good thick skull to everybody else ; and the gods
will work many marvels.
So much for the miracles. In the case of the possessions, or indueed
incarnations, the problem is more obscure. They are practised by many
different sects, each with its own rites and formula; and its own habitual
phenomena. It is not given to every one to become the home of a god, and
he who would achieve it must undergo an apprenticeship, long or short,
toilsome or easy, according to the purity of the apprentice,—such purity
being measured according to his initial capacity for complete vacuity of
mind. In the Shinshiu sect a kind of Sunday-school for boys and girls
is held, in which instruction is given in the art of temporarily becoming god
to the most pious young people of the parish,—a Delphic Academy, in fact,
for the cultivation of self-hypnotisation. The phenomena develop gradually.
An apt pupil begins with convulsions : the god manifests himself by causing
the subject to engage in violent gymnastic performances, somersaults over a
table, climbing round a cornice, and so forth. As education proceeds he
begins to grunt ; later, the grunts become articulate ; then comes intelligible
speech ; and finally, a distinct personality is developed with recognisable
attributes distinguishing it from other and succeeding personalities. For a
full account the reader must refer to Mr. Lowell's book. The similarity of
the phenomena with those attending the performances of Western mediums
dominated by "spirit" controls is very close.
And the explanation ? After showing the educative effect on the trance
state of the dominant idea, of the expectancy of the subject, Mr. Lowell
traces the resemblance of the personality developed to the personality so
expected. The subject believes he will become a god—and gradually a god
he becomes. The subject has certain initial ideas, simple and vague enough,
of the behaviour of gods, —and the gods behave just so. A long process of
self-annihilation has ended by annihilating self ; the ideas are habitual,
inherited, racial ; and the god is the personification of the racial idea.
Could we wholly annihilate all individual abnormality, could we have the
perfectly normal man for subject, "we should, as the trance state deepened
and the man lost himself, see him lose, first, his individual characteristics,
then his family traits, then the habits of his class, and so down, till only the
broadly human ones survived. The trance state would undo what evolution
has done, and return to us a primeval savage in the body of an end-of-the-
century man." The man has become his own ancestor! "And so," says
Mr. Lowell, with joy at his triumphant paradox, which will come as a shock
to such as have not foreseen the end of his nimble reasoning, "this lands
us . . . at an unexpected conclusion, to wit, that these gods are really
Part xxxviii.] Reviews. 437
what they claim to be. . . . We are viewing the actual incarnation
of the ancestral spirit of the race. ... If these, his [the subject's]
ancestors were gods in the past, gods they are that descend to embodiment
to-day."
This is very pretty, yet one cannot but feel that for this bold stroke
Mr. Lowell has sacrificed the construction of a theory to account, not
only for Japanese possessions, but for all other allied phenomena. Dr.
Nevius examined them in China, and called them devils ; Dr. Hodgson
in America, and there they were discarnate spirits. Is Mrs. Pipor nothing
but her own great-grandmother ? Will Mr. Lowell please discuss this in
his next ?
EVERARI) FeILDISg.
Aberi/lauben uud Zauberei. By Dr. Alf. Lehmann, Director of the
psychophysical laboratory in the University of Copenhagen. German
Translation by Dr. Petersen (Stuttgart, Enke, 1898. Pp. 556.)
On the whole this is a good book. It is written in an interesting, lucid,
and easy style, contains a good deal of information well-arranged and in a
compact form, and is for the most part animated by a spirit of reasonable
and scientific curiosity, which seems to aim at fairness and to fall short of it
only occasionally and in consequence of the difficulty of stating a complicated
case in so limited a space. Dr. Lehmann is commendably free from the
virus of apriorism and the habit of jumping at conclusions without investiga
tion ; he does not, as so many scientists do, hold that faith in the infallibility
of ' science' (and of himself as its exponent) is a substitute for works, and his
ingenious methods of experimentally testing and illustrating the assertions
of others often make real contributions to the subject. In fact he shows so
much of the spirit of the true psychical researcher that one is disposed to
welcome him among the select band of experimental psychologists who have
had the good sense and the courage to take to psychical research. Un
fortunately, however, this is not quite possible ; for owing either to his
early training or to a cautious deference to popular and scientific prejudice,
Dr. Lehmann occasionally lapses into crudities of judgment for which
the bulk of his narrative and his admissions elsewhere hardly prepare
the reader.
To give a few flagrant examples. In his historical survey of ancient sorcery
the Jews receive a ' favoured nation ' treatment which it would be hard to
justify on scientific grounds. Per contra in his preface Dr. Lehmann takes up
quite a comic and Canute-like attitude of one stemming the rising tide of
superstition Yet in the rest of hia book he is largely occupied in showing,
with great skill and success, how most or all of these superstitions arose as
well-meant, though erroneous, attempts at a scientific explanation of
phenomena. Again in his final paragraph he warns us that the modern
' occultists ' (among whom he seems for the moment to include the S. P. R.,
although he ordinarily makes much and appreciative use of its work) have
burdened their consciences with a terrible responsibility for the new super
stitions, to which he fears the new conceptions of telepathy, subliminal
438 F. C. S. Schiller. [Supplement.
consciousness, etc., will lead. Yet in the body of his work he found these
new conceptions useful and even indispensable. He admits (p. 462) that
there is no intrinsic absurdity in the assumption of telepathic forces, and,
on his own showing, their assertion has at least enriched science by the
discovery (made by himself) of " involuntary whispering." As for the sub
liminal, he is constantly compelled to have recourse to it or its equivalents
in explaining hypnotic phenomena, automatisms, etc. Not that he likes it :
indeed he has to explain (p. 374 note) that he prefers to use the term
'unconscious' in such cases just because unconscious ideas or states of
consciousness are sheer nonsense (!), while 'subliminal' and ' subconscious '
(though intrinsically preferable, cf. p. 431) imply theories. Are we to infer
from this that it is scientific to adopt a nonsensical, and superstitious to
adopt a workable formula ?
It would seem then that of Dr. Lehmann as of Dr. Faust it must be said
" Zicei Seelen wohnen, ach, in seiner Bnist!"
and if in this review attention is mainly directed upon the utterances of the
less admirable of these two souls, the reason assuredly is that it is more
profitable to the S. P. R. (and perhaps also to Dr. Lehmann) to discuss
points of difference rather than of agreement, and not any desire to detract
from the feeling of respect in reciprocating which the S. P. R. may well
imitate Dr. Tiehmann's handsome references to its own work.
Singling out points for criticism on this principle, I may mention first
Dr. Lehmann's attempt to invalidate Sir Wm. Crookes's evidence as to the
phenomena observed with Home. His method of doing this is to quote,
against Sir Wm. Crookes's accounts in the Quarterly Journal of Science, the
original notes published in the Proceedings, Part XV. (Vol. VI.), p. 98.
Between these two versions, he holds, such discrepancies exist as to justify
the conclusion (1) that Crookes's experiments are not rigorously scientific
but a product of his imagination (p. 270, 273) and (2) that he either had no
inkling of the importance of the circumstances which were omitted in his
first account, or else that he was guilty of conscious deception.
I own that it passes my comprehension how Dr. Lehmann should have
arrived at conclusions of such gravity from premisses so flimsy as those
which he adduces. For the two accounts correspond so completely in all
essentials that it seems to me a gross exaggeration to speak even of dis
crepancies between them, and the only legitimate inference would seem to
be the very obvious and harmless one that the first account was a highly
condensed, and not a eerbatim, account of what occurred.
But in condensing his report Sir Wm. Crookes was only availing himself
of the universal privilege of all competent scientific observers, who take it
for granted that they may be trusted not to omit any material circumstance
from their descriptions. No doubt in this case, as in all psychological
experimentation, it would have been better to have diverged from ordinary
scientific practice by publishing absolutely complete records, but then Sir
Wm. Crookes wrote long before the S. P. R. had impressed on the scientific
world the need for such quixotic caution, and, by producing what Dr.
Lehmann himself calls (p. 342) "one of the most interesting series of
experiments which experimental psychology has to show," had rendered the
scientific world alive to the possibilities of mal-observation in such matters.
Part xxxviii.i Reviews. 439
No doubt it was this change in the situation (due to Messrs. Hodgson and
Davey's work) which led Sir Wm. Crookes to publish his full notes, in order
that they might be reconsidered, if necessary, in the light of subsequent know
ledge. But one would at least have expected his critic to take note of his
emphatic declaration that he finds "nothing to retract or alter" and has
"discovered no flaw in the experiments then made or in the roasoning based
upon them." (Proceedings, Vol. VI., p. 98.) Instead of this, Dr. Lehmann
prefers to judge by his subjective impressions. He unfortunately derived
from Sir Wm. Crookes's first account an 'impression' that the conditions
in detail had been exactly analogous to those of physical experimentation
(p. 271).1 He then proceeds to derive from Sir Wm. Crookes's notes another
impression that the conditions were very like those of ordinary stances, and,
being impressed with a discrepancy which exists rather in his impressions
than in the actual narratives, he summarily declares Sir Wm. Crookes's
whole evidence to be unworthy of credence !
What renders his cavils the more surprising is that he himself is un
wittingly sitting in the same glass house with Sir Wm. Crookes. His own
report on the experiments in 'involuntary' whispering by which he proposes
to explain telepathy is very far from being complete. As Professor Sidgwick
pointed out in the criticism published in these Proceedings (Part XXXI.,
Vol. XII., p. 299) he gives only highly condensed summaries which leave a
good deal to be desired in several important respects.
Fortunately, however. Dr. Lehmann makes admissions in the present
volume which enable us to fill up the lacuna in his former evidence, and
seem to me to throw a good deal of light on his explanation of telepathy,
though they do not exactly strengthen one's belief in its correctness.
In the first place it appears from p. 455 that Dr. Lehmann has observed
in himself a strong natural tendency towards vocal automatisms which no
doubt would go far to render the "involuntary whispering" theory plausible
to his mind.
Again we find on p. 457-8 an avowal which throws quite a new light on
the short series of experiments which he made in order to test the possibility
of transferring telepathically visual images, before he adopted the idea (of
the 'involuntary' whisper). (Philosophische Studien, XI., 4, p. 473). In
these experiments results looking very much like telepathy were produced
when Dr. Lehmann was the percipient, while his colleague Dr. Hansen failed
entirely. ' Involuntary ' whispering being then taken up, the first type of
experiment was abandoned and the evidence remained inconclusive. Dr.
Lehmann indeed regards his success as wholly illusory, but the passage
(referred to above) in his present volume renders it possible that he is
wrong. He there tells us that in consequence of his strenuous efforts in
seances to produce automatic writing2 he got into such a state of excitement
and neurasthenia that the beard on one side of his face dropped out.
It hardly therefore seems too audacious a suggestion that he is himself
1 It is, to be sure, somewhat strange that Dr. Lehmann should have got sucb an
impression, for it appears from various passages that he has attended a large number
of tiances and is quite familiar with their conditions.

something of a 'medium,' or—as his scientific friends would call it—of a
neuropathic subject, and that, if so, there may really have been a trace of
telepathy about the experiments which he did not persist in. (Cf. also
p. 351, where he all but writes himself down a ' medium ').
Indeed, we might proceed to extend this theory to his later experiments
and to point out that a little real telepathy would help greatly in the inter
pretation of a faintly heard and quite inarticulate whisper, if only their
inconclusiveness were not already quite apparent on other grounds.1 Per
sonally, I feel that so long as a scientific critic of telepathy can satisfy
himself with Dr. Lehmann's explanation of Mr. Newnham's experiments,
viz., by ' unconscious ideas aroused by unnoticed whisperings ' (p. 454)
we are still a long way from an explanation of the matter.
Other admissions which are of interest in view of Dr. Lehmann's general
position are found on pp. 338, 351, and 456, that disbelief leads to non-
observation, and that even fraudulent mediums need not be wholly fraudu
lent, but may exhibit genuine automatisms which contribute to their
success and differentiate them from ordinary conjurors. Indeed, Dr.
Lehmann declares, on the strength of his own experience, that Mr. Davey
was probably an excellent ' medium ' !
On the other hand, he must by this time feel that he was a little hasty
in writing on p. 457 that in consequence of the ' exposure ' of Eusapia
Paladino "spiritism has ceased to exist as a scientific problem."
Altogether he is not quite fair to the spiritist theory. He tends to
regard it as intrinsically superstitious and a priori inadmissible (esp.
p. 471-2), in a way in which 'occultism,' i.e., the assumption of unknown
forces, is not. He is consequently puzzled (p. 314) to understand why both
' spiritism ' and ' occultism ' have so often been held together. But surely
a moment's reflection would have shown him that if there is room in the
universe for undiscovered forces, ' spirits ' may be among them, while if a
spirit world interacts with ours, the forces whereby this occurs are prac
tically unknown. In point of fact, the spiritist hypothesis is intrinsically
as good as any other, and has certain well-marked advantages, if it is
treated in a scientific manner. It must therefore be repeated as often
as is needful that superstition consists, not in holding any particular theory,
but in the way in which it is held.
It must be noted, further, that Dr. Lehmann has, curiously enough,
omitted all account of the modern evidence as to 'haunted houses.'
1 It seems to me a strange abuse of language to describe the whispering as 'involun
tary, ' and I do not wonder that when Professor Sidgwick tried to repeat Dr. Lehmann's
experiments he could not attain to the ' involuntariness. ' The fact is that Dr.
Lehmann's whisperings, as is practically admitted by Dr. Hansen (loc. cil. p. 603),
were quite voluntary and conscious. The agent was perfectly aware of what he
was about and could regulate the loudness and distinctness of his whispers to a
nicety. I am surprised only at the moderation of the experimenters in limiting
the percentage of their successes to 33 per cent. They might just as well have
made it 100 per cent. ! I suppose they stopped where they did in order to
'mimic' better the telepathic series of the S.P.R. But the analogy between
Messrs. Lehmann and Hansen's experiments and bona fide telepathy seems to
me wholly illusory.
Part xxviii.] Reviews. 441
On the other hand, it is surprising that he should have found it worth
while to mention (p. 303), and apparently to credit the stories of the ' buried
fakir.' For the only case of the sort which is evidentially respectable is, I
believe, that which seemed to occur for Ranjit Singh's benefit, as reported by
Sir Claude Martin Wade. But a slight reflection upon the powers of political
intrigue in a Hindu court to bring about the apparent result is enough
to render the story extremely suspect, without casting the slightest doubt
on the good faith either of Sir Claude Wade or Ranjit Singh himself, and
to bring out the great scientific rashness of crediting the alleged fact on
such evidence. Verily Dr. Lehmann also is sometimes capable of the feat
of swallowing a camel !
Typographically there are few errors, except that Messrs. F. W. H. and
A. T. Myers generally appear as Meyrs. In Miss X.'s case also the real
name is not Goodrich but Goodrich-Freer. This error is perhaps the more
worth correcting as it occurs also elsewhere, e.g., in FouilleVs Psycholoyie
des Idees-Forces (II., 397, etc.).
In conclusion, it is perhaps permissible to express a hope that Dr.
Lehmann may find himself able to continue his experimental investigations
of subjects whose obscurity has long been a disgrace to science, and that
when he does so, he will recognise how greatly co-operation conduces to success,
and that not only in the collection of psychological statistics. Hitherto he
seems to have asked and received little aid from those who have made a
special study of such subjects, but Professor Flournoy's recent success has
shown that it is quite possible to maintain the sympathetic attitude which
enlists support, without derogating from the demand for scientific proof.

Psgchism: Analysis of Things Existing. By Paul Gibieb, M.D. (New
York Bulletin Publishing Company. Fifth Edition. No date.)
Dr. Gibier, as he has told us in his title page, is Director of the New York
Pasteur Institute and sometime Assistant Professor of the Museum of
Natural Philosophy at Paris. He has also conducted various independent
investigations as to bacteriology, and has been entrusted by the French
Government on several occasions with the mission of studying epidemics of
cholera, yellow fever, etc. When a man with such qualifications under
takes the analysis of the Cosmos, his views are certainly entitled to a respectful
hearing. It is to be regretted, indeed, that in the present book Dr. Gibier
gives us so few detailed accounts of his own experiences. He has many
striking facts to relate, but they are for the most part either borrowed from
other writers or given in the way of allusion or reference.. Thus he tells us
that he has witnessed the phenomenon of "direct spirit writing" at least
500 times (p. 229), but the only instance here quoted occurred in the pre
sence of the medium, Slade. Dr. Gibier gives an account of this experiment
written by a third person, now dead, but it is not even clear whether he
himself was present (p. 211). One very striking series of sittings with an
American medium, "Mr. S.," who we may fairly presume to have been
Slade himself, he does, however, describe in some detail. The sittings
442 Frank Podmore. [supplement.
were held in a biological laboratory close to a large dissecting room at the
College Rollin, in Paris, in 1886, for the purpose of obtaining casts of
spirit hands. Some plaster of Paris was placed in a large vessel under a
wire cage, on which the sitters placed their feet. The conditions apparently
were not favourable to the particular form of manifestation : and the
medium felt bad influences about. No results of note were observed. At
the second seance, also, no casts of hands were obtained, but the investi
gators were not left without some proofs of spirit agency. As they mounted
the stairs in semi-darkness, the medium in advance, a glass jar was thrown
on the stairs by an unseen hand and smashed to pieces, and in the seance
room itself the medium was suddenly possessed of a violent and malicious
spirit, and, seizing a chair, threatened the company with it. Then, to quote
Dr. Gibier's account of the impressive scene (pp. 204-205), " He advanced
on us [i.e., the author, his friends apparently standing aloof], still swinging
the chair, and we were prepared to parry with our stool, when suddenly, we
know not by what force, we were prompted to try an experiment, said
to be infallible in such occurrences, which had been taught us by a man
familiar with these matters. We threw aside the stool which we held and
advanced both hands toward the unfortunate entranced one, strongly ' will
ing ' he should become immobilised. We projected, as it were, our will
against him, adding to this cerebral effort an energetical gesture. The effect
was instantaneous, and we were the first to be surprised at the happy result :
instead of hurling the chair at us it was thrown backward, and, although
quite a strong one, was broken past the possibility of repair. ' S.' became
as if struck by lightning, his body was shaken with a convulsive tremor,
brusquely carried three or four yards distant from where he stood, and
dropped on the floor against the wall. All his limbs were contorted, his
joints cracked, and finally he shrivelled and curled up like a ball."
It was through such scenes as these that our author was initiated into
the secrets of the Cosmos. Briefly, for him, as for Hegel, but with a differ
ence, the factors of the universe are threefold. There is mind, matter, and
that which mediates between them—animic or ethereal energy. It is this
third constituent which in its most generalised form penetrates as ether the
interstellar spaces, which radiates from the operator in hypnotism, which
forms an aura round the entranced subject, which can be manipulated by
Eastern Yogis and photographed by Parisian savants. In a word, Dr.
Gibier belongs to the school represented in modern France by de Rochas,
Baraduc, Barety, and the late Dr. Luys ; and farther back by Tardy du
Montravel, by Mesmer, and by the long tradition of the Alchemists. In
searching through his pages for circumstantial evidence of the all-pervading
fluid, I have found instead an admirable maxim which has already done good
service in a similar capacity for students of the Occult in this country :—
"There is no religion higher than Truth."
But Dr. Gibier gives us the means of testing for ourselves the presence
of the animic fluid. Here is an experiment which we may all try (pp.
127-8.) "It is to-day an acquired fact for all those who study the question,
that a force, which can very easily be put in evidence, sallies forth and acts
at a distance according to the wish of the active subject, or operator : or
still, when we come to the passive subject this force manifests itself in
Part xxxvni ] Reviews. 443
the percipient under the influence of a suggested order ; or again, spon
taneously in the medium during a passive, conscious, or unconscious state.
For instance, one may with some hypnotisable subjects make the following
experiment, which we shall call the experiment of Horace Pelletier,
inasmuch as it was made for the first time by that experimenter under the
following conditions :—If one, or better, several, sensitive subjects, having
their hands placed over a jar of water, are ordered (verbal suggestion) to
cause the liquid to move as if it were boiling without touching it : one
may after a relatively short time (it is useless to wait more than half-
an-hour at each sitting) see the water beginning to ripple at first and then
moving as if a small fish were disturbing it by playful evolutions : then it
begins to bubble as if it were boiling, so that sometimes it overflows and
partly runs out of the jar . . . Mr. Pelletier, who has frequently
written to us of this experiment, has not mentioned the fact that the
subjects sometimes complain, as soon as the experiment is begun, of a pain in
the arms and hands."
When our readers have carried out this experiment for themselves to a
successful conclusion, they will no doubt be prepared to accept Dr. Gibier's
account of other manifestations of the animic fluid.
Frank Podmore.
[Whilst the foregoing notice was passing through the press, we heard
with much regret the news of Dr. Gibier's sudden death through an accident.
Dr. Gibier, though still a young man, had already, as stated, done good
work in other branches of scientific inquiry : and it can hardly be doubted
that wider knowledge of these problems, and experiences of the numerous
and subtle sources of error which beset them, would have led a man of his
abilities and scientific acumen to employ in his psychical inquiries more
of the critical faculty, and to adopt methods of investigation more in
harmony with those which he had already employed with conspicuous
success in other fields.—F. P.]
Faith-Healiru/ and Christian Science. By Alice Feilddjo. (London :
Duckworth and Co., 3, Henrietta Street, W.C. 1899.)
This book mainly consists of a destructive criticism of the methods,
beliefs and claims of the so-called Christian Scientists, with some hints as
to the principles underlying the success of the movement. There is a good
summary, for its extent, of the various methods of faith-healing from early
times up to the present. Kindred hysterical epidemics are also dealt with.
So many authors have been consulted that it seems a pity no bibliography
has been added for inquiries into the subject. Mrs. Eddy's Science and
Health furnishes many quotations to show its innate foolishness and want
of the most elementary principles of logic. Reiterated and overbearing
assertion seems to be the keynote of the book and its system. The value-
lessness of inexpert testimony is well shown. The ways and means of Mental
Therapeutics are discussed in a very fair and open-minded manner, and it

is shown that cures claimed by Christian Science are really attributable to
the principles of mental suggestion now becoming more widely recognised,
especially in Continental schools. The quotation in the Appendix from
Mr. Haggard's Prayer for a Dyspeptic affords a most amusing, and yet
sorrowful, example of the utter confusion in which the mind of the
Christian Scientist seems to be as regards the elementary principles of
thought and reason. " Help us to stoutly affirm . . . that we have
no Dyspepsia, that we never had Dyspepsia, that we never will have
Dyspepsia, that there is no such thing, that there never has been any
such thing, and that there never will be any such thing. Amen." Cold
comfort for the average dyspeptic, I am afraid. I should recommend any
friend of a "Christian Scientist" to try the effect of this book on the
"Scientist's" common-sense. A careful record of the results might prove
a valuable guide to the inner workings of that modern miracle of contra
dictions—the mind of the Christian Scientist.

Partxxxvrn.i Fourth Congress of Psychology. 445
III.
THE FOURTH INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS OF
PSYCHOLOGY.
Paris, August 20th to 25th, 1900.
For the Society for Psychical Research this Congress marks an epoch,
and is surely the most decided success it has ever had. Yet there were very
few Englishmen present, and at the former Congresses members of the
S.P.R. were much more prominent. But now, as it seemed to me, the work
and the spirit of the English society met with less resistance and a more
general acknowledgment and approbation than at any of the three previous
Congresses.
This was not, however, clear at the outset. In the two opening speeches
by Professor Ribot and Professor Ebbinghaus, describing the development
of Psychology in the last century and in the last few years, the work of the
S.P.R. was not particularly insisted upon. Professor Ribot mentioned it,
shortly but appreciatively ; Professor Ebbinghaus gave it no place among
the characteristic features of modern psychology. But if we may regard
the members of the Congress as a truly representative body of modern
psychologists their attitude afforded evidence of a remarkable deviation
from this official standpoint. For if there was anything characteristic in the
company, it was the general interest and more or less acknowledged belief
in things that some ten or twenty years ago would have been pooh-poohed
and called unscientific,—supernatural, occult, or mystical.
It is true that the lines of psychology are not well marked out ; its
limits are unknown, its borders vague and ill-defined. Under the same
flag of psychology were gathered together the brain-anatomist, the psycho-
physiologist, whose laboratory work shows no essential difference from
that of the physiologist, the speculative philosopher, the spiritualist, the
mystic, the Christian priest, the Indian Yogi. We hold it as certain
that many members of the Congress did not at all acknowledge the right of
the majority of their fellow-members to represent the science of psychology.
Still, there were celebrated names, important communications, a serious and
dignified tone. And yet the opposition to subjects of an occult or mystical
character, if not weak, was certainly not overpowering.
The extremes were well balanced and the distribution of subjects at
the general meetings was cleverly and impartially arranged. There were
brilliant demonstrations of brain-physiology, showing the influence of dif
ferent narcotics and toxicants, and also of passions and emotions, on the
cellular elements of the cortical matter.1 On the other hand, an eloquent
1 Dr. Paul Heger and Dr. Jean Demoor (Bruxelles), Contributions a la 1ih;/>ioloijic

446 Dr. Frederik van Eeden. [Supplement.
vindication of the validity and importance of that most ancient and venerable
doctrine of mystical wisdom, the Indian Yoga, was delivered by one of its
distinguished followers, T. Ch. Chatterji, of Benares.
It was remarked by Professor Ebbinghaus, as a peculiar feature of
modern psychology as compared with the psychology of a hundred years
ago, that the old psychology had a religious and mystical tendency, while
the modern aimed simply at becoming a science, exactly like any other
science.
But it is useless to conceal that this does not fully meet with the views
and the motives of the S.P.R. as a whole. While that Society is extremely
anxious to proceed along strictly scientific and unbiassed lines, many of its
members seem aware at the same time that (taking religion in its widest
and deepest sense) science is only part of religion, and can have no beneficial
effect without a deep moral conviction, embracing and unifying all branches
of science, thus giving them their worth and true meaning.
From this point of view Psychology is the tenderest and most vital
organ of modern science, for in it lies the link between the science of
exact observation and speculative and mystical thought. In fact, psycho-
physiology, which consists in comparative measurements of sense-impressions
and the founding thereon of general laws, —and speculative thought, which
tries to express verbally the most profound factors of our being, are
separated by an immense gulf, and can hardly be brought under one com
mon name. The former belongs simply to the great edifice of natural
sciences, as a subordinate part, the latter being at the same time the
foundation and corner-stone of the whole building.
But the two were conjoined here under the name Psychology, and it
seems as if the natural relation between science and religion can only be
restored in this domain.
Readers of the proceedings of the Congress will easily see what a large
part of the communications consisted of what I may call the material of
psychical research. From every part of the world observations were forth
coming about mediumship, trance, thought-reading, and the like. And what
readers will hardly deduce from the printed reports is the still larger part
that these matters played in private conversation. Rumours about facts
showing evidence of remarkable faculties were rife, and it is not unlikely
that we shall hear ere long of communications, from a German source, which
will startle many disbelievers. Only caution and the fear of shaking the
well-earned German reputation for thoroughness has thus far withheld
them.
And even among the staunchest rationalists, the most rigid believers in
exact science without any mystical basis, there was a milder attitude and a
greater interest in the subject than I had ever observed before. In the
smile wherewith they asked, "Now, do tell me, what did principally con
vince you 1 " there was something of a glimmer of allowing that to be
convinced could not be so very bad after all. No doubt the psychological
rule of the crowd,—which alleges that no individual can keep free from the
mental influence of a majority, —was again confirmed here.
Another remarkable fact was the foundation of the Instttnt Psychique, or
Paychologique. There was, of course, the inevitable quarrel about the right
Part xxxviii.I Fourth Congress of Psychology. 447
name, this time not without some significance. We may have our doubts
and fears as to the success of this undertaking of M. Yourievitch ; but we
cannot doubt that it is meant to be a great international development of the
work of the S.P.R.
Our President, Mr. F. W. H. Myers, when he took the chair in June,
stated that his election was remarkable because it meant the acknowledg
ment of psychical study as a regular science, as he had no other scientific
title but that of a psychical researcher. Both this last Congress and the
Institut Psychique seem to afford weighty corroborations of his statement.
People who devote their lives solely to the most difficult investigations of
psychical phenomena are no longer considered for that reason cranks, or
scientific outlaws, who may fill volumes of periodicals and hold crowded
meetings without the slightest notice being taken by official science. Not
only did these persons form a large part of the Congress, which was under
the leadership of the most celebrated scientists, but there seems to be a
chance now that they may soon possess something like an Academy or
Classes which will form that official standard which is at present more
lacking, although more requisite, in this particular branch of science than
in any other.
For it cannot be denied that the neglect of the subject by academic
science has led to a wild and profuse growth of pseudo-science, with reckless
theories and worthless observations. So there is great need of sifting and
pruning, of the formation of a high and consistent standard of evidence,
which may be done by co-operation throughout the whole world. Can the
study of the phenomena of the human mind bo thought less important than
that of the cosmical bodies 1
The days of the Congress, August 20th to 25th, 1900, were full of promise.
Nearly every communication had something in it of a deep and startling
kind, showing prospects of dimly foreseen knowledge ;—from the musical
wonder, introduced by Professor Richet, — the piano-playing and composing
baby,—to the mad and hallucinated frogs of Prince Tarkhanoff.1 So
marked, indeed, was the change in tone that even the young Brahman's
confident reiteration of ancient Eastern claims to a higher knowledge
attained by ascetic methods fell no longer, —as it would assuredly have fallen
in earlier Congresses,—on wholly unsympathetic or unhopeful minds.

Bussum, Holland, August, 1900.
[To Dr. van Eeden's report, Mr. Myers adds :—]
Dr. van Eeden has modestly omitted to notice the most important paper
dealing with definitely supernormal phenomena which was submitted to the
Congress ;—namely, his own account and discussion of certain sittings with
which he has been favoured by Mrs. Thompson. This paper was very well
received by (I believe) the largest audience which met during the Congress.
Two other papers which had been prepared on Mrs. Thompson's phe
nomena,—in French by Mrs. Verrall, and in English by myself, —were

perforce omitted for lack of time ; but both Professor Richet and I addressed
the Congress briefly on the subject. Professor Moutonnier also gave some
account of an excellent sitting which Mrs. Thompson had given him. The
subject of trance-phenomena and " possession " was thus frankly admitted
within the purview of the Congress, and it is hoped that the various papers
may subsequently appear in our Proceedings.
Certain other papers, perhaps intended to support our views, suggested
to me the imminence of a danger from which our obscurity has till now kept
us fairly free ;—I mean the danger of indiscriminate popularisation. This
cannot possibly be avoided. We must learn to submit to hearing our own
achievements exaggerated, —and at the same time mixed up with narratives
and opinions for which we have no intention whatever of making ourselves
responsible. All that we can do is to repeat that only in our Proceedings
will the reader find any authorised account of our work ;—and to insist that
our object is still to stimulate inquiry far more than to propagate beliefs.
We are not missionaries, but researchers.
Finally we have deferred to the last the mention of a paper of extreme
interest, novelty, and importance, by Dr. Morton Prince, which we hope
shortly to be able to publish in our Proceedings. Students of "secondary
personalities" will recognise that the case described in this paper is absolutely
the most remarkable which has yet been given to the world. It is fortunate
indeed that it has fallen into such competent hands, and Dr. Prince's com
plete report of it will be awaited with impatience.

IN MEMORY OF HENRY SIDGWICK.
By F. W. H. Myees.
"From Maximus I learnt self-government, and not to be led aside
by anything ; and cheerfulness in all circumstances, as well as in
illness ; and a just admixture in the moral character of sweetness and
dignity, and to do what was set before me without complaining. I
observed that everybody believed that he thought as he spoke, and that
in all that he did he never had any bad intention ; and he never showed
amazement and surprise, nor did he ever laugh to disguise his vexation,
nor, on the other hand, was he ever passionate or suspicious. He was
accustomed to do acts of beneficence, and was ready to forgive, and was
free from all falsehood ; and he presented the appearance of a man who
could not be diverted from right rather than of a man who had been
improved. I observed, too, that no man could ever think that he was
despised by Maximus, or ever venture to think himself a better man."
These simple sentences, in which the Stoic Emperor describes his
honoured teacher, must recall to all of us, with striking appropriate
ness, the friend and leader whom we shall see on earth no more. There
are others better qualified than I to retrace and estimate his manifold
activities in the world of beneficent action and of lofty thought. I
shall speak of him only in two capacities ;—as the closest and most
revered of friends, and as our captain in the great enterprise which it-
is the object of this Society to pursue.
Yet as I speak I shall feel the perpetual need of his sanction for
what I say ; and this utterance of mine—the first which will have
lacked his helpful criticism—must needs be of all utterances that
which needs his help the most. No one but himself could truly depict
the progress of that subtle and all-embracing intelligence, and my
sketch will be but a blurred projection, where the master's thought is
dimmed and deflected by passing through the disciple's mind.
It is just forty years since I went up to Trinity College, Cambridge,
as a freshman of seventeen, and began to read with Henry Sidgwick as
my private tutor in classics. But he soon ceased to take private pupils,
and spread his own studies over a wider range. Even then he was, to
use George Sand's phrase, tourmente' des choses divines, and he sought
whether the study of Oriental languages, of ancient philosophies, of
history, of science, would throw light upon that traditional Revelation
which hung before him with so much of attractiveness in its promises.
XXXIX ] In Memory of Henry Sidgwick. 453
so much of uncertainty in its origin and its foundation. The theo
retical result of these studies was not unusual ; the practical outcome
was academically almost unique. Theoretically he concluded that the
Christian tradition—so long, at least, as it remains unsupported by
cognate evidence—is not strong enough to upbear the orthodox creed
as to the existence and the relation to mankind of a spiritual world.
Practically he determined that, as he was no longer "a bond-fide member
of the Church of England," he would resign his Trinity Fellowship,
which was held upon that condition.
It may illustrate the bluntness of moral perception which such tests
engender, if I add that—even while myself aggressively orthodox—I
nevertheless considered that the vague phrase of the Declaration,—
which had been substituted for a definite subscription to the Articles—
permitted the retention of a Fellowship by any man who had been born
into the Church of England, and had not taken any overt step to re
nounce his allegiance. Sidgwick's action, however, caused no surprise ;
he was already a man (as George Eliot later said of him), whose
friends tacitly expected him to conform to moral standards higher than
they themselves cared to maintain. His resignation, as is well known,
brought others with it ; it attracted the attention of Parliament, and
exercised some real influence in procuring the abolition of University
Tests.
In single-hearted devotion to the Right and Reasonable there was
no period of life in which Henry Sidgwick had much to learn. But I
shall not conceal,—what is indeed to his credit,—that in some other
directions his ultimate character was largely of his own making. I
cannot claim for him that he was by nature one of those men
oo-oit hibaKTov nijSc'v,—who, like his friend Charles Bowen, seem born
to attract every love and to win every victory. Those who knew
Sidgwick only in later life, when sympathy, benignity, the very
ripeness and mellowness of wisdom, seemed his predominant traits,
would be surprised to know of the coldness with which he was regarded
by many contemporaries and juniors in his early student days. "High,
self-contain'd, and passionless," like the mystic Arthur,—he almost
seemed, as he himself wrote to me later, to be "cased in a bark of
selfish habit," and to fulfil all righteousness with a jejune precision,
—almost as anxious not to accord too much to his neighbours as not
to accord too little. There was a reserve, a preoccupation, perhaps
also a proud sensitiveness, which chilled and checked in him the
natural lavishness and abandon, of youth. But he became, as I
have said, the faber indolis sum ;—by sheer meditation, by high
resolve, he made himself such as we all know him ;—so that " no
man could ever imagine either that he was despised by Maximus,
or that he was himself a better man."
454 F. W. H. Myers. [pabt
Yet partly also I ought to say of that earlier stage of his character
that it was / who " half despis'd the height, To which I would not or I
could not climb," and that on his part the treasure was not proffered
till it was needed ;—that his lesson of wise suspense and high resolve
was taught to those only who had found the world's facile pleasures
empty, and its confident solutions vain.
My own entry into his intimacy, at any rate, was in an hour of
deep inward need.
" Faith at her zenith, or all but lost in the gloom of doubts that darken
the schools" :—
I had passed through all these stages, and visiting Cambridge again in
1869 to examine for the Moral Sciences Tripos, I felt drawn in my per
plexities to Henry Sidgwick as somehow my only hope. In a star-light
walk which I shall not forget (December 3rd, 1869), I asked him, almost
with trembling, whether he thought that when Tradition, Intuition,
Metaphysic, had failed to solve the riddle of the Universe, there was still
a chance that from any actual observable phenomena,—ghosts, spirits,
whatsoever there might be,—some valid knowledge might be drawn as
to a World Unseen. Already, it seemed, he had thought that this was
possible ; steadily, though in no sanguine fashion, he indicated some
last grounds of hope ; and from that night onwards I resolved to
pursue this quest, if it might be, at his side. Even thus a wanderer
in the desert, abandoning in despair the fair mirages which he has
followed far in vain, might turn and help an older explorer in the poor
search for scanty roots and muddy water-holes.
This was, I fear, but a slow and late conversion to the sense, which
so many men had already reached, of Sidgwick's penetrating wisdom.
When I think of other Trinity men whom I have found worthy of
respect, from rather before my own date to rather after it,—of
Montagu Butler, R. C. Jebb, G. O. Trevelyan, Henry Jackson,—of
Balfours, Lytteltons, Darwins,—of W K. Clifford, Lord Rayleigh,
F. W. Maitland, Walter Leaf, Henry Butcher, Edmund Gurney, and
the rest ;—it seems to me as though all these had been prompter than
I to appreciate that which in the end I knew so well. Nay, but in the
end, perhaps, of all these, only Arthur Balfour and Edmund Gurney
fell into quite the same attitude towards Sidgwick as myself :—the
attitude as of " companions of Socrates " :—as it were, say, a Kritias of
happier omen, a Theages, a Simmias,—feeling an essential stimulus to
self-development in his intellectual search, his analysing elenchus ;—
and feeling also in the steadfastness of his inward aspiration a
prophylactic, as each man might need it, against dilettantism, or self-
indulgence, or despair.
How strong may be that craving for Wisdom, when once Wisdom
has seemed to speak with us in the voice of a man ! " Beauty," says
xxxix.] In Memory of Henry Sidgwick. 455
Plato, " we love best, because we see her clearest ; Wisdom with
bodily eyes we cannot see, or terrible had been the loves she had
inspired."
In that colloquy of which I have spoken above, Sidgwick and I had
caught together the distant hope that Science might in our age make
sufficient progress to open the spiritual gateway which she had been
thought to close ;—to penetrate by her own slow patience into the
vestibule of an Unseen World.
"I sometimes feel," he wrote to me in 1872, " with somewhat of a
profound hope and enthusiasm, that the function of the English mind,
with its uncompromising matter-of-factness, will be to put the final
question to the Universe with a solid passionate determination to be
answered which must come to something."
Yet the mode of putting this idea into practice was hard to find.
We were forced in the beginning to follow pathways trampled for the
most part by quite other than scientific feet. Our efforts of the first
few years (1872-6) were tiresome and distasteful enough ;—yet what
were they in comparison to the hardship which a naturalist will undergo
to trace (say) the breeding-ground of a song-bird, or to establish the
relationships of a worm of the sea ? The efforts would have been as
nothing had the results been clear. But the results of those years
were on either side unsatisfactory ;—so contradictory, so perplexing,
that we could neither feel sure that there was nothing discoverable,
nor yet that any valid discovery had in fact been made. For some
years, indeed (1876-1881), we worked but fitfully, —half-sickened at
" Craft, with a bunch of all-heal in her hand, follow'd up by her vassal
legion of fools." Yet even those years were not lost. Driven perforce
to question ourselves closely as to the validity of the principles from
which we had started, we found no reason to desert them. Assuredly,
if a spiritual world has ever been manifested to man,—has ever been
intermingled with this material scheme of things,—it must be manifest,
must be intermingled now. The failure of such an inquiry as ours ;—
I mean the ultimate relinquishment of every effort in this one direction
of real possibility of advance ;—must needs prove, if not a death
blow, yet a dire discouragement to every sacred memory, to all
spiritual hope. It would be hard for future men to persuade them
selves that what in ages of knowledge and clarity was seen to be fraud
and illusion had yet been verity and revelation in the confused
obscurity of the Past.
And thus it was to men wearied but not broken, discouraged but
not despairing, that at the end of 1881 a fresh call to exertion came.
An attempt was to be made, under somewhat better auspices than other
such attempts which had failed before, to confront spiritualistic and
similar beliefs with scientific inquiry. Professor Barrett represented
45G F. W. H. Myers. [part
the scientific, Stainton Moses the spiritualistic camp. One of the
first questions, of course, was whether Sidgwick would join in the
proposed Society. Edmund Gurney and I made our adhesion contin
gent on his acceptance of the Presidency ;—but reported to him that
there seemed indeed to be a chance here of uniting new inquirers, and
of pushing promising experiments.
He took time to consider his reply ;—a reply on which the employ
ment of much of the energy of his remaining eighteen years of life in
fact depended. It would have been impossible to press him to consent.
Admit that we had been right in making our laborious attempt ;—nay,
that it was still right to keep a watchful eye on any possible opening
for inquiry. Yet he had done all that utmost fairness could require.
Ought a man who in so many other ways could definitely advance
human knowledge and human happiness to turn aside and commit
himself anew—and more deeply than ever—to the gratuitous quixotism
of endeavouring to benefit the race in this difficult and uncalled-for
way ?—to get the moon for a child who had not even cried for it f
"To the Jews a stumbling-block, and to the Greeks foolishness."
Who really wanted the new knowledge, even if we could manage to
give it them ? Men satisfied with an existing revelation did not desire
to have that revelation extended. They no more wished to have their
unique tradition enrolled and justified in a cosmic order than those old
warriors wished to have the eclipse which routed their foemen reduced
under astronomical law. And as for the " Greeks,"—the men of
science to whom we desired to link ourselves,—from them there was
little sign as yet of anything but compassion or scorn.
On the other side was the fact that, however unsatisfactory our
quest might have thus far proved, there yet had never been (as Sidg
wick himself had said) " any given moment at which we felt that we
had a right to abandon it." Its problems were still absolutely
unsettled ; and it was still possible that at any moment light might
come. And the original thesis still stood firm—namely, that whether
or no it be possible by observation and experiment,—along the paths
of science patiently pursued,—to raise the human race into ethical
stability,—the Cosmos into intelligible coherence ;—at any rate these
results are certainly not attainable in any other way. Without fresh
facts none of us can get any further. There are simply not enough
known determinants for any valid solution. What use in fondling
hallowed traditions, or in juggling with metaphysical terminology?
Unless the human race can find more facts, it may give up the problem
of the Moral Universe altogether.
Sidgwick consented to become the first President of the Society for
Psychical Research ; and on July 17th, 1882, delivered an Inaugural
Address (Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. I., page 78) which in its freedom
XXXIX.] In Memory of Henry Sidgwick. 457
alike from pretentiousness and from contentiousness set a precedent
from which he never departed.
Of what essential value his services were to the new body has been
well shown in a letter recently sent by Mr. Podmore to the Daily
Chronicle :—
For the first few years of its existence (except for an interval, during which
he stepped aside in favour of the late Professor Balfour Stewart) Mr.
Sidgwick acted as president of the Society. But the bare statement of that
fact conveys a very inadequate idea of the real nature of the services
rendered by him. That he gave largely—very largely—of his personal
means to help the work of investigation in those earlier years is the least of
his benefits. He presided throughout at our councils ; he took an active
share in the tedious work of experiment, of examining witnesses, of
collecting and appraising evidence ; the Unes on which our work could best
be done were laid down by his advice and pursued under his personal
direction ; all the publications of the Society were issued under his immediate
supervision. That of late years he has delegated to others many of these
functions was due less to any decay of his personal interest in the work of
investigation than to the feeling that his immediate supervision of all details
was no longer neceasary. But he has throughout these eighteen years been
a regular attendant at our meetings, and has taken a constant and predominant
part in all our deliberations. Whatever position the S.P.R. may hold to-day,
whatever good work it may have done in exposing error or in directing
attention to neglected facts in human psychology, its success is due, in the
largest measure, to the wisdom, the clear insight, the ' ' particularly sane
intellect " (to quote the words of your memoir), and, above all, to the pre
eminent justice and veracity of our first president.
No other man, I think, could have filled that post so well as he.
We had before us no straightforward scientific task, such as could be
planned once for all, and then parcelled out to committees for execution.
What was needed was a wide and scattered inquisition into human
faculty and human experience ; an inquisition which could not rely
only on familiar canons of evidence, but needed the establishment of
many new criteria, consistent with each other and with the old. There
was work for many specialists, but at the head of all there was
manifest need of a philosopher in the widest sense ;—of a man
accustomed, like the author of the Methods of Ethics and the Principles
of Political Economy, to weigh conflicting opinions, to comprehend
and meet the perplexities of varying minds.
Moral qualities were needed, too ;—patience, and caution, and
urbanity ;—and above all a certain doggedness and fixity of resolve,
which should pursue its course unbaffled by long delays, by mortifying
defeat. And Sidgwick possessed, in an almost unique degree, that
motive for dogged persistence which lay in a deep sense of the incurable
incoherence of the intelligible world, as thus far grasped by men.
458 F. W. H. Myers. [part
More thoroughly than any other man known to me he had exhausted
one after another the traditional creeds, the accredited speculations ;—
had followed out even to their effacement in the jungle the advertised
pathways to truth. Long years of pondering had begotten in him a
mood of mind alike rare and precious ;—a scepticism profound and far-
reaching, which yet had never curdled into indifference nor frozen into
despair.
His controversial urbanity, indeed, never quite concealed the
clearness and even the sternness of his perception of the fallacies
which both Christian apologetics and a priori metaphysics too often
hide at their heart. 1 And thus, while renewing this toilsome quest in
no sanguine spirit, he renewed it at least with the conviction that there
was nothing else of equal moment to be done ; that if, where religion
and philosophy had failed in establishing certainty, Science were to fail
also, "the human race," as he once said to me, "had better henceforth
think about these matters " (the basis of morals, the government of the
universe) " as little as they possibly can."
I shall not here attempt to define the various conclusions—or /ion-
conclusions—at which this cautious thinker arrived in the course of
his long research. I will quote only a few sentences,—for him of
unusual definiteness,—to which he signed his name, at the close of that
laborious statistical inquiry into hallucinations over which he presided,
and which fills the tenth volume of our Proceedings (Vol. X., p. 394).
" Between deaths and apparitions of the dying person a connection
exists which is not due to chance alone. This we hold as a proved fact.
The discussion of its full implications cannot be attempted in this
paper;—-nor, perhaps, exhausted in this age."
Now, it is true indeed, as those last words hint, that the scientific
mind of the actual generation is scarcely prepared to use in any fruitful
manner—or even to realise with full clearness—a discovery so far
remote from that synthesis of knowledge on which human thought is at
present mainly engaged. The fact alleged has few existing connections ;
it remains, so to say, on the mere surface of the hearer's mind. Yet of
course no savant, no philosopher, can deny that that one fact, if true,
constitutes an inlet into cosmic laws of an absolutely new kind ;—
suggests operations and an environment of which we have hitherto
possessed no positive knowledge whatever. It forms a first step towards
exactly what we are aiming at,—namely, the discovery by scientific
methods of a spiritual world. It is a fact whose bare existence must
negative much previous theorising and suspend much more ;—must
1 Thoroughly Socratic was his appeal for instruction to a fellow-examiner, when
revising the papers of some ultra-Hegelian young man : " I can see that this is
nonsense ; but is it the right sort of nonsense ? ' '
XXXIX.] In Memory of Henry Sidgwick. 459
negative that mechanical materialism which asserts that " the world is
made of ether and atoms, and there is no room for ghosts;"—must
suspend that obscurantist timidity which assumes that we already
know as much as we ever shall know, or ever ought to know, as to the
soul or the destiny of man. The attraction of straws to amber was in
like manner for many years a phenomenon too remote from existing
knowledge to sink deep even into the most eager minds : yet that
unexplained physical attraction then, like this unexplained spiritual
attraction now, was probably the phenomenon of greatest pregnancy
offered to the observation of men.
Thus far, perhaps, but hardly farther, may one here insist on the
importance of the psychical work accomplished by one who always
insisted that such accomplishment was scarcely to be looked for yet ;
that we pioneers ought to be well content if we could prepare the
scientific mind of the opening century for a forward step such as has
never been dreamt of till now ;—prepare the unborn workers, in every
realm of philosophy and religion,
To cast the kingdoms old
Into another mould.
It has been said of Sidgwick that "although he was the most
influential man in Cambridge, he founded no school." Not at Cam
bridge only, but over all the civilised world, I think that there are
many of us who will say that he did found a school, and that we are
his scholars. He did not indeed bequeath to us his wisdom in the
shape of crisp metaphysical bank-notes, which the Universe would
ultimately decline to cash. Nor did he, like the old man in the fable,
tell us to dig everywhere for a treasure which in reality was only
to consist in the strengthening of our own minds. Nay, he pointed to
a definite spot ; he vigorously drove in the spade ; he upturned a
shining handful, and he left us as his testament, Dig here.
We can claim no monopoly in his spiritual benefactions ;—but
so far as in us lies we can resolve to carry on our work in his spirit.
To do this, we must remember that our very raison d'etre is the
extension of scientific method, of intellectual virtues,— of curiosity,
candour, care,—into regions where many a current of old tradition,
of heated emotion, even of pseudo-scientific prejudice, deflects the bark
which should steer only towards the cold, unreachable pole of absolute
truth. We must recognise that we have more in common with those
who may criticise or attack our work with competent diligence than
with those who may acclaim and exaggerate it without adding thereto
any careful work of their own. We must experiment unweariedly ;
we must continue to demolish fiction as well as to accumulate truth ;
we must make no terms with any hollow mysticism, any half-conscious
460 F. W. H. Myers. [part
deceit. If we act thus, we need fear nothing for our adventure. The
humblest scouts who strive loyally to push forward the frontier of
Science, even though Science at first disown them, are sure in time
to hear her marching legions possess the unfrequented way.
Yet one thing more. To conform to scientific rule and procedure
is a task within the power of diligent men. We must not leave that
undone ;—but if we would follow in our first President's steps, there
is something harder than that which we must do. Sidgwick was not
only cautious, systematic, self-controlled, he was also unresting, un-
deviating, inwardly ardent to the end ;—possessed, as Plato has it,
with that " iron sense of truth and right " which makes the least
indication of intellectual as well as of moral duty fall on the heart
as an intimate and urgent command :—nay, which bids a man place
hope and joy in those things only, "by dwelling on which it is"—
as Plato again tells us—" that even God is divine."
In ardour, I say, rather than in circumspection, in force of will
rather than in pondering hesitancy, lay the true core of Sidgwick's
life. Even his affections—at first somewhat narrowly bestowed, some
what sternly ordered—widened and deepened, until the emotional
nature became as rich and strong as the intellectual. Many there are
who know that they gave him of their best, and that he gave of his
best to them ;—not a few, for whom the Cambridge gardens and
avenues will seem still charged with a sacred intimacy, and haunted
by a quiet voice, and fragrant with memories of some help or guidance
of long ago ;—the reason's slowly-broadening outlook, the heart's slow-
stablished calm.
" From kindly act to kindly act," he passed, like Marcus Aurelius,
" with memory of God." Yet even the calmest existence, if sympathies
be strong, must come at times within the wind of some tempest which
has swept over other lives. I have watched him play his part in a
great tragedy ; I have seen with what delicate comprehension, with
what inexhaustible tenderness, he could come to the succour of some
innocent, long-suffering soul. I have seen him also in the joy of his
own complete and fitting guerdon ; a bliss which came to him through
the affections, and was founded upon the deep community of upward-
striving souls. We who most revered Henry Sidgwick desired for him
no earthly honours. Those are but trivial ornaments for the life of
such a man. We knew that the Primal Life has so woven our lesser
lives into one shining fabric,—has interlinked our human hearts in the
unity of so strange a joy,—that, when once through some predestined
encounter the spirit's kinships have been stablished for ever, there is
no need for further questioning as to the recognition or recompense of
even the best and wisest soul. Already in this life of earth heaven'
prizes are bestowed with lavish hand ; there is no man's achievement
xxxix.] In Memory of Henry Sidgwick. 461
of wisdom or virtue which one woman's ' reverence cannot amply
recognise, one love extravagantly repay.
And still through all personal joy or sorrow, loneliness or com
panionship, there lived on in this man's heart that impersonal ardour,
that cosmic passion, which from suppression takes a whiter glow, and
burns in the penetralia of the spirit, a silent inextinguishable flame. I
have said above that our life's bark should be steered ever towards the
icy pole of absolute truth. But there is a more living, a truer metaphor.
My most vivid memory of my friend is as he would recite to me—and
I have never known man or woman who could recite poetry like him—
that noble apologue of Seekers which was the central expression of his
inward life. I speak of Tennyson's poem of " The Voyage," that
allegory of the lifelong quest of an Ideal,—through all its semblances
the same unknown Reality,—whose pursuit is more entrancing and
more imperious than any earthly joy.
For one fair Vision ever fled
Down the waste waters day and night,
And still we follow'd where she led,
In hope to gain upon her flight.
Her face was evermore unseen.
And fixt upon the far sea-line ;
But each man murmur'd, " O my Queen,
I follow till I make thee mine."
And now we lost her, now she gleam'd
Like Fancy made of golden air,
Now nearer to the prow she seem'd
Like Virtue firm, like Knowledge fair,
Now high on waves that idly burst,
Like Heavenly Hope she crown'd the sea,
And now, the bloodless point reversed,
She bore the blade of Liberty.
Nay, and the last stanza also spoke his indomitable resolve ;—and
not the less characteristically for the touch of self mockery with which
the poet ends the song :—
Again to colder climes we came,
For still we follow'd where she led :
Now mate is blind and captain lame,
And half the crew are sick or dead,
But blind or lame or sick or sound,
We follow that which flies before :
We know the merry world is round,
And we may sail for evermore.
To these hidden fervours Fate vouchsafed few occasions of outward
enterprise, of manifest heroism. She left him content with the inward
462 F. W. H. Myers. [paet
uplifting, and the unnoted sacrifice, and the secret habit of honour.
Yet at last, with strangely solemn prevision, came to him that last
opportunity which no Fate can begrudge to us,—the call of slow
creeping Death.
I learnt his sentence from his own lips just before he presided at a
meeting of the Synthetic Society, at which Mr. Arthur Balfour read a
paper upon Prayer. And thus it came about that my friend's last
utterance,—not public, indeed, but spoken intimately to a small com
pany of like-minded men,—was an appeal for pure spirituality in all
human supplication ; a gentle summons to desire only such things as
cannot pass away. I will not say how his countenance showed then
to my eyes ;—eyes dimmed, perhaps, with secret knowledge of what
so soon must be.
It was nearly three months later that at Terling Place I bade him
—I will not say a last—farewell. Peace was there, without and
within. Before the open window lay such a scene as Matthew Arnold
had desired for his own departing :—
Bathed in the sacred dews of mom
The wide aerial landscape spread ;—
The world that was ere I was born,
The world that lasts when I am dead.
Within was the nobly humble spirit, awaiting the great advance
ment, before that summer prospect of august serenity, amid that group
of steadfast loves. " As I look back on my life,"—almost his last
words to me were these,—-" I seem to see little but wasted hours. Yet
I cannot be sorry that you should idealise me, if that shows that I
have made my ideals in some degree felt. We must idealise, or we
should cease to struggle."
Idealisation is not always illusion. That was not illusion, when
often with look or word that pointed onward and upward he made me
feel, like Plotinus gazing on Justice and Virtue, oire Ztnttpos oCrt r'i5or
ovra xaXd—" neither evening star nor morning is so fair." Thit was
not illusion, if sometimes the veil was lifted and the reality was
clear ; and, like Odysseus when at the end of all his wanderings that
Figure stood by him in the way, I felt that through those eyes shone
something that was not of earth, and Heavenly Wisdom walked
beside me with the voice and semblance of my friend.

[At the conclusion of Mr. Myers' address, which was delivered at a
General Meeting of the Society on November 17th, 1900, Dr. Oliver
Lodge communicated the following remarks] :—
I will speak no word of compliment concerning the utterance to
which you have just listened ; for it has been a soul-stirring tribute
from a friend to a friend, and as such is sacred and above outside
appreciation.
Nevertheless, as one proud to reckon himself in a minor degree a
friend of Henry Sidgwick, as one who by mixing in the world of
science has learned something of the attributes of scientific men, I
should esteem it a privilege to be permitted to bear witness to the
eminently scientific type of mind which he possessed. Others will be
impressed with his liberality, his public spirit, his keen interest in
education, his brilliancy as a man of letters ; I will speak of his
scientific side alone. For clear-, cautious intellect and for consummate
honesty I have not known his superior. Physicists will understand
what I mean if I say that for critical judgment and supreme candour
he stands in my mind on a level with Lord Rayleigh.
The word honesty or candour sounds weak and commonplace in
this connection, and in its ordinary acceptation so it is ; but there are
degrees of candour even among honest and candid men, and in Henry
Sidgwick's case the commonplace aspect of the virtue dropped off and
something of singular dignity shone forth. Those who knew him best
may best realise what I mean, may remember instances of his analysis
of a situation—his comprehension of an opponent's attitude ; but even
comparative strangers must have been struck with it, for it was a part
of his world-wide reputation. Others might be accused of letting
their intelligence be governed by their emotions, their judgment be
overpowered by their hopes, their scientific acumen be cloaked by their
ambition to be of service, their caution be melted by their enthusiasm :
—and the accusation might have some grain of truth, why not ? I
have accused myself of such momentary lapses before now.
But such criticism of Henry Sidgwick was never so much as hinted
at : no one, however hostile to our inquiry, ever imagined that Sidgwick
let his enthusiasm warp his judgment or his candour be coloured by
his hopes. Other faults had to be invented for him : over-coolnessi
hyper-caution, excessive hesitation, exaggerations of his great virtue,
we have heard attributed to him ;—yea, I myself have occasionally
felt a momentary impatience because even on level ground or on an
464 Dr. Oliver Lodge.
upward slope he would keep a tight rein ; but the impatience was
momentary ; and ample justification of the precaution was soon per
ceived in some dangerous dip close ahead.
And of what vital moment to our cause this reputation, this
attribute, of his has been ! To it, more perhaps than to any other
single influence, is the comparative success of our movement due. Our
researches are hardly yet recognised by official science, it is true, but
they are far nearer recognition than ever before—far nearer than they
were twenty years ago.
And this recognition is important, for in no other way can their
continuance be ensured independently of the lives of individuals.
Individual men of genius in the past have now and again proceeded as
far as we have in actual experience ; but their influence has practically
ended with their lives ; and the world, momentarily awakened, has
lapsed once more into psychical dark ages.
So it may be again, but so I hope that again it will not be. I
trust that now, at the end of a century of science, a new science has
been born, and has not been still-born. If it should live, and should
be nurtured by the goodwill and the labour of generations of critical
and painstaking workers, that result will have been rendered possible
not solely by the manifold powers and energies of Edmund Gurney
and, of some still living, but by those powers and energies guided
and curbed and directed by the serene sovereign wisdom of Henry
Sidgwick.

THE DEVELOPMENT AND GENEALOGY OF THE MISSES
BEAUCHAMP :
A Preliminary Report of a Case of Multiple Personality.1
By Morton Prince, M.D.
Physician fur Nervous Diseases, Boston City Hospital, Boston,
Massachusetts.
What I propose to tell in this paper is the way in which the
different personalities of Miss Beauchamp became developed, and the
relation which they bear to each other and the true self.
From a great mass of phenomena manifested by this case2 (aboulia,
negative hallucination, crystal visions, co-existent conscious states,
automatic writing, etc., etc.) I have selected these two points as being,
it seems to me, the most important involved in its psychology.3
Miss Beauchamp is a person with several personalities. She has at
least three, besides three hypnotic states, and during the past two or
three years these three persons have been coming and going apparently
without any law or order. First one and then the other has been
bobbing in and bobbing out, while each one of them claims to be tbe
real Miss Beauchamp, and to have the sole right to existence to the
exclusion of the others. Each has objected to the habits and doings of
the others and to their being allowed to stay and to any consideration
being shown them. It has not been easy to determine which of two
personalities at least, if either, is the real self. Cases of multiple
personality are not very uncommon, but, so far as I know, no attempt
has been made to determine the relation which the different
personalities bear to each other. They have been regarded as more or
less isolated phenomena, each personality described with its own
1 Read at the International Congress of Psycho'ogy, Paris, August, 1900, under
the title of The Problem of Multiple Personalities.
2 For a briefer account of some of the features of this case, see Dr. Morton
Prince's "Experimental Study of Visions," by F. W. H. Myers, Proceedings S.P.R.,
Vol. XIV., pp. 366 et seq.—ED.

aspects. I regret that the necessary limitations of time will allow only a superficial
treatment here.

peculiarities, and the whole as representing a succession of psychical
events.
This case has been the subject of a continuous study for at least
three years, and has occupied hundreds of hours of time. Now, as the
end of this study comes, to me at least it seems simple, and it is
difficult now to realise the complications that presented themselves
during this long period of time, when there seemed to be no relation
between the one thing and the other ; but the difficulties have been
very great.
I have had from time to time a number of theories regarding the
case. These have been mere working hypotheses, which I have had to
give up one after another ; starting with one, it has fulfilled its part
for a while, and then I have had to give it up, finding it completely
inadequate, until continued study has given what I believe to be the
real solution.
When Miss Beauchamp first came under observation she was a
neurasthenic of a very severe type. She was a student in one of our
colleges, and there received a very good education. But in consequence
of her neurasthenic condition it was simply impossible for her to go on
with her work. She was a wreck, I might say, in body. In tempera
ment she is a person of extreme idealism, with a very morbid New
England conscientiousness, and a great deal of pride and reserve, so
that she is very unwilling to expose herself or her life to anybody's
scrutiny. This has been one great difficulty in the study of her case.
To this I would add that she is a person of absolute honesty of thought
and speech. I feel sure we can rely upon and trust her absolutely and
completely. I have never known her, nor has any one, I believe, known
her,—as herself, or the person whom we call herself, —in any way
to indulge in any deception. Nevertheless, every safeguard has been
employed to guarantee the bond fide character of the phenomena.
Now she came to see me in this neurasthenic state, but I found
treatment was of almost no use. The usual methods were employed
with no result, and it seemed as if her case was hopeless. Finally
I concluded to try hypnotic suggestions. She proved a very good
subject, and the suggestions produced at the time rather brilliant
results. In hypnosis she went easily into the somnambulistic state.
This somnambulistic state came later to be known as B. II., while the
first personality with whom I became acquainted, Miss Beauchamp
herself, was known as B. I. Now I used to notice that as B. II. she
was continually rubbing her eyes ; her hands were in constant motion,
always trying to get at her eyes. Still I paid very little attention to
it, or placed very little significance in this fact, merely attributing it
to nervousness. One day when I hypnotised her and referred to
something that she had done in a previous hypnotic state,—that is to
2 k 2
468 Dr. Morion Prince. [part
say, something that she had said or done in a previous state when
I supposed she was B. II., —she denied all knowledge of it and said it
was not so. This surprised me, and I attributed the denial at first to
an attempt at deception. I waked her up and put her to sleep again,
and this time she admitted what she had previously denied. This
rather puzzled me, and I made various tests to determine her hones^v
in the matter. The next time I hypnotised her she denied what she
had previously admitted, and so it went on, denying and then
admitting, until it dawned upon me that I was dealing with an
entirely different personality, and this proved to be the case. It
turned out that when she went into the state of which she later denied
the facts, she was an entirely distinct and separate person. This third
personality, which then developed, came to be known as B. III. We
had then three mental states, B. I., B. II., and B. III.
B. I. knew nothing of the others. B. II. knew B. I., but no more.
B. III. knew both B. I. and B. II. Thus far there was nothing very
unusual.
Now B. III. has proved to be one of the most interesting of all
the personalities that have developed in the case. In one respect it is
one of the most remarkable personalities, I think, that has ever been
exhibited in any of these cases of multiple personality, as will, I think,
presently appear. B. III., like B. II., was constantly rubbing her
eyes, so that I was frequently compelled to hold her hands by force to
prevent her from doing so. When asked why she did this, she said
she wished to get her eyes opened, and it turned out afterwards that it
was she who was rubbing the eyes of B. II. in the earlier times. At
this time I prevented B. III. from opening her eyes for the reason that
I feared that, if she got her eyes opened and was thereby able to add
the visual images of her surroundings to her mental life as B. III.,
these same images of her surroundings which she would also have, of
course, when she was B. I., would by force of the association awaken
all her mental associations as B. III., and that, in consequence, B. III.
spontaneously would be constantly coming into existence of her own
accord. This afterwards proved to be the case. B. III. always
insisted upon having her eyes opened, complaining that she wished to
see, and had a " right to see." One day, some time after this, when
she was at home, owing to some nervous excitement, she was thrown
into the condition of B. III., and then, I not being there to pre
vent it, she rubbed her eyes until she got them opened, and from
that time to this she (B. III.) has had a spontaneous and independent
existence.
This personality dates her whole independent existence from this
day, and she always refers to events as being " before " or " after she
got her eyes opened." That is the central event in her life, just as
XL.] A Case of Multiple Personality. 469
mothers date periods before or after the birth of a child. Now this
personality came afterwards to be known as Sally Beauchamp. (The
name Beauchamp has been adopted in this account for all the person
alities.) She took the name for fun one day, a name that she got out
of some book, and by that name she has been known ever since. In
character she differs very remarkably from B. I. I would say here
that B. I. is a very serious-minded person, fond of books and study, of
a religious turn of mind, and possesses a very morbid conscientious
ness. She has a great sense of responsibility in life, and with those
who know her trouble is rather sad and depressed in her general
aspect, the latter the result of the general troubles and trials of her
life. Sally, on the other hand, is full of fun, does not worry about
anything ; all life is one great joke to her ; she hates books, loves fun
and amusement, does not like serious things, hates church,—in fact is
thoroughly childlike in every way. She is a child of nature. She is not
as well educated as is Miss Beauchamp, although she reads and writes
English well ; yet she complains constantly that she cannot express
herself easily in writing, but she does it quite well all the same. She
eannot read French or any of the foreign languages which Miss Beau
champ knows, and she cannot write shorthand ; in short lacks a great
many of the educational accomplishments which the other character
possesses. She insists, although of this I have no absolute proof, that
she never sleeps, and that she is always awake while Miss Beauchamp
is asleep. I believe it to be true. Then Miss B. is a neurasthenic,
Sally is perfectly well. She is never fatigued and never suffers pain.
During the first year Sally and Miss Beauchamp used to come and go
in succession. At first whenever B. I. became fatigued or upset from
any cause, Sally was likely to come. The periods during which Sally
was in existence might be any time from a few minutes to several
hours. Later these periods became prolonged to several days. It
must not be forgotten that though Miss Beauchamp knows nothing
of Sally, Sally, when not in the flesh, is conscious of all Miss Beau-
champ's thoughts and doings, and the latter could hide nothing from
her. Curiously enough, Sally took an intense dislike to B. I. She
actually hated h'jr. She used to say to me, " Why, I hate her, Dr.
Prince ! " and there was no length to which Sally would not go to
cause her annoyance. She would play every kind of prank on her to
make her miserable. She tormented her to a degree almost incredible.
While Sally would never do anything to make any one else unhappy,
,she was absolutely remorseless in the way she tormented Miss Beau
champ by practical jokes and by playing upon her sensibilities. For
example, 1 will give a few illustrations. If there is one thing which
Miss Beauchamp has a perfect horror of, it is snakes and spiders.
They throw her into a condition of terror. One day Sally went
470 Dr. Morton Prince. [part
out into the country and collected some snakes and spiders and
put them into a little box. She brought them home and did them
up in a little package, anrl addressed them to Miss Beauchanip, and
when B. I. opened the package they ran out and about the room and
nearly sent her into fits. In order to get rid of them she had to
handle them, which added to her terror. Another joke was to take
Miss Beauchamp out into the country when she was very tired, and in
an unfit condition to walk ; that is, Saily would take a car and go out
six or seven miles into the country to some retired place, and wake up
Miss Beauchamp, who would find herself far out in the country with
no means of getting home, no money in her pocket, and nothing for it
but to walk. She had to beg rides when she could from passing
waggons, and come back tired, worn out, used up for a week.
A great friend of Miss Beauchamp, to whom she felt under strong
obligations, had asked her to knit a baby's blanket. She worked on
that blanket for nearly a year ; as fast as she would get it near com
pletion, Sally would unravel it, and then, like Sisyphus, she would have
to begin the task again, and regularly every time Sally would pull the
whole thing to pieces. Finally she came to herself one day and found
herself standing in the middle of the room tied up in a perfect
network and snarl of worsted yarn ; it was wound round the pictures
and then round and round the furniture, the bed, the chairs, herself,
and she had to cut it to get out of the snarl. Another favourite joke
of Sally's was to make Miss Beauchamp lie. She had the power when
she pleased, of producing aboulia, and also of making B. I. say and do
things against her will ; for after a fashion she can get control of her
arms and legs, and of her tongue.
Sally made her tell most frightful fibs. For instance, when asked
who lived in a small squalid little house at the side of the road, she
said " Mrs. J. G.," a very prominent lady in society, and very wealthy.
" Why, I thought she was rich ! " " Oh, yes, but she has lost all her
money now." Miss Beauchamp would be mortified at hearing herself tell
these astounding bare-faced fibs, which her listener must know were fibs,
but she could not help it. Again, for a time at least, Sally put B. I. on
an allowance of five cents a day. She would find the money waiting
for her in the morning on the table with a note' saying that it was her
allowance for the day and she could not spend more. Sally took away
her postage stamps, and if Miss Beauchamp wrote a letter it had first
to be exhibited to Sally, and if Sally approved it, it was posted ; if not,
it did not go, and that was the end of it. Miss Beauchamp is a person
with a great sense of dignity, and dislikes anything that smacks of a
lack of decorum or of familiarity. Sally had a way of punishing her
by making her sit on a chair with her feet upon the mantelpiece.
B. I. could not take her feet down, and was mortified to think she had
XL.] A Case of Multiple Personality. 471
to sit that way. Sally carries on a correspondence with Miss
Beauchamp, writes letters to her pointing out all the weak points of her
character, dwelling on all the little slips and foibles of her mind, telling
her all the reckless acts and secret thoughts, indeed, everything she has
done that won't bear criticism. In fact, when she has a chance to
stick a pin into her, she does it. When Miss Beauchamp wakes in the
morning, she will find pinned up on the wall of the room verses con
taining all sorts of personal allusions, letters calling her names, telling
fictitious things that people have said about her ; in short, doing
everything imaginable to make her life miserable. Nevertheless, at
times when she goes too far, Sally has got frightened, and then she
would write me a letter and ask for help, saying that she " could not
do anything with Miss Beauchamp, and I really must help her."
One of the most interesting problems is, who is Sally 1 My original
theory about Sally was that she represented an earlier period of B.I.'s
life. From Sally's childlike peculiarities, which gave the impression of
a girl of about thirteen or fourteen, in connection with certain other
evidences of a more mature mind, I arrived at this conclusion, and
thought that probably some accident had happened in her life which
had split her off from the main consciousness, and that Sally was a
reversion to that early period ; but this theory I was obliged later to
give up. Sally as an individuality goes much further back than this :
she goes back to early infancy, and has grown with the growth of Miss
Beauchamp. The theory which finally, I think, has been demonstrated,
is that Sally represents the subliminal consciousness.
Although B. I. knows nothing of Sally, Sally not only is conscious
of Miss Beauchamp's thoughts at the moment they arise, but she is
capable, as I have said, of controlling her thoughts and her arms and
legs and tongue to a certain extent. Sally can produce positive and
negative hallucination in B. I. and frequently does so for a practical
joke. During the times when Sally is in existence, B. I. is,—as Sally
puts it,—" dead," and these times represent complete gaps in Miss
Beauchamp's memory, and she has no knowledge of them whatever.
" What becomes of her 1 " Sally frequently asks. Sally is never " dead."
Her memory is continuous ; there are no gaps in it. She not only
knows,—simultaneously, as I said,—all of B. I.'s thoughts and emotions
and sensations, but more than that ;— Sally's thoughts are entirely
distinct from and independent of B. I.'s thoughts, with which they are
co-existent, but not identical. B. I.'s thoughts are not Sally's thoughts.
Sally's thoughts co-exist alongside of and simultaneously with B. I.'s ;
but Sally's mental life is made up of entirely different and separate
thoughts and feelings from B. I.'s, so that Saily will have a train of
thought at the same time with B. I., of an entirely different nature.
All this is also true of the relation of Sally's mind to that of the third
472 Dr. Morton Prince. [part
personality—B. IV.—who came later, excepting that Sally does not
know B. IV.'s thoughts. While either Miss B. I. or IV. is thinking
and feeling one thing,—is depressed and self-reproachful, for example,—
Sally is feeling gay and indifferent and enjoying Miss B.'s discomfiture
and perhaps planning some amusement distasteful to her.
Speak to either B. I. or B. IV. and Sally hears you. Say something
that Sally alone understands, and you see her smile. She is as much
alive as the other consciousness. The only difference is this, that her
consciousness for the time being is not in connection with the body.
Then Sally remembers things in the past that B. I. knows nothing
about at all, things that she apparently never was conscious of, or
which she has completely forgotten. The most remarkable part of
Sally's personality, I think, is that she has been able to write out for
me her autobiography, beginning with the time when she was in her
cradle, which she remembers. She actually describes her own thoughts
and feelings as distinct from B. I.'s all through her childhood, up to
and including the present time ; although, as she says, she never got an
independent existence until she "got her eyes open." She remembers
her cradle, draws a picture of the bars in its sides, and remembers what
she, as distinct from Miss Beauchamp, thought at the time when she
was learning to walk. Then B. I. was frightened and wanted to go
back, but Sally was not at all frightened and wanted to go ahead. She
describes B. I. as having had a butterfly mind as contrasted with her
own. She, as a small child, disliked the things that B. I. liked and
vice versa. She describes her school life, her own feelings when B. I
did things, and the different sensations of the two selves when, for
example, B. I. was punished and felt badly, and she herself was
entirely indifferent and without remorse. Thus I have been able to
get an actual autobiography of a subliminal consciousness, in which are
described the contemporaneous and contrasted mental lives of two
consciousnesses, the subliminal and the dominant, from early infancy to
adult life. In this Sally has described for me various scenes and
incidents which occurred and which she saw during her early life, but
of which Miss Beauchamp is entirely ignorant. These usually represent
scenes which occurred while B. I. was absorbed in thought, but which
Sally as a subliminal noticed. Taking all this into consideration,—
taking the present relations of Sally's thoughts to Miss Beauchamp's
thought, and many other facts, like automatic writing, which Sally
performs with ease, and uses for purposes of correspondence,—I think
we are safe in saying that Sally is the subliminal consciousness, which
has become highly developed and organised and obtained finally an
independent existence, and led an individual life of its own.
After Sally's escape from her mental Bastille, the two went on
leading their independent lives, coming and going for a year or two,
XL.] A Case of Multiple Personality. 473
until one day, June 7th, 1899, an event occurred which had an influence
upon the whole history of this case. To understand it, it is necessary
to go back six years, to the year 1893. It appeared that in 1893 Miss
Beauchamp was in a hospital in a neighbouring city, call it Provi
dence. She had been taken with the fancy that she would like to be a
nurse (it was the passion of her life), and in a fit of idealism she
entered the hospital. One night she was sitting in her room with a
friend, a Miss L., when, upon looking up, she was stertled to see a face in
the window. It was the face of an old friend of hers, a Mr. "Jones," as
we have agreed to call him, whom she had known ever since she was a
small girl, and who had been a sort of preceptor to her. At first she
thought it was a hallucination, but she presently saw that it was a real
person. She then hastily got her friend out of the room, and she
went downstairs and out of the side door, where this person met her.
It appeared that this person was in Providence on his way to New
York, had wandered to the hospital, and seeing the ladder had climbed
it for a joke, and looked into the window. Outside the hospital door an
exciting conversation occurred. It was to her of an intensely disturbing
nature, and gave her a tremendous shock. Perhaps I should say here,—
as I have told so much of the story,—that it was the kind of thing that
upon the ordinary person would not have had much influence, but with
her sensitive and idealistic nature she exaggerated it and gave it an
intensity that an ordinary person would not have given to it. At any
rate, it did give her a violent shock. The surroundings, too, were
dramatic. It was night, and pitch dark, but a storm was coming up,
and great peals of thunder and flashes of lightning heightened the
emotional effect. It was only by these flashes that she saw her
companion. From that time she was changed. She went out and
walked the fields at night by the hour ; she became nervous, excitable
and neurasthenic, all her peculiarities became very much exaggerated
and her character changed ; she became unstable, developed aboulia,
and, in other words, changed into B. I. So that B. I.,—or, more
correctly, Miss Beauchamp modified into B. I.—dates from the
time of that scene outside the hospital that night. Sally, too, who
knows the inmost soul of Miss Beauchamp, says she changed after
that night.
So it follows that the Miss Beauchamp who has been the object of
this study, has been educated in college, and been the solicitude of
many friends, is not properly speaking the original Miss B., but a
modified personality rightfully designated as B. I.
On the afternoon of June 7th, 1899, six years later, Miss
Beauchamp was in my office. She was not in any way noticeably
different from her usual condition. After leaving the office she went
to the public library, as was her custom. In the library she met
474 Dr. Morion Prinee. [past
a messenger, who quite unexpectedly brought her a letter, and this
letter was from the person whom we have agreed to call Jones. The
letter was couched in almost the same language as was his conversation
at the time of the hospital incident in 1 893. It threw her into a very
highly excited state, and she actually saw a vision ;—the scene outside
the hospital with herself and Jones as the actors, and actually saw
herself and him, and saw the flashes of lightning and heard the
thunder, and through it all his voice. Under the influence of this
excitement she went to the reading room, and there had an illusion.
In the evening newspaper she saw my name printed in large letters in
the headlines, in place of that which was really printed, the name of a
relative of mine who had died that morning. Still further upset by
this, she made her way home. It was not until many months after this
that I learned of this scene, or of the hospital episode in 1893, so that
it was long before I found the key to the sequel. (As will appear, if I
had known of it all, I should have been saved many hours and much
labour in the attempt to understand the later psychical developments.)
All I knew then was this. After returning from the library, Miss
Beauchamp was in such a nervous state that I was soon sent for. On
arrival I found her in a very nervous, highly excited condition. She
was unable to sit still ; her limbs were in more or less constant motion.
Her condition was one that I had frequently seen after she had been
exposed to emotional influences. Presently she changed completely.
She became quiet, perfectly natural, talked affably, was very sociable,
and, in fact, seemed to be in a condition in which I had never seen her
before,—more natural in many ways than I had ever seen her, quiet
and calm, and apparently in a perfectly healthy state of body and
mind ; but, to my surprise, I found that she did not know me. She
said I was not Dr. Prince, and when I insisted that I was, she laughed
and took it just as if I was talking nonsense to her,—if I insisted that
I was, well, I could have it so, but she knew I wasn't. She said that
I was perfectly reckless in coming, that I ought not to have come, and
then I discovered that she was under the impression, in fact insisted,
that I had come in through the window. As we were in the fourth
story, it was plain that she was also under an illusion as to the place
where we were. The contrast of these illusions with her normality
in other respects was striking. The scene lasted some little time.
Finally I showed her my name in my watch. She underwent a slight
mental shock. A change came over her. She passed through a brief
period of confusion and then became herself again, but without any recol
lection of what had occurred. The essential points I would emphasise
are that,—besides appearing perfectly normal,—she insisted that I
was Jones, imagined we were somewhere else, that I had come in
through the window, that I ran great risks in coming because of the
XL.] A Case of Multiple Personality. 475
publicity, that I ought not to have done it, and that it was a foolish
tiring to have done. Being ignorant of the preceding events just narrated,
it was not clear at first whether this was simply Miss B. under an
illusion, or whether it was a new personality similarly affected.
To cut a long story short (for it took a long time to unravel the
mystery), it turned out to be a new personality, who had at this moment
waked up, and had gone back six years in her life, and now imagined
it was the same night and she was in the same room in the hospital
where she had seen that face in the window in 1893. The impetus to
her awakening had evidently been given by the shock of the letter and
the vision in the library a few hours before ; awakening she went
on with her life where she had left off, with the last vestige of memory,
which was seeing Jones at the window. Under the influence of this
suggestion (she and B. I. are very suggestible) she mistook me for
Jones, and, having seen him, as she thought, a moment before (really
six years previously) at the window, inferred I had entered by that
means. The impropriety and unwisdom of it all was a natural thought.
This new personality became known in these studies as B. IV.
The next time I saw B. IV. she was free from all illusion, but I
was struck by her formal and distant attitude. It soon transpired that
she did not know me or the consulting room, where B. I. had been
time and again. In fact she knew absolutely nothing of the events of
the past six years, knew nothing of B. I.'s life in college, knew nothing
of the friends whom B. I. had made during these years, knew nothing of
me, knew nothing of any of these events whatsoever, nor later, after she
was domiciled as one of the Beauchamp family, did she know anything
about the present times when B. I. or Sally was present. From this it
follows that she knew, and continued to know, nothing of either B. I.
or Sally, or that there ever were such personalities.
It took her a long time to accommodate herself to the new order of
things and to take up the thread of events. Like Rip Van Winkle,
she did not know that the world had moved since she went to sleep.
Sally, who was invaluable as an informer, used to report that she
seemed to live in the past and used to speak to people as if it was still
1893. So the family now was increased by one, and there were three
who kept changing with one another.
B. IV. is a very different character from either Sally or Miss
Beauchamp. A study of the different habits of thoughts, tastes and
emotions of these three people has thrown, I believe, much light upon
the psychology of character, but in this report I must limit myself to a
mere outline of events. There were, of course, gaps in the memory of
B. IV. (as with B. I.) corresponding to the time of the existence of the
other two personalities. But this B. IV. was never willing to admit.
Unlike the others, she is irritable and quick-tempered, and resented as
476 Dr. Morton Prince. [pakt
an impertinence—especially as she regarded most of us as strangers—
any inquiry into her private thoughts and affairs, and above all any
interference with her habits of life and private conduct. Though
anxious to know, she was not willing to ask about what had occurred
in the gaps when the others were in the flesh, and so was in the habit
of inferring and guessing, at which she was very skilful. She was, as
stated, even unwilling for a long time to admit that there were gaps,
but it was easy to convict her here by a few questions. After fibbing
and inferring and guessing, she would break down and confess she did
not know, which was the fact.
Now, Sally, although her mental life is also continuous during that
of B. IV. (as with B. I.) an *. although she knows everything B. IV.
does at the time she does it, hears what she says, reads what she writes,
and sees what she does, nevertheless Sally does not know B. IV.'s
thoughts. Herein is a very interesting psychological distinction
between Sally's relation to B. I. and to B. IV. She knows B. I.'s
inmost soul, she can only 'nfer B. IV.'s thoughts from what she says
and does. But Sally studied her closely and soon discovered for herself
that B. IV. knew nothing of the past six years, but was always
secretly trying to obtain infer mation, and guessing. Sally, in her
astonishment, used to say " Why, she doesn't know anything, she is
always fishing and guessing." For this reason, Sally, until she learned
to know B. IV. better, had a great contempt for her, and dubbed her
the " Idiot," and whenever after this she spoke of her, it was as the
"Idiot." From this time on, Sally transferred her hatred from B. I. to
the " Idiot." She came to regard B. I. as rather a poor sort of creature
and hardly worthy of her consideration anyway, and let her alone ;
but B. IV. became the object of her attacks. But B. IV. is more
than a match for Sally, who is really afraid of her. They quarrel like
cats and dogs. One of the most curious and puzzling things was the
cause of Sally's hatred of B. I. It was unmitigated jealousy. She
was jealous of the attentions B. I. received, jealous of the fact that
people liked B. I. and wanted to keep her in existence instead of
herself, and therefore— -difficult as it is to conceive of a person
jealous of herself—Saily was immensely jealous of herself.
I have said that B. IV.'s memory ceases at Providence with
seeing the face in- the window. She can tell you nothing after that,
and knows nothing of the scene outside the door. Both B. I. and
Sally recall and describe similarly that scene, but the last thing B. IV.
remembers is the face at the window a few minutes before.1 As one
method of corroboration of these events, I produced in B. IV. a crystal
1 The lack of this knowledge was afterwards thi' cause of much trouble to B. IV.,
which was strong evidence of her ignorance.
XL.] A Case of Multiple Personality. 477
vision.1 I gave her a glass globe to look at, and told her to think of
Providence. As she looked into the glass she was horrified to see there
the scene that took place outside the hospital door. She declared with
much excitement that it was not true, that it never had occurred, and
this she repeated again and again, and remonstrated against my
believing it. Like B. I. in the Library, she saw herself by flashes of
lightning standing by the door with Jones. She saw his excited manner,
and heard his voice between the peals of thunder. She saw it all as a
vision, just as it occurred. She was startled by what she saw and
experienced over again all the emotion of the original scene.
I am obliged to omit all reference to the extraordinary misadventures
and misunderstandings of these three personalities brought about in part
by the ignorance of B. I. and B. IV. of each other, and the consequent
conflict of their plans and doings, in part by the difference of the
characters of all three, and in part by the mischievousness of Sally,
who concocted a little Midsummer Night's Dream of her own, and as
Puck (with a little dash of Iago) played her pranks upon both. Some
of these adventures were laughable and some were tragic, as when in
despair Miss B. I. tried to commit suicide by going to bed with the
illuminating gas turned on, and Sally came, jumped out of bed,
opened the window, turned off the gas, and saved Miss Beauchamp's
life.
For some time after B. IV.'s appearance I adopted the theory that
she was the real and original Miss Beauchamp, who had gone to sleep
in 1893 and had now become awakened. It followed from this that
Miss Beauchamp No. 1, whom we had all learned to know and respect,
who had been educated and made many friends, was nothing but a
somnambulistic person, and had really no right to existence. The
situation was a tragic one : a cure meant the annihilation of Miss
Beauchamp, her psychical murder and disappearance as a person, as
much as if she were condemned to physical death. Under this theory
I sought to keep B. IV. and annihilate B. I.
When I came to know B. IV. better, however, it became evident
that this theory was incorrect. However normal she appeared to be
and however much more like the original 1893 Miss Beauchamp than
B. I. she was in some ways, in other respects she was less like her.
Morally and intellectually she lacks many qualities. For instance,
unlike the original, she is quick-tempered (Sally calls it " a nasty
temper "), is devoid of idealism, is unimpressionable ; pictures and
books do not affect her, she hates church and religion, and not onlv
has no love of music, but has lost the power of reading it and playing

,
the violin. So the theory of the re-awakening of the original self was
not substantiated.
This is an important point from the bearing it has on some
hysterical phenomena, and I regret I cannot go into it further here.
When a hysteric is thrown into another state—is awakened, as I with
Sollier would prefer to put it,—and immediately goes back to a day on
which an accident occurred and takes up the thread of her mental life
at that moment, with amnesia for all succeeding events,—does it
necessarily follow that the new state is more normal than the others,
and is the original self 1 I think not.
Now the most interesting and most important question is, what is
the relationship between all the personalities ? What relation do they
bear to the normal personality ;—and for that matter, which is the
normal Miss Beauchamp ; or is any one of them the real and normal
individual 1 Allow me a few moments to sketch,—and it must be
literally to sketch only—a few of the characteristics of B. I. and
B. IV. Sally has been sufficiently emphasised. The continuity of
her memory, her origin in and slow development from early infancy,
her persistence as a subterranean consciousness, while the other
personalities are in evidence, the co-existence of her consciousness
simultaneously with those of B. I. and B. IV., her power to influence
the consciousness of these others, and to act upon their body, the
independence of her thought, her power to express her thoughts
independently in writing during the existence of the other two
persons ;—all this stamps her as a highly developed subliminal
consciousness, who, confined in the chrysalis until 1897, broke out
then and flew away as an independent life.
But B. I. and B. IV., who are they ?
One thing must be insisted upon ;—namely, however normal each
may appear superficially, neither is quite normal. In each are missing
some of the attributes of the original Miss Beauchamp, but in
B. I. the departure from the normal is the least. Her neurasthenic
condition, her aboulia, her extreme suggestibility, by which negative
hallucination can be produced at will, her exaggerated sensitiveness to
emotional influences, like music and religion, which produce certain
psychical phenomena, the dominion which ideas acquire in her mind,
the exaggeration of certain traits always possessed by her, her tendency
to disintegration, by which she at times loses temporarily certain
acquirements, like the French language : these and other peculiarities
are evidence that a certain amount of disintegration took place in 1 893
by which the original personality became fractured and modified.
Nevertheless, it would be an exaggeration to affirm that she is a wholly
new and distinct personality, or that she is a vigilambulist. It is more
correct to say that certain components of her personality have become
xl.] A Case of Multiple Personality. 479
disintegrated from the rest, certain local areas of her brain, as I have
elsewhere put it,1 have gone to sleep. The original self has become
modified into B. I.
B. IV., notwithstanding her greater stability, is a still greater de
parture from the original self. Her character is totally different ; her
general attitude towards her environment has changed, for there is
missing the taste for, that is, the normal reactions to music, literature
and religion. She has also lost her knowledge of music. She has no
emotionability, excepting bad temper ; in short, she has retained some
characteristics, and lost others of the original self.
Now any theory we adopt must explain all this, as well as the
particular forms of amnesia and continuities of memory. The explana
tion which I believe to be the correct one is this : Neither B. I. nor
B. IV. is strictly the original self, nor are they somnambulistic
personalities, but modifications of the original self. The original Miss
B. became disintegrated and as a complete psychical composition de
parted this life in 1893. B. I. and B. IV. are each different disinte
grated parts of the complete Miss Beauchamp. In the disintegration
of the primary consciousness a certain portion split itself off and
became dormant. The remainder persisted as a modified personality—
B. I. Sufficient remained to retain the memories of the past, which
from this time became organised with all future experiences and made
a continuous memory and personality.
The split-off dormant portion was awakened six years later as a
result of an intense excitation of its constituent memories by the
shock in the Library, and in the awakening wrenched away from B. I.
a portion of her mental associations, which thus became common to
both. As in 1893, a certain number of groups of psychical associations,
that now belonged to B. I., remained split off and dormant. Those that
remained awake became organised into another personality as B. IV.
It is as two circles which inter
sect one another. A part of each
circle remains outside the other,
while a part of the field is common
to both.
Thus the dominant part of
B. IV.'s consciousness, being awake
up to 1893, remembers her whole
life until that date ; but being
asleep from 1893 to 1899, she has
no knowledge of the events of this

Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research, Vol. XIV., p. 95.

period. Waking up again suddenly in 1899, she goes back to the day
when she went to sleep, as would any person who had slept an
unusual number of days and nights. Again, B. I. and B. IV. have
no knowledge of B. III., because B. III. is a subliminal. B. I. .and
B. IV. have no knowledge of each other, because the essential
associations of one are asleep when those of the other are in activity.
Another analogy would be that of a beam of white light passed
through a prism and disintegrated into its component rays.
So we may imagine that the catastrophe of 1893 acted like a prism
and split off certain rays of consciousness and left a mutilated
personality B. I.

Let me trace the order of events as illustrated by this theory.
We start prior to 1893 with the original Miss Beauchamp, who has
within her the subliminal consciousness. This subliminal consciousness
during all the early life has no independent existence, but merely the
ordinary relations, as in all of us. Finally, in 1893, a psychical shock
is sustained, the result of which is that her mind is put through a
prism and a certain number of rays are separated from the rest and
are developed into an independent personality as B. I. B. I. exists for
six years. Then, as the result of another psychical shock, a certain
numl)er of these rays of B. I. are disintegrated, rejoin those left hehind
in 1893, and form B. IV. After this, owing to various slighter causes,
these middle rays oscillated backwards and forwards, first joining the
rays of B. IV. and then of B. I. and together making these alternating
personalities.
In 1897, B. III., the subliminal consciousness, became developed
and acquired an independent existence, and became known as Sally ;
so that Sally represents the subliminal consciousness, and B. I. and
B. IV. simply certain disintegrated elements in the primary supernatant
consciousness. The result is that neither B. I. nor B. IV. is the whole
original Miss Beauchamp, but, —if my studies have led me to the
right interpretation,—the original self is a combination of the two.
If this be true, it should be possible to combine them and obtain the
original self.
XL.] A Case of Multiple Personality. 481
All this might be expressed in more technical and more purely
psychological language, but the principles would not be made clearer
thereby, nor would the knowledge of the process be in any way added
to. Disintegration means suppression of function of centres and groups
of centres, and severance of associations between centres. Personality
probably means particular composite groupings of centres by associa
tion processes. A difference in personality probably means a difference
in the composition and grouping.
As to the physiological process, it must be that there exists
normally some kind of physiological mechanism which allows dis
integration to occur, and that normally, within certain limits, such
disintegration is constantly occurring as a part of the mechanism of
normal cerebration. In hysteria this physiological mechanism is
carried to an extreme and pathological degree.
Whatever the anatomical change may be, I am at one with Sollier
in believing it to be the same as normal sleep, only localised.1
To go back for a moment. There remains B. II. ; who is B. II. 1
Now it is possible to hypnotise B. I. and also B. IV., so that both
of these hypnotic states are quasi, but not perfect, personalities.
At first I thought these hypnotic states were separate and distinct,
and the one was called B. II. and the other B. VI. ; but afterwards it
transpired that B. I. and B. IV. hypnotised became the same person,
or B. II. B. II., then, is a part of B. I. and also of B. IV. Some
elements common to them both,—the hypnotic self of both,—in her will
are combined. If you ask who B. II. is, she says : " I am myself,"
or " I am B. I.," or " I am B. IV." or " Both," or " I do not know—
I am both." B. II. knows the thoughts of B. I. and equally knows
the thoughts of B. IV., but B. I. and B. IV. know nothing of B. II.
Now, if the original complete Miss Beauchamp is a total combina
tion of the whole of B. I. and of B. IV., then if we could put I. and II.
together, we ought to get Miss Beauchamp. This I was able to do by
suggestion given to the hypnotic self, B. II., and to obtain the original
self for a number of hours at a time. I suggested to B. II. that when
awake as B. I. she would know all about B. IV., and as B. IV. would
know all about B. I. and feel and think as B. I. did. I then waked
her up successively as B. I. and as B. IV. In each case she knew all
about the times to which I had special reference when I gave the
suggestions. As B. I. she told me what she had been doing as B. IV.,
and as B. IV. what she had been doing as B. I As B. I. she said she
felt like herself in the early days before 1893, as she had not felt
for years, and also knew what she had done as B. IV., which I had

suggested she would remember. So that in her sensations and acquire
ments and memory, she, when thus put together, to all appearances was
the original Jfiss Beauchamp.
This new personality is plainly a composite of B. I. and B. IV. ;
not only in memory, but in character, tastes, and general make-up.
Sally calls her "that new thing," and has very little, if any, control
over her. She herself does not know which she is,—I. or IV.,—but
says she is both. When she is present, Sally tends to sink out of sight
and go back—as Sally puts it— " to where I came from."
This final synthesis,—the construction of what appears to be the
original self,—seems to me akin to a proof of the correctness of the
diagnosis.
I should like to tell something of the way in which the subliminal
self has contributed to the elucidation of some of these problems, by
listening, so to speak, to the thoughts and studying the characters of
these personalities, and reporting her observations ; also of the social
relations of the members of the " family " amongst themselves, and the
extensive controversies carried on by the, subliminal self by means of
automatic writing ; also of the subliminal communicating by speech
when B. I. or B. IV. are in existence, and of the positive and negative
hallucinations created by this self. But these and many other inte
resting phenomena must be left to a more extended report.
There is something unique in studying the laws of the mind
through the intelligent observations of a subliminal self. This is but a
brief sketch, and includes only a few of the salient features of this
study.
By way of Summary, I would offer for discussion the following con
clusions which seem to be justified by this case :—-
(a) The subliminal self may become developed into a true inde
pendent personality, which may be awake contemporaneously with the
primary consciousness, or may be alone awake, the other personalities
being asleep.
(b) Other so-called and apparent personalities may be nothing more
than the primary self, mutilated by disintegration.
(c) The absence of knowledge and hence amnesia on the part of
the primary self of the subliminal is dependent on the normal psycho
physiological arrangements.
(d) The amnesia of one mutilated self for another mutilated self
is due to disintegration and to a severance and rearrangement of
psycho-physiological associations.
xl.] A Case of Multiple Personality. 483
(e) Theoretically any number of personalities are possible,
according to the number and direction of the lines of cleavage.
Each personality would depend on different combinations of different
disintegrated pieces of the normal self.
(/) Personalities may develop accidentally, as the result of
accidental fracture, without design, and not be the result of education.
(g) The subliminal consciousness is not necessarily the equivalent
of the hypnotic self.
(h) Personalities may represent any different psychical compounds.
One may be that peculiar group of psychical elements which is called
the subliminal self, and another may be a disintegrated compound of
the ordinary supernatant self.
(i) Two or more personalities may have successive existences in
time, or when one is the subliminal self they may be co-existent.
(J) Personalities, including the subliminal self, may be hypnotised,
and thus the personalities may become still further disintegrated.
