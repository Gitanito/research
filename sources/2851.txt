PEOPLE
are fascinated by stories of wonders wrought by
Eastern mystics, of their dominion over sin, disease, and
death, over time and space and the physical forces of nature.
Their desire for similar powers is laudable and is proof
in itself that these powers are already theirs, awaiting de
velopment.
Encouragement may be found in realizing that all beings
proceed from the One and Only Cause, and that those who are
performing the greatest works did not reach that stage of
Spiritual evolution without patient, persistent effort. Christ
Jesus, the great Master, taught that what He did it was pos
sible for all to do. Money cannot procure this power.
The study of vibrations, diet, breathing, or physical con
ditions alone has never made, nor ever will make, a Master or
a Spiritual healer.
The great essential is the right understanding of man's
absolute unity with his eternal Source. Through this under
standing Christ Jesus and every advanced Master have been
enabled to accomplish mighty works.
It is claimed for the Sunray Lessons that they throw new
light on the vital point of man's oneness with God, and their
charm lies in the simplicity in which this apparently obscure
subject is presented.
The understanding of the multiplication table is neces
sary to the correct demonstration of mathematics. So is the
right understanding of man's relationship to God necessary in
the demonstration of spiritual healing, and the triumph over
mortal discords and physical limitations.
The Sunray Lessons present an infallible basis for both be
ginners and advanced students to work upon. They reveal a
light which if closely and persistently followed will lead to
supreme heights of wisdom and power.
For nearly half a century the author has studied this sub
ject and practiced the truth in healing the sick and teaching the
healing gospel, thus enabling hundreds of students to do the
same work. In joyful anticipation of still greater results, this
book is launched in America.
God and Man Are One
IT
WAS once said to a young student of divine science, "I
don't believe there is a God, do you?"
The student answered, "Yes, I do."
"Then tell me, how do you know that there is a God?"
asked the other.
After a moment's reflection the student replied, "I think,
therefore I am. I am conscious of my existence. I know that I
am. I also know that because I exist there must be a Cause for
my existence, and whatever that Cause
is,
Iclaim that
It
is
God."
This was
a
wise answer embodying deeper wisdom than
the young student realized at the time he gave
it.
It
embodied
the absolute truth, "Because God
is
I
am, because
Iam God is."
What the world
is
needing
is
a
clear understanding of
what God
is,
and where God is.
It
may not be that the world
is
seeking or desiring this understanding, but that does not alter
the fact that
it
is
the great need of the world. Man's desires are
not always his needs, there
is
often
a
vast difference between
the two. Mankind's view
of
God influences the individual for
harmony or discord.
It
affects the welfare of cities and coun
tries, and influences the government of nations.
If
man believes
in
God at all, he cannot help forming some concept of
It.
Differ
ent nations may label their concepts of God by different names.
In
reality God
is
First Cause, of which all creation
is
the pro
ceeding forth, whether First Cause be called Law, Jehovah,
Allah, Spirit, Divine Principle, God, or any other of the numer
ous titles given to It.
In
the present day wild rush for pleasure, excitement and
material gain, the majority of people do not pause to consider
the most vital of all subjects
in
relation to human welfare.
II
12 SUNRAY LESSONS IN DIVINE SCIENCE
Upon the true understanding of what and where God
is,
the
salvation of mankind from sin, disease, poverty, old age and
death depends. Few, however, pause to ponder the vital
subject while swayed by the intoxication of sensual pleasures,
feverish excitement and wordly success. While the avaricious
accumulation of wealth, and mad ambition for personal power
and control dominates men and women, they seldom pause even
to wonder what and where God
is,
and certainly not long enough
to study the greatest subject
in
the world.
In
times of affliction,
tragedy, bereavement and death,
in
times of sorrow, distress
and woe, men and women instinctively turn to that mysterious
something they may even
in
a
vague way believe in, and deem
to be
in
some way superior to themselves, and able,
if
willing
to help and save. How unwise to leave the search for God un
til
the hour of desperation, even though we have heard that
"man's extremity
is
God's opportunity." To know God should
be the first consideration, and the foremost effort of mankind.
Now, many are still satisfied with the old teaching of orthodoxy,
and think of God as
a
man-shaped personal being, capable of
love or wrath, of giving or taking, doing or not doing just as
he pleases. That God
is
a
man-shaped being with human parts
and passions, capable of bringing affliction and destruction on
His creatures,
is
a
poor model to be held
in
man's thought. Such
a
belief must result
in
discordant physical conditions, family
relationships, and national governments. Man believes himself
to be the likeness and image
of
such
a
God, and "as
a
man
thinketh
in
his heart so shall
it
come to pass." To teach man
that he
is
the image and likeness of
a
wrathful, vengeful god,
a
god who afflicts and destroys,
is
to license him to indulge
in
like
evil passions and acts, and thus rupture the brotherhood
of
man
from the start. The solidarity of the race depends upon
brotherly love. Universal brotherly love seems
a
far off hope,
while God
is
believed to be the reverse
of
Love, and man the
likeness and image of such
a
god. One has no objection to any
one having such
a
belief about God
if
it
satisfies him, but one
regrets that anyone still believes that heaven
is
a
place located
GOD AND MAN ARE ONE 1 3
in the heavens, and God a person of human parts and passions
who abides there, listening to his supplicatory prayers, granting
or refusing them as he sees fit. There is no such place as the
local heaven just referred to, no man-shaped god can therefore
be in a place which does not exist. How then can prayers be
heard and answered by this god who never was, hence never
lived in an imaginary heaven in the sky? If God is Omni
presence, which means that which is never absent from every
where, how can God be a personal shape in a certain locality?
Is it possible for a human shape to completely fill endless
space? A little thought and reasoning will prove that God is
entirely different from what God has been supposed to be, and
is still believed to be, by the great majority. Men and women
shrink from exposing glaring ignorance upon important sub
jects. Is it not a wonder, then, that those who still claim that
God is a personal being reigning in a certain locality, called
heaven above, do not blush at such ignorance as that displayed
when claiming and arguing for such a god and heaven? In this
day of advancing secular education, it is not uncommon for
children to point out to their parents that there is no heaven in
cloud-land. Their lessons on astronomy have taught them
enough to show that there is no sky canopy overhead above
which exists a city called Heaven, where reigns a personal god.
They know that beyond the mists and vapours which sport in
fantastic cloud effects is endless space. Children can show their
parents and pastors the fallacy of these religious views, and
rightfully demand a satisfactory explanation of what and where
God is. What have parents and pastors to give in place of their
exploded theories? Unless a satisfying explanation be given
upon these vital issues, what will be the fate of these children
in after life? Will they cease to think of supernal things alto
gether, or will they join the ranks of those who say "there is no
God, no heaven, no hereafter."
The record of creation, in the first chapter of Genesis, has
been misunderstood. Through reading it in a literal sense,
thousands of people have grown dissatisfied and discouraged.
14 SUNRAY LESSONS IN DIVINE SCIENCE
Many have turned sarcastically away, and claim to have be
come godless, believing in neither God, heaven, nor immortal
ity. "Why," they argue, "would you ask people to believe a
statement of creation which tells that the earth and man were
created in a short six thousand years ago ? Excavations into the
bowels of the earth reveal to us coal mines, which indicate to us
that giant forests flourished there tens of thousands of years
before your God is stated to have created the earth, and man.
Beds of limestone and shell deposits discovered beneath the
earth's surface, reveal to us that old oceans tossed and tumbled
there millions of years before your supposed creation of land
and water six thousand years ago. Ancient remains of animals
and men bear mute testimony across the span of hundreds of
thousands of years, that animals and humans inhabited this
earth in those ages past. We cannot believe your story of
creation," argues the agnostic. "We cannot believe a record of
creation which tells of plant life flourishing before the sun was
created."
Through the ages old theology has held men in igno
rance. Blindly men and Women have accepted false conclu
sions, false interpretations. Steadily physical science has been
undermining false teachings, and weakening creed and dogma.
The result has been a breach between orthodoxy and the claims
of physical science. The claims of physical science have un
dermined the erroneous teaching of a local heaven in the sky.
With the disappearance of a mythical heaven has disappeared
the possibility of there being a personal God, with Jesus at His
right hand, seated on a throne in the clouds above, with winged
humans called angels flying around.
The day has come, however, when science and religion can
unite, and the teaching of divine science makes this possible.
By realizing the spirit of the Bible, as taught in divine science,
by looking past the letter, particularly in the story of creation
as recorded in Genesis I, a clear understanding of truth is
gained. Man and the universe are proved to be spiritual, and
matter nothing but a false sense. This divine understanding of
COD AND MAN ARE ONE 1 5
the Bible reveals a logical spiritual meaning of creation, man,
and the universe, of which the letter of the story is but the sym
bol. Through this spiritual understanding, science becomes
Christian, and Christianity becomes science—the two become
one. Old ignorant theological teachings are demolished, under
standing takes the place of superstition, fear gives place to glo
rious confidence born of man's realization of his inherent great
ness as the manifestation of God, Who is Love, and Wisdom.
He who gives something superior in place of that which
he removes is a more valuable helper than he who tears down
and does not replace with something better. We are all familiar
with the Bible text, "God is Love," yet most people have failed
to grasp the absolute meaning of that statement. They have
believed the statement to mean that God is a dear loving God,
instead of grasping the absolute fact that God is Love Itself.
How many have realized that God is not something which lives
a life, but is infinite Life Itself? How many have realized that
God is not a being Who thinks and reasons with a mind, Who
possesses an intelligence, but that He is absolute Intelligence,
absolute Mind Itself? How many realize that God is that which
is more than a good God, but that God is Good Itself? How
many realize that God is infinite Spirit Itself, and not merely a
spiritual being? God does not possess Life, Spirit, Mind, Love,
Good, for Cod Is. God is All, Itself. It must be understood that
because God is the absolute Itself, care should be taken to ex
press that thought correctly, then one would never refer to God
as a God, a Life, and one would not say "God's Life," "God's
Love," but rather "the Life that is God," "the Love that is
God." God is the Absolute, God is divine Love, unconscious of
mortal passions and sensuality, so often mistakenly called Love.
Now this concept of God clears thought of the belief of God as
a personal human-shaped being, and shows God to be Absolute.
The Christian uses the name God for that infinite Source, or
First Cause which different nations call by different names.
When using the term God, one must guard against force of habit
in thinking of a personal being. Whether we say Creator, Life,
16 SUN RAY LESSONS IN DIVINE SCIENCE
Spirit, Love, Truth, Good, God, or infinite Mind, we mean the
Absolute Cause and Creator from which man and the universe
proceed. God is also divine Principle, He is Omnipresence, Om
nipotence, Omniaction, Omniscience Itself. This is understood,
as all Presence, all Power, all Action, all Wisdom. The Absolute
All. If there were no more to be said about God very little
satisfaction would be gained by the student or patient. He
would probably feel adrift, and wonder how he ever could
reach God, or approach anything so intangible. "Where can
such a God be, and how can He be reached?" he would ask.
Just here it is necessary to briefly consider what man is. God's
creation, man, is perfect, he is good, he is eternal. No matter
how mortal appearances make men seem to be evil, wretched,
sick and dying, the fact remains that man in his true being is
perfect and eternal. He must be so, for God's work cannot be
altered, and He made and pronounced man "good," "very
good." Gen. I. "Judge not according to the appearance, but
judge righteous judgment." John 7 : 24. Appearances say man
is corporeal, carnal, mortal. Truth shows him to be divine. Man
as the likeness and image of Spirit is spiritual and perfect; as
the likeness and image of Life and Love he is eternal and loving,
for nothing can alter God's creation. Now, man is not a material
frame with a mind and life within it which must some time
escape from that frame. Man, because he is the expression and
manifestation (likeness and image) of Spirit, is a perfect
spiritual eternal being here and now, he is God in manifestation.
He is a ray of eternal Life, a ray of infinite Love, a ray of divine
Mind. Now, as a sunray is at-one with the sun, so God and
man are at-one, they are distinct from each other, but never
separate, even as the sun and its rays are ever distinct from each
other but never separate. Just as the sun would be nothing, or
nonentity without its rays, which express and manifest
it,
so
would God, the eternal First Cause, be nonentity without man,
who expresses and manifests It. Just as the sunrays would be
nothing or nonentity without their source, the sun, so would man
be nonentity without God, his eternal Source, from which he can
COD AND MAN ARE ONE 17
never be separate though he is forever distinct. This conscious
at-one-ment with God is what all the world needs to know. It
is the power that will solve mankind's problems. "As a man
thinketh in his heart so is he." Prov. 23 : 7. While man believes
he is separate from God, his thinking will not have the con
structive power that follows the knowing and feeling that God
and man are at-one. It will not result in the same degree of
bodily perfection that follows conscious one-ness with God.
Once a sick man sought help from a divine science healer,
who at once saw that the sooner the patient was shown the
truth about man and what he really is as the manifestation of
God, the better it would be for him. The patient, who was a
level-headed business man, said that since his Sunday school
days—forty-five years before —he had not bothered to think
about God. When pressed he admitted that the conception of
God he held was of an elderly man in the sky, just as he had
been taught in boyhood to think of God. The practitioner
commenced to teach the patient the truth, and explained things
to him on the lines just shown in this article. Much patience
was required to clear his thought somewhat from the old false
teaching, and lead him to some understanding of the truth
about God and man. In order to establish the truth of man's
one-ness with Life eternal, the practitioner related a simple
fable which had upon hundreds of occasions served her in
successfully establishing a clearer concept of the at-one-ment
of God and man, in the consciousness of her patients and
students. This is the fable as she told it to her patient.
"Once upon a time, long long ago, the old sun was rayless.
Because he had no rays he was unexpressed, or unmanifested,
and therefore was useless, or was a nonentity. So the rayless sun
said within himself, 'Well, well, here am I containing within my
self all the quality of marvellous energy, brightness and glory,
within my own selfhood is included this wondrous quality, and
energy, but because I am unexpressed, unmanifested I am use
less.' The rayless sun determined that he would express and
manifest himself, that he would express his glorious inherent
18 SUNRAY LESSONS IN DIVINE SCIENCE
quality of energy force, light, heat and beauty. So the old sun
sent from himself millions of expressions, which were distinct
from him, but not separate from him, ana he called them rays.
These rays were the sun's internal quality expressed. From the
center of his being the old sun spoke to his rays, saying, 'Ah,
ah, my beautiful rays, no doubt you think that you are separate
from me, but you are mistaken if you so believe, for you are all
at-one with me. You are all distinct from me, but not separate
from me. Nor are you separate from each other, little rays, for
you are all united in me, you are at-one in me. You are distinct
from each other, but never separate from each other, nor from
me. Now, little rays, remember that nothing can ever separate
you from me, and nothing can part me from you, for we are
eternally at-one. From me you derive your very being, for I
am your endless, inexhaustible source. Every quality and power
you possess you derive from me. Now, little rays, I would have
you know that you depend upon me for all you are, all you
have and do, without me you are nothing, nonentity. Also know,
beloved rays, that I am dependent upon you for my manifestation,
that without you I would be nonentity. Know that I am dependent
upon you for my manifestation, while you depend on me for your
being and existence. We are indispensable to each other. We
are in eternal conjunction. We are at-one, all in all. So now
go and express the brightness of my glory, the power of my
energy, manifest my inherent quality forever.'
"
"That is a wonderful illustration," said the patient.
"Material illustrations are ever inadequate to fully pre
sent spiritual facts," said the practitioner. "They are always
open to criticism. Nevertheless, we must do our best with them,
even as Jesus did when he spoke in parables." Remember the
sun and its rays are material things, while God and man are
Spirit and spiritual, eternal mind and Its Manifestation. I have
found the sun and its rays the most effectual illustration I
could use to bring my students and patients to realize the
absolute union between God and man. Know that God is eternal
Life Itself, Spirit, Love Itself, and that man is God in manifesta
COD AND MAN ARE ONE 19
tion, as close to God as a sunray is to the sun, as inseparable
from God as the ray from the sun. Know that man is dependent
upon God, without Whom man would be nonentity, while with
out man, His expression and manifestation, God would be non
entity. The sun and its rays are not omnipresence, but God is
Omnipresence and man manifests Omnipresence, which has no
beyond, nothing is outside of It. Omnipresence is never absent,
it destroys absence, separation, time and space, and proves
Here and Now to be the Reality.
"Do you mean that I am the very manifestation of God
Itself?" asked the patient in a hesitating, awesome tone, "that
without me God would not be God?"
"I do," answered the practitioner. "I mean that God and
man are at-one. Christ Jesus well realized this one-ness when
he said, 1 and my father are one." Jo. 10:30. He knew the
true meaning of at-one-ment. He knew, as we shall all know,
that all men are related to God in the same way."
"What a great and wonderful being man is in reality.
How different from what I thought him to be," said the patient,
as he left his practitioner's presence with new hope born within
him.
God is Life, Love, Truth. God is Spirit, Substance, Mind.
God is Omnipotence, Omnipresence, Omniscience, Omniaction,
and man is the very manifestation of God, the infinite All. He
is the infinite Effect of infinite Cause. When the understanding
of the one-ness, the union, of God and man is understood, man
can intelligently pray as though he has already received, and
cease supplicating a far-away God to answer his prayers. In
deed he cannot supplicate and pray to a far-away being when
he knows how close he is to God, who has already created with
in him all good, and how close God is to him. He will understand
the meaning of the Scripture —'Before they call I will answer.'
Isa. 65:24.
God is infinite, Cause, Spirit, expressing Itself in its cre
ation. God cannot be sought and found without man being
found, for the two are one. God First Cause, is not in Its effect.
20 SUNRAY LESSONS IN DIVINE SCIENCE
God is not in man, to believe that God is in man would limit
God, but He is infinite. God is not within man as a separate
entity. God is not in man as a light might be in an electric
globe. Many who have studied divine metaphysics for a length
of time still claim that God is related to man as an electric light
is related to the globe it is in. Man is closer to God than this.
The sun does not abide within the rays, it is manifest or ex
pressed by and through them. They are not tubes through which
it flows. They are it manifesting. The sun is manifested by and
through the rays. Likewise God, eternal Life and Love, is mani
fested by and through man. Thus is God, Who is all Power,
made manifest by and through man, thus is infinite Action
made manifest by and through man. There is no other power
than this one only Power, no other Action, but this one only
Action. No other Life but this one only Life—which is Spirit,
and is made manifest by and through Its creation, man and the
universe. God is absolute Good Itself, therefore Its creations
are Good, for the same fountain cannot send forth both sweet
water and bitter. —Jas. 3:11. Evil, disease, sorrow, decay,
failure, death, are not part of God, the perfect only Cause,
therefore these negatives cannot be in man, nor part of man,
who is in the image and likeness of God. There is only one sort
of man in reality. He is God in manifestation. He is good.
God is infinite Father Mother. This is a statement that
often causes perplexity in the thought of the student. "How is
it possible for God to be Father and Mother at the same time?"
they ask. Of course, if one is still regarding God as a man-like
God, it is impossible to conceive that He can be Male and
Female, Father Mother, at the same time. It is not difficult to
know God as Father Mother when we realize that God is Spirit,
Mind Itself. The teaching that God is Father Mother is not new.
The Mother God was recognized and taught by Hermes, the
ancient. Now, we must realize that in this case Father Mother
are words that stand for two distinct qualities, and not for
material things. Matter or materiality are not to be considered
in connection with them. They are two qualities in one. It is
COD AND MAN ARE ONE 21
not difficult to realize two qualities in connection with or in
herent in the sun. Light and heat are two qualities in one—
distinct from each other, but not separate from each other. It
is easy to think of these two qualities as one in connection with
the sun. Now, it should be just as easy to think of two qualities
in relationship to infinite Mind. It has been shown that God is
Intelligence, Love, Life, Truth. When we speak of God, as
Father, we think of Him as Intelligence, or Truth, and when we
speak of God as Mother we mean Life and Love. God as
Father is infinite Intelligence, God as Mother is infinite Love.
These qualities are two in one—the Father Mother God. God is
the divine Us. In Genesis I. we read that God said, "Let us
make man in our image after our likeness, and let them have
dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air,
and over the cattle, and over every creeping thing that creepeth
upon the earth." Now, because man is the expression and mani
festation (image and likeness) of God, he, too, must be mascu
line feminine. Man as the image and likeness of the creative
Us must be, and in his nature he
is,
male and female.
In
every
child of God, man or woman, are these two divine qualities.
They have nothing to do with mortality, corruption, or corpore
ality. They constitute man's dual divine nature, as the mani
festation
of
the Father Mother God.
In
man, the manifestation
of God, the feminine quality
is
spiritual intuition, and the mascu
line quality
is
intellect and reason. These divine dual qualities
are ever present and operative
in
every child
of
God whether
called man or woman. Each quality plays its part
in
the divine
consciousness.
In
the New Testament they are typified
by
the
Bride and the Lamb, as we read
in
Rev. 19:6, "Alleluia! for
the Lord God Omnipotent reigneth. Let us be glad and rejoice,
and give honour to him
:
for the marriage
of
the Lamb
is
come,
and his wife hath made herself ready." The father represents
the creative, active principle, the mother represents the passive,
conception, principle
in
man.
In each child
of
God
is
the dual nature, working
in
unison
unto "the day of Christ." When the sick seek to understand
22 SUNRAY LESSONS IN DIVINE SCIENCE
divine science for the purpose of being healed, they need not
concern themselves for the time being about the dual nature of
God, or the dual nature of man. This point can come up for
consideration later. To know that God is Love, Life, All Power,
and what man is in reality, is the most necessary thing to
know. These lessons are intended to help those who have
never studied divine science, as well as those who have already
given some time to the study. It is hoped that these lessons
will be useful to students who wish to help their friends to find
the truth, to free them from old traditions and guide them to
an acceptance of the truth which heals all manner of discord
in human experience. The following lessons will enlarge upon
what has been given in this one. It is hoped that those who
read them will do more than scan them over. They need to be
pondered over. Ample confirmation can be found in the Bible
supporting the statements made herein. Jesus the Christ is the
great Example for all to follow. It was His clear understanding
of God and man, of Himself as one with God, that enabled Him
to heal all manner of sickness, overcome all discords, and limita
tions to which humans are subject. Through this understanding
He was able to triumph over all material forces. He raised the
dead and finally overcame death Himself. All this He did be
cause He was fully conscious of His greatness as the manifesta
tion of God and because He knew His one-ness with God. He
said, "I and my Father are One." For this He was stoned.
Then He said to those who tormented Him because He claimed
one-ness with God, "If I do not the works of my Father, be
lieve me not. But if I do, though ye believe me not, believe
the works: that ye may know and believe that the Father is
in me and I in Him" —John 10:37, 38. Here is proof that our
faith should be shown by works. The works of Christ Jesus
can be done in a measure by all who know something of their
God being. But he who knows fully, as Jesus did, that "I and my
Father are One," will do all that He did, even to triumphing
over death. How earnest then should be the search for Truth.
How keen should be the desire to spread the truth and thus
COD AND MAN ARE ONE 23
hasten the day when love and peace shall reign supreme on
earth and among men. "Ye shall know the truth and the truth
shall make you free."
God is infinite divine Principle. Young students are apt
to shrink from this definition of God, for to them it sounds cold
and metallic. This is because they probably have been in the
habit of associating the term "principle" with the material
sciences, and particularly with mathematics and astronomy.
It has perhaps been quite customary to associate the term
"principle" with material science and governing laws. There
fore, the name Principle, when applied to God, repels rather
than attracts the student.
Webster defines the word "principle,
in,
one sense" as "a
source or origin; that from which anything proceeds; funda
mental energy or cause; primordial substance." Webster's defi
nition of the word "primordial,"
is
"a first principle or element."
Now, God
is
Principle, the Principle of man and the uni
verse. God, the Principle of man,
is
Spirit, Love—the Father
Mother God, therefore
is
the Source or Origin from which man
evolves or comes forth.
In
divine science
it
is
understood that
infinite Truth, Love, Spirit,
is
Principle from which man pro
ceeds, and which forever governs and sustains Its creation, man
and the universe.
God
is
infinite Substance. Substance
is
that which stands
under.
It
is
fundamental basic Principle, Love, Spirit. The
primordial element of spiritual creation, man and the universe,
is
Spirit Principle, Substance, not material force, energy, vibra
tion or ether.
God, Spirit, Principle, Love,
is
infinite First Cause, and
man
is
the spiritual infinite effect, of infinite First Cause. Now,
we see that divine Principle
is
Love, the infinite Father Mother
God, Who sustains Its creation, and forever supplies
it
with all
good. In infinite perfect Source
is
no evil, no disease, no death,
hence,
if
these negatives are real they must have another origin,
or creator, than God. God
is
the only Creator, the only Principle,
therefore, evil, disease and death have no cause, no creator.
24 SUNRAY LESSONS IN DIVINE SCIENCE
They are baseless, negatives, belonging not to God, nor to His
perfect creation, spiritual man and the universe. Now, it is clear
that God, Principle, is Love. It is the holy Cause from which all
men proceed. It is perfect, eternal, indestructible Spirit, Sub
stance, from which spiritual creation evolves or proceeds. It is
infallible Law forever governing and sustaining Its creation.
God is the only Life, Spirit is the only Substance, Love is the
only Law.
Man Know Thyself
WHEN
man knows what he
is,
he knows where he
is
in
reality.
It
is
far easier to tell students what man
is
not,
than to teach them what man
in
reality is.
I
commence this
lesson by declaring that man
is
not
in
reality sinful, sickly,
poverty stricken, nor dying. Man
is
not mortal, material, cor
ruptible, mortality. He
is
not destined to die. He
is
not destined
to suffer sin and disease because his ancestors suffered them.
He
is
not evil and imperfect. He was never cursed by God.
He
is
perfect, immortal, divine, here and now. His destiny
is
to prove his immortality —to realize his divinity and glorify
his humanity. You may ask, "If this
is
true, why does he
appear so far from perfect?" Because man
is
not understood
to be divine. When the divinity of man
is
understood,
it
will
reveal the kingdom of God on earth. This glorified condition
will be free from sorrow, sickness, sin and death.
"There
is
nothing either good or bad but thinking makes
it
so," said the poet metaphysician Shakespeare. The Scrip
tural statement, "As
a
man thinketh
in
his heart so
is
he,"
is
often glibly quoted.
It
is
difficult, however, to realize that
the power of thought
is
fully appreciated
by
the majority of
those who aptly quote the above wonderful statements, for
man's thinking about himself
is,
as
a
rule far from true, and
is
not productive of harmony.
In
this day men and women freely claim to understand
that thought
is
a
power capable of influencing one's health and
worldly prospects for good or ill. Still
a
greater realization
of the fact, as well as the application
of
it,
is
necessary to bring
out more harmony
in
the world.
It
is
often
a
fund of amusement to hear stories of ignorant
25
26 SUNRAY LESSONS IN DIVINE SCIENCE
natives who, when told by one of their people regarded as an
authority, that they shall die at a certain hour on a certain day,
accept the death sentence, and although in perfect health,
when the sentence is pronounced, will die at the specified hour.
In other cases, to hear of humans who die because a certain
charmed stick is merely pointed at them, is surprising if not
entertaining. Ignorant superstition it may be called, that
would cause healthy men and women to submit to death
through such simple causes. The power of thought is
responsible for the passing on of these individuals. No
physical violence was used. The victims believed they must
die, as directed, while those who by pointed stick or spoken
word ordained the death of their fellows believed in the power
of their word or act to produce death, and so it came to pass.
We regard electricity as a mighty force, and should not fail
to realize that thought force is superior to all so-called material
energies or forces.
What a suicidal mental attitude has been held regarding
man by the majority of the Christian world. I say suicidal
because ignorant and malicious thought force and energy can,
and does, disintegrate and destroy the body. On the other
hand right thought is constructive, and when intelligently ap
plied improves bodily conditions, heals and uplifts mankind.
To understand the power of thought is one thing, the next
thing is to know on what lines to think in order to bring out
harmonious human conditions, and then to consistently think
along those lines.
In my youth it was customary for me to earnestly and
devoutly on bended knee affirm of myself that I was "a
miserable sinner," and that "there was no health in me." Are
not millions of people doing the same thing every day? Such a
mental attitude must of necessity have an
ill
effect upon those
who indulge
in
it,
for "as
a
man thinketh
in
his heart so
is
he."
The opposite and upbuilding thought would be, "I truthfully
and understandingly affirm that
I
am made
in
the likeness and
image of Spirit, the one and only Creator, therefore,
in
my true
MAN KNOW THYSELF 27
being I am perfect, holy, pure and free, because nothing can
alter Spirit's perfect work." Such an animation, or prayer, can be
confidently and honestly affirmed, when man knows what and
where he
is,
and such thought
is
constructive and healing.
It
is
man's necessity, his destiny, to show forth Godlike
powers, as Jesus Christ, man's great and perfect Example, did,
but man will never manifest his Godhood, while thinking he
is
a worm of the dust, and agreeing with such sentiments as ex
pressed
in
the lines "O, to be nothing, nothing." "A few more
years shall roll,
a
few more seasons come, and we shall be with
those at rest, asleep within the tomb." What
a
tragedy
it
seems
when one realizes the power of thought, that people should
thus be mentally making conditions heading towards gloom,
death and decay. To know man's inseparable union with eternal
Life would be the better way of thinking. To know that "the
gift of God
is
eternal Life" will ever encourage and inspire men.
Claiming that man
is
a
clay frame, inhabited by
a
soul, or mind,
is
the reverse of truth, and produces discordant results, mani
fest
in
ill-health. That God has ordained that men shall live
three score years and ten and then die,
is
a
wrong conception
leading towards decay and death. Surely men and women must
be getting more and more disobedient to God's law,
if
He has
so specified and limited man's time to live, for with speed an
ever increasing record
is
appearing
of
those who have long
since passed their one hundredth year,
in
perfect health and
usefulness. Man's life
is
eternal here and now. Individually and
collectively he will yet prove
it,
as Christ Jesus did. The sooner
that humans realize man's true estate as the child of God, and
claim his sonship unceasingly, the sooner will man's greatness
be manifest
in
noble character and blameless living,
in
mighty
words and works, even to the overcoming of death. Those
who have studied the former lesson,"God and man are one" will
better grasp this one. Remember that man, the manifestation
of God, includes every child
of
God whether called man or
woman.
Man
is
immortal because his life
is
undying Life,
it
is
the
28 SUNRAY LESSONS IN DIVINE SCIENCE
eternal God, Who is Life Itself. Man is the manifestation of
undying Life. Think of
it.
Mankind will continue to suffer,
grow old, and experience the death dream, just as long as
it
is
believed to be God's law for man to die, for "as
a
man
thinketh
in
his heart so shall
it
come to pass."
In
spite
of
the
appearance of decay and death man never dies. "Judge not
according to appearances, but judge righteous judgment,"
is
a
scriptural admonition. Righteous judgment
is
to know that
man
is
now spiritual, perfect. All that points to the contrary
about man
is
the "appearance" only, which will fade away,
but man
is
eternal. Man's life
is
undying Life, that cannot
know death.
If
God had created death, death would be as real
and powerful as Life (God) Itself, and Jesus could not have
triumphed over
it
in
His own case, nor could He have raised
the dead. We have His words and example to encourage us to
triumph over death. All the world over men are seeing the
possibility of overcoming the death dream, and are making the
attainment
of
this desired end their goal. Death
is
not
a
God
ordained power or experience, therefore, men and women may
with confidence turn their hopes and hearts towards the attain
ment
of
this goal as
a
present possibility. There
is
much more to
be said upon this point, but the purpose of this series of lessons
is
mainly to lead the student to
a
realization of man's conscious
one-ness with God, for this
is
the most important point in
spiritual evolution. The spiritual understanding
of
what God
and man are, and their eternal unity with each other
is
the first
great step
in
overcoming sickness and sin,
in
attaining the vic
tory over death and presenting the body immortal. Man
is
the
manifestation of undying Life, but how few are fully conscious
of
the fact. Man must become consciously conscious of the fact,
and prove eternal Life as the absolute reality, thus vanquish
ing death.
It
does not matter whether men and women desire
to overcome death and thus prove that man
is
undying,
it
is
a
fact that must be demonstrated some time, somewhere.
It
is
man's necessity to do so. Indeed
it
is
his destiny, to manifest
eternal Life. Sickness, disease, decay, sin and death, are not
MAN KNOW THYSELF 29
created by God, Who created all that ever was created, hence
they are not real, nor eternal ; only good did the one and only
Creator beget. How cheering is this fact, what hope it inspires,
what great possibilities it opens before us !
Now, our last lesson gave to some of us a new concept
of God. It showed that God is not a man-shaped person reign
ing in a city in the sky—it showed that God is the infinite First
Cause from which man proceeds, and that that Cause is eternal
Life, infinite mind, Love, Spirit, Omnipresence, Omnipotence,
Omniscience, Omniaction. It must be realized that man is
infinite Effect of infinite Cause.
As that which comes forth from a source, or cause, must
be of the same nature as the source from which it proceeds, it
is very plain the man must be of the same nature and substance
as his Source. Man instead of being the likeness and image of a
man-shaped God in the sky, is of the same nature and substance
as his Source. He is the image and likeness of Spirit, Mind, Om
nipotence, Omnipresence, Omniaction, Life and Love. See what a
wonderful being man is ! He is the expression and manifestation
of Spirit, Life, Love, almighty Power, of infinite Essence Itself.
Now, by the sunray fable given in the last number, an
attempt was made to show that man, the manifestation of
Spirit, God, is never separate from his Source. That he has his
distinct identity from his Source, but is never separate from
it,
any more than
a
sunray
is
separate from its source, the sun.
This
is
the vital point, dear heart. Grasp
it
clearly. God and
man are at-one, as infinite Cause and infinite effect. God and
man are All
in
All. Man
is
not
a
mortal frame, he
is
spiritual
consciousness. He
is
completely
a
mental being for there
is
not, nor ever was
a
material called matter from which to make
man. All
is
Spirit, matter
is
a
myth —
a
false mental sense.
Remember, that the sun and its rays are merely
a
material
illustration, used to try to convey
a
spiritual fact. Material
illustrations are never adequate to fully portray spiritual facts.
The sun and rays are called material, but God
is
Spirit, Life,
Love, Itself and man
is
It
in
manifestation. God
is
all Presence
30 SUN RAY LESSONS IN DIVINE SCIENCE
(that which is never absent from anywhere) and man is Its
manifestation. There is no outside of, or beyond God Who is
All Presence Itself.
Now, man is God in manifestation. He is God, Spirit's
evolvement of Itself, he
is,
and must be, of the same nature and
quality as his subsistent Cause. Man
is
spiritual consciousness.
He
is
God, Life, Spirit
in
manifestation, and there
is
no separa
tion between man and God.
One who had studied divine metaphysics for some time
called upon
a
divine science healer for treatment for
a
physical
trouble which had not disappeared through her own realization
of Truth.
In
her effort to help the patient the healer asked her
to explain what she believed God to be, and how man
is
related
to God. The patient replied that "God
is
Spirit," and that "man
is
the reflection of God." She was asked
if
she also recognized
that man
is
the expression and manifestation of God. She said
she "preferred to think of man as the reflection of God, and
particularly of herself as
a
reflection of God." When asked how,
as
a
reflection of God, she was related to God, she answered,
"Well, when
I
look
in
a
mirror
I
see myself reflected there. That
which
is
in
the mirror
is
my reflection. Now, as the reflection
in
the mirror
is
myself reflected, so
I
reflect God.
I
know that as
my reflection
in
the mirror reflects me, so do
I
reflect God."
The practitioner remarked,
"I
suppose you realize that
man
is
never apart from God." The patient agreed that she
did. The patient was then asked
if
when she looked at her
reflection
in
the mirror, she had any sense of separation be
tween herself and her reflection
in
the mirror? "Yes," she
said, after some thought,
"I
suppose
I
have, for the mirror
is
over there while
I
am here. There
is
space or separation be
tween me and the reflection
in
the mirror. The feeling
I
hold
about
it
is,
that the reflection
is
there while
I
am here."
The practitioner pointed out that
jt
is
essential to healing
for man to realize his inseparable unity with God. The removal
of the mirror would mean the disappearance of the reflection,
but that the manifestation of God
is
eternally at one with his
MAN KNOW THYSELF 31
Source. That a closer sense of unity is necessary than that
which the patient was apparently holding, when thinking that
"as the reflection in the mirror was her reflection," with a
"separation" or division between them, "so was she God's
reflection." After further discussion the patient saw the point
and before long had gained a clear consciousness of man as the
expression and manifestation of God, and perfect health.
To some students the realization of man, as the expression
and manifestation of God, brings a clearer understanding of
man's unity with God, than is gained from thinking of him as
the reflection of God. This was so in the writer's experience.
Once a teacher of metaphysics said to the writer, "Man is God,
and there is no getting away from that, for instance, if I have
a lump of putty here, and I cut scores, of pieces from
it,
of
which
I
make scores of marbles, every marble
is
putty. The
marbles are all made of putty. Now, man is made of Spirit or
God, so as the marbles are all putty, putty, putty, so man
is
God,
God, God, Mind, Mind, Mind. There you are, you can't get
away from it." The listener could not accept that illustration,
explaining that
in
time the putty would be all used up
in
marbles
and no lump of putty would be left, and that
if
God could be
so divided up
in
man and the universe, there would remain no
subsistent Cause, no God would be left to sustain Its creation.
The metaphysician then argued that "as
a
drop of sea water
is
sea, so man
is
a
part of God and
is
God." He was shown that
"man
is
not
a
part of God." That "if the sea were emptied by
drops no sea would be left," and "if God were all used up
in
Its creations no sustaining Principle (God) would remain to up
hold them." God cannot be divided —God does not become less
through expressing Itself
in
man, any more than the sun be
comes less through expressing itself
in
its rays. God
is
indivisi
ble. Man
is
for ever dependent upon his eternal Source, God
and man are at-one.
Man will always have his own distinct identity, he can never
be
swallowed up in God, or
in
other words, he can never be
absorbed into God.
32 SUNRAY LESSONS IN DIVINE SCIENCE
A student said to his teacher, "I am rather worried be
cause I have a horror of one time becoming absorbed into
Deity, I cannot endure thinking that I shall some time lose my
selfhood or identity by being swallowed up in God."
The teacher said "You never will lose your distinct identity
by being absorbed into Deity."
"How do you make that out," said the patient, "if, as
I have understood, man is at-one with God, as a drop of water
is one with the ocean ?"
The teacher explained, "A drop of the ocean is a drop,
and has its identity as a drop, only by reason of the fact that
it is a particle or portion separate from the main body, and
separation makes it a drop. When a drop of the ocean is again
restored to the ocean, it is no longer a drop, it is then absorbed
into the whole, and loses its own distinct identity as a drop.
Man, as the manifestation of God, is never separate from God,
nor absorbed into God, but ever expresses God. Where God is
man
is,
and where man
is
God
is,
the two
in
one, forever insepa
rable, but forever distinct from each other, as infinite Cause and
infinite Effect." The student was enlightened and comforted
in
realizing that he never had been separate from God, hence
could never lose his own distinct identity by being lost or
absorbed
in
God.
In
the last number, "God and Man are One," reference
was made to
a
patient who visited
a
divine science healer.
In
that case the practitioner strove to bring to the patient
a
reali
zation of the Truth of being, knowing this realization would
aid
in
bringing about his healing from the distressing physical
disease
of
which he complained. The practitioner used a simple
sunray fable
in
order to elucidate her meaning, trying thus to
bring the patient to realize something of his one-ness with
eternal Life, God. The patient was much impressed with the
sunray illustration. He was able to report great physical im
provement during the next few days. Then came
a
day when
he appeared before the practitioner, greatly distressed with
doubt and discouragement, for his physical condition was not
MAN KNOW THYSELF 33
so good. The practitioner did not lose sight of her patient's
real perfect selfhood, as the manifestation of Life, God, as he
poured forth a story of misery. He said, among other things,
"Oh, if ever I prayed to God in my life, I did today—I prayed
for health, for life and peace. I prayed that He would give me
these, that He would help me." The practitioner immediately
saw that her patient had not yet clearly grasped the fact of man's
unity with God, and asked, "Where do you think God is?"
The patient replied as he waved his arms about, "Why
here, all around me, because He is Spirit."
The practitioner said, "Do you suppose that just as a
fish in the sea is all surrounded by water, so you are all sur
rounded by God?"
The patient admitted that he thought so, and asked, "Is
that not right?"
"That is not the correct concept of man's relationship to
God, according to the teachings of divine science," said the
practitioner, "although it is a better concept of God and man
than you had when you still believed God to be a man-shaped
being in the sky—and man a poor, miserable, dust of the
ground sinner on earth. I see by your manner of praying to
day that you have not yet gained as clear an understanding
of man's relationship to God as I wish you to have. This is
nothing to be discouraged about though, for you, with patient
perseverance will gain this understanding, indeed you will."
The patient was then asked to relate the sunray story
which he had been told a few days before. With a little
prompting he told it very will. He was then asked to explain
his conception of the sunray's relationship to the sun. He
said, "I believe that the rays are the very internal quality of
the sun emanating forth from the sun into active visibility.
They are at-one with the sun and without them the sun surely
would be nonentity."
He was then asked if a fish in the ocean is related to the
ocean, as a sunray is related to the sun?
He readily answered, "No, of course not, it makes no
34 SUNRAY LESSONS IN DIVINE SCIENCE
difference to the ocean whether the fish is, or is not. The fish
does not manifest the ocean, but the sunny expresses and
manifests the sun with which it is ever at-one, and upon which
it is dependent. Indeed, I see a wonderful relationship existing
between the sun and the rays in their unity with each other."
The practitioner expressed her approval of the answer
given, feeling that the patient now had grasped more clearly
the important point of man's unity with God, and that he is
indispensable to God.
"I see
it,
I
see it," exclaimed the patient.
"I
see now, what
you have been so patiently trying to convey to me.
I
now realize
more fully that, because of what
I
am, and where
I
am,
I
am
God, the All Good Itself,
in
manifestation.
I
feel vexed," said
he, "that
I
have seemed so dense.
It
seems so simple when
once one realizes the Truth, and knows that All Good
is
already
his, because man
is
the very expression and manifestation of
God. Where God
is
man
is,
for God and man are one." After
a
pause he added,
"I
should say that
in
the sense that the sunray
could be called the sun, man, the manifestation
of
God, could
be called God."
As others had done before, so he also grew to readily
acknowledge that even as Christ Jesus had said,
"I and the
Father are one," yet "My Father
is
greater than I." So he
could honestly claim his at-one-ment with God. He did so with
joy and gratitude. "Be ye therefore perfect even as your
Father
in
heaven
is
perfect," said Christ Jesus. "Let this mind
be
in
you which was also
in
Christ Jesus who being
in
the form
of God, thought
it
not robbery to be equal with God," said St.
Paul (Phil. 2:5).
The state of exaltation which follows man's realization of
his true status as the offspring of God,
is
balanced
by
his con
scious humility when realizing his absolute dependence upon
God, his Source, for without his infinite Source, man would be
nonentity. "He that humbleth himself shall be exalted."
Man
is
not material, he
is
not clay nor corruption. Man
is
the expression and manifestation
of
Spirit. Man
is
eternal be
MAN KNOW THYSELF 35
cause he manifests eternal Substance, which embraces no ele
ment of decay, corruption or mortality.
Man never dies because he is the manifestation of eternal
undying Life.
In awakening from the false teachings of the past, one
need not be discouraged if one does not grasp the new view
point as quickly as he would desire. Divine science is easily
understood, although because of the established beliefs of past
education it may seem at first hard to grasp. In times of dis
couragement at seemingly slow progress, the writer has been
helped and consoled in remembering that the infinite Creator
is not portrayed as completing creation in a day, but rather
evolving it through orderly stages of unfoldment. As His expres
sion, man may be content to follow the divine order in his work
of reproduction.
The model man, the highest manifestation of God that the
world has ever known, is Jesus the Christ. He who is known as
"the World made flesh," "The Son of God," and "The Son of
Man," is our highest example of divinity and humanity.
It is not generally understood that all men are related to
God the Father, just as Christ Jesus was. Ignorance would
argue that it is blasphemy to claim for all mankind the same
Sonship with God that Christ Jesus claimed for himself. It is
not blasphemous, nor presumptuous, for Jesus claimed for man
kind, collectively and individually, all that He claimed for
Himself. Christ is the Son of God, and Christ Jesus claimed for
all men sonship with God. When teaching men to pray, did He
not say "Our Father which art in heaven?" Did He not say
to Mary, "Go say to my brethern, I ascend unto my Father and
your Father, to my God and your God?"
It is the destiny of all men to evolve the full and perfect
understanding of their Sonship with God as He understood His
Sonship with God. All men must sometime realize their unity
with God, as He understood His unity with God when He made
the striking statement, "I and my Father are One." All men
must some time, somewhere, manifest the same wisdom and
36 SUNRAY LESSONS IN DIVINE SCIENCE
power that He manifested by controlling physical forces, over
coming time and space, healing all manner of infirmites, over
coming death, and providing temporal necessities for human
needs, as shown by His turning water into wine, the multiplica
tion of the loaves and fishes, and providing money for the disci
ples to pay their dues to the tax gatherers. These works will
be done by men, individually and collectively, when they know
the truth of being as He knew
it.
This knowing
is
spiritual
power. Its attainment
is
the goal towards which humanity wends
its way, consciously or unconsciously as the case may be.
Now, dear hearts, we take Jesus the Christ as our great
Example, knowing that His Father
is
also our Father, that His
God
is
our God, that as He was at-one with God so are all men
at-one with God.
The great and only difference
is,
that He knew the truth
of being and existence fully. He had evolved His Godhood as
we have not yet done. He knew the Truth, and the Truth had
made Him free as
it
will make us free when we know
it,
as He
did. We are all on the ladder of spiritual evolution, and step by
step shall attain the summit as He before us has attained
it,
and
prove our victory over death, as He taught us to.
Man
is
spiritual, divine, immortal. Man
is
God made mani
fest, Man
is
the infinite Effect of infinite Cause. God is the
infinite Creator. Man
is
the infinite creation
of
the one and only
Creator (All Good) Who
in
creating, expresses and manifests Itself
in Its creation, instead of making man of some substance outside
of
Himself —Itself. Man
is
Good, because his Source
is
Good,
he
is
spiritual because his Source
is
Spirit, he
is
mental, because
his Source
is
Mind, he
is
eternal because his Source
is
eternal
Substance, he
is
infinitely perfect
in
being, for his Source
is
infinite perfection Itself, man's inherent perfection he derives
from his All Good Source.
Individually and collectively man
is
the perfect divine
expression
of
God. When asked "What
is
man
in
his relation
ship to God?" students will sometimes reply, "Man
is
a channel
through which God flows."
It
is
the teacher's duty then to
MAN KNOW THYSELF 37
instruct the student who so answers, that man is more than
merely a channel through which God flows, for man is the flow.
This lifts the thought of the student to a clearer realization of
man's greatness. Christ Jesus said that He "proceeded forth"
and "came from God." Man is related to God, as Jesus was,
therefore, man truly proceeds or comes forth from his unfailing
Source, divine Mind, eternal Life, infinite Love, Spirit, but is
never outside of God Who is All Presence. The proceeding
forth of Spirit, eternal Substance and Form into visibility, is
what has been named man.
Some one may ask, "What about the body?" "Has man
no body?" Now, you may be one who has believed that the
body is destined by God Almighty to become dust, and that
man can be a bodiless entity, until a great distant resurrection
day. You may be one who regards it a holy duty to despise
and depreciate the body. You may be one who seeks to attain
a high spiritual altitude by denying the existence of the body,
regarding it as a myth, or counterfeit. In either case you have
been thinking and working along wrong lines. Never for a
second can man be without a body. Again, you may have been
studying along the lines of divine science, and like many others
are befogged by the conflicting opinions of teachers over the
subject of body, and may have been ignorantly denying, depre
ciating, and holding it mentally as an antagonist to your spiritual
advancement, yet at the same time with anxiety questioning
within yourself, as you contended against
it.
Again
I
say this
is
wrong for man can never be bodiless.
In
a
further course
of
lessons
I
shall have much to say on
the subject of body, enough has been said now to serve the
present purpose. The first necessity
is
to know what God and
man are, and that man
is
divine, because he
is
God, Spirit,
in
manifestation, and
is
never without an embodiment. The body
will respond to this right thinking, by improved physical con
ditions, whereas negative beliefs about the body are suicidal.
It
is
impossible for the sinful, sick, poor and diseased, to
gain the higher spiritual understanding which
is
sought to be
38 SUNRAY LESSONS IN DIVINE SCIENCE
conveyed through this series of lessons, and not improve in
health and strength. While we are ridding ourselves of the old
false concept of man, we are gaining in health, strength and
harmony. The body is being "transformed by the renewing of
the mind." The change may come very gradually. It may not
show forth in a day, a month or a year, but slowly or quickly
it will surely follow correct thinking. I have seen actual evi
dence of this in hundreds of cases. Many years ago a woman
came to me in distress. A growth had developed in her breast,
and she was faced by an operation. I commenced at once
explaining the Truth of her perfect being—her oneness with
God. I showed her that forms of disease were no part of her
real selfhood, that they would disappear as she realized her
absolute perfection as the expression and manifestation of God.
God had not made them and did not sustain them. She was told
that in spite of the seeming evidence in the world that man is
sinful, sick and dying, she was to cling to the fact that God
made man perfect, in "His image and likeness," and His work
was declared "very good." Nothing could alter His perfect
work. All that seemed carnal and imperfect was not really
man, but a mental mist, or mask, that would fade away before
the recognition of man as he truly is. That the ignorance,
mental mist, or mask, would fade away before the light of truth
because it was as unreal as the false statement, "twice two are
five." That twice two are five cannot stand because it has no
principle or law of numbers sustaining
it.
It
must fade before
the fact that according to law "twice two are four."
I
promised
to help her
if
she would earnestly try to gain spiritual under
standing, and follow instructions. At first she looked dis
appointed and hopeless as she said,
"I
don't see how this sort
of
thing can cure me." She visited me often, and required
patient work for she did not readily grasp the new teaching.
She was told that
it
was God's will for her to be well, and that
she should do His will. Gradually fear left her and she steadily
improved. She never had an operation, for she was healed. She
is
one
of
many who have proved that "The word of the Lord
is
MAN KNOW THYSELF 39
quick and powerful, and sharper than a two-edged sword.
St. Paul.
To the sick, who study these lessons, I would say, "Do
not hesitate to claim your perfection as children of God, for
Jesus said, 'Be ye perfect even as your Father in heaven is
perfect.'
"
The following verses may be appreciated by some. If so,
find a simple tune for them, sing and pray them in your hearts.
They are given you with much love.
Dear God from me you ne'er can part,
Nor can I part from Thee,
Close as the sun is to its rays,
So Thou art close to me.
Thou know'st me whole and perfect now —
Courage my heart doth fill,
My perfect wholeness here I claim
According to Thy will.
In close communion with my Source
Wisdom and health are mine,
Thou art my all sustaining bread
Thou art my quickening wine.
Immortal Source, Life, Truth and Love,
I am Thy deathless ray,
Created to express all Good
Throughout eternal day.
The Prayer That Heals
IN
THE foregoing lessons it was clearly shown that God is ever
present, eternal Good Itself—not merely a dear, good, kind
of God. That, because of man's true nature, as the very expres
sion and manifestation of the All Good, he may claim as already
his that which he needs. Because man is the very proceeding
forth of absolute Spirit, eternal Life, infinite Love—he is in
reality now, all of good that he hopes to be. If one judges him
self, or others by the appearance of man that he sees around
in daily life, man would appear to be sinful, miserable, sick,
weak and poverty stricken. Man must not be so judged. We
are told to "judge not according to appearances, but judge
righteous judgment." "Righteous judgment" shows us man as
he really is in his spiritual self-hood, which is the likeness and
image of God. By knowing and claiming man as he truly
is,
the
mortal appearance will fade away, and the harmonious man
will be fully revealed. The true man
is
already here waiting
recognition and manifestation. God created him, and God's
creation has never been undone. True prayer
is
the power that
reveals the perfect man. There
is
only one kind of man, the
man of God's creating
is
that man.
In
reality there
is
not
a
good
man and
a
bad man. Anything that appears ungodlike
is
not
even part
of
man, any more than dampness, darkness and cold
ness are part
of
sunlight. Knowing this, evil will fade away
before the light, or consciousness of truth, and the perfect man
will be revealed. St. Paul says, "Be ye transformed through
the renewing of your mind."
Sickness, disease, bad habits, depraved appetites, evil
traits of character, poverty, fear, decay and death will fade
40
THE PRAYER THAT HEALS 41
away before the truth. Now, if God had made these negations
they would remain always, for no one could undo His work.
Because He did not make them they can be overcome, and
the perfect qualities be brought to light, or manifested in their
stead. You know you can correct the error that twice two are
five; you also know that you cannot alter the truth twice two
are four. Why ? Because twice two are four is sustained by the
principle of numbers, it expresses the principle of numbers;
while twice two are five is untrue, it is not supported by the law
of numbers, it has no sustaining principle, therefore must fade
away before the truth, twice two are four.
Now, evil is not sustained by God, Who is The Principle
of man, therefore it must fade out before the truth. God is the
only Creator, and He created only good. Evil is self-created,
and its only power is to destroy itself. Now, it is clearly seen
that God is not the Principle, or Creator of evil, or disease. He
is not the principle of consumption, cancer, paralysis, poverty,
misery, or any one of the numerous disease beliefs that man
kind seems to be afflicted with. If He did not make them. He
does not support, or sustain them, and there is no Creator be
sides Him. Thus we see that we may hope to destroy all manner
of sin and sickness, and bring health and immortality to light.
Now, God's work is done, and man's part is to make God's
work manifest or visible. Prayer is the spiritual means by which
we make God's perfect creation manifest. First, we must know
the truth, then apply
it.
By thought and word we must apply
our understanding of truth
in
order to get results. The motor-
man
in
his electric car touches the lever, and his car moves
off. The car remains still until he does this. While
it
is
station
ary, the power of locomotion or movement
is
still there, but the
car remains stationary, until the motorman, who, understanding
his business, applies his knowledge, touches the lever. The car
then moves along, the power of locomotion
is
manifest.
Now, God's perfect man
is
already here, he must be
recognized, and then, through the power of true prayer, he
must be made manifest. The prayer of faith and spiritual
42 SUNRAY LESSONS IN DIVINE SCIENCE
understanding reveals the perfect man, the perfect spiritual
child of God, who is already created. Again let it be said that,
because man is what he is and where he
is,
he can truthfully
pray the prayer of realization, the prayer of thanksgiving,
instead of the prayer of supplication.
How often has
it
been said
by
men and women,
"I
used to
pray, but my prayers to God were never answered, so
I
have
ceased asking God to give me the health, strength and other
blessings that
I
desire.
I
have beseeched and supplicated God
to hear my humble petitions, but He has not heard, or would not
answer."
Is
it
any wonder that there has been no answer to
such prayers, when blessings have been asked of
a
God that
never existed? There never has been
a
God
in
a
city called
heaven
in
the sky to hear the petitions
of
humans. No such
God has ever answered the prayers of humans, any more than
gods of wood and stone have answered the prayers of the
heathen, who have besought their idols to grant them question
able blessings. This may seem
a
hard saying, but
it
is
true.
Any seeming answer to supplicatory prayer, made to a sup
posed man-shaped God
in
the sky, has not been granted by such
a
God, but has been the result of the operation of a
certain
quality of mind
in
the patient. "Thy faith hath made thee
whole." The prayer of faith can do wonders, but the prayer
of faith, combined with spiritual understanding, will do far
more. "Ye shall know the truth," we are told
in
Scripture, and
"the truth shall make you free." To know God and His Christ
is
Life eternal, we are told.
To fully know God and spiritual man,
in
their inseparable
relationship
is
essential to true prayer —the prayer of faith and
spiritual understanding. This prayer
is
not made to
a
mythical
God
in
the sky. We are told
by
Christ Jesus not to look "here,"
or "there" for the kingdom of heaven, "For behold the king
dom of God
is
within you." To "enter the closet, close the door,
and pray," means to enter the innermost recesses of one's own
being, that holy
of
holies, that sacred shrine within every man,
and there,
in
deep devout concentration, to realize the Father
THE PRAYER THAT HEALS 43
(Source) God, and one's self as in perfect at-one-ment. Here
in the inner sanctuary, the secret place of the Most High, we
realize as ours already that which we desire, because of what we
are, and where we are. We praise and glorify that the good we
desire is ours now. We affirm our oneness with the Eternal Good.
Do we desire health, strength, holiness, peace, longevity,
prosperity, or any other good, then we must know that these
are ours already, and must glorify God that they are ours now,
because we manifest all Good. We must know, feel, and declare
that they are ours now, until by the operation of the power of
the Word, based on spiritual understanding they are made
visibly manifest to us in our daily experience.
Now, one cannot pray as though one has already received,
with a clear conscience that one is telling the truth unless one
knows the unity of God and man in their relationship to each
other. To affirm that health, strength, peace and power are ours
now, while, according to sense testimony, the bodily appear
ance is quite the reverse, would seem like lying, if one did not
know the truth of being, or, that, God and man are at-one, and
by virtue of that one-ness man has already received all good
from God, His infinite Source. To pray, as though one has
already received, meanwhile feeling that one is declaring, or
affirming, what is not true, would have a retarding effect, in
stead of a healing influence. Prayer should be based upon a
clear, definite understanding of the truth of what one declares.
Some years ago the writer was helping a man whose case,
after exhausting the skill of materia medica, had been pro
nounced incurable, and for six weeks had visited him almost
daily, and though the progress of the so-called disease was
arrested from the first treatment, healing was not apparent.
One day, while on her way to visit the patient, she prayed, or
affirmed, that because man expresses infinite intelligence she
would know just what was necessary in this particular case.
That day it was revealed to her that the patient, while praying
as though he had already received, declaring that he was God's
expression and thanking Him for health, strength, and purity,
44 SUNRAY LESSONS IN DIVINE SCIENCE
was meanwhile feeling in his heart that he was uttering the
greatest falsehood.
Once more the practitioner attempted to lead the patient's
thought aright, and read to him different passages from the
Bible. Then asked him, "Have you now any doubt about calling
God your Father?" He replied, "God is my Source, my
Father!" "You believe that man exists because God created
him?" "I do," he said. "Do you believe the Biblical statement
that man is created in the image and likeness of God?" He
answered, "Yes." "Well, how could you imagine your Father,
God, whom you concede created man in His own image, to be
corrupt, impure, and intolerable, as mortal mind would make
you appear to yourself today? Do you see that all that is ap
parently impure is not you or any part of you, and therefore
no part of God's creation, hence is unreal ?"
After a moment's thought, light seemed to dawn, and
the patient exclaimed, "I begin to see it.
I
see that while
I
am thinking that impurity and disease
is
me,
I am dishonouring
God my Creator. My prayers would make God manlike instead
of man Godlike. Now
I
see, that when
I
affirm myself to be God's
child,
I
must know only the real and pure self which
is
the ex
pression of God; then
I
can honestly pray as though
I
have
already received." From that day the disease faded into noth
ingness. His prayer of blind belief was transformed into one
of faith, the exercise of spiritual understanding, and through
this he was healed.
When first turning away from the old method
of
sup
plicatory prayer to
a
distant God,
it
may not seem easy to
pray the prayer of affirmation, the prayer of realization that
the good we seek
is
already ours. Should this be so, one should
not be discouraged, nor should one cease to pray at all. Daily
one should continue to pray, according to his highest under
standing. This
is
his prayer for today, and greater light will
daily dawn upon him, guiding him upward and onward, to con
scious at-one-ment with God, his Source.
In
the innermost
recesses
of
being, the silent word may be spoken with under
THE PRAYER THAT HEALS 45
standing, fervour and power, and abundant blessings be the
visible result. Again, it is sometimes found helpful to declare
the word aloud. It matters not whether one kneels, sits, moves,
or stands on head or feet when one prays. It matters not if one
be deep in the bowels of the earth, in mid-air, mid-ocean, or
trackless desert when one prays. God is where man
is,
and man
is
where God
is,
for they are inseparable. Who
is
not familiar
with the Scriptural passage, Pray without ceasing? To obey
this injunction one cannot always choose one's place to pray.
One cannot always pray on bended knee, nor
is
it
necessary
to do so. "Prayer
is
the heart's sincere desire, uttered or un
expressed," says
a
poet. One's desires must be pure, honest,
loving, unselfish, prompted by the highest motives, based on
spiritual understanding and inspired
by
faith.
There
is
enough of good for everyone to have all he
needs, without encroaching upon the rights of another. There
is
enough health, strength, life, love, peace and happiness,
action, power, prosperity, and longevity for everyone to have
all he needs, without taking another's portion.
If
it
is
health,
strength, vitality, that
is
needed, why beg and beseech God to
give
it
to you, as though God were
a
person afar off, Who has
not already given you all Good. Jesus said, "Behold the king
dom
of
God
is
within you," therefore you need not seek God
anywhere, but
in
His Kingdom within. When you pray, believe
that you receive, and you shall have
it
made manifest unto you.
When you pray for another, you pray believing that the blessing
you desire for him
is
his already. This can be done with con
fidence, for you realize that he
is
related to God, even as you
yourself are. You are both as close to God as you can ever be.
Christ Jesus was not closer to God than you and your patient
are, but He realized His one-ness more clearly than anyone else
ever has, which was the reason of His great power. He spoke of
God as, "My Father and your Father, my God and your God."
God has already given man all that He can give. "Before
they call
I
will answer, and while they are yet speaking will
I
hear." Because
of
what and where they are, how foolish
it
46 SUNRAY LESSONS IN DIVINE SCIENCE
Would be for the sunrays to cry out for the sun to give them
more light, more power. The sun cannot give them more, for
they are the sun itself in manifestation. They only have to ex
press their boundless source from which they are never sepa
rate. They are the proceeding forth of the sun.
Now, man is a ray (expression) of Omnipresence, a ray
of undying Life. He is the proceeding forth. How foolish then
for him to reach out, imploring God to give him more life, more
health, strength and good. God, Life, includes health and
strength, and is Good Itself. Man can never have more of
Good, Life and health, by supplicating an external, distant
God for
it,
than the sunrays can have more
of
the sun by pray
ing the sun to give them that which they already are. Knowing
the truth, knowing what he
is
in
his relationship to God, man
may intelligently claim that which is
already his, and
it
will be
made visible to him. God has already met every human need,
and man's work
is
to make manifest, through scientific prayer,
that which he already has. When Jesus stood
by
the grave of
Lazarus, He did not pray God to hear, nor did He supplicate
God to give him wisdom and power to raise Lazarus. He said,
"I
thank Thee Father that Thou hast heard me." Jesus said,
"Your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of these
things before you ask Him." Why, then should men and wo
men seek to inform God that they want life, health, and strength
?
Why beg God to give that which He has already given
?
A
woman once called upon the writer to inquire into the
principle and method
of
divine science healing and to ask for
treatment. She was suffering from
a
serious internal complaint
for which
a
surgical operation was to be performed.
It
was
shown her that disease
is
unreal because not God-created. "If
you were as
ill
as
I
am you would know that disease
is
very
real," she said. "Do you believe that anything not created by
God
is
eternal?" she was asked. "No,
I
suppose not," she
thoughtfully replied. After further talk and explanation the
sick woman was advised to take herself apart for
a
time each
day, to seek
a
room, where she would be sure of uninterrupted
THE PRAYER THAT HEALS 47
quiet, to read a portion of the Gospels, or Psalms, in order to
dispel the anxiety of daily cares; then to retreat within the in
nermost sanctuary of consciousness and heart, to "dwell in the
secret place of the Most High," the inner shrine, the holy of
holies. In other words, she was told to retire mentally within
her own being, and in this inner sanctuary to realize her one
ness with God, her Source. In this secret place to realize her
self to be a perfect spiritual being, the image and likeness of
God now, to claim gratefully that health, holiness and peace
were already hers, and to intelligently deny all discord as us-
real. She went away, promising to do her best to carry out this
advice. In a few days she returned saying, "I've done what you
said, but I'm no better. Indeed, I feel as
ill
as ever
I
did,
if
not
worse."
"Never mind," said the practitioner, "don't be dis
heartened
if
your healing
is
gradual, nor surprised
if
it
is
quick.
Keep knowing 'the truth, and the truth shall make you free.'
Know that you are
a
perfect, spiritual being now, perfect be
cause God, your Source,
is
perfect."
"That
is
the trouble," said the patient,
"I
feel that
it
is
affirming an untruth to declare that
I
am God's perfect child
(expression) when
I
look and feel so ill."
The practitioner explained that all that seemed imperfect
about her was no part of her true self, for God had not made
it
and He made all that was made. That because God
is
Very
Truth Itself, His creation can embrace no form of disease, im
perfection, evil or death. That
it
was wrong to think that man
could have more than God has, and He never has disease, sin or
death. Because man
is
the very likeness and image (expression
and manifestation of God) Who
is
Truth, man must have what
God has, and cannot have what God has not.
It
was shown that
all weakness, disease, pain, and worry, should be denied reality
for they are only
a
mental mask, they are no part
of
God's
creation and will fade away before the clear realization
of
man's
true selfhood, his God-being.
In
short, the sick woman was told
the truth, as
it
has been explained
in
the foregoing numbers of
48 SUNRAY LESSONS IN DIVINE SCIENCE
this series. She was much cheered and uplifted as she left the
practitioner. From that hour she understandingly prayed, as
though she had already received the health, strength and peace
she desired. She knew that her desire was granted, because
she, in her true being, was eternal Life Itself, in manifestation,
even as a sunray is the sun itself, manifest. Her prayer was
then something after this manner, "O, Infinite eternal All per
fect Life, I glorify and rejoice with holy reverence and intensity,
that I am never absent from Thee, I realize that Thou art one
with me, even as I am at-one with Thee. I affirm that Thou art
my Life eternal, therefore my health is perfect, for in Thee is
no imperfection. Because Thou art my perfect Life, here and
now, I am healthy, strong and free. Sickness and sin are not of
God, therefore are no part of me, have no place in me, nor
power over me, and must disappear before the brightness of
divine Truth, the Christ within me, which is my hope of glory.
I deny that there is any presence or power in sin, disease or
death, because God is not their author. Because God is never
absent, disease cannot be present. I confidently affirm that God
is the only Presence and power. I affirm that I am consciously
conscious of the Truth. I affirm that all wisdom is mine now,
because God is my intelligence and Christ within is my All in
All."
The result of the patient's changed way of thinking of
God and His perfect creation, and her changed mental attitude
in prayer was soon made manifest on her body. Although no
operation was performed she was healed, and her healing was
regarded as a marvel by many. She said that she "clearly real
ized that because God had not made disease, it was lifeless and
mindless, and had no intelligence to grow or do anything but
fade away."
Many make the foolish claim that in this teaching you are
merely to ignore sin and disease. How unkind, and foolish it is
to say to the sick, "Oh, there is nothing the matter with you,
you have only got to declare there is nothing wrong with you
and you will be all right." How unwise it would be to say to
THE PRAYER THAT HEALS 49
one who was committing wrong, "Oh, there is no sin, so you
can't be a sinner, just go on as you are doing." Such a course
in either case would be totally wrong, and is not according to
the teaching of divine science. Jesus Christ, our Great Example,
did not ignore sin and disease. He recognized and healed it.
He healed it because He knew it was unreal, because it was not
made and sustained by God. If God had created it He could not
have destroyed
it.
He recognized disease and called
it
by name
in
some cases. He recognized sin, and destroyed it. He did not
convert sin into holiness, or disease into health. Now,
a
wise,
divine scientist follows Christ Jesus' example, recognizes error,
knows its unreality, denies
it
and so destroys
it
by knowing the
Presence, the Allness of Good. Be quite clear that
in
divine
science, evil, disease, and sin are not ignored. They are recog
nized for what they are, negation, and eliminated by truth. The
realization of the all Presence of Good, excludes each.
In the last two numbers of this series the case was related
of
a
man, who through patient instruction, was helped to
a
realiza
tion of his one-ness with God through the sunray illustration.
At the close of his interview, related
in
the last number, the
patient said to the parctitioner, "Now, tell me, how did you
know that
I
had not clearly grasped the fact of my unity with
God when
I
told you of my prayer today?"
The practitioner smilingly said, "Again
I
will take
liberties with the sun and its rays
in
the endeavour to clear
your thought on that point. Long, long ago
in
a
time that
never was,
a
sunray peeped out into the universe, and,
in
a
fearsome tone exclaimed,
T
am afraid, for,
in
the distance banks
of
fog and mist are gathering. Oh, where, where
is
the sun
?'
An
other ray peeped out exclaiming, 'the foggy mist
is
approaching
nearer to us. Oh, where has the sun gone off to
?'
Other rays cried
aloud, 'We shall be enveloped
in
the cold, clammy mist, the
dark, depressing fog. Oh, why does the sun not come back to
us and dispel the mist? We shall perish,
if
he does not return
to us, and rescue us.' As the hours sped, the rays set up
a
fervent
petition, they cried aloud saying, '0, beloved sun, we beseech
50 SUNRAY LESSONS IN DIVINE SCIENCE
thee to save us. Come to us, for the foggy mist is drawing near
us. It will soon envelop us, and we shall perish in its cold,
clammy darkness, unless thou come and save us. Why hast thou
left us alone, dear sun ? Return to us we humbly pray. Disperse
the mist we implore. Hear our supplication we pray, mercifully
lend thine ear. O, sun, hear our fervent petitions, and, if it be
thy good will, take away the cold fog and misty darkness,
succor us, save us or we perish.'
"
The patient was asked what he thought of the sunrays'
prayer. He laughingly replied, "I think it absolute nonsense.
Qf course, the rays themselves were the sun itself, manifested.
They only needed to know this, take of their source more
bountifully, shine more brightly, and no fog or mist would be
there to fear."
"That is so," said the practitioner, "but was not your
prayer to God to give you life, health, strength and peace, as
silly as the sunrays' prayer? You were praying to a supposed
external something to give you that which is already yours, for
you are in reality God, Life, Good, in manifestation. You were
reaching out in supplication to God, when you, in your true
selfhood, are God Itself, in manifestation. You are now at
one with God, Who is All Life, All Truth, All Good, All Love."
The secret of the prayer of affirmation, or thanksgiving,
is in knowing the reason why you can thank and glorify divine
Love that the good thing you pray for is yours already.
It may be, dear reader, that you have been accustomed
to follow a common practise of suggestion, or auto-suggestion.
You may have been in the habit of affirming or suggesting
something as follows, "I am not ill, I am well," or, "I am
getting better and better every day," or, "There is nothing the
matter with me." You may have kept this suggestion up for
a short or long time, without a legitimate reason for such a
claim of wellness, while disease was in evidence. You may
have experienced relief, it is likely that you may have had a
severe relapse to old conditions, or perhaps a worse complaint
may have appeared. Again, it may be that you talk to a
THE PRAYER THAT HEALS 51
supposed mental state, or thing within you, impossible to define,
or locate, which you call sub-conscious mind, commanding it
to bring you health and strength, to make you well, or bring
you wealth. If you have been in the habit of so dominating
so-called sub-conscious mind, or even appealing to
it,
to bring
to you what you want, you may or may not have gained some
satisfaction from so doing.
If
you have been
in
the habit of
trying to get rid of pains, disease, sins, or poverty by suggest
ing to yourself, or declaring with vehemence,
"I
am rich,
I
have money,
I
am well,
I
have no pain,
I
am strong,
I
am
power,
I
am Life," etc., you have been doing the best you
have known. You may at times have gained some satisfaction
from this way of mental working, but has this method given
you complete satisfaction? Has
it
not left an unsatisfied sense
of incompleteness
in
your thought? Has
it
not seemed like
working
in
the dark? Has not your heart reached out longingly
for something more, for spiritual understanding, for
a
reason
for the hope that
is
in
you?
One need not condemn any method that brings even
temporary help and comfort to afflicted humanity, but
if
a
more effectual way can be shown to any individual, by all
means let
it
be shown. Bald suggestions and declarations
such as,
"I
am well," "There
is
nothing wrong with me," etc.,
lack the vital element indispensable to healing such as Jesus
practised. Something more
is
needed than such bald statements
lacking spiritual understanding as
a
basis. There must be
a
reason for the hope that
is
in
you. You may have faith that
such suggestions will heal, but spiritual understanding
is
absent
and spiritual understanding
is
the essential quality
in
divine
healing.
We are told
in
the inspired Word, "With all thy getting
get understanding." Now, let
it
be clear that the attempt
to heal disease by declaring,
"I
am well," without any con
scious reason why you are healthy
is
blind belief and may help
as far as
it
goes. But to be able to declare,
"I
am well," and
know the reason why you are well now,
is
quite
a
different
52 SUNRAY LESSONS IN DIVINE SCIENCE
mental attitude, and is the right way. To under standingly
declare "I am well, and I know that I am well, because I
manifest God, eternal Life, All Power," "I am well because
I am at-one with God, eternal good," "I and my Father are
one," is the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous (right
thinking) man, one who knows what God
is,
what man is,
and how God and man are related
in
inseparable union with
each other. This prayer "availeth,"
it
"accomplisheth" much.
The more clearly one understands one's true sonship with God,
one's perfection because of that sonship, one's inseparable union
with God, as God in manifestation, the more clearly one can
pray the prayer that brings results. This
is
the prayer of
affirmation, based on spiritual understanding,
it
bears fruit.
I
am trying, dear heart, to bring to you
a
realization of
your infinite greatness as
a
spiritual, perfect being, the mani
festation of God.
If
you were
in
class, where
I
could address
you personally,
it
would be easier for me, and far more satis
factory for you. For forty-seven years
I
have deeply studied
this science, applying
it
in
my daily life. I know the practical
nature
of
the truth
I
strive to impart
in
these lessons.
I
can
speak with assurance about the cases of healing that are record
ed herein. They are results
of
the operation of divine law,
through scientific prayer. No teaching carries such conviction
to students as that which
is
supported
by
the personal observa
tions, experiences and demonstration of the teacher. The cases,
recorded
in
these lessons are introduced for the purpose of
strengthening, elucidating and emphasising the important points
dealt with. Right here
I
am inspired to introduce another case
of healing.
It
has served as an illustration
in
hundreds of cases,
and has never failed to help
in
elucidating the subject we are
dealing with, and
in
enlightening the patient or student.
A
busi
ness man called upon
a
practitioner one morning about fifteen
years ago. He said that
it
seemed as though his days
of
useful
ness were about over, for he was suffering from
a
muscular
or palsied condition
of
the limbs, that was fast growing worse,
and was beyond the help
of
medical treatment. He was
THE PRAYER THAT HEALS 53
suffering intensely, having no peace at night, each day he spent
less time at business, and was less efficient in every way. He
impressed upon the practitioner that he knew all about divine
science healing and did not want her to teach him anything,
but to give him mental treatment for his disease.
He was asked why he came for treatment, if he "knew
all about" divine science, "Why did he not heal himself?"
He admitted that he had tried to cure himself, but was fast
losing ground, and wanted a helping hand. The practitioner
asked him to explain how he treated himself. He said, "I take
considerable time treating myself before I go to business each
day, I keep up the suggestions that T am well,' 'I am power,'
'I am life,' 'I am able to do everything I want to,' 'I will do all
I want to because I know I can.'
"
Said he, "I also keep up
the suggestions all the way down to the office. I declare 'I'm
going to have a rattling good day,' 'I'm going to make things
move today, for I am power,' 'I am life,' 'There is nothing
wrong with me.'
"
In answer to a question, he replied "When
I get to business I carry on fine for a while, but soon collapse
and have to get home somehow. Of late I cannot be at the
office more than an hour or so most days."
The practitioner said, "I note that you are a man who
understands the power of thought to either build up or dis
integrate the body."
He readily answered, "That I do. I know thought is a
powerful force, especially when directly applied."
"Well," said the practitioner, "let me tell you that your
attitude of mind, while you have been treating yourself, and
suggesting to yourself, has been producing and intensifying the
discordant bodily condition, instead of healing
it.
This
is
so,
because you have been treating yourself as though you were
Almighty, and you are no more God Almighty than
a
sunray
is
the sun."
"How do you make that out?" said the patient
in
em
phatic protect, "a sunray
is
composed
of
the same elements
54 SUNRAY LESSONS IN DIVINE SCIENCE
that the sun is. Who's to say it is not the sun? I think it
is,
and
you can't make me believe otherwise."
"Still," said the practitioner, "there
is
a
distinction be
tween the sun and its rays. The sunray
is
dependent upon the
sun for its being and existence."
The man was
a
strong, intellectual reasoner and argued
forcefully. For
a
second the practitioner paused, claiming wis
dom to speak the right word and meet this present need. Then
quietly asked the patient
if
he believed there was
a
Creator?
To this he answered, "Yes."
"Do you then admit that there
is
a
created?" she asked.
He paused
a
second, then said, "Yes
I
do, for there could
not be
a
Creator,
if
there were no created, nor
a
created with
out
a
Creator, the one practically makes the other, for the one
is
indispensable to the other."
"That
is
so," said the practitioner. "Now, will you please
tell me, are you the created, or are you the Creator? Are you
the effect of infinite Cause, or, are you infinite Cause itself?
Remember, your mental attitude
is
what counts."
The man paused before saying,
"I
must be the created,
a
created being."
"You are," said the woman, "you are dependent upon an
inexhaustible Source, for being and existence, from this Source
you are distinct but never separate.
If
you realized this your
mental attitude would be quite different from what
it
is
when
you are suggesting as though you were the Source Itself. Your
body would respond to this mental attitude very differently
from what
it
has to your past method of treatment." The man
was impressed, and the woman asked him to listen to the simple
sunray fable given
in
the first of these lessons. She went
through
it
fully and carefully. When she had finished the man
said excitedly, "You have put your finger on the right spot.
I
can see what harm
I
have been doing to my body by my sug
gestions, now
I
shall do my mental work differently.
I
shall
change my mental attitude, knowing that
I
am the manifestation
THE PRAYER THAT HEALS 55
of infinite Cause. It will be a relief to know I am dependent on
an inexhaustible Source —why the tension is lessened already."
"You cannot do better than Jesus did, who said, 'My Father
(Cause) is greater than
I,'
yet claimed that,
'I
and my Father
are One,'
"
he was reminded. He insisted upon visiting the prac
titioner each week-day for
a
month to learn more of divine
science, and to have treatment, but from the first visit he was
set free from the physical disability. Upon several occasions
when they have met since he has said to the practitioner,
"I
never forget your sunray story, for
it
taught me man's relation
ship to God, eternal Cause,
in
a wonderful way, and for this
valuable realization
I
am ever grateful."
Dear reader, may you realize that all Good
is
already
yours, but that your work
is
to bring
it
into visible manifesta
tion by the operation of true scientific prayer. Whatever your
trouble, or need may be
it
can be healed
by
the prayer of
affirmation, or thanksgiving. Deny every appearance
of
evil.
Affirm Good as ever present. Guard your thoughts and words
that you think and speak only on the side of good —do not
listen to accounts of evils, calamities, descriptions of diseases
and operations. Think of spiritual realities, and know that all
Good
is
yours now. Jesus said, "Fear not little flock
it
is
the
Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom."
There Is Only One Mind
GOOD
is the only quality, God is the all Good, Good is Mind,
Spirit. In our previous lessons we have seen that God is
not a being possessing a mind, but is Mind Itself, and He is the
One Only Mind. He is the One Indivisible Mind, and His expres
sion or manifestation is man, who is a spiritual, mental being.
There are millions of spiritual expressions or manifestations of
the One Only Mind, all manifesting the One Source, as there are
millions of rays manifesting one sun.
Quickly the world is awakening from the long dream of
life in matter, to recognize that All is Mind, that there is no
matter. When the majority of mankind come to realize that
Spirit is the only Mind, and that there is no matter because All
is Mind and mental, Spirit and spiritual, world conditions will
have improved.
Beginners in the study of Divine Science are often sorely
perplexed over the statement that each individual has not a
separate mind of his own, because there is only One Mind,
which is the mind of all men. People who pride them&u.et
upon their scholarly attainments, their intellectual ability, their
wonderful brains, are apt to be displeased when told they have
not a separate mind of their own —that the same Mind is the
intelligence of all men, although there is an infinite variety of
expressions of that One Mind.
A man who thought that way, and was suffering from a
severe nervous breakdown, sought help from a Divine Science
practitioner. He was called "a brainy man." He believed his
brains were his mind, and that he had a marvellous mind of his
own, superior to that of his friends. He believed he had over
taxed his brain and was going mad in consequence. He argued
56
THERE IS ONLY ONE MIND 57
that brain secretes thought, as the liver secretes bile. It was
pointed out to him that post mortem examinations had never
revealed a trace of a thought in a brain, though they may have
revealed traces of bile in the liver. He was shown that brain is
not mind, for when a man is said to have passed on, the brain
may remain intact, but no thought or mind action is there. He
was told of a case where a post mortem examination was per
formed soon after the death of a person, and nothing was
found in the brain cavities but a small quantity of fluid —yet
the man had been thinking and talking lucidly a few moments
before passing on. It was pointed out to him that brain is not
mind, and that he had not a separate mind of his own. He
strongly opposed the latter statement. The practitioner ex
plained the truth to him, as given in the previous lessons of this
course, until she brought him to realize his oneness with God,
eternal Mind. The sunray story helped him immensely. Pa
tiently the healer worked and gradually the patient grasped the
truth, and the physical strain and tension lessened. Fear was
overcome, and soon he was able to take his place in business
life again. He was glad to know that his intelligence was
Omniscience, the One infallible Mind, and that all men manifest
the One Mind, as all the sunrays manifest the sun. He became
a more successful business man, when he realized that God was
his Mind unfailing.
When men and women get rid of the false belief that brain
is mind, and that they have each a separate mind of their own,
they will be happier and wiser. Every child of God is at one
with divine Mind, although each one expresses the one Mind in
his own distinct and peculiar way. All of God's children are
living, thinking, rays of the One Mind from which they can never
be parted. Daily we should deny the false beliefs of a finite,
imperfect mind, and steadily affirm that man's intelligence is
God, Mind, all perfect. If this denial and affirmation is made
with clear understanding and firmness and one knows and feels
the truth of the declaration, the word is spiritual power and
heals. The patient whose healing was just related came to un
58 SUNRAY LESSONS IN DIVINE SCIENCE
derstand the truth so clearly that he was able with assurance to
affirm somewhat as follows: —
"My Mind is sound and perfect,
God is my Mind, God is my Mind, God is my Mind.
I am sane, poised and balanced,
God is my Mind, God is my Mind, God is my Mind.
My Mind is secure from evil suggestions,
God is my Mind, God is my Mind, God is my Mind."
He was able afterwards to declare the word likewise for
another.
God is never insane, mentally deficient, subject to mental
depression, neurasthenia, nerves, ignorance, mental dullness,
nor any of the so-called weaknesses based on the notion that
brain is mind, and nerves control man's peace. God is Mind
Itself, and man is God, Mind, in manifestation. A slight acci
dent to the head, a little over-study, a shock, a sorrow, we are
told, may cause people "to lose their minds," to "become
insane," yet man in his true being is always perfect. If a man's
brain is his mind, and a little too much braininess causes him to
"lose his mind" while yet his brain remains, he is in a peculiar
position. One cannot change Mind by doctoring the brain, but
by knowing the truth of Mind, and man's infinite perfection as
Mind in manifestation, brain conditions are improved, healed,
and normal mental conditions are attained. Brain responds to
spiritual healing, even as heart, lungs, or any other organ of
the body does. Insanity is never created by God, the one and
only Creator, Who expresses Itself in Its creations but is not
housed in them.
Remember, man has not a separate life of his own, any
more than a separate mind, all God's children are in reality
spiritual, and manifest the one Life, the one Mind, all perfect.
The false belief that Mind is in brain, and that each man has a
separate mind, is responsible for insanity, lunacy, idiocy, decay
and death. When the general race belief on this point is
changed, and universal agreement is on the side of truth, men
THERE IS ONLY ONE MIND 59
tal hospitals will not be required. "Thou wilt keep him in
perfect peace whose mind is stayed on Thee." When the force
of universal agreement is on the side of truth, age limits will be
removed from the race, men and women will remain on earth
as long as they desire to. When they desire to leave this earth
experience, they will be able to do so as Enoch and Elijah did,
without knowing death or leaving a mortal body to be disposed
of. They will retain their glorified embodiments (bodies) as
they proceed higher. The world's universal consent to the
belief in death, unbalanced minds, old age, decrepitude, death,
cannot hold mesmeric sway over those who know their one-ness
with God, Mind—that their life is God, and that evil is not
presence nor power, because All is Good.
"Let this mind be in you that was also in Christ Jesus, who
thought it not robbery to be equal with God." This same Mind
is the mind of every child of God, for Christ Jesus claimed for
us the fatherhood of God, as He claimed it for Himself. Let us
understand this great truth of man's one-ness with the one
Mind, so that we may help and heal mental cases who are not
at present capable of helping themselves. Because we are all
manifestations of the one Mind, we can help each other by
mental healing. There is no space, no absence, to thought,
therefore we can help and heal those who are seemingly absent
from us. Many people have been healed by absent mental
treatment, while in mental hospitals, as well as elsewhere. To
know what man's mind
is,
and where
it
is,
is
an invaluable help
to business men and women, enhancing their perceptive and
intuitional powers, making them strong and successful. To
understand this truth and apply
it
enables students to face all
classes of examinations fearlessly, and pass successfully. Stu
dents, and school children, who know the truth, that God
is
their unfailing, all-wise, ever-present, perfect intelligence, can
apply the truth and overcome obstacles or ignorance. They can
cause the seeming limitations to disappear and wisdom, cour
age, and success to be manifested, so that they excel
in
all
subjects. Omniscience knows all, and Omniscience
is
man's
60 SUNRAY LESSONS IN DIVINE SCIENCE
mind, never separate from man. Some students who have been
dull over some subjects have intelligently used affirmations sim
ilar to the following and have been helped so as to be able to
master those subjects they feared they would fail in: —
"I am intelligent, God is my Mind,
I am wise, God is my Intelligence,
I can know all I need to know, all wisdom is mine
now, because God is Omniscience, and God is
my Intelligence here and now."
To understand the truth one is affirming is all important
to successful results. Parents should learn this wonderful prac
tical teaching, and so be enabled to aid their children in all
their needs and aims, including school studies. 'Tis sad to see
children still being taught the old false teaching about God and
man. Some time they will have to unlearn it, which will be
a
difficult task for them, as
it
is
for us now, when we are striving
to know the truth of being. Parents can help their children by
realizing the truth for them and teaching them the truth so that
they can apply
it
for themselves. Children understand and dem
onstrate the truth very readily.
A
mother was
in
despair about her boy, over seven years
of age, who was called mentally deficient. He could not talk
clearly, only his parents could understand what he meant. He
could not lace his shoes, nor button up his clothes. He was
timid and very fearful
in
some ways;
in
other respects he was
foolishly reckless and irresponsible. Worn out, and nigh hope
less was the mother when she took him to
a
Divine Science
practitioner, to see
if
he could be helped. "He
is
called men
tally weak, because his brain
is
said to be weak," she said, "and
I
don't suppose that can be rectified like diseased lungs, hearts,
kidneys, and bones are healed by this science." She was told
that mind
is
not
in
the brain any more than
in
the lungs, or
heart; that the brain
is
a
human organ, just as the other organs
are. Also, that all diseases are the result
of
mental causes,
in
THERE IS ONLY ONE MIND 61
eluding those of brain, and all can be healed by the right under
standing of and application of truth.
"Why, all the world believes the brain is mind," said the
mother dubiously.
"That does not alter the absolute fact that the brain is
no more mind or thought than the lungs and heart are man's
breath," said the practitioner. "When men learn the truth about
Mind, there will be no mental deficiency, no insanity. You
must know that 'as a man thinketh so is he,' for thought is
creative. Change the world belief about Mind, and mental con
ditions will change—evil conditions will pass away, and perfect
mental conditions will be established."
"It seems to me impossible to doctor the brain, but lungs
and heart not so impossible," the mother said.
"The human organs, and their conditions of perfection, or
imperfection, are the tangible visible effects (expressions) of
invisible mental causes. Correct the mental causes of imperfect
bodily conditions, and the bodily organs improve and become
normal. The intangible body is not dense matter, as it has been
believed to be in the past. There is no matter in all the universe
—'matter' is a myth. The body is a mental concept, the out-
picturing of mental causes —its conditions change with every
emotion. If you saw the objects all awry on a movie screen,
you could not adjust them on the screen itself if you tried to,
for the cause of the muddle would be in the mechanism. When
the mechanic adjusted the mechanism, the picture on the screen
would be perfect. Now, to correct discordant or diseased con
ditions of any human organs, the mental causes must be dealt
with and corrected, then the bodily condition will change. One
must know the truth of being—the truth about God and man.
One must deal with the false beliefs of the race in general—the
collective race beliefs. One must deal with the false mental
beliefs and opinions of those surrounding the patient, as well as
those of the patient and oneself. One must realize the Omnipo
tence and Omnipresence of God, if one is to heal disease. The
beliefs that mind is in brain, and life in bodily organs are erron
62 SUNRAY LESSONS IN DIVINE SCIENCE
eous conclusions that are productive of insanity, disease, and
death; the right understanding of Mind, Life, God, destroys
them.
"In this system of divine healing you neither doctor heart,
lungs, nor brains as physical organs, but you doctor, in fact
destroy, the false belief about these organs," said the prac
titioner. "You establish the true fact about them, and the
changed mental state of the patient is made visible through
healed human organs. All is Mind. Again, I say, the healing
is done in the invisible mental realm. Not only does one destroy
the patient's false belief, and that of the people surrounding
him, but one handles the general world belief on the subject,
and protects the patient from erroneous mental suggestions,
aggressive or otherwise. The brain attains normal conditions, as
the result of the mental treatment. We do not deny that man
has a brain, as some claim that we do. We know that, in divine
creation, man, and every part of man, including action and
powers, are spiritual and harmonious. Spirit is Omnipresence,
therefore, there is in reality no place for discord. On this
ground we see the unreality of disease, and the healing proves
the truth of one's spiritual realization."
"Oh," said the woman, "this is all strange; I feel foggy.
I'm sure I don't know what his father would say about
it.
Oh,
why did not God give my child as good
a
mind as He gave
others ?"
"God, Itself,
is
the mind of everyone alike. God
is
no
respecter of persons. He has given Himself to all. Your child
has not
a
separate mind
of
his own. His mind
is
God, as every
one's Mind
is
God. God
is
the One Only Intelligence, which we
all express—
in
different degrees, but all, some time, somewhere
will express full perfection." Seeing that the mother was silent,
the practitioner said, "Listen to this little story.
"Once upon
a
time, when the moon was busy about her
business,
a
roving star went hurrying past, shouting, 'Danger,
danger! There
is
a
rumpus
in
the heavens!'
"
'What's amiss?' cried the moon.
THERE IS ONLY ONE MIND 63
"
'The sun is in trouble, for the sunrays are sqaubbling,'
answered the hurrying star. 'Every ray is claiming that his sun
is better than the other fellow's sun, while the other fellow is
declaring that his sun is better than every other fellow's sun.
Alas, alas ! I foresee war in the heavens.'
"The moon took herself off to the scene of dispute—
meanwhile she was not missed, for a total eclipse took place.
She found the sunrays at war as the star had described, each
ray believing he had a separate sun all to himself, and each
one claiming that his sun was better than was his neighbors'.
The moon chuckled and playfully said to her neighbor, the sun,
'Poor old Sol, what a plight you are in. Although you are re
garded as much greater than I am, yet maybe I can help you
now.' Said the moon to the squabbling sunrays, 'Ho, ho, there,
listen to me! Pride, ignorance, and selfishness have deluded
you into the false belief that you each possess a sun of your
own, when really there is only one sun among you all. You, are
each and all of you individual rays of the one source. You
cannot be separate from each other, so should love each other,
for you cannot hurt or wound your brother ray without hurting
yourself. You cannot be parted from your source, nor can your
source be parted from you, for you are at-one. You each retain
your own distinct identity, you each manifest the same source
in your own peculiar way. No two of you are quite alike, you
are each unique in your own individuality. Happy rays, see
how much better it is for you all to express the one source, than
for each to be a solitary ray, with a separate solitary sun.
Now, hear what the sun —your source—has to say to you!'
"The sunrays listened within themselves, and they heard
ftie sun say, 'Children, you are always at-one with me, and I
need you every one. I am your cause, you are my effects, and
we cannot be parted from each other, nor can you be parted
from each other. Let love and peace reign among you, for we
are all in all."
"The humbled sunrays said, 'How deluded we have been ;
it is a comfort and a relief to feel that we are really not sep
64 SUNRAY LESSONS IN DIVINE SCIENCE
arate, and have not each a sun of our own. What a sense of
security it is to feel we are all united as rays of one changeless,
unfailing source.'
"To the departing moon they waved their gratitude, call
ing 'our thanks are yours, O Moon, throughout eternity.' The
moon smiled a broad smile, and smiled again as she hurried
back to resume her place as the eclipse moved away. 'I've
settled that question for the rays, and gotten proud old Sol out
of a sorry plight,' she smiled with satisfaction. 'Tis said she
has not ceased smiling since."
"So that is why the moon looks so merry," said the woman
with a laugh; "your illustration has helped me to see that we
all are at-one with divine Mind—expressing that Mind, and we
can never lose our mind without losing God. Still men do seem
to, and die," she added.
"Man never dies," said the practitioner; "he never loses
his mind. The experience called death does not rob man of
life, or mind; man lives on, for he is Life, Mind, Itself, in
manifestation. The form or mental shadow left behind is not
man, for man is spiritual and eternal, and is never bodiless. Man
is an evolving spiritual being, and eternally progresses." This
woman strove to know the truth, and to apply it for the benefit
of the child. Soon he began to speak plainly and improve in
every way—was able to attend school, and go about unaccom
panied. Indeed, the change was great, and the home condi
tions improved. The boy soon began to declare the truth for
himself, and is still advancing in every way. Friends of the
afflicted should take heart, for this system heals men and
women as well as children. Patience, persistence and sincerity
are necessary qualities.
Now, there is another way of viewing the one-ness of
Mind, for Good is the only quality. There is not a good mind
and an evil mind; there is only one Mind, and it is Good, God.
There is not in reality an evil mind; what seems so is simply
ignorance —it is negation. As the day of the burning faggot,
the thumbscrew and rack, have passed, so the day of a sup
THERE IS ONLY ONE MIND 65
posed personal devil is becoming extinct. A personal devil can
no longer seem to share honors with God, nor be a convenient
packhorse for humans to dump the responsibility of their errors
on, for such a devil is proved to be a myth. Some people pride
themselves on having dispensed with a personal devil, but, alas !
they have replaced him with "mortal mind," which they fear
as much, and worry over far more than they did over the old
devil. There is in reality no evil action or power, for Good
is the only Action and Power — God is Omnipotence, and
Omniaction.
A relative of mine, a clergyman, asked for treatment for
a very serious internal trouble. One operation had been per
formed two years before, another was pending. He was suffer
ing and fearful, to human sense. I instructed him in the truth,
as shown in the previous numbers of the "Sunray" Lessons, and
gave treatment. He argued that God made everything, there
fore must have made evil. Presently he agreed in a half
hearted way that, as the Bible said "God made all that was
made," and pronounced His creation "very good," He did not
create evil. Still he argued, "God permits evil," and was in
tensely shocked when told that evil is not real, and that God
knows nothing at all about evil, therefore, it was unjust to
accuse God of permitting what He knows nothing about. The
patient was about to decline further help. He was asked to
listen to the following illustration before refusing further
treatment.
"In a dark, dismal dungeon a man was forced to remain
through long, dreary years. Often in his solitude he cried, T
could better endure this misery if only the darkness was not
here. The darkness terrifies me. O, if only the sunlight would
come into this dungeon and drive away the darkness!' Hear
ing the old man's lament, a sunray entered through a mouse
hole into the cave. The man exclaimed, 'Oh, sunlight, how
thankful I am to see you; please chase away the darkness. It
is constantly with me, and it terrifies me.'
66 SUNRAY LESSONS IN DIVINE SCIENCE
"
'Darkness !
'
said the sunray, 'I can't see any darkness
anywhere ; I've never seen darkness in all my life.'
" 'Oh,' wailed the prisoner, 'darkness is here all right.
Go further into the dungeon and you will surely find it there.'
"The hole grew larger, the sunbeam glided farther in, but
still said, 'I can find no darkness.'
"
'Go still farther in," pleaded the man.
"In desperation the sunray exclaimed, 'there is no dark
ness anywhere in this dungeon ; I cannot see it to drive it away.
Never, never, never, go where I will, can I find the darkness
you humans talk of and fear so much.'
"In joyful wonder the prisoner cried 'you have cleared it
away, it has gone, only beautiful light remains.'
"
'You humans are queer things,' said the sunray ; 'you
cannot show me the darkness you ask me to destroy.'
"For a moment the man was thoughtfully silent, then said
'No, of course not ; you will never find, or know darkness, for
you are light itself, where you are darkness can never be, your
very presence dispels darkness, your opposite cannot be where
you are."
"
The patient said "That makes it plain, of course; two
opposites cannot occupy the same place ; light dispels darkness,
but darkness cannot dispel light."
"Your story also gives me a new meaning to the Scriptural
statement, 'Darkness and light are both alike to thee' (Ps. 1 39 :
12). I have always believed it to mean that God is conscious
of evil, now it appears to me to mean that He knows it not for
the reason you have just so clearly shown. He is Good Itself."
"Good and evil cannot dwell together. God and (d)evil
cannot both be powers, God is Good, all Supreme," said the
practitioner. "Now tell me where can evil be if God is always
everywhere ?"
"It must be nowhere, and nothing," said the patient, "for
God is Omnipresent, and fills all space."
"God cannot fill space or fill anything, for He is All. God
more than fills all space, He is Omnipresence Itself, that which
THERE IS ONLY ONE MIND 67
is never absent from anywhere. Get the absolute sense of God,
Omnipresence, and you will see what an unreality disease or
evil is. The more clearly you realize this, the quicker will your
healing be. Divine Science teaches that there is no matter, and
physical science now declares "there is no matter." Man neither
divinely nor humanly can be made of an element that does not
exist. God is Spirit, God is Good, God is All, and man is God,
Spirit, in manifestation."
"Still I am bewildered," said the patient, "what then
caused evil, and matter, why is it here, for we certainly have
to encounter it ? We read in Isa. 45 : 7, T form the light, and
create darkness; I make peace and create evil; I the Lord do
all these things,' which must mean that God made evil, if the
translation of that text is correct."
The practitioner answered, "In 'Ferrar Fenton's translation
of the Bible in modern English,' we read that text, thus: 'I am
Life and none beside—who formed the Light? Created Gloom?
Who Good has made? Created Bad? Myself, the Lord, made
all !
'
In either case we must conclude that Good no more made
evil than light created dark. Good implies evil, just as any
positive implies a negative. Good is positive, evil is negative.
Life is positive, death is negative. Spirit is positive, matter is
negative. Light is positive, dark is negative. 'Thou art of
purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look on iniquity'
(Heb. 1:13). Good, God cannot know or behold that which
It does not create. To God, Good 'night shineth as the day.'
To one who spiritually evolves to the complete understanding
of spiritual creation and the Oneness and Allness of God, only
the positive Is. To him negation, evil, matter, death, is lost in
the 'bottomless pit'; It is nowhere, and nothing.
"I trust I have conveyed my meaning clearly to you. Re
member a negative must not be taken as something. Always the
positive is first. Our great mistake in the past has been in
acknowledging the negative as positive. Let us affirm the All
ness of Good, for evil is not real. It never was made. Evil is
ignorance, darkness, limitation. It is merely an appearance, a
68 SUNRAY LESSONS IN DIVINE SCIENCE
false mental state, and this is matter, mortal mind, negation
which will disappear before spiritual realization of Good.
Remember, spiritual man is spiritual consciousness, the mani
festation of Spirit, Mind. Man does not possess a spiritual con
sciousness, he is spiritual consciousness, and his goal of attain
ment is the complete conscious consciousness of himself as God,
Mind, in manifestation. What you know of God and Man is
wisdom, what you do not yet understand of God and man is
ignorance. What you know of God is spiritual light, what you
do not yet understand of God is mental darkness. Now, do
you see that as spiritual consciousness unfolds (evolves) to a
larger degree of knowing God there will be less darkness or
ignorance, and that when you, as spiritual consciousness, un
fold to the complete understanding of God, there will be no
more ignorance, darkness, because all will be wisdom, light.
You are spiritual consciousness, and when you have evolved to
the full complete knowing of God, Spirit, Mind, there will be no
sense of evil, ignorance, darkness. This is the consciousness
that Christ Jesus manifested. He was Light, and 'in Him was no
darkness at all.' When all men evolve to this stage of spiritual
understanding, the evil, darkness, ignorance, will have dis
appeared, and that state of consciousness will be attained which
is typified by the Holy City, wherein is 'no night,' no darkness
or ignorance.
"This state of consciousness we arrive at progressively
and individually—we each must attain it. Think what it will
mean when all attain
it.
Now, while you are unfolding
in
wis
dom, light, what
is
becoming of the ignorance, or darkness, of
last year? You cannot tell where
it
has gone to, can you? No,
it
is
extinct, for
it
was never anything but ignorance, negation.
Has the ignorance become wisdom? Has the darkness become
light? No,
it
is
extinct. Some people think and teach that
evil
is
good
in
the making, that matter
is
Spirit
in
the making,
but this
is
not so; matter never becomes Spirit, evil never
evolves into Good. When light
is
introduced into
a
dark room,
darkness disappears;
it
is
not transmuted into light, so igno-
THERE IS ONLY ONE MIND 69
ranee, darkness, disappears before the light of unfolding spiritual
consciousness (the appearing Christ), which you and I are in
our true selfhood.
"The following illustration will help you. A student com
mencing his studies in mathematics may be appalled at the
extent to him of the 'not known' or ignorance of mathematics
confronting him, and the small amount of wisdom he has on
the subject. As he pursues his study he learns more of the
principle of mathematics, as understanding unfolds he is con
scious of less unknown or ignorance of the subject, that so
appalled him in his early studies. He would know that the not
known or ignorance was never transmuted into wisdom, but that
with the unfoldment of understanding, ignorance went out as
darkness disappears before light. This is a material illustration
only. Man is spiritual consciousness evolving to full conscious
ness of his God being. As he unfolds ignorance, darkness, what
he does not know of God, disappears and can never be found.
What is this not known, darkness or ignorance? It is the only
(d)evil there
is,
for evil
is
devil with
a
'd' before
it.
It
is
'mortal mind,' that worrying illusion that baffles and hinders
some students, who try to find
a
place for
it
even when they
are taught there
is
only one Mind, which
is
All Good.
"Well, the not known, ignorance, mental darkness,
is
the
only devil, evil, mortal mind, or matter, there
is,
and
it
is
only
a
mental falsity,
it
is
negation, and disappears before the un
folding Christ consciousness of each of us, until only the Known
remains. When speaking of evil, Jesus said, 'Ye are of your
father the devil, and the lust of your father ye will do. He was
a
murderer from the beginning and abode not
in
the truth, be
cause there
is
no truth
in
him; when he speaketh
a
lie, he
speaketh of his own, for he
is
a
liar and the father
of
it.' Show
ing that evil
is
its own father or cause. Just analyse that state
ment of Jesus and see how baseless evil is. There
is
only one
Mind, mortal mind
is
only ignorance as just shown, and this
is
all the matter there
is
—there
is
no mortal mind, and no matter.
All
is
Mind, Spirit. When we awaken to realize there
is
no
70 SUNRAY LESSONS IN DIVINE SCIENCE
matter, because Spirit is all, the universe, and man will still
remain, but one's concept of it only will have changed. 'To the
pure, all things are pure.' In the degree that men have not yet
awakened to realize who and where they are in their at-one-
ment with God, they are in ignorance, or darkness. As men
awake to fuller realization of what and where they are as God
in manifestation, there will be to them less ignorance, or dark
ness. As they fully awaken to a realization of man's oneness
with God, or, that man is God in manifestation, there will be no
darkness or ignorance ; all will be light. The full conscious con
sciousness of man's Godhood will exclude darkness or ignorance
completely, and light, or the Christ consciousness, will reign su
preme. When this much-desired state of consciousness is reached
(as it must be by everyone) , the 'day of Christ' will be attained.
The 'day of Christ' means a perfect state, or stage of conscious
ness in which is no darkness, no ignorance, hence no sin, disease,
old age, sorrow, death, or matter, for the new heaven and the new
earth will have appeared. This much-desired state of conscious
ness must be attained by all ultimately, although it will be an
individual process. Individually, men and women will awaken
to the true understanding of man's infinite greatness and power
as the manifestation of God. Each individual, who awakens to
the understanding of his inherent Godhood

"Wait a moment, please, let me think," interrupted the
patient. Presently he said, "Once I knew a blind man whose one
desire and aim was to see the things of the world. In time the
blindness or dimness lifted in a degree, and he saw things of the
world more clearly. Later the dimness grew still less, and he
saw things still more clearly. Still, the dimness lessened until it
completely disappeared, and clear seeing was established. Now,
I suppose that as I am spiritual consciousness, my purpose is to
know, to see the ideas of Spirit, Mind, my destiny is to know
Truth, God, Mind, fully as Christ Jesus did. In attaining my
destiny, which is the complete consciousness of God, Truth,
infinite Substance, Mind, Spirit, spiritual vision becomes clearer
and clearer, until eventually there will be no dimness. The dim
THERE IS ONLY ONE MIND 71
ness of ignorance, or limitation gradually fades before the light
of unfolding spiritual consciousness, until ignorance, limitation
are obsolete. The light of Truth will then be attained, and I
shall know God as Christ Jesus did."
"Yes," said the practitioner, "such is the destiny of all men.
What became of the dimness which the blind man lost?"
"I don't know," answered the patient ; "it just went, and,
of course, could never be found."
"What difference did his clear seeing make to the uni
verse?" asked the practitioner.
"None whatever," he answered; "the universe was just
the same after as before he saw
it,
only his view
of
it
was
changed."
"What becomes of the dimness, limitation, ignorance,
which disappears before your clear knowing of God, Mind,
Truth?" asked the practitioner.
"I do not know,
it
simply goes,
is
nothing, which proves
God never made it."
"Do you suppose creation will have changed when you
see, or know Truth fully ?" asked the practitioner.
"No, but
I
shall be manifesting
a
greater degree
of
light,
my concept will have evolved.
I
always believed that God made
man completely perfect, but
I
now see that man
is
an evolving
being, unfolding to
a
greater degree of knowing, by this
I
should say creation
is
still proceeding, yet we read God's work
Was 'finished.'
"
"God, Mind, expressed Itself
in
Its creation; man
is
the
highest expression. This
is
man's day, the day of manifestation.
Mind created man, man
is
continuing His work. Creation
is
still unfolding (proceeding). God, Mind, expressed His crea
tion
in
orderly process; spiritual man
is
evolving himself
in
orderly process according to divine Law. As
a
human babe
presents all the potentialities of the man, unfolding to full man
hood, so spiritual man unfolds to 'the fullness of the stature of
manhood
in
Christ Jesus.' So you see spiritual man
is
ever
72 SUNRAY LESSONS IN DIVINE SCIENCE
evolving and is perfect, for each stage of unfoldment is perfect
in its degree."
"I see," said the patient, "a new mental world is opened
to me." In two weeks' time he was free from the physical
trouble. The internal growth had disappeared without a
surgical operation.
In spite of all appearances to the contrary, man is good
because he is the very manifestation of God, Good Itself. To
attain supreme healing power we must know there is no evil
because All is Good. Many years ago, a brother of mine was
in a hospital with a diseased condition of one of his feet. He
had been six weeks in bed, and was reduced from a robust
youth to a very frail-looking one. Two operations had been
performed. A third one was pending, when I visited him, and
found him in a great state of fear. He wept as he told me of
the fate of another patient in the ward, who had had a foot
amputated through a condition closely resembling his. I told
him that I was just learning a wonderful truth, which showed
that we should heal as Jesus did, and how to do it. That if he
cared to come to my home we would try to apply it in his case.
He grasped at the possibility. I spoke to the head nurse, a
woman I knew well, for I had formerly nursed with her in that
same institution. She was appalled at the audacity of my in
tention, and frankly called me mad. She declared that the
bone of the foot was diseased, and that gangrene had set up.
She predicted that, if he were removed, he would be back to
have his foot amputated within a week. The lad had difficulty
in getting his discharge, for the doctors and officials were kindly
and deeply concerned. When he was conveyed to my home
the appearance of the foot was most unnatural, and for a
moment a wave of fear and anxiety swept over me. I had to
treat myself against fear, and did not look at the foot again.
We set to work applying this truth to the best of our under
standing. We studied the healing works of Christ Jesus and
treated earnestly. In a fortnight he was able to walk over a
mile back to the hospital, where there was much pleasure, and
THERE IS ONLY ONE MIND 73
speculation expressed by patients and officials who had known
how serious the claim was before he came to my home. Now,
I did not know a great deal about Divine Science healing then.
I treated the patient according to my highest understanding, and
led his thought on right lines. Very firmly we endeavoured to
hold to truth, although a day did not pass without some anxious
thoughts to be overcome. Now, I firmly denied that evil is real,
I denied that it had action, intelligence, presence or power,
because God had not made it. I denied that disease is real, I
denied all phases of fear and the general false beliefs of the
race. I denied that Substance is matter. I denied understand-
ingly, emphatically and persistently. I knew that the word of
denial could not kill evil, because evil is unreal, is nothing and
nowhere, but I knew the mental attitude attained in the act of
denial, would cause a mental change in my own consciousness,
and also in the consciousness of the patient. If the patient had
made errors in his mathematical calculations through saying
twice two are five, I would have taken a sponge and wiped it
off his slate, and then have assisted him to do his sum correctly.
So to cleanse away the false beliefs of disease, from his
mentality, I used the word of denial instead of a material
sponge. You see, in spiritual healing, the healing work is done
in the mentality of the patient, before it becomes manifest on
the body, for disease is a mental state, not a material condition.
The body outpictures the changed state of the patient's
mentality, and disease gives place to health. Remember, the
body is mental, for there is no matter. Now, the denial of the
beliefs of evil and disease was but a part, and the smallest part,
of the healing treatment. The other part was the word of affir
mation. I affirmed that man is spiritual, perfect, eternal, now.
That man is governed by God, not by evil ; I saw the unreality
of evil and the allness of God. I realized my patient's perfec
tion, knowing God, the One and Only Substance, was his sub
stance, pure and incapable of decay and disease. I affirmed far
more than I denied. I knew my word of affirmation could not
create health and perfection for my patient, or any part of him.
74 SUNRAY LESSONS IN DIVINE SCIENCE
I knew, rather, that it would bring to visible manifestation the
health and perfection that was his always. I knew that God's
work was done, and ours was to make manifest that which the
infinite Creator had established in man, when in creation His
work was done, and was "very good." Above all I realized the
absence of disease, because of the Atlness of Good, the Omni
presence of Spirit. Clearly, I saw disease as a false sense, illusion,
because of the ever-presence of Good. I clearly realized the
absence of disease, because of the all presence of God, Good,
and I mentally saw the part in a healthy condition. The patient
was also protected from the false beliefs, and aggressive mental
suggestions of the race. His consciousness was changed and
bodily healing followed. I knew my realization of Truth de
clared was the word of the Lord, sharper than a two-edged
sword.
This case of healing was told to a woman who sought
treatment for cancer. It impressed her deeply, and helped her
to realize the Omnipresence, the Allness of Good. She quickly
grasped the fact that God is All Presence, that disease could not
be where He
is,
and that as He
is
never absent, disease
is
illu
sion, unreality. She saw that
if
disease
is
real and
is
present,
then God
is
not Omnipresence. So she gave God the glory,
claimed His All Presence, and
in
so doing caused
a
mental
change through her exalted, glorified state
of
consciousness.
This change was translated into conditions of human harmony.
Her embodiment outpictured
it
in
harmony. The body
is
mental,
and she knew
it.
The Truth was explained to her, as taught
in
these lessons. At first, referring to disease, she said over, and
over desperately, "if only
it
was not there."
She was asked, "Is God the All Good?"
She said, "Yes."
"Is God, the Good, everywhere present?" she was asked.
Again she answered "yes."
"Well,
if
God
is
all Power and
is
never absent from any
where, how can there be place for cancer to exist?" As she
remained silent, the practitioner said, "if you can grasp the
THERE IS ONLY ONE MIND 75
truth that Omnipresence, God, Good, all Action and all Power,
excludes the possibility of their being any opposite to Him,
called evil or cancer, you will be healed." She did grasp the
fact, and declared the truth. Knowing the truth, she declared,
"there is no action, no power, no intelligence in disease, for
Spirit is the only Power and Action.
"It is not there, I know it is not there, for God, Spirit, is
All in All, and is never absent from anywhere, so disease can't
be there." She never occupied the hospital cot that was ready
for her, nor underwent an operation. With the help of the
Divine Science practitioner, and her own earnest endeavours,
she knew the truth, the truth set her free—and she has
remained so.
Dear Readers, these lessons furnish a basis from which
you may advance to wisdom and power equal to that of Jesus
and the Masters. Live in the consciousness of your one-ness
with God, and the path will open to you.
Further lessons will follow these, giving clear instruction
on the subject of the body immortal, and the glorification of
the body on earth. The word made flesh.
