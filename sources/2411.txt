INTRODUCTION 1
By JACK BENJAMIN '
Member of History of Science Society
The use of symbols to convey knowledge to the initiated
and to conceal it from the unitiated is as old as civilization.
A clear understanding of the symbolic way of thinking is
necessary if we would unveil and comprehend the "esoteric"
(hidden or secret) meaning of the symbols of ancient and
modern faiths.
Every object is connected with its origins through pro-
gressive change. The complex was evolved from the simple,
In the realm of popular beliefs, however, especially of the
theological type, the tendency has been to conceal from the
common people the sources and nature of archaic symbols
and practices.
So long as men express thought by the use of sym-
bols, the explanation of the origin and nature of their use
is worthy of the best efforts of scholars. Genuine culture
cannot be based upon the undeciphered paleography of
primitive ages.
'rhe ancient faiths had their "mysteries", forms of
initiation, secret signs of recognition, and a body of sym•
bolic lore generally kept from the public. Supernatural
belief evolved through many stages. The initial stages are
of chief interest to the scholar and serious student. In the
early form of such belief we find the core from which
present ideas and practices have evolved. As a belief is a
composite of previous ideas and experiences, the primitive
mentality revealed in early symbolism appears also in
modern emblematic representations.
In his "Ancient Pagan and Modern Christian Sym-
~olism'', Inman pertinently observes: · ·
.''When there exist two distinct explanations, or
statements, about the significance of an emblem, the
one 'esoteric', true, and known only to the .few, the ..
other 'exoterlc'~ incorrect, and known to the 'many, it
is clear that a time may come when the first may be
lost, and the last alone remain". (P. xii)
Inman illustrates the thought by showing that the cor-
rect pronunciation of "Jehovah" was supposed originally
to be known only to a select few, and .later was lost, while
the admittedly incorrect pronunciation survived.
ii INTRODUOTION
Every state of ·society continues from the point of
development at which its predecessor left off. Every state-
ment of beliefs takes on in the course of time different values
or interpretations. The god of the ancient Hebrews or
Christians is certainly not the god of modern believers, and
present day religious worship embodies many departures
from that which the ancients accepted as the ultimate
standard. To understand the nature of this cultural change
requires study of the development and migration of sym-
bols and their utilization to express supernatural concepts.
The social environment usually makes such study seem
inadvisable.
As all culture is inter-related, the accumulation of sym-
bols throughout the ages has resulted in a kind of con-
densed version, which is offered to the worshipers of the
various faiths. The secret of the origin of the symbols,
however, has been zealously guarded from the public.
Doubtless it is feared that such knowledge may weaken
confidence in theological dogmas. Be that as it may, the
fact remains that at the heart of religious belief we find
the ever-present symbol. Only a few persons go beyond
its exoteric meaning in order to ascertain its esoteric sig-
nificance. While many individuals are interested in tracing
back their family "tree", few have sufficient curiosity to
make an effort to learn the origin of their religious faith.
The study of comparative religion has proved the common
background or source of all supernatural and kindred be-
liefs. The hidden knowledge which in far off times was
conveyed by symbols is almost unknown to most believers.
It is retained by a mere handful of objective scholars, and
the heads of the various faiths are not encouraging its study.
Of the few brave and indefatigable scholars who have
written on the subject, the more outstanding are Forlong,
Inman, Massey, Higgins, Dupuis, O'Neill, Faber, Oman,
Ferguson, Hannay, and a handful of others. Their books are
now scarce and expensive. These men did the spadework.
They have shown that it was not alone in. sex that the
symbol became dominant; that it took on importance in
astral, lunar, animal, plant, and other worships. Symbolism
thus became the language of supernatural belief and prac-
tice. John Newton, in his able appendix to Inman's "Ancient
Pagan and Modern Christian Symbolism", comments:
INTBOI)UOTION
"As civilization advanced, the gross symbols of creative
power were cast aside, and priestly ingenuity was taxed
to the utmost in inventing a crowd of less obvious
emblems, which should represent the ancient ideas in a
decorous manner".
iii
Life is based upon reproductive forces and despite
whatever prudery or refinement of emotion we have attained
we cannot ignore their influence. Many investigators of
the subject have noted the relation between sex and religion.
The distinguished sexologist, !wan Bloch, wrote:
"Anthropological science has hitherto been oc-
cupied more with the fact than with the explanation
of the remarkable relation between religion and sex-
uality. There can, however, be no doubt that these
relations arise out of the very nature of mankind. The
various anthropologists and physicians who have oc-
cupied themselves with these problems are in agree-
ment upon this point: that the connection between
religion and the sexual life can be explained only on
anthropomorphic-animistic grounds-that is, by the
same kind of ideas which Tylor had proved to be
the foundation of the primitive mental life". (Se:cuaZ
Life of Our Time, p.98.)
The question of origin is of prime importance in under-
standing either a species or a belief. Whatever changes
the interpretation of symbols has undergone has been quan-
titati'Te rather than qualitative.. Why must a priest wear
certain vestments at religious services? Why is there a cross
on a church? Why does. a synagogue have a Mogen Duvid
(star of David) ? All faiths conduct their services in ac-
cordance with a strict ritual. It takes but little power of
ohservation to note that supernatural worship is replete
with a variety of symbols, the nature and origin of which
are not made known to the laity.
Many persons today follow phallic rites and rituals
of antiquity, not knowing that they do so. To the student
of the subject this is a significant fact, as likewise is the
persistence of the symbol throughout many thousands of
years.
The study of symbology, sex rites, and the worship of
various animals, objects and astral bodies has been limited
to a few. The findings of these men have been known to
only those who delved into out-of-the-way source books.
As there ha8 not been hitherto a large buying public for
such works and as the writing of them requires most of a
iv INTRODUCTION
lifetime, it is not difficult to understand why the general
public has remained unaware of the source of current
beliefs and practices.
The scholars who in the past have treated this subject
chose a special section for investigation. It remained for
someone to compose a work comprising not_ alone the con-
clusions arrived at by former students but to add the
results of modern exploration in this wide field. The debt
we owe to those who wrote the pioneering studies is
obvious. Most of our current writers, because of social
pressures and for other reasons, shy away from this field.
In "Symbolism, Sex, and the Stars", Mr. Ernest Busen-
bark brings forth the results of many years of study.
This treatise may truly be called encyclopaedic. The
author has not only carefully covered the ground explored
by past researchers; he has collated their findings and en-
riched the whole study with much new material. This work
goes back to the "origins" of much modern thinking in
a thoroughgoing way.
It is to be regretted that past studies hi this compre-
hensive field are not readily available to the public. Most
of them, as we have observed, have long been out of print;
others, expensive because rare, are far beyond the purse
of most of those who are interested in the background of
religious beliefs. These students may now profit from this
work, the fruit of many years of painstaking scholarship
and a dominating interest in historical accuracy.
The trend of the times is to seek explanations and means
of understanding phenomena. Mr. Busenbark's labors in
this direction have been truly herculean. His book is an
outline of the principal religious beliefs and customs;
Through his unwearied efforts to ·discover and make known
the truth, we now have available in one volume a "~key"
to the popular beliefs and occult writings treasured by
mankind. This work enables the student of religious his..
tory to follow the stages through which religion has evolved.
Its many illustrations present to the eye something of the
wealth of .symbols used in popular beliefs throughout the
ages, with interpretations of their secret meari.illg, and
thus increase greatly the. comprehensiveness and value of
the volume. · ·· · · ·· · · .· ·

FOREWORD v
The world is finally coming of age. There is a large and
rapidly increasing number of persons who, like the author,
are unable to accept a belief or a set of beliefs merely be-
cause they are very old and widely accepted. Rather than
adopt a ready-made philosophy of life based upon beliefs
which have come down from the Stone Age, they prefer to
weigh the evidence, do their own thinking and draw their
own conclusions. This is particularly true in regard to
beliefs which cannot be proved by daily experience, such as
those based upon the miraculous or the supernatural.
The author can truly testify that problems confronting
one who embarks upon thinking for himself are difficult
indeed. The independent investigator soon learns that trac-
ing popular beliefs and superstitions to their origin leads
to an almost endless amount of research. He learns, for
instance, that stories about the creation of the universe,
the creation and the "fall" of the first man and woman, the
deluge, heaven, hell, the coming of a savior and the end
of the world are not confined to the Bible but may be found
in the literature of ancient peoples in almost every part of the
world. Many of these stories were developed from moon and
sun worship, or from customs, myths, astrology, astronomy,
symbolism, and numerous other beliefs and practices, some
of which were in existence long before the Bible was written
and even before the Jews existed as a distinct branch of
the Semitic peoples.
Scholars who have written on these subjects have been
more or less specialists. Some of them have emphasized the
influence of astrology and astronomy upon ancient culture:
others have been inclined to emphasize the influence of
mythology, symbology or some other subject. To acquire
even a moderate knowledge of the various beliefs which
shaped ancient culture therefore entails the reading of
literally hundreds of volumes.
Many of these works are quite rare and, in the United
States, can be found in only a few great libraries. More-
over, they were written by scholars for scholars and are so
technical and dry that even if the general reader had access
to them, he would probably not have the patience to struggle
through them.
The author believes, therefore, there is urgent need for
a work, written not for the scholar, but for the general
vi FOREWORD
reader, a condensed, non-technical work, which will give
the reader a broad, panoramic picture of the ancient cus-
toms and beliefs from which our principal beliefs, religious
and otherwise, were developed. This is what I have tried to
accomplish. The contents of this book were assembled from
notes gathered from a wide variety of sources over many
years.
In instances where statements are made which may be
deemed controversial, I have provided footnotes giving the
sources from which the statements were derived.
In conclusion, I wish to express my deep appreciation
for the helpful criticism and advice given me by my friends
Charles Smith, Woolsey Teller, Marshall Gauvin, and Arvin
Schmid, and particularly for the assistance and encourage-
ment given me by my friend Jack Benjamin.

BEGINNING OF ·MOON AND SUN WORSHIP
All that we do not know is miraculous.
-TACITUS.
IN MAN'S EARLY EFFORTS to comprehend the workings of
the world about him, probably no phenomenon stirred his
interest and imagination so greatly as did the magnificent
and mysterious spectacle of the heavens.
A picture easily comes to mind of the shepherd tribes~
men scanning the heavens questioningly, trying to form
theories which would explain the scene spread out above
them in the sky. In seeking the reason for things beyond
their comprehension, they were inclined to seek analogies,
to draw comparisons, and to look for relationships between
the events which they observed in the sky, and those which
they saw around them on earth, for it was characteristic of
primitive people that they conceived the earth and the
heavens to be alike in character, one being made in the
image of the other. To them the part was always similar
to the whole.
Whenever knowledge has been insufficient to previde
man with a true explanation of the mechanics of the uni-
verse, his imagination has invented one. In the effects of
the sun and moon upon vegetable and animal life, in the
varying length of the days, the changes of the seasons, and
the influence of these changes upon plant and animal life,
man inevitably looked upon the heavenly bodies as the powers
which governed his destiny.
In his search for explanations of how these deities or
demons could accomplish tasks which were beyond his own
ability to perform, ancient man developed a belief in the
supernatural. In every part of the world and in practically
every tribe or nation there were local gods who were be-
lieved to possess the ability to render themselves invisible,
towiolate the laws of gravity, to fly through the air, to waijc
1
2 SYMBOLS, SEX, AND THE STARS
upon water, to come down to the earth in the form of birds
and animals, to become the parents of human offspring by
"overshadowing" young maidens or by impregnating them
with a gentle gust or ghost. By virtue of their supernatural
powers, the deities which man's imagination created, were
believed to be able to turn the tides of battle and determine
the outcome of wars, to produce good crops, fair weather,
good health, and prosperity, or to produce fire, famine, floods,
lightning, storms, disease, and desolation at will. In short,
the powers of the gods were limited only by man's ability
to invent or imagine newer or greater feats for them to
perform.
Every event in the lives of men from birth to death
was ruled by a deity or spirit; all the mysterious activities
of nature were attributed to the benevolence of a friendly
power or to the malevolence of an evil one. Events did not
take place by virtue of an orderly process of natural law
but by mere whim or caprice of the gods. Every great
religion, past or present, has had for its basis this belief
in a supreme deity or deities who were not subject to
natural laws.
By means of prayers, ceremonies, gifts, and sacrifices,
the ancient people sought to insure the good will of the
friendly powers and to cause the evil ones to discontinue or
withhold their harmful activities. The mighty deeds of
supernatural deities became the subject of myths, legends,
and fables which constituted the literature of all ancient ·
peoples. The highest and most widespread expression of
these ancient beliefs. was embodied in worship of the sun
and the moon.
The Chinese were sun worshipers and the most solemn
period of the year in China was December 21st, when cere-
monies were held at the temples of the sun on the sacred
mountain at Pekin to commemorate the sun's passage of the
winter solstice point. Formerly these ceremonies were con-
ducted by the emperor and his highest functionaries.
Although the Japanese were originally moon worshipers,
they later became sun worshipers and a shrine of the sun
goddess stood in the Mikado's palace. A copper mirror
serving as her emblem is considered one of the sacred
treasures of the Japanese sovereign to the present day. A
symbol of the sun in the form of a golden disk appears on
BEGINNING OF MOON AND SUN WORSHIP 3
the Japanese national emblem to signify the Emperor's
descent from the sun.
In the folklore of northern Europe and Britain, tra-
ditions existed from very early times in which the sun and
moon were personified in human form, either as the heroes
of simple fables or as mighty deities who were able to bring
either good or evil upon the inhabitants of the earth. If
the early Druids in England were not actually sun wor-
shipers, the huge stone ruins at Stonehenge and elsewhere
remain as evidence that they at least observed the critical
periods of the sun's annual cycle with important ceremonies.
In ancient Mexico, the sun, the moon, and the planet
Venus were honored as gods. The Mexicans shared their ·
meat and drink with them, believing themselves to be their
descendants. Many Mexican peasants still practice the old
custom of throwing a kiss to the sun on entering a church.
The Incas of Peru regarded the moon as female and
as being both sister and wife of the male sun. The Incas
called themselves "children of the sun" and the solar orb
was honored by them with human sacrifices in the most
lavishly ornamented temple in the world.
Early inhabitants of the Malay Peninsula regarded both
the sun and moon as female. The Eskimos believed the
moon was the younger brother of the female sun. In North
America many Indian tribes were worshipers of the sun
and moon, evidence of which fact remains in their tribal
ceremonies to this day.
Sun worship existed at various times in Rome and the
annual festival celebrated on December 25th in honor of the
"Birthday of the Unconquerable Sun" was not terminated
there until the death of Emperor Julian, in the 4th century
A.D. In the 5th century, about one hundred years after
the Christianization of Rome, it was still the custom of the
Romans to bow to the sun before entering a church and
to salute the rising sun from the summit of a hill.
Worship of the sun and moon gods formed the basis
for the religions of Egypt, Persia, and India. From Baby-
lonia, where they perhaps reached their highest, or at least
most widespread development, the sun and moon cults
spread throughout southwest Asia and extended as far as
Greece, Rome, and Gaul. The science of astronomy, in fact,
4 SYMBOLS, SEX, AND THE STARS
:had its origin in the efforts_ of the Babylonian astrologer-
priests to foretell the moods and actions of the gods of the
sun and the moon by studying their movements from the
summit of their seven-storied ziggurats. The Biblical Tower
of Babylon was such an observation tower.
The many references in the Bible to the heathen cults
give ample evidence that both sun and moon worships were
practiced widely by the Hebrews in ancient Palestine. Prior
to the promulgation of the Mosaic Code, the Jews employed
lunar time, and it still remains the basis of their religious
calendar.
The changes in the moon's appearance were made the
subject of fables by ancient people long before they knew
that the light of the moon was merely reflected from the
sun, or before they realized that the moon which dwindled
and died was the same one that reappeared each month.
Many of the figures in Greek mythology are purely
solar or lunar in character and it is believed by some scholars
that all the great bodies of mythical lore originated in
ancient astral worship.
If the ceremonies and sacrifices which were part of sun
worship are much better known to us than those which
accompanied moon worship, it may be attributed to the fact
that moon worship was already being over-shadowed by the
spreading worship of the sun at the beginning of written
history. The very earliest records of the ancient nations best
known to us date from 3000 to 4000 B.C. to a time when
the sun cults were already gaining the ascendency. Conse-
quently, such knowledge as we have of the moon cults is
derived from myths and legends which have continued to
live in literature and customs many centuries after the forms
of worship to which they related had dissolved in the mists
of the ages. (We know practically nothing of the Trojan
Wars except from the bits gathered from Homer's Iliad.)
The myths, legends, and fables which in time were
woven about the feats of the mythical gods had their origin
in the simple fact that it is in the nature of people to create
rumors, gossip, and fables about the great and the near-
great in all ages. We invent stori.es about Washington and
Lincoln, and the ancients did likewise with their gods.
If read superficially, many legends derived from ancient
beliefs may seem ridiculously childish or preposterous .to
BEGINNING OF MOON AND SUN WORSHIP 5
modern readers. It was not long ago that nearly every one
believed in witches, devils, miracles, and fairies, and many
persons still believe in their existence.
The ancient myths, however, were not the product of
imagination alone. In every instance they were based upon
observable natural phenomena, there being some funda-
mental relationship between the portrayal and the portrayed.
The high reverence which the Egyptians held for the sacred
scarab is an example which well illustrates this point. The
·scarab or beetle reputedly rolled itself into a ball and then,
like the moon, emerged in 28 days with renewed life. We
now know that the Egyptians were in error, both as to facts
and conclusions for, although the tumblebug does roll a ball
of dung, the ball contains its eggs instead of the bug itself.
When we consider that they believed in reincarnation, it is
not difficult to understand why the Egyptians honored this
lowly bug as a symbol of reincarnation and immortality.
In our own day, the importance of the sun to life on
earth is known to be so overwhelmingly greater than that
of the moon that, at first thought, it seems strange that moon
worship should have been widely practiced long before the
development of sun worship. Nevertheless, the findings of
modern scientists leave no room to doubt this fact. In Baby-
lonia, for instance, the principal gods were identified by
numbers according to their rank. The first triad of gods is
composed of Anu 60, Bel 50, Ea 40. The second triad is the
Moon 30, Sun 20, and Mylitta or Beltis (Venus) 15. The
third triad is Air 10, Nergal or Mars 12, and Nur or Saturn
10. Wherever the sun and the moon are mentioned, the
sun is spoken of as "the son of the moon" and not "the
father," as might be expected. One of the ancient gods
of Ur in Sumeria was called Shamash (the sun), the off-
spring of Nannar, which is one of the names of the moon
god. Nabonides, the last native king of Babylonia, assigned
the same father to Shamash, so that from first to last, the
sun god ranked below the moon god in dignity.
Many theories have been advanced to account for this
anomaly, one of them being that as the great early civiliza-
tions originated in regions whose climate varied from warm
to hot, the sun was considered more of an enemy than
friend to man, because its intense heat scorched vegetation
and destroyed crops and pasturage.
6 SYMBOLS, SEX, AND THE STARS
A more probable solution would seem to be provided
by the fact that in warm countries in which early civilization
first reached a high state of development, the heat and alti-
tude of the sun vary but little from season to season. There
the sun rises and sets rapidly, the periods of dawn and twi-
light being very short, with the hours of day and night
being sharply defined. Also, in regions close to the equator
the length of the day varies but little throughout the year;
there the moon and stars shine with special brilliance and
in some tropical countries the planets Venus and Jupiter are
often bright enough to cast shadows. Moreover, the sun is
too remote, too brilliant, too slow in its apparent move-
ments to permit of easy observation, whereas the moon
changes from night to night, passing from a wholly dark to
a wholly light phase in such a short period that man can
not forget it.
Time was first reckoned as so many "sleeps" or as so
many "nights".1 Then, when it was learned that the changes
from full moon to full moon were repeated in a cycle of
28 days (actually 29.53), time was reckoned by moons or
months. Eclipses of the moon marked the years. The moon
was therefore known as the "Measurer" or "Reckoner".
Even today Mohammedans reckon time by the moon,
and our Easter is reckoned by lunar time instead of solar
time. Arabs greet the new moon with shouts of joy and the
Jewish ritual prescribes a special service for the occasion,
which includes the recital of "psalms of joy".
It is not strange, therefore, that sun worship preceded
moon worship only in countries far from the equator, where
the length of the day varies considerably in the course of
the year. During the winter in these latitudes, the low,
slanting rays of the sun give but little heat to the earth;
vegetation dies and the long warm days of summer are suc-
ceeded by equally long nights and the biting cold of winter.
Here, where the beneficial light and warmth of the sun were
most welcome, the priority of sun worship to moon worship
was but natural.
1-The reckoning of time by nights is common among all nomads
and especially those who travel by night because of daytime
heat. With the Hebrews the day began with sunset; with the
Egyptians and Babylonians it began with sunrise, and with
the Romans the day began with midnight.

The temperate or cold regions, however, were either
thinly populated or isolated from the main stream of man's
development, and local beliefs in those regions left no such
impression upon civilization as did the forms of worship
which prevailed in the great early cultures of India,
Babylonia, and Egypt.
In contact with Egypt on the west and India on the
east, both by land and by water, Babylonia (or ancient
Sumeria) became one of the greatest centers of early civiliza-
tion. Here, in a region made extraordinarily fertile by soil
deposited by the annual floods of the Euphrates where that
river spread out before entering the Persian Gulf, there were
numerous great cities which had developed old and highly
mature cultures centuries before Abraham is supposed to
have led the Hebrews into Canaan.
Through this region passed the caravan routes linking
Egypt, Asia, and Europe, making southwest Asia a natural
melting pot where East met West, traded, fought, exchanged
ideas and customs.
It was in this great spawning ground of Oriental re-
ligions and myths of supernatural heroes that most of the
great religions of the world had their birth. From here they
were carried from country to country, leaving their imprint
on the customs, habits, and beliefs of nations down to the
present time.
Perhaps the first step toward removing the curtain of
mystery which enveloped the mysticism of the East came
with the opening of India to western civilization, thus mak-
ing possible the translation of ancient Indian records into
modern languages. Present day knowledge of what those
ancient peoples believed, how they lived and worshiped is
largely due to the triumphs of archaeologists who, within
the past 150 years, have dug into the mounds of long van-
ished cities in Egypt and the Near East. Up to that time
our knowledge of Babylonian civilization was confined to
a few Biblical references and some astrological works,
compiled at the command of Alexander the Great by the
Babylonian priest Berossus, plus a few works by Greek
and Roman writers.
Modern discoveries began with the finding of the
Rosetta stone by Napoleon's engineers in 1799. This pro-
vided the key which enabled us to unlock the mysteries
BEGINNING OF MOON AND SUN WORSHIP 9
concealed in the ancient Egyptian inscriptions. (The Rosetta
stone contained trilingual inscriptions in hieroglyphics, de-
motic characters, and Greek, thus making it possible to
translate the inscriptions into modern languages.)
One of the most thrilling achievements of modern
archaeology came in 1853 with the discovery of the great
library of King Assurbanipal (called Sardanapalus by the
Greeks), at Kouyunjik, the site of Nineveh in ancient
Assyria. In 648 B.C., Assurbanipal deposed his brother as

king of Babylonia and made that country a mere province
of Assyria. Assurbanipal was an unusually far-sighted
ruler, who not only assembled a library containing a com-
plete record of his own period, but tried as well as he could
to compile a record of all the preceding ages.
Much of our present-day knowledge of Babylonian cul-
ture has been derived from tlie official archives, pottery,
omens, prayers, psalms, and historical, astrological, and
scientific works inscribed on the clay bricks found in this
library. In 1872 George Smith, an English archaeologist,
discovered parts of a Babylonian version of the Deluge on
bricks in the British Museum, and in the following year
he discovered more fragments of the story in the library
at Kouyunjik. Nearly 20,000 bri.cks or fragments from this
library are now in the British Museum.
The scientific world was again thrilled by a discovery
made by J. De Morgan, a French scientist, at Susa, in
Assyria, in December 1901. He found a black diorite pillar
about eight feet high which contained a code of laws promul-
gated about 2050 B.C. by King Hammurabi. Later the
pillar was removed to the Louvre, in Paris. Engraved on
top of the stone is a striking picture. showing Hammurabi
receiving the laws from the sun god Shamash.
Although five columns of the inscriptions had been ef-
faced, there still remained forty-four columns containing
3600 lines of the laws, engraved in cuneiform characters.
The laws are judged to have been compiled from several
older codes, some of which are thought to date from 3000
to 4000 B.C. The Hammurabic laws so closely parallel Old
Testament Mosaic Laws that competent authorities con-
cede that many of the Laws which the Lord is supposed to
have given Moses on Mount Sinai were really in effect in
Babylonia centuries before the Mosaic period.
Even the story of Moses' life bears a marked similarity
to the life of King Sargon of Babylonia, and the Biblical
account of Moses now appears to have been adapted in part
from legends dating from 3000 B.C. or earlier, concerning
the great Babylonian king.
Like Moses, Sargon was a popular leader and law-giver
who secured the independence of his people. Also like
:M:oses, Sargon was said to have been born from a goddess
by an unknown father. She hid him in a basket made of

rushes, daubed with bitumen, and set him adrift in the
Euphrates where he was found by Akki, "the irrigator", who
raised him as his own. Although brought up in squalid
surroundings, Sargon became the much-beloved "Law-
giver". To him was attributed the compilation of the Chaldean
works on astrology and augury.2
In addition to these discoveries, quantities of Hittite
tablets were found in 1906 at Baghoz-Keui, in Anatolia, and
more recently there has come to light a Hittite version of
an Egyptian-Hittite treaty of 1272 B.C. At Tell-el-Amarna,
about 170 miles south of Cairo, in Egypt, a peasant woman
found a large quantity of tablets which proved to be letters
written to the Egyptian Kings Amenhotep III and IV by
kings of various Asiatic countries and by Egyptian vassals
2-0rigin and Growth of Religion, A. B. Sayce, p.26.
12 SYMBOLS, SEX, AND THE STARS
in Phoenicia, Syria,1 .and'·Palestine. These tablets have been
the greatest source of information regarding events in Canaan
in the 14th arid 15th centuries B.C. One of the most re-
markable facts established by this discovery is that the
natives of this region used the Babylonian cuneiform style
of writing even when addressing diplomatic correspondence
to the kings of Egypt.
Personal archives have also been found of Kings Sargon,
Sennacherib, Nebuchadnezzar, and other Assyrian rulers.
These archives contain records of their relations with the
Israelite kings.
Thousands of tablets, steles, and clay bricks have been
recovered on which are recorded the laws, contracts, prayers,
psalms, incantations, poems, myths, and historical, astro-
nomical, astrological, and religious texts of long vanished
cities. This flood of new light on the ancient civilization of
southwestern Asia and Egypt has made it necessary to revise
many theories which had been unchanged for centuries re-
garding the historical, cultural, and religious origins of the
people in these regions.
The contents of many of these tablets were known only
to the priests and others who were initiated into the holy
"Mysteries". We are, therefore, today able to learn much
about that ancient culture that was not known by the
common people of those countries. The following pages are
devoted to an examination of many of the beliefs and
practices described in those ancient records, with a view to
tracing the origin of ma:ny of the customs, beliefs, and
superstitions which are still held by a large portion of the
civilized world.
II
THE MOON AS THE REGULATOR OF TIME AND FATE
INASMUCH AS THE myths, customs, and religious rites
which were woven about the moon gods and goddesses had
their origin in the various aspects of the lunar orb, their
significance and origin will be made clearer if we first recall
the moon's varying phases, movements, and changes in
appearance.
The new moon first appears in the early evening as a
thin crescent, with its horns pointing eastward, and can be
seen in the western sky shortly before or after the first of
the month. It increases in size and luminosity each day,
and as its waxing phase increases, the horns disappear, and
early in the evening of the 14th, 15th, or 16th day, it shines
brilliantly in the eastern sky as the glorious full moon.
For about three days, including the day before and the
day after the full phase, it seems to change but little; then
it gradually begins to decrease in size and brilliance. As it
becomes thinner and wanner with the passing days, its
horns reappear, this time facing westward (as the ancients
expressed it, "the moon is now looking over its shoulder") ,
and on about the 28th day the end of the cycle is reached.
Moonrise occurs about 50 minutes later each day, so
that in the last (dark) phase, the moon does not appear
above the horizon until early morning. In this phase it
passes between the earth and the sun, and as its passage
occurs in the daytime, it is rendered fovisible during most
of the dark phase by the light of the sun. After a short
period of dark moon, a thin crescent again appears in the
western sky, marking the beginning of a new cycle.
As "Regulator" or "Measurer'' of Time
The fact that the lunar cycle is divided into four phases
of equal length, made this period a convenient means for
computing time in periods of weeks ahd months. For this
purpose the movements of the moon through the heavens
may be calculated in several ways: a sidereal month of 27
days, 7 hrs., 43 min., 11:5 sec. (27.32 days); a synodic or
ordinary month of 29 days, 12 hrs., 3 min. (29.53) from new
13
14 SYMBOLS, SEX, AND THE STARS
moon to new moon; and a dragon month of 27 days, 5 hrs.,
5 min: A tropical month is the time required for the moon
to pass through 360 degrees of longitude, as from one vernal
equinox to the next. A solar month is 30 days, 10 hrs.
29 min., 3. sec.
The moon actually revolves around the earth in 27.32
days, but the interval between two new moons or full
moons is 29.53 days. The reason for this discrepancy is
that while the moon is revolving around the earth in 27.32
days, the earth is also advancing in its path around the sun.
The moon must therefore make more than a full revolution
before it returns to a point of alignment with the sun. In
other words, it takes the moon two days to catch up with
the advance of the earth. This is explained in the illustration
which depicts the distance the moon must travel after com-
pleting one revolution before returning to its same position
relative to the earth and sun.
It is apparent that a lunar month may be approximately
calculated as 27, 28, or 29.5 days. All of these periods were
familiar to man before the 30-day month came into use.
In China, India, Persia, Arabia, and Ceylon, there were
lunar zodiacs containing 27 houses which were later in-
creased to 28. One of the Babylonian lunar calendars used
a year of 324 days, whose month consisted of 27 days. The
month was divided into 3 weeks of 9 days each, or 60 uddu,
the uddu being reckoned as 216 minutes.1
In Genesis 7:11 and 8:14, the Flood is said to have
lasted from the 17th of the 2nd month in one year to the
27th day of the second month of the following year, or 1 year,
11 days. Since one 354-day lunar year, plus 11 equals 1 solar
year of 365 days, the historian seems to have translated a
solar year into its equivalent of lunar time. The period seems
to be symbolical rather than historical.
A dragon month is measured from the time the moon
crosses the sun's orbit and reaches a node until it again
1-In Babylon and Athens the moon year was reckoned at 12·3/8
(12.375) mean months. Modern astronomy gives 12.368746 mean
lunar months to the sidereal year. The Greek astronomer Meton
arrived at almost the identical figure in 432 B.C.
In the 2nd century B.C., Hipparchus and his Babylonian con-
temporaries adopted 29 d., 12 h., 44 min., 3.3 s. as the true length
of the mean lunar month, a value as exact as any that modern
astronomy can give. Calllppus, in 330 B.C., proposed 29 d.,
12 h., 44 m. 25.52 s. The true length of the mean lunar month
is 29 d., 12 h., 44 m., 2.81 s. for the present day, or 29 d., 12 h.,
44 m., 3.30 s. for the time of Hipparchus.

crosses the sun's orbit (which meanwhile has retrogressed
toward the west 2 hrs., 38 min.). Because of this retrogres-
sion of the nodes, eclipses are repeated in the same order
in 18 years, 10 or 11 days.
This 18-year period, called a Saras, was anciently
reckoned as 6585-~ days, and is equal to 19 ecliptic years
of 346.6 days. The correct length is 6585.23 days, therefore,
the error was not more than 1 day in 1800 years. This
period was familiar to the early Chinese, Hindus, and Baby-
lonians, who also reckoned it as equivalent to 223 synodic
months, or 242 dragon months. Another ecliptic period
which came into use in the west about 300 B.C., consisted
of 235 synodic months, or approximately 19 solar years. In
the Chinese record called the Ssu Ki of Ssu Ma Chien men-
tion is made of the 19-year lunar period being put into use
in China by Hwang Ti, the yellow emperor, 2698 B.C., or
more than 2000 years before Meton introduced it to the
Greeks.
It is only once in 8 years, or more correctly 99 months,
that full moon coincides with the longest or shortest day of
the year. This octennial period is the shortest cycle at the
end of which the sun and moon really mark time together,
16 SYMBOLS, SEX, AND THE STARS
after having overlapped throughout the whole eight years.
It furnishes the basis for a calendar which brings lunar and
solar time into reasonable, although not exact, harmony.
As Regulator of Fate
Very few books are available from which a reader may
form a fairly clear picture of the beliefs which were based
upon the moon's movements and phases; yet moon worship
was the basis of one of the very oldest and most widespread
cults the world has known. Before it was superseded by
the so-called "ethic" religions, moon worship had left a last-
ing impression on the customs, legends, religions, literature,
and governments of people in all parts of the world.
Doubtless the principal reason for the lack of infor-
mation about this ancient religion is that by the time man
had learned to write and to leave written records, the sun
was already replacing the moon as an object of adoration.
One of the oldest clay tablets in existence records a
reformation of the calendar by King Sargon of Babylonia,
about 3000 B.C., to make the year begin with the entry of
the sun into the zodiacal sign of Taurus, at the spring
equinox. It is evident, therefore, that as early as that time
the cult of the sun was challenging the older cult of the
moon for supremacy.
Although the moon cults declined in importance with
the· rise of the newer beliefs, moon worshipers continued to
build temples in her honor. Long after many places had
adopted the sun as the central figure of their religious sys-
tem, others continued to worship the moon, while, in some
cities, followers of both cults were to be found worshiping
harmoniously side by side. In fact, sun worship does not
appear to have existed as a distinct and wholly separate
system, but was simply grafted on the older cult; and after
the two became fused, the sun eventually became the domi-
nant figure. For this reason, both sun and moon motifs are
usually found even in the earliest recorded myths.
It is not clear whether sun worship and its many myths
began to develop before the beginning of astronomy and
astrology, or whether they developed simultaneously, but
it is evident that as the new cult took root, new deities
were created, and the scope of the religion was ·greatly
enlarged, making it more complex and giving it a· new
orientation. ·
THE MOON AS 'l'HE REGULATOR OF TIME AND FA'l'E 17
The profoundly religious character of this early period
was a dominant social factor and every phase of life had a
religious background or origin. The literature, architecture,
crafts, dress, customs, myths, legends, festivals, and the
sciences, or pseudo-sciences, of astronomy, astrology, sym-
bology, philology, numerology, and the more recent out-
growth of oriental mysticism expressed in the Cabala, were
all influenced by or derived from the astral character of
the primitive religious systems.
The evidence seems to indicate that a nation's myths
and superstitions are more resistant to social upheavals
and die more slowly than any other elements which de-
termine the national character. Although a nation may be
destroyed, its myths and superstitions may survive for cen-
turies after their origin and significance are forgotten.
In the folklore of the most enlightened nations, rem-
nants of these ancient beliefs are still to be found in a
great mass of myths, fables, legends, traditions, and super-
stitions which are firmly believed by persons who little
suspect their origin or extreme antiquity. By gathering
from here and there, these bits of debris from former civil-
izations and placing them together, we can form a link
between past and present more revealing than is to be
found in the dry pages of standard histories.
From the earliest periods of which we have record,
the moon was thought to exercise a strong influence on,
if not actual control of, all organic life, both animal and
vegetable. In what were regarded as favorable aspects,
she was believed to exert an influence on the raising of
crops and animals; on fecundity and childbirth, weather,
commerce, etc. In her unfavorable aspects, she was thought
to be a cause of sterility, lunacy (from Luna, the moon),
fevers, diseases (especially of women) , and in many ways
adversely affect man's health and well being.
Having first seen or imagined a connection between
phases of the moon and vital phenomena on earth, primitive
man naturally believed that the moon regulated or brought
them about. Furthermore, when primitive people lacked
a true or scientific explanation of any event, they were
inclined to attribute it to a supernatural power which they
personified and called a deity. The very name of this planet
indicates the extreme antiquity of the belief that the moon
18 SYMBOLS, SEX, AND THE ST.A.RS
is the Great Regulator or Measurer, not only of time but
of the fates of men. The Latin derivative is the word
Mensis, from which is derived our word Mensuration. In
India it is Meen or Manu, Sanscrit Mas, Persian Mah,2
German Mand, Dutch Maan, Mexican Metzle, Greek Minos,
Egyptian Min.s
At an extremely early date, a connection had doubtless
been observed between the 28-day cycle of the moon and
the menstrual cycle of women and between changes of the
moon and ocean tides. To people of the East, marriage and
childbirth have always been the supreme duty and goal of
women, and the moon, who they believed controlled or
regulated fecundity and the generation of life, became
known as the Great Regulator.
Some significance may also have been seen in the fact
that the human ·foetus is fully developed in 7 months, or
that gestation of both women and cows takes place in 280
days, or ten 28-day months. This period also represents
40 weeks, which may explain why, among ancient people, the
number 40 is habitually associated with periods of tempta-
tion, trial, hardship, and pain for 40 days, weeks, months, or
years. For example, we have the 40 days and nights of
the Deluge, 40 years of wandering in the Wilderness by
the Israelites, 40 days and nights of fasting by Moses on
Mt. Sinai,4 40 days and nights of Christ in the Wilderness,5
40 days between the resurrection of Christ and his final
disappearance from the earth,6 40 days mourning for the
death of Jacob, 40 days fasting by Elijah on Mt. Horeb,
40 days in which Ezekiel bore the iniquity of the house
of Judah, 40 days of sacrifice in the old Persian Salutation
of Mithra, 40 nights of mourning in the "Mysteries of Per-
2-In Persian books of the Avesta the word for moon is Maongh,
Pahlavi Mah and Persian Mah. The Avesta word for wealth
also is Maya, Persian Mayeh. The same Pahlavi word Mah
signifies moon as well as sexual intercourse. The Persian word
which denotes wealth also signifies semen virile, as well as
female or woman. The Ancient Iranian Belief and Folklore of
the Moon by Jivanji Jamashedji Modi, Anthropological Society
of Bombay, Journal, 1917, v. 11, pp. 14-39.
3-In English, French, Italian, Latin and Greek the moon is spoken
of as feminine, but in Sanscrit and all Teutonic languages it
is considered masculine.

sephone," 40 days of mourning by the Babylonians before
the celebration of the festival of the Descent of Ishtar, which
corresponds to the Christian Lenten period of 40 days
from Ash Wednesday to Easter. Forty is the number for
the punishment of sinners, says Deuteronomy (~5:3).
The number 40, by the way, is employed interchange-
ably with 42 in ancient numerical systems, thereby making
an even multiple of weeks.
Mr. Grattan Guinness in The Approaching End of the
Age (p. 258), observed that "the birth, growth, maturity
of vital functions, health, revolution of each disease; decay
and death of insects, reptiles, birds, mammals, and even of
man, are more or less controlled by a law of computation
(completion in weeks, or multiples of 7 days)."
Charles Darwin remarked in The Descent of Man that
animals living at the mean high water, or at the mean low
water, pass through complete cycle changes in about two
weeks. People who live near the sea have always professed
to see a close connection between the rise and fall in the
fates of men and the ebb and flow of the ocean tides. It
is very widely believed that all births occur at the time
of an incoming tide and that all deaths occur during the
ebb tide. The planting of clover seed, the milking of cows,
the churning of milk, and many other activities must be
properly timed with the tides if they are to be successful.
Sir James Frazer7 mentions many such odd beliefs.
Dr. Laycock concluded in The Periodicity of Vital
Phenomena, that animal changes occur in every 3V2, 7, 14,
or 28 days, or at some definite number of weeks. For pigs
the period of gestation is 17 weeks, for rabbits 6 weeks,
pigeon eggs hatch in 2 weeks, chicken eggs in 3, duck
and turkey eggs in 4, goose eggs in 5, and ostrich eggs
in 7. Dr. Laycock also observed that the crucial periods
in fevers occur in 7, 14, or 21 days. Pythagoras said that
infants acquire teeth in 7 months, and lose them in 7 years.
Dr. Francis Balfour,8 a physician employed by the East
India Co., in Calcutta, wrote that he had observed that fevers
invariably occur "on one of the 3 days which immediately
precede the full of the moon, or on one of the 3 days

20 SYMBOLS, SEX, AND THE STARS
which immediately follow it; or on one of the 3 days which
immediately precede and follow the change of moon." And
further: "With regards to headaches, toothaches, inflamma-
tion of the eyes, asthma, pains and swellings ·()f the liver
and spleen, fluxes, spasms, obstructions in the bowels, com-
plaints in the urinary passages, eruptions of various kinds,
and a great many more which return periodically with
the moon, whether contained with fever or not, the cure
entirely depends on a constant attention of these (the
moon's) revolutions." It is very doubtful whether any
present day medical authority would concur in these ob-
servations, but they are, nevertheless, indicative of the
influences which have been attributed to the moon in
modern times.
From the beginning of history, changes of the moon
were believed to have a decisive influence on all existence,
and the number seven was deemed the most powerful of
magic numbers. The day of the full moon, called "Shab-
batu" in ancient Sumeria, was described as "the day of
the heart, the day when the heart of the god is appeased".
Work was laid aside, and old and young gathered in the
street to celebrate. Later, Shabbatu came to mark the four
quarters of the moon; and the seventh, fourteenth, twenty-
first, and twenty-eighth days of the month were celebrated
by religious services and the cessation of work. Although
the Bible is not clear on this point, it appears that adoption
of the seven-day week marked the change from lunar to
solar time by the Hebrews.9
The entry of the sun into the zodiacal sign of the Ram
(Aries), at the vernal equinox, was celebrated by the sac-
rifice of a lamb in both India and Egypt.10 Moses Maimo-
nides, the famous Jewish theologian, intimated that the
paschal11 lamb which Moses commanded the Israelites to
sacrifice at the Passover, was for a similar purpose.
It would require a great many pages to catalog the
multitude of instances in which the number 7 seems to
have a mystical or astral significance. The Babylonians,

10-Before the time of Moses, the Egyptians fixed the beginning of
the year at the vernal equinox.

'l'HEl MOON AS THE REGULATOR OF .TIME AND FATE 21
Hebrews;12 and Egyptians were extremely partial to that
number and in the Koran, the_ number 7 and 7 times 7 is
employed repeatedly.
Many modern mythologists attribute the wide use of
this number to its astrological significance, as it represents
the number of planets in the heavens; but there is much
evidence to indicate that it was particularly venerated long
before the development of astrology.
Another theory, reported by Philo, is that Pythagoras
called the number 7 the ever-virgin number "because it
neither produces any of the numbers within the decad, i.e.
from 1 to 10, nor is produced by them".
Ancient ideas relating to the generative powers of the
moon are reflected in a multitude of old sayings, beliefs, and
superstitions which still are to be found in parts of all the
world. Ancient astrologers believed that conception was
regulated by the moon, a belief which is still widely
held. By the Greeks, Britons, and others, the full moon was
considered as the most propitious time for the marriage
ceremony. This belief still persists in Lithuania. Orkney
Islanders object to marrying except with a growing moon,
while some wish even for a fl.owing tide.18
A male child should be weaned when the horned moon
is waxing, and a female, when it is waning, no doubt, to
make the boys sturdy and the girls slim and delicate.
In the Austrian Tyrol, it is "believed that the moon
influences nature, therefore nothing is done in either field,
stall, house, or wood without first consulting the moon."14
The hair is cut only at the change of the moon, in order
12-"The sacred number 7 dominates the cycle of religious observ-
ances. Every 7th day was a Sabbath and every 7th month was
a sacred month. And every 7th year was a Sabbatical year.
After 7 times 7 was the year of Jubilee. The feast of the Pass-
over with the feast of unleavened bread began 14 days (2 x 7)
after the beginning of the month and lasted 7 days. The feast
of the Pentecost was 7 times 7 days, after the feast of the
Passover. The feast of Tabernacles began 14 days (2 x 7) after
the beginning of the month and lasted 7 days. The 7th month
was marked by (1) Feast of Trumpets on the 1st day; (2) Feast
of Atonement on the 10th; (3) Feast of Tabernacles from the
15th ..to 21st;-the days of the Holy Convocation were 7 in num-

that it may not grow again too quickly.15 Some women in
Fife (Scotland) , do not comb their hair at certain stages
of the moon.16
Corns should be cut during the wane of the moon, if
you would have them disappear quickly. Weeds cut in the
dark of the moon will not come up again. It is believed
that medicines for worms should be given at the height of
the moon. The worms are then believed to come out easily.17
In his book Moon Lore, the Rev. Timothy Harley as-
sembled an immense number of superstitions from many
sources, relating to various aspects of the moon. Some of
them are cited here. Numerous examples are also given
by Edward B. Tylor18 and Sir James Frazer.19
According to Rev. Harley, the time of the full moon
was chosen in both Mexico and Peru to celebrate festivals
for water deities, patronesses of agriculture and, generally,
the ceremonies connected with the crops were regulated by
the moon's phases.20
On the day of the new moon, in Bombay, Parsee ladies,
in their sarees of variegated colors, stroll along the shore,
or sit on the small parapet wall, on the west of the Queens
Road and, as sunset approaches, they give offerings of
.flowers and sugar, and sometimes of cocoanuts, to the sea,
thus paying homage to Ardvicura Anahita, the female
Yazata or angel, who presides over waters. This Yazata
presides also over the divine powers who grant boons to
maidens praying for wealthy husbands who can make them
mothers of robust children.
With the appearance of the moon over the horizon,
they make their curtsy, at times with simple and respect-
ful bowing, with their hands at their foreheads, and, at
times, with their usual curtsy known as overna, wherein
they raise both their hands to the moon and, giving them
a turn in two directions, apply the back of their hands to
their temples. An ordinary homage is paid to the new
moon, even by Parsee men with a bow of the head, and

a salaam with the hands raised to the forehead. Homage
to the new moon, in this or some other form, is observed
also by people in Bombay other than the Parsees.21
In East Lancashire, and other parts of England, super-
stitious people consider it disrespectful or sinful to point at
the moon.22 In Berkshire there is a tradition that a girl
was stricken dead after so doing. This belief is held in
many parts of the world. Many old men take off their hats
to the moon, and devout girls curtsy to the new moon. "In
Scotland generally, and particularly amongst the High-
landers, it is the custom of women to curtsy to the new
moon."23 "English women too, have a touch of this (cus-
tom), some of them sitting astride a gate or stile the first
evening the new moon appears, and saying 'A fine moon,
God bless her.' "24 The Jews had a similar custom (see Jer.
8:1,2) . The Persians believed leprosy to be an affliction
of those who had committed some offense against the moon.
An English writer of the 17th century states that in
Lancashire and parts of Northern England, "some country
women doe worship of the moon on their bare knees, kneel-
ing upon an earthfast stone, and the people of Athol, in the
islands, doe worship the new moon." Camden wrote of the
Irish "whether or not they worship the moon I know not,
but when they first see her after a change, they commonly
bow the knee and say the Lord's prayer and, near the wane,
address themselves to her in a low voice after this manner:
'Leave us well as thou foundest us'.''25 In Lancashire there
is still a custom of making cakes in her honor.26
From the Penitential of Theodore, Archbishop of York
in the 7th century, and Confessionals of Egbert, Archbishop
of York, in the early part of the 8th century, we may sur-
mise that homage was then offered to the moon and sun.27
The Japanese sacred festivals are held at certain seasons
of the year and at changes of the moon. According to Plu-
tarch, carpenters in the first century rejected timber fallen

in the full moon as being soft and tender, subject also to
worms and quick putrefaction by reason of excessive mois-
ture. Husbandmen should make haste to gather up their
wheat and grain from the threshing floor in the wane of
the moon and toward the end of the month.28
Prof. Lindley said "Columella, Cato, Vitruvius, and
Pliny all had their notions of the advantages of cutting
timber at certain ages of the moon, a phase of mummery
which is still preserved in the royal ordonnances of France
to the conservators of the forests who are directed to fell
oaks only 'in the waning of the moon' and 'when the wind
is at the north.' 1120
Beef and pork killed in the wane of the moon is said
to shrink badly when cooked.80 People in Cornwall and
many other parts of the world still gather their medical
herbs when the moon is at a certain phase, a custom prob-
ably of Druidical origin. Cucumbers, radishes, leeks, lilies,
horseradish, saffron, and other plants, are said to increase
during the fullness of the moon, but onions, on the contrary,
are much larger and better nourished during the decline.si
In Iceland, it is said "if a pregnant woman sits with
her face toward the moon, her child will be a lunatic." In
French Brittany, peasant girls never squat in the fields
when facing the full moon, because they believe to do so
would make them pregnant. They always turn their backs
to the moon.s2 In Greenland, girls also avoid looking long
at the moon, for fear of becoming pregnant.ss
Brazilian mothers carefully shield their infants from
the lunar rays, believing that exposure to them causes
sickness. The hunting tribes of Mexico will not sleep in
moonlight, nor leave their game exposed to its influence.
Emile Nourry, a French author, says that when the
moon is angular and unaffected during a nativity, it is
deemed an augury of great success and of continued· good
fortune.s4 Her usual diseases are rheumatism, consumption,

palsy, cholic, apoplexy, vertigo, lunacy,· scrofula, smallpox,
dropsy, most diseases peculiar to young children, etc. Short-
ness of breath, grippe. influenza, dropsy, and glandular
tumors, become worse when the moon is on the wane.
Cutaneous sickness, eye troubles, blindness, intestinal ail-
ments and other forms of illness increase during the full
moon.85
In Scotland, it was formerly believed that if a child
be taken from the breast during the waning of the moon,
it will decay during the time the moon wanes.86 Galen
taught, in the 2nd century, that those who were born when
the moon was falciform, or sickle-shaped, were weak and
short lived, while those born during the full moon, were
vigorous and of long life.87
"The new moon is considered preeminently auspicious
for commencements for all kinds of building up and begin-
ning, de novo. Houses are to be erected and moved into;
marriages are to be concluded, money counted, hair and
nails cut, healing herbs and pure dew gathered, all at the
new moon. The full moon is the tin;te for pulling down and
thinking of the nature of things. It is the time to cut tim-
ber; to mow grass and to make hay, not while the sun
shines, but while the moon wanes. It is also the time to
stuff feather beds so as to kill the newly plucked feathers
completely and bring them to rest."88
Linen should be washed in the waning moon so that
the dirt may disappear with the dwindling light. According
to an old notion, it was deemed unlucky to put on a new
dress when the moon was in her decline.
"In an old Chap Book giving the meaning of different
kinds of dreams and ways to make them come true, the
following prayer is to be repeated:
" 'Luna, everywoman's friend,
To me thy gladness descend:
Let me this night visions see,
Emblems of my destiny.'-"39

To see the moon for the first time through trees, through
a veil or a window is an unlucky omen.40 To see the new
moon on the right hand or directly before you the first
time after her change betokens good fortune that month,
but to see her for the first time over your left shoulder is
an unlucky sign.
In Scotland, Ireland, France, Italy, and Germany people
believed that to have good fortune it was necessary to carry
in one's pocket a piece of silver money when the last quarter
of the moon began.41 In India "when one's eyes catches the
new moon first, he does not like to avert it from her but
he quickly takes out of his purse a rupee or silver coin. This
is held to be auspicious as presaging the acquisition of much
wealth and happiness. The new moon of the Dewali is be-
lieved to be very auspicious among the Hindus. The women
prepare on the occasion a lampblack known as the 'new
moon lampblack' which serves as a charm against the evil
eye."42
Emile Nourry informs us that in India, on the third
day of the quarter of t.he third moon of the year after the
birth of a child, the father takes the child in his arms and
pledges it to worship of the moon. When bridal couples
desire a male offspring, they repeat a magic sentence and
put an arrow in a dish full of rice at the beginning of the
third moon of the year.43
In the 16th and 17th centuries many physicians pub-
lished almanacs and ephmerides indicating the favorable
times to take baths, to shave, to purge and bleed. Health
baths should be taken on the sign contrary to the sickness,
that is, if the sickness were humid, baths were taken when
the moon was in her dry period; and vice versa. The humid
or water signs are Cancer, Scorpion, and Pisces.
Jean Ferne!, 1508-1588, physician and astrologer of
Henry II and Catherine de Medici, wrote that in his time,
it was a custom in the Italian, French, English, and other
courts, to swear only by the planets.44

influence of the moon and designated her "the Great Ma-
gician". He composed a hymn to glorify the marriage of the
sun and moon:15
In all parts of the world, the moon has for ages been
considered a feminine genetrix and protectress of mankind,
ruling over women's breasts, matrix, and other sex organs.
The moon rules all liquids; therefore, she rules over men-
struation. The full moon is believed to be propitious for
childbirth. If there is no moon in the sky, delivery will
be very difficult. Primitive people called the moon "the
Great Midwife".
The moon is thought .to have an influence over shell-
fish,46 and Horace commented upon the superiority of shell-
fish during the moon's increase. Pliny had similar beliefs.
The poet Lucilius said that mussels, oysters, and other
shellfish are fatter during the waxing of the moon than
during the waning.
Sheep should be sheared in the first quarter. Castra-
tion of animals should be done in the third quarter. Medical
herbs should be cut in the first quarter.47
Superstitious agriculturists still consult almanacs be-
fore planting crops. Root vegetables are generally planted
in the dark of the moon and flowering plants and vegetables
are planted in the light of the moon. There is a tradition, .
based upon the Resurrection, that potatoes planted on Good
Friday are sure to come up.
A recent farmer's almanac giving the zodiacal aspects
of the twelve months contains such items as this: "Sign of
Taurus; Root crops of quick growth will be good when
planted in this sign. These crops should be planted in the
light or decreasing light of the moon to produce the best
yield." And again, "Capricornus; This is a moist sign;
produces rapid growth of pulp truck or roots but not much

very realistic and who laugh at customs and taboos of as
recent origin as the Victorian period.
In this work, it will be shown that many of the cus-
toms and superstitions of the present day had their origin
in beliefs which prevailed several thousands of years ago.
Although the subjects considered may appear, at first, to
be unrelated, they will be found, on examination, to be
products of the same mode of thought. In fact, practically
all customs, myths, superstitions and religions of the ancient
world stemmed, originally, from a few simple ideas. For
reasons which will become clear as we go along, we will
first consider some of the beliefs of the ancient Babylonians.
III
LUNAR MYTHS AND CULTS
WEN MODERN ARCHAEOLOGISTS began digging into the
ruins of long vanished cities to gain a wider knowledge of
past civilization, it was with very excellent reason that they
chose the plains of southern Mesopotamia as one of the
major sites for their labors. No region is more heavily
steeped in history, romance, and mystery than that lying
in the valley of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, ancient
Babylonia. ·
So immense' has been the quantity of evidence of the
ancient world which scientists have unearthed with pick
and shovel, that it has become increasingly rash to speak of
any particular city or locality as the "cradle of civilization".
The new light which these discoveries have thrown upon
early Babylonian codes of civil and religious law, literature,
mythology, astrology, and astronomy has made clear the tre-
mendous influence which Babylonian culture has exerted
upon the civilizations of Asia Minor, Egypt, Greece, Rome,
and all of the western world.
The Babylonians devised a very practical and ingenious
system of measures of weight, volume, and distance. They
developed the science of metallurgy and processes were in
use for smelting iron and the making of bronze from tin
and copper. They knew how to make glass as early as
1500 B.C. and cobalt was being used as a substitute for
the costly lapis lazuli in the manufacture of blue glass.
Weaving, too, was a highly developed art and Babylonia
was famous for its magnificent carpets and rugs.
The site of ancient Babylon ("Gate of the Gods") lies
about fifty miles south of the fabled city of Bagdad, in one
of the most fertile spots on earth. The land, called by the
Babylonians Edin or Edinu, "the plain", is the same as the
Eden mentioned in the Book of Genesis, Ch. 2.
Lowness of the land made necessary the construction
of an elaborate system of drainage canals, dams, sluices,
cisterns, etc. The Babylonians share with the Egyptians the
honor of being the first hydraulic engineers.1 Lack of

from about 4500 B.C. .

timber and building stone made necessary the use of both
baked and sun dried brick in the construction of their
buildings. These. were ·generally erected on ·mud platforms
several feet high because of the low, swampy nature of the
soil. Clay tablets also served as their writing material, the
words being inscribed in the wet clay, which was then
baked in the sun.
The oldest clay tablet in which Babylon is mentioned
dates from about 3,000 B.C. To the south, between Babylon
and the Persian Gulf, in the region known as Sumeria, lay
the far older· cities of Ur, Eiidu, Erech, Lagash and Larsa.
To the no.rth, lay Accad, Sippar, Kish, and Nippur com-
prising the region roughly defined as Acc~dia. About 2700
B.C. the Semites of northern Sumer became masters of the
region and founded a great empire at Accad, near Sippar.
'Babylonian culture developed out of the social structure of
these ancient cities, and it is in their ruins that archaeologists
have made many of their most important discoveries.
Before 4000 B.C. the Sumerians had attained a high
degree of culture.2 Their development of pictograph and
cuneiform script has provided us with the oldest written
records in existence.8 Engravings of that period were of
particularly high quality and the sculpture was, in some
respects, equal to or superior to that of later centuries.
Architects of Nippur had learned how to construct
arches of burned brick. Poetry and niusic were carefully
'cultivated and a 12-string harp was in use as early as
2900 B.C. With the rise of Babylon as a great political
power, between 3000 and 2000 B.C., the old Sumerian city
·states came under the leadership of their northern: neighbor,
and soon dwindled in significance.
Seals and clay tablets so far discovered indicate that
the Sumerians, from the earliest recorded period of civiliza-
tion, paid homage to a great triad of gods i!alled Anu, the
·supreme god of the heavens and ruler of the universe in
~ general; Enlil, who governed the earth, and Ea or Enki,
god of waters and the benefactor who: brought the fruits
of civilization to man. Their roles,. however, are largely
honorary and passive, as the principal activities on the

earth were ruled by a secondary triad of gods representing
the moon, sun, and earth.
The old city of Eridu was situated at the mouth of
the Euphrates, on the shore of the Persian Gulf, which fact
no doubt accounts for its association with Ea, the water
god and his consort Davinka or Damkina.
Ur was originally on or near the Persian Gulf. The
deposit of silt at the mouth of the Euphrates has pushed
the shore line back about 130 miles. Ur paid traditional
homage to Ea, but from the earliest historic time, was a
center of moon worship. It was from here that, in a later
day, Abraham the father of the Jews, began his journey
to the Land of Canaan.
At Nippur there were temples to Enlil the earth god
and his consort Ninlil or Nin, the mistress par excellence,
a goddess of procreation and fertility, whose name is a femi-
nine form of Enlil. Later, under Semitic influence, his name
was changed to Bel.

At Larsa in southern Babylonia there was perhaps the
earliest temple of Shamash the sun god.
In early Sumerian records, the name of the moon god
is Nannar, who ruled with the goddess called Ningal or
Nana. As the Sumerian cities became dominated by the
Semitic culture of Babylon, the influence of Sin the moon
god of Ur became greater and more widespread not only
in Babylonia but in other parts of the ancient world. It was
only in Babylon, however, where Semitic influence was
strong, that Sin was particularly honored as the father of
the gods.
Sin was represented as an old man with long beard,
seated beneath a crescent moon. He was identified with the
healing art and as governor of oracles and dreams: on the
other hand, he had a sinister aspect as bringer of sickness
and misfortune to mortals and could punish evildoers with
leprosy. Texts exalt him as the governor of light and wis-
dom. His titles designate him as the "wanderer", "the liv-
ing father", "uncle" or "the old one".
Importance of the goddess of fertility and fecundity in
the ancient scheme is perhaps indicated by her identification
under more than forty different titles which describe her
numerous attributes in various localities and periods.
As Nintud, she is the virgin goddess of procreation
and fecundity, sometimes called Makh, "the supreme god-
dess'', and known to the Babylonians and Assyrians as
Belit-itani, "queen of the gods". As Makh or Mah, spouse
of Merodach or Marduk, the local god of Babylon, she is
spoken of as the "mother of childbirth", the "mother who
opens the loins", "the framer of the foetus" or as goddess
of the foetus.
As Ninkhursag, she is "queen of the earth" and, in
sculpture, is portrayed with the same horned headdress as
the Egyptian cow-goddess Hathor. Sometimes she is re-
ferred to as Anu's heifer and, on boundary stones, her sym-
bol is a cow. As Aruru, she appears as goddess of child-
birth; as Ma or Mama, she is the goddess who created the
first man from clay. She is sometimes represented as the
consort of the earth god Enlil, but she is still called virgin.
As Innini, the virgin goddess is a specialized aspect of the
earth mother, particularly as the sister of Tammuz, god of
the spring equinox, who brings vegetation to the earth.
LUNAR MYTHS AND CULTS 33
She is mistress of magic and administration of law and
order "who exalts judgments and decisions". Throughout
history, she appears as a merciful, compassionate friend of
man, the "Weeping Mother" who intercedes in his behalf
with the wrathful gods. Paradoxically, she is also the bringer
of hatred, strife and storm, the goddess who causes the
heavens to tremble and the earth to shake.
The entry of the Semites into Babylonia occurred at
such an early period that it is impossible to determine defi-
nitely whence they came, what deities they brought with
them, or the exact character of the Sumerian religion at
that time. But it appears that the south Arabic Athtar,
goddess of the planet Venus, was identified with the Su-
merian virgin goddess Venus Ninsianni or Innini, and sub-
sequently became a female deity in Babylon and Assyria
under the name of Ishtar. In later texts Ishtar sometimes
appears as Zarpanit or Sarpanit.
In very early myths, Ishtar is represented as the daugh-
ter of Enlil or Bel, the earth god. She is sometimes portrayed
as Davinka, the wife of Ea and therefore the mother and

goddess from early Assyrian sculpture. The

34 SYMBOLS, SEX, AND THE STARS
sister as well as consort of Tammuz, who was addressed in
an ancient Accadian hymn as "Shepherd and Lord, the Hus-
band of Ishtar, Queen of Heaven." She is often represented
as the daughter of Anu. A myth speaks of Erech as "t:P.e
dwelling of Anu and Ishtar, the city of harlots or joy maidens
and hierodouloi". Elsewhere the moon god Sin is repre-
sented as having been the father of both Ishtar and Sham-
ash the sun god. In astrology the character of Ishtar as
ruler over the forces of generation was assigned to the
planet Venus, but this usage does not seem to have passed
·into the popular religion.
In a hymn she is called "the glad-eyed goddess of de-
sire". Sometimes she calls herself "a loving courtesan" or
a "temple harlot". In this respect she is portrayed in art as
a nude woman with prominent pudendum or as lifting her
robe to disclose her charms. In another hymn she says "I
turn the male to the female: I turn the female to the male".
"She is the harlot who leans from the windows to flirt with
men and seduce them; a temptress who 'causes maidens to
depart from their couches'. One of her titles is 'she who
leans out (of the windows)' or 'queen of the windows.' "4 In
a prayer, a woman begs Ishtar to cause her husband or lover
to return safely, that he may continue to love her and that
she may bear children. As a regulator of childbirth, she is
the goddess of Fate.
Very early in Babylonian history she appears as the
great central figure who dominates the whole scene, just as
in later centuries the central figure is the sun. The pages
of mythology do not contain the name of any god or goddess
whose popularity continued as long through the centuries
as hers; there was none other to whom the changes made
by political upheavals and the natural evolutionary process
brought such great confusion and contradictions in their
character and attributes.
Under many forms ~nd titles she is the goddess asso-
ciated with the earth, the Great Mother Goddess who gives
birth to everything. The earth was esteemed as the womb
from which all life came and the moon was honored as the
generator of the life-giving forces by which birth, growth,
decay and death of all plant and animal life was regulated.
Undoubtedly one of the reasons for the moon's being asso-
4-Mythology of All Races, Stephen H. Langdon, v. 5, p. 33.
LUNAlt MYTHS AND CULTS 35
ciated with growth is that the lowering of the temperature
during the night causes moisture in the air to condense and
settle in the form of dew which nourishes vegetation and
causes growth. In both mythology and astrology the moon
is associated with humidity, moisture, water, and femininity,
whereas the sun is considered dry, hot, and masculine.
Although she has characteristics of both earth and
moon, Ishtar is not strictly an earth goddess, nor is she
specifically a moon goddess. She is the Great Mother
principle in its widest and most inclusive sense.
In the great Gilgamesh Epic an effort seems to have
been made to account for the earth-moon character of the
goddess, for in that Babylonian epic she is transferred from
earth to heaven by the supreme god Anu and made the
consort of the moon god Sin. But whether she is spoken of
as earth, vegetation or moon goddess, her true role in all
ages was that of ruler of the generative powers of nature.
After the conquest of Babylon by ·Assyria, Ishtar ac-
quired a more sinister aspect as goddess of war and destruc-
tion as well as goddess of creation. She was given masculine
attributes, sometimes portrayed with a beard and spoken
of as an androgyne. By this time she had absorbed the
attributes of so many other goddesses and exercised such
a variety of functions that she came near to becoming the
supreme deity. But to the very end, the maid planning
marriage and the wife approaching motherhood continued
to offer prayers and gifts, not to the sun god, not to Sin
the moon god, nor to Ishtar as earth goddess, but to Ishtar
the moon goddess, the Queen of Heaven. She was an in-
carnation of the mystery of conception, the goddess of love
and elemental desire, patron of fecundity and childbirth,
beneficent deity of motherhood in all ages.
Childless women prayed that she intercede for them,
pregnant women prayed that she give them an easy de-
livery: she was asked to provide abundant harvests and
so forth. The great mass of lunar folklore to be found
throughout the world shows that many people still believe
much the same superstitions about the moon that the
Babylonians believed 5000 or more years ago.
Her lunar characteristics are continually revealed in
Babylonian mythology and sculpture, where she is often
portrayed seated or standing, with her bosom bared, and a

suckling infant at her breast. At her feet, or overhead, is
a crescent moon with seven bright stars, thought to repre-
sent the sun, moon and five planets Venus, Jupiter, Mercury,
Mars, and Saturn. The Indian Devaki, Egyptian Isis, and
Virgin Mary were similarly portrayed. Like Isis, Aphrodite,
Semiramis, and Virgin Mary, Ishtar was also often ac-
companied by a dove. Sometimes she appears surrounded
by maidens, each representing some phase of the female
principle, and forming a Court of Love.
In a figure in the Merrill Collection, in the Semitic
Museum of Harvard University, she. appears naked, with
rays around her head and a crescent moon under her feet,
with one foot like the tail of a fish and the other like the
hoof of a cow. Beneath the figure is the inscription "divine
producer of all".
Hundreds of inscriptions of the kings, mythological
texts, boundary stones and artistic representations in statues,
reliefs and seals, as· well as incantations, prayers and psalms
addressed to Ishtar have been found by archaeologists in
Babylonian ruins. But her name is perhaps best known to
mythologists by two poems, the Gilgamesh Epic and the
Descent of Ishtar. The latter poem consists of but 137 lines
and dates from perhaps 4000 B.C., or earlier, and narrates
her descent into the Land of No-Return.
The reason for her descent into hell is not given but
mythologists have generally interpreted the poem as an
astronomical allegory in which Ishtar is represented as an
earth goddess seeking the return of Tammuz, the young
sun god. Her loss of clothing as she passes through the
gates of the Underworld has been thought to represent the
loss of verdure in the earth's vegetation at the end of sum-
mer, when the sun appears to move southward. But the
story contains both solar and lunar motifs and it might
well have been intended to describe the period in the
dark phase when the moon can no longer be seen and,
therefore is represented allegorically as having gone to the
Underworld in search of her lover, the sun god.
Ishtar is portrayed in the poem as the lover as well
as the sister of Tammuz. The gods and kings of ancient
nations were not judged by ordinary standards. Legends
of many countries make all people descend from the in-
cestous marriage of the first man and woman who are
represented as brother and sister or father and daughter.

In Egypt it was customary for the king to marry his sister

After describing the Underworld5 as a region of dark-
ness, "the region whence the wayfarer never returns," the
poem narrates Ishtar's arrival at the entrance of the Under-
world where she demands admittance and threatens to
break down the door. Ereshkigal, the sister of Ishtar and
5-Allatu, the Underworld, is described as the region of darkness,
the dwelling of Eresh-kigal, the inhabitants of whose house see
no light; the region where dust is their bread and mud is their
food; the region whence the wayfarer never returns· whose
inhabitants are clothed, like birds, in a garment of feathers.

mistress of the Underworld, receives the news of her arrival
with anger but bids the gatekeeper let her enter.
The fading beauty of the moon in its last quarter may
then be imagined in the succeeding lines which describe
Ishtar's passage through seven gates, at each of which she
loses one article of dress or ornament until finally she stands
naked before Eresh-kigal, who greets her with scorn and
bids a black demon smite her with disease.
During Ishtar's sojourn in the Underworld a messenger
reports to Shamash, the sun god, that all life on earth is
at a standstill; animals no longer mate and vegetation is
withered and dying. The lines are as follows:
Ishtar has descended into the earth
and has not come up.
Since Ishtar is gone to the Land
of No-Return
The bull cares not for the cow; the
ass not for the jenny;
The man cares not for the maid in
the market
The man sleeps in his place
The wife sleeps alone.6
Shamash weeps but confesses he can do nothing about
the situation. He tells Sin and Ea, the god of subterranean
waters about it and Ea, who exercises a paternal interest
in the welfare of man, sends a messenger to Allatu to de-
mand Ishtar's release. Eresh-kigal receives the messenger
with curses and abuse but is unable to withstand the power
of Ea, and Ishtar is ordered released. After being sprinkled
with the waters of life she is again conducted through the
seven gates and her clothing and jewelry are restored.
Finally she emerges into the upper world and. all life on
earth resumes its normal course. At the end there are a
few lines in which mention is made of "wailing men and
wailing women" mourning Ishtar's disappearance.
The death of Tammuz was mourned in the fourth
month of each year in Sumerian cities; and effigies of the
dead god, anointed with oil and clad in a red robe, were
borne in processions of men and women chanting sad dirges

to the music of wailing flutes. This month, corresponding
to our June, was called Tammuz in honor of the young
god, a name which it carries in the Hebrew calendar to the
present time.
The month Ab (July) was the time of funeral offer-
ings, while Elul (August) was the month of Ishtar's descent
to hell in search of her lover, the three months forming a
cycle of the dying god.7 In later times, however, the popu-
larity of Tammuz became so completely overshadowed by
that of the virgin goddess that the festival originally named
in his honor came to be known as the festival of the
Descent of Ishtar.
According to Langdori,8 the worship of Tammuz was
maintained as late as the 10th century A.D. at Harran in
Syria by the Arabian sect known as the Sabeans. Here the
name was pronounced Tammuz or Ta-uz. The festival of
Tammuz was also known as the Festival of the Weeping
Women and occurred on the first of the month Ta-uz. The

Harranian sect is said to have existed at Babylon as late
as the 10th century A.D.9
The discovery of tablets relating this and other
mythical adventures of Babylonian gods and goddesses has
proved of absorbing interest to mythologists because of the
light these myths have thrown upon the possible origin of
numerous characters in classical mythology.
Although there is an obvious similarity between the
myths of Babylonia and those of the nations lying westward,
it has not been possible to trace, step by step, the migration
of Ishtar, nor is it possible to say definitely whether she
was the prototype for the virgin goddesses of the Mediter-
ranean countries or all of them developed from some other
Semitic source. All available evidence indicates, however,
that the western myths originated much later.
Between 1700 and 1100 B.C. the cult of Isis became
prominent in Egypt and Ishtar's search for Tammuz was
paralleled by the wandering of Isis in search of her dead
lover, Osiris. Like Ishtar, Isis was the ever-virgin mother
and in her temple at Sais was the famous inscription: "I
am whatsoever is and shall be. No mortal hath yet drawn
my peplum (veil) and the fruit which I brought forth was
the sun". In sculpture she is portrayed seated with an
infant in her left arm and in her right hand there is an
ear of wheat.
By the 7th century B.C., or earlier, Ishtar was known
in Phoenicia as Astarte (Ashtoreth) where she was iden-
tified with the god Adonis in a myth which clearly echoes
the Babylonian myth of Ishtar and Tammuz. In Greece
she was known as Aphrodite and, in Rome, her name was
Venus.
The word Adonis (my lord) is a Semitic title which
the Phoenicians bestowed upon the sun. Adonis was born
of an incestous union between a Syrian king and his daugh-
ter, Smyrna (Myrrha), a relationship which recalls that of
Ishtar and Tammuz.
9-0n the 17th of Sivan, the month of the moon goddess, the Akitu
festival was held in Harran, the ancient lunar city of Mesopo·
tamia. In Arbela, however, it fell on the 17th of Elul the month
of the goddess Ishtar who was greatly venerated in that city.
A festival of the "Mysteries of Babylon" was held there on the
25th day of Sivan. Enc. of Rel. & Eth. v. 3, p. 77.
In Jewish tradition the 17th day of Tammuz is associated with
the capture of Jerusalem, but was probably derived from a much
older festival;

Aphrodite fell deeply in love with the handsome young
god and placed him in care of Proserpine, queen of the
Underworld, who became so enamoured of him that she
refused to give him up. Aphrodite herself descended to the
Underworld to recover her lover but without success. Then
she appealed to Zeus who decreed that Adonis should spend
six months of each year with Aphrodite in the upper world
and a similar period with Proserpine in the Underworld.
He was afterward slain by a boar through the malevolence
of Artemis who, in turn, is also a reflection of Ishtar.
In keeping with the changes in most of the fertility
myths which developed in the west, the character of Aphro-
dite as an earth or vegetation goddess is emphasized, and
her lunar attributes recede in to the background. Also, the
character of Adonis as a sun god is more clearly revealed
than was that of the earlier Tammuz. The earth is visualized
as the womb in which the seed of all life is germinated by
the warm rays of the sun which thus becomes the great
father as the earth is the great mother. In India this
ancient conception of the sun and earth is still reflected in
42 SYMBOLS, SEX, AND THE STARS
the Brahmanic marriage vows wherein the man says to the
woman: "I am the sun, thou art the earth, let's wed."
The six months which Adonis spends with Aphrodite
represent the six vernal months and festivals were held
annually in honor of the lusty young spring sun whose
return brought a quickening and renewing of life and
energy to the earth.
The time which Adonis spends with Proserpine repre-
sents the infertile winter months when the sun dies or
drops into the lower or unfavorable signs of the zodiac
which typify the Underworld. The killing of the sun god
by a boar has been interpreted as an allusion to the fact
that the Syrian month Haziran10 in which the event occurred
is derived from the Chaldean word Hazir or Hazira signify-
ing sus, procus, hog. This was the month in which the
sun completed its annual course, thus accounting for the
story of the young and beautiful Adonis being killed by
a boar.
In another sense· Adonis is sometimes depicted as a
corn spirit, his journey to the Underworld representing the
period in which seed lies dormant in the earth before
bursting into new life and growth.
. At the festivals which were held in Greece ap.d Asia
Minor in honor of the death and resurrection of the god,
his image was carried in processions, followed by wailing
women. At the end of the festival his effigy was generally
thrown into the sea or into ·a spring, and his resurrection
was celebrated on the following day. But details of the
ceremonies as well as their meaning varied in different
localities.
Sir James Frazer states that: "At Alexandria, images
of Aphrodite and Adonis were displayed on two couches;
beside them were set ripe fruits of all kinds, cakes, plants
growing in flower pots and green bowers, twined with
anise. The· marriage of the lovers was celebrated one day
and on the morrow women attired as mourners, with
streaming hair and bared breasts, bore the image of the
dead Adonis to the seashore and committed it to the waves.
Yet they sorrowed not without hope, for they sang that the
lqst one would come back again. In Sardinia, Sicily, Ca-

tania, and other parts of southern Italy, St. John's Day
is still celebrated in very much the same way."11
"In Sicily, gardens of Adonis are still sown in spring
and in summer, from which we may perhaps infer that
Sicily, as well as Syria, celebrated of old a vernal festival
of the dead and risen god. At the approach of Easter, Sicilian
women sow white lentils and canary seed in plates which
they keep in the dark and water every two days. The plants
soon shoot up; the stalks are tied together with red ribbons
and the plates containing them are placed in the sepulchre
which, with effigies of the dead Christ, are made up in
Catholic' and Greek churches on Good Friday, just as the
gardens of Adonis were placed on the graves of the dead
Adonis. This practice is not confined to Sicily, for it is
observed also at Casenza in Calabria and perhaps in other
places."
The · story of Ishtar and Tammuz also serves as the
motif of a Greek myth in which Persephone (Proserpine),
the daughter of Ceres, a vegetation goddess, is carried away
11-The Golden Bough, Abgd. Ed., Sir James Frazer, p. 344.
44 SYMBOLS, SEX, AND THE STARS
by Pluto, god of the Underworld. The enraged mother will
not permit vegetation to grow until her daughter is restored
to her. Ceres seeks her child with weeping and lamenta-
tions, as Ishtar sought Tammuz. By the aid of a pome-
granate, Persephone is finally permitted to live part of
each year on earth (during the growing season) and to pass
the remaining months underground as the consort of her
dark captor Pluto.
Closely related to the Adonis-Aphrodite myth was that
of Attis or Atys and Cybele, in Phrygia. In some accounts
Attis is represented as the son of Cybele, an Asiatic god-
dess of fertility; in others, he is the son of Nana, a virgin
who conceives him by placing an almond or pomegranate
in her bosom. The death and re-birth of Attis each year
and his connection with the growth of vegetation stamps
him as a solar god similar to Adonis.
Again, according to one account he was killed, like
Adonis, by a boar; and according to another version, he
emasculated himself under a pine tree and bled to death,
a circumstance which is thought to account for the custom
of priests of Attis mutilating themselves on entering the
service of the cult.
In 204 B.C., toward the close of the war with Hannibal,
Cybele was adopted in Rome and the orgies of her army of
priests shocked the citizens of that sophisticated metropolis.
Cybele is equated with Da-mater, the great mother and
Selene, the moon goddess. She was also called (by the
Greeks) the !dean mother, or mother Ida. This is the title
of the mother of Meru, called in India Idavratta, or
the circle, an apparent allusion to the path followed by the
sun on its annual journey.
In Ephesus, where the nature cult existed in a most
exaggerated form, the goddess Diana or Artemis was hon-
ored as the Multimammia "the many breasted mother of
all." In sculpture she is often depicted with many breasts
covering the front of her body, with animals and plants
springing from her head, limbs, and breasts. Sometimes
she wears around her waist a girdle of lions, elephants and
other animals symbolizing her motherhood of life. Trains
of galli, or emasculated men and boys, painted and dressed
like women, ministered to the goddess as priests or pros-
titutes. At Komona in Kappadokia, as the goddess Ma, she

was ministered by 6000 eunuch priests and the galli in
Phrygia, like those of Ba-al and Ashtoreth, slashed their
arms with knives in religious frenzy.
The apparent misuse of the term "virgin" which i.!3 ap-
plied to Ishtar, Venus, Aphrodite and all of the other great
mother goddesses of antiquity is due to the fact that orig-
inally the word denoted merely an unmarried woman or
maiden. She might even be a prostitute, a term which Ishtar
applied to herself. As goddess of generation, she was de-
voted to loss of chastity and to childbirth, although not to
marriage. Unmarried women of the East, whether virgins
or prostitutes, wore veils to indicate their unmarried status
and when Isis is made to say that no man has lifted her veil
she means that she has never been a party to a marriage
ceremony.
The hierodouloi or sacred prostitutes who served in
the temples of the mother goddesses were likewise called
"holy virgins." In Greece, children who were born of un-
married mothers were called parthenoi or "virgin born".
Some modern writers are inclined to believe that the tradi-
46 SYMBOLS, SEX, AND THE STARS
tional virgin birth of Jesus was founded upon a mistrans-
lation of the Greek word "almah", (virgin), meaning a
maiden or unmarried woman.12
The custom of applying the term "virgin" to the
mother goddesses may be traced back to the period when
they were more specifically indentified with the moon, which
fact may explain why they were represented as virgins.
Marriage signifies a lasting union; and as the sun and
moon appear to wander eternally through the heavens,
widely· separated by time and space, they cannot be repre-
sented as permanently united. The only time they may be
said to meet is during the brief periods when they are in
conjunction. This conjunction might, however, be inter-
preted poetically as a temporary mating, or as a brief tryst
between lovers, for such they always remained. So, the
moon goddess passed down the centuries as the Great
Mother Goddess, who created and ruled all life on earth,
yet was never a bride.
In Egypt she was known as Isis, "the nurse", or "the
mother"; in India she was Devaki; in Phrygia, Artemis, the
"child bearer"; in Carthage she was Tanit; in China, Ching
Mon. In Syria she appeared as half human and half fish,
under the name of Attar or Athar, and in Lebanon her
name was Atergatis. She had traits in common with De-
meter, with Hecate, as goddess of the moon (harvest),
and with Rhea, goddess of the earth. Her name varied
in different times and places but her character remained
essentially the same.
In his Metamorphosis, written in the 2nd century A. D.,
Lucius Apuleius, an initiate into the Egyptian Mysteries,
shows that in his day the character of the lunar goddess was
the same as it had been centuries before. Writing of the
appearance of the goddess to him in a vision, he quotes
her as saying:
"Behold Lucius, I am come; Thy weeping and prayer
hath moved me to succour thee. I am she that is the natural
mother of all things; mistress and governess of all elements;
the initial progenitor of worlds; chief of the powers divine;
queen of all that are in hell; the principal of them that
dwell in heaven, manifested alone and under one form of all

In Hebrew, it would have been more appropriate to use the
word "Bethula" for virgin.

the gods and goddesses. At my will the planets in the sky,
the wholesome winds of the seas and the lamentable si-
lences of hell be disposed; my name, my divinity is adored
throughout all the world in divers manners and in vari-
able customs and by many names. For the Phrygians that
are the first of all men call me the Mother of the Gods at
Pessinus, the Athenians which are sprung from their
'own soil, Cecropian Minerva; the Cyprians which are girt by
the sea, Paphian Venus; the Cretans which bear arrows,
Dictynnian Diana; the Sicilians which speak three tongues,
infernal Proserpine; the Eleusians, their ancient goddess
Ceres; some June, other Bellona, other Hecate, other Rham-
nusia and principally both sort of the Ethiopians which
dwell in the Orient and are enlightened by the morning
rays of the sun and the Egyptians which are excellent in
all kind of ancient doctrine and by their proper ceremonies
accustom to worship me, do call me by my true name, Queen
Isis."13
Proclus, writing in the 5th century, on the Timaeus
of Plato, states that the "moon is the cause of nature in
mortals and the self conspicuous image of fontal nature."
A distinctive feature of the mother goddesses is their
frequent identification with names derived from the root
Ma, which in Greek means mother or nurse. Ma is a title
of the goddess Bhavani, the Venus of India; Ma or Mah
was the name of one of the earliest Sumerian goddesses and
was also the title of the great Multimammia of south-
west Asia. Mah or Mas is the Persian for moon, and, in
the form of Maia, was a name which the Greeks applied
to Demeter. In India, the fire god Agni is the offspring of
Maya who represents motherhood and creation, being simi-
lar to Maria (Maera), who was the wife of the sun god
Hephaistos, according to Pausanius. Among the Persians
she is the mother of the god Mithra.
According to the Hindus, their goddess Maya Durga
denotes "inaccessible" or "non-realizable" or illusion. All
existence is ultimately resolved into Brahma and Maya,
being and appearance, reality and illusion.
As the mother of Adonis, the name Ma becomes Myrrha.
In Arabic it becomes Mizram or Mizraim and is the same

48 SYMBOLS, SEX, AND THE STARS
as Miriam, the sister of Moses. The names Miriam, Maera,
Maria and Mary, the mother of Christ, are all the same.
It may be further recalled that according to myths of
the ancient Sumerians, all life on earth derived from Ishtar,
daughter of the god Ea, who rose from the ocean each
day. Like Ea, Ishtar, the moon goddess, also rose out
of the sea, her name probably signifying the star which
seemed to rise from the ocean.
Aphrodite was said to have risen from the sea and she
was often portrayed rising from the waves or sailing on a
sea shell. Venus was frequently called Stella Maris, "star
of the sea", and one of the ancient meanings of the name
Mary was "star of the sea", for which reason the Virgin
Mary was often affectionately called Stella Maris.
The August festival in honor of Ishtar's Descent was
paralleled in Greece and Rome by festivals of the Passage
of the Virgin on August 13th when the aid of Artemis and
Diana was invoked to prevent storms which might injure
the maturing harvests. This festival was changed in the
6th century A.D. by the Roman Church to the Feast of the
Assumption of the Virgin Mary on August 15th. As in the
case of all festivals in honor of pagan gods, the date was of
astronomical significance. In the Roman calendar of Col-
umella, August 15th marked the disappearance of the zodi-
acal constellation of the Virgin. With the Greeks that day
was fixed as the day of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin
Astrea or her union with the sun.
During this period the sun passed through the constella-
tion of the Virgin and the bright rays of the sun made the
stars of the constellation invisible to the eye. In the Book
of Numbers it is related that Miriam was excluded from
the Israelite camp and not allowed to show her white,
leprous face for seven days, and some writers interpret the
account of this incident as an allegory comparable to the
period in which the celestial virgin cannot be seen. It is
three weeks before the sun makes sufficient progress through
the sign of Virgo to enable that constellation to be seen by
the unaided eye emerging from the other side. In church
calendars this day, September 8th, is devoted to the Nativity
of the Blessed Virgin.
At the time of the equinox in March, the Virgin was
honored with a festival which originally belonged to Tam-
LUNAR MYTHS AND CULTS 49
muz as the springtime sun. At this time, crescent-shaped
cakes or buns were eaten in honor of the goddess just as
Christians today eat hot cross buns on Good Friday. In
Phrygia the festival was held at the same time in honor of
Attis; in Greece and Rome the day was dedicated to Cybele
and called Hilaria because of the joy occasioned by the re-
turn of the warm rays of the sun at the spring equinox.
Later the Roman Church changed the festival to Our Lady
Day or Day of the Blessed Virgin.
The baking and eating of cakes at this season in the
form of the crescent moon and often containing a cross or
representation of the virgin goddess is one of the oldest
customs known.
IV
LUNAR AND SOLAR MYTHS
IN ADDITION TO THE niyths derived from the ancient be-
lief that the moon was a Generator of Life, Goddess of
Motherhood and Regulator of Fate, the moon was the sub-
ject of another type of myth in which her monthly changes
were thought to be the result of a conflict between deities.
It was a contest between the god of light, or the Overworld,
and the god of darkness, or the Underworld, in which each
contestant triumphed in turn over the other. With the
growth of sun worship, the myths which were based upon
this theme began to partake of a solar character.
The underlying motifs of the light and darkness myths
were growth and decay, life and death, day and night, sum-
mer and winter, which seemed to constitute systems of
pairs or opposites by which all life and activity in the
universe was maintained in a state of balance by the
opposition of natural forces.
The mother goddess cults generally deteriorated gradu-
ally into sex worship and finally passed from the world's
stage, leaving only a mass of myths and superstitions, but
the light-darkness myths contained the germ from which
developed the great "ethic" religions which now for up-
wards of 2500 years have played a great part in molding
civilization.
The principal feature which distinguished the Light-
Darkness stories from religious parables was that they did
not convey any moral or deal with good and evil in the
modern sense. There was no Heaven or Hell, no future re-
ward for a good life or punishment for an evil one. The
myths were simply allegories of the various aspects of the
sun and the moon.
Although the earliest known records of the Egyptians
show that they believed in reincarnation, a future life was
not given as a reward for a good life. The only requirement
was that the individual should have appeased the gods with
the customary gifts, prayers, and sacrifices. Displeasure of
the gods brought punishment, not in the future, but here
on earth, in the form of illness, disease, famine, hardship,
and poverty.
50
LUNAR AND SOLAR MYTHS 51
The Babylonian Underworld was not a place for punish-
ment of sinners but was a cold, gray cavern where the dead,
both good and bad, sat around silently until the end of time.
It was the product of a philosophy of life similar to that in
Isaiah 22: 13 which says, "Let us eat and be merry for to-
morrow we must die," or the cynical philosophy of Ecclesi-
astes: "Yea, though he live a thousand years twice told, yet
hath he seen no good: do not all go to the one place?" (Eccl.
6:6)1 "Never", said Euripides, "is the good separated from
the evil; there must be a mixture of the one and the other."
Light was not in itself a complete entity: it required
the Darkness to make it whole, just as the male required
the female. As a positive current of electricity is without
force unless accompanied by a negative current, so, in early
times, the god or power of Light was considered incomplete
without the power of Darkness to give it contrast, opposition,
force, and completeness.
Opposition or apparent conflict between the ascending
and descending phases of the moon provided the underlying
motif for the story of the Two Brothers, called the "parted",
which, in various forms, is found in mythology all over
the world. In the zodiac they are thought to be represented
as Gemini, the Twins. In China they appear as Oph and
Shichim; in India they are Cristna and Balarama; in Egypt,
Sut and Horus. Some students of comparative religion see
similar motifs in the conflicts between Abel and Cain and
Jacob and Esau.
The descending half of the moon was often depicted as
the Dark One, the Deceiver. In another type of myth, the
descending moon becomes the Manifester, the Precursor or
the sacrificial type and the ascending half is portrayed as
the Bringer of Light, the Savior or Redeemer. The full moon
is, of course, the Virgin Mother, the Queen of Heaven.
In Egyptian mythology, the ascending phase of the
moon as the reflector of the sun's light is represented by
the god Horus who is portrayed as the Eye of the Sun. The
dark phase is cau~ed by Sut, the demon of Darkness, who
steals or wounds the Eye of Horus. On ancient monuments
he is shown with the head of a jackal, which fact proclaims
him as the night prowler and the thief of light.
Plutarch said that "the festival in honor of the sun was

52 SYMBOLS, SEX, AND THE STARS
held on the 30th day of Epiphi, called 'the birthday of
Horus's eyes', when the sun and moon were supposed to be
in the same right line with the earth".
To andent Hindus, the sun was the Eye of Varuna and
Agni; to Persians, the Eye of Ahura Mazda; to Greeks, it
was the Eye of Zeus; and Macrobius said it was the Eye
of Jove. Early Teutons regarded it as the Eye of Wotan
or Woden, and in Java and Sumatra the sun is called Mata-
ari, "the eye of day".2
The moon at full is the mirror of light; hence it is
sometimes depicted as the mother or reproducer of the
sun's light and becomes his consort during the hours of
night when the sun is invisible or is in the Underworld. In
thus reproducing the light of the sun, she is represented
as being the mother of his child. The Egyptian lunar god
Taht or Khensu is sometimes pictured with the Eye of
Horus, or the new moon, in his hand and the goddess Meri
bears the eye upon her head as typical reproducer of the
child, the "Bringer of Light".
The lore of many primitive peoples contain countless
myths of this nature which appear without meaning until
examined from the standpoint of sun or moon mythology.
An example is found in old traditions that the Egyptian
Sut-Horus, the Hindu Buddha. and the Christian Jesus,
were all born from the side of their mothers. Again, in the
case of both Indra and Jesus, the growing embryo was said
to be visible whilst in the mother's womb, which was rep-
resented as being transparent. The child Jesus was so rep-
resented in Christian pictures of the enciente Virgin Mary.
As these legends are based upon a physiological absurd-
ity, their origin is inexplicable until compared with lunar
phenomena. Then, it becomes apparent that the legends
had their origin in the passing of the moon from the full
to the dark phase, when the round orb decreases in thick-
ness until it assumes the thin crescent shape. As the light
portion of the moon decreases, the dark area increases or
seems to grow in size; also, due to the reflection of light
from the earth's surface, the dark area is dimly visible
to the eye. This is the dark little one developing in the
womb of its mother, the birth taking place from the side.

LUNAR AND SOLAR MYTHS 53
In Hindu legends, Cristna is depicted as having been
torn from his mother by a single black hair; and Balarama
was similarly torn from his mother by a single white hair.
This legend is explained by the fact that as the moon be-
gins to wane, a thin rim of shadow appears on the right
side. This may be likened to a single black hair, while, in
the transition from dark to light phase, the first thin arc
or rim of light may be likened to a single white hair.
One of the titles bestowed upon Ishtar is Goddess
Fifteen, because in a solar month of 30 days, the journey
of the moon may be said. to consist of 15 steps upward
and 15 downward. The authors of the apocryphal Gospels
of Matthew3 made this phenomenon the basis of a fable
about the Virgin Mary, thus proving that the Babylonian
myths were known in Judea at the beginning of the
Christian era and that some gospel writers were not averse
to using them to their own ends.
It is stated that when the Virgin was a three-year-old
infant, just weaned, she was taken by her parents with offer-
ings "therewith to the temple according to the Psalm of
degrees, fifteen stairs to ascend". There, according to the
Gospel,4 the infant Virgin readily ascended the steps unaided
like an adult.
Another version of this story is repeated in Protevan-
gelion,6 where it is said that when the Virgin was nine
months old her mother placed her on the ground and "when
she had walked nine steps, she came again to her mother's
lap". A similar legend of the infant Buddha credits him with
taking a step in each of the four cardinal directions shortly
after birth.
In another place it is said that when Mary was three
years old her father and mother took her to the temple
where she was received and blessed by the high priest and
"he placed her upon the third step of the altar and the
Lord gave her grace and she danced with her feet and all
the house of Israel loved her".6
3-In the early years of Christianity there existed a great number
of gospels some of which were held in the same esteem as the
present Gospels. Many of these were declared Apocryphal or
Pseudepigraphical at the Council of Nice and others were
eliminated during the Protestant Reformation.

SYMBOLS, srnx, AND 'l'HE STARS
That early writers were in the habit of taking an old
myth and adapting it, or parts of it, to new uses is illustrated
by a Greek myth which relates that Hephaistos ascended
from the Underworld riding on an ass or swine, which he
made drunk before directing him up to heaven. In the
apocryphal Gosepl of James, the author represents the Virgin
Mary as riding on an ass when Joseph saw her laughing on
one side of her face and crying on the other, probably to
identify her with the light and dark phases of the moon.
She is lifted from the ass and gives birth to the child of
light in a cave.
One type of myth frequently found in Babylonian and
Egyptian literature introduces a figure which symbolizes
evil in every part of the world. Here the gradual disappear-
ance of the moon in the last half is represented as being
due to its being swallowed by a serpent. In sun worship
the serpent becomes a water dragon or crocodile which
swallows the setting sun as it sinks into the sea.
During eclipses the Chinese rent the air with cymbals,
trumpets, and clanging instruments to frighten away the
dragon which they believed was swallowing the moon.7 It
was from this superstition that the ascending node of the
moon was called "the head of the dragon" and the descend-
ing node became known as "the tail of the dragon". In
India there is a myth which tells how Vritra or Ahi, the
serpent of night, was vanquished by Indra, a great sun god.
This myth may allude to the bright light of the sun over-
coming the constellation of the Dragon in the northern
heavens.
In Australia and in some parts of North America the
role of the serpent was taken by a great frog. In Egypt it
was the great god Apep which battled with Ra and Horus,
both solar heroes. In the Babylonian Epic of Creation the
sun hero Bel-Merodach (Marduk) slays the monster Tiamat
(chaos and darkness) in a battle in which Bel turns against
the open-mouthed dragon a wind storm of such violence
that the wind filled its belly and "its belly was stricken
through".
Many centuries later the same story was incorporated
into the Jewish writings as a historical incident in the life
of Daniel. According to this story, the King of Babylonia
7-The Chinese word for eclipse means "eat".
LUNAR AND SOLAR MYTHS 55
had a great dragon which Daniel slew by throwing down
the throat of the monster, a fire-ball composed of pitch, caus-
ing the animal to burst and die. In the Aramaic language
used by Daniel, the word for windstorm reads almost the
same as the Babylonian word for pitch, so, in the Biblical
version one interpretation of the word was merely substituted
for the other.
In the Egyptian Book of the Dead, the power of Dark-
ness is frequently portrayed as a black jackal, fox, or other
predatory animal and disappearance of the moon is pictured
as due to its being gradually devoured by this evil animal.
Eclipses were widely believed to be due to the sun or moon
being swallowed by a dragon or jackal. Primitive people in
many countries threw stones at the moon or sun in an effort
to frighten the devourer away. This practice has been
observed by travelers among primitive pepple in modern
times. In ancient Rome, when it was believed, during an
eclipse, that the moon was being swallowed, the people
shouted "vince luna" to encourage her. In many parts of
the world, especially in Scandinavian countries, the devourer
is often pictured as a wolf.
In Greek mythology the story of Kronos tearing Uranus
into fourteen pieces is but another version of the gradual
dismemberment of the moon during the fourteen days of
its waning period.
The same motif is also found in an Egyptian myth
related by Plutarch wherein Typhon (Darkness), the Evil
One, while hunting at night, finds the dead body of the
sun god Osiris (Light) prepared for burial and, fearing
that in a future life Osiris might again appear to destroy
him, tears the body into fourteen pieces and scatters them
far and wide. Isis, the consort of Osiris, travels from coun-
try to country to find her slain lover. In her wanderings
she is followed by scorpions, a feature which betrays the
zodiacal character of the story for the star Sothis is the
star of Isis, and in the zodiac it is followed by the con-
stellation of Scorpion. Isis finds and assembles the pieces
of Osiris's corpse, but cannot restore life to the body because
she is unable to find one part, the organ of generation.
The story of Isis wandering in search of her lover
follows the pattern of· Ishtar's search for Tammuz. Like
that of many other gods, the character of Osiris is a hybrid
one. In many respects he appears to be a sun god, yet he
56 SYMBOLS, SEX, AND THE STARS
is the patron deity of agriculture and in many aspects is
a corn spirit, while his reign of twenty-eight years and the
manner of his death indicates that at one time he was
probably a moon god.
During the annual festival of lamentation for the death
of Osiris the priests poured out libations of milk each day
from 360 vases to denote the days of the primitive year
in which the sun pursued its course. At Acanthe, near
Memphis, on the Lybian side of the Nile, an annual memorial
feast was held in which 360 priests carried water from the
Nile and poured the water into a large reservoir, perforated
at the bottom, thus symbolizing the days of the year and
the ceaseless lapse of irrevocable time.8
Osiris died on the seventeenth day of the month Athyr
(i.e., in the waning moon), when the sun entered the lower
signs of the zodiac which symbolized the Underworld. On
the nineteenth of the month the priests proclaimed that
Osiris was found. According to the mythic mode of repre-
senting the phenomenon, the absence of moonlight for about
three days between old and new moon was due to the lord
of light in the lunar orb having been swallowed by a mon-
ster dragon, or fish, and remaining in its belly for three days.
In the Babylonian pantheon, the water god Ea ruled
over the slimy waters of the great "deep" out of which the
world was formed. In token of this tradition, a large basin
of water was kept in all Babylonian temples. Ancient
myths represent Ea as being a friendly deity who rose out
of the sea each morning to teach man agriculture, civil gov-
ernment, handcrafts, and other arts of civilization. In early
sculpture he is portrayed as half man and half fish and
was probably the original Aquarius, the water man in the
zodiac, as well as the forerunner of Neptune.
In later versions, Ea appears as Joannes and, as the
fish god Dagon, he was worshiped by the Philistines. Ac-
cording to some interpretations, Ea or Joannes represented
a primeval sun god who spread his benefactions over the
earth and, at the close of day, dropped into the sea to spend
the night beneath the waves like a fish.
In Hindu Brahmanism, the god Vishnu, in his first
incarnation, is alleged to have appeared to humanity in the
form of a fish, or half man and half fish, exactly the same
&-Indian Antiquities, by Thos. Maurice, v. 6, p. 143.

he is represented as a fish and as being swallowed
by a fish.
57
as Ioannes or Dagon was represented among the Chaldeans
and other peoples. In the Indian version, Manu, the Hindu
Noah, was saved by Vishnu who, in the form of a fish,
dragged Manu's boat to the top of a rock. Davkina, the
consort of Vishnu, seems to be the same as Dav-ki or
Damkina, the consort of Ea.
The Greek myth of Hercules and Hesione describes
the slaying of darkness by the sun god. It relates that after
King Laomedon of Troy had bound his daughter Hesione
to rocks by the sea, a sacrifice to Poseidon's destroying
monster (darkness), Hercules (the sun), saved the maiden
by leaping fully armed into the fish's gaping throat and
cutting his way through the monster's belly. The rescue
of Andromeda by Perseus is another version of the same myth.
The story of Jonah being swallowed by a whale and
then thrown on the shore at Joppa, after three days in its
belly, contains several elements which connect it with the
story of Hercules and Hesione. It may also be compared
58 SYMBOLS, SI<JX, AND 'l'HE S'l'AUS
with Oannes being swallowed by Tiamat, the dragon of
darkness, at the time of the winter solstice.
In early Christian centuries, a Greek sculpture of An-
dromeda's monster was used as a model for Jonah's whale.
In Pliny's time, the remains of Andromeda's chains were
exhibited on a rock along the shore at Joppa and the bones
of a whale were taken to Rome as relics of the monster.9
Several other features in the story of Jonah's escape
from the belly of a whale point to the mythical origin of
the story. After his escape, Jonah went to Nineveh and
there told the story. One of the emblems of Nineveh, the
capitol of Assyria, was a fish in a basin of water. Salli-
mannu, "the god of peace", was depicted as a fish god of
the city Temen-Sallim, "the foundation of peace". According
to Sayce, the royal scribe of Sadikan, now Arbon on the
Khabur, was named Sallimannu-nunu-ilani, "Salamannu the
fish god is king of the gods".
The name of King Solomon, "the peaceful one", is so
familiar in sound and meaning to that of the fish god Sala-
mannu that some writers have suspected the story of
Solomon was drawn from a far older source than has been
attributed to it. The brazen bowl mounted on twelve bulls
which was found in Solomon's temple may have had the
same significance as the fish basin in Nineveh. Every
Greek temple had a basin at its entrance for the holy water
of the fishes and there is a basin of water, called Piscina,
in the entrance of every Catholic church.
In the Vedas, the sacred books of the Hindus, the earth
is represented as a huge fish which swallows the red sun
at the end of day and casts him out again at sunrise, just
as the whale cast out Jonah. In Polynesian mythology, the
earth is frequently pictured as a huge fish. (See Tylor,
Early History of Mankind, p. 345).
The story of Jason and his companions sailing away
in the ship Argo in search of the Golden Fleece is another
type of solar allegory. Jason's 50 companions (some writers
say 52) on his travels were drawn from the 50 or 52 weeks
of the year in which the sun pursues his celestial· course.
The Golden Fleece which Jason sought may be an allusion
to the fleecy, golden clouds at sunset.
9-Primitive Culture, Tylor, v. 1, p. 333.
LUNAR AND SOLAR MYTHS 59
Clouds are also allegorized as celestial cows and a
myth relates that Hermes stole the "cloud cows" of Apollo
on the day of his divine birth.. In the Rig Veda clouds are
called "the cows of Indra".
The numbering of Jason's companions after the weeks
in the year is rather similar to a myth of the sun god
Helios in which he is said to have had 350 head of cattle
(7 herds of 50 each). Likewise, in the Veda, the sun god
is blessed with 720 twin children, i.e. 360 days and 360
nights and his chariot is drawn by 7 horses, i.e. the 7 days
of the week.
The Biblical account in which 365 kings minister to
Nimrod is thought to stamp him as a solar character. Of
Enoch it is related that, like the sun gods, he lived 365
years and was a builder of cities. It is not related that
Enoch ever died, but "Enoch walked away with Elohim
and was no more" (to be seen). Ascensions to heaven are
generally acknowledged to be characteristic features of
solar myths.
It is said (Gen. 14:14) that Abraham enlisted his 318
trained servants to fight against the Elamites. In the
354-day lunar calendar the moon was considered to be
visible on 318 days and this fact has led some writers to
suspect that the 318 soldiers who helped Abraham destroy
his enemies were the 318 moonlit nights of the year. At-
tention has also been drawn to the coincidence that at
the first Council of the Roman Church, held at Nicea in
325 A.D. there were 318 bishops present.
In some of the Light-Darkness myths night is por-
trayed as a lustful female who swoops down upon, overcomes
or ravishes the sun and saps his energy at the end of day.
In others the goddess of dawn is pursued and overcome
by the rapidly advancing rays of the morning sun. In the
Rig-Veda, a hymn says of Ushas, goddess of dawn, that "she
bares her bosom" to entice the sun god to pursue her.
Elsewhere, it is said, of the overcoming of dawn by the
sun, that "Prajapati loves his own daughter and forces her."
From myths, which represented the setting sun as being
devoured by a reptile, there developed another type in which
the heroes were pitted against great bulls, dragons or other
monsters representing the dark powers of nature. The
myths of Zeus, Apollo, Helios, Orion, Kronos, Siegfried, St.
George, Hercules, all contain this motif.
60 SYMBOLS, SEX, AND THE STARS
As early as the fifth century B.C., Pausanius observed
that the Twelve Labors of Hercules represented the annual
passage of the sun through ~he twelve signs of the zodiac.
His opinion was supported by the Scholiast of Hesiod which
says that "the zodiac in which the sun accomplishes its
annual course is the real career of Hercules".
The frequent identification of sun gods with goddesses
who symbolize fruitfulness and productivity is exemplified
by the association of Hercules with Omphales, a goddess of
procreation, and with Iole, the daughter of Eurytos, "the
copious flowing", a goddess of procreation who is fructified
by the heat of the sun.
In another myth, Hercules marries Hebe, a goddess
who renews her youth each year. This story was probably
inspired by an old legend that the sun (Hercules) renews
his strength at the end of each annual journey.
In 1773 Semler stated that the Biblical Samson is, like
Hercules, a hero of the sun type and this fact is now recog-
nized by practically all Biblical authorities. He is from the
tribe of Dan which means "judge", a title which is often
bestowed upon the sun god Shamash. The name Shimsohn
(Samson) means "little sun". Although the name iden-
tifies him as a solar type, the story of his exploits has
many lunar characteristics, a peculiarity which is to be
found repeatedly in the adventures of mythical solar heroes.
Another characteristic of solar myths is the miraculous
birth of the sun god by a virgin goddess and the account
of Samson is, at least, partly in harmony with this tradition.
It is related in the Book of Judges (13:3) that an angel
appeared before Samson's barren mother and informed her
that she would conceive a man child who would be con-
secrated a Nazarite or holy man. Manoah,10 the name of
Samson's father, is related, cabalistically, to Jahveh and is
mentioned several times, but the name of the mother seems
to be withheld intentionally. In the story's earliest, most
primitive, form the mother was probably represented as
a virgin goddess. If so, her name was eliminated centuries
later, when the story was placed in the Scriptures.
The character of the Samson story is further indicated
10-The name Manoach has a numerical value of 104, which is 4
times 26, the number of Jahveh. See chapter on the Cabala.

by the fact that all of the central figures in the Hebrew
sacred writings from Abraham to Moses were miraculously
born. Sarah, Rebekah and Rachel are represented as having
been barren and, before the births of Isaac, Jacob and
Joseph, an angel appeared before the women and informed
each one, in almost identical language, that she would con-
ceive and bear a child. The same story is repeated again
in the case of Samuel's birth.
The close connection between some of the feats of
Samson and those of Hercules again illustrates the manner
in which the adventures of mythical heroes find their way
from country to country under different names and guises.
The first Labor of Hercules was the killing of a lion, which
represented the passage of the sun through the zodiacal
sign of Leo. The first feat of Samson was also the killing
of a lion. Hercules carried away the gates of Cadiz and
Samson did the same thing with the gates of Gaza.
The death of Hercules at Cadiz was an astronomical
allegory representing the end of the year, when the sun
reached the most westerly point in its annual journey at
the time of the winter solstice, in the sign of Capricorn.
(See Death and Re-Birth of the Sun Gods). The gateway
of the sun was considered by ancient astronomers to be
between Capricorn and Cancer, from which the Tropics
are named. The gateway was marked by pillars which,
62 SYMBOLS, SEX, AND THE S'.rARS
according to .the myth, stood at the Straits of Gibraltar.11
Samson started for Gaza at midnight and did not
sleep until morning, which is a lunar characteristic.12 His
death occurred under the pillars which supported a banquet
hall in Gaza where a feast was being held in honor of the
fish god, Dagon. According to Sir William Drummond, Gaza
signifies a goat, the zodiacal sign of Capricorn.13
As the Samson story is given in the Book of Judges,
he is accompanied on his adventures by 30 companions;
he slays 30 men at Ascalon and takes from them 30 changes
of clothing, the repeated use of 30 coinciding with the 30
days of the solar month.
When Delilah asks Samson the source of his strength,
he tells her that if he is bound with 7 new bow strings, his
strength will depart although, when she so binds him, he
breaks the strings with ease. Then Delilah binds him with
7 new ropes which also fail to hold him. Next, Samson
confesses to her that if his 7 locks of hair are shorn, all of
his strength will surely vanish. The story does not speak
of an indefinite number of locks; there are 7, no more, no
less. Similar stories which tell of the sun being bound by
ropes or being retarded in its course are to be found in
many lands.
If the story of Samson is read merely as a simple nar-
rative it appears preposterous for it cannot be imagined
that Samson would deliver himself into the hands of an
intriguing enemy female and tell her how he could be
rendered defenseless. It acquires meaning and significance
only when considered as a lunar-solar myth. The 7 bow
strings then represent the first 7 days of the new moon
when it is increasing in vigor and power. Next, the 7 ropes
are broken, making in all 14 bindings which fail to hold
him. The number 14 indicates the number of days which
bring both the moon and Samson to the peak of their power.
When the moon is full, the powers of Light have overcome
the powers of Darkness, the "Philistines".
11-The Phoenicians settled a colony upon the Straits of Gibraltar
at Gadis or Gades, on the western coast of Andalusia, which is
the modern Spanish city of Cadiz. According to tradition, there
was at Cadiz, in ancient times, a statue of Hercules with a gate
on his shoulder.

LUNAU AND SOLAU MYTHS 68
But, as soon as the moon passes the full, ·the dark
forces renew the attack and this time are successful because
the moon begins to become emaciated and lose strength in
the 7 days of the moon's third quarter, symbolized by
Samson's loss of the 7 locks of hair. ·
In the final period, the fourth quarter, the powers of
Darkness are in control and the moon is deprived of its
light. In like manner, Samson, deprived of his strength,
is seized by his enemies who bind him, put out his eyes,
and thrust him into a dungeon. But, knowing that the
moon will rise again to renew the contest, the authors of
the legend, in order to maintain a consistent parallel, inform
us that Samson's hair immediately began to grow again,
intimating that he would soon be ready to renew the battle.
Luxuriant hair and tremendous strength are symbolic
of the productivity of the sun god in summer. Loss of the
sun god's hair often symbolizes the winter season, when
. trees lose their foliage. The earth, on whom the sun pours
his fructifying warmth, is the lustful female who saps his
vitality, so, when the growing season is over, the sun be-
comes a weak old man, bound and blind. In the Greek
myth of OEdipus, which is somewhat similar to the story
of Samson, the unfortunate hero tears out his eyes near
the end of his career, the loss of his sight representing the
declining period of the sun when the clouds of darkness
are closing around him.
Again, like Hercules, Samson is identified with three
women, only the name of Delilah being given. Her role of
destroyer of manly vigor seems to be indicated by her name
which means "longing, languishing", and which may be
construed as conveying a sense of weakening or drooping.
In this respect her character is comparable to that of Ishtar
in the Gilgamesh Epic. In an incident in which Ishtar asks
the sun god to be her lover, he charges her with being
an enchantress, poisoner, and destroyer of male potency
very much as folklore continues to represent the moon at
the present time.
Gilgamesh accuses Ishtar of witchcraft, criticizes her
for her murderous lust and merciless cruelty and declines
to become her consort. She becomes enraged and connives
to have Gilgamesh destroyed, but is unsuccessful.
The myths of Ishtar's plotting against Gilgamesh and
Delilah's betrayal of Samson employ one of the most popular
G4 SYMBOLS, SEX, AND THE S'l'ARS
and widely used themes in all literature; the vindictiveness
of the woman who is spurned by the man to whom she has
offered her charms. This theme appears in the story of
Joseph and Potiphar's wife. Because he refused to accept
her invitations, she ·reported that he had made improper
advances to her. The Egyptian Book of the Dead and other
early records contain many versions of this story, indicating
that in ancient times it was as popular in literature as it
is today.
The Babylonian Epic of Creation
(The Seven Tablets of Creation)
This poem, called enuma elis la nuba samamu, gets its
name from the first words meaning "When on high the
heavens were not named." The first fragments of the poem
were found in Assurbanipal's library in 1873 by George
Smith and are believed to have been adapted somewhat
earlier than 2000 B.C. from mythological conceptions of a
far older period.
The epic is thought to symbolize the triumph of the
springtime sun over the storms of winter or the light of
day over the darkness of night. It was probably written
for the purpose of glorifying the local god of Babylon, rais-
ing him above the older Sumerian gods when Babylon be-
came the political center of Babylonia during the first Ham-
murabic Dynasty. It reveals how the priests and politicians
of Babylonia contrived to alter the ancient pantheon of gods
for political purposes. But the particular interest which
the poem holds for modern readers is due to an account
woven into it of the creation of the universe, which account
is strikingly similar to the Biblical story of creation.
The epic begins before creation when the universe
consisted of a vast waste of slimy water. Heaven and earth
were as yet non-existent, nor had the waters of the bottom-
less abyss been divided into lake, sea, and river. First,
there is the creation of the primeval gods Apsu, Tiamat
and Mummu. Then the gods Lahmu and Lahamu, mean-
ing sea serpent, are formed. After many ages, the male
god Anshar (host of heaven) and the female Kishar (host
of earth) are created. From them are born Anu, Bel, and Ea.
Apsu, Tiamat, and Mummu become resentful of the
latter gods and conspire to destroy them; but, after a great
LUNAR AND SOLAR .MY'.l'HS

65
war, all the conspirators are killed except Tiamat, who
creates 11 monstrous animals for her protection.
Anu, Bel, and Ea then urge the sun god Marduk to take
up the task of destroying Tiamat (the deep), now believed
to have represented the Persian Gulf, symbolizing darkness
and chaos. Marduk agrees only after he has exacted a
promise that, if he is successful, he shall be made supreme
ruler of the universe.
The fourth tablet describes the sun god going forth
in his chariot to battle with Tiamat. After a terrific struggle,
he catches her in his net, kills her with an arrow and
splits her carcass in two parts "like a shellfish" and from
them makes heaven and earth. He binds her auxiliaries
with cords and seizes the tablets of life. He draws off her
skin and commands the watchmen to prevent her waters
from escaping. Then the skin is stretched and placed as
a canopy in heaven, separating the waters of heaven from
those of the earth and stars are placed in the heavens as
dwelling places of the gods, Anu, Bel, and Ea.
Only 25 lines of the fifth tablet were recovered. It
describes how Marduk placed the lights in the heavens and
ordained their regular courses, placed the 11 monsters in
the heavens as constellations of the zodiac as stations for
the gods, divided the year into seasons and placed 3 stars
in the heavens to mark each month. He placed his own
star in the sky as the star Sirius, the chief light of the
66 SYMBOLS, SEX, AND THE STARS
firmament; he then caused the moon to shine forth to rule
the night, granting it a day of rest in the middle of the
month (that is, at the full m,oon) and made the sun to rule
the' day.
It describes how the wind blew the blood of Tiamat
away to secret places, presumably indicating that it formed
the Red Sea. There is a break in the tablet here, but it
appears that Marduk placed his net in the sky as a con-
stellation along with )lis bow, as the Bowstar or Canis Major,
the bow of the hunter Orion. The winds are tamed, bound,
arid placed in the four points of the compass. The tablet
ends with a hymn of praise to Marduk which credits him
with separating the sea from the land and of creating the
vegetable world.
In the sixth tablet, the gods marvel at the accomplish-
ment of Marduk but complain that there exists no one to
pay them honor. Marduk then slays Kingu and from his
blood a man is formed. The gods of heaven, earth, and
lower regions are assigned their several functions. He places
300 of them in the heaven, 300 to manage the ways of the
earth, and 50 for the lower regions. Then begins the con-
struction of Marduk's temple at Esagila. After the temple
is completed the gods hold a great banquet. They next draft
the laws and the fates of men for the coming year are
decided by "the 7 gods of fates". The poem closes with the
gods in the temple reciting the 50 names of Marduk.
Excavations at Ashur, in Assyria, have made consider-
able contributions toward completion of the text, but the
fifth tablet is still a fragment. Most of the sixth tablet
indicates that it was used as a liturgy in connection with
the great New Year's festival celebrated annually at Babylon
on the first 11 days of Nisan, at the spring equinox, when
it was customary for all the gods of Babylonia to be brought
in their sacred boats to assemble in Ubshukkim, the ·Hall of
Fates in Marduk's temple. At that time a number of festivals
were held, including mystery plays based upon events in
the poem. Only a few details of the rituals have been
preserved.
The creation of heaven and earth, the division of the
waters under the firmament from the waters above the
firmament, the placing of stars and planets as lights in the
heaven, the division of the days and seasons of the year,
the creation of the vegetable world, the making of man on
LUNAlt AND SOLAR MYTHS 67
the sixth day and completion of the labor on the sixth day
so completely parallel the Biblical version of creation that
there can be no doubt the authors of the Book of Genesis
were familiar with the Babylonian story and adapted it to
fit their own purpose.
The term used in the Jewish manuscripts for firmament
means "what is spread out". This description corresponds
with the manner in which Marduk stretched the skin of
Tiamat over the heaven.
Tiamat, who is used here as a symbol of ·the chaos
and darkness which prevailed before creation, is comparable
to the Biblical expression T'hom (Gen. 1:2) meaning "the
deep". Apsu the consort of Tiamat seems to have been
represented originally as the mother of Ea, the god of
primeval water. The son and messenger of Apsu and
Tiamat is Mummu, meaning "intelligence". The Bible says
that "In the beginning" God created the earth, but the
Jerusalem Targum says "By His Wisdom", which is the
attribute of Mummu.
The large basins of water in Babylonian temples were
called "Apsu". These, presumably, symbolize the waste
of waters which, according to Babylonian traditions, was
the original source of all earthly life and, in this sense,
Apsu, the mother of Ea, personified the universal female
principle.
In Solomon's temple there was also a basin of "molten
brass",14 the meaning or purpose of which is nowhere men-
tioned in the Bible, but which seems to have had the
same significance as the Babylonian Apsu.
Gilgamesh Epic
Several ancient Babylonian versions of the Deluge have
been discovered within the last century, the one best known
being that given in the Gilgamesh Epic. It contains two
separate narratives, the first being a solar myth portraying in
allegorical form the annual course of the sun, rising to its
full strength daily at noon and annually at the beginning
of summer and sinking gradually to the western horizon
to return, in due time, to the abodes of man. It is written
on 12 tablets symbolizing the 12 months of the year. The
story of the Deluge is contained in the second part and is
14-See I Kings 7:23, II Kings 25:13, 16,17, and Jer. 52:17.
G8 SYMBOLS, SEX, AND THE S'l'ARS
of but minor importance in the poem, which is thought to
date from about 2000 B.C.
Gilgamesh, the hero of the story, is represented as a
king of Erech, a city of Sumeria. He is now thought to
have been a historical character who ruled as the fourth
king of the first dynasty of Erech in about 4500 B.C.
In the first tablet the goddess Aruru creates a kind
of "wild man of the woods" named Engidu to act as a
rival to Gilgamesh whose power and tyranny have begun
to be a burden to the people. In order to get Engidu away
from his desert home and his beasts, a "shamkhat" (joy
maiden) from Ishtar's temple is taken to him. When they
approach Engidu, this woman opens wide her garments,
exposing her charms and yields herself to his embraces for
6 days and 7 nights and gratifies his desire until he is won
away from his wild life. He eventually meets Gilgamesh
and the next three tablets relate their friendship, quarrels,
and adventures, the first of which is a battle with a myth-
ical monster named Khumbaba. After Gilgamesh slays the
monster, they return to Erech where Gilgamesh adorns
himself in kingly robes and receives the acclaim of the
people.
The sixth tablet is interesting because of its reference
to the Ishtar-Tammuz myth, which was inseparable from
that of the Great Mother Goddess. Goddess Ishtar becomes
enamored of Gilgamesh and invites him to be her lover,
promising him great wealth and honor. But he, knowing
the fickle manner in which she has treated other lovers,
scornfully repulses her.
Enraged at being thus humiliated, Ishtar pleads with
Anu to send a mighty bull to slay Gilgamesh and Ea creates
Gudanna, "the celestial bull", which appears to be the con-
stellation Taurus. The tablet, containing a description of
the battle has been destroyed, but it seems that Gilgamesh
finally killed the celestial bull with a sword, while Ishtar
looked on in anger. Gilgamesh dedicated the horns of the
bull to the sun god; after he and Engidu had washed their
hands in the river Euphrates, they returned to Erech,
where they were again received with honors. Then Engidu
died, by means which are not made clear, although one
version indicates that he was poisoned by Ishtar, who had
been offended by him.

Deeply grieved by the death of Engidu, Gilgamesh
decides to seek immortality from his ancestor Ut-napishtim
and his wife who are the only mortals ever to achieve
eternal life. He journeys to a high mountain lying on the
western horizon between earth and the underworld, the
gates of which are guarded by huge scorpions whose backs
reach to heaven and whose fore feet reach down to the
underworld. They recognize Gilgamesh as a king by his
regal bearing and advise him to turn back. Before him,
they say, lies the region of darkness where for 24 hours he
must travel before again emerging into daylight. But Gil-
gamesh will not be dissuaded. After a day's journey he
comes upon the wonderful garden of Edinu by the sea,
where majestic trees bear lapis lazuli and gems of fruit.
Here the sea goddess Siduru, a version of Ishtar, directs him
to Adad-Ea, the ferryman, who takes Gilgamesh across the
dreadful waters of death to the Elysium where dwells
Ut-napishtim.
When Gilgamesh finally meets Ut-napishtim he is too
ill to leave his boat but tells his relative the object of his
journey. Ut-napishtim sorrowfully tells him that death is
the fate of all mankind. Gilgamesh is still inconvinced.
Then Ut-napishtim relates how the Babylonian Noah, named
Xisuthrus, was warned of the Deluge.
70 SYMBOLS, SEX, AND THE STARS
Ut-napishtim mixes a magical compound containing
seven ingredients for Gilgamesh which causes him to sleep
deeply for seven days. When he awakes, h_e still requests
the· secret of eternal life and, at length, is taken to where
the plant of life can be found growing at the bottom of
the bitter sea, which is apparently the Persian Gulf. On the
way back to Erech, Gilgamesh decide<;). to bathe; and, while
he was out of his boat, a serpent smelled the plant and
carried it away. As the serpent left it cast off its skin and
it was the serpent and not man that received the power to
renew its youth.
The Deluge
A warning from Ea came to Xisuthrus in a v1s1on,
warning him of the coming Deluge and telling him to build
a ship or ark, shaped like a cube and measuring one hundred
twenty cubits on each side. In it he built six floors, each
being divided into seven compartments of nine rooms each.
With many men working, the ark was built in four days,
laid down on the fifth, loaded on the sixth and finished on
the seventh day in the month of Tishri-tu, which would be
in autumn. The ark was made water-tight by caulking the
outside with bitumen and the inside with pitch.
Xisuthrus gave a great banquet and took into the ship
living seed of every kind; all his family and household, his
gold, silver, and other possessions, the cattle and beasts of
the field, handcraftsmen; all that was his.
Then a storm raged for six days and nights and on the
seventh day the flood abated. A swallow was then sent out
to find land, then a dove, then a raven. When the raven was
seen wading in shallow water, the anchor was thrown out
and the ark landed on Mount Nissi, in Armenia. Xisuthrus
then released all of the animals to the four winds, set up
an altar on the mountain top, and made an offering to the
gods, who were drawn like flies to the feast by the sweet
smell of burning cedar, myrtle, and the sacrificial offering.
After the feast Xisuthrus disappeared and was seen ,no more.
The story ends with the god Enlil expressing regret
for having caused the flood and vowing that never again
will he smite every living thing.
The adventures of Gilgamesh are thought by some
authorities to be a primitive allegory of the seasons, the

encounters with the bull, lion, and various mythical animals
comprising the signs of the zodiac. According to· this theory,
the monster Khumbaba is Leo, the lion; Ishtar is Virgo; the
bull slain by Gilgamesh is Taurus; the Scorpion-men repre-
sent Scorpio; the sea goddess Siduru is Capricorn, the fish-
tailed goat. The eleventh chapter corresponds to the rainy
season in the sign .of Aquarius when the Deluge occurred
according to Babylonian legends. The return of Gilgamesh
to Erech, in the twelfth chapter, may symbolize the re-
newal of life and vegetation· with the return of the sun
after completing its annual revolution.
Other tablets have been found containing ancient ver-
sions of Creation, the Fall of Man, and the Deluge, one of
which relates how Marni, the great primeval mother god-
dess cast her incantations upon fourteen pieces of clay
"seven on the right she placed and seven on the left she
placed" and created them "in her own image".
One of the most interesting discoveries was that of a
triangular fragment in the British Museum, which was first
observed by Professor Sayce and was copied by Stephen
H. Langdon in 1912.15 Later, the missing pieces were found
and the six columns of the tablet were practically restored.
The tablet gives a description of Paradise, the Fall of Man,
15-See University of Pennsylvania, Publications of the Babylonian
Section, 1915, Vol. 10, No. 1.
72 SYMBOLS, SEX, AND THE STARS
and the Deluge which is about one thousand years older
than the Biblical version.
The tablet begins with the earth god Enlil destroying
humanity by a deluge, assisted by the earth goddess Nintud
under the name of Ninharsag. The flood lasts nine months,
during which man dissolves like tallow and fat, but Nintud
contrived to save the king and certain pious persons by
warning them to escape in a boat.
After the deluge, Nintud is represented in conversation
with the hero, who appears to be a king named Tagtug.
The god Enki reveals the secrets of the universe to Tagtug
and engages him as a gardener in Dilmun which corresponds
to Paradise. Enki instructs Tagtug regarding the plants and
trees whose fruits the gods permit him to eat, but Tagtug
eats of the cassia tree, which is forbidden by Nintud, where-
upon he loses the privilege of immortality which he enjoyed
before the deluge. Henceforth he is merely a mortal man,
subject to toil, illness, bodily weakness, old age, and death.
The Land of Dilmun is a historic land mentioned in
several very early records, and is described as being located
far south of Babylon along the eastern coast of the Persian
Gulf. Ancient Babylonian maps show the world as a flat,
circular surface around which flows the Persian Gulf, called
the "bitter stream". This corresponds exactly with the river
which, in the Biblical version, issued from Eden then
divided into four branches. According to the tablet, these
branches would be identified as the Indus, the Nile, the
Euphrates and the Hiddekel, which flows before Ashur.
Many primitive nations had myths describing the jeal-
ousy of the gods toward the creatures they had created
and whom they made subject to disease and death because
of a "fall" from grace. This is the substance of the story
of the Fall of Adam and Eve, who, before their transgression
in the Garden, were immortal.
If these Babylonian stories are as old as they appear
to be--and no scholars question their age-it is apparent
that they were known in Babylonia from 600 to 2000 years
before the date assigned· to Moses. Possibly Abraham was
familiar with them before he migrated from Ur to Canaan.
It has been reported that when discovery of the Deluge
story was first announced, one great religious organization
immediately leaped to the conclusion that it would be found

to refute, for all time, modern critics who denied the his-
toricity of the Deluge. Learned priests were sent hurriedly
to the scene, to make copies of the cuneiform tablets, so
that confirmation of the Biblical narrative could be pro-
claimed to the world. But the project was abandoned
quietly when the tablets were found to confirm the mythical
origin of the Biblical account.
Recovery of these ancient records, and the discovery
that many of the "Mosaic Laws" were derived from the
Code of Hammurabi, some of the Laws having been in
use for 2,000 years before the time of Moses, have been.
supplemented by the many other findings of modern re-
search. These discoveries have caused higher ecclesiastics
to discard theories regarding the origin and nature of the
Bible which had been defended vigorously for centuries.
The far reaching effects of these changes of viewpoint
become apparent when it is considered that for over 2500
years the Jews have believed that the first five Books of
the Bible were given to Moses on Mt. Sinai, at least part
of the record having been written in God's own hand.
(Deut. 9:10). According to Bible chronology this took place
in 1510 B.C.
Inasmuch as the record came directly from God himself,
it must be accepted as perfect in every word, letter, and
comma. The slightest imperfection would condemn it as
the work, not of God but of man, and the Israelites were
warned of the terrible consequences to those who should
question the divine origin of the record. When the Chris-

SUN AND MOON WORSHIP AMONG THE JEWS
EFFORTS OF THE early leaders of Israel to exterminate the
sun and moon cults constitute one of the longest and
most bizarre struggles in history. Details of the struggle
are of special interest to people of Christian countries be-
cause the religion of the Jews became the foundation stone
of the Christian religion. Had the pagan cults triumphed,
the whole course of western civilization would have been
far different.
But to assume that all sons of Israel were firm believers
in Jahveh1 and, therefore, unanimous in their hatred of
the heathen cults would be far from the truth. The Scrip-
tures make clear the fact that, from the Mosaic period on-
ward, a considerable number of Israelites found the warm,
sensuous rites of Baal and the Mother Goddess more attrac-
tive than the cold, stern worship of Jahveh.· There were
serious defections among the Israelites while they were still
wandering in the Wilderness.2
Later leaders found it necesary to exhort their followers
repeatedly to avoid the worship of Chemosh (Shamash),
Baal, Moloch, Dagon, Venus, Milcom, and Ashtoreth, the
Queen of Heaven, "the whore of Babylon,'' and their idols,
images, sacred groves, and "high places". The Books of
Judges, Chronicles, and Kings, particularly, are filled with
accounts of the constant, bitter, and bloody struggle to
exterminate the heretics.
Moses had assured his people that they were esteemed
by Jahveh "above all the nations of the earth";3 if they
worshiped no other god but him, he would help them over-
come their enemies and lead them into a land of milk and
honey. But many were unconvinced. They admitted that
they could not destroy their enemies because the latter
were stronger4 or had chariots of iron11 and complained of

Jahveh's failure to help them subdue the inhabitants of
various parts of Canaan.
Many of the Israelites seem to have considered Jahveh
to be a mere tribal god, holding supreme power over them,
but powerless against their enemies. Their Syrian neighbors
believed that Jahveh was a mountain god who reigned in
the hills, but was ineffective in the valleys.6 Belief in one
Supreme Deity, Lord of all the peoples of the earth, was,
as yet, far beyond popular comprehension.
With the exception of the forty years during the reign
of King David in which the efforts of Samuel succeeded
in unifying the people, there was constant "back-sliding"
by the men and women of Israel who forsook Jahveh to
worship the heathen gods of the Canaanites.7
It is evident also that despite the professed hatred of
Israelite leaders for all rites and customs identified with
the pagan cults and, particularly, anything of Babylonian
origin, there were certain notable exceptions. Although Ex-
odus informs us that in the statutes and commandments
which Moses gave to his people the death penalty was pre-
scribed for magicians, foretellers, observers of time (as-
trologers), wizards, sorcerers, necromancers, etc., enforce-
ment of these laws was far from consistent. The pages of
the Old Testament contain many accounts of mysteries,
miracles and magic; but instead of the exponents of prophecy
and magic being vigorously exterminated, they were most
often highly honored.
All leaders of Israel either consulted foretellers and
magicians, such as the prophetesses Miriam,8 Deborah,9
Huldah,10 and the witch of Endor11 or they practiced prog-
nostication and magic themselves, Moses being the most
famous magician and foreteller of all. Joseph had a repu-
tation as "revealer of secrets" even as a boy. When only
seventeen years old he amazed the Pharaoh of Egypt with

given in marriage the daughter of Potiphera, the priest of
On, the king's chief astrologer.
From early times, the priests of Israel were called by
names which signified they were astrologers or "dividers
of the heavens". There was a loosely drawn distinction be-
tween true and false prophets and between priestly prophets
and lay prophets, but the distinction was not consistently
observed, as may be seen in the fact that some of the
accepted prophets were women. In general those who
made prophecies of an orthodox religious character were-
approved, while those who resorted to astrological horo-
scopes and fortune telling for profit were condemned.
Encouraged by Solomon and the many other sun-
worshiping kings who followed King David and the sub-
sequent disintegration of the monarchy, the worship, of
heathen gods increased at an alarming pace. The Biblical
record for that period states that ". . . now for a long
season Israel hath been without the true God and without
a teaching priest and without law."12 The people consulted
observers of time, wizards, necromancers, etc.; made molten
images, paid honor to the "Sun, moon and stars and all the
host of heaven" and worshiped Baal and Ashtoreth "on
every high hill and under every green tree."18
The spread of the pagan cults to every part of Israel
had been facilitated by ancient 'Customs regarding the setting
up of altars and offering of animals in sacrifice. Since the
days of Abraham these acts of religious homage had been
rights exercised, not by the priests alone, but by all sons
of Israel. As the customs were based on precedents set by
Noah, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and the express command
of Moses, they bore the full authority of sacred law.14
Samuel admitted that he was both a prophet (seer) , and
a worshiper at the "high places" or local shrines.16 The
customs prevailed during the lives of the great prophets
Amos, Hosea, Micah, and Isaiah yet none of them dared to
question the legality of the local shrines.16

·But the right of every son of Israel to set. up altars
and make sacrifices wherever he wished also made it easy
for back-sliders to practice their pagan rites, unseen by
the stern, disapproving eyes of the priests.
The struggle against the pagan cults was made even
more difficult by the fact that Palestine lay on the main
caravan route between Egypt and Babylonia. Both coun-
tries enjoyed great prestige because of their old and mature
cultures. Moreover, they possessed great wealth and mili-
tary power, which Israel had good reason to fear. In
722 B.C., Samaria was invaded by the king of Babylonia
who took the "Ten Lost Tribes" into captivity. In 685
B.C. Assyria attacked and made vassals of the northern
states. Relations with Egypt were strained and there was
con~tant fear of war. From the north the Scythians swept
down into Assyria and, after administering a stunning de-
feat to the Assyrians, marched on Egypt. Although their
route lay along the sea coast, and Palestine was not mo-
lested, the danger of an invasion by the Scythians produced
consternation in Israel.
Leaders of the Jews faced the possibility of their peo-
ple intermarrying with the Canaanites and gradually drift-
ing away from their leadership: they also foresaw the danger
of their people being absorbed culturally and militarily by
their more powerful neighbon:; to the north, south and east.
Israel was therefore between the jaws of a giant nut-cracker
which threatened the supremacy, if not the very existence
of Jahvehism. If these dangers were to be overcome, the
Jews would have to be welded into a nation quickly; thor-
oughly united by religion and government, and so com-
pletely set apart from all other nations that their identity
as a people could never become lost. At this critical period,
young King Josiah, apparently being deceived by the priests,
became involved in a daring act of trickery which was part
of a plan for purging Israel of its idolatry.
One day in 621 B.C. it was reported to the king that
Hilkiah, the high priest, had found in the temple "the Book
of Laws" which had been strangely missing since its re-
puted promulgation by Moses some 800 or 900 years earlier.
The story is best told in the 22nd and 23d chapters of
II Kings. But, before continuing with the results of this
discovery, it is necessary that a digression be maqe to speak
of _another important discovery.
l\n··
SUN AND MOON WORSHIP AMONG THE JEWS 79
While engaged in the preparation of a graduation thesis
for the University of Jena, in 1805, William M. L. De Wette,
decided that "the Book of Laws" found by Hilkiah was none
other than the Book of Deuteronomy. If Moses had placed
the Code of Laws in the Book of Exodus, reasoned De Wette,
why should he have written another Book treating of the
same subject in which he gave commands directly contrary
to those contained in the first Book. Yet, in Exodus, every
son of Israel had been commanded to set up altars and
offer sacrifices whereas, in Deuteronomy, observance of these
rites was denied to all but the priests.17
After careful study of the spirit and language of the
new Book, De Wette observed that it seemed perculiarly
well adapted to meet the situation confronting Josiah and,
in fact, appeared to have been written, not by Moses, but
by a much later author.18 Continued researches by modern
authorities have fully confirmed De Wette's keen deductions
and it is now generally conceded that Deuteronomy was
written (probably in Babylon) during the reign of King
Manasseh or King Josiah.
De Wette's discovery not only threw new light on
Deuteronomy, it also made it necessary to reconsider the
entire story of the life of Moses. Scholars had long known
that many details in the life of the great law-giver were
similar to events in the myths of the Greek god Bacchus.
Like Moses, Bacchus was born in Egypt, was found floating
in a basket and had both real and foster mothers. Like
Moses, he made water gush from a stone by striking it with
his staff; like Moses, he wore two horns on his head: he
became a lawmaker and wrote his laws on two tablets of
stone. Moses performed miracles with snakes and Bacchus
was always portrayed with snakes. Moses waved his staff
and made the waters of the Red Sea turn back and Bacchus
did the same thing with the waters of the Orantes river in
Syria and the Hydaspes in India.

18-In 1679 Spinoza observed that in the Pentateuch certain towns
and places bore names that were not given to them until several
centuries after Moses. Repeated occurrence of such expressions
as "the Lord said to Moses" and "Moses said," etc., also indicated
that the Pentateuch was written, not by Moses but by another
author writing about him. The fact that the Book of Deuter-
onomy described the death and burial of Moses was seen as
final proof of the theory.

O.T. see Unravelling the Book of Books, Ernest Trattner, 1931.

It has always seemed peculiar that the so-called Books
of Moses give practically no information about the culture
of the Egyptians during the four hundred years in which
the sons of Israel are said to have lived in Egypt. No men-
tion is made of Egyptian achievements in astronomy, mathe-
matics or architecture nor are the pyramids, the great monu-
ments and temples at Thebes and Karnak even mentioned
in the Scriptures.
It is equally strange that the Book of Exodus· gives
the only record we have of the plagues of Moses and the
slaughter of the first-born of the Egyptians. Yet, the sick-
ness, disease and death caused by these acts of vengeance
would have brought panic and disaster so extensive as to
make it inconceivable that Egyptian historians could have
failed to mention them.
Although· the Tell-el-Amarna tablets give much infor-
mation regarding Canaan at about the period of the Exodus,
they make no allusions to the Jews in Egypt or to the great
catastrophe caused by the events preceding their escape.
In their Exodus from Egypt, the Israelites are said to
have assembled right before the eyes of the Egyptians and
escaped by night to the Red Sea where, at the command of
Moses, the water rolled back and remained suspended in the
air until the whole caravan walked across the dry bed of
the sea to safety on the shore of Sinai.
The enormity of this miracle can better be appreciated
when it is recalled that offspring of the seventy-two descend-
ants of Israel who originally migrated to Egypt increased
with such rabbit-like rapidity that their number doubled
about every thirty years, so that, when the Exodus began
four hundred years later, descendants of the original group
numbered 600,000 men; the women, children and serv-
ants not being counted. This great army, with its cattle and
personal effects, traveling in Oriental fashion, formed a
caravan probably more than two hundred miles long. To
contrive the escape from Egypt of this great multitude of
people, then to make the waters of the Red Sea remain
rolled back until all of them had crossed would have been
a miracle of miracles.
The conclusions of modern authorities regarding the
mythical nature of the remarkable incidents in the life of
Moses and the discoveries regarding the authorship of Deu-
teronomy have been supplemented, in recent times, by the
SUN AND MOON WORSHIP AMONG THE JEWS 81
finding of important evidence concerning the authorship of
the so-called Priestly Laws, contained in other Books of the
Pentateuch. The ideas they contain, and the language em-
ployed, closely resemble the writings of Prophet Ezekiel
who was exiled to Babylon in 597 B.C. He is now generally
looked upon as the spiritual father of all the Priestly Laws,
although they were probably compiled by a group of exiled
priests in Babylon about 500 B.C. In 444 _B.C. they were
taken to Jerusalem by Ezra ,and proclaimed to the people
by Ezra and Nehemiah by almost the same method that
had been used to proclaim Deuteronomy two hundred years
earlier. But, let us return now to Deuteronomy.
When the Book of Deuteronomy was shown to Josiah,
he became terrified by the realization that for centuries his
people had not been governed by the "true" laws of Moses.
After consulting the prophetess Huldah, he assembled all
the people at the temple, read the long-lost Book to them
and declared that, henceforth, it would supersede all other
Books of Law.
The newly-found Book commanded all Jews to forsake
the heathen gods, customs, and rites and to pay obeisance
only to Jahveh. The death penalty was prescribed for
dreamers of dreams, foretellers, observers of time, magicians,
sorcerers, witches, enchanters, consulters of familiar spirits,
etc. Priests of the pagan cults were to be stoned to death;
all images, idols, pillars, groves, high places and altars were
ordered destroyed. Then a code of statutes was provided
which regulated the daily lives of the people, certain of the
statutes being intended forever to discourage marriage and
social intercourse between the Jews and the people amongst
whom they lived.
The new Book significantly abrogated the right of the
people to make sacrifices and set up their own altars. These
ancient customs had originated when the Jews were nomatlic
tribes and the new laws took recognition of their changed
status as an agricultural people. Thereafter the temple in
Jerusalem was to be the only legitimate sanctuary of Jahveh
and it was to be served only by the Zadokite, or hereditary
priests. Thus, by one sudden, shrewd maneuver, the author-
ity of the priests was greatly strengthened. Local shrines
were declared illegal, pagan cults and practices were out-
lawed, a line of social demarcation was drawn between the
Jews and their pagan neighbors and the ground was pre-
82 SYMBOLS, SEX, AND 'l'HE S'l'AUS
pared for a sweeping reformation. With prophecy discred-
ited and declared illegal, the day of the great prophets, who
had played an important part in earlier history, was coming
to a close.
After promulgating the new laws, Josiah went about the
country breaking down the high places and cutting down the
sacred groves. He destroyed the horses and chariots of the
sun god which the kings of Judah had kept in the suburbs;rn
he "brake down the houses of the Sodomites that were by
the house of the Lord, where the women wove hangings for
the groves."20 "He slew all the priests of the high places
that were upon the altars and burned men's bones upon them
and returned to Jerusalem."21 "He killed the priests who
burned incense to the sun, moon and to the planets and to
all the host (stars) of heaven."22 Then he killed the wizards,
the workers with famiilar spirits, astrologers, foretellers,
sorcerers, etc.
Even Solomon's temple was purged of idols and images
which had long been permitted to contaminate it. During
the reign of King Manassah and other pagan kings who pre-
ceded Josiah, Baal and Ashtoreth had been worshiped openly
in the temple and worship of Jahveh had become secondary.
The altars which King Manasseh had built in the two courts
of the temple and vessels which had been used in the wor-
ship of Baal, the groves and the host of heaven had been
permitted to remain in the holy sanctuary up to the very
time Deuteronomy was "discovered". The campaign which
he launched against pagan worship immediately thereafter
was begun for the specifie purpose of carrying out the
commands supposedly laid down by Moses in the newly-
found Book.
In considering the causes which spurred Josiah into
such sudden and violent activity it is very important that
we bear in mind the fact that other Books of the Pentateuch
contain substantially the same statutes against pagan wor-
ship and practices that are found in Deuteronomy. The Books
of Exodus and Leviticus give repeated warnings of the ter-
rible penalties prescribed for the worship of pagan gods,
19-Il Kings 23:11.
20-Ibid, 23:7.
21-Ibid, 23:20.
22-Ibid, 23:5.
SUN AND MOON WORSHIP AMONG THE JEWS 83
images and idols, for worship at high places, for practicing
magic and sorcery, for consulting wizards, witches, etc.28
If the statutes contained in these Books were trans-
mitted to Moses on Mount Sinai, they should have been
known to every son of Israel, yet Josiah knew nothing of
them until he read the Book of Deuteronomy. The priests,
judges and kings who had kept graven images, worshiped
at high places and consulted witches, wizards, etc. had done
so without having appeared to be aware that· they were
violating the commands of Moses.
Several other discrepancies in the record. also require
consideration. The Books of Judges, Samuel, and Kings are
supposed to cover nearly 1000 years of Jewish history, yet
they make no reference to Jahveh's talks with Moses; they
say nothing about the miracles Moses performed in Egypt, .
his passage of the Red Sea or his wanderings in the Wilder-
ness. Nor do they make any illusions to the stories given
in Genesis of Creation, Adam and Eve and the Deluge. Al-
though the names of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and Moses are
mentioned a few times, nothing is said about their lives and
they are treated as if they were merely obscure, legendary
figures.
On almost every page of the Books Amos, Hosea, Micah,
and Isaiah the great prophets complain that their people
have forsaken Jahveh to worship Baal, Ashtoreth and the
host of heaven. They give repeated warnings of the terrible
punishment awaiting those who worship the heathen gods
but, at no time do they refer to Moses as their authority
for such warnings.
It is now generally conceded by Bible authorities that
the legends and historical records appearing in the Penta-
teuch were put into written form about the seventh century,
possibly not more than 100 years before Deuteronomy.
Thereafter revisions and additions were made in the Books
up to the 4th or 3d century. Apparently the Jewish people
were not sufficiently awed by the commands given in
Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus and Numbers and it became
necessary for the priests to prepare a new Book (Deuter-
onomy), written in clearer· and much more vigorous lan-
guage, that is, the new work put more "teeth" into the

84 SYMBOLS, SEX, AND THE STARS
Laws. Then the new Book was presented to the people with
much dramatic fanfare. This was followed immediately by
a savage blood-letting which was calculated to instill so
much fear into the minds of the people that they would
not dare to continue worship of the pagan gods.
De Wette contended that the reason certain laws in
Deuteronomy contradict laws in other Books of the Penta-
teuch is because Deuteronomy was written at a later time,
to meet conditions which had not existed when the other
Books were written. But, in his effort to disprove the Mosaic
authorship of Deuteronomy, he failed to observe that there
was just as much reason to doubt the authenticity of all the
other so-called Books of Moses.
Despite the successful beginning of the young king's
ruthless campaign to eliminate worship of the heathen gods
by force, most of its effect was dissipated by a series of
tragic events which provided some of the darkest pages in
Israel's history. In 608 B.C. Josiah joined the Assyrians in
a war against the Pharaoh of Egypt and was killed in
Syria. Ten years later the Assyrian King Nebuchadnezzar
attacked Jerusalem, pillaged the temple of its treasures and
took back to Babylon as prisoners King Jehoiachin, his
wives, his court, and ten thousand soldiers and craftsmen.
This severe blow left the Israelites dazed and terror
stricken. Their grief, however, was perhaps due more to
their moral defeat than to their military debacle. The
promise that they would be made supreme over all other
people constituted the very keystone of their perpetual
Covenant with Jahveh, solemnly acknowledged by the rite
of circumcision. Now, at a time of grave peril, his help
was not forthcoming.
But, in truth, serious weaknesses in their religious
structure had been becoming more and more apparent over
a long period. Failure to subjugate completely their neigh-
bors in Palestine after several centuries of continual war-
fare and their inability to prevent calamitous invasions by
Babylonians and Egyptians had already cast a shadow of
doubt over their belief that they were under the special
protection of Jahveh.
SUN AND MOON WOHSHIP AMONG THE JEWS 85
As early as the eighth century, e;ome of the prophets
seem to have realized the futility of trying to maintain
the narrow, traditional belief that Jahveh was interested
in none but the Jews. First, Amos proclaimed Jahveh as
the apotheosis of love and righteousness, the supreme ruler,
not of the Jews alone, but of all the people on earth. Isaiah,
Hosea and Micah spoke in similar spirit and the Book of
Isaiah (26:19,21) even announces the coming of a Messiah,
the creation of a new heaven and earth following the
judgment and destruction of evil.24
According to the primitive beliefs of earlier days, Jahveh
was a dual personality, combining good and evil natures.
Repeatedly the Bible speaks of him as being jealous, wrath-
ful, terrible, and revengeful;25 of practicing deception and
trickery on behalf of the Jews, and of sending destroying
angels or his evil spirit against those whom he wished
to destroy.26
The new concept of the prophets gave to Jahveh a
sublime, universal character which was completely lacking
in the former nationalistic concept, yet it is not apparent
from the Scriptures that the people quickly responded to
it, or that they even found it comprehensible. In the first
place; the prophets' version of a universal God of love and
justice was directly contrary to every premise on which
their religion was founded. If what the prophets said were
true, it could only mean that Jahveh had repudiated his
Covenant with them or that such a Covenant had never
existed, and all the claims and promises made by the
24-The authorship and date of the prediction of a coming judgment
cannot be placed with certainty. Cheyne's Encyclopedia Biblica
places it at about 334 B.C. Older theories attributed the whole
Book of Isaiah to the eighth century but parts of it refer to
events which occurred as late as the 2nd century and modern
authorities concede that most of the work is by writers of
much later date, with only a small portion of the Book being
by Isaiah. "Chaps. 40-66 have no title and make no claim to be

patriarchs, prophets and leaders, from Abraham to Isaiah,
had been a cruel fraud upon the people.
After having it dinned into them and their forefathers
for centuries that Jahveh was terrible and revengeful, they
were now asked to believe that he represented love and
righteousness. After being asked to believe that he cared
only for the Jews, they were now asked to believe that he
loved their enemies as much as he loved them, even
including nations which worshiped other gods and knew
nothing of Jahveh.
But some prophets continued to believe that Jahveh
cared only for the Jews and as late as the seventh and sixth
centuries some of them looked forward to a day of judgment,
after which Jerusalem would be the center of Jahveh's king-
dom on earth. Some prophets asserted that the coming
judgment would be for the Jews alone while others pre-
dicted that non-Jews would be either annihilated or made
to bow and serve Israel.27
From evidence given in the Books of Kings it is apparent
that the great drift from Jahveh to the pagan gods which
occurred during this period and which Josiah's reformation
sought to overcome, was due in great part to the confusion,
bewilderment and lack of faith in Jahveh which the revolu-
tionary doctrines of the prophets had produced in the minds
of the people.
Their attitude toward Jahveh after Nebuchadnezzar's
invasion is revealed by Jeremiah, who warned them that
their humiliation (because of the invasion) was due to their
having turned their backs on Jahveh, and reminded them
that they still practiced their heathen rites and "children
cut wood and fathers kindle fires and women knead their
dough to other gods."28
When Jeremiah warned them that they need not expect
Jahveh to help them prevail against the Babylonians merely
because they were Jews and that they must earn his help
by their righteousness, he was denounced as a partisan of
Babylon, thrown into a dungeon, and narrowly escaped death.
When he addressed those who escaped the Assyrians
by fleeing to Egypt and urged them to return to Jahveh, they

greeted his pleas with scorn and told him that when they
baked cakes, burned incense, and poured out drink offerings
to the Queen of Heaven they were happy and prosperous
but since they had ceased such worship, "we have wanted
all things and have been consumed by the sword and by
the famine."29
In his exile in Babylon Ezekiel also lamented his former
days in Jerusalem saying that "then He (God) brought me
to the door of the gate of the Lord's house which was toward
the north and, behold, there sat women weeping for Tammuz,"
and at the door of the temple, between the porch and the
altar, there "were about five and twenty men with their
backs to the temple of the Lord and their faces toward the
east, and they worshiped the sun towards the east."30
In 586 B.C. Nebuchadnezzar again attacked Jerusalem
and broke down the walls, burned, and pillaged the holy
city and left it a desolate mass of ruins. King Zedekiah was
made prisoner, his eyes were put out and all of the city's
most worthy inhabitants were dragged away to Babylon.
This time Nebuchadnezzar made sure that destruction of
the city was so thorough that there would be no danger of
its rising again.
For centuries the prophets had thundered against the
abominations of the proud and powerful city on the Eu-
phrates. Now, by an ironic turn of fate, the inhabitants of
Jerusalem were forced to march as captives over 800 miles
of desert to that center of iniquity.
When the prisoners reached Babylon, the old city was
undergoing many changes. Although still the intellectual
and political center of southwest Asia, the capital was defi-
nitely on the decline. National unity had been strained
and weakened by rapid political and religious changes fol-
lowing a series of destructive wars which had brought the
Assyrians into power. Fifty years later Babylonia would
forever cease to exist as an independent nation.
A great increase in knowledge of astronomy in the
preceding centuries had also been gradually undermining
the powerful influence of the astrologer-priests and the peo-
ple were losing faith in gods to whom homage had been paid
since the dawn of history. Within a few years the situ-

ation was to become further confused by conquest of the
city by the Persians who were to bring with them the Indo-

supremacy of the old gods. (For Zoroaster, see Appendix.)
In the comparatively liberal, cosmopolitan atmosphere

mysticism, the Jews absorbed many new theories which am-
plified and filled gaps in their theological speculations. For
the Zoroastrians not only worshiped one supreme deity like
themselves, they had a more highly developed religious sys-
tem which included among its doctrines belief in the ex-
istence of a soul, free will, a mediator, a virgin born savior,
heaven and hell, purgatory,. angels, devils, a day of final
resurrection and judgment, baptism and catechisms.
Another significant di:fference between the religion of
the Jews and that of the Persians was that the latter
religion was more concerned with the individual whereas
Judaism, particularly in its older form, merely looked for-
ward to a time when all of its national enemies would be
annihilated, when Israel would be acknowledged ruler of all
the world and would enter a perpetual reign of peace and
prosperity. Being concerned only with the welfare of the
nation as a whole, its history, psalms and so-called Laws of
Moses gave no thought to individual immortality and resur-
rection. The only punishment to the individual, for dis-
obedience to Jahveh, came in the form of poverty, disease or
famine during his life on earth.
Despite Jahveh's disappointment with the children he
had created, it is not related anywhere in the Pentateuch
that .he ever warned either Adam, Noah, Abraham or
Moses of the end of the present world, or of a day of
resurrection and punishment for the wicked. The Fall of
Adam and Eve was charged, not to the devil, but to a
serpent. The stories concerning these characters had prob-
ably become part of Jewish sacred literature before belief in
the existence of heaven, hell and the devil was incorporated
in their religious philosophy.
The Zoroastrians, however, envisioned all worldly ac-
tivity as the result of a perpetual struggle between the forces
of Darkness and Light. To Ahura Mazda was credited all
that was good, just and beneficial to man while, to his
brother Ahriman, the Prince of Darkness, was attributed
all that was evil or harmful. In the final period, before the
SUN AND MOON WORSHIP AMONG THE JEWS 89
end of the world, Ahura would triumph over Ahriman;
then would come the resurrection and the reign of peace
and happiness on earth.
The despair into which they had been plunged by the
Captivity had made the Jews particularly susceptible to
dogmas which could be interpreted in a manner which
would help them to keep alive the old dreams of a day
when their nation would reign supreme. Therefore, when
the Exiles in Babylon became familiar with the Zoroastrian
philosophy, they were impressed profoundly. Nor could they
fail to see that by borrowing certain ideas from the new
religion, they would be able to strengthen some weak points
in their own.
If Jahveh loved all men, why was life on earth fraught
with countless dire inequalities and injustices? Why did
he cause some men to be born deaf, dumb, blind, malformed
or mentally defective? If he were perfect, how could he
create an imperfect man or an imperfect world? Why did
he create insects and vermin to harass his children, whom
he loved? Why did poverty, floods, famine and disease strike
haphazardly the righteous and unrighteous alike?31
Zoroastrianism had avoided embarrassing questions of
this kind by the appointment of separate deities for good
and evil and by the promise of a future day of judgment
and resurrection, when all of the injustices and misfortunes
of earthly life would be balanced by a life in heaven for
the good and punishment in hell for the bad. Ahura Mazda,
the god of righteousness, had been further relieved of any
responsibility for evil by the doctrine of Free Will which
made each individual accountable for his bad deeds.
These ideas soon began to find favor among Jewish
leaders and far-reaching changes began to develop slowly in
their theology. Back-sliders and doubters continued to be
warned that Jahveh was a terrible God of jealousy and ven-
geance but more and more emphasis was being placed upon
his role as the kindly father to whom the weary, the sick, and
the down-trodden could turn for help and consolation. Those
who found no relief from their pains and troubles in this

world could still ·hope for serenity and bliss in the world
to come.
Eventually Deva and Shaitan,82 the Persian names for
the cause of evil, became transformed by the Jews into
devil and Shatan (Satan) and troops of angels and devils
began going about their appointed duties. Adoption of the
devil as the cause of evil overcame some of the contradictions
in their older theology, but the method by which the Jews
grafted the Prince of Darkness on their religion added some
new and fatal inconsistencies. Satan is introduced in the
Scriptures in a casual manner, without any attempt being
made to rationalize the belief in his existence, or to integrate
him into the religious system. No explanation is made of
the time or manner of his origin or of his relation to Jahveh,
leaving the Book of Genesis as the only source of information
on the subject. And, inasmuch as Genesis states that Jahveh
alone existed before Creation, it must be assumed that he
created the devil during the creation of the universe or
afterward.38 On this basis, however, the real responsibility
for the creation of evil rests upon Jahveh. On the other
hand, if the devil were not created by Jahveh, that is, if
he came into existence independently, or if Jahveh cannot
curb or destroy him, then Jahveh cannot be omnipotent, and
the universal conception of him as All-Powerful cannot be
maintained.
When King Cyrus permitted the Jews to return to
Jerusalem, worship of the gods of fertility still persisted and
in 444 B.C. Nehemiah promulgated new laws to stamp it
out. Even as late as the Maccabeean period (165-135 B.C.)
many Jews kept pagan idols and wore amulets of pagan
gods. It is related that when Judas Maccabeus and his com-
pany went out to bury some dead soldiers, small images

33-Rabbinical literature also mentions Lilith (plural, Lilin) as the
source of all evil. She is represented either as a siren with long
hair or as a night monster who seduced men by evil night
dreams and this union produced devils, ghosts, and evil cre-
atures. The word was probably derived from the Babylonian
demon lilatu· whom the Jews worshiped in Babylon as the
goddess·of night or as a goddess of the stream. Isa. 14:2,3, 34:14
and Zee. 5:9 probably refer to Lilith. According to a tradition
prevalent in the Middle Ages, Eve bore demons to male spirits
for 130 years before her union with Adam. Another· version
makes Lilith Adam's first wife.
SUN AND MOON WORSHIP AMONG THE JEWS 91
of the pagan gods were found hidden under the coats of
every one of them.34 These were minor manifestations, how-
ever, and worship of Baal and the Queen of Heaven were
ne~rly over. By this time new ideas and problems had
developed to divert the minds of the people.
By 135 B.C. the Jews were split into warring factions
and before peace was restored more than five thousand
persons had been killed. On one side were the hereditary
priesthood, or the Sadducees, representing the older Juda-
ism. They accepted only the Books of Moses and resented
the intrusion of new ideas into the national religion. On
the other side were the lay priests, the Pharisees, who de-
fended the new doctrines of a future life, heaven and hell,
a resurrection after death, and a day of final judgment.
Zoroastrian influence was also reflected in a wave of Phari-
saic speculation concerning the coming of a Messiah.
By the end of the century, the end and renewal of the
world was an accepted belief of the Pharisees and by the
beginning of the Christian era it was accepted by practically
all Jews. Then, in order to find justification in the Scrip-
tures for the new beliefs, the rabbis devised new interpre-
tations for obscure passages by stretching and twisting the
meaning of words. Later rabbinic literature even rebuked
the Sadducees repeatedly for having denied that immortality
and resurrection were mentioned in the Books of Moses.
As a result of the adoption of belief in the devil as the
cause of evil there was a great increase in magic and de-
monism and these subjects continued to be conspicuous
features of Jewish literature for several centuries. Halluci-
nations, witchcraft, sorcery, epilepsy, blindness, fevers, in
fact every human ailment or misfortune was blamed upon
the devil, whose evil spirit was thought to have taken
possession of the afflicted person. With this development
faith healers and wonder-working holy men sprang up who
were reputedly able to drive out devils, cure blindness_, heal
the sick, raise the dead, and perform many other kinds of
miracles. (It was due to its having been born into this
atmosphere that Christianity was practically dominated by
magic and demonism until well after the Middle Ages. Even
today, they continue to be important phases of Christian
belief).

92 SYMBOLS, SEX, AND THE STARS
In 70 A.D. the Romans destroyed Jerusalem and dis-
persed its population. Fear that scattering the Jews over
the earth might cause their ancient records ·to become lost
led to the formation of a council of rabbis who met in Jam:Q.ia
about the beginning of the 2nd century A.D. for the purpose
of codifying the holy records and giving them permanent
form. The council decided that "divine inspiration" had
ceased in the age of Ezra and Nehemiah; therefore, all later
writings were excluded and the Scriptures were closed for
all time. Since then they have remained in substantially
the form in which we have them today. So, at a time ap-
proximately coincident with the birth of Christianity the
Jewish worship of Jahveh reached its final form. The long
fight to destroy the old Babylonian worship of the gods of
the sun, moon and stars had ended with the adoption of
a new theology and eschatology which would eventually
become general throughout the western world.
VI
SUN GODS AND OTHERS
As PRIMITIVE TRIBES gradually turned to agriculture, they
gave up their nomadic existence as wandering hunters and
shepherds and settled in clusters of rude huts which, in time,
grew into towns and cities. With the growing importance
of agriculture as the source of their food supply, they be-
came aware that it was the fructifying power, not of the
moon, but of the sun which controlled the forces affecting
their means of living. This led to the beginning of sun
worship.
The power of the sun was apparent, not only in the
changes of the seasons and the annual periods of plant
growth, but its friendly or unfriendly influence was also
seen in the times of drought and rainfall, as well as in the
periodic overflows of streams. Most of the earliest great
centers of civilization developed in the rich, alluvial valleys
of large rivers; therefore an accurate knowledge of the an-
nual floods bringing moisture and deposits of soil to the
bottom lands was of special importance. In Egypt, where
the growing of crops was entirely dependent upon the floods,
the New Year was reckoned from the summer solstice which
marked the annual rise of the Nile.
Whereas the computation of lunar periods required only
man's ability to count the nights of the moon on his ten
fingers, the needs of agriculture made it necessary to reckon
time in much longer periods. Both the development of agri-
culture and the use of solar time were, therefore, dependent
upon, and perhaps coincident with, man's learning to count
the days in a whole year.
Knowledge of the 365-day solar year appears in the
very oldest Egyptian records and seems to have been the
basis of the calendar used by the Egyptians as early as
4000 or 5000 B.C. To the end of a 360-day zodiacal year
they added 5 intercalary or epagomenal days which were
celebrated as the birthdays of the gods Osiris, Isis, Horus,
Typhon, and Nephthys. In the seventh century B.C., Thales
took the knowledge of the 365-day year to Greece.
Although the Babylonians do not seem to have employed
the 365-day year as early as the Egyptians, the change from
lunar to solar time, in the reign of King Sargon, is recorded
on a clay tablet dating from about 2850 B.C. (some author-
98
94 SYMBOLS, SEX, AND 'l'HE' ST.A.RS
ities say 3700 B.C.) while the earliest mention of the sun
god Shamash is thought to date from about 4200 B.C.
The Babylonians added an intercalary month to their.
360-day year once every 5 or 6 years. They observed .the
solstices and equinoxes which divided the year into seasons,
distinguished the planets from the fixed stars, and chart-
ed the motions and cycles of Mercury, Venus, Jupiter,
Mars and Saturn with surprising accuracy. Their theories
regarding the nature and movements of the planets formed
an important part of their system of astrology, of which
more will be said later.
The Chinese knew the exact, or almost exact, number
of days in the year and had a way of determining the
solstices and equinoxes as early as the time of Emperor
Yaou, 2356 B.C. They also had an intercalary system and
some instruments for surveying the heavens. In addition,
they had knowledge of the 5 planets, the 12 zodiac signs
and probably the 28 stellar divisions.
In the Babylonian time-system, the day was divided
into 12 double hours and the double hour was divided into
60 minutes. The unit of time was equal to about 2 minutes
of our time and corresponded to the time taken ·by the
sun to traverse a space in the heavens equal to its apparent
diameter. Four minutes of our time (l/360th part of a
day) was the estimated time required for an average walker
to cover 360 double cubits, and a great kasbu (21,600 cubits)
required 4 hours or the length of a night watch.1
This was the basis of the Babylonian method of reckon-
ing by 60 (1/6th of 360) which gave birth to the sexagesimal
system, the· division of the circle into 360 degrees and the
observation that 1/6th of the circle's circumference is ap-
proximately equal to its radius. From the 27"."day month
and the 360-day year they determined the relative value of
1-A double cubit was 10 handbreadths, 60 finger breadths or ap.
. proximately 39.24 inches, almost precisely the same length as
the French meter. The small cubit was one-half the larger unit.
A walker who covered 360 double cubits in 4 min. would walk
at the rate of 3.34 miles per hour. ·
Oriental philosophers estimated that a man in health makes
360 respirations in a Ghair !Ghari) time or about 24 min. This
is at the rate of 15 respirations per min. or 21,600 per day.
The earth makes a complete turn of 360 degrees on its axis
each 24 hours, therefore it turns 1 degree. for every 4 min. or
60 respirations. According to another Oriental system, it was
estimated that 15 twinkles of an eye equal 1 minute. The
division of the hour into minutes and seconds of our time was
probably the work of scholars of the Ptolemaic period, i.e., in
the 2nd century A.D.
SUN GODS AND OTHERS
gold and silver as 27 parts of gold to 360 of silver, or in the
ratio of one to thirteen-and-one-half.
Hipparchus .(150 B.C.) published a list of ten hundred
eighty fixed stars and closely estimated the distance of the
sun and moon from the earth. Aristarchus estimated the
diameter of the sun to be between 6 and 7 times that of the
earth, hence about 300 times its bulk. He estimated the
moon's diameter at one third that of the earth and its volume
about one-twelfth that of the earth.
Archimedes had made the first machine in which the
rotation of the celestial sphere and the changing positions
of the stars were simulated by the motion of a wheel.
By the time Alexandria became a part of the Roman
Empire, the radius and circumference of both the sun
and moon, and their distances from the earth, had been
determined.
About 100 B.C., Hero of Alexandria composed a book
in which he described the principles of about 100 mechanical
appliances, which included a cyclometer, a theodolite, and
a double forcing pump.2
When Julius Caesar commissioned the Alexandrian as-
tronomer Sosigenes to draw up a new calendar, in 46 B.C.,
the length of the year was fixed as 365 days 6 hours, the
same length as the year in the Babylonian calendar then
in use. The leap year was introduced into Egypt during
the reign of Pharaoh Euergetes I, in 238 A.D., to absorb
the annual difference of 6 hours between solar time and
calendar time.8
The general development of culture had kept pace with
progress in science and, centuries before the close of the
pre-Christian period, there had been created many of the
greatest' masterpieces of art, literature, and architecture the
world has ever known.
In view of the crude facilities then at hand, these ac-
complishments required remarkable intelligence, ingenuity,
and keenness of observation. Despite the advanced state of
society, and the amazing amount of knowledge which had
been amassed regarding the heavenly bodies, popular be-
liefs lagged far behind and very little of this knowledge was
reflected in the systems of worship. When Greek scholars

declared that the sun was not a god, but was a huge ball
of fire, they were berated as atheists. Myths and religious
beliefs which prevailed at the beginning of the Christian
era concerning the nature of the universe, its origin, age,
and structure were almost as ridiculous as the naive theories
which had prevailed several thousands of years earlier.
Somewhere in the dim past a belief had developed that
objects and activities existed in the heavens which were
similar in every way to those seen daily on earth. The earth
was merely a Microcosm of which heaven was the Mac-
rocosm. First, the sun, moon and stars, the wind, rain,
storm, lightning, etc., were personified and deified in the
image of man. Then, in order to provide explanations for
heavenly phenomena which were beyond their comprehen-
sion, the ancients endowed their gods with supernatural
powers.
Belief in the ability of gods and demons to transform
themselves into birds and animals, to defy the laws of
gravity, to change their stature from minute to gigantic pro-
portions, to render themselves invisible, or to perform any
other feat that man can conceive, is the oldest and most
primitive product of man's effort to think out the ways of
the world in which he lives. This presumed ability of the
gods constituted a magic formula which enabled mystic
priests to provide a solution for any imaginable problem as
easily as a magician takes rabbits out of a hat. Once the
belief in this supernatural power found its way into the
mores of the early peoples, their ability to distinguish be-
tween fact and fancy, possibility and impossibility, was
impaired and they became susceptible to belief in all kinds
of superstitions, myths, magic, and miracles.
With a supernatural explanation provided for all earthly
or heavenly phenomena, little incentive remained for seek-
ing their true or scientific explanation. Civilization was
thereby immeasurably retarded. As there was no limit to
what the gods could do, no story or theory regarding their
activities could be disproved, regardless of its apparent
absurdity, for who could place limits on the limitless?
Drawing their conception of heaven from the life which
they saw about them, the Accadians, in ancient Babylonia,
envisioned the sun as a plowman, who yoked oxen to his
glittering chariot and plowed his daily path through the
heavens. He was even likened to an ox himself, hence the

ecliptic was termed the "yoke of heaven," and the god Mar-
duk was sometimes called "the bull of light". The moon
was called "Enlil's strong calf". The moon goddess Nana
(Ishtar) was called "Anu's young heifer" and was portrayed
with horns.
The myths of other very early nations were equally
imaginative. In Egypt, the sun god Osiris was worshiped
as Apis the bull, and each year a sacred bull was led around
the walls of the city· or temple every day for 7 days. This
was probably the origin of the story of Joshua's command-
ing the ark to be borne around the walls of Jericho every
day for 6 days and 7 times on the 7th day with 7 men
blowing bugles. (Josh. 6:3,4).
A cow with a horned moon on her head was a symbol
of Isis, who, in one sense, was the moon. This was the
origin of the Greek myth of Io, "the chaste virgin" men-
tioned in the Prometheus of Aeschylus, and accounts for
her being represented with a horn on her forehead. loh is
Egyptian for cow, and Epaphus, the son of Io is derived
from Apis, the sacred bull. In the Persian sacred Book of
the Avesta the moon is said to be Gao-chithra, that is,
possessed of the seed or life principle of the cow which
symbolically represents all animal life.
In another account the heaven was a great cow, with
her head. ~o the west, t.he eartll. .between her fore and hind
feet, and her under parts studded with stars. According to
98 SYMBOLS, SEX, AND THE ST.A.RS
another version, the sky was a woman bent over, with her
hands and feet resting on the ends of the earth. She was
sister of the earth god. Seb. In the beginning, the sky god-
dess· Nut, or Neith, was locked in connubial embrace with
Seb until Shu the air god thrust them apart, whereupon
she remained fixed in the sky with the ships of the sun
and stars sailing across her body. This legend is similar to
the story in the Babylonian Creation Epic .in which Mardu).:
split the body of the female Tiamat, using one half of her
body to form the heavens and forming the earth from the
other half.
One of the labors of Marduk in the Creation Epic was
dividing the primeval waters, forming from one part the
waters which were thought to exist all around and under
the earth and forming from the other part the great body
of water which was believed to constitute the ":firmament
of heaven".
Over this celestial sea the gods sailed in boats. After
dropping to the western horizon at sunset, the sun was
said to spend the night paddling his heavenly craft back
to the east to repeat his journey the following day. Models
of such sacred boats were to be found in Babylonian temples,
and in Egypt they were carried in religious processions.
The Biblical accounts of creation seem to echo the Baby-
lonian story of the division of the firmament's waters, and
in the early centuries of Christianity the . nature of the
:firmament became a lively subject for speculation. Some
fathers of the church believed the :firmament was supported
by pillars at the four corners of the world. Saint Jerome
quoted Ezekiel to prove that God froze the waters of the
firmament at the time of creation in order to keep them in
place. For several centuries it was the generally accepted
view of the church that high over the universe there were
solid arches which supported the heavenly waters and that
angels opened windows in the firmament whenever the
Almighty wished to send rain upon the earth.4
In an Indian creation story, the earth was conceived
as resting on the back of an elephant which, in turn, stood
on the back of a turtle.
In another Hindu version of creation, a lotus is repre-
sented as rising from the navel of Vishnu. In the lotus

In early Egyptian sculpture, the sun is represented in
human form with the head of a hawk, emblematic of his
lofty and rapid flight. In later periods, he is represented
in Egyptian, Babylonian, Hittite, and Assyrian sculpture
by a disk which is sometimes winged, or surrounded by
radiating lines or rays, symbolizing the sun's rays.
Both in Egypt and in India, the sun was sometimes
represented differently for the various parts of the year.
In Egypt, the sun was represented in spring as a child and
in autumn as an old man. Osiris or Atum (Amon) was the
sun when it had set and was hid from view. Ra was the
midday sun.
In numerous myths the sun god was ~onceived as
flying through the heavens in a chariot drawn by four white
horses. (The Hindu version gives the sun god Surya seven
green horses.) Because of its rapid passage across the sky,
the sun was sometimes called in the Veda, "the quick
racer", "the runner", or merely "the horse", and one of
the epithets applied to the Greek Apollo is Hippo, meaning
horse.
On Assyrian monuments, the sun god is sometimes rep-
resented as a man standing on the back of a leaping horse.
In some countries, the horse became sacred to the sun, in
honor of whom it was burned as a sacrificial offering, and
a stable of sacred horses and a golden chariot were often
maintained in the temple of the sun god. When Josiah un-
dertook to exterminate sun worship among the Jews, one
of his acts was destruction of the chariot and horses which
King Solomon had maintained in a suburb of Jerusalem
in honor of the sun.
According to Herodotus, during the campaign against
the city of Babylon, the Persian King Cyrus exacted a
curious bit of revenge against the city for the loss of one
of the "consecrated horses of the sun" which was drowned
in an attempt to cross the river Gyndes. Cyrus made the
stream fordable for his army by dividing it into 360 channels,
corresponding to the passage of the sun through the 360
degrees of the zodiac.
The legend of the sun god flying through the heavens
in a chariot drawn by a fiery white steed is responsible for

the Greek myths in which Phaeton fell from his father's
chariot while driving it across the sky and of Bellerophon
similarly falling to his death from the steed Pegasus. When
the Jewish historians wrote that Elijah was carried in a
whirlwind to heaven in a chariot of fire and horses of fire,
they were merely telling the story in the popular literary
form. (II Kings 2:11).
In a theory of creation found in India, Egypt, Phoe-
nicia, Greece, and among the modern Polynesians and Finns,
the whole universe came from a cosmic egg. In the version
known at Memphis, in Egypt, Ptah (the opener) broke the
egg from which the sun and moon came forth. At Elephan-
tine, the creation of the world was attributed to Knum,
who molded the first man out of the mud of the Nile, like
a potter working with his wheel. Similarly a Greek myth
attributed creation to Prometheus who molded the first man
and beasts out of clay. Emanations of divine fire passed
into them and became their souls.
100 SYMBOLS, SEX, AND THE STARS
At Sais, in Egypt, creation was attributed to Neith, who
wove the universe as a weaver makes a piece of cloth. Ac-
cording to one account, the sun god Ra was called "the egg
of the cackler", because he was the son of Seb, a word which
is equated with "goose". In another myth, Ra was born as
a calf of the celestial cow or child of the sky goddess.
According to Japanese mythology, the universe egg was
broken by the horns of a bull. Almost every country seems
to have had myths asociating a bull with creation and with
the sun. He is the same heavenly bull which figures so
prominently in Hindu and Babylonian legends, the bull
killed by Mithra and who is identified in astrology as Taurus,
probably the first sign of the zodiac.
Man's eternal desire to solve the mystery of the origin
of himself and the universe led to the invention of equally
fanciful accounts of extraordinary acts of the spirits, demons
or gods to explain the cause and origin of all phenomena
to be seen on earth or in the sky. "Every race has had its
legendary accounts of the origin of things, and while cre-
ation myths can never be far in advance of the ideas and
sentiments of a people, they may and even do, lag far
behind. Religious conservatism makes adult nations slow
to put away the childish things that faith has once conse-
crated. If a creation legend has found its vater sacre, and
been incorporated with the ritual of the altar, scarcely any-
thing short of a miracle is strong enough to charm it away
from the popular mind."11
For untold centuries, fabulous accounts of creation and
the births and deeds of the gods were repeated by magi
and priests in thousands of temples, and accepted by the
devotees as eternal truths. Uncounted thousands of slaves
wore out their bodies building temples and ('.olossal monu-
ments in honor of the great gods and other thousands of
worshipers honored them with magnficent processions, cere-
monies, prayers, gifts, and the blood of human sacrifices.
Man was degraded and made to feel inferior by being taught
that all of his vices were his own fault but that all of his
virtues, all his accomplishments in his struggle against
adversity, were due to the benevolence of a friendly, all-wise,
all-powerful deity.

As the older, ·cruder beliefs became obsolete through
the evolution of society, they were succeeded by newer
forms, better adapted to the changing times, but based
upon the same old concepts. The magi who read the will
and intentions of the gods in the stars, or in the livers
of sacrificed animals, were succeeded by holy men of an-
other type, remarkable for the fact that but few of them
had normal minds or were educated according to the stand-
ards of their times. They were the prophets, seers, ascetics,
neurotic reformers, mystic zealots, fanatics, and hermits of
the desert who "heard voices", saw strange visions, and
were reputedly able to cure lepers, banish fevers, drive out
devils, heal the sick, and raise the dead.
Although their teachings varied greatly, the holy men
posed as the special spokesmen for the deity, describing
his thoughts and appearance and transmitting his commands
to the people. Inasmuch as they were esteemed as the very
voice of the deity himself, the utterances of the holy men
were listened to with great awe and reverence, the very
strangeness of their sayings often being accepted as proof
of their divine inspiration.
Despite the claims of the holy men to speak for, and
in the name of the Supreme One, it is impossible to point
to a single instance in which their "divine revelations"
104 SYMBOLS, SEX, AND THE STARS
regarding the creation and operation of the universe have
been c~nfirmed by the :findings of science.
No part of our knowledge of the heavens-the age, size,
form or composition of the earth, or the origin, species and
distribution of animal and plant life on its surface-has been
derived from the intuitive methods of the mystics: every-
thing we know about the universe has been learned by the
materialistic methods of science.
Probably no people in the ancient world felt the blight-
ing influence of holy men more than the Jews. They were
discouraged from studying the causes of natural phenomena
because all knowledge which God wished them to know was
supposed to be revealed in their sacred scriptures. To ques-
tion the accuracy of their holy records, or to attempt to
peer behind the veil of God's mysteries, was blasphemous,
and punishable by death.6
As a result of its discouragement of independent think-
ing, Judea made no discoveries in mathematics or astron-
omy; its artisans produced no great sculptures, monuments,
temples, public buildings, or feats of engineering comparable
to those of Egypt, Greece, or Babylon. Development of
handcrafts and ability to work in metal and stone in Judea
lagged behind that of its neighbors, and the contributions
which this small, uncultured country made to western
civilization were confined entirely to the field of religion.
When King Solomon decided to build his temple, skilled
workers in wood, stone or metal were not to be had in all
of Judea, and he found it necessary to appeal to Hiram of
Tyre for architects and workers. Traditions say that this
building, of simple design, and only about thirty feet wide
by ninety feet long, cost eight billion dollars and was the
marvel of the world, the envy of all nations. Yet, when
Herodotus travelled from Egypt to Babylon, he did not
deem it worth while to go by way of Jerusalem to see this
marvelous structure. When the invading armies of the
Scythians and Alexander the Great came down from the
north on their way to Egypt, plundering every city in their
path, they marched along the sea coast within a short
distance of Jerusalem without considering it a prize worth
looting.

One of the most persistent and widely circulated beliefs
in ancient times was that which represented the first gods
as bi-sexual. As life among the gods was thought to be
similar to that on earth, and as life on earth was seen to
result from a union of the male and female, ability of the
first god to create other gods (and men) was represented
in many myths as being due to his combining both male
and female sexes in one body. Ancient mystics and
metaphysicians were not handicapped by considerations of
earthly physiology or logic and therefore saw nothing extra-
ordinary or ridiculous in such a theory. Its wide popularity
is evident in the mention of hermaphroditic gods in the
oldest records of Babylonia, China, India, Egypt, and Greece.
In time, even minor gods were often represented as
combining both sexes.
Apollo was generally represented by the Greeks as
male-female and Bacchus was sometimes similarly repre-
sented. In his comment on the Timaeus of Plato, Proclus.
cites some Orphic verses to the effect that "Jupiter (Zeus)
is a man, Jupiter is an immortal maid". In the same com-
mentary, it is stated that all things were contained "in the
womb of Jupiter".7
Diana or Artemis had characteristics of both sexes. In
Cyprus, Venus was represented as Aphrodite and was some-
times given a beard and other male characteristics. Diana
was looked upon as having existed before Zeus and most
of the other gods. The poet Calvus spoke of her as mascu-
line and other writers called Jupiter the mother of the
gods. Agditis was originally of both sexes and seems to
have been transformed later, in the myths of Cybele and
Attis. Damascius cited Orpheus as teaching that, inasmuch
as the deity possessed the generative powers by which all
things were formed, he was, of necessity, both male and
female.
Polyhistor stated that there was a Babylonian tradition
that the first men had two wings and some had four wings
and two faces. Each had one body and two heads, one being
male, the other female. The body had both male and female
organs.

The Babylonian god Tammuz was consecrated a
Qedesha or harlot (I Kings 19:24) and Ishtar sometimes
wore a beard.
Porphyry acknowledged that Vista, Rhea, Ceres, Proser-
pine, Themis, Priapus, Bacchus, Attis, Adonis, Selenus, and
the Satyrs were all one and the same. According to the
Codex Vaticanus, in the western hemisphere the Mexican
bi-sexual deity Ometecutli was worshiped as the creator of
the universe.
Egyptian gods were often represented as masculine in
front and feminine behind, or human in front and of animal
form behind. As the Hindu Ardha-Narisvara or half-woman,
Siva and his consort Devi or Kali are united in one body,
the right side of which is male and the left side female.
In art the right side is usually painted red and the left
side is painted black.
The Books of Job8 and Isaiah9 represent Jahveh as hav-
ing male-female characteristics and other evidence indicates
that this tradition persisted among the Hebrews from very
early times. The first syllable of Jahveh (Jah) is masculine
and the second syllable (J;iavvah) is feminine, thus indicat-
ing the original conception. According to Prof. Langdon,10
the name appears to derive from Yaw or Yah, a pre-historic
title of the male-female moon-god among Semitic tribes of
South Arabia. The Jews added the female root, making the
word Yahweh or Jahvah. Due to an error in translation,
the name is spelled Jehovah in the Christian Bible.
Use of the title, however, was not confined to the Arabs
and Jews, as it appears in the records of several branches
of Semites. Ancient Assyrian texts refer to the same deity
as Ja-u or Ja-hu and on Neo-Babylonian tablets the name
appears as Ja-a-ma, which is pronounced Jawa.
In the temples of Egypt, Yahweh was worshiped under
the titles Y-Ha-Ho; Jao, Iao and law by Gnostic Christians,
whose rites and titles were so similar to those used in the
worship of Serapis that one could scarcely be distinguished
from the other. In fact, Emperor Hadrian in a letter to his
Consul, Servianus, expressed the opinion that the Christians
in Egypt wer~ worshipers of Serapis.

evil influences. The name law or Iawhe (Yawheh) frequently appeared
with a figure of Priapus, or Horus, and the mystic Gnostic word Abramas.
The figures were usually part man and pMt dog, snake, cock or Zion.

The Hebrew letters ( n,) EI (read backward as Yah)
are identical with the Greek letters IE which were carved
upon the front of the temple of bi-sexual Apollo at Delphi,
where priestesses chanted the phrase IEIE IEIE in his
praise. Practically the same sound and meaning was con-
veyed also by the term Yeye Yeye, which devotees. sang in
honor of Cristna in India, and by the term Euoe Euoe which
Bacchantes rendered in honor of Bacchus in Greece.
The word Aleim or Elohim which is employed 2570
times in the Bible as a title of God is also composed of male
and female roots and must be considered as having had
the same origin and meaning as Jahveh. Al, El, II or Ilah,
meaning lord, was a very ancient title of the sun among
Arabians, whence was derived the Mohammedan title of
Al-lah. Its equivalent in Hebrew is Eloah which becomes
Elohim by addition of the plural termination im. When read
backwards, im is pronounced mee, meaning who in the
sense of unknown or unknowable. Old Jewish traditions
say that the pronunciation of the word is as if one were to
say EL HEM, meaning "They are God".
From the tradition that the first gods were male-female
came a belief that the first man and woman were also
androgynous. As early as 3,000 or 4,000 B.C. oriental
creation stories described the splitting apart of the male-
female halves of the first androgyne at the time of creation,
as previously described in the story of the Babylonian female
Tiamat and the Egyptian story of Shu and Tefnut. The first
Zoroastrian couple was a two-faced androgyne which was
split apart by Ahura-Mazda.
In the centuries immediately before and after the
opening of the Christian era, speculation concerning such
matters became greatly intensified in the eastern Medi-
terranean countries. The period is noteworthy both for the
great number of mystic religious sects which sprang up
and for the extraordinary dogmas which they put forth.
To add to the confusion produced by the degeneration of
the old nature cults, Jews returning from Babylonian cap-
tivity and Greeks returning from the eastern invasion
brought back with them a mass of oriental ideas, which
produced the greatest plague of theories, mystic sects,
evangelists, metaphysicians, healers, and magicians the
world had seen up to that time.

A writer in the Talmud says of the creation of Adam
that "when the Holy One created the first man he created
him as a hermaphrodite, as it is written: 'male and .female
created he them'."11 Another account says that "when the
Holy One created the first man he created him with a
double face and then cut him into halves and gave him
two backs, one here, one there."
Many of the strangest anthropomorphisms of the period
were created by Gnostics, Basilideans, and Valentinians and
strongly reflected the influence ·of Babylonian spiritism,
which made the period reek with angelology, demonology,
witchcraft, devil-chasing and all other forms of magic. Seals
and lockets of these sects contained amulets and charms
with inscribed designs representing law (Jahveh) with
characteristics which identified him with the Egyptian gods
Osiris, Isis, Horus, or Serapis, or portrayed him as part
human and part cock, scarab, dog (Anubis), lion, snake
or other animal-as fanciful and childish in conception as
anything the primitive Sumerians had· imagined in 3,000
or 4,000 B.C.
At the beginning of the second century A.D. Elkesai,
the leader of a Jewish Gnostic sect, published a tract in
which he declared the primary man had been "revealed" to
him as a monstrous hermaphroditic being 96 miles high
and 94 miles in breadth and that the male-female ·halves
were cleft apart to form the Messiah and Holy Spirit.
Several centuries later orthodox Jews were offended by
another work called the Shi'ur Komah (Estimation of the
11-Bereshith Rabbah (Midrash Section 5:5). Also see Jewish Encv-
clopedia, v. 8, p. 558. Or Zohar, v. 1, p. 11.

Height) written by an Alexandrian Jew who attempted to
describe minutely the physical body of God; his neck,
beard, right and left eyes, upper and lower lips, ankles,
etc. But some of the most learned men of the orthodox
faith put forth theories equally preposterous. In one in-
stance the dimensions of Adam12 are described by a Cabalist
as extending from one end of the world to the other and
another writer describes a mystic angel called Sandalphon
whose "height is a walk of 500 years and who binds crowns
for the deity."13
Philo Judaeus frequently expressed the opinion that
the ideal man was born as man-woman, and Plato believed
that man was originally androgynous and had two faces.
Eusebius, the Christian Bishop of Caesarea, concurred in
this opinion and 'declared it to be in harmony with the
Hebrew Scriptures.
"Other theologians have upheld and accepted this, for
example, St. Augustine, de Gubbio (theologian to Pope Paul
III at the Council of Trent and Prefect of the Vatican
Library) and a minor friar Francesco Giorgio (1522) ."14
The learned Jewish philosopher Maimonides (12th cent.)
thought that Adam was created bi-sexual, with two faces
turned in opposite directions, the 'havah or feminine half
being separated from Adam during his deep sleep.
Fantastic as these theories are, the boundless credulity
which enabled the most learned of men to believe them
is even more remarkable. But in things pertaining to the
supernatural, time has a way of glossing over and impart-
ing respectability, prestige, and credibility to the wildest
products of man's imagination.
Had it been related to either Plato or Maimonides that
similar things occurred in their own time and in their own
communities, they .would doubtless have laughed off the
stories as preposterous, but neither of them saw anything
ridiculous in believing that such things could and did occur
in an earlier period. It does not seem that the great in-
ventors of tall tales ever realized that, if God had the power

to create man and woman at all, he could have done so in
a workmanlike manner and not have had to produce fabulous
monstrosities. Yet, in extenuation of their superstition, it
is only fair to admit that it is no more absurd to believe that
the first man and woman were split apart at the time of
creation than it is to believe that Adam was made from
mud and that Eve was shaped from one of his ribs. The
most marvelous things have always been represented as
having occurred, not right at home under the eyes of the
writers, but in the remote past, or in a distant town or
country, and the awe with which people still regard ideas
or things which are merely very old or exotic shows no
signs of becoming outgrown.
VII
DEATH AND RE-BIRTH OF THE SUN GOD
IN THE FERTILITY MYTHS, the sun was represented as a
handsome young god who impregnated the earth with his
life-giving warmth and life, thus being the source of growth
in vegetation and stimulator of the procreational activity
which caused animals to mate and bring forth their young.
Everywhere that sun worship flourished, the sun god was
honored as the Supreme Deity, the father of all creation.
In the Light-Darkness myths, the sun was portrayed
as a powerful blond hero who slew a serpent, dragon or
other animal which typified the dark forces of nature, the
darkness of night and the cold, dark days of winter.
Features drawn from both the fertility myths and the
Light-Darkness myths were represented in a third type
which reflected the prevailing theories concerning as-
tronomy and astrology. Where the old fertility myths had
depicted the sun god as the lover of a virgin moon or earth
goddess, the type now under consideration represented him
as the son of a virgin, both his birth and his death taking
place at the time of the winter solstice, in the zodiac sign
of Virgo, the Virgin.
Because it was believed that the sun regulated the
planting and harvesting periods, appointed and distributed
the seasons; ran through the climates, swayed the earth, ·
etc., the sun god was looked upon as a legislator, lawgiver,
conquering hero. Because the warm rays of the sun were
thought to promote cheerfulness and good health, he
was called the Bringer of Light and Enlightenment, Wis-
dom, Peace, Health, and Prosperity, the Good Physician
and Savior of Humanity, the Sun of Righteousness who
overcame disorder, chaos, strife, sickness and disease.
Probably no myth ever existed which possessed such
universal appeal. It was a synthesis of all solar myths. The
magnificent temples built in honor of the sun, the colorful
festivals, prayers, and rich gifts with which the people of
many countries honored him, testified to the implicit faith
and fervent reverence of millions of worshipers of the youth-
ful sun hero who died and was re-born to save humanity.

The ringing of church bells during funeral services was
believed to drive away the devils who waited to seize the
soul of the deceased.
In Japan the peach is the symbol of the yoni, therefore
peachwood staves were used in the demon-expelling cere-
monies on the last day of the year. At the phallic festival
of the Sahe no kami, or phallic deities, held at the first full
moon of the year, boys went about striking young women
with pot sticks used in making gruel. This practice was
believed to insure fertility. A similar custom has prevailed
in various parts of Europe within modern times. In the
vicinity of Roding, in the German Palatinate, a bride is
struck with willow or birch twigs as she walks from the
church door to her place at the marriage ceremony.
The universality of the language of symbolism is well
shown in the drawing, made early in the 18th century for
Dr. Engelbert Kaempher's History of Japan, and reproduced
on Plate 62. It represents the Chinese and Japanese fer-
tility goddess Kwan-non or Kwan-yin, whose name signifies
the yoni of yonies.
Ancient philosophers described her as the daughter of
Chong-wang, that is, Chong the phallus, or king of phallic
worshipers. Myths say that, like Ishtar, this yoni goddess
refused offers of marriage, and in consequence descended to
hell, which, because of her presence, lighted up like a
paradise to the horror of its lord, who thereupon returned
her to life on a lotus. Then she conferred youth and health
upon her aged father by flesh taken from her own arms and
ever since she has been shown with a thousand arms and
every earthly blessing.
Kwan-yin is equivalent to Kaiwan of the Ethiopians
and Egyptians; the Chiun or Kiun of the Hebrews; Kun,
Kusi or Kunti of the Hindus; and the queen, quean, qwan,
coinne or cwene of Europe. She is the great watery principle,
queen of heaven, lady of plenty; the virgin goddess of a
thousand arms who reigns throughout the world under a
thousand different names.
Dr. Kaempher said she is at times pictured as the multi-
mammia and, occasionally, is depicted with a mass of babies
who seem to grow out of her fingers, toes and, indeed, her
whole body. At other times she is a snaky fish goddess, in
which guise she is represented as worshiping the phallus and
moving in a sea of all things phallic.

The bell was a symbol of early Christianity and was
looked upon not only as the "call of Christ" but as the
sign of Christ himself. In Europe during the Dark Ages,
it was thought that if they were consecrated by baptism,
bells would prevent hail storms, tempests and lightning,
and banish demons.7
Such beliefs developed during the reign of Charle-
magne, and in 968, Pope John XIII gave them ecclesiastical
sanction by baptizing the bell of the Lateran in Rome and
christening it with his own name. Soon afterward church
bells everywhere were being given consecration ceremonies.

the pomegranates upon the hem of the robe, round and about

7-A bell at Basle bears the inscription "Ad fugandos demons". An-
other, at Lugano, reads, "the sound of this bell vanquishes tem-
pests, repels demons, and summons men". Another in the cathe-
dral of Erfurt declares that it can "ward off lightning and malig-
nant demons". A bell in the Jesuit Church at the University town
of Pont-a-Mousson bore the words "they praise God, put to flight
the clouds, affright the demons and call the people". History

The Egyptian hieroglyphic Ra (0) is a formalized
representation of an open mouth. As the source of the voice
or breath, it is related to the Holy Spirit. Because it is a
form of opening or entrance, the mouth is also a female
symbol. An open mouth with a protruding tongue is a
symbol of shame or astonishment, but it once had the same
significance as the Hindu yoni and linga. In some parts
of the East, natives still stick out the tongue as a token of
servility or submission in a sexual sense. Typical portrayals
of the Hindu goddess Kali show her, with extended tongue,
standing on the prostrate body of her husband. In the
legend, her gesture is said to be due to excitement after
killing a dangerous giant, but the Hindu Tantras explain
her victory as having been of a sexual nature.4
Bells are very old sexual symbols, the hollow bowl
being female, the clapper or tongue male. Oriental maids
wore bells until marriage to signify virginity. In Biblical
times Jewish girls wore bells; and, about or slightly above
the knees they wore a light chain. The custom caused
Prophet Isaiah to complain that impudent maidens walked
through the streets of Jerusalem with tinkling bells and a
mincing gait. (Isa. 3:16) .
Dr. Thomas Inman5 states that the custom arose
through a belief that violent movements of the body in
walking briskly or clambering over objects would break the
delicate membrane called the hymen which was evidence
of virginity. Therefore, chains were worn about the knees,
forcing the maidens to take very short steps so that they
might retain until marriage their "token of virginity". Bells
were worn as ornaments and their tinkling sound pro-
claimed that the wearer was in the market as a virgin. In
the East, bells were also hung around the necks of camels
for protection against the evil eye because their sound was
thought to frighten evil spirits away.
Moses may have had the symbolic aspect of pome-
granates and bells in mind when he commanded that a
row of them be woven around the hem of Aaron's robe in
blue, purple, and scarlet. The seedy pomegranate serves
as a symbol of fecundity in the myth of the goddess Nana,

day of the funeral, the Tjet was supposed to open all hidden
places and procure the favor of Isis and her son for the
soul's journey through the Underworld. Tjets were made
of red jasper, red glass, wood, porcelain, carnelian, agate,
red sandstone, gold or gilded stone.
The sistrum was another of the many objects identified
with Isis. It was a musical instrument which was used in
the temples connected with her worship and symbolized the
virgin uterus, the bars across the fenestrum indicating that
the door of life had not been opened.
The bricks upon which women couched in giving birth
were called, by Egyptians, the meshkent, meaning "life",
"birth" or "birthplace". The meshkent was personified by
the goddess Meshkenet who wore a conventionalized,
bicarnate uterus on her head, this being an ideograph
representing the cow goddess Neith. ·
Meshkenet succeeded the primitive frog-headed goddess
Heq or Heqet, a patron of gestation, who assisted in the
birth of kings and sometimes took the place of the ankh
as a symbol of life. Her frog head represented life in embryo
as the frog by the growth of its feet after birth, typified
strength from weakness; it was worn in the form of an
amulet for recovery from disease and for health and long
life.

As a symbol of the female creative principle, the dove
was identified with Ishtar, Semiramis, Astarte, Venus, and
Virgin Mary. A black dove was the symbol of the oracle
at Delphi. A Hindu myth says that Iswara, a form of Siva,
and his consort Parvati, transformed themselves into doves
and it was in this form. that they appeared immediately
after the Flood.3
Both doves and pigeons were highly reverenced by the
Jews and were the only birds which they deemed worthy
of sacrifice. With the beginning of Christianity the dove
was adopted by the new religion as a symbol of the Holy
Spirit. In some eastern languages, the word for dove is
synonymous with yoni, the matrix, and it has been imagined
by some writers that the sound of a cooing dove bears some
resemblance to a libidinous invitation in Hebrew.
In Egypt a hawk took the place of the dove as a symbol
of Isis and the same bird was used frequently to represent
the ka or Holy Spirit of Osiris. An ancient Egyptian painting
represents Osiris impregnating Isis, who broods or hovers
over him in the form of a hawk. Even though the great
god lies dead upon his bier, the presence of his spouse can
still arouse his creative faculties. Hindu sculptures of the
linga likewise frequently show a bird hovering over or
sitting near this symbol of male creative power.
· Doves were called flutterers or brooders, and when the
authors of the Bible wrote that the Holy Spirit hovered or
brooded over the face of the waters at creation (Gen. 1:2)
they seem to have concealed their thoughts in symbolic
language, the real significance of which could be understood
only by the initiated. Isis in the form of a hawk brooding
over Osiris and a dove, as the Sanctus Spiritus, brooding
over the waters on the day of creation seem to be but
different ways of expressing the same concept.
The Tjet is a female symbol which was as ubiquitous
in Egypt as the serpent and ankh cross. It is sometimes
erroneously called the buckle or girdle of Isis. It was not a
buckle, but a simplified representation of the vagina, uterus,
and connecting ligatures of Isis. It was carried in the belts
of self-creative gods and was supposed to bring to the
wearer, living or dead, the virtue, strength, and power of
the goddess. When placed on the neck of the dead on the

The oldest Hebrew symbols of the Spirit were the pair
of strange, hybrid, winged creatures called cherubim. After
the Exile they were succeeded by angels, which the Jews
borrowed from the Persians. Angels are now usually re-
ferred to as being of neuter gender but in the Old Testament
they are described as of male sex, this being one of the
few instances in which the active agent of the creator is
not represented as female.2
When the Bible says that Noah sent out a dove from
the ark at the time of what might be called the second
creation, it is in perfect conformity with the usage of sym-
bology. The Spirit is Ruach, spelled RKH, and when the
letter A is prefixed, it spells Arkh, the womb from which
all life originated.

Like the lotus, the conch shell or concha veneris is
especially venerated by the devotees of Vishnu as an emblem
of the female genitals. The conch and the crescent moon
were once commonly worn in Italy to assure fertility, but
within the past century the practice has been discouraged
by the church.
The conch is oval in form, has a conical or phallic top,
and is often represented as winged like the hat of Osiris.
The illustration on Plate 48 shows a concha held in the hand
of the creator god Siva with a finger pointing directly to
a diamond in the palm of his hand. The smaller figure shows
a concha in the hand of the Sakti of Siva, the goddess who
presides over the wombs of women as "the mother of all
mothers". This symbol is often found on religious garments
and church architecture.
It is believed that the sound of a conch shell can
frighten away demons. It is still used in India as a trumpet
in churches. Although both the gong and bell are also used,
the conch is the choice of the strictly orthodox and, at
certain solemn rites, it is indispensable. The Greek goddess
Aphrodite was born out of the sea and, in art, is frequently
represented as riding on a sea shell or scallop, another
female emblem.
One of the most unusual results of the ancient prac-
tice of attaching symbolic meanings to things was the
adoption of a bird as a symbol of both the Holy Spirit and
female creative power. The Holy Spirit was the activating
force and driving power which lifted the gods out of their
passive state and made them create. Because of this ability,
the spirit was considered to be of female character. As this
concept developed in India, the primary gods Brahma,
Vishnu, and Siva were thought to be accompanied by god-
desses who aroused their creative faculties and spurred
them into activity, for which reason their female consorts
were called Saktis, meaning "energy".
The Holy Spirit, however, was not confined to the
corporeal body of a god but was free to roam through the
air like a bird whenever and wherever it wished. It was
doubtless because of this similarity that pagan nations
generally chose a bird as a symbol of the Holy Spirit.

sistance from converts that they were forced to compromise
by permitting the fig leaf to be worn with a cross engraved
upon it.
Fico or fig is, in Europe, a very old, vulgar slang term
for the male organs. In cases of sudden or suspected
treachery or other danger, men, women and children of .Italy
and other Mediterranean countries make the sign of the fig
by closing the fist with the thumb protruding between the
first and second fingers. (Plate 32). Amulets representing
the hand thus clenched are made of gold, silver, ivory,
coral, crystal, or semi-precious stones. The gesture became,
in southern Europe, a kind of insult and Italians call it
"to make" or "do" the fig. In England during Queen Eliza-
beth's time, it was called "to give a fig" and writers of that
period called it "the fig of Spain". In America the expression
"I don't care a fig" is still used occasionally by persons who
probably have no idea of its original meaning.
Another gesture· of similar form and meaning is made
by extending the middle finger and closing the other fingers.
To show the hand in this form is considered a most con-
temptuous insult because it is understood to intimate that
the person so addressed is addicted to unnatural vices. Never-
theless, this sign is looked upon as a protection against

was transformed, under Babylonian influence, into a goddess
of childbirth and who, as the first mother, naturally became
the spouse of Adam, which in some Oriental languages
means phallus.
The lotus or lily rivaled the serpent as a symbol of
fecundity, immortality, and self-creation in Egypt, China,
India, Japan, and in Greece and Rome as well. It was par-
ticularly identified with the gods because it was both a
male and female symbol, the bud being male and the blos-
som female. The lotus seed has the unusual characteristic
of developing completely with roots within the seed pod.
It is therefore born alive, like an infant.
The capitals of the pillars Jachin and Boaz which stood
in front of Solomon's temple were decorated with lilies and
pomegranates, both being symbols of fertility. (I Kings
7:19, 20). Brahma is portrayed in India as springing from
a lotus flower, which, in turn, rises from the navel of
Vishnu. The lotus is also a special symbol of the self-
existent Buddha. In Egypt it was venerated as a symbol
of Isis, who was described as "the white virgin". In early
Christian centuries, the lily was a symbol of immortality.
The fleur de lys was used as an early Christian symbol
of the Trinity and, as the illustrations herein have already
shown, was originally a symbol of the male triad.
The almond (or luz) and the apricot were reverenced
as female symbols in Egypt. The fig was another ancient
and widespread sexual symbol. The fruit of the fig tree
was looked upon as a symbol of the virgin uterus, in contra-
distinction to the pomegranate which represented the gravid
uterus; the leaf was a male symbol because its three lobes
suggested the male triad.
The fig tree was considered more sacred when entwined
with the palm and the two were constantly planted together
around temples in the East. This custom still prevails in
India. When trees are thus embraced, Hindus say that
Kalpa is developed, for the fig is her female energy and the
embrace causes the revolution of time.
In India and China a tiny plate of gold, shaped like the
leaf of the Indian fig tree and representing the male genitals,
is tied to a woman's neck at her marriage. When Catholic
missionaries attempted to substitute the cross for the fig
leaf. in the 18th century, they met with such vigorous re-

Phoenicians honored as queen and mother goddess, a
deity named Hawwat who was associated with serpent
worship, and there are indications that other early Semitic
people worshiped the same figure under the name of Hawwa.
Babylonians associated Ishtar with serpent worship.
The sign used in writing her name seems to represent a
serpent coiling about a staff. Nintud, a form of Ishtar, is
represented as having scales like a serpent from her girdle
to the soles of her feet. Babylonians identified her with
the Greek Serpens, or Hydra, as goddess of birth. The
hissing sound of ts or tch is represented in Egyptian
hieroglyphics by the ideograph of a snake.
Nintud-Aruru was a Babylonian goddess who was asso-
ciated with Marduk in the creation of the first man. A
tablet says, "Aruru fashioned the seed of mankind with him
(Marduk)". Jewish records have Eve saying practically
the same thing, i.e., "I have gotten a man with Jehovah"
(Gen. 4:1). All of which points to the probability that Eve
is a survival of an ancient Semitic mother goddess who
186 SYMBOLS, SEX, AND THE STARS
of the Fall of Adam and Eve was probably borrowed from
Persian sources during the exile, and included in the holy
records.
When the compilers of the Bible adopted the story, it
was doubtless evident to them that Adam and Eve merely
exercised powers and desires which had been given them
at creation and which the creator intended that they would
be unable to resist. For that reason it would not appear
consistent or just, to say that when "Adam knew Eve"
(sexually) he and she were punished because the act itself
was sinful. Therefore, contrary to the candid, unequivocal
manner in which the Jewish record usually speaks of such
incidents, the transgression of Adam and Eve is described
in symbolic language which admits of different interpre-
tations and avoids stating directly that they committed a
sinful act.
The real nature of the offense is revealed in Gen. 3:22.
It was the partaking of the fruit "in the midst of the garden"
which gave Adam knowledge of his ability to create life,
thus making him "as one of us", that is, equal to the
creator. But for Jahveh's children to be endowed with
powers equal to his own could not be tolerated, therefore
it was necessary that Adam be degraded and made mortal
"lest he put forth his hand and take also the tree of life
and eat and live forever". St. Jerome, Clement Alexander,
and other early Christian fathers affirmed that the garden
in which the seed is planted is mother earth, that is, Eve,
and the serpent is sexual desire. The name of Aphrodite,
the Cyprian mother goddess, has the same meaning as the
Persian word paradesa or garden. The Hebrew word GN,
gan or garden appears to be closely related to the Greek
word gune, meaning woman, and in some ancient languages
it is used as a metaphor for woman.
The name Eve gives a further clue to the origin of this
myth. The word Eve (pronounced Hawwa in Hebrew),
when aspirated, is the same as the A~maic word Hawwe,
denoting a serpent. The word nagash, written n-g-sh with-
out vowels, also signifies a serpent in Hebrew and is pro-
nounced almost exactly the same as the word n-c-sh,
meaning sexual intercourse. The association of Hawwa,
the woman, with Hawwe, the serpent (the cause of her
"fall"), is, therefore, a play upon words, a practice which
was very popular with Oriental myth makers.

that he would have seed as "numerous as the stars of heaven
for multitude". Prophets and lawgivers alike consistently
represented Jahveh as promising abundant offspring, large
flocks and herds as blessings to those who worshiped none
but him. For a man or woman to be without a mate or
childless was the most tragic of misfortunes.
In the Avesta, the Persian scriptures, there are, how-
ever, numerous references to continence or "purity of life";
and in the Bundahesh, the scriptures of the Parsees, it is
related that Mashya and Mashyoi, the first man and woman,
were seduced by Ahriman in the form of a serpent or lizard,
and their descendants thereby became tainted with the
original sin.
Whether the Jews adopted the Adam and Eve story
from the Persians; whether the latter took it from the Jews,
or whether both adopted it from old Babylonian sources is
a debatable question. But, inasmuch as both the Persian
and Babylonian cosmogonies were much more highly de-
veloped than that of the Jews, there was very little for
the former to gain from the latter. On the other hand, it
is well known that the Jews derived many ideas from their
masters. Circumstances indicate, therefore, that the story

pents were often mummified and, in later times, they became
very popular motifs for jewelry designs, two of them usually
being represented together; one with the head of Serapis
and the other with the head of Isis. The serpent, crocodile,
and dragon were associated with Buto and Nekket, the
guardians of upper and lower Egypt.
Vishnu, the second member of the Trinity, in India, is
portrayed sleeping on the body of Ananta, the world-serpent.
Nagas, or snake gods, are an important feature of the Nayar
tribe and old paintings show women performing certain
phallic rites of an obscene nature with the snake god, which
indicate, unmistakably, that the serpent is a symbol of. the
phallus. A snake throne or kavu, abode of the snakes, is
an indispensable adjunct of some branches of the tribe.
On a vase of the Babylonian high priest Gudea, dating
from 2700 B.C., there is a design showing two snakes en-
twined on a rod in what is thought to be the mating
position. This is probably the origin of the caduceus which
is shown in early prints as two snakes entwined on a
T-cross surmounted by a solar disk which rests upon a
crescent moon, the snakes, T-cross, circle, and moon being
symbols of life. The caduceus is associated with Mercury
and Aesculapius, and is' a modern symbol of medicine and
health.
The serpent's identity with healing may be seen also
in the incident in which Moses, although a reputed hater
of images, idols and magic, nevertheless changed his staff
into a brazen serpent. An image of the brazen serpent,
called Nehushtan (II Kings 18:4) was kept in the holy
of holies and incense was burned before it until the temple
was cleansed during the reign of King Hezekiah which
proves that serpents were particularly sacred to the Jews
before the 7th century B.C.
Every nation had its legend of a Garden of Paradise,
a tree of life and a serpent. In Genesis, Chapters 1 and 2,
this legend has been confused by the manner in which two
conflicting accounts of creation have been patched together.
Iri the first version, a primitive, naturalistic one, man is
urged to "thrive and multiply" but, in the second, a rather
labored effort is made to connect procreation with shame
and evil. Elsewhere, the older parts of the Bible do not
contain a trace of evidence that intercourse between the
sexes was condemned. Abraham was promised by Jahveh

The uraeus (cobra) was placed on the foreheads or
crowns of Egyptian kings and was shown united with the
solar disk whenever it was desired to depict the life-giving
power of the sun. Representations of the cobra were painted
on royal standards and were carried in processions by the
priests of Ra. The cobra was also a special emblem of
Isis and Nephthys and, eventually, became identified with
all of the goddesses.
The serpent was identified with the flaming eye of the
god, hence "eye" and "asp" became synonymous and two
eyes, or serpents, were called "daughters of the sun". Ser-

According to Pliny and Aristotle, the animal not only resists
fire, but actually extinguishes it.
The serpent, particularly the cobra, is one of the oldest
and most widely used of all ithyphallic symbols. The ability
of this Oriental species of serpent to puff up its cape, to
raise its head erect and weave it from side to side caused
it to be associated with the phallus as a symbol of life, pro-
creation, and wisdom. Turtles have somewhat similar
characteristics, for which reason they, too, were identified
with life and procreation in Egypt, India, China, and
Babylonia.
As a symbol of continuity, .circularity, infinity, and
immortality, the serpent was frequently pictured with its
tail in its mouth, that is, without beginning or end. It was
believed to be self-created, self-existent and therefore,
hermaphroditic. Snake charms were popular amulets of
fecundity and procreation because of the animal's reputed
ability to renew its life.' This reputation is believed to have
been given the serpent because of its ability to slough off
its old skin and thereby regenerate itself. It was probably
due to these characteristics that the serpent was, at an
early period, associated with medicine, health, and healing
and became sacred to Hippocrates, the father of medicine,
as well as to Aesculapius, the healer and divine physician,
in whose honor snakes were kept in Greek temples and
fed by naked priestesses.
The Greeks portrayed Hygeia, Medusa, and Apollo with
serpents. Serpents encircled the body of Athene. Demeter
had as her attendant at Eleusis the snake Kychreus, who
was probably an ancient snake god. As goddess of the Phi-
galians, in Arcadia, Demeter had snakes twined in her hair
or encircling her body and her chariot was drawn by snakes.
Priestesses at the great oracle at Delphi were called
Pythonesses, or snake women, and Clement Alexandrinus
wrote that a snake was the consecrated symbol of the
Bacchic orgies. Snakes were kept in Apollo's shrine at
Epirus and fed by naked priestesses. They were said to
be descended from Pytho and were playthings of the god.
Zeus was identified with a snake as Zeus Ktesios, the
fertility god, and it was in the form of a serpent that he
violated Persephone. In a Roman myth, Bona Dea was
violated in similar manner by her father Faunus and, in
her ritual, a consecrated serpent was placed beside her image.

DRAGONS, TURTLES, SERPENTS, crocodiles, and salamanders
have occupied a paradoxical position in symbology and
constitute a class of the oldest and least understood of all
symbols. Because many species of reptiles make their
homes both in the water and in the earth, they were
everywhere associated with the female principle and the
dark forces of nature. They were, therefore, identified with
evil, destruction, and death as well as magic, sorcery, and
witchcraft.
In Spain and certain other Spanish-speaking countries,
the fear and superstition regarding them is so great that
the word "snake" is never spoken. When superstitious
natives wish to speak of this reptile, it is indicated by mak-
ing a wriggling motion with the hands. Yet, serpents were
anciently esteemed as guardians of graves, sanctuaries, and
households and were kept or represented there-by symbol.
They were considered to be the embodiment of wisdom, and
the water god Ea, of the ancient Sumerians, was commonly
called a "serpent god". They were also identified with
sacred groves and tree worship and ancient tablets and seal
cylinders which picture the tree of life almost invariably
show a serpent near, or coiled around, the tree.
In China, the dragon is a symbol of clouds, floods, rain,
and the gods of water. Clouds are called the breath of the
dragon and when it rains, the dragon is said to be in the sky.
The dragon is one of the four sacred animals of China and
represents royalty, power and sovereignty.1 The throne upon
which the emperor formerly sat was called the throne of
the dragon and a yellow dragon was embroidered on his robe.
There is an old tradition, of unknown origin, that the
salamander is able to endure fire. Benvenuto Cellini
described an incident of his childhood when his father
pointed out to him a salamander in the fireplace and re-
marked that such an instance had never been seen before.

dragon.

The Chinese also have a much simpler symbol called
the magic square which is likewise derived from the turtle
shell. The legend regarding it is that after Yu, the Chinese
Noah, had tamed the Flood by persuading the waters to
return to their 9 channels, he saw a turtle floating on the
surface of the river Lo.11 On its shell there was a square
composed of 9 smaller squares in .each of which a series
of dots formed magic arrangements of numbers. This was
the first map of the world, devised by the deities to divide
and allot the surface of the earth.' The central square,
number 5, was where the king resided and was, therefore,
the seat of power and authority.
The design which first appeared on the upper shell
of the primeval turtle now appears on modern turtles, the
luxurious passenger ships, where it is painted on the decks
· for shuffleboard players. It will be noted that the numbers
on the squares add to 15 in any direction. In past ages
many magic squares of this type were used by Orientals,
Gnostics, Cabalists, and other mystics as amulets and talis-
men, the key number in each case having a special mystic
significance.

According to Sir Austin Henry Layard, the Druses of
Lebanon, in their secret vespers, offer a true worship of
the sexual parts of the female and pay their devotions every
Friday night. Mohammedan husbands who failed to ful-
fill their conjugal duties on this day not only violated the
code of Mahomet; they risked a disruption of domestic
harmony as well. A Turkish canon proclaimed that "the
wife has only conclusive claim to her husband's caresses
from sunset on Thursday to the same hour on Friday
(Turkish Sabbath). If the husband complies with his family
duty, his irregularities at other times are not of material
consequence."D
The conventional design representing two fish in a
circle, called the Great Monad, is one of the oldest symbols
of the male and female principles and is found throughout
the Far East. In India and China, it is called the Yin and
Yang. In Japanese, the characters are called In and Yo
which, when reversed and joined, read Yo-ni. The sign of
the fishes, or Pisces, in the zodiac appears to have had the
same origin and significance as the Great Monad.
Yang, the positive principle, and Yin, the negative
principle, combine to form the Yih which stands for the ele-
ments of being. He who understands the Yih is capable of
expressing all combinations of existence.
Yang is lord-like, heavenly, masculine, light, strong,
active, rigid; Yin is feminine, dark, earthly, mild, pliable,
submissive, wife-like. Yang is the Great Sun; Yin is the
Great Moon. In Chinese characters, Chien (heaven) com-
bined with K'un (earth) means Universe. In numerals the
figure 6 represents the Yin and 9 signifies the Yang.

presented by a whole line ( ) signifying strength

conjugal intercourse immodestly and by the light of a candle,
with the result that children born of such intercourse are epi-
leptics, being possessed by the spirits of that "evil power" which

ecclesiastics that it has had to people throughout the Orient
for three or four thousand years.
The Virgin Mother, particularly, was often represented
as standing in a frame of this shape. Figure 2, Plate 50
was drawn from a subject on which the wording was
practically illegible, but it appears to have been a medal
of the sort worn by Christian pilgrims to the shrine of
the Virgin of Amadon and commonly described as "the
holy mother and child in the door of life".
The fish is a well-known religious symbol, sacred, orig-
inally, to Ishtar, Isis, Venus, the Japanese Kwan-non, and
other deities of the sexual nature. It was also frequently
associated with the sun. In the opinion of some writers, the
fish became a symbol of abundance because of its fecundity
and, also, because its mouth was thought to resemble the
opening of the uterus. It was a symbol of the Egyptian
goddess Hathor and was worn as an amulet to bring
domestic felicity, abundance, and general prosperity.
Inasmuch as every detail in ancient paintings and sculp-
tures had a definite meaning, there is more than a remote
possibility that the peculiar fish-shaped eyes which Egyptian
artists gave to their paintings of female figures originated
in the belief that fish were symbolic of the sexual nature.
Substance is given to this thought by the fact that in India,
Parvati, the mother of mothers, is sometimes described as
minakshi or fish-eyed in the sense that she is kimakshi, or
amorous looking.
In Scandinavia, the fish was a common symbol of Frija,
goddess of marriage, from whom is derived the name of the
sixth day of the week. In China, wood, metal and ceramic
representations of fish (usually the carp) are placed on
roofs of pagodas as talismen of fecundity and good fortune.
The Biblical Joshua is described as the son of Nun, a word
which, in Hebrew, signifies fish and woman, or rather the
sexual parts of woman.
The custom among Semitic peoples of eating fish on
Friday seems to. have been associated, in remote times, with
the belief that the eating of fish promoted lustfulness and
virility. Arabs, Jews, and other Semites considered Friday
to be woman's day, the day particularly dedicated to Ishtar,
Astarte, Mylitta, Beltis, Venus, Isis, and other goddesses
of fertility.

The forms pictured on Plate 48 are based on variations
of the oval and are intended to illustrate some of the many
ways in which this shape has been employed to symbolize
the argha, ark, ankh, or matrix of the universal mother
principle. In Egypt variations of the oval as an unfringed
phallic eye were painted on temple walls, doors, peristyles,
etc., as a symbol of the ever-virgin Isis. In various arrange-
ments, it is still painted on the foreheads of millions of
people in India as a caste mark. (Plate 48, Fig. 26).
The female generative organ is called, in India, by
the Sanscrit word yoni (pronounced yun or yn). The letters
i, j and y were once interchangeable as were also the letters
u and o, therefore yoni and the Hebrew words iune, mean-
ing dove (a female symbol), Jo-nah, and Jo-annes; the
Greek titles Io, Iona, and Ionia; and the Latin names Ju-no,

primitive root.8

with the rites of the savior Quetzalcoatl.
The pointed oval was used in Europe during the
Renaissance as a frame for paintings and stained glass
windows. One of the current popular encyclopedias de-
scribes its origin as having been due to the custom of artists
drawing halos or rays of light around the heads of Virgin
Mary, Christ and the Apostles. The halo was gradually
enlarged, it is said, until it enclosed the whole figure and

method of making it by drawing two overlapping circles as

elsewhere in Exodus show that the Jews possessed what
they believed to be the "Testimony" before Moses was given
the stone tablets. In Exodus 16:33, 34 it is stated that
Moses commanded Aaron to take a pot of manna and lay
it up before the Lord; "so Aaron laid it up before the
Eduth (Testimony) to be kept". This occurred before
Moses had his famous conference with the Lord; in fact,
before Moses had even arrived at Mount Sinai.
The text indicates plainly that the Testimony was an
idol representing Jahveh and as this Testimony was treas-
ured by the Israelites before the Sinai incident, it is evi-
dent that adoption of the Tablets of the Law marked the
overthrow of an old form of worship and the beginning
of a new one.
Mohammedans also recognize the Old Testament as part
of their holy records and the most holy object in their
Ka'aba,7 at Mecca, is a stone phallic image. From Rome to
Japan early nations possessed similar arks, chests, coffers,
or arghas for holy objects, which were usually symbols of
male and female pudenda. The ark of the Egyptians con-
tained what they believed to be the symbols of the true
creator, the phallus, the egg, and the serpent. The first
represented Osiris as the sun, the male generative principle
and active creator; the second, the preserver or passive
female principle; and the third, the destroyer or reproducer.
If the Jews adopted the idea of an ark from the Egyp-
tians, as the evidence seems to indicate, it was doubtless
for a similar purpose and contained similar objects. The
ark itself was a female symbol, therefore the Eduth or Tes-
timony must have been a male image, probably of unhewn
stone, representing Jahveh the increaser, the generator of
life. Probably the ark also contained a brazen serpent, the
ubiquitous Egyptian symbol of life and creative energy.
According to another Jewish tradition, there was no
evil until Eve's curiosity led her to partake of the tree of
life (or knowledge) and the consequent opening of her
womb brought forth all that is evil in the world. In Greek
mythology, curiosity also led to the opening of Pandora's
7-Compare Ka'aba with the Hebrew word kobah, meaning vulva.
Furst's Hebrew Dictionary translates kobah as anything hol-
low or arched like the Ka'aba which signifies the ark or vulva,
cup, kob, al-cova or alcove. The Greek for kobah means female
parts.

Sometimes Mahadeva is represented standing in the center
of the argha, like the mast of a boat. In India lingams
are to be found everywhere, varying in size from household
ornaments a few inches high to outdoor monuments several
feet in height. A large crescent-shaped boat, pointed at each
end and called the omphalos or umbilicus, was carried in
procession in the Greek religious services at Delphi.
In Hebrew, the letters P and B are interchangeable,
therefore Pith or Peth signifying womb, door, or entrance,
and Bith or Beth meaning house, are synonymous. The ark
of Noah was called The-bith or Tebah, and as Bith preceded
by the article the signifies sacred or consecrated, the word
The-bith denotes the consecrated ark or womb from which
all life came. To Egyptians the city of Thebes signified the
tebah, womb, ark, or navel of the universe.
The tabernacle of the Jews was designated the meshken,
or birthplace. The holy of holies contained the ark, the
holiest of all symbols. It was the place of salvation and
safety, the sacred receptacle of divine wisdom and power;
hence, the ark was the holy abiding place of the Tablets
of the Law which were given to Moses by the Lord.
In speaking of this incident, the Book of Exodus calls
the Tablets the "Testimony of Jahveh", and describes in
detail the construction of the ark which was built especially
for their safe keeping.
The circumstances surrounding the receipt of the "Tes-
timony" by Moses are quite mysterious. Statements made

Numerous modifications of this form are used in the caste
marks which Brahmans paint upon their foreheads. To
Hindus, the argha is a conventional representation of the
yoni or matrix, but, in a deeper sense, it represents the
universal female creative principle. The round object in the
center of the drawing of the argha (Plate 48) symbolizes
Mt. Meru,5 the Indian equivalent of Mt. Moriah and Mt.
Ararat, and among other allusions, it represents the Great
Mountain of Vishnu, the symbol of his generative power.
The story that pairs of all living creatures were aboard
Noah's ark appears to have been a symbolic way of express-
ing the belief that all life on earth came from the argha, the
womb of the universal mother.
Speaking symbolically, a boat is a cradle, nest, home,
haven, or womb; thus the crescent-shaped sacred boats of
the Egyptians were emblematic of the matrix. A ship with
a mast symbolized the union of the male and female. The
same relation is conveyed by the lingam, a Hindu emblem
which consists of a boat-shaped conventionalization of the
yoni, with the phallus standing upright in the center.6
5-"Meru is the sacred and primeval linga and the earth beneath
is the mysterious yoni, expanded and open like a lotus. The
convexity in the center is the Os Tineoe or navel of Vishnu and
they often represent the physiological mysteries of their reli~ion
by the emblem of the lotus; where the whole flower sigmfies
both the earth and the two principles of its fecundation: the
germ is both Meru and the linga: the petals and filaments are
the mountains which encircle Meru and are also the type of
the yoni: the four leaves of the calyx are the four vast regions
toward the cardinal points and the leaves of the plant are the
different islands in the ocean around Jambu and the whole floats
upon the waters like a boat.... It is their opinion, I do not
know on what authority, that at the time of the Flood the two
principles of generation assumed the shape of a boat, with its
mast, in order to preserve mankind". Captain Francis Wilford
in Asiatic Researches, the Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal, vol.
8, p. 273.
6--The Deluge allegory as described by Hindu Puranics: "Satyav-
. rata having completed the ark, the flood increasing, he made
it fast to the peak of Naubandha (on Mt. Meru, from Nau, a
ship and bandha, to make fast) with a cable of prodigious length.
During the flood Brahma, or the creative power, was as1eep at
the bottom of the abyss. The generative powers of nature, male
and female, were reduced to their simplest elements, the linga
and yoni, assumed the shape of the hull of a ship since typified
by the argha; whilst the Unga became the mast. In this manner
they were wafted over the deep. under the great protection of
Vishnu. When the waters had retired, the female power of
nature appeared immediately in the character of Capoteswari,
or the dove, and she was soon joined by her consort, .in the
shape of Capoteswara". Captain Francis Wilford in Asiatic
Researches, the Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal, vol. 6, p. 522.

Egyptians regarded the moon as the mother of all the world
and believed her to have both male and female natures.
Prophet Ezekiel complained because the women of Jerusa-
lem revealed themselves as moon worshipers by wearing
the saharon, an ornament made of gold or other metal in
the form of a crescent moon.
By transition a crescent becomes an arc or ark, which
term is cognate with the argha, a boat-shaped vessel used
in India as a ceremonial vessel. (Plate 48, Figs. 37 and 38).

the matrix of Bhavani.
The modern naman, or emblem, which Hindu followers
of Vishnu paint or draw upon their foreheads as a symbol
of creative power is a white U-shaped mark, in the center
of which is a vertical stroke in red. (See Plate 45, Figs.
5 and 6). Another symbol of similar character, and pos-
sibly of the same origin and significance, consists of a V
(v and u were formerly the same) roughly forming an
arrow head pointing up or down ( t -!, )• This was an
ancient method of representing the letters I and V which
formed a sacred monogram of JHVH. The letters IU were
joined with pitar (father), to form the name of the Roman
Iu-piter (Jupiter). Wide arrowheads are still stamped on
articles owned by kings as symbols of their sovereignty.
The crescent moon was once a common and widely dif-
fused feminine symbol, and to the present day, amulets in the
form of a crescent moon are regarded as especially appropri-
ate for virgins and pregnant women. They were popular
among many people of western Asia and signified to them the
strength and protection of the waxing moon. Moon amulets
were fastened on the necks of camels to protect them from
the evil eye. A Greek epithet for the moon was Cynthia,
from Cynthus (k and c being the same: likewise u and y)
and, as a goddess of fecundity, Cynthus was the same as
Kunti, the wife of the sun in India and Kun or Kiun
(queen) of the Jews.4
The two supreme Rajah families of Hindustan, the
Suryabans and Chandrabans, are called the children of the
sun and moon. When Indian poets wish to describe the
beauty of male children they compare them with the beauty
of the sun, while girls are compared with the moon; hence,
to say that a woman is "mah rui" or moon-faced is con-
sidered a high compliment. A moon face is also a mark of
beauty in Turkey, Persia, Arabia and Afghanistan.
The people of many early nations believed the moon was
the source of the moisture which makes possible all animal
and plant life, and there was a close relationship between
moon, earth, and water worships. According to Plutarch,

MoRE THAN ANY other people, Orientals have always liked
to speak in metaphors and parables, describing one thing
when referring to another. In the development of their
custom of viewing everything as male or female in char-
acter, bowls, cups, basins, baskets,. windows, arches, doors,
bells, bags, sacks, boxes, arks, boats, and hollow things of
all kinds became emblematic of the womb, even the palm
of the hand being considered female because of its hollow-
ness. Circles, rings, ovals, horseshoes and other objects
of like character symbolized the pudendum.
Poles, posts, pales, trees, pillars, columns, obelisks,
spires, towers, swords, spears, clubs, mountain peaks, and
other projections were considered masculine and, in India,
various kinds of stone, metals, and trees were classified as
male or female according to their characteristics. Some
objects, such as a pestle and mortar, .lock and key, or the
egg and dart design, combine both male and female symbols.
Objects are also classified according to their functions.
A hoe or plow, for instance, is male because it opens the
earth to receive the seed for planting and is called an
"opener". By similar reasoning, a furrow or cleft is desig-
nated female and the field or•meadow itself is of the same
sex. The Latin word vomer signified both plowshare and
phallus.
The signatures of some Indian princes contain ideo-
graphs of a plow to indicate that they are earthly represen-
tatives of the creator. At marriage ceremonies, a plow is
set up under a canopy as a harbinger of fertility.
In ancient drawings and bas reliefs, male figures were
often acompanied by female symbols and female :figures were
either given male symbols as hair ornaments or articles
of dress or such objects were placed near the figures as if
the scene were not complete unless both sexes were rep-

This star is so common today that it seems impossible
it could ever have been thought to possess magical proper-
ties, but in an age when people looked for symbolic mean-
ings in everything, it had many significant associations.
In astrology the five points represented the 5 planets Mercury,
Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. Mathematically, the five
points form ten angles of one-hundred eight degrees each
and there are five lines equal to the extreme ratio. It con-
tains ten lines equal to the mean ratio, and when the sides
of the center part are added to the mean ratio, they equal
the given line.
There were one hundred-eight days in four Babylonian
twenty-seven day months. Ten times one hundred eight
days equals one thousand and eighty, or three years in the
astrological calendar. In India one hundred eight is the
number of Brahma, the god of light, and is of great magical
significance. Brahmans consider the potential length of
human life to consist of twelve divisions of nine years each,
or a total of one hundred eight years. The ideal human
figure is divided by canon into one hundred eight parts and
the making of images and statues is a highly formalized
art. The length of two human lives (216 years) is the
number of metempsychosis or reincarnation. This is the
mystic six times six times six.

The number 108 has a mystical meaning to Buddhists as well
as Brahmans. At Gautama's birth the number of Brahmans

is a fair sum for a generous temple or other donation. In Tibet
and China 108 is a sacred or mystic number in connection with
architecture, ritual, and literature. (See Yule's Marco Polo,

Christians used a similar device as a symbol of the Holy
Spirit, and Jews sometimes·· placed the all-seeing eye in a
circle with three letter Jods representing JHV, one of the
mystic monograms of Jahveh.
Natives of Polynesia paint the mystic eye on the prows
of their boats for protection against bad luck. The Egyptian
triad of Osiris, Isis, and Horus was sometimes represented
by a triangle within a circle; Hindu worshipers of Sakti,
the female principle, mark their vases with a right angled
triangle, bi-sected with a line, and worshipers of Isis used
to mark the vessels necessary to her rites in the same
manner.
In its original form the Egyptian eye or udjat was
worn as an amulet as shown in Plate 42, Fig. 19. The
eye was supposed to be a very potent charm against bad
luck and the wearer of the udjat felt assured of good health,
protection, and general well-being. Twin udjats represented
the eyes of the sun and moon, that is, the two eyes of Her,
an ancient form of the goddess Hathor. It was painted on
coffins and mortuary articles. In the Babylonian creation
myth the hero, Marduk, carried between his lips an amulet
in the form of an eye when he set forth to battle with
Tiamat.
The badges distinguishing the three orders of Egyptian
priesthood were the Greek theta ( 9), signifying the sun,
the T signifying eternal life and the equilateral triangle
signifying pleasure.
The important feature of the celebrated ring with which
King Solomon was said to perform feats of magic was a
five-pointed star or Pentacle, formed by two over-lapping
triangles and sometimes called the "Seal of Solomon". When
placed right side up the star was a powerful amulet of
white magic but when inverted, it was a symbol of witch-
craft, black magic, sorcery, and an omen of bad luck.
To Pythagoreans and others, the Pentagram was a
symbol of the universe, or perfection. It has been found
on early Syrian pottery, on earthenware from Ur in Chaldea,
and is believed to be an older design than the hexagon or
Star of David. In India it is a symbol of Siva as well as
of the ten Avatars of Vishnu. Egyptians employed a five-
pointed star as a hieroglyphic for their gods.

Because of its similarity in shape to the honey comb,
the snowflake and other crystals, many. mystics see a tre-
mendous significance in the six-pointed star, deeming it
to be the form from which nature weaves her sacred
mysteries. As a symbol of creative nature the number six
is identUi,ed with the Mother Goddess and with the six days
or ages of creation which appear in the mythologies of
many nations.
The Hebrew letters for fire ~N (male) and C'Q for
water (female), when combined, form the word C'C~N
l
Aeshmim or Shamayin, meaning heaven, a word which Jews
often used as a substitute for the word Jahveh. The six-
pointed star of the Jews therefore represents fire and water,
male and female, as does the symbol of Vishnu and Siva.
The four lateral triangles yielded by the symbol are some-
times used cabalistically to represent the four consonants
comprising the Tetrogrammaton JHVH and read "with God".
Instead of pronouncing Jahveh's name the Jews often
referred to him as The Name, spelled ashm. Here the letters
C~N are equivalent cabalistically to air, fire, and water,
the three elemental substances anciently thought to compose
the universe.
Bisecting a three by four rectangle with a diagonal
line gives two triangles in the proportion of three, four, and

male; the base, female; and the hypotenuse, the child. It
appeared in conventional representations of the Eye of
Horus which were used in Egypt and elsewhere as charms
against the evil eye. An equilateral triangle was also used
as a symbol of the deity, its three sides representing his
three-fold power. To the Hindus an equilateral triangle

all existence.

in Masonry, is a symbol of the Royal Arch Degree. The
six-pointed star is also a symbol of fire-water or "burnt
water" and has been used by taverns to indicate a license
to sell alcoholic liquors.
When the apices of the two triangles are joined, there
is formed a double triangle, which was the symbol of the
gods Horus and Sut; also of north and south Egypt. The
double triangle with a serpent placed across the intersecting
bars is a Buddhist symbol denoting wisdom or sexual desire.
Figure 9, Plate 42, shows the use of the triangles in a Hindu
emblem called the Sri Iantra. The outer circle represents
the world; the large triangles represent the male and female.

In this system of Oriental imagery, the earth was con-
ceived as occupying the center of the universe, with the
sun, moon, and other planets spread around it in concentric
circles like the segments of an onion.
In Hindu symbology a point or • purm represents the
deity, self-existent; a circle represents Brahma and eternity.
A triangle within a circle is the emblem of the Trinity in
Unity: a circle inscribed within a triangle means the re-
verse. A sun disk within a crescent moon represents the
"conjunction of the divine power".
The Egyptian Aakhu device represented the disk of the
sun on the horizon and symbolized life after death and
resurrection. When worn as an amulet, it was supposed
to give the wearer the strength and power of Horus or Ra.
(Plate 42, Fig. 5).
Because of the great variety of forms and proportions
of the triangle, its repeated occurrence in natural forms, and
identity of its three sides with the sacred number of the
gods, it was widely used in amulets and emblems. Some
of its properties and applications will be considered in the
chapter on the Cabala.
An equilateral triangle with the apex pointing down-
ward approximately corresponds to the shape of the hirsute
fringe which adorns the mons veneris (Mount of Venus),
and is a symbol of water and the female principle. When
the apex is pointed upward it represents fire and the male
principle. The letter daleth of the Phoenician alphabet
and the Greek letter Delta (6.) are analogous forms and
signify the door of a tent or the outlet of a stream.

As ancient mathematicians and astronomers began to
master its principles, geometry was assumed to be a divine
science which would unfold the. forms and proportions the
Great Architect had emplofetl.ln.the creation of the universe
and certain geometrical fotms were accredited a mystic im-
portance wholly apart from ·their mathematical properties.
Consequently, many ·ancient: symbols were derived from
geometrical forms among,·,,ivhich the square, circle, and tri-
angle and their second~ ·f-0rµis1: .cube, sphere and pyramid
or cone were partictl!l~---· ff~er~nced as containing the key
to secrets of the colilst~cii_.<9n :.of the universe. These forms
served as the b.asis for iBanf of the most sacred symbols of
the early religious and secret orders.
Because of the great importance of the number five in
the mystic scheme in China, the forms were there expanded
from three to five to include the air and ether. Stupas con-
taining these .five basic or mystic forms may be found in
Buddhist monasteries and public places in China, Tibet, and

onian, and Thracian origin. It has been found on coins in
Gaza, Syracuse, Leucus, and Iberia, on Celtic funeral vases,
on jewels in the royal tombs of Nycenae, and in the mosaic
on the floor of the royal palace gardens at Athens.5 It ap-
pears on ornaments, probably as symbols of fertility, on
ancient figures of the mother goddesses Nana, Artemis, Hera,
Demeter, and Astarte.
Other examples have been discovered on the walls of
Roman catacombs, on coins, ceramics, pottery, and sculp-
tures from Greece, Lapland, Crete, Cyprus, Rhodes, and
other islands in the Mediterranean. Further examples have
been found in Germany, Scandinavia, Mexico, Yucatan,
Peru, Uruguay and on pottery and textiles of the Pueblo,
Dakota, and other Indian tribes in North America. Strangely
enough, this device does not appear to have been in general
use in Phoenicia, Egypt, or Babylonia, although examples
of the swastika have been found in those countries.
R. P. Greg, an authority on the swastika, thought it
was the emblem of the supreme Aryan god, Dyaus or Zeus,
and later of Indra, the rain god of India; of Thor or Donnar
among the early Scandinavians and Teutons; of Perrun or
Perkun among the Slavs. Dyaus, originally the "bright sky
god'', came more especially to mean the god of both sky
and air and the controller of rain, wind, and lightning as in
Jupiter Tonans and Jupiter Pluvius. Mr. Greg thought it
not improbable that the emblem itself, resembling two Z's
or zetas. placed crosswise, may have been the letter z of the
early Greek alphabet.
The illustration on Plate 40 leaves no doubt, however,
that from the beginning of history the swastika was a sym-
·bol of life or procreation. This reproduction was made from
a peculiar small leaden figure, probably of Artemis, on
which a crude swastika appears on the vulva. The idol was
found by Dr. Schliemann in the ruins of the ancient city
of Ilion (Troy). The extreme antiquity of the idol is at-
tested both by its very primitive workmanship and by the
fact that it was recovered from an excavation twenty-three
feet below ground level.6

of Fohat or Buddha. It appears on the images and statues
of Buddha and over the hearts of initiates as well as on
Buddhist inscriptions, coins, and manuscripts. The four
limbs of the Buddhist swastika illustrated terminate in
triangular feet. On each limb there is a female symbol:
in the center the male and female symbols are shown united.
The sun and moon in conjunction are represented at the
end of each limb and in the spaces between there are four
swirls representing fire, the sun, and creative energy.
The swastika is one of the mystic marks which may be
counted on the famous sculptures called Buddhapada or
footprints of Buddha. The Ramayana, the Hindu scriptures,
say there was a swastika on the prow of the sacred bark
or sun boat of Rama, the seventh incarnation of Vishnu.
It is also found on the sun chariot of the fire god, Agni.
Parsee jewelers and bankers in India sometimes place the
design on their safes as a talisman of good fortune. When
placed within a circle, the swastika is a sacred symbol of
the fire worshiping Jains, to whom it represents the four
grades of existence of souls in the material universe.
The triquetra is a three-legged figure closely related
to the swastika. It is a very ancient symbol and appears
on the official seals of the governments of Sicily and the Isle
of Man. The triquetra, or fylfot, sometimes represents a
three-headed rooster instead of a human figure, but it is
significant that the three-legged or three-footed one is always
male, the upright central limb representing man's "weapon",
the phallus. The word "foot" is a very ancient slang term
for the sexual parts of man. In both Egyptian and Sanscrit,
the heart, phallus, and euphemistic foot were emblems of
identical meaning. In the Jewish version of the Bible
Isaiah 7:20 reads "the hair of the feet" and in II Kings
18:27 and I Kings 14:10 the original text reads "the water
of his feet". In all of these instances "feet" is a euphemism
for genitals.
The three-legged cross is used in India by bankers, resi-
dents of Madras, various Punjab sects and by most all
Hindus during the licentious fete for Durga's consort. In
Japan, the ever-present three-legged Tomaye is one of the
most common ornaments.
In excavating the site of the ancient city of Troy, Dr.
Heinrich Schliemann found the swastika on a vast quantity

The swastika represents health and happiness and
Hindus believe that it has the power to scare away evil.
It is therefore branded on cattle, especially the village bull,
whence it has, perhaps, the significance of general fertilizer.
Swastikas are sketched in white or red over the doorways
and steps of city homes. In country villages, as soon as
the morning cleansing with earth and dung is completed,
the mistress of the house sketches the sacred emblem in
front of her house, garden gate, etc.
In China the sign may be seen everywhere; on medicine
wrappers and sweetmeats, on the stomachs or chests of
idols, on the flanks of animals, on bare walls and various
other places. To Buddhists of China, India, Tibet, Mongolia,
Korea, and Japan it symbolizes the "ten thousand truths"
150 SYMBOLS, SEX, .AND THE STARS
At the Council called In Trullo, held at Constantinople
in 692 A.D., this policy was finally reversed and thereafter
all crucifixes bore the figure of Jesus, although the lamb
continued to be shown, usually at the foot of the cross. At
first Jesus was represented fully ·robed, standing calmly
before the cross with o.utstretched arms; later he was placed
on the cross and finally, represented undraped, bleeding,
and tortured by pain from wounds, as he is represented on
crucifixes today.
During the Middle Ages waxen representations of a
lamb before the cross were believed to possess miraculous
power for prevention of hail-storms, tempests, high winds,
thunder-bolts, lightning, conflagrations, enchantments, and
pestilences, and thousands of them were purchased by the
faithful. In the reign of Pope· Urban th.is amulet, called
the Agnus Dei (Lamb of God); was blessed by the Pope
himself, and special rules and rites were provided for its
consecration. By a Papal bull of 1471 manufacture of the
amulet was monopolized by the Pope, to whom it furnished
a great source of revenue.4
The hooked cross, or swastika, has been used even more
universally than the tau. It is sometimes called the gam-
madian cross because it consists of four Greek letter gammas
radiating from a common center. From the Bronze Age
to the present this swirling symbol of motion has been
scratched, drawn, or molded on coins, tools, utensils, orna-
ments, weapons, and fabrics all over the world. As an
architectural motif in temples and palaces it appears
singly in meander bands, and in mosaic patterns on walls,
pediments, lintels, cornices, and floors.
The word swastika was thought by Max Muller to be
derived from the Sanscrit word su, meaning "well", and
asti, meaning "it is". When the limbs face toward the left
the device is called sauvastika, and is a female symbol. It
was conjectured by Count Goblet D'Alvielle that the sau-
vastika, being female, was an unlucky emblem. This theory
seems to be disproved by the· fact that on objects from
India and the ruins of ancient Mediterranean cities the
design faces either right or left, although examples in which
the limbs turn to the right are much more numerous.

Passover when the sun crossed the equator at the spring

Lambs were used in sacrificial rites of the Babylonians,
Egyptians, and Jews and a lamb was sacrificed in the rites
of Bacchus, the animal being represented before a cross
with sun rays or a solar disk encircling its head.
. In early Christian dogma, it was the blood of the Lamb
of God which took away the sins of the world. Long after
the beginning of Christianity, however, many people con-
tinued to believe that, instead of being accepted as a his-
torical fact, the crucifixion should be viewed in the old
pagan sense, that is, symbolically. While the church vigor-
ously proceeded to establish its doctrines and authority, it
preferred to avoid making the crucifixion a subject of wide-
spread controversy and, for almost seven centuries, it for-
bade the placing of Christ's figure on the cross. None of
the paintings in the Roman catacombs shows him on the
cross and, in the holy sepulchre, the savior is represented
by the figure of a lamb.
148 SYMBOLS, SEX, AND THE STARS
During the latter years of the pre-Christian period,
another cross was used in Egypt as a symbol of Harpocrates
or Chr Amon (Horus), the god of light. Horus was usually
portrayed with a curving lock of hair on the side of his head
representing, according to general opinion, a sign of youth.
This curved form was attached to the upright bar of a cross
and, eventually, developed into a loop. This form is some-
times called the handled or sword cross and also appeared in
India and Mexico.
A similar cross of Greek origin consisted of the Greek
letter P (the English R) joined with X (the Greek letter
Chi). It was called the Chi-Rho3 symbol and appeared on
Graeco-Bactrian cotns in the 2nd century B.C. and on
Herodian coins in the 1st century B.C. From the letters X
and P (Ch-R) came the word Xpric; or Chres meaning Lord,
then Chrestos, then Christ. Emperor Constantine placed
the J? sign on his labarum in 312 A.D., during the war with
Maxentius and the emblem was soon adopted by Christians
as a monogram of Christ.
As early as the 2nd century, Christians began making
the sign of the cross with the hands and Tertullian says:
"at each journey and progress; at each coming and going
out; at the putting on of the shoes; at the bath; at meals;
at the kindling of the lights; at bed times; at sitting down
at whatsoever occupation engages us, we mark the brow
with the sign of the cross." Illiterate monks employed the
cross as their signature and it remains today the legal mark
for those who cannot write.
The Latin cross was first used as a Christian symbol
in the 3rd or 4th century. It was not employed as a crucifix,
that is, it did not have the body of Jesus upon it, but was
accompanied by the figure of a lamb. In paintings and
sculptures, the lamb was shown upon or in front of the
cross, or was represented with one foot lifted as if· it were
holding or bearing the cross. In some cases, the lamb was
portrayed as bleeding from wounds in its side and feet.
Fburth century sculptures show a lamb performing miracles
such as raising Lazarus from the dead or multiplying the
loaves and fishes.
The association of the sun, cross, and lamb originated
in the ancient custom of celebrating the Crossification or

As a symbol of life and immortality, the ankh was
carried in the hands of deities, kings, and honored souls
who were quartered in the Hall of Judgment. Sometimes
it was shown being held to the nostrils of one ·on whom
it was desired to bestow the breath of immortality. or to
restore life to the dead.
Use of the ankh emblem spread from Egypt to Not:th
Africa, Sardinia, Phrygia, Palestine, Phoenicia, and Assyria,
and has been found in those countries on bas reliefs, tombs,
pottery,· jewelry, coins, and seals. The British Museum pos-
sesses a large stone figure from Easter Island on which
an ankh is carved in bas relief. Before the Latin cross be,.
came a Christian symbol, the Egyptian cross was often used
by Christians and was incorporated in the priests' pallium.

Another theory is that the cross was derived from the
ancient method of pressing one stick against another and
twirling it rapidly until the resulting friction created fire.
This method is still employed in making the sacred fire in
Hindu temples.
The high development of pictograph writing in Egypt
produced the greatest variety of forms and meanings of the
crossto be found anywhere. The principal form of the cross
in that country, called the ankh or key of life, consisted of
the T cross and an oval or loop representing the matrix.
When combined they signified eternal life and immortality.
Sometimes the ankh cross is called the crux ansata, or
handled cross.
In this case we have the rare opportunity of tracing
from ancient paintings and sculptures the evolution of a
symbol from its beginning to its final stage. First there is
a little known predecessor of Osiris called Taht, Tat, Dad
or Dud, a primitive god of fertility, procreation, and life, who
wears a peculiar headdress containing four cross bars, pos-
sibly representing the four quarters of the earth or the four
provinces of Egypt. In his hands he holds a whi) as a
symbol of authority and a crook or staff as a symbol of
magic, divination, and ruler of fate.
Figures 2 to 18, Plate 34 show the evolution of the
figure of Taht, first to an upright bar or pillar. A similar
bar with cross strokes was also a symbol of the meter used to
measure the waters of the Nile and was regarded with great
reverence by the Egyptians. Figure 31 is a peculiar one and
shows a Taht with the face of Osiris in it and above it there
is an ankh cross with two arms holding a solar disk.
With the development of the Osiris legend and his
worship as a god of fertility, this upright bar appears
to have represented the phallus of that deity, as a sym-
bol of his life-giving power, although Sir Ernest A. W.
Budge, a noted Egyptologist, surmises that it may have
represented the os sacrum or lower backbone of Osiris.
The upright and horizontal bars are again shown in
combination with the circle, oval, or loop, which forms were
employed with several different meanings, including the
sky, sun, mouth, the god Ra, and as a genetrix signifying
the universal mother principle. Occasionally a triangle is
substituted for the oval or circle and, in some instances,
the horizontal bar is shown as a scroll of fate.

it is said to be on the cross. Point is given to this theory
by the ancient method of crucifixion in which the con-
demned person was transfixed on a tree with the arms and
legs outspread in the form of a cross.2 This would suggest
a form similar to the cross of Jupiter Ammon. In fact, some
ancient cross devices show a solar disk placed at the
intersection of the bars, representing the sun on the cross.

More than 300 variations of this symbol have been found
throughout the world, many of them dating from the Stone
Age and it appears to have had different meanings at various
times and places.
Beside the Tor tau cross, also called the St. Anthony's,
Egyptian, or crux immissa ( T), the most common forms
are the Greek cross (+), called the crux commissa, St.
Andrew's cross (X), called the crux decussata; and the
Latin cross ( t ).
Greek, St. Andrew's and tau crosses, in plain form or
enclosed in circles, like the spokes of a wheel, were fre-
quently used in paintings, carvings, pottery, textiles and
sculptures of ancient Greece, Rome, Sicily, Phoenicia, Egypt,
Persia, China, Assyria, North and Central America, and
some of the islands of the Pacific.
In India, the wheel is an important emblem of the
chariot which the sun was believed to drive across the sky
each day. A disc with an equilateral cross in the center,
called a Chakra, is a weapon which the Hindu god Vishnu
hurled like a discus. It is related to the lotus flower, a
symbol of the solar matrix. Some wheel crosses have four
spokes, possibly indicating the four seasons or four points
of the compass, and others have twelve spokes, representing
the twelve months.
The Latin cross appears on many ancient designs from
Egypt and on seals representing Ishtar and the Phoenician
goddess Astarte. Pagan Greeks used the cross as a symbol
of Bacchus and Apollo and modified it to represent the
features of the life-giving goddesses Aphrodite, Harmonia,
and Artemis of Ephesus. It was commonly worn by temple
, prostitutes in India as a symbol of life-giving power.
The Hammer of Thor, the Scandinavian god of rain,
lightning and fertility was derived from the T cross. In
Freemasonry the Tor tau is used in the ritual of the Third
Degree and three T's in the form of a crown form the jewel
of the Royal Arch Degree. {See Plate 37, Fig. 14).
Appearance of the cross wherever sun and fertility
worship flourished has led some to believe that the inter-
secting bars of the cross originally symbolized the rays of
the sun which impregnated the earth with its life-giving
power. The cross has also been believed to represent the
solstice period when the sun crosses the equator, the day

resented Anu (fire, heat, light) and the left represented Ea
(water). With Beltis, the goddess representing the female
unit, they made up the Arba or Arba-il, the four great gods
of the quadrilateral, the perfect earth. This was in harmony
with an ancient belief, once widespread in the East, that
male offspring came from the right testiele and the right
side of the womb and that females came from the left.1
Widespread use of the cross as an early sexual symbol
does not justify the conclusion that it had no other meaning.
1-In the holy records of the Brahmans, Siva asserts that Brahma
was born from his right testicle and Vishnu came from the left.
Traces of similar beliefs have been found among primitive
tribes in modern times. A Hottentot woman will refuse to marry
a man unless one of his testicles has been removed. This is
done to prevent the birth of twins which is considered a bad
omen. A similar custom prevails among the natives of Ponape,
in the Caroline Islands and elsewhere, the operation usually
being performed when the males are 7 or 8 years old.
142 SYMBOLS, SEX, AND THE STARS
called by such terms as the "bull of god" or the "ram of
god". Female deities were designated by titles which alluded
to the moon and the beauties and functions of women.
Advantage was taken also of the tripliform character
of the male generative organs to effect a further refinement
in the primary symbols by arranging three things so th~t
one should stand between and above the other two. Some-
times a bar was placed across the end of an upright shaft,
thus forming a cross like a "tau" or T. In its Ethiopic form
the tau (T) is the exact prototype of the Christian cross and
some writers have asserted that the cross was derived from
the tau. Proselytes of Mithra were marked on the forehead
with the tau and at Eleusis, initiates were marked with
this sign before they were admitted to the Mysteries. Ac~
cording to the Vulgate translation of Ezekiel 9:4, the ancient
form of the Hebrew tav (T) was stamped on the foreheads
of the men of Judah who feared the Lord, and was the
sign which was drawn in blood on the doorposts of the
Israelites in Egypt. (Exod. 12:22).
To the primary two-fold symbols representing the
generation and production of life there was thus added a
third form signifying the three-fold character of the male.
This form, combined with the female unit, made a total
of four, which number symbolized the foundation of nature
and the root of all things.
The three-fold character of the male symbol becomes
much more significant when considered in connection with
the fact that all of the great creative deities of antiquity
were personifications of the genital powers and were always
arranged in groups of three. This appears to have been
the origin of the Trinity, three gods in one, one god is
three, which will be treated at length in a later chapter.
The principal gods of the Assyrian triad were Asshur,
(Assur, or Asher), Anu, and Ea. The name of Asher, the
supreme god, signifies in its various spellings "to be straight",
"upright", "the erect one", "fortunate", "happy", "to be
united in love". Similar words with equivalent meaning
are eshek, "a stone or testicle", "he presses or squeezes
into"; Jasher, "he is upright"; Jashar, "he is straight".
Asher, the central upright member of the trinity, was there-
fore identified with the three-fold sexual symbol. Sir Henry
Rawlinson stated that as well as he could determine from
his long study of Babylonian relics, the right testicle rep-

IN THE LANGUAGE of symbolism, everything in creation that
resembled the presumed creator, whether in name, char-
acter, function, or shape, was supposed to represent the
deity. As gods were inv;ariably anthropomorphic, it fol-
lowed that the creative powers of the gods were of the
same form and character as their human models.
Differences in physical structure which distinguished
the human male and female were employed to denote the
male and female gods. In their grosset forms these symbols
consisted of realistic representations of the generative
organs: in their most refined, esoteric, or abstract form,
they consisted of a mere circle or oval for the female and
an upright shaft or pillar for the male. (Plate 33).
These two basic forms were used, either separately
or in conjunction, and in an endless number of variations,
to signify not only male and female characteristics but to
represent as well the generation and production of life and
the gods who ruled over these functions.
In simple combination the pillar and circle appear
as 10 which may be read either as Io or the number ten
(10). Symbolically, ten is the number of perfection, com-
pleteness, and divinity; and for many ancient peoples it
symbolized the supreme deity. Both the number ten and
Jod, the tenth letter of the alphabet, were assigned to
Jahveh by the Jews.
Characteristics attributed to the gods were indicative of
their personality and functions: their titles contained allu-
sions to the sun as the source of creative energy and to
the masculine emblem. They were esteemed to be power-
ful, high, erect, firm, bright, happy, upright, large, noble,
hard, mighty, able. Generally they were associated with
animals which possessed similar characteristics, such as
the ram, goat, bull, ass, elephant, and lion which were
noted for their strength and lustfulness. Large, powerful
men resembled the prevailing conception of a god and were
called "men of god" and "god-men." Strong animals were

represented. In time the making of holy images and paint-
ings became reduced to a mechanical formula, with the
result that early Christian art degenerated into a stilted,
unimaginative formalism which was not overcome until art
was rejuvenated by the Renaissance.
In every country and period, grips and signs with the
hand and arm have been employed by secret societies,
religious bodies, trade guilds, thieves, prostitutes, and rob-
bers to pass information between members and associates.
In Oriental countries, pantomimic acting and dancing with
the hands, arms, and body have been developed into highly
complex systems, which are almost unknown in the west.
Stories and plays are enacted by poses and movements of
such great variety that a book could easily be devoted to
the language of the hand alone.

the Greek Orthodox Church a curtain is drawn across the

those outside the priesthood.
In early Christian religious art great attention was
given to the pose and arrangement of hands, heads, and
costumes of the saints, virgins, and other figures portrayed,
so that the statues or images would fully typify the persons

The sign of the vesica piscis is made by raising the first
two fingers and bending the third and fourth fingers over
so as to meet the thumb. Jewish priests make a similar
sign when pronouncing benediction, except that they raise
the three middle fingers. The significance of the mystic
poses of the hands of Jewish rabbis shown in Plate 32, Figs.
7, 8, 9, is best revealed by comparing them with the hands
of a Hindu dancer shown on the same page, and with
various symbols of the matrix.
Horns are indicated by holding the·first and little fingers
erect while the second and third fingers are closed in the
palm of the hand, with the thumb being thrust against the
first finger. When the thumb is bent so as to touch the
middle fingers lightly it makes a combined sign of the vesica
and horns.
The horn sign, originating in moon worship, became
a sign of divinity. Horns of the bull or cow, typifying
honor, power, and royal dignity, were placed over doors as
talismen of good luck. Ishtar, Cybele, Isis, Diana, and other
mother goddesses possessing moon characteristics were
usually portrayed with a crescent moon over their heads.
The Egyptian goddess Hathor, the world cow, was often
portrayed as having the head of a vulture surmounted by
a crescent or horned moon and a solar disk. Today, in
Italy and other countries, superstitious people make the
horn sign to avoid the evil eye. In Greek .art•. the cornu-

isted among the Romans and Celts. In accordance with a
law of Manu, a bride in the Vasavadatta ceremony must walk
three times around the domestic hearth, or she and the
groom may walk around the central pole in the marriage
shed, or a sacred building, tomb, or sacrifice.111
In all ages the hand has been the symbol of strength,
power, authority, and creative activity. The raised hand
may represent a warning or a sign of protection. During
the Middle Ages, the hand of God was often used in this
sense in Christian art. In India, the raised right hand is a
sign of Siva and is often found engraved on sacred stones,
village gateways, and sacred groves. Egyptians often used
the hand as a symbol of the creative power of the sun.
One account tells us that a colossal right hand of the mighty
god Anu was mounted on the summit of the Tower of Babel.
Hindus and early Mexicans impressed the. hand, covered
with blood or vermillion, on the doorposts of their temples,
that is, on the delphus or door of life.
A divine hand with the thumb and two forefingers
resting on a cruciform nimbus was an Egyptian symbol
of Isis. The first finger, which is the only one which can
stand alone, is the symbol of the creator, divine law, and
wisdom; the middle finger represents the Holy Spirit.
A side view of the hand with the thumb and forefinger
forming an 0 and the other :fingers raised, is a male sexual
symbol. It may also be read as 1 and O or 10, a Cabalistic
number for the creator.
One hand pointed upward and the other pointed down-
ward is a sign of heaven and earth, called in India the Sign
of the Witness. It is common in China as well as in all
other countries where Buddha is venerated.
Examples of the heaven and earth sign have been
found in Babylonia; in Greece they have been found on
articles connected with the Eleusinian Mysteries. During
the 14th, 15th, and 16th centuries this sign was much used
in Europe.
Hands crossed downward signify the cross of the equi-
nox, or St. Andrew's cross. In Christian art it represents
the burial and resurrection of Christ.

There is an old custom in the Scotch Highlands, of
"making the deazil", walking sunwise three times, around
a person to whom it is desired to wish good luck. Walking
around the person in the opposite direction, or "wither-
shins," brings bad luck.12 In the west of England it is said
that "if an invalid goes out for the first time after an illness
and makes a circuit, the circuit must be with the sun: if
against the sun, there will be a relapse. In Devonshire it is
believed that blackheads or pinsoles may be cured by creep-
ing from east to west on hands and knees or through a
bramble three times".13
In China, Tibet, and India the stupas or shrines have
raised platforms around them for circumambulation of pil-
grims. A similar custom prevails at the Ka'bah at Mecca
and the holy sepulchre at Jerusalem.
Almost universally, the right hand has represented
masculinity and good fortune; the left is associated with
femininity and bad luck. This is exemplified by our word
"sinister," which originaly meant left-handed, evil, unlucky,
and by the word "dextrous," meaning right-handed or lucky.
To Arabs and Abyssinians the right hand is "the hand of
honor", the right side is the side on which distinguished
guests are placed; the left hand is "the hand of dishonor",
for which reason the left hand is used to perform all acts
which are considered unclean. The Jews also preserve this
custom. In performing ceremonies in Jewish temples "every
turn must be made to the right of the way" (Yoma 15 B)
and left-handed persons are disqualified from becoming
rabbis.
Similar ideas prevail in India, where the worshipers
of Sakti are divided into two leading branches, the Daksi-
nacharis, or followers of the right hand, and the Vamacharis,
or followers of the left hand ritual. The Vamis adopt a
form of worship contrary to that which is usual, and they
worship Durga, the Sakti or divine energy of Siva, in all
her terrific forms.14
It is customary for a Brahman to pass persons or objects
so that the right hand is always kept toward them. Among
the Vasavadatta it is customary for the devotee to walk
around an object with the right hand toward it during the

being placed on the western side, which is dedicated to
the moon.
Among Babylonians and other Semites, the north was
associated with heaven, the overworld, the region presided
over by Anu, supreme god of the heavens. Jewish records
show that they regarded the north as the dwelling place
of the Lord,9 and animals sacrificed in the temples were
killed "on the side of the altar northward before the Lord".
(Lev. 1:11).
There is a slight contradiction to be noted here which
probably arose through the astrologiCal system, because
while the north, the region of Anu, is considered the over-
world, or heaven, it is also the region farthest removed
from the south, the region associated with the sun. The
north is therefore associated, in a sense, with hell, the region
of darkness.
The customs, which prevailed in many countries, of
performing dance movements clockwise, or sunwise, and of
passing wine and playing cards in the same direction, prob-
ably originated in primitive sun worship. It was customary,
in the Orient, for worshipers to face the sun during their
morning prayers, and this placed the left, or female, side of
the body toward the north. It was perhaps due to this associ-
ation of ideas that the entrance and meeting place for
women was on the north, or dark, side of the temple.
Ezekiel complained because the Jewish women gathered
there and sat mourning for the sun god Tammuz.10 There
also was located "the seat of the image of jealousy"11; and,
although the Bible makes the image somewhat of a mys-
tery, there can be but little doubt that it was a phallic
image, probably an ashera.
In medieval England the north doors of churches were
reserved for the passage of suicides, criminals, and con-
demned persons and the northern parts of cemeteries were
believed to be gathering places for evil spirits. In China the
side of an object on which the sun shines is considered
as male, and the sunless or dark side, as female. Accord-
ingly, the north sides of mountains, buildings, etc., are
designated as Yin, or female.

Many English churches are oriented so that the sun
shines through the window above the high altar and wor-
shipers face the sun. St. Paul's Cathedral and Westminster
Abbey in London, Notre Dame in Paris, St. Peter's in Rome,
and the Cathedral of Milan are oriented to the vernal
equinox.
"In regard to St. Paul's at Rome," says Lockyer, "we
read that so exactly due east and west was the Basilica
that on the vernal equinox the great doors of the porch of
the quadriporticos were thrown open at sunrise and also the
eastern doors of the church itself and, as the sun rose, its
rays passed through the outer doors, then through the inner
doors and penetrated straight through the nave, illuminating
the high altar."a
In the East, the dead were always buried facing toward
the rising sun. This practice also became widespread in
Europe. The orientation of churches in Christian countries
began within the first four centuries. Despite protests
against the custom in the Middle Ages, it continued; and
until recent times, all churches were more or less oriented,
particularly the Roman and English churches.
"In baptism, the catechumen was placed with his face
toward the west, then commanded to renounce Satan with
gestures of abhorrence, stretching out his hands against
him, or smiting them together and blowing or spitting
against him thrice. The ceremony and significance are
clearly set forth by Jerome: 'In the mysteries (meaning
baptism) we first renounce him who is in the west and
dies to us with our sin and so, turning to the east, we make
a covenant with the Sun of Righteousness, promising to be
his servants'."7
Orientation was never a law of ecclesiastical architec-
ture, yet it became dominant in early centuries. The author
of the Apostolic Constitution gives directions for building
churches toward the east and Vitruvius stated that churches
should be oriented toward the east.8
Orientation of lodges of the Freemasons is similarly
observed, the seat of the Master being placed on the side
toward the rising sun and the seat of the Senior Warden

between the thighs" of the house. The "holy of holies"
was the womb of the ancient temples.
Throughout the world, the east or sunrise point was
the prime direction and signified light, life, and birth. The
west and southwest were the land of the dead. Temples,
cathedrals and churches were oriented to the sunrise point
at the vernal equinox, to the sumer solstice, or to the sun-
rise point on the day sacred to the saint to whom the
church was dedicated. In China, however, the temple of
the sun at Pekin was oriented to the sun at the time of
the winter solstice. The great temple of Ishtar in Babylon
was built at the northeast corner of the wall surrounding
the city, at the point toward the rising sun at the vernal
equinox.
At the great Egyptian temple at Thebes, there was a
long avenue, lined on each side with statues of ram-headed
sphinxes. The avenue was so oriented that on the twenty-
first day of June, at the precise moment when the sun
reached its farthest point northward, its rays spread down
the long avenue, passed through the narrow temple entrance
and, for a brief moment, illuminated the sacred image in
the holy of holies. This symbolized the impregnation of
seed in the womb of the great earth mother by the sun.
The orientation of the temple of Isis is described by
an inscription which reads: "She (the star of Isis) shines
into her temple on New Year's day and she mingles her
light with that of her father Ra (the sun god)". The par-
ticular star of Isis was Sothis, or Sirius (the Dog star),
and it has been determined by calculation that a conjunction
of Sothis and the sun took place in 700 B.C. This was the
very date on which the great zodiac was constructed in the
temple of Osiris at Denderah, so, it was built as a memorial
to the conjunction of Isis and Osiris or Ra.4
The Jewish historian Josephus wrote that as early as
Solomon's day the temple at Jerusalem was oriented to the
east and at the vernal equinox, the rays of the sun passed
down ~n open passage to the holy of holies which the high
priest entered only once each year.5 It was open to the
east and closed to the west. There is evidence that the
entrance of sunlight on the morning of the spring equinox
farmed part of the ceremonies.

The sacred omphalos among the holy images in the
temple of Apollo was closely related to Python, the sacred
snake of Delphi and to the cosmic egg which various myths
describe as the original source of creation.
The omphalos was generally represented as a conical
stone resembling the shape of half an egg standing on a low
quadrangular base, but sometimes it took the form of a
whole egg merely flattened at the bottom to enable it
to stand on the pedestal. In this form, its appearance is
quite similar to the loop, or handle, of the Egyption ankh
cross, which, in its numerous forms, symbolized the female
principle.
Sometimes the omphalos appeared bare and at other
times it was draped with hanging fillets or covered with
cross-hatched lines represented either as plain ribands or
as tied tightly at regular intervals to resemble a string of
eggs.
In China the earth is visualized as square and the
heavens as round. In harmony with this conception, the
sacred temple of the moon (identified with heaven) is round.
This relation is also observed in the Chinese "cash" or coin,
which is a thin circular disk with a small, square hole in
the center. The union of circle and square, heaven and
earth, male and female, represented to the Chinese the divine
source of all things. It was probably for similar reasons
that the square and compass, the instruments employed to
make these forms, became symbols of Freemasonry.3 The
custom of tonsuring the heads of Roman Catholic priests was
derived from Egyptian priests, who shaved a circular spot
on the tops of their heads to represent the disk of the sun.
In countries where women are separated from men in
the household, the zenanas or female quarters are considered
the womb of the house, and certain ancient writings refer
to these quarters in terms which may be translated as "the
3-"0n account of the circle and square, the Sabbaths here referred
to come under the injunction of the word 'keep' used in the
second verse of the Ten Commandments (Deut., Ch. 5.). (The
circle and square were used by Cabalists to symbolize the three
highest Sephiroth in the Cabala). The Lord's sanctuary is situ-
ated in the center (of his palace) and which is most to be
averted is the penalty of penetrating into the place of the circle
and square, treading on the spot where the central point is
situated." Zohar, vol. 1, p. 23, Translated by Harry Sperling
and Maurice Simon.

These shrines remained throughout the monarchy until
Josiah broke them down.1
Early Chaldeans believed their "holy house of the gods"
stood in the exact center of the universe. Egyptians vis-
ualized the world in the form of a human figure in which
Egypt was the heart and Thebes was the center. For
Assyrians the center was Babylon, for Hindus it was· Mt.
Meru, and for the Greeks it was Delphi.
Before Mohammedans made Mecca their holy city, they
looked upon Jerusalem as the center of the universe. Prophet
Ezekiel declared Jerusalem was in the middle of the earth,
and it became a general belief among the Jews that· Mt.
Moriah, in Jerusalem, the site of Solomon's temple, was the
"navel" of the universe. St. Jerome accepted this view and
it became the orthodox position of medieval churchmen, who
quoted Ezekiel as their inspired authority. The round hill
of Mt. Tabor, which Christians called "the Mount of Trans-
figuration", is still called by Mohammedan fellaheen the
"umbilicus" of the great mother Terra.
The most important part of the Church of the Holy
Sepulchre in Jerusalem is the nave east of the rotunda. Here
the floor is not occupied except for a short column, probably
an ancient symbol representing the tree of life and marking
the center of the world.
According to an old Irish belief, the navel of the world
was on the boundaries of Meath where five provinces meet
and was called Uis-Neach, where tradition said the sacred
fire was lighted. The Arch Druids called it Midhe and the
spot was marked by a large stone called Cul-na-mireann, that
is, "stone of the parts".
The medieval practice of seeking Scriptural authority
for questions of geography was the source of a belief that
not only did the site of the cross on Calvary mark the geo-
graphical center of the earth, but that on this very spot had
stood the tree which bore the forbidden fruit in the Garden
of Eden.2 This belief prevailed until after Columbus demon-
strated that the world is round. In modern usage the "nave"
of a church is its hub, center, or navel.

altars and edifices. Artific'i~l mounds and pyramids were
similarly esteemed and their remains, in various sizes and
styles, are to be found in all parts of the world. In Sparta,
cakes shaped like breasts· were carried in wedding pro-
cessions by women who followed the bride and sang her
praise.
The mountain on which Apollo was born was called
Titthonia, meaning "the nipple". "When round towers were
situated upon eminences fashioned very round," said J. R.
Bryant, "they were, by the Ammonians, called Tith. They
were so denominated from their resemblance to a woman's
breasts and were particularly esteemed to Orus and Osiris,
the deities of light; hence the summit of Mount Parnassus
was named Tithorea from Tith-Or." The symbolic relation-
ship between rounded objects and the female principle was
probably the source of the ancient custom of placing a boss,
mount, or navel in the center of buns or sacred cakes, and
of building low, round domes on Oriental temples.
From omphe, om-pi, or am-be was derived the Greek
word omphalos or umbilicus, and the mountain where
oracles were delivered was called Har-Al-Ompi or merely
Olympos. The ompi at Delphi was called Omphi-El, or oracle
of the sun; while the moon was designated Olympias. At
the temple of Amon, in Libya, an emblem of the god, de-
scribed as an umbilicus of immense size, was borne in a boat
carried on the shoulders of 80 men.
The wife of Siva, the Hindu god of creation, is called
Parvati, and her ompi, boss, or navel is one of the particular
"jewels" to which her worshipers pay adoration. As the full-
breasted mother, "the lady of the mountain" or "the moun-
tainous one", she is the great omphalos of all creation, a
term which was also applied to Ishtar.
The temples of the Babylonians were bl,lilt on mounds of
earth or brick, sometimes raised many feet above the plain
and called "mountain of the world" or "mountain of the
gods".
In Palestine, from the days of Abraham, the sacred
altars were built on hills or "high places". During the reign
of King Solomon the co:untry was covered with statues and
phallic emblems and mounts, or high places, for Chemosh
(Babylonian sun god Shamash) and Moloch, the god of fire.

Many of the earliest languages did not have a neuter
gender and everything on earth or in the sky was designated
male or female, according to its imagined positive or negative
qualities. Every property, condition, or quality, such as
directions, metals, gestures, colors, shapes, forms, letters,
numerals, etc., acquired a definite significance in the all-
embracing scheme. In this universal two-fold system, natural
characteristics were classified somewhat as follows:
Male Female
Positive Negative
Sun Earth (or moon)
Life Death
Summer Winter
Good Evil
Odd Even
Fire Water
Heat Cold
Vertical Horizontal
Square Round
Angular Curving
Seen Unseen, and so forth
By association of ideas, wells, pools, lakes, valleys,
caves, caverns, clefts, and fissures in the earth were likened
to the matrix and esteemed as places of special veneration.
In these places the emblems of maturity were sacrificed to
Astarte. This seems to have been the custom referred to in
Isaiah 57:5, where mention is made of mothers "slaying
children under the clefts" of the rocks. Early Christians
denounced such places as cunno diaboli (Devil's Yonies),
Holes or fissures in the earth from which sounds, vapors
or gases escaped were esteemed as sacred oracles. The great
Greek oracle at Delphi was such a place, the name itself
being derived from delphus, meaning womb. When spelled
delphis, the word means dolphin. Aphrodite, the goddess of
love is associated with fecundity and birth and, as delphis, the
dolphin, is associated with delphus, the womb, or birth
place, Aphrodite is often represented as seated on a leaping
dolphin.
Round or dome-shaped rocks or mounts, hills and "high
places" were likened to the breasts of nature, or to the
navel of the earth, which connected the old with the new.
Such places were anciently the favorite locations for sacred

THE MYTHS WHICH WERE WOVEN about the sun gods and
mother goddesses were not only astronomical allegories por-
traying various aspects of the seasons and the fertile and
infertile periods in nature, but were also expressions of a
philosophy which envisioned the entire universe as a great
sexual system. From the observation that creation of life on
earth was dependent upon the union of male and female,
it was but a simple matter to think of the earth as the
mother goddess in whose womb seed was impregnated by
the light and heat of the sun, who, therefore, was thought
of as the great father of all existence.
All sun and moon cults were, in fact, fertility cults and
their principal gods were fertility gods. The difference be-
tween sun worship and sex worship was largely one of
emphasis.
Greek mythologists were conscious of the traditional
relation between heaven (or the sun) and earth when they
represented Ouranos and Gaia or Zeus and Demeter, as
husband and wife. Belief in this relation still persists in
the minds of Hindus, and annually, at spring time, when
the sal tree is in bloom, the Oraon people of Bengal celebrate
the marriage of the earth goddess Prthivi (meaning broad)
to Dyaus, the sky god.
In a treatise on agriculture, Columella, a Roman writer,
said: "it is the union of the universe with itself, or with
the mutual action of the two sexes; the great secrets of
nature, her sacred orgies, her mysteries, which have been
portrayed in the initiations with innumerable emblems.
From these are derived the ithyphallic feasts and the con-
secration of the phallus and cteis, or sexual organs, of man
and woman in the ancient sanctuaries."
Whereas myths allegorized nature in narrative form,
symbols served a similar purpose in a more graphic way.
Thus, the spring sun was portrayed in paintings and sculp-
ture as a lusty child, and the winter sun was represented
as a feeble old man with a fl.owing beard.

four signs, that is, Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, and Aquarius,
marked the four cardinal periods of the year.
In the Aries age, Capricorn was followed in January
by the sign of Aquarius. The principal festival now marking
this period is Epiphany, commemorating Christ's baptism
and assumption of the Holy Spirit. It is the essence of sym-
bolism that like qualities go together; therefore, when we
read that the baptism of Christ by John the Baptist, oc-
curred on January 6th, the event falls just where we should
expect to find it, in Aquarius, the Waterman.
January 6th was observed in Egypt as the day of
Nilos, when the water of the Nile was said to be at its
purest. Epiphanius wrote that this was the season when
water was withdrawn from the river and stored, not only
in Egypt but in many other countries. In some places
springs and rivers were said to turn into wine on this day.
From this tradition a myth developed to the effect that
Bacchus (Dionysius) turned water into wine at this very
time of the year; and, by one of those "coincidences" which
are to be found so frequently in the Scriptures, the turn-
ing of water into wine at the marriage in Cana was the
first miracle of Jesus.
Two centuries after Epiphanius, Chrysostom com-
manded that the water be blessed and drawn from the
rivers at the baptismal feast. In Catholic communities
priests still bestow blessings on rivers and other bodies of
water at this season of the year, the practice doubtless
being derived from the ancient Egyptian custom.

As the earth makes a complete revolution every twenty-
four hours, all of the twelve signs or constellations follow
each other through the sky with a new one rising over the
eastern horizon every two hours. And as the earth ad-
vances in its orbit around the sun, the sun appears to rise
in a different sign each month.
During the Aries age sunrise was in Cancer at the
summer solstice, in Libra at the autumn equinox ,and in
Capricorn at the winter solstice. Several hours before sun-
rise on December 25th, or about midnight, the sign of the
Virgin rose above the horizon. This was the hour of the
young god's birth.
The sacrificial lamb (Aries) was in the west at this
hour and sank below the horizon with the rising of the
Virgin in the east. High in the western sky, in the sign
of Taurus, stood Orion, the star of Horus. The three bright
stars in the Belt of Orion were the three magi or kings.
Directly across the sky from Orion is the Scorpion, which, a
myth says, followed him, as indeed it does, in the zodiac.
In Taurus is the constellation of Columba, the dove, symbol
of the Virgin and the Holy Ghost. At the feet of the Virgin

Within the sign of Taurus there is also a small group
of stars called the Stable (Aurega). This is the same Stable
of Augeas which Hercules mythically cleansed as his sixth
Labor and Justin Martyr proudly boasted that Christ was
born on the very day when the sun takes his birth in the
the Stable of Augeas in the sign of the Goat (Capricorn).
It also agrees with the tradition that the sun god was
born in a stable or cave (caves or niches carved in the
rocks being sometimes used as stables) .
Other figures to be seen in a map of the heavens are
Hercules and the Dragon which guarded the Garden of
Hesperides. Also to be seen are Castor and Pollux, heroes
in the myth of Jason's adventure in the ship Argo in search
of the Golden Fleece, as well as the Argonaut or ark.
In the sign of Scorpio is the small constellation of
Aquila, the eagle. This bird was identified with the Greek
god Zeus, the Hindu Vishnu, the Hebrew Jahveh and was
one of the four animals mentioned in Ezekiel's mystic vision.
The other animals are the bull (Taurus), lion (Leo) and
man (Aquarius). During the Taurus age the four bright

What the Stars Reveal
In most ancient calendars the year began at the time
of the vernal equinox, March 22nd. According to the cal-
culations of some astronomers, the sun rose in the sign
of Aries at this season of the year from about 2512 to 360
B.C.11 It was within this period that astrology, the zodiac,
and the sun god myths reached complete development,
though the first zodiacal signs were charted in the sky
much earlier.
11-The beginning and end of a zodiac age can only be approximated
because the constellations or signs are separated by imaginary
lines arbitrarily placed on maps by astronomers. Estimates of
various authorities for the beginning and end of a zodiac age
can easily vary as much as 200 or 300 years. According to
recommendations of the International Astronomical Union the
Aquarius age will begin in 2700 A.D.

time of Moses and probably originated as a solar festival
when the calendar was changed from lunar to solar time.
The Roman Church celebrates September 14th for St.
Michael, the conqueror of Hades. Later in the season comes
the observance of All Souls Day.
In Mithraic sculpture the waning of the sun's vitality
in winter is symbolized by a figure showing the reproduc-
tive organ of a bull (Taurus) being destroyed by a scorpion
(sign of Scorpio).
In Egypt there was an annual ceremony after the
autumn equinox called "the Nativity of the sun's walking
stick", the ceremony being derived from a supposition that
the sun, having now become weak and impotent, needed
a walking stick to lean upon.
After the autumn equinox,10 the dark powers steadily
increase their mastery over the sun until the final episode
on December 22nd when the cycle ends with the sun's
death and the birth of a new sun savior. (The death of
the old sun god at the winter solstice is typified in a most
unusual manner in the sixteenth century drawing repro-
duced on page 123. Here the axis and equator of the
earth form a cross on which is placed the Macrocosmic man,
pierced through the heart by a spear which strikes him
at an angle of 231h degrees, the exact angle of inclination
of the ecliptic on December 22nd and June 21st).
From the foregoing it will be seen that the dates on
which the sun reached the four critical points in its annual
journey were the most important dates in the ancient
astronomical and ·astrological systems, the dates on which
occurred the principal events in the myth of the sun god.
All of the important events of the Old Testament, such
as the laying of foundations, dedications of temples and
altars occurred on the same cardinal days. The most re-
markable events of the ·New Testament also occurred on
the same dates, for instance, the Annunciation and the
Assumption of the Virgin Mary, the Birth and the
Resurrection of Christ and the birth of John the Baptist.
10-In Egypt the death of the sun god Osiris was observed on the
17th day of the month Athor, which was at the time of the
autumn equinox, when the sun entered the six lower signs of
the zodiac. An ark was made in the shape of the crescent moon
and on the nineteenth of the same month, the priests pro-
claimed that Osiris was found, his resurrection being on the
third day of the moon.

and the tenth day of the month is observed as the Day of

(December) they celebrate the Feast of Hanukkah, which
Josephus mentions as a feast of lights. The feast was started
by Judas Maccabbeus, his brothers, and the older congre-
gation of Israel in the year 165 RC. to celebrate the re-
dedication of the altar in the temple to Jahveh after its
desecration by Antiochus Epiphanes It was usual either
to display eight lamps on the first night of the festival, and
to reduce the number on each successive night, or to begin
with one lamp the first night and increase the number
daily until the eighth night. By tradition, the twenty-fifth

it directly faces the rising sun on the day of the summer
solstice.
The turning point of the sun was observed by elaborate
ceremonies in Egypt, India, China, Greece, Mexico, and
Central America. In the eighth century Christian mission-
aries in Northern Europe complained that the natives cele-
brated the summer solstice by assembling on hill tops on
the eve of June 21st and at sunrise setting fire to large
straw-covered wheels, which they rolled down the hills to
symbolize the downward course of the sun at· this stage of
its annual cycle. Grimm mentions having observed this cus-
tom in Germany and Northern France in 1823. Today this
season is celebrated on June 23rd as St. John's day and
the custom of building St. John's fires has been continued
by the Roman Churc4 in some countries down to the present
time.9 The celebration of John the Baptist's birthday ex-
actly at the time when the days begin to grow shorter gives
pertinence to his prophetic remark: "He (Christ) must
increase but I must decrease".
June 21st was fixed by the Greeks for the celebration
of their Olympic feasts, the beginning of which was at-
tributed to Hercules, whose first labor was the slaying of a
lion, the zodiacal sign of Leo.
Autumn
On September 23rd the powers of Light and Darkness
are again on even terms (day and night being of equal
length) and the sun now begins its entry into the Under-
world. In Babylonian astrology this period marked the
entry of the sun into the six lower signs of the zodiac
and the six unlucky or unfruitful months. It was also
observed by important religious ceremonies as the time of
judgment, the period when men's deeds on earth were
weighed in the Balance and, on the zodiac, was symbolized
by a pair of scales. At this period Babylonians solemnly
celebrated the Festival of Lights with processions of the
citizens carrying torches to symbolically light the passage
of the dead through the Underworld.
The Jews celebrate the seventh month as a memorial

"the point beyond which no man can pass". It marks the
very peak of the sun god's virility, when he shines with
maximum brilliance and heat. The culminating point is
at the full moon which marks the day when the sun mates
with Ishtar, the Great Mother Goddess.
It also marks the beginning of the sun's decline, for,
having given freely of his energy to restore fertility to the
earth, his powers begin to wane, that is, the length of the
days soon begin to decrease. In Babylon both the marriage
and the decline of Tammuz7 were celebrated but a few
days apart. This was the significance of the statement of
Gilgamesh in which he accused Ishtar of being an en-
chanter, a poisoner and sapper of virility. For his death
the people of Babylon and other Chaldean cities were in
the habit of mourning and fasting for 40 days prior to the
great festival of Ishtar.
In all parts of the world may be found customs and
legends relating to the apparent rise and decline of the sun's
virility. Some legends relate that the sun is retarded by
being bound with ropes. The day on which the sun turns
in his course and begins to retreat toward the south has
also been marked by celebrations in which the participants
lighted and leaped over bonfires and in all ages, fire and fire
worship have been closely associated with the sun. In
France these fires were called the feux de joie: in England,
bon fires; in Germany, Johannsisfeuer (St. John's fire); in
Ireland they were called Baal tinne (time of Baal's fire).
This custom was observed from Iceland to Spain
and Greece in the south. The custom is widespread
among the Mohammedans of North Africa, particularly
in Morocco and Algeria. It is common, both to the
Berbers and to many of the Arabs and Arab-speaking
tribes despite the fact that such customs are strictly for-
bidden by the Mohammedan religion, and despite the fact
that the moon and not the sun is the central figure in that
religion.8

'
custom of killing the paschal lamb and celebrating the
Passover is said to commemorate the -Lord's passage over
the houses in Egypt when he slaughtered all of the
first-born children and animals of the Egyptians.5
There is little reason to doubt that, originally, the
celebration was an ancient solar festival. With the rise of
Christianity, the day and hour on which Jews were com-
manded to sacrifice the lamb came to be observed as the
day and hour on which Christ died on the cross, his
Resurrection being celebrated on the third day following.6
From the dawn of history, this was the time of the
most joyful season of the year. It was deemed the mating
and planting season and, in most calendars, it marked the
beginning of the new year. As the young sun, Tammuz,
rose on the first day of the week, Babylonians closed their
places of business and went to the temple of Bel Tammuz
for the purpose of offering solemn thanksgiving to the sun
god. In Phrygia, Gaul, and, apparently, in Rome, the death
of Attis was celebrated at the spring equinox and his re-birth
was celebrated on March 25th.
In the Holi festival, held in India at this season, Hindus
throw red powder on each other in imitation of the pollen
which fructifies flowers and plants. This festival is thought
to have been connected, originally, with worship of the
sun. In the Roman Church, March 25th is celebrated as
the Annunciation of the Virgin Mary, exactly nine months
before Christ's birth on December 25th.
Summer
On June 21st, the longest day of the year, the youthful
sun reaches the farthest point northward in the ecliptic. On
this day the sun rises earlier and sets later than on any
other day of the year. On June 21st, the earth's North Pole
is inclined 23112 degrees toward the sun, and on December
21st this position is reversed, the North Pole then being
inclined 23112 degrees away from the sun.
To the Babylonians the point of the summer solstice
represented the gate of Nibbu, the domain of the god Anu,

Spring
For weeks after the winter solstice, the puny, newborn
sun struggles against the powers of Darkness. Myths pre-
sent the youngster as growing up in obscurity or conceal-
ment. But as the weeks pass, the young sun god gathers
strength, rising higher and higher in the sky, his brightness
increasing rapidly until finally on March 21st, he emerges
victorious.
This is the day of the spring equinox, when the sun
crosses the equator. It is the turning point, the day of his
Passover or Crossification. Night and day are of equal
length all over the world on this date, the sun rising at
6:00 a.m. and setting at 6:00 p.m. Now begins a period
in which the hours of light exceed the hours of darkness,
symbolized as the sun's resurrection from the Underworld
(the lower signs of the zodiac) and with its regeneration,
life and vegetation can continue; the young sun redeems
the world from darkness.
During the Aries (lamb) age, Egyptians celebrated this
season by sacrificing a lamb. Three days later they cele-
brated the resurrection of the young sun god. The Jewish

led about with garlands around their necks; all who could
do so took purification baths in the sacred rivers and gen-
eral rejoicing prevailed.4 At the present time the sun enters
the sign of Capricorn about January 15th which is the time
of a festival in India marking the lengthening of the days.
Because the date of Christ's birth was unknown, it was
combined, until about the year 354, with a baptismal feast
which was celebrated January 6th in Rome on the date of
an old pagan festival. After that time his birth was gen-
erally observed on December 25th and the custom soon
spread to the eastern churches. But there was no officially
fixed date for celebration of the Nativity by the Roman
Church until about the year 530 A.D., when, at the request
of the Pope, the Scythian monk Dionysius Erigos, a poet
and astronomer fixed the date as December 25th.
During the period shortly before and after the birth of
Christ the dying god Dusares, "the only begotten of the
Lord" born of the virgin goddess Allat, was worshiped by
the Nabataeans in the Syrian cities of Petra, Bostra, and
Adraa. He was a god of fertility and was portrayed as a
deity of the vine similar to the Greek god Bacchus. His
birth was celebrated in December with games and festivities.
Allat was pictured with a cornucopia, which identified her
as the goddess of fate or fortune. Like Athena, she wore
on her head a mural crown with turreted walls, which
identified her as the protectress of cities.
A similar festival was held in Alexandria on December
25th in honor of a little known goddess called Kilkellia. In
this festival the image of an infant was taken from the
temple sanctuary and greeted with loud acclamations by
the worshipers who shouted "The Virgin has begotten".
In Alexandria the "Birth of the Aeon" was celebrated
by Gnostics on the nights of January 5th and 6th. At this
time priests of the cult met in the temple of the goddess
Kore who was probably associated with the Greek goddess
of the Underworld. A figure of the goddess resting on a
bier, seated and nude, with crosses marked on her brow,
hands, and knees, was brought up from an underground
shrine. After dancing, singing hymns, and carrying the
image seven times around the temple, it was returned to
its dwelling place below. Epiphanius, who described the

Allegory of the Seasons
As the sun appears to recede southward in autumn, the
days in the northern hemisphere become shorter and cooler,
vegetation withers, fertility of the earth ceases, the sun
stands lower in the sky, its warmth and brightness are
diminished. Allegorically speaking, the hours and powers
of Darkness are gradually winning over the powers of Light.
On December 22nd, in north temperate latitudes, there
are twice as many hours of darkness as there are of day-
light. For weeks the sun has been growing weaker and
weaker. Now is the culminating point, the shortest day of
the year. On this day the sun reaches his farthest point
southward. In Babylonian mythology this point represented
the gates of the underworld, presided over by Nergal, the
Prince of Darkness. In the Hercules myth, it represented
the arrival of the sun at the Pillars of Hercules, which
marked the end of his journey. As the sun sinks below the
horizon on this date, the forces of Darkness achieve their
victory.2
But the supremacy of Darkness is quickly challenged
because the virgin goddess (Virgo) gives birth to a new
sun which replaces the dead god on the following day, and
a new cycle begins.3 For about three days the length of
the day seems to remain unchanged, then· it gradually
lengthens.
The birth of the sun was personified in Egypt by Horus,
the god of light and savior of the world. On the inner walls
of the holy of holies in the temple of Luxor, the birth of
Horus is pictured in a series of four scenes which are
strikingly similar to Christian representations of the Annun-
ciation and Immaculate Conception of Mary and the Birth
and Adoration of Jesus. The temple was built by King

conjunction was denominated a marriage, adultery or incest:
having further said that it was buried because it sank below

it was considered to be dead, risen again, carried to heaven,
etc." Ruins of Empires, by C. F. Volney, p. 104.
S-According to the Alexandrian astronomer Sosigenes, who re-
vised the calendar for Julius Caesar in 46 B.C., the .winter
solstice took place on Wednesday night, December 25th at 1:30
a.m. It was reckoned the nativity of the sun because the day
then begins to lengthen.
DEATH AND RE-BIRTH OF THE SUN GOD 115
He was generally represented as being born in a cave
or cavern, h~s birth often taking place after a conception
of ten months; being born. of an undefiled virgin mother
of noble family, the birth being heralded by blazing stars
and signs in the sky. The infant was said to have been
taken by his parents to distant lands to escape from a
jealous tyrant who wished to slay him. He amazed his
elders by his precocity, grew up in obscurity, healed the
sick, and was crucified in the prime of life. His death was
marked by earthquakes, lightning and darkening of the
sky. He was resurrected in three days and brought light
and peace to the world.
Although all of these incidents are not to be found in
every solar myth, at least part of them are to be found in
the careers of solar heroes of every age and country. Long
before the Christian era they were employed in the stories
of Tammuz in Babylonia, Attis of Phrygia, Adonis in
Phoenicia, Osiris (Horus) in Egypt, Bacchus (Dionysius)
in India, Quetzalcoatl in Mexico, Apollo in Greece, Mithra
in Persia, Yu in China, and Cristna in India. Some of the
motifs, particularly that of virgin birth, may be traced in
the careers of Hercules, Prometheus, Aesculapius,· Zeus,
and in numerous obscure local sun gods of ·many places.1
The sun god legend gave rise to the belief that similar
miracles attended the births of all great characters, historical
as well as mythical, until, finally, many public men delib-
erately spread stories of their own virgin birth as evidence
of their greatness. Every man who was renowned for vir-
tuous living or for intellectual superiority was supposed to
have a portion of the divine mind or essence incorporated
or incarnated in him.
Legends developed that miraculous circumstances at-
tended the births of Plato, Pythagoras, Alexander, Augustus,
Zoroaster, King Sargon, Amenophis II, Buddha, Socrates,
Tamerlane, Pope Gregory, Queen Hathsheput, Scipio Afri-
canus, Caesar, Appollonius, and many others. Even Nero
seems to have made some effort to be credited with virgin
birth as a token of his greatness, and Emperor Constantine
did likewise. A king of Greece found it necessary to issue
a decree declaring the death penalty for young, unmarried
1-Virgin birth was also attributed to Hermes, Antiope, Auge,

THE SANCTIFICATION AND WORSHIP of stones was a mani-
festation of animism or spirit worship, sharing with tree and
serpent worship the distinction of being one of the most
general and ancient forms of worship. It was particularly
widespread among Semites, and the rock or stone (Tsur of
the Bible) was the real, old god of the Arabs, Jews and
Phoenicians. Later, when the old forms of worship were
superseded by sun worship, many of the old beliefs were
absorbed by the sun cults, and sacred serpents and stones·
became identified with the phallic aspect of the solar gods.
In Greece a stone was frequently set up along the
roadside in honor of Hermes or Mercury and as each
traveller passed he paid honor to the deity by adding a stone
to the heap or by anointing it. From these stone heaps, ,
called baety-li (Hebrew Bethel) there later developed the
sculptured boundary stones or "Hermes" of the Greeks and
Romans. From their identification as phallic symbols, the
word Hermes became synonymous with phallus. Even today
travellers in the East often come upon heaps of stones and
passersby walk quietly around them in order to avoid
disturbing the local spirit which is supposed to dwell there.
In the oldest books of the Bible, God is referred to as
a local spirit who sometimes dwells in rocks. It is related
that Joshua set up a stone as a witness to God (Josh. 24:26),
and set up twelve stones in a circle, or Gilgal, where the
Israelites crossed the Jordan. (Jash. 4:20).
On an occasion when Jacob dreamed that he heard the
. voice of the Lord, he decided, when he arose in the morning,
that the voice he had heard came from the stone which he
had used for a pillow. Thereupon, he anointed the stone
with oil and set it up as a bethel, or house of God, saying,
"Surely, the Lord is in this place: and I knew it not".1

Moses set up twelve stones for the twelve tribes of
Israel near the foot of his altar at Mount Sinai.2 When
Jacob and Laban made a covenant they set up a heap of
stones and a pillar of stones as a witness of the Lord.8
(Compare with pillar and circle or boat and mast). The
Biblical phrase "The God of Abraham and the God of Nahor,
the God of their fathers judge betwixt us"4 seems to indicate
that Jacob and Laban believed in different gods, therefore
they compromised by using the god of their fathers on whom
both could agree.
Even after the primitive belief in local gods had been
superseded by belief in one Supreme God, the old term
"Rock" remained in use as a title of God. When Christ
said of Peter, "Thou art a Rock" he employed an expression
which had been significant for over two thousand years.5
Conical stones which apparently served as idols have
been found at Golgi, in Cyprus. A white, upright, conical
stone was a symbol of Aphrodite at Paphos. Square stones
were used by the Greeks and Arabians as a symbol of Venus.
At Peiga, in Pamphylia a conical stone was the emblem of
Astarte. Diana of the Ephesians was represented by a stone.
In 204 B.C., during the war with Hannibal, the Romans took
from Pessinus to Rome a large black stone sacred to Cybele
and worshiped it with great ceremony.
Chemosh of the Moabites was worshiped in the form of
a black conical stone. To the Nabataean Arabs of Syria,· a
large stone was a symbol of the god Dusares and the great
mother Alla. Suidas, a Greek writer, says that Dusares was
worshiped in the form of a black stone four feet high which
stood on a gold base.
Square blocks of stone seem to have formed an inter-
mediate stage between rough, unhewn stones and realistic,
carved statues. In Greece, there was a square image of Zeus
Teleias. During the dominance of Greek religion a rec-
tangular cella constituted the central part of the Greek
temple. The temple was sometimes extended at front and.

The !ares and penates which Romans kept as household

by pillars, obelisks, columns, and similar forms. During the
time of Hosea, pillars were an important feature of religion,
and the prophet thought that ephods, pillars, and teraphim
(images) were essential to proper worship.6
Pillars representing the male and female principles were
to be found at temples throughout the East. They were
not incorporated in the structure but stood in front of the
entrance, the columns forming a symbolic gateway, or door
of life. There were two such pillars in front of the temple
of Hercules at Gades. A pair of pillars stood in front of the
oracle at Dodona and pillars flanked the approach to the
entrance of most temples in Egypt. Pillars typified life,
strength, and protection in the same manner as the linga
and yoni in India. The two pillars, Jachin and Boaz, which
stood before the temple of Solomon, had male and female
names ·and doubtless had the same significance as such
symbols elsewhere.
In addition to the pillars placed at the entrances of
temples, single pillars and towers, which are thought to be
of phallic origin, are still to be found in many parts of the
world. In Ireland there are many towers of this type.
Usually they were not erected on the tops of hills, as
would be expected if they were intended as watchtowers,
nor were they usable as fortresses. It is widely believed
therefore that they were merely phallic monuments. These

towers vary in height from fifty to one hundred fifty feet
and are from twelve to twenty feet in diameter at the base.
They are empty inside and most of them are divided into
from 3 to 8 lofts or stories by rests or projecting stones.7
Large stones which stood alone or at a distance from
any rocky formation seem to have excited the curiosity of
people in early times as they do even today, and in many
places they became meeting places where councils, festivals,
and religious rites were held. In time legends were created
about them and they often acquired a sacred or semi-sacred
significance.
Most stone monuments, however, were transported to
their final sites and erected for specific purposes, the most
common of the monuments being single, huge, upright or
slanting stone slabs called menhirs (long stones). In many
instances the menhirs were surrounded by ovals or circles
of stones, thus forming the familiar pillar and circle sym-
bols of the male and female. These are called dolmens (from
Breton dol, a table and Welsh men, a stone). Some of them
have peculiar mystic designs scratched or carved on them.
The greatest number of menhirs are found in France,
where there are between three and four thousand. Around
'I-Round Towers of Ireland, H. O'Brien, pp. 511-515.
204 SYMBOLS, SEX, AND THE S'l'ARS
such monuments, gatherings of various kinds were held
which featured singing, dancing, and kissing. In France and
neighboring countries, phallic virtues were attributed to
menhirs by popular superstition and maids desiring mar-
riage and wives desiring children rubbed themselves against
the rocks to insure fertility. Husbands sometimes took part
in the ceremony.
The most celebrated menhirs in the world are found in
the vicinity of Carnac in Brittany. They .consist of several
series, each of which is composed of from four to thirteen
rows or avenues of upright stones called "alignments". They
are thought to have originally formed one continuous ave-
nue nearly two miles in length. Single menhirs and dolmens
are also found in Morocco, Algeria, Spain, Portugal, Great
Britain, Holland, western Germany, Crimea, Arabia, Persia,
India, and other parts of Asia as well as in Australia
and Peru.
Today the word cromlech denotes merely a leaning
stone, but originally it signified a stone containing either
a natural or a man-made hole or aperture. It also denoted
a group of stones placed close to each other and enclosing
an area sufficiently small and narrow to be roofed over
by one or more capstones, thus forming a rude chamber.
This chamber was sometimes partly or wholly imbedded
in a mound of earth or stones presenting, to outward ap-
pearances, the form of a tumulus or cairn. In rare instances
cromlechs consisted of two single sta:r~ding stones support-
ing a third and forming a passageway or door of life so
that persons seeking purification could pass through and
be regenerated.
The Gaelic word klachan or clachan denotes either a
church, a stone, or a sacred meeting place. When villages
and churchyards were built around the sacred stones, they
too were called klachans. An Irish expression for going to
church also signifies "going to the stone" and in northern
Scotland the word klachan is still used for "house of God".
In 567 A.D., the Council Board of Tours (France) felt
obliged to issue .a decree against "the worship of upright
stones" and in the 5th and 7th centuries similar warnings
were issued from Canterbury.
In the British Isles there are ruins of more than two
hundred monuments formed by circles of stone, the best
known of them being the great monument of Stonehenge

on Salisbury Plain, which is believed by some authorities
to have been erected in the Stone Age, probably about
2000 or 1800 B.C. Stonehenge originally consisted of an
outer circle three hundred feet in diameter and an inner
circle one hundred six feet in diameter, inside of which
there was another series of smaller stones in the form of
a horseshoe. Inside this there was a second, smaller horse-
shoe, near the central curve of which there was a large altar
stone fifteen feet high.
206 SYMBOLS, SEX, AND THE STARS
In the east side of the outer circle two stones formed
an entrance leading to the great stone altar. Outside the
larger circle there was a circular furrow, ditch or rampart
which was intentionally broken at the point where it inter-
sected the east-west axis of the monument. At this point
stood a large stone called a sacrificial stone, but which
some authorities have called a pointer, or linga.
It has been conjectured that Stonehenge was built by
the Druids as a temple of the sun, the entrance stone and
altar being so placed that on June 21st the first rays of the
rising sun shine upon the huge pointer, then pass directly
through the entrance and strike the great stone altar.
Another great monument at Abury consists of a central
circle enclosed by a great circle of stones which is ap-
proached by two long serpentine rows of upright monoliths
forming an avenue over half a mile in length.
Even more than large quaint rock formations, natural
cavities and fissures in the earth have always been peculiarly
fascinating for superstitious people and have been regarded
with a mixture of fear and wonderment. Ancient beliefs
regarding the significance of caves, caverns, and clefts led
to the custom, which still persists in certain parts of the
world, of passing children (and adults as well) through
openings and crevices as an act of purification and re-birth
from the womb of Mother Nature.
When the rulers of Travancore, in southern India,
ascend the throne they are transformed from the Nayar
caste into Brahmans by passing through a golden cow or
lotus flower, which then becomes the property of the
Brahman priest.8
On the island of Bombay there is said to be a rock con-
taining a natural cavity, with an upper and lower entrance,
which is used by the Gentvas as a means of purification.
This, they say, is effected by going in at the lower opening
and emerging from the upper opening.
8-For the purpose of regeneration, it is directed to make an
image of pure gold of the female power of nature in the shape
either of a womb or a cow. In this statue the person to be
regenerated is enclosed and dragged out through the usual
channel. As a statue of pure gold and of proper dimensions
would be too expensive, it is sufficient to make an image of
the sacred yoni through which the person to be regenerated is
to pass." Captain Francis Wilford, Asiatic Researches, Royal
Asiatic Society of Bengal, vol. 6, p. 535.

In Nepal, India, small perforated stones, generally
about the size of an orange, and called salagrama, are re-
garded as sacred to Vishnu. By a very peculiar coincidence,
similar stones called salagrana, are wrapped in red woollen
and carried in the pockets of persons in Tuscany, Italy,
who practice sorcery.
Old adoption ceremonies still survive in some parts of
the world in which the adopted person is symbolically
re-born. Among the Berawas of Sarawak, when a woman
wishes to adopt a child or adult, a feast is arranged and the
adopting mother is seated on a raised and covered seat. Then
the adopted person crawls from behind and between her
legs, thus imitating childbirth. Among the early Jews a
childless woman became a foster mother by merely having
a real mother sit upon her knees during birth of the child.9
In ancient Greece any man who had been erroneously
supposed to be dead and for whom funeral rites had been
held during his absence, was treated as dead to society until
he had gone through the form of being born again. Dio-
dorus wrote that when Zeus persuaded his wife Hera to
9-And Rachel said, Behold my maid Billah1 go in unto her and
she shall bear upon my knees that I also nave children by her.
Gen. 30:3.
208 SYMBOLS, SEX, AND THE STARS
adopt Hercules, the goddess got into bed and, clasping the
hero to her bosom, pushed him through her robes and let
him fall to the ground in imitation of real birth. In Dio-
dorus's day the same mode of adopting children was prac-
ticed by the Barbarians and is still used by Bulgarians and
Bosnian Turks. A woman will take a boy whom she intends
to adopt and push or roll him through her clothes. Ever
afterward he is regarded as her son.10
In passing to the underground chamber where the
sacred rites of the Mithraic Mysteries were conducted, it
was necessary for the initiates to pass through a narrow
entrance leading to the cave or underground chamber, as if
entering a womb. Above the chamber a bull was sacrificed
and its blood flowed down through a wooden grating on
to the initiate. This was the Tauribolium ceremony in
which the initiate was purified and reborn in the blood of
the bull.
Purification, regeneration, and re-birth are certain to
have been important features of the Mysteries in Egypt,
where the initiates appear to have been placed in a "cradle
of skin", or symbolic womb, from which they emerged,
simulating the process of gestation and being thereby re-
created and purified. The rite was probably in imitation of
a myth which alleged that the sun god Ra was born in the
form of a calf from the cow Nut or Neith, the mother god-
dess of heaven, the initiate thus becoming identified with the
sun god. Both Plutarch and Apuleius state that in the
procession of Isis a wooden image of a cow was borne upon
the shoulders of the priests. It was probably an image of
Nut, the divine cow mother of the gods, from whose womb
the initiates were symbolically re-born.
The Mystery of Osiris and Isis was generally considered
the most ancient of Mysteries, being already in existence
at the beginning of recorded history. Those who were ad-
mitted to the Lesser Mystery were denominated mystae or
veiled while those who were initiated into the Greater
Mystery were epoptai or seers.11
10-Golden Bough, Abdg. E., Sir James Frazer, pp. 14, 15.
11-In Egypt, in order to represent gestation and re-birth, either
a statue or mummy was placed inside the hide of a sacrificial
animal, or inside a wooden cow, and a priest would let himself
within the hide on the night of the funeral as a substitute for
the dead man. Next morning the priest was considered to issue
from the skin as from a womb. Kings & Gods of Egypt, Alex.
Moret, p. 186.

The ancient rite of purification, death, and resurrection
has been continued as an initiation rite in certain religious
orders down to modern times. After passing through several
preliminary grades, novice monks and nurs, clad in white,
are placed in coffins in front of the altar while the mass is
sung. This is when the novices become "professed".
Owing to their secret nature, very little information has
come down to us regarding the rites of the Mysteries which
for many centuries before the Christian era were practiced
by natives of Eleusis, Samothrace, Bilbos, and other places
along the eastern shores of the Mediterranean. From what
is known of their beliefs, however, it is safe to conclude
that the rites included a symbolic dramatization of the pro-
cesses of nature; conception, birth, growth, death, and
resurrection.
The Eleusinian Mysteries, which took place in the
Greek village of Eleusis, were probably the most elaborate.
They covered a period of eight days and were divided into
the Lesser and Greater Mysteries, with the final act taking
place in the temple of Demeter. The annual periods of plant
growth and death were probably symbolized by a dramatiza-
tion of the abduction of Persephone by Pluto and the efforts
of her mother which resulted in Persephone being restored
to the earth for half of each year.

DETERMINATION OF THE symbolical meaning of trees is
complicated by the fact that in various periods and places
they have been features of spiritism and totemism as well
as phallicism. As a phase of primitive spirit worship they
were placed in consecrated ground near altars and "high
places" as representatives of the deity and as his dwelling
place. This seems to have been the belief of Abraham when
he sought God in the oaks and tamarisks of Mamre and
when he planted a tree at Beersheba "and call(ed) thereon
the name of the Lord, the everlasting God". (Gen. 21:23).
It was an expression of totemism that made oak trees
sacred to Jupiter and Zeus and caused the Druids to hold
the oak and yew sacred and use hollow oaks for burial of
the dead.
Early Spartans laid the dead upon olive leaves and
palm branches. The male palm tree was a necessary accom-
paniment of all phallic and solar festivals and was used
prominently in temple decoration. It is found repeatedly
on ancient coins and tablets, always with seven branches.
In Egypt a palm branch was an emblem of Taht, the scribe
of the gods. The branches were carried in religious pro-
cessions as symbols of self-creation, time, and perpetuity
because they were said to add one new frond with each
change of the moon. In the Book of Revelation palms seem
to possess the same significance.
Because it retained its verdure throughout the year, the
pine tree was an emblem of immortality and was often
represented on Assyrian monuments and Etruscan funeral
urns. The pine cone was a symbol of Venus and Astarte.
During the Thesmophoria festival in Greece, images of
phalli and snakes were made of dough and, together with
pine cones, were dedicated to the goddess as emblems of
fertility. Pine cones may still be seen on gateways in Italy
where they are regarded as emblems of fecundity, good
210
SEX SYMBOLISM 211
health, and good fortune. In the Phoenician myth of the
sun god Attis, it was under a pine tree that the hero died
and was re-born the following spring.
To Chaldeans, the cedar represented not only the tree
of life but the "revealer of the oracles of earth and heaven"
as well. The name of Ea, god of wisdom, was supposed to
be written on its core and Nin-gish-zida was "master of the
Tree of Life".
The laurel or bay was the victor's crown, the wreath
of Mars and of those to whom their fellows wished to pay
honor. It was sacred to Apollo. The first temple ·at the
oracle of Delphi was built of laurel. The chewing of bay
leaves was thought to give one the ability to make prophecies.
Holly trees are both male and female, the prickly species
being male, the non-prickly being female and there is an
old superstition to the effect that whichever kind of holly
enters a house at Christmas time determines whether the
husband or wife shall dominate in the coming year. Accord-
ing to another tradition, the maiden who wishes to see her
future husband should pin the holly on her night dress
over her heart and go to sleep with three pails of water in
her room. If further prophecy is desired, leaves of the
female holly must, on the night of Venus' day (Friday)
be tied in a handkerchief and slept upon in perfect silence
until Saturn's morn.
Within the past century a custom prevailed in Europe
of cutting hawthorne and elm twigs and wearing them
during the month of May. Together, they were called May
and persons who did not wear them during this month
risked being thoroughly ducked in water. Because of the
great social changes which have taken place in modern
times, many old customs of this kind have practically van-
ished, except in more or less isolated communities. In out-
lying districts of the British Isles, for instance, there is a
very old belief that the rowan, or mountain ash, is a pro-
tection against evil; and it has been the custom to place
a staff of ash over door posts to ward off malign influences.
Scotch shepherds drive their flocks to the hills with
ash staffs and on Beltane, or May Day, sheep and lambs
are passed through hoops of ash. Ash trees are always
planted near holy places such as churchyards and stone
212 SYMBOLS, SEX, AND THE STARS
circles or klachans. Pious persons are in the habit of wear-
ing crosses of ash on a certain day of the year. A fertility
god formerly worshiped in northern Europe was called
Yggdrasil, meaning ash tree.
In Suffolk, England, it is a custom to split a young
ash tree lengthwise and pass a naked child through it
three times head first (but some say feet first) to cure
rickets and rupture. The child is then turned around and,
as the Celts say, passed deaselwise, that is, with the sun,
after which the cleft in the tree is bound up. If the tree
heals, all is supposed to go well with the child.
The tree should be split about five feet as nearly as
possible from east to west, and just as the sun is rising
in the early spring before vegetation begins. In Suffolk
the operation is called "drawing". In Cornwall, passing
through the cleft of a tree has the same significance as
passing through an aperture in a rock, or "threading the
needle", as it is called. In Killarney, the operation is said
to be of a fertilizing nature and brings "a saving of pain
to women in a certain way".
In Oxford, an old custom of like meaning is practiced
with "groaning cheese", a piece of which, cut in circular
or oval form, must be kept ready at birth to pass the new-
born babe through. Afterward, the cheese is cut like a
wedding cake and given to girls to sleep upon to "excite
pleasant and expressive dreams".
In Scandinavia the hazel tree was formerly sacred to
Thor and in Bohemia hazel groves were favorite spots for
temples. In Bavaria, batons of office were always made
of hazel wood and divining rods were made of hazel. Bo-
hemians believed that wherever there were nuts, there
were wasps and women were fruitful; also, that wherever
nuts were found, illegitimate children abounded. Should
a snake bite a hazel rod, the rod was believed to turn at
once into a bluish stone, which if thrown into water, would
cure an animal of snake bite.
Pliny observed that the Romans hung colored rags
and other offerings on sacred trees. Travelers in the East
have mentioned the same custom in modern times. In India,
according to Fergusson,1 rags in the form of yoni-like loops
1-Tree and Serpent Worship, James Fergusson, 1868.
SEX SYMBOLISM 218
are hung from budding twigs and branches, the branch
and loop symbolizing the union of the male and female
creative powers. (See Plate 48, fig. 20).
The rite of tree marriage still survives in India as a
conventional symbol of totemism. Sacred trees are circum-
ambulated by Nayar women desiring children, and by men
who wish to avoid the evil influence of Saturn, under which
they are supposed to suffer during some part of their lives.
Phallic poles may still be found near temples and in
villages in the Orient, adorned like our Maypoles with
brightly colored banners or streamers. Sometimes the figure
of a rooster, an emblem of the sun and fecundity, or some
other phallic figure is placed at the top of the pole.
The custom of children dancing around a Maypole is
derived from the ancient custom of dancing around a tree,
tree trunk, or pole, in springtime, in token of the annual
resurgence of the generative powers of nature.
England was once noted for its Maypoles. In writing
about the general let-down of morals which marked the
May time celebrations, Philip Stubbes, a Puritan writer of
Queen Elizabeth's time, made it clear why May was often
called the month of bastards. Stubbes said that with the
arrival of May, men, women and children assembled from
every parish, town, and village and went to the hills and
forests where they spent the night in pleasant pastimes. In
the morning they returned, carrying birch branches and
the trunk of a tall, young tree. They painted the tree in
various colors, decked it with flowers and banners and set
it up on the village green. In some instances small trees
were fastened securely in boxes and placed at the top of
the poles.
Every morning during May, the parishioners of St.
Andrews-under-shaft in London, set up a shaft which was
higher than the church steeple and after their ceremony,
they carefully put it away under the eaves of the church,
which were built so as to protect it. Puritans took offense
at the custom and cut the pole to pieces. In 1644 Parliament
passed an act for the suppression of Maypoles.
The worship of trees as symbols of male generative
power was widespread among ancient nations; and it was
in this sense that trees, tree trunks, posts, and pales became
214 SYMBOLS, SEX, AND THE STARS
prominent in the worship by the Jews in Canaan, of gods
of fertility. On ancient Babylonian tablets and seal cylin-
ders, trees are represented as symbols of the tree of life,
or the euphemistic tree which creates life. It is the same
tree which, in the story of Adam and Eve, is disguised as
the "tree of knowledge". To people of the East, wise in the
language of symbolism, the meaning of the tree of life,
which flourishes in a paradise or garden, is perfectly obvious.
Conventional representations of the tree of life, in the
form of upright wooden pillars or tree trunks, and called
asherim (translated "groves" in the Bible), were special
symbols of the Syrian god Baal and often had obscene
designs carved on their surface. Even in the temple at
Jerusalem there stood an upright ashera, the emblem of
Baal-Pear, the phallus or priapus of the Jews. (I Kings
23:6). The "image of jealousy" which Ezekiel said could
be seen upon looking north through the inner gate of the
temple was undoubtedly an ashera. (Ezek. 8:3).
Baal corresponded to the Assyrian god Asher and was
represented as being either male, female, or both; therefore
an androgyne. Although he is nominally male, Baal is
called "the lady" in Hos. 2:8 and Zeph. 1:4. At his licentious
rites men wore female garments and women wore male
attire.
The feminine form of Baal was called Beltis, Astarte,
or Ashtoreth, and was represented by a feminine form of
wooden emblem called asherah or asharah, signifying the
door of life, and was probably similar in appearance to the
Assyrian type shown on Plate 67.
The relation of pillars and poles to phallic worship is
further indicated by the Hebrew word phalash,2 or palash,
meaning "to break or cut through", "to open up a way";
by the Latin word palus or pales; and the German pfale,
signifying a pale, which is a universal symbol of the phallus.
Pala is a word for spade or the broad part of an oar (the
part which cleaves the water), both being symbols of the
male organ of generation. The names Phyllis and Philip
mean "love" or "loving". According to this construction,
2-Compare with Phallu, the son of Reuben (Gen. 46:9), signifying
"a distinguished one", "he splits, divides"; "he is round and

dagger, the bull, the tree of Ute and the "door of Zife" with
the tree within it.
Palestine, the land of the Philistines, would denote the land
of worshipers of the phallus.
Asherim and groves or gardens were prominent features
of the procreation rites which back-sliding Israelites prac-
ticed at their "high places". The groves or gardens might be
either· single trees or clusters of them, under or near which
altars and images of Baal were placed. Ezekiel complained
that Jewish women spent much of their time "making hang-
ings for the groves" (Ezek. 16:16 and II Kings 23:7) where
they engaged in adulterous practices, in tents or booths, irt
their worship of the gods of fertility. The sacred high places
which had existed since Abraham's time had become cor-
rupted by heathen practices copied from the Canaanite
followers of Astarte. Later prophets made it clear that
216 SYMBOLS, SEX, AND THE STARS
worship of images and gods of fertility was rampant through-
out the land. Perhaps it was only due to the bloody reform
of Josiah that worship of Jahveh survived at all.8
3-She (Judah) committed whoredom with stones and with stocks

SEX SYMBOLISM
(Continued)
THE RELIGIOUS EXALTATION created by worship of the
forces which generate life caused the rites and ceremonies
of primitive people to assume an extreme and violent form.
With the impulsive, passionate people of the East, particu-
larly, nature worship frequently took an erotic form, with
the religious side of the ritual being overshadowed by sacred
prostitution, phallic worship, self-mutilation, and other
extremes.
The growth of Christianity was due, in part, to a
repugnance which thinking people had begun to feel against
the orgies and obscenities of fertility cults. In its movement
away from these debasing practices, the pendulum swung
to the other extreme and, whereas the old religion was de-
voted to worship of the powers of procreation, the new one
developed a profound abhorrence of sex, its members be-
lieving the creation of life to be innately sinful and a
cause of human degradation.
St. Paul repeatedly recommended to his listeners an
Essenian rule of conduct which, if it had become general,
would have resulted in the depopulation of the world. Paul
spoke with pride and joy of his chastity and urged that
young men and women forego marriage. Men and women
who were already married were asked to abstain from
sexual acts.
To avoid the temptations of life, emotionally unstable
members of the new religion abjured human society and
became ragged beggars or hermits, living amidst filth and
vermin in secluded caves, wells and mountain crags. In
their contempt for the human body, some early leaders of
the church, like Origen and Melitto, went so far as to resort
to self-mutilation, a practice which, the Gospels say, was
sanctioned even by Christ.1
1-"... and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs
of men; and there be eunuchs, which have made themselves
eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that is able to
receive it, let him receive it." Matt. 19:12.
217
218 SYMBOLS, SEX, AND 'l'HE S'l'ARS
The avowed celibacy of religious extremists sprang from
a pre-occupation with the sexual idea. The history of mon-
astery and convent life during the Dark Ages attests the
fact that human resistance frequently broke down under the
physical and mental strain occasioned by a life contrary to
nature. The celibate often yielded to the temptations he
had sought to avoid.
On the other hand, there was, among nature wor-
shipers, a complete absence of sex inhibitions, and their
most honored gods were those that were believed to regulate
the mysteries of the life cycle from germination of the life-
bearing seed, in animal or plant life, through birth, growth,
and death. Next in sanctity to the gods who created all
life were the instruments with which they performed their
holy miracles. As early as the building of the pyramids,
long before circumcision was practiced by the Jews, the
Egyptians dedicated the sexual organs to the god of gener-
ation by the rite of circumcision. For priests and soldiers
circumcision was compulsory. In Madagascar it is still
necessary for soldiers and officials.
Circumcision prevailed among the early Ethiopians,
Phoenicians, Syrians, Idumeans, Moabites, and Ishmaelites.
In more recent times it was known to the early Mexicans,
South Americans, Fijians, Samoans, Australians, and other
primitive people. Among some peoples, such as the Turks
and Malays, the legal and social status of a man is deter-
mined by circumcision. In certain African tribes uncir-
cumcised persons are refused the rights of inheritance and
are not admitted to the tribal councils.
The sanctity of the generative organs in Biblical times
is revealed by an incident where Abraham, wishing his
servant to swear "by the Lord, the God of heaven", com-
manded the servant to place his hand under the patriarch's
"thighs" in order that the physical representative of Jah-

(Gen. 24:2, 9). Israel commanded his son Joseph to swear
in the same manner (Gen. 47:29) and, when Solomon
ascended the throne, all princes and mighty men "gave their
hand under Solomon". I Chron. 29:24f}.
The words sacrifice and sacrament are from the Latin
word sacer, meaning sacred. Sacer appears to be cognate
with the Hebrew word zakar, meaning phallus. The words
test, testify, and testimony are derived from the ancient

In India, worshipers of Siva reverently touch the testes
of the sacred bull Nanda as they begin their worship. No
more solemn oath could be made by a Hindu, or other
eastern person, than by making him swear with a hand on
the testes of Nanda, nor could a son or servant give a more
enduring pledge than by placing his hand on the testes.
The Jews believed that only the sexually perfect were
fit to serve the lord of generation and the Mosaic Laws
provided that a man who was "wounded in the stones",
emasculated or otherwise sexually imperfect, could not serve
as a priest, nor could he enter the house of the congregation.8
If a woman were guilty of injuring the sacred organ of
a man, one of her hands was cut off. (Deut. 25:12). Saul
preferred death by falling on his sword to the degradation
of capture by uncircumcised Philistines.. (I Sam. 31:4).
The extent to which the Biblical injunction regarding
physical perfection of priests is observed today in the selec-
tion of popes is known only to higher ecclesiastics. Roscoe•
tells us, however, that before Roderigo Borgia was installed
as Pope Alexander VI, he was examined in the holy of holies
of the Vatican to make sure that he was in every sense a
man, although he was already known to be the father of
several children.
According to early, primitive concepts, Jahveh himself
was the progenitor par excellence and when sixteen thou-
sand captive Midianite virgins were distributed among the
victorious Jews, thirty-two of the maidens were allotted as
the Lord's tribute and reserved for his special service.
(Num. 31:40). Long after the Jewish religion began to
assume an ethical character, the role of Jahveh continued
to be predominately that of a god of fertility, whose worship
was expected to assure full reproductive ability to men and
women.
Repeated references are made in the Bible to phallic
idols, images, and worship, but they have been so thor-
oughly disguised in translation that they give the average
reader no understanding of the beliefs and practices to which
they refer. Many of the names of people and places men-
tioned also have a phallic significance, which is not revealed
by standard Bible Concordances.

Jeremiah complained that his people set up pillars in
the form of bosheth, translated under the word "shame"5
which, like the words "thigh" and "loins", is used as a
synonym for phallus. To the Jews the word bosheth was
so common in ordinary speech that both Saul and Jonathan
gave the name bosheth to their sons.6 The idols to which
the Israelites made sacrifices at Baal-Peor were bosheth,
Baal, the god of generation, being rendered interchangeable
with bosheth. The word Peor means opening or womb and
worship of Baal-Peor was worship of the male and female
principles. Elsewhere the words "abdominable . thing",
"filthiness", and "nakedness" are the terms most frequently
used in the Bible when speaking of the sex organs.
Jacob wrestled with the Lord and called the place
Peniel because, according to the Bible translators, there he
saw the Lord's face. (Gen. 32:30). This, of course, cannot
be accepted in a literal sense for it is inconceivable that
Jacob could have actually struggled physically with an
omnipotent creator. "Faces" is a mystic term frequently
employed to denote the different attributes or aspects of
God. The face Jacob saw was Peni-El. El is a title of
God and the first part of the word needs no explanation.
The idols which Rachel stole from Laban (Gen. 31:24);
the images which the Danites took from Micah (Jud. 15:5,
·rn, 24); and the idol which David's wife, Michal, put in
her bed to deceive Saul's messengers (I Sam. 19:13, 16),
appear to have been male or female images with exaggerated
sexual parts representing the god or goddess of fertility.
Maachah was deposed as queen for making an idol of this
sort in a grove (I Kings 15:13), and it may be remem-
bered that Abraham's father Terah was a maker of images.
The worship of phalli by the women of Jerusalem was
sternly condemned by Ezekiel 16:17: "Thou hast also taken

Models of the phallus were hung around the necks
of Greek children as a defense against and a defiance of witch-
craft and the evil eye. Even in modern times, they have
been used as common amulets by men, women, and children
in Italy and other Mediterranean countries, and by natives
of the Celebes Islands. The significance of the phallus in
ancient mythology still endures in Japan where, in the
Shinto religion, it is a symbol of vigorous animal life, the
enemy of disease and death. On the island of Ambon, in
the Celebes, when men .are quarreling one of them will
sometimes uncover his sexual parts as a challenge to and
defiance of his opponent.7
In early times the mere exposure of the naked body
was apparently thought to put the gods of fertility in a happy
or favorable state of mind. King David danced nude before
the ark of the Lord (II Sam. 6:20) and, when the Israelites
became restless because of Moses' long absence·on Mt. Sinai,
they called upon Aaron to make them a god to go before
them. Aaron set up an image of the Egyptian bull calf Apis,
to which the people sacrificed and feasted, then rose to
dance nude and to play. (Ex. 32:6, 25). The words whic~
are translated "to play" refer, in the Hebrew version, to
the kind of play which caused the fall of Adam and Eve.
Arnobius wrote of a myth in which the goddess Ceres
was described as wandering over the earth in search of
her daughter Proserpine until she arrived grief stricken, at
the hut of an Athenian woman named Baubo, who offered
her a refreshing drink called Cyceon. The disconsolate
goddess refused to accept the token of hospitality and
Baubo was much distressed by the turn of events until she
conceived an odd plan to end the awkward situation. She
shaved the hirsute fringe from her genitals, then exposed
herself to the goddess, who laughed heartily, immediately
forgot her sorrow, and accepted the proffered beverage.

more primitive day, the chemise was not worn.

drums to drive away the rain demons. In some parts of
Java it is thought that the yield of the rice field will be
greater if, at the beginning of the planting season, the
farmer and his wife run around the field naked then unite
in a conjugal embrace. When the rice is harvested, bundles
of rice ears are tied up to represent a bridal pair, and the
harvest is carried out with the ceremonies of marriage.
From the time when Babylonians baked them in honor
of the goddess Ishtar, cakes, usually in the form of male or
female organs, were served annually during festivals of the
gods and goddesses of fertility. At Syracuse, on the day of
the Thesmophoria, and at marriages, cakes of sesame and
honey representing female pudenda were carried in pro-
cession and offered to the gods. They were eaten by women
on the Holy day and were probably part of the ceremonies
in the Eleusinian Mysteries. In Jerusalem, cakes were baked
in honor of Baal and Astarte, and Jeremiah complained
that the "children cut wood and the fathers kindled fires
and the women knead their dough to their gods". (Jer. 7:18).
As late as the end of the 4th century there existed in
Rome a body of women called Collyridians who worshiped
Cybele as the Mater Creatoris, Dei Genetrix, mother of cre-
ation, mother of God; and judged it necessary to appease
her anger and seek her favor by libations, sacrifices, and
oblations of cakes.
Dulaure states that in his time a festival called La Fete
des Pinnes was held at the town of Saintes, in France, on
Palm Sunday, in which women and children carried in the
procession phalli made of bread and called pinne. These
were attached to the ends of palm branches as symbols of
fertility and regeneration. The pinnes were blessed by the
priest and carefully preserved by the women during the
year.8
In his Remains of the Worship of Priapus, Richard
Payne Knight says that in Saintonge, near La Rochelle,
cakes in the form of phalli were baked at Easter time and
formed part of the Easter offerings. Afterward they were
distributed to the homes.
A similar custom existed at St. Jean d'Angely where small
cakes, made in the form of the phallus and named fateaux,
8--Des Divinites Generatrices, J. B. Dulaure, Paris, 1825.
SEX SYMBOLISM 225
were carried in the procession of the Fete-Dieu or Corpus
Christi. Dulaure, who describes the custom, says that
shortly before the time of writing, (1825), the practice was
suppressed by a new prefect of the district. In Brives and
nearby towns, cakes were made .in the form of the male
organs while in Clermont and other places, they were of
female form. In some of the older French books on cookery,
recipes are given for making cakes in these forms, which
are named without concealment.
In addition to· the great variety of rather abstract or
formalized symbols of procreative power, realistic represen-
tations of the phallus were used by nature worshipers for
a great many purposes and in many forms and sizes, the
most lifelike type being statues or models of the nude male
or of the phallus alone, which was generally of unnatural size.
As the creation of life, in a sense, overcomes or offsets
the ravages of death, both abstract symbols and literal rep-
resentations of the sexual organs came to be associated with
life, fertility, health, and good fortune. They were the holy
sacraments which nature worshipers displayed in temples. ·
When carried in processions, they were believed to have
the same power to ward off devils and malign influences
which, in Catholic countries is attributed to the 'Holy Sac-
rament, for which reason the Host is paraded around shrines
and towns. Upon it the most solemn oaths are taken, for
a "corporale oath" means an oath on the corporale or linen
cloth surrounding the Corpus Domini. To touch the altar cloth
is a blessing and to take an oath with one hand on the altar
stone is as binding as when Abraham's servant placed his
hand under the thighs of his master or when Jacob swore
on the pachad of his father Jesse.
Phallic symbols were used in Spain, France, Ireland,
Scandinavia, Egypt, Greece, Rome, Syria, Persia, and Asia
Minor; among the mound builders of North America, in
Mexico, Central America, Peru, Haiti, in the islands of the
Pacific and in Africa. Many of the literary references,
paintings, and sculptures relating to the subject which have
come down to us are so direct and realistic that they cannot
be printed.
In the annual festival in honor of Isis and Osiris in
Egypt, processions of women carried phalli to which strings
226 SYMBOLS, SEX, AND THE STARS
were attached to permit of their being moved up and down.9
Sometimes the phalli which were used in temples and
carried in religious festivities were of tremendous size. In
a procession during the reign of Ptolemy Philadelphus, a
phallus was carried which was covered with gold and was
one hundred twenty yards long. Before the temple of
Venus at Hierapolis, there stood two phalli which were one
hundred eighty feet high, upon which a priest mounted an-
nually and remained for seven days. On the walls of the
temple at Thebes, Egyptian gods and kings are portrayed
with the phallus erect, and the great temple at Karnak
abounds with such figures.
In Greece and Rome the god of fertility was worshiped
under numerous titles and his phallic image was an im-
portant feature of the Liberalia, May Day, Floralia and
other festivals to celebrate the regeneration of life at spring-
time. As Liber, he presided over domestic animals, the cul-
tivation of vineyards, and harvest, and was symbolized by
the phallus. His female counterpart, Libera, was identified
with Ceres and Venus and represented in the temples by
the image of the female organ.
Effigies of the phallus were anointed with oil, removed
from the temples, decorated with flowers; and carried or
drawn in carriages through the streets, followed by a cheer-
ing throng. During the spring festival in honor of Venus,
women took the image of the sacred phallus from the hall
of the Quirinal and carried it in procession to the temple
of Venus, where it was united with the goddess with
appropriate ceremonies.
Licentiousness reached its peak about the first of May
in the celebration of Floralia, when the riffraff of the town
9-At this festival, women used to go about singing songs in his
praise and carrying obscene images of him which they set in
motion by means of strings. The custom was probably a charm
to insure the growth of crops. A similar image of him, decked
in the fruits of the earth, is said to have stood in the temple
before a figure of Isis and in the chambers dedicated to him at
Philae, the dead god is portrayed lying on his bier in an atti-
tude which indicates in the plainest way that even in death, his
generative virtue is not extinct, but only suspended, ready to
prove a source of life and fertility. Hymns of praise allude to
the mighty side of his nature. Golden Bough, Abgd. Ed., Sir
Jas. Frazer, p. 391.

blance, holding the sexual parts prominent and fecund". Again,

and its neighborhood, called together by the sound of horns,
mixed with the multitude in perfect nakedness and excited
their passion with obscene motions and language until the
festival ended in a scene of mad revelry in which all re-
straint was laid aside. One of these festivals was witnessed
by the younger Cato, who was noted for his grave manner,
and he left the scene when the revelers seemed to hesitate
in stripping the young women naked because of his presence.
By reason of its reputed power of enchantment and witch-
craft, the phallus became synonymous with the name of
the Roman god Fascinus, also called Mutunus or Tutunus
and later identified with Priapus. Fascinus was attended
by Vestal Virgins, and victorious generals carried his sym-
bols through Rome on their cars or chariots in triumphal
processions.
The words fascinate and fascinator were derived from
Fascinus because his symbol, when worn about the necks
of women and children, was supposed to possess magical
power which not only enabled its wearer to influence others,
but protected them from magical or other influence from
without.
The first mention of medieval worship of Fascinum
occurs in an ecclesiastical tract of the 8th century entitled
Judicia Sacerdotalia Criminibus which directs that who-
ever performs incantations to the Fascinum, or any incan-
tations whatever, except the Creed or the Lord's prayer,
shall be made to do penance on bread and water during
three Lents. A council in Chalons, France, in the 9th
century prohibited the practice in almost the same words,
and the Bishop of Worms repeated the warning again in
the 12th century. In 1247, the statutes of Mans decreed
a punishment for any one who sinned to the Fascinum, and
the same provision was adopted and renewed in the statutes
of the synod of Tours, in 1396; nevertheless the practice
continued until well after the Middle Ages.
Of all the titles under which the god of procreation was
worshiped, perhaps none was so widely known as that of
Priapus. Under this name he was associated with the god-
.<less Isis in Egypt before the days of Cleopatra. Erotic
statues, pottery, coins and gems representing him abounded
in Greece: his attributes and activities were portrayed on
gems of the. Gnostics, Basilideans, and Manicheans at the
beginning of the Christian era. From Rome, where he was
SYMBOLS, SlilX, AND 'l'H.l!l S'l'AltS
particularly popular, his worship was carried to the Roman
colonies in Gaul, Belgium, Germany, and Britain.
Priapus was the beneficent deity who increased herds
of cattle, watched over fruit trees, and cared for bees. He
was the patron of maidens seeking marriage. Brides were
required to sit upon his statue and sacrifice their virginity
to him.
Designs have been found on many coins, statuary, pot-
tery and other articles recovered from the ruins of Pompeii
and Herculaneum, on which Priapus is portrayed with large
phallus, either alone or in the center of groups engaged in
sexual acts. Frequently he is represented by the figure of
a phallus alone; thus the adjective "Priapic" became a
general term denoting any object or practice of a lewd,
obscene nature. During the annual carnival at Trani, in
Italy, a Priapic effigy called il santo membro was paraded
through the streets.
His symbol was carved over doorways or on door
jambs. It was used as an idol or amulet in houses and
gardens, in front of blacksmiths' forges, under chariots, and
in ancient tombs where it was thought to guard the dead
against evil influences. It was also a favorite decorative
motif for lamps and other household utensils and was often
carved on the exterior or interior walls and doorways of
churches and other public buildings. Representations of
the phallus usually had wings: sometimes they were en-
circled with flowers and often they were attached to human
or animal legs.
Pins, brooches and other objects in the form of the male
organ, sometimes with rings attached for hanging about
the neck, were worn as personal ornaments or carried. as
amulets to insure fruitfulness, health, and protection from
one's enemies or drive away devils and other evil influences.
Many such objects have been recovered in modern times
from excavations on the sites of ancient buildings, and ex-
amples of them may be found in many European museums
and private collections. Drawings made from many of these
relics are reproduced in the scholarly works on phallicism,
printed privately, by Richard Payne Knight10 and Thomas
Wright.11

In France and Belgium, ithyphallic saints were offered
favors to obtain children, or to cure impotency or sexual
disease. The most famous of these saints was St. Foutin,
who is reputed to have been the first bishop of Lyons. When
Protestants seized the town of Embrun during the Refor-
mation in 1585, they found among the relics of the cathedral
one which was said to be the phallus of the famous saint.
It had become stained deep red by the libations of wine
which had been poured upon it by supplicants who usually
caught the wine in a cup or jar as it dripped from the relic,
then let the wine stand until it soured. This "holy vinegar"
was drunk by women who considered it an effective method
of insuring fertility. The famous saint was also worshiped
at Porigny, in the diocese of Viviers; at Vendre, in the
Bourbonnais; at Auxerre; at Puy-en-Velay, in the convent
of Girouet, near Sampigny; and elsewhere.
Wax models of both sexes were offered to St. Foutin at
Varailles, in Provence, in the 16th century. The models
were suspended from the ceiling of his chapel and were so
numerous that when the wind stirred them they struck
against one another and disturbed the congregation.12
At Bourg Dieu, near Bourges, Belgium, local inhabitants
worshiped a phallic figure called St. Grelichon, or Guer-
lichon, which had persisted from Roman times. Barren
women flocked to the abbey to seek the saint's aid and to
celebrate a novena in his honor. The supplicant would
recline upon the relic at full length and then scrape particles
from the phallus of the image. These scrapings, when
placed in water, were supposed to make a miraculous
draught.
At Brest, the same saint was honored under the name
of Guignolet, and a similar sculptured figure called Ters
appeared .over the gateway to the church of St. Walburga,
in the Rue des Pecheurs at Antwerp.1a
St. Giles, in Brittany; St. Rene, in Anjou; St. Regnaud,
in Burgundy; and St. Arnaud, near Brest, were similarly
worshiped, except that in the latter case the symbol of
fecundity was covered with an apron which was only raised
in favor of sterile women. Its mere inspection, if accom-

panied by true faith, was considered sufficient to effect
miracles.14
At Isernia, near Naples, Italy, Saints Cosmus and
Damiano were believed to be highly effective against all
sorts of disease. At their feast, on September ·27th, their
relics were carried in procession and the phallus of Cosmo
was exposed to view for the benefit of the celebrants. A
three day fair was held on the occasion, at an ancient church
about a mile from the town, the fair being visited by people
from the surrounding villages. During this celebration,
those who had any kind of bodily ailment could buy waxen
images of the affected part. After presenting an image and
an offering at the vestibule of the church, the supplicant
presented himself or herself to the priest at the altar and
uncovered the part affected. The priest then anointed .the
part with a miraculous "oil of St. Cosmus" which was be-
lieved to be particularly efficacious for ailments of the loins
and adjoining parts. Although waxen effigies for various
parts of the body were offered for sale, the greatest demand
was for phalli, the buyers of which were mostly women.
The building of a new road through the town, in 1780, gave
the community better contact with the outside world, and
news of the local custom soon reached the government in
Naples, which immediately ordered that the "great toe" of
the saint should no longer be displayed and the sale of
phallic images be discontinued.15
Phallic emblems have been found carved or scratched
on ancient Roman buildings in England, on the doors of
the cathedrals of Toulouse, Bordeaux, and other cities in
France, and on the walls of Alati, near Rome. In graves
of Vikings in Norway, large stones of phallic shape have
been found, some of which are preserved in the Museum
of Christiania. In Japan, the detached phallus is often used
as an emblem of the Shinto religion.
On Trendle Hill near the village of Cerne Abbas, in
Dorset, England, there is (or was) cut in the turf, an ancient
nude figure one hundred eighty feet long, with distinct
sexual parts. As an emblem of fertilizing power the image

was a protection against sterility, disease, and death, and
was also a guardian of fruit trees and vineyards. If an
unmarried girl at Cerne Abbas became pregnant, it was
said of her, "she has beeri sitting on the giant".
By an odd reversal of practice, the ·position which the
male symbol occupied on buildings in Europe was, in
Ireland, filled by a crude figure of a woman directing at-
tention to her matrix. Sculptured figures of this kind were
placed over the portals of ancient churches and castles,
most of which. have long been torn down.
To Irish antiquarians these peculiar sculptures are
known as Sheila-na-Gig which is said to mean Julian the
Giddy, but their prominent positions over doorways indi-
cates that, despite their trivial name, they were symbols
of great importance.
Such a figure was carved over the doorway of Cloyne
Cathedral. Similar figures were on an old church at Roches-
town, and on Ballinahend Castle, both in Tipperary. An
example from an old church, which formerly stood in the
County Cavan, is now preserved in the Museum of the
Society of Antiquaries, in Dublin. In the Museum of Dublin
there is another which came from the White Island, in
Lough Erne, County Fermanagh. One from Killoa Castle,
Westmoreland, is in a London private collection.
In the Orient small phallic images were often placed
by the roadside; in front of dwellings; beneath trees in
sacred groves; and the ground on which the emblems stood
was regarded as holy. As prayers to the god of fertility were
232 SYMBOLS, SEX, AND 'l'Hl1] S'l'AHS
thought more likely to be answered if they were offered
while in contact with the image, it was customary for the
supplicant to raise her clothing and sit upon the image
while praying. This custom is still practiced by girls and
women in some parts of the world, to invoke divine aid.
In India, under the Hindu name of linga, the phallus
has been a special emblem of Siva, the Reproducer, for
countless centuries. Some of these linga, made of marble,
granite, or rare woods, are many feet in height and are
found, decorated with flowers and other offerings, in the
temples. Miniature models of gold, silver, ivory, crystal, or
wood are worn in the hair or on the arm or breast as
amulets or charms. Many linga temples are found on the
banks of the Ganges, especially near Calcutta.
Members of the Sakteyan sect pay special homage to
the vulva, which is honored as the symbol and incarnation
of Parvati, the female counterpart of Siva, the creative deity.
Under the name of lingam, the .male and female symbols,
represented in union, are the most widely used images in
India. Throughout southern India they are found in temples
and homes, in a great variety of designs. Making of the
various types of lingams is a highly specialized art, the
proportions and materials used in their construction being
minutely regulated by an ancient canon called the Agama.
Almost every village has a public lingam consisting of
an oval shaped flat stone and a round, upright stone two
or three feet high. The monument is visited early in the
morning by women and girls, who sprinkle it with water
from the Ganges, deck it with flowers, and rub their bodies
against it while reciting prayers to insure motherhood.
In recent times, phallic statues have been found in
the East Indian Archipelago, New Guinea, Sumatra, and
Ceylon~ Both male and female figures had exaggerated pu-
denda. On the eastern and western sides of a house in Dorei,
New Guinea, there were, some years ago, two pairs of rude
wooden statues, each pair representing a man and woman
in the conjugal act. Beside the door, on the western side,
there was an image of a child lying on its back. Other parts
of the building were also adorned with suggestive carvings.is
In the Celebes islands, representations of women's
breasts and sexual organs were to be found on the posts of
16-G. A. Wilken, Verspreide Geschrifterv, Hague, 1912, 111, 213f.

houses erected in honor of fallen warriors. On a temple
at Langgadopi, the organs of both sexes were shown in
union.17
In Africa, tree, serpent and sex worship have existed
in their vilest forms within the present century. Here the
ancient tree of life is still anointed with oil and the drip-
pings from it are believed to be a sure cure for all the ills
of man or woman. Fetiches in phallic form are often used
in the African Congo and, at Dahomey, along the Slave
Coast, a gross figure of a man with exaggerated sexual parts
is worshiped under the name of Legba or Egba. Phallic
statues may be seen in front of houses, on the streets, and
in public places.18 In one Legba shrine, a male and female
figure of the fertility god Obatala was shown and opposite
it were the male and female organs represented in union.19

Religious Prostitution
IN ADDITION TO the gifts and prayers which were given as.
offerings to the ancient goddess who bestowed the blessings
of fertility upon womanhood, she was repaid in kind by
sexual offerings in the form of religious prostitution in early
Babylonia, Syria, Phoenicia, Arabia, Egypt, Greece, and
Rome. A similar custom prevailed in Central America, West
Africa, and other parts of the world. The custom was not
confined to consecrated women, or temple prostitutes who
served the Mother Goddess, but was regarded as a solemn
religious duty of all women.
Sir James Frazer has described the custom as a form of
sympathetic magic, undertaken in a belief, once widely held,
that like produces like and that a desired result can be
achieved by simply imitating it. Sympathetic magic was
practiced by the sorcerers of India, BabyIonia, Egypt,
Greece, and Rome, and is still employed by witch doctors
among primitive people. Sir James describes many forms
of sympathetic magic and says: "Among the Bataks of
Sumatra, a barren woman who would become a mother
will make an image of a child and hold it in her lap, be-
lieving this will lead to the fulfillment of her wish", and
"The North American Indians believed", we are told, "that
by drawing the figure of a person in sand, ashes or clay,
or by considering an object as his body and then piercing
it with a sharp stick, or doing it any other injury, they
inflicted a corresponding injury on the person represented".
"When an Ojibway Indian desires to work evil on any
one, he makes a little image of his enemy and runs a needle
into its head or heart, or shoots an arrow into it, believing
that wherever the needle pierces or the arrow strikes the
image, his foe will, the same instant, be seized with a
sharp pain in the corresponding part of his body".1

In every age it has been believed that a person could
be injured or destroyed by injuring or destroying an image
of him. When a Babylonian wished to destroy witches or
evil spirits, he burned wax images of them.
For similar reasons it was believed that imitating the
acts of the gods by consorting with a consecrated woman,
the earthly representative of the goddess of fertility, it was
possible to assure the birth of children, increase of cattle,
and fruitfulness of fields.
While there may be instances in which the custom
originated in these beliefs, religious prostitution was prob-
ably more often a sacrifice of virginity at puberty; a sac-
rifice which was looked upon as the most personal and most
important a woman could make to the goddess in order to
consecrate her life to motherhood. It was doubtless related
to the widespread custom of dedicating the first born child
to the deity as "first fruits of the womb".
In Cyprus, Heliopolis, Syria, Lydia, ·Armenia, Phoe-
nicia, Babylon, and elsewhere, every woman was required
to undergo a period during which she sat before the temple
as an offering to the temple goddess, whose name varied
from city to city, but whose character remained essentially
the same. In Babylon every woman was required, once
in her life, to prostitute herself at the temple of Mylitta to
the first stranger who threw a silver coin in her lap, and
to dedicate to the goddess the wages earned by this sanc-
tified harlotry. Surrounding the te:r;nple of Bit-Shaggathu
was a gallery behind which women gathered daily. Cords
attached to them were broken when visitors made their
selection.
The custom must be judged as the product of an age
when women were everywhere regarded as soulless chattels
whose sole purpose and duty was motherhood; when bar-
renness was looked upon as the work of an evil spirit, and
spinsterhood was condemned as a rejection of the god of
generation. This was the attitude of Jephthah's. daughter
who, when told that she was to be sacrificed, asked only that
she be given two months in which to wander up and down
the country bemoaning, not the fact that she was to be
sacrificed, but that she would meet her death in a virgin
state. (Jud. 30:30, 39). The story seems to have been con-
nected, at least in later times at Mizpah and perhaps else-
where, with a ceremony which consisted . originally in
286 SYMBOLS, SEX, AND THE STARS
mourning for the death of the virgin goddess. Jephthah's
name means "(God) opens the womb", a title which was
often bestowed on fertility gods.
As different groups or cults came to exercise a prefer-
ence for worship of either of the creative powers, they
became known as worshipers of the male or female power.
In Egypt, the religion was devoted to both male and female.
In India, devotees of Vishnu particularly honor the female
and Sivaites worship the male. Early Babylonian worship
of the female changed under Semitic influence to worship
of the male. During the period of Assyrian domination, even
the great goddess Ishtar was given military and other
masculine characteristics.
The markedly inferior status of Jewish women, and
the fact that they had no part in the national religion,
caused them to become worshipers of Baal-Ashtoreth and
Baal-Peor. Ezekiel described them as being even more dis-
solute than whores for, whereas the latter demanded pay
for their services, Jewish women made gifts to the men
who accepted their favors. (Ezek. 16:33, 34).
With full, red lips and eyes rimmed with kohl; be-
decked with tinkling bells and spangles, gold and silver
ankle and leg ornaments, bracelets, earrings and nose
jewels, t.hey sauntered forth to stalk men on the highways.
Around their elbows they wore large "tires" puffed out
like pillows; on their heads, unmarried girls wore ker-
chiefs denoting the season of women and the full moon.
(Ezek. 13:18, 21).
"High places" were located in every street and women
tore up their garments to make gaily colored hangings and
couch covers for the Succoth-Benoth, or tents, in which they
paid honors to the god of fertility. (II Kings 23:7 and
Ezek. 16:16).
The Scriptures do not distinguish between prostitution
as a religious rite and as a social vice, but it is evident that,
in both forms, the practice flourished in Judah and Israel
throughout the Biblical period. Repeated references to rape,
incest, seduction; the enactment of laws forbidding that
Jewish women and men should become whores and Sodom-
ites;2 statutes to insure virginity of brides; the regulation

of prostitution, concubinage, and the taking of plural wives;
point to the fact that unbridled sexual gratification was a
social problem of the first order.
The pagan temple of Queen Jezebel alone had four
hundred devotees and Hosea (4:14f) affirms that not only
did many women of Israel commit harlotry, but that the
leaders of the nation and its priests offered their sacrifices
with the sacred prostitutes. Whores and Sodomites were
quartered in houses adjoining the temple (II Kings 23:7)
and even the precincts of the temple itself were invaded
by the prostitutes. The Book of Samuel (2:22) shows that
the harlots assembled at the north door of the temple where
the image of jealousy was located: "Now Eli was very old
and heard all that his sons did unto all Israel and how they
lay with the women that assembled at the door of the
tabernacle of the congregation of the Lord".
As a consequence of their practicing the rites of Baal-
Peor with Midianite women, a great number· of Israelites
238 SYMBOLS, .SEX, AND THE STARS
were smitten with an incurable disease, probably syphilis.
As a sanitary measure, all captive Midianite women who
had "known men by lying with them" (Num. 31:16, 17)
were put to death.
Twenty-four thousand sons of Israel died from disease
contracted in practicing the rites of Baal-Pear with the
women of Moab (Num. 25:9). Men of the nation were
warned that they would be smitten "by the botch of Egypt,
and with the emerods, and with the scab, and with the
itch, whereof thou canst not be healed" (Deut. 28:27) and
their bowels would fall out. (I~ Chron. 21:13, 15).
The Book of Genesis (38:14, .16) bears testimony that
religious prostitution was known to the Jews at a very early
period, for we are told that Tamar deceived her father-in-
law Judah by veiling herself after the manner of the temple
women, and sitting before the door where Judah saw her
and went in unto her. Tamar was able to entice Judah because
he thought she was a temple harlot with whom it was
permissible to associate.
Isaiah (6: 18) took note of the prostitutes who, in his
day, sat with cords about them like the temple prostitutes
of Babylon. As late as the first century A.D., the author
of the Epistle of Jeremy wrote, "women also, with cords
about· them, sit down in the streets to burn bran as incense
but if any of them, drawn by some one of the passersby, lie
with him, she reproacheth her neighbor that she was not
also thought worthy like herself, nor her cords broken".8
At the festival of the Semitic mother goddess Attar, at
Hierapolis-Bambysis (Syria) women prostituted themselves
and maidens vowed their virginity to prostitution, probably
indicating both temporary and permanent hierodouloi,
"sacred women", or "vowed women".
At the feast of Baste!, at Bubastis (Egypt), women
became temporary heirodouloi and Herodotus (11, 60) says
that men and women went to the festival in large barges.
At each village they went ashore to sing and dance and fre-
quently the women lifted their garments to display their
charms to the villagers.
A similar festival was held at Mendes, where women
who seem to have been temporary hierodouloi carried, in

Cone Bissell, 1880, v. 43.

procession, images of the god with the generative member
very much enlarged and arranged so that it nodded as it
was carried about.
Strabo wrote (c. 17; i, 46) that at Thebes "a very beau-
tiful girl of the most distinguished lineage was consecrated
to Zeus (Amon) and played the concubine and had inter-
course with whomsoever she desired until the natural puri-
fication of her body (i.e., until the expiration of the month)
then, after her purification, she was given to a husband".
Before marriage, all women in Cyprus were obliged by
custom to prostitute themselves to strangers at the temple
of the goddess and Greek inscriptions indicate that the cus-
tom was practiced there as late as the 2nd century A.D.
In India the temple prostitute has enjoyed a privileged
position for thousands of years. Every important temple of
the Sakteyan sect formerly had a number of consecrated
women connected with it. When very young, these girls
are chosen by the priests for their beauty, health, and grace,
and parents feel highly honored to have a daughter selected
for consecration to the god.
Saktis are worshipers of reproduction and their secret
rites are grossly physical. The rites celebrate worship of
the goddess, personified by a naked girl who is supposed
to be in a state of hypnotism or trance and unconscious of
what occurs during the ceremony. She is called a yogini
or female yogi (wandering ascetic), that is, a Kunti, or
personification of the yoni. .
After reaching puberty the girlS are initiated into the
mysteries and duties of their profession, after which ma,r-
riage is forbidden and their children become wards of the
temple. British influence has caused the custom to decline
in modern times, but it lingers on, principally in southern
India.
Within the past half century religious prostitution has
also been found on the Gold Coast of West Africa. Ellis
has stated that in some communities, the best looking girls
were selected when from ten to twelve years old and given
three years of instruction in learning the chants and dances
to the gods. At the end of this period they were initiated
as religious prostitutes.4

THE SYMBOLIC MEANING OF NUMBERS
THE SCIENCE OF NUMBERS was believed by the people of
many ancient nations to be a potent form of magic and was
reverenced as an invention of the gods. Quite apart from
their numerical and mathematical values, numbers were
esteemed as symbols which revealed to the learned the
divine order of the universe.
The identification of numbers with universal order is
linked with the name of Pythagoras (6th Cent. B.C.), who
brought existing notions regarding the meaning of numbers
into an orderly system and modified and enlarged the sys-
tem with many theories of his own. Acording to Aristotle
the Pythagorean system, in its original form, regarded num-
bers not merely as predictable relations of things, but as
actually constituting their essence or substance. Numbers, he
says, seemed to the Pythagoreans to be the first things in
the whole of nature and they supposed the elements of
numbers to be the elements of all things and the whole
heaven to be a musical scale and number.
The system was based upon an association of ideas or
upon certain philosophical conceptions concerning the
nature of the universe. Numbers were divided into odd
and even, limited and unlimited, one and many, right and
left, rest and motion, straight and curved, square and cir-
cular, light and darkness, good and evil. To the Pytha-
goreans the equilibrium of the universe was maintained by
the relation of its opposites. The numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, 9
were called heavenly numbers and 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 were
earthly numbers.
Pythagoras was one of the most learned and most
travelled men of the classic Greek period. Probably no
other man comprehended so much of all the learning of
his time. After being initiated into the Eleusinian Mysteries,
Pythagoras went to Egypt, where he was initiated into the
Mysteries of Isis, and is said to have been taught the secret
meaning of numbers by an Egyptian priest named Huramon
240
THE SYMBOLIC MEANING OF NUMBERS 241
(Horus Ammon)l. In Phoenicia and Syria he learned the
Mysteries of Adonis. In Palestine he is said to have spent
some time with a mystic sect at Carmel. In Babylon he
learned the Mysteries of the Chaldean priests. From Baby-
lon he went, by way of Persia, to Hindustan, where he spent
several years as a pupil of the Brahmans.
Although Pythagoras was known as a great mathema-
tician and philosopher, his greatest discovery was, perhaps,
that of the dependence of the musical intervals on certain
mathematical ratios of lengths of string at the same tension;
2:1 giving the octave, 3:2 the 5th, and 4:3 the 4th.
The following notes are not particularly intended to
describe the numerical system of Pythagoras, but rather to
indicate the general method by which the symbolic values
of numbers were determined.
1. Represents unity, origin, the source of all things.
It is identified with the point and is thus a unit having
position and magnitude. Identified with reason (intellect)
because it is unchangeable.
2. In one sense two signifies male and female, father
and mother, the cause of increase and division. It is iden-
tified with opinion because it is unlimited and indeter-
minate. On the principle that the universe consists of a
dual system in which all existence is composed of pairs of
opposites, · this figure is considered a female or negative
symbol. As the Zoroastrians interpreted this idea, the uni-
verse was divided between the two spirits of good and evil
called "the twins which were in the beginning". In India
the same thought is expressed in the doctrine that all ex-
istence is resolved into Brahma and Maya, being and
appearance, reality and illusion.
3. Is identified with creation and resurrection or re-
newal, the third member of the trinity. The pantheons of
nearly all nations were presided over by three superior
gods, or by gods grouped in triads of related deities.
(As in Egypt, Greece, Rome, Babylonia, Persia, India, China,
Japan, etc.).
1-Huram embodies ChR1 the eternal light and AUM representing
the creation, preservation and destruction of life or childhood,
manhood and old age. Ben Aur, whom Moses requested to build
the temple, means son of light, or son of Horus. Hiram of Tyre
to whom Solomon appealed for craftsmen to build his great
temple, is another rendering of Huram.
242 SYMBOLS, SEX, .AND THE STARS
Three is identified with the triangle by which the deity
was symbolized everywhere. The ineffable name of the
Jews was depicted in a triangle with each of the three
letters JHV representing a different phase of his being
or manifestation, and the three-branched letter Shin was
inscribed on the phylacteries which were worn by the
Israelites.
It is the number of the whole because it has a begin-
ning, a middle and an end. It also signifies the 3 vertical
divisions of the universe: heaven, earth, and the subter-
ranean waters which, in the Babylonian system, were ruled
by Anu, Bel, and Ea.
Three is the number of knowledge, music, geometry,
and astronomy; the essence.of celestial and terrestrial forces.
4. .The primordial number and the root of all things;
the foundation of nature and the most perfect number. As
2 represents the line and 3 represents the surface, 4 is
identified with the solid. This number typifies the cube
and square, consequently it is the sign for all mathematical
combinations. It is related to the organic world, as three is
related to the spiritual world, and represents organization
and dominion. Because of its many attributes Pythagoreans
gave 4 special values beyond its ordinary meaning.
. Four is associated with justice because it is the first
square number, the product of equals. Is identified with
the material world and its divisions; the 4 corners and 4
winds of the earth, the 4 rivers of Eden and the 4 rivers
of the old Babylonian mythology. The mysterious Pytha-
gorean Tetractys or 4 rows of dots* increasing from 1 to 4
was symbolic of the stages of creation. To add a row of
dots gives the next "triangular" number with 5 on a side
and so on, showing that the sum of any number of the
series of natural numbers beginning with 1 is a triangular
number. The sum of any number of the series of odd num-
bers, beginning with 1, is similarly seen to be a square,
that is 3 and 5 added successively to 1 each give a figure
of this kind. In the case of even numbers the sum of any
number, beginning with 2, makes an oblong.
·-
THE S.YMBOLIC MEANING OF NUMBERS 243
The Tetractys was probably associated with the four-
lettered word for the Jewish divine name JHVH. By adding
4 to the preceding numbers 1, 2, and 3, Pythagoras pro-
duced 10 which is the consummation of the Decad and the
number of completeness. It was formerly the arrangement
of soldiers in Chinese military tactics.
5. Represents marriage because it is the union of the
first masculine and first feminine numbers 3 and 2 (unity
not being considered a number). Among the Greeks it was
a symbol of light, health and vitality. It is called the
equilibrium because it divides the perfect number into 2
parts. Other numbers multiplied by themselves produce
other numbers. Only 5 and 6 multiplied by themselves
represent and retain their original numbers as the last
figure in their products.
Five is identified with fixed traditions; with order and
law, both divine and earthly. It is an important number
among the Chinese to whom custom and law carry great
force. The Hindus and Chinese recognize 5 as the num-
ber of qualities: 5 virtues, 5 basic forms, 5 senses, 5 ele-
ments, 5 colors, etc. To the Israelites it was the number
of military organization.
6. Is the number of completion, typified by the 6
days in which the world was created and symbolized by
the Jewish 6-pointed Star of David, and the Chakra, or
Wheel of Vishnu. In both the East and the West a belief
long persisted that the history of the world would be
divided into 6 ages after which would come destruction
and renewal of the world on a higher plane.
To Pythagoras, 6 represented the perfection of all the
parts, the form of forms. It sometimes appears as a symbol
of marriage because it is formed of two triangles, one mascu-
line, one feminine. It is identified with time as the measure
of duration and is a key number in ancient ~alendar systems.
It represents health because it is the balance number both
calendrically and symbolically.
The number 6 is associated with work, effort, and
creative energy, both human and divine.
7. One of the most venerated and most magical of
numbers, the number par excellence among the nations of
antiquity. Pythagoras called it "the vehicle of life". It con-
tains body and soul, spirit and matter, since it contains the
triangle and the square.
244 SYMBOLS, SEX, AND THE STA:i:tS
In the Bible, 7 is the number of the holy or divine day.
All of the great festivals are related to 7 days, weeks or
years. In the East 7 is associated with oaths or covenants.
The divine mysteries and the activities of the Holy Spirit
are 7 in number. Most of the associations of 7 have reference
to some direct relation of the divine and human. It is
therefore the number of religion.
It is called the number of life because of the belief that
7 month babies usually live while those born in the 8th
month do not. It is sometimes called a virgin number be-
cause it is the only number between 1 and 10 which cannot ·
be produced by either dividing or multiplying another num-
ber. It has been called motherless and fatherless; and
virgin, or Minerva, because it was not born of a mother but
was generated out of the crown or back of the father, the
mind.
Seven is an important lunar number identified . with
Ishtar, Aphrodite, Virgin Mary, and other holy mothers.
8. Is identified with the cube because it has 8 corners.
It is the only wholly even number under 10 (1 x 2 x 4 =
8 = 4 x 2 x 1); that is, 8 is divided by 2 4's, each 4 is
divided into 2 2's and 2 is divided into 2 l's.
Eight is identified with man's elevation to a higher
life or his deliverance from the evils of the present life. On
the 8th day came the final act in the sacred drama which
was part of the Eleusinian Mysteries. Clement of Alexandria
said, "Those in whom there is no guile do not remain in
the 7th, the place of rest but, are promoted to the heritage
of the divine beneficence which is the 8th grade". Some
of the early Church fathers thought there were 7 gradations
in heaven and that the highest place was with the father
in the 8th.
In the Jewish scriptures, 8 is associated with salvation,
purification, and cleansing. There were 8 persons saved in
Noah's ark; circumcision took place on the 8th day; 8 days
were required for the purification of women. The Feast
of Tabernacles was on the 8th day. Eight is connected with
the Chinese tradition of the Deluge and is an important
number in their cosmogony. It is called the little holy
number.
9. Is the first square of an odd number (3 x 3) and
sometimes appears as a ratio of a mystic 3 times 3. It is
THE SYMBOLIC MEANING OF NUMBERS 245
associated with failure and shortcomings because it falls one
short of the perfect number 10. It is looked upon as an evil
number because it is an inverted 6.
In the Eleusinian Mysteries it was the number of the
sphere through which the consciousness passed on its way
to birth. It is the number of the ruling and controlling
government of God, and the number of man because of the
9 months of his embryonic life. It is also deemed the limit-
less number because there is nothing beyond it but the
infinite 10, and it is identified with the ocean and horizon
because they are boundless.
10. Completes the symbolic alphabet of numbers and
denotes completeness and finality. Pythagoras considered it
"the perfect number". It represents the deity, man, and
the universe because it contains the sum of the 4 prime
numbers, includes all mathematical and musical proportions
and defines the system of the world.
The Decad is called both heaven and the world because
the former includes the latter. It was used by Pythagoreans
to denote things concerning age, power, faith, and neces-
sity and was considered unwearied because it was tireless.
The Pythagoreans divided the heavenly bodies into 10
orders.
The Iota, "Jot" or Yod is the 10th letter in the Hebrew
alphabet and is sometimes used as a symbol of Jahveh. It
is the first letter of the name of Jesus, therefore the num-
ber and letter were his sacred symbols. The symbolic use
of this letter may be observed in the Apostolic Constitution
(Ante-Nicene Lib., p. 58): "Thou hast known the Decade
and hast believed in the Iota, the first letter of the name
of Jesus". The letter X, which stands for Christ, represents,
in the Greek alphabet, the number 600, the number of years
in the reign of each Avatar or Savior in India.
Many of the early fathers of the Christian Church be-
lieved that numbers were frequently used in the Bible in
a symbolic or esoteric sense. Jerome observed that in the
Old Testament the number of Books according to the Jewish
divisions (5 Books of the Law: 8 Books of the Prophets: 9
Books of the Hagiographa) equaled exactly the 22 letters of
the Hebrew alphabet. There are 5 double letters in the
Hebrew alphabet and there are 5 double Books in the Bible,
namely 2 Samuels, 2 Kings, 2 Chronicles, 2 Ezras (which
246 SYMBOLS, SEX, AND THE STARS
we call Ezra and Nehemiah), and 2 Jeremiahs (which we
call Jeremiah and Lamentations).
The fact that part of the Book of Proverbs (Chapter
31: 10,31), the whole of Lamentations and Psalms 25, 34,
37, 111, 112, and 155 are acrostics founded on the Hebrew
alphabet led Jerome to suppose that there was some mys-
tery in the 22 letters from which are formed all of the
words connected with the Scriptures.
.The Jews always considered their alphabet to be a
divine invention and much significance was seen in the
fact that there were 22 generations from Adam to Jacob:
in the first 6 days of the world there were 22 acts of cre-
ation (Book of Jubilees 2:2,22), and observance of the
Sabbath began at the close of the twenty-second generation.
XVII
THE SYMBOLIC MEANING OF NUMBERS
(Continued)
Cabala*
THE MOST EXTENSIVE mystical and symbolical use of num-
bers is to be found in the system of Scriptural interpretation
known as the Cabala. In a branch of the Cabala called
Gematria the numerical equivalents of letters are asserted
to reveal a hidden meaning in the Biblical text. For
instance, if the second word of Genesis, be added to the
first, the result is 1116 which is equivalent to the numerical
value of the Hebrew words "In the beginning of the year
it was created". This is interpreted as meaning that the
world was created in the beginning of the year, or in
autumn. Again, in the first and last verses of the Jewish
Bible the letter Aleph (A) appears 6 times and Cabalists
interpret this as meaning that the beginning and end of
the world will embrace a period of 6000 years.
Despite the obvious weakness of this method of inter-
pretation, the Cabala was in great vogue among European
scholars during and after the Middle Ages, and Raymond
Lully, Pico della Mirandola, John Reuchlin, Guillaume Pos-
tel, Athanasius Kircher, Paul Ricci, Rev. Francis Buddaeus,
the Rosicrucians, Rev. John Lightfoot, Baron von Rosen-
roth, and many others declared that it had been handed
down by the patriarchs.
Paracelsus, Cardinal Nicolas Cusanus, Jacob Bohmen,
Cardinal Aegidus of Viterbo, Pope Sixtus IV, Theophilus
Gale, Ralph Cudworth, Sir Isaac Newton, Spinoza, Schopen-
hauer, Hegel, and Sir Francis Bacon were students of the
Cabala and testified to its validity.
Having been conceived solely as a system of religious
interpretation, the Gematria was originally employed only
with the Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek texts of the Hebrew
Scriptures but by the 17th century it was applied to Latin
texts and even to non-religious subjects. The belief of kings
that they ruled by divine order caused the Gematria to
become, like astrology, a toy of royalty. Cabalistic diagrams
•-See Appendix: Cabala.

were prepared of the names, titles, and important events
in the lives of kings, such as the birth of an heir or the win-
ning of a military campaign, the results being interpreted as
evidence that the king acted under divine guidance.
In recent times, mystics have revived the Cabalistic
system by combining it with the Pythagorean theory of
numbers, and have dressed it up with terms borrowed from
modern science under the name of Numerology. Its ad-
herents would have us believe that all numbers vibrate to
the rhythm of the universe; that each letter of the alphabet
is related to a number, and every condition or quality has
its own peculiar vibration. So, by virtue of the magical power
of Numerology, the man who wishes to be a successful
banker or the girl who wishes to win fame as an actress
must own or adopt a name with a numerical combination
which pulsates in harmony with the proper cosmic vibra-
tions. Of course it is essential that one should know just
what names are in tune with the particular profession or
skill one wishes to pursue. This is where the Numerologists
come in, for they profess to know the answers.
While the Gematria makes use of some of the theories
of Pythagoras, the conditions which led to its development
were at hand with the creation of the alphabet. When the
use of letters superseded hieroglyphics and cuneiform script
in Asia Minor, sometime between 1500 and 1000 B.C., there
were no separate characters for numerals, therefore each
character in the alphabet came in time to represent both a
letter and a number. This made it possible for written texts
to contain two meanings, one an open, literal, alphabetical
meaning, the other a hidden, numerical meaning.

Other circumstances also favored the development of
such a system. Although there were perhaps as many
tongues spoken then as there are today, it is probable that
most languages were sufficiently similar that the people of
one tribe or nation could understand those of another as
well as or better than Portuguese today understand Spaniards
or Chinese understand Japanese.
For instance, the word for Jah or Yah has its equivalent
in le, Ieu, or Ieue, which is similar to the root of the
Greek word law, lao, or Ju-piter. In the Targum* ii is
always used for the creator instead of IEUE. Over the door
of the Greek temple at Delphi the same word EI (written
backward) was inscribed in honor of Apollo.
Ieue Nissi, a Biblical title for God, is cognate with Dios
Nyssos or Dionysius, a title of Bacchus. The Greek letters
IH~ (IHS), the monogram of Bacchus, also came to be
used as a monogram for Jesus. It is widely used in Catholic
churches and monasteries, being claimed by Catholics to
mean Jesus Hominum Salvator or In Hoc Signo. By a
slight change in pronunciation, the Hebrew n becomes n
giving the sound of the Latin or Greek E and IHS becomes
IES which, with a Greek suffix us or ous, becomes Jes-ous.
In Hebrew, Jesse the father of David is written ,tv,
ishi, meaning existence. As written in English it reads Jes
from which was derived Jesse which also becomes Jesus
upon adding the Greek suffix. The feminine form is iltv~
isha, ishshah, or woman, and probably means the same as
the Egyptian name Isi-s.
Grammar was still only partially developed; the spell-
ing of words had not been systemized and each writer de-
veloped his own system of orthography. In some instances
writing was from left to right, in others it was from right
to left as in Hebrew and Arabic. Sometimes writing was
from right to left then back to the right as a farmer plows
a field. In other instances, as in Hebrew, there were no
spaces between words and, in order to make reading less
difficult, when certain sounds appeared at the ends of words,
they were represented by different characters than were
used for the same sounds in the middle of words.
Letters of a certain class or quality were interchange-
able, thus making it possible for a word to have more than
one spelling, more than one meaning and more than one
•-See Appendix: Talmud.
250 .~YMBOLS, SEX, AND THE STABS
numerical value. For instance, the letter Jod may be read
as either 1 or 10 and the letter Shin may stand for either
3 or 300.
The Hebrew letters were not merely abstract designs
but each letter had a secondary significance in addition to
its alphabetical value. Thus the letter i vau, 6, represented
a nail or hook or, in another sense, the womb; while the
letter Jod or Yod \ 10, represented the hand and the phallus.
The letter was also pronounced Ja or Ya as a shortened
form for Yahweh or Jahveh.

The verbal n,n hayah, or eye, means to be, to come
to pass, while . n,n means to live, to make live. The letters
i, j or y in these words are interchangeable with the letter
vau or w and the words may be read as hvh or hih without
change of meaning. The first becomes havah or heva with
a numerical value of 565 and the second becomes chavah
or ch-v-e, 865, the 2 forms being so similar in meaning that
the words may be used interchangeably. The first literally
means Eva while, as a substantive, the second means mother
and is, in fact, the proper name given in Genesis to Eve,
the mother of all being. The deity name J'havah is a com-
.pound of , or Jah and hevia, evah or hevah, thus the
word Jah-evah or Jah-eve has the primary significance of
hermaphroditic existence as male-female.
Apply the methods of the Gematria to a Biblical passage
of which the meaning seems to be strange or mysterious,
such as Genesis 49:11; "He washed his garment in wine". The
Cabalist interprets this passage as follows: The word wine
has a numerical value of 70 and the word sod, meaning mys-
tery, has the same value. This is taken to mean that Judah
was clothed in the Sacred Mysteries, meaning Wisdom or
the Law. This entire chapter of Genesis is evidently aym-
THE SYMBOLIC MEANING OF. NUMBERS 251
bolical rather than historical. The description of Jacob's
sons is really a description of the 12 signs of the zodiac and,
in fact, the entire account of Jacob's life is filled with
incidents which, apparently, must be interpreted as myth-
ical or symbolical. The phrase "until Shiloh come" (49:10)
is sometimes interpreted as referring to the coming of the
Messiah and it is pointed out that the numerical value of
Shiloh, 345, added to "I AM THAT I AM'', 543, gives 888,
the number of Jesus, (IHSOUS-888).
This example would be much more successful, however,
if the words Messiah and Shiloh had the same numerical
values, but the number for Messiah is 355 or 358.
The Hebrew spelling for the word meaning fish is fil
or Nun, which has a numerical value of 565. Nun, the
mother of Joshua (meaning savior), is therefore equal in
numerical value to, and consequently identical with, Eve,
the woman or hovah, the feminine part of Jahveh.
Place the numerals over mi, the Hebrew word for
dove, John, or Jonah, and they read 5-50-6-10, which figures
when added total 71, an important mystic number. In the
description of the Flood this word is mentioned five times,
which makes three hundred fifty-five (71 x 5), the number
of days in the lunar year. Ten is associated with Jahveh;
six is the number of creation and the five is composed of
2 x 3, that is the first male and female. Divide thirty by
the numbers 10-5-6-5 successively and it produces 365-6 or
365 days 6 hours, the length of the solar year.
The ineffable Tetragrammaton which the Jews used
for YHVH, or 10-5-6-5, adds to 26, the sacred number of
Yahveh. In the Cabalistic Tree of Life (See Appendix),
the Sephiroth in the central pillar total 26, i.e., 1 + 6 +
9 + 10 = 26. When placed in pyramidal form, the sacred
monogram produces 72, the great number of God.

Add the numbers 1 to 12 inclusive and the sum is 78.

252 SYMBOLS, SEX, AND THE STARS
by the Egyptians to Isis, by the Greeks and Romans to
Zeus and Jupiter and by the Jews to Jahveh. This sum
is also 13 times 6, the number of the Great Mother.
Manoah, the father of Samson, a mythical solar hero,
has a numerical value of 104 which is 4 times 26, the
number of Jahveh. The name Solomon contains three dif-
ferent titles of the sun (Sol-Om-On), the three syllables
probably representing the sun in the morning, at noon, and
at sunset. The name of the Babylonian king Shalmanesar
breaks down to Shalmanu-Sar which was an epithet applied
to the sun god Bel and is equivalent in meaning to the
Hebrew name Solomon. The Jews turned Shalmanu-Sar into
Sar-Shalom, or prince of peace.
The Hebrew word Shalom or Salem, is equivalent to
"Sal-aam", an Oriental word of greeting which originated
as a designation of the sun god. Each syllable of the
Biblical name Om-On-Al or Emanuel also contains a title
of the sun and the word probably originated in the same
manner as the name Solomon.
The first sentence in the Bible reads· "In the beginning
God created the heavens and earth". In Hebrew it reads
B'Rashith and is really two words in one, the B being a par-
ticiple meaning by. Both as a word and as a number the
first word may be interpreted as meaning Wisdom, the
first Sephira of the Cabala. Many Cabalists have contended
that this was the true meaning of the word and have
pointed out that it is the interpretation used by the Targum
of Jerusalem. By this interpretation the first sentence
should read "By wisdom" and not "In the beginning" God
created the heavens and earth.
In the same chapter of Genesis the word which trans-
lators have interpreted as God or Jehovah reads c~n;N
Aleim, or as modern Jews prefer to pronounce it, Elohim.
El is both Lord and a primitive title of the sun, being of
the same meaning and origin as the Arabic word Al in Al-lah.
The value of the letters for Yahweh (JHV) in the
Pathagoras triangle is 543. This is also the number of Moses
and for Al Shaddai (AL ShDI), one of the titles of God.
The name by which God designated himself in Exodus 3:14
is AHIH ASHR AHIH or "I AM THAT I AM" the value
of which is 543, or the reverse of 345. The numbers 345
and 543 may therefore be read as meaning JHVH.

31 and the addition of he makes the value 36. Further, the

portion or the relation of a circle's diameter to its circum-
ference and identifies the word Elohim with the circle or
female quality. (Plate 72).

the Eye of Horus, aur or Hor, meaning light and typifying
the sun. The Egyptians called the 3 sides of the triangle
Isis, Osiris, and Horus and the. 3 letters IOH or JVH which
they applied to the triangle were the secret .formula which
contained a key to the universe. According to one of its
interpretations, the 3-4-5 form symbolized the 3 components
of all existence, 3 representing infinite spirit, 4 representing
infinite matter, and 5 being spirit and matter manifested in
material form.
According to the Cabala, each manifestation of God is
divided into 3 principal phases which form the bases of the
3 triads of Sephiroth in the Cabalistic Tree of Life. In one
sense, matter is divided into gases, liquids, and solids and,
in another sense, the essence of existence is derived from
the 3 elements ·air, fire, and water (earth is believed to be
derived from water, therefore is not counted). This is
revealed in the first verse of the Bible where the word
Aeshmim (heavens) contains the 3 mother letters; ·Aleph
representing air; Shin representing :fire and Mem repre-
senting water. Again, the 3 branches of the letter Shin
symbolize the 3 phases of light or divine fire.
Square the figures 3, 4, and 5 and they produce 9, 16,
and 25 which add to 50, the number of Admh or Adam. If
a 3 x 4 rectangle be divided by a diagonal line eac:P, half
will be a 3-4-5 triangle. Divide the 3 x 4 shape vertically
into 3 parts and draw a diagonal for one of the sections
and its angle will be approximately 231h degrees, (See
Plate 74) which is the angle of the earth's axis to the
ecliptic and further reveals the three divisions of the ma-
terial world. Add 3, 4, and 5 and they produce 12, the
number of months in the year and the divisions of the
zodiac.
After drawing the diagonal of a 3 x 4 rectangle,
draw a second diagonal from a corner to the intersection
of the first diagonal and it produces 3 triangles, the areas
of which are in the proportion of 3, 4, and 5. The angle
of the second diagonal is 52 degrees, being almost exactly
the same as the. slope of the Great Pyramid. Bisection of the
3 x 4 form was believed to provide a key to the solution
of the ancient problem of squaring a circle. A triangle of
3 x 4 x 3 gives the basis for constructing. a square and
circle of approximately equal area and a 4 x 5 x 4 triangle

gives the proportions for making a square and circle of
approximately equal circumference. (Plates 75 and 76).
To the Cabalist, a series of significant relations is also
exhibited by the sides of a cube. The cube of 6 equals 216
(6 x 6 x 6) which is also the number of DBIR (debir)
the holy of holies in the tabernacle and in the temple.
According to ancient traditions, the cube was the proper
form for the abode of the Holy Spirit and some of the ancient
stone idols of the gods were in the form of a cube. In the
Babylonian Deluge myth, the ark was built in the form of
a cube and in Revelations 21 the New Jerusalem is to be
a cube of 12000 furlongs.
. Again, the cube of 6 is equal to the cubes, of 3, 4, and
5, that is the cube of 3 = 27 (3 x 3 x 3); the cube of 4 = 64
(4 x 4 x 4) and the cube of 5 = 125 (5 x 5 x 5) which
add to a total of 216.
If the 6 sides of a cube are unfolded, they will appear
as a cross or tau form. The center square combines with
both the vertical and horizontal bars, hence the horizontal
counts as 3 and the vertical as 4, giving another important
combination of spirit (3) and matter (4) .
. The Cabala does not appear to have been ·linked,
originally, with geometry; but, as the following examples
show, modern Cabalists have devoted much effort to trying
to invent symbolic and Cabalistic interpretations of various
geometrical forms.
The proportions of a 5 x 8 rectangle (5 + 8 + 5 + 8)
produce the YHVH number, 26. This rectangle will en-
close a triangle which gives almost exactly the proportions
of the Great Pyramid and the angle of the slope of its
sides.1 Another geometrical form of much symbolic import
is the trapezoid in the proportions of 10 + 5 + 6 + 5 which
again total 26. The angle of the tapered ends is approxi-
mately 231h degrees, or the angle of the earth's axis to
the eliptic.
Change the proportions of the trapezoid to 10 + 10 +
10 + 6 and the diagonals produce the angle of the slope of
the pyramid; the dimensions add to 36, the number of the
sun, and the over-all shape is the same as that of the
Masonic keystone.
1-The exact angle of the sides of the triangle is 52°: the angle of
the sides of tl'ie pyramid is 51° 52'.

The mention of Peter having caught 153 fishes (John
21:11) has often been thought to be of secret significance,
therefore this number has been a popular one with Cab-
alists. Hundreds of Cabalistic formulae have been devised
for producing this number from Biblical words and verses,
a few of which are here given as examples.
THE SYMBOLIC MEANING OF NUMBERS 259
In Greek the word IXE9Yl: meaning fishes has a
numerical value of 1224, or 8 times 153. The name of the
:fisherman, Simeon Peter (in Hebrew, Shimeon Jonah) gives
the number 153. The phrase Beni ha Elohim ("sons of
God") equals 153. The number for the phrase "The seed
of Jacob" is 459, or 3 times 153. The words "house of
Israel, my people" (Ezek. 34:30), in Greek, total 1530 or
10 times 153.
One of the many names applied to Christians in early
Rome was Pisiculi, or Little Fishes, and the fish symbol
in the form of either a single fish or of 2 fishes has been
found scratched or drawn in many places on the walls of
the catacombs.
In the eighth book of the Sibylline Oracles, which ap-
peared in Rome during the first century B.C., the first
words, reading Jesous Xristos Theos Oios Soter formed an
acrostic in which the initial Greek letters IXTOS (fishes)
were thought to prophesy the coming of Christ.
Maria, the Greek name for Christ's mother, has a
numerical value of 152. The numerals 1, 5, and 2 may be
transposed so as to form 888, the number of Christ, when
added either vertically or horizontally, thus

260 SYMBOLS, SEX, AND THE STARS
"he is Anti-God" has the value of 666. Rev. Walter Begley
has published more than 100 examples containing this
number, most of them being from the Latin.2
The sum of all numbers from 1 to 36 added together
is also 666, the grand number of the sun. The Hebrew
name for the sun is Shamash, the number of which is 640.
Add 26, the number of YHVH and it gives 666. This is
also the numerical value of Shechem Bar Hamor, the
seducer of Dinah in Gen. 34:2. By one interpretation this
act foreshadowed the seduction of Israel by Anti-Christ.
The numerical value of Shechem is 360 and that of Ben
Hamor is 306, thus giving the same number, when added,
as is given by the 2 words Nero Caesar, who has been
thought by many writers to be "the Beast" referred to.
While the controversy between the Luther~ns and the
Roman Church was at white heat, the Lutherans formed
many Cabalistic combinations on the Beast number which
were directed at the Popes, such as the following one given
by Rev. Begley: Id Bestia Leo = 666.
By Gematria, the slave or concubine offspring of Leah
and Rachel also add to 666.

In the phrase "I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning
and the end", the first letter of the Greek alphabet has a
value of 1 and the value of Omega is 800, or a total of 801,
the number of Salvation. The name ADoNAY totals 65.
When added to 26, the JHVH number, it gives 91 which
is the equivalent of Amen 91.
If space permitted, a great number of curious and
even surprising Cabalistic combinations could be given
but the examples shown are sufficient to demonstrate the
arbitrary and unscientific nature of the system.
In order to prove that the Bible is a symbolic, esoteric
work of divine origin, the Cabalist takes the numerical value
of a word or phrase then looks for another word or phrase
2---Biblia Cabalistica, Rev. Walter Begley, London, 1903, p. 119.
THE SYMBOLIC MEANING OF NUMBERS 261
with the same value. But when this has been accomplished,
no hidden secrets have been revealed and any new meaning
that may be derived from the text will be completely de-
pendent upon such arbitrary conclusions as the Cabalist
chooses to draw from it. All the system proves is that two
or more words or phrases may have the same numerical
value. It is not only possible, however, to find a correlative
for practically any word or phrase in the Bible: in some
cases many correlatives may be found, including some
whose associations are utterly dissimilar and unrelated in
any conceivable way. For instance, the Hebrew word ro'ah
meaning evil is spelled exactly the same as the word friend
and presumably this would signify to the Cabalist that
friends are evil. CHYShM, Messiah, has a value of 358 and
ShChN, Nachash, meaning serpent, has the same value.
The ability of the Gematria to cut both ways like a
sword is unintentionally demonstrated by the . Zahar. It
describes an incident in which a certain Ramma bar
Chamma was asked why it was that Satan could not accuse
people on the day of Atonement and the Ramma replied
that the number of Satan (NTShH-ha, Shatan) was 364
therefore he could accuse people on 364 days of the year
but on Atonement, the 365th day, the devil could not accuse.
Had the Ramma carried his reasoning a trifle farther, he
would have seen that JHVH Adonai, a title of God, has a
value of 91 which, when multiplied by 4, gives the same
number as Satan, that is, 364. In fact, according to the
Cabala, God and Satan can be proven even more decisively
to be one and the aame for the very word God has a value
of 364 (GUD = 3 + 6 + 4).
The fact that the pretensions of the Cabalists can be
refuted by such simple demonstrations makes one wonder
how Sir Isaac Newton, Bacon, Spinoza and many other bril-
liant scholars and scientists could have found merit in what
is obviously so utterly fallacious. But, history has often
shown that when brilliant men dabble in mysticism their
critical faculties become numbed and they cease to reason
objectively. Being desirous of confirming their religious
beliefs, they give undue importance to all favorable evidence
and minimize, or ignore, anything to the contrary, with
the result that they sometimes fall victims to nonsense which
should be apparent as such to even ordinary minds.
262 SYMBOLS, SEX, AND THE STARS
Before leaving this subject, some mention should be
made concerning significant developments in Cabalistic re-
search which have occurred within recent years through
the discovery of many peculiar relations in the proportions
of geometrical figures. Some of these developments are of
genuine mathematical interest and had they not been linked
with Cabalism, probably would have received more serious
attention.
The first discovery was made by John A. Parker, a
New York mathematician who found a more perfect relation
between the diameter and circumference of a circle, the
proportions being 6561 for diameter and 20612 for circum-
ference. Later, it was learned that Peter Metius, a Dutch-
man, had, in 1585, discovered a slightly less perfect relation
of 113 for diameter and 355 for circumference.
The fact that these 2 sets of figures were equivalent
to the numerical value of certain Biblical words and the
further belief that the figures were related to the archi-
•tectural proportions of the pyramid, gave rise to a theory
that these geometrical phenomena were not accidental but
were the result of divine laws inherent in the structure of
the universe. This coincidence, it was thought, was con-
clusive proof that the Bible and the systems of letters and
numbers are of divine origin, intended by the Great Archi-
tect of the universe to reveal to those worthy of the
knowledge, the physical structure of man and the universe.8
Omitting the Cabalistic references for the moment, the
theory is based upon the following proposition: If the length
of the side of a square is 81 inches, feet or other units, the
area will be 6561 (81 x 81). This sum is equal to 9 x 9 x
9 x 9 and the figure 9 and its multiples are the basis of
the calculations. (Reverse 6561 and it gives 1656, the
number of years from Creation to the Flood). A circle of
the same diameter will have an area of 5153.
By the Pythagorean formula, the circumference of a
circle is equal to 3.1415 times its diameter, expressed Pi x
Diam. = Circumference. Therefore, a circle which has a
diameter of 6561 will have a circumference of 20612 (6561 x
3.14159 = 20612). Multiplying the area of a circle by 4 will
give the same product as multiplying the diameter of the
circle by 3.14159.

If the letter Jod, 10, is taken as the radius of a circle,
the circumference will equal (approximately) the circum-
ference of a square measuring 16 on each side. The 16 is
equal to 5 + 6 + 5, being equivalent to Ha-Va-Ha (HVH),
Havvah or Eve.
If the length of the side of a square is 81, its diagonal
will be 114.591498, which figure is equal to the diameter
of a circle with a circumference of 360. In other words, the
diagonal of the square of 81 is a proportional between
values of circumference and diameter of the circle.
Divide 114.5914 by 2 and the product is 57.2957499.
Take a circle of any size and draw an arc within it which
is equal to the radius of the circle. The angle of the arc
will always be 57.2957499 degrees.
Again, the perpendicular of an equilateral triangle
whose sides are 81 will be the same as· the side of an
equilateral triangle within a circle whose diameter is 81.
Now, let's see how these mathematical relations were
applied to the Cabala. Omitting ciphers and reading from
right to left, the letters of the Hebrew word aish (man}
are 113: when read from left to right and including ciphers
the word has a value of 311. This is also the value of the
Hebrew words the woman, (h-aish) 5-1-300-5 (or, if re-
versed, 5-300-1-5), so that numerically, 311 may be read
as either man or the woman, while 113 is man. (If the
355 days of the Hebrew lunar year be considered as a circle,
its diameter will be 113). The term stands 113-311, which
264 SYMBOLS, SEX, AND THE S'l'ARS
reads either way. But the term aish is a form of Adam
(1 + 4 + 40) or 144, which may be read as 144-441.
Omitting the article h, 5, gives the figure 531-135;
woman as 135 and its reverse 531. Thus, there are 3 forms,
all connected under the name of man, the woman and
Adam which can be placed as
311-113
441-144
531-135.
Adam and woman joined give the figure 531-441 while
adding the numbers of the woman, 531 and 135 produces
the famous number 666.
A square, the side of which is 81 will, when cubed, give
the figure 531441 (81 x 81 = 6561 x 81 = 531441). The solid
content of a sphere with a diameter of 81 may be found as
follows. One-sixth of 3.14159+6 (.5235990448) multiplied by
the cube of 81 (531441). 531441 x .5235990448 makes 278262
which is precisely the same as 20612 x 135, the number of
woman. (Convert this to a time equation and it gives the
exact length of the lunar month in days, hours, minutes,-
27 days, 8 hrs. 26 min. 2 sec.).
So, while the area changed into a cube becomes 531441,
the solidity of the contained sphere is 20612 x 135 or 278262,
showing a continued integral relation where the solid con-
tent of the sphere is the circumference multiplied by 135,
the solid of the containing cube being expressed by the
reversed form of woman-Adam or 531-441.
This is set forth as showing that there is an integral
relation between the area of a circle inscribed in a square
to the area of that square and between the linear diameter
to circumference of a circle, and it is claimed that this
harmony with many others (size and shape of the Garden
of Paradise, the Flood, the Ark, the temple, the holy of
holies, etc.) proves, according to the geometrical school of
Cabalists that these relations are the true natural ones from
eternity to eternity and are ones on which the Bible is built.
It is further claimed that these mathematical phe-
nomena explain the origin and significance of the great
pyramid of Khufu in Egypt, and a cult of Pyramidists has
sprung up that professes to see in the dimensions of the
pyramid, prophecies of practically every great event in his-
tory, both ancient and modern. The hypotheses have gen-

erally been founded upon the assumption that every line
and angle of the great monument was based upon some
deep fundamental truth or law. (Of course the claim that
the pyramid was constructed by ancient Freemasons and
that it contains many secrets of that fraternity is well
known.)
Deep and important meaning has been read into every
angle and dimension of the pyramid's passages and cham-
bers, including the arrangement of the paneling on the
walls and the stone slabs ·forming the roof of the cham-
bers. The length in inches of certain passages, for instance,
has been claimed to represent a certain number of years in
history: the circumference of the base or of a chamber
has been thought to agree with the exact length of the
day or year. Even the number of stones in the sides of
the base has been thought to possess a deep astrological
and religious significance.
Since Napoleon visited the pyramid during his Egyp-
tian campaign in 1799 a score of scientists have measured
266 SYMBOLS, SEX, AND THE STARS
the length of its sides, its height and angle of slant and
every dimension of its interior chambers and passages. Al-
though it was constructed at least 25 or 30 centuries before
the oldest parts of the Bible were compiled _and is nowhere
mentioned therein, its dimension are thought to be Cabalistic
figures agreeing with and proving the divine origin _of
Cabalistic mysteries in the Bible.
Some enthusiasts have claimed that the pyramid pro-
vides a key to the interpretation of numerous Old Testa-
ment prophecies; the date of the Exodus of the Jews from
Egypt; the birth, death and resurrection of Christ; the
principal events which occurred before, during and after
World War I; the outbreak of World War II and the
events which were to follow.
The relationship of the volume and area of the triangle,
pyramid, square, cube, circle and sphere, it is maintained,
reveal the periods of the revolution of the planets, the
length of the day, month and year, a perfect system of
measures of distance and volume, the distance of the earth
from the sun, and other astronomical facts which are not
supposed to have been known until many centuries after
the pyramid -was built. Furthermore, these values are
claimed to be found in the teachings of the Bible as well
as in the proportions and dimensions of ancient temples
and monuments. ·
The interior and exterior dimensions, by their pro-
portions and relationships, are held to have been designed
to provide for future initiates a secret record of the mathe-
matical relationships between all basic geometrical forms.
CHAPTER XVIII
ASTROLOGY
ASTROLOGY ORIGINATED IN Chaldea (Babylonia) where it
reached a higher state of development than anywhere else
in the ancient world. From Chaldea it spread westward to
Syria and Egypt, and later, by way of Greece and Rome,
to western Europe, where it continued to influence religious
and astronomical speculation for centuries after the great
civilization of Babylonia had ceased to exist.
Up to a hundred years ago practically all of our
knowledge of Babylonian astrology was derived from the
Observations of Bel, consisting of 70 books or parts. After
the invasion of the East by Alexander the Great, these
books were translated by Berossus, a priest of Babylon.
This work has been lost, but excerpts from it have been
preserved in the works of other writers. Tb.ese early frag-
ments of the work of Berossus have been enormously
supplemented by the many discoveries made within the
last century.
Having observed a relation between the positions,
movements, and other aspects of the sun and moon, the
varying length of the days, changes of seasons, periods of
gr<?wth, movement of tides, some primitive peoples be-
lieved that all life and activity on earth were influenced or
controlled by these heavenly bodies, which were personified
as deities.
This belief led almost inevitably to the development
of astrology, or the art of foretelling events by the positions
and movements of the stars. As the phases of the heavenly
bodies were believed ·to be related to events on earth, it
was thought a knowledge of these phenomena would reveal
the moods, humors, and actions of the ruling deities and
make possible the foretelling of events.
Babylonian astrology was based upon the belief that
the earth is but a small scale counterpart of the heavens.
Everything that exists or occurs in the heavens was be-
lieved to be duplicated in the objects and events on earth.
Each part of the heavens was thought to be related
to a corresponding part of the habitable world. Part of the
267
268 SYMBOLS, SEX, AND THE STARS
labor of Marduk, in the Creation Myth, was to divide the
heavens and to place stars and constellations in the various
divisions to represent each city or country of the known
world. Signs seen in a certain part of the sky were sig-
nificant for a special city or nation. The most important
factors in this attempt to foretell the future were the sun,
moon, and 5 inferior planets; the zodiac, meteors, comets,
and meteorological conditions. Almost all the signs of the
zodiac must have been arranged in approximately their
present position by 2800 B.C., and some of the constellations
had probably been determined by 5000 B.C.
The planets were believed to be deities, or temples in
which the deities resided, and man-made temples on earth
were regarded as copies of their heavenly prototypes.
Prayers might be addressed to the deities in their earthly
temples and communications might be received from their
celestial temples by one who was competent to interpret
the signs. The very name of Babylon (bab-ilu, gate of the
gods) denotes a city copied from the heavenly model.
The most· important yearly event was the 11-day fes-
tival held at the beginning of the year when the gods
assembled in the great Hall of Fates in Babylon to assist
the supreme god Marduk in deciding the fates of men for
the ensuing year. Associated with Marduk were the gods
Shamash, Sin, Ishtar, Nabu, Ninurta, and Adad, who had
been supreme in various cities before the ascendency of
Babylon. This council of gods determined the future weal
or woe of kings and states. Each of the council members
represented some special characteristic and the complete
council was merely a thinly disguised representation of
Marduk in his various manifestations. During this period
of Babylon's greatest glory, astrology was employed only
for religious purposes or by the king for affairs of state.
There was no thought of separating astronomy and astrol-
ogy from religion because they were essential parts of the
religious system.
The city of Babylon itself was laid out in 7 concentric
squares in imitation of the supposed disposition of the
planets about the earth. According to Herodotus, the wall
about the city was 360 furlongs in length, corresponding
to the number of days in the ancient astrological year, al-
though, according to Ctesias, the wall was later lengthened
to 480 furlongs in order to equal that of Nineveh.
ASTROLOGY 269
Observations of the heavens were made from the tops
of ziggurats, or towers with external stairways. At Borsippa,
across the river from Babylon, Sir Henry Rawlinson dis-
covered, in 1845, the ruins of a square 7-storied ziggurat
of Nabu, 272 feet square and 140 feet high. Its antiquity
is revealed by the fact that it was in ruins in the seventh
century, B.C., during the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, who
restored it. The lowest stage was colored black, for the
plariet Saturn; the 2nd orange, for Jupiter; the 3d red, for
Mars; the 4th gold, for the sun; the 5th white, for Venus;
the 6th dark blue, for Mercury; and the 7th was silver-tinted,
for the moon.
Some of the Chaldean ziggurats contained 8 stories, the
upper one being dedicated to the supreme god and equipped
for his occupancy when he visited the earth. There he had
his golden altar, furniture, treasures, and a model of his
sacred boat. The only human visitor to this temple, accord-
ing to Herodotus, was a virgin selected as the earthly con-
sort of the deity and who climbed the winding passageway
to the temple each evening to await the coming of the
heavenly visitor.
The duty of reading the intentions· of the gods and
predicting events was assigned to the priesthood, which
consisted of a distinct and important hereditary class, con-
stituting a sort of Freemasonry each member of which was
required to be free from any physical blemish or imper-
fection, and to pursue a prescribed course of study. Their
duties included the recitation of prayers, the presenting
of offerings, writing music for the temple ceremonies,
and making prophecies. They were also the astronomers,
dividers of space and time, as well as the architects and
builders of the temples, which were carefully oriented to
the regions of the earth and designed in imitation of the
supposed likenesses of the temples in the heavens.
In time the court which surrounded the temple became
the financial center where priests, acting as lawyers and
bankers, loaned money at exorbitant rates, acted as
public scribes in drawing up and notarizing contracts and
deeds and arranging for the barter and sale of all kinds
of merchandise.
Forewarnings of such catastrophies as floods, famines,
or military defeats enabled the rulers either to make prepa-
rations to avoid them or by prayers, gifts, and sacrifices to
270 SYMBOLS, SEX, AND THE STARS
wheedle and flatter the gods into changing their plans. For
the priests it was a heads-I-win-tails-you-lose system in which
no war or other important undertaking was initiated until
the good will of the gods had been determined by astrology
and insured by the offering of gifts and prayers to the
temple gods. If disaster followed, however, it was accepted
as evidence that the gods were extremely angry, and that
more prayers and greater gifts were necessary. It was, there-
fore, to the interest of the priests to maintain the belief
that all phenomena on earth were under the ruling power
of the deities, whose wills and actions they, the priests,
could reveal.
In addition to astrology, the priesthood employed nu-
merous less important methods of divination. These in-
cluded the interpretation of dreams and the forecasting of
events from the actions and movements of birds and animals,
from the appearance of misbirths in humans and animals,
from the configuration of the liver of a sacrificed ox or
sheep, and from the pattern made by drops of oil floated
on water in a divining bowl. It was with such a divining
bowl or cup that Joseph amazed the Pharaoh of Egypt, and
statements in the Bible indicate that liver divination was
not unknown to Moses. 1
Their exclusive possession of all astronomical knowl-
edge and their position as intercessors with the gods enabled
the priests to command vast wealth and power which even
the king was bound to respect. To maintain their power,
they jealously guarded their knowledge and handed it down
from generation to generation to only a small group of
initiates. A tablet in Assurbanipal's library reads: "The
wise shall teach it to the wise: The unlearned shall not
see it."
The term "Chaldean" itself denoted a priest, a tribe, or
a prophet. In Greece, where astrology was later practiced,
the term denoted a tribe or mathematician and, eventually,
a charlatan. Our word "magician" comes from Magi,
meaning priest or worker in magic.
In the earlier period, astrology was almost entirely
empirical; astrologers were not yet able to predict celestial
phenomena accurately and reckonings of the moon's phases
1-Exod. 29:13,22 and Lev. 3:4,10,15; 7:4.
ASTROLOGY 271
show that positions of the sun and moon were not fully
understood.
The use of mathematics in astrological calculations
began about the eighth century B.C. Thereafter, knowl-
edge .of astronomy advanced rapidly and records of that
period reveal notations concerning· the spring equinox, new
moon, eclipses, positions of the planets, and the rising of
the fixed stars. The first eclipses observed in Babylonia,
and mentioned in the Almagest, are from 721 to 720 B.C.
In the fourth century, the Saros or 19-year cycle
was discovered and in the third century, Kiddinu, the
greatest of Babylonian astronomers, discovered the preces-
sion of the equinoxes; and the year, day, and hour of eclipses
were predicted, the precise extent of the eclipse being given.
About 200 B.C., Kiddinu constructed tables of great
accuracy, giving positions of the stars. In this work he
utilized a vast collection of observations which were said to
have been gathered over thousands of years. These records
were intended as reference works for reading the fate of
men and the determination of the favorable moment for
beginning new ventures. To ascertain the significance of
any celestial phenomenon, particularly in later times when
the archives had become extensive, it was necessary only
to consult the records and to observe what formerly followed
a similar phenomenon. But, despite the numerous records
and the elaborate methods employed, the ability to foretell
events on earth failed to keep pace with the great progress
made in determining the movements and cycles of the stars.
Comprehensive studies of the correspondences between
individuals and celestial bodies were made at birth and
calculations were drawn from the configuration of the stars
at the time. The calculations were usually based upon many
arbitrary or immaterial correspondences between the planets
and the lives of the persons for whom they were made.
Thus, the approach of Mars to Scorpio was an omen that
a prince would die from the sting of a scorpion.
When a certain event on earth had followed a certain
phenomenon in the heavens, a similar earthly event was
expected to recur at the same time in the following heavenly
cycle. Therefore, because eclipses had occurred on certain
days of the month, or becm,1se a change in.the moon's phase
seemed to augur good or evil on several occasions, some
272 SYMBOLS, SEX, AND THE STARS
days were declared propitious for certain pursuits; others,
unpropitious. The appearance of the new moon earlier than
expected was regarded as an unfavorable omen, indicative
in one case of defeat, in another of death among the cattle,
on the theory that anything that occurred prematurely was
an augury of an unfavorable event.
After beginning as a mere adjunct of astrology, astron-
omy finally emerged as a science in its own right. While
the fame and prestige of the priests as astronomers were
greatly enhanced by developments in mathematics which
made it possible to predict eclipses, conjunctions, and the
positions of the stars and planets with considerable accuracy,
these same developments eventually led to the discrediting
of astrology.
From its very beginning, astrology had thrived on the
belief that affairs on earth took place in a haphazard manner
at the whims of gods who could be cajoled into withdrawing
their harmful decrees. But when it became evident that
such appeals were useless; that the movements of the sun,
the moon, and the planets followed certain definite and in-
exorable laws regardless of the appeals of priests to their
gods, and that these movements could be predicted with
accuracy, there was no longer any reason to bribe the
deities with gifts and flatter them with prayers.
The first real triumph of scientific astronomy over the
mumbo-jumbo astrology of the priests occurred in 601 B.C.,
when, for the first time in history, Thales, a Greek philoso-
pher, successfully predicted an eclipse. This was the open-
ing contest in the war between science and "revealed" super-
naturalism. Soon afterward astrology was undermined from
another direction. In 539 B.C. the Persian King Cyrus cap-
tured Babylon and spread the Zoroastrian doctrine of one
Supreme God who ruled by an infinite law of compensation.
In the new system there was no place for vengeful, jealous
deities who ruled by caprice.
As the power of the astrologers declined in Babylonia,
their reputation increased in the West. About this time
the Greeks began to penetrate the East and the fame of
Babylonian astronomy and astrology was soon carried back
to Greece, whence it spread over all of Europe.
Greek astrology is first mentioned in the Prometheus
Vinctus by Aeschylus, 525-465 B.C., after which the Greeks
ASTROLOGY 273
showed an increased interest in, and knowledge of heavenly
phenomena. Further impetus was given to Greek astrology
in the fourth century by the conquest of the East by Alex-
ander the Great, at whose request Berossus translated the
Babylonian astrological texts. Although astrology never
achieved the popularity in Greece which it formerly had
held in Babylonia, the Greek astrologers enlarged its scope
until they had brought practically all of the known sciences
under its influence and had given it substantially the form
it has today.
Unlike the Babylonian system, Greek astrology was
mathematical from the beginning. Furthermore, it was
practiced by laymen instead of priests and was concerned
with the individual, whereas the Babylonian astrologers did
not begin making individual horoscopes until they were
compelled to do so by reduced circumstances, caused by
the disintegration of the nation.
In Rome, astrology was held in high honor and, during
the period of the emperors, the games of the Circus were
an allegory representing the sun, moon, planets, and other
bodies of the heavens. The following description of the
games is from Dupuis:
"The sun had its horses which, on the race course or
hippodrome, imitated the career of the luminary in the
heavens. The Olympic fields were represented by a vast
amphitheater, or arena, which was consecrated to the sun.
In the midst of it there stood the temple of that god which
was surmounted by his image. The East and West, as the
limits of the course of the sun, were traced and marked
by boundaries and placed toward the remotest part of the
Circus. The races took place from east to west until seven
rounds were made, on account of the seven planets. The
sun and moon had their chariots the same as Jupiter and
Venus; the charioteers were dressed in clothes the color of
which was analogous to the hue of the different elements.
"The chariot of the sun was borne by four horses and
that of the moon by two. The zodiac was represented in the
Circus by twelve gates; there were also traced the movements
of the circumpolar stars or of the two Bears.
"Everything was personified in these feasts: the sea, or
Neptune, the earth, or Ceres, and so on, the other planets.
They were represented by actors contending for the Pl'izes.
274 SYMBOLS, SEX, AND 1-'HE S'l'AltS
These contests were instituted, they said, in order to· illus-
trate the harmony of the universe, of heaven, of the earth
and of the sea. The institution of these Games was attrib-
uted to Romulus by the Romans and I believe that they
were an imitation of the races of the Hippodrome of the
Accadians and of the games of Elis".2
In India and China, belief in astrology became ex-
tremely widespread and it still flourishes more in those
countries than anywhere else. From birth to death, the
life of a Hindu or Chinese is guided by the positions of the
planets and even minor activities are postponed unless the
horoscope indicates the time is favorable.
Astrology was extensively practiced in Egypt during
the periods of Greek · and Roman domination. In the
seventh and eighth centuries it was further developed by
the .A,.rabs, who still place great faith in it.
It was largely through the Moors of Spain.that astrology
was introduced into France and other European countries,
where in the 14th and 15th centuries it attained a tre-
mendous vogue. Nearly every ruler had his official as-
trologer; and at the courts of Italy, Spain, France, Germany,
and England it became customary for the members of the
court to take oaths, not in the name of God, but in the
name of the planets. Courses in astrology were given at
the universities of Cracow, Warsaw, Algiers, and Cairo. It
became the fashion for women of high birth to retain a
"baron", who guided their activities by the positions of
the planets.
In the United States, where people proudly proclaim
this age to be one of science and speak disdainfully of
superstitions, there has been a noteworthy revival of inter-
est in astrology during recent years, and many heads of
great industries who are proud of their shrewdness have
become as credulous in accepting the predictions of the
astrologers as have· their housemaids. The publication of
books, magazines, horoscopes, charts and daily newspaper
articles on astrology has become a fairly important busi-
ness. Divining by drops of oil on water has been replaced
by the pretended gypsy who reads fortunes in tea leaves
or coffee grounds. If some enterprising person will begin

making predictions from sheep livers, we will be able to
foretell the future as well as the Babylonians did.
Interpreting the Zodiac
Inasmuch as astrology was based upon the relative
positions of the sun, moon, the 5 planets (Mars, Mercury,
Venus, Jupiter, and Saturn), and certain constellations of
fixed stars, it was essential for the astrologers to be able to
determine the positions of these bodies at all times. There-
fore, the heavens were divided into 12 sections, each iden-
tified by a constellation of fixed stars, whose order of
appearance in the sky is marked in the chart called the
zodiac.
Present day star maps show approximately 120 con-
stellations, many of which have been mapped by astrono-
mers within recent centuries. The Greeks had 48 constella-
tions and the Babylonians had even more, but only 12 of
these are of astrological significance; therefore all others
will here be ignored.
The Babylonians, Chinese, Hindus, Ceylonese, Egyp-
tians, Arabians, and Persians also had lunar zodiacs which,
in certain cases, originally contained 27 signs but were later
increased to 28. These divisions corresponded to the course
of the moon; the 27 or 28 lunar stages were used in ob-
serving the stars surrounding the Pole Star when they cross
the meridian. During the period when the sun was in the
sign of Taurus, the rising of the star Aldebran in Taurus
and the setting of Antares in Scorpio, at the spring equinox,
provided a means of dividing the heavens into 28 moon
stations; 14 in the Overworld and 14 in the Underworld.
Because of the daily rotation of the earth on its axis,
every part of the globe is turned toward the heavens every
24 hours. Of course this does not imply that all constel-
lations may be seen from any part of the earth during that
time because the stars which are overhead in the daytime
are rendered invisible by the sun.
If we were to observe the heavens every evening, always
at the same hour, we would see a new zodiacal constellation
appear above the eastern horizon each month. At the same
hour, 90 days later, this constellation would have risen 90
degrees, to appear on the meridian. At the end of another
3 months it ·would have disappeared below the western
276 SYMBOLS, SEX, AND THE STARS
horizon, not to be seen again until 6 months later. This
statement applies to all stars in the northern hemisphere
except the stars which are near the Polar Star and are
visible throughout the year. Because of the earth's daily
rotation, these stars seem to move around the Pole every
24 hours.
A few bright stars seem to run counter to this orderly
process. They do not retain their relative positions in the
sky with respect to each other or to fixed stars: some of
them change positions greatly from day to day; others move
more slowly. These are the planets, or wandering "stars".
The constellations of the zodiac (path of the sun) lie
in what is known as the "ecliptic", a belt in the heavens
about 16 degrees wide, marking the path of the earth, or,
as it appears to us, the path of the sun.
With the exception of the Balance (Libra) all the signs
of the zodiac are named after real or imaginary animals.
The relation, however, is purely mythological or allegorical,
as not one of the star groups suggests by its shape the
animal for which it is named.
Although the zodiac divides the heavens into 12 equal
parts, the constellations representing the various signs are
not equally spaced nor are they of the same size. Some are
crowded together; others are very much spread out. For
instance, Leo, Taurus, Pisces, and the Virgin occupy 36 to
48 degrees in the heavens whereas Cancer, Aries, and Capri-
corn occupy from 19 to 23 degrees. The reason for these
variations is that the zodiac was not charted or devised
during one period, but, like Topsy, "just growed" over a
period of some two or three thousand years.
When a constellation rises with the sun, the sun is said
to be in that zodiacal sign. The 12 signs, therefore, cor-
respond to the 12 constellations which were regarded as
"houses" or "mansions" occupied by the sun in its travels
during the 12 months of the year. This correspondence is
made clear in the Babylonian calendar, the names of the
12 months being the names ·of the 12 signs of the zodiac.
In the astrological period the year began at the vernal
equinox, which occurs about March 21st.
The 12 signs were divided into 2 parts composing 6
favorable signs and 6 unfavorable signs. The first 6 were
those which the sun occupied during the months of warmth,

growth, and fertility. During the Aries age, these were
Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, and Virgo. The 6 un-
favorable signs represented the cold, wet" months, the period
of sterility and death, wl').en the sun was south of the
equator or, allegorically, in the Underworld.
The 12 signs were assigned to the 3 gods Anu, Bel,
and Ea in this order:
Anu ruled over Taurus, Gemini, Cancer and Leo.
Bel " " Virgo, Libra, Scorpio and Sagittarius.
Ea " " Capricorn,. Aquarius, Pisces and Aries.
The last 4·constellations, lying· between Sagittarius and
the Pleiades and forming the path of Ea, are what are called
in Job 9:9 the "chambers of the south". Along this path of
Ea lay, according to Babylonian symbolism, the entrance to
the Underworld; hence the constellation Sagittarius was
called "Ka-sil" (opening of the earth). Where the path of
Ea begins (between Sagittarius and Capricorn) another
path, the Milky Way, intersects the ecliptic. It is again
crossed by the Milky Way at the point where the path ends,
precisely between Gemini and Orion.
Following the ancient practice of seeking to combine
everything with its opposite, to form pairs possessing posi-
tive and negative, or male and female. qualities, the first
six signs of the zodiac were considered male, and the 6
unfavorable signs, female. The sign of the Balance (Libra)
is the dividing point between the favorable and unfavor-
able mohths. In the Babylonian religion, Libra was the
time of a solemn feast marking the period when the souls
of the dead were weighed in the balance.
In the system of Ptolemy, A.D. 139-161, the same
thought was carried out in a slightly different way. In the
latter system, the odd numbered signs were male and the
alternate or even numbered signs. were female, "as the day
is followed by night and as the male is coupled with the
female". Astrology contains many such differences in the
interpretation of signs, and it should be remembered that
the meaning attributed to any celestial phenomenon was
not decided in a scientific manner but was the theoretical
product of many different minds. The development of this
art took many centuries and such changes and inconsistencies
were natural.
ASTROLOGY 279
Four regions of the earth were distinguished: East,
West, North, and South. The rising of the bright star Alde-
bran, in the constellation Taurus, at the spring equinox,
marked the East; Antares, rising in the autumn, marked
the West; Regulus, rising in the summer, marked the North;
Fomalhaut, rising in the winter; marked the South.
The habitable world was also divided to correspond
with the divisions of the heavens. The earth was divided
into 7 zones and sometimes into 4 triangles. Each of these
triangies was under the influence of 3 zodiacal houses, ac-
cording to location. Each triangle was divided into 2 parts,
an outer and an inner. The outer part was near the limits
of the habitable world, while the inner part was near the
point of intersection of the diagonals, with Babylon placed
in the center as the "navel of the universe".
Sometimes the inner part of the triangle stood under
the influence of the opposite triangle. The houses were also
united to form geometrical figures such as triangles, rec-
tangles, and hexagons, the first and last figures being good
signs, whereas rectangles were unfavorable.
In the Babylonian system each house of the zodiac was
assigned to a planet, the sign of Cancer being related to the
moon, Leo to the sun, Gemini and Virgo to Venus, Aries
and Scorpio to Mars, and Aquarius to Saturn. In each case,
the presiding planet was the Lord of the mansion. Further-
more, the sun, Jupiter, and Saturn were associated with the
day: the moon, Mars, and Venus with the night; Mercury
was associated with both day and night. The sun, Jupiter,
and Mars were male: .the moon and Venus were female, and
Mercury might be of either sex.
The signficance of the planets changed as their latitude
increased or decreased. Their influence depended also upon
their position relative to each other. Moreover, the astro-
logical significance of each planet was determined by its
intensity, speed, heliacal rising and setting, the house of
the zodiac in which it rose and set, its position in the
constellation, and its proximity to the other planets.
Of the fixed stars, those comprising the constellations
of the zodiac were of the greatest importance because .it
was in them that the sun and planets always rose and set.
Other stars, however, were not without significance. The
most important positions were the rising, culmination, set-
280 SYMBOLS, SEX, AND THE STARS
ting, and the lowest points of the various houses. The
heliacal rising was especially important because it aided
astrologers in dividing time into uniform periods.s
The zodiac signs were further designated according to
their assumed resemblance to the 4 elements, earth, air,
fire and water. Taurus, Virgo and Capricorn were cold, heavy,
and dry signs; Cancer, Scorpio and Pisces were moist, soft,
and cold; Aries, Leo and Sagittarius were hot, dry, vehement
signs; Gemini, Libra, and Aquarius were light, moist, and hot.
Planets were called "lu-bat" (wandering sheep) or "re-
vealers" and "disposers". Seven "mashu" stars north and
south of the ecliptic had "lu" written before them to indicate
that they were shepherds guarding the planets lest they
wander too far north or south.
Because of their small orbits, Mercury and Venus
always appear near the sun, being visible shortly before
sunrise or shortly after sunset. Their appearance close to-
gether, like a family, caused them to be termed, father,
mother and son. Because Mercury and Venus appeared both
as evening and morning stars, they might be regarded as
good or evil influences.
The three outer planets, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn
formed another triad and appeared to the observer as less
under control of the sun than Mercury, Venus, or the moon.
Jupiter, in the middle, was kind. The sun, being the giver
of life and light, was likewise good; it followed that Mars
and Saturn were evil. Mars, with his turbulent, short period
of revolution, was the youthful demon, while the slowly
revolving Saturn was pictured as the hoary-headed begetter
of evil.
Despite his evil aspect, Saturn, or Bel, was regarded
as the highest and most distant planet and was the most
honored. It was the chief revealer. Saturn was also con-
sidered the bellwether sheep among the planets because it
appeared to move slowly and steadily. Because of its
contrast in speed with Mercury, the two were associated
so that Saturn could receive the epithet which properly be-
longed to Mercury. Mercury was also called the "messenger"
because of its rapid movement.
3-A star visible for a few minutes shortly after sunset may
disappear then reappear 24 or 30 days later as a morning star.
Its disappearance m the west was termed its heliacal setting
and its rising in the east was its heliacal rising.
ASTROLOGY 281
Jupiter was believed to be a good omen when it
darkened other planets, but evil if it were darkened. When
it appeared in the sky its earthly city, Babylon, might
expect prosperity.
Aries was regarded as the leader ram because, in the
age when the priests of Babylon were creating the system,
it rose heliacally at the beginning of the year.
It was believed that mock suns, which are visible under
certain atmospheric conditions, indicated by their number
how many days of rain were to follow.
Halos of the sun were relatively unimportant, but a
halo of the moon indicated that she was shepherding the
stars, and the number of stars within the circle was care-
fully noted. It was also important to note whether the
ring was light or dark, continuous or broken and, if broken,
on which side the break appeared.
When a planet entered into a zodiacal sign, the con-
junction was considered as marriage, adultery or incest.
When it vanished below the horizon and rose again to the
meridian, it was thought of as having died, risen again, and
been carried to heaven.
Because of its rapid change of position and appearance,
the moon was generally considered of prime importance
and took precedence over the sun, even in texts which were
not astrological.
The moon was likened to a tablet on which the gods
wrote their decrees, thus revealing the essence of astrological
knowledge. In the Annals of King Assurbanipal, a priest is
represented as reading the decrees which have been written
on the disk of the moon.
The waxing, waning, and the first and last appearances
of the moon were very important; likewise the 7th day of
the moon. The priest, Gudea, gives the 7th day as one of
rest. No one was struck with a whip; the mother did not
chastise her child; the householder, overseer, and the laborer
ceased to work; the dead were not buried; the courts were
closed; physicians did not treat the sick; it was inappropri-
ate to make a wish; the "Kaba" played no psalm; wailing
women sang no dirges.
The 28th day of the moon was a day of lamentation,
marking the passing of the old moon into the power of the
dragon. The full moon normally appears on the 14th day
282 SYMBOLS, SEX, AND THE STARS
but texts permitted a margin of 5 days (from the 12th to
16th day) for its appearance. An abnormal appearance was
an evil sign. Positions of the stars in relation to the moon
were sources of omens. Being on the left side of the moon
was regarded as unfavorable.
Eclipses of the sun, the moon, and the planets visible
during eclipses of the moon were significant. The extent of
the eclipse was important, as well as the part of the moon's
face covered by the shadow and the direction in which
the shadow disappeared. An eclipse was regarded as a sign
that the eclipsed body was being swallowed by a dragon
and special prayers were prepared to be recited while the
shadow crossed the face of the moon or the sun.
Thunder was the voice of Adad, the god of storms,
whose influences were either good or evil, because some rain
is necessary for the growth of crops, but too much is destruc-
tive of life and property. The significance of thunder de-
pended also on whether it was accompanied by rain. If
heard in the month Ab, it portended both good and evil.
A thunder storm, in the month Tisri, without a rainbow,
was an evil sign. Lightning in a cloudless sky foretold
a flood.
Meteors and comets rarely appear, therefore but few
omens were attributed to them but their appearance was
generally interpreted as an evil omen.
As the Greeks developed astrology, all the known sci-
ences were brought under its influence-botany, chemistry,
zoology, mineralogy, anatomy, and medicine.
Colors, metals, plants, drugs, and animal life of all
kinds were brought into relationship with the planets. In
the system of Ptolemy, the planet Saturn was associated
with gray, Jupiter with white, Mars with red, and Venus
with yellow; while the color of Mercury varied with
circumstances because of its changeable character.
Of metals, the sun was associated with gold, the moon
with silver, Jupiter with electrum, Saturn with lead, Venus
with copper, and Mercury was associated with quicksilver
because of its changeable character as a liquid or solid..
In casting individual horoscopes, the signs of the
zodiac were assigned spaces in a square divided into 12
parts (Plate 81) and representing the following values:

NE, NW, SE and SW represent the 4 pillars upon

Each of the planets was associated with a different
part of the body. Various schools of astrology had con-
flicting theories regarding the functions of the organs in
men and animals. Later, the signs of the zodiac came to
be associated with organs of the body and the constellations
of the zodiac became as important as the planets in
determining individual horoscopes.
The zodiac was regarded as the prototype of the human
body, the divisions of the zodiac corresponding to 12
divisions and 36 subdivisions of the body, each of which
was under the influence of a planet. The 1st was the head;
2nd neck; 3rd shoulders and arms; 4th heart; 5th flanks;
6th bladder; 7th buttocks; 8th pubis; 9th thighs; 10th knees;
11th legs; 12th feet. The influence of a planet upon an
individual was contingent, not merely upon the planet
which happened to rise at the time of his birth or con-
ception, but also upon the relationship between the place
of birth and the position of the planet and between parts
of the body and certain signs in the zodiac. Venus ruled
over the genital organs; Mars presided over the bile, blood,
and kidneys; Mercury's domain was the liver. In other
systems the liver was controlled by Jupiter or Venus. Many
diseases and disturbances were attributed to the influ-
ences of the planets or as due to conditions observed in
a constellation or in a star's position.
According to Manlius, in the poem Astronomicals,
written 2,000 years ago, the sun presided over the head,
Mars over the right arm, Venus over the left arm, Jupiter
over the stomach, Mars the parts below; Mercury ruled
over the right leg and Saturn over the left.
Albert the Great (1206-1280 A.D.), assigned rule to
the stars as follows: Saturn over science, buildings and
life changes; Jupiter over honors, riches, and cleanliness;
Mars over war, prisons, marriages, hatreds; Mercury over
debts, commerce, etc.; the moon over wounds, dreams,
larcenies.
In one system, the days of the week governed by the
different planets were: Sunday by the sun; Monday by the
moon; Tuesday Mars; Wednesday Mercury; Thursday Jupi.:.

Divisions of Time
The day was divided into 12 double hours, each hour
representing the time which the sun spent daily in each
sign of the zodiac. The nychthemeris (day-night period)
was further divided into 6 watches; 3 for the day, 3 for
the night. The passage of the sun through the signs of the
zodiac, beginning with its position at the beginning of
spring, suggested the division of time into years. The spring
and autumn equinoxes and the summer and winter solstices
further divided the year into 4 seasons.
286 SYMBOLS, SI<JX, AND 'l'HE STAitS
The solar year was incorrectly calculated as consisting
of 360 days and the entire calendrical, astrological, and
astronomical systems were based upon this reckoning. The
zodiacal circle, therefore, was divided into 360 parts or
degrees, 1 degree for each day of the year. Out of this
theory developed also the custom of dividing a circle into
360 degrees.
The solar year of 360 days was further divided into 36
decans of 10 days each and 72 dodecans, or weeks, of 5 days
each, with a separate star representing each 5 day period.
Sometimes each sign was further divided into 12 parts of
21h degrees each, with a planet presiding over each small
part. In the astrological texts it was assumed that every
month had 30 days although, in practice, a month may
have been 29 or 30 days.
As the sun and the moon are both important factors
in the life of man, it was believed necessary to establish a
relationship between the moon year of 354 days and the
solar year of 360 days; therefore a normal year was de-
clared to consist of 12 months, each presided over by a
god. But a solar year exceeds 12 lunations by several days,
therefore an intercalated month was necessary every 2
or 3 years.
The 360-day year became so firmly established that, for
centuries after the true length of the year became known,
a calendar period of 12 30-clay months was employed, with
5 extra or intercalary days inserted in order to keep the
seasons from gradually receding. In Egypt these 5 extra
days were religious holidays for the gods Osiris, Horus, Set,
Isis, and Nephthys. In Babylonia an extra month was added
every 6 years and named for the Raven. This month was
so named because, being an extra month, it was considered
an omen of bad luck. Sometimes the 13-month year was
called the female year.
Precession of the Equinoxes
As the earth revolves around the sun, it wavers very
slightly on its axis like a rapidly spinning top. Therefore,
if a line were drawn through its axis from pole to pole and
projected toward the heavens, it would not point forever
toward the North Star. Because of the earth's wobbly
motion the line thus projected would in the course of about
25,800 years describe a circle in the heavens.
·,
ASTROLOGY 287
As a result of this motion, each year the earth's equator
cuts the ecliptic 50.25 degrees westward of the point
where it intersected it the previous year. This slight eccen-
tricity of the earth caused no end of trouble and confusion
to early astronomers, astrologers, and calendar makers;
and even makes difficult the calculations of present day
astronomers.
Another way of describing this action is to say that
just before the earth has completed a circuit of the sun,
it will have reached the starting point in its orbit as regards
the stars. In other words, the sidereal or star year on which
our calendar is based is shorter than the real solar year
defined by a complete circling of the sun by the earth. The
difference is 1/25,800th part of a year or 20 min. 23 sec.
Slowly the equinoctial point falls back so that in about
3 years a whole hour is lost; in 71 years, 8 or 9 months,
the loss amounts to a whole day. In 25,800 years an entire
year is lost, the earth revolving about the sun but 25,799
times in 25,800 years.
To the astrologer, this means the sun does not appear
in the exact position relative to the zodiac year after year,
but passes slowly through the zodiac, its rate of passage
being about 50" 9~"' each year: 1 degree in 71+ years:
5 degrees or days in 360 years: 30 degrees, or one whole
zodiac sign, in 2,152 or 2,153 years and in about 25,800
years the sun will have passed through the full 360 degrees
of the great zodiacal circle. Ancient astronomers erro-
neously calculated the length of time required for the sun
to pass through a zodiac sign as 2,160 years, or 25,920 years
for the 12 signs.
According to calculations of the astronomer Cassini, the
sun rose in the 5th degree of Pisces at the beginning of
the Christian era. Allowing 2,160 years for the sun's passage
through a zodiac sign, this would place the entrance of the
sun into the sign of Taurus about 4,680 B.C. and Aries
about 2,520 B.C. In the early centuries of Christianity the
Church decided to ignore the Precession of the Equinoxes;
therefore, most calendars still show the sun in Aries al-
though it passed out of that sign many centuries ago and
is now entering Aquarius.
The antiquity of astrology and the common origin of
the ancient religious systems is indicated by the fact that
the bull (Taurus) was associated with practically every
288 SYMBOLS, SEX, AND THE STARS
ancient religion, either as an object of worship or as a
sacrificial offering to the gods. During the age when the
spring sun rose in Taurus the sun gods were almost uni-
formly portrayed in sculpture as having the head or horns
of a bull, or as being identified with the bull. After the
sun passed into the sign of Aries many of the figures
became ram-headed.
According to Indian tradition, a great religious war
occurred about the time of the change from the Taurus to
the Aries period. It appears that when the Ram was
elevated to the position previously held by the Bull, for
reasons which were understood by the priests only, the
populace became divided in their allegiance and cruel civil
war ensued.
As the portion of the heavens occupied by each zodiacal
constellation was not sharply defined by ancient astrono-
mers, estimates of the exact date of the sun's entry into
the Taurus, Aries or Pisces signs might easily vary by
several hundred years. Some estimates of the beginning
of the Pisces Age have even placed it approximately as
late as the opening of the Christian era. At that time the
ancient tradition which associated the births and deaths of
gods with the signs of the zodiac still prevailed; and cer-
tain writers have seen reason to suspect an attempt by
early Christian mystics to make the life of Jesus harmonize
with the astrological tradition.
The coming Messiah is called, in the Talmud, Dag, the
fish, who was reborn of the fish goddess Atergatis. It has
been pointed out that the story of the life of Jesus from
childhood onward repeatedly calls attention to incidents
relating to fish and fishermen as if the incidents had an
inner arcane significance. During the first four centuries,
Christians were called Pisiculi or Little Fishes and Jesus
was called the Big Fish. Representations symbolizing Jesus
as a fish appeared on religious and household objects, also
on the walls of the Roman catacombs. In the second century
Clement urged Christians to have a fish engraved upon their
seals to distinguish themselves from the pagans.
CHAPTER XIX
AGES OF THE GODS
HADTHE ANCIENT ASTROLOGERS returned to earth early in
the year 1940, they would have seen heavenly spectacles
of tremendous interest. On February 18th there was a
triple conjunction of Mars, Saturn, and the crescent moon.
Two days later there was a conjunction of Venus and Jupi-
ter. Then, for about a week, beginning February 28th,
there appeared a phenomenon so rare that its like had not
been reported since astronomers began to keep records of
celestial phenomena.
Half an hour after sunset the 5 planets Mercury, Jupi-
ter, Venus, Saturn and Mars could be seen in the south-
western sky, forming an almost straight line, rising at an
angle of about 30 degrees from the vertical and extending
from the horizon toward the zenith like a Jacob's ladder.
The simultaneous appearance of several planets in the
same part of the heavens is a very rare sight. There are
only 2 instances in history in which all of the planets known
to the ancients are said to have appeared in the same region
in the heavens at the same time. The first is merely a
calculation by the astronomer Bailly that a conjunction of
the 5 planets took place February 18th, 3102 B.C., exactly
5042 years before the beautiful spectacle of 1940. This,
according to Hindu tradition, was the date of the Flood and
the beginning of their present Kali yuga, or Grand Period.
The second appearance of such a spectacle is reported
in The Annals of the Bamboo Books as having occurred in
the Chinese constellation called Yin Shih, during the reign
of Emperor Tsuan Hsu, 2,513 B.C.
During the many centuries in which all events were
interpreted by astrology, the tradition prevailed that the ap-
pearance of any unusual phenomenon in the sky was evi-
dence of a great stirring among the gods, and an omen of
important events to come. The births of illustrious men
were heralded by the appearance of "signs and wonders"
in the heavens. On the other hand, the deaths of great men
were marked by thunder, lightning, heavings of the earth,
comets, eclipses of the sun or moon, and many other phe-
289
290 SYMBOLS, SEX, AND THE STARS
nomena. Shortly before the time assigned for the birth of
Christ there was a conjunction of the moon and the planets
Jupiter and Saturn, and there is a legend that Magi were
guided to the infant's birthplace by a strange star.
It seems to have been believed almost universally that
the total destruction of the world would be marked by a
conjunction of the sun, moon, and all the planets, the theory
being that in the beginning of the world, the sun, moon, and
planets stood in conjunction at the initial point of the zodiac
and would return to the same point at the end of the age.
As the theory was understood by the Babylonian priest
Berossus, destruction of the world would come by fire when
all of the planets stood in a direct line in the zodiacal sign
of Cancer (a fiery sign). If this event took place in the
sign of Capricorn (a watery sign), the world would be
destroyed by water. (In 1940, the planets were grouped in
Pisces, also a watery sign.) The Babylonian belief has been
found in Egypt, Persia, India, China, Mexico, and among
the tribes of South America. It was in Babylonia that the
Jews are believed to have received the legend that the world
would be destroyed once by fire and once by water. Accord-
ing to the allegorical treatment of mythology, the Flood
occurred· in the watery sign of Aquarius at the winter
solstice point. This would place the event about 3,100 or
3,200 B.C.
If, according to the ancient astrologers, eclipses of the
sun or moon foretold fearful events on earth, what great
catastrophe would the singular phenomenon of 1940 have
foretold to the mystic star gazer? Would it have been
considered an omen that the world. would be consumed by
fire in the great war that has ·recently engulfed the whole
earth? Would it have been an augury of the rise of a great
destroyer-dictator?
It has been shown that astrology was based upon the
belief that all life and activity on earth are determined by
the movements, conjunctions, and other aspects of the sun,
moon, and stars and, as these phenomena were known to
recur in regular cycles or periods, the events on earth which
these phenomena caused were also believed to be repeated
in cycles.
The seasonal changes upon earth from summer to
winter, with their repeating periods of growth and decay,
were believed to have their parallels in the celestial days,

weeks, months, years and ages of the gods. Therefore, it was
believed that a knowledge of the celestial cycles would not
only reveal future events on earth, but would, likewise,
reveal the birth, death and rebirth of the gods and the begin-
ning and end of the universe itself. The determination of
these cycles then became a matter of deep interest to
astrologers, priests, and philosophers. Every country had
legends regarding the duration of the world.
In some cases the beginning of the world was repre-
sented as a period of pristine purity, a Golden Age, in which
man lived in a state of perfection, with the world becoming
increasingly degenerate as time passed. The "fall" of Adam
and Eve is a variation of the Golden Age myth. Other
theories gave a more hopeful picture; the beginning of the
world was represented as a period of darkness, disease, and
anarchy, with man eternally struggling upward toward
perfection.
The Brahmans in India divided the supposed duration
of the world into 4 great time cycles, or Ages of the Gods,
as follows:
Krita yuga 1,728,000 years
Trita yuga 1,296,000 "
Dvapara yuga 864,000 "
Kali yuga 432,000 "
4,320,000 " = 1 Maha yuga.
The unit whereby yugas are calculated is 1200 years
of the gods, each of which consists of 360 solar years, or
72 periods of 6,000 each, making a total of 432,000 years.
One thousand Maha yugas make a Kalpa, or Great Age, at
the end of which the destruction and regeneration of the
world is to take place. A Kalpa is called a day of Brahma,
and his night is of equal length. Three hundred sixty of
such days and nights make a year of Brahma and 100 such
years constitute his life time. This longest period is called
a para.
The Kalpa is further divided into 14 Manvantaras, each
of which consists of 71+ Maha yugas. The present is the
7th Manvantara of this Kalpa, ruled over by Manu Vaiva-
sata, who is accepted by eastern Buddhists as the outbreath-

ing of the creative principle, the period of cosmic life which
lies between 2 prolayas: a day of Brahma.
The first, or Krita, yuga was the Golden Age in which
man lived 4,000 years; when there were no quarrels or wars;
when laws were obeyed and virtue reigned. As time pro-
gressed, the Ages became shorter and the state of the world
grew increasingly worse, with the Kali or present age
representing the complete degradation of man and the com-
ing end of the world. The Kali yuga began February 18th,.
3102, B.C.
According to another reckoning, the 4 Ages are sup-
posed to be in the proportion of 4, 3, 2 and 1:

Each period of regeneration is marked by the coming
of an Avatar1 or Savior. The best known Avatars are those
of Vishnu, which are said to be countless.
Berossus, following an older Babylonian system, sought
to make history harmonize with it by predicating

6 Rama; 7 Rama; 8 Krishna; 9 Buddha. The 10th is to come ana

making a total of 2,160,000 years for the duration of the
world.2 Each cycle is thus a ner of Seroi: 600 x 3,600 =
2,160,000 years. This period is equal to 60 x 36,000 years or
9 x 240,000. Of this time, creation lasts 7 x 240,000 years
or 7 days of cosmic time. The 2,160,000 year period is a
sixth of the important Babylonian number 12,960,000 which
is 60 x 60 x 60 x 60. According to another theory, the Baby-
lonians reckoned the period as 144 Saros or 518,400 years.

Babylonian influence may be seen in the time which
Jewish tradition gives for the period from Creation to the
Flood. Xisusthrus, the 10th patriarch, is the Noah of
Babylonian mythology as Noah is the 10th patriarch of
the Bible. The Jewish tradition of 1,656 years for the 10
patriarchs from Creation to the Flood is equal to 72 periods
of 23 years, each period consisting of 1200 weeks, or 8400
days (365.24 x 23 = 8400). In other words, the Babylonians
calculated the time from Creation to the Flood as 72 x 6,000
years, whereas the Jews calculated it as 72 times 1200
weeks. It should be noted, however, that the Jewish cal-
culation is based upon the true length of the year, or
365.24 days. This period was certainly not known to the
Jews during the sixth or seventh century B.C., when
2-From the Flood to the first Babylonian dynasty, the time was
reckoned at 34,800 or 33,091 years, which would make a period
of 36,000 years from the Flood to the reign of Alexander the
Great.
AGES OF THE GODS 295
their records are said to have been put into written form.
If it was the basis for the calculation, it is either proof
that the Jewish period of 1656 years is a late invention of
the Bible compilers or an exceedingly strange coincidence.
Another Jewish tradition gives 974 generations before Adam
and 26 generations from Adam to Moses, making 1000
generations in all. (Shab. 88b. Hag. 13b, 14a).
Comparison of the divine Ages of the Gods with the
accompanying table for reckoning earth time will show
that the great Ages of the Gods are enormously enlarged
counterparts of the seconds, minutes, hours, days, etc. of
mundane time, the whole system constituting a series of
cycles within cycles. For example: 72 years equal 25,920
days and 25,920 years is the time given for the equinoctial
cycle. Three hundred sixty years equal 129,600 days or
4,320 months, both figures having important places in
calculations of the equinoctial precession.

Another important version of the Ages of the Gods
is given in the lndo-Persian system of Zoroaster and ap-
pears to be based on the widespread tradition that the
world was made in 6 days or ages. It gives 6,000 years
for creation of the world and another 6,000 for its duration,
after which the world is to be destroyed and a new cycle
begun. The period of creation consists of
1st 1000 years Creation of the sky.

The first 3,000 years of the creative period constituted
a spiritual age in which creatures were unthinking, unmov-
ing, intangible. The second 3,000 years were the age of
Gayomart, the primeval man ·and the primeval ox. The
creative period began with the sun in the zodiac sign of
Cancer and continued through Leo and Virgo.
The second 6,000 years covers the history of the human
race, beginning with the creation of Mashya and Mashyoi,
the first man and woman, the period being divided into 2
lesser periods of 3,000 years each. The advent of Zoroaster
on earth comes 30 years before the end of the first 3,000
years and he is followed by 3 virgin-born saviors, each of
whom rules for 1,000 years to the end of the world. This
period opens with the sun in Libra and extends through
Scorpio and Sagittarius, agreeing ·in this respect with the
Babylonian legend that the end of the world will come when
the sign of Capricorn is reached.

Like the 4 Ages of the Brahmans, the Zoroastrian
12,000 year period is divided into the Four Metals, or Four
Ages of Gold, Silver, Steel and Iron.3 After the :first 3,000
years a conflict breaks out between Ahura Mazda, the Prince
of Light, and Ahriman, the Prince of Darkness; and the
struggle continues for 9,000 years. During the :first 3,000
years the contest goes in favor of Ahura: in the second
they are on equal terms, and in the :final 3,000 years Ahriman
is vanquished. The time preceding the coming of the 3
saviors is a period of deterioration marked by misery and
impiety, but the closing period is described as an advance
toward the glorious consummation.
In the last millenium, only those die who are smitten
with weapons or reach old age. When 53 years of the mil-
lenium still remain, the sweetness and nutrition of milk
and vegetables become so perfect that, on account of the
freedom of men from desire for meat, they will stop eating
it and their food will become milk and vegetables. When 3
years of the period remain people will even stop drinking
milk and their food and drink will become vegetables and
water. The milk of one cow will be enough for 1,000 men.
At the end of the 12,000 years comes the dissolution and
regeneration of the world under the savior Saoshyant.
The Aztecs of Mexico also divided creation into 4 ages.
They believed that the present era was preceded by 4 ages
or suns; the sun of the earth, sun of the fire, sun of the
air, and sun of the water, each age being terminated by a
terrible catastrophe. They looked forward with dread to the
end of the present era. It is related by Lord Kingsborough
(Mexico, vol. 6), that when the Spaniards arrived in Mexico
the natives became panic stricken when they saw the com-
mander riding a horse, because they had a tradition that
the end of the world would be heralded by the appearance
of a strange white animal. This tradition appears to co-
incide remarkably with th~ Brahman belief that the end
of the world will be brought about by Kalki in the form
of a white horse.
The manner in which the Persian dogma of the world's
destruction and renewal passed to the western nations and
became a pillar of Christian faith demonstrates the far
reaching influence sometimes produced by ideas which, at
3-See APPENDIX: Zoroastrianism.
AGES OF THE GODS 299
the time of their' inception, appear to be but of minor or,
at least, local importance.
Attention has already been called (p. 91) to the great
changes in the Jewish religious structure which were
brought about through enforced contact with Persians and
Babylonians during the Exile. Under these influences Jew-
ish thoughts turned, after the Exile, to the belief in a
coming destruction and judgment of the world. The first
reference to· this dogma appears in a prophecy attributed
to Isaiah (26:19,21), which dates, according to Cheyne,
from about 334 B.C. From that time onward the coming
end of the world became the dominant thought of almost
every Post-Exilic prophet and apocalyptic writer.4
Daniel's Four Metals and Four Beasts seem to have
been based upon the Oriental conception of the Four Ages
of the Gods. II Esdras 14:11 divided the duration of the
world into 12 parts, 10 of which had already passed.5 Rabbi
Kalina (Sanh. 97a) believed that the world will last six
milleniums and be destroyed in the seventh: 2000 years are a
period of chaos; 2000 years cover the reign of the Law, and
2000 years are to be ruled by the Messiah.
The Assumption of Moses stated the aeon to be 5,000
years. "A day of God is 1,000 years" said the Book of
Jubilees.6 Apocryphal Barnabas7 prophesied that in 6,000
years all things would come to an end: "a day is as 1,000
years", said Barnabas. ·
Rabbi Akiba's Alphabet of Letters said the end of the
world will come in 6,000 years, with a resurrection to follow.
The Slavonic Book of Enoch8 said: "Let the days be
after the fashion of 7,000", while the Ethiopic Book of Enoch9
gave a day of judgment and destruction at the end of 10
periods or "weeks", 7 of which had passed. The 8th was
to be an era of universal righteousness when the saints

would reign. The 9th was to open with judgment and the
former heaven and hell were to pass away and be succeeded
by a new heaven which would be peopled by the righteous
dead after their resurrection. Heaven and hell would be
transformed and the mountain of God's throne would be
set in the south.
That the end of the world was thought to be imminent
at the beginning of the Christian era is, of course, known
to everybody. Much of the early success of Christianity was
due to the belief that Christ would soon return in a second
divinity and would reign for 1000 years.10· The New Testa-
ment presents Christ as frequently urging his followers to
prepare for the coming day of judgment, and the authors
of the Gospels often refer to "latter days", "last times", and
the end of the world.11
Irenaeus believed that, as the work of creation lasted
6 days, the world would last 6,000 years and be followed by
1,000 years of rest, corresponding to the Sabbath after cre-
ation. St. Augustine believed that 5 periods had passed and
the world was then passing through the 6th, with the end
of all things to come in the 7th. Bede (d. · 725}, in his
Chronicles, adopted the 7 ages and predicted that the last
one, ending with the year 1000, would mark the end of
the world.
About 800 B.C., Hes~od placed the Deluge in the second
stage of the world and his own life in the fifth; or iron age.
Juvenal said, about 100 years after Christ, that the iron
age was about to end at that time. In the time of Augustus,
Virgil wrote: "The last age of the world (the 7th millenium}
is approaching and a new generation will arise out of the
elevated heaven. Be thou chaste, Lucina, 0 be propitious to
the coming child with whose advent the iron age will close".
The ancient books known as the Sibylline Oracles con-
tained prophecies that the age of the world will be divided
into 10 generations, after which a Savior will come. The
8 books are not in accord as to when the 10 generations of
the world began; 7 of them make the first generation begin

with the Flood, while only one of them makes it begin
with Adam.
In the early Christian centuries, the Sibyls were highly
venerated by the Roman Church, being quoted in the
Apostolic Constitution and by many leaders of the Church.
Michaelangelo was commissioned to portray the 8 Sibyls for
posterity, and his great paintings still adorn the ceiling of
the Sistine Chapel, although the failure of the predicted
events to materialize in the passing centuries has caused
the Oracles to become discredited. Long ago the Church
ceased all reference to the Sibyls and many modern Roman-
ists agree with the contention of Protestant scholars that
they are forgeries.
Plato said the oracle in Delphi prophesied the birth
of a son of Apollo who was to restore peace and justice to
the earth. The prediction in the Sibyls of a coming Messiah
may have been derived from the same prophecy. .
Bernard, a hermit of Thuringia, and many preachers
of the tenth century made allegorical interpretations of
the Apocalypse upon which they predicted the coming of
Anti-Christ and the end of the world.
According to an old Roman tradition, about 600 years
after the founding of the city, the populace was seized with
a great fear that the saeculum was drawing to a close. A
similar state of mind prevailed in Europe as the year 1200
A.D. approached. Imminent realization was anticipated of
the prophecy in the Gospel of John12 that one would come
to complete the mission of Christ, and a frantic desire to
force the Mohammedans out of Jerusalem before the coming
of the Savior was one of the motives which inspired the
great Crusades of that time. The immediate coming of the
Savior was predicted in the twelfth century by Joachim,
Abbot of Curacio, in Calabria, a famous interpreter of
prophecy. St. Bernard made similar predictions.
Mohammedans insist that the Gospels originally named
Mohamed as the Paraclete who is to come, but that his
name was expunged from the manuscripts, therefore, he is
rightly the 10th or :final Savior, the one who is to come
to restore peace and justice to the worId.
Various other teachers of religious doctrines were
believed by their followers to be the Paraclete. For in-
12-John 14:16, 18, 26.

stance, Simon Magus, Montanus, Marcion, and Manes were
so considered; and Christian leaders persecuted them for
encouraging the belief that they were the Holy Ghost.
If the Ages of the Gods were of astrological origin, as
is shown to be the case, it should be possible to prove that
the periods given for the regeneration of the world were
based upon astronomical cycles. It is time to see what
evidence exists to support this conclusion.
The Oriental unit of 1200 years consisted of a day of
600 years and a night of equal length. Originally, however,
these were astrological years of 360 days each, the 600 years
consisting of 216,000 days (360 x 600 or 60 x 60 x 60) and
forming a period which the Italian astronomer Cassini
called the most perfect astronomical cycle known.
If the various ways of reckoning the ancient lunar year
be compared with this solar period, it will be found that
600 solar years of 216,000 days are exactly, or almost, equal
to 608, 610 or 666 lunar years, depending upon how the
latter are calculated.
600 solar yrs. of 360 days = 216,000 days (7200 lunar months).
*608 lunar " " 355.264 " = 216,000 "
610 " " " 354 " = 215,940 "
610 " " " 354.1 " = 216,001 ..
666 " " " 324 = 215,784 " (7992 mos. of 27 days).
666 " 8 mos. " 324 " = 216,000 " (8000 " " 27 " )•
*The sidereal month of 29.530589 days gives a true lunar year of
354.367068 days.
From these figures it will be seen that a very slight
error in calculation would have given the ancient astrologer-
priests a 608, 610 or 666-year cycle. The 608-year period was
known to the Greeks, Romans, and Etruscans. It was men-
tioned by both Juvenal and Virgil as well as in the
Sibylline Oracles. The Romans had cycles of 12 and 120
years, but do not seem to have had a clear knowledge of
the 600-year cycles. .
If a 365-day solar year is used as the basis for calcu-
lation, almost equally interesting results are obtained, viz:
600 solar years of 365 days = 219000 days.
608 " " " 3GO " = 218880 "
650 lunar " " 336 " = 218400 " (12 x 28 = 336)

But the revolutions of the planets provide an even
more remarkable demonstration. If we omit all fractions,
as the ancients did, and reduce the revolutions of the
planets to round numbers of days, not only will the cycles
of the sun and moon be synchronized in periods of 216,000
days, or 600 years, but all the planets that were known to
the ancient world will mark time together in this unique
cycle.

Some of these planetary cycles were known to the
Babylonians. As might be expected, the greatest variations
from the correct figures occur with the planets Jupiter and
Saturn because they complete their orbits but once in 12
and 30 years, respectively. The long periods of observation
necessary to calculate the length of their revolutions pro-
duce greater errors. The several reckonings for the lunar
periods give the most remarkable results for, regardless of
the length of the month employed, they fit exactly, or nearly
so, into the required period an even number of times.
If this very small toleration for error be allowed, it
is easy to see how the ancient astronomers might well have
reckoned that after the creator had sent the sun, moon,
earth, and other planets spinning on their way, all of them
would meet again in the heavens after 600 years, thus
marking the end of one era and the beginning of another.
Having first calculated the periods in which the sun
and moon mark time together, the next task of the astron-
omers was naturally that of estimating the periods in which
the cycles of all the planets are harmonized, for a universal
304 SYMBOLS, SEX, AND. THE STARS
cycle, to be complete, must include all of the lesser cycles.
If the minor events on earth were regulated by the con-
junctions of the sun and moon, the more important events
would logically coincide with conjunctions of several planets.
The end of the Great Ages, bringing the destruction and
renewal of the world, would come at a conjunction, or after
a certain number of conjunctions, of all the planets.
It is generally conceded that the reckoning of zodiacal
periods began with the entry of the sun into the sign of
Taurus, in approximately 4800 B.C. If this date be accepted
as a starting point, and an allowance be made for the com-
ing of a Savior every 600 years, the beginning of the 9th
Avatar or Messiac period would coincide with the time of
Christ's birth and the 10th period would be marked by
the birth of Mohammed. The 8th period would be marked
by the rise, in the 6th century B.C., of Buddha in India,
Confucius in China, and Zoroaster in Persia, all of whom
were honored by their followers as Saviors. During the
same period, King Cyrus was equally esteemed by the Jews
for having freed them from captivity.
The numerous variations in the prophecies of later
Jewish writers, however, and the lack of a fully developed
system of Ages, make it clear that, although the Oriental
belief in the regeneration of the world became widespread
among the Jews, they never acquired a comprehensive
knowledge of the astronomical cycles upon which the theory
was based. This may be accounted for by the fact that the
dogma of a future day of resurrection and judgment was
not taken up seriously by the Jews until after the Exile,
and by the further fact that the laws against "dividers of
time" made the study of astronomy a tabooed subject for
them, so that they had very little knowledge of that science.
Although they found it expedient to adopt the Egyptian
solar year for their civil calendar, for long periods the
Jews preferred to reckon time by the reigns of their kings
or leaders or from important local and national events,
instead of reckoning by centuries, eras, and astronomical
periods.
Traces of several systems of chronology may be found
crossing each other in the Old Testament, all of which
are of late origin, but none of which is employed consist-
ently. The overlapping, contradictions, and general incon-
AGES OF THE GODS 805
sistency in dates and periods, have made Biblical chronology
extremely unreliable.1a
The period of 4,000 years allowed by the Bible for the
time from· Creation to Christ has every appearance of being
a symbolical figure rather than a historical one. Some
writers have noted that it is equivalent to the Babylonian
"world number" representing 100 generations of 40 years
each or two-thirds of a 6,000 year period. The curious
parallel between the time given by Babylonian annals and
the Bible for the period from Creation to the Flood has
already been pointed out.
Attempts have been made to fix accurately the dates
of Biblical events by reference to the genealogical tables in
Genesis, Chronicles, Matthew and Luke; by the peculiar
reference to certain periods mentioned in the Book of
Daniel and by various other means. For example: the
author of Matthew (1:17) attempts to trace the generations
from Abraham to Christ as follows: 14 generations from
Christ to the Exile, 14 generations from the Exi.le to David,
and 14 generations from David to Abraham. The enumer-
ation is obviously incorrect and appears to be a conscious
but clumsy attempt to make history conform to a definite
plan, one supposition being that each generation was esti-
mated to represent 71-1/3 years after the manner of the
Hindu Manvantara periods, giving 1000 years for each 14
generations, or 4,000 years from Adam to Christ.
Daniel's cryptic remarks in regard to "the 1335 days,"
"2300 days," and "a time, times and half a time" were once
thought by some writers to contain esoteric prophecies of
the coming of Christ, but this theory has been discarded
by modern writers. It is now known that the Book of
Daniel, instead of having been written about 600 B.C. and
prophesying events to come far in the future, was actually
written about 165 B.C., and speaks symbolically of events
then past and present.
Some knowledge of cycles is indicated, however, by
the peculiar manner in which the Jews fixed the dates of
important festivals. The adoption of solar time for the civil
calendar and lunar time for the religious calendar made it

desirable to evolve some method of reconciling the two
systems. How this was done is explained in Leviticus 25:8
where Moses commanded the Israelites to observe "... 7
sabbaths of years unto thee, 7 times 7 . . ." The 50th year
was celebrated as Jubilee year after which a new cycle
began.
From the beginning of the first year to the end of
the sixth month of the forty-ninth year is forty-eight years
and six months. The first day of the seventh month was
declared a Sabbath and the tenth day of Atonement. If
calculated on the basis of 365 days for the year and 29.5
days for each lunar period, there is a total of 17,700 days
or 600 lunations. This period is equal to 50 lunar years
of 354 days each.
For the complete span of 49 solar years the true cal-
culation is 17,896.7 days (365.24 x 49 = 17,896.7). The true
length of a lunar cycle is 29.53 days, therefore, the 17,896.7
day period is equal to 606+ lunations, or 50 lunar years
plus 6 months 1.7 days (606 x 29.53 = 17895).
CHAPTER XX
THE HOLY THREE
ITHAS BEEN SHOWN that the efforts of primitive peoples to
explain the origin and workings of the universe produced
a philosophy in which the world was envisaged as deriving
from a bi-sexual creative power personified as a god or
gods, of whom the human male and female were the pat-
tern. The male power was believed to be the active force
in the generation of life, the female power being merely the
passive vehicle in which actual production took place. It
was further assumed that, as the male organs of reproduc-
tion are of tripliform character, every act of creation has
a three-fold aspect. This belief appears to have been the
source of the custom of dividing the universe into three
great departments, ruled by triads of gods.
In addition to the triads of principal deities there were
numerous secondary and minor deities, sometimes forming
triads and sometimes not, ruling over the wind, storm,
lightning, fire, thunder, rain, etc., while local demons, or
spirits, dwelt in rocks, trees, mountains, and streams. Each
nation, tribe or cult had its .own national, local, or tribal
god. There were also household gods to whom family
groups paid special devotion. In India and Babylonia, the
gods and minor deities, or demons, were numbered in the
thousands.

The three supreme deities generally appeared as rulers
of the three original elements out of which the universe
was believed to be created. In some instances these were
earth, water, and sky: in others they were sun, fire, and
water, or water, fire, and sky. Before the oldest pages of
history were written, the number three had already become
the sacred number of the gods.
In the Babylonian system, the sky or region of the
sun was the domain of Anu or Anna: the earth was ruled
by Enlik and the subterranean waters, which were believed
to flow around and under the earth, were governed by Enki.
This great triad can be traced to the very beginning of re-
corded history, its names being engraved in an inscription
dating from King Lugatzaggigi, one of the earliest Sumerian
rulers of whose reign we have record. -In later Babylonian
history, the members of this triad were known as Anu, Bel
THE HOLY '1.'HREE 309
and Ea, but the chief actors in the historic period were
Shamash (sun), Sin (moon), and Ishtar (mother goddess).
The Brahman religion of India has endured as a con-
tinuous system longer than any other form of worship; and
its long accumulation of traditions and myths, the rise of
new gods and the gradual decline of others have made the
Brahman pantheon the most intricate and confused of all.
Both heaven and earth are divided into three parts, with
different gods ruling each sphere or aspect, assisted by hosts
of minor gods, spirits, demons, so numerous as to make the
casual reader despair of untangling the system's ramifica-
tions. Agni, the god of fire, appears under many forms and
titles and those under which Vishnu and Siva appear are
countless. In its most important aspects, however, Brah-
manism maintains the triadic grouping of the gods and
as this grouping is the sole subject of the present inquiry,
we need not be concerned with other details of the system.
In the religious systems of some nations, the existence
of 3 great gods at the beginning of creation was explained
by representing the first god as having created the other 2
members of the holy triad. In other cases all 3 members
of the triad were represented as being but different forms
or manifestations of the same god. This idea is found not
only in some of the pagan cults; it is perpetuated in the
Christian doctrine _of a Trinity in Unity: Father, Son, and
Holy Ghost, 3 persons in 1, 1 person is 3.
In Greece the images of Bacchus, Mercury, and Diana
were often portrayed with 3 heads or bodies representing
their 3-fold character. Lucina, guardian of birth; Diana,
guardian of health, and Hecate, guardian of death, are but
different forms of the same goddess. Figures of Hecate
were often placed at cross roads to keep away evil spirits,
the goddess being portrayed with 3 bodies placed back to
back so that she could see in 3 directions at once. Jupiter
was symbolized by a 3-fold thunder bolt; a 3-pronged trident
was the symbol of Neptune, and Pluto was represented by
the 3-headed Cerberus.
When the priests of Heliopolis, in Egypt, formulated
their theogony, they represented Tum as a form of the
sun god, and as having produced the 2 gods Shu and Tefnut.
The Japanese portrayed some of their gods with 3 heads
and the ancient Peruvians had a god named Tanga Tanga
whom they called 3 in one, 1 in 3. Plutarch relates that
310 SYMBOLS, SEX, AND THE STARS
Ahura Mazda, the supreme god of the Persians, "thrice
multiplied himself". Mithra was the son of Ahura, yet he
was Ahura himself. The Chinese Taoists worshiped a self-
created trinity endowed with 3 abstract attributes which
Lao-tse called I-He-Wei, a term almost identical in sound
with the Hebrew Yahweh. When preceded by the title
Adonai, Yahweh is pronounced YeHoWih.
In the Hindu system, Brahma created Vishnu and
Siva, the second and third members of the Trimurti, or
Trinity. Yet they are not 3 separate beings but are merely
3 different manifestations of the same deity.
United with Brahma (meaning prayer) is Vach or
Saraswati, his heavenly consort and divine energy. Vishnu
and Siva also have Saktis or divine energies, Siva being
united with his consort in one body, that is, in androgynous '
form.
Brahma is at once the creator, preserver and destroyer,
the self-created, self-existent great father and great mother
blended in one person and is, therefore, the primeval an-
drogyne who unites in himself the combined attributes of
all 3. In another sense Brahma is the rising sun; Siva is
the sun at noon, and Vishnu is the setting sun.
"In these 3 persons, the same god is shown,
Each in his place, each last in one land
Of Brahma, Vishnu, Siva each may be,
First, second, third among the blessed three".

Although. he reigns theoretically over the 3 major divi-
sions of earth, water, and atmosphere, Brahma more nearly
represents abstract intelligence, impersonal, passive, un-
changing. Being incapable of action himself, his thought is
given form by his divine energy Vach (meaning speech or
voice). Brahma's neutral character is not one to stir the imagi-
nation, consequently Hindu myths and scriptures assign
to him a very minor. role. The important figures in the
Trinity are Vishnu and Siva, who, perhaps, originally repre-
sented the active, creative energy of elemental water and fire.
A god revealed his various powers by appearing in dif-
ferent forms, each of which was given an individual title
and regarded as a distinct entity. For example, the words
water, ice, vapor, steam, are titles denoting different things,

yet they are but varying forms of the same element. Thus,
Agni, the Brahman god of fire, is worshiped as Surya, fire
in the sun, Trita, as lightning in the sky, and Agni as fire
on earth. Each manifestation is regarded as fire, yet Agni
comprehends all 3 forms, hence he is called Tryambaka, or
Three-Mothered. In another sense Agni is Varuna in the
evening, Mitra in the morning, 'Savitr as he traverses the
air and Indra as he illumines the sky in mid-day.
Similar reasoning prevailed among the Babylonians and
Sumerians. To them the formally spoken word or the
breath of any great god was a real divinity in itself. When
they spoke of a god's "word", the term was not used in
the modern sense but as the name of a tangible entity.
812 SYMBOLS, SEX, AND THE STARS
The inem, or word for a thing, was considered equiva-
lent to the thing itself. The oath of even a priest or witness
to an agreement, or a formally spoken promise, or threat,
possessed magical and terrible power. From inem, Baby-
lonian magicians coined the expression inim-inim-ma, which
was spoken as an incantation accompanying their feats of
magic.
The Word which on high shaketh the heavens,
The Word which beneath causes the earth to tremble.
Babylonian philosophy is thus described by Prof. Lang-
don2: "The Sumero-Babylonians invariably regarded water
as the uncreated first principle and source of all things cre-
ated. The creative form or principle resided in the pri-
mordial watery chaos. . . . Evidence adduced . . . for the
beneficent activity of the god's word and breath induces
the conjecture that the Sumerians employed the term inim
(word) for cosmic creative form or reason. But, at any
rate, we know that the term mummu was said to mean
'loud voice,' apparently because the roar of the thunder
or rain god was adopted as a term for the indwelling
wisdom of water.
"The reality of a thing consisted in its 'forms', i.e., the
divine mental concept which is revealed to mankind by its
name. All knowledge is revelation and the reality of things
was not their tangibleness but the mental concept and
things cannot exist until the god has this mental concept.
Fundamentally, all things, material and immaterial, rest
upon the mental activity of the water god (Ea) which is
personified as mummu or cosmic reason."
Babylonian worshipers of spirits believed the voices of
gods were heard in the sound of thunder, ocean waves, and
water falls; in rustling leaves; in the creaking of swaying
trees; in the faint sound of water dripping in deep caverns
and in many other natural sounds. The friendly presence
of a god's spirit or breath was felt in the caress of a gentle
breeze, or gust, while high, turbulent winds indicated his
anger.

fleeted a Babylonian origin. Spiritism is in evidence
throughout Genesis, and both Abraham and Jacob are
shown to have had strange dreams and visions; to have
planted trees and set up pillars and heaps of stone as
dwelling places for their deity.
The expressions "Word of Wrath", "Word of God", and
"Spirit of God'' were used by the Jews as personifications
of the divine essence in the same sense as that in which
the Babylonians employed them.3 This is demonstrated in
Genesis 1:1 where the Word is the active agent which car-
ries out the will of the creator: "God spake the Word and
the worlds were made."

agent of the deity was adopted by western nations, how the
term increased in significance until it eventually became

personified as the deity, is one of the little known chapters
in the history .of the origin of Christian dogma.
The desire of Christian propagators to strengthen the
claim that the Scriptures CQntain divine revelations, unlike
any other records in the world, has not been conducive to
the pursuit of an objective investigation which would show
the true relationship between Christian and pagan beliefs.
Therefore, when Bible readers see the term "Word" used
in the Old Testament to designate the creative 'power of
God, and as a synonym for Christ in the Gospel of Jc;>hn,
the term is usually passed by without the reader's having
any knowledge of its origin and significance. But, as will
be shown in the following brief outline, this peculiar con-
cept was closely related to, if not derived directly from,
beliefs which had prevailed for many centuries among the
Hindus, Babylonians, Persians, Egyptians, and Jews.
In Persia, the Word was the great weapon of Zoroaster.
In Greece, Mercury was the Word or messenger of Zeus;
to the Romans, the Word was represented by the goddess
Fama. In Egypt, it was the creative agent of the god Thot.
As the embodiment of wisdom and keeper of the secret
of the divine Word, Horus, the god of light, was portrayed
with a finger to his lips, symbolizing secrecy or silence.
According to Maspero's4 interpretation of their records,
the ~gyptians believed that the spoken word of the gods,
on issuing from the mouth, thickened into tangible sub-
stance, endowed with creative power and energy.
4-0f the creative power of the Word in Egypt, Maspero says that
Thot: "recited them (words) with that true intonation which
renders them all powerful and everyone became, like himself,
master of the universe ... in fact, the articulate word and the
voice were believed to be the most potent of creative forces, not
remaining immaterial and issuing from the lips1 but thickening,
so to speak, into tangible substance; into boaies which were
themselves animated by creative life and energy; into gods and
goddesses who lived or who created; even Tumu had called forth
by a very short ~hrase the gods who ordered all things; for his

thought as the substitution of creation by the Word for creation
by muscular effort.... At first it was oelieved the creator had

The Egyptian word for spirit is very similar to the word
rehk, meaning spittle; and the Egyptian belief that the cre-
ator's spirit or breath became a definite entity on passing
the lips, is probably the origin of the custom of priests to
touch the finger tips to their tongues and anointing young
children with spittle to open their eyes and ears to spiritual
understanding. Jesus is said to have cured blindness by
touching the eyes with spittle, and backward people all
over the world have looked upon the practice as a form
of baptism or spiritual awakening, similar to the Biblical
practice of "laying on of hands".
By the seventh century B.C., the influence of Indian
and Babylonian culture began to be felt in the West and,
when Greek philosophers turned their attention to the
nature of reason and the cosmic processes, their conclusions
reflected the influence of Oriental philosophy. The universe
was generally regarded by the Greeks as the product of a
cosmic intelligence which formed and ruled all things. Their
speculations were devoted principally to the form or man-
ner in which this intelligence was manifested, whether
816 SYMBOLS, SEX, AND THE STARS
reason or divine wisdom was imminent in the universal
creative process or was an independent force speaking from
without.
Thales adopted the Babylonian conception of water as
the universal element and the source of cosmic intelligence.
In the sixth century, Heraclitus discarded the Babylonian
theory and adopted fire as the universal element, which
he sometimes called the "hot breath". Heraclitus envisioned
a ceaseless transformation of all things .from fire or heat,
then back again to fire. Finding "the Word" too restricted
in meaning to express the operating principle of this cosmic
law, or reason, he designated it by the word Logos which
denotes both revelation and reason.
Anaxagoras formulated a theory of a supreme intel-
lectual principle not identified with the world but inde-
pendent of it, the regulating principle of the universe being
the Logos, which he envisioned as the divine intelligence
acting as intermediary between the creator and the world.
The Stoics also adopted a theory of an active principle
pervading the worId and determining its form. This oper-
ative principle they called both Logos and Creator. The
Logos, they said, exists as thought as long as it is unuttered,
but becomes the Word as soon as it is spoken. Like Hera-
clitus, the Stoics regarded fire as the primordial substance,
the material principle of the divine power, Endowed with
inherent productive activity, it is the "seminal reason" of
the world which manifests itself in all phenomena of nature.
The world is a living creature whose spirit goes through
all things, the creator of forms though itself formless.
Greek thinking regarding the activity of cosmic intel-
ligence in creation reached its greatest intellectual and
imaginative heights in the philosophy of Plato. In Timaeus,
a cosmological myth based largely upon Pythagorean
geometry and astronomy combined with principles of physi-
ology and medicine, Plato gave to Greek philosophy its
first conception of a creator god. He visualized the material
world as a living organism, created by Reason and Neces-
sity, molded into spherical form after the likeness of an
eternal pattern, being without beginning or end with refer-
ence to time, and composed of the four primary elements
fire, air, water, and earth in order to provide the greatest
degree of unity.
THE HOLY THREE 317
The world soul, Plato said, was formed by the creator
out of the constituents Existence, Difference, and Being,
compounded in the proportions of a musical harmony. The
soul was placed in the center of the cosmic body and per-
meated it throughout, making the body also its exterior
environment.
The world was girdled by the circles of the equator
and ecliptic, the latter being split into the seven lesser
circles of the planets and the two (equator and ecliptic)
were animated in opposite movements, their principal
motion being that which is most appropriate to mind and
intelligence.
Then there were formed the various subordinate gods
and the higher or immortal parts of the human soul, these
coming direct from the hands of god himself. The formation
of the human body and the lower, or mortal, elements of
the human soul was effected by the activity of the created
gods (i.e., the stars). This theory of god's creative activity
being manifested in an "upper" and a "lower" sphere was
later made an important feature of the Jewish Cabala.5
5-"God did not make the soul after the body, although we are
speaking of them in this order.... He made the soul in origin
and excellence prior to and older than the body to be its ruler
and mistress.
"God made the soul out of the following elements and in this
wise: God made the soul before the body out of the indivisible
and the unchangeable and also out of that which is divisible and
has to do with material bodies. He compounded a third and
intermediate kind of essence, partaking of the nature of the
Same and of the Other and this compound he placed accord-
ingly in an amount between the indivisible, the divisible and
the material.
"He took the three elements of the Same, the Other and the
essence and mingled them into one form, compressing by force the
reluctant and unsociable nature of the Other into the Same.
This entire compound he divided lengthwise into two parts
which he joined to one another at the center and bent them into
a circular form, connecting them with themselves and each other
at the point opposite to their original meeting point and com-
prehending them in a uniform revolution upon the same axis:
one he made the outer circle and the other he made the inner
circle.
"Now the motion of the outer circle he called the.motion of the
Same and the motion of the inner circle the motion of the Other
or Diverse. The motion of the Same he carried around by the
side of the right and the motion of the Diverse diagonally to the
left and he gave dominion to the motion of the Same and the
Like for the single and undivided: but the inner motion he
divided into six places and made seven unequal circles, having
their internals in ratios of two and three, three of each and bade
the orbits proceed in a direction opposite to one another: and
these (Sun, Mercury, Venus, Mars and Jupiter) to move with
unequal swiftness about the three and about one another but
in due proportions." Timaeus, by Plato, pp. 34-36.
318 SYMBOLS, SEX, AND THE STARS
Although there is a tremendous gulf between Plato's
conception of creation and present day scientific thought
on the subject, his cosmology exercised considerable influ-
ence on religious and philosophic thinking in his own and
succeeding centuries. Even today, his fame endures as one
of the greatest thinkers. of all time. His theory may, there-
fore, be accepted as representative of the results which have
been produced whenever men have resorted to intuition
and imagination as a substitute for the methods of science.
In the first few years of the Christian era, Philo Ju-
daeus, a Hellenized Jew, made an attempt to reconcile the
pagan pantheistic theories with Jewish conceptions of God.
He was a member of the Alexandrian school of philosophy
and a student of the theories of Heraclitus, Plato, Pytha-
goras, ·the Stoics, and other Greek philosophers. He was
probably also familiar with the Oriental philosophies then
being taught in Alexandria.
Philo conceived the Logos to be not merely immanent
in the cosmos: he gave it an independent existence as inter-
mediary between God and the world. His theory was con-
fused, contradictory, and sometimes unintelligible, yet its
importance in the history of Christianity cannot be over-
estimated, for it was principally from Philo that the early
Christian fathers derived the concepts upon which to base
their doctrine of a Trinity in Unity.
As visualized by Philo, God is unchangeable, passive,
unthinking, eternal, incomprehensible. He did not create
matter, but found a passive, primeval mass of it on hand
at the time of creation. He can have no connection with
evil, even to punish it. As matter is essentially evil,
God can have no connection with the creation of man
but must call upon the Word to aid him. In the conception
of God as an abstract, passive being who functions through
an intermediary, Philo's theory is strongly reminiscent of
the Hindu conception of Brahma. The Word or Logos,
then, is the· active intelligent principle in creation and God
is reduced to a mere name. Sometimes the words Wisdom
and Spirit are used in the same sense as the Logos. Later,
this conception of God loomed large in the theories of the
Gnostics and Cabalists.
According to Philo, God begot the Word, yet by some
hocus-pocus which he does not make clear, it was not be-
THE HOLY THREE 819
gotten like angels or creatures and, because of this peculiar
generation, Philo declared the Word or Logos to be the
first-born Son of God, the prototypal man in whose image
all other men are created. Again, he is the idea, or ideas,
the. whole mind of God giving out of himself in creation.
He is both the high priest and Shekinah; the Glory of God
as well as the intelligible world. Although, at one time,
Philo speaks of the Logos as if it were a being distinct from
God under the figure of a son, at another time the Logos
seems to be merely a manifestation of the divine wisdom.
As an orthodox Jew, however, Philo could not accept belief
in any mortal formed in the likeness of God or even brought
into comparison with him.
His distinction between God and his rational power,
or Logos, in contact with the world was maintained in
later developments of Hellenistic speculation by the Neo-
Platonists, even to the extent of predicating 3 Gods; first,
a supreme God; second, God or the Demiurge, or Logos,
and third, God, or the world.
Philo's effort to fuse Greek wisdom and Jewish religion
was naturally unacceptable to the Jews, but it was received
enthusiastically by the early Christians,· some of whom
thought he was a Christian.
Although the Jews were not willing to accept the
radical theories of Philo, their own theories had already
developed far in the same direction. As their culture had
advanced to such a point that they were no loriger able to
believe in an anthropomorphic God who had walked in the
Garden of Eden and joined them in battle against their
enemies, their conception of him had become less sharply
defined. His form became blurred, ghostly, and abstract.
As it did so, he receded into the distance until, finally, he
was thought to reside in some vague region beyond the
stars. His remoteness from the earth then made it difficult
for his worshipers to believe that he heard their prayers or
that he retained a warm, protective interest in them.
It was at this point that the Jews began to hope for a
Messiah or intermediary to bridge the gulf between God and
man. The Messiah was expected to not only intercede with
God on behalf of man; he was to be the active agent who
carried out activities which God himself was no longer
able or willing to perform. Wherever the king or Messiah
820 SYMBOLS, SEX, .A.ND THE STARS
is mentioned in the Old Testament,8 it was accepted as
equivalent to the Word or Logos and the Jewish concep-
tion .of the Messiah became closely analogous to the inter-
mediaries of the gods of India, Persia, Babylon, and Egypt.
The title Messiah seems to be derived from Mes (Greek
mesos, Latin mezzo), an old root meaning "middle", "from
the middle", "out of"; hence "born of" or "son of". Meshken,
meaning birthplace, combines mes (middle) and ken, a nest
or womb.
In Egyptian usage, the sons of Ra, Thot, and Aah were
designated Ra-mes, or Ra-meses, Thotmes and Aahmes.
Mesopotamia denotes "in the middle of the rivers". From
the ancient practice of commanding a person to place his
hand under the thigh of his interrogator when swearing
under oath, a witness was termed a mesitis or "middleman".
When the Jews looked forward to the coming of a Messiah,
they had in mind the Mess-iah, or Mess-Jah, that is, a
middleman, interceder, or mediator with Jahveh.
After the Babylonian period, speculations regarding
God's mediator increased tremendously, and practically
every Jewish writer discussed his nature and the time of
his coming. The- continued failure of the Messiah to appear
upon the earth caused the attributes of God to be adopted
as pale substitutes for him and God was represented as
functioning through them as his agents or emanations. The
Wisdom, the Shekinah or Glory, and the Spirit of God
were considered as intermediaries between God and man
and even the Law could be regarded as an independent
spiritual entity in much the same sense that the Word or
Voice was believed by pagans to be the active creative agent
of their gods.
In the Targumim,7 the doctrines of the Word, the Angel
and the Wisdom of God assume concrete form and emerge
definitely as his intermediaries. Passages of the Bible which
state that the Word appeared or acted are translated re-
peatedly by the commentary of Onkelos as "the Word of
the Lord" appeared or acted. God is shielded by his inter-
mediaries from any contact with man or from any active
part in creation. Inasmuch as the Targum of Onkelos was
held in the highest esteem by the Jews, we may be sure
6-See Ps. 45:11, Ps. 72:11, Ps. 2:12.
7-See Appendix: Talmud.
THE HOLY THREE 321
that his usage of words was approved by the best authorities
of his time. In the Targum of Jonathan, also, "Word" is
used in the same sense. In the Mishnah, the 10 passages in
Genesis (Ch. 1), beginning with "our Lord said", are
spoken of as the 10 ma amarot (words or speeches) by
which the world was created.8
Wisdom, which dwelt with Ea in the depths of the sea,
according to Babylonian mythology, became, in Jewish liter-
ature, the encompassing intelligence of God, the helper of
the creator, the foundation of the world. Israel's God was
believed to be ruler of the universe, and Wisdom was re-
garded as the cosmic power. It was God's master workman
(Prov. 8:30); the first of his works (Prov. 8:23), and his
designer. (Prov. 3:19; Ps. 104:24).
Under the influence of Greek philosophy, Wisdom be-.
came a divine agency of a personal character (Wisdom 7:22,
30), so that Philo termed it the daughter of God, "the
mother of the creative Word".
According to the Wisdom of Solomon, a Jewish work
written in Alexandria during the first century B.C., Wisdom
is immanent in God, belonging to the. divine essence, yet
existing in a quasi-independent state side by side with him.
Wisdom, the Logos and the Holy Spirit were closely iden-
tified as active agents in the creation of the world, selecting
among the divine ideas those which were to be actualized
in the created universe. Wisdom is the cosmic principle
dwelling on the throne of glory next to God and knowing
and designing all things (Wisdom 9:1; 4:10), being identical
with the creative world (9:1), and the Holy Spirit (9:17).
Ecclesiasticus, the Book of Enoch, Testimony of the Twelve
Patriarchs and other works speak to the same effect.
8-It was not the Lord that appeared to Abram, but the Word of
the Lord. It was the Word of the Lord that appeared to Adam
and Jacob. The Word of the Lord created man in his image.
The Heavens were made, not by the Lord but by the Word of the
Lord. (Deut. 33:37).
The Jerusalem TargU?n declares the Word created the earth.
Moses went up to meet the Word of the Lord. (Ex. 19:3). It
was the Word of the Lord that spoke to Moses (Ex. 3:2), says
Onkelos.
Where the Gentile version says "I heard thy voice in the gar-
den" the Targumim say "I heard the voice of the Word in the
garden".
The Spirit is spoken of as a person in the beginning of Gen. 2
and Gen. 6:3; in Num. 11:25,26; Ps. 33:6; II Sam. 13:23.
"And the Word of the Lord bless thee and the Word of the
Lord said to them, be ye fruitful and multiply and replenish the
earth". (Gen. 3:5,9) and so on.
322 SYMBOLS, SEX, AND THE STARS
The term Shekinah (dwelling) is used in the Talmud
and Midrash in place of Word (Memra)'. Onkelos translates
Elohim as Shekinah in Genesis 9:27 and elsewhere. The
terms "presence" and "faces" of God are .translated in the
same way.0 The Targumim psuedo-Jonathan and Jerusalem
adopt a like system as in Psalms 21:8 and 89:47.
Maimonides, a celebrated Jewish theologian of the
twelfth century, regarded the Shekinah of God as of the
same character as the Memra (Word) and the Logos: to
him the Shekinah was a distinct entity, and a light created
to be an intermediary between God and the world. Nah-
manides, an eminent Jewish theologian of the thirteenth cen-
tury, considered the Shekinah to be the essence of God
manifested in a distinct form.
When the Wisdom, Spirit, and other attributes of the
Almighty came to be considered as distinct entities, cul-
mination of the evolutionary process could not be far off:
personification of the attributes was the only step which
remained to be taken. Paul prepared the way for this step
when he taught that Jesus was born a man and became
God. When the author of I John followed Paul with the
declaration that God, Jesus, and the Word (Spirit) were
one and the same, it marked the final phase of a belief
which had been developing among the Jews for several
centuries.
Paul's· writings show a thorough knowledge of the Alex-
andrian philosophy and the portrayal of Jesus which he
gives in his Epistles is an effort to breathe life into Philo's
conception of the Logos and the "second God".
· As seen ·at this distance, Paul's message seems much
more revolutionary than it appeared to the people of his
day. The period was one of intense religious speculation
and there was widespread belief that the end of one of the
great ages of the world was approaching. It was expected
that the coming of the long-IOoked for Avatar or Messiah
would be followed by the destruction and regeneration of
th..e:world.·

THE HOLY ~'BREE 823
Both in the Jewish Scriptures and in pagan mythology
there were numerous accounts of miraculous births and
of men being wafted to heaven in life or after death. Faith
healing and wonder-working were every day occurrences
and no one doubted the ability of the holy men to raise
the dead, drive out devils, cure people of fevers, epilepsy,
and other diseases, restore sight to the blind, and perform
many other miracles. ·
Many religious leaders claimed to be, or were believed
by their followers to be, the Messiah, and to some of these
men miracle-working was attributed. Simon Magus,10 Apol-
lonius, Bar Jesus11, Theudas,12 and a Jesus ben Pandira
were condemned and some of them put to death because
of their claim to possess supernatural power.
Paul began to teach of the crucifixion and resurrection
of the Son of God at a time when the minds of the people
were thoroughly prepared for extraordinary changes and a
restless expectancy pervaded all Judea. There could hardly
have been a more favorable moment for spreading new
doctrines. Yet Paul admits that the Jews were indifferent
or hostile to his work and he was forced to confine his
proselytism solely to the Gentiles.1s
By their rejection of Paul's teaching, the Jews com-
pelled Christianity to change from a Jewish to a Gentile
religion, thus altering the whole course of Western history.
It is extremely important, therefore, that we know what
Paul taught, upon what evidence his testimony was based
and why the Jews rejected his teaching.

THE HOLY THREE
(Continued)
EuL's CONVERSION WAS NOT the result of long investigation
or mediation; it struck him suddenly, like a thunder bolt.
In the Acts of the Apostles, a book said to have been written
by Luke, a companion of Paul, it is related that while on
his way to Damascus an intense white light appeared before
Paul, and he heard the voice of Jesus reproaching him and
commanding that he proceed to the city where he would
be given further instructions.1
For three days thereafter he remained blind and help-
less, and he was not quite sure in later years whether he
had seen Jesus or an apparition.2 Throughout his epistles,
Paul speaks of visions, of being in trances, of having bodily
affiictions,3 and if he suffered from epilepsy, as appears to
be the case, his vision of Jesus was probably an hallucination
during an epileptic coma.
Aside from the bare statement that Jesus was crucified
and resurrected, Paul says very little to present him as
more than a phantom or symbolic figure. Nowhere in his
writings does Paul mention the time, place, or virgin birth
of Jesus; his personal appearance is not described; his
travels, teachings, and miracles are not mentioned nor does
Paul give any details of the events which immediately pre-
ceded and followed the crucifixion. He had studied with the
priest Gamaliel in Jerusalem and must have been in that
city at the time Jesus is supposed to have been teaching
and performing miracles there; yet Paul had no personal
knowledge of him. Although, after his conversion, Paul
made several visits to Jerusalem in order to gather all avail-
able information about Jesus, one reads his writings in vain
for intimate details which would give a vivid picture of the
Savior's life. His failure to mention the virgin birth, the
miracles, the Sermon on the Mount, and other teachings of
Jesus is especially inexplicable because they were the
strongest testimony he could have presented to his listeners.

THE HOLY THREE 325
Nowhere does Paul acknowledge that his teachings are
shared by or derived from the Apostles. When he speaks
of Jesus as the first begotten Son of God who died to save
all men, he speaks as if the fact were his own revelation.
"Jesus was raised from the dead according to my gospel"
says Paul (II Tim. 2:8) and, again, he mentions "that gospel
which I preach". (Gal. 2:2). It is not the gospel of the
Apostles but the gospel of Paul.
His ideas about morals and right living, to which he
devotes much attention in his Epistles, are precisely the
same ideas that the Essenes had been teaching for more
than a century, and Paul does not even claim that they
represent the views of Jesus. There existed at that time
numerous small groups or sects such as the Essenes, who
ate communal meals, held weekly prayer meetings and
observed secret doctrines. Paul himself mentions having
appeared before such groups4 and he says nothing in his
Epistles which precludes the possibility that the Christ
whom he preaches was derived from the doctrines of one
of these obscure groups.
When Paul stated (I Cor. 15:3) that "Christ died for
our sins according to the Scriptures", he could not have
referred to the Jewish Scriptures for they contained no
such statement; he could not have referred to the Christian
Gospels, for they were not written until many years after-
ward; but the Essenes did have Scriptures as well as Tracts
and Gospels.
The mystery of the origin of Paul's doctrines deepens
considerably when the attitude of the Jews toward Jesus is
taken into consideration. Judged by the reaction of the
public today to any unusual event, it seems fair to presume
that if it were known that the Savior had been born in
a manger at Bethlehem, runners would have carried the
momentous news to every corner of Judea: rejoicing cele-
brants would soon have gathered in every town and village;
the roads would have been filled with ecstatic Jews hasten-
ing to Bethlehem to stand in the presence of the Son of
God and pay him honor. For this was no ordinary miracle
of a virgin birth. Here men were witnessing the unique
spectacle of the Almighty Father of the Universe sending
his other self to earth.
4-Acts 16:13, 19:1,4; 20:7, 18:25.
SYMBOLS, SEX, AND THE STARS
If the infant Savior were sent to redeem the people of
all nations, and not the Jews alone, the signs in the sky
which heralded his. coming should have been visible to the
Gauls, Greeks, Romans, Egyptians, Hindus and Chinese, in
fact to the people of every nation, tribe, and clan on earth
so that they, too, might rejoice in his coming.
One should expect to read that from earliest infancy,
Jesus was worshiped, shielded, protected, every incident in
his life being observed and recorded with infinite care. But
history gives no such picture. In pagan countries his birth
was entirely unknown. Even Jewish records failed to men-
tion his birth, and the Gospels support the conclusion that
until he began his ministry at about the age of twenty-nine
years, he lived in utmost obscurity and, apparently, in pov-
erty. With the exception of a passage in Josephus' Anr
tiquities (18:3 Sec. 3) which is obviously an interpolation,
no Jewish historian of that period even mentions the name
of Jesus. The failure of Philo Judaeus, the most reliable
contemporary Jewish writer, to mention him is particularly
significant. When Paul appeared before Porcius Festus and
related how he had seen Christ in a vision, Festus had never
heard of Christ and, probably knowing of Paul's affliction,
thought he had been merely seeing visions in a trance.11
The absence of any reference to Jesus of Nazareth (or
Bethlehem) in the Jewish records is accentuated by the
readiness with which the rabbis recorded the life of an-
other reputed Messiah, Jehoshua (Jesus) ben Pandira.
According to the Talmud, Rabbi Joshua b. Perahyah6 went
5---Acts 26:24.
6---Jehoshua, son of Perahyah, was a president of the Sanhedrin,
being the fifth, reckoning from Ezra as the first. He was one
of those who received and transmitted the oral law, as it was
claimed, direct from Mount Sinai.
Perahyah began to teach about 154 B.C., therefore we may infer
that he was born not later than 180-170 B.C., and that it was
probably not later than 100 B.C. when he went to Egypt w~th
his pupil, for it is said he went there to escape persecution.
This doubtless refers to a civil war in which the Pharisees re-
volted against King Yannai, about 105 B.C. If we assume the
age of the pupil .Jehoshua ben Pandira. to be 15 years, it would
place his birth .at about 120 B.C. Yannai reigned from 106 to
70 B.C. and was succeeded by his widow Salome, whom the
Greeks called Alexandra. She reigned nine years. Traditionsz
especially of the first "Toledoth JehoshuO:', say the queen or
Yanhai and the mother of John Hyrcanus, who must, therefore,
have been Salome, showed favor to Jehoshua and his teaching
and was a witness to his wonderful works. She tried to save
him from his religious enemies because he was related to her,
but that during her reign, he was put to death.
THE HOLY THREE 327
to Alexandria; Egypt; ·to• -escape the persecution ·of the
-Jewish king Yannai and 'took with him a pupil named
Jesus. There is some confusion as to the surname of the
pupil, certain passages referring to him as Jesus ben Pan-
dira while others refer to him as Jesus ben Stada.
It is probable that while in Egypt this Pandira, or
Stada, became a member of the sect of Therapeutae which
was located near Alexandria, for it is said that while there
he learned to perform miracles by magic, the formula for
which he cut in his skin. (Shab. 104b). After his return
from Egypt "he practiced magic and deceived and led astray
Israel" (Bab. Sanh. 107b; Sotah 47a; Yer. Hag. 77d) and
his disciples healed the sick "in the name of Jesus Pandira".
(Yer. Shab. 14d Ab. Zarah 27b; Eccl. R. 1,8).
According to the Babylonian Gemara (the Mishna of
tract Shabbath), this Jehoshua, or Jesus, was stoned to
death and crucified by hanging on a tree in the city of Lud,
or Lydda, on the eve of Passah, the day before Passover.
The Toledoth Yeshu, written in the Middle Ages, states that
Jesus was named after Perahyah, who was his mother's
brother, and this is supported by Kirkisani who wrote a
history of Jewish sects in 937 A.D.
Celsus mentions the story (in Origen's Contra Celsum,
l.c. 1,32) and gives an authority. According to his version,
Jesus' mother was seduced by a Roman soldier named Pan-
thera. Two centuries later Epiphanius (Haeres, lxxviii, 7)
gives the surname Panther to Jacob, an ancestor of Jesus;
and gives his genealogy as Jacob, called Panther, Mary-
Joseph, Cleopas, Jesus. John of Damascus (De Orthod.,
Fide iv, sec. 15) gives the name Panther and Barpanther
.JI?- the genealogy of Mary.
The garbled condition of the Talmudic records makes
it impossible to determine the details with any degree of
;certainty, but they leave no doubt that there was a Jesus
,ben Pandira or Stada; that he was taken to Egypt; that
,he .practiced magic ·and was crucified about one hundred
years before the date given for the birth of the Biblical Jesus.
The failure of the Jews to mention Jesus of Nazareth
cannot be accounted for by assuming that they erased his
name from their records because they became disappointed
with his teachings and considered him a false Messiah. They
rwere a:s mµch opposed to the works of Pandira as they are
328 SYMBOLS, SEX, AND '!'HE STARS
reputed to have be~n_ to those of Jesus, yet they permitted
Pandira's name to be mentioned several times in the Tal-
mud. It must also be borne in mind that the supposed dis-
appointment of the. Jews did not come until near the end
of Jesus' life when, as his historians assert, his life and work
had become so widely known that knowledge of them could
not have been suppressed. During his infancy and youth
the Jews had no reason to suppress the story of his miracu-
lous birth because they had no reason then to suspect that
he was destined to disappoint them.
Upon turning to the Gospel writers for confirmation of
Paul's testimony, it becomes apparent that the historicity
of Jesus cannot be established by a calm, critical appraisal
of the evidence presented, but must be accepted through
faith alone.
As Christianity spread in the century following Paul's
ministry, a great number of Gospels were written by anony-
mous authors who frequently signed the names of Apostles
to their works in order to make them appear authoritative.
The four Gospels which were finally selected by the church
as authentic or inspired were claimed to be "according to"
the Apostles Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, thus implying
that the events they describe were related to the authors
by eye-witnesses.7 The Gospels purport to quote many of
the parables and discourses of Jesus word for word, includ-
ing the comments and reactions of his listeners: they de-
scribe, in minute detail, a great number of acts and inci-
dents in his life, some of which are of minor or even
trivial interest.
Actually, however, the Gospels were written by Greek-
speaking aliens and a reading of their testimony reveals an
unfamiliarity with the history and geography of Palestine
and an imperfect knowledge of Jewish laws and customs.
While giving the impression that they were closely associ-
ated with Jesus by describing intimate details which could
easily have been invented and could not be disproved, the
authors seem to have avoided mention of many important
details which could be verified from historical records. They
are not clear as to the year in which Jesus was born or the
year of his crucifixion: they give no information about his
youth and early manhood or the length of his ministry: they
7-"Even as they delivered them unto us, which from the begin-
ning were eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word." Luke 1:2.
THE HOLY THREE 329
do not know, or at least do not state, what became of his
father, mother, brothers, and sisters and, in general, exhibit
but a remote and sketchy knowledge of his life.
The Gospels are supposed to have been written while
the incidents they describe were still fresh in the minds of
the eyewitnesses, yet the Apostolic Fathers (Clement of
Rome, Ignatius and Polycarp), who lived and wrote in the
first half of the 2nd century, did not write anything which
indicated that they had ever heard of the Gospels.
In the middle of the 2nd century Justin Martyr sought
to prove the divinity of Jesus, but when he tried to refute
the claims of pagan critics he could only state: "When we
say also that the Word, which is the first birth of God,
was produced without sexual union and that he, Jesus
Christ, our teacher, was crucified, died, and rose again and
ascended into heaven, we propound nothing different from
what you believe regarding those whom you assume to
be sons of Jupiter."8
In placing the Christian belief in Jesus on the same
level as the pagan belief in Jupiter, Justin admitted, inferen-
tially, that he had no more proof of the historicity of Jesus
than the pagans had of their supreme god. If he had been
familiar with the Gospels, this would have been the time
for him to drive home his argument by calling upon the
testimony of the Gospel writers to prove that the story
of Jesus was history, whereas the story of Jupiter was
merely mythology. But Justin made no mention of the
Gospels or their authors.
Papias, a contemporary of Justin, is credited with hav-
ing mentioned certain writings of Matthew and Mark, but
there is no indication that the works referred to were the
Gospels. The four Gospels were first definitely mentioned
by Irenaeus, writing about 190 A.D., over one hundred fifty
years after the alleged crucifixion.
In Matthew (23:25) Jesus critiCizes the Jews for slay-
ing Zacharias, the son of Barachias. This event took place
in the temple in 69 A.D., therefore, the author of Matthew
makes Jesus comment on an event which did not take
place until about forty years after his death and twenty or
thirty years after the Gospel of Matthew is supposed to have
been written. Luke is supposed to have been a companion
8-First Apology, Chapter 21, Ante-Nicene Library, Justin Martyr.
330 SYMBOLS1 SEX, AND THE' STARS
of Paul. The Gospel bearing Luke's name is addressed to
Theophilus and the only known person to whom this can
refer is Theophilus, bishop of Antioch, who lived late in
the second century, a hundred years after Paul's death.
The authors sought to record incomparably the·greatest
event since the world began. If they believed they were
writing authentic history, they should not have deemed it
necessary to magnify the importance of their story by em-
bellishing it with fantastic and unbelievable incidents. Yet
they wrote as if they were creating a mystery drama for
propaganda purposes. ·
Knowing in advance that the pagans whom they wished
to convert had traditions, which had been handed· down for
.many centuries, of miraculous births, crucifixions and re-
births among the gods, the authors of the Gospels must have
realized that, in order to win the unbelievers, it would be
necessary to convince them that the new savior had dupli-
cated every miracle of the pagan gods and performed even:
greater ones. Accordingly, incident after incident would
be invented or borrowed from ancient literature to furnish
an imposing story. It is obvious that this was the method
pursued. The result was a mixture. of miracles and the
moralistic teachings which were then very popular. Into
this combination was blended practically every important
incident that had been associated with the old world-wide
myth of the sun god's birth and re-birth.
Conservative Biblical authorities place the writing of
Mark's Gospel between 56 and 63 A.D. If the author of this
Gospel had known of the virgin birth he surely would
have mentioned it, but he says nothing about it, nor does
the author of the Gospel of Jo;hn which, it is claimed, was
written between 78 and 97 A.D. The story first appears in
the Gospel of Luke and, as related by him, Mary conceived
her child before her marriage to Joseph· who seems to
have believed the child was his own. The .Gospel of Mat-
thew gives a somewhat different version. According to Mat-
thew, Joseph knew the child did not belong to him, but
was dissuaded from divorcing Mary by an angel who ap-
peared to him in a dream and informed him that the child
had been conceived by the Holy Ghost.
Luke's statement (2:15,17) that Jesus was attended at
birth by shepherds is strongly reminiscent of a .myth that
the Persian god Mithra was born in a cave and was adored
TJ;IE HO.LY TflREE 831
by shepher<ls. Matthew chqnges the shepherds to Wise Men
(2;8):;and. adds the Star .of Betlllehem. The anonymous
shepherds eventually become thre~ k,i:qgs, whose names are
not mentioned anywhere else in history. Matthew says that
Mary and Joseph fled with the infant Jesus to Egypt to
escape the wrath of King Herod; but Luke knows nothing
of this and says that after the forty days of purification were
Qver the father and mother of Jesus presented him at the
temple in Jerusalem where Herod could easily have laid
hands upon him.
The Gospel of Matthew begins with a genealogy of Jesus
in order to prove that he was descended from David, the son
of ·Jesse, thus fulfilling the Old Testament prophecy of
Isaiah0 that a branch of David would be born to redeem
the world. Matthew's genealogy gives fourteen generations
from Abraham to David, fourteen generations from David
to the E;xile, and fourteen generations from the Exile to
Jesus, or forty-two generations in all; forty-two being a
symbolic number for pain, hardship and regeneration.
Luke gives a wholly different genealogy of Jesus. He
lists forty-two generations from Joseph to David. Not one
name on Luke's list agrees with the corresponding name
given by Matthew. From Jesus to Abraham, Luke gives
fifty-six generations and from Jesus through Abraham and
Adam to God a total of seventy-seven; all of these numbers
being of high mystical significance.
The Gospel writers represent Jesus as being the very
essence of gentleness and unbounded love, champion of
the meek and lowly, yet picture hi:r,n as refusing to recognize
his own mother.10 They quote him as declaring that he
came to earth to send not peace but a sword. (Matt. 10:34).
They have him saying in a parable, "But those mine enemies
which would not that I reign over them, bring hither and
slay before me" (Luke 19:27) and making other intern-
9-Isaiah 9:6, 11:1, 7:14. In order that this prophecy of a coming
., . Messiah might not be misconstrued, however, Isaiah repeated
at least ten times in Chapters 43 to 48 the warning that "...
· ·before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after
me". (43:10). "I, even I, am the Lord and beside me there is no
savior". (43:11). "I am the Lord and there is none else". (45:6).
"A just God and a savior, there is none beside me". (45:21,22).
"For I am God and there is none else: I am God and there is
none like me". (46:9). "I am the Lord; that is my name: and
my glory will I not give to another", (42:8). "I am he; I am

Jesus is made to prophesy that he would be followed
by a Comforter,12 for whom the world is still waiting. Again
he is made to predict the coming end of the world, intimat-
ing that it would occur within the very lifetime of his
listeners. How the Son of God could falsely forecast the end
of the world is a question which has embarrassed theologians
for nearly nineteen hundred years.
Matthew, Mark, and Luke seem to have formulated no
clear idea as to whether Jesus was God or man. In certain
passages he is quoted as saying that he and his father are
one: in others he complains that his father has forsaken him.
It is only in John's mind that the point is definitely decided.
In the Gospel of John, Jesus becomes the incarnation of
God from birth, in· the form of man. The W011d which
Philo had envisioned as a "second God" becomes flesh by
the birth of God's only begotten Son. "The Word was
with God and the Word was God". (John 1:1). Almost
the whole doctrine of the Logos is given in John's effort
to relate the life of Jesus from the viewpoint of the Philonic
theory.
In John's Epistle (I John 5:7) the long evolution of
the Word and the Holy Spirit reach their culmination in
John's announcement that "there are three that bear wit-
ness in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit:
and the three are one".13 The belief in a sacred Trinity
which, for many centuries, had been a prominent feature
of Oriental religions, had at .last become a part of Christian
doctrine. The Word, which the ancient religions of India,
Babylon, Greece, and Egypt had created as a mystic inter-

13-The revised version of the Bible omits I John 5:7 as .an inter-
polation. Many modern authorities believe this verse and the
last twelve verses in the 28th chapter of Matthew were forged
by the same writer in order to strengthen the doctrine of the
Trinity and offset verses 10:5,6 and 15:24, which command that
the word of Christ shall be preached to none but Jews.
THE HOLY THREE 333
mediary to carry out the work of their passive gods had,
according to John, materialized in human form. John, how-
ever, could not have been quite sure of Jesus' oneness
with God for in his Gospel (14:28) he makes Jesus say: "I
go unto the Father; for my Father is greater than I".
The events narrated by John are irreconcilable with
those of the other Gospels: either his work or that of the
other writers must be false. Probably the principal reason
why John's Gospel was accepted by the early Church
Fathers as an inspired work was that he was the only Gospel
writer who directly stated that the Father and Son were
one. It was on the authority of John alone that the doctrine
of the Trinity was established.
His stature as a historian is well revealed in the last
verse in his book wherein he says, "There are also many
other things which Jesus did the which, if they should be
written every one, I suppose that even the world itself
could not contain the books that should be written". Yet,
the author is speaking of a man whose public career
probably did not last more than one year.
It is now conceded by Biblical scholars that the last
twelve verses of the Gospel of Mark, which tell of the
resurrection and ascension of Jesus, were not written by
Mark but were added by a later hand. Mark, therefore,
said nothing of the resurrection. Matthew was the first
to write that Christ rose from the dead. Luke gives the
story in greater detail and, later, John devoted two full
chapters to it. John speaks of nail holes in Jesus's hands
and feet, but Luke (23:39) says Jesus was hanged.14
Matthew says that at the moment of Jesus's death on
the cross, darkness obscured the sun, the earth heavti,
saints came out of their graves15 and walked the streets,
yet nowhere on earth were these events noted except in
Jerusalem. Even the Jews who are supposed to have seen
them did not record them. Nor are the Gospel writers in
agreement regarding details of the crucifixion, Christ's dis-
appearance from the sepulchre, or as to the time and place
he was last seen on earth before ascending to heaven.
14-Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made
a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth
on a tree. Gal 3:13. "hanged on a tree." Acts 5:30; 10:39; 13:29.

When these many·details are considered together, they
fail in several respects to qualify as authentic history, as
measured by modern standards.· First: One of the• primary
requirements. of · history' is that events described must
appear to be reasonably probable. Evidence given to .sub-
stantiate a claim should be in proportion to.. its degree of
probability or improbability. ·Stories of events of an extra-
ordinary or improbable character require extraordinary
verification. If a modern writer were to state that he had
seen an athlete jump 22 feet his statement would, in ordi-
nary circumstances, appear reasonably credible because it
is well known that such an accomplishment is, a physical
possibility. But, if the writer were to claim that the athlete
had jumped. 75 feet, critical readers would demand that
the story be supported by a motion picture record and
affidavits from many .reliable witnesses because such· ~
feat would be so extraordinary as to be outside of human
experience.
Not only do the Gospel writers fail to offer appropriate
evidence to substantiate their claims upon grounds of rea"'.'
sonable probability, but their numerous discrepancies, con-
tradictions, and omissions, their readiness to accept as
facts rumors and legends which they had heard at third
and fourth hand; their obvious · role as i-efortners, their'
desire to promote religious ··doctrines· arid ·their apparent
willingness to even invent stories to promote these doctrines
is proof that, instead of being objective historians, they
were decidedly propagandists. Indeed; if any· subject other
than religion were involved, it is extremely doubtful
whether any body of thoughtful men would take the
writings of such men seriously.
. f The Gospel writers portray God as the kindly Heavenly
Father who loves all of his earthly children. It is incon-
ceivable, therefore, that he should visit the earth without
making his teachings and his presence known to every
nation and tribe in the world. Yet only a tiny minority
of mankind were favored with a knowledge of Christ ~nd
his activities.16 A God who could give all of his devotion

to the Jews and show no interest in the other peoples- of
the world would be unworthy of worship or even respect.
This fact alone stamps the Jesus story as the creation of
provincially-minded men who thought only in ,terms of
their own little community and did not expect or .intend
that their messages would be disseminated throughout the
world.
The Gospel writers, furthermore, · revealed their lack
of perspicacity when they represented Jesus as telling his
listeners on numerous occasions that the end of the world
was imminent, assuring them that it would come within
their own lifetime. They made statements in this connec-
tion which the future would positively prove or disprove.
By representing Jesus as trying to instill fear and anxiety
into the minds of the ignorant and credulous with proph-
ecies of a world-wide catastrophe which never material-
ized, they unwittingly portrayed him as a false prophet
and cruel charlatan. If it be assumed, however, that these
warnings originated in the minds of the Gospel writers,
that they merely seized upon a widespread superstition
that the world would soon come to an end and attributed
their own false prophecies to Jesus in order to frighten
people into an acceptance of the new religion, then they
were unscrupulous writers who wrote with intent to deceive.
God is represented, on the one hand as the omnipotent
and omniscient ruler of the universe and on the other as
the author of history's greatest and most tragic failure, for
his visit on earth utterly failed to redeem mankind. Men
continued, after the reputed resurrection, to be as selfish,
as lustful, and as cruel as before.
An all-powerful and all-knowing God could have trans-
formed the hearts of men by the mere waving of his hand;
at least, he could have devised an easier and more practical
way to save humanity, and a far more successful one, than
the long, painful method described by the Gospel writers.
But that would have made the task too simple. Unless the
object of their worship performed all kinds of marvelous
and even ridiculous feats, how would people know that he
was the true God? This is why the creators of ancient
mythology always endeavored to excite the awe and won-
derment of the people by inventing round-about ways and
difficult tasks for their godly heroes, involving pain, hard-
ships, persecutions, and supernatural performances. Such
336 SYMBOLS, SEX, AND THE STARS
tragic and spectacular incidents characterize the religious
literature of every age and country and constitute the
tell-tale trade marks of the myth makers.
Having considered the testimony of the Gospel writers
and the silence of the Jews regarding Jesus, it is clear
why his contemporary, Paul, failed to report the miracles
and teachings of Jesus which were reputedly well known
to other men who wrote many years after Paul's death.
Paul said nothing of these matters for the reason that he
knew nothing of them. The Apostle to the Gentiles was
ignorant of these things because in his day they had not
yet been invented.
CHAPTER XXII
THE HOLY THREE
(Continued)
WTH THE PRONOUNCEMENT of the three-fold manifesta-
tion of God, the authors of the Gospels apparently thought
the relation of the Word and Spirit to the Godhead was
disposed of for all time and required no explanation. At
least they did not explain the relationship, and perhaps
did not realize just what it was.
Opponents of the doctrine, however, charged that, in
its worship of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, Christianity
was not essentially different in that respect from the pagan
worship of triads of gods.
There being in the first centuries no central organ-
ization to define the limitations of belief, each church tried
to refute the charges of tritheism and explain the Trinity
in its own way. Consequently, differences and contradic-
tions soon developed in the theories advanced by various
leaders, which constantly involved the church in schisms
and charges of heresy. Among the many questions which
arose were these:
Was Christ a mere man endowed with divine wisdom
and power?
Did the divine spirit abide in the man Jesus or was
the incarnation a mere figure under which God
was revealed to man?
Could Christ, being mortal, be of the same substance
as God or was he inferior?
If his birth was contrary to nature, could he be a
real man?
Did he possess both divine and human natures in
one or was he wholly divine?
Was he capable of change, i.e., possessed of freedom
of will and choice of good and evil or was he
incapable of sin?
Was he co-existent with the Father from the begin-
ning or was there a time when he did not exist?
837
338 SYMBOLS, SEX, AND '.l'HE S'.l'AllS
The orthodox position of the church on such questions
developed slowly out of· hair-splitting discussions of nu-
merous charges of heresy where a defendant's guilt or inno-
cence was sometimes decided by the shades of meanings
of a single word.
High-lighting this phase of early church history were
the heresies of Sabellius, a presbyter of Libya, Paul of
Samosata, the prelate of Antioch, and Arius, a presbyter of
Baucalis, a suburb of Alexandria.
Sabellius was condemned for declaring that Christ and
the· Holy Ghost were mere characters by whom God is
revealed to men. Paul of Samosata was condemned for
asserting that Christ was a mere man in whom the divine
Logos dwelt. Arius, a tall, ascetic man who had a sharp,
brilliant mind, was the most difficult adversary. He con-
tended that Christ had no existence before he was begotten.
As God was the Father, he must have existed before the
Son, and as the creator is superior to that which he creates,
God is superior to his Son. Being a creature, Christ could
not be of the same substance as God. As a creature, Christ
had freedom of will and was kept sinless only by his own
virtue.
Arius gained many supporters and the controversy over
his theories still raged when the bishops finally assembled
at Nicea Jn 325 A.D. to define Christian belief.
The bishops knew that the very existence of the
church depended upon their decisions. They had to devise
a formula which would heal the wounds produced by 200
years of strife; preserve the Trinity, and avoid the appear-
anGe of tritheism. No body of men ever sat down to solve
a more insoluble problem. In such a situation their de-
cisions were bound to be dictated by political considerations
rather than by facts and logic.
F. J. Foakes-Jackson quotes the historian Socrates as
saying: "What took place was a fight in the dark; no man
knew whether he struck friend or foe". The author then
adds: "A fear of heresy on the one hand and of inno-
vation on the other made them waverers; yet it was by
the vcite of such as these that the matter had to be decided."1
It was evident that the only way to exclude Arius from
the church was to pronounce Christ divine, yet wholly
1-'-The History of the Christian Church, F. J. Foakes-Jackson, p. 307.
THE HOLY 'l'HREID 839
mortal; of the same substance .as the Father; existent, not
merely from the moment of his human birth as the man
Jesus, but generated by God from the beginning. As a
mortal, Christ was ·capable of sin but as a result of the
Logos' taking the place of the higher soul, there could be
in him only one nature.
That this formula was contradictory and impossible
was realized from the beginning. It was only 50 years
since Paul of Samosata had been condemned and driven
from the church for declaring that both divine and mortal
natures dwelt in Christ. Humiliating as it was for the
church to reverse its own decision, it had to be done. Any
other decision would have been equivalent to declaring that
the Father and Son were not one God but two, and this
the delegates dared not do. Some of the bishops failed to
comprehend the actual meaning of the point at issue and
approved the Creed with tongue in cheek.
The doctrine of a Tri-une God ruling the world was
urged upon the council by Athanasius, Bishop of Alex-
andria, supported by bishops of .the eastern churches who,
doubtless, were aware of. the age'."old heathen belief in the
triadic character of the gods and were, perhaps, shrewd
enough to realize the advantages of such a doctrine in win-
ning converts from the heathen cults. At any rate, the
Holy Ghost was treated as an extraneous issue throughout
the council meeting. Except for ·'requiring a belief in the
Holy Ghost, the council ·did•· nothing ·toward defining its
relation to the Godhead,· aiid -it remained a useless append-
age, serving no purpose other:than tO 'complete the Trinity.
There being no personage to represent the third member
9f the Trinity; it became customary in later religious art
to represent this member as a dove, the mystic symbol of
the Holy Spirit. ·
As finally adopted at Constantinople, in 381 A,.D.1 the
Creed says:
"(We believe) . . . iri one Lord, Jesus Christ, the
only begotten Soh of God, begotten of the Father
before all worlds;: (God of God):. Light .of Light, Very
God of God, begotten not made, b~ing of one substance
with the Father; by whom all things were made; who,
for us men and: for. our salvation, came down from
heaven and was incarnated by. the Holy Ghost of the
Virgin Mary," etc.
340 SYMBOLS, SEX, AND THE STARS
This affirmation should be re-read and given searching
thought by every reader. No other religion in the world
ever put forth such an astounding doctrine. From the works
of the Gospel writers, particularly John, the bishops at
Nicea formulated the doctrine that Jesus is not merely the
Son of God, but that he is God, the two names referring to
different manifestations of the same person.
Secondary details omitted, the Creed and the Gospels
together affirm that God was grieved by the sinfulness of
his children on earth and decided to come down from heaven
to redeem them. For this purpose his Spirit entered the
womb of Mary and, in due time, he was born in human
form. After birth, he lived as a normal but obscure per-
son for about thirty years. Then he began to teach and
perform miracles and, finally, ·contrived to have himself
crucified. (The crucifixion must have been part of his plan
for the redemption of the world: being omniscient and omniJ,>-
otent, he could have prevented it had he wished to do
so).2 After being dead for part of three days, he resurrected
himself from the tomb and, after an uncertain period (the
Gospel writers do not agree on this point), returned, still
in human form, to his throne in heaven.
Converts to Christianity were required to accept these
beliefs as sacred truths: persons who did not accept them
were doomed to eternal torture in hell. For many centuries
thousands of men and women who could not, in all con-
science, subscribe to such incomprehensible dogmas suffered
the agonies of a real hell on earth by persecution, exile,
torture, or burning at the stake.
Almost from the moment of its adoption, the Nicean
· Creed became the subject of violent criticism by Arian
partisans. Before the opposition was permanently put down
in 381 A.D., Macedonius, the Patriarch of Constantinople,
had been condemned for denying the divinity of the Holy
Ghost, and the theory of the Two Substances ·in one per-
son had been discarded by the church and again restored.
At the council of Chalcedon, in 451, it was declared
that in the person of Christ are united two complete
2-No man taketh it (life) from me, but I lay it down of myself.
I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again.

'!'HE HOLY THREE 841
natures, divine and human. This was supplemented at the
third council of Constantinople, in 680, by the statement
that each of the natures contains a will, so that Christ
possesses two wills. The western church adopted the de-
cisions of Nicea, Chalcedon, and Constantinople, therefore
the doctrines of the Trinity and the Two Supstances of
Christ were handed down as orthodox dogma for the
churches of the East and the West.
The doctrine never ceased to be a cause of contention.
Until two or three hundred years ago, it remained a prime
source of debate in the church. Opinions of churchmen
regarding the relationship of the members of the Trinity
changed back and forth. Although churchmen held that
God and Christ are one, the charges of heresy made against
the theologian Abelard by St. Bernard, in the twelfth cen-
tury, were based, in part, upon Abelard's declaration that
Christ did not fear God.
From the beginning, a minor Christian element per-
sisted which could not accept belief in a Holy Trinity which
did not include a female member. The Ophites, an early
sect, solved the problem by adopting the pagan concept
of a Trinity consisting of Father, Mother, and Son. Hippo-
lytus found in them an Assyrian dogma of a trinity of the
soul. The Mandaeans, another Christian sect, regarded the
Ruha (Holy Spirit) as the mother of the Messiah, a view
which harmonizes with the Cabalistic theory that the Holy
Spirit is feminine.
The influence of the ancient tradition may still be seen
in the modern tendency of the Catholic Church to sub-
ordinate or replace the Holy Spirit by greatly magnifying
the role of the Virgin Mother. In the last century, Cardinal
Newman carried this tendency to its logical conclusion in
his Golden Manual (Response V, p. 649) with the state-
ment that "The God himself created her (Mary) in the
Holy Ghost and poured her out among all his works."
Many volumes have been written in unsuccessful efforts
to rationalize the Trinity and make it appear plausible.
Realizing the hopelessness of trying to make it understand-
able, most present-day churchmen prefer to avoid contro-
versy by simply contending that the composition of the
842 SYMBOLS, .SEX, AND THE STARS
Trinity "is an·incomprehensible mystery of divine revelation;~
Stripped of its mystic pretensions, however, the doctrine
is strictly a human invention, evolved painfully out of two
hundred· years of bitter and sometimes bloody dissension,
and is incomprehensible only for the reason that an effort
·was made to write meanings into it which did not make
sense, even to its .authors. Early in the third century, Ter-
tullian wrote what still stands as perhaps the most candid
and the most inane apology for the Christian doctrine that
has ever been made. Said he: "I reverence it because it is
contemptible: I adore it because it is absurd: I believe it
because it i_s impossible."
At this late day no religious body would dare amend
or discard the doctrine, and it remains a lasting token of
men's willingness to subscribe to beliefs which they can
neither prove nor comprehend.

CHAPTER XXIII
THE TRINITY IN JUDAISM
AN INQUIRY INTO the idea of a Trinity in Unity would
not be complete without some further words about its re-
lation to Judaism. In tracing the evolution of "the Word",
it has been shown that as the anthropomorphic God receded
into the distance, the Jews came to look upon the Word
as a creative agent of the Almighty. This idea spread until
Wisdom, Understanding, the Shekinah, the "presence" or
"faces", in fact every power, attribute or aspect of God
visible to man had become an entity, as if God were a
many-armed being with each arm performing some specific
part of his work. Nothing has been shown, hnwever, which
indicates that these powers were conceived as forming a
Trinity or Triad. Among both Christians and Jews there
is an assumption that the Trinity was peculiarly Christian
in origin, wholly unrelated to old Jewish beliefs.
The fact that God had 3 principal titles-Yahwe, Elohim
and El Shaddai; that Adam and Noah each had 3 sons;
that 3 angels appeared before Abraham on the plains of
Mamre; that Moses, Aaron, and Miriam formed a triad; these
are considered to have been mere coincidences and to have
no significance.
But the reader has probably observed that Oriental
writers liked to draw analogies and to recite history in
the form of parables. The mere facts of history were not
considered as important as were the symbolic relationships
which could be drawn from them. Both words and num-
bers were often used, especially by early writers, not in a
strict, factual sense but in a way which made the event
described conform to the writer's notions of its symbolic
connotations. Religious rites, customs, and practices were
not mere haphazard, spontaneous developments but were
carefully planned to symbolize certain beliefs, many of
which were known only to the priesthood.
An example of this 'may be seen in the placing of
cherubim to the right and left of God's place on the mercy
seat in the Holy of Holies. The Bible does not tell why
this was done and Bible authorities can offer no definite
explanation of it; but if God were envisioned as of 3-:-fold
843
344 SYMBOLS, SEX, AND THE STARS
character, it would not have been unreasonable for the
Israelites to have provided seats for the 3 members of the
Godhead. This seems to have been been the conclusion
reached by Philo for in one place he stated that although
God is one, this is not to be understood with respect to
number and in another place he declared the cherubim were
symbols of the 2 eternal powers of God. The same thought
appears repeatedly in the Targumim.
Again, all Jews were commanded to wear upon their
foreheads leather phylacteries or frontlets on which were
inscribed the 3-pronged letter Shin and no explanation
was given as to why this particular letter was adopted as
an emblem of Yahweh.1
Small square pieces of parchment were placed within
the phylacteries and on them were written 4 verses from
the Scriptures, the first of them being the fourth. of Deuter-
onomy, chapter 6, in which the name of the Lord is
repeated 3 times-"Hear, 0 Israel, our Lord God is one
Lord." Every Jew was commanded to repeat this verse
at least twice daily. A similar repetition of the holy name
appears in the blessing of Israel given in Numbers 6:24,25,26
and in Isaiah 33:22 and 6:3.
A similar device was worn upon the left forearm. In
this case the leather strap on the device was wrapped
around the middle finger three times so as to form the
letter Shin; then the strap was wound around the forearm
seven times and tied with a knot which formed the letter
Yod or Jod, the emblem of Yahweh.
When giving the eternal blessing to the assembly, the
priest makes the sign of the Trinity, as Mohammedan and
Brahman priests do, by raising the right arm and extend-
ing the 3 middle fingers. In reciting the blessing, the priest
reads the verse from Numbers 6:24 3 times, speaking in
a different tone of voice with each reading.
That these customs were symbolic of certain Jewish
beliefs is obvious, but the Bible does not shed any light
upon what the beliefs were. Therefore, it is to the Cabala
and other esoteric works that we must go to learn something
about them.
1-And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand and they
shall be as frontlets between thine eyes.
And thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house and on
thy gates. Deut. 6:8,9 and Ex. 13:9,16.

87. .Tewish head and arm phyl<roteries.
Modern critics are generally inclined to belittle the
Cabala as an example of the more extravagant form of
Jewish speculations, which it is. Yet it must be conceded
that its authors were learned men who had a deep knowl-
edge of Jewish history and traditions, and in writing the
Cabala they were only putting into organized form concepts
which had been current for many centuries among those
who were familiar with the higher, esoteric phases of
Jewish m~ticism.
The Zohar (book of the Cabala) speaks of Elohim as
being 3-fold and proceeds to explain this dogma by a quo-
tation from a Rabbi R. Jose, as follows: "Come and see the
mystery in the word Elohim (Aleim) ! There are 3 degrees
and every degree is distinct by himself, yet notwithstanding,
they are all one and bound together in one, nor can they
be separated each from the other."
Again quoting from R. Jose (Exod. col. 75), the same
authority gives the following explanation for the repetition
of the Lord's name in Deuteronomy 6:4 and the change of
voice when reading Numbers 6:24: "They must know that
these 3, viz., ieue Aleim ieue (Jehovah Aleim Jehovah) are
one unum and that is the secret which we learn in the mys-
tery of the voice which is here: the voice is one unum
but it contains 3 modes, viz., the fire, the air and the water.
Now these 3 are one in the mystery of the voice and they
are but one unum, so in this place, Jehovah our Lord Jeho-
vah are one unum". According to this view the hidden,
or secret, meaning of the 3 modes seems to have been that
Jehovah was Lord of the 3 great divisions of the universe,
846 SYMBOLS,. SEX, AND THE STARS
fire, air and water which, as we have seen, was exactly the
role played by the great gods of India, Babylonia, Greece
and Egypt. Elsewhere the author. says that the 3 branches
of the letter Shin denote the heavenly fathers who are
riamed in Deuteronomy 6:4. ·
That such opinions were not confined to the Cabalists
may be seen· in a work by Rabbi Akiba, a famous .scholar
of the second century who was considered a paragon of
wisdom. In his Alphabet of Letters Akiba says: "Why is
the letter aleph 'W.l'itten as a letter and· read as a syllable of
3 letters? B~cause it represents the Holy One who is one
and the reading of his name is a 3-fold, as it is written:
"Hear, 0 Isra~l, our Lord God is one Lord."
Rev. Father Calmet observed that Raymond Martin,
Galatine and several other scholars of the Middle Ages
undertook to show that the Chaldee paraphrase of the Pen-
tateuch and the ancient rabbis made express mention of
the Trinity and of the 3 persons. Calmet says: "We find
indeed in their writings the word Shalishith, which sig-
nifies ·Trinity and Memar (Memra) which signifies the
Word and Ruach Kakkadoshah, which signifies the Holy
Spirit. We also find God the Father, God th~ Son, and
God the Holy Spirit. Lastly the Tri-une, Three-in-One
and One-in-Three and Jehovah to express the Father, the
Memara-jah for the word of the Father and Shekinah for
the Holy Ghost."2
Anastasius Kircher, a seventeenth century Jesuit scholar,
wrote that on all of the Hebrew manuscripts which he had
seen in the Vatican the 3 Jods were printed in a circle as a
symbol of JVH.8 Elsewhere he gives a quotation in which
all the persons of the Trinity are named, thus: Pater Deus,
Filius .Deus, Spiritus Sanctus Deus, Trinus in Unitate et

or Understanding and the Ruach, or Holy Spirit. This
conception could not merely have been drawn from the
authors' imagination for, as we have seen, Wisdom and the
Holy Spirit were considered as agents of the divine essence
in Post-Exilic times if not earlier. They are self-created
personalities or modes of existence, yet they are all one and
the name is one, the name Jehovah applying equally to the
3 Sephiroth. In other words God is manifested in 3 forms:
Crown, Wisdom and Holy Spirit.
The author of the Zohar and the author of the Book of
Habbakir declare that the 2nd Sephira proceeds from the
lst and that the 3rd proceeds from the 2nd. This is comparable
to the Indian tradition which makes Vishnu proceed from
Brahma, and Siva to issue from the forehead of Vishnu.
Calabists designate the Holy Spirit as being feminine, and
this belief is also sanctioned by very old tradition. St.
Jerome observed that it was common among the Nazarenes.
The last 7 Sephiroth are called Middoth or measures,
that is attributes and characters which are visible in the
works of God, such as fear, justice, beauty, etc.
Rabbi Menachem, a .noted Cabalist, declared it was
the Shekinah that appeared to Adam after his sin and made
clothes for him; that he appeared to Abram and Jacob and
that it was he who spoke to Moses and gave the law to
the people.
A Cabalist, Rabbi Joseph ben Gekatilia, quoted Isaiah
(11 :2) to the effect that the Messiah and .Wisdom were
the same. "The spirit of Wisdom shall rest upon him (the
Messiah), the Spirit of Wisdom and Understanding." Isaiah
48:16 and 59:19,20,21 are given similar interpretations.
Another Cabalist, Ehat Rabbi Salomon Jarchi, declared
upon the authority of Isaiah 11 that the Cochma (Wisdom)
shall be in the middle of the Messiah and the Book of Enoch
says: "The Messiah exists from the beginning; he sits on
the throne of God and possesses universal dominion; all
jiidgmerit is committed unto him". This is almost pre-
cisely. the position taken by the bishops at the Council of
Nicea in their struggle against Arianism, and it proves that
the theories of the Cabalists were deeply rooted in Jewish
tradition.
Turning from the opinions of Cabalists and others to
the Bible itself .for further light on the 3-fold nature of the
348 SYMBOLS, SEX, AND THE ST.A.RS
Godhead, brings us at once to one of the Book's great mys-
teries. Two of the principal titles of God (Elohim and
Adonai), are plural words but in the translation of the Bible
they have been used repeatedly in a singular sense.
In defense of the interpretation which has thus been
placed upon the names, Bible authorities maintain that the
authors of the text perhaps followed a custom which was
widespread in ancient times of employing plural titles for
deities to signify majesty and power. But in view of the
great pains the Jews took to distinguish between Yahweh
and the heathen gods, not only does this explanation appear
superficial, but it creates the suspicion that an effort has
been made to conceal something. Presently it will be shown
that this suspicion is quite justified.
Genesis 11 :7 now reads, "Go to, let us go down and
there confound their language ...", and in Genesis 3:22
God does not say of Adam, "behold the man has become
like me'', or even "like us". He says rather, "as one of us".
Here the language is direct, simple and clear; and there can
be no question about the intended meaning. Had it been
intended in the first part of these sentences to convey the
idea that the words were spoken by God, in the first person
singular, the construction of the entire sentence would have
been different.
Again, in Genesis 49:25, appeal is made to what appear
to be two distinct Gods: "By the God (Al) of thy father,
who shall help thee, and by the Almighty (Shaddi), who
shall bless thee with blessings". In this case the word
Shaddi is translated "Almighty" whereas in Leviticus 17:7
and Deuteronomy 32:17 i shdim (the shaddim) is translated
"devils".
Deuteronomy 32:17 reads: "They sacrificed unto devils
(Shdim or Shaddim) not to God (Ale); to gods (Aleim)
whom they knew not, to new gods (Aleim) that came
newly up...."' Here "Ale"' means God, singular: Aleim
refers to gods plural and the word Shaddim is translated
"devils".
When Aaron speaks of a golden image of the Egyptian
bull Apis which the Israelites had made during the absence
of Moses, there can be no question of his using the word
Aleim in a plural sense: "These be thy gods (Aleim) 0
THE TRINITY IN JUDAISM 849
Israel, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt"
(Exodus 32:4).
In Exodus 2:23 the word Aleim is preceded bye mean-
ing "the" and the sentence should read, "Their cry came
up to the gods". In Exodus 6:7, 15:3, 40:32, 35:5 and else-
where the singular rendering is given, but in Exodus 18:11
and Deuteronomy 10:17 and 12:30, 31 e aleim is translated
"gods".
In Genesis 35:7 the plural Aleim is joined with a plural
verb and should read: "And (Jacob) called the place El
Beth-el because the gods there appeared to him". Joshua
24:19 should read, "You cannot serve the Lord, for he is
the Holy Gods."
Many similar examples of mistranslation appear, not
only in the Pentateuch, but in Job 35:10; Psalm 119:1;
II Samuel 7:23, Isaiah 49:24, 54:5 and elsewhere.5 The
term ieue aleim (Jehovah Gods) is always translated in-
correctly, "Lord God," and efforts are made to have it
appear that Lord and God are synonymous terms. In
passages where Aleim is used as a name for Jehovah it
denotes one God, but when used as a name for heathen
gods it is translated as a plurality of gods. Wherever it
was the intention to denote one God the title Aleim or
Elohim might have been used in its singular form, Eloah,
but this was seldom done.
Had the rabbis understood that Aleim was to be read
as a singular word, they would have interpreted "I saw
gods" (I Samuel 28:13) as referring to one person but they
did not do so. Their own Talmudists have concluded that
this passage referred to two persons, namely, Moses and
Samuel.6
Further evidence that the rabbis were well aware that
Aleim referred to Gods, 'plural, is given elsewhere in their
own records. In commenting upon the Greek translation
of the Pentateuch, which was made at the request of
Ptolemy. Philadelphus, the Talmudists state that in parts
of the text Aleim was translated into Greek as a singular
noun, because to have made it plural would have given the

Egyptian king the impression that the Jews worshiped
more than one God. Had they not known that Aleim should
be read in· a plural sense, they would not have deemed it
necessary to explain why it had, in some instances, been
rendered in the singular. ·
Names or titles were, for Jews, as they were for the
Babylonians, not mere appellations, but were revealing of
the things themselves. They sought to make sure that a
name or title truly indicated the character of th~ person
or thing to which it applied, and a change of character or
status was accompanied by a change of name. This was
particularly true of important figures.
When the names of Abram, Sarai, and Jacob were
changed to Abraham, Sarah and Israel, the change indi-
cated an alteration in their status or character. The change
from the name Hebrew, to Israelite, and then to Jew marked
important changes in Jewish religious concepts. Accord-
ingly, When the Holy One appeared to Moses and an-
nounced that henceforth he was to be. known only as
Jahveh (Exodus 6:3), it marked the end of an old and the
beginning of a new concept.
Observe how the incident is described in Exodus. Four
hundred thirty years are supposed to have elapsed since
the Jews had arrived in Egypt, and during that time they
had drifted away from the worship of Jahveh and no longer
remembered him. When Jahveh told Moses to announce his
return, Moses asked whose name he should give as the
source of his information, and Jahveh answered Moses in
the manner of a modern sales manager giving a "pep" talk
to subordinates. ". . . say unto the people of Israel that

I not known to them". (Exodus 6:3) . Tell your people I
am the Lord, says Jahveh, "And I will take you to me for
a people and I will be to you a God". (Exodus 6:7). Speak-
ing as one who had long been absent, he says: "Tell your
people I have surely visited you and seen that which is
done to you in Egypt". (Exodus 3:16). No reason is given
for abolishing the old names Elohim and Al Shaddai, but
these and subsequent passages of Exodus reveal the new
conception of God as being quite unlike that of the old
God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and really amounting
to the beginning of a new religion.
Biblical chronology places the date of this incident at
about 1500 B.C. According to Prof. Stephen H. Langdon,8
however, in the earliest written records of Samaria, the
name was written Yaw or Yah, not Jahveh, and among
Samaritan exiles in Assyria the name invariably appeared
in this form in proper names. As. late as the sixth or fifth
century, B.C., a Jewish colony in Elephantine, in southern
Egypt, wrote in Aramaic and pronounced the name of their
principal god Yaw, whom they associated with the Ca-
naanitish mother goddess Astarte or Anat, as Astarte-Yaw
or Anat-Yaw. The name Yahweh or Jahveh did not exist.
The name Elohim, in its singular form, Eloah, is equiva-
lent to and apparently is derived from the south Arabic
deity II or Ilah, or from the north Arabic deity Allilah or
Allah, who became the supreme god of the Mohammedans.
In the text quoted above, Jahveh appears to be anxious
that his name should be known to every Jew, but, sub-
sequently, a mysterious and very important change took
place. To seek to know his nature or to understand the
mysteries of his work, was sinful. Even his proper name
became a profound secret, and to pronounce it was a gross
sacrilege. When those who knew the holy word referred
to Jahveh, they called him Adonai, meaning "My Lords".
Leviticus 24: 16 clearly implied that to utter the holy name
was punishable even by death, and as late as 130 A.D. an
Abba Saul denied eternal blessings to any one who pro-
nounced the sacred word with the actual consonants.
Whereas the feeling of the Jews toward the old Jahveh
was one of nearness and warmth, it was now succeeded by
a feeling of remoteness, impersonality, and austerity.
&-Myths of all Races, vol. 5, p. 42.
352 SYMBOLS, SEX, AND THE STARS
The nearest approach to an admission that the old
names Jahveh, Elohim and Al Shaddai were titles of dif-
ferent deities rather than alternate titles of the same God,
is contained in the statement of Isaiah (26:13): "O Lord
our God, others beside thee have had dominion over us."
That there were many things relating to the worship
of Jahveh which were carefully withheld from the com-
mon people is confirmed by Jewish traditions that, in
addition to the written Laws and records, there were cer-
tain others which were deemed too profound for popular
understanding. These sacred Laws and records, it is said,
were committed by Moses to Aaron and the priesthood
and by them handed down orally only to the learned from
generation to generation.
Another tradition credits the Chaldean priest-scribe
Ezra with rewriting the Books of Moses after the original
Books had been destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar's army in
the attack on Jerusalem in 586 B.C. This tradition was
certainly known to the author of the Fourth Book of Ezra,
or Esdras, for in that work Ezra laments that because of
the destruction of the holy city, "thy law is burned, there-
fore no man knoweth the things that are done of them,
or the works that shall be done". (Ch. 14, v.21).
As the re-writing of the holy records is described in
IV Ezra, Jahv.eh responds to Ezra's grief and gives him a
cupful of wonderful water which strengthens his memory
and enables his heart to utter understanding and wisdom.
Jahveh then commands him to procure many tablets and
five scribes, and to tell people to stay away for forty days.
Ezra does this and although it is nearly a hundred and
fifty years since the records were destroyed, Ezra miracu-
lously reproduces them by dictation from "memory"; and
within the prescribed time, ninety-four books are written,
twenty-four of which compose the Jewish canon, and are
to be published. But Jahveh commands that the remain-
ing seventy books be kept secret, saying: "These words
shalt thou declare, not hide thee . . . then shalt thou
declare some things openly unto the perfect and some
things shalt thou speak secretly unto the wise . . . the
first that thou hast written, publish openly that the worthy
and unworthy may read it, but keep the seventy last that
thou mayest tell them only to such as be wise among the
people. For in them is the spring of understanding, the
THE TRINITY IN JUDAISM 353
fountain of wisdom and the stream of knowledge".9
(Chap. 14:6, 26, 45).
· In refutation of Ezra it may be pointed out that this
work contains references to events which did not occur
until the first century A.D. Its real author certainly could
not have been the Biblical Ezra. It is obvious that Ezra could
not have re-written more than a small portion of the Scrip-
tures because they are composed of many styles of writing
and give, in many instances, contradictory accounts of the
same events, which would not have been the case had the
entire work come from the hands of one man.
IV Ezra does indicate, however, that even in the first
century, there was a tradition that the Scriptures had been
destroyed, and that part of them contained certain doctrines,
and perhaps described secret rites and practices, which the
priests did not dare make known to the common people.
The destruction of the records seems to be confirmed also,
by II Chronicles 36:18,19, II Kings, Chap. 25, and Jeremiah,
Chap. 52 where it is stated that Nebuchadnezzar's army
took all the holy treasures and other things of value from the
temple, then burned it to the ground. The spoil was taken
to Babylon. It is not stated that the records were saved at
that time and, so far as is known, every vestige of them was
destroyed. Aside from these uncertain references, the exist-
ence and whereabouts of the Scriptures is not mentioned
from the beginning of the Exile until Ezra turned up with
them in Jerusalem.
According to Nehemiah (Chapter 8), Ezra took the
Books from Babylon to Jerusalem and there read them to
the people in 444 B.C., and gained popular acceptance for
them in exactly the same manner that Josiah had secured
acceptance of the Book of Deuteronomy two hundred years
earlier. How Ezra obtained possession of the Books is
not disclosed.

things which are revealed belong to us and to our children for·

It will probably never be possible to determine defi-
nitely when or by whom the existing version of the Penta-
teuch was written, nor will it be possible to ascertain to
what extent it differs from the original records that were
destroyed in the burning of Jerusalem. No inscriptions or
documents from Pre-Exilic times, written with the square
Hebrew letters now in use, have ever been discovered. Fur-
thermore, the forms of writing employed before the Exile
do not appear on any known records of the Post-Exilic
period.. In fact, Origen, St. Jerome, and other authorities
have definitely attributed the invention of the square
letters to Ezra. It is clear, therefore, that all existing
manuscripts were put into their present form after the Exile.
The evidence indicates beyond doubt that during and
after the period of the Exile, a staff of priestly writers in
Babylon was engaged in compiling all of the known Jewish
myths, folklore, history, psalms, proverbs, etc. These
writers included, in addition to this material, many beliefs
and myths which they had derived from the Persians and
Babylonians. In order to revive the national spirit among
the captive Jews, they gave the combined material a height-
ened background which aggrandized the Jewish people, and
made them appear superior to all their neighbors in culture
and religion.
The priestly scribes probably deleted the crudest por-
tions of the record and made suoh other alterations as would
make the work acceptable to the people of their day. Old
beliefs or customs which conspicuously revealed a simi-
larity to the pagan cults were minimized or glossed over,
and whatever information the records contained regarding
the plural titles and the three-fold nature of Jahveh, was
eliminated.
Since the finding in the last century of ancient Baby-
lonian tablets containing myths of the Creation and the
Deluge, it has become certain that the Biblical accounts
of these events were taken from Babylonian sources. None
of the early patriarchs or prophets make any references to
the stories of Creation, the Fall of Adam and Eve, or the
Flood. It is, therefore, altogether unlikely that these stories
found their way into the Scriptures before the sixth or
fifth centuries B.C.
The remainder of Genesis is strongly colored by Baby-
lonian customs and spiritism, and appears to be symbolic
THE TRINITY IN JUDAISM 355
mythology rather than history. The name of Abram seems
to be a reversal of the Hindu name Bram-a. Abram's wi(e
is Sara: Brahma's wife is Saraswati. Brama committed
incest with his sister, Vach: Abram represented Sara as his
sister. Milka, the sister of Sara equates with Milka-tu, an
epithet of Ishtar. These parallels are too close to warrant
their being dismissed as mere coincidence~.
Now that it is known that many of the Laws of Moses
were adapted from the Laws of Hammurabi and that many
important details in the birth, life and acts of the supposed
great law-giver of the Jews may be found in myths about
King Sargon of Babylonia, and the Greek god Bacchus, there
is no longer any doubt about the mythical character of the
Moses legends. Although there may have been a Jewish
leader who bore the name of Moses, the accounts of his
birth, of his miracles in Egypt, of the forty years of wander-
ing in the desert, and of his receipt of the divine commands
from God on Mount Sinai, seem to have been invented for
the purpose of making it appear that the beliefs and statutes
which the priests gave to the people were not of their own
making, but were handed down directly to Moses by Jahveh
himself.
After the first editors had made such revisions, addi-
tions, and deletions as they deemed expedient, later re-
dactors and compilers continued to do likewise until long
after the time when the Pentateuch was translated into
Greek, about 280 B.C. Thus the Books of Joshua, Samuel,
Judges, Kings, Chronicles, and the Books of the Prophets
refer to events which did not occur until years, even cen-
turies, after the time in which they are supposed to have
been written.10 Where several existing manuscripts refer
to the same subject, they frequently differ from one another,
particularly in figures and proper names.
After the beginning of Christianity the task of "im-
proving" the Scriptures was taken up by Christian editors
and translators. Innumerable obscene words were elimi-
nated or mistranslated so that, in many cases, the original
meaning of the text was completely altered.
Nor did the Books of the New Testament escape the
hands of the revisionists. Zealous churchmen inserted
10-See The Old Testament in the Jewish Church, William Robert-
son Smith.
35(; 8YMBOLS, 8}j]X, AND 'l'li}j] 8'1'AllS
verses and even entire sections into the New Testament
writings in order to make it appear that dogmas mentioned
in the forgeries were authorized by the Gospel writers.11 By
the sixteenth century there were in existence hundreds of
conflicting texts of the New Testament. Books which were
at one time considered inspired were later declared spurious.
Both the Catholic and Protestant Churches have recently
prepared new editions of the Bible in which the discrepancies
are increased between the letter and spirit of the Hebrew
and Greek manuscripts and the English translations.

THE END
APPENDIX I
CABALA
THE TERM CABALA (Hebrew Kabbalah), meaning "to
receive" or "traditional lore", sometimes called "Secret
Wisdom", is applied to certain traditional doctrines consti-
tuting a system of religious philosophy or theosophy which
has played an important part in theological literature ever
since the Middle Ages. .
The Cabala is claimed by Jews to be an exposition of
the oral law which Jewish tradition maintains was revealed
to Moses on Mount Sinai and committed to Aaron and other
priests and great prophets and finally recorded in the
Mishna. The Cabala was reputedly transmitted along with
the Law and Talmud and contains a deeper or more in-
itiated style of instruction that was revealed only to the
wise. Other traditions credit the origin of the Cabala to
Adam, Abraham, Moses or Ezra. In comparatively recent
times it has been used to denote a peculiar mystic method
of interpreting the Old Testament.
That many sacred books contained secret lore and were
kept hidden by the wise is clearly indicated by IV Esdras
14,15,16, where pseudo-Ezra is told to publish 24 books of
the canon openly that the worthy and unworthy alike may
read them, but to keep the other 70 books hidden in order
to "tell them only to such as be wise", for in them are the
fountain of wisdom.
On the philosophical side, the Cabala attempted, by a
system of allegorical interpretation, to rationalize the Scrip-
tures and bring them into harmony with universal reason.
It was seen that an all-wise, all-perfect Creator must
be perfect in all of his works; that the creation of an im-
perfect world by a perfect Creator was inconceivable. It
was also obvious that inequalities and imperfections did
exist, and that the hand of fate seemed at times to strike
at random, as though men were like trees in a forest, some
to be cut down early or blighted and under-nourished,
while others thrived. Some people, through no fault of their
own, seemed to suffer undeserved poverty, pain, disease
and oppression; some were born physically or mentally de-
formed, while others, without particular virtues or abilities,
357
mss SYMBOLS, SEX, AND THE STARS
were blessed with lives of health, comfort, wealth and
pleasure.
The aim of the Cabalists was to formulate a conception
of God and his works which would philosophize away the
conflict between theological dogmas and the realities of
life. How this was accomplished constitutes, with the ex-
ception of the Talmud and the sacred books of India, per-
haps the greatest feat of verbal acrobatics ever performed.
The meanings of words were tortured and distorted to make
black mean white, and white mean black. By virtue of the
Cabalistic philosophy, God becomes deserving of praise for
all that is good and is absolved of responsibility for anything
that is bad. He does everything, yet he does nothing; is
everywhere and nowhere; is everything and nothing.
God is above everything, even above being and think-
ing, possessing neither will, intention, desire, thought, lan-
guage or action, since these attributes which belong to man
have limits, whereas God is boundless in every way because
he is perfect. His infinite nature implies absolute unity and
immutability; there is nothing without him; he is there-
fore called En-Soph, without end, boundless, and can neither
be comprehended by the intellect nor described by words
for there is nothing which can grasp and depict him to
us. In this incomprehensibility or boundlessness, God or
En-Soph is in a certain sense non-existent, since so far as
our minds are concerned that which is incomprehensible
does not exist. Hence, without making himself comprehen-
sible his existence could never have been known. He had
therefore to become active and creative in order that his
existence might become perceptible.
But the will to create implies limits and the circum-
scribed and imperfect nature of this world precluded the
possibility of taking it as the direct action of him who can
neither will, nor produce anything but what is like him-
self, boundless and perfect. Yet the beautiful design and
order displayed in the world plainly indicates intelligent
and active will and cannot be regarded as the offspring of
chance, therefore the En-Soph must be viewed as the Creator
of the world in an indirect manner through the medium of
10 "Sephiroth" or intelligences which emanated from the
En-Soph.
From his infinite fullness of light the En-Soph sent
forth at first one spiritual substance or intelligence; this
CABALA 359
intelligence, which existed in the En-Soph from all eternity,
and which became a reality by a mere act, contained the
other 9 intelligences or Sephiroth. Great stress is laid upon
the fact that the 1st Sephira was not created, but was
simply an emanation, and the difference between creation
and emanation is thus defined: in the former a diminution
of strength takes place, while in the latter strength remains
intact.
From the first Sephira emanated the second, from the
second the third, from the third the fourth and so on; one
proceeding from the other to the number 10. These Sephi-
roh form among themselves, and with the En-Soph, a strict
unity, and individually represent different aspects of one
and the same Being, as the flame and spark that proceed
from the fire and that appear different things to the eye,
form only different manifestations of the same fire. Differ-
ing thus from each other simply as different colors of the
same light, all the 10 emanations alike partake of the En-
Soph. These are boundless and yet constitute the first
finite things; so that they are both finite and infinite. They
are infinite and perfect like the En-Soph when he imparts
his influence to them, and finite and imperfect when that
fullness is withdrawn. The finite side of the emanation of
the Sephiroth is absolutely necessary, for thereby the in-
comprehensible En-Soph makes his existence known to
the human intellect, which can grasp only that which has
measure, limit and relation. From their finite side the Sephi-
roth may even be called bodily, and this renders it possible
for the En-Soph, who is immanent in them, to assume
bodily form.
The 10 Sephiroth, of which every one has its own name,
are divided into 3 groups of 3 Sephiroth, each respectively
operating upon 3 worlds, that is, the world of intellect, the
world of souls, and the world of matter. The first operates
in the intellectual world, and consists of
Sephira 1, denominated the Crown or the Inscrutable
Height;
" 2, Creative Wisdom;
" 3, Conceivable Intellect.
The result of the combination of the latter two (as
"father and mother"), is likewise represented as knowledge,
i.e., concrete thought, the realm of mind.
860 SYMBOLS, SEX, AND THE STARS
The second group exercises its power upon the moral
world and consists of:
Sephira 4, called Infinite Grace (also Greatness);
"
"
5, Divine Justice or Judicial Power;
6, Beauty, and is the connecting link between
4 and 5.
The third group exercises its power upon the material
world and consists of:
Sephira 7, called Firmness;
"
"
8, called Splendor;
9, Primary Foundation, and is the connecting
link between the two opposite, numbers
7 and 8.
Sephira 10 is called Kingdom and denotes Providence
or the revealed Deity (Shekinah) which dwells in the midst
of the Jewish people, going with them and protecting them
in their wanderings and captivities.
In order to make the description more intelligible, the
10 Sephiroth are arranged in a diagram, called by Cabalists,
the primeval man, or Adam Kadmon. (Plate 88).
These Sephiroth, or God through them,. created the
lower and visible world, of which everything has its pro-
totype in the upper world. "The world is like a gigantic
tree full of branches and leaves, the root of which is the
spiritual world of the Sephiroth; or it is like a firmly united
chain the last link of which is attached to the upper world;
or like an immense sea, which is being constantly filled
by a spring everlastingly gushing forth its streams."
The Sephiroth, through the divine power immanent in
them, uphold the world which they have created and trans-
mit to it the divine mercies by means of 22 channels. This
transmission of the divine mercies can be accelerated by
prayer, sacrifices, and religious observances; and the Jew-
ish people, by virtue of the revelation and the 613 com-
mandments given to them, have especially been ordained
to obtain these blessings for the whole world. Hence the
great mystery of the Jewish ritual; hence the profound
secrets contained in every word and syllable of the for-
mulary of prayers; and hence the declaration that "the
pious constitute the foundation of the world."

All human souls are pre-existent in the world of the
Sephiroth and are without exception destined to inhabit
human bodies and pursue their courses upon earth for a
certain period of probation. If, notwithstanding its union
with the body, the soul resists all earthly trammels and
remains pure, it ascends after death into the spiritual
Kingdom and has a share in the world of the Sephiroth.
But if, on the contrary, it becomes contaminated by that
which is earthly, the soul must inhabit the body again and
again till it is able to ascend in a purified state, through
repeated trial (restricted by Nahmanides and later Cabalists
to 3 transmigrations).
The apparently undeserved sufferings which the pious
have sometimes to endure here below are simply deigned to
purify their souls. Hence God's justice is not to be im-
pugned when the righteous are afflicted and the wicked
prosper. This doctrine of the transmigration of souls is sup-
ported by an appeal to the injunctions in the Bible that a
man must marry the widow of his brother if he died without
issue, inasmuch as by this is designed, say the Cabalists, that
the soul of the departed one might be born again and finish
its earthly course. Very few souls enter into the world, be-
cause many of the old souls that have already inhabited
the bodies have to re-enter those who .are born, in con-
sequence of their previous bodily existence. This retards
the great redemption of Israel, which cannot take place
till all the pre-existent souls have been upon earth, because
the soul of the Messiah which, like all other souls, has its
pre-existence in the world of the spirits of the Sephiroth,
is to be the last one born at the end of days; which doctrine
is supported by an appeal to the Talmud.
In olden times secret philosophical science and magic
went hand in hand. The principle of the mystic interpre-
tation of the Scriptures is universal. We find it in Philo,
in the New Testament, in the writings of the fathers, in the
Talmud and the Zohar; and the more it departs from the
spirit of the sacred text the more the latter had to be
brought to its support by distortion of its meaning. For
UABALA 863
such operation there are 20 known rules except the exig-
encies of the case and the subjective mass of the senses.
In the meantime the Jews had already, by the arbitrary
character of their alphabet, arrived at all manner of subtle-
ties of which we have isolated examples in their earliest
writings, but which practice is especially established in
post-Zoharic times. From this rose the following species
of Cabalistic transformation:
1st Gematria:
The art of discovering the hidden sense of the text
by means of the numerical equivalents of the letter. It
is called Gematria also when Biblical numbers, for
instance, dimensions of buildings, are expressed in
letters and words made of them.
2nd, the "Figurative" Cabala Notarikon:
Consists of framing with each letter of a word
several new ones, e.g., from the first word of Genesis,
(these can thus be framed) . We thus learn the correct
scientific nature of the universe besides the proper
meaning of the text. Again it consists in taking the
first letter of several words to form a new word, e.g.
Deut. 13:12.
3rd, Temurrah (Permutation):
The anagram, of two kinds. The simple one is a
mere transposition of the letters of a word, e.g., we thus
learn that the angel in Exodus 13:23 was the angel
Michael. The more ingenious kind is that by which,
according to certain established rules, each letter of the
alphabet carries the significance of another; as Aleph
that of Tau, both that of Ayin, then again the letter
may read forward and backward (which constitutes
the alphabet of Athbash) or the first letter with that of
the twelfth, the second with the thirteenth and the re-
verse (making the alphabet called Albam), the more
multifarious these trifles the easier it is to arrive in
every given case at a result and the less wit or thought
is required.
Origin
The only books which can be said to embody the prin-
ciples of the Cabala are two that became the acknowledged
texts of the system in the latter part of the Middle Ages.
:JtJ4 SYMBUL8, Sl<JX, AND THE S'l'AH8
The older of these is the Sephir Yezirah, "the book of the
creation," a short treatise of obscure meaning which is
founded on the Pythagorean idea of the creative numbers
and letters.
The other book is the Sephir haz-Zorah, "book of light,"
which was first printed at Cremona and at Mantua in 1560.
Jewish tradition ascribes it to Simeon ben Jochai, a Galilean
rabbi of the second century A.D., but modern commentators
are inclined to credit the work to a Spanish Jew named
Moses of Leon, in the thirteenth century. Whatever its
origin, it is composed of material of a far earlier date, and
appears to be a syncretism of Jewish, Essene, Gnostic,
Platonic, Pythagorean, Zoroastrian, and Babylonian ideas,
and was probably completed by the eighth century. The
assumption that the Cabala is a product of the thirteenth
century does not take cognizance of the wide use of letters
and numbers in a symbolic and esoteric sense throughout
the East from very early times. Use of the Tetragrammaton-
for JHVH is a familiar instance. In fact the Talmud makes
mention of a secret doctrine imparted to only a few care-
fully selected persons and even applies to it certain names
signifying speculative cosmology and theosophy. The Book
of Jubilees written during the reign of King John Hyrcanus
contains much Cabalistic lore, and the Mishnah (Hag. i,l),
recognized that cosmology and theosophy were esoteric
studies and prescribed that care should be taken "not to
expound the chapter on creation before more than one
hearer, nor that of the heavenly bodies to any but a man
of wisdom and profound understanding."
Exodus 15:26 is an incantation mentioned in the
Mishna, and Exodus 14:19,21 is of great magical importance.
Each verse consists of 72 letters, and one of the mysterious
names of God consists of 72 letters, and these 3 verses are
believed to represent the ineffable name blended, trans-
posed and manipulated to form 72 groups of names of 3
letters, one letter for each of the 3 verses. Again, Numbers
23:22,23, if read backward, form a palindrome, and Psalm
67 is written in the form of an amulet of the 7-branched
candlestick in a peculiar manner with the initial and final
letters combined to form mystic names.
The chief elements of the Cabala are contained in the
Apocalyptic writings of the Essene sect of the second and
first century B.C. According to the historian, Josephus, such
CABALA 365
mystic writings were in the possession of the Essenes who
jealously guarded them against disclosure. This was verified
at an earlier period by Philo Judaeus, himself a Cabalist,
who asserted that the writings were of great antiquity.
Similar opinions of these Essenean writings have been ex-
pressed by Rabbi Adolf Jellinek and other modern scholars.
The dual system of good and evil powers which is
found in the Cabala goes back to the Zoroastrians, and ulti-
mately to Chaldea. The conception of a Cabalistic tree
in which the right side represents light and life and the
left side the source of darkness and impurity was known
to the Gnostics. The theory of Kelippot (scalings of im-
purity) which are prominent in the medieval Cabala are
found in the old Babylonian incantations. K. Kessler, in
describing the beliefs of the Mandaeans, a Gnostic sect
existing in Persia and Mesopotamia, south of Bagdad, as-
serted that the Cabala is derived from the old Babylonian
worship of Marduk (Article: Mandaeans, New Schaff-
Herzog Enc. of Rel. Knowledge, v.13, p.146). Lenormant
(Chaldean Magic, pp. 29-43), was of the opinion that belief in
the magic power of the letters of the Tetragrammaton JHVH
and other names of the deity, originated in Chaldea.
APPENDIX II
ESSENES AND THERAPEUTAE
WTH THE GRADUAL decline and disintegration of the old
pagan religions toward the end of the pre-Christian era,
popular interest became focused upon the newer ideas which
were slowly developing in Greece, Asia Minor and Egypt
(especially in Alexandria). The spread of Greek influence
to the East following the victories of Alexander the Great,
had also brought a corresponding spread of Oriental ideas
to the West. It was a period of great religious confusion
in which a new, popular religion had not yet risen to take
the place of the old worn out beliefs, and new cults and
schools of philosophy were mushrooming up in which the
speculations of Plato, Pythagoras, and other Greek philos-
ophers were mixed with varying degrees of Oriental
mysticism.
The Essenes, Eclectics or Ecclesiastes were a product of
the religious ferment which boiled throughout the eastern
Mediterranean during this period. They were a sect of
Jewish ascetics which seems to have developed from a group
of zealous religionists called Hasidaeans (Hebrew: Chasidim,
meaning pious) . They gathered in numerous small colonies
along the shore of the Dead Sea and scattered throughout
Asia Minor from early in the second century B.C., to about
70 A.D., and consisted of about four thousand. members.
The Essenes practiced complete communism, with com-
mon ownership of property, living in communal groups and
eating communal meals. They ·had churches, monasteries,
bishops, ministers, monks, friars, deacons, who were closely
organized under a strict religious government. Member-
ship was by initiation after a two-year novitiate, with mem-
bers consisting of four classes who observed caste distinc-
tions very much like the Brahman Hindus. The four
classes kept aloof from each other and for a member of
one class to have contact with a member of a lower grade
constituted defilement.
They had all the moral virtues of the Zoroastrians, and
their tenets seem to have been derived from the same
source, but unlike the older sect, the Essenes lived within
866
ESSENES AND THERAPEUTAE 867
their own groups, practiced celibacy and shunned many
of the metaphysical theories of the Parsees. While they
believed in eternal existence of the soul, the Essenes did
not, however, believe in the resurrection of the body.
The sect observed the Sabbath and all important
religious holidays, wore only fine linen, opposed slavery
and animal sacrifice, refused to take an oath but were
held in high esteem because of their unswerving integrity.
They abhorred the use of oil, abstained from meat, prac-
ticed baptism, took daily baths, and, in a sense, worshiped
the sun. They were abstemious, modest, humble, helpful,
devoted to almsgiving, healing, practicing medicine, and
giving other forms of assistance without compensation or
publicity. One of their activities was, as they believed,
the casting out of evil spirits.
The Essenes wrote and distributed tracts, and revered
certain ancient esoteric works, which were said to be de-
rived from their apostolic founders, the secrets of which
books they would not divulge, even under torture. Their
scriptures were believed to possess a hidden meaning,
which they expounded in allegories. They also held the
Books of Moses in extreme reverence, and any disparage-
ment of them was considered highly blasphemous.
The headquarters of the Therapeutae was located at
Lake Mareotis, near Alexandria in Egypt. They had
numerous colonies in Africa and their doctrines were so
similar to those of the Essenes that both sects were gen-
erally considered the same. The Therapeutae, however,
were a purely Egyptian sect and differed from the Essenes
in that their members lived in separate huts, or cells,
were vegetarians, led a less active and more meditative
life, and included nuns or elderly virgins in their mem-
bership. Moreover, the Essenes and Therapeutae were so
similar to the early Christians that they were generally
believed to be of the same sect.
John the Baptist corresponds fully to the description
of an Essene, and if he was not a member of the sect,
he was at least strongly influenced by it. Mark is said
by Eusebius to have been sent to Egypt to teach and
establish churches, and there is no reason to doubt that
while there he had contacts with the Therapeutae and
learned their doctrines.
368 SYMBOLS, SEX, AND THE STARS
St. Paul, a Pharisee who professed to be familiar
with all the ancient religions, knew the Essenes, and in
a small country like Palestine it is doubtful if any of
the Apostles could have avoided knowing them. Paul
bitterly opposed the Essenes in the three epistles to the
Colossians, Ephesians, and Timothy, but like them, he
practiced healing and exorcism, urged his followers not
to take oaths, and preached continence, temperance, truth-
fulness and other virtues identically as the Essenes taught
them. Like the Essenes also and other early cults, Paul
looked upon religion as a mystery, and refused to permit
outsiders to partake of certain parts of the religious services.
Further, he favored the allegorical exposition of the Scrip-
tures as did the Essenes, because "the letter killeth, but
the spirit giveth life". (II Cor. 3:6) . "Which things are
an allegory." (Gal. 4:24) .
Other passages in the Epistles suggest the possibility
that not only may the first Christians have modelled their ·
teachings after those of the Essenes, but that they may
have absorbed many of the Essene churches. If so, the
fact would account for certain passages in the Epistles
and the Acts which have puzzled Biblical scholars. For
instance, the Epistles and The Acts are supposed to have
been written a considerable time prior to the four Gospels
and before the Apostles had suffered martyrdom; they
speak of Paul's work while the church was still in an
early stage of development, when it consisted of only a
few widely scattered groups. The Christian churches ex-
isted as individual cells with important differences in their
doctrines until lrenaeus initiated the work of bringing them
all together in the Catholic Church at the end of the second
century. Yet Paul refers to the branches of the church
with its saints, its martyrs, its bishops, and deacons as
if it were a long established institution. (Acts 15:22, Rom.
12:13, I Cor. 1:2 and 8:4, Eph. 1:15, Col. 2:28). Matthew
1.8:15,16,17 speaks of the authority of the church to settle
disagreements as if it were an old, fully organized, and
authoritative body; and when Matthew 6:3,4 urges the
giving of alms and assistance without praise or publicity
the speaker cannot be distinguished from an Essene.
Before the work of the Apostles was completed and
before any of the Gospels were written, Paul spoke of
the gospel "which ye have heard and which was preached
ESSENES AND THEUAPEUT.AE 369
to every creature which is under heaven" (I Col. 1:23),
thus indicating that he was preaching things with which
his listeners had long been familiar. Again he speaks of
the death and resurrection of Christ "according to the
Scriptures" at a time probably more than fifty years before
the earliest Gospel of the New Testament was written.
(I Cor. 15:4).
In Ephesians 1:15, he addresses his readers as though
he were a stranger who had only recently heard of them,
but in Acts 20: 18 he addresses the leaders of the church,
declaring "I have been with you at all seasons". This is
paralleled by Luke's admission that his Gospel covered
events that had been recorded by many earlier writers.
(Luke 1:1,4).
Acts 12:4 is most extraordinary. It relates that Herod
cast Peter into prison intending after Easter to bring
him forth to the people. There was no Easter celebration
among the Jews, the word Easter had not yet come into
use among the Christians, and Paul's mention of an Easter
festival remains a deep mystery.
That the doctrines of the Apostles had been taught
previously by the Therapeutae is argued in the zeal with
which a certain educated Jew named Apollos, who lived
at Alexandria before any of the Apostles had preached the
Gospel in that city, went to Ephesus and taught of the
Lord in the synagogue, although knowing only the things
of John the Baptist. Afterward Aquilla and Priscilla took
Apollos in hand and explained to him the way of the Lord
more perfectly. (Acts 18:24-28).
The most complete description of the Therapeutae is
given by Philo Judaeus, a semi-Christian Jew, member of
a family of priests and brother of the Jewish magistrate
of Alexandria. Nearly all of Philo's writings have been
lost, but Eusebius, the fourth century church historian,
quotes from them at length and gives it as Philo's opinion
that the Therapeutae were Christians. Not only does
Eusebius accept this opinion of Philo, he declares: "These
facts appear to have been stated by a man who has paid
attention to those that have expounded the sacred writings.
But it is highly probable that the ancient commentaries
which he says they have are the very Gospels and writ-
ings of the Apostles and probably some Expositions of the
370 SYMBOLS, SEX, AND THE STARS
ancient Prophets such as are contained in the Epistle of
the Hebrews and many others of St. Paul's Epistles".
(Euseb., Eccl. History, Bk., Ch. 17, quoted by Rev. C. F.
Cruse).
Most modern writers, while recognizing the strong
influence of the Essenes and Therapeutae on the form of
the Christian organization, its teachings and practices,
nevertheless fail to find a direct connection between the
different groups, and incline to the view that both Josephus
and Philo were mistaken in assuming that Essenes, Thera-
peutae, and Christians were all one body. Eusebius is
thought to have depended too much on the sole opinion
of Philo.
Inasmuch as the Essenes and Therapeutae and all
their works disappeared during the Jewish War in the
first century A.D., the extent to which Christianity was
influenced by the earlier cults must remain one of the un-
known factors in its early development. But that Eusebius
was not alone in thinking that the roots of Christianity
went far into the past may be seen in the writings of
numerous other figures in the early church who held
similar opinions.1
1-Said Lactantius an orthodox Christian: "If there had not been
any one to collect the truth that was scattered and diffused
among the various sects of philosophers and divines into one
and to reduce it into a system, there would indeed be no differ-
ence between him and a Christian." Admission 10.
From a letter of Origen to Celsus: "That the Christian religion
contained nothing but what Christians held in common with
heathens-nothing that was new or truly great." Bellamy's
Translation, Ch. 4.
St. Augustine declared his religion "was before in the world."
Admission 12. .
"There could be found no other difference between paganism
and popish worship before images but only this that names
and titles are changed." Blount's Philostratus, pp. 113-114 quot-
ing Ludovicus Vivus, a learned Catholic.
APPENDIX III
MITHRAISM
0 N BEING TAKEN to Babylon by the Persians, the cult of
Zoroaster encountered the philosophical theologizing of the
Babylonian priests who identified Mithra with the sun
god Shamash. To the cult they added elements of astrology
which later came to have a large part in the ritual. The
cult was then carried to Armenia and Asia Minor, where
it came into contact with other mystery cults then popular,
the chief of which was that of Cybele. Between 250 and
100 B.C., its ritual and doctrine probably took the form
which it afterward retained.
The cult was probably taken to Rome by soldiers re-
turning from Asia Minor and by visiting merchants about
70 B.C., and became widespread among Rome's slaves, civil
servants, and soldiers, who carried it to Africa, Europe,
and even to Scotland. Popular among the common people,
the new religion also claimed followers among senators and
other high officials. Nero, Aurelian, and Emperor Julian
were adherents. Diocletian, Galerius, and Licinius dedicated
a temple to Mithra in 307 A.D.
In the western form of the cult, Mithra was no longer
the chief Yazata of Ormuzd but became the head of an
independent religion. He was the guardian of truth, fidelity
and justice; lord of the countryside, strong, sleepless, and
possessing full knowledge; his piercing eyes saw all things,
therefore he was witness of oaths and good faith, chastising
liars but protecting those who kept faith.
The births of Mithra and Christ were celebrated on
the same day, the births being honored in each case as
having taken place in a cave. In both Christianity and
Mithraism the central figure was a Mediator who was one
of a Trinity: in both, there was a sacrifice for the benefit
of humanity, and the purifying power of blood from the
sacrifice was of basic importance. Both Christians and
Mithraists regarded Sunday as sacred.
Regeneration, or second birth, was a fundamental
tenet in both faiths. In both faiths, also, the conception
of the relation of the worshipers to each other was the
an
372 SYMBOLS, SEX, AND THE STARS
same: they were brothers and both had sacraments, among
which were included baptism and a communal bread and
the cup. Both had mysteries from which the lower orders
of initiates were excluded; ascetic ideals were common to
both. Both religions taught the doctrine of immortality,
heaven and hell, the resurrection from the dead, judgment
after death, the final conflagration by which the world is
to be consumed, and the ultimate conquest of evil. "We
may say that if Christianity had been arrested in its growth
by some mortal malady, the world would have been
Mithraic. . . . It needed to destroy it the terrible blows
struck at it by the Christian empire." (Marcus Aurelius,
p. 432, London, n.d.).
The worshipers formed small mithreum, like modern
lodges, the groups of members generally not exceeding 100,
and often organized as burial associations in order to achieve
legal status. Brotherhood, loyalty, and equality were
stressed. Lustrations and libations were frequent. Women
were not admitted to membership.
There were seven degrees of initiation in which the
neophyte assumed the names of raven, griffin, soldier, lion,
Persian, courier of the sun, and father. On certain occa-
sions they donned a costume symbolic of the bird or animal
imitated and simulated its actions, as was the custom in
other mysteries of the period. Those who passed the grade
of lion were "participants" because to them was adminis-
tered the sacrament of bread and water commemorative
of Mithra's banquet at the end of his labors. This partici-
pation was supposed to impart immortality.
The guardian bishop went through a ceremony of
espousing the church in accordance with the old mystery
in which was recited the formula "Hail to thee, new spouse,
Hail new light." His mitre was called a crown or tiara
and it corresponded to the headdress of Mithra. The Mi-
thraic priests wore red military boots, said to be emblem.:.
atical of the spiritual warfare in which they were en-
gaged. This may have more than an incidental relation
to the custom in the Roman Catholic Church of placing red
military boots on the feet of the deceased popes when they
are prepared for the funeral ceremony.
The four elements, fire, water, earth and air were deified
and worshiped, and the sun, moon and planets were held
in hiBh reverence. Each day of the week was believed to
MITHRAISM 878
be controlled by a different planet and with each a metal
was associated, while the signs of the zodiac, which took
creation under control, marked the devotions of the month.
Kronos (unending time) figured as the lion-headed human
figure with four wings, sexless and passionless, his legs
and body in the embrace (sometimes 6-fold) of a serpent
receiving the motion of the sun in the ecliptic.
In many of the monuments of Mithra there are two
torch bearers, which are to be interpreted as the double
incarnations of Mithra with himself, forming a triple
Mithra. One of these with torch erect symbolized the grow-
ing sun and life: Mithra himself in the center was the
sun at noon and the figure of life; the other torch bearer,
with torch turned downward, was the declining sun and
death.
Mithra was pictured as born of a rock and sculptures
represents him issuing from a rock with knife and torch
in his hands. It was then his task to demonstrate his in-
vincible strength and his first trial was with the sun,
whom he conquered, then adorned with the rayed crown
and made his faithful ally. His next labor was with a
bull and this became the central point of the Mithraic
myth, the portrayal of which furnished the set piece in
Mithraic art. .· :.:·':£~.ill
The bull was caught and mastered after a severe struggle
and dragged ·by Mithra to his cave, whence it escaped,
and Mithra was commanded to pursue and sacrifice it,
which he reluctantly did. From its body then sprang all
kinds of useful herbs, and from its blood the grape which
furnished the wine of the mysteries; from its spinal mar-
row came wheat, while its soul became Silvanus, guardian
of herds who is also a leading figure in the mysteries. The
bull was, therefore, a source of life and for this reason took
its place in the Mithraic ceremony.
Meanwhile, the first human pair had been created
and were under Mithra's protection. This protection was
necessary because Ahriman was assailing humanity with
drought, flood, conflagration, pestilence and other calami-
ties, and therefore had to be overcome. The ending of
Mithra's labors was the occasion of a celebration and last
supper after which Mithra retired to heaven, whence he
still protects the worshipers. But the battle between Ahura
Mazda and Ahriman continues so far as humanity is con-
374 SYMBOLS, SEX, AND THE STARS
cerned. Life is warfare and to win, the faithful must ever
obey Mithra's commandments.
Shortly after Constantine made Christianity the religion
of the Roman state, the Christians demanded the suppres-
sion of the Mithraic cult, and before long no one dared
to look at the rising or setting sun and farmers and sailors
were afraid to observe the stars. At times the persecution
of the cult was bloody and the remains prove that the
priests were sometimes slain a:nd their corpses buried in
the mithreum in order to desecrate the site.
APPENDIX IV
TALMUD
THE TALMUD 1s the work which embodies the canonical
and civil law of the Jews. It consists of the Mishna (oral
repetition), a systematic collection of religious decisions
developing the laws of the Old Testament, and the Gemara,
(supplement), containing a mass of opinions, comments, and
illustrations, legal and otherwise.
The Mishna forms the foundation of the Gemara and is
divided into six sedarim, or orders, containing a number
of tracts, or massektoth. Further material relative to the
Mishna is preserved in the Tosephta (Aramaic, "addition"
or "appendix"), and the Midrash. Together with the Tar-
guni.im they represent the orthodox rabbinical literature
connecting the Old Testament with medieval Judaism.
Midrash means to search, investigate, explain, and,
primarily, the study or exposition of the Scriptures. It
attempts to go beyond the mere literal sense; to penetrate
into the spirit of the Scriptures and to examine the text
from all sides in order to formulate interpretations which
are not immediately obvious. The text is interspersed with
maxims, ethical sayings of illustrious men, parables,
legends, biographical sketches of Biblical persons, philo-
sophical discussions, poetical allegories, symbolical inter-
pretations, etc. Legal prescriptions form the Halakoth;
and free interpretations compose the Hagadoth. The first
are the rules of conduct which must be observed; the
others are merely considered to be "what is said" by the
sages.
Beginning as a supplement to, or interpretation of, the
Mosaic Law, the Mishna developed into such a voluminous
mass of contradictory opinions and hair-splitting legalism
that a second supplement became necessary to explain the
first. "This task was carried out by the Amoraim, or
Gemarical doctors, whose very singular illustrations, opin-
ions, and doctrines were subsequently to form the Gemara,
i.e., the Palestinian and Babylonian: a body of men charged
with being the most learned and elaborate triflers that ever
brought discredit upon the republic of letters.... With
375
376 SYMBOLS, SEX, AND THE STARS
unexampled assiduity did they seek after or invent obscur-
ities and ambiguities, which continually furnished pretexts
for new expositions and illustrations, the art of clouding
texts in themselves clear having proved ever less difficult
than that of elucidating passages the words or the sense
of which might be really involved in obscurity."1
The Talmud fills more than sixty volumes and repre-
sents the labor of several hundred rabbins over a period
of about five centuries. The work is divided into two great
recensions, consisting of a Babylonian Talmud, written in
eastern Aramaic dialect and a Palestinian Talmud, written
in western Aramaic. The western version never became as
popular as the eastern, and now survives in a very
incomplete form.
Eventually, many of the rabbins became awed by the
immensity of the product of their labors, and considered
the Mishna and Gemara more important than the Mosaic
Law. "The 'written law,' " they said, "is like water, the
Mishna is like wine, and the Gemara is like spiced wine".
But modern authorities are inclined to take a more critical
view of these writings. McClintock and Strong,2 for in"'
stance, describe the Babylonian Talmud as being "composed
in a dialect neither Chaldaic nor Hebrew, but a barbarous
commixture of both of these and of other dialects, jumbled
together in defiance of all the rules of composition or of
grammar, it affords a second specimen of a Babylonian
confusion of languages. ... Abounding, moreover, in fan-
tastic trifles and rabbinical reveries, it must appear almost
incredible that any sane man could exhibit such acumen
and such ardor in the invention of those unintelligible
comments, in those nice scrupulosities, and those ludicrous
chimeras which the rabbins have solemnly published to
the world."
In their efforts to further define the Mosaic Law dealing
with relations between men and women, the framing of
opinions pertaining to sexual functions, particularly those
of women, became an obsession with the Talmudists. Entire
sections of the Mishna and Gemara were devoted to the
sexual peculiarities of women, much of the text being so

obscene that it is considered too shocking for English-
speaking readers, and consequently, quotations from it are
given only in Latin.
Nothing that occurs in human life seems to have been
too unimportant for consideration by the dictators (Amo-
raim), the opinionists (Seburaim), and the sublime doctors
(Geonim), and every fact or idea, however trivial, which
came to their attention became the subject of a learned
opinion or decree in which facts were mixed with errors
in almost every department in science, natural history,
chronology, genealogy, logic and morals.
The learned rabbins wrote lengthy treatises specifying
the proper time and manner for giving blessings, offering
prayers, and paying tithes; for planting and harvesting
crops; for the cultivation of fruit trees, the correct perform-
ance of social and household duties, etc., including such
details as how and when to place a cover on a stew-pot,
how to weave, sew, cook, wash, tie and un-tie knots, fold
garments and make beds, clean pillows, strain wine, light
lamps, pick up crumbs from the table, and thousands of
other activities equally trivial.
It is improbable that the average Jew ever observed
more than a small portion of the opinions and legal pre-
scriptions handed down by the learned doctors, because to
become even slightly familiar with all of them would have
required years of study. Even so, the lives of the people
were metaphorically fenced in by countless regulations and
taboos which conditioned and regimented their acts and
thoughts from birth to death.
Targum
After the Exile it became the practice to read the Law
in public with the addition of an oral paraphrase in the
Babylonian dialect. The paraphrase was called Targum,
meaning translation or interpretation, and was designed to
meet the need1 of the unlearned who had ceased to under-
stand the Hebrew of the Old Testament. There are three
Targumim of the Pentateuch, the oldest of which was
highly esteemed in the Babylonian divinity schools and,
later, in Palestine. Its authorship has been attributed to a
teacher named Onkelos and it is called the Babylonian
Targum or the Targum of Onkelos.
878 SYMHOLS, SEX, AND ~'HE S~'ARS
Much of the Jerusalem Targum consists of fragments
or remnants which are not contemporary, and many pas-
sages contain several versions of the same verses, while
certain sections are designated additions. Consequently, it
is frequently called the Fragmentary Targum. Many of the
fragments consist of single words, or portions of verses,
fused together. They probably were originally comments
written without system or completeness by copyists on the
margin of the Onkelos Targum.
A second Jerusalem Targum, also called the Jonathan,
or pseudo-Jonathan Targum, dates from about the seventh
century A. D., and attempts to correct and supplement the
Targum of Onkelos. In h.is translation from the Hebrew,
Jonathan is careful to avoid anthropomorphisms and to
give the complete sense by very simple metaphors, although
his method is not as thorough as that of Onkelos. Jonathan
also attempts to gloss over or modify all Old Testament
passages which seem derogatory to the ancestors of Israel,
and to amplify everything which redounds to their credit.
Other Targumim exist for the Psalms, Proverbs, and
the Books of the Prophets, Job, and Chronicles, but they
are almost entirely imitations of earlier works. ·
APPENDIX V
ZOROASTRIANISM
THE HISTORICITY OF Zoroaster was long in doubt but emi-
nent authorities are now inclined to the view that he was
an historical character, born between 660 and 630 B.C. in
Bactria (Iran) or in Azerbaijan west of the Caspian Sea.
The religion which Zoroaster formulated was derived
largely from beliefs of the Brahmans which had long been
creeping westward from India. The teachings of Zoro-
aster are found in the Zend-Avesta, which are written in
one of the seven branches of the Indo-European family
of languages closely resembling Sanscrit. The language in
which the principal translations and commentaries were
originally written is Pahlavi, the language of medieval
Persia. The alphabet is Semitic, and the vocabulary of the
documents is in Aramaic and Perisan.
As enunciated by Zoroaster, Ahura Mazda (Ormuzd
in the shortened form), "the god of light", is the creator,
omniscient, holy, beneficent, eternal in the full sense; be-
stower of health and responsible for happiness; bestower
of all that is pure and good. He is opposed by his brother
Angra Mainyu (or Ahriman), "hostile spirit", the Prince
of Darkness, who represents ignorance, death, and all that
is evil in the world. In the corrflict between the two brothers,
the old mythical struggle between Light and Darkness
develops into an ethical religion and becomes a struggle
between Good and Evil.
Man is considered of 5-fold character: (1) spirit or
angelology; (2) knowing power; (3) conscience; (4) soul,
perhaps moral choice, and (5) fravashi, which seems to be
the post mortem personality.
In his creative work, Mazda gave man a free will, and,
therefore, holds him fully responsible for his deeds, in
contradistinction to his status in the older religions in which
every act was assumed to be determined by a god. There
is no pardon for sin apart from the fact that a convert is
relieved of the consequences of sins committed prior to his
conversion, when he was ignorant of the religion. Yet man
is not left wholly alone in his efforts to achieve goodness,
879
380 SYMBOLS, SEX, AND THE STARS
for guardian angels assist him in overcoming temptation
and in avoiding the pitfalls set by the demons. By
a true confession of faith, by word and deed, he may im-
pair the work of Ahriman (Satan), and establish a claim
to reward from Mazda. Sacred virginity is considered ir-
religious; self-mortification is regarded as sinful; and later
writings seem to be directed against Christian asceticism.
Inhibitions of sexual intercourse, where they exist, rest
in the main upon considerations of healthful propriety.
Mazda created six Amesha ·Spentas (Amphaspands),
"immortal beneficents" as servants to assist him in the
guidance of the world in his conflict with Ahriman. These
are personifications of virtues or abstract qualities, their
names signifying "Good Thought", "Best Righteousness",
"Desired Kingdom", "Holy Harmony", "Saving Health", and
"Immortality". The first three are male and the second
three female. To offset the Amphaspands, Ahriman creates
devas, archdemons or evil spirits.
Beside the Amesha Spentas there are a number of other
characters which receive special honor. Notable are the
Yazatas, angels, abstractions or personifications of natural
elements, bodies or qualities. They are assigned to the
protection of elements in the world such as animals, metals,
fire, earth, water, vegetation.
The greatest of the Yazatas is the "thrice born" Mithra,
"the eye of Mazda", the knower of truth, witness to oaths
and contracts, judge of the de.ad, the god that gives victory
to armies and is the next in importance to Mazda himself.
As Mediator and Benefactor, he is associated with the light
and warmth of the sun and was probably originally a
solar god.
Other figures among the Yazatas are Sraosha, "abun-
dance", Rashnu Razista, "genius of truth", Gosurvan (Gos,
Drvaspa), as the cow or bull, the abstract representation
of the animal kingdom; Kavaem Hvareno, "kingdom majesty",
or "royal glory"; Ashi Vanguhi, "piety, wealth, health and
intellectual vigor", and Arstat, "truthfulness". Animals are
given particular consideration and it is sinful to kill them.
Next to Mithra among the Yazatas is Atar, or fire, the
purest of the elements. He is the messenger of Mazda, the
holiest spirit, and stringent regulations are drawn against
his defilement in material form. Fire is considered a rep-
ZOJ:toAS'l'H.IAN JSl\I 881
resentation of the divine essence of earth and the priests
are fire priests. It is the essence of life burning in the
bodies of men and animals, in the stems of plants, in air
and paradise itself, but, as with Agni in India, the con-
ception varies from material to spiritual and from personal
to impersonal. From the cult associated with this element,
the Zoroastrians were erroneously called "fire worshipers".
Of special significance is the doctrine of Saoshyant,
usually rendered "savior" who is to come, having been
foreshadowed by virgin born prophets in the line of Zoro-
aster. He is to end the battle with evil, preside over the
resurrection and accomplish the regeneration of the world.
After death, the soul remains near the body for three
days in pain or joy, its experience depending upon the
individual's actions during life. On the fourth day at dawn
it takes up its journey to its final home, being cheered
on its way by delightful experiences; and is met by a
beautiful maiden, the personification of its good deeds done
in life, and is guided to the Chinvat Bridge, where Mithra,
Sraosha, and Rashnu weigh its good and bad deeds in the
scales of judgment. These experiences of the soul clearly
foreshadow the Christian doctrine of a Day of Judgment.
Then the soul passes to the bridge of angels. Being
finally received by Vohu Monah, the soul passes before
Mazda and the Amphaspands to take up its permanent
abode with the righteous. But the wicked soul is met by
an ill-favored hag, and, after judgment, is dragged to the
depths of darkness. There is, however, a place called Hames-
tagan, the abiding place of souls whose good and evil
deeds balance. These souls and the evil they have com-
mitted abide in their places until the last day, when the
human denizens of hell, having been purified, join with
the Hamestagan and are placed in the new heaven. Con-
version and final happiness are, therefore, the goal ulti-
mately reached, and hell is not eternal torture or retribution.
On the day of final judgment Saoshyant completes the
last victory over evil, and enters upon a reign of 57 years.
At the expiration of that period, man will have become
spiritualized, requiring neither food or drink. A star will
fall from the heavens and its heat will melt the terrestrial
metals, and the molten mass thus formed will course over
the earth, bringing about the purification of man and render
882 SYMBOLS, SEX, .AND THE STARS
the earth a mountainless plain. Then will take place the
resurrection: all the souls will gather and the wicked shall
su:ffer three days in hell. Souls will pass through the molten
flood, which, to the good, will be a pleasant experience and
to the evil, extremely painful. Then will begin the one,
undivided kingdom of Mazda in heaven and earth.
In addition to the triad of Mazda, Mithra, and Ahriman,
the Mazdean religion contains one other member who has
no essential function in the plan but was possibly adapted
because of the Oriental custom of including a virgin god-
dess in the religious pattern.. She is Anahita, or Ardvi
Sura Anahita, "the spirit of waters", "the high, powerful,
immaculate being", the heavenly spring and source of all
terrestrial waters, located on the summit of a mythical
mountain in the region of the stars and the habitation of
many holy heroes before and after the prophet. Having
power to fertilize the earth, she uses this power beneficently
for the good of animals and mankind and is the genius
of marriageable girls and parturient women. Her cult came
to have a widespread independent vogue in Armenia and
Asia Minor, where she became confused with the great
mother goddess. The Greeks identified her with Athene
and Aphrodite.
Much attention was also given to the stars, and the
"star Yazatas" were of great importance, these being the
fixed stars, not the planets, which were regarded as creations
of Ahriman.
The Zoroastrians, driven out of Persia by the Moham-
medans in 641 A.D., eventually settled in Bombay, where
they are known as Parsees. At the present time there are
perhaps 8000 members of this sect in Persia while in Bom-
bay the Parsees number approximately 100,000. Many of
them are wealthy merchants.
Among the features of Zoroastrianism which were later
to become parts of Christian religious thought were the soul,
free will, heaven and hell, angels and devils, confession,
baptism, rosaries, purgatory, a mediator, a virgin born
savior, catechisms, a day of resurrection, and final judgment.
