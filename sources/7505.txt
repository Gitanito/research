The horizon was dark brown and twilight prevailed.

This lasted, and lasted...

Then the pains began to ease, the odors became perfumed, and the colors went progressively from brown to a clear blue and I was very happy to be going where I was going.

Suddenly a shadow started walking on my right side.

That lasted some time, and I was more and more happy, without pain anywhere.

The shadow at my side spoke to me, asking, 'Are you sure you want to go on?'

I went on a few paces, and then I turned around, without replying, and began to go back where I had come from.

My sufferings revived, and the fragrance became disgusting odors and the colors became dark again.

I woke up very angry, furious, furious to have 'returned'.

I still feel the same, to some extent.
