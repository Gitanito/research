&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  A very personal theology can emerge as a result of an  individual's deepest grief.&nbsp;&nbsp;   Experiencing despair, hopelessness, or anger enables a person to delve  into those inner emotions we sometimes neglect when life appears to be going  well.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Just such an emotionally-shattering experience caused  Peter Novak to write The Division of Consciousness.&nbsp;  Novak's young wife died just a few months  after the birth of their daughter, and he was gripped by a devastating grief.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Three dreams of his wife's seeming  &quot;progression&quot; in the afterlife helped him adjust to losing her.&nbsp;  The last dream, occurring years after her  death,&nbsp;  was the impetus for him to  investigate the concepts of death and life after death.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Not satisfied with what he regarded as the two  traditional views of life after death--the heaven-hell duality and  reincarnation--he began a serious search into the sacred writings of various  world religions (past and present), Freudian and Jungian psychology,  Swedenborgianism, near death experiences, past-life regressions, contemporary  science, and the recent discoveries at Nag Hammadi and an increased  understanding of Christian Gnosticism.&nbsp;   After he collected&nbsp;  and sifted  extensive data from these studies,&nbsp;  his  theory of the division of consciousness emerged.&nbsp;  Taking his cue from the Native American ni and nagi, the Egyptian Ba  and Ka, and the ancient Chinese hun  and p'o&nbsp;  concepts, and finding what  he believes to be a &quot;division&quot; understanding in ancient  Zoroastrianism, classical Greek, Swedenborg's visions, various philosophers and  psychologists he concluded that at death there is a &quot;division&quot; of the  individual, which results in the separating of the tripartite nature of the  individual--body, soul, spirit. These arguments are succinct, and except for a  few instances&nbsp;  of debatable data  interpretation, easily support his tenet.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  For many in the West, the difference between the soul and  the spirit is not clearly delineated.&nbsp;   In fact, many will use the terms interchangeably.&nbsp;  Novak understands the soul to be the  unconscious, the seat of the instincts, the feeling, subjective part of the  individual while he sees the spirit as the conscious, the seat of the  &quot;free mind&quot;, the thinking, objective part of the individual.&nbsp;  Prior to this &quot;division,&quot; he  concludes, humanity &quot;would have possessed a complete and unbroken mental  record going all the way back to its very beginnings.&quot;(p. 66)&nbsp;&nbsp;  There existed a Primordial Unity of the  soul which divided when the spirit asserted a dominance over the soul, which  would cause the soul to be sublimated and &quot;unconscious.&quot; Thus, the  original separation of humanity from the divine would be that time in which the  soul is unable or unwilling to provide the necessary negative inputs--a process  of free will which resulted in the soul submerging to the unconscious.&nbsp;  The varied myths of a deity or deities  struggling over chaos were attempts at explaining this split.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  From this understanding he expands his theory to include  the classic Christian concepts of the Fall, Original Sin, Redemption, theodicy,  the Resurrection of Jesus, and the Resurrection of the physical body.&nbsp;  In his explanation as to how the division  theory helps to explain, and in some cases even simplifies, traditional  Christian theological tenets, he maintains a consistent point of view.&nbsp;  It is at this point that many of the more  conservative readers might find objections. &nbsp; Whether one can agree with his basic premise, his approach of  delineating and defending the division of consciousness is logical and  consistent.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Novak not only writes from the heart but also from&nbsp;  extensive research into areas not normally  conquered by lay people or a non academician student of religion.&nbsp;  Though his research emerged as a result of  personal experience,&nbsp;  his&nbsp;  scholarship is evident as he interprets data  from an eclectic, widely varied wealth of information.&nbsp;&nbsp;  His book is an exhaustive compilation of  the thoughts of many throughout our world and throughout time upon the timeless  questions of life and death and the mysteries of the next life.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Is his Division Theory true?&nbsp;  That, of course, must be answered by the individual.&nbsp;  Even Novak admits that his conclusions do  not come from a vision from God or other heavenly source.&nbsp;  Regardless of agreeing with his conclusions  or not, the reader will find a wealth of information to supplement&nbsp;  and challenge old concepts and theories.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Any seeker of truth should read Novak.&nbsp;  He will help the beginning researcher to  form a basis for deeper study and will challenge the advanced researcher to go  beyond personal biases as the search for truth continues.
