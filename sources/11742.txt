I had had surgery a week before.  I developed an infection, and had a bleeding vessel in my abdomen.  Suddenly, I began to bleed.  I had been in pain for quite some time before this event, but at the time, I was not feeling any discomfort.  I was an inpatient at the hospital at the time.  I heard the nurse saying my blood pressure, and hearing the numbers go down.  She said, ‘I can't get a pulse or blood pressure, we're losing her!’  I watched the nurses pack gauze into my wound, and run to get blood, twenty-two units.  It wasn't frightening at all.  I felt regret thinking I would be leaving my family and friends behind.
