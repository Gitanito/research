  After a horrible 10 year   marriage, I spent 5 years working hard at a Police Department. For fun,   I'd&nbsp;dance with my gay buddies. I dated cops.&nbsp; I had traveled all over the USA as   a child due to my father's job.&nbsp; We landed near Washington DC when Dad was   promoted to a desk job. So I went to high school in Virginia.&nbsp; I ended up in the   Shenandoah Valley for college.&nbsp; It was beautiful.&nbsp; In my late 20s, I lived in   Kenya for 3 months. I had always wanted to go to Africa.

  On New Year's Eve, 1986, my best   girlfriend &amp; I were having an all girl's celebration at her Mom's house. Her   mother is a brilliant chef, so we were enjoying coconut shrimp &amp; chocolate torte   &amp; all kinds of other treats.&nbsp; I had brought along a National Enquirer.&nbsp; The   Headline said &quot;What Will Happen in 1986?!&quot;&nbsp; My friend took my photo as I was   saying &quot;You will become a lawyer &amp; I will meet my Good Husband.&quot;

  The next week, I auditioned for a   play. I hadn't done any acting since college (over 10 years).&nbsp; As I was waiting   to be called onstage, the double doors of the theater flew open, bringing in a   blast of snow.&nbsp; A man with long platinum blonde hair &amp; a reddish beard stood in   the doorway.&nbsp; He was tall &amp; wore a grey beret.&nbsp; Everyone shouted at him &quot;Hey,   Pete!!&quot;&nbsp; We never stopped talking from that moment onward. Turns out, when I was   in Shenandoah, Virginia, I was invited to a big party at his college (William &amp;   Mary) which he had organized (a Spring dance outdoors)&nbsp;but I had to work so   didn't go. When I was in Waa, Kenya, I had a chance to go to Goa, India.&nbsp; He was   in Goa &amp; had the chance to go to Waa. We both chose not to do those trips.&nbsp; We   both came to Boulder, Colorado in June, 1982 for a Jack Kerouac conference.&nbsp; We   were onstage at the same time but didn't meet yet.&nbsp; One night my girlfriend &amp; I   were dancing in a nightclub where lawyers hung out--a long haired, offbeat guy   came up &amp; started talking to us. We ended up giving him a ride home. Lo &amp;   Behold, 5 years later, it turned out that was Peter, the man I met at the   theater.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have now been married 20 years.&nbsp; Every day is amazing, despite ups   &amp; downs financially. We've traveled to Scotland, Iceland, Germany, Austria &amp; are   utterly blessed to have found each other.&nbsp; There are so many &quot;coincidences&quot; of   times we could've met but didn't just yet.&nbsp; What a Joy! (by the way, my   girlfriend did become a lawyer!)&nbsp;      </body>
