  This journal was an effort to demonstrate the "affinity" between western and Indian philosophy and religion.  It was largely given over to "exchanges" -- articles borrowed from European and American journals like Metaphysical Magazine -- on topics like animal magnetism, spiritualism, telepathy, Tolstoy, Mollie Fancher's clairvoyance, mind cure, prenatal influence, the Rosicrucians, Emerson,  psychic experiments, the nature of dreams, somnambulism, mind-building, psychometry, and the like.  With these were interspersed articles on more properly "Indian" subjects like the Bhagabat (sic) Gita, Vedanta, modern Indian magic, and Patanjali.  The process of exchange was reciprocal and articles from the journal were frequently copied in "Important Matter from Our Foreign Exchanges" in the Progressive Thinker, and in other western journals.  Noted in "List of Advance Thought Publications," The New Cycle, March 1900.  BL; National Library of Australia.
