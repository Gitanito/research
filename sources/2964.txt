MESMERISM THE GIFT OF GOD
&c.
Londoll, June, 1843.
Mv DBAR FruBND,
Yon are aware that my attention has lately been directed to a Ser-
mon, published in the Penny Pulpit, and actively circulated through
the country, entitled "Satanic Agency and Mesmerism," and alleged
to have beeJ1 preached in Liverpool by the Rev. Hugh :M:•Ncile.
This sermon is not published under the authority, or with the con-
sent of Mr. M•Neile, and so far he is not responsible; but inasmuch
as its publication and sale are matters of general notoriety, and that
application having been mauc to him from a highly respectable quarter
for a disavowal of its contents, though he did not acknowledge them,
as he took no steps to deny them; and as we are informed that the
short-hand writer, from whose notes this sermon was printed, is pre-
pared to make an affidavit of the accuracy of his report, I am led to
believe that some such a sermon, in the smne, or nearly similar lan-
gnnge, was actually preached by Mr. M'Neile.
Now a sermon put forth with tho prestige of such a. name, however
unfairly and unwarrantably made use of, certainly deserves every
respectful consideration. The number, moreover, of Mr. M•Ncile's ad-
mirers, and tho zeal• with which they distribute this publication
among the thoughtful and tho religious, give additional importance to
its eontents ; and when it has come to my own knowledge that several
parties have been prevented from a.dopting or witnessing.the curative
effects of Mesmerism, through scruples of conscience raised by this very
discourse, I was :prepared to bestow upon it a. much more careful pe-
rusnl than intrinsically it deserved.
Believing, then, as I tlo most fully, tl1at Mesmerism is a mighty
remedial agent, mercifully vouchsafed by the bencficient Creator for

emissaries circulate this sermon, when they learn that some thousand copies
have been sold, and a reprint called for.

tliC mitigation of human misery-a remedy to be employed, like every
other remedy, prayerfully, thankfully, and with a humble dependence
on the will of Him who sent the chastisement, and can alone remove
it; having daily reason, too, to bless God for the introduction of this
very remedy within the circle of my own family, it is difficult for me to
express the amazement, the regret, the feelings akin to something like
shame, with which I first read this most deplorable publication. And
knowing the delusion under which so many labour on this question-a
delusion which, ns the natural result of the vulgarest ignorance and
superstition, the unfortunate language of this sermon l1ns tended so
greatly to foster, I feel it to be nothing short of a sacred Christian
duty laid upon me to use my endeavours to lessen the error. And if
these few pages should be the means of removing the prejudices ofbut
one family, or of alleviating the pains of but one afflicted SJ.Ifferer,
through his adoP.tion of the Mesmeric power, the knowledge of it would
give me a gratification, which I would not exchange for all the elo-
quence and popularity of Mr. M'Neile.
In writing, therefore, in behalf of Mesmerism, in opposition to the
views of Mr. M•Neile, I hope to secure an indulgent hearing by
stating that I am neither Deist, Materialist, nor Rationalist ; that I be-
long to no school of philosopl1y, "falsely so called," but am a humble,
though I fear, unprofitable Christian. Nay, not only am I a believer
in the same Gospel with Mr. M•Neile, but a member and minister in
the same Church, entertaining nearly the same doctrinal views, adopt-
ing nearly the same Scriptural interpretations, and holding certainly in
equal abhorrence with himself everything of an irreligious and infidel
character. I think it desirable to state thus much, though, unfortu-
nately, of an egotistical charncter, because the prejudices of many pious
nnd well-meaning persons have unhappily connected the practice or
belief of Mesmerism with antichristian or Deisticnl views.
To much, therefore, of the former part of this sermon no Scriptural
reader can offer any objection. Where it presents from the Bible a
digest of the evidence for Satanic agency, and of the condition of the
fallen angels, and of their power over the race of man ; where their
fearful spiritual influence on our depraved nature and deceitful hearts
is laid bare in nil its deformity; to nil this the well-instructed Chris-
tian tremblingly subscribes. When, therefore, Mr. M'Neile is alleged
to state, "not only that there did exist such a thing ns Satanic agency,
but that it continued to exist after the incarnation of Christ; that it
continued to exist amongst men after the resurrection of Christ ; that
it is predicted to exist until the second coming of Chrillt ;" to all
these and similar positions I am not }>reparcd to express any dissent.
But when, from these premises, he goes on to assert, that certain pe-
culiar facts, recorded in Chambers' Edinburgh, Jout·nal, and of the
t·enlity of which he does not appcn~. to do.ubt, nrc, "beyond all ques-
tion, beyond the course of nature, ol', 111 other words, supernatural
and the result of some miraculous or diabolical agency, what thinking
mind docs not sec that such a conclusion is most illogical and absurd?
Is there no other alternative 1 Is nothing else possible ? Is nothing
Digitized by Coogle
else probable ? Before so strong and momentous a decision were thus
peremptorily pronounced, should not a fnir and candid man at least
stoop to enquire, to investigate, to consider calmly, whether some
better explanation were not admissible ? Should a lover of truth-
should a friend to whatever might alleviate suffering humanity, thus
hastily and, ex catkedrd, deliver an adverse opinion upon a science
which, to say the least, is at present only in its infancy 1 If we can-
not admire the reasoning facu1ty that this sermon evinces, can we, on
the other hand, praise its charity ? " In forming a judgment of this
(says Mr. M'Neile), I go, of course, on what I have read. I lw:ce Been.
nothing ofit, nor do I think it right to tempt God by going to see it.
I have not faith to go in the name of the Lord Jesus and to command
the DerJil to depart." Really, any one would suppose that he were
reading the ignorant ebullition of some dark monk in the middle ages,
rather than the sentiments of an educated Protestant of the nineteenth
century. What is this but a revival of the same spirit that called forth
a papal anathema a,aainst the profound Galileo? What, but an imita-
tion of the same objections which pronounced the doctrine of Antipodes
liS incompatible with the faith, and maintained that the theory of Co-
lumbus threw discredit on the Bible? Verily, the University of Sala-
manca, which opposed the dogged resistance of theological objections
to the obscure Genoese, and the Inquisition at Rome, thnt condemned
the philosopher of Pisa, might claim n kindred associate in the minister
of St. Jude's! For, according to Mr. M'Neile, Mesmerism must be
" nothing but human fraud for gain sake," or something " beyond the
power of unassisted man to accomplish." Is my brother-divine, then,
so intimately versed in all the mighty secrets of Nature? Has he so
thoroughly fathomed her vast and various recesses, that he ventures to
pronounce everything that may be contrary to, or beyond his own
knowledge and experience, liS the invention of evil spirits, or the con-
trivance of evil men ? Is there nothing new to be discovered ? Are
the regions of light and life exhausted and laid bare ? Have we at last
reached the ultima tlzule of art and science? "It is not in nature for
any one to bear to be so treated," says Mr. M'Neile, authoritatively;
introducing at the same time and in the midst of the same sentence
thisevDSiveand contradictory exception, "soJar as we have yet learned."
And having previously IISSumed tbe sinfulness of Mesmerism, and ra-
ther regretted that he had not " the faith to bid the Devil to depart,"
he againgoes on, and says" theremaybesomepowerin nature......some
secret operation......somelatentpowerinnature, which is now being dis-
covered......something like the power of compressed steam......or like
electricity." Why, this is the very point in question. This is the very
subject of the controversy. This is the very fact which the large nnd
increasing body of believers in Mesmerism confidently IISSert. And
"if there may be such n power in nature," why does he prematurely
denounce it ns diabolical, nod the net of Satan, before the truth· has
been fairly and fully established? Why not wait, and examine, and
patiently and prayerfully study the statements, the experiments, nnd
the results that prescn~ thco:tselves, and with n seriQus thinking spirit

rel'olve the evidence of the whole matter, and say whether perebance
it may not be the "gift of God" (Eccl. iii. 13). "Be not rash with
thy mouth (says the royal preacher), and let not thine heart be hasty
to utter anything before God; for God is in heaven and thou upon
earth; therefore let thy words be few" (Eccl. v. 2). Surely it were
the part of a wise and sober Christian,who remembereth that "nothing
is impossible with God," to weigh a great and curious question like
this in a humble posture of mind, and not rashly to pronounce of his
fellow-men, who, for their faith and their attainments in grace, may,
for aught he knows, be as acceptable with the Saviour as himself, that
they are agents and instruments of the evil one I Washington Irving•
tells us, that when Petro Gonzales de Mendoza, Archbishop of Toledo
and Grand Cardinal ofSpain, became first acquainted with the views of
Columbus, he feared that they were tainted with heterodoxy, and in-
compatible with the form of earth described in sacred Scripture. But
we read, that " farther explanations had their force," and " he per-
ceived that there could be nothing irreligious in attempting to extend
the bounds of human knowledge, and to ascertain the works of crea-
tion ;" and the great cardinal therefore gave the obscure navigator a
" courteous and attentive hearing." It would ill become an anony-
mous writer like myself to utter one word of disparagement against so
experienced a minister as Mr. M'Neile. I have listened with too
great pleasure to his " reasonings on righteousness, and temperance,
and judgment to come," to permit any depreciatory language to escape
from me ; but he must bear with me when I add, that with all his
eloquence and power, he might find a wholesome lesson for improve-
ment in the example of this great Roman Catholic prelate, when listen-
ing to the novel theories of the unknown Columbus. But with one
breath to say, that there may" be such a power in nature," and with
another to describe men, who simply make use of that power, as those
wl10 deal with " familiar spirits," does appear the most monstrous in-
stance of inconsistent condemnation we ever met with; it is a begging
the whole question with a vengeance ; it is a summaryjudgment with-
out appeal; it is a decision affecting papal infallibility. And yet this
competent juryman says, " I have seen notRing ofit, nor do I think it
right to tempt God by going to see it."
AprO]XJ8 of " seeing nothing of it I " The minister of St. Jode's is
not the only party wllo shrinks from this evidence of his senses. He
says, that in these reported cases there ruust be either collusion or
something supernatural; but he evidently adheres to the latter opinion,
for he adds afterwards, " and if, as I judge, there be anything super-
natural in it;" and he only regrets that he has not faith to play the
part of exorciser and bid the devil depart; and from want of this faith
refuses to be present. But there are members of a learned, aye and
liberal bodv, from whom we might expect better things. In that pro-
fession which is alike distinguished for its humanity, its ability, its love
of science, its love of truth, its large and comprehensive philosophy, it is

to be hoped that the far greater number would be ready to give, even to
the hateful study of Mesmerism, the benefit of a faithful and dispassion-
ate enquiry. We are sure that there are many who would cheerfully
admit that the field of llsefulness is enlarged by it, and the means of
lessening human ills considerably extended. We know that there are
several, who, at the risk of dnmaging their worldly prospects, do not
hesitate to step forward fearlessly and manfully, as believers in, and
practisers of, the calumniated science. At the head of this noble and
independent band, first and foremost stands the name of ELLIOTsoN-
a tower of strength in itself, and alone able to confer distinction on any
cause, however honourable. From among the younger members of the
profession there are to be found manr zealous and talented men fol-
lowing in his train, anxiously devoting their attention to the study,
gathering facts as they arise, and prepared to employ their aid among
the means of cure at their disposal. 0 si sic omnes! For tl1ere are
others, who, to judge from their language, would seem to have the same
horror at being witnesses of Mesmeric phenomena as the bat has at
the approach of light. These striking facts they either include under
the insolent charge of" fraud," or the more courteous and convenient
phrase of " imagination." They sneer or smile when the subject is
brought forward, according to their own tum of mind, or rather ac-
cording to the temper of those with whom they argue. But to be
present, to have their names bruited about as testimonies of a fact--to
be unable to resist their own convictions, to be unable to remain in
the bliss of ignorance, this is a position from which they fall back with
a secret dread of approaching danger. They can be sharp-sighted
enough in detecting narrowness of spirit in any other quarter, aavo-
cates for freedom of conscience in theology, ameliorators of our criminal
code in matters of jurisprudence, liberal, tolerant, and haters of abuse;
but the moment that Mesmeric phenomena are proposed as auxiliaries
to their practice, that instant they are as sensitive, as angry, as staunch
· adherents of what is old--as stout opponents of what is new, as though
the charter and privileges of their order were being jeopardied for ever!
Doubtless, in all experiments of a strange and novel character, the
public do expect from the medical profession the most cautious, slow,
and deliberate frame of mind. They expect from their closer cogni-
zance of subjects of this nature the most searching, scrutinizing, hesi-
tating conduct. Nay, they would not even be displeased to see an
enquiry carried on in a sceptical, unbelieving spirit. But still they do
expect enquiry of some kind : they do not expect to see a subject of
this important nature treated with the vulgarest vituperation nnd ridi-
cule ; its supporters stigmatized as credulous, its operators defamed as
fraudulent, its patients mocked at as impostors. They do not expect
to see the heads of a profession which piques itself pre-eminently on
its liberality, exhibiting the bigotry of the priest, and the special plead-·
ing of the lawyer. Look, for instance, at what tool} place a few years
back at the London University. Often is the world invited to sneer
at the blind prejudices that disfigure the banks of the Isis; but in spite
of all the faults of Alma Mater, in spite of all her past and pli.l&ent

absurdities, I am ready to contrnst her conduct on a memorable occa-
sion with the intolerance and hatred of novelty that recently marked
the more modern institution. Are the circumstances under which
Locke was expelled from Christ Church one whit more disgraceful
than the treatment which induced Dr. Elliotson to withdraw his name
from the Professorship in the University of London? Wns the temple
of science more liberal than the ball of logic ? Was the new founda-
tion more friendly to enlightened investigations than the old? In the
ancient seat of learning, the timidity or servility ofn Dean and Chapter
expunged the name of the philosopher from the books of his college
at the mandate of an at·bitrary sovereign ; but the vacancy in the Pro-
fessor's chair wns the result of an opposition to physiological experi-
ments on the part of soi-disant friends to free and scientific enquiry.
Tum again to the proceedings of tl1e Royal Medical and Chirurgical
Society. See the alarmed and almost frantic feelings with which cer-
tain parties discussed the memorable account of the amputation of a
thigh during the patient's Mesmeric state. Sec how anxious they were
to put the matter down, and bury the facts in oblivion. A Bible
thrown into a Spanish convent could not lmvc more convulsed its in-
mates than did this unfortunate treatise that learned o.sSembly. Mr.
Topham has much to answer for. One* great medical reviewer de-
clared that he would not believe the facts had he witnessed them
himself. ' A leading and pre-eminent operator, whose praise is at this
moment in all our moutl1s, expressed his perfect satisfaction with the
condemnatory reports made by others, and par consequent the need-
lessness that he should hepresent and examine them himself! Really,
in passing through the account of this debate, in noting the anxiety of
certain members to expunge all record of the proceedings from their
minute book, I could have fancied that I was rending the discussions
of a knot of mendicant friars terrified at tl1e dawn of the Reformation ;
I felt myself transplanted, as it were, into the Vatican, where was a
Jetter from Luther, frightening the holy conclave from its propriety.
All the· time that I was rending the speeches of certain opponents,
there kept involuntarily rising up in my mind the outcry of Demetrius,
the Ephesian silversmith, " Our craft is in danger to be set at nought;
and, sirs, yc know that by this craft we have our wealth " (Acts xix.
25, 27). One would suppose that these gentlemen would remember
the treatment of Harvey by the profession, the " Circulator," as he was
termed by them; the averted eye that at first was turned on Jenner;
and the disbelief with which many great and mighty discoveries have
been received, and be more cautious and circumspect for the future.
Oh! if n love of ancient usages-if a hatred of new and unpalatable
truths is to bear away the bell, Oxford may now hide her diminished
head, Salamnpca "pale her uneffcctunl fires," the doctors of the Sor-
'bonne part with their old pre-eminence, for competitors arc stepping in
ft:om the " liberal professions," able nnd willing to take the lend. And
yet we are all aware of the sarcasms with which "the faculty" and
' See Elliotson's " Numerous Cases," &i:;

the "philosophers" treat tl1e "learned ignorance" of the clergy, and
their presumed dislike to scientific enquiry; and perhaps we nrc too
often a fair subject for such animadversion, more especially if many
such sermons, as the one under discussion, are delivered by us ; but I
cnn tell " the profession" in return, that I should have more hope of
bringing home a new and important truth to the minds of an ignorant
nod superstitious peasantry than of combating successfully the bigotry
of the philosopher, and the prejudices of an educated and scientific
assembly.
But to return to Mr. M'Noile. After certain criticising observations,
ns to the scientific character of some Mesmeric proceedings, on which
we will speak presently, he refers to the well-known "magnetic ex-
periment" of the operation for a cancer in Frnnce, which n lady under.:
went without feeling any pain in its progress, and mentions it as " re-
corded in a report made by the Committee of the Royal Academy nt
Pnris." And so determined is he to discover the evil spirit nt work in
tl10 business, that he says-" Ifthis be a falsehood, there is something
almost supernatural in the fact, that we have n whole academy joining
to tell the' public this lie. If it be a truth, if the fact be so, then
here, beyond all question, is something out oftl~.e range ofnature-out
of the present power of man, unless this is a new science." In this
nge of discoveries and marvels, surely a thinking mind need not deem it
so very incredible, thnt some large addition to scientific knowledge, or
even a "new science," as he calls it, should be brought to light. Wo
have of late seen so many of the wonders of God's providence made
manifest to our view-wonders, of whose existence our forefathers had
not the shadow of a suspicion, that the Christian, while he contemplates
them all with thankfulness and awe, might rather be expected to adopt
the npostolic language, and say, ''we know but in part," and we" see
but through a glass darkly." '' Lo! (said the patient Job, while he
was acknowledging the power of God to be infinite and unsearchable)
-lo, these are pat·ts of his ways ; but how little aportion is heard of
him1but the thunder of his power who can understand?" ( xxvi. 14).
But, says Mr. M•Neile, on the contrary," we know what sleep is, and
we know what pain is?" Does be, indeed, "know" what sleep is l
Is he so accurate a physiologist that he is ncqueainted with all its
varieties, its appearances, its modifications and actions,· accordin"'
to the changes and conditions of the human frame ? Does h~
too "know" what pain is? Is he so deeply read in patholo<>y
that he is prepared to state unerringly its effect upon the body of m~n
under every possible contingency 1 Why he himself says-" We do
not know aU the properties of matter certainly, nod there may be some
occult property in matter which these men have discovered, and which
may have the etfe(}t, when applied to the human frame, of renderilw
it insensible to pain." Again, I say, this is the point nt issue. Why
mny there not be such no ''occult property in matter," the beneficent
"gift of God" for the usc of his creature man, without calling up
diabolical machinery to explain the difficulty? In an ndmonition tlmt
he gives to tlic medical profession, he quotes Shakspeare, and berrs
respectfully to suggest to them, that there are "more things in heav~n
Digitized by Coogle
10
and earth than are drenmt of in their philosophy."· Tkey might, with
a beautiful propriety, fling back upon him his own quotation, and re-
quest him to apply it to this very question. A Christian minister, how-
ever, would rather go to the insp1rcd volume, and say-" Who is this
that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge. Gird up now thy
loins like a man, for I 'will demand of thee, and answer thou me.
Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth 1 Declare,
if thou hast understanding.......Have the gates of death been opened
unto thee 1 or hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of death?
Hast thou perceived the breadth of the eartlt ? Declare, if thou
lcnowest it all. Where is the way where light dwelleth ?-and as for
darkness, where is the place thereof? That thou shouldest take it to
the bound thereof, and that thou sl10uldest know the paths to the
house tlJCreof?" (Job x:s:xviii. 3, &c.) The Almighty Futher, whose
ju<lgments are unsearchable, and whose ways past finding out, hath
bidden from the curious eyes of man the reasons and explanations of
many of his gifts, and left us to grope ignorantly in the dark upon sub-
jects the most familiar, and which arc for ever present around us.
But is this outside and superficial acquaintance with the works of
nature to shut out from our remembrance the ever-present agency of
t1JC hand of God? To condemn Mesmerism as an abomination of the
<levi!, because little or nothing is yet known respecting it, is a line of
nr~ument, wbicl1, if pressed to its absurd conclusion, would ascribe
half tlJC wonders of creation to the care and contrivance of the spirit
of evil. What, for instance, is our life-the bodily life of man 1 In
what does it consist? What is its immediate and secondary cause 1
What produces it-what terminates it-what gives it vitality and con-
tinuance 1 I believe that the bestphysiologistsare not prepared with any
positive opinion on the matter. Some consider (and with great show of
probability) Electricity to be analogous to the principle of life. Some
consider Efectricity to be the principle of life. We are aware that all
nature abounds with electric matter-it is here and everywhere ; per-
chance, under God, in it we "live and move and have our being."
Wc l1ear of Galvinism, and Magnetic-eletricity, or Electro-magnetism,
and its efficacy, through machines, upon the human body, in relieving
paralysis, and rheumatism, and diffex·ent neuralgic disorders. Why
might not Mesmerism, or Animal-magnetism, as it would appear to be
appropriately called, be Electricity under a different character? Its
results arc often the same, or rather very similar. Why might not
tl1e electric fluid of the operator unite itself under various modifications
with the electric fluid of the patient, and thus act with a curative in-
fluence upon the principle of life within us? It is Mr. M'Neile him-
self, who in tl1is very sermon bas referred to Electricity, nnd to the
shock of the Galvanic battery; and I would, therefore, just remind
l1im, that in the study of this very subjact there is yet much darkness ;
that there is yet much to learn; tlmt we do not yet know how fnr its
action is connected with tl1e principle of life-and certainly we would
defy him to prove that Mesmerism or Animal-magnetism is not an
essential portion of the system.

11
And this brings us to Mr.M•Neile's main argumeBt, upon lVhi.ch he
appears to plume himself most confidently, for he repeats it over and
over ~<rain under various phases:-" I would wish (says he) that the
professors of this science should state the laws of nature by the uni-
form action of which this thing is done......Let them put forward the
elements of the science in a scientific mo.nner....•...It belongs to
philosophers, who are honest men, and who make any discovery of
this kind, to state the uniform action......We henr of these experi-
ments-but hear nothing of a scientific statement of the laws......Let
us have the laws of the science......I consider that no Christian person
ought to go near any of these meetings, or hea1· any of these lectures,
until a statement shall be made, grounded on a scientific assertion of
the laws by which this thing is said to act." And so on passim to
the end of the sermon.
Now this argument, perseveringly as it is repented, may be disposed
of very easily.
First, in regard to his demand, that "the laws of this science be
stated" clearly and "in a scientific manner." To this there can be no
objection. This is a just and legitimate challenge. Nay, we would
say in his own words, "Science is open and above-board to all who
will examine it-it courts examination ; let us not listen to it, so long
as they keep it secret, and hide the nature of it." True, most true.
But who keeps it a secret? Who hides the nature of it? The be-
lievers in Mesmerism are earnestly solicitous thnt the most open,
pubJic, free, and full examination of the subject and its details should
be constantly taking place. They invite its enemies and impugners to
be present. They call upon tlte most prejudiced and the most partial
to come with their prejudices and partialities, and witness facts. All
they require, on the other hand, is an honest and candid conclusion out
of an "honest and good heart." But are Mesmerists to be blamed
for not stating the laws and principles of this system, when they do
not know them themselves? Does Mr. M'Neile remember, that
Mesmerism is yet but in its cradle ? That, practically, it has been
but little known except witbin a few short years ? In saying this,
we are of course aware, tltat those wLo have looked farthest into the
question, maintain that for centuries back, the Egyptians, and, per-
Imps the Chinese, have been acquainted with it ; and that, at inter-
vals, it has been always more or less known. To me the great
wonder is, that au art within the reach of everybody, should have re-
mained so long a secret; however, the fact is, that publicly and philo-
sophically the system has only been recently studied. At this very
moment, numbers of cautious observant men are noting down facts as
they arise, with a view to a safe and surer conclusion. On the great
Baconian system of induction, they are recording the experiments, the
variations, the modifications, as they present themselves ; and when
these shall be well established, they will come to the theory. Would
l\fr. M•Neile have the tlteory first declared, and the facts collected
afterwards to prove it. This might be convenient, but hardly philoso-
phical. Our opponent must be content to w"it patiently a few years,
Digitized by Coogle
12
before his demand of having the general laws of the science scientifi-
cally stated, can be properly complied with. Mesmerism is yet in its
infancy. Wc cannot yet state "how a pass of the thumb, or a move-
ment of the fingers acts on human flesh"-wc cannot yet state "how
it stops the circulation of the blood so llS to resist the strcngthfulness
of the human frame"-we cannot yet state "how it prevents the deli-
cate touch being felt in the cutaneous veins." But because we cannot
yet give a scientific statement of the matter, are we to forbear its use
as n remedial agent, or to ascribe these unknown properties to.the
" devices of the Devil ?" In the cognate or analogous science of
mineral magnetism, tho peculiar cause of union between ma,"'lletic
pyrites and iron had been for years altogether inexplicable-and per··
haps, with all our knowledge of electricity, is not even yet satisfactorily
explained. But was the mariner tc deny himself the usc of the com-
pass in the stormy and trackless ocean, or to attribute the influence of
tho loadstone to the contrivance of Satan, because the "hou.1,'' and the
"why," and the "wherifore" had not been philosophically accounted
for? All he could say was, that the needle was guided by the finger
of that Divine Being, whose wnfs were in the great deep, and whose
footstep are unknown. And al we can say is, that Mesmerism is the
good "gift of God" for the usc of his creature man, though its imme-
diate and secondary causes nrc at present inexplicable-tho good gift
of that merciful and Almighty li'nther, who is " always, everywhere,
and aU in nll."
And, secondly, o.s to his expectation that the laws of this science
should act ''uniformly."......It is a part (says he) of all nature's laws
tl1at they shall net uniformly.......If it bo in nature, it will operate
uniformly, and not capriciously. If it nets capriciously, then there is
some mischievous agent nt work." Of course in this implied charge of
capriciousness, or wnnt of uniformity, he refers to n variation of tho
symptoms or phenomena exhibited respectively by different patient~<.
And in consequence of this variation, which must be admitted, his
hearers aro taught that the "sin of witchcraft" has ensnared the ope-
rators, and that some mocking, juggling fiend has taken possession of
the patient. Now in regard to nature's laws, we at once agree that
they arc fixed, consistent, and unalterable. The physical world abhors
"capriciousness." "Comets nrc regular," and nature "plain." It is
for this rco.son that sciences are Ctlllcd " exact." To take an instance
or two nt rnndom, we know that in the process of crystallization, certain
bodies invariably as9ume certain spccilic forms ; and that in Electro-
magnetism, the mutual attraction o1· repulsion of electrified substances
is directly proportional to the quantity of electricity conjointly in each
of them. All these facts fnll under the category of general laws.
And docs Mr. M•Ncilc imagine that tho laws which govern Mesmerism
are not equally fixed, consistent, and uniform, though p!tenomena va1:1J

ciousness" or eccentricity, is not in reality n sure unalterable result of
some unknown or unexplainable cuusc. \Vc would lay it down n.~ an

dents nrc the so.me, where the relative circumstances of the opcrntor
and the patient are precisely similar, the effects or phenomena would
be ns certain and regular as in any of those sciences termed exact.
But the difficulty is to find this precise undeviating resemblan.ce-t.his
absence of all difference, and hence the apparent want of umfol'Imty.
In so sensitive, delicate, varying a frame as the human body, so sub-
ject to "skyey influences"-so affected by diet, clothing, lodging, and
climate-so changed by a thousand minor incidents, could the same
uniformity of action be expected as in inert matter or mec!Janical sub-
stance ? Is it probable, that a patient, wasted by years of depletion
and violent medicines, and with whom blisterings, and cuppings, and
leechings had gone their round, would exhibit the same f'ymptoms as
some robust and hearty sportsman, whose constitution had been tried
by nothing of the same order? Would not' a diet of port wine or
porter yroduce a very different habit of body from that created by
blue pi! and Ab~rnethy's biscuits? We are taking certain extreme
and opposite conditions ; but when we reflect that the circumstances
of constitution, of custom, of food, of disease, admit of as many varie-
ties ns the human face divine ; that these varieties form the habit of
body ; and that it is upon our bodies so modified, that Mesmerism acts,
common sense must see that perfect uniformity of result is hardly pro-
bable. For instance, with one party, the Mesmeric sleep is obtained
at the first sitting ; with another, not for several days or weeks. One
patient recognizes the hand of the operator, and cannot endure the
touch even of a relative; with another, to be touched by either is a
thing indifferent. One only hears the voice of the operator; another,
without preference, answers any speaker. Nay, with the same patient
the symptoms vary at various sittings. Still, in spite of all this, we say,
that in main essential points, the resemblance or uniformity is very
remarkable; that the properties, as thus developed, have an evident
affinity ; but if Mesmerisers are not able to lay down broad general
rules, predictive of positive results, the fault is to be found in our
imperfect acquaintance with a new study, in the difficulty of the
science and the delicacy of the human frame, which is its subject.
But is there any thing strnnge in this ? Surely we might find some-
thing very analogous in our favourite illustration from natural philo-
sophy. The nature of electricty, for instance, is not so perfectly
known, that a law could be laid down by general reasoning, so as to
foretel of a certainty the manner in which electrified bodies would act,
in any position, in which they might be respectively placed. Do we
therefore, say that there is no uniformity; or, as Mr. M•Neile miO'ht
say, that there is no electricity, or rnther, that the whole is determi~ed
by the accidental caprices of Satan ? No; we answer that the distance
of the positive and negative bodies being known, and no dernnO'ement
arising from other or accidental causes, their uniformity of a~tion is
certain ; but we.add, that ns philosophers could not determine a just
theory of all tlus from the physical principles of electricity, it was
necessary to proceed by observation and comparison of phenomena
before the law of variation could be fully established. And so it is~

Animal- magnetism ; it will be by observation, by induction of various
and numerous particulars, as exhibited in individuals of various con-
stitutions and habits, thnt any approach to a consistent theory of action
can be established. All this will require much time, and many and
kldious experiments ; and my own opinion certainly is, that in the
operation of this system on so sensitive a subject liB the human frame,
it will be almost impossible to lay down specific and positive rules of
its effects, in all eases and under every modification of temperament.
And this, forsooth, is the foundation on which the weighty charge
of Satanic agency is attempted to be built ! These the reasons on
which Christian men are lvarned against going near Mesmeric meetings,
or hearing any Mesmeric lectures I I would not speak with harsh-
ness of any language or conduct that appeared to take its rise from
motives of piety, however misdirected ; but where so mischievous a
delusion has taken root, both justice and humanity require us to say,
that never in the history of the human mind has an idle and miserable
bugbear been created from more weak and worthless materials. If
there be anything supernatural in the matter, it is that a man of Mr.
M'Neile's acknowledged abilities could have given utterance to sueh
puerilities ; and that when they were published, any parties could care
to distribute them to their neighbours; and that when read, any single
mind could have been influenced by the perusal. But, verily, it is
something to have a reputation-it covers a multitude of follies; for,
like Sir Oracle, you may then lay down the law to your deluded
followers. I have felt sometimen ashamed at encountering this solemn
~rifling with earnest argument-but even since this letter has been
commenced, I have met with two additional instances, in which a
superstitious awe on the subject of Mesmerism, produced exclusively
by this sermon, had seized the minds of the unhappy sufferers, and
deterred them from employing a remedy peculiarly adapted to relieve
them. It seems incredible-yet such were the facts ; truth is stranger
than. fiction; and so I resumed my pen with an increased desire of
doing some little good in abating the folly. I hoped to remind the
admirers of our friend at Liverpool, that powerful as he is, his power
rather lies in the command of language than in the strength of argu-
ment-that he carries more sail than ballast; and, certainly, that when
he scattered around him such words as " witchcraft" and " necro-
mancy," and called down, as it were, a fire from heaven on the heads
of benevolent lecturers, the minister of St. Jude's had altogether for-
gotten " what spirit he was off."
What, then, is the state of mind with which " wise, prudent, and
Christian men should meet the present state of the question ?" I
would not have them, from a disgust at the tendencies of this sermon,
join the ranks of the infidel, nnd laugh to scorn the doctrine of Satanic
agency, as the invention of men-holy Scripture teaches it ; experi-
mental religion confirms it ; for we all unhappily know that the
" Devil goeth about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour;
but I would have them be cautious not to confound the ways of Provi
denee with the works of the evil one ; I would have them remember
Digitized by Coogle
" how little a part" of God's wonders are yet laid bare to his creatures;
1 would have them look into the subject with a devotional spirit,
anxious for truth, not rashly condemning that of which they are Igno-
rant, lest haply, in their presumption, "they be found to be fighting
no<P&inst God.'" " Christian men" need not fear to be present at
scientific lectures or physiological experiments, if they go in a Chris-
tian s:pirit. Hard words are no argument. Accusations of "morbid
curiosity," and " foolish novelties," and " deviHsh devices," carry no
proofs of their truth to the thinking pious believer. If he goes, he
goes with prayer-he goes with the Bible, if not in his hand, yet in his
heart; he goes to study the book of God's works by the book of
God's word; he goes with the full remembrance that "no science
can save a soul," no natural knowledge bring us nearer to God. But
if, on the other hand, it be sickness or bodily pain that hath entered
into the Christian's dwelling, and that his knowledge of the healing
properties of Mesmerism should lead him to make experiment of its
power, what are the feelings with which he would commence a trial
of this unknown and unseen remedy 1 He would "walk by faith and
not by sight." He would regard it as only one out of many thousand
gifts, bountifully bestowed upon us in this life by a merciful Creator ;
he would value it as a blessing sent to cheer and comfort him, when
other and more customary means were failing to relieve him. He
would turn to its use with prayer, with humble hope, with pious confi-
dence ; he would feel that the issue was yet 'vith God, and the
divine will would be his own. He would not, like the impious king
recorded in Scripture, forget the Lord, and-seek only physicians. No:
the great Physician of the cross, the healer of our leprosies, bodily and
spiritual, would, after all, be his main and only refuge. To Him
would he look at morning, at noontide, and at the evening hour.
Yea, he would feel that it was good to be afflicted, if his afflictions
and their earthly remedies made him better acquainted with his own
heart, and brought him to a closer and more abiding communion with
his Saviour and his God !
I trust, that in some slight degree, these are the serious and thank-
ful feelings, with which I myself have been enabled to -regard the sub-
ject. None but a few members ofmy family are awnre of the sad and
harrowing scenes, which for weeks we were called upon to witness-
the sleepless nights, the racking pains, the wasted form, the tortures of
the mind no less than of the body, and "all the snd varietv of woe ·"
and how at last, when opiates and all the usual " appliances and mea~s
to boot," had not only failed to ease, but even tended to aggravate;
when he who wns at once both the friend and the physician had run
the round of art, and tried in vain all that skill and kindness could
suggest; when the "silver cord was on the point of beinrr loosed,"
and our hope was as the giving up of the ghost-that tken°was sud-
d~nly realiz~d tha~ grea~ Script~,re truth, " that which is impossible
