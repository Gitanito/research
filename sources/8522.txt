    'Near Death Experience' Gandhian Insights

  _   'Near Death Experience' Gandhian Insights; Near death experiences strengthened   Mohandas Gandhi's view of nonviolence, much like Martin Luther King, Jr.'s   mountain-top 'I have a dream' experiences.&nbsp; Over time, such near death   experience energizes nonviolent power, force, conflict, and coercion or   compulsion.&nbsp; Relative U.S. traditions of nonviolence likewise included Alice   Paul (PhD, LLD), who wrote the U.S. ERA Amendment, and led suffrage   demonstrations against 1913-1921 Wars (WWI), often jailed, beaten severely; A   prison door necklace pendant symbolizing her work.&nbsp; In due course, Florence   Kelley organized arguments for the U.S. Congress for health care, consumer   rights, abolishing child labor, and a 40-hour work week, as likely the first   U.S. factory health inspector. &nbsp;Put in Gandhi's own words, 'Where death without   resistance or [nonviolent] death after&nbsp;resistance is the only way, neither party   should think&nbsp;of resorting to law courts or help from government....&nbsp; [Needs]   demands of equity supersede the letter of&nbsp;law.'&nbsp; Nonviolence, as a word, thus   evolved through Mohandas Gandhi's first employment as an attorney in Durban, RSA,   with a Muslim employer and benefactor within a Hindu-Muslim population, at times   supported by Dutch-Anglo Quakers and Methodists, along with the African Fort   Hare University and Jainist notions of ahimsa (nonviolence), while   focused through the Phoenix and Tolstoy Farms-Ashrams, and devoted physically to   his family and &nbsp;team sports like soccer, all coordinated in South Africa through   his Jewish secretary, Sonia Schlesin.

    From the 1890s Mohandas Gandi's near death experiences ranged deeply, from   crowds or police threatening violence or to lynch or beat him to death, toward   subsequent liberation campaign struggle ' 'uniting people riven asunder.'&nbsp; In   January 1908, when experimenting with a vegan diet and hunger strike options, a   condition like dysentery again almost killed him. His 1908 near death crisis may   have resulted from accidentally ingesting cow (not goat) yogurt; after a vegan   diet for nearly a decade, missing dairy enzymes able to metabolize animal   protein in his gut.&nbsp; Friends like Sarojini Naidu and Vallabhbhai Patel oriented   vegan-oriented insights and near death experiences ' with his consequent   decision to maintain minimal dietary animal protein levels, i.e., relevant   enzymes to process meat or dairy products consumed unawares.&nbsp; Intuitive dialogue   over diet, fasting to near death, and the slow prison death of his partner,   Kasturbai, (caring for her during 1940s war), patterned ongoing nonviolence   conceptualization toward changing will power, and so on.&nbsp; Thus nonviolent power,   force, conflict and coercion or compulsion may recycle, revise, and transcend   worldviews ' wherein time, past, current, and future, obtains heuristically and   hermeneutically ' while universally-violent methodologies lead to illusory,   irreducibly-violent future realities.

    The Longs' 2010-released a study of near death experience articulates analogous   peace-oriented dialogue, such that death transcends time and language ' 'I'''we'   living by the power of 'tough' love empowering life itself.&nbsp; Near death   experiencers know uniformly-common events lucidly, under clinical   unconsciousness, regardless of culture ' Out-of-body experiences,   uncannily-verified; blind sight during anesthesia, even among legally blind;   life review playback, impossibly accurate; friend &amp; family 'mass' cognition;   child-like-adult 'memory' consciousness; and peaceable-life after-effects; all   sharing worldwide intercultural consistency.&nbsp; These increasingly more   commonly-experienced after-effect 'glows' displace religious cave-oriented   heaven and hell mythology, by coalescing 'heavenly' human peace 'on earth'   needs.

  _ Nonviolence in   Haiti and Chile (in terms of Cuba);

    Post-Earthquake assistance in Haiti and Chile follows both militarily- and   nongovernmentally-oriented nonviolence methodologies.&nbsp; As to nonviolence, by   2001, groups like Pax Christi and Peace Brigades International supported   Jean-Bertrand Aristide, Haiti's exiled president; Highlighting illiteracy rates   of 85% and attempting to decrease Haiti's military spending and systemic   judicial corruption.&nbsp; In 2004 the Cara'b'en Center for Global NonViolence and   Sustainability began to publish cultural notions of nonviolence in Haitian   Creole. &nbsp;Medically, Haitian nonviolence may have started from African   nonviolence models, by way of the Hospital Albert Schweitzer, Deschapelles,   Haiti (1956), from Schweitzer's Lambarene Hospital (Gabon, Africa 1913).&nbsp;   Schweitzer believed that real force derives from a mutual spirit of love, and of   freedom from hate.&nbsp; Likeminded Chilean and Argentinian nonviolence has evolved   from often-Catholic groups like Servicio Paz y Justicia, through writers   like Nobel Prize Winner, Adolfo P'rez Esquivel. &nbsp;Being demographically the   closest and largest neighbor of Haiti, Eastern Cuba has shared cultural-musical   roots through, especially, Port-au-Prince and Santiago de Cuba, for centuries.&nbsp;   Speculation in nonviolence literature exists as to how planetwide 'Women in   Black' nonviolence phenomena began with women organizing against Franco (Spain)   and Batista (Cuba), historically.

    Following Hedi Annabi, UN-Tunisia), the UN's Edmond Mulet (Guatemala) and Kim   Bolduc (Canada) continues to internationally coordinate Haiti earthquake relief   ' Cuban physicians co-developed skeletal Haitian medical services response   systems, and so, also, field hospital-level rebuilding.&nbsp; Systematic Cuban   efforts matured by way of a Latin American School of Medicine in Havana and   Santiago de Cuba, (Escuela Latinoamericana de Ciencias M'dicas de La Habana y la   de Santiago de Cuba/ELM); ELM Medical Journal: Panorama.&nbsp; Since the early   1970s, in this context, Cuban medical volunteers have helped countries in-need,   often coordinated with local nonviolence groups; globally, akin to the U.S.   Peace Corps.&nbsp; Mirta Roses Periago, (Argentinian), MD, heading PAHO (Pan American   Health Organization), evinces some of the clearest descriptions of such Cuban   medical nonviolence in Haiti. She notes that Cuban physicians helped to equip   Haiti's medical first-line-of-defense response ' Over 500 medical care personnel   and a thousand support staff, via a dozen or so basic field hospitals or   diagnostics centers. Since December 1998, over 6,000 Cuban medical volunteers   have co-energized a Haitian Comprehensive Health Program, treating 14 million   Haitian people, with 50,000 eye operations, 100,000 deliveries and 225,000   surgeries; having already saved 230,000 lives ' as the 2010 earthquakes began.
