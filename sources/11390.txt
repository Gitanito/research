  		              		Experience Description   

    In March 2003, I remember  my son was 4 months old at the time. I had been sick during my whole pregnancy because of  my gall-bladder. At the time of the pregnancy, I constantly had feelings of faintness.  The doctors thought that it was some kind of disease connected with the pregnancy. After giving birth, the faintness with loss of consciousness continued.  During a test the cause of my fainting was discovered. I had emergency  surgery because gallstones were blocking  the common bile duct. 
  
  The  surgery was from  8:30am until  21:30pm. I came back to a room with a gastric suction tube through my nose.
  
  I remember that I couldn't breath anymore, but I couldn't move and I felt that my strength was leaving me. I was thinking that I was dying and  thought about my son. The next I know,  I went outside of my body.
  
  Then I was in a dark tunnel with people wandering around. At the end of the tunnel was a very beautiful and luminous light, but it was not dazzling.
  
  The closer I got to this light, the more I felt relief.   I felt a sensation of being loved, which  I missed so much at the time.  I felt very satisfied and finally happy, which was something new for me. I had  positive feelings that had such an intense depth, that words don't exist to explain it. It was more like I was sensing it. 
  
  I entered the light without any fear. While I continued my way in this light, a silhouette came from above and blocked the way to the light by coming in front of me. I was surprised to  see my whole, difficult life scrolling before me and I said, 'I don't want to relive this, life is too hard.&quot; And I started crying. The silhouette told me 'It's only up to you to change things, you can help many people as your soul is pure. You are needed on earth.' When he told me  that I was needed on earth, I immediately was thinking about my son. Then   I found myself moving backwards, but in a vortex. It was  a little bit like what  you can see in science fiction movies.
  
  Then I found myself in a room.   I'm looking around and seeing my body on what looks like  a surgery table. But considering my medical experience, it resembled more a room for defibrillation than a surgery room. As I'm watching the situation, I see a nurse and a doctor. I hear a lot of people talking in a very noisy room next door. I feel the panic in this adjacent room from the screams and crying. I'm coming back to the room where my physical body is and I see the doctor. He  starts saying, 'It's done. We lost her.' He looks at his watch and the clock on the wall in order to pronounce the time of death. At that moment the nurse asks the doctor, 'Please doctor, try once more to shock her. She's only 21 years old; she's to young to die.' The doctor looks at her and says, 'Unfortunately, I cannot resuscitate people. But okay as you insist. We will try a last time.' I see him going towards a big machine. Then  I come back into my body. As from this moment, I don't remember anything anymore.
  
  When being transported in my room, my roommate said to me, 'What happened to you?' And there I understand that something strange happened, as the nursing staff was talking about me. They were  saying, 'She's coming back from far, the young one.' When trying to ask questions I got evasive answers. With time I realize that it is sounding false, as this is not logical.

The experience included:       Passing into or through a tunnel  

  Did you pass into or through a tunnel?         Yes     a tunnel with wandering souls in the form of shades at the entry, and at the end a light. From the moment I entered the  tunnel, I changed dimension and my vibratory rate was changing. People that don't enter the tunnel, are persons staying with the physical energy of earth.  They  cannot change their vibratory rate because of their physical past they are unable to let go.

  Did scenes from your past come back to you?         My past flashed before me, out of my control.     I understood that I was victimizing myself and that I saw only the negative. Now I see life from the good side and I live with the positive.  
  
Did scenes from the future come to you?         No

God, Spiritual and Religion:       

What importance did you place on your religious/spiritual life prior to your experience?         Not important to me

Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:       

During your experience, did you gain special knowledge or information about your purpose?      Yes   I have extrasensory perceptions that are developing. I feel the need to transmit them, but I don't know how. I have to help people to grow, thanks to my personal development.  

Did you believe that our earthly lives Are meaningful and significant prior to your experience?         Are not meaningful and significant  

  During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?         Yes     Seeing the good side of things. There's always a life lesson in every negative or difficult experience.

Did you gain information about how to live our lives?         Yes     Personal development is the key to evolve and to be in accordance with your mission of life, chosen before the incarnation.  

During your experience, did you gain information about life's difficulties, challenges and hardships?         Yes     Seeing the good side of things, there's always a life lesson in every negative or difficult experience.  

Were you compassionate prior to your experience?         Moderately compassionate toward others  

During your experience, did you gain information about love?         Yes     Love is everywhere, you just need to accept seeing it in all things.  

Were you compassionate after your experience?         Greatly compassionate toward others  

  What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         Large changes in my life.     I understood the universal laws of life, and I understood that you choose your incarnation, and that, whatever happens, you always have a choice.  
  
Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          Yes I left the father of my son.  

After the NDE:       

Was the experience difficult to express in words?        Yes   There are sensations that are experienced and felt, being far from human sensations, as at that moment you change the energetic dimension, everything is very subtle.  

How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  At the time I was in a difficult situation, and wanted just one thing, dying to stop suffering. My only memories, except of the experience, are from suffering, and I succeeded to transmute everything, thanks to the near-death experience.  

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         Yes     I became a link person for souls. I have magnetism and above all I have the capacity for communication with risen masters, like archangels, and I have access to the akashic annals.  

  Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    It took me 12 years to talk about. During my studies as nursing auxiliary, a professor told us about NDE and I talked to him after the course. Since that time, I have the need to transmit this experience, since I know that science and medicine are getting closer to the ND.  
  
Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       No     

  What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real.     This was very real for me, due to the fact of seeing my life scrolling, which was a very strong experience for me.  
  
  What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real.     This experience happened to me, to allow me to transmit it, in order to help people that are not able to evolve spiritually.  
  
At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       No     

Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?         The questionnaire is very clear and sometimes there are too many questions that are difficult to reply to, as we have global answers, and detail is very hard to explain by computer.
