EXPLANATORY.
Tlhe National Education Scheme is the joint concern
of the Spiriitualists' National Un1on and the British
Spi11i•tualists' Lyceum Union, but each Union has
undertaken to finance and administer a given Section.
The B. S. L. U. admin.isiters the Associate Section
(O,al Crade to Crade V.); and the S.N. U. administers ~
the Craduate Section (Entrance Examination-which
is 1identical ·wu:tJh Grade V .-to Final),
The names of Final Grade candidates who obtain
not less than 75 per cent. marks are forwarded to the
S.N.U. Exponents Committee Secretary, to whom
ithese students may (if they so desi·re) apply for the
s.N. u, Diploma of Certificated Exponent.
In addition, the College aiwards i1ts Diploma of
Associate (A.N,S.C.) to Grade V. students who obtain
not less than 70 per cent. marks; of Craduate
(G.N.S.C.), to Final Grade students who obtaiin not
less tihan 75 per cent. marks; and of Diplomate
(D.N.S.C.), to Graduates who obtain 'the S.N. U.
Diploma of Certificated Exponen;t.

TO ALL TUT.'?IJ..liJ .q~N.QY~TORS AND
CANDIDATES.
. The Education Commi1Jtee has realised tliat many;
who ot.herwise w~uld d:ake up tthe Education Soheme,
are unable to do so because of the di;ffi.culty of finding
Tutors or of arranging mid-week classes ; and also that
many •well-informed and competent Spiritualists would
gladly act as tutors if they only knew how to set about
tlhe task. To meet ithese dlifficulties, the :following !hints
and lesson plans have been drawn up ; and it ·is hoped
the 'l"esult will lbe a gre~t increase in the number of
students-and of candidates sitting at the eXB;min.adons.
Each Grade has been catered for, froJD the Oral
Grade upwards. The suggested Session Programme
will be useful! to students in Grades " Oral " to IV.,
and the programmes for Groups or Mid-week Clas~es
can i;>e used by students who have •to do the best they
can wi1
thout a Tutor. The Sections on " How to Set "
and ' 1 How to Answer " Questions will be of g.reat
ass.istance to hoth Tutors and Students, and the '' soli,
tary .student '' who str-icitly follows the in:structions in
setting and answering hiis own questions will \have no
d~fficulty iin oan.siwering those set by the examiners.
THE BOOKS REQUIRED,
4-11 Grades require a LY01tUm M~llU~I and a copy of
the Examination Syllabus.
In addition, the work of the various Grades is
coveted by Special Handbwks, as follows :-

Manual selectiions for ALL the Grades to be taken .in

course of eleven weeks.
We would suggest that no 1item be omitted, even
though i•ts patiticular Grade is not being taken lby any
candidate. We advise this, as the Lyceumsts will thus
become familiar wit!h eacih selection; and, .in working
tlhrougih .the Grades later, this famiJ.iarity wm be
helpful.
There will be man~ .weeks lef.t, on completing the
programme, before the time of tihe exam~naitions. lt is
left to the discretion of Conductors whether they wil\
devote these remaining weeks to working througih the
prog.ramme a second time ; or whether, in tlbe remain-
ing sessions, tlhey will specialise on •the Manual read-
ings set for just the particular Grade or Grades for
whiclh tiheir Lyceumists are preparing
Where a Lyceum holds Groups, we would suggest
that all students for the same Grade be in tlle same
Group (j.rres:pootive of age) ; and itlbat the Handbook
be studied, as planned out in the time-tables given in
tihis bQok.
6
Another suggestion .is •that it.he Groups might be
organised in accordance wilth the Education Scheme
grading~the number of Groups depending on the size
of the Lyceum, as follows :-
Group I. under 8 Group II. 8 to 10
Group III. ... 10 to 12 Group IV. 12 ,to 13
Group V. 13 to 15 Group VI. 15 to 17
(Li:berty) Group VII. 17 years old and over.
If necessary, Groups II. and III. could be combin.ed.
\Vith this Grading the work of the Syllabuses could
be made the basis of 1the Study Prog·mmmes for •the
Groups ; .and in this way every Lyceumist would
actually work through the Scheme, and become a
possible candidate for the Examinations.
In the Oral Grade Group, study and memorise the
questions and answers set in the Oral Crade Primer,
and .read i1ts oompaion booklet, ''The Oral Crade
Reader." Oral Group Leaders are recommended to
read the Oral Grade Leaflet (post free from the General
Secretary) .

HOW TO CONDUCT
WEEK·NICHT GLASSES OR CROUP LESSONS.
The following Schemes plan out 16 weeks of work
for the tutors who are able t() hold week-night classec;,
but could also be used by s•tudenrt:s to whom. such
faciliities ·are denied. lit iis hoped, however, tlhat,
whether or not Lyceums adopt the Edu~tion Scheme
as a policy, ev•ery Lyceum Committee will see that no
obstacles are placed ·in ithe way of individual Lyceumists
who wish to study for it:lhe examination.
If classes beg,in >in mid~Sepiterniber, at- tlhe end of the
sixteenth week every Handbook •article. will ·have been
studied. twice in Grades 1.-1-11. and once in Grades
IV.-V. ;-and there will lbe :plenty of time lef.t ifor
revision. lit lhas been l~h to eaGh tutor· to dieci~e in
what subjects the various students are ~eakest; a.nd
to plan out ithe revision lessons accordingly.
Each studenit should possess a iMam~al, the Iiland-
book for the Gm.de, ia Syllabus, '' Summaries. and
Glossaries," a note book and two exercise !books. The
exercise b@ks s~o4Jd be used on. al.tern.at.~ weeks., to
answe·r. q4es~ion,s si:;t by the tutor-No. 1 bo~ to
be used for tlhe first set., anct left wiith tlhe tut~r· for
correction ; to lbe returned, wiith useful hlnts, wlhe~ No.
2 book is handed in with the second set of ans~rs.
The first half-h{)ur of class work .should be devpted
to discussing the corrections and !hints, and all impor-
tant poin1ts shoukl he entered in the .note-lbooks.
It is well underntood t'ha.t many TUJtors coulq' not
possibly S{l<lre the time necessary for the plan reQ9m-
mended above-and for these the following alternanives
are suggesteq :-
One plan wpuld be t!hat. Tutors slhould' read through
the answer!' apd .uni;l.erline those parts with which tlhey
are not quite satisfied, and bring these forwal'..d in dis-
cussion at the next meeting oif •tfue Class. 4
- -- -~--- - - --~----~------
--~- ·----~---·~--
9
· Another plan. would be for students to bring their
answers to the Class. Each question would be taken
in turn, and each student wou.ld read ou.t his or her'
answer ; this being followed by a general discussion of'
ali the answers-a summary of the discussion being;
recorded by 1the students in their note-books before the:
consideration of the next question.
During " Final Revision," the hints and suggestions
in the inote-book!:i, with the notes and .summaries from.
'' Summaries and Glossa11ies '' should lbe memorised, .
and both Manual and Handbook read and re-read as
often as possible.
If the course of situdy laid down, is fully carried out,
nothiµg but nervousness should prevent a.ny student._
from reaching a hig1h standard in the examinations.
N .B.-lt shoLild be pointed out to the students tl'!a,t
they do not come to the Croup or the MIJl·Week ·
Class to ·learn their lessons, but to study and dis· ·
cuss the lessons they have learned at hon'le. The Class'
should only be used for the interchange of knowledge
a~d opinions, under the guidance of the Tutor.
But this rule, like every other general rule, r
has exceptions, and these apply to teaching
irt · the · Lower· 'Gtade:s. · With Grad~s I. 'and
II. - especially with studenh'· ·at the ' age'
minimum-actual teach!ng in, the Group period is
often necessary. In that case it is suggested as a
good plan to show •the .students how to make notes
on the items discussed. A Reading or section could be
explained, notes written -0n. at, and then questions on
t...e Reading or se~tion answered ve-rbally, as prepara-
tion for written answers.
.r·· , .
The portion of the S.C.R. or M.R. set for each week
should be memorised. The G. C.R. portions should be
studied at home and .read in the· Class, the students
being encouraged to ask ,each other questions. But in
all cases the·Smnmaries should he learned, as they deal
with ea~h selection as a whole, whilst vet mentioning
every in\;pol"tartt point. · · '
10
The Tutor should see that each student is supplied
with a copy of this pamphlet, a.nd that ·the section on
" How to Answer Questions "·is thoroug:hly and care-
fully studied ; ·insisting that all answers shall be written
as there dir:;ected. It would not be a bad plan to ask
the students to p\JJt down, before each answer, tlhe kind
of answer that was required ; and as the student will
be answering ·the questions at home, wirt:h this pamphlet
before him, this will lbe no lhardship---.but very good
training for the actual test. The Tutor himself should
carefully study the section on, 11 How to Set Questions,•'
so as to ensure that only questions !helpful to tlie
student will -be asked.
Where difficulty jg experienced in getting written
work done at home, a monthly " Test Night "-in
class-is recommended.
No class shou[d be allowed to close until every diffi-
culty of every student !has been explained and removed;
and students should get ftrst chance of removing these
difficulties before the Tutor takes any part.
As ithe examination date approachesh examination
practice should be given by setting the papers set at
previous examinations-under examination conditions.
Sets of these can be obtained (post free, 1id.) from
the General Secretary.

PRINCIPLES OF
SPIRITUALISM.
ORIGIN OF MoDERK
SPIRITUALISM.
THl;: SPIRlTUALIST
LYCEUM.
T·he Tutor should point ouit important points from
the Handbook selections. The Origin of Modern
Spiritualism and The Spiritualist Lyceum are othe most
important articles in the Handbook ; but Children in
Spirit Life and the study of Alfred Kitson are also of
great importance. Where poss~ble, :the articles have
been divided into sections, and each of these should
be studied-firnt iby itself, and then in relation to the
other sections. The twtor should advise the students to
learn not only each ip~inciple but also the .notes, as
these will supply material for answering questions on
the lessons taught by the .Principles. In the "Pioneers"
lesson ithe difference in the kind of pioneer work done
by the various mediums and the investigators should be
poiinted out. For iinstance, a good exercise would be
to " Compare the pioneer work done by Capron
Draper, (or Mrs. T.amlin) and Judge Edmonds."
As mudh writing as possible should be done, a:s a
preparation for tihe examination.

·Students should be set questions asking them to
discuss and express opinions on iportfons of the Manual
selections-and all answers should be carefully d:iecked.
The summar~es should he memorised.
Tutors should note the difference in charaoter be-
tween Handbooks Nos. I and II. Handbook No. I
supplies all the information that the student will be
expeCted to possess; but No. II. only suggests what
should ibe studied. And tlhe Notes only expand t!he sug-
gestion---fl:hey don't supply •the information. So the
Grade II. Tutor must fill in, and enc.ourage the
students to help him in filling in, the broad outlines
given in the lessons. Grade II. is harder than Grade
I., for tlhe student has to find for himself 1the infonna-
tion suggested,, in.stead of !having it supplied for lhim.
Grade· II. Tuto~s will have to work at least as hard
as any of 1the students, but the reward ·is great.
In situdying ithe " Principles," only the words in
large type should be memorised-the Notes need only
be read.
Parngraph 9 on tpages 8--9 should be read and re-
read and fully <liscused. 1t is a s.ummary of the case

Dates are not so importah.t as events in the study of
the " Rise and· Progress," but the dates of all vital
events oin the history of the Movement should be

.Questions should be 1set to test the students' grasp
of·the growth of the Movement and of •the pain.ts of
agreement and disagreement between. Spiritualism and

Orthodox Christianity. If examples of mediumship are
provided, each student should be asked to write a full
account and cri<ticism of. what transpires.

The weekly class ·should last at least an hour and a
quarter-divided into two half-hours and a quarter-
hour. The first half-hour oould be devoted to discuss-
ing the hints and suggest-ions made· on <the previous
week's answers (marked by -the 1tutor at home) ; the
second half-hour to discussing and criticising the
present form of Session programme (as described
aind e~plain.ed at the beginning of t'he Lyceum
Manual) ; a.nd the remaining time ·to settii.ng the fol-
lowing week's questions and home work. This wiN
mean plenty of home work for both tutors and sti.ldents
-but we a.re taking it for gra.n:ted that they have laid
themselves out to provide the Movement with efficient
Croup Leaders and Condu.ctors.
15
Eac:h week the student should prepare notes for a
10-minutes' address on the Manual selection set for
study. He should also
(1) Draw up a Lyceum Session Programme, showing
the connective teaching;
(2) W·rite an Invocation (about 150 words) and a

(4) Write a short essay on the Handbook section.
N.B.-The student will find " Summaries and Glos-
saries '' of great assistance when preparing notes for
addresses and explanations to various Groups, and is
advised to obtain and study the booklet, memorising all
the summaries (as an aid to quick thought).
The followmg Notes for an add·ress on G.C.R. 136
were submitted by a Grade IV. candidate wiho passed
with Honours :-
This gives us proof of continued existence afetr
death;
Death is only an experience of our immortal ex-
istence--.therefore accordi1ng to Divine Law ;
The next stage of our existence is a natural one,
and therefore we 'have nothing ·to fear ;
Our status In the next spheres depends upon. ithe use
we have made of our oppontunities while in this life;
We are not to be fettered by the dogmas or
opinions of ot!hers-or expect others to be fettered by
&urs;
The collectlon of facts by all (Science) is necessary,
anc:i comparisons must ibe made withouJt 'bias in order to
gain ·the truth ;
Spiritual·ism gives an Incentive to find good and do
good.
(We have put each leading thought in black letter, as
a guide).

. Crade IV. Candidates are strongly recommended to
o~titin the Oral Crade Aeader (7d. post free from the;
Ceneral Office), and study c•refully the Lessons therem
in set out-giving special attention to the lntroductory
Olfat ·about croup ·L.eaders, Which deals with the
fundamental principles of Class-teaching, and suggests
h.o~ they might be applied in the Lyceum Croups.
· The Education Secretaries also urge the adoption
of the Monthly Meeting of Conductors and Leaders
suggested in this " Chat," as· an aid to raising. the
general standard of Lyceum work.
CRADE V LESSON PLAN,
This will be found, w~th the new Grade V. Syllabus.-~
in the Griade V. Leaflet, which can be obtained from
the GeneraJ Secrebary en ap-plica•1Jion (enclosing a
ltd. s•tarn.ped .envelope).
i J.n addition, we would suggest that the articles m
Handbooks I. and II., bearing on subjects akin to
those in Grade V. Syllabus, will repay revision and
use.
HINTS ON HOW TO SET QUESTIONS.
. Requests have been made that help be given in the
rnaHer of setting questions, to give the students prac-
tice. in writing answer.s, such as will be required at 1:1he
a~tual Examination in iMay.
And _as ·this pmctice iin writing answers i,s a highly
important part of ithe work, and as ~t ·is ·the Tutor's.
work to set such questions ·and to correct the answers, .
we here give the hints on the subject as requested.
H.int~..-ior Tutors.
(a) First read carefully, and become very familiar
with, the. c)lapter, article, or Manual sel~tion.. Tihen
wake notes on the topics wiith which it deals.
(b) Arrange these· now in Main Divisions, accord-
ing- to the chief points •that are .considered. Under each
-~----
--~--------
17
Main Division (or Heading) .put the (c) sub-divisions
(or sub-headings) that naturally belong to that topic.
Now you are ready for setting tJhe questions.
The setting of Questioll"S,
Quesitions can be set two ways, viz., to deal with
a Main Div.ision-and needing a fairly long and full
answer ; or to deal wi:th on.e or more sub-divisions.
requiring shorter answers.
(a)1 For Junior Students, ask only questions that
deal with actual facts, that· can reasonably be expected
to be known from the section studied, and that are
contained jn the text, or iin the supplemenitary notes
given by 1the Tutor.
(b) For Senior Students, ask C!J.Uestions thait give
scope for discussion, or for expressions of opinion (with
reasons on whiclh based), or that require ithe applica·
tion of the knowledge g.a~ned from the studies.
EXAMPLE IN THE APPLICATION OF THESE
RULES.
In, ord~ to· show -the applicaiti<>n· of ·these rules, we
will consider a section that; has to be studied by the
candidates for all the Grades, viz., G.C.R. 148.
A. Ori .a.nalygjng: this Gi C.R. we find that it deals
wi.ith:-
(i) Spirituiail.i~ Srinday Sclhools'.
(ii) Their founder.
{liii) The viision.
('iv) 'Dhe first Lyceum on eaPth·.
(v) Our pledge~
B. Arranging these topic's in their Main Divisions, we
get:-
(i) Lyceums on ear0
1Jh.
(ii) Lyceums in the Summerland.
C. The Sub-Divisions are :-
under (U:i (a) W.hat a Lyceum· ·is.
/
~-
18
(b) The need for Lyceums.
(c) Their objects.
(d) Their onigin.
(e) Their Founder.
(f) How he got his idea.
(g) The first Lyceum on earth.
(h) Our debt as Lvceumists.
(i) Why incurred. ·
(j) Our pledge.
~ under (ii), (a) How we got tthe informatfon.
(h) The members of a Lyceum in •the
Summerland.
(c) Wiher•e Lyceums are !held.
(d) Groups.
(e) Colours.
(f) Leaders.
(g) Lessons.
(h) Methods.
(i) Other Lyceum activities.
QUESTONS ON THE MAIN DIVISIONS.
(a) For Junior Students,
A question on. 1:1he first Main Division could be:-
"What hav.e you learned from G.C.R. 148 about Ly-
ceums, as known on earth?"
A full answer would naturally deal wirt:h all the
poin:ts given briefly as the sub-divisions of this main
one. But, oin the answer, these !headings would be
amplified, and made into para.graphs.
On the second Main Division we might ask:-" Say
alt you can about Lyoeums i.n tlhe Summerland, as told
in G.C.R. 148."
A full answer would then deal with tlhe headings
given as sub-divi1sions of this main one, but would
give the d.iaots in full, e~panding each heading into
a paragraph.
(Ii) For Senior Students.
The .answer to 1Jhe questions set for Senior Students
would not .only give itlhe aotual £.acts, as stated in the
19
fi. C.R., but would use these facts as a basis for
opinions, or for t:he purposes or deductions or compari-
sion. Also, some application of the knowledge would
reasonably be expected.
A quest.ion on the first Main Division oould be:-
,' How far do our good Lyceums achiev·e the olbject.s
set out for us in G.C. R. 148? Wherein, i.n vour
opinion, do they fail, and what is the .remedy?',.
or,
" Justify 1:he claims made in the last Conduetor's
part; from- what the prect><ling- sect·ions of this G.C. R.
teach a.nd sugges<t:."
On the second Main Division might be :asked :-
" \Vhat is done in Lyceums in the Summerland not
yet realised in our Lyoeums? To wihiart: degree of
similarity do you oonsider it possibl.e for us to attain,
and by what means?"
QUESTIONS ON THE SUB-DIVISIONS.
These are useful chiefly as a preliminary course, to
prepare •the way for answering the bigger and more
difficult questions and are of such a nature ithat ·the
answers could often !be given orally.
As a first course it would serve ,a useful purpose to
ask simply tihe questions actually found •in the G.C.R.
itseH, tlte s.tudenits to answer in their own words, or in
the words of tlhe Manual.
A second time (after the lap,se of some days), the
same questions might be asked, but in different words.
11hen the Tutor could ask questions o'f his own that
required the facts of two or three sub-divisions for the
complete answer. This would prepare the way to the
longer .answers needed for the questions on the Main
Divis.ions.
EXAMPLES.
For duniors.
"Wihart: is meant by a Lyceum, and why are Lyceums
needed?''·
20
" Wihy should Lyceumists be g'rateful to A. J.
Dav.is?
" How did A. J. Davis obtain lb.is knowledge aibout
Lyceums?"
" Why are colours of impertance in Sumtnerland
Lyceums·?"
" How does one Lyceum in the Summerland keep in
touch witih others?"
" What faculties are called into play to a great ex-
tent in the lessons given in Lyceums in the Sttmmer-
land?"
For· S8hi6YS,
" If asked by an Orthodox friend why Lyceums are
of impor:tance what answer would you give·?"
" What are the special claims of A. J. Davis ori our
g·ratitude and remembrance?''
" W1hat must be the obvious qualifications of
Leaders in Summerland Lyceums to .enable tlliem •to
teadl in ifhe manner oindicilted in this G.C.R. ?"
Tu:tws W'ill easilv be able to ask other questions on
the Jin.es indicated.·
N.B.-When your students have answered a: ques-
tion, in writing, and you ihave c0rreoted it, time' ca'i1 be"
profitably spenil: in going through the answ~rs. in class,
touching oil the general' mistakes and omissioos, arid
tening how to .avoid similar errors next time. Then
loek through· each individual an.s'Wer, and pbin'fi out to
its writer why= ntarks were deducted, What points· of
importance were omitted, and what was put in tihat
was unnecesary or not •to the point.
HOW TO ANSWER. QUESTIONS.·
First, r·ead• it:he question carefully, attd· fin:d out
exactly what you are being asked to do. The different
21 .
kin~Is of qµest·jons that may be asked are given under
in ~!P,~,l;l l~tt~r, and the type of answer required is
given a.f~r.
1. (a) If you arc asked for facts and details, only-
Put down the facts and detaiils as you would itell
them to an .inquirer wlho asked you the same question.
(b) If asked for opinions, onJy-
First state your opinion and then state your reasons
for holding the opinion. Arrange your answer so that
each opinion will adse from the preceding one and lead
to the following one. Keep your strongest argument
to t:he last~so as to " Clinoh " your answ.er.
(c) H asked tor facts and opinions-
State llrst your opinions, sihowing :how tJ1ese
opinions arc justified by the fadis. Always proceed
from facts to opinions and reasons.
(ct) If asked to deal genQ!l'aJly with a whole sub·
j~--
Givc gencraIJy known and accepted facts and
opinions on the suhjeot-adding origina:l facts and
opinions of your own.
(e) If ask.ed tp go into det~ils on sQl1]e oarticular
part of a subject-
Arrange your details so as to make J!hem initerest-
ing, anstructive, and convinoing ; and pa1·ticularly .note
for which part you ·are asked.
2. Wlhen asked to compare two subjects (sudh as
Spiritualism and Orthodox Ohristianaity), always (a)
state imRM~i~llY all that you know for and against
both; pqimt ouit (b) where they agree and (c) where
they differ; and (d) then give your own opmions.
Don't give what you know of oine and ·what you think
of the other, or what you know iin favour of one and
what you know ~n.st •the otlher, as this is noit only
unfair and misleading hut utiterly foolish.
q. Never answer ~Qre /ltlan you a.re aS.k~. Check
yQJ.1.J:~~H 1by ·r~ding the question at intervals whilst
wi;i'l;iug ~'llr ~·~~r.
4. When Summary-wniiting is being priaotised, it
should be impressed on all students that a Summary
is a brief statemenrt:, in the student's own words, of all
the most important ipoims in :the gjven piece ; ibUit giv,en
in such manner that a reader who diid not know the
original piece would be able to learn, from the Sum-
mary, a fair accou111t of what the author thad tried to
cl.Urn or t,each.
Y.J>ur own opinions should not be sitated-you must
put down what the author says, whether you agree
with it or not. (Tlhis is not an alternpt to make you
accept other people's opinions against your better judg-
ment. The idea is to test your power of gra1Sping other
people's poirnts of view. Compare G.C.R. 138 wiitJh i:ts
Summary on pages 7-8 of " Summariies and Glos-
saries.'').
5. Bwt if asked for the lesson of a Manual selec-
tion-then you would give your opinion of what it
teaches, and whether the teaching is helpful. A good
way is to descnihe how you feel when reading it, and
what you think it urges you •to do.
6. If asked for a Connective Readiing a£ter a given
verse-don't ,write a short essay (you are asked for 100
words only). Read •the verse until you grasp tJhe
general 1idea ,of :its 1teadhing, then wdte down any ideas
that come to you as a result. Srt:udy the Connective
Readings in the Manual (especially M.R. 's 223, 236
and 238) a.nd you will find that usually 1they-(a) rnve
the J.esson of tihe verse; (b) Suggest how we may
carry the teachings of tJhe verse into effoot; (c) Show
how our Lives would he the better and Jiappier :for
prutting tlhe teachings into .practice; or (d) Link up
the <teachings of the verses.
N.B.-S.C.R.'s 4, 51 and 93, from which tihese
verses are set, should be committed to memory.
7. H' asked for NOTES, do not write them as you
would write an essay, Make tJhern as brief as possible
-omitting every unnecessary word. In good notes,
a word or a short phrase wiill suggest a whole series
23
of poi.nts to lbe men.tioned in an address. The Notes
on G.C.R. 136 (given in tihe Grade IV. Section on
page ) , are a good .example-being brief, but sug-
gestive of the teachings of the Reading.
8. If asked to DISCUSS a statement-do not limit
your answer to your own opinions only. To discuss is
to examine critically. Both FOR and AGAINST the
statement must be given, and your answer should con-
clude with your summing up or personal opinions (or
findings) on the statement. The Examiner, on reading
your answer, should have an jdea o.f all that is known
or thought on the subject, as well as what you think
about it.
NOTE.-'Bhe examiners can judge your knowledge
in only one way-from what you say (or don't say) in
your answers. So if vou are careless and put in things
you were not asked for, or leave out things you were
asked for-or if your facts and opinions and reasons
are all jumbled up-the examiner concerned will con-
clude <that you either don't know or don 'it understand
your subject, and wiill g~ve you few, if any, marks.
Tutors and students are recommended to ·read the
Education Article in the Lyceum Banner each month,
as in it appear fu11ther hints and information to help
them.
