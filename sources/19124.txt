century
so without any further Ado I&#39;d like to
introduce a very good friend of mine
he&#39;s a renowned civil rights and
constitutional attorney
Daniel Sheehan of as you all know that
he did the Pentagon papers representing
the New York Times he also did the silk
case nuclear case
he&#39;s done many civil rights case to KKK
case in Greensboro and others but he&#39;s
worked with us since the 1990s and early
2000s as a constitutional advisor and
attorney
who&#39;s who&#39;s very accomplished and was
part of how we came to the assessment
that the National Security State
operations that are unacknowledged
special access projects are in fact
breaking the law they&#39;re illegal in
their Rogue and therefore all the
witnesses and all the material we have
that will come from classified sources
we have been able to bring out to the
public with impunity and to this date no
one has challenged that assessment so
I&#39;d like to welcome
Daniel shin
well I I uh I have the Good Fortune of
getting you while you&#39;re totally
exhausted uh and and so this is sort of
a closing uh argument if you will of the
day uh We&#39;ve we&#39;ve covered an awful lot
of different subjects here
kind of different strands that you&#39;ve
seen there&#39;s like a whole dozen
different things that we&#39;ve talked about
and what I want to do is I just want to
kind of bring it together here sort of
Hit the at the end of the day
uh and and try to be clear about what
the implications are of what we&#39;re
talking about here
that that uh we we know that the one of
the fundamental questions that we&#39;ve got
that we all share
is uh whether or not an actual other
intelligent civilization exists an
extraterrestrial civilization uh of
another intelligent and highly
technologically developed but
categorically distinct species
uh or one or more exist uh
this is a fundamental question that has
brought us all together I think that
that basically the reason we&#39;re all here
together is because we have had a a
different kind of unique response to
standing out under the stars
you know when when we look up into the
the nighttime sky and see a star pulsing
in the distance we have since we&#39;ve been
small children uh experienced that as a
an existence of another star with other
planets and other beings and that we&#39;ve
had a a a deep kind of uh overwhelming
sense that what we&#39;re doing here uh in
our day-to-day lives is not in harmony
with that reality
that we&#39;ve got in this kind of bizarre
uh reductionist view of reality that we
end up you know drawing you know lines
in the sand and threatening to to kill
someone if they come onto our property
uh and uh and use our intelligence to
sort of dig into the Earth and dig up
the minerals and develop
bullets and weapons to do that uh and it
is so incongruous with this dimension of
reality that we have known about uh and
experienced since we were children
and so that that that ultimate question
we have I think uh had an answer to that
in our own conscience uh since we&#39;ve
been small uh and that it&#39;s baffling
that other people have not acknowledged
this the the the schools we go to the
churches we go to the political parties
that we all participate that have never
wanted to acknowledge that they stay
completely fixated on this kind of
reductionist view of reality
uh so this is the one of the most
important uh issues that we&#39;re dealing
with now and we we&#39;ve crossed I think
into a a new era on that within our own
lifetimes some of our lifetimes are a
little longer than others uh here
uh but but I I remember uh distinctly
when when I I first raised this issue
when I was a legal counsel at the Jesuit
headquarters
in Washington D.C uh that that I was
there when it you may have heard about
is I got contacted by the Congressional
research Service uh Science and
Technology division uh they&#39;ve been
asked by President Carter to to prepare
to classified reports one on the
existence of extraterrestrial life and
the second one on whether or not at
least some of these UFO encounters might
actually represent vehicles
from another civilization of
extraterrestrial civilization and I was
contacted by Marcia Smith who was the
head of the Science and Technology
division of the Congressional research
service and and to ask whether I as
legal counsel at the Jesuit national
headquarters office of Social Ministry
whether I would be able to get access to
the Vatican Library
for the study and secure the information
they had on these two subjects
and and I I brought up the Father Bill
Davis who was my immediate Superior I
was a candidate for the the Jesuit
priesthood at the time and I went to
Father Davis and and explained to him
why I thought this was so
extraordinarily important that we ought
to respond to this in a positive way and
he convened the uh the assistant uh
provincials for all 10 provinces in the
United States who are in charge of
Social Ministry and we got their consent
to doing this and that&#39;s an
extraordinarily important step that took
place there
with the largest single order of the
Catholic Church the largest single
denomination uh in all of Western
Civilization to agree that we would take
the step of going forward and trying to
get the Vatican to to provide this
information
uh and that was when I first became
involved as a as a grown-up
actually uh in a professional in trying
to do something uh about this uh and uh
and that&#39;s how it started and so I
became counseled to the to the special
counsel to the investigation and study
for for the president and uh and ended
up being therefore invited to go to talk
with the top scientist in seti uh the
search for extra terrestrial
intelligence at the jet propulsion
Laboratory
to deliver a closed-door seminar to them
on the theological implications uh of
contact with an extraterrestrial
civilization which it turns out they had
been seriously concerned about as it
turns out there at city so I said just
let me ask you this then whatever the
nature of this tribunal might be can you
tell me whether either or both of the
following questions are going to be at
issue here as a matter of fact number
one whether or not and other highly
intelligent highly technologically
developed but distinctly non-human uh
species exists in an extraterrestrial uh
life I hear and secondly whether at
least some of these vehicles that are
seen around in the UFO phenomena might
actually be a vehicle from another
civilization an extraterrestrial
civilization
realman who the chairman said well
absolutely those two issues are at stake
here and it&#39;s totally ridiculous for
anybody to believe either one of those
things is true now this is Harvard
University in 1994 is making that type
of Declaration right uh and from between
that time in 1994 and then in 2009
at that whole period of time it turns
out that you have the Vatican the Jesuit
order convening a gathering of world
scientists to come to the Vatican to
Castle Gandalf over the for the the
papal Observatory is spending a whole
week briefing the Cardinals on the
elements are and they come out and they
go to the Vatican and deliver an
official statement on the part of the
Roman Catholic Church saying that in
light of the discovery of more and more
of these new uh these new planets uh
these exoplanets uh that it now appears
that much sooner than we&#39;d anticipated
that we&#39;re going to discover that
there&#39;s life elsewhere in our universe
and therefore the time has arrived for
the beginning of a very serious
conversation among our human family
about the philosophical and Theological
implications
of this discovery
and so that was that&#39;s an official
statement from the from the Roman
Catholic Church here in western
civilization and so now now we have the
situation where the United States
pentagon
is announcing uh basically on the front
pages of the New York Times
that yes the UFOs are real
they&#39;re real
and yet you hear this bizarre response
from them all saying but we can&#39;t figure
out what they are
we don&#39;t we don&#39;t know what this really
is uh and so that the that we&#39;ve heard
the information today about what the
potential implications of that type of a
situation uh is what those implications
are that they know that they&#39;re that
they&#39;re not uh that they&#39;re not Russian
they know that they&#39;re not Chinese
so we have a we have a couple questions
in front of us here that we really need
to take away from our discussion today
and all the thousands of people that are
listening to this out around the world
is that there are some pivotal questions
here we we now know that the the
institutions of the the major Catholic
Church in in western civilization are
taking the position that is now clear
that there&#39;s extraterrestrial life now
for the very first time uh they&#39;re
they&#39;re uh now the Pentagon is
acknowledging the UFOs are real
uh the question that we have in front of
us here in the evidence is starting to
roll in on this is has the United States
government come into physical possession
of any of these vehicles
uh and there&#39;s ample evidence now that
is perfectly clear that we&#39;ve come into
possession of some of these right uh in
their particular instances we all talk
about over Roswell in the 1945 crash in
the other uh in the in the next question
is is there any evidence that we are
engaged in some effort to duplicate
these to back engineer and generate
these things uh so that we would end up
having access to this technology
and there&#39;s growing evidence that
they&#39;re clearly have been trying to do
this
so the big question here that you&#39;ve
gotten posed to you today with evidence
that you may not have heard in the past
one of the pivotal questions is uh have
they succeeded in doing this
or are they still trying to do it like
you know in the Deep background
interviews yeah yeah we haven&#39;t been
able to do it yeah you&#39;re right you
caught us we got some of these vehicles
and we&#39;ve been trying to do but we
haven&#39;t really been able to do it yet uh
you know so that that fact question is
one that&#39;s pivotal if you were a juror
and you had to try to decide when you go
back into the Jury Room to try to figure
out the answers to these questions you
have to ask yourself
is there evidence now that is going to
cause you to be convinced that we have
in fact
some of us in this country in some
governing Elite circles have actually
mastered the technology
so that we&#39;re actually flying these
things around
so that we now are confronted all of us
in this room and people that are
listening around are actually confronted
for the first time in our life with if
we were out on a dark Starry Night in a
big UFO came around and landed in the
field like this we would instead of
saying
fantastic great I feel like Betty and
Barney Hill I&#39;m getting set to be able
to go and meet people from an
extraterrestrial civilization and you
find out their U.S military people I
mean what a bummer that is you know I
mean what a bummer I mean these people
are messing with our life Ambitions of
getting to have that experience and here
we are dealing with guys in camouflage
or something so we need to be able to
answer that question
okay and if we answer that question that
they have developed the technology and
they are flying around and presenting
themselves and they know perfectly well
that the response that our people are
having is oh my God great they&#39;re UFOs
are here that we can see them we finally
get in the in that we know that they&#39;re
doing that
the second question that is posed was
here today in our discussions is why in
the world are they doing that
why are they doing that why haven&#39;t they
revealed this technology why are they
spending
billion hundreds of billions of dollars
building big rocket ships you know to
put people in capsules and send them up
under Rockets to go to the moon and
multi-billion dollar programs that
they&#39;re allowing and praising and
getting us all cheering them going up
into space with these gigantic Flames
rolling out of the bottom of their their
rocket you know and blowing up people on
the Challenger and getting people killed
you know I mean why are they doing that
if that&#39;s if if that second question is
answered that way that yes they&#39;ve
mastered the technology and yes they&#39;re
flying around and they know they&#39;re
giving us all the impression that this
These Are UFOs so the the that question
is posed the third question was why in
the world would they be doing that these
are the three questions we&#39;ve brought to
you today
you know that have they mastered the
technology and if they have are they
flying it around and giving us the
impression that they&#39;re UFO people all
around and why are they keeping us from
having this technology why is that who
are these people that are doing this and
these are the three fundamental
questions that have been posed to us
here today and I know that for long
periods of time I&#39;ve been is you know
I&#39;m counsel to the disclosure project
and Council to the citizens uh
disclosure and the counsel to the
Jesuits uh and they&#39;ve been counsel to
John Mack I&#39;ve been doing this over all
the years now and now I&#39;m counsel to you
know trying to make it clear what the
clear questions are that you need to ask
and figure out yourself along with all
of us as a community what the answers to
these questions are because we&#39;re faced
with a very serious situation right here
where there are people in good faith
that have devoted their lives to this
who believe
that these people are engaged in trying
to set up a hoax a false apparent
Invasion or incursion of some sort
on the part of an extraterrestrial
civilization to try to get our human
family led by the United States ruling
Elite
to view all extraterrestrials as a
horrible threat into to establish this
meme in our minds for the next 5 000
years in the future
this is an extraordinarily important
period of time in all of our lives in
the lives of our of our whole Human
family
this is going to determine how our
relationship is established with the
Extraterrestrial civilization that we
all are convinced exists
and that we all have to deal with this
we all have to try to figure out how to
raise our personal Consciousness we have
to learn how to raise the consciousness
of our religious institutions
we have to be able to raise the
consciousness of our governing
institutions and the bottom line is we
have to learn to raise the consciousness
of ourselves
as Citizens as individuals and know that
this is a key thing that we have to do
because the fact of the matter is is
that we have to Merit
we have to Merit our relationship with
the Extraterrestrial civilization
because as you might well imagine
they&#39;ve got some fundamental questions
about the worthiness of our whole
species
and there&#39;s a lot of evidence that
raises fundamental questions about this
and we&#39;ve all gone along through our
lives some more or less you know
ignoring that challenge that we all have
somehow participate in the process of
helping to raise the consciousness of
our our human Community here
but the fact of the matter is the the
issue is now put to us
and some pretty Stark terms because we
have now for the first time you&#39;ve got
you know Mark Rubio who was the chair of
the the Senate intelligence committee
you know asking for a full briefing from
the your Office of Naval intelligence
now on what their position is
about this phenomenon and we know
we know that the person who&#39;s the
executive director of that new UAP you
know task force inside the Office of
Naval intelligence has told them in
closed door sessions that the majority
of his staff
believe the Visa
off-world vehicles
that&#39;s what he just said
okay and so that we&#39;ve got to deal with
the fact that there are our low
consciousness
political structures
of the the United States Senate
intelligence committee yes low
Consciousness institutions
who are now in the process of thinking
how to respond institutionally to that
type of a communication
and there are people inside the military
who are trying to tell them that this
constitutes a threat
because they find it in their
institutional interest to be able to get
billions and billions of dollars or more
tax money so they can have more jobs
you know now this this is extremely low
consciousness
functioning here
so our question is is how can we as a
community as a portion of the our human
family
mobilized From This Moment here onward
to try to help raise our entire
Consciousness on this subject so that we
can in fact become The Messengers
of an alternative way of approaching
this whole thing uh and and as you know
the medium is the message to a large
extent we can&#39;t be hostile we can&#39;t be
antagonistic we can&#39;t be accusatory uh
you know we can&#39;t be confrontational uh
and so and so we&#39;ve got to be able to
think about these things ourselves and
what it really comes down to is we have
to answer for ourselves the profound
philosophical and Theological
uh questions
they&#39;re opposed to our whole Human
family which are posed to us as well
and that&#39;s the discussion that we need
to inspire and that&#39;s what we&#39;re trying
to do here this weekend is to encourage
this conversation among ourselves so
that it&#39;s no longer just some of us who
devoted 50 years or more to this to come
and talk with you and get you the
information as to the fact is this has
to be a collective activity on our part
now
we have to respond to the call to to
figure out what the philosophical and
Theological implications are and
internalize our own answers to those
things and go forward as messengers of
this you know and the at the minimum we
have to move very aggressively to stop
the to stop the shifting of weapons up
into space we&#39;ve just come out of a a a
Administration that is now actively
advocated in set up a U.S space force
a military space force to go into outer
space and to bring weapons and to try to
establish full spectrum dominance up
over the planets in our solar system and
and we know that that&#39;s what they&#39;re
trying to do so we have got to roll that
back
and roll back that&#39;s brand new it&#39;s only
been it&#39;s only been here for a matter of
months right we need to roll that back
as best we can and we need to go forward
to help support the setting up of this
treaty on the part of the nation states
of our planet to ban the movement of
weapons into space first by Banning the
basing of any weapons in outer space but
also later prohibiting even the carrying
of these weapons into space
you know and and I don&#39;t I don&#39;t think
that we need to emphasize the fact that
the Extraterrestrial civilization isn&#39;t
going to allow us to do it
because that&#39;s only going to inspire
fear and antagonism and the dialectical
perception of the extraterrestrials what
we have to do is we have to make that
argument ourselves we have to make that
argument to our own fellow citizens and
everybody that we shouldn&#39;t be doing
this
that we can&#39;t be doing this we we cannot
start our next thousands of years of
experience with the Extraterrestrial
civilization on that footing
that we just can&#39;t do that uh and so
that that&#39;s my that&#39;s my uh attempt to
try to draw it together for us to
realize what the takeaway is from uh our
the beginning of our time here together
you know but there&#39;s a there&#39;s a whole
set of discussions that we have to have
you know among ourselves it&#39;s not just a
matter of us standing up here talking to
you it&#39;s a matter of you talking to us
us talking to each other uh us talking
to ourselves
you know of what we&#39;re going to do about
this because this is a very serious
situation I&#39;ve been in a lot of serious
situations gone through the years you
know of you know having people come to
say oh we&#39;ve been having Jim Goodell of
the New York Times legal council call me
say Danny you know I got to have a
meeting with you right away by the way
we&#39;ve got 47 volumes of top secret
classified Pentagon Papers what are we
going to do with them you know which I
said to him the only thing you need to
decide is how big the fox should be on
the front page the New York Times
tomorrow morning but but so but this
this is another situation
and I want to tell you that in every one
of these situations there&#39;s a small
group of people
uh who have to make some very serious
decisions
change history here
to change history
not just to make history because there&#39;s
a momentum going now in the wrong
direction here
so we we&#39;ve got to make history here
we&#39;ve got to change the history that
will happen without us
okay and this includes all the other
people that are listening here today
okay and that&#39;s what our discussions are
going to be for the rest of the time
we&#39;re here for these next few days
together to how we go about doing this
this is a practical question about a
theological and philosophical issue
so that&#39;s what I would like to say okay
all right thank you Danny it was
beautiful and uh just for those who he
didn&#39;t go through all of it but he was
actually taken into a facility when he
was asked by uh folks to get some
material together for President Carter
who had been denied access to these
files and subject by outgoing CI
director George H.W bush who served on
this Committee of two or three hundred
with Andrew Mellon and then later uh
Senator John Warner and I think one one
of the the things that I remember you
sharing was that you actually saw the
the a file the head of photos of a
crashed uh
ET craft that had writing on it I think
once you drew me the the sort of
hierarchy writing on it and so this is
all really very important information
because it goes back decades in their
data point after data point at data
point and I I&#39;m one of my big concerns
is
the discussion is always trying to
recreate the wheel
in the 50s 60s 70s 80s 90s 2000 it&#39;s now
2021. Are UFOs real
or some extraterrestrial do we have
Advanced Technologies
you know I&#39;m mocking it only because
asked and answered asked and answered
and the evidence is overwhelming
and the witness testimony and the
documents and the drawings and this it&#39;s
all there
and what they want people to do is stay
in a cul-de-sac running around a circle
debating the same questions
and and that is a diversion that is a
DDT as I talked about earlier don&#39;t buy
into that
don&#39;t don&#39;t go there we need to start
moving forward because there&#39;s a lost
Century here of Technology knowledge
enlightenment
peaceful Planet free energy
a just social world where there is no
poverty there&#39;s no pollution and this is
not utopian Pollyanna
jibber jabber this is fully able to be
accomplished In Our Lifetime and it
could have been accomplished ironically
before I was born
and I was born in 1955.
so the problem is how much longer are we
going to be killing the planet
and engage in an endless Wars instead of
coming together not only as a human
family I want to add to what Paula
Harris said about always being part of
the human but that was all that would
have been great in about 1900.
too late for that
we&#39;re already being visited by Advanced
civilizations so
I want to close with this sort of
a visualization
for a moment
and all of you take a moment and
consider the fact that if you&#39;re still
awake you&#39;re awake
and the ability the human conscious
Spirit the ability to be conscious
whereby you&#39;re awake you&#39;re awake and
you&#39;re awake
we always are filtering and attaching it
to our own individual selves but there&#39;s
this Consciousness field
this Essence the spirit
of the awake being that is in fact and
been proven to be a universal field that
is not limited by time space body or
individual
this aspect of ourselves this is the
universal being
and we are all that
and we are going to have to identify
with that first
then human and then white or black or
gay or straight or
Catholic or Protestant or Sunni or Shia
and this is why you know I told the
story a couple of times when the first
time I was sitting with Demi Lovato
who&#39;s a actress and singer and I and
during all the rioting and what was
going on in the country in the past year
and I said you know we&#39;re going to have
to go deeper
it&#39;s not enough
to just involve yourself in a sub
culture identity notice that within
culture it&#39;s cult
and I think we have to begin to go
do if we cannot go beyond the tribalism
of division
then we are destined to end up
destroying everything
because we have to honor and look at how
beautiful it&#39;s like a beautiful garden
with all kinds of different colors and
shapes of flowers and plants and what
have you that&#39;s the Human family
but within all those plants
is the sap the cheat the life the energy
that makes that life happen
and there is your point of a commonality
and what&#39;s beautiful about that is that
it&#39;s Universal so if there&#39;s the
civilization from that&#39;s out near
Antares that exists and read into that
particular civilization those beings are
awake and they are conscious
and they may they&#39;re very different I
mean look if we&#39;re still fighting over
our color or whether we&#39;re gay or
straight or male or female
stuck in that kind of stuff for what now
thousands of years how
are we ever going to have any semblance
of peaceful relationship
with these other civilizations we have
to find a point of commonality of
Oneness that transcends
even Humanity
that is the Big Challenge we are facing
and so at the root of all of this
it&#39;s a deeply spiritual problem not
religious spiritual
the essence of a spirit
and that is the conscious field and the
awake being shining alike within all of
us
and so when you look into the eyes of an
extraterrestrial being
don&#39;t be freaked out that they look
different from you it&#39;s like people
being freaked out that someone is a
different color or a different sexual
orientation or a different religion or a
different race or ethnicity
that is where they want you the
demagogues the war mongers they want
everyone to stay at that level fighting
and what we have to do is transcend that
and realize that there is this ineffable
but beautiful and it&#39;s closer to us than
our lives of vain
aspect of ourselves that is a
singularity of consciousness
and that
is infinite and that is operative fully
within every sentient awake being
whether it&#39;s human or extraterrestrial
why is that important because unless we
begin to go beyond what I call EXO
racism
and Paula Harris was referring to this
you know they&#39;re the nordics and they&#39;re
the Grays and they&#39;re the rep you know
it&#39;s just this whole mythology of racism
within this issue and it is racist
um
we have to get into a post-racist era
where not everything is filtered through
your color or your religion or your
ethnicity those are all sort of systems
and identities that are very superficial
who&#39;s a doctor
you know when I&#39;ve seen people cut
past the skin
they all bleed the same color
the brain is all the same within
everybody
and deeper than that is this
consciousness
that is universal
and if we can connect to that
and it doesn&#39;t have to be through
religious fanatical things and what have
you it&#39;s simple it&#39;s mindfulness it&#39;s
being aware of the mind and the
Consciousness and realizing and it&#39;s
been proven experimentally by Dr John at
Princeton and others that that conscious
field isn&#39;t limited to space and time
and it&#39;s Universal and infinite and once
we realize that and we if we go deep
connect to that aspects of ourselves
there are no aliens
they&#39;re all us facing and resonating
throughout the cosmos it&#39;s different
sentient beings at different points on
on the path of Enlightenment and of the
drop of our individualities returning to
the ocean
of the great being that&#39;s the journey
we&#39;re on
and so if we can really stay centered on
that we can go past racism and past
human divisions and past exoracism
because exo-racism is what the
people who manipulate us want us to go
to they want all of us to be United
but around another false dialect another
false otherness
and that otherness this time is alien
and that&#39;s how they&#39;re going to continue
to control Humanity instead of us
becoming free and enlightened in a
civilization that&#39;s enlightened an ugly
future of conflict and Division
and this is our choice we can choose to
be manipulated or not manipulated to be
awake or to be asleep and so everyone
listening
ultimately it is our choice
and when the ET said a new world
if you can take it implied in that if
you will choose to accept this new world
of a peaceful Planet without massive
weapons without division but that&#39;s not
enough
there has to be added this deeper
realization that the conscious Spirit
within us is universal and the
Consciousness within these other life
forms is the same
and to kill one of them is to kill
ourselves
and so we are all one people on The
Motto when I started on this journey in
1990 I founded the ce5 contact
uh initiative and
The Motto that I developed was one
Universe one people there&#39;s actually one
people I use the word people to conclude
not just Homo sapiens but all
intelligent conscious higher intelligent
beings capable of going and out into
space or around their own Planet though
we have to understand that there is one
conscious being shining within all of us
and that is an operative philosophy
that&#39;s ancient and isn&#39;t limited to this
religion or that religion this is an
understanding that is post-religious in
a sense or pre-religious because
religions are organizations it&#39;s not one
political party or another political
party it&#39;s not one race or another race
it&#39;s not one species or another species
and I always want to leave people with
this idea
we have been indoctrinated
since we were born all everyone on this
planet
to identify and be afraid of anything
different from us
this goes back evolution
you know sort of an evolution biology
thousands hundreds of thousands of years
of Human Experience
and we&#39;re a little bit hardwired that
way
where you know if it&#39;s a different tribe
or a different entity it&#39;s different
it&#39;s other it could be a thread it could
kill us
so this is a human experience and
there&#39;s these epigenetic effects of our
experiences that go through thousands of
years that actually encode in our genes
but the reverse can happen
where we begin to accept another higher
consciousness that&#39;s Universal and that
will change our genes that also lights
up epigenetic and Fields we&#39;ll talk
about this this week that then leads to
Enlightenment and Oneness and the end of
war and conflict
and to Universal peace so the foundation
of having peace on Earth and peace in
the heavens is to have the great peace
within and realizing we are all one
people one Universe one people
thank you very much for all your help
and support and I will really appreciate
it if everyone listening online
can wait when you hear that we have
completed this Cosmic hoax documentary
that you between now and then Network
now with everyone you can to get it on
every site possible because it&#39;ll be
free to release and that&#39;s how we&#39;re
going to get the message of Peace but
also the message of a heads up to the
public to not be Fooled Again
we&#39;ve been fooled in the Iraq War we
were tripped into the Vietnam War
there&#39;s been war after war after War
this is the big one this is the last
card we cannot be fooled on this one and
we&#39;re counting on all of us are counting
on each and every one of you to be
ambassadors of the truth and ambassadors
to peace
thank you very much God bless all of you
