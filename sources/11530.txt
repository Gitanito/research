  		              		Experience Description   

    I died from a suicide attempt.  

I watched them wheel my body  past me in the hallway in the hospital.  I watched them work on me.  During this time, there was a man with me. I turned to walk away, but couldn't. The man  turned me back around and told me that I did this, so I had to watch while they worked  on my body.  Then the man said it was time to go.  I turned to walk away with him.  But he told me, 'No, it is my time to go.  Not yours. You are not finished in this life.'  

I heard a beep,  took a deep breath and was looking up at the doctor.  The doctor called the nurses to let them know I was back.
