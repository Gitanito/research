years ago the great Screen Actor Jimmy
Kagney was working with a young actress
that was about to be
fired he went to the director and said
let me talk to her and he walked over to
the actress and he said look it&#39;s
simple you walk in the room you plant
your feet look me in the eye and tell
the truth
the logo of the X Files is the truth is
out there the truth is out
there I&#39;m going to paraphrase the
truth is in
here you&#39;re about to hear the truth I&#39;m
an actor my name is John
Cipher for seven years I walked through
the door planted my feet and tried to
tell the truth as Chief Daniels on Hill
Street Blues as general Craig on the hit
sitcom Major Dad I was two years on
Dynasty year on KN Landing I&#39;ve done
five afternoon soap operas 12 Broadway
shows and 20 films one of the Broadway
shows I did was the great musical man of
lamancha on Broadway I was Richard
Kylie&#39;s original understudy I sang the
words to dream The Impossible Dream to
fight the unbeatable foe to bear with
unbearable sorrow
to run where the brave did not go I&#39;m
here to introduce your host this morning
Dr Steven Greer he&#39;s a man who is
running pel
Mel where the brave dare not
go he was an emergency room physician in
fact the director of emergency medicine
at a major hospital in North
Carolina 3 years ago heent sat his wife
and his four daughters down and said
I&#39;ve been doing this
part-time running after the
truth for seven years
now now I&#39;m going to do it fulltime he
walked away from all that
money to pursue the
truth I always think of Hamlet&#39;s great
line to Horatio there are more things
between Heaven and Hell than it dreamed
of in your philosophy
Horatio I&#39;m going to introduce a man who
says there are more things between
Heaven and Hell than any of us have
accepted and I have the witnesses and
the documents to prove it ladies and
gentlemen Dr Steven
G thank you very much John uh members of
the press the American public and people
of the
world we are here today to disclose the
truth about a subject that has been
ridiculed and questioned denied for at
least 50 years the men and women who are
on this stage and the sum
350 additional Military Intelligence
Witnesses to the so-called UFO matter
and extraterrestrial intelligence can
prove and will prove that we are not
alone I would like to thank Sarah
McLendon who is with us today the famed
White House correspondent for her
sponsorship of this meeting thank you
very much
Sarah in 19 1993 a group of uh military
advisers to this project and I met out
in the countryside in Virginia and we
decided that it was time for
civilians military intelligence and
other people to come together to
disclose the truth about the subject
which is called
UFOs since that time I have personally
briefed a sitting director of Central
Intelligence James woy President
Clinton&#39;s first CI director
I have personally briefed the head of
the defense intelligence agency the head
of intelligence joint staff members of
the Senate intelligence committee many
members of Congress members of the
European leadership the Japanese cabinet
and others and what I have found is that
none of them are surprised that this is
true but they are uniformly horrified
that they have not had access to these
projects we can establish through these
Witnesses whom we have identified which
now number over
400 and these are people who have been
inside the CIA NSA nro Air Force Navy
Marines Army all divisions of the
intelligence and Military Community as
well as corporate Witnesses contractors
to the government and these are folks
who have been involved in so-called
black budget or covert unacknowledged
projects these unacknowledged special
access projects are taking in at least
40 to 80 billion per
year and they are sitting on
technologies that can change the world
forever the reason we are coming forward
now is that we are asking for the US
Congress and for President Bush to move
towards an official inquiry and
disclosure on this
subject it has the most profound
implications for the human future for
the US National Security and for World
Peace specifically Technologies
connected to UFO and extraterrestrial
Vehicles if Declassified and used for
peaceful
energy generation and propulsion would
solve the looming energy crisis
definitively would end global warming
would correct the environmental
challenges that the Earth is facing it
is also critical that we begin to debate
as a
society the
propriety of placing weapons in
space if indeed as we can prove it is
true that we are not alone and that
space is territory which we are sharing
with other
civilizations it could be a very
imprudent
destabilizing thing to place weapons in
space this is not being debated because
it is off the national International
radar screens it needs to be placed on
it and we are here today to do
it we can establish through this
testimony that these objects of
extraterrestrial origin have been
tracked on radar going thousands of
miles per hour stopping and making
rightand turns that they use
anti-gravity propulsion systems which we
have already figured out how they work
in classified projects in the United
States Great Britain and
elsewhere that these objects have landed
on terrafirma at times have been
disabled and have been
retrieved specifically by teams within
the United States that extraterrestrial
life forms have been retrieved and their
vehicles have been taken and studied
thoroughly for at least 50
years we can prove through the testimony
and documents that we will be
presenting that this subject has been
hidden from members of Congress and at
least two two
administrations that we are aware of
presidential administrations and that
the Constitution of the United
States has been subverted by The Growing
Power of these classified projects and
that this is a danger to the National
Security there is no evidence I wish to
emphasize that these life forms from
elsewhere are hostile towards us but
there is a great deal of evidence that
they are concerned with our hostility
there are times when they have
neutralized or rendered inert the launch
capabilities of intercontinental
ballistic missiles Witnesses here today
will describe those events to you they
have shown clearly that they do not want
us to weaponize space and yet we are
proceeding down that dangerous
path and it will be established that
these projects because they have not
been
supervised properly by the Congress by
the US president by the International
Community have become a threat to the
National
Security and for this reason we feel we
must disclose the
facts this is the beginning of the
campaign for disclosure and in a memo
that I wrote to President Bush last week
I stated that this campaign will persist
until our goals are met and they are as
follows that we have open honest
hearings on the subject in the US
Congress that there would be a permanent
ban on the weaponization of space or the
targeting of any objects of
extraterrestrial
origin that there be a full and complete
study of classified Technologies
connected to this
subject to see how they could be
properly
Declassified and applied for peaceful
energy generation
so that the world may get off of fossil
fuels in enough time to prevent greater
ecosystem damage or War over the looming
energy crisis which is sure to sweep the
Earth in the coming
decade this is a matter of the most
pressing import it has been ridiculed
yes I know many in the media would like
to talk about Little Green Men but in
reality the subject is left that because
it is so serious I have had grown men
men
weep who are in the Pentagon who are
members of Congress and who have said to
me what are we going to
do here&#39;s what we will
do we will see that this matter is
properly disclosed and these courageous
Witnesses the first 21 of over 100 that
we have already interviewed on video
tape have stepped forward to speak the
truth now I expect people to be
skeptical but not irrationally so
because these men and women have come
forward and they have their credentials
they can establish who they are and they
have been firsthand witnesses to some of
the most important events in the history
of the human
race as was pointed out to me by some of
the men here they were charged with
handling the nuclear weapons of the
United States their word was trusted on
everything of great importance for the
National Security we must trust their
word now as monor baluchi said at the
Vatican in an interview I had with him
recently it is irrational not to accept
the testimony of these Witnesses so
please be skeptical but that is not the
same as Prejudiced and closed-minded
this is a matter of great importance and
I ask the media the scientific community
and the political Community to look
seriously at this matter and to do the
right thing for Humanity and for our
children we have available for the media
and for members of Congress a nearly 500
page briefing document with transcripts
from dozens of these top secret
Witnesses we have a 4-Hour videotape
summary it&#39;s not a commercial product I
warn you from
this project of the 120 hours that we
have in interviews so far they&#39;ve been
boiled down to 4 hours and it&#39;s
available for the Congress to review and
for the major media to review we can
establish that this subject is real and
has tremendous significance for the
human future I ask on all of you who are
listening to contact the members of
Congress that represent you and the
leaders around the world and other
countries countries and ask them to hold
an honest inquiry into this subject to
support a ban on weaponizing Space since
we are sharing space with other life
forms and that we move quickly as a
people to understanding that this is the
end of the childhood of the human race
it is time for us to become mature
adults in the cosmic
civilizations out there to do this
we must become a peaceful civilization
and we must look as we go into space
with an intent of cooperating with other
civilizations not weaponizing that High
Frontier the men and women who will
speak next will do so in order beginning
on your left they will introduce
themselves I ask for the media to
refrain from questions until each
witness has spoken briefly about who
they are and what they have personally
been involved with or witnessed in their
government military or government
Connected
Careers at the end we will have
questions all of you may ask questions
for as long as we can stay here and we
will provide you with all the
information that you need so we will
begin now with the first of our
Witnesses Mr John Callahan
my name is John Callahan I&#39;m a retired
FAA employee I was the division manager
for the accidents evaluation and
investigation division in DC about two
years before I retired I received a call
from Alaska region with the um
region wanted to know what to tell the
media when I question tell the media
what he says about the UFO and it went
downhill from there what UFO it turned
out I told him what any government
employee would do at that time was to
tell them it&#39;s under investigation and
then I had him send all that data to the
FAA tech center in Atlantic City the
next day my uh immediate boss service
director harv Safir and I went to
Atlantic City I just purchased a uh a
new video camera and I videoed the uh
the event and L City we had him play
back on a uh on a scope you would call a
scope a plan view display PVD exactly
what the pilot uh seen or what the
controller seen and we uh tied that in
with the voice tape so we could hear
exactly what the controller said and
what he heard and we taped it we came
back the next
day uh briefed the administrator Admiral
LAN on what happened he wanted the
5-minute briefing after we started the
briefing he wanted to know if he could
see the video we put the video on he
watched the video the whole video the
next day he set up a uh a meeting for me
to give a dog and pony show to President
Reagan scientific staff and whoever they
brought over and to hand off all that
data to them that uh morning in the FAA
round room it was either 9 or
10:00 uh three men from uh Reagan&#39;s
scientific staff three CIA people three
FBI people and I don&#39;t remember who the
other guys were along with all the FAA
experts that I brought with me they
could decide or talk about the hardware
and the software how it worked we put on
a dog and pony show we let them watch
the video we had all the data there we
had all the printouts that the computer
uh uh put out they got all excited over
it when it was all done the uh CIA one
of the CIA men told the people they were
now sworn to secrecy
that this meeting never happened and
this event never happened when I asked
them why you I thought it was probably
just a stealth bomber at the time he
says well this is the first time that we
have uh recorded radar data on a UFO and
these guys are going to get all excited
drooling over all this data I said well
you&#39;re going to tell the public about it
and he says no we don&#39;t tell the public
about this it would uh Panic the public
he says we&#39;re going to go back and study
this
I said Okay that was what he was going
to do now I&#39;ve told this story many
times and I&#39;ve get sometimes funny looks
from people I have with me the uh voice
tapes of the controllers that were
involved the FAA original tapes see
after we handed this stuff off to the
president&#39;s staff the FAA didn&#39;t know
what to do with it we don&#39;t separate
UFOs from real traffic so it&#39;s not our
problem
okay I have a copy of the original of
the uh video that we took which is
rather
interesting and once once the thing was
all over the report started coming into
my office but because it wasn&#39;t an FAA
air traffic problem the faa&#39;s report
ended up on a table in my office and it
stayed there until I retired when one of
the staffers packed up all my gear and
helped it move to my house also in a box
I found just a few good days ago in my
1992 tax return I have the target
printouts from the uh computer data
which so if you wanted to re or look at
every Target that was up there at the
time you can now reproduce this from
this piece of paper here and it&#39;s called
the UFO incident uh Japan 1648 I believe
the number was it happened on November
the 18th
1986 uh I&#39;m prepared to go to Congress
to swear before Congress that everything
I&#39;ve told you people and everything that
is here is the truth thank
you good morning I hope you&#39;ll pardon me
I&#39;m a little bit nervous my name is
Charles L Brown I&#39;m a lieutenant colonel
US Air Force
retired subsequently seven years with
the Foreign Service
I like the name Charlie Brown a
gentleman by name of Charles Schultz of
great talent sort of uh elevated the
name if you
will uh during World War II I was a
young Farm Boy from West Virginia I got
the Patriotic bug joined the United
States Army ended up flying bombers in
Europe and ended the war of Transport in
the
Pacific finished College in the summer
late summer sum of 49 recalled to active
duty in a newly formed United States Air
Force I was assigned to an organization
called office of special
investigations the Air Force as most of
you know was formed in
1947 OSI as a central investigative
Agency for the Air Force was formed I
think in
1948 so everything was relatively new
needless to say starting in 47 UFOs were
rather new the Air Force intelligence a
technical Intelligence Center was at rri
Patterson Air Force bace and I had my
office in a building adjacent to it and
our organization was the worldwide
investigative Agency for the Air Force
for any unidentified flying objects this
lasted for about two years the project
name was known as project Grudge it was
a predecessor to a project known as Blue
Book which edre Pelt headed during my
experience with it I would collect the
data from I didn&#39;t collect it it was
sent into my office I analyzed it as a
pilot investigator I was able to offer
some bits of advice to the air technical
intelligence people now you might
visualize a massive office but as I
recall we had a first lieutenant uh a
secretary and a technical sergeant that
was the essence of Project Blue Book
when it started a project Grudge Blue
Book and expanded
somewhat during the review as an analyst
of these various documentary reports if
you will or
documents I became clearly
convinced that there was substance to
what was being reported in that we had
ground visual ground radar Airborne
Visual and Airborne radar confirmation
of some of these sightings the
individuals who made the sightings were
everything from airline pilots military
Pilots police officers some of the
people that your lives depend upon on a
daily basis these are very reputable and
creditable people I hope that the
testimony here from very credible people
will convince you of that and will
further Steve Greer&#39;s
disclosure project in that pressure
needs to be brought to bring this to the
attention not only of the Americans but
of people all over the planet these
vehicles have been seen and confirmed
all over the planet I am willing to sign
a sworn statement or testify to my
judgment and to what I have
observed such things do exist please
believe me please believe the those to
follow me thank
you my name is Michael Smith I was in
the Air Force sergeant from 1967 to
19 uh
73 I was aircraft control and warning
operator while I was assigned to clouth
Falls Oregon in early 1970 arrived at
the radar site and they were watching a
UFO on a radar that was hovering at
about 80,000
ft it sat there for about 10 minutes and
then slowly
descended uh until it dropped off the
radar was gone for about 5 10 minutes
and then instantly reappeared at 880,000
FT stationary the next sweep of the
radar it was 200 miles
away stationary and hovered there for
about 10 minutes and redid the whole
cycle twice
more when I found out what the normal
what you Norm normally do when you see a
UFO I was told that you notify NORAD you
don&#39;t necessarily write anything down
you don&#39;t write anything down and you
keep it to yourself it&#39;s a need to know
basis
only and Norad one night called me about
later in the year to let me know as a
heads up that there was a UFO coming up
the California coastline I asked him
what I should do about this they said
nothing don&#39;t write it down just it&#39;s
just a heads
up and then
late
1972 while stationed at
753r radar Squadron in s St Marine
Michigan I received uh couple panicky
calls from police officers who were
chasing three
UFOs from maol bridge up
I75 so I immediately checked the radar
confirmed that they were there called no
ad and they were concerned cuz they had
two inbound b52s going to kinow Air
Force Base so they diverted them because
they didn&#39;t want any proximity of the
two and that night I answered many calls
from uh the police department Sheriff&#39;s
Department stuff and my standard
response was that there was nothing on
radar and I will testify to this under
oath to a congressional
hearing
good morning my name is Enrique KC I am
a traffic controller I&#39;m sorry uh for my
English I&#39;m so scar I&#39;m not accustomed
to talk in front of a lot of
people um I&#39;m here because I&#39;m been
witnessed in an involuntary way uh on my
work uh I work in Mexico City as radar
controller and the International Airport
of
Mexico and uh I&#39;m going to give an
example about this sinus that we have in
Mexico for several uh years and this
issue happens a lot of times on my
country
unfortunately for example in March 4
1992 we detect 15 objects uh west side
of the TOA airport that is very close of
our International Airport at 50 miles
more
list then uh uh July 28th of
1994 we have an um almost a collision or
something that we can name in that
way uh with a international flight I
mean uh domestic flight of iron Mexico
129 commands by the uh pilot rundo
cantes Rano that has a trash or
something about in his main l in year in
the right
L uh that&#39;s Ur night at 1030 more or
less then in the next
week uh the same year in the same moment
uh the AO Mexico fly
904 has another almost Collision that
was reported for the pilot Coro the
capan
Coro at 11:30 in the morning and we
detect that object on a radar uh um
suddenly just for a
moment then H in the next week we have a
lot of siding reported by the pilots
that give us information about the weird
uh traffic or something uh brighting
lights and uh different times and we did
take some of
them uh in in in that uh week
but in September 15 of
1994 we have an A detection about uh 5
hours more or less on a radar and a new
equipment that we believe that uh that
equipment was uh working in in not a
good way cuz uh uh it&#39;s not human that
you have um detection by 5 hours of the
same object and apparently without
movement well we concur with the
technical of persons of radar in our
country that the radar system was
working well and uh
and and was very exciting and we
surprised when uh at the next day we
received information about parodist
named Hae Maan that is studi this cases
in Mexico about that sighing a from a
lot of people in the med P
City uh very is and another Point
located southeast of the TOA airport
about an a sighting of the big um flying
sorer apply 50 m of diameter than for a
lot of people and uh that L the trashes
some in in the in in the ground well
next in November 90 24 9
94 uh we have an uh on service
officially our new radar
system and after that moment we have uh
information very um exactly about of
these stings at the same time with the
pilots and
detections uh that&#39;s why I&#39;m here
because we consider on my country that
this is very dangerous we have a lot of
more cases but I don&#39;t want to use more
time in this but uh uh it&#39;s very
important that the people uh on the
world knows these events and uh consider
that could be very dangerous for
aeronautical situation especially in my
country I don&#39;t know why in my country
that&#39;s Ure
frequently but the the point is that
happens and uh and we consider
dangersous and we had only I fortunately
one TR but we don&#39;t want to have an an
more thank you very much and I&#39;m
Sor my name is Graham bethon I&#39;m a
retired Navy Commander pilot had a top
secret clearance 50 years ago February
the 10th
1951 I was flying from kvic Iceland to
argentin nland it was at night it was
dark about 300 miles outside of Argenta
I saw a glow on the
water like approaching the city at night
as we approached this glow it turned to
a monstrous circle of white lights on
the water we watched this for a while
the lights went out there was nothing on
the water next thing we saw was a yellow
Halo small much smaller than whatever it
was launched from and that was 15 mil
away up to our altitude because of the
trajectory I disengaged the autopod
shoved the nose over to try to go on
this thing at that time I heard a noise
underneath I thought maybe it hit us it
was actually some of the crew members
ducking and they collided and a couple
of them were injured then it appeared
over to the right and moved out slowly
and flew with us it was still not at our
altitude but we could see the shape of
it it had a dome we could see the we
could see the coronal
discharge I went back in let the other
pil Al Jones take my seat to see what
the passenger&#39;s reaction was came back
to the [ __ ] pillet told him not to
report anything simply because what that
the pist had said to me maybe they would
lock us up so basically the instruments
in the cockpit we had four or five faes
in the area of magnetic compass you know
the electromagnetic an area of direction
finders and this type of thing the craft
was tracked by radar in excess of 1,800
mph it never did get to our a to we had
31 passengers plus the psychiatrist and
the crew members that all cited this at
different areas when we landed at
Argenta new we were interrogated by the
Air Force an excellent interogation
Captain Paulson when we landed at the
Naval Air test center here at P Tuit
River we were required by Navy
intelligence to make out individual
reports out of the National Archives I
have the the 18 page official Navy and
Air Force
report I&#39;ve made up a a report to
straighten out all the truth there&#39;s a
stack of books out there this hi have
written all of this up so the truth is
here I will testify under oath before
Congress that everything that I have
said is
true
my name is Dan Willis I was in the
United States Navy I held a top secret
crypto level 14 extra sensitive material
handling security clearance I worked in
the code room at the naval communication
station in San
Francisco in 1969 I received a priority
message from a ship near
Alaska that was classified as secret the
ship reported uh merging out of the
ocean um near Port b a brightly glowing
uh reddish orange elliptical object
approximately 70 ft in diameter emerged
out of the water shot into space uh
traveling at about 7,000
mph this was uh tracked on ship&#39;s radar
and substantiate
it uh years later I worked at the um
Naval electronic engineering center in
San Diego for 13 years the um coworker
who I worked with worked at the NORAD
facility when he first started working
at the facility he noticed objects going
on the screens that track everything out
in space and in the air objects going
off the scale doing right angle turns
when he
inquired um his older supervisor advised
him that uh quote it was just a visit
from one of our little friends I thought
this a little
unusual uh these statements are true I&#39;m
willing to testify on our oath before
Congress thank
you my name is Don
Phillips I was in the United States Air
Force and had worked with certain
intelligence agencies of the United
States government prior to my air
force uh prior to joining the Air Force
I worked
for the famous locked
skunkworks and I was working for them
when I was attending college and I
worked them worked for them in the
capacity as a design engineer it was one
of my proudest moments of my life to
work with a man by the name of Kelly
Johnson a lot of you might be familiar
with that that uh it turns out that the
models of aircraft that we were building
as you know uh were all classified were
in the Deep
black and that I came in on on the end
of the U2 project my main project was
known later as the
SR71 the SR71 had a predecessor it had a
special model built for the
CIA and that those models were one one
passenger One Pilot special aircraft in
order
to get from one place to another very
very quickly now these sr71s as we know
them the Blackbird are the type of
aircraft that are still classified in a
sense as far as the altitude that it
flies at and also the speed records that
it holds I&#39;m very proud to say that this
aircraft played a big part in helping to
end the Cold
War the aircraft the predecessor
aircraft there&#39;s strong evidence to
suggest that perhaps these aircraft had
a different role once in the air each
pilot and I knew a few of them each
pilot had an assignment before they took
off okay they learned about the
assignment immediately prior takeoff and
there&#39;s strong evidence to suggest that
there was a dual role in that they were
monitoring some type of
traffic to and from planet
Earth this can be verified at a later
point this was Pro I&#39;ll jump into my
military
experience my first field assignment for
the United States Air Force was at Las
Vegas Air Force Station and that was my
first experience with Las Vegas and I
couldn&#39;t understand why people were
being so um excited about going to a
place Place such as this but I soon
found out about a year later uh Nellis
Air Force Base is located there Nellis
is a major training center for different
types of special aircraft and fighter
aircraft one of the Premier training
sites for Pilots all around the
world however when I learned that my
assignment was at a Radar Site 50 Mi out
of town up near Mount
Charleston uh I had no idea where we
where I&#39;d be so finally in the daylight
I was able to find the location and
reported in U in 1965 for
Duty in
1966 early in the morning about 1: to 2:
a.m. I was sleeping I was staying there
on base and our Barracks were at about
8,000 ft our heard a lot of commotion
you know at that altitude sound carries
sound carries tremendously and and I
thought well it&#39;s early in the morning
it&#39;s
summertime and there is a lot it&#39;s very
warm and maybe I should get up and take
a look I didn&#39;t really want to but I got
up and took a look walked up to the main
road up near my office which was the
Commander&#39;s office I was on the
commander staff Lieutenant Colonel
Charles
Evans and I couldn&#39;t I I was say who&#39;s
making all this noise who&#39;s making all
this noise at this time of the morning
so when I got within about 50 yards of
the five four or five people that were
standing there one being the chief of
security they were looking up in the air
and I say gee they all their heads are
all head looking at the same direction
well I looked up to the West
Northwest and to my amazement there were
lights flashing around the sky moving at
anywhere from what seemed like 24 thou
24 00 to about 3,800
mph now the fact that we&#39;re taking an
estimate from a distance uh you know we
figured well this is this is quite
something however we continue to watch
these fly these darting
lights go across the sky and stop
absolutely stop come to a dead stop and
reverse in an acute angle their
Direction and then proceed on into sort
of they were traveling so fast that you
could almost see a pattern left by if
you are computer people when you move a
mouse real quick across the screen you
see a little bit of a tail well that&#39;s
exactly the way these six or seven craft
worked after 5 minutes of watching these
things they all seem to group up to the
West
Northwest okay they started to come in
on a circle but what I would like to
point out is that where they were
putting on their display in the North
northw West
Sky just directly east of that is what
is known as Area
51 Area 51 is a aec name okay atomic
energy commission that was the old name
for atomic energy commission we knew it
as the Groom Lake flight test
facility in the Air Force and it was
where we tested our
aircraft at the after we got the
Prototype made from the skunk works so
here are the let&#39;s get back to the
circle in the sky what they did was
coales and and started rotating in a
circle and then they disappeared well I
thought gee this is something that we
have to keep quiet and that was verified
by the chief of
security but we waited there and talked
it over for a little bit it seemed like
I think it was an hour then came the
radar people from the Scopes which were
at 10,000 plus feet came down for their
dinner at 2 o&#39;clock in the morning and
the first person off the bus was a good
friend of mine Anthony quar
he said he was white as a sheet and he
says did you see that yeah we all said
yeah yeah it was a nice display what a
show he says we documented them on radar
and he says we didn&#39;t give them
clearance we just the standing order was
let them fly through the radar beam he
says we documented six to S UFOs now we
don&#39;t know who was guiding those but
they were certainly intelligent and uh
we don&#39;t know where they landed because
they coalesced and disappeared
so I will say at this point to keep it
short that I will testify under oath as
to what I say is true and I will do so
before Congress thank
you my name is Robert Solace uh contrary
to what it says on the card I was not a
lieutenant colonel in the Air Force I
was was in the Air Force active duty
after I graduated from the Air Force
Academy 1964 until
1971 and separated as a captain in uh uh
March of
1967 I was stationed at Malmstrom Air
Force Base
Montana um as a missile launch officer
Minute Man
missiles uh on an on early morning of uh
March 16th
1967 I got a call from my security guard
primary security guard
upstairs uh we had about uh six as I
recall uh flight security uh Airmen
upstairs I was downstairs 60 ft
underground in a capsule uh monitoring
and uh controlling 10 uh nuclear tipped
Minute Man
missiles uh I got a call that
morning uh that they were seeing strange
lights flying in the sky time uh I I
disregarded that call uh told him to uh
call me when something more significant
happened um I got another call uh
subsequent to that call and this time it
was a more uh intense tone and the in
the guard&#39;s uh voice is very clearly
very
frightened um he said there was a uh a
bright glowing red object hovering
outside the front gate it was oval
shaped um he had all the other guards
out there with their weapons drawn right
after that call I woke up my commander
who was on a rest period uh uh Fred
mewald a retired Colonel now uh and told
him about the phone calls as I was
telling him about the phone calls my
weapons started going down uh one after
the other they went into a no-go
condition what we call no-go condition
they were
unlaunchable um
we lost somewhere between uh six and
eight weapons that morning uh within
minutes of having received that second
phone call of a UFO hovering outside the
front gate
um uh again that morning we after
reporting it to the uh command post uh
we were informed that a similar very
similar incident happened at Echo flight
uh I was at Oscar flight uh they lost
all 10 of their weapons and under
similar circumstances very similar
circumstances where UFOs were sighted
over the launch
facilities uh they had they had
maintenance Crews and security crews out
there that had spent the night and they
were reporting UFOs over those
sites
um and the commander of of that flight
was Eric Carlson uh he&#39;s he also
separated as a captain and the deputy
Commander was uh Walt
figel uh [ __ ] as the lieutenant
colonel
um we have those Witnesses uh that I
just mentioned the names I just
mentioned are uh have have spoken of
this event before and they will back up
this story um we also have
documentation uh that I received uh
through foa requests from the Air Force
uh outlining the the echo flight
incident and including in in that
documentation a reference to UFOs we
have um tx&#39;s uh covering this
incident uh and in one TX it it says uh
the fact that no apparent reason for the
loss of 10 missiles can be readily
identified is caused for grave concern
to this
headquarters uh this was from sack
headquarters so we received we&#39;ve got
those texes I&#39;ve got about 12 Witnesses
that&#39;ll verify parts of this
story including
um uh of a man who investigated the
incident afterwards for the Air Force
and you&#39;ll hear a little bit more about
that with from the next
witness um and
also
uh another guard that uh witnessed the
UFO in that same time period and another
officer who retired a full Colonel who
had other reports of
UFOs and similary to that excuse me I&#39;ve
got the complete report on a Minot North
Dakota incident that was Min not Air
Force based North Dakota which happened
in August of 1966 very similar UFOs
sided over uh uh missile silos and also
a UFO incident that was that was
investigated by the Air Force
immediately after our incident within a
week I&#39;m willing to testify to the truth
of all these matters that I&#39;ve spoken
about this in front of Congress under
oath thank
you good morning my name is dwne arnson
I served 26 years as a communication
Electronics officer in the US Air Force
all over the world including
Vietnam I uh was lucky to be selected to
be commander of three different units in
the Air Force I held a top secret SCI TK
clearance and for those that know it is
slightly Above Top Secret I retired in
1986 as a colonel at R Patterson Air
Force Base in Ohio I would like to
relate about three different experiences
if you will that relate to UFOs
as a young Lieutenant over in Germany
Rams sign Airbase Germany back in the
early 60s I was in charge of the
cryptographic center I had a top secet
crypto clearance at that time and I can
clearly recall seeing a message that
went through my crypto Center which said
that a UF UFO had crashed on the island
of spitsberg in Norway and the team of
scientists were coming to investigate it
going forward to the 1967 time frame I
was assigned to the 28th thir division
at Great Falls Montana and I was the
officer in charge at the Communication
Center there also I was a top secret
control officer for the division I uh
had a crypto account I was a account
custodian and I also passed out nuclear
launch
authenticators during that time I can
recall seeing a message come through
that Communication Center which said
basic what Bob was just got through
talking about is that a UFO was seen
near the missile sadles
and the missiles were
deactivated
coincidentally my first the person that
Boeing sent to investigate the
particular missile conditions if you
will what made them shut down was my
first manager at Boeing Mr Bob Kaminsky
who has since passed away and I can
recall him on different occasions he
lived close to me in Auburn Washington
that&#39;s where I&#39;m from and he said Arie
he says those missiles were perfectly
clean that was the result so the one
last incident concerned when I was in
the as a commander of the unit in Great
Falls or in casell Air Force Station
Maine I had contacts with the security
police at Lauren Air Force Space and
they told about UFOs that were seen near
the nuclear weapon storage areas on
Lauren Air Force Base and I&#39;d be glad to
testify to Congress that this is
absolutely the truth thank
you
good morning my name is Harland Bentley
during 1957 and
1959 I was a PFC in the United States
Army stationed north of Washington DC on
the Nike Ajax missile base close to
Allie
Maryland in May this month of 196 or
1958 about 6:00 a.m. I heard a noise
outside to sound like a pulsating
Transformer I sat up in my bunk I looked
out the window I saw a craft heading for
the ground and
crashed pieces broke off of that craft
immediately took off
again so there&#39;s a lot more to that
story but I&#39;ve got to speed this
up now the next night I was on radar
Duty I get a call from the gburg missile
base he says hey I got 12 to 15 UFOs
outside 50 to 100 ft above me so I asked
him I said what does it sound like he
took his head mic off H it out the van
window and said here and the sound of
the same sound I heard the previous
morning except a lot more of
them so I my radar was on standby so I
immediately turned it
on and got the blip just outside the
ground
clutter I marked it on my radar
screen and then for a few minutes later
all of a sudden they took
off as they took off the The Sweep came
around hit the blip the second when it
came around it hit it again that blip
was 2/3 away off my radar scope in order
to get that far at a constant velocity
was 177,000
mph that was my first incident 10 years
later by this time I received a be a
bachelor&#39;s science degree in electrical
engineering and I was working in
California now I&#39;m sorry that all I can
say is I was somewhere in California
working on a classified project that had
nothing to do with my experience that I
had
there as I was working and it was like 2
3 in the morning California
time I heard a Houston astronaut
communication link Comm link
I didn&#39;t pay much attention to it
until I heard the word bogey of course
my ears P picked up immediately an
unidentified flying object of some sort
whether it&#39;s a craft meteorite or
whatever was on a collision course with
that module going to the loop around the
moon so basically I listened for some
time and then I stopped and went back to
work and then I heard there they go
in the astronaut World some of you may
may not know
this there&#39;s a term called Green
Turtle and it used to be I don&#39;t know if
it is today or not but used to be is
you&#39;re not allowed to use profanity over
than that and the first person that does
that whoever hears it first and says
green turtle that astronaut&#39;s got to buy
that man and his entire family had
dinner at the most expensive place at
Cape
canaval
well to end this real
quick one of them said damn they went
off the the UFOs took off he says damn
that was fast and somebody yelled green
turtle and then he said another word a
cinnamon to
crap and then somebody else yelled green
turtle and you could see him G his teeth
is now you had to buy two expensive
meals and and my particular experience I
will testify before Congress if
necessary and explain exactly what
happened thank
you my name is John Maynard I&#39;m retired
army I retired as a Sergeant First
Class for my entire year 21 years of
service I held a top secret
clearance compartmentalized at times
to as high as TK
Omni crypto and
others I had access to very very
sensitive
documents my testimony is basically two
PR one I retired from DIA in
1980 and when as an administrator you
take over an office you take over
everything and you sign for
everything and I signed for well over 2
documents in order to sign an inventory
of those things you have to read them
not word for
word but basically I went through every
document to make sure that it was
complete it was there as they told
me I turned my charge over to the next
person the same documents were
there so I got quite a good knowledge of
what was going on in those documents and
believe me there are many many from
references to
UFOs there was also npic
pictures that shows that it with
targeted objects every case you know now
I worked on the salt one and salt two
areas for the office that I worked in so
we were taking pictures all the time for
verification of nuclear
disarmament and there was some objects
in those pictures that didn&#39;t belong
there the second thong prong to this
whole thing is that a lot of people talk
about conspiracies over a shadow
government I&#39;m willing to testify before
Congress that these Black Operations do
exist I nearly became part of
it but I saw the light I think or was
it and I got
out and that&#39;s it we have to
disclose what we know
and I am willing to testify before
Congress under oath or before any other
organization that what I witnessed was
true good morning my name is Carl wolf
and I was a Precision Electronics
photographic repairman with a top secret
crypto
clearance in the United States Air Force
I was station at Langley Air Force Base
in Virginia in
1965 um in mid
1965 I was loan to the lunar orbiter
project at Nasa on Langley
field uh Dr kie was in charge of that
project they had problems with a piece
of U electronic equipment that was
bottlenecking their production of
photographs I went to the facility and
when I walked into the facility there
were scientists from all over the world
I was stunned actually to see people at
a NASA project uh from all over the
world that didn&#39;t make any sense to me
initially um I was taken into the
laboratory where the equipment was
malfunctioning I couldn&#39;t repair it in
the dark I asked to have it removed a um
Airman second class was in the dark room
at that time I was also an Airman second
class um I was interested how the whole
process functioned
how the data got from the lunar orbiter
to the laboratory asked the young man if
he described the process to me he did
about 30 minutes into the process he
said to me um in a very distressed way
um by the way we&#39;ve discovered a base on
the back side of the moon and then he
proceeded to put photographs down in
front of me and clearly in these
photographs were structures uh mushroom
shaped buildings spherical buildings and
towers and at that point I was very
concerned because I knew we were working
in compartmentalized security he had
breached security and I was actually
frightened at that moment and I did not
question him any further and a few
moments later someone did come into the
room um I worked there for three more
days and I remember going home and
naively thinking I can&#39;t wait to hear
about this on the evening
news and here it is more than 30 years
later and I hope we hear about it
tonight and I will testify under oath
before Congress
that what I&#39;m saying is the
truth thank you Carl uh good morning
everyone my name is Donna hair and I
worked at filco Ford Aerospace for from
1967 to 1981 during that time I was a
design illustrator
draftsman uh I did the launch slides and
Landing slides and also so projecting
plotting boards lunar maps for NASA we
were a contractor but at most of the
time I worked on site excuse me in
building
8 I had the opportunity to do extra work
during downtime which was between
missions and I walked into a photo lab
which was the NASA lab across the
hallway I had a secret clearance which
is not that high but I was able to go
into restricted areas which this was
uh at the time I was talking to one of
the texts in there and he drew my
attention to a photograph that a NASA
photograph it had a DOT on it and I said
what is that well he drew my attention
to it and and I said is that a a DOT on
the Emulsion and he said and he&#39;s
smiling and he has his hands crossed and
he said uh round dots on the Emulsion
don&#39;t leave round Shadows on the ground
and this was an aerial photograph of the
earth I&#39;m assuming the Earth because it
had pine trees on it and the Shadows of
the craft or whatever it was were in the
same angle as the trees and by its very
nature UFO and I wanted to clarify that
to a gentleman that was talking to me
means unidentified so I did not know
what this was but I realized at this
point that it&#39;s very secret that it was
Kept Secret because I asked him what are
you going to do with this piece of
information and he said we always
airbrush these out before we sell them
to the public so they&#39;re P pesky little
creatures uh appearing on this uh
photograph they wanted to get rid of uh
after that I decided I would ask
questions to other people that work
there and I found that I had to ask them
away from the site and not on site a
guard told me that he was asked to burn
some
photographs and not to look at them and
there was a guard another guard guarding
him who was in green
fatigues watching him burn the
photographs and he said he was too
tempted looked at one and it was a
picture of a
UFO and he was very descriptive I can go
into that later with anyone uh he
immediately was hit in the head and he
had a big gash in his forehead he was
knocked out and he&#39;s terrified so he
would have to be protected uh another
incident I knew someone in quarantine
with the Apollo Astronauts he told me
that the Apollo astronaut saw Craft on
the moon when we landed and that is what
he told me and he also was afraid he
said that the astronauts are told to
keep this quiet they&#39;re not allowed to
talk about it so I do want to let you
know that I worked out there for a
number of years and this I ran into this
so it&#39;s not something everyone knows
that works out there for a long time my
boss didn&#39;t know about it uh some people
that sat right next to me didn&#39;t know
about it it&#39;s it&#39;s very strange because
I don&#39;t know how they can do it but they
can let some people know about it and
then others not I&#39;m willing to testify
before Congress that what I&#39;m saying is
true and I thank you very much
thank good morning ladies and gentlemen
and members of the press I my name is
Larry Warren uh 20 years ago in 1980 I
was a security specialist assigned to
RAF bentwaters Woodbridge
NATO uh Air Force facilities in suffk
East Anglia I had a secret uh security
clearance I guarded uh our backline
nuclear weapons that were stored there
at the time un without the knowledge of
the people of Great
Britain uh I went through a a portion of
a three night UFO event where objects
made incursions over our wsa fired
Pencil Thin beams of light into them and
adversely affected the ordinance
possibly these objects were on the
ground on two different nights potenti
there was another life for scene this is
an unpopular truth these events were of
extreme defense significance to not only
Her Majesty&#39;s government but this
government as well and they are still
shrouded in
secrecy uh they are very complex they
are very vast this is more about a human
rights issue than just a UFO issue uh 20
years ago this room would be empty I see
a turn in history this is history in
motion but unfortunately it&#39;s history
with the security classification
I would be more than honored to swear
under oath that I experienced what I did
I saw what I saw these events produced
not only uh after numerous denials by
this government a memo by Lieutenant
Colonel Charles halt our Deputy based
Commander which reads like science
fiction it also produced years later an
on-site audio tape he made as these
objects uh performed their Feats and did
what they did and violated airspace
these events are of extreme defense
significance I hope my brothers in arms
that went through these events will be
given immunity at some point and be able
to join us here it is an honor to share
the stage with all of these PE people
and uh I think for all our children my
son Dennis God bless you son um we can
change the world Your Heroes for being
here also and I will testify in front of
Congress if has to God bless thank
you
all my name is George filer II the
reason I&#39;m here is because George fer I
is in the hanger and will be born on
Friday and and I&#39;m a retired
intelligence officer and flyer with
almost 5,000 hours and uh I didn&#39;t
believe in UFOs until London control
called us in the winter of 1962 and
asked us would we Chase one and we said
sure So we let down from
30,000 ft to 1,000 ft where the UFO was
hovering and we went into a steep dive
and actually exceeded the um red line of
the aircraft so it&#39;s kind of dangerous
changing UFOs any case uh I was able to
get the UFO on the aircraft radar at
about 40 miles and we could see a light
out in the distance and as we closed we
kept on picking up this radar return
point on I&#39;m mentioning that the radar
return was
very uh distinct and solid indicating it
was some kind of a metallic object we
got about a mile from the UFO and it
kind of lit up in the sky and went off
into space very similar to what the
shuttle looks like when it takes
off um later on I was working in
intelligence in Vietnam I briefed to
General Brown about UFOs when I went was
in um 21st Air Force Maguire Air Force
Base brief General glow about a
UFO over Teran Iran in
1976 that two f4s from the Iranian Air
Force had taken off and try to intercept
the
UFO and when they turned on their Fire
Control Systems they immediately went
off all the electrical systems went out
the planes had to return to base this
was particularly significant because it
was also picked up on
satellites in
1978 on January 18th I was going into
the base every morning I did the uh
briefing to the general
staff and I noticed that uh there are
some lights off in the distance at the
end of the end Runway there and when I
got into the command post the um senior
master sergeant in charge said that
there had been UFOs in the pattern all
night they&#39;re on
radar the tower had seen them they
gotten aircraft reports and so on and
that one had landed or
crashed at um Fort Dicks Fort Dicks and
Maguire are right
together this is kind of like the
Roswell of the East but in any case uh
an alien had come off the craft and had
been shot by a military policeman and
apparently was wounded was heading for
Maguire so for whatever reason the uh
aliens liked the Air Force better than
the Army perhaps because they&#39;re
shooting at them but any case uh our
security police went out there and um
found him on the end of the runway
dead and uh they asked me to brief the
general staff of General Tom Sadler and
um at the 8:00 standup briefing and I
said I don&#39;t think I want to do this you
know the general doesn&#39;t have a good
sense of humor and
I&#39;m not sure I I believe this so I did
some checking called the 438 command
post and everybody had pretty much the
same story and uh at 8:00 that morning
just before I went on was going to brief
this I was very worried about it they
said don&#39;t brief it that it&#39;s too hot so
to
speak that&#39;s pretty much my
story and I&#39;m prepared to tell the story
in front of
Congress and uh it is a truth now
because of this
I&#39;ve stayed interested in
UFOs and I&#39;m the Eastern director of the
mutual UFO Network and
between the national Reporting Center
and Peter Davenport and the muon we get
100 reports a week on average of people
from all over the United States that see
these things regularly and if you start
checking they&#39;re out there and they&#39;re
low and people are seeing them all the
time and these are highly qualified
people all of whom essentially give us
the reports by
email thank
you morning ladies and gentlemen my name
is Clifford Stone I was a Sergeant First
Class United States
Army I had a secret clearance with
nuclear
assurity I could get the clearance that
I needed to do whatever it was at the
was necessary for me to do at the time
on Special Operations when I was called
in on those what I&#39;m referring to here
is that I was involved in situations
where we actually did recoveries of
trash of crashed saucers for lack of a
better term and debris thereof there
were bodies that were involved with some
of these crashes also some were alive
while we were doing all this we were
telling the American public there was
nothing to it we were telling the world
there was nothing to it I&#39;d like to go
into detail on some of the cases about
the nuts and both bats cases right here
but I will be available if you have any
questions concerning my involvement in
this you can talk to Dr Greer to arrange
for me to get to talk to you but the
whole situation is we&#39;ve set back we&#39;ve
told the American people that there&#39;s no
such thing as
UFOs I&#39;ve been involved where we have
recovered these objects we know them to
be of
extraterrestrials in
1969 I had an event that happened to me
me while I was stationed at fortly
Virginia we went to Indiantown Gap
Pennsylvania that would be my first
exposure to any time that we would be
recovering an unidentified flying object
when we went there we already had people
that was already in in the facility we
were a backup team which was supposed to
be NBC because there were supposed to be
some nuclear materials that was on board
this craft later on most people involved
would have been were were to be told
that there was nothing on board it it
was nothing more than just crash of one
of our aircraft I know better because I
was one of the people that approached it
with a Geer counter to get surface
readings I was the first person to go
ahead and see that there were bodies on
it that would be the first of
approximately 12 events UFO crashes are
not events that take place every day
they&#39;re
rare I know we&#39;re not alone in the
universe I know that the absence of
evidence is not evidence of absence it&#39;s
evidence that is been denied to the
American
people I stand before you today and my
almighty God and I tell you this if
Congress calls me in and says will you
testify in detail what you know I stand
here today prepared and ready to do just
that governments must never lie to the
people for no reason thank
you
good morning my name is Mark mandish and
for the last 21 years I have worked as a
conceptual artist for a variety of
Defense
contractors I&#39;ve been involved uh in
conceptual artwor of the production
thereof for Rockwell on the x30
program and also on the uh the high step
program that&#39;s spelled Hy STP means
Hypersonic test bed
program uh during the course of my
career I&#39;ve twice had a secret C
security clearance in 1967 while my
father was stationed in West over Air
Force Base the headquarters R Air Force
Strategic Air
Command I witnessed and watched through
a telescope a UFO which hovered over a
nuclear weapon storage facility for
approximately 10 minutes and then
departed uh with an acceleration
approaching a bullet leaving a rifle
barrel
um oh I&#39;m sorry uh in uh in 1988 in
November a college buddy of mine an
associate by the name of Brad senson
informed me that he had personally
witnessed three flying saucers at a very
large hanger at Norton Air Force Base
during the course of an air show that
was held on Saturday November 12th
1988 uh I subsequently uh called my
congressman from that District um I
called his office this was Congressman
George E Brown Jr who at the time was
the chairman of the uh Congressional
committee on space science and advanced
technology I naturally assume that since
this presentation that Brad talked about
was for top military brass and certain
Congressional uh individuals that uh his
office must have coordinated this uh
with the local Air Force office of
public
affairs uh a male staff member in
Congressman Brown&#39;s office not only
confirmed the exhibit but the fact that
there were three discs at that exhibit
these discs were hovering off the floor
without any visible means of support
they were referred to as alien
reproduction Vehicles also nicknamed the
flux liner because they used high
voltage
electricity um let&#39;s
see to keep things short this this is a
diagram that I made based
on a uh a sketch that Brad senson did
for me in rough form uh s uh shortly
after he uh had his uh sighting and uh
subsequently cleaned that drawing up and
made it much more accurate and that&#39;s
the uh the drawing that Dr Greer is
holding there
now uh later on I obtained uh
photographs that were uh taken in
1967 by a military pilot Harvey Williams
flying a c47 for the Air Force at 12,000
ft approximately 25 M Southwest of Provo
Utah uh this particular vehicle matches
the so-called arv uh in all proportions
and respects in terms of the detail of
the shape of the craft and this was
photographed as I say in Jun June or
July of uh um June of
1967 I uh
um uh later um spoke to a gentleman by
the name of Kent selin that I met at an
air show at Edwards Air Force Base and
in 1992 the first unveiling publicly of
the B2 bomber uh he indicated to me that
in 1973 when he was a crew chief uh
working on um experimental aircraft at
Edwards Air Force Base that he had um
unintentionally wandered into an area
where there was a classified aircraft
namely the
arv uh he described it in detail and he
added uh other details to the account
concerning the configuration and the
oper vehicle that Brad Sorenson was not
aware of uh subsequently Brad senson met
with the famous aeronautical designer
Bert Rattan gave him a copy of this
blueprint which you&#39;ve just been shown
Mr Rattan felt that it was a joke and
put it on his wall as kind of a joke and
um a third party confirmed for me later
um that a colonel Ray Walsh from Edwards
Air Force Base was visiting Mr Rattan
saw this uh this blueprint on the wall
and registered quite a degree of shock
and anger wanted to know where the hell
he got this blueprint because there was
in fact such a craft at that time
approximately 194 94 95 uh in a hanger
at Edwards Air Force Base North base
complex at that time um subsequently
I&#39;ve uh done a lot of research on this
product this this this vehicle I&#39;ve come
across a number of Declassified
documents that show that the Air Force
as early as 19 60 was wind tunnel
testing Flying Saucer shapes up to mach
20 and uh I also have Declassified NASA
documents that show similar shapes uh in
fact this is this is the document here
that
uh more or less um details the uh the
wind tunnel testing up to mach 20 this
is the NASA doc document right here that
was Declassified and it shows a variety
of spherical and lentic shapes that were
flight tested up to or I should say wind
tunnel tested up to MOX 6 um I
subsequently uh obtain a copy of an in
office Memo from Hercules Aerospace that
describes a particular type of science
involving something called Zero Point
Energy and uh um scaler
waves um according to Brad Sorenson this
is the basis of the technology for these
anti-gravity propulsion systems the
particular document here describes six
different meetings involving uh the
defense intelligence agency and
Cooperative efforts with the the Russian
scientific community in investigating
this uh what is called the fundamental
enabling technology that was originally
discovered apparently by Nicolet Tesla
in the early
1900s anyway u i could provide you much
more detail and um at a later time and I
am prepared to uh testify in detail
concerning these events and their truth
fness before Congress thank you very
much good morning uh my name is Daniel
shien uh I&#39;m an attorney and serving as
general counsel uh to the disclosure
project I&#39;m a 1967 graduate of Harvard
College and American government studies
and constitutional law and a graduate of
Harvard Law School and uh
I served as general counsel and one of
the co-consul for the New York Times in
the Pentagon papers case and was
involved in uh briefing and arguing the
case in front of the United States
Supreme Court uh giving permission to
the New York Times to publish the
classified documents the 47 volumes of
the Pentagon papers subsequent that time
I served as special counsel to the
office of f Lee Bailey as one of the
trial counsels when when we represented
James McCord in the Watergate burglary
uh and got Mr McCord to write the letter
to judge Sia to reveal the uh water the
Watergate burglar&#39;s relationship to the
plumbers unit uh in the in the White
House at that time subsequent to my
service in that case I went back to
Harvard to the Divinity School to study
judeo-christian social ethics and public
policy did my Master&#39;s work and PhD work
there and became general counsel for the
United States Jesuit headquarters in
Washington DC assigned to the National
social Ministries office and their
public policy office it was there in
1967 that or 1977 that I was contacted
by Miss Marsha Smith who was the
director of the Science and Technology
division of the Congressional research
service she uh asked to meet with me and
I met with her and she informed me that
President Carter uh upon taking office
in January of
1977 held a meeting with then the
director of Central Intelligence who was
George Bush
Senior and demanded that the director of
Central Intelligence turn over to the
president the classified information
about unidentified flying objects and
the information that was in the
possession of the United States
intelligence Community concerning the
existence of extraterrestrial
intelligence this information was
refused to the president of the United
States by the director of Central
Intelligence George Bush
Senor the director insisted that the
president uh in order to have access to
this information needed to have
clearance to contact the Congressional
research service to contact the United
States House of Representatives Science
and Technology division to have them
undertake a process to declassify this
information
because the DCI suspected that the
president was preparing to reveal this
information to the American
public the Congressional research
service Science and Technology division
under the directorship of marshia Smith
was contacted by the house Science and
Technology committee and instructed to
undertake a major investigation of the
existence of extraterrestrial
intelligence and the relationship of the
UFO phenomenon to this I was contacted
by Miss SMI and ask in my capacity as
general counsel to the United States
Jesuit headquarters uh National Social
Ministry Office to see if we could
obtain access to the Vatican library to
obtain the information that the Vatican
had with regard to extraterrestrial
intelligence and the phenomenon of the
UFOs uh I pursued that with the
permission of Father William J Davis the
director of the national office and we
were refused
access as the United States Jesuit would
order to the information in the
possession of the Vatican Library when I
reported this to Miss
Smith uh she then later subsequently
asked me to uh participate in a project
which I can go into some detail during
the question and answer period or later
to
individuals uh pursuant to which uh I
was uh given access to as a special
consultant to the United States Library
of Congress Congressional research
service to the classified portions of
the Blue Book Project of the Air Force
at that point it was in
1977 approximately uh May of
1977 I went to the Madison building of
the United States Library of Congress
there was no one in the building at that
time it was brand new I was directed to
a basement uh office uh where there were
two uh guards uh at the door and a third
uh sitting at the table who took my
identification uh verified that I&#39;ve
been designated as a special consultant
to the Congressional research service of
the United States Library of Congress
and was admitted to the room I thereupon
found photographs some dozen photographs
of what is unquestionably a an
unidentified flying object on the ground
that had crashed and plowed a Furrow in
a field of snow and it was embedded in a
bank an embankment uh there were United
States Air Force personnel surrounding
this craft taking photographs of The
Craft and uh one of the photographs I
could see that there were some symbols
on the side of the craft so I I
proceeded through the photographs and
found a closeup photograph of these
symbols uh I&#39;d been instructed that I
was to take no notes uh and had to leave
my briefcase and all my identification
outside of this room but I had brought
with me a yellow
pad and so what I did is I opened up the
yellow pad had and refocused the
overhead camera onto the same size as
the the cardboard backing of the yellow
pad and I physically
traced the copies of the symbols on the
side of this craft closed the the yellow
pad back put the the microfish back into
the canister reclosed the box that I had
and I said it is time for me to
leave and I took this and proceeded to
leave the office at which point the
security guard stopped me and one of
them said what is that you have there Mr
Shen which point I handed the yellow pad
to him and he flipped through all the
Yellow
Pages and never found the copy that I
had and so I took that with me and
brought it to the United States Jesuit
headquarters had a meeting with the
staff with Father William J Davis
reported this to them was authorized at
that time by the United States Jesuit
headquarters to make a report to the
National Council of churches and to
request that the United uh the the uh
the entire 54 major religious
denominations of our country undertake a
major study of extraterrestrial
intelligence which they declined to
do uh I was subsequently asked to
deliver a three-hour closed door seminar
to the uh top 50 scientists of the jet
propulsion laboratory of seti the search
for extraterrestrial intelligence which
I did do in
1977 I&#39;m more than happy to testify
under oath to these details to the
United States Congress I would be happy
to meet with any members of the press at
that time you may recall I also served
as Chief counsel to the Karen silkwood
case in which we uh obtained the rulings
in the Karen silkwood case I also served
as Chief counsel in the Iran Contra case
was the first one to testify before the
United States Congress to the existence
of the off-the-shelf Enterprise of
Richard Secord and Albert hakeim I&#39;ll be
more than happy to share the details of
what I believe to be the relationship
between this off the shelf Enterprise
and the secret government which is
concealing this information from the
American public and I am happy and proud
to serve as general counsel to the
disclosure project thank you very
much good morning my name is Carol Rosen
in
1974 after being a sixth grade school
teacher I was introduced to the late Dr
verer Von Brown in the US the father of
rocketry in my first meeting with him
during that first 3 and 1 half hours he
said to me Carol you will stop the
weaponization of
space and I said uh you know teachers
don&#39;t stop until June he said no you
have to understand this is February and
we have to prevent the weaponization of
space because there is a lie being told
to everyone that the weaponization of
space is now first being based upon the
evil empire the Russians there are many
enemies he said against whom we going to
build the space-based weapon system the
first of whom was the Russians which was
existing at that time then there would
be terrorists then there would be third
world countries now we call them Rogue
Nations or nations of concern then there
would be asteroids and then he would
repeat to me over and over and the last
card the last card the last card would
be the extra terrestrial
threat well at the time I kind of
laughed when he said asteroids and when
he said extraterrestrials I knew I
wasn&#39;t going to deal with that
subject and now we hear on the news just
today this week that they&#39;ve slid in
another enemy only this time we&#39;re going
to protect our satellites in other words
we have to have some reason to spend
these trillions to waste these dollars
on a space-based weapon system and
they&#39;re all
lies this is a system he told me that
would never protect anyone even back
then he talked about suitcase bombs he
talked about chemical viral bacterial B
biological warfare that these
space-based weapons would never protect
us against and then he told me that in
fact if you travel around the world
which I did after he died in 1977 I met
with people in over a hundred countries
who were friends they didn&#39;t want to
build space-based weapons I became a
space and missile defense consultant and
I worked with people around the world I
became a an adviser to the People&#39;s
Republic of China they don&#39;t want to
build a space-based weapon system and he
told me back then that they didn&#39;t he
said go to Russia they&#39;re considered to
be the enemy I got on a Plane by myself
when I got to Russia I had a list of
people that I had read out of the
newspaper chernenko was in office then
he was the only one I didn&#39;t get a
chance to meet they introduced me to
everyone when I got
there and when I got back I said oh my
Lord this man is telling the
truth there are is no threat and I been
waiting until this day for 27 years and
I&#39;m expecting the spin to happen because
he also explained to me that in the as a
military strategist as a person who
worked on the MX missile which I did
later he said you will find that there
is going to be a spin to find some enemy
against whom we have to build
space-based weapons and now we should
expect the spin because he said part of
the formula for the intelligence
Community is if they might have a weapon
then have to consider that they do have
these weapons so now they do have these
weapons so now we have to build these
weapon systems and that&#39;s the formula
except that it&#39;s all based on a lie and
we have witnesses here today that have
shown you that these extraterrestrial
beings that these craft that have come
here are now not UFOs they&#39;re identified
flying objects and we know that they
have beings in them and we have
witnesses here who have told you that
they can shut down our missile silos
they can stop a rocket going into space
that&#39;s a test we have witnesses here who
have worked in the classified
departments who have the courage to come
forward here to support what verer Von
Brown told me back in 1974 to
77 and I will testify before the
Congress that when I founded the
institute for security and cooperation
in outer space which I shut down a few
years ago because I didn&#39;t believe we
had a chance with this huge integrated
around the world complex we we system
that we had any chance at all of
transforming that War Industry into a
space industry that could provide
benefits like Dr Greer has said of
global warming we can end that situation
of that problem we can end the energy
crisis we can build now non-polluting
Technologies verer Von Brown used to
tell me that we could have cars back
then that drove around off the ground he
describ this to me on beams so that we
have no pollution on this planet and we
can solve the problems of the people
that are Urgent and potential and the
other animals and the other cultures on
Earth and in space and we can end the
arms race without dislocating the
industry jobs without disrupting the
economy by transforming verer Von Brown
told me the War Industry into a global
Cooperative space industry that will
provide he said finally more jobs and
profits on this planet than during any
hot or cold wartime more products and
services that can be applied directly to
solving the problems of this planet and
we can have a whole planet now that
lives on PE in peace on Earth with all
the cultures on Earth and with all the
Extraterrestrial cultures in space and
these are words that verer Von Brown
told me in
1974 and I will testify before the
Congress under oath about everything I
have said and more thank
you thank you very
much I&#39;d like to thank each of the
witnesses and for your patience we&#39;re
running about uh 50 minutes late and I
do apologize for that I want to
emphasize that all these Witnesses each
could speak for probably anywhere from 2
to 5 hours about what they have
witnessed we were trying to give you a
snapshot we have another 400 of these
Witnesses I have carried this burden for
eight years I&#39;m now giving it to you the
American people and the people of the
world to take it Forward what I&#39;d like
to do now is open uh the audience for
questions from the media uh you may
address them to me or to an individual
witness as as you deem appropriate yes
ma&#39;am my name
is yes marel Gonzalez was reforma
Mexican newspaper I have three questions
one is if
you here right here yes I wanted to know
if there are laws in this country that
in some way allowed this kind of secrecy
or not and then I wanted to know if
there&#39;s a a need to change any kind of
law and the next one I wanted to ask you
if you may is who is profiting from this
secrecy that maintains um in secret the
solution to the energy crisis I mean
well OB yeah let me get to those okay
quickly cuz we are short on time first
of all I think initially there was a an
appropriate uh National Security
apparatus in place in the 40s during the
Truman and also Eisenhower years by the
late Eisenhower years we have a
testimony from Brigadier General Steven
lkin still a practicing attorney that by
the late Eisenhower years that he had
lost control of these projects primarily
because of the compartmentalization into
the military industrial complex
operative word industrial um there are
corporations such as saic Lockheed
Martin Northrup and others that deal
specifically with this issue with
Advanced Energy and propulsion systems
connected to UFOs and I think that what
has happened from from the best we can
tell from insiders that have briefed me
for now about eight years is that we
have lost control of these projects from
a constitutional law perspective because
the infrastructure within military
intelligence and corporate channels is
so well funded and so complex and
Labyrinth that there are compartments
within compartments within compartments
and people who are in the Congress who
make inquiries and in fact President
Clinton when he made inquiries were
simply denied access as you heard
earlier that President Carter was denied
access um on your other question um I
would say that in terms of profiting
from the status quo you big oil uh there
are certain geopolitical and financial
infrastructures that would not welcome a
a definitive replacement to the fossil
fuels we can tell I will tell you and we
can prove this with other scientists who
are ready to come forward that we
already have a complete replacement for
any fossil fuels or ionizing nuclear
power plants we don&#39;t need them we
haven&#39;t needed them probably have not
needed them since the time I was born
now of course this is a major issue
you&#39;re talking a multi-trillion dollar
uh Global infrastructure change uh and
so this does hit the alarm Bells at the
National Security Council economics uh
area uh however what is more serious to
the National Security keeping the status
quo or letting ourselves go into a
global ecosystem collapse and running
out of fossil fuels and having massive
rolling blackouts not just in California
but globally we have got to do something
about this and soon and that&#39;s why we
are advocating open hearings in the
Congress other media please yes
sir I just want to know if anybody at
the UN is looking into this uh I
personally met with uh Bros bros G&#39;s
wife Aaliyah G uh who uh said that her
husband was quite concerned about this
this was in the 1990s uh since then we
know that there have been other people
at the UN who&#39;ve made inquiries the
problem is the UN has no mandate to deal
with this it needs to be given a mandate
from uh its constituent member nations
uh and I think that the public and the
member nations need to ask that the
United Nations get involved with this
this is an International Peace issue and
an international security issue and it
should be taken up by the UN Security
Council and of course we are
recommending that as well yes
sir so I think my my question is
actually to my question is to Clifford
Stone you said that you had seen aliens
on a on a craft that had crashed I
wondered if you could describe what they
look
like I
could I could but it would probably take
a whole lot of time the reason I state
that when I got out in 1989 we had
catalog 57 different
species uh you have individuals that
look very much like you and myself that
could walk among Among Us and you
wouldn&#39;t even notice the difference
except for some of the things that uh
they might be able to go ahead even in a
dark room and touch an object and go go
ahead and identify what color that
object might be they would have a
heightened sense of smell site uh
hearing
uh the uh situation is that you have
various types of what we normally call
Grays we didn&#39;t call them Grays in the
military but you had at least three
types of the Grays you had some that
were much taller than we were uh the
unique thing I that I&#39;d like to point
out for the most part is that the
entities that we did catalog were in
fact humanoid now this created a
situation where the scientific Community
was trying to figure out why that would
be the case because you would expect
that if life evolved on other planets
that they would take on some type of
other
uh being so to speak not necessarily
look humanoid or be by B pedal such as
we are but apparently we got quite a few
of the species out there that are
humanoid in appearance and that creates
a question that yet has to be answered
by science
uh yes and I&#39;m as I call on you please
State the news agency that you were with
yes yes
ma&#39;am Dean divis with United Press
International could you please address
uh the vehicle that uh there was a
drawing displayed of why would this
vehicle be on display at an air show
what is the power source that you are
asserting is going to be uh so very
useful and um how can you determine that
this this vehicle is not something um
that is being developed you know by a
government
agency uh in fact I think that was the
testimony this is an alien reproduction
vehicle and just to be clear uh this
means that it is based on Advanced
anti-gravity and Zero Point Energy
propulsion systems those are the
propulsion systems they are being
manufactured by a Consortium of
companies that include Lockheed Martin
Northrup saic and other corporations
they do have super luminal capacity in
other words faster than the speed of
light capacity um I think Mr mandish and
other witnesses as he&#39;s identified could
go into more the technical physics of it
I&#39;m just a country doctor from Virginia
I tell people I mean really and uh but
this is actually what is the reason it&#39;s
called alien reproduction vehicle is
that it&#39;s based on the study of
extraterrestrial vehicles but it is
manufactured by human uh Military
Intelligence Aerospace Contracting
Arrangements uh and this is is very
important it means that we Homo sapiens
have the ability to access this
so-called zero point field of energy
which the is the ambient field of energy
from which all matter and energy is
fluxing and can access that energy and
generate all the power we need to run
this planet without fossil fuels or
pollution do you have any direct
evidence though that this I mean we&#39;re
talking about the same government that
so appropriately named as a snooper
program carnivore so just because it&#39;s
named the alien reproduction vehicle
considering the history and the the
questions that have been existing for
such a long time about flying saucers I
mean do you know is there any direct
reason to believe that this is actually
derived from technology any of the
witnesses who can attest to that and and
how would this uh a propulsion syst a
rocket engine doesn&#39;t necessarily
translate into electricity can you
elaborate on
that uh well the first part of your
question I would say that the the the
testimony of of witnesses we have some
of whom are here others that are not
here but they&#39;re in the The Briefing
materials is that they have studied we
have studied specifically
extraterrestrial Vehicles which have
been retrieved the breakthroughs in that
research have led to applications that
have led to the building of this and
similar anti-gravity uh devices and that
uh in fact this can be proven in open
testimony before Congress and that is
exactly what we are calling for we have
the witnesses to establish this and they
also then also have the documents and
the specific uh uh details of the
propulsion systems but this is not a jet
internal combustion system at all it is
actually kicked in by a type of electric
power source and it then accesses this
ambient Zero Point Energy field that is
responsible for all matter and energy
existing and uh by special
configurations and and what have you it
causes a a a cancellation of mass
inertia and an anti-gravity effect and
uh this is a complex technical
discussion which probably beyond the
scope of this conference but we have
materials in in the briefing uh document
that we can provide you with references
uh to people who have studied the
anti-gravity effect uh as far back is
certainly the 1950s we have one witness
who said uh that his family was
connected to the ran Corporation and
that by the mid1 1950s that more money
had been spent on anti-gravity
propulsion systems than the totality of
the Manhattan Project so uh yes we can
establish those elements uh other
questions
thank you uh my name is Murray feler I
publish a newsletter downstairs here
called the Washington remote sensing
letter that deals with reconnaissance
and surveillance of the Earth from space
uh my question is this since uh 1972
with the uh launch of lat one uh and now
with the launch of commercial space
imagery there are some archived uh I
would say upwards of 35
million photographs of the Earth from
space uh and not one of them has shown a
you a a flying sorcerer are you
suggesting that uh these have been
airbrushed out we&#39;re suggesting that
there is a uh system before the public
gets hold of anything that&#39;s off of a uh
government connected satellite there is
a compartmented operation that does
indeed sanitize them from this type of
evidence and I think the testimony of of
uh uh the gentleman who here who was
with the defense intelligence agency Mr
Maynard uh Miss ha and others would
substantiate that we have other
Witnesses who have been involved in
projects where such uh items have been
sanitized out it could also be that if
you did a thorough search you might find
a few that slipped through we obviously
haven&#39;t had the research uh dollars to
go through all the millions of of images
that are cataloged to look for them but
we do know there&#39;s been a very thorough
sanitizing of this and people should not
be naive about the extent to which
covert programs using billions of our
tax dollars have been able to
effectively hide this this is one of the
sort of myths of both the media and the
public public is sort of a polyan myth
that we we live in a society where such
things could not be done in fact they
are done and we can prove that they have
been done to discredit these entire
proceedings here and I&#39;m wondering how
your screening process can you tell us a
little bit about your satisfaction level
for that well I&#39;m very satisfied that
that these are genuine and good people
who are speaking truthfully not of a 400
people that I&#39;m dealing with not 20
times this number have I been pulled
yeah I&#39;m an emergency doctor let me say
something people come into the emergency
department with flank pain Rising on a
stretcher what have they got a kidney
stone right yeah well some of them go
into the bathroom prick their finger and
squeeze blood into the water the the the
urine sample to show that they have
blood in their urine so they can get a
narcotic injection now have I been
scammed as an emergency Doctor Who has a
you know I&#39;m bright enough enough to to
kind of know when I&#39;m being scammed but
have I occasionally yeah is it possible
it&#39;s possible is it likely no and here&#39;s
what&#39;s more important you don&#39;t not
treat or accept the test the testimony
or the history of every patient that
comes in with flank pain and assume that
they&#39;re lying just because you&#39;ve been
scammed once or twice this field you
make a very good point is filled with
hoaxes and scams and what have you it
doesn&#39;t mean however that all of it is
and in fact what we&#39;re saying after 8
years of research we have found the
documents the top secret Witnesses the
insiders willing to testify under oath
before Congress that this is true now
here&#39;s another key Point some of the
people who are in this witness
pool Mr shean myself and a couple of
other attorneys are members of State
licensed professions and what that means
is that if we are perpetrating a hoax we
will lose our license to practice
medicine we will lose our LIC to
practice law because we&#39;ll be
perpetrating a hopes upon the public so
what I would say to you is that the
group of people before you are very
credible and the others whom we have
identified are we are not the CIA we
have not been able to do a $50,000
background check on each person I&#39;ll
give you that caveat but we have done
very serious interviews and betting and
by the way these people have presented
their
dd214s their defense forms uh other
documentation that show uh the two
dd214s and others that show that they
were in the military at a certain place
and a certain time so we&#39;re very
comfortable that in fact uh that the way
that the testimony will carry the day
here and that this is
real I had an insight and it relates to
your question um there have been tens of
thousands of
sightings and experiences from all over
the
world only one of
them needs to be true because if only
one of them is true then the entire case
the
Nority such evidence out of the public
domain yes government a priori all
signed agreements and Oaths that have
flowed from such operations are null and
void what that means is in any other in
legal theory is that if if if it&#39;s an
illegal
Enterprise the agreements those that are
intered as a as a as a result of that
ille Enterprise have no legal standing
so one of the things I would like to
announce today is all of the men and
women listening to this need to know
they are free to speak we are declaring
all national security OES on this
subject null and voy they are have
flowed from illegal operations that have
no standing
constitutionally my people my mother&#39;s
family who fought the American
Revolution were prisoner of war with the
British to help found this country did
not fight and die to form the United
States so that this kind of chicanery
can go on so these men are free to speak
and there can be no legal legal
repercussions against them we have legal
council will also support this Theory
and we&#39;re taking this to other
constitutional Scholars it is time for
that game to end it is time for a new
era in the
human
and on occasion has also escaped the
oversight of the uh President we know
for a fact that this has happened I
personally briefed President Clinton&#39;s
for C director on this I was informed
that they had no access to these
projects although they knew they existed
I was told the same thing by the senior
investigator for the Senate
Appropriations Committee a man named
dick damato who in 1994 told me that
there were somewhere between 440 and 80
billion a year going into these
classified projects and that he with a
subpoena on behalf of the Senate and a
top secret clearance could not penetrate
them he told me these were the varsity
team of all black projects cover
projects so this is really serious stuff
and it brings into question have we gone
down the road that Eisenhower warned us
about a little too far when he said
Beware of the military-industrial
complex that it can escape the checks
and balances of our democracy and I
think on this particular issue uh it in
fact has and it&#39;s time for um the uh
Congress to represent the people in this
regard and to reassert its oversight of
these projects one last question when
you talk about putting the checks and
balances back into place talk about the
passion of these people if you would how
confident are they well well they know
what they saw I mean and these are men
ranging from uh Air Force and nro
officials to people who have been
contract agents for the CIA to people
who uh have been pilots in World War II
and are heroes of our country the
greatest Generation that Tom broot talks
about and so what I have to say to you
is that uh these people know what they
saw they&#39;re not going to be speaking
about anything except what they directly
witnessed and we&#39;re not talking lights
in the sky and swamp gas we&#39;re talking
people who have actually retrieved uh
extraterrestrial Vehicles who are going
to be here today very good we&#39;ll take
one picture of it that&#39;s concrete and
that&#39;s based on reality but anyone who
does further research in this field will
find that they are not hostile none of
them are hostile they have shown us that
they can shut down missile silos and
Rockets they have not destroyed us and
they&#39;ve been here for tens of thousands
of years we know of 50 years worth more
or less of Secrets we know of M and the
fact is Hy greting
programs being referred to well again
we&#39;re not dealing with these kinds of
things we are dealing with credential
unable Witnesses here who have worked in
projects we&#39;re we&#39;re not dealing with
that we&#39;re dealing with what we know
what we know is that these are not
hostile activities I don&#39;t know how to
explain this to you except the people
