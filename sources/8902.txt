The manager swung at the big guy and a smaller man started shouting, ‘I'll kill ya!’  He was reaching over Walter and I when he pushed Walter out the door and the other two went out with Walter.  I grabbed hold of the door.  I heard Walter yell, ‘He's got a gun!’  Walter was wrestling with the little guy and I looked to the right of the door and saw the big guy ejecting a shell into the chamber of a gun.  He was pointing the gun in Walter’s direction.  I swung at the gun when they both started firing at each other.  I was caught in the cross fire. There were thirteen shots fired. I was hit three times, through my right hand, through the left forearm, and in the left arm part of bicep muscle. I saw one bullet pass my eyes and hit concrete right in front of me.  During this episode, my spirit left my body.  I was looking back at my body shaking uncontrollably. I became very calm but had thoughts of how I was going to explain to Walter’s wife and nine children I tried my best.  I thought he was dead. Also how to tell my parents?  In the calm was a white light of calmness. Thank you for letting me tell my story, as for today I do not fear death.

Two weeks ago, I crashed my motorcycle on our gravel road at approximately forty five miles per hour.  I assumed I was knocked out.  I picked the bike up, road it home, washed up a little bit, and went to a benefit and Alcoholic’s Anonymous meeting.  There were two nurses at the meeting who cleaned me up.  They had never been to that meeting before. Then I drove to the benefit all the while people telling me I should go to the hospital.  I said, I will be alright. I did not realize I was having blackouts at the time. They called the Sheriff to take me to hospital at the benefit and I wouldn't go. No insurance.
