    Summary:&nbsp;  From Pat Deveney's database:

 Al Servicio de las Agrupaciones Espiritualistas Americanas.
 1946  Monthly
 Bogata, Colombia.  Language:  Spanish.  Editor: Israel Rojas Romero.
 1/1, October 1946.  16 pp.

 This was the spiritualist companion to—or perhaps temporary successor to—Rojas’s Rosa-Cruz, which concentrated on occultism.  As might have been expected, the journal also contained selections from the like of Max Heindel and Rabindranath Tagore.        Issues:Union Espiritualista Americana V1 N1 Oct 1946       </p>
