&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I   had no idea that stories like this existed. In a need to confirm that my &quot;story&quot;   was real and not something I had imagined, I began researching soul mates on the   internet. My whole life I would have dreams of holding someone's hand, I could   never see his face. Waking up and separating from him was excruciating. Being   with him in my dreams felt like pure nourishment to my soul. I had a very bad 9   year marriage. During the marriage the dreams continued. I decided that my &quot;soul   mate&quot; was on the other side and gave up. When I got divorced, I worked on myself   for a year and became very healthy emotionally. At the end of this year I&nbsp;dreamt   the following:&nbsp;that I was seeing someone and it was not going well. We split up   and then I heard he was in a bad accident. I was told he was dead and then I   realized that he was my soul mate and I was devastated. Suddenly he walked up to   me and said &quot;They let me come back to you&quot;. I instantly recognized him at that   point, and I could see he was Indian or Native American.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   This dream made me start to wonder if my soul mate had come back to me. I   continued to have the &quot;holding hand&quot; dreams. One day a friend invited me to a   Native American concert. On the way to the concert I started thinking about my   soul mate for some reason. I just KNEW what it was like to love him, somehow I   remembered. It was unlike any love I had experienced in this lifetime. I   &quot;missed&quot; him even though I had no idea who he was. In the middle of the concert   they stopped so the drummer could explain that the Lakota have no word for   goodbye. He said the phrase Toksa Ake. Then he said it means &quot;I will meet you in   this life or the next&quot;. The second I heard that emotion washed over me that was   overwhelming. I burst into tears and had to leave for awhile. It affected me so   strongly I felt changed forever.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I   started to &quot;feel&quot; my soul mate coming to me. Over the course of the next year, I   had more dreams, each dream more vivid. I dreamt about Native American men often   that I would just see across the room in my dreams. I had psychic gifts all my   life, I would just know or &quot;hear&quot; (in my head) things that would come true. I   began to believe he was real and was determined to find him. I finally embraced   my gifts instead of fighting them. I was watching an episode of &quot;Lost&quot; after   that and one of the characters was telling someone about his soul mate. Before   she had died she scrolled some words in Arabic on a paper. When saying what they   meant, he said &quot;I will meet you in this life or the next&quot;&nbsp; Again, I burst into   tears and a rush of emotion I could not explain. I had past life &quot;memories&quot; of   being with him and I just knew that we had lived together in Chaco Canyon, NM a   thousand or so years ago where he had died tragically. When I began researching   Chaco Canyon I also found it linked to other ancient NA sites, including the   Hopi Reservation.&nbsp; While visiting the Chaco Canyon monument, I picked up a   recording of some Hopi dances in 1967. A month or so later while listening to   the CD, I tranced out a little bit and &quot;heard&quot; that I was to go to 3rd mesa and   that I would meet someone and stay the night on 3rd mesa. Not knowing any Hopi's   and not being able to camp there I decided this was highly unlikely, however I   made plans to go. Life got in the way and my plans&nbsp;were cancelled. A few months   later I began dating a man. He was into astrology so we looked up our   information in a Birthday book. I found that his personal star was &quot;Mintaka&quot;,   the 3rd star in Orion's belt. Later that week, while researching some &quot;ancient   mysteries&quot; (a hobby of mine), I found that someone had written a book on the   ancient connection of NA ruins and sites and their correspondence to   constellations. It turns out that if you superimpose constellations over NA   sites in the southwest, Orion's belt is exactly the 3 Hopi mesas and the third   star , Mintaka, is 3rd Mesa!!!&nbsp; I about fell off my chair. Well, I did not   continue to date this man but continued to wonder about it. &nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Several months earlier while contemplating if my soul mate existed I posed   questions to the universe. **I &quot;heard&quot; &quot;He will be #4&quot; I also heard that it   would be 7 months. My whole life I had also been obsessed with 5 pointed   stars.....somehow I just knew some kind of star would lead me to my soul mate.   Well, I dated a couple of other people and nothing worked out. &nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   One day in October upon awakening I remembered that I had a very vivid dream   about a large German Shepherd.&nbsp;&nbsp;While on a hike that day I prayed to the   universe or whoever was listening &quot;Please, please send me my soul mate!!&quot;. I   came back and went to work on MySpace page which I had set up the week before.   Several people had requested to be my friend and I was curious as to how they   found me so I&nbsp;conducted my own search. I typed in a few criteria, and then   thought hmmmm...and typed in Native American male. Lots of people popped up so I   narrowed my search to Arizona. I took a look at the pictures but wasn't moved.   Then I went back through and clicked on one when I suddenly realized this man   was standing in the picture with a very large German Shepherd. I went to read   his profile. He had set it up THAT DAY. Even more-so......he was Hopi Indian and   lived on 3rd Mesa!!!!&nbsp; I emailed him on a whim and a few hours later he emailed   me back. We chatted online for several hours. We did the same thing the next   night. It was amazingly comfortable. On the third day, at work, I was wondering   who this guy was.....and all day I listened over and over to a song I could not   get away from. The lyrics in the song said &quot;The brightest star in the evening   sky, is your love waiting there for me&quot;. On the way home I could not get that   song out of my head. That night he was not online and for reasons I could not   explain I burst into tears. I went to shut off the computer and suddenly his   chat popped up, he said &quot;Hi Beautiful&quot; . I was so excited. We chatted for a   couple of hours and when I had to go to bed I said &quot;Teach me a beautiful word in   Hopi&quot;. There was a pause, then came back the word &quot;Ladimina&quot;. I asked him what   it meant and he said &quot;Bright Star&quot;!!!!!!!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, bout fell off my chair. Our   liaison continued for a week or so, then morphed to phone conversations.   Everything was as if we had known each other forever. 2 weeks later I went to   meet him in Flagstaff, AZ. We had planned to just meet but it was so amazing I   followed him to his house on 3rd mesa and spent the night. 1 week later he said   I love you. I am a complete commitment phoebe but I blurted it out too!&nbsp; **It   was at that point that it had been 7 months since I had heard that and that he   was the 4th guy I dated since the divorce!&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Distance and major life changes on his part have made it incredibly difficult to   stay together. But the time together has been amazing and more intense than I   ever could have imagined. The coincidences and synchronicities are too numerous   to mention, but I will say, one night after not hearing from him for awhile I   dreamt that he called me and I picked it up on the kitchen phone (not the usual   phone I use) and said, Hey, I miss you. The next night I was standing in my   bathroom thinking that moment if my dream was real or not&nbsp;when the phone rang, I   went to my usual phone but there was nothing on the caller ID, so I went to the   kitchen phone, I picked it up and he said, &quot;Hey, I miss you&quot; .....this stuff has   gone on and on. One time, getting too frustrated about the distance between us   we decided to break up, I was devastated and deleted in a fury his number and   name from my phone. 2 days later it was back on my phone!! (this happened twice   and never with any other number or name) 302 .  &nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Because of the distance and the struggles he was going through, we have not been   able to yet really be a couple. I had a dream that he was lying next to me and   said &quot;Let me be for now, I will always come back to you.&quot; So I have had to be   patient. So far that has been true. Every single time I think it is over, he   comes back. I am trusting that the &quot;timing&quot; to be together is not too far off.   Being without him is crushing and being with him feels like nourishment to my   soul. I love him just like I had remembered, it's intense and amazing and makes   you just want to do good in the world and that you can accomplish anything, it   is unconditional and nothing they can ever do can change it. Although the   relationship or trying to be a couple may not be effortless, the love between   you is. Words do not need to be used and in their presence you are COMPLETELY   accepted for who you are. Time, distance and personal struggles do not change   it. It has always been. This is what a twin flame love feels like.        </body>
