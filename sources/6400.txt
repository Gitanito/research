scendant or Cusp of the seventh houl'e, where the Sun, Moon;
Planet, or any fixed Star (within the limit of such circl~s of
La,titude or declination,) is seen to rise O\' set continually,
therefore the line termed the Equator, is divided into 12 equal
parts, each part is known to pass any Meridian in two hours of
time, for all Latitudes North or South, and those lines pa!<sing

hen the Sun i~ in the
first point of!S, his dm-ation aboTe the Earth, or from rising to
11etting in this Latititude, will be- 16 honrs 34 minutes, the
length of our day, but if the Sun was in the first point, or
scruple of vt the Southern tropic, then his duration above the
Earth, would be only 7 hours 26 minutes, the length of ~ur day,
ltut if in the first point r or ~ then would the dqraiton ofthe
Sun, from ri!!ing to setting, be 12 hours the length of the day,
so will it encrease or decrease, according as the Sun shall depart
or approach the Equator, North or ~onth, in each degree oftl1e
Ecliptic, this proves that as tl1e day let1gthens, so will the night ,
shorten, and on the contrary, as the day sl1ortens so the night
will lengthen, and is what is termed in Astronomy, the Diurnal

more or less, than such measurement made by the twelve houses,
in any Parallel, North or South of the Equator, that the Sun,
Moon, or such Planet or Star shall be found, at any given time,
which always varies according to the declination ofsuch Planet,
Star, &c. North or South, in order to understand· the full
meaning ofthe same, y,ou'll observe that the Sun, Moon, Planet
or Star, placed on the Cusp of the ascendant or first lmuse, will
be in a Mundane Sextile * Aspect, to the third and ele\"enth
house, in a Quartile a to the fourth and tent.h house, and in a
Trine /:),. to the fifth and ninth houses, and in Opposition 8 to
the seventh house, so that the Sextile Aspect il4 the :Jpace of twe
whole houses, the sinister *is the third house, and the dexter
the eleventh house, &c. the Quartile Aspect is the space of three
houses, the Trine Aspect is the space offour houses, the Semi• .
quartile is the space of one house and a. half, the Sesqui-quad·
rate is tlie space offour houses and a half, and an Oppositionj~
the opposite house, let it be what house it may.

JIUND4NE PARALLELS.
The llundnne Parellels, Jtre the eatp1al distance of any t\fo
points from the mid·heaven, mcttdion or tenth house, pne to
the right and the other to the left hand, not exceeding the limit
of the first and seventh bou~e, so in like manner from the
lmnm·creli, or Cusp of the fourth house, not exceeding the
limit:J of the first and seventh houses, aa before.
RLIPT PARALLELS.
The Rapt Parallels are the same as the Mundane Parallels, .
only derives the name of Rapt, on account of die quickness of"
time any two Planets are brough' to that position, which is by
the rapid motion of the Earth, on its axis from We:ino East, as
for example, to find the Rapt Parallel Qfthe Sun and Mercury, ·
in PLATE, No. 3, we -proceed thus, finst draw a perpendicular
line through the body of the Sun, .Parallel to the Meredion lino
another line through the b&dy of the Planet Mercury, then
draw another line in the centre of those two lines, Parallel to
each, when tl1is centre line ia brought to the l\Ieredion line,
then will the Rapt Parallel of the Sun and .Mercury be com·
pleated, as the Sun will be in the tenth bou.se, as far distant
from the l\Icredion or the Cusp of tbe IPid·heaven, aa Mercury
will be distant from the same line, and posited in the ninth.
house, in like manner we proceed w.ith rci;~t to the Rapt..
Parallel of the Sun and Jupiter, by drawing a line thronth the.
body of Jupiter, and another between Jupiter's line and the
Sun's line, the same as with the Sun and l\Jercury, that when
this centre line between the Sun and Jupiter, shall be brought._
to the Meredion, then will the Rapt Parallel of the Sun and
Jupiter be complea.ted; tll• Sua will Ml ill \lie ~d& heute, aa.

such parts or places suitabl<', the like might be done with rt'91JeCt

Planets.be so placed.
ZODIACAL PARALLELS.
The Zrnliacal Par.illrls (nre tbe same as the Antisdons,) they
are lines drawn Parallel with the Equator and Tropic's, cutting
through the Ecliptic in two places, l>cing equal distances from
"the first poin of !!l> on the N Ol'th side t11e Equator, as for ex-
ample, the Sun's place being ~ 8 degrees, i;io that his Zotliacal
Paral!~l will 1all in the 22 degree of Q., Jupiter's place is the
28th dPgrt>e of tS, therefore his Zodiacal Parallel falls in 2 de--
Rl'eeff of Q., now as to the same proct'!!s with respect to Zodiacal
Parallels, on the South side of the Equator, being two pointli
at equal distance from the first point of VI, as for example, we
find in PLATE No. 3, the place of the Planet SaturA, I) in the
28th cregree ofthe sign Aquaris, :::: so that his Zodiacal Paral-
lel f11.lls in two degrees of the sign Scorpio, Ill likewise being
posited in the ~5th degree of the sign Pisces, X his Zodiacal
Parallel falls in t.be 5th degree of the sign Libra, ~ both those
points being equlll distance from the fir:i;t point of vt in liko
manner, with all others at all times: thus ends the treatise con-

tional distance from the Cusp of the several houses, or lines, 8"
they are found to be in th~ir several plncee in the Zodiae, or on
the Ecliptica.l line, 1Vhich is done in the same manner as you
iwill be taught her('ftfler, to prick otf tltc points on any line, for
to obtain t,he pole of the Sun, Moon, or other Planets, (by the
.ise of the instrument called the Triangle,) whose se\·eral dis-
tances from the .Moon's body to the point& or aspects, are the
.Arch ofdirections converse, and to be measured by the scale of
,ears, as the Zodiacal directions from the pole of the Sun, with
their difference, tae Zodiacal directions aro always to the left,
or succ~ion of the 11igns, but converae directions are always
.from the Sun or Moon's body to the right, on the line drawn
from the centre of'heir re~pective bodies only, and nothing else.

same proportion in the third house, is his a in the world, the
Mme proportion found in the fou11h ho~., will be his !Ji. aspect

house, on the same line to the point where the 6. is placed, and '
you will obtain the point where the Ssq. aspect ofsuch Planet
18.lls on his line, then add 9 parts out of30 ofsuch part, (in the
house where the a.~t will fall,) to the point at the Ssq. and
you will find the Bq. a.~t, then the oppos\te point, which is ·
ea.qua\ to one half t'he length of the Pianisphere, and there will
be found the opposilion ofsuch Planet in mundo, or the world,

TABLE OF REDUCTION EXPLAINED.
The fiDt column with D. M. on the top, which Rtands a,r
degrees 1md minutes, the figures down are for the number or
degrees and minutes the Sun, Moon, or any Planet, moves in
twenty-four hours; the second column with D. M. S. and MS. T.
on the top, expresses the quantity any Planet moves in one hour,
according to what such Planet moves in twenty-four hours, u
.found in the fi~t column, the answer is in the second column,
D. stands for degree;;, M. for minutes, S. fo1· seconds, and T. for
thirds, that his halfseconds, not of time, but space, as one de•
gree contains sixty minutes, one minute contaill:i sixty seconds,
as for example, suppose a Planet moves I degree 46 minutes in
2 -
1 hours, how far do~s it move in 1 hour; at the top o(the first
column is the figure 1, and in the same line of the second column.
is 0 2 30, which shews that if the Planet be 24 hours moving l
degree, it then moves :2 minutes and 30 seconds in one hour,
then seek 46 in the first column, under diurnal motion, and in
the next column under one hours motion, you'll.find 1 M. 55 S.
0 T. which shews that the said Planet, moved 1 minute and 55
seconds in one hour, both sums being added together, will make
4 minutes and 25 seconds, which is what such Planet moved in
one hour, being the 24th part of 1 degree and 46 minutes, sup·
pose the Moon moves 13 degrees in 24 hours, how far will she
move in 4 hours, first seek 13 in t\1e first column, unde1· diumal
motion, ond in the second column, under one hours motion, you
will find OD. 32 M. ro S. which shews that the Moon moved 32
minutes and 30 seconds, (being half a minute) in one hour, so by
multiplying th~_said numbers by 4, will make her motion in
that time, to be 1 degree and 40 minutes in 4 hours, the same
method must be persued with the Sun, Moon, and all the Planet&
at all times.

This table is by way ofexample, shewing how much a Planet
moves in 24 hours, by subtracting the less sum from the greater,
which points out the hourly motion by the table of reduction,
nnd by the result of this, you ha\·e the Planets places for the
scheme in PLATE No. 3, the same must be doQe by all, in order
to obtain the true places of the Planet~, at all times and seasons,
in all nativities, schemes, or horoscopes; tl1cn after you have
once obtained the places or degrees ofthe Sun, Moon, and each
respective Planet; you will take notice of the Sun'~ place, and
let that be placed on the Meredion line, by laying PLATE No. l
with the Ecliptic edge, at 8 degrees of t:5 on the said line, that
will be the pla~e of the Sun at noon, or 12 o'Clock on the 28th
day of April, but as the scl1eme is set for 10 hours 41 minutes,
A. M. being one hour and 19 minutes before noon, or middle of
the day, you must bring or move the PLATE No. I, the Ec-
liptic back to the left hand, until you have 17 degrees of the

Equtor, and Tropicol lines, s and vt where the thread cuts the
.line, make a dot on the line, do the same on the other Tropical
line as before, then take the wooden nile with curved edges, and
Jay it down with the line across its centre, to touch lhe mark or
dot on the Equator, and on the dots on the other lines aforesaid,
&hen, with a pencil draw a line through the centre of the S\Ul
and other dots, which when done, is the pole of the Sun
compleated; and in the same manner the poles ofall the other
Planets are to be found at all times, likewise the Aspect in the
Zodiac, are to be brought down or up on the Sun and Moon's
line, for directions called converse motion as before mentioned,
when all the Pia.net:> poles are found and set down \n order,
then mark off all the dilfe1't'nt Aspects on the Ecliptic line, in
the following order : as the Sun is posited in 8 degrees of ~
add 45 degrees to 8 degrees of ~, for his Smq. Aspect will i8ll
in 23 degrees of n, add 15 degrees more to 25 degrees of n,
which will fall in 8 degree3 of 5, the *add 12 degrees more for
the Q. which fnlls in 20 dt>grces of !!D, add 18 degrees more to
ro of s, then you'11 find the a will fall in 8 degrees of Q' add
~ degrees more for the 6.. Aspect, and it will be found in 8
degrees of "", then add 15 degrees for the Ssq. which falls in
the 23rd degree of ~, then add 9 degrees more for the Bq. As·
pect, and the same will be found in 2 degrees of~, add 36 more
it falls in 8 degrees of nt, ~king 180 degrees, which is the e,
these are all the Sun's sinister Aspectll in the Zodiac.
Next proceed to gain the dexter Aspect, thu!'!, reckon 45 de-
grees backward from tl1e Sun's place, for the Smq. and it will be
found m23 degrees of)(, 15 degrees more back for the*' and
it is found in 8 degrees of M, then go back 12 degr~ for his Q.
. which i.s to be found in 26 degrees of : , fall back 18 degrees
, more for his rI, which is in 8 degrees of =, then go 30 degrees
more for 11is fl .4.spect, nnd it will be found in 8 degrees ofVf,
ifyou reckon 15 degrees back for the S!iq. it will be found in 23
degrees of J , 9 degrees more back will point out the Bq. to be'
foun.d in 14 degrees of f, by the same metltod the Aspects of
all the Planets are~() be found·and !!et down accordingly.
!S ·.
CONCERNING THE MOONS NODES.
You are to observe, the Moons path forms a circle round the
Earth, which departs from the Ecliptic on two sides, about 5
degrees 17 minutes, called her Latitude, the one North and the
other South, where this circle cuts the Ecliptic or Suns path, is
dled the Nodes, the point so cut, where the Moon departs to
the North side of tbe Ecliptic, is termed or called the North
Node fortunate Node or dragons bead, the opposite is called the
South Node, the unrortunate Node or dragons tail, and what•
ever part.the Moon shall at any time be found on this li.ne, se
will her latitude be North or South, according to her distance,
from either of the points called Nodes, those Nodes or points,
are ahvays opposite each other, and falls backward or retrograde
in the whole circle, in about 18 years and 225 days, which is
about S minnles and 11 seconds ofa degree, in 24 hours of time,
and the nearer to those points the Sun and Mrun shall be con-
joined. so will the Sun be Eclipsed the greater, and nearer, they
shall be to the same point, at oppositions or full Moons, so
much the greater will be the Eclipse of the Moon in proportion,
ifthe Moon be the North side of the Ecliptic, th8:t is past the
North or ascending Node, then will the Sutl be Eclipsed on the
'Upper part, if a conjunction, but if it be an opposition or full
Moon, then will she be Eclipsed on the lower part, but ifshe be
d~parted from the South or descending Node of the conjunction,
then will the Sun be Eclipsed on the lower part, and ifit be the
Dpposition or full Moon, then will the Moon be Eclipsed on the
upper part, more ro less, according to the distance they shall be
·&om either ofthe Nodes.

the point of latitude, let it be North or South, in any Nativity,
then make a dot for the plllCe of latitude, and let the same dot
be for the centre of the Moon, when the Moons ~le be drawn,
and all the Aspects and Planets be set down in tht>ir respective
place11, on the Ecliptic and the Sun and Moon.q line, then draw
lines parallel from the Moons poles, to the S<:veral Planeu and
Aspects, (8.8 well as from the Suns pole) and measure them by
the scale ofyears in the like manner.
TO FIND THE PLACE OF TIIE PART OF
FORTUNE, OR LUNAR HORESCOPE.
Thus you are to understand (as the great Claudius Ptolomy
saith in his Quadripartite) that the place or part of fortune, is
the same distance from the Moon on her line, as the ascendant
is distant from the Sun, on the Suns line, then let the line or
pole be drawn \brough the part of fortune, then the Parellel
lines drawn fi·om tbe poles of the part of fortune, to the ieveral
Planets and Aspects to the right hand, likewise the part of for·
tune is directed to the Cusp ofany house or houses, which is to
·the left hand, but not to the righ, hand, as the Sun, Moon, or
any Planet, it being only a certain point somewhat similar lO
the Moons Nodes.
The next thing you will observe that is here set down, ia a
Table exhibiting the Sun, Moon, and Planets places, with the
place oftheir several Aspects on the Ecliptic, (shewing it at one
view) the sign and degree of each and ewry Planet, as will be
found in the Nativity, in PLATE No. 4, set for Wednesday,
July 10th, 1811. at 7H. 6M. A. M. or 6 minutes past 7 o'Clock
in the Morning, which is as follows: .

learner might copy the same as a les:ion, whereby__he may know
how to do any other, likewise there is another Nativity l_!1id
down, for the Night of the same day, as in FIG No. 4, PLATE
No. 4, so that by that means, the learner ~·ill be thereby en·
abled to see what diffl·rcnce there is between the Arch ofdircc·
tion of the Sun, Moon, or any Planet, by day or by night, the
places of tile Planets is very little different at night, to what
they was in the day, if you allow 11alf a degree for ~ and ~
motion will be quite sufficient, but as for the Moons place and
her different Aspects, you will fin~ them set down as above, in
the Table, so that each of those Nativities can be copied cor·
reedy by the learner, as lessons, aforesaid, so fur that he might
b7 a careful attention to practice these several rules, be fully
enabled to calculate, lny down, or project any other scheme

DIRECTIONS H01' TO JILTER T~E PL.ANISPHE'R'E,
POR ANT OlJ?"EN L2TITUDE.
First, you are to take noti~e that the (centre or) Equator line,
is al.ways divided into the same divisions, let the latitrrde oftht
place it is made for be what it may, therefore the variations wii~
be found on the two tropical lines, and intermediQ;te space of tlfe
said lines, and not on the Equator line, as for example; suppo~
it is requisite to alle1· it for the CITY of YORK, whos_
e latitudei~
54 degi·ees North, p1'ocecd thus, look at the scale of polar eleva·
tions for 54, then with your pencil make a dot or point on the
upper or tropical l.ine 2"D at exact the same distance from the Me•
1·ctlion line, as the mark at 5·'1 on the scale of polar eJevatiQns., is
distant frnm the sai11e Mei·e<lion lin_
e, one tlot to the right and the
other to the left hand, in like manner, make a dot on the lowe\'
or tropical li!le 'If at the same exact distance (as before m_
eJ"ltion•
tioned) one from the one end line, ltnd a1lot~er from the other
end line, called the imum Creli, or Anti-meredion line, then,
apply the rule with curved edges, the cross line on the ~u\e t~
the Equator line, and let the edge of the said rnle at the same
time touch the dot on ea.ch of the said troP.ical lines, while in
this position, with a pencil draw your cuned line through th~
three dots on the right hand side of the Meredion line, and like· .
wise the same on the left hand side, when this is done you will
have the·ascendant or Cusp ofthe first house, and seventl} bot~se
compleated, the next thing to be <lone, is to divide each space
between these lines and the Meredion line, into three equal
par~s, with two dots on the tropical lines as before mentioned,
which, when done, take the rule and apply t~le middle or cros~
line thereof, to the ' Equator line on the Planisph~re, to toucl
t.he three dots as before, and draw each of the lines or Cus}is 'oi'
the house!', after which divide the 2nd house, 5th house, 8th
house, and the 11th house, by drawi·,;·g aline through the 1uid-
dl~
2S
die of each.of tho,;e 4 houSC!I, with the aforesaid rules, which,
when ~bus 6t.r done you will have the Planispbere compleat for
use, to set down~ Nativity, the like process must be acted upon
with regard to any other latitude, only varying it according ae
the latitude of the place may be, which is found at all times on
the above scale from the F.quator, to 68 degrees North, where
the Sun aets not on the longest day, as when he is in the first
point or ecruple ofthe tropical sign Cancer.
Another example, suppose it was wanted fur ao11£, in the
Popes teretories or elsewhere, whose latitude is 42 degrees
North, then look for 42 on the scale of polar elevations, and
tnark or point off dots on the tropical lines, as in the foregoing
example, which you will have in a proper state for that latitude
by drawing lines with the rule as before, but if for any place on
the Equator, then you will ha\"e only simply to draw straight
lines, from one tropical line to the other, through each point or
·division, on the Equator line, each line parellel to the Meftdion
line, which will be most proper, there being no latitude on the
Equator, either North or South, but ifit were required for any
place South latitude, then it is only to reverse the Pl&nisphere,
or tum it Up!ide down, so as to let the tropical line vt be for the
tropical line 20 with the different lines drawn on each house, for
the same latitude as if North, as for instance, if it where re-
quired for 51 degrees 32 minutes South latitude, then it is only
to reverse or tum the Planisphere, in its presont state.
Take notice, the Ecliptic line doe; for all latitudes North or
South without any alteration wh:Ltever, or re\"ersion when used.

Eut longitude, ft-om the Meredion of LONDON, at 10 o'Cleck
in the Morning, on the 9tli day of January 1821. which is
eaqual to 6 o'Clock in th~ Morning at LONDON, or any place
whose Meredion is in the same Longitude, (no matter what
I..titude) 88 the Sun, Moon, and Planet, would be in the same
sign, degree, and minute of the Zodiac, at their 10 o'Clock in
the Morning, as it wonld be at our 6 o'Clock in the Morning,
therefore as there is 60 degrees difference in the two Mel-edions,
which is eaqual to four hours of time you must subtract fi>ur ·
houn motion ofthe Sun, Moon, &c. from such degree of any
sign of the Zodiac they may be in, at 10 o•Clock in the same
Morning, in LONDON, or in any place in the same Longitu~ as
LONDON, but ifit be 60 degrees West Longitude, then you must
' add the foar hours motion of the Sun, Moon, &c. to what it is at
LONDON, or any plac~, whose Meredion is in.the same Longi·
tude; one hours motion is ea1ual to 15 degrees ofLongitude,
I and 8S four minutes to one degree, as measured by the degreet
ofthe Equator,
The same rule is to be observed at all times, to subtract for
1 the East Longitude, and add for the West Longitude, from such
, place or places, in the sign and degree the Sun, Moon, or Plan·
t ets shall be in, at the same hour of time as R.t J.ONDON> which
can be known at all times, by White's Ephemeries.
Another e~ample, suppose a scheme be laid down for Noon
1 day, 12 o'Clock, or 0 P. M. at a place 76 degrees East Longi- ,
tude fr1.>m LONDON, then ll_Ubtract five hours, four minutes mo-
tion of the Sun, Moon, or Planet, from what they are at 12
o'Clock at Noon, in LONDON, 88 in White's Epbemeries, but if
it should be95 degrees West Longitudefrom J.ONDON, then add
six hours and twenty minutes mQtion, of the .Sun, Moon, &c. to
I what it is in LONDON.
The next thing to be done, is to set down the several fixecl
Stus in their respective places, aa may be easily feund iA tlte

You are to observe, that the first column, shews the fixed
Stars, with the name of the constellation, that each of them are
to be found in; the second column shews the sign of the Zodiac,
with the degree and minute thereof, called the Longitude; the
third c:olumn t-1hew8 the Latitude of each Star, North OI' South,
p-om the Ecliptic or Suns path; the fourth column abews the
declination, North or South from the Epuator or Equioox, (the
Latitude and declination of the fixed Stars never varies, but js
always the same) the fifth column shews the fiemidiurnal Arch
of each Star, or the length of time each Star will be from its
rising in the eastern horizqn, or till it comes to the Meredion, or
from the Meredion until it sets in the western horizon; the sixth
column shews the magnitude of each of tho~ fixed Stars; the.
seventh column shews the nature ofeach star, to be according to
the nature or quality ofsuch Planet or Planets therein set down,
or characterized, therefore when your Nativity shall be laid
down or projected on the Pla.nisphere, then M?t down in their
proper places, such fixed Stars as you shall deem needful, in the
following rnanner:-first, by way of example, suppose you ret
down the Star called the Bulls-eye Alderbaran, first, you wiH
look·for the said Star in the aforesaid Table, which you will find
to be in the sign n 7 degrees 15 minutes;, under the head Lon··
g-itude, then look for the Latitude, and you will find it to be 5
degrees 31 minutes South, that is, be is so much on the South
side or below the Ecliptic line or Suns path, which will be found
to be 16 degrees 10 minutes North Declination, tba.t is, lu de-
grees 10 minutes above the Equator line, when in such position,.
you will find that this Star will be 7 hours 29 minutes and .21.
~conds of time from its rising, till it arrives to the Meredio~,
and the same length oftime from itit c~nating or passing the.

Meredion, until it sets in the W~tern Horizon,, the same Star
you will see is of the first magnitude, and is ofthe same nature
and quality in his eflect as the Planet t . as is characterized in
the seventh or last column.
Another example, suppotie you would set do'Wn the Virgina
Spike called Arista, look for the same Star in the Table, and
you will &nd it to be in the sign :Q:' 21 degrees 15 minutes,
having 1degree59 minutes North Latitude, which mlli't be aet
down so much to the N ol"!-h side of the Ecliptic line, or Suns
path, and will be found to be IO degrees 18 minutes South of
the Equator line, which will take 5 hours II minutes and 16
seconds oftime, from its rising to the Meredion, and the same ·
time from its passi~g the Meredion line till it sets in the Western
Horizon, which is its Semidiumal Arch; the next column points
out or ahews it to be of the first magnitu~e, and in the nex&
column you will find this Star to be of the nature and quality
of the Planet ~ and ~ , and by the same rule you are to act
with respect to all others, at all times.
Take notice, that ifyou add 50 seconds ofa degree, and one
.t11ird ofa second to their place in the preceeding Table ofLon·
aitude, for each succeeding year, and the proportionate part, for
any part of a year, or subtract 50 seconds of a degree, and one
third ofa 11eCOnd from their places ofLongitude, as in the Table
for each pn:ceeding year, by so doing you will always find theip,.
uue places ofLongitude, without error.
Next you will proceed to mark oft'on the Ecliptical line, each
ofthe terms ofthe Planets, from the Cusp ofthe 10th house, as
for example, suppose 1 degree of !!D on the Cusp of the 10th
house, then make a dot. or .mark on the Ecliptic line, in the
aame manner as the other Aspects, as is marked off in the fo}...
lowing order, against. I degrees of !!D put. ~ T, against 6 de·
gree of !!O put¥ T, against 13 degrees put tj T, against 20 de-
lt"et!S put t T, against '.?1 degrees put '1 T, against 1 degree of

Q put l, T, against 6 degrees put 't} T, and so far u you fincl
needful, do the same with respect to the first or ascendant, pro·
ceed thus, against l degree of ~ put l, T, against 6 degrees
put i T, against 11 degrees put¥ T, against 19 degrees put 't}
T, against 2i degrees put t T, o.gainst l degree of 111. put t T,.
and &0 on, the same may be done from the poles ·of·the Sun,
Moon, and part of Fortune, as the Sun, Moon, Midheaven, -
Ascendant, or part of Fortune, can be, and is directed to the
different terms of the Planets, the same as to the different
Aspects, therefore, in order to do the same with ea.c;e and pre·
c1sion; there is a circular Table in PLATE No. 8, called th~
Monitor.
THE MONITOR EXPLAINED.
The Monitor is a circular Table, containing many circle!!,
one without the other, from the centre ofthe Periphery, which is
divided into twelve equal parts, by lines dt'&wn from the centre,
the four first lines comeing from the centre to the outward circle,
with the four cardinal signs, such as the two Equinoctional
signs, r and ::i:, opposite each other, likewise the two tropical
aigns ~ and V'/1 which comprises the four quarters or Se&!!Ons of
the year, as when the Sun is going through the three signs r
~ and n is called th& spring quarter, the Sun passing through
!!a Q ~ making the summer quarter, the Sun in :!l: 111. .t gives ·
the autumn quarter, the Sun travelling through V'I =M shews
'the winter quarter, as is expressed in the second circle fro1n: the
centre, the first circle shews the bearing ofeach sign, according
to the points of the compass in the third circle is numb~red
the particular degrees, wherein the Planets have their cxallati0n1
in the one si5n and there fall in the opposite dPgreeand sign, the
next circle in divisions, shew~ what Pfanet has its day and night
house; wliat l!as his exaltation, triplicity, detriment or fall.
The
I
~4
The next circle shews tbe phases of the Planets, 11·hicb ie
every 10 degrees, the next circle will shew the terms of the
Planets, die next circle with the letters D. L. signifies t11e dark
.nd light degrees, the outer circle with tbe letters M. F. signifies
masculine and feminine, the signs outside the circles signifies
the twelve sign of the Zodiac, as specified in the same space
wherein the character of the sign stands, as in the following
example.
-Observe, that in the sign r from the first point or scruple,
until the 8th degree exclusive, is masculine, the 9Lh dPgree i!I
feminine, from the 10th to the 15th degree inclusive, is ma!-ICU·
line, from 15 to 22 degrees inclusive, is feminine, and from 22
to 00 degrees is ,nasculine, the next circle with the letters D. L.
denotes dark and light, the fir:;t 3 degrees in the sign r is dark,
from 8 to 8 is light, from 8 to 16 dark, from 16 to 20 light, from
20 to 00 dark, the circle denoting the terms ofeach Planet, the
first 6 degrees of r is the terms of 1J., from 6 to 14 <l<'grce is the
term of S, from 14 to 21 degrees is the term of ~, from 21 to
26 degrees is the term of ~ t from 26 to the end or SOth degree
is the term of ~'and so on through the whole circle, the use or
which is thus, as follows:
See wether the Sun, Moon, Planets, or the Ascendant is in
dark or light degrees, then by subtracting the less numbers from
the greater, gou'll see the majority in favor, either for dark or
light, then it declares the nati\·e to be dark or light, more or less
in proportion, according to the majority of numbers on lither
aide in like manner you will do with regard to masculine or
feminine degree!!, and ifa majority or greater number falling in
the masculine degree, declare!! the person so born, to be more
masculine than fomcnine, wether it be man or woman, but ifa
man, the more masculine, strong and robust will be his consti·
tution, bnt if it be more feminine than masculine, and it be a
woman, then "ill such woman be more feminine, weak or
delicate in her constitu~ion.
.~;;
·You will likewise observe, tlu:i.t \vith reilpect to the terms .,{
the Planet11, they nre to be thu'I understood, that in the sign 'Y"
1J. claims the first term, beginning at the fil'llt point or scruple .
of r' and ends at the point of6 degrees of r inclusive, that is,
thus, tl1e 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th, degrees of r are the
terms of¥, and the 7th, 8lh, 9th, 10th I Ith, 12th, 13th, and
14th, degrees of r are the terms of ? , t~e 15th, 16th, 17th,
18th, 19th, 20th, and 21st, dPgrecs of r arc the terms of ~, 'the
22nd, 23rd, 2.fth, 25th, and 26th, degree'! of r are the terms of
~, the 27th, 28th, 29th, and 30th, dPgreC'S of r are the terms
of"· the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, anll 8th, degrees of~
are the terms of ? , the ·9th, JOth, 11th. 12th, 13th, 14th, and
15th, degrees of~ are the termi of~, and !IO on through the
whole circle, and where one Planets terms en4s, the tenn ofa·
nother Planet begins, succe:sivcly, so that if any Planet being
in any such degree, is then i.n the terms of such ·Planet so de-
scribed.
Further ob1iervation on the PhaReS of tho Planets is not un•
necessary, which is thus, that in the sign r, the 1st, 2nd, .'3rd,
4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th, degrees of r is the Phase
uf ~' the 11th, 12lh, 13th, 14th, 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th, 19th,
and 20th, 'degni.es of r is the Pha.ore of the 0, the 21st, 22nd,
23rd, 24t~ ~'26th, 21th, !8th, 29th, and 30tl1, degrees of r
is the Phase of ? , die litt, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th 9th,
and 10th, degrees of the sign ~ is the Phase of ~, and so on
through the whole twelve aigos oftbe Zodiac.
In the division of the fourth circle ofthe Monitor, appropri·
ated to the eign r, you will find t D. H. which signifies that
the Planet t claims that sign as his day house, that is he rnles
that sign by day, and that whatever house of the beavt>n~, (as
shewn by the Planisphere) is occupied by the sign r, or on the
Cusp of whatever house the sign r shall happen to be in, then
the r·1a.net t is !'aid to be chief lord of, or ruler of ~uch house,
the ~ame would be the case with respect to the sign 111., as is
witk
Digitized by Google
-56
with the sign r~ only this difference, tbo.t in the !'lign 11\. y.u11
find J N. H. which denotes it to be J night house, or that he
l!OVerns that house or sign by night, or whatever houite or Cusp
thereof, which the sign nt shall happen at any time to be upon,
or occupy, then J is lord of that house, or governs such house
principally, as is the case with the sign r as before mentioned.
In the same division you will find the 0 Exalt. 19, ·which
.denotes tl1at the 0 ha.<> his Exhaltation in the 19th, degrees of
the sign r, and that in the 19th, degree of the sign~, he has
his fall, it being the very opposite point to his Exaltation, the
one is fortunate, the other unfortunate. .
The next thing to be taken notice of, is that in the same di·
vision will be seen the 0, 1J. Trip. which shews that the 0 and
the Planet 1J. rules that Triplicity, which is the three signs r,
Q., and .t, the 0 rules it by day, and 1J. by night, underneath
l>tands ~ Det. which shews that the Planet ~ when placed or
posited in the sign r, is then in her Detriment, as she likewise
is, when placed or posited in the sign nt, each of which sign•
atre in a direct opposition to her own signs, or houses, which
are the signs ~ and ~, u is expressed thus, in o ~ D. H. or
'f day house, and ~ 'f N. H. or ~ night house, then in the
i>ame divisioh of r is placed ~ Fall. 19, which declares that the
Planet b whenever he shall be in the 19th, degrees of the sign
r, then he is in hi• fall, and very unfortunate, as being in a
direct opposition to the 19th, degree of the opposite sign ~,
where he bas hi~ Exaltation, and thereby fortunate, having great
power in that degree, as in the sign :a: he has his 'friplicity with
the Planet tJ, as specified in the Monitor, thmi, n I] and t}
Trip. ~ I] ·and !fl 'frip. :::: l} and ~ Trip. which shews that
ll1e Planet T] governs or rules this Triplicity by day, and ~ by
night, the same rule holds good with all other parts of the
lfonitur.

The Planisphere is 110 constructed that ·many pleasing im1tf'ltt'o
lions may be given and received, by the use thereof in divers
experiments.
As for example, suppose any person would wish to know
what o'Clock it is, at any given time by the Sun, when it shine!'!
~lear, fi"!t by the use ofthe Quadrant, or any other instrument
answering the same purpose, take the altitude of the Sun, or his
height above the Horizon, then draw a line Parallel to the
Equator line, according to the declination he shall have, 6e it
North or South, as is always known by the degree of such sign
of the Zodiac, lie shall at such time be in, as measured by the
scale ofdeclinations, then from the aforesaid line, fin<l the point
'vhich. wi.ll answer to the distance of the Sun from the Horizon,
by aperpendicular line being brought down from such point, to
touch the serpentine line called the Hor.izon, such perpendicul&l'
line must be Parellel with, or a equal distance from the 'Mere-
dion line, the upper amd lower part when thus done, then s<'e
the distance the Sun shall be from the Meredion line, and apply'
t11e same distance to the scale of right ascension, in time and
degrees, and so far as the said distance extends itse!f from the
point O, (where the figures 360 is placed, meaning where the
first beginning is always made) so shall it be RO many hours and
minutes as is there specified, befo1'! noon, or the middle of the
day, or so many hours and minutes after the middle of the day,
as the Suns position shall happen to be at the time of ohserva•
&ions.
Another example, shewing how a Planet can be situated sn
as to be a Morning Star, and an Evening Star on the same day,
that is, to rise before tlie Sun, and set after the Sun, which is
when such Planet is considerably North Latitude, of the Suns
line, which is generally 'the ~e with the Planet ~,she being
•een most conspicuous and clear in such positions, more than
any other Planet, she being then nearest the Earth, owing to
her retrograae conjunctions with tlte Sun,. at was tlte case Otl
th.(l

the 21st, day orMay in the year 1817, when the Sun WU in the
beginning of the first degree of the sign n, and ~ was in the
same sign and degree, in conjunction of the Sun, with near S
degrees ofNorth L:.titude, which when laid down on the Plan-
isphere, will be so much higher than the Sun towards the North,
and will be seen to rise about 27 minutes of time before the Sun,
~d set 27 minutes after the Sun, on that day.
With regard to the Eclipse of the Sun or Moon, by the Plan-
isphere, the position or place of an Eclipse might be known at
all times, whether it be of the Sun or Moon, shewing in what
house it falls in, and by measuring its distance from the Mere-
dion line, by the scale ofthe Suns right asct'nsion, in time, will
point out the place on the Earth, where such Eclipse shall be
seen, accmding to the Suns declination, and Moons Latitude
1lnd declination, at such time of the Eclipse>, wherein yo'1 may
.know how much the Sun or Moon may be Eclipsed, and on
what part, the upper or lower, according to the Latitude the
1\Ioon shall have, North or South, as when the Moon is North
Latitude at the time of the conjunction, or the Eclipse of the
Sun, the Eclipsed or dark part will be on the upper part ofthe
Sun, but if the .Moon be South Latitude, at the time of the con-
junction or Eclipse of the Sun, then will the dark or Eclipsed
part be on the lower part, or side of the Moon, and if the
Moons Latitude be South, tl1en will the dark or Eclipsed part
be on the upper side of the Moon, the quantity Eclipsed will
be so much in proportion as the quantity of Latitude of the.
Moon !'hall be at that time, the less the Latitude of the Moon,
the more the Sun or Moon will be Eclipsed, the greater the
Latitude of the Moon, the less will be the obscuration or Eclipse
ofeither Sun or Moon, tl1e greater the distance of the Moon
fi·om either of the nodes, the more will be her Latitude, and tbl'
ncorer the Mlilon is to c>ither of the nodcf', the le!<s will be her
Latitude, and the ob,;curation of light will be always more or
less accordingly, as repre~ented by f'JG PLATE No. 4, which
thC'W~
. .:J~
shews the appearance of tbe same in each Eclipse, from one te
nvelve digits, according to the quantity ofany such Eclipse, or.
obscuration oflight, from the Sun or Moon, as it might happen
to be.
Likewise, any person may by the use ofthe Planisphere, kno•
at any time when any two Planets shall meet together in con-
junction, what part of the Earth such meeting shall be virticle,
er seen in its Meredion, according to its Longitude from LON•
DON, or what house it shall hill in, of a figure setfor this or any
other appointed place, as for instance the notable conjunction of
Saturn and Jupiter, which hills in 2.5 degrees ofthe sign Aries,
which heppens on the 19th, day of June, 1821, at 9 hours, 48
minutes, and 40 seconds, P. M. of our time, in LONDON, which
falls in the second house of a ftgure set for LONDON, or any
other place, whose Meredion is the same as ours, because at
that time, 24 degrees of the sign Scorpio, is on the Cusp of the
lentb house, that ii;, on the Meredion of LONDON, and nineteen
degrees ofthe Celestial sign Capricorn, is ascending in the East,
but the two Planets, Saturn and Jupiter, when in conjunction,
"Will he then transiting the Meredion in 150 degrees and 30
minutes, East from LONDON, and will also inform any curious
person what conntry that is in, by merely inspecting the Teres-
tial Globe, or Map ofthe Eastern Countries.
ON CONJUNCTIONS,
The first and greatest ofall the rest, is the conjunction of the
two superior Planets, J, and ¥, in the first degree or term ofthe
celestial sign Aries, which happens but once in 960 Yea~.
The second ill the conjunction of J, an~¥, in the first degree
or term of every Triplicity, and this is accomplished once in 240
Years, yet once in 21 Years they meet in conjunction in one
part or other ofthe Zodiac,
Digiti: ed by Google
40
The third is the conjunction of l) and t , in the Ant degree
er term of the siifl !!ii, and this takes place in about once in
every 30 Years.
The fourth is the conjunction of the three superiors, I, ¥ and
t , in the first degree, term, or phase, ofany sign.
The fifth is the conjunction of¥ and t , which is a mean and
the least conjunction of the superiors, and therefore is not the
forerunner of such great calamities, as any of the other before-
mentioned conjunctions.
The sixth is the conjunction of the 0 with any of the rest of
the Planets, at the time ofhis entrance into the first point of the
sign Aries.
The seventh and last, is t11e conjunction <'f the 0 and O whick
happens once in ~very month, and which is called the new
l\foon.
.AN 4.PPENDIX TO· THE MONITOR.
There are certain degrees in the Zodiac termed smoky de~
grees, which is to ,be understood in the following manner, that
ifany of those degrees should arise on the Eastern Horizon or
ascendant, at the time of a birth, then will they declare the
native so born to be ofa mixed complection, neither dark nor
light, but partaking of both, ancl similar to his complection will
be his understanding, in many respects, in .Aries, ~, II, ~ and
M, are no such degrees to be found, but the 20th, degree of ~,
the 20th, Q., the 22nd, degree of~' the 2-lth, degree of IT\., the
23rd, degree of l , the 15th, de~ree of vt, and the 4th, degree
of =, are the smoky degrees. _
Next in order, you are to observe that there is a certain
number of degrees in the Zodiac, called void, the nature of
which is th.us, that ifeither of those degrees ascend the Horizon
the lord or the ascendand or Moon should be found in any of
them at the birth, it declares an imbicility, more or less in the
jud~ment of such native, and the·further he enters into conver-
K ~tin
41
aation orbusiness, the more easily will it be discovered, thOle de·
grees areas follows, the 24th, and 30th,degrees ofArieS, the 12th,
and 20th, of ts, the 16th, and 30th, of D, the 18th, and 30th,
of!?D, the .25th, of Q., the 10th, and 27th, of ~, the30th, of :a:,
the 14th, and 29th of 111., (in t none) the 25th, of Yf, the 25th,
of =, the 25th, of M, are each stiled degrees void~ ·
Then follows certain degrees in each sign, called deep or pit•
ted, the signification of which is, that if the ascendant, its lord
or the Moon should be situated in any of them, then the native
would be hasty and ofan imperfect speech, incapable ofexpress-
ing his desires or sentiments, resembling a man in a pit, in want
of another to help him out, those degrees are as follows, the 6th
11th, 16th, 23rd, and 29th, of Aries, the 5th, 12th, 24th, and
25th, of ts, the 2nd, 12th, 17th, 26th, and 30th, of u, the 12th
17th, 23rd, 26th, and SOth, of~, the 6th, 13th, 15th, 22nd, 23rd
and 28th, of Q.. the 8th, 13th, 16th, 21st, and ~d, of~' the
17th, 20th, and 30th, of :a:, the 9th, 10th, 22nd, 23rd, and 27th
of l11., the 7th, 12th, i5th, 24th, 27th, and 30th, of t, the 7th
17th, 22nd, 24th, and 29th of vt, the 1st, 12th, 17th, 22nd, 2-hh
and 29th, of =, the 4th, 9th, 24th, 27th, and 28th, of M.
There is likewise a certain number ofdegrees called deficient,
lame, or azimene degrees, which if the ascendant its lord or
the Moon should be in any of them, then will the native be
crooked, Jame or deformed, or in i1ome manner vitiated in the
member, or that part of the body which that sign governs, in
which such azimene degree shall happen to be, this rule is in-
variable, and so unexceptionable, that it should be well con·
aidered in the judgment ofevery nativity, those degrees are as
follows, in Aries, u, ~' :a:, and M, are none but the 6th, 7th,
8th, 9th, and 10th, of ts, the 9th, 10th, 1lth, 12th, 13th, 14ta
and 15th, of !!D, the 18th, 27th, and 28th of Q., the 19th, and
28th, 111., the lst, 7th, 8th, 18th, and 19th, of l, the 26th, 27th,
2Sth, and' 29th of Yf, the 18th, and 19th,. of :::::, are azimene
tlc-~rccs.

You are to note, that every Planet in the Solar System, ~n
eome measure or othe1-, contributeth to the government of the
lrnman body, and its actions, as well as ofthe world in general,
(for which they where ordained by an allwise creator,) but some
much more forceable than others, and denotes or causes gre~t
nccidents and mutation, in the System of each and every in-
dividuals affairs, in Olli! respect or other, according ·.to their
station in life, as well ai the alfail's of the world in general,
some for good and others for evil.
First, the great and most notable conjunction of 1) and¥, in
the firey triplicity, which is the three signs r, si, and .t, they
being. in 6. .to each other, and is of the snmc nature and quality
with each other, therefore.this conjunction is of the greate»t im.
po~~ce, as tho!ie two Planets are the highest, and far above the
rest of the .Planets, (except the Planet Herachel) and· cott-
eequently the slowest and more ponderous in their respective
. \ .
motion.~.

motions, wl1ich prm·mi, they barn much more pov;er to a.ct and
perform what they shall denote, than any of the inferior Planets,
as i1> the case in any piece of machinery, "'·here the larger wheels
.ha,·e the greater power to command the smaller ones, as e\·ery
wheel therein as its respective effice to perform, in due order, so
also the 0, O, and each nnd every Planet and fixed Star, in the
System, (or uniYcrse) have their r~pcctive office to perfonn,
continually without ce;ising, in one regular and uniform manner,
but with respect to the etlccts or events arising from the conjunc-
tion of the Planet l;> and 1/. in any persons nath·ity, first it must
be con!-iidcred in what house of the natives horo!'cope it falls in,
for in the different liouscs it l1as different effects, accordingly in
the first house it shew!! illness, or some disaster to befall the
nath·es person, perhaps captivity if the lorcl ofthe natives ascend-
ant, be weak at the tiu~e of birth ; if in the second house, it
betokens poverty, loss ofmonry, or mo\·eable goods or treasure,
or waste ofsubstance in various ways, unfore:-een; in the third
house, dangers in travelling by land, it shews desensions a-
mongst relations 01· neighbours; in the fourth house smi1e
troubles and cross purpose~, concerning the dwelling or landed
property, belonging to such native, in the fifth house, then ex·
peel something concerning the nati\"CS child or children, some
iickness or other cabmity to atten<l them; in the sixth houi:;c,
it foresheWii sikncss to the native, or some trouble with respect
to their domestic sen•nots, perhaps loss thereby, but ifthe native
il10uld be a scnant of any capcity themselves, then beware of
fellow servants as they might be expected to strive to deprive
the native of that employment, by some cunning artifice or other;
in the seventh house, it betokens some illness or other trouble:-,
to attend the husband or wifo, ns it sl1all be, or some la.wsuits
might be expected, or some matters ofeither, if the nath·e be in
partnership with any other person in business, then some disa·
agreement might be expected to take place; in the eighth house
shews the native will or might expect some death, in some
brauch of the family to liappcn, or the lo~~ of money, goods, or
.t. other
45
other property of some..diseased person, or money or bad debte
. in the eounie oftrade; in the ninth house, it.will have its eft'ecta
thus, such as dangers in sea voyages, foreign journies, 1069 of
goods by shipwreck, through storms, or by pirates or sea rob-
bers, or some disputes with lawyers, ecclesiastic» or churchmen,
or disappointment in the Mle ofgoods, consigned to..any foreign
market; in the tenth house, it shews the loss ofhonour or office
decay or loss. in trade, bankruptcy, or employment, accordine
to the natives station in life, whether high or low ; in the e-
leventh house it denotes the loss of a friend, or some falHC and
· deceitful ones, by which the native might expect to be a. looser,
more or less in some rcr-pcct or other, or disoppointment in hi11
expectations in some ca.c;e, according to the business tli<>n in
\land; in the twelvetb house, then beware ofprivate enemies,
or danger of imprisonment, and all other calamities, arisilli
from the power ofprivate enemies, these effects might be fully
expected to be much more forcible, should it take plnce in any
£1ign, where '1 is prominent or· as full i}ower, more than the·
Planet ¥, but if it be in any sign or part where 1J. should be
most strong in power, then will the evil effects be nure abatctl
by 11is mild and benevolent influences therein.
But in mundane affairs, or'th~ affairs of the world iii general·,
the conjunction of I, and 1J. denotes many commotions wari!:
troubles, seditions, subversions ofmonarchies, kingdoms, pr_
inci-
palities and states, alterations of laws, customs, prh·ilages and
rights in some parts, while in other places, it causes anxiety of
mind, fears, troubles, treason!!, lreacheries, and it also forcshewa
the death of Emperori!, Kings, Nabobs, Princes, Nobles, and
Grandees, in divers parts of the world, in some regions it shewa
plagues, famine, desolation, and trouble ofvarious descriptions,
such ns great drought, making the ground in some places barren,
thereby cau!ling great scarcity of provisions, or the produce of
the Earth, followed by famine and pestilence, ifsuch meeting of
'hose superiorPlanets be in the Firey, Earthy, or·Airy triplicity,

such calamities, as will ariae from inundation, or a super·
.abundance ofWaters, Storms, Tempestious wheather, by Land,
or:Shipwrecks by Storms at Sea, these will be the effects if J,
rules theplace ofconjunction, either by house, triplicity, tenn or
phase, if1J. has no dignity therein, but especially if both shouli
be weak at the same time.
But if 1J. have dignities, and should be strong anti powerful in
such place ofmeeting ofthose Planets, then will.auch alterations
oflaws, customs and privilages, both in the Spiritual and Tem•
poral Governments, meaning clmrch and state (in divers places}
.the purging or purifying the same, by redressing such abuses as
shall be crep inte either by evil minded men, who have had the
power to act, and thereby both rulers and subjects will be made
happy, and firmly united to each other, for the benefit ofali.
If t be in conjunction with ~ in the sign !!ii, then will be all
kind ofWars, l>evastations, Tumults, lnsurections, Rapine and
Murders ofall descriptions that can be devised, will be put into
practice in difi'er1?nt parts of the world, eapeciallv in the uncivi-
lized parts, but if1J. be conjoined with them, then he will miti·
gate the evil effects in a great measure.
The conjunction of 1J. and t will denote many accidents, to
befu.ll the native, if it be in his ascendant or 6rat house, if neither
bas any dignities therein, but if 1J. ha.ci the superiority, then it
gives courage and valour, if~ then it abates the courage, gives
them a serious inclination to justice and mercy, and whatever
they !!hall set about will be prosperous therein, in the &econd
house, gains of substance-if')/. rules, if t rules, some gain, but
many impediments will arise, if both be weak then loss of snb·
stance follows, and in like manner in all other houses, according
to whatever such hpuse signifies, similar to what has been ex·
plained in the effects of~ and 1J., only in a smaller degree.
