During his retirement he carried out experiments appearing to show that psychic energy can directly influence chemical and biological systems.&nbsp;   Contents   	Career 	Imprinting Intention  	Water 	Fly Larvae 	Buddhist Relics   	Books 	Endnotes     Career

William Tiller was born in Toronto, Canada in September 1929. &nbsp;He gained a BSc in engineering physics in 1952 from the University of Toronto, followed by an MSc and PhD from the same university in 1953 and 1955 respectively. He was employed for nine years at Westinghouse Research Laboratories (the scientific arm of Westinghouse Electric Corporation in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania) where he built a world-class research group investigating the behaviour of cooled materials. He then accepted a full professorship appointment (something unprecedented at the time) in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at Stanford University, a position he held until 1992.

During his retirement he pursued a long-standing interest in the deeper connections between consciousness and reality. He published several books and more than a hundred scientific papers, and established a foundation to promote research and collaboration between psychoenergetics researchers and their organizations.  Imprinting Intention

From the late 1990s to mid-2000s, Tiller and colleagues developed a novel research program investigating the effect of stored mental intention on chemical and biological processes. Tiller arranged for small groups of meditators to try to transmit specific intentions to small physical devices that would show up in a later experiment. This was&nbsp;an electronic circuit designed to produce random voltage spikes; the noise was influenced or 'imprinted' by human intention and stored in the memory of the device.&nbsp;Research on these intention imprinted electronic devices (IIED), as they were termed, is described in several publications, indicating highly significant (p &lt; 0.001) effects on fly larvae development, pH oscillations in water samples, liver enzyme function, insect metabolism and other target systems.1 Some examples follow.  Water

In 1999 Tiller and Dibble reported exploratory experiments conducted on commercial bottled water, testing the effect of imprinted intention on pH levels (a measure of alkalinity/acidity). Testing at Stanford University found that pH fell by over 0.25 units more for samples exposed to imprinted devices compared to control (non-imprinted) devices.2

Later research conducted at Minnesota University by Tiller and several independent researchers explored the idea of ‘conditioned spaces’ by leaving an imprinted device in the same location for three months. Acidity changes in conditioned spaces were compared to nearby controls, with very significant differences observed (p = 0.001).3 Interestingly, conditioned and control samples began to display similar variations in acidity levels, even after a year.4

Five years later, Tiller and Dibble, collaborating with two other researchers, replicated and extended the imprinted device effect on acidity profiles and found hitherto undiscovered influences on reaction kinetics, suggesting new mechanisms of action.5  Fly Larvae

Working with Michael Kohane, Tiller probed the interplay of electromagnetic fields and imprinted intention on the growth and metabolism of 10,000 fly larvae of the genus Drosophila Melanogaster. Results showed that electromagnetic shielding reduced larval development time by 10% and increased metabolism by 30%, indicating an inhibiting effect of specific EM frequencies. Groups of larvae placed next to imprinted devices and exposed to EM fields gave growth and metabolism rates intermittent between EM exposed and non-exposed groups, suggesting a partial protective effect from intention.6  Buddhist Relics

In a study reported in 2012, Tiller and Dibble reported an extension of the basic imprinted device protocol. Unimprinted intention devices were placed in the vicinity of Maitreya Buddhist relics for about 72 hours (three nights), with the aim of imprinting the device with the Buddha’s loving kindness essence. The imprinted device was then placed in an unconditioned room in the presence of a water vessel (pH ~ 5.6) that was continuously monitored via a pH-sensor system. After about three months, four individuals in a deep meditative state ‘asked’ the essence inside the device to manifest itself in a way that might be registered by the pH-sensor.

During the first three months, the pH changed minimally (less than 0.4 units). However, following the meditative instruction the pH eventually climbed by about 2.5 units – a very significant change (p &lt; 0.001). Tiller and Dibble concluded that it is possible   	to imprint from an already deified object to an unimprinted device 	to activate the area of a room from the newly imprinted device 	for individuals in deep meditation to release the positive intentions embedded in a device in order to influence external processes.7   Books

In Conscious Acts of Creation: The Emergence of a New Physics (2001), Tiller, Dibble and Kohane describe rigorous experimental protocols testing specific human intentions. Additionally, the book provides some theoretical speculations on the mechanisms involved.8

In Some Science Adventures with Real Magic (2005), Tiller, Dibble and Fandel make bold assertions based on accumulated findings with imprinted devices. The book describes a new energy in nature that mediates long-range information transfer and connects both regular space-time physics with psychoenergetic science.9
