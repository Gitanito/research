it&#39;s not magic
if you understand
this new science
it&#39;s actually completely understandable
and dr jaylen heineck who founded the
center for ufo studies and before that
was project blue books astronomer who
famously infamously
uh said that the the this wave of
sightings in in michigan was swamp gas
remember that guy
uh he&#39;s he later recanted that and then
fully said that these were obviously
real and that they were almost certainly
uh
extraterrestrial and then he qualified
it but they might be interdimensional
well let me clarify this this is one of
my pet peeves
i was at a meeting for with the board of
uh noetic sciences and god bless edgar
mitchell&#39;s soul he just passed away in
the past week or so and was a good
friend and and someone that i helped
bring along in this field
and there was a man presenting there
named jacques valet
and he says well
and the the nordic sciences board very
interested in this subject and and i s
and he said well they&#39;re not
i&#39;m not so sure they&#39;re they&#39;re
extraterrestrial but they&#39;re
interdimensional or trans-dimensional
those are synonyms
and i said um
hello
this thing
is actually inter-dimensional
and i&#39;ve been in laboratories where they
can put a resonant field frequency
around this dematerialize it teleport it
to another point or hold it in that
state for a week and then have it
re-materialize
so saying they&#39;re interdimensional isn&#39;t
an answer
if they&#39;re here and they&#39;ve gone beyond
the speed of light they are
a priori
are required to be
also
interdimensional or trans-dimensional so
they&#39;re both it&#39;s it&#39;s like asking
is this orange round
or is it a fruit
or is it the color orange and your
choice is one of those when of course
it&#39;s all three
you understand what i&#39;m saying
so
it&#39;s nice
so
i have my that&#39;s what i have first thing
every morning for orange
um so
i live on oranges that&#39;s how i bench
press 410 now
i do eat other things but so the
so this understanding
of
consciousness and actually what&#39;s folded
within us
is very ancient greece and know thyself
and to thine own self be true
if you truly know yourself
you know
the unbounded being the great being
because that&#39;s within although not your
individual ego but it&#39;s there shining
within all things
if you know that you understand every
realm whether it go from the angelic and
celestial to other worlds that are e.t
but there is a huge cosmological
indigestion that goes with this
because people lack discernment
sometimes and they lump everything
together
so someone may have an experience with
something that&#39;s from another dimension
let&#39;s say
to quote after life
like when i died
when i was 17 i don&#39;t know if does
everyone know that story
if not i&#39;ll go through it another time
and had this near-death experience
and it was amazing since i was raised as
a very devout
um
atheist
a very serious atheist or agnostic they
didn&#39;t believe anything um and i had
this experience and there are other
dimensions and i left my physical body
but i also left my so-called body of
light and i was just this point of
consciousness causality the so-called
causal body the thought body
and experienced the cosmos that way
beautiful
and then i realized that everything
everywhere i gazed and i went out into
space was pure consciousness
resonating
as whatever that object was a star
a light a planet
space itself
and it was beautiful unspeakably
beautiful
and then i realized that well this
experience was kind of tragic because i
would got so sick almost died but
i mean i came back here i am obviously
um
well allegedly
and what that taught me was that
actually that all of that was always
within me
it just took that experience to
introduce it to me
and so people often will ask me where
did you go and i said well on the one
hand i went here and here on the other
hand i didn&#39;t go anywhere all i did was
awaken to what was already folded within
the
structure
of my own conscious awareness to where
that drop
of your individuality merged and became
one with the ocean of the unbounded
and that&#39;s really all meditation is is
is
our practices
and there are many ways to get there
that in that allow you
to have the drop of your individuality
join in a very gentle and peaceful way
with the infinity of the vast ocean
of quiet pure conscious mind
and the more you practice it the more
you can go from individuality to
unbounded consciousness and then
eventually you remain unbounded
consciousness while you&#39;re also the
individuality walking and moving in the
world
that&#39;s called cosmic consciousness
that&#39;s the first higher state of
consciousness we&#39;ll go through all these
over the course of this weekend
eventually you can be in your physical
body
and experience not only that state but
then the ability to have celestial
perception and the dawning of all the
so-called vedic cities
the ancient
s-i-d-d-h-i-s cities from ancient
vedic and other ancient traditions
native american
ancient egyptian
gnostic christian i mean it&#39;s everywhere
where you then have the ability to not
only perceive the fine essence of things
intuitively but also directly
you hear pure-hearted children who
really do see the kind of aura and light
around and within flowers and plants and
what have you or have this connection
with animals or with others when i was a
child i was so excited about the idea of
flying because i always had lucid
dreaming flying durian everyone had a
lucid dreaming where you&#39;re flying full
color how many people have had a
full-colored lucid dress almost everyone
you&#39;re actually
in that state
traveling
in your body of light conscious body of
light that&#39;s what the that is
and
so i had that a lot when i was a child
then i thought i want to be able to do
that in my body and one time i was so
excited that i i levitated from
one chair to a couch in my living room i
was maybe
four or five or six years old and it was
very exciting
i didn&#39;t know quite how i did it i think
it was just a state of joy and bliss and
energy and i just did it
and that was that was the beginning of
me realizing wow you know there are all
these abilities we have so these
so-called cities
which are spelled
s-i-d-d-h-i-s which are abilities
powers
that are that&#39;s within every human being
also
so a short list of them are
levitation materialization
dematerialization
teleportation by location trilocation
the ability to go into deep
consciousness and obtain knowledge
one item at a time and eventually many
items it&#39;s a level called the ritambara
pragya we&#39;ll get into what ritambara
pragya is
and so
it goes and there&#39;s really no limit to
this and you&#39;ve heard of many of these
and they they&#39;ve been dismissed as sort
of mythological
or
you know sort of allegorical they&#39;re not
they&#39;re literal
and those begin to unfold
as you experience this deeper state of
consciousness on a regular basis
and so it goes so there are all these
levels of consciousness that begin to
unfold
that are that are deeper or higher
depending on you want to look at it but
it&#39;s all based on the simple experience
of the quiet state of mind becoming
centered and calm
and
in that unb that calmness and quiet mind
beginning to be aware of what
consciousness is and becoming then just
consciousness
and i&#39;m talking about what you are
conscious of this is again materialism
and reductionism i&#39;m talking the the
unitive state of the experience of just
pure quiet consciousness
the space between the perceptions and
thoughts the background so everyone you
know all of you are hearing me right now
so just
for a moment think about the fact that
you&#39;re awake
and then reflect deeply on what that is
you&#39;re awake and she&#39;s awake
and he&#39;s awake
and that awareness is a singularity
your individualities are unique your
thoughts are unique your perceptions may
be unique in how you process them but
that whereby you are conscious
is a singularity
and therefore we really are
while once
separate we think of it an individual we
are simultaneously always
a singularity
and if you begin to experience that in
your daily life and and not only just
intellectualize it but experience it
what&#39;s beautiful is that at that point
you are really ready to be an ambassador
to these other civilizations because it
doesn&#39;t matter if the the et
is
like that atacama humanoid the adults
are about a foot tall
and you know people oh my god what is
that or
30 feet tall
or 12 feet tall
or look like
you know monkeys with hair on their
heads like we do
or have no hair
or have flesh or an exoskeleton
or have all the external things that
would freak you out
because it&#39;s so different from how we
look
become
an external
an an unimportant
it&#39;s fascinating and it&#39;s beautiful the
diversity but what you&#39;re really
anchored in is that they&#39;re awake and
we&#39;re awake and there&#39;s this
transcendent level of connection
that goes beyond
all separation
that&#39;s the beginning of being able to
function
as a
ambassador to these civilizations
you know in in our planet
if you want to be ambassador to france
it&#39;s because you gave a couple million
dollars to the republican national
committee or the democratic national
committee or something
in these other civilizations
which have attained
levels of development where they&#39;re
interstellar and where there&#39;s no
shortage of anything it&#39;s from an
abundance we&#39;ll talk about this and how
that alters the evolutionary path of the
species
they are liberated from slavery at that
point
punchline everyone on planet earth is
basically a slave of a relatively small
number of people who who are running the
plantation known as their earth into the
ground so it&#39;s time for us to get uppity
and throw off the shackles of our
slavery because i don&#39;t care what your
color or where you&#39;re from you&#39;ve been
enslaved
by the way it doesn&#39;t have to be
anything violent it&#39;s just saying no
we&#39;re going to do this
because if we go forward we&#39;ll just
leave them behind they&#39;re they only have
the power these folks in these very
powerful positions have the power
because we gave it up to them
and we give it up to them every single
day of our lives
so we take it back that&#39;s all
yep it&#39;s time it&#39;s way past time
so if you have this understanding in
your consciousness then these
civilizations really become
uh not alien
but they are
other
kind of almost like fractal
infinite diversity
manifestations of this quantum hologram
of conscious intelligent beings that is
actually familiar to each of us by are
having gone within
so if you want to be
an ambassador
to other
worlds into outer space you need to
first become a true master of your own
inner space
and that&#39;s really what this weekend is
all about
that&#39;s what i want to share
and give you the techniques and the
knowledge so that you can each do this
on your own so that if i&#39;m don&#39;t exist
at all
you have that ability
and
oh
thank you
so i think this is this is where we&#39;re
wanting to go
and
if you understand
some of what i&#39;ve just shared you&#39;ll be
able to then understand what we&#39;re going
to do tonight
because what we&#39;re going to do tonight
is i&#39;m going to first after we take a
break at about 9 30 and stretch and get
something and be sure we&#39;re all awake
i&#39;m never tired until 2 or 3 in the
morning so i if those of you who you
know are mourning people i do apologize
but
you can we&#39;re not babies you can be
awake till 11 right
um
okay
um
i know i&#39;m an emergency doctor so you
know you go all night in my training
we&#39;d have to work 36 hours non-stop and
if you couldn&#39;t do it they&#39;d just kick
you and say wake up anyway
it&#39;s a kinder and gentler world now in
medicine believe it or not than it was
30 some years ago but
we&#39;re
if you understand this
this central concept
which has been demonstrated in so many
elegant ways in physics
and actually one of the most beautiful
ways is being demonstrated right now
i&#39;ve just spent uh quite a few hours
with a gentleman a beautiful soul
beautiful soul named adam curry who has
worked with dr john at
princeton and has developed a beautiful
amazing technology
that we hope to show you tomorrow some
of it where you can think to
this lamp that&#39;s hooked to a random
number generator type sensor system and
want it to turn blue it turns blue turn
red turns red
um and he did an experiment in san
francisco where he put these you know
big thousand pound cones out and just
didn&#39;t tell anyone what they were and it
just said just think of color they just
had a sign think so if people just think
of color and they would go to that color
it&#39;s a 90
concurrence
this amazing work that that that adam
adam is doing adam curry and the people
working with him
and
it&#39;s just another demonstration of what
was has been demonstrated for a hundred
years in various ways but in a much more
modern and elegant way
and in fact an app is being developed
that will allow people to do that that
we would love to incorporate into the
cse contact app to help train
ambassadors does that make sense yeah
it&#39;s beautiful so
there&#39;s so many things like this
happening
and we need to understand that this is
all possible because our conscious mind
isn&#39;t separate from anything and we do
affect one another we affect the planet
and we affect other stars
so the operating system
i call it the universal communicator
is this
unbounded quiet state of consciousness
this non-local mind but don&#39;t think you
have to have some super flashy ultra
mystical thing to do it these were
ordinary people walking on the street of
san francisco a sign said think whatever
color you&#39;d like they&#39;d do so and the
thing would turn that color they weren&#39;t
people who had just come out of an
ashram where they laid on a bed of nails
for 90 years so
the point is is that this is the nature
of your own mind and thought
it is innate
it is your birthright own it use it
enjoy it experiment with it have fun
with it so that&#39;s what this is about the
techniques i&#39;m going to share
are ones that help you
develop that power of consciousness the
accuracy of it in remote viewing so as
you can see remote places and i saw you
know something beyond the simplicity of
say a random number generator or a lamp
being able to interface and communicate
with other higher intelligence species
that are not human
and that&#39;s that&#39;s an order of magnitude
beyond
just switching the color on a lamp or
doing a random number generator because
now you&#39;re not dealing with an inanimate
object you&#39;re dealing with another
culture another person you see what i&#39;m
saying so but but those those techniques
will help you have the the
confidence and the understanding that
this is your ability that&#39;s always there
you&#39;re not having to sort of
find something
that you don&#39;t already have you already
own it and since you already own it you
can do it
the main reason people don&#39;t do more is
because they don&#39;t believe they can
as the old saying as you have faith so
shall your powers and blessings be
or if you have the faith of a mustard
seed
all these things come from this
understanding you have to have
a by faith i don&#39;t mean belief in
something that may or may not be true
it&#39;s
an affirmative
positive
assumption about what is possible
so that you affirm it can be
and really all of you in your lives do
this all the time i mean if you&#39;re an
airline pilot and you&#39;re wanting to land
the jet on the runway you have to
believe you can put that thing down
if i have to do a chest tube into
someone who&#39;s just got
run over by a bus
and they&#39;re bleeding into the thoracic
cavity
i have to believe i can do that
so or whatever it is you&#39;re doing
so whatever it is you&#39;re doing in your
life you have to believe you can do it
you have to believe you can navigate
your car down the the tin freeway
which is quite an act of of of
of of accomplishment really when you
think about it my god
um
it&#39;s much more difficult
to drive down any of our freeways than
it would be to go interstellar
because there&#39;s no traffic jams
transdimensionally
there aren&#39;t
see life gets simpler
the more advanced the civilization
the reason our life is so complex is
because we&#39;ve been we&#39;ve been behaving
like a bunch of dumb monkeys so
when you become more intelligent things
become simpler and when the technology
is truly elegant and advanced it is
simpler
hello
is somebody&#39;s fun or is i don&#39;t know
what that is
so
we want to be able to pull together
uh all this understanding into an
operating paradigm so that everyone
listening
can go from where we are now
to going out under the stars or even if
it&#39;s bad weather sitting with a few
people in your house
go into these states remote view
civilizations make contact and ask them
to interface with us
and they can interface in a million
different ways a part of what&#39;s going to
be tomorrow night
is going to be a really drilling down on
all the strange things what dr jayana
heineck called high strangeness
that our c-seti ambassador teams have
experienced and how they happen and how
to interpret them
i mean for example
this was just a
rose quartz sphere that a guy at nasa
gave to me
and a few years back we were up in
joshua tree national park
and we had one of these
it was a radar detector actually that
picks up radar
and uh
we were doing our deep meditation in a
circle
and we went with the protocol is as
follows you
first you center into deep quiet
meditation
then after you&#39;re in that quiet calm
state which can take you 10 minutes or
10 nanoseconds if you&#39;re very
experienced
you then connect to that unbounded
component of mind and begin to remote
view the area around you
space around the earth our solar system
our galaxy all the way out and if you
lock onto
and perceive or sense an
extraterrestrial civilization you
connect to them and with humility and as
an ambassador
invite them
to come
to wherever you are
and at that point you do something
called coherent thought sequencing
because you&#39;ve now had a remote view and
locked onto the craft and you show them
where you that you are
and you then show them from wherever
you&#39;re sensing they are
you show them our solar system the earth
north america the west coast the high
desert palm springs desert hot springs
right here resume
but it from the deeper level of
consciousness and the thought is very
coherent and clear
we also use lasers and electronic tones
in case our minds aren&#39;t too sharp
in case we&#39;re a little bit off on our
cosmic gps
so that they get that
and then we just stay in a state of
welcoming
now most people want the mother ship to
land and materialize and go on board
like a steven spielberg movie and that
we&#39;ve had experiences where they&#39;ve
materialized like that
but most of the time it&#39;s something
stranger
so in this one case i&#39;m going to give
you
we had a series of amazing sightings
that you&#39;ll see some images of them
and up near the orion
sector near the sirius
and orion
were
a group
of what i call cosmic flash bulbs just
objects that turn on and turn off and
there was one and then two and
eventually there were a dozen of them
way up
and i was holding this crystal
like this and i was connecting with my
consciousness
in sort of a certain
position in my body to align my
consciousness and bioelectric field and
this crystalline structure with their
spacecraft and at that point out of my
left palm
and
coming in to my right with and this
crystalline object were a series of
pulses that eventually lasted 23 minutes
that downloaded through the radar
detector that we that we recorded that
were sounds that the radar detector
won&#39;t make if you put it next to a
police car or something like that
very anomalous
and it was a electronic transdimensional
extraterrestrial communication sequence
witnessed by 40 people that we have on
audiotape which i later translated
that&#39;s at the last chapter of the fourth
book i wrote called extraterrestrial
contact
countdown to transformation
and what&#39;s fascinating about that
experience is that this thing this
crystalline
object
had encoded within it
trans-dimensionally
information about this planet and its
relationship with other civilizations
going forward
for about 500 000 years
and it was so strange that i put it i&#39;d
put my hand out like this
after this happened my entire neural
circuitry was almost burned out
i mean i was barely able to i mean it
was like wow so it was amazing i wanted
to just de-materialize
it was and people were wow this is
amazing what&#39;s going on and all this
activity we&#39;re filming up in space
you&#39;ll see it
and at the end of it i went around to
each person and i would put their this
in their hand someone come up here and
i&#39;ll show you
and um don&#39;t be shy i don&#39;t bite
i put it in their hand and i would put
my palm over their hand like this
and everyone we&#39;re out in the middle of
joshua tree national park there was all
this spark and it was like a van der
graaf generation but in sort of this
beautiful light that everyone could see
coming out of our hands and i went
around the circle and did this with
everyone
and it was a trans-dimensional
conveyance of that energy
i was so completely blown away by the
time i got back down we were stay at
that time we were staying in palm
springs and had a 45-minute drive each
way to get out to this site
and i put this
in a bowl
and i just put it in there and it was so
charged with energy still this cosmic
interstellar trans-dimensional e.t
energy that it started spinning around
the bowl and hopping
and finally i slammed something down i
said stop it&#39;s all i can take i&#39;m ready
to go to bed otherwise then it&#39;s four in
the morning
so
now people go wow that&#39;s not what i
thought it would be from the mufon
journal
or the
but
it was very intimate
very conscious very present in a way to
many people very abstract but very very
intimate
so i&#39;m going to describe i mean it goes
all the way from objects that
materialize and interact beings that
float and get photographed outside our
circle to electromagnetic signals to all
manner of things
and all of it is based on the reason it
happens and the reason there are now
thousands of people all over the world
who have set up teams who&#39;ve had various
aspects of this happen
i&#39;m sure a lot of you here have
is because of the nature of the
conscious mind
and the fact that these civilizations
are eager to connect
not with necessarily the richest people
on earth or the politicians
or the powerful
but the pure-hearted
regular folks but who are at least
willing to go into their reality a baby
step
you may not be able to go into their
reality all the way
but at least a baby step into their
reality
and baby step i mean the experience of
the pure quiet state of mind the state
of innocence
and the willingness to be a
ambassador to these civilizations
without prejudice now
what do i mean by without prejudice
i remember some years ago
i was up in new york and it was when i
was sort of
mentoring lawrence rockefeller on a lot
of this and he was setting up things for
the clintons and
um it was after i&#39;d briefed the director
of the cia on all this this
information um and i was at a
salon up in uh which is sort of
gathering
of people at a place in new york and
there were a lot of very
well-connected folks
at this
place on park avenue and my wife and i
went and there were a lot of interesting
people there the wife of the secretary
general uh
leah golly buttress butcher scalli&#39;s
wife and all these folks were there
and there was a woman who who stood up
and i was trying to share a lot of these
concepts
about
the need for us because i mean the
secretary general the u.n was interested
about our need to go beyond a
materialist linear view
of diplomacy
and understand what a interstellar what
an interstellar diplomat
is required to possess
and at the end of it there was a woman
who said well
i have read
26 books on ufos and abductions and
mutilations and this and that and i let
her go on for a few months i said well
madam with all due respect
you&#39;ve just taken into your
consciousness 26 times more rubbish than
someone who&#39;s only read one book
and what
the reason i tell that story is because
the the literature on this field is so
polluted with misunderstanding and fear
and fear is the mind killer it&#39;s the
spirit killer it&#39;s the heart killer it&#39;s
the opposite of love
and love if you look at it the highest
manifestation of love that transcends
sentimentality
love ultimately is that magnetic force
in the cosmos that hold brings things
together as one
and if you love someone you want to be
one with that person right
whereas separation is the opposite of
love
and so fear leads to separation
love
leads to oneness or unity or to the all
and so people have to understand
that our movies our video games our
books our conferences have been
populated
with
frightening ideas and images
that were launched in the 1950s by the
c.i.a
and have caught like wildfire because of
the proclivities of humans to be afraid
of something different from themselves
and that fear
and anger and mythology has built up to
such a point that even when i speak to
elementary school children the one the
first questions they ask aren&#39;t you
afraid to go out and make contact
because don&#39;t you think they might
attack you or abduct you or mutilate you
children six-year-olds
so
the brainwashing
couldn&#39;t have been done or done better
by adolf hitler&#39;s henchmen
the brainwashing is virtually complete
and so it&#39;s a little bit like that in
vogue free your mind you know that&#39;s i
love that i love that that song free
your mind
though you have to free your mind
from the web
of disinformation misinformation
mythology fear and what have you and
most importantly of this sort of manikin
view of it&#39;s us and them or is good
aliens versus the bad aliens
well you know what here&#39;s the deal
you can&#39;t prove a negative
it&#39;s axiomatic
however if there is a civilization out
there that is interfacing with earth or
near earth
that is a threat to humans those are the
ones a sincere diplomat would want to
have a raw pearl schmoll
in contact with first
those would be i&#39;m not saying that
exists but if it did i&#39;m quite certain
it doesn&#39;t but if it did to those who
are addicted to the paradigm of war and
conflict and you know it&#39;s ironic that
the the kind of new age community has
been totally take over right so there&#39;s
nothing more old age
than the paradigm of us versus them and
star wars
which is what the brainwashings is all
about
the brainwashing is about
laying the foundation for people to
accept the cost and blood and treasure
of an eschatological end times battle
that&#39;s interstellar
and that was launched in the 50s that&#39;s
the battle eisenhower lost
we&#39;ll get into this more this weekend
the point of the matter is be very
careful with that because if you harbor
those concepts
and those fears
and those prejudices
these civilizations won&#39;t come anywhere
near
and the reason for it is that they
really aren&#39;t interested in interacting
with racists
the race it&#39;s racism
in our culture
we have
we call racism is between one ethnic
group and another but if you&#39;re talking
about interplanetary racism
it&#39;s the racism of
these
civilizations and notice in sort of the
ufo and new age literature they&#39;re
always kind of blonde white nordic
looking
and the ones that look different are the
bad ones
doesn&#39;t this sound like racism to you
it does to me
and so
we&#39;re dealing with a problem here
and the problem is deep and i want to
talk about the
uh
biological
and conscious roots of racism for a
moment
it has gotten this very well established
that primates um particularly chimps
that we&#39;re most related to
have a proclivity to
join each other in
troops and what have you and then engage
in organized warfare against another
troop or tribe that is different or a
threat to territory or what have you and
murder does get committed
and murder being in this case uh champ
killing another chimp
and
interestingly we&#39;re 98 identical with
chimpanzees
so there&#39;s a
very primitive
atavistic
genetic biological
trigger
that can be exploited by demagogues
that is within the human
reality
the physical human reality to cause one
race to hate another one religion to
hate another one sex to hate another one
orientation to hate another whatever it
is all the things that people fight
about in our political systems
and in the world today
because it serves
those who want to have endless war
continue
have a divide and conquer mentality
and maintain control
it&#39;s all about control
