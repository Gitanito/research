T H E ^vorld at large has raised a variety o f false
reports, and drawn many wrong judgments, Con­
cerning the publications of Joanna Soutnc’dt£ So/rie
have gone so far as to say, that they aYe the Works
o f men with her signature put to them.' Others
have affirmed, that their contents are made ’ up of
falsehoods, and not truth. * Again, afoohg a va­
riety of the like tales, it has lately been'’boldly as­
serted, “ that she make$ a scribbling on some papers,
and delivers them to some of her followers, and
then, When any remarkable occurrence Happened in
the world, from her being possessed'of a great d e ­
gree of head knowledge, with a retentive meVnojy,
she has occasionally gone to these papers And pretend­
ed to read what has happened, in the saffie manner^s
if it had been in them ; and then it'is? added, that
there is a person writes down what she pretends to
read, arid then it is published This erroneous and
false assertion has even been put in print against her.
But all these things being known to the Lord,?be­
fore Joanna could have any notice of them ; she
therefore sees his unbounded wisdom, fri orderihg
that every truth should be tried and regularly proved
by the testimony of credible witnesses; ' '
' And in order to ascertain the truth or falsity of
her writings, all ranks of men have been invitdtj, by
a variety of applications, to come forward "to exa­
mine fairly into them. The biffiops, and clergy!in
general, were particularly invited to search irito
the$ matters; and she then expressed her willingness^

INTRODUCTION.
On every truth being lad before any twenty-four
whim they, might appointfrom among themselves, that
i f they could prove the calling to be from the De-
jyil, she then would consent for every thing to be
(givenup to their judgment, as may be seen in “ Let­
ters on various Subjects, from Joanna Southcott to
Miss Townley, published ih June, 1 8 0 4 but they
declined coming forward to judge the cause.
After this it was offered to be given up to the
judgment of the Rev. M r. Pomeroy, in lik« manner,
if he could bring twenty-four to prove her calling
from an evil Spirit; for she had written private let­
ters to her friends, to insinuate to them that she had
published falsehoods against him. But her friends
being above deceit, they sent her his letters, which
she put in print, at the same time offering to give up
ill to him, if he Came forward and proved his asser- -
■
tions, as the reader may see more fully in her “ Ex­
planations of the Bible,” Part I. p. 44, published to­
wards the end ofthe same year; but well knowing that
"he could not do so, he likewise refused to attend to
her invitation to do justice to her character.
And to shew the reader the last steps which were
taken, respecting that gentleman, previous to her
STrial, the following particulars are inserted:
DIRECTIONS FROM THE SPIRIT.
Wednesday, Not. 23, 1804.
“ Now, Joanna, I shall give thee directions. Know
all men, my Gospel was penned by my disciples;
tny friends and followers bore record of the truth:
for what truth could come from my enemies ? Now
I tell thee, it is my friends and believers that must
bear record of evety truth the same. Now, as the
days of thy departure draw near, I have ordered
thee to call all thy witnesses and friends together, to
make every truth clear before them, and to convince
khe unbelieving world, they have not built their
‘ faith on a tandy foundatipn ; they haye notlistened
Digitized by b o o g i e
anj cunningly devised fables; they have not taken
thy bare word and record; but havefaithfully
.searched into every truth. The witnesses iriust- bfc
called and their evidence given in and"penned, as
though it was a thing#
on life and death. All miTSt
be penned, and all particulars looked into, to prove
•to the world there is no deceit in thee or thy friends.
For I now tell thee, if thy friends believe every truth
thou hast told them, without bringing forward every
evidence to prove it, the world will not; for clear
proofs must be made manifest, to prove a thing to
an unbelieving world, M y disciples penned in what
a public manner my miracles were wrought, arid in
what a public manner I appeared to them after my
-decease; and in what manner I arose again; but
could this be done by the keepers, who were bribed
to conceal the truth * ? I tell thee, N o ; so let the
unbelieving world say the truth of all is proved by
thy.:friends and believers : for the truth of my Gos­
pel was penned the same, and the truth of my Bible
was penned the; same. Now let the world be con­
vinced from Pomeroy, what truth can you know
from him ? Does he not use every art to conceal
the truth, as much as the-keepers did to conceal the
truth of my resurrection } Then know, vain man,
no truth can come from an enemy. See tny Gos- '
p e l; see my Bible ; see how Jehoiakitn went to con­
ceal and destroy the words of Jeremiah; and see
through my Bible how it was penned by the pro­
phets, and made public by those who believed.
But was ever my Bible affirmed by an enemy ? Let
reason take possession of every heart; and now see
from Pomeroy’s conduct,, how he would sooner lose
his own honour, and bear the scandalous reproach o f
the whole world, than come forward to acknowledge
the truth. Now let this be a convincing proof to all
men, that truth cannot be made known by an ene­
my ; truth must be made known by a believer, who ’
will not blind his own eyes, 'nor the eyes of others^

b u tw ill dojustice towards God and mail, which the
enetnies of my Cross never would do; neither will
the enemies o f my Crown do it now: for where Sa­
tan hath the advantage over men, to fill them up
iWith unbelief, he will have the advantage to work
in them deceit. Now let the world see from Pome­
roy, and thy friends, where ,the art and deceit lie ;
who is ready to come forward with every truth but
-the believers ? and who is ready to keep back the
.truth and deny -it but an unbeliever ? This was
done at my first coming, and this is done at my se­
cond coming. Now let all men judge for them­
selves ; for I -shall go on to make every taring clear
to men of reason and to men of sense.
“ Now I shall answer thee: Pomeroy hath done
'like the Jews of old; he hath concealed the truth,
and will not appear to own the truth; then go out
into the highways and hedges and compel, them to
come in. Let the.witnesses’ words be taken; and
let any opposers come that .will come, that have not
relumed the letters; or, let the halting Jacobs ap­
pear, that are now halting between two opinions;
let them come forward to the number that is men­
tioned.
“ Now I shall come to Pomeroy’s words: he saith
let fhe truth be tried, but leave him out of the ques­
tion. Now let Pomeroy answer m e , which way the
truth is to be tried to leave him out of the question ?
Is not that a thing impossible ? In thy heart thou
sayest, Yes, it is a thing impossible ; then I answer^
he will find it in the end as much impossible for him
to regain his lost honour : for bis name must ever
stand with die name of the keepers that were bribed
to conceal the truth. So whether he will hear, or
whether he will, forbear, write thou the words unto
'him this day, and tell him to call to his remembrance,

T ill all my threatened judgments come upon him*
Now tell him, for his sake I have deferred thy Trial
to the last day ; for seven days before November is
out, by the Old Stile, thy Trial must begin; and if
h'e is] not present then,- or sends no friends to appeal?
in his behalf, he must trust to the judgment of them
that are present; but as to his conduct, from first to
last, it will all go in print with the witnesses’ names;
and let him know what an impossibility he hath rt*
quired; and th'e letter thou sendest him must go in
print.”
Here follotfrs a copy oT the te tter:.
R ev. Sib, London, Nov. 28, 1804.
In your letter to the Rev. Mr. Foley, you write
desiring to have the truth of my writings cleared up,
and tried by the test of Scripture, but leaving your
name out of the question; then what truth can be
cleared up ? W hat ah impossibility do you require ?
W hat sense and nonsense have you blended toge­
ther ? Doth not your own handwriting prove your
tenses niore deranged than mint ? You say, it ihti&
be tried by the test of Scripture truth, and by that,
let it stand or fall. Now, Sir, if we leave out the
truth of the Scriptures they must fell, and if I leave
out the truths that were put in your hands I must
fe ll; for what use was it of my putting events in
your hands, from 1796 to the 1801, if all these
things were to die arid never to be named ? Then
you might j udge I was led by a knaye or a fool; but
you will find in the end, I am not led by either; but
that the Devil hath completely drowned your senses.
Y et still the Lord is waiting to be gracious, if you
appear to clear up the truth at the eleventh hour;
therefore I m ust. call to your remembrance the
words I read to you in 1798, that by the daresbeiiK
different with God and man, it was aaid-^*

T ill heavier storms come upon the nation, Which
followed in the 1799 and the,1800. Now these ele­
ven days have been kept in store for you, that for
your sake my Trial is put off, to the last seven days
of November, by the Old Stile, so the mercies of
God endure to the end; but not one day longer will it -
be deferred. M y witnesses from Exeter are now in
London, and every truth concerning you, and me,
will be given in to the attorney, and all put in public
print. Now T must call to your remembrance the
letter I sent you—

the naked truth shall now appear. I am sorry to tell
you, that your conscience hath been bribed like thd
keepers, that when they s a w the angels appeared,
and the stone rolled away, and they fled for fear,
they were bribed to say the disciples stole him away
while they were asleep. Here, like you, they con­
tradict themselves, for what man could tell what wa*
done when they were asleep ? and what man can tell
which is right, you or me, if I leave your name out

acute than mine; for la m sorry tetell you, that

there is such sense and nonsense blended together
in your letters, that my senses are not so much de-
'ranged but I can discern the depth of the whole. I
■ do not, like you, boast of good sense, that the polite
world boast of, to drown common sense; but coih-
<mon sense teaches me reason and religion, that in
an affair like mine, justice, equity, and truth, must
take place, and none of the truth kept back. And
now I shall come to the purport of my letter: your
hidipg yourself •sheweth yourself guilty, and you
are your own murderer. M y Trial is prolonged oh
your, account, that you may have no excuse to plead;
but as I know conscious guilt keeps you back frorp
appearing ^mrself, you are at liberty to send any
friend you think proper, to appear in your behalf.
You know the last day is mentioned; my Trial can­
not be deferred longer than the last seven days ip.
November, by Old Stile; and if you appear you may
claim my promise in the letter that was sent you in
print, by the command of the Lord ; but if you do
not appear, you prove yourself guilty, and must say
as Adoriibezek did, as I have done to others, so the
Lord hath requited me. Now, Sir, I shall conclude
'with saying, this letter with all the others that have
been sent you, will be put in print, if you are absent;
and you must say, the judgments of God have now
overtaken you ; but I wish you to call reason to your
. assistance, before reason come too late. If I do not
-receive an answer by the return of post, your silence
’proves you would sooner have your character lost for
-ever, by your ill conduct, than acknowledge your
fault towards God and me, and clear your conscience^
that wherein you had done wrong to acknowledge
you would do so no more. One thing I must ob­
serve, in your letter to Mr. Foley, you say, after a
full and patient investigation into my writings, you
are of opinion they proceed from a deceived imagi­
nation or spiritual delusion ; then I must ask you,
why, Sir* after having' the writings a fortnight in

your hands, to pass your judgment thereon, before
they were put in print, that you delivered them into
my hands to put them in print, and said, you could
not blame me ? then why did you deceive me, and
not tell me your judgment then * ? So out of your
;©wn mouth, you have tried every way to deceive me,
and now in the end you are deceived yourself.
So, 1am, your much injured,
Joanna Southcott.
P. S. Please to direct to Mr. Sharp, No. 50,
Titchfield Street, Oxford Street, London.
When the Rev. Gentleman paid no attention to
this offer, the following directions wer% given:
“ G of into the highways and hedges and compel
them to come ip. Now they are at liberty to in­
vite any twenty-four they choose, to stand in their
Stead, that the house may be tilled with the appoint­
ed , njupiber that is mentioned; therefore, I ordered
■ m
y friends to come before the time, that the wit­
nesses might be examined, their evidence taken, and
All laid before the public. So opposers that wish to
be present let them be present, for the complete
mumber must be made up. I choose no man; but
let them be invited and come by their own choice;
and whether Pomeroy come or send, there shall not
be one turned back that cometh by invitation to make
up the twenty-four. I f they had not been warned
by. letters, had not been invited, had not been threat­
ened, they would have said, all was unjust, to call
forward all the witnesses to appear against them, if
they had not notice to answer for themselves; and the
world would have said, as was said at Stockton, that
, all was invented lies. Every truth shall be cleared
pp by evidence and by .witnesses, before thou goest
hepce to be no more seen; then where is the man
' who can contend with believers, when every truth is>
^proved and tried ? where are the clergy who can con-

demn them, When every offef hath beeh id freely
made them ?
No} I shall strike the rebel dead*
And make thy foes to fear.”
Or where hath Satan room to plead*
When justice is so clear ?
As Joanna’s enemies have been busy in spreading
false reports against h er; and all those who have
been invited to examine into the truth or falsity of
what she hath published, have also declined to inter­
fere. She was still ordered, however, to cbmie forward
and call her witnesses together, who caine from
'distant parts; and also the twenty-four persons who
had before judged her catling to be o f G o d ; and
they were to procure other twenty-four, who be­
lieved the Bible to be of divine authority, to join
them, for the purpose of examining every evi-
, nee regularly; and this was to be conducted bjr
an attorney, who was appointed to act in the strictest
and most impartial manner in the examination of the
withesses, during her absence ; and he was desired
to act in every thing, as though lie had been com­
missioned by his king and country, or by the bi­
shops and clergy, to act faithfully with God and mail.
In consequence of this arrangement, the twenty-
four, who had before judged the truth of Joanna’s
mission, endeavoured by every mean of persuasion
to' induce individuals, among the clergy and others,
to come forward to examine into her calling ; bur all
that were opposers, or unbelievers, of what she pub­
lished to the world, refused to listen to her friends.
Many of them added insult and abuse to their re­
fusal to search into the truth, as may be seen by the
different answers, as given by several of them to
the gentlemen who made the applications to them.
Being th’en commanded to go into the highways
and hedges, accordingly the Rev. M f. Webster
waited on three clergymen; these were, the Rev.

M r. Hodgkins, minister of St. Thomas’s, in the Bo­
rough, who declined attending, not caring to have
any thing to do with it; the Rev. Mr. Grose, curate
of St. Gabriel, Feiiehurch, who declined, fearing
his abilities were not sufficient for such an under­
taking ; and a third was the Rev. Mr. Draper, lec­
turer of St. George’s, in the Borough. He declared
his decided opinion, and believed that he spoke the
sentiments of the elergy at large, when he said, that
her writings were blasphemous ; and added, that he.
could see but one place where. $he was spoken of in
Scripture, and that was by the appellation of Jezebel;
for she was a Jezebel ,in the church ; and as to pro-,
phets and prophetesses, in the present day, he did
not believe,-that there were now any such characters;
though he,-must say thus much in her favour, this
was a proof of the near approach of the letter day;
for that we were taught previous to that period to
. look for false Christs and false prophets. She was
evidently an instrument in the hands of the enemy,
to collect together a number of people and promote
a rebellion against the government; and we should
not be allowed to meet at the time fixed on, for our
.assembling was known to them.
The reader will fix his attention to the fairness of
Joanna's intentions, in applying to the church' mi­
nisters, for them to examine into every thing ; for
•they are part of the government of England, and
ought to stand between the king and his people, to
prevent a Jeztbel from being imposed on them.
THE ABOVE REMARKS WERE THUS ANSWERED
< : , BY THE SPIRIT.
** Now, Joanna, I shall answer thee from these
three men. The first is what I said in the Revela­
tions, neither hot nor cold, but lukewarm ; there­
fore I will spue such out of my mouth ; for.no more
than thou canst digest thy meat, and that only one

“ And now I shall come to the second, whom I
call a prudent man, that boasts of his infirmities,
fearing of his wisdom to judge in so weighty a cause;
and here let the prudent men.keep silence ; whose
understanding is hid,, let them not think of them­
selves more highly than they ought to think, but
wait till they are clear in judging before they con- .
demn.” •
“ And now I shall come to the other, who said
thou wert the Jezebel. Out of his own mouth will I'
condemn him, for breaking the laws of God 'and
man-; the laws of his king, the laws o f his coun­
ts v ; and turning the laws of a civilized nation into
rebellion. Hast thou not appealed to thy king, and
to thy country, to have the laws of the nation*put in .

hast thou not promised to give up the whole f Then

judging before they condemn ? W hen they have re- -
fused to try thee by the laws of the country, I have
commanded thee to be tried by the laws of my Gos­
pel ; I have ordered thee to put every truth in their
hands ; I have ordained so many witnesses to copy
off thy books, that it may be plainly jiroved to the
world that there is no art nor deceit, in thee ; I or­
dered thy pen to be thrown aside in the end, that in
the mouth of two or three witnesses every word
might be established, and that without.books, or

Is it not written, be clear in judging before you con-j

another ? I'hou art no doer of the law but a judger:
but let him know the judge stands at the door, to
condemn him out of his own mouth, for breaking
, theJaws of God and man, arid bring the laws of
other nations into this kin gd om ; then like other
nations this kingdom must fall. He that is a traitor
to his God, is a traitor to his Country ; the laws o f
God command him to be clear in judging before he
condemn; the laws of your country command if
dear judgment, by judge and jury, before any cri­
minal is cast. Then how dare he sayj without the law*
of bis, country, he will take the law in hand without
acting according to the law ? Though the Jews un­
justly put me to death, yet they pretended to do it
by The kwy and gained false witnesses to prove it
was-done according to the law ; bitt now this man
Says they will put * stop without the law, when they
refused to appear according to justice, equity and

equity cannot enter ? Will men judge as blind men

they will see ? Will they judge without hearing, when
I have given them ears to hear if they will hear ? Now

Are they not blind leaders of the blind ? Do they not
judge of things they know nothing about themselves ?
and do they hot teach others to do the same ?
Where can they bring my Bible to justify them ?
Can .they deny my judgments just upon the land ?
Are not they the Jezebels themselves, who cover
with a covering, .but not of my Spirit, who deny the

The Rev. Mr. Foley, accompanied byM r. Scott,
the solicitor, waited’ upon the ttev.-Mr. Rstann, of
WhitechapeL. On his being asked, ifhadoold at­
tend Joanna’s Trial,' as an opposer, (for the Object
of it was to findout ifthere Wasianyspiritual delusion,
or whether ter calling was from the Spirit of the liv-‘
ingGod,) he said, that he had destroyed the letter
he had received, from Miss Townley to the clergy?
apd added» that there was no occasion for such an
examination, as she had described herself as the se­
cond Eve, and that there was nothing to warrant such
an assertion. The discourse then turned upon the
bruising of Satan’s head; and he said, that that waa.^
accomplished at the death of our Saviour. He then '
indignantly broke oft' with saying, that he Was sorry
Mr. Foley-was of the church, for he was no Chris­

<( Now I shall answer thee from Woodd. W hat
fltqfFis his religion ? where is bis love to God or
man ? Hath h e .not seen the thing, once -.proved al­
ready, by what ,one of his own brethren ‘said— there
Were three and twenty mad fools * ? and from his -
own words, he judges thetti the same; then where
is, Ids wi&cfom ? where is his religion,- not to- step/for­
ward,when invited, that he may point out the errors-,
to them,, and not let it go out in the world again,. by
three and twenty more mad fools t So out of his>
own mouth will I condemn him, as a blind man
without eyes ; for if he had eyes to see, or a heart to-,
understand, believing a thing gone out in the world
in m y nam e, that he believed I had not spoken in,.hiA
ought to come forward in -love to m b, to try. to -
convince those that are in errors; and if be-could
prove it not o f God, that he might be able to pub-
lish to the world against it, for .the glory of G o o
and the good of mankind. So here is his wisdom
perished, his understanding hid, his love for m q
gone. But he is boasting like Jehu^r-see my zeal
for the Lord of Hosts! while his eye is to his own
honour, that he might be exalted and worshipped
for Ms wisdom and preaching; but where is his wis­

~ Mr. Sharp jvaited on another clergyman of great
literary talents, who declared her to be a foolish, ig­
norant woman ; and by what he had read from her
books, he could not understand them ; and had no -
opinion of a Holy Spirit that could not write gram­
mar. . But he, further said, if he Tvas a younger man
he might come forward; and he added, that this
world would'always go on as it was; and by the
Death, of Clrrist we should be made happy hereafter.

After meeting with a general refusal among unbe­
lievers, the twenty-four, who at first came forward to
prove Joanna’s calling, were then obliged to get the
like number of friends to join with them s and many
of these were such as had come from distant parts o f
the kingdom to hear her Trial,, not knowing but it
might be carried on by the clergy. Thus, by tb$

refusal of the clergy and others, the other twenty-,
four friends, thus chosen, who came from different
parts of the country, obtained an additional opportu­
nity to examine the truth of her mission, by being
present as judges at her trial.
The following extract is an additionalexplanation hams
this Trialwas broughtfoiw ard:
*' Now pen how many men came, that wish to be
clear in every truth, and took their journeys to sec

The Rev. Mr. Eyre, from Bristol.

Mr. Hirst, from Leeds.
M r. Senior, from Leeds.

M r. Laskey, from Devonshire.
M f. C h a n t e r , from Devonshire,
Now, Joanna, I shall answer thee: Seven wise
men, from different countries, went first to Exeter,
to enquire into the truth; and now seven wise men
from different countries are come to see the truth
cleared up j so now thy seven stars are come to four­
teen ; and they may stand with the other twenty-
four ; their labour pf love shall not be in vain, I
have called the great, 1 have called the learned; but
my invitation-they have all refused ; and now I shall
come to the ample.and unlearned, to fulfil my Gos­
pel, that the pride of the great may fell, and be con­
founded b y the simple and foolish, that are sojudged
in their eyes: and he that speaketh against this judg­
ment speaketh against the truth of my Gospel, And
now remember what I said— I thank thee, Father,
that thou hast concealed these things from the wise
men, from the learned and prudent men, and revealed
them unto babes. Now the wise men have been
warned, and the learned, and the prudent, all have
been warned; the.wise men trusted to their wisdom,
fhe learned men trusted to their learning, and

prudent men trusted to their prudence, thinking, i f
they kept silence, all would die away, while the
simple and foolish men, as the worldly wise men
judged them, became as babes, or as little children,
teachable, willing to learn what they did not under­
stand : for the mystery of the Fall was never under­
stood by man; so they, like children, are come
teachable to learn what they never understood.
Now let them see how my Gospel was brought in by
poor men and fishermen', men unlearned in the
world; and by such my Kingdom will be brought
in : for now is coming the fulfilment of the whole;
the meek shall be exalted; the proud shall be abased;
and the meek shall inherit the earth. Now weigh
the whole with my Gospel: Are not many called ?
_Are there but few chosen ? Have not the wise and
learned men resigned their crowns to babes and
children ? For such they are judged by the bi­
shops ; but know, .such are judged by -my Gospel
to become as children to possess my Kingdom, or
how pould my Gospel be fulfilled ? How could the
wisdom of the wise rnen perish, if this was brought
forward by the wise and learned ? How could the
understanding of the prudent men be hid, if they
had understood all these things ; the mystery of the
F a ll; and the manner my Gospel must be fulfilled,
to bring in your redemption ?
Now, Joanna, speak the word,
Dost thou ray Promise claim*
That I haveleft upon record,
The Woman to redeem ?
Oh, my God ! with tears o f joy, with tears o f
thanksgiving, with tears of humiliation, if I am
how permitted, I claim the Promise, that Satan’s
head may now be bruised, and his curse be abovo
every living creature, who first seduced the Woman,
and by arts betrayed her to .fall from that happiness
thou created her for, and by his arts to disobey her.
God ; and by the same arts he hath been working in
rpen to this day, to be at enmity against their God.

O h, merciful Lord ! let that enemy be destroyed ac­

■Thefollowing extracts are inserted as beingfurther ex,-
flanaiory of Joanna's Mission and Trial.
Tuesday, Dec. 4, 1804.
A letter was received by Joanna from Mr. Wilson,
respecting of words spoken by a woman who is one
o f those that call themselves the elect, belonging to
Orange Street Chapel? where M r. Townshend
preaches— “ that the. friends of Joanna will give her
adose in order to put her to sleep and deceive the
public.”
These words provoked Joanna to the highest; snd
she said, if she had such wicked, deceitful, artful
people around her as that woman, she had not a
doubt but they would do it, and be her complete
murderers. If they were to mock God in this manner .
to deceive man, they Would soon deceive her, and
tnake her sleep the sleep of death : for if any onp
was to give her any thing to draw her to sleep, slip
is convinced they would close her eyes for ever, thajc
she should never awake more. So when she medir
tates on all the arts, deceit, -and lies, that are in un-
E 2 - " '

ixsevi YuTRonucTiotr.
•believers, she 'istruely convinced they are o f the
•D e v il; and from such wretches no truth could come.
Here is the answer of the Spirit given to Joanna.
“ Now, Joanna, I shall answer thee from this wo*
man. The language of her heart is the language of
thousands, that would say it, and would do i t ; and
Would affirm they had acted as she said : for as I told
thee before, I now tell thee again, nothing will con­
vince an unbelieving mind ; therefore it is written,
they perish through unbelief And now to convince
the world that all was open, fair, and just, I ordered
every letter to go out that have ; but I well knew
such unbelievers* that nothing would convince them :
they would say, like the woman, thou hast designedit ;
thou and thy friends had agreed, without reason, in &
thing that need not be mentioned, if it was from hen-
self, to say she shouldhe in a Trance at a ll; for then her
. writings would have as clearly been proved without it.
But as this is now the report of the world, and what I
*perfectly knew before, from the trial of men in past
ages, I permitted this thing to go out in the world,
to see what judgment men would draw. Now they
have drawn their judgm ent; and to prevent their
future judgment, no one shall know the time of thy
trance, no one shall know the manner of thy trance,
nor thou thyself shalt form any judgment how, or.
when, before I come upon thee unawares; for all my
Visitation to thee in this Trial shall be suddenly and
unexpectedly, like my visitation to thee at Bristol,
that I never warned thee o£ before it came,.that no
man might say thou appearest in the power of my
Spirit to fulfil thy prophecies ; and now I shall come
Upon thee unawares the same, in all the working o f
MY Sp ir it unknown to thee or. them. So they may
be like my disciples of old, expecting things to come
to their own judgment, in a different manner than I
appeared : but had I told them every particular, and
come perfectly like it, the world would hive said
they deceived them, to say I came as I told them
Digitized by Google
before j but when I come in a different manner to
them, in a way they never expected, and they them­
selves confessed it so, no man could say they did it
by deceit, when they themselves confessed they
were deceived. And perfectly so it will be by thy
T ria l: the day, the hour, the time, or the manner
o f my strong visitation to thee, during thy Trial, will
not be known till m y power appears. But I shall
make all things so clear to them, that they shall
never need of a Trial any more, to know from whence
thy visitation is ; but shall know it is 1 the L o r d
have spoken by thee. And now I shall tell thee,
though.I knew thee and proyed by thy witnesses that
no deceit is in thee, and called thee abroad in the
world' to prove it to others ; yet, as the unbelieving
Jews did not believe in m e, the unbelieving world
•will not believe in thee, if I. tell thee beforehand
■ every particular o f what w ill happen. But thou-say-
est in thy heart, were not the particulars of the days
foretold ? to this I answer, they were foretold, i f
proved by thy enemies \ but now thou knowest it i$
proved by thy friends : and if I act a different way,
jto shew the unbelieving world that it did not come
ns they expected, yet in a different manner and more
clear than they expected, let them not be disap- ,
pointed; for I tell thee, if all things come in a re- •
gular line without opposers, the world will say, there
is deceit in thee and thy friends. Therefore it is my
wisdom now to conceal from all in what manner I
-fihall clear up the truth, to make thy light break
forth as the morning, and the truth as clear as the
noonday sun ; and so clear shall the truth be now
made; for the water shall now be made wine : ancj
let them not grieve if the best wine is reserved for
the last.
Upon conditions all my Bible stands, *
” ,
And on conditions I have plac'd thyhand,
And on conditions you will see the end,
The way that I shall make the blind men ben<j»
That by the letters they have sentto thee,
They will ponfess they hadnoeyes to
H TTR O D bCTlO fU XXXVSl

So all theirvwds thou must with safety ieep,
To shew the blind men how their eyes were sunk
Deep in theirheads, where thou diast see the holes ;
. And full as blind they'll find theirnaked souls:
So in their stead their letters must appear.
Then what impostorcanst thou he to man ?
Let them discern andjudge thy written hand,
If an impostor would the whole reveal,
And from theirknowledge nothingwould conceal.— —
I know thy nature daily doth decay, .
And so your nation now Isay do lay $
They are decaying, as I said at first,
By dearth andburdens so upon them cast;
* And if by thy decaying thou dost fall,
By their decaying they may tremble all;
Because thy heart they have so wounded here,
AmTback on them will surely come the spear.
But now believers boldly they may stand,
And now my kingdom they may all command;
For if they live on earth they will it gain,
And if they die, with me they sure shall reign,
That now in heartand soul give up to me,
TTheir only wish my kingdom for tosee.---------
Let men begin from my Gospel and shew how
close every word is brought to my Gospel, of the
Parables I mentioned of the Kingdom of Heaven,
and that not one that were bidden should taste o f
my supper. They have been bidden to come for*
ward and search out the truth ; and as they have re­
fused, I have refused them ; and those of the high­
ways and hedges are compelled to come in. Now I
shall tell thee what is meant by the highways and
hedges : those that work in the highways, and those
that work by the hedges, are labourers; so let the
believers come in as labourers, that my house may
be filled ; and that my visitation may be made ma­
nifest ; for now I tell thee, by thy Master thou must
8tand or fall; and now thou art judged by men,
whose faith is like thine ; then by one Master you all
stand or fall.”
The following extracts are inserted to inform the reader
respecting the mission of Joanna ;
In Joanna’s sealed writings, written in the years
1796 and 1800, are found these wprds: “ I will
provoke them to anger and jealousy; but when
X XXviii IXTBODUCTIQKN
Digitized by L i o o g i e
in tr o d u c tio n . xxxix
this jealousy alarms the unbelievers, and they have
not judgment enough of their own, to know from
whence the writings come, but wish to be clear
themselves, if they will call forward the Trial, as the
Lord hath done, to see if every thing be true, as it
is put in print, andr by their unbelief cannot be clear,
from whence it came, when friends and foes meet
together to clear up the whole, this sign is set before
them : By righteous and just judgment I have fixed
the Trial, and by the truth it shall be proved; so
righteousness and truth will meet together, love and
peace will kiss each other ; that is, love will kindle
in every heart; and thosfi that are now angry wiU
then be as loving friends: so— t
Perfect harmony will take place,'
And every truth they'll then embrace;
For I shall throw thee ina Trance,
And everytruth I’ll then advance.
So Adams here you’ll all appear—
This is the Fall of Man :
And paler than the whited wall
Will every member stand$
Then Satan’s tall, be it known to all,
Will surely follow next;
For Man s Redemption now I call,
My standard so 1fixt
It more secure for to endure
Than ’twas before he fell $
For all his foes I’ll so secure
And triumph over hell.
So men may see their destiny—
These are the fir*t redeem’d ;
Then follows on (for fast’twill come)
The pure and living stream ;
For thou’lt.return, and man will mourn*
And tears ofjoy 'twill be.
The standardhere will so appear.
That tearsofjoy they’ll see.
So now at last my word at first
I surely shall complete:
The Woman ne’er brought on thecurse^
But did the Serpent cheat.
A Mystery, that man.shall see,
Will come so inthe End;
For the good fruit was on the tree-*t
And Satan here must bend:
Pluckt by hpr band let Satan stand*
And the good fruit appear;
The evil first, and Man wascasl^
And Satanmust stop here.

Then she must bringagain to Mat*
T ic knowledge of the good;
Ther S^at.V arts must feel the dart,
When ! fulfil his word:
To be as Gods it was his word—
- His word I'll now fulfil ; v
Then he must fall, be it known to all—
*
But now I say,, stand still,
And in the end, mark what is penn’d,
The mysteries will come round.
There's always Hell where Satan dwells*
And there he must be bound:
Mv ways arejust, let sinners trust,
And judge mb in the end.
•So on the Troe look all to MS,
I died the sinner’s friendj
For now

I tell them, likea Ghost,
And tell the simple sons of men

And how they may it all regain,

For Pargdise they shall obtain,
That now like men will stand,

Then fast the deluge down will come-**
This is themention'd war.
I mad^the Woman at the first
For to complete Man’s bliss;
Then no\y by her it shall be done.
And make yourjarring cease.”
Since the conclusion of her Trial, Joanna received
one of the books published against her at Stour­
bridge, which was announced some months since.
After reading it she spoke of it thus : “ I see the
unbounded wisdom of God, in ordering me to
proceed as I have done; for I could not have
thought there had been so black a heart ia man,
as to judge, that in spiritual things, any one could
have acted so deceitfully with God and man, as the
wretched author^ who printed this book against me
hath done; but whatever may be the blackness of
his heart, my soul come not thou into his secrets !
The Lord is. my judge, and is witness against him.
And I admire the wisdom of the Lord, in having
the truth cleared, in the manner it follow$ heHU

OF
JOANNA ’SOITTHCOTT*
THE FIRST DAT.
W EDNESDAY, DECEMBER 5, 1804,
The Trial of Joanna Southcott commenced at the
hour of eleven this morning, by calling over the
forty-eight names of the persons appointed to carry
on the proceedings.
According to the directions laid down, the letters
gent by Miss Townley to the clergy, and by them
returned, were laid before the meeting ; and also,
such letters as accompanied them from several cler-
. gymen, containing;their sentiments thereon. These
letters were read and examined, whence it appeared,
that their general tendency was mockery against the
mission of Joanna, and also a condemnation o f pro­
phecy. But it is likewise necessary to mention, that
among^he letters thus sent by clergymen, several o f
them were of that indecent description, that delicacy
prevents their being at all brought forward to public

A . I cannot recollect a sentence ; but I know in
aubstance it was to request of Chancellor Nutcornbe ’
to search into Joanna Southcott’s writings, and to
judge, whether or not they were from the Spirit o f
the living God. ‘

conversation with Mr. Pomeroy, as to the writings of
Joanna Southcott ?
A . Yes, several times.
Q. I think you say, you have asked him several
times his opinion of Mrs. Southcott’s works ?
A . Yes, in many conversations.
Q. Generally, Sir, what were his answers to your
questions, and his own opinions at that time, con­
cerning Joanna ?
A. Many and several times, in our shop at Exeter,

against himself. -

and laughed at it, and told me I had better have
nothing more to do with that mad woman. He

family already, by believing in such nonsense, mean­
ing the accidental deaths of my two sisters in one
Week. He at that time (and never before in my pre­
tence in the least) said her works were wrong, or
were from the devil. I asked him why, if they were
from the devil, he had first deluded me and many
Others to believe in her ? He seemed very angry and
told me he wanted to get her to her senses. Before I
Went, he still in greater anger said that it would be
better for me to believe in the Church of England,
and that only, and burn all the bills that I had print­
ed. I told him I should not; he first instilled the
idea, and I retained it.
Q . Pray, Sir, did you know that Joanna South-
tott had said any thing of the death o f your sisters
before it happened ?
A . Not directly, but only indirectly.
Q . W hat sort of indirect evidence had you ?
A . About ten months before the death of my sis­
ters, Joanna had attended the funeral of my brother:
she said, she was afraid this was not the only cala­
mity that would happen in oUr house, in the course
o f twelve months. '

Q . For whom ?
A . One in particular I recollect was for Mr. Po­
meroy : it related to the harvests that were to ensue
the following years, if the people continued in the
unbelief of her writings,which letter I refused to'copy.
Q. W hat were your particular reasons, for not
copying that letter ?
A. Because I thought she spoke in too harsh and
positive a manner of what was to follow, thinking
her too insignificant a character to send such a letter
to M r. Pomeroy, as I understood that letter was to
be made public to the citizens of Exeter.
Q. Where did you live, before you went to the
city of Bristol ?
A. At Whitehall, about a mile from Bristol.

' A . 1 did succeed so far by telling her that I had
got an. appointment to the West Indies, in which I
persisted until I had got an appointment, and was
absolutely sworn into the custom house at Bristol.
Upon shewing my Sister my appointment, arid still
assuring her it was for tfye W est Indies; my Sister

then replied, " W ell, brother, if you do go to th^
West Indies, I shall destroy all my w ritingsfor I aro
told by the Spirit, you should settle in Bristol, and do
very well.” ,
Q.. Pray* Sir, what effect had this prophecy of
your Sister upon your mind ?

the event to time.
Q. Did your Sister ever tell you, that you might
be present when her writings were proved ? -
A . Yes, she has.
Q. Did you, Sir, or have you ever tried to deceive,
her in the confidence of the Spirit, which she pro­
fessed to have been led by ?
A. Not since the West India affair.
Q. Did your Sister ever tell you, that a number of
people should be gathered together, for the purpoto
of proving her writings ?
A . Yes, Sir, she has.
Q. Did you, Sir, ever believe that a number ot
people should be collected together, for that express
. purpose ?
A . I did not believe it prior to 1803.
Q. I believe, Sir, for a long continuance of time,
you did not believe your Sister was visited by the
spirit of prophecy; but that you conceived she was
misled, either by derangement of m ind,,or by some
evil spirit?
A . Yes, Sir, I did.
Q . A t what lime was it that you, first began to
chink your Sister was visited by the Spirit of the liv­
ing God ?
' A . In June 1803, Mrs. Foley and my Sister cam*
■ my house in Bristol, and informed me what had
passedatthe time shewas atHigh House, Paddington.;
when hearing the extraordinary things she related,
and of the very respectable characters engaged in

ritings with attention, and on comparing them with
the Scriptures, I had no doubt but they were from
the Spirit of the living God*
Q. Before that information, had you ever read the
books published by your Sister ?
A. I never had*
Q. Was that your first inducement fof reading
them ?
A. It was. I had never seen them before.
Cl. Did y6u, Sir, ever tell your Sister, or did you
believe, that a number of persons should never bo
collected together, for the purpose of proving, of
searching into her writings ?
A. I believe I did tell my Sister so, and prior to
1803, I never thought they would.

L
. Now, Sir, generally from your mutual child*
, hood up to the present day, what is your opinion of
your Sister as to her character, for truth, justice, mo­
rality, and charity; and for possessing a-sound mind,
and general virtue ?
A . Unexceptionable in all those characters.
Q. Do you believe she is particularly distinguished
in those characters ?
A. I have every reason to think so, never having
heard her character traduced by her greatest enemies.
Q. Now, Sir, there is an old observation, and a
scriptural one, that a prophet has no honour in his
own country; do you, Sir, in the face of that obser­
vation, and with all the prejudices, which you
formerly had against your Sister, now believe that
she is visited by the Spirit of the living God l
A. Yes, Id o.

Mr. Pomeroy to a letter, which I had written to him.
Q. What passed between Mr. Pomeroy and your­
self, when you saw him ?
A. I began with begging his pardon for the li­
berty I had taken in writing to him the day before ;
he asked me to come in. I went into his back par­
lour, and had a great deal of conversation concerning
Joanna, the principal features of which related to
Joanna’s Mission. He ashed me, if I was a believer ?
I answered, how could I be otherwise, since I find
what she says comes true. Mr. Pomeroy told me,
Joanna had a great deal of shrewd sense. M y answer
was, she knows no more of herself than this table.-^-
His answers were so ambiguous that I did not under­

put into the hands of Mr. Pomeroy; but before I
gave it up, I signed my name and dated it, the day
J parted with it, that I might know it was the same
letter which had been in m y hands.
Q. Did you ever put any other letters in Mr*'
Pomeroy’s hands ? Q 2

street at Bodmin ; I told him I should be glad to
speak to him. W e went into a narrow Court; I told
him I hoped he would excuse the liberty I was tak­
ing with him, but had got a letter for him. He an­
swered, what ? is it from that mad woman at Exeter ?
He spoke so loud that one or two people stopped
to hear. He'said she was as mad as a March hare. I
then replied, that cannotbe; there are so manypersons
o f respectability who support her. He then replied,
they are all mad. I did not like to say any thing
more to him for fear of'a mob. I made an apology on
his finding fault; to which he replied, I know you
do not mean to offend m e; if I thought that I would
not speak to you. I afterwards made up that letter
in a parcel, and sent it to him r about six weeks after­
wards he Sent for me, and returned the Jetter to me,

THE SECOND DAY.
THURSDAY, DECEMBER 6, 1804.
T h e assembly having met about the hour of ten
this morning, near the house, received a message,
that Joanna was in great agitation, waiting for an
interview. The three clergymen and four other gen-*
tlemen, who had been at Exeter first to examine
into the truth of her mission, followed by the Test
o f the forty-eight, as their names were called over,
repaired immediately to the room where Joanna and.
her female friends were seated. After some, time
passed in mutual congratulations, Joanna got up and
spoke until twelve o’clock precisely, at which time >
the box of sealed writings was put upon the table,
and the different parcels of scaled papers taken out
©fit. *
It is necessary here to introduce a general account
o f the beginning of these writings, as delivered to
the assembly : From the time of Joanna’s visitation
by the Spirit, in 1792, different papers were sealed
up, year after year, and deposited with her friends;
and the whole of.these were put into a box together,
, at the end of 1794, after having been first sealed up
by her friends. The communications given in the
, subsequent years were added to the former, at the
end of each year, and put into the box, and thus
remained in the possession of her friends, until the
year 1800. The writings were first cut open, by the
desire of theRey. Mr. Pomeroy, at the end of the
year 1800, in the house of Mr. Symons, at Exeter, and
in the presence of twelve witnesses, five of whom were
present this day, some of whose names were signed on
Digitized by v ^ o o Q i e
16 refit fR iA i 6w
every sheet of the writings;; and some of the writing#,
thus signed, were delivered into the hands of Joanna,
in order to be copied and deposited with the Rev. Mr.
Pomeroy. They were .again sealed up in the pre­
sence of Six witnesses, about two months after the
Opening of them, or in the spring of 1801, and were
left in the care of Mr. Symons,, of Exeter. Hav­
ing been after that committed to the possession o f
M f. Sharp, of Titchfield Street, London, they were
tut open a second time at Paddington, on January
12, 1803, in the presence of forty-nine persons in
all, twenty-three of whom acted under the denomi­
nation ofjudges and jury. The writings were again
verified there, leaf by leaf, generally by the signa-.
ture of three of those denominated judges and jury*.
Some parts were read tp the audience, and others
were given to be copied, from which the book called
“ The Sealed Prophecies” was printed. A t six
o'clock in the evening of M ay 2, 1803, the writing#
were scaled up again, in the presence of six of the
judges, Joanna, and four or five others. Each of
these judges affixed their seals and signed their
names on each parcel, and Joanna put her seal
thereon. The bundles thus signed and sealed, being
six in number, were exhibited this day, December
6, 1804, and the signatures and seals on them were
acknowledged, by the Rev. Stanhope Rruce, Rev.
Thomas Philip Foley. Rev. Thomas Webster, John
Wilson, Elias Carpenter, and William Sharp, a#
their own respective signatures and seals. A t the
conclusion of thus identifying the bundles of writings,
taken, out of the box, agreeably to the directions o f
Joanna, that is about one o’clock, she became very
faint, and was helped out of the room, after signify­
ing that the writings were not to be cut open till she-
Jiad strength to be present.

though the necessaries of life were now cheap, every
tiling would be dearer than ever was known in the
memory of man 4 and advised Mr. Taylor to lay in
a store; for that she had wonderful writings at Plym-
tree. ♦ Mr. Taylor then said, “ Joanna, you are a

great spirit and apparent sincerity, “ S o l am ;”
which was the first information I ever had, that she
assumed the character of a prophetess.
Q. Did she, Madam, inform you of any particu­

write to Mr. Pomeroy upon the subject of her visita­
tion, and to inform him of the approaching awful
period*

A. Because part of my family wrote letters and
communications to Mr. Pomeroy, and they were sent
to his house, and conveyed to his hands.
Q.. Do you know, of your own knowledge*, these
letters, &c. &c. came into Mr. Pomeroy’s hands ?
A . I d o; because he came to our house in conse­
quence of the letters.
Q . What did Mr. Pomeroy say to the contents of
the letters, &c. &c.
A . He came to our house to enquire out the cha­
racter of one Joanna Southcott, from whom he had,
he said, received a letter, and enquired particu­
larly as to her character, and whether I thought
her in the possession of a sound mind and under­
standing.
Cl. When you told Mr. Pomeroy your opinion
o f Joanna’s character, did he make any observations
upon the contents of the letters, &c. he had re­
ceived?
A. M r. Pomeroy said, a man had told him
.that Joanna had prophesied lies. I replied, I was
sure she had not, for she prophesied nothing but
truth. M r. Pomeroy then said, “ I should be glad
“ to see her;” and I accordingly sent for her,
Q.. Did Joanna then come ?
A . She did.

M r. Pomeroy, in your presence ?

“ be very happy if he could do any thing for her.”
W e then parted.
Q.’ How long after the last interview did any
other letters or meeting take place, between Joanna'
and Mr. Pomeroy ?
A . About twp or three months, when Joanna re-

THE TRIAL OF
quested an interview with Mr. Pomeroy, at M r.
Taylor’s house, which accordingly took place.
Q. Were you present at that meeting ?
A. Yes, I was; for Joanna had requested of me,
that I should not leave the room whilst M r. Pome­
roy was there, and if I would not do so she. would
not go into the room ; for she said, she was ordered
not to see him without a witness. I accordingly did
so, and Joanna ordered our family, not to call me
out while Mr. Pomeroy stopped; I accordingly re­
mained the whole of the time that Mr. Pomeroy and
Joanna were together.
Q.. Do you recollect what particularly happened
at that meeting ?
A. Yes ; Joanna told Mr. Pomeroy of what t^ould
speedily happen in the world, and read to him so/ne
of her communications; and at that meeting told
M r. Pomeroy, that she was the Bride mentioned in
the Scripture, and particularly mentioned to him
about Judas betraying our Lord.
CL Was there any thing in the previous part o f
the conversation, that led to the observation of Jo­
anna concerning Judas betrajing his Lord ?
„A. Id o not know that there was.
Q. Was there any particular comment, made by
Joanna, concerning Judas betraying his Lord ?
A . There was a great deal said, but I do not re­
collect what.
CL Was there any observation, in your recollec­
tion, that was made by Joanna, that such a character
as Judas would again be found upon the earth ?
A. No, there was not; but Joanna particularly
described the character of Judas, to which M r. Po­
meroy replied, “ I never understood it so.” Joanna
then said, /
’and looked at him with particular earnest­
ness,) “ I was ordered to tell you so, Sir.” M r.
Pomeroy then said, “ Joanna, you have advanced
“ tilings which make me shudder, and I do not know

Joanna sou th cott. 63
“ but it is bordering upon blasphemy.” She again
repeated those words, “ I was ordered to tell you so,
“ Sir.” And in the course of the conversation re­
peated the same several times, and said, “ I know
“ what blasphemy is, but I was ordered to tell you
“ these things.” In reply to some observations made
by Joanna, Mr. Pomeroy replied, “ it is impossible
“ for me to tell that all your writings come from the,
“ Spirit of God ; I cannot, do i t ; but great part cf
“ them, I .am sure, .ire; and I beg that_ you will
“ make yourself happy, for I do not believe, that
“ one word of your’S is from the spirit of the D evil;
“ and I shall always be happy to see you, Joanna, or
“ to receive any thing from you.” But did not say
one word about Joanna being out of her mind. I do
not recollect any thing more that happened at this
meeting.
Q. W ill you inform us, what you know of papers
and letters put into the hands of M r. Pomeroy from
Joanna ?
A . I know that my children has copied the letters
of Joanna, and that they have been conveyed into
the hands of M r. Pomeroy, by Mrs. Bird and our two
apprentices.
Q.. Have you any reason to believe, that these
letters and papers were safely conveyed into the
hands of Mr. Pomeroy ?
A . I am certain, from the conversations that
passed between Mr. Pomeroy and Joanna, that J\Jr.
Pomeroy was in the constant habits of receiving
safely the letters sent to him ; and there was an al­
most constant correspondence, which passed be­
tween Joanna and Mr. Pomeroy, up to the period of
her going to Bristol, in the year 1798 ; and from
there she wrote to me, that she would not return to
Exeter, unless Mr. Pomeroy would come forward
to examine the .truth of her writings.
Q . Did you apply to Mr. Pomeroy ?

THE TRIAL OP
A , I sent to him through Mrs. Bird, who returned
me For answer, that he was willing to meet any, to
prove Joanna’s writings. I wrote to Joanna, and in:
consequence she came to Exeter; but before she came
I received two letters from her, as to the harvests of
1799 and 1S0C, written in her own hand ; and after
she came home, she read me the two letters she wrote
from Bristol, which were literally fulfilled in those
two years.
Q. Do you know what particularly happened af­
ter Joanna.’s return from Bristol, in 1798 ?
A . She was in the habits of writing to Mr, Pome­
roy more frequently than before; and he was in the
habits of coming to our house to see Joanna.
Q. Do you know of any disagreement, between-
Joanaa and M r. Pomeroy, about putting his name
in print ?
A . I do.
Q.. Describe, as nearly as you can, the cause o f
that disagreement ?
A. It was on the account of his name being in­
troduced in print, in the-writings of Joanna; and he
frequently expressed great anger at Joanna, for having
. so done, and said, he would rather have doile any
thing than she should have done so, “ and if you bad
“ set my house on fire, I W'ould rather have forgiven
“ you than for doing this.” Joanna then replied, “ I
“ was ordered to do so.” M r. Pomeroy then replied,
“ the Devil ordered yo u ! and I believe you were
“ born for my ruin.” M r. Pomeroy seemed very
agitated and faint; so much so, that M r. Taylor
requested me to go in and give Mr. Pomeroy some­
thing. I heard Mr. Pomeroy repeatedly say, “ my
“ dear Joanna, do whatever y&u like; but? leave my “
“ name out of the question.” Upon another visit he
used soothing language to Joanna, and* told her,
“ you have injured me greatly in the opinion of the
‘ ‘ world.” And. he pulled out a paper out* o f his
(34
Digitized by Google
pocket, and said, I wish you to sign this paper,
“ for the satisfaction of my friends.” But he never
said it was to be put in print. Joanna said, “ l am
“ sure I am willing to make you any satisfaction, if
“ I have injured you.” Mr. Pomeroy said, “ You
** know, Joanna, I said, that when you put my
“ name in print, it was from the Devil.” Joanna re­
plied, “ I know you did : but you never told me my
“ writings were from the Devil.” Upon which M r.
Pomeroy read the paper, taken from his pocket,
and asked Joanna and me to sign it, which we did,
considering it only to be an acknowledgment, that
Mr. Pomeroy had said, that the putting his name
“ in print was from the Devil.” I did not read the
paper over before I signed it, because Mr. Pomeroy
seemed confused ; I was so alsoi I do not believe
that Joanna read it before she signed it. She seemed
in the utmost confusion, from the conduct of M r.
Pomeroy; and considered the paper as an acknow­
ledgment only, that M r. Pomeroy had said, “ the
“ putting his name in print was from the Devil,”
Q.. Had you any reason to doubt the truth of the
prophecies of Joanna Southcott, in the autumn of
1801 ?
A. I had, in October, 1801, because her father
did not die at the time she predicted; I then asked
Joanna,, why she had written to her friends, in Lon­
don, of the time of her father’s death ? She replied,'
“ I wrote to them as it was given to me, and let it
“ come as it will, I will deceive no man— my God, I
“ will deceive no man !” I also had doubts, at other
times, when things did not come according to my
judgment.-
Q. After you had signed the paper of M r. Pome­
roy’s, what did you say to him?
A. I said, Joanna’s writings from the-Devil, Sir-? .
I never heard you say such a thing; but always said,
they came from a good Spirit. Mr. Pomeroy then
took me by the arm and said, “ do not make your-

THE TRIAL OF
“ self unhappy for this, others have.” I replied, ‘‘ I
“ never heard you say so, Sir.” That night I could
not sleep, 1 was so unhappy at what 1 had done ;
the next morning I was preparing to go to Mr. Po­
meroy, when Joanna came and said, she had received
orders to send a letter to M r. Pomeroy, which was
accordingly sent down by my nephew, which letter
contained a reflection upon his ungenerous behayiour,
in taking an advantage of them, by obtaining their
signatures through unjust representations.
C
L
. Have you, since that' time, had any reason to
think the mission of Joanna Southcott not to be
from the Spirit of the living God ?
A . Not in the least.
Q . Were you ever acquainted with any request o f
M r. Pomeroy, to have the events of the year 1797
put into his hands i
A . Yes.
Q . Was you present when the request was made ?
A.' Yes.
Q . W hat was the consequence of it ?
A . He said, “ In days of old, when people wanted
“ to enquire of the Lord, they went to the prophets,
“ and they would tell them what would happen.
u Now, Joanna, if you will tell me what will happen,
“ in Italy, England, or Spain, say three months* or
<(six months, then I will be your believer.” “ I can-
u not tell that; I cannot tell you*.” Upon which I said
to Joanna, (after he was gone,) he gives you a great
, deal of trouble, to have so much writing from you,
and if I was in your place* Joanna, I would not write
to him any more. I saw her two or three days after,
and asked her if any thing was given to her for Mr.
Pomeroy ? She said, No, nothing had been given.
Some days after this, she brought me several sheets,
with a great deal of writing, for Mr. Pomeroy, in
. answer to the enquiries lie had made.
Q . To your knowledge, were those papers or
writings deposited in the hands of M r. Pomeroy ?
* Meaning she couldnot tell hersel£
66
Digitized by b o o g i e
A . They certainly were sent there.
Q . How do you know they were sent to him ?
A . Because Mr. Pomeroy acknowledged to have
received them, I think about two years ago.
Q . Did you ever hear Joanna say to Mr. Pome­
roy, that she had put the events of nations, and
particularly o f England, Italy, France, and Spain,
into his hands ?
A . Joanna and Mr. Pomeroy were disputing of
the truth she had put into his hands; they were then
talking of the events which Joanna had put in his
hands. She then said to him, that she had put certain
papers in M r. Jones’s hands. H e said, “ Joanna, '
“ if I am to be your judge, why not put them into
“ my hands ? why into Mr. Jones’s ?”
Ci. W hat was the consequence of the observation
that Mr. Pomeroy had made to Joanna ?
A . She got them from Mr. Jones, with an inten­
tion to deposit them with Mr. Pomeroy. I desired her
not to take them from Mr. Jones, and said, if 1 was
you, Joanna, I never would put any more in his
hands. A t the very hour that she proposed going
with the papers, to Mr. Pomeroy, such a heavy
storm of thunder, lightning, and rain, took place
as I never remembered before or since, that the
waters ran down in the cellars of our house, which
never happened at any other time or since. About the
same time Mr. Pomeroy said to Joanna, “ so you
said there will be a revolution in Spain ?” Joanna
said, “ So I say now, before my writings are ended.’*
A t other times she answered him so quick to what
he said, that he replied, “ you have- got your Bible
“ at your finger’s end; you make the Bible, your
“ study.” She again replied, “ I have not studied
“ the Bible these nine years.” “ How ,so ?” says
Mr. Pomeroy. She said, “ she had her frying to
ff get, and in all the spare time she was writing.”
Q.. Do you recollect Joanna Southcott’s Slaving
written a letter to M r. Pomeroy, in 179O, respecting
1 i
JOAITOA SO0THCOTT. (fr_
Digitized by G o o g l e
the bishop of Exeter’s death, that was to happen in
. that year ?
A. Indirectly, he had acknowledged to have re­
ceived a letter from Joanna, respecting the bishop’s
death, which he said, “ was of trifling consequence
“ to the nation.”
Q. Do you know, that Mr. Pomeroy sent back
any letter - or writings, in Joanna’s own hand, to be
copied off for him, and each leaf with his signature
upon it ?
A . Yes, Sir, I do know it,
Q.. Do you know the contents of those papers or
writings, which were sent back to Joanna to be co­
pied off for him ?
A . They contained the events of what was to hap­
pen to France, Italy, and Spain.
Q, Have any of those events been fulfilled, which
were contained in those writings ?
A . Many of those events happened that year, par­
ticularly in Italy ; and in England, the triple taxes
were first put on.
Q.. Do you recollect, that Joanna ever told you,
that Mr. Pomeroy disputed with her, that her fore­
knowledge of her prophecies came from herself ? or
did you ever hear pf yourself, from Mr. Pomeroy,
that he entertained the same doubt ?
A . I have heard it from both. ,
Q.. Did you ever, when you heard him say so,
say also, why do you not put it in print i
A. I have heard him say so, and I have also heard
him say, at the same time, “ you will wait until you
<
e bring the sword, the plague, and the famine upon
“ the land ; and if I was sure it was from the Lord, I
** would fear no man.” He further said, “ if she
■*
*could not get twelve to prove her writings, she
should get six ; I will meet with twelve or six.”
, This was said in 1706, in Mr. Taylor’s dining par­
lour, in her presence, and at the end of J7Q6 he re­
peated the same words in Mr. Taylor’s parlour.

The first time Joanna spoke to Mr. Pomeroy was
at my house *, where he came and enquired her cha­
racter, and had some conversation with her, and
parted friendly. This happened about ten .years
ago. In 1797, I went with Joanna to Mr. Po­
meroy’s, to hear some writings read,.which Joanna
had put in his hands before; but he disputed with
her, that she might read any thing to him, as he
could not read it himself, which threw Joanna into a
passion, saying he must judge her worse than the
witch of Endor, if she was to put writings in his
hands to deceive him. Mr. Pomeroy immediately ap­
pealed to me, saying, he always judged Joanna to
be a religious good woman; but if he believed, her,
others would not. He then gave consent for Joanna
to come the following week to read her writings to
him. Joanna, instead of going to him, desired him
to sign his name on' some sheets which were in his
hands, of her writing, and send them to have them
copied off, which he accordingly did, and I brought

them to my house, and Miss Fanny Taylor copied
them off, and they were sent back'to Mr. Pome­
roy again. I have also repeatedly carried letters
from Joanna to M r. Pomeroy, and he always re­
ceived them kindly, and in general, asked how Jo­
anna was.
Wheri Joanna was in Bristol, I went to M r.
Pomeroy, and said, that Joanna’s friends were all
willing for her to come home to Exeter; I asked
him, if he was willing to come forward, with others,
to examine Joanna’s writing, whether they were from
the Lord or not ? M r. Pomeroy said, he was willing
to meet those she had wrote to, and if she had not
sufficient, he Would get two or three, and he would
do any thing for her; for he thought it much better
for her to come home, as it was thd wish o f her
Jiriends. A t another time he said, he would receive
any letters or papers from her at any time. I have like­
wise been to M r. Pomeroy’s, from Joanna, to know
when it was agreeable for him to see her and talk
with her, and he appointed the time, and said^ let
her come, and I will talk with her. This hath hap­
pened many .times; but Joanna was ordered, for
years, not to see him without witnesses. I have been
with Joanna many times, and never heard him say,
at any time, or even hint, that her writings were from
the D evil; but always treated her with civility.

A . I said to him “ would thank you for your supe­
rior judgment on these wonderful writings of Joanna
Southcott— He ask’d me then what'Lmeant; I told
bitn, to the best of my recollection, if they were right,
and from a true spirit, they ought to be proved by

ministers to go into the world. There was a further
conversation, and I recollect he asked me, ^why I
troubled myself so much about it ? I answered, my
son copied for her; and if it came from an evil spirit,
and if he could prove it, and judged it was so, I
would not suffer him .to do it for the whole world
He then laughed at me, and said “ they were simple
creatures who said that; there was nothing of it that
caine from the devil, for it was good; and in regard
to that,- you have nothing to fear; for I see nothing
but what is g o o d a n d he further said, “ I have had
a good deal of conversation with her, and f find her
a good tempered woman ; but I am afraid she writes
some things from herself; and if she does, it will
Soon come to nought, for she soon will be deranged.”

Pomeroy’s house ?

wished to have some writings cut open ?

opened, and, “ if Joanna could not get twelve, get six,
w hy not let the world know, and have them pub­
lished, before the troubles and desolation came on.”
Q . Do you recollect, whether Mr. Pomeroy desi­
red the letters and papers to be copied off and sent

RESOLUTIONS,
Proposed to the 48 persons invited, by divine
command, for the examination o f Joanna
Southcott’s prophecies and character, as­
sembled at the N eckinger, Bermondsey, near
London.
F i r s t .— It doth appear, by the conduct o f the bishops
and the clergy of the church of England, that they
have refused to enquire into the truth oj the writings
of Joanna Southcott.
Second.— It doth appear, by the letters examined
this day, of the clergy, who returned the written let­
ters o f Miss Townley, that our'censure o f them can­
not be too strongly marked.
T h i r d .— The Rev. M r. Pomeroy's conduct doth ap­
pear to be false and deceitful, respecting Joanna,
Southcott.
F o u r t h .— It doth appear to us, that in all instances
. whatever, Joanna Southcott hath fulfilled her high
calling, and hath faithfully claimed the promise it*
the creation, for the woman to be the helpmate to
. man; and it appears to us, that her whole life
(which has been proved by living witnesses) hath
been innocently and faithfully employed in the dis­
charge of her duty towards God and towards man;
and that she hath acted openly and without any de-
, ceit to Mr. Pomeroy, the church, and to the nation •
at large» ,
F ifth.— From the consideration ofthe abovequestions,
and the examinations of Joanna's writings, it doth
appear to us, thqt she is visited by the Spirit oj the
living God.’

These propositions were separately read to the
the whole forty-eight persons, and unanimously
passed the affirmative.

#0
In the course of the afternoon,it was announced to
the meeting, that Joanna was laid on a sick bed,
being very weak and faint; but that she was receiv­
ing a communication, which some time afterwards
was brought in and read; and the following is a
copy of i t :
Joanna met her friends, and was greatly affected
at seeing all her female friends; but waited-
with impatience, longing to see her friends in the
gentlemen appear, and felt a great agitation in her
spirits, which by some delay heightened her feel­
ings, and her heart beat, and seemed tef swell too*
big for her body ; the wind rose in her throat, and
she was obliged to cry out, or she should have
fainted away ; but her tears came to her relief*
When the gentlemen entered the 'room, the
clergy entering first, she felt her tongue tied
and was not able to speak ; and as her friends came
in her confusion encreased, and in her own mind
she thought she should have fainted away; but to
her great astonishment, when all had entered, though
she felt herself as it were dying before, she was then
as a giant refreshed with new wine, without pain, sick- '
ness, or weakness; but stood up and felt the Spirit
of the Lord enter within her, to call them all to the
remembrance of the F a ll; and when she told the,m
of the Promise made to the Woman to bruise the
serpent’s head, every man in the room held up his
hand to join with her in claiming the Promise. Many
other parts of the Scripture they joined in the same c
that Christ must be the helpmate in the woman for
the man, to bring in his redemption; to'fulfil the
first, that he may establish the last; though these-
words were npt mentioned, but they were to the
samp purport and meaning,' what was spoken, that
as in Adam all died even so in Christ should all b.e
made alive ; so Christ is come to do away the first, -
according to thejpromise made in the Fall, that he

may establish the last, to destroy him that hath the
power of death, which is the Devil. Joanna met
her friends in tears this day, and tears frequently
flowed from their eyes, which she saw in many.
THE ANSWER OF THE LORD,
Now, Joanna, I shall answer thee. This is my
Gospel: blessed are they that mourn, for they shall
be comforted; it is better to go to the house o f
mourning than to the house of feasting. And now
I tell thee, if this had been to you all as a day o f
rejoicing, without a holy solemnity of tears and
mourning, it would not be -avisitntionfrom the Lords
for, though it is written, you are to rejoice in the
God of your salvation, yet you must come before the
Lord with fear and trembling. And know how my Bible
stands, and what was said o f Solomon, if he continued
in the steps of his father David, the house that he had
built junto me snould stand; but if he departed from,
m e , it should fall. He did depart from m e , and
the house fell. And the same stand thy writings: if
the unbelievers had appeared, thy life would have
been taken as soon as they had entered the room ;
for how could I call forward these arguments, to ask
if every man wished to join with the Woman, to
have the serpent’s head bruised, and his curse be
above every living creature, if one half was for him,
and the other half against him ? Then an equal
number decides nothing $ so if one half was for m e ,
and the Other half against m e , in this assembly, i(
could not be decided by thy words; therefore, if
must he decided by wonders. But as all hearts were
united together in one voice, like the Jews of old,
“ Crucify him / crucify him/” and so they now say
o f the Powers of Darkness, as the thief said on the
cross, Christ had done no. harm worthy of Death,
but that the Devil is the universal enemy to God
ghd man. This being the language o f all hearts,
J o a n n a s o u t h c o t t . fit

which I knew, of them that were present; therefore,
my Spirit arose strong in thee, to place these argu­
ments strongly before them ; then after their uni­
versal^voices were given, I left thee to shew them
my death; how I withdrew from th:m and, died for
their sakes. But I know the language of thy heart:
Thou left them fainting, but thou art not dead ; no,
I tell thee, I died once for a ll; and there is no
more death to make atonement for sin. But thou
art as clay in the hands of the potter; and without
m e thou canst do nothing ; but when my Spirit is
strong in thee, thou canst propose the questions I
make unto them ; but the moment my Spirit leaves
thee, let them see thou art dust and ashes; that
thou art nothing ; and without mb thou canst' do
nothing. And when thy Trial is over, let them all
confess they stood as waterpots filled with water;
and, like my disciples of old, let them all say, “ we
verily thought the Lord would have acted a different
way than wnat he hath acted and yet, like thedia-
ciples, they will all say in the end, “ the Lord hath
acted to make every thing clear before us, in a way
and manner we, nor her, never understood.” But this
is the wisdom of God to confound the wisdom o f
men, that they might not say, she acted by arts ac­
cording to her writings. But now let every man fix
his eyes to thy looks when my Spirit is strong upon
thee, and see the change when I leave thee. Nature
cannot change its feelings-^-! know the thoughts o f
Thy heart, from the swelling of thy heart this d ay;
for thou judgest thou shonldest fall immediately. How
then could I try the hearts of men, to have their7
voices appear publicly united together for Satan's
destruction ? And now when thy writings are broke
open, thou wilt find in thy writings wherfc it is said,
Satan will not have so grqpt afriend at thy Trial as
Pilate was to m e . N o>
v let them all discern in thy
writings, that all will c.ome like Solomon's building

o f die temple to m s } if it do not come one way, it
will come the other; and they will find not a word
to vary. Now I shall come to reason with thee:
Adam first saw the Woman with silent joy, and after
that the communion burst between them ; but see
how soon she was left to herself, and Satan's arts
burst in upon her. Now let them remember, this
day in silent joy thou sawest thy friends, but wast
unable to speak; but when the Spirit of the Lord en­
tered in thee, with what strength thou spakest unto
them ! but the moment my Spirit left thee thy
strength was gone: and now remember, that thou wast
assisted by a man * to help thee up stairs ; so by man
was Eve assisted in the F a ll; and by man wast thou '
assisted, when m y Spirit left thee; but his assist­
ance was not to assist thee to fall; for bis assistance f
was to thy support; and for thy support have men
been this day, to join with thee in the Promise.
Now, as all together with an united voice have joined
with thee in the Promise made, so now, 1 tell thee,
they may all unite together in the words I told you
before.

They all had sworn to Heaven,
That in thy Trial they'd not plead
With Enemies, that’s given
Against my hand, if mendid stand
Against my Spirithere,
That I noHelpmate should command
The Woman's guilt toclean
So now you see fulfill'd to be, .
Because you have not one
That now against me dothagree#
To sayI shall not come

Now for te freethe Fall,
The Woman’s guilt this way to free#
And Satan's ruin call*
In heart and mind they-all seem'dbound
For m e to free the curse;
And so the end they now shall find;
For Satanshall not miss
The curseon he pronounc'd b y m e 3
For I'll bring on thewhole,
As all thesemen in heartdojoin,
The Tempter down shall Fall.

And wish'd m e todescend

In the course of the day some communications giv-

day. Some/ime was occasionally spent also in the

na, and comparing them with the Scriptures, till nine
o’clock in the evening, and then the proceedings of
this day closed, after reading a second communication
which was brought in, and which is inserted here:
Joanna went to sleep a little before five o’clock in
the afternoon, and slept till a quarter past six o’clock
and then awoke, and came off the bed ; and these
words were said to her by the Spirit:
“ Now, Joanna, I say unto thee, though I have
foiled my disciplesnow, as Ifoiledthematmy resurrec­
tion ; yet I tell thee I will not deceive them, but I
will make every thing clear before them-; for though
things shall not come to their judgment, according
to the manner they expected ; yet every thing shall
now be made clear before them. Thou hast asked,
and they have answered, that they believe I would
not deceive them : and now I tell thee, I will not
deceive them; for though I have cast thee down I
will raise thee up, and thou shalt meet them on the
morrow, to have thy seals broken : for now I tell
thee, every thing shall come to my Gospel; as I foil­
ed my disciples, I have foiled them ; but as I made
every thing clear to my disciples, I will make it clear
to them; and they shall confess to the world, as my
disciples did, things did not come according to their
judgment in the way and manner they expected;
yet it shall come to convince the world clearly*; thy
visitation is from the Lord. But the manner I shall
go on I shall conceal from thee, from day to day the
manner I shall lead thee on ; yet when the end is
come, they shall see every truth clear before them,
and my powerful visitation in thee, and by thee.
But I have already told thee, and rtow tell thee again,
should I lead thee on in a straight line, according to
their judgment, the unbelieving world would not
believe them, but look on all as a contrived thing ;
. therefore let them wait with patience and see the
end o f the seven days, and they shall see thy calling
dear;

THE T R IA L OF
r
THE THIRD DAY.
FRIDAY, DECEMBER 7, 1804.
T he meeting was opened soon after ten o’clock,
this morning, by calling over the names of the forty*
eight persons who composed i t ; and it was then an­
nounced, that Joanna was receiving a communica­
tion, which she would bring in as soon as finished.
She accordingly entered the room a few minutes af­
ter eleven, with the communication j and she then
delivered a short discourse on the purport of it,
Digitized by Google
and particularly respecting the new light thus given,
as to her Trial and her Mission in general. After
this the communication was read, being as follows :
On Thursday evening, Joanna began to be very
chearful; and meditating to herself, how all the
shadows came before the substance in her writings,
so she was in hopes, the shadow of her being taken
faint yesterday would be the substance of throwing
her into the Traijce to-day; and she was longing .
for the morrow ; so she told Underwood, that she
never longed more for a day, but did not assigp
her reasons. In the night she was earnest in prayer,
that the. Lord would this day throw her into the
Trance. She wad answered, she knew not what she
was praying for; she had told them, that she had
not prayed for her death y e t; but if she prayed for
her Trance now, she prayed for her death ; for she
never would live long after it, only to return and tell
them what she had seen. “ Therefore, the man that
dreamt of thy Trance might well say, he must buy
mourning; for thy Trance will bring thy death.
And now I shall answer thee more fully : I have al­
ways told thee, from first to last, when thy enemies
come forward thy Trance shall take place; and
now call to thy remembrance what I told thee, the
beginning of the year, the stars would be sealed in.
sorrow, and the clouds would keep.— And now I tell
thee, one way or other, that must take place; for I
must either grieve, and disappoint them of thy
Trance taking place now, or I must satisfy them and
take thee out of the world, and bring on everyjudg­
ment that js threatened to England ; for if I now

and the manner I have brought it dose to my Bible
and to my Gospel, will not convince them, without
thy being in a Trance, then let them say, thy op-
posers are here ; for I have always told thee, and I
now tell thee again, thy Trance should never come
without opposers ; so if it now come, they must be
opposers; for if thou hast no opposers now thy Trial
ends by my command; but now I tell thee and them,
it will be brought on again by man; therefore I have
told them to go to the bottom of every witness. Now
if man bring it forward man shall stand to it: but do
they simply suppose, that I shall prolong thy life,
to let thee be brought forward .to a Trial by men,
after I have thrown thee into a Trance, and shewed
thee my decrees, which they would not believe, if
they were not present to see it ? For, now remem­
ber, as the opposers refused to come forward, the
unbelievers have refused also. None but the sealed
people do appear before thou meetest the public;
but whatever way I now work, thou must meet the
public before the days are over ; for I shall give thee
strength to go through and be strong within thee.
Now let every one give their answer, what is their
will concerning my words; for I tell them all, what
is begun by m e will end by man; a Trial by men
will surely come forward; he called by the great and
learned: but then they must sustain every cost; for I
now charge my friends, never to go one journey by
the command of men, unless they are paid— And thy
Trance is no more a secret, but must be made pub­
lic . That is my decree, if men call thee forward as
enemies. Now I have told thee my mind; and let
.them answer i t ; and I shall answer thee again. Let
them give their answer before the seals are broken;
for I made thee faint the day that is past, to prevent
their sbreaking the seals, till I knew their mind.

Trance, we will not believe;” then tweuty-four op­
posers are present; and let their names be taken down,

and I shall answer thee again. But if they say— “ we'
want no further proofs; the will of the Lord be done, ’
and not ours; if the learned men call herforward, let'
him then shew his wondrous works to confound them,
that when they see, they may believe ; but if we tell
them, they may not believe us, but say it is common
for people to be in a Trance before their death.” For'
now I have told thee, thy death will soon follow thy
Trance; and therefore I told thee, if thou wast tried
by such men as John and I, I should soon take thy,
life from thee, and no man should have room to
take it. So, when the world breaks in upon thee,
then thy days will be to an end. But let no one
fear they shall not see the end ; for as they are now
called forward by me, so they will again be called
forward by men. Now if they are all satisfied with-1
out thy Trance, let thy seals be broken this day.
And I have told thee what must be put aside andr
sealed up, and never broke while thou art'alive ; but'
all the others must remain never to be sealed any
more : but what is to be sealed must now be sealed
in the presence of the whole. And I shalflearn some­
one to read thy written hand, when thou art no
m ore; but thine is a hand no man can forge : all
that will happen, till my Kingdom is established, is
in thy writings; but. not to be known at the pre­
sent : but nothing shall be concealed from thee,,
that I will do upon the earth.”
After the reading of this communication, the as­
sembly instantly stood up, and with uplifted hands
one and all cried out— “ The will of the Lord be .
done!”
At about half past eleven Joanna began to cut open
the sealed bundles containing her writings; but re­
tiring soon afterwards, she appeared again at
twelve, when she entered into an explanation of the.
nature of this Trial. She shewed that it is a Trial
to which she is caJledby the L ord, and not by man ;
that the assembly having lifted up hands, saying die

twenty-four elders. before h im ; and that speedily
she should be called to appear before man. She then
adverted to the peripd of fifteen years conditionally
added to her life from 1792 ; and then brought into
her recollection her former prophecies of being call*
ed before the great and learned ; and besides read­
ing various extracts from her writings, she read an im­
portant communication thereon given in July ]800.
Having concluded this discourse, Joanna began to
look over her writings, which were cut open, for the
purpose of selecting such as were to be sealed up till
after her death ; and to identify their being opened,
by putting signatures thereon. W hile Joanna was
thus engaged she announced, that for the conveni-
ency and satisfaction of all the sealed people, she
should meet them to-morrow at eleven in the meet­
ing-house. At four o’clock she retired; and in about
an hour afterwards a message was brought that she
was receiving another communication; and when half ,
an hour more was elapsed she appeared in the assem­
bly with the communication, and having spoke on
the purport of it for about ten minutes, she then de-'
sired it to be read, being as follows :
Friday morning a communication was given to the
• judges, jury, and the four and twenty elders, to
know if any would be opposers, to bring on my
Trance ; but when the communication was read
through, all the men in the room held up their hands
for the will of the Lord to be done, and not
theirs ; that they were truly convinced my calling
was of God without the Trance,

Trial be to man ; and though thy awful Trial is not
begun,.yet thy Trial is called forward by m b . And

have worked strong upon them, to be thy final,
death, and have brought on three years total famine,,
to. gratify their curiosity. This curiosity brought the
Fall at first'; and this curiosity was in the Jews, when,
th y: had.seen all my miracles, saying, “ let. hint.. ■
come down from the cross, and we will believe him.” .
But had I not worked greater miracles before, than,
it was to pome down from the cross ? And now I tell
thee, the truths of thy prophecies.that have followed,
arc greater than thy being thrown in a Trance; be­
cause Trances have been common, without prophe-.

before m e , for me to act according to my own wis­
dom, mercies, goodness, and truth. Now who shall
blame them ? W hb shall condemn them ? for it is
I that justifieth them ; but had they been as pre­
sumptuous as the Jews of old, to have said, “ let our
idle curiosity now be gratified, if the whole nation pe­
rish, we care not so long as we are gratified in a fatal
curiosity; for unless we see signs and wonders we will
not believe.” Then I tell thee, it would have been fa­
tal for your natron ; and the world might have con- .
demned these curious enquirers, if they would run
such a hazard as this. But now let every mouth lie
stopped, and every tongue be silent; and know how
these men held up their hands for the good of their
king and country, that no fatal judgments might
come by their idle curiosity. Then who is the man
that can condemn them ? And know it was printed
in thy writings before, I would send three plentiful
harvests for the sake of those whose hands were lift-,
ed up to m e, to search out the truth; and now for
the sake pf these whose hands were lifted up for the

«pke o f this nation, they shall see the famine remov­
ed from this nation; but they shall see it in another
nation, to know that it is I tne Lord have spoken it.
Then with what heartfelt gratitude will they fall
down and worship m e ! they have already fell be •
fore me in faith ; they are desirous of my mercies,
and not of my judgments; and of my protection to
the nation, that all may give glory, honour, and
praise to my Name : and in the end all men will say
they are worthy to be called to so great a calling.
And now I shall tell thee of the shadow o f yesterday:
there was an enemy in the camp of Israel; and when
thy enemies do appear, the substance will follow the
shadow ; but as I have ordered thee to keep from
thy friends, and the fluttering of thy heart was to meet
them, so I have kept thee from thy enemies. But
1 do not tell thee, this will be always; but as thoa
couldest not speak when thou sawest the men first
appear, so I tell thee thou wilt not be able to speak
when thy enemies first appear; for then will the ful­
filment of thy writings come on.
Thy dying looks will soon be known;
For as the shadow did begin,
The wind within thee strong was seen*
A trifling shadow did appear,
And so tne end they’ll all see clear 5

'After the reading of the above communication,
Joanna made some additional remarks thereon,
noticing what she had heard of the tyranny of Bona­
parte, which, if true, the French nation must be in
the most en.laved and degraded state, and may merit
the most heavy judgments; and therefore the lift­
ing up of hands in this assembly, for the will of the
Lord to be done, was a sign that the three years Fa­
mine was averted from England and to pass over to
France. She then gave an interesting detail o f
the incidents of her life, which she concluded about
a quarter past eight in the evening, when she re­
tired in that high flow of spirits she had enjoyed all
day, so that she appeared a different being altogether
from what she was yesterday. The proceedings of
this day were then closed.

THE FOURTH DAY.
SATURDAY, DECEMBER 3, 1304.
A g r e e a b l y to the notice given yesterday, Jo­
anna came to the public meeting-house at eleven
o’clock this morning; and after a shofttime passed
in the religions exercises of singing and-prayer, Jo­
anna stood up during ao hour precisely to addresa

The purport Of this discourse was to give a compre*
hensive account of her mission 5 and in the course of
it she desired the two communications given yester­
day to be read $ and the itieeting closed a little be­
fore one o’clock* in the saihe order as it began, the
whole having been conducted with great decorum •
and solemnity.
The proceedings Of the Trial commenced about
four o’clock, at which time it was announced that
Joanna was obliged to be laid on the bed, owing to
a considerable depression of spirits in the morning,
and the fatigues of going through her duty in the
public meeting $ and a communication had been
begun, but was discontinued, to allow her tiihe tQ
be refreshed. A t seven in the evening Joanna came
into the assembly, and after some time passed in dis­
course, the following communication was read :
Joanna went to meet the public, which was the
day after her appearance ; she tasted nothing before
she went but a little wine and water, arid that she
brought up soon after drinking it. When she came
to meet the public she felt faint and dying, and
thought to herself she could not speak unto them,
but sat faint, and in meditation and prayer, that the
Lord would be with her ; for without him she was
nothing, and without him she could do nothing j
and she was promised the Lord would be with her.
As soon as Mr. Carpenter came to the Lord’s prayer,
she felt the Spirit of the Lord eriter within her, and
when he had ended, strength arose in her, arid she
began to address the multitude. After bringing them
to the Fall, how the Promise was then made, and
to whom it was made, and by whom it must be claim­
ed ; and going through many passages o f the Scrip­
tures, and some of her prophecies, she called for
the communications that were given on Friday morn­
ing, and had them read to the public. She then
enquired of the whole meeting, if there was'any
3»an present, that would wish to satisfy so fatal a

curiosity, as to run the hazard o f gratifying.it, for
her to be in a Trance, to convince them the calling
was of God, and by so doing bring on the Fa­
mine, that they would then speak) and though
it was supposed there were about 700 people,-
yet every tongue was silent; and she never saw
a smile upon any man’s countenance, but saw
tears in many eyes. She was a long time coming out
of the meeting through the crowd, as she was stopped
by the people on both sides, holding out their
hands, to shake hands with her, as far as ever they
could reach her. W hen she came to M
r. Carpen­
ter’s house she was followed by many, and was much
•fatigued with talking with them; for when the Spirit
of the Lord leaves her, and is she left to her own
strength, she finds herself, gone, and $0 she was oblig­
ed to lay down on her bed.
THE ANSWER OF THE LORD.
" Now, Joanna, I shall answer thee. This is
the third day of thy seeing the people, and deep is
the Type of this day : every tongue was silent; every
mouth was stopped, and no one seemed to speak
against thee. This is the shadow, and in the end thou
wilt see the substance. The- heavenly joy thou felt
00 the day that is past is a type of what is to come,
of what thou wilt feel hereafter, when thy awful Trial
comes on. , For now I tell thee, as it was with m b,
it, is with thee : know that I said I was daily with
, them in the-sanctuary, yet no man laid hands upon
m b , foe my hour was not yet come ; and thou hast
been, daily with them, thou hast been openly with
them, nay thou hast warned and invited them, but
no man hath laid hands on thee, for thy hour is not
yet come ; but thy hour will come, when they will
seize thee, as they seized mb ; though not in the
same manner$ yet they will seize thee by the law,
from thy own handwriting, Which must go io print.

should appear; but when that sign is made public,
and the learned see how thy writings are; placed ; the
twelve stars upon thy head; the jury joined together
to affirm it; the four and twenty elders ' appear­
ing to cast their crowns before mb : that meaneth to
cast their wisdom before m e , trusting wholly in me —
the pride of the learned will begin to swell, and say,
“ we are convinced, that instead of our silence putting
" a stop to it, it hath only raised it much the higher :
ft and they have brought the whole now to the Gos-
tc pel, to Compare it all with the words of their Saviour,
“ which we cannot deny; therefore we find no way
<c to confound them, unless we come to confound her
“ from her own words, and say, as the Jews said o f
“ old, let her come down from the cross and we will
believe her: for this impostor hath said— she shall
be in a Trance, and in three days be restored to
“ them again; and now, out ,of her own mouth we
“ will condemn, her, if she will not verify her words.
“ For now we have got a line to .go b y ; ’but before
“ we had none ; for it was out of our power to tell
“ whether her visitation came from the Lord, or
“ from whence it cam e; but now she hath told us
**the Trance is a Sign, we will try the truth ©f her

And from on high they shall all find it : for now I ’
tell thee, from these three days the shaddw is begun ;
but the substance will end to its likeness. The first
day thou felt, confusion, faint, and trembling, con­
fined to thy bed ; the second day a day of joy with
thy friends, *in love and harmony; the' third day
thou went faint and trembling, though in good
spirits, supported by thy friends ; but when my Spirit
arose within thee, thou hadst strength to go through,
and toletthy voice reach the multitude,to bring them
back to the Fall, while every .tongue was silent, and

was gone.

You'll find thesubstance drawing near ;

That men will judge, and they will sea
That thou art laidupon thy bed,

With saintsand angels full of love;
For as thoupast the second day

Just so injoy thy soul will be,
With saints and angels all to see

But sick ofit thou'lt surely grow.
Just like this day, I well do know;
Thou didst taste the water andthewine,
And now thy sickness call to mind,

And so in silence all will be .
When thou retum'st the crowd to see;
And by thee I shall surely stand,
As thou wast guarded here by man,
And strong within thee I shall bursts
1 gave thee strength to stand the first.
But then in power I shall appear,
And strong my Bible I shall clear,
And tell them how the Promise stood'
That I at first made for their good.
So as the shadow did begin,

After this was read, some time was passed in a ge­
neral discussion; it was then announced that the as­
sembly was to meet to-morrow at three in the af­
ternoon, so that Joanna might devote the morning
to the selection of such of her writings as were to be
sealed up till after her death; and then the proceed­
ings of this day were closed at eight in the evening.

THE FIFTH DAY.
SUNDAY, DECEMBER 3, 1804.
T he proceedings for this day commenced at four
in the afternoon, by calling over the names of the*
assembly, and Jdanna entered soqn after. The
reading of former communications, explanatory of
her mission, took up some time ; and then the ex­
amination of the writings was resumed, in order to
select those that were to be sealed up till after the
death of Joanna ; and this was followed by the read­
ing ofa communication given this day, being as fol­
lows :
“ Now, Joanna, I shall direct thee ; for the way
thou art going on to look through thy writings
thou canst not accomplish it by the days that are
fixed ; for know, I told thee, what is sealed not to'
be revealed, must be sealed by the seventh day.
So let the parcel be cut that Sharp brought thee j
and when it is cut, 1 shall tell thee what shall
be sealed up for good, in that and in the others:
and thy work must be done in haste ; for I have
other communications to give unto thee, before thou
meetest the public ; therefore, thou hast but little
time to spend with friends. Let them have the
communications, weigh them together, and pass
their judgments thereon. So when the whole are
assembled together, let the seals be c u t; then bring
up the whole, and search them through ; place them
as I command thee, to be sealed. And ‘let them
draw their judgment from what is said of Jacob’s
sons, and what is said of men’s refusing my call,
but falling down by my wisdom. Now let them all
observe, my call hath been refused, my invitation

hath been refused ; but my wisdom hath been con­
cealed till now; but now my wisdom shall fly
abroad; then let the learned see if they can overthrow

Forto keep Iifeln thee,
I tell them, No; they’ll find ft so,
To see all in the end,
They’ll find the truth of all to
And I shall make them bend;
Because behind, hath been my mind,
To make them all submit,
As they have all been so unkind,
A Calling thus so great,
Never to go the truth to know,
Whether the thing was true,
• And so their learning they’ve let low,
Though boasting’s in their view;
But boast no more till all be clear,
For every tongue I'll stop.
Because the Trial must appear
To make their learning drop.
Can they contend like simple men#
To speak against thy hand,
When I’ve told them all so plain
The way they may command
The whole to know, if it be so,
And in one day appear ?
Because thy Trance, they now shall know*
The way I’ll end it here ;
But had it come by thy weak hand,
As thou wish’d Jt at first.
Thy Trial thou’dst not stand by men
When they against thee burst.
"Now from thy weakness I’ll begin,
Thy nature so is here,
And so thy Trance will bring thy end,
And bring thy death-bed near.
So all too late they’ll see their fate,
That grieve thee at the first,
And they will find thou art too weak
In words with them to burst;
' So ail thy foes they now may know,
And from thy weakness see,
It is too late for them to go
Then reconcil'd tobe.
From whatis past thy dream must burst,
The skivers do appear *,
That they are placing in thy breast,
/ And so thy end draws near,
To make thegrave, behold the cave, 1
They make thy wounds go deep;

Tis time thy foes should weepj _
for as thy days are hastening on,
They’ll find ’tis drawing near;
And feist thy foes, I say, will com* ■

To prove ifall be clear.
So now discern the way I warn—
Inviting’sall in rain;
And they may fearthis rising storm-*
But 1 shall all explain,
A mystery deep (they all may weep)
The Marriage of the Lamb.
My invitation they did break,
And so refus’d to come.
Now if they call, I tell them all,
Their calling will not do;

no more for to appear;
My invitation’s past;
My chosen men I now shall clear*
That here in love do burst. •
When 1did invite they did notslight*
But all with joy did come;
And I must ill their love requite*
If I should cast out one. .
With fishermen I did begin 5
They left their nets for m e ; 1 • -
And now my Kingdom for to win
They do the same agree.
So on record (marknow my word)

The twelve did firstappear5
And ’tis thy Jury must agree
Their honour for to clear.
* So for the rest I this shall fix,
They are the twenty-four
That must appear the whole to cleat*
Then they shall feel my power.
So nowdiscern how this is come
Just like my Gospel penn’d ;
And all together you must weigh,
Then judge and see the end.
My wisdom here the whole shall clear* •

After reading this Joanna entered into an interesting
account of many parts of her prophecies, which col­
lectively afforded a clear view of her awful Trial be­
fore men, as distinct from this Trial, to which she
has been called by the Lord. She then adduced
Scripture proofs of her mission being the fulfilment
Of the prophecies of the establishment of the king­
dom of Christ. The manner of the Gospel dispensa­
tion coming round contrary to the judgment of the
disciples wasajso referred to, as a parallel to the dif­
ferent opinions formed by herself and friends, respect­
ing the ways of the Lord now through her. Joanna
then expatiated on the various reports that the publi­
city of the Trance would give rise to, and on other
particulars connected with her being brought before
men. Here she emphatically declared that she must
stand or fall by the voice of this assembly, by the
judgment now passed concerning her mission. This
subject waffurther pressed to our attention, by saying
that we must give our decided opinion upon thft
whole of the proceedings to-morrow, and that in
writing, with' the respective 'signature of each indi­
vidual thereto. Here she then enumerated these
leading points touching her mission, which were left
for the decision of the assembly :— That the calling
Was of God.— The justice of it, in claiming the Pro­
mise made to the Woman in the Fall— The justice
of casting the Curse on Satan, so that his head should
be bruised— That Christ had not seen the travail of
his soul to be satisfied— Had not seen accomplished

th e day of vengeance in his heart— That Christ died/
unjustly; therefore'it was right for the author of all
evil to suffer, through the means of the Woman, and
by her enmity, for betraying her in the beginning.
She then pleaded her own sincerity, and drew this
general inference, from the manner in which the
Scriptures were explained to her, the agreement of
her writings therewith, the fulfilment of her prophe­
cies, and from other proofs, that the whole was the
work of the Lord. When Joanna had concluded
this address, the resolutions passed by the assembly
after the examination of the witnesses were read to
her. §he then made a most eloquent, though simple
appeal, whether the Lord would let her go on in de­
lusion ; she then described her present weak state of
health, and her mode of life ; and having concluded
this interesting appeal to the judgment of the assem­
bly, Joanna retired in a high flow of spirits, at about
half past five. ,
When Joanna had nearly closed her discourse, she
was interrupted by a member asking, whether Satan
knew he was cast by this Trial? for then he would pur­
sue her and her friends with the utmost of his Airy.
, This was answered by the following communication,
given to her after she had retired, and sent in to be
read before the meeting was adjourned.
“ Now I shall apswer thee of Hows. His observation
was just, to say that Satan did not know his casting
would be before thy awful T rial; but now he know-
eth he is cast; and now he will come down in great
wrath, and stir up the people to come against thee;
for he knows his time is short. And he is cast in the
manner I told thee, that he would not have a friend
present to speak for him, as Pilate did for m e ;
but had unbelievers been present, they would have
pleaded against the Promise. Then how could the
Promise have been claimed ? But notor they were

♦ This story is as follows: a man asked a king, what he would
/give for a piece of advice. The king answered, five hundred pounds.
The man then said it was, that he should do nothing without well

the words engraved oaall his plate. It so happened, that the king
wanted to be bled; and the surgeon who was to do itwas bribed fa

Turn the poison backon him; ,
If he made it first for me,
It shall sure turn back on he, .
For the coat he now shall wear.}
All the poison now I’ll clear, ,
Jt is the guilt of every man, ,
On his back it now shall come$
So I’d have him see the end,
Mark the lines that thou hast penn’d ;
Drop the lances from his hand,
If he longer wish to stand,
And tempt men to sin no more,
Confess the guilt lie’th done before ;
For if I vengeance took on Mau,

N otice having been given at the last public
meeting, that Joanna would appear in the like man­
ner this day, it being a fine morning the assembly,
accordingly met in the field, and was joined by Jo­
anna and her female friends precisely at eleven. A f­
ter a short time had been passed in devotion, Jo­
anna began to address the. public, giving a brief ac- ■
count of her mission, and then she emphatically
warned her .audience of the near approach of the
kingdom of Christ.. , In the middle of her.discourse,
a' multitude of people, who were not believers in her
calling, ,and who were, admitted into the adjoiniug
ground, separated from us by a canal, found a paling
at the west extremity, which they broke down and
thus entered. Therefore a number of Joanna’s friends
hastened to that point to prevent such intrusion; *
but the stream appeared too violent to be effectually
stemmed, and ail attempts to do so were relinquish­
ed, and many promising to be peaceable, the in­
truders quietly mixed with u s; at the same time,
the gate at the east end was opened, and the rest
rushed in, upon some of them promising to be or­
derly, but others were of evil intentions to produce
confusion and disorder. About half past eleven a few
drops of rain began to fall, and dark clouds rolling
on, the sun, which till then cheered us with his
beams, became obscured; and at that moment Jo­
anna concluded her address with words to this e f­
fect : that she was then commanded to depart— that
the sunshine was a token for her friends; but for the
enemies of the approaching kingdom qf Christ came

the stofni. Thus,the infernal intentions o f the crib*
thy were frustrated* and she departed with hef
friends to the house ; and the proceedings were re­
sumed at about half past twelve, Wheii the purport o t
t he resolutions, which are to terminate the Trial*
were taken into consideration * and soon after four in
the afternoon, a draft of them was read for furthef
remarks. And then Joanna brought in a commu­
nication, given in answer to her account of the.
meeting in the held, and whifch was read* being as
follows:
- This is the seventh day Of Joanna’s Trial, andt
the sixth day of her appearance, when she went into
the field to meet the multitude* On Saturday, the.
8th instant, she met them in M r, Carpenter’s meet*
inrg, where She told them she should meet them again
on the Tuesday j but Was afterwards answered, if*
the crowd was too great for the meeting she should
meet them'm the Open field. The crowd gathered
too great for the meeting, and she was obliged to
meet in the field, that was enclosed, but in an -
adjoining field that the canal parted, there were ga-*-
thered crowds of mockers; and many brake into the
field, and Joanna’s heart was deeply affected, as she
was ordered to call to her remembrance the" yeat
ninety-two, when the power of the Lord visited her
so strongly, that she could not abide in a house, but
Went out in the open field to dispute with the power%.
of darkness, and after they left her, she was sur­
rounded with a company of angels. This struck
deep uport her, and called to her remembrance
the different spirits thefe were in men; some had
the spirits of angels, to guard and protect her ; some
were filled with the spirit of the Devil, to destroy
her if they could. This she knew, and this shy
fe k ; but the Spirit of the Lord arose strong within .
her, and gave her strength to speak to the multi­
tude. The weather, for the season, was remarka*
till- she bod nearly ended ,hex discourse.

then began drops of rain, and the clouds behind
looked very black ; then she dismissed the whole, ‘
only telling them to fear the storm. Guarded
by her male friends she went safely through. The
mob behind her were very invective ■
>
with their
tongues, but had not power to injure her, or her
friends. Some wished to trample her under their
feet, and other's wished to throw her into the canal,
others said they, hoped the constables had got her ;
the answer .was by some man, he did not want the
constables to have her, if he could but get hold of
her ; a woman cried out, if this be religion it. was
time to put a stop to it. These and many other,
things were said respecting her, aS we came out of th e .
field ; however she got safely through, without re­
ceiving any insult, as they did not know her. W hen
she came to the house in safety crowds of friends came
to the door, and though being fatigued, she went
out to shake hands with them, till the rain came tho
second time.
THE ANSWER OF THE LORD, ‘
“ Now, Joanna, thee I’ll answer,
. From the shadow of this, day,
Jah, Jehovah is thy master,
Let them hear what I do say,
On every side the field is wide,
The Type stands deep for Man $

When strong my Spirit did visit thee*

He could not stay thy hand,
As from hUpower I dia thee shield,
And n;atle my angets come

And so thou turnedst home.

was condemned by the world at large, the bishops
and clergy were appealed toj for any twenty-four to
come against the aforesaid twenty-four ; and if they
could prove this calling not of God, it was to be given
up to their judgment. This being declined by the
bishops and clergy, and a report being given out
that the books came from other men, with Joanna
Southcott’s signature, she was ordered to call for­
ward her witnesses, and have every truth fairly prov­
ed, and tried, that every thing came through her,
that is gone out in the world in her name ; and if
the clergy refused to come forward, she was ordered
to go out in the highways and hedges and compel

number, as before, the truth might be established.
To see this truth cleared up, men came from distant
pints of the kingdom; and Joanna was answered, their
labour of love should not be in, vain in the Lord ;
for as twenty-four ministers could not be obtained to
come forward to be witnesses of the truth, and judge
from what spirit it came, the following twenty-four

of God, no man hath appeared to overthrow it. So
where is the man that can condemn me now ? U n­
less he will come forth like the Serpent, and say,
thou shalt not obey the command of the Lord ; for
. now I tell all men, worse than the Serpent men must
appear, that wish me to act contrary to my own
knowledge, faith, and conscience } for where is the
man that can answer forme in the hour of death,

that began the work hath carried it on, and brought
the whole to the Gospel ? And no man hath come
against me ; the Lord hath been with me, according
to his Promise. W hen I look backward, and nour
that I look forward, I see the wisdom of God shin­
ing bright in every line, in h is direction and pro­
tection to me $ then where is my adversary that
•wishes me to provoke my God, when he hath never
forsaken nor deserted me, but kept me in on every
side from the wrath of men and devils ? though
both with fury would seek my life ; but it hath been
hid with God in Christ. And now let men try to
put me to confusion by the Signs I shall set before
them ; for what hath been concealed shall now be
revealed of the Sign set to my enemies.—
Now if my foes will try the cause once more*
Then of themselves 1bid them now appear,

To sec in man what now there will appear*
When I’ve made public every Sign so clear*
When friends ana foes do all together meet
To try the calling, if there is deceit.—
And now I shall give the lines at large spoken ia
ninety-four, when 1 was ordered to write to the clergy
at Exeter, that when they ill came forward to try
the cause, friends and foes, it was said—
“ When thou seest the seals are all brought in,
The lighted candles in their sockets burn,
Then in thy wonder thou wilt stand amaz’d,
And round the room thou’lt in confusion gaze ;
And then thou’lt say, thesethingsare for thee too high*
And by thy weakness thou wilt faint away ;
But then for coffins let them none prepare,
But change thy dream and now forbid it here."
Again in ninety-six when it was said that man
would detnand the truth of roe-—
“ And surely make thee brave the storm,
. ■
' , And mind no fainting here;
Then when my Jury all do meet,
Part of the time ’twill be

more regular order when I find it in my books :— .
but know before this comes, it is said in my writings,
I shall provoke them to anger and jealousy, to bring
on my awful Trial.—

Thy nature is too weak $
Then down thy life I’d freely lav,
No man hath it boom to take.
Such Trial thou shalt never bear
As John and I went through ;
I'd sooner take thee to my care,
And give mankind their due.
Now 1 shall shew thee, from these words, “ tak­
ing thy life from t h e e I shall throw thee in a
Trance, when thy accusers come against thee, to
put it out of their power to abuse thee ; but for the
sake of thy friends and believers, and to make known
unto them my firm decrees, I shall return thee to
the world again. So friends and foes mu6t be to­

their sockets; and then know what is said, when

will happen at thy death ; as I told thee thy death

wine and cakes were brought in, to be administered

May I drink deep into the Spirit of Christ;
Ani may his Blood cleanse me from all sin!

Now let all the believers join with thee in heart
and tongue ; let the wine be poured into one cup,
and let it be handed round by the ministers; but
let the words be repeated by every one that drink-

For though this is not a sacrament, yet let this be
the desire of their hearts, if they wish for a double
portion of my Spirit to be poured out upon them
hereafter; for all that they have seen and heard,
and any joy that they have felt, is but a shadow of
what is to come ; and let them know, from my dis­

to thee; all must, come through thee; and thou
standest the Trial for the whole/'
. After every one had drank, and returned the cup,
Joanna pronounced these words :— “ As we all have
drank in Ofie cup, may we drink into one faith, and
• may that faith be in Christ!” This solemn and af­
fecting ceremony being concluded, Joanna delivered
a most impreflive discourse upon the general tenor of
i her mission, which brought her to this Trial. After
. this, she spoke on the accomplishment of her mission
Digitized by
by her awful Trial before m en; and in so doing her
principal object was to impress on her friends a cau­
tion against entertaining any sentiments, which
tended to exalt her, or themselves, in consequence
of being called to .this mission : For, said she— “ I
am but the clay in the hands o f the potter.'— And
ias to her being called the Bride— “ This is but the
shadow in one o f what the substance will be to a l l ,
when the Bbidegroom cometh.” She dwelt with
peculiar energy on this point; and which, it is
hoped, made a due impression upon the mind o f
every one present.
At nine o’clock Joanna sealed up the writings,
which are to be kept till after her death, and the
signatures and seals of several present were also add­
ed ; and the packet was then delivered into the
possession of one of the judges.
After this, as a part of the ceremony before de­
scribed, Joanna handed cakes to her female friends,
Vhich they broke among one another in token of love
and friendship; and the men helped themselves far
the same purpose, and then all was a scene of joy and
mirth, in the midst of which Joanna took a final
leave of her friends and retired.
The proceedings were then resumed by taking
the ultimate Resolutions into consideration again,
when they were agreed to unanimously, and then a
fair copy having been prepared it was read at half
past eleven, being as follows: '

nications emanate wholly and entirely from the Spirit
of the living Lord : and happily encouraged by this
belief pray, as we ought to do, that our Saviour
Jesus Christ may exercise his power oh earth for the
destruction of sin, and the removal of Satan, who is

Because it appears to us, that that passage in the
Scripture is now fulfilled, where the kingdom o f
heaven is likened unto a woman’s having a little
leaven, which she was to hide in three measures o f
m eal; and because this likeness is now accom­
plished, by Joanna Southcott’s three Trials, called by
the command of the Lord: namely, the first Trial
held in Exeter, for seven days, in the Christmas of
1801, when the word of God was leavened by the
Truth ; the second held at the High House, Pad­
dington, for seven days, commencing January the
12th, 1803, when it was leavened again by the
T ruth; and the third held at the Neckinger House,
Bermondsey, near London, for seven days, com­
mencing December the 5th, and ending this day,
December the l lth, 1804, when the word of God
was aga n leavened by the Truth.
Because it appears to us, that Man’s temporal
Redemption can never take place, before the Spirit
of the Lord comes to clear the Woman from the
Fall, as is promised in the third ohapter of Genesis,
of her seed’s bruising the serpent’s head.
Because it appears to us, this must be fulfilled in
one Woman, first as a shadow, before the substance
comes to all.
Because it appears to us, this must be accom­

as promised in the Creation.
Because it appears to us, from a close and candid
investigation of Joanna Southcott’s Writings, com­
paring them with the Scripture of Truth, that she is
fully empowered, by the Spirit of Christ, to claim
that Promise made to the Woman in the Creation,
and now revealed to her, that her seed should bruise
Satan’s heat^*.
Because this Prophecy must be accomplished,
that our Blessed Lbrd may see theTravail of his Soul
and -be satisfied; and may have that Day of Ven­

Because with joy and gladn,ess we join the W o-

the Year of his Redeemed may come.
Because it appears to us, that Satan’s head has
never yet been bruised, and that the sentence passed
upon him at the Fall hath never been accomplished.
Because it appears to us, that that Prophecy of
Bruising the Heel of our Blessed Lord hath been ful­
filled, when the Powers of Darkness worked in the
hearts of Men to murder our Saviour Jesus Christ.
Because it appears to us, that the great seducer of
the Woman’s innocence at first, and in all ages since
the Fall, has been the cause of murders, lies, and
every crime; and now is revealed by the Spirit of
Christ to the Woman, to be the Man of Sin, and
the Son of Perdition, working in every human heart
to be at enmity against their God.
Because it appears to us, that the Promise made
at the Creation, for the Woman to be the Helpmate
to Man, is now fulfilling, through Christ, the Cor­

and whose divine Love and Pity were superior,to

Because it appears to us, that the Day ofVengeance,
which Christ had in his heart,' must be to turn it
back on Satan, who worked in the Man to cast the

The follow ing Remarks made by Joanna on the pro­
ceedings o f her Trial, and Communications there­
on, are, by her direction, inserted here, to conclude
the Book.
The Book of my Trial not being hastily printed, I
have had an opportunity of looking over my sealed
writings, wherein I can prove to the world, that in
the years 1796 and 1797> I was perfectly foretold of
the unbeliefof the Methodists in general; how they
would act like the unbelieving Jews, who believed
they were Abraham’s seed, and had no need of a
Saviour ; and, that just so were the self-righteous
Christians at this day, who believe they have an in­
terest in Christ, and wanted no warning of his com­
ing, but judged they were the righteous that it
should go well with ; and, like the Jews of old, they
would mock the warning. This astonished me at
the time ; But seeing the truth verified the more
. astonishes me now; how it is possible that men call­
ed Christians can see the judgments that have been
already in our land, and see the distressed situation
our country is now in, with the sword hanging over
our heads ; that men can be so bold and confident
as to mock in the midst of dangers, and professors o f
religion now hardening men’s hearts to tell them
there are none ! This appears marvellous in my eyes;
yet it verifies and fulfils my prophecies. At the same
dates, I was told of the conduct of the clergy of the
Church o f England, how they would be like the fruit
that was fallen with a black veil round them * ; and
yet it would come to the standard of the church ;
for by the church ministers the good fruit would be
brought in, and from them the good fruit would
spring —

** Back totheChurch the standard all must come.”
Now if men weigh all the conduct of the church -
ministers together they must see the truth of both :
though the$e are but shadows that are printed, to
what is in my sealed writings. Now it must be made
known unto all men, that my writings went first out '
into the world, by the judgment of the Rev. Mr.
Pomeroy, in 1801; as he ordered me to cut the
seals, and have some copied out and sent to him ;
and his command I was ordered to obey, and write
to four ministers besides, for them to judge of the
writings ; but as they refused, they were put in print
by Mr. Pomeroy’sjudgment alone, after he had them
in his possession more than a fortnight; he gave them
- Himself into my hands, as I before had told him they
must go in print; and to which he made answer,
that he could not blame me. Then all~must know he
must justify me ; for in a cause like this, if it is not
blameable it is justifiable. If it be of the Devil it is
blameable to go out in the world ; if it be from a
disordered head, or a farrago of nonsence, it is still
blameable; but if it be of God it is not blameable.
And this was Mr. Pomeroy’s judgment at first; and
by his judgment they went out in the world, as I was
commanded by the Lord ; as no minister came for­
ward to condem them. Now the world might say, how
Came Mr. Pomeroy to go from his first judgment ?
T answer, in so doing he hath fulfilled a prophecy
that was given to me in 1797, that if he turned back
to deny like Peter, it would be for the fear of men
that would mock him. Now I can prove to the
whole world I have now found this in my sealed
writings, which in many places speak of his falling
back ; and he hath since verified the truth ; for he
told me himself, at the end of the year 18G1, how
much he was mocked by the clergy, which made him
deny all his former words ; and the truth about him
was all foretold. Now I shall come further to the -
standard of the Church. After my writings went out in
S 2

THE TRfA.Ii 09 ■
the world no preachers of any religion came forward*’
l>ut the three ministers of the established Church ;
though some men of other religions came after and
joined them, when they were assembled.to prove my
writings. And now it is come to the fulfilment of
the Gospel: the third time that the Lord hath called
it forward, different sects and parties of religion ap­
peared ; but there wds no minister of any religion but
of the Church, that joined the other twenty-four. So
here the church ministers stand at the head of each
Trial, according to the prophecies before given to
me. Now I shall appeal to every man’s conscience,
if I had been an impostor, or if my writings came
from the devil, or any spirit that was not from the
Lord, would all have come so perfectly true ? and
the hearts of all men be foretold to me ? or are they
all known to the devil ? I can assure them they were
not known to me, till revealed to me by the Spirit.
But had I been left to draw my own judgment, I
should have thought the Methodists would have
been thefirst that would have come in, because they
Jretend to preach of the visitation of the Lord; but
was told they did not believe what they preached t
and true I have found it. Now I have another obser­
vation to make to man : Had my Trial been fixed by
the devil, that when friends and foes did meet to­
gether, that is believers and unbelievers, that he
would throw me in a Trance, as it is said in 1.796,
when they meet in this manner—
“ I shall throw thee in aTrance,
And shew thee mv decrees,
And how the books are seal’d abovt
That thou hast seal’d below ;
And how my Spirit it doth move—
Then thou wilt surely know,
And then thy G uide thou’lt surely see.
That, f'Vh with thee converse; *
Then every mystery thou shalt know,
That hath disturb’d thy breast.”
Now if this Trance was placed by the devil, and
^f six or eight strong opposers and unbelievers were
140
Digitized by
psesent, do men vainly believe, tbat die Lord had
not so many men whose hearts he could influence to
come forward and confound the whole, by calling
the Trance forward ? and if that did not appear,
to publish to the world it was all a delusion, for
they had come to the standard of my writings, when
enemies, opposers, and friends, were all present to­
gether, and nothing had then happened to convince
the unbelievers, they must then have confounded
the whole. Now it cannot be said, the hearts of all
men are in the hands of the Lord, if this calling
came from any wrong spirit, and the Lord could not
bring forward six or eight men to prove it so, to con­
found the devil, and to prove this calling was not
from the L o rd ; for the eye of the Lord is every
where present, and from whatever spirit my writings
■ Came, he knew better how they stood than I did,
and hath acted in every way to make them perfectly
true, contrary to my judgment: but if men will say it
■ isnot the Lord’s doing, then they must put all the
knowledge and power of God out of the question,
and say, the whole world lieth in the wicked one,
the devil; but, as it is written— “ the hearts of all
men are in the hands of the L o r d a n d , “ it is I the
Lord that worketh in the hearts of my people to will
and to do of my good pleasure,”— Now I must ap­
peal to all men’s consciences, who it was, that work­
ed: in the hearts of men that came forward to fulfil
the Gospel, and make my writings so perfectly true,
that men should thus strengthen me to go on ? And
now I affirm to the whole world, my hand is
strengthened by believers, and much more strength­
ened by the unbelievers; as it is marvellous in my
eyes, how the great professors of religion can so de­
part from the Gospel, and so much from their
own preaching, as they now do, so perfectly as I
was foretold. Now if they will say this was from
the devil, they must say their hearts were known to
the devil,, and that they are a people unknown to

the Lord: but this prophecy is now fulfilled to my
Astonishment; and all the conduct of these pretended
Christians is foretold, as well as the events-of all
nations : for when I look to my writings, that have
been so many years sealed up, I find in them every
thing is so foretold. And now I shall come to ano­
ther observation: It was never my wisdom to keep
my writings sealed u p ; but by the directions o f the
Spirit, from whose revelations I have known all things,
they were ordered to be sealed up, and so many wit­
nesses placedto see the truth. Now when the world had
made so many false reports, that I was an impostor, it
was by the wisdom of the same Spirit, to have all these
witnesses called forward to clear my honour, prove
my upright dealings, and put all my enemies to
shame ; that is, to prove them liars, which shews my
enemies are led by the devil, and from him their
malice comes. Now I must be void of reason, and
so must every man, to believe that the devil would
so wisely and prudently direct me to go on to clear
my own conscience, and to confound all my ene­
mies ; for I now defy the learned world, and all the
boasted Christians upon earth, to prove from the Bi­
ble, that they have acted'so consistent with the rules
o f the Law and the Gospel, with the rules of God
and man, as I have acted by the direction of the
Spirit, that hath strongly visited me from 1792 to
this day ; so if men will say this Spirit is from the
devil, they must say there is more justice, more ho­
nour, honesty, and upright dealings in him than
there is in man. But it would be blasphemy in me,
of the blackest die, if I was to place this upright
dealing to the devil, in whom I believe there is no
honour, no justice, nor truth; and I am sorry to
say, I see too much of his spirit amongst mankind,
save those who acted according to the Scriptures,
and like the disciples of old, made diligent search
to seek into every truth, and weighed the whole with
the tenor of the Bible, and drew their judgment
1 4 2

therefrom, believing God to be the God of Truth ;
that he would fulfil at last what he promised at first;
and this'belief was placed in the hearts of all the
men that were present.
But one thing more appears marvellous in my eyes:
Many women were present who before were full of
unbelief but the Lord shewed no wondrous work­
ing to convince them, nor ever promised to do it
to convince women, if forty had been present; and
yet he hath premised to shew his wondrous works
for the sake of t e n m e n . This appears marvellous
in my eyes, more so than all my writings, that as
this visitation is to a Woman, that the Lord never
promised any wondrous working to convince the un­
belief o f women; but all his promises are to con­
vince the unbelief of men, if they come forward to
search into the Truth through unbelief. A t this I
still marvel.
THE ANSWER OF THE LORD.
. “ Now, Joanna, I shall answer thee. I said,
when thou hadst drawn thy judgment, I should an­
swer thee again ; and now, from thy last judgment
thou hast drawn of women, I shall answer thee.
Know the woman was in the transgression; know
she gave it to the man, and drew him in to fall with
her ; and by the man the blame was cast on m e ,
for giving him the woman; then know it is the
man, and not the woman, that my working is to
convince. If the woman obeyed the serpent at first,
and knew the promise I made her, yet if she is still
determined to abide by her Fall, never claim the
Promise, never wish to have it fulfilled, but deter­
mines to abide in darkness; as she was the trans­
gressor to go on in her transgressions against G od
and m a n , what have I to do with the woman, to
work miracles to convince her ? Let women know,
it was not the man brought the Fall on her; but it
was the woman brought the Fall on man. It was
not the qian that was taken from the woman; but

man, and cast his blame on m e , for giying him the
woman, in justice to my own honour, and in jus­

did not give him the woman in vain. But what jus­

man might abide for ever under the condemnation
of the Fall, that she drew the man into, I have no'
honour to clear there; No ; my honour is to m a n ,

I'hen here the Woman stands condemn'd,
If she this way go on,
And say her Promise she’ll not claim.—
Butnow I’ll turn to Man;
So he and 1the cause must try
With women that do claim

To fall in deep despair;
My answer strong to them must comt,
As Satan would confound: "
You listen’d to his poisonous tongue,
Now tremble at the sound!
Can you appear against me here .
And say you him believ’d?
And now again for to maintain*
Your God will you deceive?
Satan at first that way did burst.
Persuade her I did lie;
No death on her there should be cast*
But they as gods should be.
So here with him she did begin,
But own’d she was betray’d ;
Then next my words must now be sden?
To cast it on his head;
So here my word ison record,
My Promise like the first;
But if again you mock your Lord,
And with the serpentburst—
Again I lie doth Satan say,
And make you this believe,
Then you may stumble in the way,
And Satan doth deceive.
So if you come with him tojoin,

You cannot answer, like the Man,

And said, when ripen’d, it would sure be good.
And to believers I shall all allude;
And now I tell thee they may ripen fast;
The fruit is fallen, and the veil is cast,
To see their hearts are wrinkl’dso within,
They judge their God hath nothing known orseeii
Of all the wondrous writings thou’st went through,
And now I’ll bring it plainer to thy view:
If they believe my Eye isevery where,
And yet let Satan make the Truth appear,
Then all my Bible they mayjudge the same,
And say from him thenall the Truth did come,
And now lie’s come for to fulfil the whole.
If he could tell thee how all this would fall,

1 4 9 THE TRIAL O f
And plainly shew thee all the hearts of men,
Before thou'st tried them how the end would come,
And say professed Christians thou would’stsee:
Just like the Jews of old did act with me,
The Geutiles now would act with thee the same.
And vet profess to love my every Name!
The.Jews profess'd to love their Lord at first,
And thought it right against the Son to burst;
And now the Gentiles they arejust the saine,
Against my Spirit they in rage are conic*
And all these things I told thee ofbefore,
The hearts of men, the tumults and the war,
The dearth and scarcity that would abound—
-
But now ’tis come to tremble at the sound,
Because the shadows all are past before,
You'll fiud the substance to be hastening near*
As from your conduct I do plainly see,
No man had love to try the cause for me,
But those that did believe it from their God;
Then here’s the fruit, it must to all be know’d,
That on the trees did unto thee appear,
And here's the fruit I in the end snail clear;
But how the fallen fruit can it now stand,
When I have brought the whole so plain to man ?
If that from Satan now thy writings be,
I’d not one Friend come forth inlove to me ;
But if front me thy writings surely come,
I have hut few that do regard my Name.
So by t{ieir mockery let them now to fear,
Aq<i from my Bible I shallanswer here :
A controversy I’ve held out with Man,
But to the purpose I shall surely come ;
Because, I tell them, I have long given ear
The words and arguments of men to hear;
So now, vain men, astonish’d you may be#
When I in anger break, mv fury see.
I’ve done a thing I never did before;
Xchose a Woman that was low and poor,
Without ahusband ever to protect;
And for Iver father, he could not direct,
Because his age and poverty was so,
Without assistance she alone did go,
But I did direct her to the Shepherds’ care ;
And now I ask them, how they’ll all appear,
To let a single Woman so go ou,
If they believ’d that she was acting wrong ?
Will they, like Adam, in that day appear,
And sav, "we judg'd the Lord had foil'd herhere^
" To let the tiuth with allher words agree,
"Though ’twas from Satan we did plainly see,
" And yet the truth we let it fly abroad ?”
Then let them hear the answer of their'Lord :•
The Woman I directed to your care,
And to yourjudgment, know, I told her here;
Digitized by L i O O Q i e
That all herwritings she should sure commit; '
And now l bid men answer, for ’tis great,
The truth and judgment that did then appear.
When all my friends they were assembled there,
And to theirjudgment shedid all submit:
And intheend you’ll find theirjudgment great.
But now before me 1ask how you’ll stand,
You bold impostors, to condemn her hand,
And judge a thing you would not know nor see?
I say, on men the blow turn’d back mustbe ;
For on their heads 1
*
1
1now turn back the blame.
Though Man atrfirst his Maker he did shame ;
But now at last I’ll surely shame you all—
1chose the Woman for to shewyour Fall,
And did direct her to the Shepherds’ care.
Once more I’ll ask them, how they’ll all appeaf i
None but my Shepherds can with courage stand.
Because l gave the Woman to their hands,
And to theirjudgment she w
r
ould all resign;
And will they dare to say the hand s not mine^
But she by Satan’s arts was so led on,
And you refus'd ever to stop her hand,
When she had promis’d all for to submit
l)nto your bauds ? then tremble at ^er feet l
for like the Serpent you must all appear,
To see her wrong and toencourage her.
As by your silence you have surely done;
And by your silence you have led her on,
And by your silence you the whole support, '
And will you say you did it to her hurt ?
Then to your hurt the Woman shall appear:
Tremble you shepherds for to meet her here i
If all these things you for her hurt design’d,
*Then forjour hurt I now shall tell my mind:
As A d a m first cast all the blame on me,
And after that men nail’d me to the tree ;
Then now at last I’ll cast the blame on you,
And judge what ruin must be in your view,
If now t turn the whole back on the man,
Because the Woman he doth here condemn.
Unseen, unheard, and know not why ’tis so.
To your weakjudgment would you have her go.
And say that blind men they shall lead her here ?
If she be blind, then they have room to fear,
Because like blind men they have led her on,
To judge of things they do not understand,
To judge of things they will not know nor see;
,Then sure as blind men must these shepherds b#,
That do pretend againsther for towrite,
And say’tis wrong the way that I indite,
Because you say the words are all too low ;
But nowl say if higher I should go,
To prove it plain the language come from Heaven,
I aakwhich way mankind could be forgiven,

As I have been commanded to put all particulars
ip print in my Trial, concerning the Rev. M r. Po­
meroy and me, I must observe to the readers, that
he fell back, perfectly as I was foretold in 1797, from
,<his own words to me ; therefore I may say of him,
as oar Saviour said unto Pilate, f: he that delivered
.me unto thee, hath the greatest sin and those mi­
nisters and gentlemen, who abused Mr. Pomeroy,
and mocked him for acting in the first place as a
worthy good minister, in my opinion, have a greater
f ''\ | i ij4han him.
Jan. 18, 1805. From Joanna Southcott.
TO THE PUBLIC.
In order that no part o f my conduct may appear
inconsistent, I think it necessary to inform the
public, that as Mr. Pomeroy declined answering
m y letter of October the 8th, 1804, which is print-
i ed with other letters to him, in the Book entitled,
1
^ i,(t^*J3liyiiBe>Communications,,? I wrote to him a se­
cond letter, using every argument to induce him
to come forward, and informing him I should im­
mediately apply to M r. Scott, an attorney, who, at
m y request, wrote twice to Mr. Pomeroy, previous
to the T rial; therefore his not appearing at the Trial,
and his silence iu not answering any letter, to vindi­
cate himself, proved him guilty; and as the witnesses
clearly proved that all Mr. Pomeroy’s assertions,
to injure Joanna Southeott’s character, werefalse %
and by their evidences convinced me, and all
that were present, o f the purity and innocence
o f her character; and since her sealed writings
have been opened, I find, in many parts of them,
his falling back clearly foretold ; any further trou­
ble, therefore, respecting Mr. Pomeroy, is un­
necessary.
