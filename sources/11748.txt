My wife asked me a question and I tried to answer, my mouth opened but I couldn't speak. The next thing I knew, I was looking at myself collapsing to the floor from what appeared to be the inside of a large, dark tube. Everything in front of me became dark and I lost sight of myself. Then a bright white light appeared behind me. I was not able to turn around and look into the light. Instead, the light started slowly enveloping me on either side, almost like fingers of light. I still didn't turn around to face it. Then everything went black. I had a brief moment when I opened my eyes enough to see the flashing lights of an emergency vehicle. The next thing I remember is waking up in the intensive care unit of a hospital connected to tubes and IVs.

This wasn't quite the end. Once I was out of the hospital and mobile again, I would get strange feelings now and then. I could feel them coming on. My mouth would water and taste metallic. I would become weak and begin to sweat. Then I would become aware of a tunnel - I couldn't see it, but I knew it was there and voices would emanate from it. Then it would be gone. A couple of times, I thought I recognized a voice or a word. I can't remember what was said.
