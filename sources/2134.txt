TO THE READER.
The object of the following pages, is, to exhibit in a con-
cise form, the History and Present State of the different
Sects of the Christian Religion, now in existence.
Throughout the work, no opinion is expressed re-
garding the merits or demerits of any peculiar Fiaith, the
intent being, to present the reader, with an unbiassed
narrative of facts, which have been selected from the
most recent and best authorities, and have been com-
piled with care.
The following pages, it is presumed, will greatly in-
terest the general reader, as well as those who read
solely for instruction. To reflect upon the origin, pro-
gress, persecutions, and final triumphs of True Religion,
over the darkness of ignorance, or the cruelties engen-
dered by superstition, cannot fail to excite in the mind
of every thinking Christian, an increased feeling of
veneration for his Faith, and of gratitude to the Supreme
Disposer of events, who has been pleased to terminate
the long night of error, and to purify the minds of men,
whose hands are no longer raised to persecute for re-
ligious differences, their fellow-men, but are grasped in
amity, to dispense the blessings of His " Holy Word,''
to the uttermost ends of the earth.

EVERY SECT OF THE
CHRISTIAN RELIGION.
ABYSSINIAN CHRISTIANS.
Origin.—The general conversion of the Abyssinians to
Christianity, is supposed to have taken place about the
fourth century. Tradition places it much earlier.
Progress.—In the seventh century, they embraced the
sentiments of the Monosophytes ; and were looked upon
as a pure church.
In the fifth century, the Portuguese having opened a
passage into the country of the Abyssinians, this was se-
lected as a favorable opportunity to extend the influence of
the Roman Pontiff. The same important commission was
also given to several Jesuits, but both missions failed,
the Abyssinians remaining firm to the faith of their
ancestors.
About the commencement of the seventeenth century,
the Portuguese Jesuits renewed the mission to Abyssinia,
but their cause was ruined by the intemperate zeal of one of
the Abyssinians, whom they had created a Patriarch. Since
that period, every attempt made by the Romanists to regain
a footing in Abyssinia has proved unsuccessful.
The Christian population, of which the priests are sup-
posed to form the twentieth part, is said to amount to
3,000,000 ; and but few members of this church are to be
found in other countries.
Tenets.—The Abyssinian Church receives the holy
Scriptures, as the perfect and the only rule of faith and
practice. They worship one God in Trinity ; they believe
B
2 ABYSSINIAN CHRISTIANS.
in the incarnation of the Son of God ; that Christ is per-
fect God and perfect man ; and that His merits are suffici-
ent for eternal salvation. They admit that the Holy
Spirit, though a distinct person, equally existed from
eternity with the Son, as with the Father ; but they main-
tain that He proceedeth from the Father only.
Rites and Ceremonies.—Their festivals and saints are
numberless. As they celebrate the Epiphany with peculiar
festivity, in commemoration of Christ's baptism, and
sport in ponds and rivers, some have supposed they un^
dergo baptism every year. One of their saints* days is
consecrated to Balaam's ass ; another to Pilate and his
wife ; because Pilate washed his hands before he pro-
nounced sentence on Christ, and his wife desired him " to
have nothing to do with the blood of that just person.^'
They have four seasons of Lent ; the great Lent com-
mences ten days earlier than ours, and is observed with
so much severity that many abstain even from fish, be-
cause St. Paul says, " there is one kind of flesh of men,
and another of fishes.*'
Prayer for the dead is common, and invocation of saints
and angels ; and such is their veneration for the Virgin,
that they charged the Jesuits with deficiency in this
respect.
On going to church, persons put oflf their shoes before
they enter the outer precinct. Devotees kiss the thresh-
old or the two door-posts, on entering : they then enter,
and say what prayer they please, and their individual
duty is over.
Excommunication in Abyssinia, expressly prohibits the
person on whom it is pronounced from kindling a fire,
and every one else is restricted from supplying him with
fire or water. No one can speak, eat or drink with him,
enter his house, or suffer him to enter his own. He can
neither buy, sell, nor recover debts ; and if he were slain
by robbers, no inquiry would be made into the cause of
his death, nor would his body be allowed to be buried.
ANTINOMIANS.
Origin.—The founder of this sect was John Agricola,
Saxon divine: having obtained a professorship at
ANTINOMIANS. J
Wittemberg, he first taught Antinomianism there, about
the year 1535, his doctrine being—that the Law is no-
wise necessary under the gospel ; that good works do not
promote our salvation, nor ill ones hinder it ; that repent-
ance is not to be preached from the decalogue, but only
from the gospel.
They derive their name from anti against, and nomos
law, as being against the moral law ; not merely as a
covenant of life, but also as a rule of conduct to believers.
Progress.—This sect sprung up among the Presbyte-
rians in England during the protectorate of Oliver Crom-
well, who was an Antinomian. About the same time it
obtained many converts among the Churchmen in America,
where it prevails considerably at the present day.
During the last century, its doctrine was embraced by
some of Mr. Whitfield's preachers and others, and subse-
quently by William Huntington, who was acknowledged
as the head of the sect, and the celebrated Dr. Hawker, of
Plymouth, who it is believed was the first of his school,
who avowed himself an Antinomian and gloried in the
name. To the influence of his preaching and writings,
may be ascribed the spread of these opinions in the West
of England, chiefly within the pale of the Established
Church, which led in 1818 to the secession of several
clergymen from the Establishment, who formed them-
selves into a distinct body of " Separatists.''
The Antinomians are supposed to be an increasing sect,
both in England and Wales.
Tenets.—The following are the principal doctrines
which bear the appellation of Antinomian ;
—
I. That justification by faith, is no more than a mani-
festation to us of what was done before we had a being.
II. That men ought not to doubt of their faith, or
question whether they believe in Christ.
III. That by God's laying our iniquities upon Christ,
and our being imputed righteous through Him, he became
as completely sinful as we, and we as completely righteous
as Christ.
IV. That believers need not fear either their own sins,
or the sins of others, since neither can do them any
injury.
V. That the new covenant is not made properly with us,
but with Christ for us ; and that this covenant is all of it
b2

a promise, having no conditions for us to perform; for
faith, repentance, and obedience are not conditions on our
part, but on Christ's ; and that He repented, believed, and
obeyed for us.
VI. That sanctification is not a proper evidence of justi-
fication—that our righteousness is nothing but the impu-
tation of the righteousness of Christ.
ARMENIANS.
Origin.—The Armenian Church dates its foundation
from the beginning of the fourth century, when according
to the native annals, Tiridates the Great, with a large por-
tion of his subjects, received baptism from St. Gregory,
surnamed Loosavorich, or " The Enlightener.'*
Progress.—In the beginning of the sixth century, the
Armenian Church seceded from the Greek Church, of which
they formed a branch, and became independent. From that
period, Armenia has undergone many revolutions, that have
affected their religion m.ore or less.
The Armenian Church was shaken to its foundations in
the seventeenth century, by the barbarous policy of Shah
Abbas, king of Persia, who forcibly transplanted thousands
of Armenian families to different parts of Persia, laying
waste all that part of Armenia that was contiguous to his
dominions, in order to place an unpeopled wilderness be-
tween his realms and those of his Ottoman rivals. In the
general emigration that ensued, the m^ore opulent Arme-
nians removed to Ispahan, where the Persian monarch
granted them a residence, with the free exercise of their
religion, and where they have a considerable monastery
(the seat of a bishop) at this day. The successors of this
monarch were not equally generous. Persecution ensued,
and many of them apostatized to the Mohammedan re-
ligion. On the other hand, their numbers greatly increased
in different parts of Europe, where a vast proportion of
Armenians had fixed their residences for the purposes of
commerce, and who were not unmindful of their brethren
in the East. From Amsterdam, Marseilles, and Venice,
they were supplied with Armenian translations of the holy
Scriptures, and other theological books. These being judi-
ARMENIANS. 5
ciously dispersed among the Armenians who Hved under the
Persian and Turkish governments, contributed to preserve
the numerical strength of the sect.
Besides the religious societies of the Armenians in their
own country, and in Turkey, where they are very nume-
rous, they are to be found in every principal city in Asia.
They are the general merchants of the east, and are in
a state of constant motion from Canton to Constantinople.
They are settled in all the principal places of India, w^here
they arrived many centuries before the English. The com-
merce of Persia is chiefly conducted by Armenians. They
are also very numerous in Russia,—at Petersburgh, Mos-
cow, and Astrachan, and are to be found in the Caucasian
governments. They have besides, small societies in Lon-
don and Amsterdam.
Wherever they colonize, they build churches, and are
exemplary in their conduct and religious observances.
According to the latest and most exact returns, the Ar-
menian nation numbers about 1,700,000 souls, who, previ-
ously to recent territorial changes, were thus distributed :
—
In the Russian provinces 42,000; in Turkey 1,500,000;
in Persia 70,000; in India 40,000; in the Austrian do-
minions, and other parts of Europe, 10,000.
Tenets.—The doctrine of the Armenians differs from
orthodox Christians chiefly in their admitting only one
nature in Christ, and believing the Holy Spirit to issue
from the Father alone.
The doctrine of the Armenian creed respecting the per-
son of Christ, is, that " God, the Word, became perfect man,
one person, and one united nature ; God became man
without change, and without variation."
Rites and Ceremonies.—The rites and ceremonies of
the Armenian church greatly resemble those of the Greeks.
They mingle the whole course of the year with fasting
;
and there is not a single day, which is not appointed either
for a fast or a festival. They commemorate our Lord's
nativity on the 6th of January, and thus celebrate in
one festival his birth, epiphany, and baptism.
The Armenians practise the trine immersion, which they
consider as essential to baptism. After baptism, they ap-
ply the enyrop or chrism, and anoint the forehead, eyes,
ears, breast, palms of the hands, and soles of the feet, with
consecrated oil, in the form of a cross. Then they ad-
b PAPAL ARMENIANS.
minister to the child the eucharist, with which they only-
rub its lips. The eucharist is celebrated only on Sundays
and festivals. They do not mix the wine with water, nor
put leaven into their bread, as the Greeks do. They steep
the bread in the wine, and thus the communicant receives
both kinds together.
They worship after the Eastern manner, by prostrating
their bodies, and kissing the ground three times. When
they first enter the church, they uncover their heads, and
cross themselves three times ; but afterwards they cover
their heads, and sit cross-legged on carpets. The greatest
part of their public divine service is performed in the
morning, before it is light. They are very devout on vigils
to feasts, and on Saturday evenings, when they all go to
church, and, after their return home, perfume their houses
with incense, and adorn their little pictures with lamps.
They invoke their saints with prayers ; reverence and adorn
their pictures and images, and bum to them lamps and
candles.
PAPAL ARMENIANS.
Origin.—The Papal Armenians owe their existence as
a sect to the Jesuit missions, of which Erzeroom w^as the
head-quarters for Turkish Armenia. There in 1688, the
Papal missionaries established themselves under the protec-
tion of the French ambassador, and the Armenian Bishop
was among their first converts.
Progress.—After this singular event, some Armenian
ecclesiastics succeeded in raising a persecution, which ter-
minated in the banishment of the Jesuits. The ambas-
sador's influence, how^ever, restored them to the field of
their labours, and early in the last century they had ex-
tended their operations so widely, that the mission was
divided into two branches.
The Papal Armenians now form a very considerable
body, although they are not now numerous to the east of
Tokat, and Trebisond. At Tiflis, in Georgia, is a convent
of Capuchin missionaries, with a congregation amounting
to 600. At Angora, they formerly amounted to many thou-
sands. At Smyrna, between 2,000 and 3,000 are said to
be of the Romish communion, and at Constantinople and

the adjacent villages, Dr. Walsh, chaplain to the British
embassy to the Porte, estimates them at 4,000.
ARMINIANS.
Origin.—This sect arose in Holland by a separation
from the Calvinists, and derive their name from James
Arminius, an eminent professor of divinity in Leyden,
about the year 1600.
Thinking the doctrine of Calvin with regard to Free
Will, Predestination and Grace, inconsistent with Scrip-
ture, Arminius began to express his doubts concerning
them in 1591, and upon farther inquiry adopted sentiments
more nearly resembling those of the Lutherans than the
Calvinists.
Progress.—The controversy thus begun, became more
general after the death of Arminius in 1609, and threatened
to involve the United Provinces in civil discord. The
Arminian tenets, however, gained ground, under the mild
and favourable treatment of the magistrates of Holland,
and were adopted by several persons of merit and dis-
tinction. In 1610, the Arminians presented their Remon-
strance to the States of Holland and West Friezland, spe-r
cifying their grievances, and praying for relief; and in
1614, the States issued an ordinance directing the Re-
monstrants and Counter Remonstrants, to live in love and
charity with each other. But as both parties doubted the
obligation of such a decree in respect to spiritual affairs,
the famous synod at Dort, was held from November 1618
to May 1619, in order to adjust the differences. By this
synod, in which politics got mixed up with religion, the
Arminians were considered as enemies to their country,
and its established religion, and were exposed to much
persecution. They were treated with great severity, and
deprived of all their posts and employments, their minis-
ters were silenced, and their congregations suppressed.
After the death of Maurice Prince of Orange, in 1625,
the Arminian exiles were restored to their former reputa-
tion and tranquillity, and under the toleration of the
States, which was granted them in 1630, they erected
churches, and founded a college at Amsterdam, which pro-

duced many able divines and sound scholars. The Ar-
minians were subsequently exposed to occasional persecu-
tions—during which their sect was very numerous, but
when they had gained liberty and peace, it began to de-
crease.
Arminian tenets were known and adopted in Great
Britain at a very early period. Archbishop Laud is well
known to have greatly encouraged them ; and after the
ejectment of nearly two thousand ministers, for not com-
plying with the act of uniformity, the church was almost
wholly Arminian. By far the greater part of the clergy
of the Establishment have taken this side of the question,
and the term Arminian is applied by many, as descriptive
of the doctrines of the Church of England.
The members of the Episcopal Churches in Scotland and
America, — the Moravians —the General Baptists —the
Wesleyan Methodists—the Quakers—and the Swedenbor-
gians, are Arminians.
In France, Geneva, and many parts of Switzerland, they
are still numerous.
Tenets.—The distinguishing tenets of the Arminians,
are comprised in the five following articles relating to
Predestination —Universal Redemption —the Corruption
of Human Nature—Conversion—and Perseverance.
I.— That God from all eternity determined to bestow
salvation on those, who, as He foresaw, would persevere
unto the end in their faith in Christ Jesus ; and to inflict
everlasting punishments on those, who should continue in
their unbelief and resist to the end of life his divine
assistance.
II. —That Jesus Christ by his sufferings and death, made
an atonement for the sins of mankind in general, and of
every individual in particular; that, however, none but
those who believe in Him, can be partakers of that Divine
benefit.
HI.—That true faith cannot proceed from the exercise
of our natural faculties, and powers, nor from the force
and operation of free-will ; since man, in consequence of
his natural corruption, is incapable either of thinking or
doing any good thing ; and that therefore it is necessary,
to his conversion and salvation, that he be regenerated and
renewed by the operation of the Holy Ghost.
IV.—That this Divine Grace, or energy of the Holy
BAPTISTS. y
Ghost, begins, advances, and perfects every thing that can
be called good in man ; and that, consequently, all good
works are to be attributed to God alone;—that nevertheless,
this Grace, which is offered to all, does not force men to
act against their inclinations, but may be resisted, and
rendered ineffectual, by the perverse will of the impeni-
tent sinner.
V.—That God gives to the truly faithful who are rege-
nerated by his grace, the means of preserving themselves
in this state ; —that the regenerate may lose true justifying
faith,—fall from a state of grace, and die in their sins.
BAPTISTS.
Origin.—The true origin of this sect, according to Mos-
heim, is hid in the remotest depths of antiquity, and is ex-
tremely difficult to be ascertained.
Some of the Petrobrussians in the twelfth century ; some
of the Lollards, or Wickliffites in the fourteenth; and
some of the Hussites in the fifteenth, were Baptists in sen-
timent. But, these few instances excepted, the existence
of Anti-PoBdohaptism seems scarcely to have taken place
in the church of Christ, till a little after the beginning of
the Reformation, when a sect arose, whom historians com-
monly call the Anabaptists.
Progress.—In 1522, the Anabaptists of Germany began
to attract attention ; their leaders and themselves, however,
are considered by the Baptists of the present day, as a
political or revolutionary cabal. Their opinions they pro-
pagated and maintained with enthusiastic zeal and bold-
ness, and at length, even by force of arms, until their ring-
leader w^as put to an ignominious death, in 1536. These
fanatics also created great disturbances in Sweden.
There were at the same time Anabaptists, of a very dif-
ferent character, who were confounded with these deluded
people, and who, owing solely to their peculiar views of
baptism, were at that tumultuous period the victims of re-
venge, and persecution.
The modern descendants of those harmless and pious
men, who then suffered with the guilty, are the Mennonites
in Holland, and the Anabaptists in France. Their sect
greatly increased in both Holland and Germ.any, through
10 BAPTISTS.
the exertions of Menno Simon, from whom the Mennonites
derive their name, who laboured among them with such
unwearied zeal and success, until the period of his death
in 1561, that he has been styled on the continent, "The
parent and apostle of the Baptists.'^
The Anabaptists met with much opposition in Switzer-
land, from the two reformers Zuingle and Calvin, as well
as from others.
The first mention of the Baptists in English history is as
the subjects of persecution, in the reign of Henry VIII.
In 1535, fourteen Hollanders, refugees, were accused of
being Anabaptists, and were put to death ; ten others es-
caping the samx fate only by recantation. During the
reign of Edward VI., a commission was issued to try "All
Anabaptists," &c. &c., and they were empowered in the
event of their contumacy to commit them to the flames.
Under Elizabeth, the same inhuman policy was persisted
in. In 1575, a congregation of Dutch Anabaptists was dis-
covered at Aldgate, many were imprisoned, and four of
them made their recantation bearing faggots, at St. Paul's
Cross. Eight Dutch women were shortly after banished,
and two for their obstinacy were sentenced to be burned.
At length, exiled by the proclamation of Elizabeth, the
remnant of the Anabaptists fled to the United Provinces,
where they mingled with the other Protestant exiles.
In the reign ofJames I. many Anabaptists fled to Holland
to avoid persecution, which was kept alive till 1611, when
Legat and Whiteman were burnt at the stake. The latter
a Baptist of Burton-upon-Trent, was the last martyr that
suflfered this cruel kind of death in England. Having
been exposed to such great severities, the Baptists were
slow in establishing themselves in England. In 1640,
their first congregation was formed. Under the Long
Parliament the Baptists did not wholly escape persecu-
tion.
On the accession of King William and Queen Mary, the
Toleration Act placed the Baptists, in common with other
protestant dissenters, under the protection of the laws. The
Baptists have long subsisted under two separate and dis-
tinct societies, distinguished by different names. Those
who have followed the doctrines of Calvin being called
Particular Baptists, And those who profess the Arminian
tenets being denominated General Baptists,
BAPTISTS. 11
In 1689, a general assembly of the Calvinistic Baptists
was convoked in London, consisting of the representatives
of one hundred congregations, who decided on putting
forth a confession of faith, containing all the leading pe-
culiarities of their doctrinal tenets and discipline, which
document still remains the most complete representation
of their sentiments.
In Ireland the Baptists only average about twelve
churches, or congregations, all of which are inconsider-
able.
The Dutch Baptists (the Mennonites) are very consider-
able at the present day. In Holland they consist of about
one hundred and fifty congregations, numbering 85,000.
In the Prussian dominions they have a number of scattered
congregations, enumerating about 15,000. In Russia they
have three churches, amounting to about 6,000. In the
United States of America, the descendants of Mennonite
emigrants form a distinct communion, and can number
more than two hundred churches, some containing three
hundred members. In some parts of Pennsylvania, the
Mennonites compose the bulk of the population.
Baptists were found among the earliest British settlers
in America, but owing to persecution they fomied no
church until 1639. During the first hundred yeai-s they
laboured under many restrictions and disabilities, and their
numbers were very small, but after the establishment of
American Independence, their numbers and prosperity in-
creased rapidly. Their churches now amount to 3,520.
Their ministers to 2,485. Their communicants to 256,636,
and their hearers are averaged at 769,908.
Tenets.—This denomination of Christians are followers
of Calvin, and are distinguished from others by their
opinions, either respecting the mode and subject of bap-
tism, or by their denying the validity of infant baptism,
considering it as a human invention not countenanced by
the scripture.
Instead of administering the ordinance by sprinkling or
pouring water, they maintain that it ought to be adminis-
tered only by immersion. Such, they insist is the meaning
of haptizo^ to w ash or dip, so that a command to baptize—
is a command to immerse—thus, they say it was understood
by those holy persons who first administered it ; and thus,
they affirm it was administered in the Primitive Church.
12 GENERAL BAPTISTS.
The Baptists also say, that baptism ought not to be ad-
ministered to children or infants at all, nor to grown-up
persons in general, but to those only, who profess repent-
ance for past sin and faith in Christ.
Rite and Ceremony.—The Baptists used to administer
baptism in public waters, but they now use baptisteries,
(as being more convenient,) which are in, or near their
places of worship, either with the attendance of the can-
didate's friends only, or in the presence of the congrega-
tion; suitable dresses and separate apartments being
provided for the accommodation and convenience of can-
didates.
GENERAL BAPTISTS.
Origin.—The General or Arminian Baptists made their
first appearance in Great Britain in the latter end of the
sixteenth century. Mr. Smith, who is usually styled " the
father of the General Baptists,^* became the founder of the
first regularly organized Baptist Church about the year 1608.
Progress.—This class of Baptists having increased,
published in 1611 a confession of their faith, diverging
greatly from Calvinism.
They increased greatly at the time of the Restoration,
for they presented a petition to Charles II, *'
owned and
approved'' by upwards of 20,000. Soon afterwards divi-
sions on points of belief arose among themselves, which
greatly diminished their numbers, since w^hich, they have
gone on decreasing.
A modern writer observes " that to so low a condition is
this class now brought, that four of their congregations
in London were lately united in one, and it is not likely
to exist for any length of time."
Tenets.—On the great subject of baptism, the Parti-
cular and General Baptists agree ; in regard to worship
and church discipline, the latter differ, inasmuch, as in
some of their churches they have three distinct orders of
ministers separately ordained—to the highest of which
they give the name of messengers—to the second that of
elders—and to the third that of deacons.
CALVINISTS. 13
GENERAL BAPTIST NEW CONNECTION.
This sect has been denominated the evangelical part of
the General Baptists. Their subdivision took place about
fifty years ago ; and according to the most recent accounts,
they are more zealous and more numerous than their
brethren, having about seventy congregations chiefly in
the midland counties, and are supposed to be on the in-
crease.
BEREANS.
Origin.—A sect of Protestant Dissenters from the
Church of Scotland, who took the name of Bereans, on
separating themselves in 1773 from the National Church,
on the exclusion of their leader Mr. Barclay, from suc-
ceeding to the benefice of Fettercairn, in Kincardineshire.
They adopted the name of Bereans, from the circum-
stances of the believers of the gospel at Berea, being
highly commended for their christian conduct in searching
the scriptures.
Tenets.—The Bereans agree with the Established
Churches of England and Scotland respecting the Trinity,
predestination, and election ; but they reject all natural
religion—they take faith to be a simple credence of God's
word—personal assurance they consider as of the essence
of faith, and unbelief as the unpardonable sin. They
consider a great part of the Old Testament as mere his-
tory, and the whole of the psalms, as typical or prophetic
of Christ, and do not apply them to the experience of
private christians.
The Bereans have found but few converts to their doc-
trines, and form but a small and obscure society, and are
likely to continue so.
CALVINISTS.
Origin.—They derive their name from John Calvin, a
jealous and eminent reformer, born in Picardy in 1509, and
educated at Paris. He first studied the civil law, but turn-
ing his thoughts to divinity, and finding it unsafe for him as
14 CALVINISTS.
a Protestant to remain in France, he retired to Basil, in
Switzerland, in 1536, and in the same year became
professor of divinity at Geneva. He soon after with-
drew to Strasburg, but the Genevese earnestly inviting
him to return, he accepted their invitation in 1541, when
he commenced a vigorous system of ecclesiastical disci-
pline, and continued at Geneva actively employed as a
preacher and writer till his death in 1 564.
Progress.—Calvinism long subsisted in its complete
state in Geneva, from which its tenets soon found their
way into Germany, France, Prussia, and Holland at an
early period of the reformation ; and were introduced into
Great Britain in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, by those
divines who fled to Switzerland, to escape the religious
persecutions of Queen Mary. But the political, and as
it has been termed "the fanatical," conduct of that
portion of the Puritans who were all rigid Calvinists,
which overturned the church, brought Calvinism, already
greatly on the decline, into total disrepute with the
friends of monarchy in England. Since this period,
however, it has maintained its ground more or less ; but
since the restoration of Charles II. chiefly among the dis-
senters.
In France, Calvinism was abolished by the Revocation
of the edict of Nantz in 1685, but it is still professed there,
by almost all the reformed.
Tenets.—The essential doctrines of Calvinism have
been reduced to these five, which are termed by theologians
The Five Points : Particular Election —Particular Re-
demption—Moral inability in a fallen State—Irresistible
Grace—and the Final Perseverance of the Saints.
Generally speaking, they comprehend
I. —That God has chosen a certain number in Christ to
everlasting glory before the foundation of the world, ac-
cording to his immutable purpose, and of his free grace
and love, without the least foresight of faith, good works,
or any conditions performed by the creature, and that the
rest of mankind he was pleased to pass by, and ordain
them to dishonour and wrath for their sins, to the praise
of his vindictive justice.
II.—That Jesus Christ by his death and sufferings,
made an atonement only for the sins of the elect.
HI.—That mankind are totally depraved in consequence
COPTS. 15
of the Fall, and by virtue of Adam's being their public
head, the guilt of his sin was imputed, and a corrupt
nature conveyed to all his posterity, from which proceed
all actual transgressions ; and that by sin we are made
subject to death, and all miseries temporal, spiritual, and
eternal.
IV.—That all whom God has predestined to life, he is
pleased in his appointed time effectually to call by his
Word and Spirit out of that state of sin and death, in which
they are by nature, to grace and salvation by Jesus Christ.
V.—That those whom God has effectually called, and
sanctified by his Spirit, shall never finally fall from a state
of grace.
The order in which rhey understand the Divine decrees
has produced two distinctions of Calvinists—viz. Sublap-
SARiANS and Supralapsarians. The former term derived
from suh, below or after, and lapsus, the fall; and the
latter supra, above, and lapsus, the fall.
The Sublapsarians assert, that God had only permitted
the first man to fall into transgression, without absolutely
determining his fall: while the Supralapsarians maintain,
that God had from all eternity decreed the transgression
of Adam, in such a manner, that our first parents could not
possibly avoid that fatal event,—and this, as a foundation
for his justice and mercy.
COPTS.
This name, about the etymology of which critics are of
opposite opinions —has long been used to comprehend
all the Christians in Egypt, who belong to neither the
Greek, the Armenian, nor the Roman Catholic church in
that country.
Progress.—Ever since the incursion of the Saracens
about the middle of the seventh century, when Egypt
became subjected to the Mohammedan yoke, the Coptic
church has been exposed to numerous severe and cruel
persecutions, which have greatly diminished their numbers.
The Coptic church, however, though her members are not
supposed to exceed 100,000, continues, with respect to
numbers and influence, the dominant Christian com-
munity in Egypt.
16 DUNKERS.
The Copts of the present day, share with the Jews, the
internal trade of Egypt, as general shopkeepers, brokers,
agents, and farmers of the customs. They are chiefly
found in Upper Egypt, where they enjoy peculiar privi-
leges. It is remarkable that their own language, although
still used in the church service, is understood by few even
of their priests.
Tenets.—The Copts deny the Holy Spirit to proceed
from the Son, and allow only the Three General Councils
of Nice, Constantinople, and Ephesus. Respecting the
person of Christ, they acknowledge but one nature and
will in Him, **
After the union of the Deity and humanity."
Rites and Ceremonies —They have seven sacraments:
baptism, the eucharist, confirmation, ordination, faith,
fasting, and prayer. They observe four Lents, as do the
Greeks and most Eastern Christians; but it is said, by
Brerewood and Ross, that they do not keep the Lord's day.
There are three Coptic liturgies ; one attributed to St.
Basil, another to St. Gregory, and the third to St. Cyril.
These are translated into Arabic for the use of the clergy
and the people.
The Copts are fond of rites and ceremonies. During the
time of service, they are always in motion. In particular,
the officiating priest is in continual motion, incensing the
saints, pictures, books, &c. every moment ; a recent tra-
veller states that " many of their responses are made to
the clanging of cymbals." They have many monasteries,
in which the monks bury themselves from society in re-
mote solitudes. Their nunneries are properly hospitals,
and few enter them, except widows reduced to beggary.
DUNKERS (DIPPERS, OR TUMBLERS.)
Origin.—This small society of German Baptists were
founded by Conrad Peysel, a German, at Euphrata, wdthin
fifty miles of Philadelphia, in 1724.
Progress.—In 1777 their numbers did not exceed five
hundred, but they soon formed a little colony called Eu-
phrata, in allusion to the Hebrews who used to sing psalms
on the borders of the River Euphrates. They have since
increased, but they are not now numerous.
The Dunkers are said to derive their name from baptiz-
CHURCH OF ENGLAND i?
ing by immersion, which they perform thrice; and as they
presented themselves to the ordinance in a peculiar man-
ner, bowing forward, they were in ridicule called "Tum-
blers/'
Tenets.—The Bunkers are said to hold the leading
tenets of the Universalists, and to possess the Quakers'
scruples in regard to resistance, war, slavery, and litiga-
tion, on which account they have been called " The harm-
less Bunkers.''
Rites and Ceremonies.—They practise trine immer-
sion. Their rule is monastic, the men and women having
separate habitations and distinct governments, but those
who are disposed to marry, are allowed to do so, and to
preserve their connection with the society, but must re-
move from the settlement.
The Bunkers abstain from eating flesh except upon par-
ticular occasions, and observe in other respects a monkish
austerity, believing in the expiatory efficacy of penance
and mortification of the body. The men wear a dress
similar to that of the Bominican Friars.
ENGLANB (CHURCH OF).
Origin.—Episcopacy was early established in this country.
According to Archbishop Usher, the British Churches had
a school, or public institution in the year 182, to provide
them with proper teachers. These Churches kept inde-
pendent of the Church of Rome until the reign of Henry I.
In the fourteenth century arose John WicklifFe, who has
been justly called " The Morning Star of the Reforma-
tion," for he maintained many Protestant tenets, and
wrote several tracts against Popery, besides being the first
to translate the whole of the Bible into English.
But it was not until about 1530, in the reign of Henry
Vin., that the Reformation is usually said to have begun
in England. The establishment of the Church of Eng-
land, which was the first regularly Episcopal Church of
the Reformation, was accomplished by slow degrees.
Progress.—After the Parliament had declared Henry
VIII. the only supreme head of the Church, and the con-
vocation of the clergy had voted that the bishop of Rome
had no more jurisdiction in England, the articles of faith
c
18 CHURCH OF ENGLAND.
of the new Church, were declared to consist in the Scrip-
tures and the three Creeds—the Apostolic, the Nicene, and
the Athanasian. The real presence, the use of images,
the invocation of saints, &c. &c. were all still maintained.
During the short reign of Edward VI., the Reforma-
tion began to advance in earnest. The new liturgy was
composed in english, and took the place of the old mass
;
the doctrines were also clearly stated in thirty-two articles.
When Mary ascended the throne all was reversed, and
about 3,000 of the clergy were turned out of their livings,
and upwards of 500 clergy and laity perished as martyrs,
while Switzerland, Germany, and the Low Countries
swarmed with English exiles, who fled for their lives.
The death of Queen Mary made way for Queen Eliza-
beth, who replaced the Church of England on the same
footing on which it was under Edward VI., and on which
it now stands. As no change was made by Queen Eliza-
beth in the Episcopal form of government, and some rites
and ceremonies were retained, which many of the reformed
considered as superstitious, this gave rise to many future
dissensions. From the circumstance of these dissenters
desiring a purer form of worship than had yet been estab-
lished, they were called " Puritans," and at one time com-
prised many distinguished members of the english clergy.
Other sects and parties soon broke off, assuming various
names, whereby the Church during the reigns of James I.
and Charles I., underwent many fluctuations. During the
Interregnum in 1643, the Parliament abolished the Epis-
copal government, and condemned every thing in the
ecclesiastical establishment that was contrary to the doc-
trine, worship, and discipline of the Church of Geneva.
As soon as Charles II. was restored to the throne, the an-
cient forms of ecclesiastical government and public worship
were restored. At the Revolution, the established religion
was acknowledged, and placed on a firm and permanent
foundation ; since which time, nothing remarkable has oc-
curred in her history, nor has any change taken place in
her doctrine, worship, or constitution, except that in 1800,
when the Churches of England and Ireland became one
Church. The number of Irish Episcopalians averages
1,000,000.
From returns made in 1824, we find that the Episco-
pal Church in the United States, amounted to ten bishops,
CHURCH OF ENGLAND. 19
about three hundred and fifty clergymen, and upwards
of six hundred congregations. The American Church has
adopted the Thirty-nine Articles without materially altering
any doctrine, or the meaning of any of them, farther than
local circumstances seemed to require. They reject the
Athanasian Creed, and on points of doctrine, the major
part of her clergy are supposed to be Anti-Calvinists.
Tenets.—The acknowledged standards of the faith and
doctrines of the Church of England are—after the Scrip-
tures,—the three creeds, and the four first general councils,
the two books of Homilies, and her Thirty-nine Articles,
which last are to be found in most Common Prayer Books.
Her Liturgy, or form of Common Prayer, may also be
mentioned under this head, as it is doctrinal, as well as
devotional.
Rites and Ceremonies.—The Church of England al-
lows of two sacraments only, (viz.) Baptism and the
Eucharist.
Those called occasional offices of the church, are the
Lord's Supper ; Baptism ; the Catechism ; Confirmation ;
Matrimony ; Visitation of the Sick ; Burial of the Dead ;
Churching of Women ; and the Commination.
The Church of England, though admitting the Eucha-
rist as a sacrament, conferring grace, when worthily ad-
ministered and received, does not attach any superstitious
importance to it. This sacrament is generally taken by
persons a little before death, as is that of extreme unction
in the Roman Catholic church ; but it is administered once
a month publicly in the church. The manner of its ad-
ministration may be seen in all our common prayer-books.
Baptism is the other sacrament of the church of Eng-
land; and it may be administered to either infants or
adults ; but generally to the former, and is either public
or private. There are three services for this sacrament
:
1st, "the ministration of public baptism of infants, to be
used in the church; 2d, the ministration of baptism of
children in houses ; and 3d, the ministration of baptism to
such as are of riper years, and are able to answer for them-
selves." The primitive practice of immersion is enjoined
by th^laws of the church; but is never enforced. Infants
receive their Christian names at this rite.

EPISCOPALIANS (SCOTTISH).
Origin.—The Reformation which began to dawn on
Scotland in 1527, made its way in the midst of great
tumult and confusion. At length, "The Lords (or Leaders)
of the Congregation/' which was the name assumed by
the Reformers in 1557, disliking the name much more
than the reality of Episcopacy, set up a resemblance to it
in 1560, projected by the celebrated John Knox, under
the name of a " Superintendency."
Progress.—In 1560, the Reformation in Scotland, re-
ceived the sanction of parliament; and in 1567, it was
sanctioned by the executive government. The form of
church polity that had been established by John Knox,
having failed, a new form was adopted in 1572, when
the name of Episcopacy was resumed, together with almost
every thing that was necessary to constitute its reality,
except the consecration of Bishops.
This improved, but still defective constitution of the
church, did not long continue ; and the Reformers after a
struggle of five years, condemned it as both unlawful and
unscriptural ; they made nearer approaches to Presby-
terianism, and through the influence of Mr. Andrew Mel-
ville, who was a great promoter, if not the parent of
Scottish Presbyterianism, it was at last adopted and estab-
lished by Act of Parliament in 1592. In this state, or
nearly so, the church continued till the accession of King
James to the crown of England in 1603. He in 1610,
constituted a regular Episcopal Church, investing it with
episcopal powers and authorities.
The spirit of rebellion which had fermented during the
life of James, broke out into open rupture in the reign of
his son Charles, and the church was again thrown into
confusion. " A solemn league and covenant," was entered
into in 1638, for effecting the entire extirpation " of the
government of the church by archbishops and bishops/'
&c.
The rights of both monarchy and Episcopacy were
trampled upon by these Covenanters, and the long«period
of tyranny and persecution that followed, brought the
Episcopal succession in Scotland to almost total extinc-
tion. On the restoration of monarchy in the person of
EPISCOPALIANS (SCOTTISH.) 21
Charles II. the restoration of Episcopacy was resolved
upon, and in January, 1662, it was publicly announced by
the privy council, and confirmed in the next session of the
Scottish Parliament, with only one dissenting voice.
At the Revolution, the Church of Scotland was once
more doomed to destruction. Her bishops and clergy con-
ceived their allegiance as due to James 11. and that it
could never be dissolved but by his death, and therefore
refused the oaths of allegiance and assurance to King
William, and afterwards the oath of abjuration. From
which circumstance they obtained the name of *'
Non-
jurors."
Episcopacy was now voted a grievance to the nation,
and was abolished by the king and parliament. Some
relaxations of the severities with which the clergy
were treated by King William, was granted them by
Queen Anne in 1712, and public chapels, which had till
then been prohibited, were every where built, and fre-
quented, and in 1720, their congregations were as numer-
ous as heretofore. In 1746 and 1748, severe prohibitory
and penal statutes were enacted, in consequence of the
avowed attachment of the Episcopalians to the House of
Stuart—another attempt being then made to reinstate that
family on the throne of their ancestors.
The death of Prince Charles Edward having occurred
in 1792, these laws were wholly repealed, and the Scottish
Episcopalians were tolerated like other dissenters from the
national establishment, on which footing they have re-
mained ever since.
The Episcopalians are the only society of dissenters
from the establishment in Scotland, that has as yet been
publicly recognized by law. Their clergy amount only
to seventy, and average nearly the same number of con-
gregations ; the members of which are supposed not to ex-
ceed 40,000.
Tenets.—They subscribe to the Thirty-nine Articles
of the Church of England, and may be ranked with scarcely
<tn exception as Anti-Calvinists.
THE GREEK CHURCH.
Origin.—The following ingenious argument relative to
22 THE GREEK CHURCH.
the great antiquity of this Church, emanates from the pen
of a learned divine of the present day. " The Oriental or
Greek Church is the most ancient of all christian churches,
as it cannot be doubted that the first christian church or
society was established at Jerusalem. The prophet Isaiah
says, '
The law went out of Zion, and the word of the
Lord from Jerusalem.' This city was the mother of all
churches, the original emporium of the christian faith
;
the centre from which the healing rays of Christianity di-
verged and spread over the world."
The Greek Church, is so called, from its comprehending
all christians within the limits of ancient Greece, and also
from its members having long universally used the Greek
language in its liturgies, or religious services ; a practice
they still continue, to distinguish it from the Latin or
Romish Church.
Progress.—The Greek and Latin Churches, for the first
eight centuries, were in communion with one another,
although they disagreed in some points. In the ninth
century, their disputes ran so high, that a final separation
took place between them, and each remains to this day the
centre of a different system.
Little further remains to be related concerning the Greek
Church, excepting the Crusades, or Holy Wars, and the
vast accession that was made to it in the 15th century, by
Prince Wladimir, who compelled several Sclavonian nations,
and especially the Russians, to adopt the creed of the
Greek christians.
In 1453, when the Turks, under Mohammed the Second,
took Constantinople, and overthrew the Grecian Empire
under the last of the Byzantine Caesars, their religious esta-
blishment was overthrown also ; and though a partial to-
leration was at first permitted, persecution soon reduced
the Christian religion, and its professors, to the miserable
state in which, for so many years, they existed under the
yoke of the Ottomans.
The Greeks, under the present Turkish government, are
allowed to build no new churches, have to pay dearly for
the permission to repair the old ones ; are not allowed to
have steeples or bells to their churches, nor even to wear
the Turkish dress. They generally perform their religious
service by night; moreover, they are obliged to pay tolls
from which the Turks are free, and the males also pay to
THE GREEK CHURCH (RUSSIAN). 23
the Sultan after their 15th year a heavy poll-tax, under
the significant name of " Exemption from beheading/'
Of their numbers it is not easy to form a correct estimate
;
from recent accounts, it would appear, as if the members of
the Greek Church, were very nearly reduced to the limits
of Roumelia, Greece, Anatolia, Wallachia, and Moldavia,
and that they might be estimated at about 3,000,000.
Tenets.—The Greek Church acknowledges as the rule
of its faith, the Holy Scriptures, and the Decrees of the first
seven General Councils ; but no private person has a right
to explain for himself or others, either the declarations of
Scripture, or the decisions of these Councils.
The Nicene and the Athanasian Creeds are allowed by
them, and they hold the doctrine of the Trinity, but with
this qualification, that the Holy Ghost proceeds from the
Father only, and not from the Father and Son.
Rites and Ceremonies.— They use what is called ^rme
immersion in baptism, that is, they dip the person three
times under water at the name of the Father, the Son, and
the Holy Ghost. When the child is baptized, the priest
anoints it with the holy chrism^ which is applied to the
forehead, eyes, nostrils, mouth, ears, breast, hands, and feet.
Extreme Unction is practised in some degree ; but they
disclaim that name, calling it the Euchelaion, or mystery
of the holy oil. It is administered to all sick persons, as
often as such persons desire it, without waiting till the
sick person is at the point of death ; nor is it deemed
essential to salvation.
They strictly abstain from eating things strangled, and
such other meats as are prohibited in the Old Testament.
In the observance of divine fasts and feasts, the Greek
Christians are rigid and superstitious ;
particularly as to
the Lents, of which they have four every year. At these
times they eat nothing that has blood, or oil, nor milk-
meats, but herbs and shell-fish ; and are so extremely par-
ticular and strict, as scarcely to allow an Qgg or flesh-broth
to a sick person.
GREEK CHURCH (RUSSIAN).
Origin.—Christianity it is supposed was first introduced
into Russia about the year 955, when it was professed by
24 THE GREEK CHURCH (RUSSIAN).
the Princess Olga, who was baptized at Constantinople.
She recommended it to her grandson Vladimir, on whose
baptism in 988, it was adopted by the nation generally,
and from that time, the Greek Church, has been the esta-
blished religion throughout this vast empire.
Progress.—During the middle ages, the doctrine of
Transubstantiation, and other tenets peculiar to the Ro-
mish Church, were covertly introduced; and by the ir-
ruption of the Mongol Tartars in the 15th century, an
entire stop was put to learning, civilization, and religion
for full two centuries.
On the accession of the present dynasty in 1613, the useful
arts of life revived ; Christianity was restored, and schools
were established for the education of the Russian clergy.
The Patriarch of Russia, was formerly, almost equal in
authority with the Czar himself. Peter the Great, on the
death of the Patriarch in 1700, abolished his office, and
having declared himself head of the national church, ap-
pointed an Exarch. In 1721 he abolished this office also,
and appointed *'
A Holy Legislative Synod," consisting of
a Council, which he established at St. Petersburgh. He
also deprived the clergy of nearly all their rich endow-
ments. But it was left for the Empress Catherine to anni-
hilate the power of the clergy, and to complete their
impoverishment. She appropriated the whole of the
immoveable property of the church and clergy to the use
of the crown, appointing stipends in exchange, to the
monasteries and their rulers.
The Russian Church continues to the present day in an
impoverished condition. From recent returns, the number
of the Russian clergy of all ranks, averages about 215,000
;
and the sum allowed for their support by government, is
only about two millions of roubles (80,000/.). They are
consequently dependent, in a great measure, upon the free-
will offerings of the people for their support ; their chief
income being derived from fees and perquisites. The
Russian church service is in the Sclavonic tongue, and oc-
cupies upwards of 20 volumes folio.
Tenets.—This Church agrees almost in every point of
doctrine with the Greek Church j to which article the
reader is referred.
Rites AND Ceremonies.—In addition to the forms and
services of the Greek church, most of which the Russians
HUGUENOTS (OR FRENCH PROTESTANTS). 25
have always used, they still retain various ceremonies and
superstitions of their own.
The Russians, with the mother-church, have four
Lents annually, besides a great number of abstinences or
fasts ; and Wednesdays and Fridays, which are fish-days
throughout the whole year. The first Lent comprehends
the forty days previous to Christmas ; the second, which is
their great Lent, the same space of time before Easter
;
the third, called the Lent of St. Peter, commences the
week after Pentecost, or Whitsunday, and ends on the
feast of St. Peter, June 29th ; and the fourth, the Lent
of the Mother of God, begins on the first and ends on the
fifteenth of August, which is the day of Koimesis, or the
assumption of the blessed Virgin.
HUGUENOTS (OR FRENCH PROTESTANTS).
Origin.—During the reign of Francis L, in 1515, the
principles of those great Reformers, Luther and Zuinglius,
first gained an entrance into France.
The term of " Huguenot" is of uncertain origin ; one
explanation derives it from a gate in Tours called
" Hug071,'^ where the Protestants first assembled ; another
from the first words of their original protest " Hue nos,^'
Progress.—x\lthough Francis endeavoured to suppress
the doctrines of Calvin by penal laws, the Huguenots
increased, and under his successor Henry IL they made a
further progress. This intolerant monarch adopted a
cruel line of policy, his parliament at Paris sanctioning
an edict by which the Huguenots were placed out of the
protection of the law, and liberty granted to every Roman
Catholic to destroy them. Their cause, however, still
triumphed ; they not only began to form religious assem-
blies, but were soon able to establish numerous churches
in the capital, and in the provinces.
They had undergone every variety of persecution, when
the massacre at Paris on the eve of St. Bartholomew,
(August 24, 1572,) perpetrated under the feeble reign of
Charles IX., filled all Protestant Europe with horror;
upwards of 70,000 Huguenots being butchered on that
occasion. Their sufferings were but slightly mitigated,
until Henry IV. who tolerated and protected them during
26 HUGUENOTS (OR FRENCH PROTESTANTS.)
his reign, passed in their favour in 1508, the famous Edict
of Nantes, whereby they were allowed the free exercise
of their religion, and were admitted to various civil as
well as ecclesiastical privileges. This Edict was revoked
by Cardinal Mazarine in 1685, during the minority of
Louis XIV., when the persecution again began ; their
churches were demolished, their estates confiscated, and
after the loss of innumerable lives, finally 500,000 Hugue-
nots fled to Switzerland, Germany, Holland, and England,
notwithstanding every part of the French frontiers were
guarded with the utmost vigilance.
In the reign of Louis XV. new but less severe measures
were adopted against the Protestants, and in 1746 they
ventured to appear publicly in Languedoc and Dauphiny.
In 1762, Protestants were no longer molested ;
yet they
did not dare to make pretensions to public offices.
The Revolution restored them to all their civil rights,
and during the reign of Buonaparte, they frequently laid
out their hitherto secreted treasures in the purchase of the
national domains.
Although they did not offer any opposition to the new
order of things, which took place on the Restoration of the
Bourbons, disturbances attended with bloodshed took place
at Nismes and the vicinity, which were speedily suppressed
by the judicious measures of government.
The pastors of all Christian communities in France are
paid by the State. Protestant pastors are now paid, on
account of their wives and families, at the rate of about
56/. per annum each, which is more than is allowed to the
Roman Catholic clergy. This stipend is considered to con-
stitute only two-thirds of the provision for the several
pastors, who are expected to get the remainder from their
respective flocks.
Tenets.—Their Confession of Faith, which has received
the approbation and the signatures of the most illus-
trious of the friends of the Reformation in France, is Cal-
vinistic.
The church of Geneva, to which all the reformed in
France were united by their doctrine, became also the
model for their church polity and discipline.
27
INDEPENDENTS.
Origin.—This sect which Puritanism gave birth to, was
first formed in Holland in 1610.
They derive their name, from their, maintaining, that
each congregation of Christians, which meets ordinarily
in one place for public worship, is a complete church, has
full power to regulate every thing relating to religious
government within itself, and is in no respect dependent
upon, or accountable to other churches.
Progress.—During the seventeenth century, atLeyden,
atMiddleburgh, and at Rotterdam were numerous churches
of English exiles, who had adopted the views of church-
fellowship, and government, which have since distin-
guished the body of English Independents.
The founder of the sect, as it now stands, is allowed to
have been Mr. John Robinson, of Norfolk ; he, meeting
with Mr. Henry Jacob in Holland, and their sentiments
on church discipline coinciding, Mr. Jacob returned to
England about 1616, and established the first Independent
Church there.
The Independents were a very inconsiderable body till
the troubles in the reign of Charles I. ; then, as Episcopacy
began to decline, they became more considerable both in
numbers and reputation. During the administration of
Cromwell, who, for political purposes, bestowed on them
his protection and patronage, they acquired a vast influ-
ence ; but after the Restoration their cause declined, and they
gradually sunk into obscurity; continuing to decline till
1691, in the reign of King William, w^hen they entered into
an association with the Presbyterians, comprised in nine
articles, that tended to the maintenance of tneir respective
institutions.
Tenets.—The Creed of the Independents is uniformly
Calvinistic, though with considerable shades of difference.
That, which distinguishes the Independents from every
other sect, is, their maintaining that the power of church
government or discipline, is vested only in the community
of the faithful at large ; and their disclaiming every form
of union between churches, and assigning to each con-
gregation the exclusive government of itself ; having full
power within itself to admit and exclude members, to
28 INDEPENDENTS (SCOTTISH NEW.)
choose church officers ; and to depose them, without being
accountable to any jurisdiction whatsoever.
INDEPENDENTS (SCOTTISH NEW.)
Origin.—The Churches composing this Body now asso-
ciated under the name of " The Congregational Union of
Scotland," for the most part originated in the labours of a
Society formed in 1797, under the auspices of Robert
Haldane, Esq. for the avowed object of promoting the
preaching of the gospel in those parts of Scotland devoid
of evangelical instruction.
Mr. Haldane had sold his estates, with the intention of
employing his fortune in diffiising among the tribes of
Hindostan, the arts of civilized life, and the blessings of
true religion; but being thwarted in his plans by the
jealous restrictions of government, he resolved to employ
his fortune and exertions in propagating the gospel at
home.
Progress. — Acting upon this principle, Mr. James
Haldane, brother of the above, Mr. Aikman, and others,
traversed the greater part of Scotland, preaching to their
countrymen, not without meeting considerable opposition,
especially from the established clergy. They were soon
succeeded by other labourers employed by the Society.
In a short time Messrs. Haldane separated from the
Established Church, and shortly afterwards the Rev.
Messrs. Innes and Ewing, resigned their charges and
united themselves to the new society ; which increased so
greatly, that large places of public worship, distinguished
by the name of " Tabernacles," were erected at Mr. R.
Haldane's expense in the principal towns.
Mr. J. Haldane, with his congregation, Mr. Innes, and
some others, subsequently embraced Baptist principles,
which has occasioned a division in the body. The Con-
gregationalists of Scotland, have recently become more
closely assimilated to their brethren in England, and
having rapidly increased in numbers, now form a very
important and well organized denomination. The num-
ber of churches comprised in the Congregational Union
of Scotland, (formed in 1812,) amounted in 1836 to ninety-
one.
IRVINGITES. 29
Tenets.—Their doctrines are Calvinistical, and they
reject all articles of faith, or creeds of human composition;
they insist that the Scriptures contain a full and complete
model and system of doctrine, government, discipline,
and worship, and that in them may be found an universal
rule for the direction of Christians in their associated
state, as well as all necessary instruction for the faith
and practice of individuals.
IRVINGITES.
As the followers of the late Edward Irving, notwith-
standing the melancholy consciousness avowed by their
master in his last moments, of having laboured under a
delusion, appear likely for a time to maintain their ex-
istence as a separate body, they claim a brief description..
Origin.—This Sect may attribute its origin to the meet-
ings held in 1826, at Albury Park, at the invitation of the
opulent proprietor, Henry Drummond, Esq. The osten-
sible object of these meetings, was, to inquire into the im-
port of the unfulfilled prophecies relating to the restora-
tion of the Jews and the Millennium. It was not long,
however, before germs of those extravagances of opinion
began to discover themselves, which afterwards became
the distinguishing and prominent characteristics of Mr.
Irving's followers.
Progress.—A spirit of gross fanaticism—resulting from
religious controversies—had exhibited itself at Gairloch in
Ross-shire : —from what w^as supposed to be her dying bed,
a young woman named Mary Campbell, in 1830, at Ferni-
carry, addressed her visitors with a fervour and fluency
which appeared to them preternatural, and which she was
herself led to ascribe to inspiration. Contrary to all ex-
pectation, she began to recover; and with the prospect of
returning health, she resolved to devote her future life to
the conversion of the heathen. Conceiving herself spe-
cially called to the service, she prayed for the requisite
qualifications, and in answer, received, as she supposed, the
fift of speaking in unknown tongues, and writing in un-
nown characters, although the gift of understanding,
or interpreting the language uttered, was withheld : to this
30 IRVINGITES.
imaginary endowment was soon added, a pretension to the
power of working miracles !
It was not long before the scene of these miraculous
pretensions was transferred to the English metropolis;
and the " Gifts'* were now confined to the congregation
of the Rev. Edward Irving, then a minister of the Scottish
Kirk.
Those individuals who conceived themselves to have
received *^The Gift of Tongues," soon assumed also that
of prophecy, uttering their warnings, professedly under
the constraining influence of a supernatural power, partly
in what they called " The Tongue," and partly in English.
" The Tongue'' burst forth from the gifted person so
suddenly, and with such loud and rapid vociferation, that
the hearer could scarcely recover from the shock before
the English commenced. Some spoke for two hours and
upwards with very little interval, giving forth prophecies
concerning the church and the nation.
These performances having continued nearly eighteen
months, it was thought high time to bring Mr. Irving's
heretical notions, under the cognizance of the Judica-
tories of the Scottish Church. Accordingly in March,
1833, he was tried by the Presbytery of Annan, and
suspended from his office as a minister of the National
church.
On the morning upon which he was, in pursuance of
this sentence, shut out of his church in Regent Square,
he pronounced a curse upon the place, and declared that
it should never again prosper. A new and elegant chapel
was subsequently opened and consecrated in Newman
Street, Oxford Road. On the same night, he presented
his infant child for baptism, and gave it the name of
" Ebenezer," in token that the Lord had thus far helped
him. In a short time the child sickened, and when it was
dying, the prophets and elders were summoned into the
chamber, when one of the gifted persons declared it to be
the will of the Lord, that the child should not die ! While
they were in the act of praying, and commanding it to
revive, it expired !
—upon which another manifestation
burst forth, that it was the will of the Lord, it should be
restored to life. But the spirit would not come again at
their bidding, and the child was entombed under the very
church, which its father had a short time before cursed
!
I
LUTHERANS. 31
On being summoned to appear before the General Assem-
bly, Mr. Irving repaired to Scotland, but instead of wait-
ing to receive the sentence passed upon his errors, he stood
up and angrily denounced his judges, declaring that the
fearful judgment of God would fall upon them, for resist-
ing the work he was engaged in, and so left them, still up-
held in his delusion, by the assurances of his prophets.
Very shortly afterwards he w^as seized with fever, and the
fatal symptoms of consumptive malady. In spite of con-
fident predictions to the contrary, he expired in the land
which he was to have astonished with his power ; and his
remains repose under one of the churches, the ministers of
which, he had threatened with awful judgments. He died
at Glasgow, December 6th, 1834, in his 34th year.
^'Besides,'' (says Mr. Josiah Conder, to whose recent
"View of all Religions, 1838," we are indebted for this
article) "the principal chapel in Newman Street, the Irving-
ites have (or had) six others, in and near London, named
after *The Seven churches ofAsia,' and having their apostles,
and pillars of apostles ;
prophets, and pillars of prophets
;
angels, and pillars of angels; elders, evangelists, &c. &c.
As their meetings are for the most part private, little is
known of what takes place at them. Mr. Drummond is
the Angel of the church at Albury, from which the husband
of Mary Campbell, Mr. Caird, was sent forth as an Evan-
gelist. He afterwards presided over a church gathered
imder the episcopal auspices of Mr. Drummond at Brighton.
A foreign mission also has been undertaken by some mem-
bers of the society, in emulation of the proceedings of the
early " Friends." What is not a little remarkable, some
members of the society of "Friends" have embraced the
tenets of the Irvingites, which rest upon claims to imme-
diate inspiration, strikingly similar to those that form the
basis of Quakerism."
LUTHERANS.
This Sect are so named from their being followers of the
doctrines of Martin Luther, an Augustine friar, who was
born in Upper Saxony in 1483, one of the most intrepid
and most successful of Reformers.
Origin.—Luther first took offence at the indulgences
32 LUTHERANS.
which were granted in 1517, by Pope Leo X., to those
who contributed towards finishing St. Peter's Church at
Rome, Luther being then Professor of Divinity at Wittem-
berg. Those indulgences promised remission of all sins,
past, present, and to come, however enormous their nature,
to all who were rich enough to purchase them. At this
Luther raised his warning voice, and publicly at Wittem-
berg he exposed the traffic in indulgences, and subsequently,
attacked boldly the supremacy of the Pope. This was
the commencement of that memorable revolution in the
Church which is styled The Reformation.
Progress.—In 1520, Luther and his partisans were ex-
communicated ; when this great reformer, whom diligent
researches into the Scriptures had convinced of the errors
of the Church of Rome, immediately and publicly re-
nounced her communion.
After appearing at the Diet of Worms in 1521, which he
left a conqueror, it became so manifest that his enemies
were determined on his destruction, that Frederic the Wise
conveyed him privately to the castle of Warteburg, where
he was concealed nine months, during which he translated
the New Testament into German, encouraging his ad-
herents by his pen, and being cheered in return, by receiv-
ing accounts of the rapid diffusion of his doctrines. In the
same year Luther entered the lists of controversy with
King Henry VIII., and it was the disputes and attacks
that followed, that matured his plans for a total Refor-
mation in the Church, which he conceived to be impera-
tively called for.
In 1523, he began to purify the Liturgy from its empty
forms, and by laying aside his cowl in 1524, he gave the
signal for the abolition of the monasteries. In 1525, he
married Catherine Von Bora, a nun. This he did as much
from principle as inclination, with the design of restoring
the preachers of the gospel to their natural and social
rights and duties.
From 1526 to 1529, Luther prepared a new church ser-
vice, with the aid of Melancthon and other members of
the Saxon Church ; also catechisms to be used in schools.
In 1527, John, the Elector of Saxony, took a decisive step,
and established the Lutheran Religion throughout his do-
minions; as did Philip, Landegrave of Hesse. In 1529, at
the Diet of Worms, a suspension of a decree against the
LUTHERANS. 33
Lutherans was revoked through the influence of Charles V.
Against this new decree six princes, and the deputies of
thirteen imperial cities and towns solemnly protested, and
from this, the appellation of Protestants became common
to all who embraced the Lutheran and Reformed Religion.
At the Diet of Augsburg in 1530, the Reformers pre-
sented their confession of faith and practice, and hence it
obtained the name of the Confession of Augsburg. The
Reformation was now gaining ground with inconceivable
rapidity in most of the countries of Europe. Within the
space of five or six years it spread from Hungary and
Bohemia to France and England ; then to Sweden and
Denmark^ and subsequently to Brandenburg, Pomerania,
Mecklenburg, Holstein, &c.
On the death of Luther, which occurred in 1546, Philip
Melancthon, the Greek Professor at Wittemburg, was placed
at the head of the Lutheran Church. It now became a prey
to intestine disputes, which continued more or less until
the end of the 16th century; the disciples of Calvin soon
separating from the Church. In the 17th century, the
principles of the Lutheran Church were carried into Asia,
Africa, and America, and were also introduced into some
parts of Europe, where they had hitherto been unknown.
Lutherism is now the established or prevailing form of
the Protestant Faith in Saxony, Prussia, Wittemberg, Han-
over, and great part of Northern Germany; in Denmark,
Sweden, and Norway. There are also Lutheran Churches
in Holland, Russia, Poland, and Hungary ; and in the
United States of America, Of sixteen Protestant Univer-
sities in Germany, fourteen are Lutheran.
Tenets.-—I'he members of this church are distinguished
principally by maintaining the following Doctrines :
—That
neither the Pope nor any other man possesses any authority
in matters of faith, but that the Scriptures are, as a col-
lection of inspired, sufficient, and clear writings, the only
source whence our religious sentiments, whether they re-
late to faith or practice, must be drawn, and to w^hich
human reason ought, in every respect, to submit and
yield ; that man is naturally incapable of thinking or
doing any good, valid before God ; that justification and
future happiness are the eflfect of the meritorious and
vicarious death of Jesus, as God and man in one person
;
that faith is the necessary condition of grace on the part
34 METHODISTS (aRMINIAN, OR WESLEYAN.)
of man, which faith is itself the gift of divine grace.
That good works are of value only as far as they are the
effect of faith ; that, however, there exists no unconditional
predestination, and that the real body and blood of Jesus
are united in a mysterious manner, through the consecra-
tion, with the bread and wine, and are received with and
under them in the sacrament of the Lord's Supper. This
last doctrine they distinguish by the word Consubstantia-
tion ; and it formed, together with the doctrine of predes-
tination, for a long time, the principal " party-wall ''be-
tween the Lutherans and Calvinists ; but it, as w^ell as
some of the other doctrines, has been, if not formally, at
least most virtually abandoned, or considerably modified,
by a great number of Lutherans.
METHODISTS (ARMINIAN, OR WESLEYAN).
Origin.—This Body of Christians owe their origin to
the Methodist Society which was first founded at Oxford
in 1729. Mr. John Wesley, then a Fellow and Tutor at
Lincoln College, Mr. Charles Wesley, a Student and Tutor
of Christ Church, and two other Commoners, set apart
some evenings in the week for reading the Greek Testa-
ment, religious conversation, and prayer. In 1732 they
were joined by others of the same serious dispositions ; and
in 1 735, by the celebrated Mr. George Whitfield, of Pem-
broke College, then in his 18th year.
The name of Methodists was bestowed upon them by
their more worldly fellow-students, on account of their
methodical observance of the rules of religion, and the
regularity of their lives. This name was also adopted by
themselves, and has since been continued to their fol-
lowers.
Progress.—In 1735, Messrs. John and Charles Wesley
sailed for Georgia, in order to preach the Gospel to the
Indians. While Mr. John Wesley was employed at Sa-
vannah, several circumstances of a disagreeable nature
occurred, which induced him to return to England, after
an absence of two years, when he was succeeded by Mr.
Whitfield.
Mr. Wesley having resumed his ministry in England,
METHODISTS (aRMINIAN, OR WESLEYAN). 35
his labours were attended with great success. Many ap-
peared to be rehgiously impressed, and disposed to meet
together for spiritual conversation and prayer. Accord-
ingly, in 1738, he formed them into a Society in London,
which held its conferences in a private house, without any
disposition at this time to secede from the Church ; but
the clergy of the Establishment having refused him their
pulpits," he preached in Newgate, in some Dissenting
chapels in London, and in different places in the country,
where he could gain admission. Multitudes still crowding
from all quarters to hear him, he was at length compelled
to take the open air and become field-preacher. This was
the origin and commencement of his itinerancy.
In 1741, the Rev. George Whitfield returned to England.
During the period of his labours in America, he had im-
bibed certain doctrines contrary to those taught by Mr.
Wesley, and a separation took place.
Mr. Wesley, finding his Societies increasing very fast in
London, Bristol, and other places, was induced to select
from his followers, those whom he judged the best qualified
to instruct the rest. This was the origin of his ''Lay
Preachers." Having now abundance of Assistants, pious,
zealous, and active, he sent them forth in every direction
;
some to watch over the Societies already formed, and others
to the highways, to preach to the most dissolute and aban-
doned. In every part of the Kingdom their labours were
eminently useful ; numerous Societies being formed. Tli«y
did not, however, labour without molestation. In many
places they were beset with mobs, and assailed by showers
of stones ; and sometimes persecuted with the most un-
relenting cruelty. Methodism, however, soon rose above
the opposition of its foes, and overspread the country.
Since that period to the present time, its numbers have
been steadily and rapidly increasing in every part of the
United Kingdom ; so much so, that Mr. Conder states the
Wesleyan Methodists of all classes to average 3,500 con-
gregations, and 1,400,000 attendants.
Tenets.—I. The Wesleyan Methodists maintain the
total Fall of Man in Adam, and his utter inability to re-
cover himself, or take one step towards his recovery,
" without the grace of God assisting him, that he may
have a good will, and working with him, when he has
that good will."
D 2
36 METHODISTS (aRMINIAN, OR WESLEYAN).
II. They hold General Redemption. They assert "that
Christ, by the grace of God, tasted death for every man."
This grace they call " free," as extending itself freely to
all.
III. They hold Justification by Faith. " This Justifi-
cation," says Mr. Wesley, " signifies present forgiveness,
pardon of sins, and consequently acceptance with God,
who therein declares his righteousness, or justice and
mercy, by, or for the remission of the sins that are past,
saying, I will be merciful to thy unrighteousness, and
thine iniquities I will remember no more. I believe the
condition of this is faith (Rom. iv. 5, &c.) ; I mean, not
only, that without faith we cannot be justified j but, also,
that as soon as any one has true faith, in that moment he
is justified. Justifying faith implies, not only a divine
evidence, or conviction, that God w^as in Christ, reconciling
the world unto himself, but a sure trust and confidence
that Christ died for my sins ; that he loved me, and gave
himself for me. And the moment a penitent sinner believes
this, God pardons and absolves him."
IV. They hold the Witness of the Spirit. Mr. Wesley
says :
" The testimony of the Spirit is an inward impres-
sion on the soul, whereby the Spirit of God directly wit-
nesses to my spirit, that I am a child of God ; that Jesus
Christ hath loved me, and given himself for me ; that all
my sins are blotted out, and I am reconciled to God. The
manner how the divine testimony is manifested to the
heart, I do not take upon me to explain. But the fact
we know, namely, that the Spirit of God does give a be-
liever such a testimony of his adoption, that while it is
present to the soul, he can no more doubt the reality of
his sonship, than he can doubt the shining of the sun,
w^hile he stands in the full blaze of his beams."
V. They maintain, that, by virtue of the blood of Jesus
Christ, and the operations of the Holy Spirit, it is their
privilege to arrive at that maturity in grace, and partici-
pation of the divine nature, which excludes sin from the
heart, and fills it with perfect love to God and man. This
they denominate '*
Christian perfection."
Rites and Ceremonies.—Class Meetings are each com-
posed of from twelve to twenty persons, one of whom is
styled the leader. When they assemble, which is once a-
week, the leader gives out a few verses of a hymn, which
METHODISTS (ARMINIAN, OR WESLETAN). 37
they join in singing. He then makes a short prayer ; after
which he converses with each member respecting Christian
experience, gives suitable advice to all, and concludes by
singing and praying.
Band Meetings consist of about four or five members,
who are nearly of the same age, in nearly similar circum-
stances, and of the same sex, who meet together once a-
week, in order to speak their minds more freely than it
would be agreeable to do in a promiscuous assembly of
members, such as a class-meeting. At stated periods,
those who meet in these private bands, meet all together,
forming a public or select band, when, after singing and
prayer, any of the members are at liberty to rise and
speak their experience. After a few of them have spoken,
the meeting, as usual, is concluded by singing and
prayer.
Watch-ninhts are rather similar to the vigils of the
ancients, which they kept on the evenings preceding the
grand festivals. They are held once a quarter. On these
occasions, three or four of the preachers officiate, and a
great concourse of people attend. The service commences
between eight and nine at night. After one of the mi-
nisters has preached, the rest pray and exhort, giving out
at intervals suitable hymns, which the congregation join
in singing, till a few minutes after twelve o'clock, when
they conclude.
Love-feasts are also held quarterly. No persons are
admitted who cannot produce a ticket to show that they
are members, or a note of admittance from the superin-
tendent. However, any serious person, who has never
been present at one of these meetings may be supplied
with a note for once, but not oftener, unless he becomes
a member. The meeting begins with singing and prayer.
Afterwards small pieces of bread, or plain cake, and some
water, are distributed; and all present eat and drink to-
gether, in token of their Christian love to each other.
Then, if any persons have anything particular to say con-
cerning their present Christian experience, or the manner
in which they were first brought to the knowledge of the
truth, they are permitted to speak ; when a few of them
have spoken, a collection is made for the poor, and tho
meeting is concluded with singing and prayer.
38
METHODISTS (AMERICAN WESLEYAN).
Origin.—The first Methodist Society was established in
New York 1766, by Preachers from Ireland.
Progress.—Their numbers increased so rapidly, that,
in 1768 they erected a meeting-house. Several preachers
were soon after sent out from England; and the first Con-
ference was held at Philadelphia in 1773. During the
war, all the English preachers returned home, except Mr.
Asbury. At the close of the Revolution in 1784, Mr.
Wesley sent out Dr. Coke, with directions to consecrate
Mr. Asbury superintendent, or bishop of the American
church; which was done at Baltimore: twelve of the
preachers were at the same time ordained elders.
The form of government is Episcopal. Three orders of
ministers are recognised—deacons, elders, and bishops.
The whole number of members (in 1831) was 513,114,
and of preachers 2010. The number of hearers who at-
tend Methodist preaching throughout the United States is
averaged at 1,000,000. All the Methodists in this country
are Wesleyans.
METHODIST NEW CONNEXION (OR KIL-
HAMITES.)
Origin.—The grounds of this separation, which took
place in 1797, are, that in the latter part of his life, Mr.
Wesley thought proper to assume the Episcopal office,
and not only to ordain several ministers, who were sent
out to Scotland and to America, but also to consecrate
some as bishops.
During his lifetime, some of the Societies petitioned to
have preaching in their own chapels in church hours,
which was contrary to his original directions; and to
have the Lord's Supper administered by the travelling
preachers. This request he generally refused to comply
with; and where it could be conveniently done, he sent
some of the clergymen, who ofiiciated at the New Chapel,
London, to perform these sacred offices.
After his decease in 1791, the same request was renewed
by many of the Societies ; when they had the mortification
METHODISTS (CALVINISTIC, OR WHITFIELDITES). 39
to find that this question was decided against them by lot.
The subject still continued to be agitated ; and the dis-
satisfaction occasioned by the decisions of Conference, to-
gether with some other differences, led, in 1 797, to the
secession of a considerable body, who form what is termed
the " Methodist New Connexion." Sometimes they are
called " Kilhamites,'' from their most prominent leader, the
Rev. Alexander Kilham.
The New Methodists differ from the Old Methodists in
the more popular constitution of their church government
:
the preachers and the lay-deputies, chosen by the people,
being associated in all meetings for business.
In 1833, the New Connexion numbered, in Great Britain
and Ireland, 63 preachers, and 14,784 members.
METHODISTS (CALVINISTIC, or WHITFIELD-
ITES).
Origin.—About the year 1741, the two great Founders
of Methodism, Mr. John Wesley and Mr. George Whit-
field entirely separated, in consequence of holding different
opinions on the doctrines of free will and predestination.
Mr. Whitfield gave his whole attention to preaching,
without attempting to organize a Sect, or to frame any
system of discipline for his followers. He died in 1770,
in the 56th year of his age, in Massachusetts, on his
seventh missionary visit to America. His establishment
in Georgia, where he had founded an orphan house and
academy, he bequeathed to Selina, Countess of Huntingdon,
and his chapels in England were left to the management of
trustees.
Progress.—According to Dr. Haweis, Mr. Whitfield's
followers in 1800 composed an aggregate nearly as nu-
merous as the Wesleyan Methodists. In 1829, the total
number of places of worship belonging to the Calvinistic
Methodists amounted to 124. Although comparatively
speaking, not a very numerous body, they have in different
parts of the United Kingdom, a considerable number of
preachers, whose congregations and the societies connected
with them are very extensive : in Wales especially, the
Calvinistic Methodists form a very numerous and com-
pact class.
40
LADY HUNTINGDON'S CONNEXION.
A section of the Calvinistic Methodists still exists as
a distinct Body, under the above name ; consisting of the
congregations assembling in the various chapels erected
by Selina, Countess of Huntingdon, and vested in trustees.
Many of these, in different parts of the country, have
within the last fifty years become severed from the con-
nexion, in consequence of the difficulty of obtaining a
succession of ministers, and have become Independent
Congregations.
Lady Huntingdon founded in 1768, a college in South
Wales for the purpose of educating young men for the
ministry. After her death in 1791, the Institution was
transferred to Cheshunt, in Hertfordshire, where it still
flourishes. The present number of students is sixteen
;
they are maintained and educated, entirely free, for four
years.
MORAVIANS (OR UNITED BRETHREN).
Origin.—This Community derive their origin from the
ancient Bohemian and Moravian Brethren, who existed as
a distinct people ever since the year 1457 ; when, separating
from those who took up arms in defence of their protest-
ations against the errors of popery, they formed a plan for
church-fellowship and discipline, agreeable to their insight
into the Scriptures, and called themselves at first " Fratres
Legis Chrisii;^* or Brethren after the Law of Christ.
Progress.—The fraternity were soon joined by others
of the same persuasion in other places, when they took
the name of ^^
Unitas Fratrum ;^^ or ^^
Fratres Unitatis"
(United Brethren). By degrees they established congre-
gations in various places, and spread themselves into Mo-
ravia and other neighbouring States.
After sufiering great persecutions, some emigrated into
Silesia, and others into Upper Lusatia, a province of Sax-
ony adjoining to Bohemia. The latter found a zealous
protector in Count Zinzendorfl", a Lutheran by education,
and a man remarkable for his unaffected piety. He is very
justly esteemed by them as the chief instrument, in the
MORAVIANS (or UNITED BRETHREN). 41
hands of God, in restoring their sinking Church. He gave
them some land on one of his estates in Upper Lusatia,
upon which, in 1722, they built a village, and founded a
colony. Count Zinzendorff is, in general, gratefully re-
membered for his disinterested and indefatigable labours
in promoting the interests of religion, both at home and
abroad. He died in 1760, in the 60th year of his age.
In 1742 and following years, they began establishments
in England, and everywhere met with the encouragement
due to their real character and industrious habits. Thus
their settlements were extended to North and South Ame-
rica, the West and East Indies, Russia, Asia, Africa; and
Greenland, with a view to the propagation of the Gospel
among the heathen.
The Moravian Episcopal succession, after mature inves-
tigation, was admitted by the parliament of Great Britain,
who acknowledged the " Unitas Fratrum^^ to be an an-
cient Protestant Episcopal Church, and passed an Act in
their favour in 1749.
The institutions of the Brethren at the present time
consist of 23 settlements—of these, 14 are in Germany and
Holland ; 1 in Russia ; 3 in England ; 1 in Ireland ; and
4 in the United States,—containing about 10,000 members.
45 Societies, and 20 or 30 smaller congregations, enu-
merating 86,300 members ; and 45 missionary stations, of
which 16 are regular settlements occupying the labours of
116 missionaries. No religious community has done so
much in proportion to its members, and limited resources,
towards the dilFusion of Christianity, and it is a distin-
guishing feature of the Moravian missions, that their
labours have in every instance been directed to tribes on
the extreme verge of civilization, or to the outcasts of
humanity—the half-frozen Greenlander, the savage Esqui-
maux, and the despised Hottentot.
Tenets.—Though the Brethren acknowledge no other
standard of truth than the Holy Scriptures, they in general
profess to adhere to the Augsburg Confession of Faith.
They teach the doctrine of the Trinity, nor do they differ
in essentials from other Protestant Churches.
They profess to believe that the kingdom of Christ is
not confined to any party, community, or Church; and they
consider themselves, though closely united in one body or
visible Church, as spiritually joined in the bond of Chris-
42 MORAVIAN (or UNITED BRETHREN).
tian love to all who are taught of God, and belong to the
universal Church of Christ, however much they may differ
in forms, which they deem non-essentials.
Rites and Ceremonies.—All the great festivals cele-
brated in other Protestant Churches, are attended to by
the Moravians with due solemnity; and, during the whole
of the passion-week, they have daily services for the con-
templation of our Lord's last discourses and sufferings.
On Maunday Thursday they celebrate the Lord's Supper,
and also on every fourth Sunday throughout the year.
They have prescribed forms of prayer for baptisms, both
of children and adults, and for burials ; a Litany, which is
read every Sunday morning, and one for early service on
Easter morning, besides others which they call Liturgies,
and which are chiefly sung and chaunted. Some of their
services consist entirely in singing (the whole congregation
joining), when a succession of verses forms a connected
contemplation of some Scripture subject.
In marriage they may form a connection with those only
who are of their own communion. The brother who
marries a person not of their congregation, is considered
as having quitted their church-fellowship. There is,
however, no objection to a sister's marrying a person of
approved piety in another communion ; and some, by
express licence, are permitted still to join in their church
ordinances as before. A brother may make his own choice
of a partner in the society, and both parties may reject the
proposals made to them ; but as all intercourse between
the different sexes is less frequent among them than else-
where, and few opportunities of forming particular attach-
ments are found ; they usually rather refer the choice to
their friends and intimates, than decide for themselves.
As the lot must be cast to sanction their union, each re-
ceives his partner as a divine appointment ; and, however
strange this method may appear, there are perhaps no
where fewer unhappy marriages to be found than among
the Brethren.
In their settlements, at all hours, whether day or night,
some persons of both sexes are appointed by rotation to
pray for the society.
43
NESTORIAN CHRISTIANS.
Origin.—This Sect take their name from Nestorius, a
Syrian monk, who afterwards became a priest, and a
preacher of great celebrity, and was at length in 438,
raised to the see of Constantinople.
Progress.—The Nestorians formed so considerable a
body, that the Romanists exerted themselves to bring them
under the papal yoke, and with this view Innocent IV. in
1246, and Nicholas III. in 1278, used their utmost endea-
vours by means of Franciscan and Dominican missionaries,
but without success. However, about the middle of the
fifteenth century, these missionaries gained over to their
communion a small number of Nestorians, whom they
formed into a congregation, or church. In the sixteenth
century, the Nestorians were divided into two sects, which
separation has given rise to various factions, involving them
in the greatest dangers and difficulties. That division has
continued to the present day.
They are to be found scattered through Asia, also in
some parts of the Levant, and it is recorded of them, that
of all the Christian Societies established in the East, the
Nestorians have been the most careful and successful in
avoiding a multitude of superstitions belonging to the
Greek and Latin churches.
Tenets.—The main points that distinguish the Nesto-
rians from all other Christians, are their believing that the
Virgin Mary was not the Mother of Christ, as God, but
only as Man : and there were not only two Natures^ but
also two distinct Persons in the Son of God.
PRESBYTERIANS (SCOTCH).
Origin.—Presbyterianism, the national religion of Scot-
land, known also as "The Kirk of Scotland,'* was in-
troduced by John Knox into that country, about the year
1560 ; Presbyterianism then having begun to assume a re-
gular form of Church Government.
Progress.—From the time of the Reformation to that
of the Revolution, the Scotch Church was torn with con-
44 SCOTTISH RELIEF SYNOD,
tentions respecting her form of Church jurisdiction ;* the
court professing Episcopacy, and the people Presby-
terianism, and each prevailed by turns ; but on the acces-
sion of King William III., Presbyterianism was finally
settled to be the Established Religion, and being ratified by
the Union, is still maintained in that kingdom. The Kirk
now averages about 940 ministers, and 1,500,000 members.
Tenets.—Amidst the rapid revolutions in the govern-
ment of the Scottish Church, the established formulary of
faith seems to have remained unchanged. The Westmin-
ster Confession of Faith, which was approved and adopted
by the General Assembly of the Kirk of Scotland, August
27th, 1647, and what are called the Larger and Smaller
Catechisms, (which are generally bound up with it) con-
tain the public and avowed doctrines of this Church, which
formularies are Calvinistical, if not Supralapsarian.
Rites and Ceremonies.—In public worship, the Creed,
the Ten Commandments, and the Doxology, are not intro-
duced, and there is no observation in this Church of those
sacred Festivals referring to the events proclaiming the
celestial mission of our Saviour. There is no Lent Fast; no
kneeling at public prayer; no public worship of God with-
out a sermon or public instruction; no instrumental music,
no consecration of churches, or of burial grounds. No
funeral service or ceremony ; no sign of the cross in bap-
tism; no regular use of the Lord's Prayer ; and no adminis-
tration of the Holy Communion in private houses,—not
even to the sick and dying.
SCOTTISH RELIEF SYNOD.
The members of the Relief Synod, are a species of Dis-
senters in Scotland, whose chief ground of dissent from the
Establishment is,—the liberty and privilege they maintain
of choosing their own ministers.
Origin.—The immediate occasion of this separation, was
the deposition from the ministry of the Rev. Mr. Gillespie,
in 1752, whose professed views were different in some re?-
spects from the presbytery. He was summoned before
them, and deposed within a week.
* Vide Article Episcopalians (Scottish).
QUAKERS (or FRIENDs). 45
Progress.—A Rev. Mr. Boston was excluded with Mr.
Gillespie : these two gentlemen, together with a Mr.
Collier, of Fife, and some ordained elders, constituted
themselves into a " Presbytery of Relief," and took charge
of a congregation at Colinsburgh.
The Relief Synod now comprises seven presbyteries,
composed of upwards of eighty congregations. And the
whole number in communion with the synod, is estimated
at about 120,000.
Tenets.—In regard to doctrine and worship, they ad-
here to the standard and constitution of the Established
Kirk.
Their founder Mr. Gillespie declared that "his views
were to hold communion with all who appear to hold com-
munion with the Head, our Lord Jesus Christ, and with
such only.'' And their Synod has determined that it is
agreeably to the principles of the Synod of Relief, to
hold communion with visible saints in the Episcopalian
and Independent churches.
QUAKERS (OR FRIENDS).
Origin.—This Sect, which first appeared about 1648,
owes, its origin to an obscure individual of the name of
George Fox, a native of Drayton, in Leicestershire. Ob-
serving the vicious conduct of many professing Christians,
Fox went boldly forth, preaching with great zeal against
the vices they indulged in ; at the same time inveighing
violently against the established modes of worship, and
especially against a hired Ministry, which he conceived to
be contrary to Divine authority. This he did most inde-
fatigably in the public market places, at fairs, and some-
times in churches. This conduct, at length, drew upon Fox
the attention of the magistrates, who in the year 1649,
committed him to prison at Nottingham ; on his release,
he adopted the same line of conduct as before, and suffered
several subsequent imprisonments, besides enduring se-
veral persecutions.
The appellation of " Quakers^^ was bestowed upon the
Sect, by way of contempt ; some say on account of their
tremblings when under the impression of Divine things,
Avhich appeared in their public assemblies j but they them-
46 QUAKERS (or FRIENDS).
selves say, it was first given them by one of the magistrates
who committed George Fox to prison, on account of his
bidding him, and those about him, tremble at the word of
the Lord. The name of *'
Quaker,'^ whatever was its
origin, soon became their usual denomination, though they
themselves adopted the appellation of " Friends^
Progress.—Undismayed by persecution, the Friends in-
creased rapidly, and spread themselves over the Kingdom.
In 1652, they first set up separate assemblies in Lanca-
shire and the adjacent parts. In 1654, the first separate
meeting of Friends was opened in London, in Watling
Street. They subsequently opened a public meeting at the
Bull and Mouth Inn, in Aldersgate Street, ^*
where women
as well as men spoke as they were moved." Bristol, Col-
chester, Norwich, and other large towns, were visited by
their Preachers, and so great was the increase of the Sect,
that after the Restoration, when a fresh persecution was
raised against them, George Fox in 1662, represented to
the king, that 3,068 Friends had been imprisoned. While
a narrative signed by twelve witnesses, attested "that
4,200 of the people called Quakers, both men and women
were in prison." The Royal Declaration of Indulgence
in 1663, suspended for a short time the furious persecu-
tion of the Quakers; but under the Conventicle Act
of 1664, numbers of Friends were condemned to trans-
portation.
In 1666, their cause began to derive great support and
credit, from the distinguished abilities and virtues of the
celebrated William Penn, son of Admiral Penn, who then
joined the Society, and became one of its most eminent
advocates.
In 1671, George Fox visited Barbadoes. Others occa-
sionally had visited America at various periods, and a num-
ber of persons having embraced the principles of the
Society, George Fox came over in 1672, and settled meet-
ings of discipline for the care of the Poor, and the Regula-
tion of the Church. At this time there were meetings of
the Friends in most of the Colonies along the sea-coast,
—from Massachusetts as far south as the Carolinas.
In 1681, William Penn obtained from the Crown, in ac-
quittance of a debt due to Admiral Sir William Penn, his
father, a royal charter conveying to him the tract of coun-
try denominated Pennsylvania, and in the same year, he
QUAKERS (or FRIENDS), 47
sold to a company of merchants, and others, chiefly Quakers,
20,000 acres. In 1682, William Penn arrived in the river
Delaware, accompanied by 2000 emigrants, chiefly of his
own persuasion^ They founded the city of Philadelphia,
and settled themselves there, andin the adjacent Countries;
in each successive year their numbers were increased by
new emigrants from the mother Country ; and within four
years, the province contained 20 settlements, and Phila-
delphia 2000 inhabitants.
At the Restoration, a very severe act passed against
them, the tendency of which was, to compel them to take
oaths ; but at the Revolution, their scruples were re-
spected and relieved, and ever since 1722, their aflirma-
tion, or asseveration, has,—except we believe in criminal
cases,—been considered as equivalent to an oath.
The Friends are not an increasing sect.
There are at present ten yearly meetings—viz. London,
Dublin, New England, New York, Philadelphia, Balti-
more, Virginia, North Carolina, Ohio, and Indiana, which
include a total of about 150,000 members.
Tenets.—The Friends have no Confession of Faith in-
dependently of the Scriptures ; they may however be con-
sidered as strict Trinitarians, and in some sense as Ar-
minians.
The following may be looked upon as a brief sketch of
their peculiar Doctrines.
I. —They believe that under the Gospel dispensation, all
wars and fightings are strictly forbidden, the positive in-
junction of Jesus Christ, entirely precluding the indulgence
of those malignant passions from which such contests can
arise.
II.—They also apprehend that the express command of
our Lord and his Apostle James, " Swear not at all,'' pro-
hibits the Christian from the use of judicial as well as all
other oaths.
III.—With regard to the Christian Ministry, they be-
lieve that no individual has a right to assume the exclusive
exercise of this Ministry in a congregation of Christians.
But that all,—both male and female,—who are rightly
moved thereto, may exercise the gift. That this Ministry
being, if rightly received, received freely, and without any
pecuniary expense to qualify for it, it therefore ought to
be freely communicated, and no further support expected
48 QUAKERS Cor friends).
by Ministers, than what is authorized by Christ, and was
practised by his Apostles. Not feeling required to make
provision for their own Ministers whose ministry they ap-
prove, Friends deem themselves fully warranted in de-
clining to contribute to the support of others, and of a
form of worship, from both of which they conscientiously
dissent.
IV. —It being generally admitted that the Baptism of
Water, and a participation in the Outward Supper, are but
the signs of that essential Baptism of the Holy Ghost, in-
stituted by Christ ; and of the Communion of Saints, the
Society deem these external symbols wholly unnecessary.
V.—Friends consider all Holy-days as '*
shadows,''
w^hich ceased with the shadowy dispensation of the law
;
and that neither the first day of the week, nor any other
possesses any superior sanctity ; seeing, moreover, that the
appellation of days, months, and times are of idolatrous
and superstitious original, they esteem themselves bound
to follow the example of their Elders, in denominating the
months and days, " according to the plain, and Scriptural
way of expression.''
VI.—As simplicity and gravity in dress and demeanour
are consonant with the Christian character, the Society
recommends its members to observe plainness in their ap-
parel and the furniture of their houses; an adherence to
the use of the singular pronouns " Thee and Thou," when
addressing only one person ; and the disuse of the cus-
tomary salutations, and tokens of obeisance.
Rites and Ceremonies.—Marriage has always been re-
garded by Friends, as a religious, not a mere civil con-
tract; all marriages, are proposed at their meetings, for
concurrence ; which is granted if upon enquiry the parties
appear clear of other engagements, and if they also have
the consent of their parents or guardians ; without which
no marriages are allowed; this Society always refused
to acknowledge the exclusive authority of the Priests
to marry; their marriages are solemnized in a public
meeting for worship; and the monthly meeting keeps
a record of them ; as also of the births and burials of its
meinbers.
49
ROMAN CATHOLICS.
Origin.—This Sect consider the rise and progress of
their Church coeval with the Christian Religion. The
Apostles of Jesus Christ they look upon as its Foun-
ders, or rather as the Ministers employed by its Divine
Founder, Jesus Christ. St. Peter they regard as the first
Bishop of Rome, and the Popes as his immediate Succes-
sors.
The Church of Rome claims the honour of great exer-
tions, in having early extended a knowledge of Christianity
throughout the world, and ranks almost all the nations of
Europe in the list of her converts.
Progress. —Some of the peculiar doctrines of this
Church had made their appearance before the establish-
ment of the Papal power, which is generally dated in 606,
when Pope Boniface the Third assumed the title of Uni-
versal Bishop. Some, however, fix it in 756, when Pepin,
King of France, invested Pope Stephen the Second, with
the temporal dominion of Rome and the neighbouring
territories.
These were the progressive steps in the advancement of
that dominion which began with the establishment of the
Christian Religion under Constantine the Great. Rome
had so long been the seat of Empire, and the Mistress of
the World, that it was an easy matter for its Bishops to
gain an ascendancy. From these humble beginnings they
advanced with such well-directed ambition, that they es-
tablished a spiritual dominion over the minds and con-
sciences of men, to which all Europe submitted with
implicit obedience, until their formidable power was weak-
ened by The Reformation.
The following account of the present state of the Ro-
mish Church, is founded on the most recent and authentic
returns.
The Roman Catholic Religion is still the Established Re-
ligion in Italy and Sicily, in Spain and Portugal, in the
Sardinian Dominions, in Belgium, Bavaria, and some of the
minor German States, in Seven of the Swiss Cantons, and
in the Austrian Empire ; in France it is still predominant,
as in Ireland, and in some of the Greek islands ; it is also
E
50 ROMAN CATHOLICS.
the Established Religion of Mexico, and the South Ameri-
can Republics, as of the Spanish and Portuguese Colo-
nies.
Roman Catholics are numerous in some of the Protest-
ant States of Europe ; in Russia, Turkey, and the United
States ; and there are Syrian, Greek, and Armenian Catho-
lics, who acknowledge the Roman See. In India there
are supposed to be upwards of 750,000, reckoning the
native converts, and there are a few in China. Altogether
the total number of the population within the Romish
pale, may be estimated at between 120 and 130 millions.
Tenets.—The Church of Rome has all along received
the Apostles', the Nicene, and the Athanasian Creeds : —the
Creed of Pope Pius IV., containing the substance of the
Decrees and Canons of the famous Council of Trent, is
however now looked upon as the accredited and legiti-
mate Standard of her Faith.
Rites and Ceremonies.—The general division of Masses
is into high and low. High Mass, called also the Grand
Mass, is that sung by the choristers, and celebrated with
the assistance of a deacon and a sub-deacon. Low Mass,
wherein the prayers are barely rehearsed, without any
singing, and performed without much ceremony, or the
assistance of a deacon and sub-deacon. The music on
these occasions is generally as full and as rich as pos-
sible.
The Mass used at sea is called the Dry Mass, because
on those occasions the cup is omitted, lest the motion of
the vessel should occasion any of the consecrated wine,
which is the blood of God, to be spilled.
The Feasts and Fasts of the Catholic Church are nume-
rous, and are observed by them with great veneration
and punctuality. Easter is kept with peculiar zeal and
solemnity by the Catholics ; so is Christmas, and other
holidays of that kind. Lent is also very rigidly observed
])y them.
Every good Catholic, on entering his place of worship,
first dips his finger in the holy water, placed near the
door ; then crossing himself, gently bends the knee
—
looking towards the altar.
51
SANDEMANIANS (OR GLASSITES).
Origin.—This sect arose in Scotland about the year 1728,
and were originally called Glassites, after their founder,
Mr. John Glas, Minister of the Parish of Tealing, near
Dundee, who, having given offence to some of his brethren
by avowing notions of Justifying Faith, differing from
those of the acknowledged Standards, was prosecuted before
the provincial synod of Angus and Mearns, and ultimately
deposed by the General Assembly in 1730.
Progress.—After his deposition, Mr. Glas continued
to exercise his ministry, and, from among his numerous fol-
lowers, he formed a congregation upon his own principles,
who assembled first at Tealing, and subsequently erected a
church at Dundee.
In the course of a few years, smaller congregations were
" put into church order " at Edinburgh, Perth, Glasgow,
and many principal towns in Scotland. Mr. Glas died in
1773, at the age of 78. In the mean time, a powerful
coadjutor appeared in Mr. Robert Sandeman, an elder in
one of the Scotch churches, who, having embraced Mr.
Glas's principles, and grafted upon them his own peculiar
views, published in 1757 the " Letters on Theron and
Aspasio,'' which led to the well-known " Sandemanian
Controversy." Chiefly, as it was commonly said, in con-
sequence of reading those Letters, and the Author's cor-
respondence with Mr. S. Pike, a lecturer at Pinner's Hall,
several persons in London, whither Mr. Sandeman went
in 1760, became proselytes to his principles and opinions,
and in 1762, formed themselves into a congregation, which
was joined, in 1765, by Mr. Pike, who became their most
distinguished preacher.
Some smaller congregations were afterwards formed
upon the same principles in different parts of England.
These have been denominated Sandemanians ; while in
Scotland, the congregations of this communion retain the
name of Glassites. Mr. Sandeman went to America in
1764, and collected several congregations in New England.
He died there in 1771, at the age of 53, two years before
Mr. Glas. The Glassites were not at any period a nu-
merous sect, and they are now, with the exception of a
few surviving congregations, merged in other Dissenters.

52 SHAKERS (or SHAKING QUAKERS).
Tenets.—They deem it unlawful alike to hold spiritual
communion with other Churches, or to have any familiar
intercourse with excommunicated persons of their own
persuasion. They conceive it even unlawful to join in
prayer with any one who is not a brother or a sister ; and
family prayer being, as they conceive, not enjoined by
any express precept or precedent in the New Testament,
is very generally disregarded by them.
Rites and Ceremonies.—Among their practices and
observances are, the Weekly Celebration of the Lord^s
Supper ; their Love-feasts ; the Kiss of Charity on the
admission of a new member, and other occasions ; their
abstinence from blood, and from things strangled; and
washing of each other's feet.
SHAKERS (OR SHAKING QUAKERS).
Origin.—This Sect, although now confined to the United
States, had its rise in Lancashire.
According to a statement authorized by themselves, the
Founders of the Sect were James Wardley, a tailor by
trade, and Jane his wife, and the work under them began
at Bolton, and Manchester, about the year 1747. They'
had belonged to the Society of Friends ; but receiving a
further degree of light and power, they continued for
several years disconnected with every denomination.
During this time they received, both by Vision and Reve-
lation, the testimony **
that the Second Appearance of
Christ was at hand, and that the Church was rising in her
full and transcendant glory.''
Progress.—A small Society was at length formed under
their special ministry, which held its meetings alternately
at Bolton, and Manchester. " Sometimes, after assembling
together, and sitting awhile in silent meditation, they
were taken with a mighty trembling, under which they
would express the indignation of God, against all sin.-
At other times they were affected, under the power of
God, with a mighty shaking ! and the}^ were occasionally
exercised in singing, shouting, or walking the floor under
the influence of spiritual signs, swiftly passing and re-
passing each other. From these strange exercises, the
people received the name of " Shakers,'' which, though
SOUTHCOTTONIANS. 53
intended in derision, they acknowledged to be properly
applied to them.
The work went on, under Wardley, till the year 1770,
when a new impulse was given to the Society by Ann Lee.
She was the daughter of a blacksmith of Manchester
;
where she also, at an early age, became the wife of a
blacksmith. She was herself a cutter of hatters' fur.
She had joined the Society about 1758, and w^as now re-
cognised as the Leader of the Sect. She was addressed
as " the Elect Lady," and ''
the Mother Elect,'' ''
the
first Spiritual Parent in the line of the Covenant," &c. &c.
To such as addressed her by her proper name, she would
reply, **
I am Anne, the Word !"
These impious arrogations having been made the subject
of a criminal prosecution, she was committed to prison,
and afterwards confined .in a madhouse. To escape from
further persecution, in 1774, she set sail for New York
with her husband, brother, and other followers, and in
that State, this strange sect has found the means of per-
petuating itself. Her first community was formed at
Watervliet, near Albany, where she died in 1784.
Dr. Dwight states," that she claimed the power to work
Miracles, and tp speak with Tongues." Societies were
soon organized at New Lebanon, in New York, and at
Enfield in Connecticut, and have gradually increased to
their present number, which averages 5,000. Their pro-
perty is all in common ; and the members are distinguished
for their industry and morality. Celibacy is enjoined;
and the Sect is kept up entirely by Proselytes. The office
of Leader is bestowed by impulse or revelation on him
who has the gift to assume it. Dr. Dwight says, ''
The
power of working Miracles they still claim. They declare
that they have visions of the invisible world, and that
spirits converse with them."
SOUTHCOTTONIANS.
Origin.—This Sect of singular fanatics, took their rise
from Johanna Southcott, a vulgar visionary, whose extra-
vagant pretensions attracted a numerous band of converts
in London, and its vicinity. She was born in the West of
England, about the year 1750, of parents in a very humble

sphere of life, and, while in service at Exeter, being car-
ried away either by a heated imagination, or determined
imposture—it being extremely difficult to decide which
—
gave herself out ^s the Woman spoken of in Revelations,
persuading herself that She held converse with the DeviL
and communion with the Holy Ghost; and although warned
of her delusion by a Dissenting minister, she found some
clergymen of the Establishment credulous enough to coun-
tenance her pretensions.
Progress.—In 1792, She assumed the character of a
Prophetess, and of **
The Woman in the Wilderness," and
began to give sealed papers to her followers, which were
called her *'
Seals," and which were to protect both from
the judgments of the present, and a future life. They are
said to have been applied for by thousands.
Although in the highest degree illiterate, She turned
author, and wrote a mass of unintelligible nonsense, de-
livering her predictions both in prose and doggrel rhyme.
These effusions, besides containing some personal threaten-
ings against her opponents, related principally to impend-
ing judgments upon the surrounding nations, and the
speedy approach of the Millennium.
In 1814, after She had passed her grand climacteric, she
was seized with a disorder, which subsequently gave her
the outward appearance of pregnancy, and she announced
herself as the mother of the Shiloh, promised by Jacob,
whose speedy advent she predicted. Some months before
this period, she had given notice of her supposed situation,
and invited the opinion of the faculty. Several of them,
admitted her pregnancy, (among whom was Dr. Reece).
Others doubted, and some (among whom was Dr. Sims),
absolutely denied it. Her followers, however, were full
of confidence, and some of them, who were rich, made
many costly presents, particularly a Bible, which cost forty
pounds ; and a superb cot (or cradle) made of the most
expensive materials, and highly decorated, the value of
which was two hundred pounds. About ten weeks before
Christmas, she was confined to her bed, and took very
little sustenance, until at last, pain and sickness reduced
her to the lowest state of human existence. Mr. Want, a
surgeon, warned her of her approaching end, and pre-
scribed some medicine to alleviate her sufferings, but she
was deaf to advice, and insisted that all her sufferings were
SWEDENBORGIANS. 55
only preparatory to the birth of The Shiloh. Subsequently,
however, she had some misgivings, during some compara-
tively lucid intervals, in which she declared that " if she
was deceived, she had, at all events, been the sport of some
Spirit, either good or evil." She, also, at the last, ad-
mitted the possibility of a temporary dissolution, and ex-
pressly ordered that means should be taken to preserve
warmth in her, for four days, after which, She was to
revive and be delivered ; or in failure, she gave permission
to be opened.
December 27th, She actually died, and the symptoms
v/ere so decisive, that her disciples had no hope but in her
Resurrection. At the end, however, of four days and
nights, the body appeared discoloured, and exhibited signs
of approaching putrefaction. She was then opened in the
presence of fifteen medical men, when it was ascertained
that her complaints arose from bile and flatulency, from
indulgence and want of exercise. Her remains were con-
veyed for interment, under a fictitious name, to the bury-
ing ground attached to the Chapel in St. John's Wood,
where a large tombstone, containing quotations from the
Bible, and her own; writings, has been erected by her de-
termined followers, who still remain unconvinced of their
delusion,—not being undeceived, either by her death, or dis-
section.
SWEDENBORGIANS.
Origin.—This Sect derive their origin, and their name,
from Baron Swedenborg, a learned Swede, born at Stock-
holme in 1688, and who died in London in 1772.
In 1743, the Baron asserts **The Lord manifested him-
self to him in a personal appearance, and at the same time
opened his spiritual eyes, so that he was enabled con-
stantly to see and converse with Saints and Angels.'^ He
shortly afterwards began to print and publish the Reve-
lations obtained by intercourse with the World of Spirits.
These mystical works, all of which bear extraordinary
titles, commenced in 1749, and terminated in 1771. They
consist of fourteen quarto volumes, and numerous small
treatises.
Progress. —After Baron Swedenborg's decease, his
56 SWEDENBORGIANS.
theological writings began to attract much more notice
than they had obtained in his life time. They were much
sought after, and speedily translated from the Latin into
German, English, and French. His works now found nu-
merous readers, and no fewer than fifty clergymen of the
established Church of England are stated, at this time,
to have become satisfied of the truth of Swedenborg's Re-
velations. About 1788, a number of his disciples formed
themselves into a distinct religious Society, under the name
of " The New Jerusalem Church," and at a General Con-
ference of the Members held in London in 1789, a sum-
mary of the doctrines of the New Church, extracted from
the Baron's waitings by a committee of his followers, was
adopted as the authentic exposition of their creed ; and a
general Liturgy has since been drawn up,
A General Conference is now held annually. At the
Fifteenth Conference, held in Manchester, in August 1822,
there were eight Ministers, and thirty-seven Delegates, re-
presenting twenty-four Congregations. The number of
recognised members in Great Britian was at that time es-
timated at between 2,500 and 3,000 ; but the number of
attendants, and general favourers of the doctrines, was far
greater. In Lancashire, where they are most numerous,
they were supposed to amount to 10,000. In London they
have now three chapels. In Scotland they have three or
four small congregations. In Ireland one ; but in Wales
none.
In the United States of America the Swedenborgians
average about 4,000. In Sweden there are a few who
have embraced these tenets, but they are not allowed the
public exercise of their worship ; and other believers in
Swedenborg are scattered over the Continent.
Tenets.—The leading doctrine of this Church, as incul-
cated in the writings of the Baron, relates to the person
of Jesus Christ, and to the redemption wrought, not pur-
chased, by Him. On this subject it is insisted, that Jesus
Christ is Jehovah, manifested in the flesh, and that he
came into the world to glorify his human nature, by mak-
ing it one with the Divine. It is, therefore, insisted fur-
ther, that the humanity of Jesus Christ is itself Divine, by
virtue of its indissoluble union with the indwelling Father,
and that thus, as to his humanity. He is the Mediator be-
tween God and man, since there is now no other medium
SYRIAN CHRISTIANS. 57
of God's access to man, or of man's access to God, but this
Divine Humanity, which was assumed for this purpose„
Thus it is taught, that in the person of Jesus Christ,
dwells the whole Trinity of Father, Son, and Holy
Spirit.
On the subject of the Redemption wrought by this In-
carnate God, it is taught, that it consisted not in the vica-
rious Sacrifice of one God, as to satisfy the justice, or, to
appease the wrath of another God, but in the real subju-
gation of the Powers of Darkness and their removal from
man, by continual combats and victories over them, during
His abode in the world ; and in the consequent descent to
man of divine power and life, which was brought near
to him in the thus glorified humanity of this combating
God.
Rites and Ceremonies.—The Swedenborgians retain
the two Sacraments of Baptism and the Lord^s Supper,
which they saj^ are the only rites insisted on, by the Au-
thor whose testimony they receive.
SYRIAN CHRISTIANS.
The Origin of this Indian branch of the Syrian Church,
which still exists in Travancore and Cochin, is involved in
obscurity.
The Syrian Christians formerly enjoyed political as-
cendancy in Malabar. When Vasco de Gama reached
India in 1503, he was shown the sceptre of the last
Christian King of Malayala. The Portuguese Missionaries
were surprised to find upwards of a hundred Christian
Churches on the Coast of Malabar. "When they acquired
sufl&cient power, they compelled the native Christians on
the sea-coasty to acknowledge the supremacy of the
Pope ; but the Churches of the interior refused to yield
to Rome, and under the protection of the native princes,
maintained their Ecclesiastical independence.
In a paper recently communicated to The Royal Asiatic
Society, it is stated that these Christians are still divided
into those 'who adhere to their primitive Tenets, called
''
Syrian Christians of Malayala ;" and those who have
adopted the Ordinances of the Papal See, and are called
" Syro-Roman Catholics.'' Of the former class, there are

fifty-seven churches or congregations, comprehending
about 13,500 families, or 70,000 individuals; of the latter,
there are ninety- seven churches, the congregations be-
longing to which, amounts to 90,000 persons; besides
which, there is a large number of converts obtained from
other tribes, making a total of 150,000 persons.
Tenets.—The creed of the ^*
Syrian Christians, " is
assimilated to that of the Western Churches ; the Liturgy
is that which was formerly used in the Churches of the
Patriarchate of Antioch, which Patriarch they acknow-
ledge as their head.
Rites and Ceremonies.—These resembl-e those of the
Greek Church. No sculptured images are admitted except
crucifixes ; but paintings are seen in all the Churches, in
which the Virgin is always the chief personage. Much
incense is also used.
UNITARIANS.
Origin.—Unitarianism in England dates almost as far
back as' the earliest 'translation of the Bible, for Strype,
in his Memoirs of Archbishop Cranmer, says :
—" There
were now (1548) other heresies vented abroad, as the
denial of the Trinity, and the Deity of the Holy Ghost."
In 1551, a German, named George Van Paris, was burned
at London for this heresy ; and four years after, another
person at Uxbridge. Joan Bocher, sometimes called
" The Maid of Kent,*' was a more distinguished victim.
She was a lady of family and education, and possessed
heroic courage. Edward VI. could hardly be prevailed
upon to consent to her execution, and signed the warrant,
saying to Cranmer, that he must be responsible for the sin.
Progress.—Notwithstanding persecution, the Sect in-
creased, so much so, that under James I., a large number
of persons, some of them of rank and consideration, were
executed for the same offence. During the Common-
wealth they seem to have met with milder treatment.
John Biddle, their leader, was at last, however, thrown by
Cromwell into prison, where he died in 1662. An act of
the Long Parliament, making the profession of Unitarian-
ism a felony, was mitigated by King William III., and was
repealed altogether in 1813; and they now stand on the

same footing as all other Dissenters from the Established
Church.
Dr. Priestley may be considered as the Founder of the
modern Unitarian School in this Country ; to his writings
and influence, the progress of Unitarian principles during
the latter part of the last century, may be chiefly
ascribed; among his coadjutors may be mentioned the
Rev. Theophilus Lindsey, a beneficed clergyman, who,
in 1773, resigned his living, and afterwards preached to a
congregation of his own principles in Essex Street, Strand.
The attendance was at no time very numerous, nor can it be
said the sect has greatly increased, although receiving a
powerful aid from the abilities and ministry of Mr. Belsham.
The places occupied by Unitarian congregations through-
out England, amounts to 206 ; only thirty-six, or little
more than a sixth, have been erected by persons of those
sentiments. The greater part are maintained by old
Presbyterian endowments, and not more than six can
boast of large congregations.
Their Colleges at Hackney, Exeter, and Warrington
are all extinct, and that at York, which alone survives, is
sustained by orthodox endowments.
In France, many 'of the Protestant Clergy reject the
Trinitarian scheme of Christian doctrine ; the principal
sources of supply for the French ministry of the French
Churches, are the schools of Geneva and Montauban,
where the Unitarian system has the ascendancy. In 1832,
a society was formed in Paris, called the Unitarian Asso-
ciation of France.
In British Asia, a native society of Unitarian Christians
has existed for several years at Madras, under the care of
William Roberts, a native ; but a much more remarkable
development of opinion of this kind occurred in the case
of the distinguished Bramin, the late Rammohun Roy, of
Calcutta, who in his publications in English, called " The
Precepts of Jesus,'' and also in his " First,'' " Second and
Final Appeal to the Christian Public," has directed and in-
fluenced the thoughts of numbers of his'countrymen to the
Anti-Trinitarian doctrines therein promulgated, and was,
since 1827, to the period of "his decease, associated with
distinguished individuals, of both the native and European
population, in the support of Christian worship according
to the Unitarian faith.

In America, Unitarian opinions appear to have been ex-
tensively adopted in Massachusetts, as early as the middle
of the last century; in 1756, appeared "Emlyn's Humble
Inquiry into the Scripture Account of Jesus Christ;" this
work was published at Boston, and had an extensive cir-
culation. In 1785, one of the three Episcopal Churches of
that city adopted a Liturgy, excluding the recognition of
the Trinitarian doctrine. In 1786, Mr. Lindsey had opened
a correspondence with the Anti-Trinitarians in America,
and having received intelligence of the spread of Unitarian-
ism, induced Dr. Priestley's emigration thither in 1794.
He formed a congregation at Philadelphia. In 1819, a
congregation was gathered at Baltimore, and others now
exist in New York, Philadelphia, Washington, Charleston,
Pittsburg, Cincinnati, and other principal cities of the
Union.
In America, the Unitarians are divided into two classes
:
" The Congregational," and " The Christian." The num-
ber of Churches organized according to the Congrega-
tional form, average from 1 70 to 200 : while the deno-
mination called Christians, which is numerous, parti-
cularly in the Western States, reckon from 700 to 1,000
Churches.
Tenets.—Unitarians profess to derive their views from
Scripture, and to make it the ultimate arbiter in all
religious questions. They undertake to show that, inter-
preted according to the settled laws of language, the uni-
form testimony of the Sacred Writings is, that the Holy
Spirit has no personal existence, distinct from the Father,
and that the Son is a derived and dependent Being,
whether as some believe, created in some remote period of
time, or, as others, beginning to live when He appeared on
earth.
They insist that Ecclesiastical History enables them to
trace to obsolete systems of Heathen Philosophy, the intro-
duction of the received doctrine into the Church, in
which, once received, it has been sustained on grounds
quite independent of its merits, and they aver that it is
satisfactorily refuted by the Biblical passages, when rightly
understood, which are customarily adduced in its support.
LONDON : STEWART AND MURRAY, OLD BAILEY,

The New Library of Useful Knowledge will be found to
conform strictly to its title. The whole Series will consist of
works of practical utility ; and the subjects are mostly such as
have not been adopted in the former publications of the Society for
Promoting Useful Knowledge. They are of every-day interest,
and the manner of treating them will, it is hoped, prove to be
both clear and familiar. Each subject will be completed in one
Number.
Upon a comparison of this Series of Works, with others of a
similar nature, it will be seen that, as regards composition, printing,
and quantity of matter, they have not any rival.
Tlie following are already published, and will be succeeded
by others about once a fortnight.
1. Flower Gardener's Manual.
2. English Cookery.
3. The Horse ; its Habits, Diseases, Management, &c.
4. Kitchen Gardener's Manual.
