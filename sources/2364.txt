CHAPTER I
T IS time for Soulcrafters
generally to acquire a
working knowledge of ap­
plied Numerology, each
in his own right, so that
he may profit from the
wealth of hidden enlightenment in this
"mathematical branch” of Esoterics.
Understand, Numerology is not As­
trology and it has nothing to do with
fortune-telling or predicting the future
excepting as it reveals lives that make for
mortal weal or woe.
The study itself has come down to us
across something like 3,000 years, having
been originated in the forms we now have
it, by Pythagoras, the great Greek phi­
losopher, mathematician and mystic. It
has a wholly respectable and authentic
background.
The basis for it, taken collectively, is
the argument that each letter of the al­
phabet represents a numerical vibration,
just as each digit of the nine digits repre­
sents a numerical valuation. These, taken
in assembly, indicate the vibration on
which the person is operating, as well as
the Life Path he is following in respect
to the numbers that total his birth-date.
Just why all this should be so, is one
of the great mysteries associated with
Cosmos and the Eternal Verities. All we
know is, that when you figure a person’s
Numerology correctly in respect to his
christened name, you have an infallible
clue to his character, just as you have an
infallible chart of his earthly destinies
when you accurately determine his Life
Path. You may figure it out in ten thou­
sand cases, applying to ten thousand per­
sons, and you will never make a miss,
just as you may add 6 and 3 ten thou­
sand times and get 9 without a miss.

r | 'HE FIRST thing for the novice to
know about Numerology is the nu­
merical significance of the letters of the
English alphabet. The alphabets of other
languages, such as Greek or Arabic, have
their own letter-significances which are no
part of our present examination. Here is
the indispensable chart of the letter sig­
nificances which should be preserved in
order to get the sense of what follows in
later papers—
know is the fact that in Numerology, all
digits are added horizontally instead of
vertically, and totals are in turn added
to the lowest possible sum. To illustrate,
A B C D E F G H I

The stjeond thing for the novice to
you want to know the Numerology of the
girl-friend whose christened name was
Mary Jane Smith. Remember you’ve got
to have her accurate christened name, for
that was the name her parents chose for
her in response to the vibration of her
spiritual self, and this circumstance ac­
counts for the long and acrimonious con­
troversies that often arise in "naming the
baby.” Mother wants the new child—if
it proves to be masculine—called Oswald
and father wants it called Jack, or John.
Father hopes it won’t be a girl but if it
is, he insists she shall carry the name of
Elizabeth, whereas mother has "an in­
tuitive feeling” that she should be known
as Joan. They compromise, after the baby
comes and its sex is known, on a name or
combination of names that seem satisfac­
tory to both. What they are truly doing,
the Wisdom informs us, is finding a
combination of names whose letters total
the cosmic vibration of the small soul
that has arrived to join the family circle.
And the christened name is the cosmic
8
seal on this name, in a manner of speak­
ing. So, to return to Mary Jane Smith,
and finding the significance in the digits,
we "chart” the three name-words as fol­
lows—
MARY JANE SMITH
4197 1155 14928
Adding these horizontally into a gross
sum, we get the figure 57. Adding this
57 horizontally again, to reduce it to the
next smallest sum in turn, we get 12,
and adding this again horizontally we
finally get the digit 3.
considering the overall vibration on which
she is living.
At any rate, with the Basic Chart of
the numerical significances set forth in
this first paper, you may be able to fig­
ure your own Personality Vibration and
be ready for interpretation of its total
as will be set forth in a working inter­
pretation of each of the nine digits in our
Numerological Paper of next week.

CHAPTER II
HE SECOND important
thing to know in grasp­
ing the significances of
Numerology, after you
have familiarized yourself
with the numerical values
of the twenty-six alphabetical letters, is
the categories into which the numbers
fall. There are three of these, and they
should be understood for the peculiar
ways in which they seem to work out in
the practical affairs of life. We approach
the problem in this manner—
The progressions of life divide into
three departments or planes—
The Physical;
The Mental;
The Spiritual;
within each of which there are in turn
three classifications. We term the Digits
One, two and Three the "physical” ma­
terial, or social numbers, we term the
Digits Four, Five and Six the Mental or
Worldly Expression numbers; we term
the Digits Seven, Eight and Nine the
Spiritual or Artistic Numbers. Charting
it so that you have it in your mind’s eye,
we say that the various figures manifest
the following general significances—
1 Physical or Social;
2 Physical or Social;
3 Physical or Social;
4 Mental or Worldly Expression;
5 Mental or Worldly Expression;
6 Mental or Worldly Expression;
7 Spiritual or Artistic;
8 Spiritual or Artistic;
9 Spiritual or Artistic;
Translating these into practical aspects,
the people whose name-totals or birth­
path numerals reduce either to One, Two,
or Three—with the exception of 11 and
22x as we will explain later—are in in life
to function chiefly on the material plane.
The people whose name-totals or birth-
11
paths reduce to Four, Five and Six, are
in life to function chiefly on Intellectual
Planes. The people whose name-totals or
birth-paths reduce either to Seven, Eight
or Nine are in life to function chiefly
in various kinds of Spiritual Manifesta­
tion, Writing, Art, Sculpture. Painting,
Poetry or Teaching.
However, in interpretation of the vari­
ous numbers on each one of these planes
or programs, we get some strange lines
of activity . .
r | 'HE ONE number, whether we en-
A counter it on the Physical. Intellec-
tual or Spiritual planes, is ever the Pio­
neering or Soldier-of-Fortune number.
"One’’, "Four” and "Seven”, therefore,
are the Pioneering or Soldier-of-Fortune
specification for the three categories.
The Two Number—with its corre­
sponding significance of Five and Eight
on the Intellectual and Spiritual octaves
—is the Partnership or Polarity number.
The Three Number—with its corre-
spending representations of Six and Nine
on the Intellectual and Spiritual Octaves
is the Culminating or Success Number,
the highest point to which the human
soul makes progress on such octave as
we find it expressing.
So, repeating these in a column for
your mental picturing or future reference,
the chart of the nine numbers signifies
as follows—
1 Physical or Material Pioneering;
2 Physical or Material Partnership;
3 Physical or Material Success;
4 Mental or Intellectual Pioneering;
5 Mental or Intellectual Polarity;
6 Mental or Intellectual Success;
7 Spiritual or Esthetic Pioneering;
8 Spiritual or Esthetic Polarity;
9 Spiritual or Esthetic Success;
In reading either personal character, or
determining what the individual’s lesson
is, to be learned in life from the birth-
date, we get our first generalization by
referring to this last chart.
13
However, in actual working out day
unto day and year unto year, we discover
that each of these nine numbers has par­
ticular characteristics when we come to in­
terpret what Pioneering, Polarity or Suc­
cess means on each of the three octaves.
Long practice or application in figuring
the charts of great numbers of persons
gradually defines the specialty which the
given digit represents. Meaning this—
HYSICAL or Material Pioneering is
not difficult to recognize for precise­
ly what it is. Physical or Material Part­
nerships are as readily understood, and
so are Physical or Material Successes.
But when we come to mental or Intellect­
ual Pioneering, or Mental or Intellectual
14
Polarities, or Mental or Intellectual Suc­
cesses, wc find the applications assuming
strange guises. And that goes as well for
Spiritual or Esthetic Pioneering, Spiritu­
al or Esthetic Polarities, or Spiritual or
Esthetic Success.
When we talk about Pioneering Men­
tally or Intellectually, and observe what
its practical effects are in day to day liv­
ing, we discover it indicates the Engineer,
the Architect, the Inventor, the Explorer,
into odd fields and odder ideas. That
isn’t difficult to understand or follow.
But when we come to the Five Nu-
meral, it seems to carry more significance
than merely implying the union of one
mind or intellect with another mind or
intellect. Five, we discover, is the great
Dramatic or Change number. Mind re­
acting on Mind, or Intellect on Intellect,
doesn’t seem to be seeking affinity and
status camaraderie so much as facile
adaptation translates into physical or ma­
terial alterations, more than eternal com­
patibilities . .
CHAPTER III
now a gentleman
from Pennsylvania, all hot
and bothered, who says
that Florence Campbell,
who wrote, Your Days
Are Numbered, places the
values of 11 and 22 on the letters of the
alphabet K and V respectively, so why
doesn’t Soulcraft do the same? In these
Numerological papers, Soulcraft doesn’t
bother with it at this stage of instruction
because in working out Numerological
charts, nothing is altered by giving K and
V the designations Miss Campbell speci­
fies.
In working out any chart, additions of
digits are always horizontal instead of
vertical, and when all digits in a given
name—whether for Inner or Outer ex­
pression—or any life-path, are reduced to
the lowest possible term, the results are
the same whether K and V be figured at
11 and 22, or 2 and 4.
For instance, a woman’s name is Kath-
lyn Vines, we’ll say. The name Kathlyn
Vines totals to 7, whether the K be called
2 or II, or the V be called 4 or 22. Here
is the addition of each—
KATHLYN
2 1 2 8 3 7 5
VINES
4 9 5 5 1
28 24
1 6
Kathlyn with K counted as 11 would
add up to 37, which would in turn add
to 10 (3 and 7) and we always strike off
the zeros as having no significance. Vines
with the V called 22 would add to 42,
which in turn would add to 6. And 1 and
6 are 7 in any man’s arithmetic. What
difference does it make?
So much for Florence Campbell, for
whom Soulcraft has a high regard, by the
way, only Soulcraft’s numerology is based
17
on the conclusions of Pythagoras and
The Golden Scripts for significances,
Chapter 85.
To get back to significances of Num­
bers where we left off on Page 15 . .
'T’HE NUMBER 6 in Numerology is
generally conceded to be the "lucky ’
number of the entire nine. Or, as some
authorities express it, 6 is the number of
worldly success and good fortune. The
highest expression of the Mental Octave,
it applies intellect to the great social body
and gets the highest form of mental dex­
terity, that supposedly activates in world­
ly advantage. Whoever has a 6 for a
totality in his chart, may call that the
gods can be expected to smile on him.
Particularly is this so, if his Life-Path
total to a six.
And while we’re •Lt ut it, this might
a
1
be as good a place as any to expound
this Life-Path business . .
The day on which you drew your first
breath of life organically, did not hap-
pen by accident. It expressed something
in your earthly career. It expressed the vi­
bration of your mission in life. Probably
for such reason there exists such variation
in the exact days after conception that
different babies are born. Some infants
arrive prematurely; others for no ac­
countable reason are delayed. The prin­
ciple that seems operating is the business
of permitting the infant to make its ad­
vent on a day indicating its life errand.
For instance, let’s say you were bom
on May 25, 1903. May is the 5th month
of the year, which gives us a 5. The fig­
ure 25 adds to 7. The year 1903 adds to
13, which in turn adds to 4. So we add
5 and 7 and 4, and get 16, which again
reduces to a 7. (6 and 1). You are there­
fore on a 7-Life-Path, which is the first
plane of the Spiritual Cycle.
’ I ’HE THREE planes of the Spiritual
Cycle are indicated by 7, 8, and 9.
Seven indicates—like 1 and 4 in the phys­
ical and mental octaves—the Pioneering
19
or Soldier-of-Fortune number, the person
who experiments and explores. Usually it
indicates, especially when it represents
die Life-Path, a certain amount of dis­
tressful experiencing, because whoever ex­
plores in spirit is bound to encounter vi­
cissitudes that make for emotional upset.
Such, at least, is the way it works out
practically, although the Great Teacher
—in Chapter 85 of the Golden Scripts—
has many wonderful connotations to give
to the number 7.
The number 8, is spirituality exercised
on an octave of liaison with partners or
circumstances, and queerly enough we
discover it demonstrating in an outstand­
ing financial ability. More great bankers,
financiers, and captains of industry seem
to be Eights in either their names or life­
paths than any other number. Generally
speaking, when we encounter an 8, we
can make a safe wager that if the per­
son isn’t a natural adept in money mat­
ters, he or she has the ability latent with­
in him. Eights are generally clever, how-
20
ever, in any managerial capacities, are
lovers of consistency and order, and are
inclined to make their spiritual expres­
sions extremely practical, while at the
same time naturally at home in big affairs.
The Number 9s, of course, represent
the apex of all the numbers, and express
spirituality in its applications or demon­
strations to society at large. Interestingly
enough, this application or demonstra­
tion takes the form either of Art or
Teaching—"inspiring others” in some
form would be the better way to put it.
Holy Writ tells us that "Nines are the
numbers of the sons of God”, and prob­
ably this connotation conveys most graph­
ically this same illumination and inspira­
tion idea. Classed as 9s we find artists,
poets, clergymen, philanthropists, religious
leaders generally, and persons who live
their lives for others altruistically. At any
rate, when a person’s name figures out to
a 9, or his Life-Path totals to a 9, you
find a character who discovers his great­
est happiness and satisfaction in trying
21
to elevate the human, race to highest con­
sciousness of the eternal verities.
These generally, are the over-all
expressings of the nine digits. Now let’s
look at some practical applications . .
CHAPTER IV
dY it should be so, we
cannot say, but we do
know that in practical
application the letters in
the name divide, as to
vowels and consonants, so
that the former indicates the Inner ex­
pression of the personality, and the lat­
ter the Outer. In other words, the Inner
Expression, as indicated by the addition
of all the vowels, signifies what the soul
seems to have attained in its eternal cos­
mic climb over the entire series of physi­
cal lives it has lived, while the consonants
signify what the soul’s demonstration
happens to be in its current life—that is,
how it will react in its social contacts of
the present.
What we do, to get the Inner and
Outer Expressions, is place all the sig­
nificances of the vowels on a line over
23
the full christened name—names volun­
tarily assumed don’t count in the "eter­
nal” valuations—and the significances of
the consonants below. Then we make ad­
ditions of these and interpret their sig­
nificances. For instance, let’s consider the
name John Paul Jones, and look for its
Inner and Outer meanings. Here would
be the set-up for our additions—
6 13 6 5
JOHN PAUL JONES
1 8 5 7 3 1 5 1
Adding 6, 1, 3, 6 and 5 for the sig­
nificances of the vowels, we get 21, which
further reduces to 3. Adding 1, 8, 5, 7,
3, 1, 5 and 1 we get 31 or 4.
The Inner Expression of J. P. Jones
would be 3 and the Outer Expression 4.
The whole name would therefore give us
a 7—the sum of 3 Inner and 4 Outer.
Determining the significances of Mr.
Jones’ Name-Numerology, we would de­
clare somewhat as follows—
24
T^HREE is the great "social comity”
number, the designation of the Ac-
tionist, who interprets the phenomena of
living in terms of physical activity. That
would also imply leadership of a sort in
practical matters, insofar as the soul’s in­
ner or esoteric urges were concerned.
Four is the number of technical, engi­
neering, or mechanical expression, explor­
ing in terms of mechanistic activity.
Here you have a man who would "get
along” with people normally, in smooth
and efficient fashion, be generally ac­
cepted and liked for his temperamental
reactions to mankind in the mass. But in
«
the practical expressions of this, he would
tend to some form of mechanistic or en­
gineering leadership.
Perhaps you discern, by the way, how
perfectly these qualifications describe such
a man as the original John Paul Jones,
founder of the United States Navy. His
whole number made a Seven, which in­
cidentally is the number standing for
Spiritual Pioneering. He would go
25
through a certain amount of spiritual tra­
vail in his earthly career, encounter diffi­
culties and quandaries that broadened
and deepened his Spirit. Which he did!
HE CELEBRATED John Paul Jones
of the American Navy was born on
July 6, 1747, by the way, which put him
on this birth-path—
July 6, 1747
7 6 19
32

The Five Birth-Path, as we have had
explained, signifies dramatic changes and
secular alterations, training the soul in
facile orientations and adjustments to de­
veloping environments or dilemmas. By
no manner of means would it be peculiar
to find such a personage as the original
naval commander pursuing a 5-Life-Path.
He was a physical leader-actionist in his
private soul expressions, functioning on
pioneetng manner which describes the
temperament that would drive the Hon-
hotnme Richard right up under the Brit­
ish guns and when asked if he had struck
his colors, retort, "I haven’t yet begun to
fight!” Withal, however, there would be
spiritual travail in his career as a whole,
with resultant spiritual increment, and the
summary based on a life-pattern of con­
stant change and adaptation to circum­
stance.
John Paul Jones, in fact, in every as­
pect of his numerology, ran strictly ac­
cording to Hoyle—as he would, Numer­
ology being an exact science.
Now let’s take such a woman charac­
ter, as, say, Florence Nightingale, the
great Crimean War nurse and founder
of the International Red Cross. Let’s see
how Numerology stacks up in giving us
her significances—
CHAPTER V
1’RE going to do a long
series o£ celebrities now,
in the Numerological
manner, to see how their
mathematical charts work
out. As we go along down
the list, the various features and factors
in Numerology can be expounded as com­
plexities arise in what we confront. As
per the suggestion in our last chapter,
suppose we take up the Numerology of
Florence Nightingale, the celebrated Cri­
mean War nurse, born in Embley Park,
Hampshire Derbyshire, on May 15, 1820.
First we wish to secure Florence’s "inner
and outer” expressions. So we write her
name, giving each letter its inner or outer
significance, as follows—
6 5 5
FLORENCE
63 9* 53
28
9 9 1 5
N I G H TING A L E
5 7 8 2 5 7 3
The Inner Expression of the name
Florence adds up to 16, which in turn re­
duces to a 7. Nightingale in its vowel let­
ters adds up to 24, which in turn reduces
to a 6. The combination of the two tells
us that Florence in her Inner Expression
was a 13, that in turn reduced to a 4.
The Outer Expression of the name
Florence adds to 26, that reduces to an
8. Nightingale adds up to 37, that re­
solves into a 10 or 1. So the combination
of the two makes her outer expression a 9.
She was a 4 in the development of her
eternal character, that is, the pioneer in
intellectual exploring, the venturer in
method, social engineering, and mechani­
cal application of altruism to the practi­
cal circumstance. That she should reduce
nursing—or have the inclination to re­
duce nursing, to the status of Interna­
tional Red Cross activity is quite in line
29
with what her numbers reveal. Privately—
or to herself in her inner consciousness—
she was the mental engineer, the architect,
the planner in its highest sense.
But her Outer Expression vibrated on
a 9, the highest altruistic number, which
explains the universal love-service she ren­
dered humanity by founding the Inter­
national Red Cross.
NTOW suppose we take up her life-path
* ’ and see what it indicated she was
to do. She was born on May 15, 1820,
as aforesaid. The fifth month, a ’’sixth”
day in that month (1-5) in a two year—
1820 adding up to an 11, which in the
case of years usually reduces to a 2. We
can’t designate a year as a genius num­
ber, else everybody born in such a year
would be an intellectual prodigy, and that
would be nonsense.
Anyhow, Florence came in upon a life­
path of a 13, that in turn reduces to 4—
the same as her Inner Expression. She
was fated to do an engineering or archi-
30
tectural job, to supply the brains in an
"exploration” into altruistic service. Be­
ing a Taurian, insofar as the Celestial
Month of the Celestial Year was con­
cerned—something that doesn’t concern
Numerology so intimately—she would
seek expression for her engineering tal­
ents in what we might call "physical” or
"earthly” pursuits, strictly.
Founding the International Red Cross
stacks up as the perfect instance of what
her Numerological talents indicate . .
ALL RIGHT, suppose we roam the
corridors of history and pick out
another celebrity whose accomplishments
we know. Just to show you how infallibly
Numerology operates, let’s hit on the
subject of Oliver Cromwell, Lord Pro­
tector of England.
Cromwell was born on April 25, 1599.
But his birthday indicates his life-path,
and we can leave that till later. What
do the letters of his name tell us? Let’s
"numerologize” it—
31
6 9 5 6 5
OLIVER CROMWELL
3 4 939 45 33
Very good—the total of the Inner Ex­
pression of the man is 31—which resolves
to that Engineering Four again. The to­
tal of his Outer Expression gives us 43 -
which resolves to a 7. This meant Spir­
itual Turmoil throughout his life, inso­
far as his contacts with his fellows were
concerned. He was "pioneering spiritual­
ly” . . and certainly the life of Cromwell
expresses 'nothing else but” . .
He pioneered in social or intellectual
organization, but outwardly expressed, it
applied to spiritual vicissitude and tur­
moil —which certainly would describe a
man with the karma of Cromwell and his
leading of the "hosts of the Lord” in his
battle for Puritanism . .
He was the Social Engineer, but his
Outer Expression would indicate to the
professional Numcrologist that his engi­
neering would concern the tempestuous
32
applications of Spiritual Experitnenta-
tions
Well, what about his birth-path? . .
ROMWELL was born on April 25,
I
I
1599. That meant he was a Tauri-
an. Being a Taurian, he would seek prac­
tical expression in strictly earthy or ma­
terialistic matters. His whole birth-path
adds up to 17—if we cancel out the 9s,
which after all are of no consequence in
Numerological additions. This indicates
that Oliver would encounter outstanding
"worldly success” in actualizing his In­
ner and Outer Expressions of the 4 and
the 7. In such a case we can add the 4
and the 7 and get 11 in all good con­
science, the "Genius” number. He would
be infallibly successful in actualizing
Spirituality—or Spiritual Explorations—
in the practical application, which would
be perfectly represented by his role as
Lord Protector of the Commonwealth.
A "genius” had come into life to at­
tain to outstanding worldly success, and
33
so his chart would disclose in every par­
ticular.
No matter whom you select, in the
whole roster of history, the indications
are similarly infallible—if you but know
how' to interpret the digits . .
« •
34
CHAPTER VI
ÏT’S pick a series of
names at random, just to
prove the accuracy with
which Numerology works
out. For instance, take
such a well known per­
sonage as Theodore Roosevelt . . every­
one over thirty years of age became ac­
quainted with both his character and
temperament, so checking on them
through Numerological significances
should carry its own conviction.
The one-time Teddy’s name chart
would work out somewhat in the follow­
ing totals—
5 6 6 5
THEODORE
2 8 4 9
6 6 5 5
ROOSEVELT
9 14 3 2
35
The top line of digits, added hori­
zontally, totals 44, which in turn resolves
to an 8. Teddy in his Inner Expression
was therefore an 8, the digit usually
recognized as representing worldly success.
The bottom line of digits, added hori­
zontally, totals 42, that in turn resolves
to a 6. Six is interpreted as being the
number standing for mental leadership
and the highest demonstration of socia­
bility—generally known as the Good Luck
number.
Add these Inner and Outer Expression
numbers together and the result is 14.
This resolves in turn to a 5. And Five
is the dramatic change number. A Five-
Personality is in life to orient himself to
kaleidoscopic alterations in affairs. He
will go from one spectacular issue or cir­
cumstance to another, adapt himself to
each, and "ride the whirlwind” gracefully
and successfully.
Now what about Teddy’s birth-path?

' | 'HE FIRST Roosevelt in public life
was born on October 27, 1858. Oc­
tober is the 10th month; he was born on
a 9-day; the year of his birth adds to
22—a master number in itself, by the
way, but which reduces to 4 for figuring
life-courses. So the total reckoning of
his natal date comes to a 50, which in
turn means 5 . . This casts him addi­
tionally for a career in public life of "rid­
ing the whirlwind”, living the Strenuous
Life veritably.
Notice as well the prevalence of 5s
and 6s in his Inner Expression—dramat­
ic changes on the Good Luck octave.
There are twin 9s and twin 4s in his
Outer Expression, implying leadership in­
clined to the field of mental pioneering.
The professional Numerologist would
look at Roosevelt’s numbers—even though
the name of the personage to whom they
belonged were concealed, and pronounce
at once that here was a dramatic temper­
ament, who must assuredly ride high in
the annals of his time, adapting himself
37
with uncanny facility to whatever crisis
he encountered—and the higher and more
spectacular the role, the better he would
like it . .
NTOW let’s turn to another personage
with whose character all Americans
are sufficiently familiar to decide whether
Numerology checks up . . Abraham
Lincoln. As every schoolchild is aware—
or was, before the coming of UNESCO
—he was born on February 12, 1809.
Well, here’s the chart of his Inner and
Outer Expressions—
111 96
ABRAHAM LINCOLN
29 8 4 3 53 35
The total of the digits representing his
Inner Expression is 18, which in turn—
adding horizontally always to arrive at
the lowest significance—becomes 9. Any­
one with a 9 as Inner Expression evidences
the very highest octave of Spiritual Dem­
onstration and Exercise. The total of
Lincoln’s Outer Expression numbers is
42—which resolves to 6 or the Lucky
Worldly Number. He would, in short,
represent to the trained Numerologist a
character of highest spiritual tenor who
successfully expressed it in his contacts
with the world and society.
Looking at his Life-Path, we find that
February 12, 1809 adds to 23, which re­
solves in turn to a 5. So he follows a
life-plan not unlike Theodore Roosevelt’s.
Dramatic vicissitude, spectacular position,
challenge to constant crisis—fated never
to be able to sit down quietly in life and
live provincially—that was Lincoln’s role,
even ending with a manner of death that
was a 5 in its ultimate.
If a blotter were placed over the name
of this personage and only the numbers
indicated, the accomplished Numerologist
would declare this to be the numerolog-
ical chart of a high spiritual character,
who was to have uniform happy luck in
achieving the objectives of his life, but
that they would be hectic and whirlwind
39
objectives, leaving him small calm or
quietude in the nature of his career.
QO FAR we have called up examples
of Presidents. How about a writer of
feminine eminence like Harriet Beecher
Stowe? She wrote, you’ll recall, Uncle
Tom’s Cabin. Let’s investigate dear old

for drama and the spectacular. In her
Outer Expressions, the three names add
up to 58—which gives 13—which gives
4. In her Outer Expression she was the
mental pioneer, the ideological techni­
cian, the explorer in the intellectual. What
could more accurately describe the au­
thoress of a novel that changed the his­
tory of a continent?
Mrs. Stowe's natal date was June 14,
1811—putting her on a 22 life-path, or

HE PERSONAGE of the
week, is of course, our
new Federal President,
Dwight David Eisenhow­
er, born in Dennison,
Texas, October 14, 1890,
and married to Mamie Geneva Doud on
July 1, 1916. If he were an utter stranger,
turning in off a sidewalk and giving us
the foregoing data, what might we de­
duce from it as to his Inner and Outer
Attitudes toward life, as well as his life­
path, in their significances? Well, let’s
have his chart—

1 hs Inner” expression, registered by
the vowels in his lull name, adds to 49,
which in turn resolves to the lowest digit
4. His "Outer” expression, registered
by his consonants, adds to 66, which in
turn resolves to a 12, which resolves to
a 3.
The Inner and Outer expressions, add­
ed, make him a Seven person who got
himself launched into life on a 6 life«
At 26 years of age he embarked on
a 7 marriage.
There are six 5s in his full name, top­
ping any other numbers. There are four
9s.
There’s the man. The other numbers
in his name are minor.
What do we read in the foregoing
significances?
E READ that he possesses a strong
individualistic mind along intel­
lectual lines, that he is subconsciously the
engineer in approaching practical prob-
44
letns. His bump of initiative and intel­
lectual self-reliance is well developed. He
is without inhibition in exploring mech­
anistically—as an astute army commander
would be. There is very little of the
emotional in his temperament, at least it
rarely sways him in making decisions.
In his contacts with the world and his
fellows he is affable, tactful, and accom­
plished. He is easy in his social adjust­
ments, likes people for their own sakes,
but gets along best with them in crowds.
He is, however, primarily the ¡Actionist.j
His idea of accomplishment is movement.
He would not be a person given to
lengthy introspection. Thrusting his
knees beneath a desk and keeping them
there as an occupation could become a
sort of punishment.
Because of the numerical computation
of his name, he can be capable of hard
determinations and fiery outbursts when
aroused, but will always be amenable to
superior authority.
But viewed as the complete personage,
45
geared to the over-all figure 7, especially
with the predominant number of 5s in
both expressions, he has slated himself
for changes of a drastic nature in his
career that bring him no little heartburn
and even spiritual suffering.
His office as President of the United
States does not promise a happy and
peaceful tenure, under any circumstances.
He will encounter one crisis after an­
other, and is due for experiences and re­
lationships that will gash him deeply and
hurtfully, but leave him with a deeper
understanding of life and the spiritual
values of life than a person whose num­
erals run more in harmony.
There is little or no harmony in Dwight
David Eisenhower’s spiritual composition.
He is in for some hard bumps, and only
as he cultivates the philosophic attitude
toward them will they profit him.
His temperament, however, bespeaking
the cosmic progress he has achieved to
the moment, will be somewhat mitigated
by his lucky life-path..
46
He is on a life-path of uniform good
fortune—some of it undeserved in respect
to anything he has done in this life to
merit it.
This Happy Six on which his career
runs, will bring him out uniformly suc-
is the number of intellectual liaison with
society at large, uniformly making for
ascendency over the rank and file. Nu-
merologically we might put it that Dwight
D. Eisenhower is a man experiencing life
to profit from spiritual difficulties, but
born and maturing under a lucky star.
Good fortune falls to him as a matter
of course. He does not always appre­
ciate how favored he is, from having
embarked upon life on this 6 vibration.
When he married, he entered a part­
nership on a 7 vibration—which again
meant encountering spiritual adventures
and vicissitudes for the sake of the prof­
it in the experiencing of them.
47
y^l die whole chart up and
viewing it dispassionately, whether
it apply to the new Chief Executive of
the United States or the man who just
brought the milk—or better still who
wants that job in the shipping room—
the conclusion could be drawn that here
is a person whose head will rule him
more than his heart, who has a very
sparse tendency of temperament toward
the artistic or emotional, who probably
never would write a poem to a sunset,
but who would make a personal hit on
a camping trip, in a barracks, or at a
sales convention. He will be a hard per-
son to get ’’close to,” and while he feels
deeply in an actionist way, and at times
can be fanatical in respect to principle,
is at all times weighing men and situa­
tions strictly with his intellect.
Would he make a good milk man or
shipping clerk?
No, because he’d be experimenting too
much on easier ways for delivery of milk
or tying up of bundles.
Better let him have the job of heading
the firm. He’ll do that anyway, eventu­
ally, if he stays long enough.
That’s the Six in his life-path.

CHAPTER VIII
HE PURPOSE of these
papers has been, not to
make professional sooth­
sayers or fortune tellers
out of Soulcraft’s readers,
but to supply a simple
and easy technique for gaining to the
complete character-summary of the per­
son whose christened name and correct
birth-date is supplied us. Numbers of
queries have come in, since this series
started, asking what the procedure is
when a person has not been "officially”
named—that is, when there has been no
formal christening to determine the name­
designation. The answer to that is rela­
tively simple . . The name appearing on
the doctor’s birth certificate has un­
doubtedly identified the small human be­
ing who has started this earthly travail,
50
and if that can be determined, the formal
religious rites can be ignored.
Familiarize yourself with the signifi­
cances of the various numbers and you
have a Key to Character put in your
hands on any person who confronts you,
providing he truthfully confides to you
his birth-name and birth-date. You will
discover from practice that the results are
infallible . .
AV7ORDS themselves vibrate to defi-
’’ nite significances, we find. Take
the word STOP! as an instance. It fig­
ures out to a Seven. Seven is the num­
ber of negative turmoil, frustration, spir­
itual inhibition and durance. On the
other hand, the word START! figures to
a Six. Six is the "lucky” number. It is the
best number in the whole roster of Nine
numbers. It holds adventure, intrepidity,
rich experience in its essence. It opens
the door on good fortune and profit.
There is an excellent example of prof­
itable Numerology in the figuring out of,
51
say, the United States of America as ex­
ample. Look at the significances in this
numerological setup—
3 9 5 1 5
UNITED STATES
5 2 4 1 2 2 1
The Inner Expression figures out to a
23—which resolves to a 5 . . the num­
ber of dramatic vicissitude, change, res-
tivity, action! Its Outer Expression adds
to an 8—the "worldly success” number,
particularly in wealth. Whoever has an
Outer Expression totaling an 8, has "the
world by the tail and a downhill pull”
in respect to materialistic and financial
dominance. And yet, 8 and 5 total 13—
which in turn resolves to a 4. And this
means Intellectual Leadership, Inventive
Skill, Mechanistic Pioneering. As for
the word AMERICA, what a rich mine
of revelations lies in its Numerology . .
T ET US look at it—the
tea of itself is fateful.

The "chart”
of the name works out as follows—

AMERICA

I he Inner Expression of the Ameri­
can Soul, or the Great Soul of our na­
tion considered as an entity, totals to a 7
—which means turmoil, frustration, spir­
itual inhibition and durance, . . spirit­
ual experiences for the sake of the ex­
panded consciousness they give. The
Outer Expression totals to a 16, which
again resolves to a 7. But the two ex­
pressions, inner and outer, give us 14,
that in turn give us the resolved fig­
ure 5.
The Numerological essence of America
is Change—Drama, Alteration for altera­
tion’s sake, vicissitude holding spiritual
enhancement. No one could be a true
American and remain a provincial, a
stick-in-the-mud, a reactionary. The very
Numerology of his country will not per­
mit it.
Or take George Washington, "Father”
of this Volatile Republic. Let’s look at
53
his Numerology with the idea of trans­
lating his name and birth-path signifi­
cances into estimates of character . .

Washington’s Inner Expression was
the total of 32 . . that resolved into
that fateful 5, the great "change” or dra­
matic number that distinguished the Con­
tinental Fathers almost universally. His
Outer Expression totaled to 56, which
might be considered the Genius Number
of 11, in outer contacts—which decidedly
was correct in his life as we have had
it reported to us—but which in total ad­
ditions has the Father of his Country
coming into the worldly tenure on the 7
vibration . . frustration, turmoil, and
spiritual increment to the nth degree.
54
And wasn’t that the career of the man
from first to last?
ASHINGTON was born February
’’ 22, 1732—putting him on a One
life-path, the path of self-reliant indi­
vidualism. He was indeed the Pioneer
and self-sufficient venturer, first as a sur­
veyor in youth of the Virginian wilder­
ness, later the lonely and dominant fig­
ure at the head of a war that seemed
hopeless of success. Nobody could "get
close” to him spiritually, he had no con­
fidants or spiritual cronies. Though the
center of society and civic activity, he
was temperamentally the Isolationist—
austere, aloof, restrained, pursuing his
solo way without bids for the sympathy
or acclaim of his fellows.
What a fateful Karma, a man with a
5 Inner Expression, on an 11 Genius
world performance but the life-path of
the explorer and pioneer! Small wonder
he never displayed any of Abe Lincoln’s
humor or unbent himself "to be one with
*
the boys”. With that Numerology he
prevented.
Do you get the general idea?
Then our series comes to a close
was
CHAPTER IX
UMMING up the whole
system of Practical Num­
erology, what we really
get from it are reasonably
reliable cues as to what
we had attained spiritual­
ly, a sum-total of all earlier lives and ex­
periences as we had represented them
at attaining to our birth in the current
era; and, the Vibration on which we
launched ourselves by being born on a
given date, that new experiences of a defi­
nite character might accrue to us. The
first is indicated by the combined Chris­
tian name and surname which our par­
ents bestowed on us. The second is indi­
cated by the sum-total of the digits of
our birthdate this last, or current time.
Your name figures to given sum as to
vowels and consonants. The sum-total of
all the vowels indicates your Inner Ex-
pression, what you are in your character
according to spiritual promptings. The
sum-total of all consonants indicates your
Outer Expression, or what you are in
your character according to its demonstra­
tion to the world. Adding them, you
may get a general idea of the peculiar
character you represent in Cosmos. But
your Life-Path as indicated by the total
of your birth-date digits, discloses more
or less the general nature of the brevet
on which you last came into flesh, . .
meaning this present incursion. Let’s run
the Name Designations through anew,
in order to be certain you’ve got them—
One, . . if your combined Inner and
Outer expression figures to a One, you
have been more or less of an independent
and solo character up to the present, un­
accountably self-reliant in your manifest­
ings, inclined to go it self-assertively, and
relying more or less on your own initia­
tive. Your past earthly experiences up
across multiple lives, have taught you to
paddle your own canoe, not lean over-
58
much on others, venture as it pleased you
and abide personally by the result. Ex­
ploring enigmas, and pioneering in spirit­
ual equations, is your second nature, so
to speak. That is your record to the mo­
ment. Mayhap the new Life-Path you
have chosen for this excursion has been
meant to alter or mitigate such indepen­
dence. But at least the Numerologist
looks at a One Person as an individual
who goes his own way, sink or swim, sur­
vive or perish, relying on his own capabili­
ties and accepting the effect for what it
may be. What his current Life-Path is
going to do to him, is another matter.
Two, . . if your combined Inner and
Outer name-expressions figure to a Two,
yon have uniformly perfected yourself in
working harmoniously and most profitably
with a partner, or in tandem with some­
one. In nine cases out of ten this "some­
one” is an affinity of the opposite sex, but
it can also be a business partner or spir­
itual associate. You have been outstand­
ingly successful in past lives by working
59
in conjunction with a partner—some
might call it a Foil—and will feel most
at home pursuing a given commission
when you have a colleague, connubial or
otherwise, through whom and with whom
to operate.
Three, . . if your Inner and Outer ex­
pressions add to a Three, it indicates that
up to the moment of your latest earthly
birth you perfected yourself most adroitly
in operating with Groups, in some sort of
practical relation to the public. You have
always been what is called a Physical Ac-
tionist, hovering close to the materialistic,
getting your expressions in physical per­
formings, even of the most dramatic or­
ganic character, and never being whollv
happy unless you are in some sort of
worldly movement. You have been best
at home with men and women in the ab­
stract, are rarely at a loss for poise when
confronting groups or crowds, are socially
inclined, and given to small embarrass­
ment when projected into any limelight.
You are a product of the slightest at-
60
tainments on the Physical octave. What
you do with this complacency of your spir­
it in respect to meeting and getting along
with others, is strictly a matter of taking
cues from your current Birth-Path.
Four, . . if your name adds up to a
Four, it indicates that the sum-total of
your spiritual living prior to your current
incarnation has inclined you to the experi­
mental, the intellectual, the inventive.
You have perfected yourself in relying
on your intellectual endowments, and
Mind takes precedence with you in mak­
ing any manner of decision. The profes­
sional Numerologist would pronounce
that you are at your best when permitted
to rely on your mental capabilities and
make all your decisions from the stand­
point of Rationality.
Five, . . the Mental octave translates
the Two of the Physical Octave—partner-
shio of some kind—into a classification of
£
Change for its own sake, or being thrown
into new situations merely for the pur-
pose of handling yourself adroitly under
61
new conditions which they call up. Peo­
ple whose name indicates they have hither­
to been Fives are uniformly perceived to
be social adjusters, diplomats, soldiers of
fortune who are never bothered by where
nightfall finds them, easy adapters to cir­
cumstance. They have perfected them­
selves in past lives in conforming to what­
ever social or economic situation has con­
fronted them. They love Change, in con­
sequence, for its own sake. It fits in with
what they have mastered in lives bygone.
Six, . on the other hand, connotes peo­
ple whose names are indicative of ac­
cepted worldly success as a condition, who
have whipped unhappy circumstance in
careers bygone and probably made great
prestige for themselves by doing so. They
are leaders, diplomats, financiers, fina-
glers, on principle in gaining their ends,
accustomed to besting their fellows in any
particular pursuits and generally heading
up society or movements as natural leaders
and arbiters. If your name figures to a
Six, you had best take a new and im-
62
proved estimate of yourself because it
indicates that in past lives you have been
overwhelmingly successful in whatever
you have attempted and there is no par­
ticular reason why you should not con­
tinue along with such a program. How­
ever, your birth-path may express how
you should bend or adapt this trend.
Seven, . . indicates that you have been
a Spiritual Explorer to the moment, and
pioneered in examinations of alleged
"holy” doctrine to determine its rational­
ity. If Seven represents your name-num­
ber, you have probably come into earth­
life with a natural distaste of theologic
traditions and an inclination to ferret out
Truth for yourself. Naturally, any such
restlessness in regard to prevailing reli­
gious tenets doesn’t make for much hap­
piness or contentment of deeper intellect.
If you are a Seven, you are instinctively
a malcontent, a student, a searcher! Ac­
cept yourself as such, explore and sample
to your heart’s content, but consult your
life-path to get your cue as to w’hat par-
ticular lines to follow. You have com­
pleted the first step in the Spiritual Cycle.
If you are called to go on into an Eight
Expression in your new life-experience, it
means you are making excellent progress
spiritually and should tackle your new
assignment with zest.
Eight, . . represents this new assign­
ment. Strange to say, it usually translates
out into relationships with large numbers
of men and economic resource. It seems
as though you want to apply your person­
al solo experiencings of your Seven tute­
lage to the human crowd in general. So
we find you able to head up industrial,
political, or financial institutions, fore­
man or superintendent of your daily em­
ployments—or you should be!—and gen­
erally a leader where and when your solo
attainments of Seven can have public ap­
plication. We find more tycoons and cap­
tains of industry incarnated under Life-
Paths of Eight than under any other
number. "Treating with the public as a
mass” is a good description of you at
64
vour best. Which brings us to the in­
triguing and mystical number Nine.
Nine, . . Nine are ''the numbers of the
Sons of God,’’ the Holy Book informs
us. What this, translated, seems to imply
is that Number Nines are uniformly at
their best when they find themselves in
situations where they can Teach, Instruct,
Enlighten, or Inspire. And this last is
most significant of the rest. People whose
names add up to Nine can generally ac­
cept that they are very old and venerable
souls, who have trodden the earthly trek
uncountable times before. Tens of mil­
lions of them are back in mortality, not
because they require it in further educa­
tion or training of their own selves but
because they desire subconsciously to aid
their fellowmen to fullest Enlightenment.
You find them filling earth-roles as poets,
painters, social and religious leaders of
the finest talents and effectivities. They
have, so to speak, long since arrived at
the apex of the spiritual scale and are
capable of turning about and imparting
what they have acquired, to others.
Eleven, . . that leaves only two other
combinations or significances o£ numer-
ological figures which need to concern us.
One is Eleven and the other is Twenty-
two. Both are accredited with being
master-numbers.” But what is a 'master’
number? It means a number describing
a soul who has been so outstanding in
his physical or spiritual pursuits that few
earthly beings are able to impart much
more erudition to him. He really knows
practically all that earthly instruction has
to give him, and for the Return Incursion
is engaged in proving it.
Because he—or she—is so adept at
meeting the obstructions or complications
of life, is such a master or mistress of
the earthly circumstance so to speak, we
uniformly find him or her whose name
adds up to an Eleven being well nigh a
genius at performing earthly duties or
tasks with dispatch, celerity, and skill.
Whatever they are confronted with, they
do easily and without much fuss or
66
pother. It "comes natural” to them, as
the expression has it . . The Eleven num­
ber is known as the Genius designation
in consequence.
Twenty-two, . . is supposed to con­
vey pretty much the same talents and
natural capabilities only instead of being
demonstrable in the physical or material­
istic, they display in the spiritual phases
and facets of life. Persons whose chris­
tened names and surnames taken together
figure to a Twenty-two are usually indi­
viduals in their esoteric graspings. They
"know” almost as by intuition what >s
Truth and what is falsehood. They are
"masters” of the Cosmic Fundamentals.
In other words, they are geniuses in the
higher moral or philosophic postulates.
Knowing what is psychically correct is a
sort of mystical sixth sense with them.
Often they are outstandingly mediumistic
in their own rights. They are very, very
old souls, engaged in the current earthly
sojourn for some particular purpose, even
though it isn’t outstanding at the
67
mo-
ment. Time is due to score for them.
Before they quit the current sojourn they
may perform feats of mystical legerde­
main so outstanding as to leave no doubt
about their adept cosmic backgrounds . .
r PHESE foregoing recapitulations being
A what they are, we have only to ap­
ply them to the Life-Paths to get our cues
as to why any given person is in life. The
significances are forever constant. Wheth­
er we shall say they apply to what is be­
hind one in earlier careers, or to the earth­
ly incarnation that is not yet terminated,
is entirely a matter of trying to deter­
mine where one sits on the cosmic stair­
way at the current moment!
The sum-total of the name designations
indicates what is behind one. The sum­
total of the Life-Path designations indi­
cates what is ahead of one. We can
leave it with that pronouncement. Which
ate you seeking to know?

WORD before closing,
about the Pythagorean
Cycle . .
Five or six centuries be­
fore Christ a Greek
mathematician on the Isle
of Crotona discovered a disconcerting
but enlightening thing. He discovered
that happenings in human affairs appear
to come in cycles and that such cycles
run nine years apart. But he discovered
more. He discovered there are ways of
determining in what years of the average
human life these cycles begin and end,
thus disclosing the "good” or "bad” years
in the normal person’s career..
It is based on the computation of the
Life Path.
The Cycle is not difficult to set up.
Take a large teacup and place it rim­
down on a sheet of paper. Draw a cir-
69
cumference line with a pencil around it.
Then take this large circle you have drawn
and with a ruler or straightedge, divide
it of! into eight segments, as though you
were drawing a diagram for the cutting
of eight wedges of a pie. Start at the
top right-hand segment and number it
One. Go thus around the various seg­
ments. clock-fashion, only when you come
to the eighth, give it an additional Nine
number in the empty top corner where
the circumference and diameter lines join.
You should have nine numbers spaced
around the circumference of the circle.
with the segments at the bottom.
Now, start at the number representing
the total addition of your Life-Path and
put down the year you were born. Then
proceed counter clockwise to set down
rec
succeeding years chronologically, right up
to the present. 11 your notations are cor-
rectly made, as you put down these suc­
cessive years around the outer edge ol
the big penciled circle they will tall in
groups nine years apart. When vou have
brought the notation of the years up to
the present, you can look upon all the
years above the central horizontal line—
or the equatorial line—as indicating the
"good” years in your life, and all the
years noted below the equatorial line as
the "bad” or less fortunate years. In
other words, viewing it that the years
above the equatorial horizon, or "above-
ground”, are your good years, and all
those below it are your under-ground
years, the years at the very bottom being
the darkest or least fortunate.of all.
Thus as you put down years not yet
lived, you have presented to you a chart
of what the fortunate and unfortunate
are to be, and thus to a limited degree
you can tell your "fortune” in a general
aspect. You are either above or below the
horizon.
In other words, every nine years you
have approximately the same type of for­
tune you enjoyed nine years before, and
if you will check back upon the years
already lived you will discover how true
71
Numerology runs to the happenings of
your life. Generally speaking, and for
nine persons out of ten, those years which
have held financial losses, poor health,
hospital operations, or deaths of friends
or loved ones, will fall at the pie-seg­
ments below the equatorial line. Those
years which have held good fortune for
you, happy marital or romantic adven­
tures, prosperous financial returns, suc­
cess in your career or job, will uniformly
be the segments above ground” or near
the top of the circle . .
This does not mean necessarily that
if you have had a serious hospital opera­
tion in 1947, you are due to have a worse
one in 1958. It indicates the general for
tunes of your life repeating themselves
in cycles of nine years apart, good, bad
or indifferent.
What the secret of the cycles is, no
one has yet explained, not even Pytha­
goras himself. However, Chapter 85 of
the celebrated Golden Scripts does afford
us considerable enlightenment on the sig­
nificances of Numbers or Digits that be­
long in this little volume before closing,
and which may well be taken well to
heart . .
CHAPTER XI
OW 1 teach you of num­
bers, for that is the pro-
foundest study in all cre­
ation; I tell you of the
significance of numbers
in the Cosmos:
Ye have heard it said that Numbers are
digits expressing quantities in terms: 1
say that is wrong.
Numbers express not quantities but
values.
Numbers have a mission unto men, giv­
ing them portraits of valuations;
Numbers have a mission unto men, giv­
ing them mental pictures of that which
they value;
But Numbers do more than this: they
give expressions of quantities to men and
in addition the values thereof, one in re­
lation to the other.
74
Numbers do still more than this: they
typify existence. They have no bearing
otherwise.
Six is a number unto itself even when
not attached to objects; numbers have
quantities therefore in themselves, expres­
sively.
All accrueth to this: Men employ num­
bers to express quantities, and values,
and abstractions of concepts where quan­
tities are involved, but the practice of
considering numbers as cosmic values is
not yet recognized. . .
When man first came to earth he had
knowledge of himself as One; he had
knowledge of his neighbor, which made
Two; he had knowledge of many neigh­
bors which made many numbers;
But of those neighbors whom he saw not,
he had no knowledge, yet they did exist
in Thought and verily manifested.
Man said unto himself: Lo, there are
many of us: how distinguish we ourselves
one from the other, seen or unseen? let
us ¿0 so by a sign, numbering ourselves;
75
came we to earth nameless, but in num­
bers not countable by human brain.
Man did designate himself, therefore, ac­
cording to his projections across cosmic
space, counting himself fortunate to be
known at all.
Names are numbers signifying classes;
they are not chosen by whim of parent
but given to men in classes, signifying
their states of cosmic development . .
Every name hath its number, or rather,
every number or set of numbers, hath its
name;
Persons of similar names have similar
numbering, though not the reverse.
Consider this, therefore: man did come
to earth nameless, being created by Di­
vine Thought for purposes of admin­
istration; that is his place in the Cosmos,
naught else.
Man is cosmic administrator, in school to
learn administration.
We who did come to earth first and
therefore have lived the longer, did sig­
nify ourselves by groups: each group
76
comprised its number o£ souls, the time
of their advent being the mark of their
cosmic identity.
Words and phrases expressing numbers
crept into every language, undergoing
form-to-form translation as tongue suc­
ceeded tongue; tongues gave meaning to
numbers or groups, but these meanings
were lost in age on age, making deriva­
tions.
Numbers have a mission therefore, that
is different from symbols of evaluation,
or significance of quanties: they are ex­
pressive of group ratings when symbols
apply to the race as a whole.
Ye have heard that it hath been said
that seven thousand souls did reach earth
first; for seven thousand years did those
seven thousand manifest ere others came
to earth in leagues of seven thousand
more.
The first did multiply in physical form
which they took upon themselves, but
these seven thousand were not beasts as
77
ye know beasts, they were human mani­
festing in physical form of beasts.
Beasts have no insight into spiritual val­
ues, but man, being the essence of spir­
itual value, did know himself as separate
from beasts.
He said unto his brother, We do recog­
nize ourselves, being that which is called
Man, but behold we are naked in spirit;
shall we not therefore clothe ourselves
with physical form even as beasts?
Whereupon entered Woman as a sex in­
to the cosmic scheme . .
Woman originally was not different from
man, for verily men are women constant­
ly, and women are men, as it pleaseth the
half of the soul to exercise;
But the bodies of women were different
physically for reproduction.
The first seven thousand therefore did
take unto themselves physical form by
need of manifesting, and did evolve
Woman as such to speed the process
called physical creation; the work of
propagation was divided, each manifest­
ing in its function.
The first seven thousand dying and be­
ing reborn over and over, were the root
parents of the race, going in and out of
flesh at their whim.
Now those bodies were but transient,
therefore is sex but transient, but spirit
is immortal; therefore when a second
seven thousand did come to the earth
plane, verily was there confusion of a
sort, for the second resembled the first
in spiritual aspect, though the first were
the older in creation by seven times.
Therefore did the first group of seven
name themselves First Seven; therefore
did those who came after name them­
selves Second Seven; those who did come
after named themselves Third Seven, and
so through untold millions.
Therefore have we the various numbers
in every language, but each representing
a class of Seven, and Seven Thousand,
and where they belong in the order of
their coming.
79
The march o£ events hath taken each
far; peoples have succeeded peoples and
tongues aligned with tongues; but riveted
in each man’s consciousness hath been
the order of his coming . .
Know ye, my beloved, that those among
you who serve me belong to the group
that came to earth first, so long ago that
the mind of species cannot encompass it.
Know that ye have birthed and rebirthed
countlessly until necessity for birth and
rebirth hath long since disappeared.
Know that ye have become of the host,
administrators, verily risen to your stat­
ure; know that ye didst say unto your­
selves: Lo, the earth is beautiful in that
we live upon it, or in it.
Ye have said to yourselves, We have
made earth beautiful in times that are
passed, but that is not enough: those who
have followed us have need of our coun­
sel.
Whereupon ye didst elect to remain with
earth and make it beautiful for those
who followed, millennium on millennium.
80
Seven is the 'mystic number’ of all cre­
ation, in that Seven hath the power of
creating; Seven hath the power of creat­
ing because it hath in it seven gradations
of Etheric Status, making in manifesta­
tion for substance in matter.
When, however, we come unto man as
spirit a different proposal confronteth us.
Man is not Matter; he is finer than Mat­
ter; he transcendeth Matter even though
he occupy it and perceive it.
He saith to the Godhead out of which
he came, Seven may be the ingredients /
of Ether making Matter, but unto these
were added Love and Patience, making
Spirit;
These made Nine; therefore is man ex­
pressed in the Cosmos by nine.
Have I not told you that Nine is the
number of the sons of God?
Nine is the symbol for Created Mortal.
Fire and water are made of the same in­
gredients as Man, requiring Love and
Patience to bring them into being; there-
81
fore is Nine likewise symbol of Fire and
Water.
All things have symbol in some form.
Man said unto the Godhead, Let there
be light visible that I may know this
earth in which I dwell; light came, of
addition of cosmic intelligence to cosmic
matter, making Ether to know itself.
Light as seen by eye is property of Ether
when acted upon by Love; light as seen
by Soul is substance of creation; light
hath no properties of itself, it is merely
a condition.
Light is not fire, though fire is light.
Light is the eternal beneficence in action
and taketh many forms.
Fire is Ether having substance; water is
Ether having other substance; fire and
warer are both substance of Ether.
Fire came first, water followed; fire was
powerful, water was more powerful, hav­
ing more properties of Ether than fire;
therefore doth water vanquish fire, having
greater substance.
For a time man did exist having no
82
names, I say, but numbers; Seven was
his number;
But those who came into flesh of first
order were those who did not pervert
themselves by liaisons with beasts; these
were the unblemished; they also had
numbers according to their quantity; they
also designated themselves out from those
who went otherwise in practices.
Now, my beloved, I tell you more: those
who went otherwise in practices did not
pervert to similar extent; some reclaimed
themselves at once, in their first lives;
they too were of a quantity, having names
expressing, that quantity.
Down many lives in flesh did many abom­
inate ever more grossly, so that the num­
bers thereof did each become a signifi­
cant designation.
When therefore ye study the Science of
Numbers, bear these facts in mind.
Men everywhere have names; they may
not always bear the same names, life on
life, but always they bear names having
as their essence the number of an order,
83
or division of an order; to these names
they respond in that they remember them
subconsciously.
Let us take a case in point: mayhap a
certain man cometh to earth to reincar­
nate for personal experience; he hath vi­
sions of his order over many lives;
He saith unto himself, I belong to this
or that division of the race: I have come
to earth many times, manifesting in dif­
ferent racial stocks, I have had visions
of myself in many places but always hath
my name represented mine order; what
therefore is my name according to the
stock I now proceed to inhabit?
Verily doth he choose that name and it
is given him.
Parents’ wishes enter not into it, con­
trary to acceptance; parents do but obey
the promptings of the voices speaking to
them from behind the veil;
Mothers do but know that they carry
their young: lo the young are but animal
bodies having neither form nor substance
of soul;
84
These bodies grow; behold the forces
elect the souls to go into them, and spirit
becometh flesh; when the soul hath gone
in, lo do names occur unto such parents
to call the young;
Invariably they are whispered secretly
unto the parents, whereupon the parents
"choose” them . .
But ever is it true that the name desig-
nateth the order of the soul.
Numbers, or names, are but credit marks
disclosing the soul’s progress to date;
verily there are other factors representa­
tive of that progress having in them the
soul’s relation to the Cosmos.
Deep, deep is the subject; I tell you this
hour that souls have come to earth in
marches of seven thousand, to live seven
thousand years ere more were added; that
out of such advent have come the
races of mankind as ye do know them.
Therefore I say unto you, your brother
who is weak hath come to earth belated:
mayhap he hath not had your brevet of
experience;
85
Pardon him that this is so; know his
handicaps; perceive, his blind gropings;
give yourselves cognizance that once were
ye, as ye do see him now, and was not
guidance given you?
If others, so be it, have given you their
guidance, can ye not turn about and pay
the debt in circumstance?
I tell ye that ye do err when ye do say,
He is a stupid one, let him hunger by
himself until food maketh presentation
unto his wantings.
All have suffered, all have hungered, all
have groped, all have stumbled; it is the
order of experience that such things be
of moment unto those who sense, and by
their sensings know whereof they are.
These matters are discussed with those
who have ears to hear, that they may see
their brothers’ gropings and know where­
of the stupid ones are stupid;
I enlighten, I strengthen, I do not bedull.
