 The journal in its final incarnation advertised itself as "The Oldest English New Thought Magazine."  It proclaimed that it was an "exponent of Practical Idealism.  Its aims are to bring to every reader perfect and permanent health, mental expansion, without which there can be no true growth; success in whatever is attempted, and as a necessary consequence, happiness.  In fine, it contends that the object of life is to be happy ; that the place to be happy is HERE ; the time to be happy is NOW; and the way to be happy is by making others happy. The New Thought Journal is not the organ of any school of thought, holding up the best in all lines of thought for emulation."  The last phrase  properly indicates that the journal was primarily composed of selections from other, mainly American New Thought authors like Harry Gaze, Helen Wilmans, Eleanor Kirk, and Prentice Mulford, with articles by Bratley on astrology and by Eaves on the color cure, "Thought the Builder," etc.  Bratley was primarily an astrologer (author of Lunar Tables and Guide (1917) and Bratley's Daily Guide (1920-1921)), and author of The Art of Fascination, A Popular Exposition of the Sun's Etheric Force, which, When Transmuted, is Personal Magnetism (Talisman Pocket Library, no. 1, 1903), who easily made the transition to Practical Idealism. A. (Albert) Osborne Eaves was a proponent of fonetic spelling and esperantist and a practitioner of palmistry who became an enterprising mage in the American pattern.  He started Talisman Publishing Company in Harrogate to sell shilling booklets on the prevalence and dangers of vampires, together with typical New Thought offerings like "The Dominant Mentality," "The Color Cure" (red accelerates the nervous system and blue relaxes it),  "How to Reach the Cosmic Mind," "First Steps in New Thought," "The Inner Path to Success," "Your Powers and How to Use Them," "Thought the Builder," "The Mastery of Death," etc., etc.  Many of Eaves's books, in turn, were translated into German by Harry Bondegger and republished in the Talisman-Bucherei series in Germany, at least one with appendixes of texts by W.W. Atkinson.  He was also the distributor in England for Parzival Braun's The Mastery of Fate, and may have been, as Moller and Howe opine, the author of one of the works that Theodor Reuss listed in his "Bausteine zum O.T.O.-Tempel" in 1914.  Eaves, in typical New Thought mage fashion offered in conjunction with this journal a "Success Circle" (with definite times set aside daily for members to think together on the desired New Thought goals), and a "Talisman League" and "Correspondence Club," as well as various talismans and a "Hypnotic and Mesmeric Course" and "Home Course of Lessons in Mental Science."
