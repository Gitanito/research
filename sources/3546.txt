In the Year 1802 ,
Calculated from New_and Improved Aſtronomical
TABLES ,
Founded on the Newtonian Syſtem of Gravitation ,
THE
HE two great Lamps of Heaven will this Year af
ford four Eclipſes, namely , each Luminary two :
Theſe will happen in the following Order :
The firft will be an Eclipſe of the Sun, on Thurſday,
Marcb che 4th , at 55 Min . paſt our 4 in the Morning ;
conſequently in vigble to us, it happening ſo long before
the Sun riſing ; but that is not all, for had it happened
at Noon -day, it had ftill been inviſible, not to us only ,
but to all Europe; and in ſhort it is inviſible so all the
Northern Paris of the Globe : But in thoſe Paris more
Southerly this will be a very great Eclipſe ; for in the
unknown Parts of the Globe, 114 Degrees 7 Minutes
Eaſt from London , in 58 Degrees 20 Minutes South Lati .
tude, if there be any Inhabitants, they will be ſurpriſed
with a total and central Eclipſe, preciſely at their Noon
Day :
The ſecond of theſe Eclipſes, is a ſmall one of the
Moon , and inviſible, upon Friday the 19th of March .
The Middle of this Eclipſe, with reſpec to London, our
Metropolis, happens 54 Minutes before 12 at Noon ; at
which Time the Moon will be vertical ro that Part of the
great Ocean lying under 8 Minutes of North Latitude,
166 Degrees 46 Minutes of Longitude, Weft from Lon

The third Eclipſe, is another folar Defect, on Saturday
the 28th of Auguſt, and if Clouds interpofe not, will in
Pari be viſible here ; and only in Pars, for the sun will
riſe eclipſed -At London the sun riſes that Morning at
5 Minutes paſt five o'Clock , and the Middle of the Eclipſe
will be at 19 Mioutes after five, when the Sun will appear
near 5 Digits eclipſed ; and the Moon quits the Sun's Din ,

Upon Tueſday the gth of November, in the Morning,
there happens a Tranſit of the Planet Mercury over the
Sun's Dik, moſt of which will be viſible here , if Clouds
ſhould not intervene. - It begins before Sun rife , and is the
only one sve ſhall have for ſome Years. Theſe Tranfits
are ofthe utmoſt Insportance to Aftronomy, as they afford
the Means of improving the Theory and Tables of that
Planet. Mercury has at all Times afforded much Occupa
tion to Aſtronomers, becauſe to obſerve that Planet is a
Matter of conſiderable Difficulty. The great Coper
NICUS died without ever having ſeen it, and therefore
could believe only in its Exiſtence. The firſt who ever
ſaw the Tranſit of Mercury over the Sun was PETER
GASSENDUS , Dean of the Cathedral Church of Digne in
Provence, and Regius Profeſſor of Mthematics in the
Univerſiçy of Paris, and that was on the 7th of November
1631. JEREMIAH HORROX, an eminent Engliſh Aftrono
mer , was the firſt that ever ſaw the Planet Venus paſs over
the Sun, and that was in the Year 1639. The Beginning
of this Tranfit will be ſeen Eastward as far as New Zea.

will be ſeen in all Africa , moft Parts of Aſia and Europe ;
the End will extend itſelf Weitward as far as Cape Horn ,
and all South America , and to moſt of the Weſt India
Ilands. It is hoped the Appearance of it in this Kingdom
will not greatly deviate from the following Type and
Calculation. The Delineation is adapted to LONDON ,
and ſhows the Track of Mercury from the Beginning or
Sun riſe to the End, and will tolerably well ſerve for the
whole Kingdom .-- Mercury being ſo very ſmall , fome fort

Three vifible Occultations of JUPITER by the Moon .
This is a remarkable Year for ſeveral viſible Occultacions
of the Planet Jupiter by the Moon, the principal of which is
here
Meteorological Obſervations, &c. 41
here inſerted for the Sake of ſuch curious Perſons as dem
light in contemplating the beautiful Structure and won
derful Harmony of the celeſtial Bodies. The firſt is on
Thurſday the ziſt of January, at Night, when the Moor
will be seen approaching that fine Star for ſome Time be
fore the immerlion takes Place, which is at 2 Min. pait
9 ; the Immerfion will be at 9 Min . pait 10 , when Jupiter
will appear again on the contrary Side, after being ob
ſcured by the Moon 1 Hour and 7 Min .
The ſecond is on Wedneſday the 17th of February , as
Night , when Jupiter will firitappear on the lower Side of
the Moon as it did in the lait Occuliation , and the Immer
fion takes Place at 5 Min. palt 9 ; and Jupiter will come
out from behind the Moon at 14 Min. pait 10 , after being
hid 1 Hour and 9 Minutes.
The third is on Tueſday the 13th of April, in the Morn
ing, when Jupiter will appear on the left side of the
Moon , and the Immerſion happens at 29 Minutes paſt 2
o'Clock ; and Jupiter will come out from behind the opa
porite or right side of the Moon at 24 Min . pait 3 , after
being hid by the Moon 55 Minutes. " Thefe Calculations
are made for tbe Meridian and Latitude of London , and
according to app. Time. Theſe notable Occultations of
Jupiter by the Moon will appear very beautiful through a
good Teleſcope , though they may be ſeen by the naked
Eye ſhould the Air prove favourable.
Note . The two grand fuperior Planets, Jupu er and
SATURN , will ( all the fore - part of this Year) appear very
near togecher, as they did in the laſt Year, and may be
viewed every night with a good Teleſcope when the Air
is clear, through which they will make a fine Appearance ;
Jupiter with his Belts and Satellites, and Saturn with his
wonderful Ring and Satellites.-- Their Conjunction hap
pens july cie ibih, at 7 in the Morning, in 4 Degrees 54
Minutss of Virgo.
METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS , & c .
HE diflinguishing Feature of the Year 1800, was a
hot and dry Summer, for little more than an Inch of
Rain
T
42 MOORE , 1802 .
Rain fell in the fore-part of June ; and from the 22d of
that Monik , there was a continued Drought for more than
eight Weeks, for there was no Rain until early in the
Morning of the 19th of Auguf , when a Thunder Storm
commenced . In all this Period the Mercury in the Baro .
meter was conſtantly very high , namely, 30 Inches, and
ſometimes above ; and by my Journal of the Weather kept
at Royflon , I found is the horteſt July (except that of 17935
for at leaſt ſeventeen Years paft. The coldelt Day in the
Year was the iſt of January, and the hotteſt Day was the
Ilth of Auguft.- All the latter Months were mild , and the
Thermometer never ſo low as the freezing Point
.-- The
Month of September was moiſt and rainy , and yet milder
than the Month of June, which, though dry, was for the
Seaſon a cool Month ... The Month of November was very
rainy , and on the oth Day thereof, abous Noon, the
Wind ſuddenly (after being brikk for nore than 30 Hours )
increaſed to a violent Storm , and continued with in
creaſing Force for an Hour, when its Violence began to
abate (the Quick Glver in the Barometer rifing very faſt)
and in leſs than six Hours there was very little Wind :
Tois Şcorm did much Damage in the Southern Parts of the
Kingdom.--I intend , my friends, this Almanack ( as to
the Weather ) to be clafled with a good Weather Glaſs,
which , to thoſe of my make I give particular Rules, ſo
that by a moderate Attention any one may ſoon under
fland them for a good Barometer would always prove à

Corn and his Hay iin providently, and leave them to ma.

would then , los the sake of ſuch a ſmall Sum of Money,

COURTEOUS Reader, in ſeveral of my preceding
Almanacks you may obſerve that I intimated that the
Spirit of God is now performing great Wonders in all
Nations, in preparatory Order, to bring about the great
Work of Reformation ; and , indeed , the Times of late
have been ſo remarkable , that it ſeems like the Beginning of
the Prophecy of the Prophet Joel,Ch. 2. Ver. 30. - 1 will

Of ihe Winter Quarter,
This Quarter begins at ſuch Time as the Sun enters
the Southern Tropic, namely; Capricorn, which happens

the Planets at this Ingreſs is a 6 of À , and f in the
Aſcendant; and above all , the approaching grand Con
junction of the two Superiors Jupiter and Saturn in Virgo;
and now in this figure in the gih Houſe both retrograde and
within 1 Degree of their partil ó , which actually does not
take Place by.my Tables until the 16th of July , at 7 in the
Morning, notwithſtanding which its Influence has begun
to operate ever ſince their placique Aſpect, which cook
Place from the Beginning of last September, and particu
larly ſo from the Commencement of this Quarter.- It
happens in the Horoſcope of France, particularly Paris,
and it falls in a Square Aſpect of the laſt 6 in f , the
Horoſcope of Spain, and in Oppoſition to the Aſcendants
of Portugaland Egypt; and , I am ſorry to add , in a ſquare
Aſpect to the Aſcendant of London . Theſe Countries and
Places will feel its powerful Effects and baneful In Auences,
and every other Country alſo that is connected or at
War with the French Republic. Theſe Conjunctions of
Jupiter and Saturn do certainly convert and change
Things in the World , and the obſervations of all Ages
are Teſtimonies ſufficient to confirm it, had I room to men
tion them . -It is well known to all Europe, that many
eminent Changes and Contentions have happened ſince
the laſt Conjunction in f , in the Year 1782 , to go no
farther back, wherein ſuch great Alterations in King
doms and States have happened which perhaps no Age
can parallel. This preſent Cor'unction Thew's miſerable
Complaints among the Poor in general , both for Want
of Money and Want of Trade ; it often produces ma
lignant, peftilential, and contagious Diſtempers ; fome
times great inundations of Waters ; and in other Paris,
and at other Times, extreme droughty Seaſons. “ It is
obſervable ibat there Planets have not been far diſtanced
from this Aſpect for a long Time paſt, in which what un .
accountable Things have been tranſacted, what inteſtine
Feuds and Diviſions would fill a Volume to recount! - The
French Republic is very adive both in preparing Levies of
Men for recruiting her Armies, &c. and alſo as prudently

conſulting how to manage her Affairs at Home, for Pro :

Enterpriſes. - Our Work is not finished ; it is true ;in ſome
Countries it is begun , and ſome Foundation laid for acting
of greater Matters when Time and Opportunity offer
themſelves.—The Sword is not yet ſheathed !

Of the Spring Quarter,
WHICH takes its Beginning on Sunday the 21ſt of

the Heavens appear as in the above Scheme. - Here is an
Appearance of Treaties offered, Ambaſſadors and frequeno

which was ſomewhat violent, and this is not much better,
for here ő is in 8 of 21 , who is allieted of h , and h is
in 8 of.8 .-From ſuch Configurations what can we prc
nounce, but that all the Subtily, Deceit, and Hypocriſy,
that evil - minded men can ſuggeſt are ſet on Foot ? Mars in
en Atill ſhakes his bloody Flag, and makes his Sword ſharp
for the Battle . - 1 foreſee great Contentions occaſioned by
the Diſcords of the great Men of the Earth : there will be
likewiſe great Alterations and Changes of Rulers ; the
Right- hand of the World Mall fear the Left; a mercurial
Hero, that is a witty and eloquent Perſon , ſhall, by De
grees, atrain the Kingdom or Empire ; he ſhall be a Lover
of Freedom and the juſt Rights of Mankind, and by his
Means the Nation's Religion and Laws ſhall have a Change :
and alſo we may expectto hear of military Actions both
by Sea and Land , for it ſeems the great Heroes of the Age
have ſtill (as heretofore) an Opportunity to ſew their Va .
lour. -Some eminent and great Events and Alterations
will lortly be made viſible in the different Parts of Europe.
Some of the Places where the great Scene of Affairs may
be expected , are Italy, France, Germany,Spain , Portugal,
Holland, and Pruffia, together with Ruffia, Sweden, and
Denmark, &c. though it appears that a great Northern
Nation may be leaft affected, as the ó of 4 and
happens in a trine Aſpect to the Aſcendant of Ruſia,
which is friendly . - The Turks ſeem alſo concerned in a
hottile Way . - I hope the United Kingdom ofGreat Brie
tain and Ireland will remain internally tranquil, and that
Me will in the End triumph over her hoftile - Enemies
So let every Englilhman ſay.
Of the Summer Quarter.
This Quarter begins on Thurſday the 22d of June, at
27 Min . paſt 5 in the Morning at which Time 21 Deg.

in a Piece with the laſt Quar er, except the Warlike Planet
Mars, who is got into the Signr, his domal Dignities and
Horoſcope of England , which will put Courage into the
Britiſh Soldiers ; and denotes Reſolution and ſome Succeſs
to attend our national Affairs.-- In this Quarter happens
the grand Conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn in the earthly
Sign Virgo, where 4 receives his Detriment, and h
wholly Peregrine, and out of all his Dignities. This of
the Superiors I look upon ( as it now falls in the earthly
Triplicity ) as a Birth , which by Time and Order of Nan
ture gradually comes to Perfection, and performs the Work
the great God of Nature has ordained is for ; for I judge
no ſmall or trivial Matters to ſucceed this 6 , and the more
ſo as an Eclipſe of the Sun directly follows it, and falls in
the very Sign and Degree thereof, which fignifies the Sick
neſs or Death of ſomeKing in the ConfinesofVirgo, or the
lamentable Death or pitiful End of ſome great Perlon, & c.
with a Scarcity of the Fruits of the Earth ; it alſo denotes
Dulneſs in the Magiſtracy, Herefies in the Clergy and
Church, together with Beggary and Poverty to many
Countries .
Of the Autumnal Quarter.
This Quarter begins on Thurſday, September 23d, at
8 Min. pait 7 at Night, when 9 Deg. of 8 aſcend, and
16 Deg. of vg are on the M. C. the D ab. D & ad . * ;

I fear, with miſchievous Actions, which , to avert from
there Kingdoms, and all his Majeſty's Dominions, let us
implore the Aid of that Almighty Being at whoſe Command
the Powers both cf Heaven and Earth were first created ,
and are ſtill preſerved from degenerating to their primitive
Nothing ; and without whole Permillion the greateſt Ty
rant in the Univerſe, nay even Lucifer him felf, cannot
overpower the moſt deſpicable Reptile or Infect, nor even
diſcompoſe the most minute Atom of Matter pertaining to
this brittle Globe.
