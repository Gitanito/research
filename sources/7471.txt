Then all at once a feeling of comfort overwhelmed me and I thought, 'It's over at last.' Then I was home and all around me was pure white light and total love and caring and a comfort I've never known nor will I forget. I couldn't see anyone but knew I was not alone and had nothing to fear. All the time, there was this overpowering feeling that I had made it home at last.  After a life-long wait, everything was perfect and my life was now complete. Then I felt heavy pressure in my chest and I opened my eyes not knowing where I was. My wife was standing at my side crying. I asked what was wrong and where am I. Then I remembered where I had been, what I had seen, what I had felt, I love my wife but I felt a sadness of loss because I had been home but just for a short visit. I love life, but I know what awaits me and it's wonderful.
