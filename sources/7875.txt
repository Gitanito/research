I was floating upward. I was thinking how I wasn't having any pain. My neck and shoulders had been in a spasm for about two days. It was the first time in five years that I could feel warmth. The light was so bright, and warm, it had a yellow hue about it. (I told people that if the light was that bright it would blind you.) It was bright, but warm and calming at the same time. I could hear voices, none were familiar to me. At first, I didn't understand, but it became clear. It wasn't time for me. I wanted to stay. I was at peace.

NDE Elements: 

At the time of your experience, was there an associated life-threatening event?    Illness     I had sepsis. I'm not sure how dangerous it is. I almost stopped breathing.  

How do you consider the content of your experience?      Positive

Did you feel separated from your body?    No  

At what time during the experience were you at your highest level of consciousness and alertness?      Was not alert.

Did time seem to speed up or slow down?      Everything seemed to be happening at once; or time stopped or lost all meaning   I don't know how long I was there. I didn't know the date or time.

Did you pass into or through a tunnel?      Yes     I walked right inside. The light drew me closer. It was warm, safe and comfortable.

Did you encounter or become aware of any deceased (or alive) beings?      Uncertain     They were in my blind spot. I was not familiar with the voices. They said I had to go back, it wasn't my time.

The experience included:      Light

Did you suddenly seem to understand everything?      No     

Did scenes from your past come back to you?      My past flashed before me, out of my control     

Did scenes from the future come to you?      No     

Did you come to a border or point of no return?      I came to a barrier that I was not permitted to cross; or was sent back against my will   The voices decided for me. I was overwhelmed. Happy because I was getting a second chance. See my family again.
