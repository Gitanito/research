            		Experience Description:   

When I was playing with my young sister 'to hide' I was running towards our home's roof to hide from my sister. While I was trying to go upstairs by the stair I thought to try to go down to the under stairs through the gutter pipes. When I climbed the gutter pipes, it broke down and I fell from eight meters high on my head and back. My breath was stopped and I felt I wanted to scream or to talk, but I couldn't - the world was in 'circles - rounding'. I had a strange feeling as if in another different world, a world than cannot be reached except by the dead ones. I couldn't feel my body. The darkness was overwhelming. I was unconscious for two minutes. I started screaming because of intense pain. There was a break in my back and hand, and now I am well, thanks to God.
