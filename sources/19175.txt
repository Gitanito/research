you
okay I enlisted in the Air Force in 1977
September and went into basic training
January of 1978 from there I went into
security police technical school and
what I found out was I was one of the
first women in the career field not
deepers but one of the first groups that
they just opened the career field up to
women and I didn&#39;t know that at the time
and so I that was soon to be a discovery
when I got to my purse face which was
RAF Bentwaters and so I finished tech
school in April and I left departed for
RAF Bentwaters in May 1978 and I got
there and I was stationed at the 81st
security police squadron and my job was
pretty much entry controller and working
working in law enforcement I was put on
be flight bravo flight and pretty much
what we would do is
to promote make sure to the base secure
our job was to go to the back aid and
just make sure that the gate was locked
up so I was on patrol at the time and I
was had a colleague with me airman his
airman Duffield we were both airman
first class which is III at the time and
and we had just checked the lock on the
gate and we were just filling out our
check sheet and making sure everything
and we&#39;re just sitting there and it was
about 2 3 o&#39;clock in the morning and it
was just really it was a it was a clear
night wasn&#39;t raining out and we were
just kind of you know bored figuring out
we got about four or five more hours
left and you know so we&#39;re just sitting
there talking and all of a sudden this
light approaching that was coming from
the area the North Sea so it&#39;s coming
west to east and a person looked like it
looked like and we thought it was just
regular aircraft coming in and and and
we looked over at the at the runway
waiting for the lights to go on figuring
you know while the aircraft coming in I
mean sometimes they would have not often
but you know an aircraft would come in
and and then it as it got closer and
closer and now is about maybe 200 it
wasn&#39;t really that far it was just this
it was a big light and just stopped and
this guy and I we&#39;re looking we noticed
that the that the runway lights aren&#39;t
on when we see this light and then a
non-sentient it just stops in midair and
then all senators moves up down left
right and then it breaks into like three
pieces and speeds across the runway and
now we&#39;re stunned we&#39;re like what the we
you know what was that so we immediately
got on I got on a radio because we you
know we were thinking what is that and
we get on the radio
and at this is February of 1980 and and
I mean we were kind of excited about you
know please control this is police four
be advised that and I think the guy who
was the because I thought about this who
was the the desk sergeant at the time
with sergeant Cohen he was a war
sergeant and and he was pretty much
saying you know say again until we
repeated it which I was all this you see
on the slide if this aircraft and you
know when but we couldn&#39;t see the
aircraft itself the speed the rate of
speed that it was moving when it went
when I went across I mean it was moving
in like a regular aircraft then when it
stopped then when it did its movement
and then when it&#39;s Plymouth read and
when it went sped across the runway
going it was going west you know it was
just going at a phenomenal speed and the
only other thing that really caught our
attention was that it didn&#39;t make any
noise there was no sound to it at all
and we were like you know this we just
you know we just didn&#39;t know it was just
to get an idea if you go in this
direction if you go in this direction
you&#39;re going off base right here is
right here is the runway from what they
said back in December of 80 is here is
where they had the landing site of where
the aircraft had landed this is the
house this is a folly house it&#39;s at the
end if you if you&#39;re leaving if you&#39;re
departing Bentwaters Woodbridge RAF
Woodbridge you usually go you go up this
road here and then you&#39;d hang a left and
then you go toward that water side
anyway when my had my UFO sighting and
here is the runway right here it was
this close
that put an X right here and as for the
size it you know from the distance we
were gosh I guess I&#39;d say it was
probably about size of a car or small
truck or something it was probably about
maybe two football like football field
lengths away and it flew across the
runway the runway itself was then it
then it was probably about roughly maybe
a football field length away because the
runway itself wasn&#39;t that far from us
and then when it took off it went
straight up and then it kind of
disappeared I mean it flew across and
then it kind of went straight up
and and that was the last we saw of it
no broken to the three pieces at when
the first approached it came up it
approached and we just were waiting for
it to start heading toward the runway
making its you know doing whatever
thinking it&#39;s an aircraft of course we
were waiting for the lights of the air
the runway to turn on and it&#39;s that&#39;s
where it stopped about two football
fields away and that&#39;s why I did it
up down left right and then it&#39;s and in
the movement was very geometric I mean
the movement was not it was not a normal
movement it didn&#39;t move like chaotic
very definitive as for the way it moved
I mean it was just that probably throw
us more than everything than anything
because it was just so you know I didn&#39;t
know of any aircraft to do that at that
and it was like an etch-a-sketch board
it&#39;s like if you take something and move
it up and move it in a movement we&#39;re
very definitive and then and then it
just you know up-down left-right and it
then it kind of must have come to the
middle and that&#39;s where it split into
three pieces and then those three pieces
split off but they went across the
runway it was it was a lot faster than a
jet pilot a jet point I mean it just
kind of it just it moved it just moved
so quickly it was um it would have been
a difficult object to keep you know to
keep track of like if you were to look
in a camera type thing to follow it and
I would say the one thing with not
hearing any sound coming from it that
was really really disturbing about a
year ago currently I&#39;m in the Army
Reserves stationed out of Fort Belvoir
so I&#39;m still active Reserves and I&#39;m a
captain now and so there&#39;s some
credibility behind that and we were at a
promotion ceremony and they introduced
some of the guests who were there and
one of them happened to be a retired
three-star general general Edmundston
and he was a three-star general if
anybody knew anything about what
happened at Bentwaters I said and he&#39;s
retired well maybe he can tell me a few
things and I thought it was kind of
interesting that here he was I went up
to him and I had
all my ribbons on and he recognized my
ribbons he used to be an Air Force and
we were talking and and I said yes sir I
said in fact I was stationed at some
really interesting places and some of
them are now closed and I said one of
them was already about waters Oh bout
waters yeah that was a great base and I
was thinking the back of my mind in 1980
he probably could have been a 1 star or
2 star I mean he hadn&#39;t pretty hot
and I said yeah in fact I was there
during the time when they had that huge
when they had that UFO sighting and we
went from a very sociable conversation
to he just clammed up and I said I said
I kind of figured I&#39;d still come pursue
it a little bit I said did you know
anything did you hear anything about it
and he said uh yeah if I did I&#39;d have to
shoot you like ha ha ha and at that
point he said I have to get back to my I
have to get back to my guests and but he
went from being completely sociable to
and I knew he knew something his body
language I mean you went from completely
relaxed to rigid then this this other
guy came up to me who is also I think he
knew him but they were all in the same
guest party and he said he said I
overheard your conversation and he
happen to be an electrical engineer for
the Air Force and and I said Oh feeling
kind of stupid you know I think great
and he said he said you know they found
something out there now I felt I was
like ok and he said well you know we&#39;ve
been working with a plastic with the
material that we had gotten from back
then
and I was like oh really he said oh yeah
yeah back then it was pretty raw but now
we&#39;ve been able to use it and to refine
it and and they&#39;ve been able to use it
and it can take so many degrees of heat
and temperature and and he mentioned I
think something about like it was a gray
material it was kind of like this like a
like a I think at the time it was like
this raw type like I just stick I guess
or and and I was sort of thinking to
myself you know it just seemed like
people were giving me bits and pieces of
more information as for you
and in a lot of ways validating that
what was out that there was something
out there they had retrieved a material
and he he specifically said electrical
engineer that it was not it was not
indigenous to here at the time as an
a-10 based we also had nuclear weapons
there it was about four or five o&#39;clock
in the afternoon and I was standing
outside and most of the traffic again
had gone off the base and all of a
sudden it&#39;s like the sky had broken open
it was a it was like this huge wave had
gone across the sky the whole sky just
kind of rolled it was like it was as
though I guess it&#39;s sort of like this
and thing of I want to say the top of
the mushroom part of the saya like a
like a bomb type thing but I had seen
the sky and I always sort of again I
what was that
and I got on the radio and I reported it
and it happened within like a minute and
it was you know and it wasn&#39;t you know I
was used to seeing by this point - I was
he&#39;s seeing clouds and I was used to
seeing you know I you know I know the
way clouds move and and this thing look
like it just looked like a wave moving
across the sky and it was definitely had
that rolling sensation across the sky
and I took oh it took over the whole sky
I know from from my location where I was
it wasn&#39;t like a small little thing it
the whole sky sergeant Penniston drew
his revolver when they encountered this
object and saw clearly it wasn&#39;t it not
anything they were familiar with these
are all highly trained observers as we
all were at that time for aircraft or
unusual things
sergeant Penniston drew his revolver and
aimed it at the phenomena at some point
isn&#39;t I believe his
