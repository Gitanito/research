My grandmother died in February 2010. My grandfather and   she had been together for over 75 years. Yes, that’s right – my grandfather is   95 years old and still alive. He was pretty devastated when grandma passed over   and felt like a part of him died last March.

Much to my surprise, my grandfather admitted to me that   he had several after death communications (ADCs) from her. He said he could feel   her presence, she appeared in dreams, and sometimes she talked to him. He also   told me that he was interested in the near death experience (NDE) and would like   to read some of the experiences. So, I copied over 500 pages in large print so   he could see it, put it into a couple of 4” D-ring binders, and sent them to   him.      What started as a kernel of an idea - to make reading NDEs more accessible   to those who don’t have access to a computer, germinated so everyone can read a   book of these precious outcrops containing stories of love and hope.
