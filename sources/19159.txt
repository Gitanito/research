and he said let&#39;s take a walk east I
wonder what talked to you he was a
member of Douglas MacArthur&#39;s security
guard and he told me that Douglas
General Douglas MacArthur was very
familiar with the Roswell incident that
he himself had seen the material plus
the bodies that were taken from Roswell
that&#39;s he told me of course he was
passing two on a TD when I to the States
from Japan and inter said if you ever
say need to meet anybody that I told you
that was just a mine my name is Leonard
croco I&#39;m from Waldwick New Jersey
entered the military in August 23rd 1949
in Jersey City I went into military of
my twin brother and I had gone to
Lackland Air Force Base my training camp
going Georgia but a communications
training and then sent to him field
Hawaii arrived there on May 4th 1950
after May 4th 1953 well at that time
actually would say Ronde became
established buck sergeant and I was
working in the communications it was
weather relay and Hickam Field had to
theatres one was in a closed theater
brand-new and then he had an outdoor
theater at the under Hickam Field by the
entrance of Pearl Harbor and it was
situated on a mount because it had to go
down he only had a bad show and it was
one night we were watching a movie with
about 250 people there and it was of
course in Hawaii the only time it rains
in the summertime it&#39;s in the mountains
so with the clear night with the moon
over our left shoulder
I wasn&#39;t like in the middle of the of
the audience on the right hand side and
somebody else somebody turned around
since what now hell is that I never D
turned over and looked over to the right
and over to the entrance of Pearl Harbor
there was nine silver discs and the
first signing that they had was it was
like a letter L and before know what
they were going this way in
that way and they&#39;re making oak we want
them for about 10 minutes everybody just
kept looking and we had some colonel get
up and he said don&#39;t worry about it
folks he said that&#39;s all spotlights but
being an idiot like me I jump and I said
colonel I said what do you mean
spotlights no clouds
there&#39;s no beam of light coming from any
place and you&#39;re tunning gets its
spotlights and he told me to shut up and
just then a bird Colonel jumps up and he
saw knew the bird Colonel killer who
that&#39;s why I knew he was very good name
is the Miller he jumps up he says
colonel he said you shut up he&#39;s a he&#39;s
not gonna fool the people here they&#39;re
all military so we watched her things
about ten minutes and then they just
took off so we walked up there as we
were crossing the parade field with the
right next to Holly Mekhi bags four of
us will walk in there and all of a
sudden something when the hell is that
so we looked over towards Diamond Head
and these two lights we saw in the
distance and horizon and all of a sudden
they were done from one end to the other
and just like that over top of our heads
nothing no sound no nothing and that was
it and we knew that the fastest thing we
ever had at that time with a flying wing
that we saw them fly in Hickam and there
was trail by a couple of uh I think was
p38 or p-47 at that time and they
couldn&#39;t even catch them that he was
about five hundred and thirty five or
five hundred fifty miles an hour was a
top speed for these things were they
were really bad and there were times
that we read in the Honolulu newspaper
that they attract these objects once
before from Hawaii to Japan and even
it&#39;s I was bearish chief and in the
middle in the Air Force we were not
allowed to carry weapons and some guy
with this gentleman walks in little buck
sergeant with army uniform on and a 45
strapped to a side and I asked the
matter that&#39;s him what he was doing
there and he said to me well I&#39;m going
to be billeted here for a couple of
weeks I&#39;m on TDY to the States
I&#39;d won out that 45 you&#39;re not he said
when I might write so he they call the
CQ and guy comes up B comes up he says
to me to sergeant he&#39;s it&#39;s okay for him
to carry the 45 is authorized he&#39;s a
member of General Douglas MacArthur
security guard I had to find but he&#39;s
got he&#39;s doing a lock of the way in a
locker and he&#39;s going to double lock the
locker fine we did that well while he
was there we became very friendly and it
happened the things that it happened
happened to mention him about the
instance party took the life that we saw
going over in a parade field and then we
meet I talked to him about the UFO that
we saw the nine disc and he said look if
I can&#39;t talk to you he said well let&#39;s
take a walk let&#39;s go out across the
street to the parade field with his
nobody around so we went out there if I
want to tell you something he said but
if you say that I told you I&#39;ll swear I
never mentioned it to you might have no
problem and he said to me you know I&#39;m a
member of General Douglas MacArthur
security guard he says I&#39;m on my way to
the States for TDY Ethan I&#39;m gonna
30-some General Douglas MacArthur was
very familiar with the Roswell incident
the mid crash material at also the
bodies because he himself has seen him
is what he told me the reason I feel
that they did this and here once you lie
it&#39;s very hard to get out of it there
was two reasons one you have we just
came out of a war a bad war
- well active three minutes - we were we
were in competition with Russia but the
I think the main reason was at the 1939
Halloween deal with the War of the
Worlds the vision for Mars you know when
this team when these this Roswell
incident happened the East Coast was
never notified the East Coast was never
notified because when they had the War
of the Worlds
remember the dev&#39;s boats have landed in
New Jersey they panic people panic Miley
didn&#39;t I live in Pennsylvania at the
time outside of Scranton and I was only
a kid but I&#39;ll never forget the news our
people panic and people running wild in
the streets in
to work and so on people were actually
really going out with guns and shooting
at cows in the end at that time memory
but isn&#39;t like today you had a lot of
farm area down there remember I got 1955
I came back to Andrews in 1953 so it&#39;s
in that timeframe
I knew the c-47 pilot he flew me up to
Hilo the day that Kilauea erupted after
50 years of being dormant and they&#39;d
himself told me that they themselves had
had sightings of strange craft but being
military personnel they were not allowed
to discuss it
yeah we&#39;re the team based out of Andrews
and they they said to me you know if we
go out we mentioned something he thought
they&#39;re gonna hang around and they asked
me what I knew and I told him about
Hickam Field I told him you know about
the friend again and I said but I did
you know I&#39;m a staff sergeant and I said
I&#39;m probably sticking my foot up my rear
end if I keep talking about this stuff
and now totally something in the
military they do ridicule you that I was
ridiculed a few times I was told I would
never make Master Sergeant I was on
orders for tech but I was told I would
never make Master Sergeant my butt just
wrap up again then he said if you keep
this crap up pieces you&#39;ll never make
Master Sergeant he&#39;s I know you&#39;d run
orders to attack but you&#39;ll never make
Master Sergeant he said don&#39;t force he
wanted the military
we came down from Washington through
channels and we were told that we were
all wrong that it was just a weather
balloon that was the only thing that I
think we heard was well that&#39;s the end
of that story
shouldn&#39;t have printed all that to start
with and you know this type of thing
