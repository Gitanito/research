          Frightening NDEs
          -Jeffrey Long, M.D.

&nbsp;

    &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   A small percentage of NDEs are frightening to those that experience them.&nbsp; While   these NDEs are unusual, they are definitely real NDEs.&nbsp; There has been   remarkably little research on frightening NDEs.&nbsp; As a result, what we know about   frightening NDEs must be considered less certain than virtually any other aspect   of NDEs.
  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A 1992 study found three different types of distressing NDEs (Greyson,   B.; Bush, N. (1992). Distressing near-death experiences. Psychiatry, 55,   95-110.). &nbsp;These three types of distressing NDEs could be classified as 1)   typical NDEs that were interpreted by the NDEr as frightening, 2) NDEs with a   sense of nonexistence or a frightening void, and 3) NDEs with graphic hellish   imagery.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As   noted, there are several types of frightening NDEs.&nbsp; Some NDErs encounter   elements of the NDE that are seemingly pleasant, but are frightening to the NDEr   at the time of the NDE.&nbsp; An example of this would be considering a typical   tunnel experience to be frightening.&nbsp; Another example of this would be if the   NDEr considered the angels encountered during the NDE to be frightening, which   has been reported, though rarely.
  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most NDErs encountering a void of feel a sense of pleasantness or   connection, and find the experience pleasant.&nbsp; However, some NDErs encounter a   void that they find frightening.&nbsp; The void may be experienced as empty,   unconnected, and unpleasant.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many   NDEs are not purely frightening, but have parts that are both frightening and   pleasant.&nbsp; When NDEs have both frightening and pleasant components, it is more   common for the frightening part to occur first.&nbsp; For these NDEs, they eventually   transition into the later, and usually longer, part of the NDE containing the   more typical pleasant experience elements.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Encountering frightening moments during a NDE is not rare.&nbsp; The NDERF survey   asked “During your experience, did you consider the contents of your experience   (NOT the possible life-threatening event that led up to the experience) to be:”,   followed by the options of “Wonderful”, “Mixed”, or “Frightening.”&nbsp; Of the 613   NDErs responding to this question with a NDE Scale score of seven or higher,   62.5% selected “Wonderful”, 33.8% “Mixed”, and only 3.8% “Frightening.”&nbsp; The   finding that about one in three NDEs selected “Mixed” is surprising.&nbsp; It has not   been widely appreciated that such a high percentage of NDEs have such an   apparent mixed emotional component.
  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will comment further on “Hellish” NDEs.&nbsp; “Hellish” NDEs may be   defined as NDEs describing landscapes, entities, or sensations that are   unworldly, frightening, and suggestive of classical concepts of hell.&nbsp; Hellish   NDEs are the least common subset of frightening NDEs.&nbsp; It is estimated that   about 2% of all NDEs shared with NDERF contain hellish imagery. 
  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hellish NDEs are difficult to study.&nbsp; It was several years after   NDEs were first described in 1975 that the existence of frightening NDEs was   known.&nbsp; Multiple prior studies, including all prospective NDE studies published   to date, found no frightening NDEs.&nbsp; People tend to interpret hellish NDEs based   on their pre-existing beliefs; often with a component of fear.&nbsp; This is   understandable, as they are frightening and outside of most of our life   experiences.
  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prior studies of frightening and hellish NDEs have established that   it is wrong to assume that “good people” have pleasant NDEs and “bad people”   have hellish NDEs.&nbsp; In spite of the findings of these prior studies, this   erroneous stereotype persists.&nbsp; This stereotype could greatly limit the desire   of those experiencing hellish NDEs to share them.
  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is often difficult for NDErs who had a pleasant experience to   share their NDEs.&nbsp; It is understandable how hesitant an NDEr might be to share   an experience that was frightening, or even terrifying.&nbsp; NDErs experiencing   hellish NDEs are likely aware that they risk inviting negative judgments from   others due to the content of their NDEs.&nbsp; Those experiencing frightening NDEs   may be more comfortable sharing anonymously on a website, such as NDERF.&nbsp;

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To help understand frightening and hellish NDEs, one important   observation needs to be considered.&nbsp; There have been experiences presented in   the past by other researchers that were called NDEs, but were actually not NDEs.&nbsp;   Some of these hellish non-NDE experiences were REM-intrusion, ICU psychosis,   drug experiences, etc.&nbsp; It may be reassuring to many individuals who had a   frightening experience to discover that their experience was not really a NDE.
  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For those truly experiencing frightening NDEs, some understanding   may be available from the largest prior study of frightening NDEs, a study by   Dr. Rommer:
  
  &nbsp;Rommer, B. (2000). Blessing in disguise: Another side of the near-death   experience. St. Paul, MN: Llewellyn Publications.
  
  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This study reviewed dozens of frightening NDEs.&nbsp; Dr. Rommer presents   suggestions regarding why frightening NDEs happen, and how they affect the NDEr.
  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Rommer believes frightening NDEs occur for three reasons (Rommer,   B. (2000). Blessing in disguise: Another side of the near-death experience.   St. Paul, MN: Llewellyn Publications.).&nbsp; These three reasons are 1) a motivation   to the NDEr to reconsider prior choices, thoughts, and beliefs, 2) the presence   of a less than loving mindset immediately prior to the NDE, and 3) due to   negative programming during childhood. 
  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It will be recalled that the aftereffects of typical pleasant NDEs   are generally substantial and quite positively life-changing.&nbsp; Consistent with   the aftereffects of pleasant NDEs, Dr. Rommer found those experiencing   frightening NDEs often had substantial positive life changes, including a   greatly reduced fear of death.&nbsp; Moreover, some individuals experiencing   frightening NDEs came to view the experiences as a gift, and perhaps the most   important experience of their lives.&nbsp; As with pleasant NDEs, changes following   frightening NDEs may require many years to fully manifest.
  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many prior NDE studies used the term “negative” to describe NDEs   that were frightening or hellish.&nbsp; The term “negative” is inappropriate, as they   often result in the same positive life changes resulting from pleasant NDEs.&nbsp;   This is why the term “frightening” is the more appropriate term for these NDEs.&nbsp;   Others have referred to them as “distressing”, which is also a good term.&nbsp;   Although the term “frightening” expresses the emotion of the experience, it   overlooks the reduction of fear, including the fear of death, which often occurs   as an aftereffect of a frightening NDE.
  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For anyone interested in reading more about frightening NDEs, there   is an excellent scholarly review of what is known about frightening NDEs in:
  
  Bush, N. (2009). Distressing western near-death experiences: Finding a way   through the abyss. In J. Holden, B. Holden, D. James, The handbook of   near-death experiences: Thirty years of investigation. Praeger Publishers,   CT.
  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ultimately, frightening NDEs are a mystery.&nbsp; There is an   overwhelming need for more quality evidence-based research.&nbsp; There is also a   need for further thoughtful consideration of existing evidence.
