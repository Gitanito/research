    I had a brain tumor that ruptured.  I didn't  know I had a tumor since  I had  always been healthy. 

  It all started when I left  work on a beautiful, September day to take my then 12 year old son to the dentist,  a drive of about 30 miles. On the way home, my truck was making  noise.  I said to my son that I had better look at the engine before we enter the turnpike. When I pulled over on the side of the road,  popped the hood, and started to look at the engine, I went blind. I rubbed my eyes thinking that when I finished with the truck, my vision will return. It didn't. I could hear my son's voice in front of my face. He was asking, 'What's wrong with your eyes dad?' I couldn't see him, but I knew something bad was happening. That's when my heart started pounding  fast and I started sweating. I didn't know what was happening to me. I thought I was having a heart attack or a stroke. I told my son to run across the street and get help. So he did. When I tried to get back in the truck, I noticed my legs didn't work. I fell against the truck fender,  holding myself up with my arm until it gave out. I fell to the ground. I heard people running towards me.  They asked what was wrong. I replied that I didn't know but  I couldn't see and my legs weren't working. The men picked me up,  carried me to their garage, and called an ambulance. When the ambulance arrived, they took me to the hospital and performed a CAT scan. That's when the doctor told me that I had a ruptured brain tumor. They couldn't explain why it was bleeding and then quit bleeding, but that there was nothing they could do and that I was going to die. They called my family and the doctor held my hand for six hours.   I was still alive, so they transported me to a hospital in Pittsburgh that performed the surgery I needed. 

  During my surgery, I was in a tunnel. It took no physical effort to move up this tunnel because it was all done with my mind. The more I thought about going home to heaven, the faster I travelled through the  tunnel. When I stopped thinking about travelling upwards, I  stopped completely. I then reached my arms out and put my hands into the wall of the tunnel. The walls were about 3-feet in diameter and made of black clouds. Then, I thought about moving again.    

  When I reached the end of the tunnel, I noticed the most beautiful sight I have ever seen. I saw huge large, beautiful yellow daisies as far as the eye can see. The landscape  was all flat with no boundaries.  I was completely filled with intense love such that I had never felt before. I noticed that I didn't have a body and  was hovering a couple of feet over the daisies.     

  Next, I saw a spirit standing on the left side of the exit of the tunnel. He was pointing with his left arm towards the middle of the field. When I looked closer, I noticed a tree in the middle of this field of daisies. I then knew this is where he wanted me to go. The tree was about 3 miles away but I reached it in a few seconds. I was amazed at the size of this 20-foot wide tree.  I was still hovering over the daisies while touching the bark of the tree. When I looked up into the branches of the tree,  I noticed that the sky was all white. It was a white that was so bright that it almost hurt my eyes to look at it. There wasn't a sun or any color in the sky. I only saw  the brightest, white clouds that I have ever seen. 

  I then took an emotional inventory. I  was not mad,  sad, or scared. I didn't miss anyone.  I was just filled with a love like I had never felt before.

   As I was looking at the sky, a spirit darted out of the clouds and was headed straight for me. She flew right up to my face and looked right into my eyes. She intensely looked into my eyes for about 15 seconds as  she  read my soul. In an instant, I knew everything about her and she knew everything about me. She then moved away from me saying, 'You have to go back. It's not your time to come to the heavenly kingdom.  When it's your time, you will come here again.' I told her, &quot;I don't want to go back!   Bodies are heavy and they hurt.' She replied, 'I know that. But heavenly father wants you to go back and do work for him.' I  said,'OK, what does he want me to do?' She replied, 'You will know when the time comes.' 

  I really didn't want to go back but she convinced me to go back. She said the heavenly father wants m to go back and do work for him and that while doing so I would be protected. She also told me  not to be discouraged by other people's negative judgements. At that point, I knew I was special and that I wasn't going to die from my surgery. I  didn't really know how I was going to be protected. But I knew it was a very good thing. 

  We  talked  a while more. She told me that  heavenly father doesn't want us to judge each other and he wants us to all be equal. He wants us to enjoy life, be happy, and grateful. The most that he wants from us all is to help each other. He wants us all to help each other more than we help ourselves.

   While we were talking under this massive tree, I noticed a small pond of clouds in the daisies. It was about 40 feet in diameter and there was 6 spirits standing in the pond of clouds and looking down. Every once in a while, one spirit would bend over and pick up another spirit. It would  cradle and embrace it in it's arms then look up and fly very fast into the clouds above. Then another spirit from above would fly down into the pond and takes the other spirit's  place. This went on for some time. 

   I then asked the angel what they were doing over there.  She told me that they were watching hospitals, doctors, and very sick people but they won't intervene with patient's illnesses. After speaking with this angel for some time, she moved away from me and flew straight up, through the tree and didn't even dodge a branch. She vanished like a puff of smoke. I then knew it was time for me to go. I didn't know how I was going to get back, but I knew that I would be in a lot of pain.  

   I wanted to remember as much as I could, so I looked around trying to remember every detail. I noticed that there weren't  any bugs,  cobwebs, bees, ants, or butterflies on the daisies. There was no wind,  birds, or any sun. It was  very quiet and calm. There was no time in heaven.  

   I went back to my body. I was in so much pain!  When I woke up in the recovery room, I  noticed a man sitting across the hall behind glass. Every time I opened my eyes, he would look at his monitors and then he would look at me. I knew after 3 or 4 times of doing this that he was watching me. After looking at me a few more times,  he wasnt' there. I had noticed that even with all the tubes and wires connected to me,  all the hair on my body was standing up. I thought they gave me something in my IV to cause this. As I looked at my left arm, I noticed a lady standing there looking down at me with a big smile. She had long white hair down to her elbows. Her face and skin were all wrinkled, but what really stood out was her  large,  bright blue eyes. I then knew that she was the reason for the hair on my arms  standing up. It was like the entire room was filled with static electricity. 

 She asked  me, 'Do you know that heavenly father wants you to come back and do work for him?' 

 I said, 'Yes. That's what the angel told me under the tree. But she didn't tell me what he wants me to do. She only said that I would know when the time comes.' 

   She then put her finger on my lips. My whole entire body felt like someone just dumped a 5-gallon bucket of water down my throat and filled me up, all the way to my toes. Just then all the alarms started to beep.  The lady turned,  walked to the door still smiling, and turned left. 

   A few seconds later the young man who was watching me came into the room and said, 'TIM! You are doing great!! What happen?' I said, 'I don't know. I feel good. Where did that lady go?' He asked, 'What lady?' I said, 'The lady who was just here with the long white hair.' He said, 'I didn't see anyone but I will go look if you want me to.' I said, 'Would you please?' He said, 'Sure' as he went out and turned left. When he came back he said, 'Tim, you are the only one on this floor and the doors are all locked. You are the only one here.' 

  At that moment, I knew that all the things I had experienced in heaven was all true. The woman was another angel. I knew there was something very special  was going to happen in my life and that I was going to be protected. I wrote a book about my entire experience as requested by this angel and the priests at my church. Please read the book to find out about the gift that these angels gave me.

God, Spiritual and Religion:       

What was your religion prior to your experience?      Christian- Catholic   I did keep in touch with the priests at my church. They were very interested in my experiences and wanted me to write a book to let many people know about my experience. I am not a writer but I finally did. 

Have your religious practices changed since your experience?         Yes. I actually feel special now. When I go to church, I realize that these people are reading from a book to understand about heaven and I feel so good because I am one of the very few that had actually seen it.  

What is your religion now?         Christian- Catholic   

  Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was entirely consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience.     The beliefs I had were pretty much the same. I always believed in GOD and heaven but to see it and come back to tell others is just amazing! I was chosen to do God's work for him by these angels and that makes me feel very special.  

Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         Yes     We must help others.  

  Did you seem to encounter a mystical being or presence, or hear an unidentifiable voice?         I encountered a definite being, or a voice clearly of mystical or unearthly origin.   She was an angel. She looked like a puff of smoke with the biggest and brightest blue eyes I had ever seen. Her eyes were very large and she spoke to me through her eyes.  

Did you see deceased or religious spirits?         I actually saw them  

Did you encounter or become aware of any beings who previously lived on earth who are described by name in religions (for example: Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, etc.)?         No     

  During your experience, did you gain information about premortal existence?         Yes     I was told by this angel that the heavenly father wants people to be equal. He doesn't want us to judge each other. He wants us to forgive instantly and the very most is that he wants us to help each other more than we help ourselves.  

During your experience, did you gain information about universal connection or oneness?         Yes. We all need to love each other way more than we do today.  

  During your experience, did you gain information about the existence of God?         Yes     I did not see GOD but I saw heaven and  spoke with angels there and here on earth.  

Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:       

  During your experience, did you gain special knowledge or information about your purpose?      Yes   I was given a gift from these angels. I can tell when people are sick. All the hair on my arms will stand up, like static electricity. 

During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?         Yes     We are all going to be judged some day by GOD and he is not going to care about how much money we had or what kind of car we drove or how nice our houses were. He is going to judge us by how many people we helped in our lives on his earth.  

  During your experience, did you gain information about an afterlife?         An afterlife definitely exists.          I went to heaven and spoke with angels. There is an afterlife and I actually cannot wait to go back. It is a blessing and an honor of the highest order.  

Did you gain information about how to live our lives?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about life's difficulties, challenges and hardships?         Yes     These angels know we are suffering here on earth. They truly understand our pain but life is a journey we must all complete before going to the heavenly kingdom.  

  During your experience, did you gain information about love?         Yes. Love is the only emotion we have when we go to heaven. It is a love that most people have  never felt before in this earthly life. It is much greater.  

  What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         Large changes in my life. God has taken things from me. I lost some vision, my hearing in my left ear, my memory, and I have word displacement. But he gave me much more in return. He gave me my life back and he gave me a second chance at life. He also gave me a gift to help others. What else can a person ask for? It's just true love from him.   THANK YOU GOD!  

Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          No   

After the NDE:       

  Was the experience difficult to express in words?        Yes   I have never felt a love like this before in my life, so it is hard to explain.  The same goes for the trying to describe  time in heaven, since there isn't any.

  How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  This journey to heaven is  etched into my brain and I know every exact detail of my experience. It is like the angels did this to me.  

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         Yes     I was given a gift from these angels. I can tell when people are sick. All the hair on my arms will stand up and I helped many people now.  

Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          Yes. I can tell when people are sick.  

Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    It was about 6 months before I found out what God wanted me to do for him. The first person had cancer behind his left eye. I told him he had to go to the doctors. He did and he received treatment and he is fine now. He hugs me when he see me now.  

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       No     

  What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real.     If you believe in god, the experience stays real. 

  What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real.     I look at life differently now. Nothing we are doing here on earth matters. As long as we honor God and do what he wants, I know I am going to a much better place after this life.  

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       No     

  Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?         I know I am special to be chosen to do God's work. I try to tell people about my experience but it seems they don't believe me. I really don't care because the angel told me not to be discouraged by other people's negative judgments. Now I know what she meant by that comment.  

Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?         No.
