Floating, so it seemed, completely aware of what was happening. Although I could see nothing I could feel every part of my body down to my waist. Although in the dark I seemed to know which way was forward or backward. In essence, gravity and three dimensions seemed to still be in play. I noticed an utter peace and feeling of non-concern and was of a blissful state I will never forget. I was fully aware what was happening to me and then I thought of my soon to be wife, asleep at Kona Shores waiting for me to come home and I remember asking myself what she would do now. At that very second I felt myself being forced back to where my body was lying and I entered into it so hard my body actually bounced off the concrete.
