history: when communities and nations
become crowded by thoughtless, selfish
minds, they become overbalanced, lose
sight of morals, destroy life and confis­
cate properly. Then after the storm of
bloodshed, which relieves the pressure,
again coincs a new epoch; but ever toward
a higher level of ethics, in search of the
arts and sciences destroyed. New and
better ones arc acquired, lilting nun out
of the mire and lust and dust of degrada­
tion that awakens the soul within to re­
flect its precepts and principles of God.

T ub wori-d, again in travail, has given
birth to a new era which now faces its
infancy. Again the work! is prepared,
convalescent from severe purging; to re­
ceive the spiritual essentials of life as
adapted to the next round of the Jacob’s
Ladder of Involution. The United States
will absorb it first, and those who have
prepared a Table shall find the hungry
gathering to partake in response to the
words, “Eat ye and drink”. And shep­
herds — (they who have ears) — will
again hear the echo of “Feed my Lambs!”
And it lias not been said, “Feed only the
white ones” ; hut “Feed my lambs and my
sheep”.
