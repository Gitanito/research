Animal EleCtricity.
N
01~HIN G has been fo great an obfiack to
the advancen1ent of Medical Science, as
the partiality and obfequious regard \V hich the
generality of Phyficians of all ages have paid
to great authorities. For vvhiift they difregard
the teiti1nony of their fenfes, and indolently
afTent to things on the credit of others.
they remain pailive dupes to their own credu-
lity, and feldom examine whether they are
right or \Vrong. An error thus admitted, is
reluCtantly corred:cd, and becomes the copious
fource from \vhich nutnberlefs faHe opinions
flo\v.
There are perhaps but few that are not diffi-
dent in deviating fro1n principies efiablifhed by
n1en of general crud ition, w hofe geniufe~ were
qualified to interrogate nature 'vith fuccefs :-
B·It an error once difcovered fhould be imme-
diately correCted, in oppofition to the ipfe dixz·t
of all the dogmatifis of fevcntecn centuries.-
Man by nature poffeffes a niju.r .formativus, and
B
( 10 )
is as prone to novelty and invefiigation, as the
earth is to revolve from ungovetnable laws of
nature. Yet~ there are few difcoveries in tLe.
healing art but what n1eet \V ith tumultuous op-
pofition, from the congregated legions of rre-
judice, ignorance and an1bition. Some nomi-
nal philofophers difbelieve every propoGtion
that does not accord with the infallible doc-
trines of their imn1aculate ancefiors; and others
are fo extremely illiberal, as to difcard every
new principle in which they can have no claim
to interefi. A glaring example of the latter
\Ve have, in the degrading denunciations of the
Engli01 philofophers, ·when the illufirious Dr.
·Franklin's difcovery of the identity of Light-
ning and EleCtricity vvas firft delivered to the
··world. A fecond, no lefs true, we have in
the difcovery of Dr. Perkins' Metallic Opera-
tion, ·which vvill like the former arife triunl-
phant atnid11 the counter, but [utile, vocifera-
tion of prejudice and ignorance. Some rejec1
the latter, becaufe they vvere not t.he inventors.
Others quefiion the tefi:imony of their fenfes,
becaufe they cannot explain the modus operandi
thereof, by referring it to the good old doc-
trines of Van Hehnont, Doleus, or Stahl.
Yet the happy day is perhaps not far diftant,
.when envy mufi: fall a facrifice to truth, and
behold this problern accounted for, on a o.ative
·law of the animal reconomy.
That the bodies of ani1nals poffefr a fluiJ
analogous to electricity, haJ long been fufpett-
ed by Phyiiologifis and other fpeculative phi-
lofophers. The n1atter long refted ho·wever ott

pure conjecture alone, and the apparent intri-
cacy of the fubjeCJ: depreifed the hopes of the
bolJe!l: experi1nenters. But accident not un-
frequently does more for the real advancement
of fcience, than boai~ed art and genius are able
to accotnpliih. It was accident that firll: fug-
gefied to th~ celebrated Gallz'leo, the,~~con:O:ruc­
tion of that optical infl:rument denominated the
telefcope. It was accident that firfi led the
immortal Ne·wton to the original conception of
that principle of gravitation, by which he af-
terwards cxplaineJ with fuch facility the
nlO\'ements and ex qudite balance of the tnate-
rial univerfe. It ·was alfo acciJent-that firft
fuggeited to the ingenious and indufirious Gal-
~uani, the n1ode of experimenting \Vith effeCt on
the fublime and intricate fubjeet of Anitnal
Electricity. '' \Vhilfi Profe!for (;a!vani was
engaged ii1 diffeCting a frog, in a room \Vhere
fome of his friends \Vere amufing then1felves
\vith an electrical-machine, one of them drev;
~ fpark from the, conduCtor,. at the fame in-
.fl:ant that the profelTor tou~hed one of the
nerves of the animal. In an initant the \Vhole
body of the frog \Vas iliook by a violent con-
vulfiun. The profe:l.for was afroniilied at the
phenomenon, and believed it owing to his hav-
ing v.rounded the nerve. 1'o a:l.fure himfelf
\vhether this ·was really the cafe or not, he
pricked it \Vith the point of his knife;. he the.n
touched the nerve with the inftrument as at firft,
and ordered a fpark to be taken from the rna-·
chine ; on \V hich the contractions \vere renew-
cd. 'The experi1nent \Vas repeated a third
B 2
( 12 )
titne, but the animal rc1nained tnotionlcfs.-
HovJeYer, upon perceiving that he held his
fcal pel by the handle, \Y hich \\';1s of ivary (a
bad conductor) he changed it for a n1etallic
or~e, and re-excited the n1oven1cnts, which he
confiantly failed of doing -vvhilfi ufing an elec-
tric fubftance. · After having rnadc a nutnber
of experi tnents 'vith the electrical tnachine, he
refolved to profecute the fubjeet \Vith atrnof-
pherical electricity. vVith this view he raiied
a conductor upon the roof of his houfe, fron1.
\vhich he brought an iron \Vire into his rooxn,
to this attached n1etal conductors, connected
v.rit h the nerves of the anin1als defiined to be
the fubjec1s of his expcritnents, and to their
legs he tied -vvires ·which reached the floor.-
Confiderable rnoven1ents \Vere obferved in the
animals whether of cold or \varn1 blood \V hen-
ever it lightened. T'hefe preceded thunder,
and corrcfponded \Vith its intenfity, and even
took place when any Hanny cloud paifed over
the apparatus. 'Vith fitnilar vie\vs he fufpend-
ed frogs on Inetal hooks fixed in the fpine of
the back, upon the iron railing of his garJrn;
feveral tin1es he retnarked that thefe anitnals
contracted, and appe~red to receive fhocks .-
At firfi he conceived the rnove:rncnts 'verc ow-
ing to changes in the atrnofphere, but a
n1ore fcrupulous exarnination undeceived hitn.
-H'1ving placed a prepared frog upon an iron
plate in his room, and hQpp~ning \Vith his dif-
fec.ting forceps to prefs it againft the plate, he
obferved the 1novtmcnts to take place. 'fhis
experin~ent fuccecded \vith all 1netallic bodies,
( I 3 )
but more particu1arly \vell \Vith filvcr; nou-
rondutting fubH:ances \T.rcrc not p:.-oper for it~
Fro:n this period our author began to fufi)ed
the anin1al poifc!Ted an electricity of its o\vn;
and in this fufpicion he confirmed bin1fclf, by
~~ feries of cxperin1cnts coincident in the refult.
And no fooner had Profcifor Gah,ani publifhed
to the vvorld his experiments on anin1al eleCtri-
city, than their farne difpread f\vift as the in-
tangible fluid they regarded. J)r. Valli, an
Italian phyfician, was the 11rfi that co-operated
vv·ith the celebrated Galvani, in invefiigating
that animal fluid the exifience of v.rhich had
been fo long fufpeeled, but fo ]ately realized
by aB:ual experi1nent. After repeating the ex-
pcrirr,ents of his predeccffor, and infl:ituting n
feries of experitnents fuf11ciently tedious and
. lengthy, Dr. Valli conceives hitnfelf unequivo-
cally authorized to conclude, that the anirnal
f1 uid of Galvani, was entirely the fan1e wiLh
the ful•tle Jnatter of electricity. rfhis conclu-
fion he alledges to be the fpontaneous and ne-
ceffary refult of the fo1lo·wing pofitions, wbich
he delivers as fubflantiated and confirrned by
~1..C1:ual experitncnt :
" I 11, Subfrances which conduct electricity,
are condut1ors likewife of the nervous fluid. H
"' 2dly, Subfiances \vhich are not conductors
of electricity, do not cor:duct t}-.~e nervous
fluid.'~

'"
prcferve it likewife for the nervous flu-
id."
" 4thly, Cold, at a certain degree, renders \Vater
a non-condth'lor of eleCtricity, as well as of
the nervous fluid."
" sthly, The velocity of the nervous fluid is as
far as vve can calculate, the Ctme with that
of cleetricity. ~'
" 6thly, ·rhe obfiacles which the nerves under
certain circumfiances oppofe to electricity,
they prefent likewi(c to the nervous fluid."
" 7thly, Attraction is a property of the eleCtric
HuiJ, and this property has been difcovcred
in the nervous fluid."
Having enun1erated and detailed the forego-
ing argun1ents, the Doctor, in an effu{ion of
triumph fuhjoins, " vVe here fee the gn~atefi:
an:1logy bet\veen thefe fluids; nay, I tnay even
add, the characters of their identity.'-' 1\s an
additional fupport to the faroe opinion, Dr.
Valli adduces the peculiar and ilriking phe-
nomena exhibited by the 'Torpedo, the G.ymno-
tus-clectricus, the Siluru.r, &c. v1 hich he fup-
pofes to proceed from a fluid in every refpeCl
the fame with that difcove1ed in frogs by the
profeffor of anatotny at Bologna. In fucceffion
to Dr. Valli, Mr. fowler entered the lift of
philofophers, in invefiigating the fublimc but
intricate fubjecl: of Anitnal Electricity. A,nd
to ufe his O'-Vn \Vords, " i\fter," fays he, " a
great variety of experin1cnts of \vhich it \vould
be unneceffary here to relate 1110re than the
refult, I found, that I could not excite in an
( 15 )
anitnal the appearances defcribecl by Galvani,
\V ith any fubftances whatever, w hcther folid or
:fluid, except the metals : and that the mutual
contatt of two metals \Vith each other, fo far
as I wa5 able to detennine, \Vas in every cafe
neceffary to the etTec1." And after findhing a
feries of experiments, a feries fufficiently nu-
merous and diverfified for the d1ablifhment of
general principles, J:\11 r. Fowler favours us \vith
the following concluGons refpeCting the nature
of the nervous fluid. When lnving fl:ated a
fe\v analogies between the animal fluid of Ga/...
vani, and that of the Torpedo, &c. he then re-
verfes the comparifon and lays do" n feveral
points of what he terms effential difference, not
only bet ween the two preceding fluids, but alfo
between the fluid of Galvani, and the matter of
electricity. " This influence," fays he, (re-
ferring to the nervous fluid of animals) differs
both fron1 that of the 'Iorj'edo, &c. and from
eleCtricity, in producing no fenfation (in man
at leafr) :at all fimilar to that of an electrical
fhock. 'fhey however produce a difagreeable
fenfation, even in frogs, independent of that
'vhich mufi neceffarilv arife from irritation and
Inufcular contraCtion.J" But the mofi impor-
tant and characteriftic difference which I have
yet difcovered between this new influence and
electricity, confiils in their efFects upon the
contracl:ile po\vers of animals. Electricity has
a tendency to defiroy that povver UfOD which
contratt:ion derends; vv hereas the n1etals have
in all my experiments had the directly oppofite
etfec1. " Oxygene is, fo far as I know, the
( )
on.l.y fiinHdu:; in nature, whofe cfiects are at all
analogous.·:* T'hc difference here tnentioned
by Mr. Fowler) is in tny opinion 111ere!y owing
to the various degrees of the powc~s applied,
and not to any fpecifir or elementary difFeTencc
in the powers the1nfdves. 1'he electrical fhock
is injurious and deleterious fron1 cxcefs, but in
cafes of diminifhed n1obility frorn pan'tlyft~,
contufion, &c. it is not only a falutary but an
invaluable fiitnulis, and happily fitted to re-
frorc the contractile po·wers of the fyftem.-
F'rotn \vhence then :uifes this dfential difference
defcribcd by i.Vlr. For-..clcr? It may be anfwered,
that electricity is a falutary ilin1ulis vvhen ap-
plied in a proper degree, and injurious from
excefs alone.f Which is far fro1n proving it
to be naturally a noxious principle: tor the
whole clafs of natural and healthy ihmuli, as,
oxygenous gas, heat, anitnal food, exerci fe,
fpiritous liquors, &t. are not only injurious
fron1 excefs, but \vill alfo impair the contrac-
tile powers of the fyfiem. To illufirate thi~
fubj cct a little farther, I \Vill prefent the reader
* The 1JeEls qfoxygene on thef:Jlem isJo clearly
illuj1rated in Dr. Beddoes' Ejj.'rys on Pthijis Puf-
mo:Ja!is, &c. that it is unnecdfcZJy to 1/zke notice oj·
it at prifent, further rban to mention that be proves
it to be the principle of irritability if the miJcular
fibre.

Q\Vn word::.:
EX P E R I l\'1 E N T I.
'' I divided. (fays he) the fciatic nerve of
one leg, and tied the crural artery of the other
in a large frog. Scarcely any blood \Vas lofi:
in doing either. 'f\vo days after this, I flrang-
led it. Duriug the firfl: twenty-four hours, the
leg in \vhich the nerve had been divided, ap-
peared to contract \Vith the mofr vigour; after
this perio I, the difference between then1 became
tnore doubtful; but the contractions were at no
time fironger in the leg whofe artery 'Na~ Led,
than in that \V hofe nerve \vas divided.
EXPERIMENT 2.
'' The fame operations were performed on.
ct Luge fen1ale frog full of fpa,vn. Four hours
afterwards fhe was covered by a male, who
had been treated in & fimilar tnanner. I men-
tion this circumfl:ance, as it tends to prove, that
the pain occaGoned by the operation, was pro-
bably not fo great as to produce tnuch fallacy.
" On the day follo·wing, fhe had fpawned,
and on the fixth day frotn the operation fhe
\Vas 11:ranglecl. When laid upon a plate of
zinc, and excited by means of a rod of filver,
the contractions were found extremely feeb.le in
the leg w hofe artery had been tied' and ceafed
~!together in about twenty-four hours after her
death.
G
( )
" In the leg ,~vhofc nerve had been dividcd 1
they appeared as vigorous as they ufually are
in legs to which no iujury h~1<.t been previ·
oufly done, and continued excitable upwards
of two days after they had ceafed to be fo
in the other."
To account for the difFerence in the refults
of thofc experitnents, it is only nece1T3ry to
confider the principles upon 'vhich the contrac-
tion of· mufcles depends·; i. t c irritabiJity and
nervous energy. 'fhe firfr is more particularly
the vis 7JZJtjcularis, and fupplied by the blood;
the Lltter is the exctting caufe of mufcular mo-
tion, and fupplied by the nerves. Roth prin-
ciples fuffer exhaufrion, and· require continual
renovation. In Experiment 1ft, a difference
\Vas perceptible only in the firfl: t\venty-four
hours; but in Exp~rin1ent 2d, the leg whofe

energetic principle is the im1ncdiatc and excit-

Involuntary tno-tion is alia dependant on the
nervous energy, as the attion of the heart,
Jungs, &c. and if a nerve i~ divided, tllf de-
pen.Jant pe1.rt fuffers cn1aciation; and the aCtion
of the arterial fy!tcn1 is din1inifhed~ even by a
cornprell1on of the brain. 1v1 ufclcs of involun-

icrvient to volition, their original for:n1ation is
different, and the coating and exciter, fays L1r.

l-Ienee their diff.~rent rnoven1ent~ may very rati-
onally be irnputed to their different degrees of
electricity. Volunt:ary mufcles require a Jarg~
nun1ber of nerves, ~nd a firong charge of elect-
Iicity to aCt i!l obedience to the vvdl; \Yhile the
latter require but fevv nerves, and a fn1all de-
gree of th~s principle, to enable the1n to per-
forn1 their more pailive functions. The ~a ions
of the latter are hovvever, n1or!t unifon11, and

it has 3rriveLl to the ultinzatum or ne plus ultra
of phy!iolo£.Yic:d iuvefiif.!ation. There how-ever

For the performance of fpontancous motion,
the ~pplication of foreign fbmuli a1c generally
requiiitc; though tranf1tory fpontancous mo-
tions arife all() frorn an irregular tranfmiilion
of the cleCtroid fluid. \Vhenever the nerves feel
a fi:i nnllus, the eleCtrical fluid is excited, and
its effeCts are tnanifcfied in~ the production of
otion; and vvhen the fii1nulu5; is \Vithdra\vn
or ceafcs to act, another efrect is Froduced,
which is relaxation. 1"he latter, though ge-
ner~lly an indirect effect, (or perh~ps tnore
firittly a negative condition) may notvv-ith-
fianding be directly produced by the action of
certain po\vers denominateJ fedativcs; among
\vhich the nicotimta is probably the n1oft une-
quivocal. In a cafe of incarcerated hernia, in
which all manual attempts to·wards reclutlion
\verc ineffeCtual, rny \Vorthy preceptor, Dr.
Currie, of Pbiladcl}'hia, concluded, that the
operation alone could prevent i1nznediate death.
He di.retted •n ounce of the nicotiana to be giv-.
en in decoction per injeCliolle; but th~ nurfe
inattentively gave a quarter of a. pound. And
a {hort tin1e after \Vhen ·we returned to perform
the operation, \VC found our patient to all
appearances expiring. The Doctor. \vhofe
heart \\'as never a {hanger to fyn~pathy, vvas
not a little diil:re:!fed to find his patient aprll-
rently dying fron1 the negligence of his nurfe.
The event -vvas hoYvever fortuitous . . ()n exa-

of the fphincler vcficcr, and an involuntary ef-
flux of urine. Fear, ·which is alfu a fedativc
povver, \vill not only produce fpontaneous con-
vuli1ons or palpitations of the heart, but even
death, or eventual relaxation. 'This vifcus is

~xcited to contraCt, by the irritation of a me-

with the P.oint of a fcalpcl. The experiment

for a:fccrtaining the lca:fl:: pofi.hle degrees of

Mr. Fermz·n, Dr. Pricjl!y, Sir Charles Linr:eus,
and others, obferve that metals ~ue the befi con-
dud:ors of Animal Eleclricity, and that fon1e
metals are better Cf)nductors than others. Vla-
ter ~nd \vood are conductors of both anin1al
and natural electricities. Thofe Jt'acts if con-
fidered impartially, certainly afiord US the 1110fr
pnequivocal tefis of the analogy of Natural and
·A nimul EleCtricity. .But M.r. Fr;~-/cr obfcrvcs
that the relation of Natural and J\ nimal Elect..
ricity is the mofl equivocal in tnan. It hovl-·
ever would be irrational and unphilofophical to
fuppofc, that nature had furniihed fuch a vari-
ety of unitnals, and even fubjefrs of the in-
fed tribe, (for exan1plc the glo\v-\vorm) ·with
this truly dignified property, and .v/ithheld it
from the nobleit and moft perfeCt anin1al in the
creation. Yet it mufi be adrnittcd that the

of the clcd:roid Huid, or extra degree of energy
