  		              		Experience Description   

    In February 1995, I had a curettage procedure after a miscarriage; when the doctor administered the anesthetic, he told me to take a deep breath and relax, and that's what I did. But suddenly, I felt that I was hurled backwards at an incredible speed, and I then abruptly found myself in a beautiful landscape full of flowers. It was huge and I wondered where I was; I could see on every side, and everything was pure nature, with flowers of all kinds of colors; it was a really beautiful place.  

  After a while, I felt that I hurled out again, but forward this time. When I fell back into my body, the doctor was patting my face. When I woke up, I didn't know who I was; I was kind of stunned. The doctor told me:  "Your husband and your mother are outside," and I wondered who they were, as I didn't know. Then they took me to a bedroom and my family says that I looked at them as if they were strangers. Then I slept for a while, and when I woke up, I was able to tell who my relatives were.
