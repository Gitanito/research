  		              		Experience Description   

    I had 2 experiences, both somewhat similar. I  will try my best to explain. 

   When I was about 5 or so years old, I had the flu and a high fever. I was so terrified of doctors, that it took several nurses to hold me down to get my regular immunizations.  I remember lying on the couch trying to take a nap. The next thing I remember is hearing my mother on the phone with the doctor.  But I was on the ceiling looking down at myself. I was not really alarmed at this and  it did not hurt or anything.  The experience lasted a couple minutes. Then, I must have gone back to sleep or something as that was the last thing I remember of that experience.  
  
  The second experience was when I was 14 and  having a surgery. I remember being anesthesized with the face mask and counting backwards.  The next thing I remember was again looking down on myself.  I heard the flat line beep on the heart monitor because my heart stopped.  There was a lot of commotion as they were trying to get my heart restarted. I was not in pain. I remember hearing them yelling for me to not leave, which seemed strange to me. This only seemed to last a few moments. The next thing I remember was waking up briefly in and out of the intensive care unit (ICU). Later I was informed that I had an allergic reaction to one of the medications.  The doctor was amazed at my recovery from this surgery because it took half the time it should have taken. I was actually trying to get out of bed when I was in the ICU.  They needed to sedate me.
