  		              		Experience Description   

    I have swallowing issues.  I went to a restaurant with my family, and food became stuck in my throat.  I went to the restroom to dislodge the food, as I often have to do.  I was unable to dislodge the food and knew that I was going to lose my airway.  I panicked at first, but then became very calm.  I simply said to myself, 'You're going to die.'  My stepmother came into the restroom at this time, and I was able to convey to her to call 911, but I already knew I was dying.  I remained very calm.  

  I did not do any bargaining or praying. Despite thinking that I might do this because even as an agnostic, I had done so when the threat of losing family members was at hand.  

  I just very calmly laid myself on the floor of the restroom stall,  and everything went dark. I was told the the fire department responded quickly.  I was also told that I was barely breathing, taking shallow, agonal breaths and had a faint pulse.  The doctor said if the EMTs had not shown up when they did, I had about two minutes left to live.  I woke up in an ambulance, but continued to go in an out of conciousness for a couple of hours.  I do not remember any of the rescue attempt until I was later admitted to my hospital room.

  I do remember everything going black.  I felt warmth from the sunlight all over, even thought the scene was dark.  I felt happy and calm.   The dark scene changed like a 360 degree theater with images of all types of things, flashing all at once on all sides in a sort of semicircular, skylike screen in front of me.  I cannot recall the specific images.  At one point, I remember a peaceful scene of dinosaurs. Next, I saw a jungle that looked like a prehistoric landscape.  Then I saw millions of stars all over the sky.  I felt like all the mysteries of humanity were about to be revealed, like I had all the knowledge I would need.  It felt good.

    Then all the stars were sucked into a tiny pinpoint in the blackness and it was over.  I felt upset that I wasn't able to stay and get to keep the knowledge.

  When I woke up, I kept saying, 'I went somewhere'  and 'For just a moment, I knew everything.' 

 I recently lost a child, and this experience gave me great comfort that this is not the end, and that we will one day understand our purpose.
