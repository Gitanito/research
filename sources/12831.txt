I had begun hemorrhaging after surgery and they could not be stopped. Medical staff had told my family they could do no more.

I remember light and waking up later telling the nurses I was in pain. She asked why I had not told the doctor. I have no memory of the doctor being there. (This was very early morning hours.) After this, I have no fear of dying or, indeed of any medical emergency.

I had a similar experience on October 4 1971 when giving birth to my second child. I hemorrhaged heavily about two hours after for several hours and nurses called my husband back to the hospital and told him there was no more they could do. Once again, it stopped as quickly as it started, and I was quite at ease. I have had a severe car accident (five wedge compression fractures of the spine and a fractured sternum) but had no thought of death or even worry over the possible outcome.
