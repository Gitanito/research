  		              		Experience Description   

    I had posted my experience on another forum before. 

   I was in a car wreck several years ago that resulted in a leg fracture and a head injury. I was transported to hospital emergency room. I was in the  ICU less than an hour when  something weird happened to as my body went into  cardiac arrest. Supposedly, I was unconscious on the emergency room bed. Yet, I distinctly heard a high pitch sound “diiiiiiiii” and then there was a very bright beam of light coming down from the above. I felt my body floating up; meanwhile I saw a lifeless body below me. 
    
    I was accompanied by a light while flying though the universe.  We enterred a vast outer space while moving at the speed of the light. Then we went through a bright,  glaring tunnel that was so brilliant, that  I am still very impressed by even  today. The tunnel was made of multi-colors and was spiral. I felt time ceased when I went through the tunnel. Abruptly, I noticed a ray of light at the end of the tunnel. When I reached the light, I saw a beautiful meadow with  many exotic plants and animals. 

    I saw a 3-D movie projecting something.  I did not understand what it was  until  I regained consciousness. Then I  recalled that it was  my life review showing  important events as going to schools and getting married in my life. Then I saw people whom I did not recognized, and they told me it wasn’t my time yet, so I needed to go back.  Next, a light appeared and instantly, I was back in the hospital. 

      Later on, the doctor told me that my heart had stopped, and I was revived after they performed about 15 minutes of CPR resuscitations.    
    
    I did a serial research after my experience. Based on the science definition, mine was successfully restored after clinical death. Another theory was that I had experienced an NDE when my soul had left my body. As for the religious perspect, I had been to the other realm, yet all the phenomena were not conclusive.  However, I do believe human beings have souls; theoretically, it is the origin of life, an energy after death, but its magnetic magnitude could not be detected by any instrument.    

    As to describe the feeling of this experience, it was speechless. It is similar to dreams but not likely to be a dream. My mind was in a vivid state when my heart had stopped; it was dark but I was still be able to see everything.  Initially, I felt a floating sensation, and while I was flying in the air my vision was 360- degree that I could see everything around me. It is difficult to express the perceptions when I saw my left-behind body and my soul floated up in the air simultaneously.  According to the Buddhism, the kindhearted will enter into the blissful, prosper wonderland eternally after death; I am no longer afraid of death because I had touched the brink of the other side.
