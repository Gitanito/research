    Summary:&nbsp;  From Pat Deveney's database:

 Light of Ages.
 O, send out Thy Light and Thy Truth.—Psalms
 1892  Monthly
 Lookout Mountain, TN.  Publisher: Lookout Institute.  Editor: A.J. Swarts, Ph.D.
 1/1, March 1892.  12 pp., 75 cents a year.

 Advertised in Flaming Sword, May 14, 1892 as the new journal of Swarts who earlier had published the first New Thought periodical, Mind-Cure and Science of Life.  It promised to contain "Rational Mind Cure, Light of Truth,  Development of Healing,  Divinity," and to devote itself to the defense of "every true reform" and to "educate its readers in the great Science of Healing."  Essentially, it was an extended advertisement for Swarts' Lookout Institute for absent healing and absent teaching, whose services could be retained by sending $2.00 and a brief description of the ailment.  These, then, were considered by Swarts and "three associated healers" in the shrine at the Institute (four chairs at the corners of the room, the center of which was occupied by an altar with a book in which were recorded all of the thousands of persons healed by Swarts), and absent healing and teaching were conveyed to the petitioner.   On Swarts, see the note under Mind-Cure and the Science of Life.  Contributions by Charles W. Close, Joseph Rodes Buchanan.  NSAC, Lily Dale (1/1, March 1892, the only issue known and probably the only published).        Issues:Light Of Ages V1 N1 Mar 1892      </p>
