INTRODUCTION.
R ITO NS your Monarch's high Renown proclaim,
On every Sea and Shoar, with Voice of Fame :
Shew how our Catfar's Fleet the Van hath lead,
And her brave Heroes on their Foes do tread ;
With Englijh Courage how they plow their Way,
Through raging Billov/s, to the deftin'd Bay :
How England in her Grandeur is retriev'd,
By George and by Britain s brave Sons reh'ev'd.
The Signs of Peace o'er Europe's Stage now run,
And great Alliances we fee begun ;
Great Britain 5 Friendfhip fought by all, doth fhew,
Her Grearnefs in the rood delightful View ;
Sav'd from /&/w*'s Priefts, no longer lhalJ. Hie mourn,
No longer dread that dreadful Chance to burn ;
Or worlhip their high Hofi, and Saints invoke,
Bow down to Idols, or a heavier Yoke :
But Thanks to Heaven and George, cur Fears are flown,
The Mift's difpelPd, and their vile Schemes overthrown.
If Enemies we have ftill, may they feel
The keen Effe&s of harden'd Britijh Steel.
Find Rebels Fate, like thofe that try'd their Skill,
Of late for Popifh Caufe, and Victims fell ;
When their Devices were broken in cne Hour,
And Popiih Priefts mill of tyrannick Power.
Then fpare no Pains, but with unwearied Mmd,
Seek Britons, till whate'er you feek you find j
Till facred Powers arife and bring to light,
All Popifh Treafons, and their Sons of Night.
Sbimefs rebellious Tribe to juliice bring,
And hang all thofe that Plot againft the King/
The TABLE of the TERMS explained.
OW every Term hath port or all thefe Returns, ntmu
Craftins, Qclabis, (?uiffjien£, Jfres, Menle, and Quin-
que. Every Return alio has a Bans or Know-day, from
whence they make their Reckoning ; the Signification of
which are, Craftins is the Morrow after the Bafis, as Cra-
ftins Trinitatis is the Morrow after Trinity Sunday, it be-
ing the Day of Denomination ; Oclabis is eight Days in-
clusively ; Quindene is fifteen Days after, and Tres three
Weeks, Wienie a Month, and Qiinque five Weeks after.
Ncte, Now every one of thefe Returns has four Days to
confiil upon, the firil whereof has a double Signification; for
the one is the Day of Return, the other the Day of Efifoin,
I
for the Defendant in a Perfonal Ad ion, or the Tenant in
|
a real Action to be efibined ; the ftcond is the Day of Ex-
f eeptjons, for the PlaintifF to lay an Exception if n© Efibin
be caft, that the Defendant (hail not be eiloined or amer-
ced ; the third is Returna Brevinus, or Day whereupon the
Sheriff muft return the Writ ; and the fourth is the D*y of
Appearance for Parties and Jufrors in the Court of Common-
Pleas. But if any of thefe Days (all on a Holy-^ay, that is
no Court-Day, as in Eafter-Term, on Holy-Thuifday ; or
upon St. John Bsptift, in Trinity-Term ; in Michaelmas
Tern*, on AlKSahit^, or AH-Scmls !i*y ; and in Hilary-
Term, on Candlemas- Day ; or »pon any Sunday, which are
no Court-Days then muft the next Day following ferve for
feoth ; as if the Efibin Day, and Day of Exception ; and fo
of the red. Thefe Days are of moll UTe in the Common-
1
Pleas, where ;;!1 Suits commence, foV. But for Latitats, or
other Procefs upon a Bill certain, k is upon a Day certain,
as Die Lun-s prox, poll Purif. which always is reckoned from
the Effbin Day. In the Chancery Court none of thefe Re-
turns are ufed, but only the Day of Appearance, which is
Quarto die poll. But if a Capias, Exigent, Scire-Facias, or
JJirtringas be executed after the Efibin Day by the Sheriff,or.a
Commifiibn fetupQn, out of3 ny of the aforefaid Courts, after
the feid Efibin Day, 'tis neither juftifiab'e nor warrantable.
L° .' here's a Tradefutpafftib all the reft,

In Ibme of my former Almanacks I have taken no*
ice that the Spirit of God is now performing great
Wonders in all Nations, in order to bring about the
great work of Reformation 5 and that it was the Opi-
nion of manjr good Chriftiansj That the Call of the
Jews will be in this Age, and that too very fuddenly;
particularly in my laft : where I think I have made it
very probable from a numerous Train of Deductions,
that in this very Year 1750, we mayexpeft fome more
than ordinary Appearances and Motions in moft Parts
of the World, eipecially in the Northern and Eaftern
parts thereof, tending to the overthrow and deftru&i-
on of Antichrift. Tidings out ofthe Eaft, and out of
the North fhall trouble him (fays Daniel, chap, xi.)
yet he lhall come to his End, and none fhall help him.
That the time of the Jews Reftoration, and Com-
mencement of the Millennium is near at hand is cer-
tain, whether lb near as the time above-mentioned is
as yet uncertain 5 But this uncertainty arifcs from the
many Hiftorical and Chronological Difficulties to be
found among Hiftorians. Some Authors making the
time of the lame Event {boner, others later, A. B.
JJIber and other Chronologers fince his time, place the
Birth of Chrift juft 4000 Years from the Creation
Scaliger*, Petavius, and fome others not fo much 5 B\ft
the Septuagint and Jofephus much more ; The like
difference in Accounts is to be found amongft them in
many other Hiftorical Fa&s.
There is a Tradition among the Jews, that the
World fhall continue 6oqq Years, viz. 2000 Years
void, 20c o Years under the Law, and 200c Years un-
der the Meffias $ and at the End ofthis fix Thoufand
Years, will commence the Millennium, or One Thou-
fand Years of Reft for the People of God 5 and par-
ticularly for his chofen People the Jews, Latfantius
C 4 fays
8 Moore, 1750
fays, wherefore, bec^ufe all the Works of God were
compleated in Six Days, it is neceflary that the:
World
continue in this State 6ix Thoufand Years, which Six
Thouiand Years, Cyprian lays, are already almoft
compleat, fince the Devil attacked Mankind^ Mr.
Wbijlm obferves, That this Notion of a Millennium is
universal, and is derived from the carlieft TraditionT
both among the Old Heathen Philofqphers, the An-
tic nt Jews, the Apoftles, and the Primitive Fathers
of
Moore, 1750. 9
of the Church ; and is an undeniable and molt im-
portant Portion of Divine Revelation 3 In his Sacred
Hiftory lately published, vol ii. p. 435. he fays, that
by the exa&eft Chronology, the firjt Six Thouland
Years from the Creation, end about A.D. 1766. ("which
is 16 Years hence,) -That is for certain fuppofed the
Beginning of the Millennium, when the Jews will
be rdtored to their own Country, and rebuild their
Temple upon the founding of the feventh Trumpet.
A Trumpet is theSynlbol of War 5 and in the Re-
velations we find, that all the Seven Trumpets were
to be attended with Woes and Lamentions $ Six of
which are already paft, and the 7th which is yet t«
come, denoimceth tne third and kft Woe; under it
the Seven Vials of God's Wrath are to be poured our,
both upon the EalUrn and Wellern Antichnft, that is
the Turk and Po$e. It is laid, Revel viii. 13. Woe to
the Inhabitants of the Earth, by realon of the Trum-
pets thist are yet to found, and ch. xv. ver. 8. it is
laid, no Man was able fro enter into the Temple till
the Seven Plagues ofthe Seven Angels were fulfilled :
which intknateth, that the Holy City and Temple
annot be prepared to' receive the i\ hteous part of
iankind, till the Power of the Turk, and Pbpe are
/th dtllroyed, or that the Seven Viataare all poured
Afamous French Author ifihis Account of the Non-
ftufipn ot the Seven Vials, fays, The ffirft Vial poured
n the Earth, intends the Lofs of Church Revenues,
d lo falls upon the worldly lnterell of AntichrilUan
ien. The kcond Vial poured upon the Sea, which
e lays is the Papal Kingdom in its greateft Extent,
hich will become as the Blood of a dead Man, lb
at every Soul which liveth in it fhalj die^ for as
iili cannot live in Water turned into Blood, neither
an Mankind any longer endure to live under the Yoke
>f Poptlh Prieils and Governors. '
The third Vial
vhich is poured on the Rivers, denotes the Deftruition
f Popilh Dodnnes. The fourth Vkl which is pou-
ed forth on the Sun, threatneth the Ottoman Empire
nd Religion \ the 4th Trumpet railed that Empire*
nd tae iourth Vial lhail deiiroy it. The fifth Vial
is
*o Moore, 1750*
is poured out upon the Seat of the Beafl, or the City
of Rome, which predifcls her Deftruftion ; The Angel
reprelents the Popes Kingdom as full of Darkneft, and
his Subje&s gnawing their Tongues thro' Difpair.
The fixth Vial is poured on the great River Euphratesf
that is, on the great Empire of the Turks and their
Religion } after which there will be nothing to hinder
the Princes and People of the Eaft, who (hall be En*
Jightned or Converted $ or the Jews who are there
difperfed in great Numbers, from marching into the
Weft to help on the Deftruftion of the Beafl. The
feventh and laft Vial is poured into the Air, and de-
notes the clearing of all places from the Darknefe and
Fog ofSuperftition and Antichriftianilm : after which
will be manifeft th* Myftery of God in reuniting all
Nations, and the Kingdoms of this World will be-
come the Kingdom of Righteoufheis.
I have already oblerved, that the precife time when
all thefe mighty Revolutions will happen is doubtful;
however there is no doubt but we are arrived near to
the time of their Manifeftation ; and when the Scene
of Affairs both in Afia and Europe will be very much
changed : Of this we are affured from computation
of Scripture Prophecy, and the concurrent Teftimonies
of the Sybils, and other Heathen Oracles 5 As alfo
from lucn certain outward and vifible Signs which we
know were nearly to preceed that great Day. I will
tell you very clearly, lays the Sybiline Oracles, the
Signs whereby you may know when will be the End
of all thefe things that lhall happen on the Earth,
viz. when (the likends of) Swords lhall be feen in
the Heavens towards Sun-letting or Sun-riling, And
the Prophet Joel fays, ch. ii.ver. 50. the Lord will
ihew wonders in the Heavens, Blood and Fire and
Pillars of Smoke 5
every Body knows, that upon the
firft Appearance of the Northern Lights, they were
by all forts 9f People compared to 6words, Lances,
and other Military Weapons, or elfe to Blood, Fire,
and Wllars of Smoke, in the very Expreflions of the
Prophet 3oel: And indeed they moft certainly do
greatly reiemble all thefe things $ and in fait are Fires
and Pilhrs of Smoke or Vapour, which do frequently
in
Moore, 1750T 11
in their Colour rcprefent Blood ; and by their Form
and Motion, Swords, Lances, and other Military En-
figns : But thefe Appearances (as alfo Comets) you will
fay, may be accounted for from natural Caufes;
low'd they may fo, yet as their Appearances are fb
univcrfal and uncommon (except of late YearsJ and
are exaftly luch as we fee were to happen fbme fhort
time before the commencement of theft extraordinary
Revolutions, preparatory to the Millennium, we may
and ought to look upon them as ominous, and fent in
a peculiar and wonderful manner, to pr efage the
approach of thofe wonderful and tremendious Times;
Let us then, not be ignorant of the Signs of the Times,
butlook fuddenly for that great and fearful Earth-
quake mentioned in the Revelations, for it wiil come
and cannot be afar off} But I fear it is with us, as with
the Jews, when our Saviour came into the World ; or
with the Christians, when Antichrift ftept upon the
Stage; Chrift was both come and gone before the
Jews knew that he was the Meffias : and Antichrift
was grown old in the World, before the World took
any notice of him 5 fo it may be that Antichrift is
going apace to Perdition, before the People of God
begin to difcern it.
Obfervatims of the Four Quarters of the Tear.
I. Of the Winter Quarter.
THIS Quarter begins on Sunday\ the 10th Daj of
D$ambir) at 3 in the Afternoon; at which
time we have 1 7 deg. of H Afcends, and 12 deg. of S3
on the Medium Cell ; the J is in the beginning of n
departing from the cf of "f?, and applying to the of
<y : Mercury is in / m to <f in X. This is a fickly
Face of the Heavens, and it will be well if the Seeds
of fbme Peftilential Diftemper be not now Sown. It
alfo denotes fbme new and unheard of Mifchiefs in
divers parts of the World ; Murmurings5
Tumults,
Riots, Infurre&ions, and malicious Projects, are al-
moft univerfal, more particularly in the North and
Eaftern parts of the World, where Men of the moll
malicious and corrupt Minds are very active,

II. Of the Spring Quarter.
THIS Quarter begins on Friday the 9th Day of
Mtrcb, at 5 in the livening, when 21 deg of
IJJ£ Afcends, and 17 deg. of n Culminates. The D
is in the 12th Houie in 5 deg. of TR in Q to 1}, and<f>
of $ . According to the Rules of the Ancient Fathers
of this Science, Mercury mult be admitted Lord of
this Ingrels, he having moil Dignities in the place of
the Moon, the Afibendant, and tne Mid-heaven $ $ we
know is Uke a Weather- Cock, ever changeable $ itiil
conforming his Influence to that of the Planet he is
moil: attacii'd to ; Simply coniider'd, he ftirs up Craft,
Deceit, Frauds, Fa&ions, Piots and Conspiracies
but we mui* always regard g according to his Pofition
and mixture of Kays with me other Planets : Here
we find him in the tfth Houie in oppofition to the j)
in the 12th, and in Q to T?, weak and debilitated;
Mercury in his own Simple Nature i$ malevolent, as I
before obferved $ And by being thus pofited and afpect-
ed he becomes much more fo, and will more powerfully
diffufe his poiibnous Atoms among Mortals, in great
Loffes
Moare, i75<% 13
Lofles, Irfipri&nments, decay of Trade, and Mortality
among all forts of Cattle : Thefe Calamities will be
principally felt in the South and Eaftern parts of the
Worlds the BrfriJfotfkiiCm have reafon to hone for
better things 5 Jupiter in d with the (%) and §>, and
all ofthem in the Sign T. Ergland's Alcendant fhews
great Felicity, Succcis, and a growing Glorv to attend
this happy Iiland: The King will adminifter Juftice
and be had in great Honour, the People will thrive by
Trade and Husbandry, and the Nation in general bs
in a profperous and happy Condition
Saturn entered into the Sign / about the beginning
of the Year*, he is now Retrograde, and towards the
end of this Month meets with the oppofite Ray af £
juft as he enters the Sign Jfm This is generally looked
upon as a very malignant and powerful AfpeH $ and '
we find it often attended with great Changes of Em-
pire and Dominion in the World, and enrnent D £
penfations of Gpd's Providence with regard to Reli-
gion and Religious Worfnip: We may reasonably
expect about this time a vifible Retrogradation in the
Affairs of fever al Popiffi Nations in Europe, the
Heavens are averfe to all their Tyrannical, Antichrifti-
an, and opprdUve Schemes: The Spanjh Nation, that
great Prop and Support of Papal Power and Super-
iHtion is eminently concern d, fome great Changes
feems to approach them ap^e; the Princes and Pow-
ers in Italy are in the utr oft Confufion and Diilrels,
and they will find nom to relieve them 5 there are
other places alio in the South and Eaftern parts ofthe
World, which will feel the f vere and heavy Hand of
Divine Providence : The Turks are very Active, it is
fome Northern Powers that carry their Fate in their
Banners, and it feefhs not far off WT
e know that the
Turk and Pope appeared in the World in their Bloody
Colours at the fame time, and no Wonder if their
Power and Dominion be fuppreffed nearly at the lime
time alfo.
There feems t® be fuch & concurrence of Caufes and
Predictions to center in thele Times»j:kat it looks
very much like the approach of thofe Days before
fpoken off out of Divine Writ $ to thofc before men-
tioned
14 Moore, 1750.
tioned I will only add part of a Prophecy as it is giv-
en us by the Author of the Turkifb Spy 1 who lays,
That he met with a Perfbn at Jftracan, called the Tra-
veling Jew, who pofitively aflerted in the open Streets,
that after the Year 1700. the Turks /hall overflow
Chriflendom like a mighty Torrent 5 when there will
be great Defolation in Hungary% Germany, France, and
other Regions in the Weft 5 but above all others, Italy
will be made a perfeft Wildernefs; That England
fhall become the Refuge ofall that efcape the Calami-
ties overwhelming the adjacent Countries 5 and there
(he fays) they willbe fhewn a new pattern ofthe Law
of Jefus, or rather the old and true one freed from the
Corruptions and Errors which have been fuperinduced
for many Ages, when the Jews will be convinced of
their Infidelity, and chale away Darknefs and Super-
ftition from the Earth : In thoie Days (fays this Jew)
foreign Princes fhall fend their Ambaffadors to the
King of Great-Britain for Holy and Pious Teachers to
inllruft them 5
Mighty Armies fhall be raifed in the
North, which fhall be joyned by a prodigious Army
coliefted in other parts of Chriftendom ; which fhall
drive out the Turks, recover from thefan the Holy Land;
and glorioufly rebuild the City ofJerufalem 5 and make
a worthy and excdlexitEnglifbtnan Patriarch ofthefame :
Then (hall the Eyes ofus Jews (fays he) be opened, and
we fhall all acknowledge Jefus to be the true Meffias.
III. Of the Summer Quarter.
THIS Quarter begins on Sunday the i#tb Day of
yune% very near 4 in the Afternoon, when 1 z
deg. of % Afcends, and 27 deg. of Si is on the Mid-
heaven : The 1) is in 22 deg. of Yp in the 3d Houfe, de-
parting from the <P of g and g , applying to the j(r
of ^, and 1
of V. To fay the truth, this is none of
the beft Pofitions $ there ftill feems to be fbme Roguery
in hand, Mars and Mercury can never be conjoyn'd
in Cancer, but they will ftir up Mifchiefs to Mankind;
in Italy and the Northern parts of the World it fhews
Fighting, Plundering, and the utter Ruin of many.
The Mean federating from their oppofition, and ap-
plying to thetSquareof Jupjter in Aries, adds violence
to their Effeds, and ihews great troubles to happen by
reafon
Moore, 17^0. ,
5
reafon of Oppreffion and T5'ranny, and great Lofles
by reafon ot ludden Invafions, and the Death and
Deftrudiion of great Cattle : And indeed here ieenis
to be a great Storm arifing, for % where gand $ have
taken up their Refidence is the Dignities of V, and in
i
Dorpus Religionis. Mercury as I have before obferved,
1
is ever conforming his Note to the Planet he is in Com-
!
pany with, which here is Mars 5 and they oppofed by
the J and fquared by if their .Diipofitors ; what can
we expeft trom fuch Pofitions as theft are, but ra/h
and perverfe Couniels, turbulent and daring Actions,
and all upon a Religious pretence ? Religion is the
Cloak, but Villany the Defign. I hope no more Popilh
Maffacries, tho' it looks too much like it.

his own Dignities, feperating from the Sextile of y in

; J
of the Alcendant. Under the Influence of the laft
Quarter, Ibme Seditious and Tyrannical Spirits began
'\
jto difturb the Peace ofthe Church, and of Mankind in
general : And of this we may be affured, that wherever
11
Komi/h Priefts prefide in the Courts and Counfels of
Princes, they will ever be promoting their Pomp,
^ Grandeur, and Worldly Intereft, and that too under
» the (pecious name and pretence of Religion, But the
i Stars now promile better things, and mew the con-
It' ditionof the People in ieveral Countries to be much
t better than it hath been for ibme time paft. They
^ denote a Ceffation of Hoftilities, a mutual Harmony

n ccrn'd in luch Influence.
