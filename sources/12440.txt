  		              		Experience Description   

  My grandfather owned an old inn on the Ottawa River. My mother was 5 months pregnant at the time and sent me and my 4-year-old brother out to play in the snow. It was March and the snow was starting to melt but the river was still frozen over. She told us not to go down to the river. It's a very big yard so there was plenty of room to play and I believe she believed that we would listen to her. However, we saw the sailboats on the river and wanted to go look at them. So, we went to the river. 

I stepped on the ice first and then my brother stepped on the ice. Then the ice cracked and he got up on the bank but I went under the water. My brother screamed that I was in the river and my mom ran down but couldn't see me. So, she ran back and screamed up the stairs to wake her youngest brother to help and he came running down to the river. He saw my snowsuit and pulled me out of the water, laid me on the snow bank and tried to give me mouth to mouth. He eventually said I was gone but my mother insisted that I couldn't be. The ambulance came and took me to the hospital where I was in a coma and given a blood transfusion.

  I didn't have any recollection of the actual event. I only learned of it when I saw the scar on my ankle from the blood transfusion. I always had the sense that I was different and that people weren't being their true selves. I always felt the need to help others and was drawn to religion and dreamed of being a nun when I was young. One of the strongest guiding principles was that I felt a strong desire to do something that would help greater humanity. 

  There was always a lingering memory or presence of a memory that stayed with me but I was only able to describe it years later because I didn't attribute it to being near death because I didn't know that I had almost died. So, once the understanding of what happened to me became clearer the memory became clearer as well. 

I was not in my body but somewhere else. In a space that I can only describe as Heaven. Heaven was almost like being in the clouds but I wouldn't say it is this realm. It is another realm. There are not trees or earthly things, just space and it was sort of mystical. I was aware of the presence of someone with me. However, I couldn't see this person. Yet, he was all around me like surround sound and he could speak to me with his mind. We communicated telepathically. He showed me how wonderful life was and to not be afraid. Life is a miracle. He instilled in me an everlasting excitement for life and also gave me an understanding of how I can help others by sharing this excitement. This is all I remember. 

  Of course, it wasn't my time otherwise I wouldn't be here today. The doctors said it was the ice that saved me by slowing my heart rate down. It is a miracle that I'm alive as I'm sure I was under for a period of time that one normally wouldn't survive given how long it took between falling in the water and getting to the hospital. I'm so grateful to be alive and I try to share the excitement that I felt during my NDE with as many people as I can even if it's just through smiling and showing love.  

Background Information:       

Gender:   	Female  

Date NDE Occurred:   	 March, 1967  

NDE Elements:       

At the time of your experience, was there an associated life-threatening event?        Yes    Drowning       Other Coma and subsequent blood transfusion  I nearly drowned  

How do you consider the content of your experience?        Entirely pleasant  

Did you feel separated from your body?      No    I clearly left my body and existed outside it  

How did your highest level of consciousness and alertness during the experience compare to your normal everyday consciousness and alertness?        More consciousness and alertness than normal   As a baby, I have very few recollections from this age. I have a couple of memories but they are very vague. This memory is very vivid and I can remember everything about it.  

At what time during the experience were you at your highest level of consciousness and alertness?         When I was with the presence of God or a being that was like God  

Were your thoughts speeded up?         No  

Did time seem to speed up or slow down?         Everything seemed to be happening at once; or time stopped or lost all meaning     Time seemed to stop but not lose meaning because the meaning of life was being telepathically transcribed to me and on a cellular level  

Were your senses More vivid than usual?         Incredibly more vivid  

Please compare your vision during the experience to your everyday vision that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.       I could see and feel everything around me more vividly.. it was on a cellular level. Comparing that to a baby, my level of awareness in the earth realm was far more limited so I didn't have as much of a heightened awareness.  

Please compare your hearing during the experience to your everyday hearing that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.      I could hear what was being said to me telepathically or on a cellular level and compared to everyday this is very different since everyday hearing is done only through listening with the ears. Hearing in this dimension was done with the mind.  

Did you seem to be aware of things going on elsewhere, as if by ESP?       No  

Did you pass into or through a tunnel?         Uncertain     I don't recall a tunnel. I just remember being in the presence of this being and have no recollection of how I got there.  

Did you see any beings in your experience?         No  

Did you encounter or become aware of any deceased (or alive) beings?         No       

Did you see, or feel surrounded by, a brilliant light?         A light clearly of mystical or other-worldly origin  

Did you see an unearthly light?         Yes   There was a glow all around me in this dimension. It was like being on a cloud in another dimension with a glow all around me and an awareness of a presence of a very large being that felt like God or a heavenly father.  

Did you seem to enter some other, unearthly world?         A clearly mystical or unearthly realm     I was in a realm that was like the space of another realm, like in the clouds, like Heaven without trees or any earth like things  

What emotions did you feel during the experience?         Calmness and extreme joy and Happiness. I was overwhelmed with the joy of everlasting life which is essentially what I was being given or that is how it felt. This is something I had a need to share with humanity.  

Did you have a feeling of peace or pleasantness?         Incredible peace or pleasantness  

Did you have a feeling of joy?         Incredible joy  

Did you feel a sense of harmony or unity with the universe?       I felt united or one with the world  

Did you suddenly seem to understand everything?         Everything about the universe     I understood the meaning of life and that life never ends and there is great joy in life.. we are all one  

Did scenes from your past come back to you?         No       

Did scenes from the future come to you?         No       

Did you come to a border or point of no return?         No     

God, Spiritual and Religion:       

What was your religion prior to your experience?      Select   I was a baby so I was unaware of religion but my dad is High Anglican; my mother is Unitarian  

Have your religious practices changed since your experience?         Yes     I didn't start fulfilling what I felt was my destiny until my mid-thirties when I began to practice Taoism and follow my beliefs. This has led me to where I am today. I have completed my masters in medical qigong and am nearly completed my doctorate in the same, I have completed my acupuncture diploma and waiting for the results of my national exam, I have a certificate in tuina and I am a taoist priest and will go on to become a Taoist Abbott  

What is your religion now?         Other or several faiths   Taoism - I am a Medical Qigong Master and Doctor candidate, Acupuncture candidate, Tuina Therapist and Taoist Priest studying to be Taoist Abbott  

Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was both consistent and not consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience     I didn't have any beliefs since I was only 2 at the time.  

Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         Yes     I began to practice Taoism and follow my beliefs. This has led me to where I am today. I have completed my masters in medical qigong and am nearly completed my doctorate in the same, I have completed my acupuncture diploma and waiting for the results of my national exam, I have a certificate in tuina and I am a Taoist priest and will go on to become a Taoist Abbott

Did you see deceased or religious spirits?         No  

Did you encounter or become aware of any beings who previously lived on earth who are described by name in religions (for example: Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, etc.)?         No     

During your experience, did you gain information about premortal existence?         Uncertain     The implication behind the message would be that this is highly likely but this was not conveyed to me as far as I can recall. What was conveyed is that life is never ending which I can see is likely the same.  

During your experience, did you gain information about universal connection or oneness?         Yes     I had the sense that we are all one and that life is precious, to not destroy it. Love is the answer.  

During your experience, did you gain information about the existence of God?         Yes     I was in the presence of God or heavenly father or supreme being or source and this presence was speaking to my soul/mind with its soul/mind. I couldn't see the presence but I could see the presence on a telepathic level and feel the presence on a telepathic level. There is no doubt that this presence was there with me.  

Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:       

During your experience, did you gain special knowledge or information about your purpose?      Yes    I had the sense of a higher purpose. That I needed to guide others. To find a way to help humanity on a larger scale.  

During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?         Yes     That we are all one and that life is never ending. Life is a gift and to share this gift with others. Love is the answer.  

During your experience, did you gain information about an afterlife?         An afterlife definitely exists     Yes     I had the awareness that life is continuous and never ending - it's a continuum and an awareness of 'life after death'  

Did you gain information about how to live our lives?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about life's difficulties, challenges and hardships?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about love?         Yes     That we are all one and that life is never ending. Life is a gift and to share this gift with others. Love is the answer.  

What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         Large changes in my life     I didn't start fulfilling what I felt was my destiny until my mid-thirties when I began to practice Taoism and follow my beliefs. This has led me to where I am today. I have completed my masters in medical qigong and am nearly completed my doctorate in the same, I have completed my acupuncture diploma and waiting for the results of my national exam, I have a certificate in tuina and I am a Taoist priest and will go on to become a taoist abbott  

Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          Yes If this had not happened I would possibly have chosen a different career path and hold different beliefs. People would have seen me more as main stream and not so different.  

After the NDE:       

Was the experience difficult to express in words?        Yes   I can express it but it's difficult to capture the fullness of the experience. It was much larger than you or me - not just the presence of this being but also the dimension that I was in especially since I was a baby experiencing it. However even though I was a baby, I still understood what I was being told though this was being accomplished mind to mind through telepathy.  

How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  I remember this experience vividly. I can remember how it felt to be in this realm and to be in the presence of this being. I can remember how it felt to be communicated with in the way we were communicating. I remember the message at a cellular core level. Compared to earthly memories which were few I remember all of this experience and my earthly memories I only remember fragments of.  

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         Yes     I was always intuitive but I found that after practicing medical qigong, and channeling and mediumship that I am clairvoyant, clairaudient and clairsenscient.  

Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          Being in the presence of God was a wonderful experience - pure love - and the message he wanted me to convey to others in the physical realm was profound.  

Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    I began telling my mother about the experience in my late 30's and early 40's. My mother had a lot of guilt from the experience so she had a hard time talking about it. I think she thought I blamed her for it. I didn't blame anyone for this experience. It's not in my nature. My brother was only 4 and my mother made a mistake. She wouldn't have done something like this purposely. However, I was never able to fully convey this to my mother. I tried to explain to her that I had an NDE and how wonderful it was but it was never something she wanted to discuss. Before she died and I finished my masters of medical qigong and began to study acupuncture and was already studying to be a Taoist priest. She beamed with pride and said to me "I always knew you were special". I really felt that at that moment she got what I was trying to tell her all those years. I didn't really talk about it with others much and when I did it was only with those close to me and not in great detail like this. This is the first time I've really been able to fully put it into words.  

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       No     

What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real     It was years after it happened since I was only a baby at the time. However, when I realized what happened I knew the experience was real.  

What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real     The experience is definitely real. I remember it vividly. I can feel the presence of the being still to this day. There is no doubt in my mind this happened.  

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       No     

Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?         No  

Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?         Not at this time thank you.
