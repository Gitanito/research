  		              		Experience Description   

    I found myself walking down a hallway with a male figure who was much taller than my 6'2&quot; self. I never saw the man's face, but I remember him asking me, 'Are you ready? Are you on board?' I always answered the same way, 'Yes, I'm ready. I'm on board.'   As we walked side-by-side toward a bright light at the end of the hallway, there were many people walking the other way.  None of these people made eye contact or spoke, but they seemed to be walking in a very determined manner away from the light. I never got to the end of the hallway, so I don't know what was beyond the light.  This went on for over 8 days of a 10-day stay in the hospital.    

     I do not remember the ride to the hospital or the first 7 1/2 days.  The first conversation I recall was with a doctor who came into my room when the nurse saw that I was awake.  I remember the doctor smiling and saying, 'You had us worried for a few days there.'
  
Since that time, I am constantly seeing small shadowy figures in my peripheral vision  that seem to vanish when I turn my head.  

Background Information:       

Gender:   	Male  

Date NDE Occurred:   	 4/2018  

NDE Elements:       

  At the time of your experience, was there an associated life-threatening event?        Uncertain   Illness Surgery-related.        Life threatening event, but not clinical death.  I was in and out of consciousness  over a period of 8 days of a 10-day hospital stay  

How do you consider the content of your experience?        Both pleasant AND distressing  

Did you feel separated from your body?      No    

  How did your highest level of consciousness and alertness during the experience compare to your normal everyday consciousness and alertness?        More consciousness and alertness than normal.   I seemed to be focused on his words and the light because nothing else mattered.  

  At what time during the experience were you at your highest level of consciousness and alertness?         When the man was asking me if I was ready and  on board, as we walked toward the light.  

Were your thoughts speeded up?         No  

  Did time seem to speed up or slow down?         Time seemed to go faster or slower than usual.     Everything seemed to be slower  

Were your senses More vivid than usual?         More vivid than usual  

  Please compare your vision during the experience to your everyday vision that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.       I knew I was walking down a hallway and could see the light at the end.  I was never able to see the man's face or get a clear image of the people walking the other way.  

Please compare your hearing during the experience to your everyday hearing that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.      The only thing I remember hearing was his voice.  

Did you seem to be aware of things going on elsewhere, as if by ESP?       No  

  Did you pass into or through a tunnel?         Uncertain     The hallway could be considered a tunnel?  

Did you see any beings in your experience?         I sensed their presence  

  Did you encounter or become aware of any deceased (or alive) beings?         Yes     I'm not sure if any were deceased or alive.  One man was walking with me and a large number of people were going the other way down the hall.  They were walking away from the light.  

Did you see, or feel surrounded by, a brilliant light?         An unusually bright light  

Did you see an unearthly light?         Yes   The bright light at the end of the hallway  

  Did you seem to enter some other, unearthly world?         Some unfamiliar and strange place.     That would be the hall.  There was something about it that made me a bit uneasy, along with the bright light at the end of the hall.  

What emotions did you feel during the experience?         Just a profound need to let him know that 'I was ready and that I was on board'  

Did you have a feeling of peace or pleasantness?         Relief or calmness  

Did you have a feeling of joy?         No  

Did you feel a sense of harmony or unity with the universe?       I felt united or one with the world  

  Did you suddenly seem to understand everything?         Everything about myself or others.     As long as I responded with 'I'm ready. I'm on board.'  all was good.  I do remember being slow to answer him and he seemed like he wasn't happy that I didn't respond right away.  

Did scenes from your past come back to you?         No       

Did scenes from the future come to you?         No       

  Did you come to a border or point of no return?         I came to a definite conscious decision to return to life.   Maybe not so much a return to life but he stopped asking me. I stopped responding and it was during those times that we didn't seem to be walking toward the light.  

God, Spiritual and Religion:       

  What was your religion prior to your experience?      No comment.   I have attended services at a number of denominations in my life.  

  Have your religious practices changed since your experience?         Not really changed. They were always there, now I just had a stronger feeling about my spiritual beliefs.

What is your religion now?         No comment     

  Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was both consistent and not consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience.     I've heard of people seeing bright lights, but I always associated that with tragic near-death experiences.    

  Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         Yes     I was always interested in stories about people who saw 'lights' but sort of looked at the situation with a raised brow.  After what happened to me, I know there is something there.  

  Did you seem to encounter a mystical being or presence, or hear an unidentifiable voice?         I encountered a definite being, or a voice clearly of mystical or unearthly origin.   I encountered the man that walked along side me. He didn't walk ahead or behind me. Yet, I could never see his face  

Did you see deceased or religious spirits?         I sensed their presence  

Did you encounter or become aware of any beings who previously lived on earth who are described by name in religions (for example: Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, etc.)?         No     

During your experience, did you gain information about premortal existence?         No       

  During your experience, did you gain information about universal connection or oneness?         Yes     There was definitely something about the light that was causing all those people to be so determined to walk away from it. But,  I was being drawn toward it.  

  During your experience, did you gain information about the existence of God?         Yes     I don't think the person I was walking with was God, but I got the impression they were on speaking terms.  

Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:       

During your experience, did you gain special knowledge or information about your purpose?      No     

During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?         No       

  During your experience, did you gain information about an afterlife?         An afterlife definitely exists.          I got the impression that 'Being ready and on board' was how I needed to be to get to the light and the next journey.  

Did you gain information about how to live our lives?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about life's difficulties, challenges and hardships?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about love?         No       

  What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         Moderate changes in my life.     I seem to be at peace with where I am and where I'm going to end up, whereever that is on the other side of the light.  

Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          No 

After the NDE:       

Was the experience difficult to express in words?        No     

  How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience as accurately as other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.To this day it is still as clear in my mind as it was when it happened.  

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         No       

  Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          Just the fact that I felt the need to 'be ready and on board.'  When I say 'On board'  I took it then,  as I do now, to mean am I on board with the program or am I on the team?   

  Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes.    I shared the  first day out of the hospital.  Some looked at me skeptically or in disbelief, but I think I'm taken a bit more serious about it now that I have repeated the exact same thing since it happened.  

  Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       Uncertain   I'd heard of them and was interested, but didn't think it would happen to me.  

  What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real.     I believe that that light is the key to our final destination.  

  What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real.     

Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?         Yes  

  Did the questions asked and information that you provided accurately and comprehensively describe your experience?         Uncertain.     I'm still curious about the shadowy things I see daily
