 The journal advertised in The Temple, December 1897, that it would have contributions from "the Best Known Writers" on Science, Philosophy, Religion, Psychology, Metaphysics, and Occultism.  By 1904 its advertisement in The Craftsman proclaimed it "the world’s largest and most important periodical dealing with contemporary research and progress in Philosophy, Religion, Psychology and Metaphysics.  Mind is the acknowledged leader . . . of the great New Thought Movement, which is characteristic of our times . . . ." The journal was the most prominent and influential representative of the more erudite and polished version of New Thought propagated in the eastern United States, and largely ignored the more flamboyant New Thought that developed further west -- though these more magical exponents of New Thought found a place in the journal's advertisements.  Patterson (1854-1917) was a Canadian who founded the Metaphysical Alliance in Hartford, Connecticut, and then moved to New York in 1893 where he started Alliance Publishing.  McLean (1865- ), another Canadian and a crank economist and socialist, was hired away from the Metaphysical Magazine to edit Mind and then took over the editorship of the Arena when Alliance bought it in September 1899.   Alliance, in 1900, also founded The Alliance School of Applied Metaphysics in New York which taught New Thought by mail or personal instruction through the efforts of Patterson, Richard Ingalese, Helen Van-Anderson and Paul Tyner.  Notable contributions to the journal by James R. Phelps, the direct initiator of R. Swinburne Clymer in the Rosicrucians, on the necessity of sex and the role of women in occultism; Countess Ella Norriakow (later McLean's wife); W.J. Colville; Evelyn Arthur See (before he was jailed for corrupting young girls); C, Staniland Wake: Swami Sardananda; Lucinda B. Chandler; Virchand R.
