 This was the organ of the Theosophical Society (Adyar) in Argentina.  It was said to have had a circulation of 1,500 copies.  The starting year for the journal (1940) is derived from the volume numbering (vol. 5) of the July-September 1944 issue, but that issue is called no. 10, which indicates that the publication was irregular.  That issue is important because it celebrated the 25th anniversary (1919-1944) of the Argentine Section of the Theosophical Society and gives a lengthy exposition of the progress of Theosophy in the country and short biographies of leading Argentine and Spanish-speaking Theosophists like Alejandro Sorondo and Mario Roso de Luna.  The history totally ignores the bringing of Theosophy to Argentina by Alberto de Sarak, Count de Das, who had twice been expelled from the Theosophical Society in Europe and had fled to South America one step ahead of criminal charges in Spain and Belgium  His wife Antonia Martinez Royo was the first president of the Luz branch of the Theosophical Society, the first branch in the country, founded in January 1893.  Several online authors have attempted to set out the Theosophical journals in Argentina chronologically, and the lists, while not totally accurate or complete, are helpful in understanding the scope and complexity of Theosophy in Argentina:
