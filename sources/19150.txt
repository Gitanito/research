I&#39;m Richard Doty I was assigned as a
special agent with Air Force Office of
Special Investigations at Kirtland Air
Force Base I was a counterintelligence
officer at the base and one of my Jobs
was to conduct counterintelligence
operations at the base and during my
time there my first few months there I
was briefed into a special access
program involving the US government&#39;s
investigation in contacts with
extraterrestrial the visitation of these
extraterrestrials to to earth and the
Air Force is an involvement with these
with these extraterrestrials and during
this time I conducted investigations
regarding not not just the UFO phenomena
but my primary mission I probably 60% of
my time was Delta that Delton to
investigating the UFO sightings and any
threats and posed by these
extraterrestrials on Air Force or
airforce related property right what
year did you first get into the problem
I was writing a product just into the
project in the summer of 1979 and and
and the briefing was it was a special
access program I have a special security
clearance to have access to it and it
was brief I was briefed into it by an
Air Force colonel from Washington who
came down and briefed myself and a
couple other people into this program
yet the the it was the the initial how
do I say this because there&#39;s still some
classifications involved in this I think
so
it was the codename that I was briefed
into it was Yankee black but that was
the program&#39;s briefing wasn&#39;t
necessarily the UFOs program
was just how it was a security actually
a security code for an access program
Yankee White was access to the White
House and Yankee black was the access
that you would have to have to get into
this program around in this program
right and what what were you told during
this briefing and do you recall the
Colonel&#39;s name
I&#39;ll leave the Colonel&#39;s name out of it
but the the briefing started with a
history us us his involvement with the
this extraterrestrial in it and it
started out with a crash at Roswell but
actually what the crash didn&#39;t actually
happen in Roswell happened closer to
Corona New Mexico a south southeast
southwest of Corona New Mexico and a
second crash site that occurred in
Magdalena or a horse Mesa west of
Magdalena New Mexico which wasn&#39;t
located at the same time the Roswell
crash was in 47 the crash in Magdalena
wasn&#39;t located until about 49 did they
share with you what they found they
showed us a the movie it actually showed
us this belief a 16-millimeter movie on
their recovery and the narrator of the
movie it would obviously the movie was
classified how the classified their
narrator in the movie detailed when the
crash occurred approximately when the
crash occurred in in in the latter part
of June of 1947 and and and the recovery
showing military personnel through a
recovery site disk recovering the bodies
at the site and the craft that was at
that site and one live extraterrestrial
was was found at the site and and we
were told that the extraterrestrial went
to Kirtland Field Kirtland Air Force
Base
at that time and then on to Los Alamos
for some time and it didn&#39;t explain
fully in the movie exactly what happened
to that that extraterrestrial though it
did explain that I died in about believe
I was 1952 but the the bodies of the the
extraterrestrials that were found at the
scene were in a deep freeze placed in a
deep freeze and sent to wright-patt
field in Dayton Ohio the craft is wasn&#39;t
it was it more or less an over
egg-shaped craft and wasn&#39;t a saucer
shaped the creatures were about four
foot some of the creatures were mangled
were heavily injured and their bodies
were torn apart but two of the bodies
were pretty much intact and and I&#39;m not
sure how why if there was an autopsy
they didn&#39;t discuss that but the
creatures were approximately four foot
they had didn&#39;t appear to have any years
they had an indentation for nose very
very big eyes they had a really tight
fitting suit almost looked like they
were nude but they actually had a very
thin but tight fitting suit on the the
fingers had no thumbs just four four
fingers suction devices under tips of
their fingers and and one of them had a
head apparatus on on it maybe maybe a
helmet or some kind of a year phone or
some some type of device that was they
were communicating with with the craft
or with with something else and they
found a number of different objects in
the craft that they used they
experimented with and found they had a
piece of they thought with Plexiglas it
was a Scorpio rectangle piece of plexi
that they had they kept for years before
they figured out it wasn&#39;t the energy
device for the craft and then they
showed us the recovery of the craft in
1949 in hoarse Mesa and that craft had
crashed at the same time the 47 craft
crashed but because of the remoteness of
that location
it wasn&#39;t detected until a rancher found
it on his property in 49 and they did a
recovery a project on that craft but the
bodies were were decayed and there
wasn&#39;t much left of the body but the
craft was the same type of craft that
was found near Corona there&#39;s an
oval-shaped craft and but it had damage
to it just like the one at Corona did
and I think they their opinion of the
scientists were the two crafts crashed
for some reason which was never
explained no I think nobody has it right
one of the things one of the things that
is quite disgusting if you for the
people who have ever been briefed in
this program is there&#39;s not much out
there that&#39;s actual factual the UFO
community dissin forms themselves they
provide that people go out there write
books and without any facts 90% of
everybody that writes these books these
authors had never been in the military
never but worked for the intelligence
community never had a security clearance
and they&#39;re just relying on second third
and fourth hand information to write a
book and then port basically poisons the
their readers and the rest of the UFO
community and so the 40 the the July
craft actually it crashed in in the end
of June the recovery project was into
into July because it was at the end of
June and
and people just didn&#39;t get it right and
your folk community didn&#39;t get it right
now there&#39;s some people out there that
that have tried to present the facts but
they&#39;ve been ridiculed and and and and
and and and so their information is not
being believed but just like the horse
Mesa crash in 49 very few people have
that fat factual they think it was an
entirely different crap that the craft
was exactly the same as the corona craft
exactly the same and the damages that
they showed in this in this movie they
showed scratch sketches of the crafts
together at some location and it
appeared if anybody would a logical mind
can see that these crafts crashed
together why they crafted and crashed I
I believe the the the even they called
it the the this particular entity that
lived and even he probably explained but
I was never briefed into exactly what he
how he explained that the two crafts
crashed it was a I know it was a
lightning storm it was a it was a storm
and in that time period where when it
was crash and working when they craft
crashed but the the two crashes have
been separated by some people and then
discounted by others within the UFO
community and that&#39;s what is so
disgusting
and troubling within the UFO community
that&#39;s why I have nothing to do with him
anymore
I&#39;ve tried after I&#39;ve went to UFO
conventions and tried to explain what
what the truth is and nobody wants to
hear you because they&#39;ve written a book
that says it happened this way and not
going to listen to you even though they
might know it really don&#39;t know the
truth exactly so did the craft can you
describe the actual craft moored edition
of it to give me any detail of the
census yeah yeah it&#39;s a it was about 35
foot in diameter of across I mean
35 by I think 42 or something like that
the interior craft was it didn&#39;t have
any actual levers or flight control
systems that we would identify as a
flight control system or avionics that
we would identify as flight avionics at
totally unknown devices in the craft
steering mechanisms but they eventually
I think over some time figured it out
and it was done all by hands the
creatures would put their hands on
controls and they&#39;d have this headset on
and this headset would somehow control
or help him control the aircraft and the
avionics were very very sophisticated
avionics that it took us years I think
to figure it out and I was never briefed
into that so I can&#39;t I can&#39;t talk I
don&#39;t know anything about what they
figured out but they took the craft to
wright-patterson and at the time in the
late 40s that was probably the best
place to understand or try to figure out
they had the best scientists there to
figure out how these crafts flew glass
or translucent some sort of translucent
object did you ever get how that worked
I was not directly briefed in but as
some time in my career I read a document
in Washington that explained the u.s.
designers or your scientists as
understanding what this was was an
energy device that that used a
zero-point energy that&#39;s what they
referred it to a zero-point energy and
it was connected in such a manner that
this device could power I mean from a
very small flashlight or various
watch up to a city and and the power was
determined by what the demand on it was
and so each craft had one of these the
crap the the craft had crashed in in
Magdalena or in Moore&#39;s Mesa out west
had a larger energy device than the one
found in Corona and they don&#39;t I don&#39;t
think they could understand why but they
operated in the same manner okay and did
they figure out how to apply that into
other research projects did you find out
if this was then studied and put into
experimental US prototypes
I was never briefed in in that program
I&#39;m sure they did but I can&#39;t I can&#39;t
talk about that because I I could only
talk about what I&#39;ve done and what I&#39;ve
seen yeah I was never breached into that
so after this brief it was anything else
in the briefing the briefing pertained
to the threat posed the the threat that
was imposed by extraterrestrial crafts
and the and then also briefed on some
other alien crafts that had visited
earth there was four types of crafts
that they showed us fork types of
extraterrestrials and they never
explained to us where they got the
pictures of these extraterrestrials but
we act there were actually pictures of
these weird-looking creatures that
showed on the film that we&#39;re
extraterrestrial from some other
location different from where the evens
came from one was looking like an insect
had huge high eyes very large head a
small body they had two different
appendages under their arms that
basically two hands on each arm and they
had several joints in there and their
legs and they had a bubble type of pen
each in the front and
and a lump or something in the back and
that was one of them and the other one
was they were about they were about the
size of a huge room up five probably
between five foot and six foot tall and
the second one was a very tall thin very
very thin humanoid that had long arms
the arms reached down probably to the to
its knees or halfway between their their
their hips and their feet they had
regular hands their faces were very very
thin there were almost human looking
unless you really really steady them
we&#39;ve got real close to him and and his
sermon they weren&#39;t humans I mean you
couldn&#39;t identify them as human ears
they didn&#39;t have any hair they had a
cat-like eyes they&#39;re at their their
irises were different than that of a
human
almost cat-like and then there was a
third creature that was a I was I found
this out later but at the time it they
just showed the creature and it it
looked something like the even but it
was bigger that it had a had a bigger
body and but but I found out later in a
briefing I had in 1985 that that was a
genetically engineered a creature that
the evens made and and that was a
briefing in 85
based on an investigation that we were
doing they knew it was genetically
engineered and I don&#39;t know how they
didn&#39;t ever tell that to tell us how but
they didn&#39;t read you into the neural
complex with integrated circuits no no
no were there any crafts associated with
these others yes yeah one was a
cigar-shaped craft one was excuse me a I
don&#39;t know I think it was like 60 or 70
feet long and 20 or 30 feet wide scar
shape second one was a regular saucer
shape but it was really really wide
almost look like a one of those
tops that the kids play with really
really widened and they were puzzled I
remember in the briefing and initial
briefing that Colonel said and we still
can&#39;t figure out how this thing flies so
they pictured it they took pictures of
it they&#39;ve sought and but I don&#39;t know
that they ever actually captured one at
least at that point I didn&#39;t know and
they never told us that and then there
was another craft it was very very small
it was about the size of a Volkswagen
and but it was I mean a saucer shape but
it was I mean it excuse me oval shape
almost like the even but a lot smaller
it was almost like it was a one-seater
that one seater type of maybe a
observation or a reconnaissance craft
and that&#39;s the only craft that I that
they briefed us that there was in a
presentation yeah they had photos own
actually in the film they showed photos
in the film of these creatures I mean of
these crafts and the film started you
could tell that the film was an old film
when it started maybe in the 50s or
early 50s or late 40s didn&#39;t have a date
on it but then as a film when I as the
briefing went on it got more modern I
mean the information and it became more
modern and you could see based on what
was shown in the movie that it was a the
information was was a more current than
the first part of the film was and the
pictures of these crafts that we saw in
a latter part and this that the crafts
were in the latter part of the film was
something that I&#39;ve seen since on TV on
the History Channel that that&#39;s that
other people have taken like the
McMinnville craft one of the crafts in
there looked just exactly like if you&#39;re
familiar with an evening yeah I think
that was a 51 or 50 or something but
back in the 50s did the colonel or
during this briefing and subsequent
brief
did they ever explain to you what the
perceived threat was that they were
concerned about yes the threat to number
one the first perceived threat was what
were they after what was it at a
reconnaissance with these a
reconnaissance flight where they were
gonna recon before an invasion it was
were they going to land and and take
over some particular facility for their
own purpose were they short of minerals
because a lot of a lot of what we were
told it towards the end of the film was
that a lot of these crafts later on were
seen over uranium mines and in other
mining areas and so they&#39;re concerned
what are they after they after uranium
or turn into plutonium or or what
exactly what they were after and so our
job was to investigate you know if
determined was there a was there a
threat and and if there was a threat
reported up the chain of command and and
hope it wasn&#39;t it sounds like from their
technologies they&#39;ve gone a little bit
past nuclear power but was there any
sense that the the advent of all these
these occurrences had to do with the
fact that we had developed atomic
weapons was Roswell of course had the
atomic bomb squad burned only one in the
world at the time and this facility here
and uranium mines and etc the colonel
dietrichson as you know is one of the
disclosure project said that every
single one of our facilities had had
reconnaissance was that discussed well
they they inferred it that the that they
were concerned because whether would
Colonel put it and I think this was some
of his own feelings at the time when he
when he talked to us later was that you
know we just had a we just had a drop
two bombs nuclear weapons on a country
we had a test of that bomb a few months
earlier a few weeks earlier in New
Mexico
and this probably was observed by these
aliens somewhere whether they were doing
career connaissance back then or how
they have figured it out so they came
here to observe and try to figure out
what the heck was that and maybe they
didn&#39;t have a weapon like that and maybe
they did and maybe they concerned about
this earth for some particular reason
and or maybe they were after those
weapons and and that was a concern
because security of nuclear weapons was
a number-one priority of the United
States Air Force because they Air Force
had a lot of nuclear weapons one of the
primary missions for the OSI was protect
a counterintelligence operations against
the threat of nuclear weapons and and
Kirtland Air Force Base had a lot of
nuclear weapons in New Mexico hand at
the time like you said the 509 following
it Roswell had the only nuclear capable
strike force in the United States at
that time that&#39;s right so their
subsequent briefings but from the 79 and
80 what when we when we were
investigating something we then asked
for a briefing on it because we didn&#39;t
get everything we were we were we were
given enough to conduct an investigation
have some historical knowledge and while
we were investigating but then when we
we in in 81 I believe it was 1981 there
was a a scientist who died a scientist
Air Force scientists who passed away and
he had a a an ol army footlocker full of
autopsy photographs and these autopsy
photographs were of of the creatures
that died at in the corona crash and so
we went out to recover all this stuff
and I looked at these things and it
didn&#39;t look like humans to me I you know
I looked at this and these were actual
as you being a doctor you understand
autopsy photographs and they were you
know still photographs of autopsies
but they had organs out and and I had a
little bit of medical knowledge not a
whole lot but I had a little bit of
medical knowledge and looked at this and
I said it doesn&#39;t look like a heart or
doesn&#39;t look like a lung but what we
found out was and true that these evens
had just one organ that was made up of
the heart and lungs it was just one
organ and they had a couple different
stomachs for different digestive reasons
and they had a organ --it that would
take every single bit of moisture out of
it whatever they ate and and and and fed
the body so they didn&#39;t really have to
drink a lot of fluids and when when I
found all this stuff I took it in I
immediately classified it I asked for a
briefing what is this is this human or
not well they on the bottom of each
photograph there was a case number and a
date and the dates were in in the 40s at
47 it was I think there was September
something in 47 and the case wasn&#39;t a
case number that I recognized so then I
asked and eventually I got a briefing by
a scientist was a medical doctor he was
out he was from the Armed Forces
Institute of Pathology in Washington DC
he came out and myself and the other
agents that were involved in this he
briefed us he gave us basically anatomy
101 of an extraterrestrial and he said
yeah in fact these are the but autopsy
photographs from Crona yeah the brain
yeah the brain has it had I don&#39;t I
don&#39;t remember how many lobes of human
brains have but they had 11 different
lobes of their brain and they had where
they their spinal cord met the brain it
was had a two little bulbs on each side
which they could never figure out what
they were
it wasn&#39;t like ours
and and their eyes were very
sophisticated they had they had the
optic nerves but the optic nerve Scott
went into different places in the brain
almost as if the brain was operating
their eyes were operating at different
parts of the brain for some reason they
they didn&#39;t know I wasn&#39;t briefed on
anything like that I don&#39;t none of them
were females so they they they I think
they even even once told him that there
were females but there wasn&#39;t any
females on any of these crafts either
all males yeah they did they had a
reproductive gland because they didn&#39;t
call it a penis they call it a
reproductive gland it was in the body
and I guess at the time of you know it
came out that&#39;s what they figured their
muscles were extremely fibrous and
remember that especially little leg
muscles
they weren&#39;t bulky but they were strong
they were fiber which I guess gave him
more strength and what are muscles they
didn&#39;t have years but they had a canal
with a with a an organ or gland I can
think they call it a little bulb that
that they think was what they they could
hear out of but they didn&#39;t have vocal
cords like we had their vocal cord they
didn&#39;t have any so this another thing
that was bred in and the briefing was
very fascinating to me when this
creature was found he couldn&#39;t
communicate other than hand signals so
when he was taken in to Los Alamos to a
medical facility at Los Alamos and
examined of course it that the
physicians didn&#39;t know what they were
examining they figured out they
eventually were able to communicate
through sign language and eventually
somehow somebody figured out how to do
an operation on the vocal cord or or
insert something in there so it could
talk
it could sue could make sounds and and
and I don&#39;t know how that I don&#39;t know
how they did that living et share how
they communicate with each other through
I guess well I wasn&#39;t directly ever
briefed on that but I found out some
some years later that they did it to
telepathy telepathically
were there any humans yes there was a
the handler this the eben a lot lived
they even won he had an Air Force
captain that was assigned to him and the
captain was a linguist spoke I don&#39;t
know how many different languages but he
was also intelligence officer and he was
able to build a really good rapport with
it they even and was able to communicate
far more communications than anyone else
could
and he actually lived with this even for
I think the three or four years until it
died DIA Defense Intelligence Agency was
intimately involved in it everything
that we sent up ended up everything we
sent up through OSI the quarters when
the DIA and there was a guy by the name
and Tom Mac Tom Mac was a project
manager for in dia for for this project
the project&#39;s had various names and some
some of the names are just phonetic a
phonetic name like Quebec phonetic
alphabet military phonetic alphabet the
Q you would say if you were talking over
the radio callback queue for Quebec and
so we would use phone attic for a
particular operation with a
a district number one of our district
numbers and then a case a case a
progressive number we call it after that
so you might have a queue 17 which
district 17 was OSI at Kirtland and then
a number a progressive number for the
case number and but but if I if you went
to Pease Air Force Base I went up to
Pease Air Force Base and which is no
longer there but it&#39;s in northern New
York there&#39;s a sac base GG Caramanica
Base they had a very peculiar incident
happened up there of an UFO that was
flying around their nuclear weapons
storage area it actually landed and they
weapon had been taken apart it not the
warhead wasn&#39;t stolen but it somehow it
was taken apart and there was anybody in
this bunker to do that so they figured
out how the heck this happened so they
thought maybe it was a Russian operation
or something and so we went up there and
and during this briefing I mean during
this operation we found prints
fingerprints but they weren&#39;t like our
fingerprints they were very
strange-looking a prince
now if remember I told you about one of
the creatures had to his two hands I
want arm when appendage they it would
appear that something like that had
gotten in there somehow I got in it and
nobody could figure it out because a
very secure area you can figure a
nuclear weapon storage is very secure
but they had fingerprints so now we have
fingerprints and that was the first time
that we as a government and actually got
extra fingerprints that was in 84 was
1984 yeah it was a it was it was winter
times I don&#39;t remember ever was late
winter or early winter of because it was
snow on the ground course upstate New
York it&#39;s it&#39;s pretty bad but that I
thought that was fascinating but never
we never could figure out anything other
than that it got in
did the fingerprints now there were many
many many cases of extra UFOs spotted
around nuclear weapons facility launch
control facilities Ellsworth Air Force
Base
Malstrom Air Force Base an in sac basis
that had nuclear weapons works yes did
she scare command bases yeah yeah yeah I
read a report where almost virtually
everything was but some of them were
more intrusive than just the security
forces seeing something flying around
compared to its creatures she found
inside a an area and we had that at
Kirtland in 1980 where security police
at Manzano complex which was where the
nuclear weapons are stored saw these
strange lights out of Coyote Canyon
which was east of the of the complex the
nuclear weapons complex and something
landed and so I conducted that
investigation which was extensive
investigation which led into the Paul
bennewitz incident Paul bennewitz right
actually one of the security officers
from Sandia laboratories their own
security was checking it was driving
around on a graveyard shift at some time
after two o&#39;clock in the morning and saw
a craft land at a bunker but the the
bunker didn&#39;t have anything in it but
the craft landed and when it landed all
the electronics in that vehicle shut off
his engine shut off his portable radio
stopped transmitting his portable radio
in the vehicle stopped for as long as
that craft was on the ground
took off everything came back on and so
I investigated that all we found was
that something was landed there was on
base radar no radar the ice checked it
if the first thing I did was checked
with FAA and we had also at Kirtland we
had a at that point it was at that time
it was pretty a secretive unit that
scanned every single frequency that was
could possibly be generated in it around
the base radio frequencies and so I went
to them and I said hey did you guys pick
up any strange frequencies on this
particular time frame nope I said okay
went to FAA let me see your your
printouts for this night nothing so that
I thought well these guys making this up
or what well then a security police
inside
Manzano I interviewed them separately
and they told me the exact same story so
I thought it&#39;s - it&#39;s just makes too
much sense to be be a fantasy of hoaxing
so we investigated but we could never
find anything regarding that crap but
shortly after that major Ernie Edwards
who was the commander of the 16:08
security police squadron that the the
security Air Force security police had
guarded the Manzano came to me and said
I got a phone call from a guy by the
name of Paul bennewitz he lives right
outside the base it was in four Hills
which is a housing community just on the
other side of the base perimeter and he
told me he started he&#39;s seen all sorts
of strange lights around Manzano so I
said I&#39;m a strange and so I started
checking into it and we found out the
Paul bennewitz owned a business right
outside the main gate of Kirtland
Thunder scientific laboratories they
made humidity sensors for submarines so
he had a government contract any of
security clearance so I went and paid
him a visit
ask him about what he saw and he started
telling me all sorts of stories
what he saw and what he did and what he
thinks they are so we conduct an
investigation just to make sure this guy
wasn&#39;t a Russian spy he wasn&#39;t you know
doing all these things his house was
literally just a few feet from the base
perimeter
I mean his backyard bucked right up to
the base perimeter and he had all this
sophisticated now he was a sight he was
a physicist you know the sophisticated
equipment on his patio his up her
bedroom patio that was pointed towards
the base and that&#39;s what we were
concerned about so we conducted an
investigation on him not only us but
National Security Agency because he
actually tapped in and this was
classified at one time I believe it is
class anymore classified anymore he was
tapped in to a National Security Agency
in NSA project that was going on on base
and which he shouldn&#39;t have been able to
figure it out but he did very smart guy
so we had to figure out how we&#39;re going
to get him away from what he was doing
and so we started slowly convinced him
or not really convincing him but just
give me the idea that this might be just
UFOs extraterrestrials and he ran with
that and I know I had a lot of criticism
about that I fed him all this
disinformation and I made him go crazy
but Paul thought a lot of this up on his
own I didn&#39;t have to it wasn&#39;t it very
difficult for me to convince him what he
was seeing he just he just told me it&#39;s
UFOs years later I became friends with
him years later after I got a hope he&#39;s
still owned I tried to explain to him
that what he saw wasn&#39;t but he would
never believe me
he eventually went crazy and and he died
some some years later but some of what
he was saying was he took pictures of
strange-looking
lights in orbs and in fact I sat and not
just me Jerry Miller who was a he had
been a project Bluebook investigator
some years before and he was
he was in the intelligence staff at
Kirtland not with OA side but with
another agency him and I sat in a room
probably not any bigger than s with
really tall ceilings and and Paul was
sitting and and we just had dinner and
we came in and we had some coffee and
the lights were down in fact none of the
ceiling lights are on
we had just some table lights on and we
were talking whistles it was eight or
nine o&#39;clock at night in a winter night
and he says he was explaining to us what
he was seeing all sudden we see this orb
up in the corner of his room and I
looked at it and I watched it nobody
else saw it at first and I kind of
elbowed it was three of us sir it was me
Jerry and and another agent my name is
Steve Adsit and I hit and and and and
Jerry looked up and he said and we
didn&#39;t say anything to Paul and I start
flying around a room and then of course
Paul saw he said well there it is we
looked around like what the heck is this
thing you know and I so we watched it
for maybe 20 seconds and it disappeared
and went right back to that spot well
Jerry thought that it was created by
Paul and and and Jerry confronted him he
said Paul what did you just do Paul says
no I didn&#39;t do anything he said can I
look it can I check things out yeah go
ahead
well Jerry look da Jerry&#39;s a scientist
too he looked all over went up to his
room looked all couldn&#39;t find anything
that could have generated something like
this it was a ball of light with like
little sparklers around it and he says
that&#39;s the aliens that&#39;s their that&#39;s
their reconnaissance that&#39;s how they
keep an eye on me and a few weeks later
we were in his house without him being
there now a lot of people are saying we
broke in we shrimp dishes entry he gave
me the key Paul gave me the key told me
to keep my eye on if you ever want to go
in there here&#39;s the key so we didn&#39;t get
any search warrant or anything but we
went in there
and we saw a real small or not the same
size we saw really real small or that
burned a hole through do it sealing a
being through his walk from one room to
another and when we came back a couple
of weeks later we told him about it and
that burn hole is still there so at
first we thought Paul was just
hallucinating
you know but the more I looked into this
there was something to this they were at
they were he was actually photographing
extraterrestrials not so many not so
much of a creature or but but of their
their reconnaissance or or their small
orbs that they used to to conduct
experiments on humans and he had I don&#39;t
remember how many but he had a whole
group of pictures that he had I told him
the next time you take any pictures with
you
he had a cannon thirty five-millimeter
one of those well at that time it was
knew he had a cannon 35 millimeter and I
told him I said if you ever take any
pictures of UFOs don&#39;t develop and let
us do it and he said okay so he calls me
one day he&#39;s got a whole roll of 32 or
three whatever mean amenities in him one
of those rolls of photographs of these
of these UFOs that I took over at the
base so when I picked him up to come
over to our secure photo lab gave them
to our secure developers that he
developed these and I stayed there
watching wait wait I said I wanted some
some 3 by 5&#39;s and you know eight by tens
and whatever you so you know how our
leader however long it took he comes out
with him he says what the hell are these
things and they&#39;re oval-shaped graphs
flying above planes that were landing at
now Kirtland Air Force Base shares a
field with Albuquerque International
Airport
so planes coming in these these things
will fly right over top of them and then
very often
he&#39;s more like orcs were they stress
know there were structured there was
structured and there were I can&#39;t
remember how many photographs there were
but there were they were structured
photo there was structured crafts and we
hadn&#39;t blown up I mean these the photo
guys could do a lot we hadn&#39;t blown up I
mean we&#39;re by these crafts were about as
big as the the corona crafts and they
were exactly
oh absolutely details struts the the the
bottom of it where there was one
particular one and Eva color photographs
showing a blue trail coming on at the
bottom of the craft which is probably
energy device and we set them all up to
headquarters and I don&#39;t know whatever
they were seamless yeah seamless no
aisle photographs he never did any
videos no no he didn&#39;t do a video but we
had a video made a video that was
brought to us at the base of this guy
who was lived in Placitas north of
Albuquerque lived in the mountains he
was retired Air Force please it was a
pilot and he had a video camera setting
up and he was watching animals he lived
in a remote area dear and and I would
come up to his back area and he was he
was pretty much filming I he was a
wildlife amateur photographer but one
day one night he heard a noise went out
and his craft hovering right over his
backyard and he took a video of that was
about 28 seconds or something like that
before the craft took off and that is
the only video of a legitimate video we
took the video of the camera and
everything because you always want to
analyze all this stuff together and we
set up the headquarters they say him a
check back to pay for that camera
because they were gonna give him that
camera
back and then we&#39;re gonna give him he
wanted copies of that but he never got
that back they classified it whatever
happened to the stuff we sent up oh I
had quarters oh yeah Air Force offices
us investigation at that at that time it
was at Bolling Air Force Base
headquarters of bowling we sent it to
headquarters Ivo II which is see the
counterintelligence location and then
they they would send it over to NSA and
the only reason I know that was years
later after I retired I was
I&#39;m joined a pretty closely net group of
former and retired intelligence officers
and we get together every year
I haven&#39;t attended every single year but
out of 25 years I probably 10 to 20 of
these reunions or get-togethers and
normally they&#39;re after or before the the
UFO conventions at Laughlin well used to
be lawfully now it&#39;s at in Arizona and
we&#39;d sit down and talk
we just said I want to talk about in a
secure kind of a semi secure place and
talk about what we know and that&#39;s
that&#39;s why I learned a lot from them
because they were briefed in programs I
wasn&#39;t bro bro briefed into and one of
the invest in tellers just officers was
from NSA and when I first met him and
probably 94 95 and I never met him
before I didn&#39;t know him before he said
I always wanted to meet you because you
and I were on a case same case together
I said what case he said Paul bennewitz
ice what do you mean Paul bennewitz he
says yeah we interviewed him too so they
were investigating and we were
investigating and we didn&#39;t know who
they were investigating one particular
night at Paul bennewitz the south so it
was rainy night winter kind of fall I
was there and Jerry Miller was there and
Paul was showing us different things and
Paul came to mean he said you see that
house across the street the front of
this house I said yeah he said you see
those lights in that upstairs window I
say
yeah he says they&#39;re not supposed to be
there what do you mean he said the house
is vacant
I said mm-hmm I said I wonder who&#39;s over
there so light you know I got a gun and
so I go down and I i snooped around and
I see the two vehicles parked hidden in
the back yard ones actually in a yard so
I get the license numbers off these
vehicles and the next I you know I
didn&#39;t want to go in I figured well
maybe they&#39;re buying the house or
whatever so the next day I ran the
plates they come back to a rental
company out of Hertz I think it was out
of Denver and they were running on a
government credit card so I thought okay
now but now go ahead and I don&#39;t know a
week or two weeks later we were there at
the same time and we see these lights
well these lights are you can tell
camera lights the old red red lights
coming out seeing that there&#39;s cameras
pointed over here I said I&#39;m gonna get
them this time so I call Albuquerque
Police contacts I had tell him what I
had somebody come over there and they
come over and we confront these two guys
and they were they they had to tell us
that they were special agents and they
had they rented this place that&#39;s about
all they said said so I knew no they
didn&#39;t and they a PD was a house off
base I didn&#39;t have much the jurisdiction
there so I booked her police department
had to and I was just relying on them
the ID them it was confirmed that they
rented a place that was left at that but
this H as I met years later told me he
said we investigated that one we
investigated the abduction up at
Springer we I didn&#39;t know this so NSA
was intimately involved in this stuff to
dia of course CIA we have quite a few
members of
of our group from the CIA they weren&#39;t
they didn&#39;t do any field work because
the CIA couldn&#39;t do that but they were
relied on a lot of information that we
were feeding them and they were doing
analytical studies of of what they had
and and but but in the FBI course was
involved in it well the only they had
they found a a box a cylinder I should
say not a box a cylinder on the eben
craft that had been analyzed at various
locations and Sandia had it and in 1984
84 President Reagan came to Sandia and
was going to be specifically briefed on
this and I happen to be part of the
security detail that and I was in the
room when they was explaining this this
to him and this cylinder had and they
had a I don&#39;t know a electron microscope
view of it or how are they are again
they figured out how to x-ray tour
whatever they did to it but they had
cutouts of it and a presentation on the
an overhead projector and they were
explaining to the president what this
what they thought these things did what
this and it was a multi-purpose avionics
thing device that was also a navigation
device for them and and so that&#39;s really
the only technology that I&#39;ve ever
learned or heard it Sandia was i I was
told one of one of our members of our
former intelligence group was a Secret
Service agent he was a Secret Service
agent for some years and anyone over to
the CIA and he he told us that
one of the most fascinating things about
Reagan was he believed and he was
briefed he didn&#39;t see it or know it but
he knew of others Secret Service agents
that told him that when he took office
on January whenever it was yeah xx or
whatever of 81 he immediately asked for
a briefing before the Iran you know we
still had hostages in Iran before the
Iranian he even addressed that issue he
says I want to be briefed on everything
we have on UFOs he sat a no office and
said that and they said yes mr.
president we&#39;ll do that so he he knew he
was never there one knew where he was
briefed but he knew of it I went to
Washington to get a a war award for
something I did which is still called
somewhat classified and I met the
president I never talked to him about
this subject but he knew something
because he said to me I know you work on
some very interesting things out there
he that&#39;s all I said and even we didn&#39;t
go and I didn&#39;t have a whole lot of time
word of officer sure you know maybe two
minutes or five minutes whatever it was
and he gave me something he gave me
president of cufflinks but just and I
knew they he I knew what he was talking
about he never actually said anything
but I I knew that he knew which was nice
because you recognized you know you
think well you know what you&#39;re doing
what I&#39;m doing out there is been briefed
away out there was a UFO covered up
cover-up life that was aired in October
of 1988 I don&#39;t remember what channel
but and a year before in August of 87
myself dr. kik green doctor helped put
off Ernie Keller Straus Karl Dale
several of us and and Robert Collins
went to Dayton Ohio and had a meeting in
a room and this producer who produced
the UFO cover-up while I was there
and he wanted to interview us all and
most of most of them said no I said well
what do you want to talk about he said I
want to talk about you know this UFO
thing I said I won&#39;t do it on camera
well we sat down in a room you know room
in a hotel room to do the interview he
interviewed me what he gave me but he
gave me a list of questions first and he
said read the questions you have any
problems any of those questions I said
no I don&#39;t have any problems with it
well yeah I actually there were a few
that I said I can&#39;t talk about this in
business he&#39;s three or four anyways he
interviews me
there was one cameraman and him and he
said he would turn the camera off and
say can you can you actually elaborate
more okay what he was trying to do was
tell me what to say and I told him right
away I&#39;m not gonna do play your games
I&#39;m gonna tell you what I know what I
did I&#39;m not gonna tell you about
anything else I&#39;m not gonna tell you
anything classified I&#39;m gonna tell you
about the Kirtland incident and about
what I saw but that&#39;s it so he put me on
back and maybe another five minutes
wasn&#39;t much more than that and he
started that again I said you know what
I&#39;m terminating this and I walked out of
room now on you awful life they have
somebody that they claim to be me and
the beginning of it the first probably
30 seconds is in fact me and you blacked
out but everything else was ducked in
somebody else was talking before me and
that really upset me and of course then
they say well you were live you were
there live impossible I was going to the
State Police Academy in Santa Fe during
that time period I started at State
Police Academy and in 1st of August
didn&#39;t graduate until December on that
particular night I was isolated inside
that that dormitory and that and not not
even enabled watched the let alone being
on it so that was all hoax that was all
made up and who dubbed for me I think it
was Robert Collins to tell you the truth
but and almost almost positive that was
him and and by the way Robert Collins
and I are not friends at all
absolutely not friends he published a
book in 2006 with my name on it that I
had absolutely no input into that book
so so people who say well you wrote you
wrote it but I didn&#39;t write any book I
gave him information to put it in the
book about 20% of what I gave him went
into the book and the rest of it never
went into the book in that book right
now I can see I mean I will I&#39;ll swear
to it that there&#39;s probably about 20%
that are factual in that book and
there&#39;s probably 40 or 50 percents of
speculation and then there&#39;s the rest of
it is absolutely a lies they&#39;re hoaxes I
spent a number of assignments to Nevada
and I know that they were reverse
engineering I was never actually briefed
on it but you know common sense can tell
me that this craft over here isn&#39;t
something we made or it&#39;s it&#39;s based on
something they designed the only
exception to that is a cash Landrum
incident in 1980 I know for a fact I was
involved in that I know for a fact that
that craft was piloted by Air Force four
pilots it was based on a
extraterrestrial craft that we&#39;d had and
it was reverse engineered but the the
propulsion system failed as a
malfunction in some manner spurring a
spring out of radioactivity and and I
know that for a fact but that&#39;s the only
that&#39;s the only reverse engineering
other than the cylinder that at Sandia I
understand that that was reversed
engineered into the into the 117 I was
at the Nevada Test Site which is now the
national security net Nevada and I
secure to say what you call area 51
which was at that time debt three test
center it&#39;s area 51 but without that
when I was out there in the eighties
is called depth retest Center out of
Edwards there was a detachment of a test
personnel from Edwards Air Force Base
assigned to area 51 and you know area 51
is just a plot on the map based on a
Nevada Test Site all the different areas
within that so by every causing room
light complex sir actually there&#39;s two
different locations out there there&#39;s
the test site there the debt-free site
and then there&#39;s groom Lake that&#39;s two
different sites people are sometimes
confusing it think it is the same and
then Papoose is an auxilary site that
actually has the underground entrance
absolutely I&#39;ve been through the whole
whole site yep I spent nine months out
there as a counterintelligence officer
I&#39;d we had a facility at the area 51
that would blind we would shoot a laser
up and blind the Soviet satellites as
they came over blind their cameras so
they couldn&#39;t photograph anything and
not only did we blind the Russians we
were blind anybody else&#39;s satellites
that would come over so it&#39;s very
difficult to get actually photographs
during that time period of area 51 and
now I don&#39;t know that they have that out
there anymore I you know I&#39;ve been a god
for a long time 80 81 81 85 I saw one
what I would prefer I nobody actually
told me it was an anti-gravity craft but
the way it was operating and their way
was it could lift up by itself
we&#39;ve watched it it had to be you know I
don&#39;t know what what else I&#39;m not a
technical guy but I could I could look
at it and just common sense tells me
this thing was anti-gravity no but I
think the crap that crap
it was an actually alien craft I don&#39;t
think that was a reverse-engineered
there&#39;s two different complexes out
there there&#39;s one that I believe Lazar
was talking about with with the alien
crafts and then there&#39;s an entirely
different area for the reverse
engineering car they&#39;re not together at
all they&#39;re not in the same hangar
they&#39;re not next to each other they&#39;re
they&#39;re in a different locations the
underground crafts the underground
facility housed the extraterrestrial
craft the above-ground facilities and
the far end of the complex how&#39;s that
reversed engineered aircraft they had
the bodies of all sorts of different cut
ties that crafts that they were
manufactured testing that he put
together and try to fly it had a lot of
crashes out there a lot of these things
didn&#39;t work but but but but they had
those but but I know I read a book where
it says everything was in one hangar and
ever that&#39;s not true they&#39;re all
separated and they had different people
it was compartmented they had people
over here dealing with those
extraterrestrial crafts and had people
over there that were dealing with the
reverse engineering craft now the
material the information came through a
third party a bunch of people scientists
here who would feed it out there those
people didn&#39;t have access to their
famine they didn&#39;t have access to the
other one yes I saw to the one that
defied gravity which I no one ever told
me it was a it was a it was a oval shape
wasn&#39;t very big it was probably 10 feet
by 20 feet it wasn&#39;t very big I had I
think legs their landing gear that we
had put on it because they didn&#39;t fit
the the structure of that craft and it
had these portholes that were almost
fluid like you look at it and it looked
like you&#39;re looking through water if you
know what I&#39;m talking about
and I never saw the inside of it but but
I only saw the outside and I saw another
craft a huge craft that was in the
Pampas Papoose complex when you first go
down into it the first Bay area on the
right hand side huge craft probably 100
foot by under fire I was never told what
that was but it looks like an older
craft that had crashed and because there
was damage on it but the the the skin of
it and everything looked strange didn&#39;t
look like something we would we would
have built that was the only the only
ones that I can I never saw any I saw a
supposedly a closed-circuit camera I was
sitting in a building and it was a
closed-circuit camera filming one in
another facility but I never actually
saw one face-to-face the contractors
East systems Johnson systems Sandia
Livermore Los Alamos Tektronix was out
there GE Motorola Motorola had a huge
facility of where they were trying to
check on their communications how other
communications worked
yeah easy communication swings those are
the ones I can remember yeah in GG ran
the place in and and gene Laskowski was
the security chief for EG&amp;G
and he always calls himself the security
officer for but he wasn&#39;t the security
officer I always let him say that but he
wasn&#39;t really a security officer but he
was their security officer and he was
briefed into a lot of things he was he
knew a lot as Paul McGovern I know if
you know Paul McGovern but Paul McGovern
was the the site security chief for area
51 for him from 70
I think 77 to 91 he&#39;s bet he was here
the whole time he&#39;s retired now this is
in Washington at Landover Maryland nine
over there Minh I think I gave his name
to somebody
I gave their names to try to contact him
he might talk in 80 in 1980 I was at
wright-patt for a briefing on something
entirely different but while I was there
asked to be briefed on something that
was related to this and I was taken over
to a facility an underground facility
you know you walk down steps a ramp and
a huge underground facility although I
didn&#39;t actually see it I was told later
not by Collins but by another person
Ernie Keller Strauss that they had alien
bodies down there no I never saw when I
was there and I was only there once at
their right path down in that facility
so what Collins talked about those
tunnel complexes they probably are real
I mean they probably had had tunnels
down there and and and I was told that
in fact I read something in a classified
manual once a few years later about it
about them yeah underground facility
yeah you go in Papoose you go down the
ramp it&#39;s a circular now I actually like
a horseshoe and then and and there&#39;s
there&#39;s branches off each one of those
certain areas it goes all the way around
to the to the main control Minh area of
of area 51 and it comes out on the the
southeast corner of air the southwest
user southwest corner of area 51 near
hangar 7 it comes out of there and but
along the way there&#39;s elevators and
there&#39;s compartmented shafts that if you
don&#39;t have the right badge you can&#39;t and
they&#39;re all Exchange badge systems that
you can&#39;t get in some of these you get
into certain ones like I was saying
before
if you&#39;re working on the alien craft
you&#39;re not gonna be able to work you&#39;re
not gonna be working on the other craft
so yeah yeah the man-made question have
you been exposed or did you come across
and in your career and your network the
false imw or the deceptive indication
and warnings projects relate to this yes
and what did you find out about this
that&#39;s pretty Klatt that&#39;s pretty much
that&#39;s I don&#39;t think I should talk about
that yeah let me that&#39;s right when i
briefed that is yeah that&#39;s very
sensitive yeah it&#39;s very sensitive yeah
yeah so let&#39;s just pass that question
huh
the Soviets were just as curious about
the phenomena as we were and that one of
the one of the essential yeah and we
call me a sensual elements of
information which you ask a spy some
things that the government says you have
to ask these spies to get this
information one of the first things that
the Soviets will if I&#39;m trying to
recruit you and you&#39;re in the Air Force
or the military is what does the
government know about UFOs I want to
know we want to know
KGB wants to know and that&#39;s something
that&#39;s that&#39;s fascinating him and so
when we recruit a Russian we ask them
the same thing and then they tell us oh
yeah KGB knows this and so that&#39;s that&#39;s
something that is it was fascinating to
me that the Russians were just as
interested as we were and probably just
as involved I was involved with the
Germans on the subject when I was
stationed in Germany the the BND the the
German equivalent to the CIA indeed but
bundes not question is what they call
but only one particular incident that
happened in around a nuclear weapon
storage area where something entered it
cut a fence got in didn&#39;t actually get
into a bunker and that&#39;s something that
we briefed and but we can ever could
never connect it although there was a
sighting of a UFO over it but we could
never connect him now is the only
interface I had with Germans well I
think the most convincing case that I&#39;ve
ever even been involved with has never
ever been made public and that was the
incident up in Utah some years ago there
was a there was a guy that lived in a
remote trailer just outside Dugway
proving grounds and he was a
photographer he&#39;d worked as a he was in
the Army as a photographer and he
retired from the army and he and he went
to work for you know I&#39;m sorry he didn&#39;t
retire from the army he just got out of
the army and he worked for Dugway
proving grounds as a photographer he was
never married he was an orphan he lived
by himself in this single-wide probably
14 foot by 80 foot trailer he had built
some sheds and stuff around it
OSI at Hill Air Force Base called me and
said we got this guy in that lives in
this remote area of like Dugway that
sent us all these photographs of UFOs he
said and we don&#39;t really have anybody up
here that&#39;s this is like 84 latter part
84 first part 85 we don&#39;t have a bed up
here they couldn&#39;t really you know talk
to this guy intelligently could you come
up here because they didn&#39;t have a 9q
and iqs a--
is a side designation for somebody that
I that investigated these things so I
went up there I talked to my boss you
see I go up there or whatever you want
to do I went up there flew up we went
out and visited this guy
this guy was not a very intelligent
person he had a lot of common sense but
not well educated he only went to eighth
or ninth grade but there wasn&#39;t anything
he didn&#39;t know about cameras to take
pictures he learned this all on his own
I mean the army taught him but then he
for years at Dugway he took pictures of
things out there he showed us a book of
all these photographs and these and his
creatures and we were saying where did
you get these things from he said
they&#39;ve laying out here he said they
leaned out here I said well when he said
all they left a long time ago but
they&#39;ll and they come here and landed
for years I said so I asked him to tell
me the story and he tells me that in 68
the latter part of 68 he came home from
work as a the fall day he goes in makes
his meal and now sudden hear some noises
yes he has a cat that ran around crazy
and he goes outside he sees this craft
landing in his backyard and he went in
and got his camera of course being a
photographer when I wanted pictures and
creatures came out he took pictures of
the creatures and he has these pictures
there they looked they looked exactly
like the evens they were evens I mean
they never talked to him but he said
well they didn&#39;t talk to me with words
but he talked to me in my head he said I
could understand them that they were
having problems understanding me and he
gave him all these gifts that he had and
at first I thought this is a setup
honestly God when I got there I thought
this is this is too real to be it can&#39;t
be real and I tell the the the guy at
the OSI agent from Hill I said is this a
setup or something or this guy had movie
props her this isn&#39;t this and really
said why are you saying that I said
because it&#39;s just it looks too real to
be real he said no he said this I don&#39;t
know he said we&#39;ve never been out here
so he showed us everything and the the
the the contact lasted from about the
60s
60s until about 75 or 76 and then they
told him they were leaving and they gave
him these gifts and they&#39;re star-shaped
there&#39;s some of them that were like
bronze statues and little models of
things and he said they gave me these
are gifts they gave to me I said one of
the questions I had why are you telling
us now after all these years you know
seven year or eight years whatever it
was why are you telling us now he says
I&#39;m dying this guy was a chain smoker I
bet you he smoked five packs of
cigarettes a day in an interview he
probably went through a carton and and
he said I&#39;m dying he said I&#39;m not gonna
live for another six six months but I
got to do something with all this stuff
he said and I figured it you might as
well have it they were forced might as
well have it so we sent the flag up and
then we got truckloads of people coming
down NSA CIA to review all this stuff we
actually had a big contract at a company
to come down with a moving van to move
all this stuff package it in a unique
manner because they don&#39;t know if this
stuff would is setting off a signal or I
never thought of that until one of the
technical people up Santa Fe or up the
headquarter said and Washington said you
know what these things might be buggin
bugged or something a radioactive or so
they anyway they took it all up the
headquarters and I don&#39;t know oh gosh
they&#39;re probably two dozen I don&#39;t know
exactly probably at least two dozen some
of them were just objects that you they
were made of I don&#39;t know what material
but you couldn&#39;t really figure out what
they were I mean obviously not something
that evens and because they gave him you
know two to him and thinking that it was
something meaningful and so they
packaged all that stuff up took the
headquarters and I never heard more
anything about it and I&#39;ve never read or
seen
anything on the internet about this case
now I think George Knapp has I think
somebody mentioned that the George Knapp
some years ago art bell sent me a letter
once some time ago and not a letter I&#39;m
sorry email and he asked me about the
Utah case and I&#39;m not sure what sending
backs in which do you a good talk case
and he never responded to me so I his
first name was James and he had a very
funny last name it&#39;s like a Polish name
sidarsky or is a drawer ski or something
like that he was a poor Polish origin
I knew that and but he he he was
originally from he grew up in a
orphanage in Northern California but his
I guess his mother and father came to
the west from they they immigrated
Poland to the United States and then he
went west to California and how does
somehow they died and he was three or
four years old one I don&#39;t remember how
old he was
some of them were shaped like a heart
a bronze heart with some calligraphy
inside of it and some of them were just
statues of almost like ceramics statues
of something maybe a god or something
you couldn&#39;t really explain there were
small some over this big some of them
are real big and and there was a another
one they they gave he had was a wreath
like almost like a wreath and there were
different symbols around this wreath and
in the back of it they had these
appendages that came out maybe to put it
on a stand or something
I
I could never figure it out I&#39;m sure and
I already saw them when the two times at
one time that he showed them all to us
and then when we came back to package
everything up to set him up so they were
mmm
CIA or dia or someplace be interesting
that I&#39;m sure they&#39;ve been analyzed as
well yeah oh yeah all of them were day
time that I can remember and they were
as as clear as you can ever and he was
he took pictures inside the craft these
are pictures in excited craft where they
showed instrument panels showed a screen
a huge screen with maybe the universe or
star charts or navigational charge or
something like that
and they they told him they had he had
us he had this chart and this is a we
were leaving the first time when he said
oh I forgot to show you this and he went
into it to a chest he had and and his
house was horribly maintaining else and
he finds this this it&#39;s like a it&#39;s hard
to explain it it&#39;s like a laminated
paper that has these lines through it
and if unfolded it and he said oh this
is where they came from
well there&#39;s no references on it so you
you know where where is this he doesn&#39;t
he didn&#39;t know he said but this is a
chart that gave me and that&#39;s the only
thing that we actually took back that
day with us and then we of course came
back later you got to get everything and
I don&#39;t know what they ever figured out
they don&#39;t ever tell us much after that
yeah it goes up and never comes down did
you ever hear where&#39;s all the UFO
which I discount but where some some of
these ET species were from what star
systems the only one that I know for a
fact that I read later was ready to
ready to Reticuli I don&#39;t know
Zeta Zeta Reticuli yeah I was a to
Reticuli yeah that was even yeah that
was a from official source now there&#39;s a
lot of people who went on our retirement
group a lot of speculation on different
star systems and clothes artists our
systems and things but officially that&#39;s
the only one I know the projects that
deal with ET simulations at what I&#39;m
referring to here there have been some
contacted that&#39;s when you&#39;re referring
to sources was actually not ET but was
if you will a staged event by military
or special operations to look et because
this woman had seen something classified
have you have you heard of those sort of
operations yeah but I&#39;m not sure if yeah
right I we did do that
yes OSI did that there was a special
group out of the 7600 second ear Intel
wing at Fort Belvoir they came out and
did that they had these people they had
maybe some sort of defects and
phenomenal defects that were brought
brought in to to fool people and
thinking they&#39;re aliens yeah I can&#39;t
give you any specifics because it&#39;s
still the program is still classified
and they probably still doing it I
wouldn&#39;t doubt done it they were still
doing it yeah there was a there was a
special a highly classified operation
that occurred in Tacoma Washington and
I&#39;m saying maybe 86 or 87 that was
exactly it was at the a naval base in in
Seattle I think was Whidbey Island Naval
Air Station I think
but anyways with Naval Air Station up
there where these civilians got onto the
base and and got into something and they
they they saw something they weren&#39;t
supposed to see and this group came out
and went into their home and scared the
Dickens out of him and exactly it&#39;s very
sensitive very sensitive yeah that and
some of the other things that we did in
recruiting people
we counter ins that one of the things
that you want to do to protect a base is
recruit people outside the base to
report into the base so when I was at
Kirtland we had that I didn&#39;t do this
but we had a whole group of what we call
them swindlers who could recruit anybody
and they went out and recruited
primarily pressed people because they&#39;re
the ones that gonna know first so every
news agency every television radio
station and the Albuquerque Santa Fe
area had our snitches in there so we
knew and we paid him we paid him good
money one of the good one of the reasons
you get two people did you pay him and
and that was controversial that was
somewhat controversial you know national
media oh yes yes
yeah I&#39;m not gonna name him but we had
one we had one out of or she she was
recruited out of a local station here in
Albuquerque and then she went on to a
national NBC and and she was still she
told us everything she was and we we
didn&#39;t handle or somebody closer to I
think she would say out of Washington
handled her but she was she would tell
us things that were going to happen and
yeah yes yeah and it wasn&#39;t just UFOs it
was anything that pertained to Air Force
or military or the security of a base or
spying or anything like that if they
heard something they thought would be
interesting that we needed to know
they&#39;d let us know and the other way
around that they would help yes yes yes
yep
yeah the high-level producers and
directors yeah and were they cash yeah
pay what you do is you make him sign a
form and you tell them you got to report
this IRS but whether they do it or not
you&#39;re not gonna give your form to IRS
but you but you&#39;re supposed to tell them
that there&#39;s a form that they sign and
you give him
I think it&#39;s anything over was
everything over $50 they had a sign for
we always had money we we needed to do
something we had money we had there was
different funding we call them funding
sites if you were if you were doing an
operation a counterintelligence
operation and you needed you know five
thousand dollars for this then they
would give us a number okay it&#39;s under
this site and somebody would deposit it
in a bank here and we would use that
money or they would give us voters or
something to that effect but there would
be different funding sources I&#39;m not
sure where they came from I&#39;m sure all
government funding someplace up there
the Congress appropriates the funds and
there&#39;s a lot of black projects and
black funding so I&#39;m sure we got a piece
of that so I was just going to ask you
about Bechtel corporation Bechtel was in
charge of security and operations at a
number of facilities including the
Nevada Test Site and one of their chief
security officers was a former colleague
of mine who worked at Kirtland with me
and Bechtel there was a lot of
experiments done in at the Nevada Test
Site which of course now the National
about a national security site regarding
you a full research of alien techni
reverse engineering well they were
trying to I think the Sandia Labs had a
project
had funding to delve into this
time-travel whether you could go back in
time or forward in time and they built
facilities out there to tests different
things huge magnets I think they one of
the underground underground magnets and
they were shooting lasers and things
through him trying to open up a fabric
of space in order to do try and try and
I was I watched a number of those things
I was briefed in a counterintelligence
project out there but I don&#39;t know
whatever the outcome of it was I don&#39;t
know what they ever figured it out or
not many experiments did you hear of
experiments dealing with so-called
teleportation or moving across space
that was part of of this this project
that they were doing out there they
would they would they actually I think
teleported something from one end of a
table to the other I think that&#39;s the
best they ever he did but and maybe
that&#39;s all I know maybe they did more
that I just wasn&#39;t aware of yes I did I
actually saw a craft flying above a
groom like that did things that you
couldn&#39;t do with a conventional aircraft
speeding going 1,400 miles an hour and
stopping and changing angles and then
going straight up and stopping and
coming back down and this was a big
aircraft this is this was one of these
these oval shape alien crafts that they
were testing out there and this is an 87
I don&#39;t you know you can look at it and
you could just tell but just a
conventionally you know it&#39;s common
sense tells you that how do they do this
stuff it can&#39;t be a conventional craft
they can&#39;t use conventional
means to do this has to be anti-gravity
or something because it would kill a
pilot I mean I should I had a pilot
standing next to me who had been air
a fighter pilot for years flew f-106 s
and he told me there&#39;s no way in a world
a pilot could have survived that the
g-force g-force is yeah and stopping
he said accelerating isn&#39;t bad but you
got to stop when you stop it&#39;s gonna
break your body&#39;s pieces so so that&#39;s
one of this weird things I saw that just
not explained him well I can&#39;t figure
out it I never saw lands I don&#39;t know
only the one the only the cash Landrum I
actually interviewed him there were four
of them I mean there&#39;s two it was too
far the two pilots there was a a systems
officer that was handling the equipment
and then there was a I can&#39;t remember
what the fourth person did he was a
navigator or what he was and I
interviewed them and everything that
could have gone wrong it took all fine
from Nevada and flew perfectly but when
they said it was it was going to an
airbase I can&#39;t remember which airbase
it was some some Air Base in Texas I
think it was Webb Air Force Base and Big
Springs I think it was yeah pretty sure
was Webb and when they tried to slow it
down that&#39;s when the problems over and
then they power and so many things went
wrong that they almost crashed they call
for rescue helicopters the DA thought
were to crash so these helicopters came
out but they finally got it going again
and they landed at some place apparently
was just past where they speared all
this radiation on those two port B or
three people or however many it were and
then they then they flew it back to
Nevada
it was pretty huge it was a one of those
big ones it was a it was not a saucer
shape there&#39;s more huge oval shape
and it was it was it was
reverse-engineered they trained nine
months before they ever flew it and then
they trained another I can&#39;t remember
how long four or five months flying it
all around Nevada and it worked fine but
the problem is it&#39;s a it&#39;s a reverse
engineered alien craft with it one of
our nuclear propulsion systems
well that wasn&#39;t refined because they
couldn&#39;t figure out how to reverse
engineer the aliens they they got it to
work at times but they couldn&#39;t
manipulate it the way they they needed
to for a human pilot to fly it so they
had to put one of our propulsion system
in it and you know that malfunctioned
and they trained and there wasn&#39;t any
any the pilot told me they were flying
and everything seemed they were flying
at a high like mm what altitude was
flying perfectly fine no problems
whatsoever until they slowed down he
said and then fell broke loose then the
system just malfunctioned and they had
this some something that was supposed to
throw thrust but the the thruster was
moving all around and and they had a
filter some kind of filter that was
filtering supposed to filter that didn&#39;t
work they didn&#39;t come down and it could
go Mach 1 and I that&#39;s all I was told I
mean maybe probably more than that but
just what he told me a pilot told me
when I interviewed him was he he had up
the Mach 1 this sounds like a hybrid
crap had some aspects of the yeah
yeah the body and everything was et the
only thing on this propulsion was our it
was us with American and and
conventional or actually uh nuclear and
it just didn&#39;t work in or for humans yet
for people for humans in it and none of
them suffered any radiation problems
it&#39;s just so support people on the
ground thank you you&#39;re welcome great
information
very well
you
