one of the discoveries that emerged out
of modern quantum theory is that
so-called empty space isn&#39;t really empty
at all it&#39;s actually full of energy so
instead of being like kind of a quiet
empty lake it&#39;s more like the froth of
the base of a waterfall or something and
this energy is basically electromagnetic
in nature and the energy density is
quite high in fact it&#39;s so high that
when it was first discovered
mathematically it was thought to be some
kind of artifact of the mathematics but
then as time went on there were even
Nobel prize-winning experiments that
showed that this energy and so-called
empty space was really there we don&#39;t
usually notice it because it&#39;s so
homogeneous ly distributed it sort of
you like sitting in a bathtub with at
exactly your body temperature you might
not notice notice the water but under
certain circumstances it can be
disturbed or perturbed and then it has
as effects as I mentioned some some
effects on atomic emission for example
is what eventually ended up in a Nobel
Prize for Willis lamb of Yale University
is called the lamb shift this is a
recognition that in fact this energy
disturbs atoms so atoms aren&#39;t sitting
in a void they&#39;re sitting in the sea of
energy so once a quantum theorists
realized that energy was there the next
question was well is there any way to
tap it and it was thought originally
that probably not it might be like
trying to tap the heat energy around us
and you can quickly prove for several
dynamic reasons that it&#39;ll take more
energy to tap it then you&#39;d get out of
it so that you don&#39;t come out ahead
but back in about 1984 researcher a huge
laboratory the name of Robert forward
showed that there was a particular
effect called the Casimir effect which
demonstrated that in fact this energy
could be 10
when you look at the numbers you find
out that there&#39;s enough energy and the
volume of a coffee cup to evaporate all
the world&#39;s oceans that you could get it
all of it
so this raised the issue among theorists
well can we manipulate this energy could
be a tap it for spaceflight application
for example and there couple ways to go
could we get propulsion out of it could
we use it as an energy source and so
these are the areas that modern
theorists are looking at but one of the
more interesting aspects is that if in
fact does look like there&#39;s a route from
here to there then you know we consider
the possibility that well maybe there
are other civilizations who&#39;ve been down
this track ahead of us and so it opens
up the possibility you can&#39;t reject the
possibility of for example et
visitations out of hand usually here we
constant said you can&#39;t go fast in speed
of light well that&#39;s something out of
special theory of relativity it really
is that you can&#39;t take an object and
speed it up and then through the light
barrier because it take an infinite
amount of energy mass to do it but it
turns out it&#39;s a faulty conclusion to
say therefore you can&#39;t go fast the
speed of light because once you get into
general relativity you have some options
the options are to change properties of
space itself so that locally the
velocity of light is engineered to be
faster than the usual value the best way
to explain how it is how it comes about
is that it&#39;s actually the idea of
stretching space expanding space on one
side of the craft and shrinking space on
the other so that you&#39;re not only moving
forward through space the space itself
is like moving forward on a rubber sheet
about the same time you&#39;re pulling the
rubber sheet and expanding it so then
relative to the outside environment you
can be going at say the speed of light
along the rubber sheet but the rubber
sheet itself is moving relative the rest
of the universe then your net motion is
faster than the speed of
so the implication then is well if you
can manipulate the zero point energy C
get it out of the way then something
tried to accelerate you it would be easy
you would have no quote inertia B you
know rather than using humongous amounts
of energy to try to propel you through
this tremendous force drag that you get
from the vacuum fluctuations you could
throw B B&#39;s out the back I suppose take
off like a shot and so in fact the air
force was sufficiently interested in
that that they set up a program called
mass modification in which I and my
colleagues were interviewed to find out
all the details of our modeling inertia
as a vacuum fluctuation phenomena that
might in principle be manipulated to see
if there was a possibility in some far
distant future of reducing the inertia
of a spaceship so that ordinary
propulsive means could be used with
relatively low energy requirements and
so they did a year-long study and went
around to various universities and
laboratories and asked people to tell
them about experiments they might be
able to do to determine whether our
model was correct so again there&#39;s
there&#39;s another indication that these
are not just fringe scientists with
science fiction ideas but basically
these are kind of mainstream ideas being
published in mainstream physics journals
and being taken seriously by mainstream
military and NASA type funders all
volume of space would be in a special
state so the pilots for example would
not feel inertial forces either and so
under those conditions of promoting
situation which you get rapid inertia of
a spaceship the people inside would do
the same space manipulating conditions
not feel tremendous
forces here at the Institute for
Advanced Studies one of our main
interests is exploring the possibility
of tapping or mining this vacuum
fluctuation energy zero-point energy
whether we call it zero point because
even if you froze the universe ground
all the way down to absolute zero where
most motion would be frozen out this
energy would still be there it&#39;s a very
fundamental kind of energy and but we&#39;re
looking to see if we can&#39;t extract it
for many uses not just base flight
application I mean the grand outcome
would be that if you could use it to
power everything from electric
toothbrushes to aircraft carriers to
automobiles to homes to to space flight
one of the main areas of interest
actually in terms of potential use that
we&#39;ve been approached by many people is
possibility of having a very cheap
energy source for desalinization which
is very hard to make antimatter in large
quantities and keep it bottled up but it
has been it has been done protons anti
protons have been generated and
accelerator experiments and then
captured and kept the contained for some
periods of time so that that&#39;s an area
that I know the Air Force&#39;s has been
interested in and pursues research on
you know sometime before this millennium
is out I&#39;m certain that probably that
will come to use if there aren&#39;t other
alternatives that that are simpler I
routinely make presentations and
briefings to various branches of the
government
I&#39;ve been taken out on aircraft carriers
by the Navy and shown what it is that we
have to replace if we have new energy
sources to provide new fuel methods of
course NASA is funding some of these
breakthrough propulsion physics ideas
the Air Force various labs in the Air
Force they&#39;re pursuing fundamental
Studies on these kind of exotic ideas so
so there&#39;s a lot of government interest
it&#39;s getting to the point where modern
theoretical physicists are loath to rule
out any possibility I mean now we&#39;re
talking about parallel universes and
membranes of many dimensions and I mean
the physics is is just getting as wild
as it can possibly be and sandwiched in
among all those alternative
possibilities is the possibility that
some of these concepts might actually
play a role in in Space Flight
application where civilizations
ourselves in the future or maybe more
advanced ety civilizations of present
could perhaps travel long distances in
relatively short times of course we see
claims and not just among the public but
among military pilots and good observers
typically in the military that there
appear to be something like craft flying
around with an almost behavior on the
other hand in terms of some of the
characteristics that seem to be
attributed to them and giving kind of
physics and the direction physics is
going I rule out that the baby maybe
some are are some kind of craft or
probes maybe even more likely probes and
from some faraway civilization of course
more the intriguing things as we start
looking into the possibility of reducing
inertia and so on and then you see these
supposed sightings in the sky which turn
on the dying right angle turn and so on
and the reason we used to reject those
out of hand
was that it appeared to be inertia and
until recently that sort of an
inconceivable idea to this so I think
this is probably pretty dusty
fascinating you know that doesn&#39;t sound
like anything imagine to be crap could
imagine to be some form of plasma from
our weather but not a craft so now as we
get this new evidence of okay maybe
inertia can be modified then it doesn&#39;t
make you sort of sit back and take a
second thought about it but when you
consider that the electromagnetic
technology is you know century-old
basically and then realize you could at
the van civilizations out there that are
millennia beyond us it really isn&#39;t a
way of saying whether they might have
some other way of making contact or find
other ways like wormholes of just
sending probes here or whatever could be
well beyond our imagination the case
that NORAD has uncorrelated parts they
can&#39;t account for and from time to time
satellites see things called fast
Walker&#39;s seem to be energetic signatures
moving faster than can be accounted for
by known planes for example people of
some credibility and credentialing are
willing to come forward say despite the
giggle factor for this area we think
there&#39;s something there that
take more seriously well it&#39;s another
mark that kind of an idea whose time is
competative seriously should not be an
area considered taboo by modern
scientists here you have a guy who shows
up before congressional committees doing
whistleblowing activities and under
circumstances were a lot of people if
they could find hold and his credibility
we&#39;ve been more than loud to try to
destroy his stories and credibility and
they didn&#39;t and so they suddenly have a
fellow like that coming forward and
saying that he has evidence from his own
experience that there was crash
retrievals and technologies that he
personally was involved in distributing
out why would a guy with that kind of
background make it up I had a chance to
ask him about it once and he said well
the way came out in the book is not
exactly when it was but it&#39;s really that
we waited until there were developments
in regular American industry and then we
would solve stuff and it might
accelerate those development it isn&#39;t
that dooms got started on the basis of
what we had because we didn&#39;t want
anybody know we had it you can&#39;t I&#39;ll be
just missed it out of hand because it&#39;s
hard to come up with a reason why he
would have just made it up because he&#39;s
a very sort of patriotic guy so yeah let
it really
this shows this shows the cutaway you
can see the the four ejection seats
actually there there are two facing us
but there are also two that are sort of
facing away from us on the other side of
that central column you can see the the
oxygen tanks down here in the corner
that that actually go all the way around
the inside of the skirt
