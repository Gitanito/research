I had come into work early feeling good. I developed a headache and went to medical for an aspirin. As soon as I entered medical, my chest had exploded with pain. The nurse put me in a chair and started putting aspirin down my throat, and then called for an ambulance. I remember being put in the ambulance and then a second ambulance came in and everyone was running around.

Then I was watching them from above. I was staring right in their faces and laughing. I could see them sweating and sticking me with a needle and yelling. I really couldn't hear because of the static-like sound.  I could see myself. It looked like my face had sagged and changed color. I began to yell at myself but nothing happened. Then I was free like a bird. I could see the guys I work with talking to the boss. Then I was where it was as bright as could be, not like the sun, but a white bright. It was cold, but not cold.  It was peaceful. I could hear this static get louder and could see grayish smoke like figures that seemed to pass through me. Then I could feel memories of people that I had known and memories. The static became louder and it felt like men who were waiting for something had touched me. 

Then I was being heated up with blankets and doctors checking me. I don't know what happened, all I know is that whatever it was - it was incredible.
