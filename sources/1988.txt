Its website can be viewed here. The AIPR is Australiaâ€™s oldest extant parapsychological research institute. The AIPR publishes a biannual (June/December) peer-reviewed journal, the Australian Journal of Parapsychology, with an accompanying newsletter, The AIPR News. The journal was first published in 2001.

The Journal publishes articles on extra-sensory perception (ESP), psychokinesis (PK), and life after death. Articles are generally accessible to the intelligent layperson. The Journal publishes papers on both experimental and theoretical topics.

As of 2016, just over half the articles across sixteen volumes (32 issues) have come from Australian researchers (56%), with close to half being authored by overseas researchers (44%) who hail from countries such as the USA, UK, Canada, Germany, Denmark, Spain, Argentina, Brazil, and Portugal. Some articles (5%) are the result of collaborations between Australian and overseas researchers.

The majority of articles are from psychologists (approximately 80%), but contributions also come from psychiatrists, physicists, physicians, neuroscientists, philosophers, historians, and anthropologists.
