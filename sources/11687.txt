  		              		Experience Description   

    I was raised under the influence of my father, who was strict and authoritarian since childhood, so my mind was deep-rooted on Marxism theory. Also, I was an active member in communist party in college. When I started working, I was ambitiously longing to become a successor of the party in both socialist-minded and professionally competent. Hence, I disliked idealism, having no attachment with any religions or superstitions. Nevertheless,  incredible things happened to me, especially since I was a die-hard atheist.  The illness might have been initiated due to several cold and hard winters. On top of this, I was a workaholic. Each year my chronic coughs always began in autumn and  continued to winter, and then lingered until the end of spring and lasted to the beginning of summer. One autumn of that particular year, my prolonged coughing ailment broke out again. I went to a local clinic every day to have an antibiotic intravenous (IV) treatment as I usually did before. I arrived at the clinic around 8 PM. The doctor told me that a specific lot of Penicillin that was used on me two days ago was given to treat a child just recently. Then I needed to use a new lot, so they did a skin test on me first. It was a 'positive' result on my wrist with a big two-cent size, bulging redness on my skin that spread like pseudopodia. I  hesitated a few minutes before asking doctor, 'Is it OK to have a reaction like this?' The doctor pondered awhile then replied, 'It is a false positive due to a new lot was used on you. It should be all right as you had been treated with Penicillin a couple days ago.' However, to prevent me from having an anaphylaxis shock, he gave me a Phenergan shot. Additionally, he injected Dexamethasone into my intravenous drip. I felt confident and relaxed afterwards. I then walked into patient ward and was lying down on a bed. A nurse hooked me up with an IV and then left to attend other patients. Shortly after, there was a train-like screaching, tinnitus sound. 

  Suddenly I fell into a dark tunnel and I was charging forward. I felt tremendously apprehensive, asking myself, 'What is wrong with me? I am fine just now but how come everything changed?' I wanted to stop and go back, but I was moving uncontrollably forward  and could not head back. I screamed frantically, yet I was mute. I attempted to struggle through, but still my effort was futile. I perceived myself as a speck, hurling in an eternal circular pathway.
  
  Although my flesh lay in the physical world, I (my soul) entered into a dimension with a barrier that separated 'me' and 'my spirit.' Clearly, I realized that it was not a dream. Instead there was something wrong with the intravenous drip. I had an allergic reaction to Penicillin. I underwent panic, felt frightened, vulnerable, and despaired while floating in this endless tunnel. I knew obviously my body still lay in bed, but I could not go back into it anymore. 'Is this death?' I contemplated. 'If it is, why am I very clear-headed?' I did not disappear, but rather I was isolated from the physical world. I felt no pain. I was hovering liked a feather and feeling very cozy.

  To explain exactly what I felt as something in the unseen world, it seemed like there was a stream of beings guided me. They affirmed my answers, clarified my confusions, and comforted my bewildered heart. I did not know how to describe the 'stream of beings.' They were silent and amorphic, yet full of kindness, brightness, compassion, and amiability. They answered all my questions. It felt I was  being lead and enveloped by a spring sunshine. I understood they were beings in a much higher level than me and in the spiritual realm. I called them prophet, the wisdom who communicated to me telepathically, revealing the true colors of the universe, purpose of life, and opened the door of death so I could have a glimpse of the other dimension.

  Instantaneously, I was no longer in the lengthy, dark tunnel. Alternatively, I was in a bright, warm, and pure world. I was completely relieved, no more agonies, but instead replaced with eternal peace and bliss. My spirit asked one question after another, regarding the true colors of the universe and about life and death. Wherever my conscious went, he unfolded the answers before my eyes. This world was made up of particles. When microparticles accumulated, it formed a world with thousands of collective representations, meaning  specific images. For example, as to many people the tree in front of a house is only a tree, while in this realm it is a stacked heap of tree-shaped molecules that are drifting and cycling forever. I did see the piles of molecules, flowing and surrounding this phenomenal world. While my physical body still lay in bed while  given an IV drip, my conscious was free at will to watch trees outside the clinic.

  Am I a particle, too? 'Yes, human body is built with innumerable particles. They circulate, metabolize, exchange, and etc. as being all part of the movements. As for you (my spirit to be exact), you are part of the molecules who are recycling among them. Therefore, particles cluster, mobile, recycle, flow to somewhere, and then assemble to another physique. So, this phenomenon keeps recurring, there is no life or death. It is infinite and the essence of the world. Commonly known as death which is actually a continuation on to the next phase of life. At this state you are in now. Your mind (soul) is existing and thinking obviously, but you are separated from the physical world without communication. It is like a glass-door partition between you and the world; you can see everything of the physical world, however people on the other side can't feel your existence.' 

  Being unable to communicate the situation you are in, and your loved ones have no means to understand it. Thus, I know, as for death, since people you loved don't understand what death truly is so they feel sorrow for the decreased. At this moment, I became worried if my parents know I had died, then they will be very miserable. In addition to my child who is too young to be independent. All these worries are flashing in my mind.

    As our flesh is like a TV set, our consciousness is like TV programs. Is it perhaps when a TV set is aged to break down then all signals become vanished? Human's body is an aggregation of particulate matter that becomes a carrier. Whether the carrier is a particulate matter or in a form of energy, it never disappears. At this moment, I was in a confused situation where my conscious and flesh were detached but still in a connected state. I felt there are several different dimensions coexisted. While my conscious stayed in another realm, I was telepathizing with prophets and the wise whom revealed the true colors of the universe to me. At the same time, I was keen to everything in this dimension, clearly knowing things were around me. Owing to the fast velocity around here, sounds were transmitted to ears in a slow and time-delay fashion. 

    While on Earth, an old couple came to the clinic to see a doctor. When they walked by the patient ward I was in, they saw I was alone and asleep with an IV. They commented 'Look! This poor lady who has a child to take care of.' People hustled in and out of the clinic accompanied by unceasingly muffled noises. I even saw right through the wall with two coat hangers dangled in a closet. At once, my pager rang three times nurse came and asked if I wanted to answer. One of them was from the band musician who wanted to talk about our performance, the other two were from my dates. I was directing my somewhat unfamiliar body to nod my head sluggishly.

     In my NDE, I considered money, love, and passions would never be important to me anymore. I became clairvoyant knowing what doctor would tell the patients outside of my room when they described their symptoms to the doctor even before he opened his mouth to talk. Consequently, they were all verified as what I had perceived beforehand. 'I' was suspended above my body to dictate it (my flesh) to take a deep, long breath so to speak,  to show a movement of being alive. Later, the doctor told me that he could not understand why I was taking cheyne-stode's breathing which was different than a normal respiration as when I was unconscious.
    
    When the doctor came to examine me, my afloat soul commanded my body to wink to bring his attention. I (my body) clung to his hand for he would be the only person who could bring me back to my parents, child, and unfinished missions. Instantly,my spirit plunged down abruptly,feeling my head spinning, Finally, I merged into my body.

     When I opened my eyes to sit up, I began vomiting nonstop. Totally, I puked pickle-like dark fluid that was half-full in a washbasin, and then my whole body felt empty. The doctor was astonished,”How come your small stomach held this much stuff?”It must have been a ritual cleanse. The doctor had made every effort to rescue me. When I told him about what I had been through in last four hours, he was silent and listened to me before his face turned pale. I thought he was very terrified after hearing my experience. He stayed in my room to accompany me for the whole night. I have no intention to blame my doctor at all. I had a chance to experience NDE was because of his mistakes, so I had an insight of the Earth and the other realm. Being intimidated by and  my fear of death had diminished, as my NDE had completely changed my perspectives toward the meaning of life and the ethics of entire world.
