&nbsp;

After a car accident where the car was so mangled they thought I was dead, they heard me moan. I was placed in traction for weeks in Englewood Hospital. My neck and back were injured and I was coughing up blood.

I had an out of body experience. It wasn't during an operation, it was while I was in traction. I floated out of my body to the top of the room and then I floated into the hallway down to over the nurse's station and I could hear them speaking.

I was very, very scared and yelling at the top of my lungs, 'HELP! HELP!' but they couldn't hear me. The next thing I knew, I was back in my body.

Did you see, or feel surrounded by, a brilliant light?       A light clearly of mystical or other-worldly origin

Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:

During your experience, did you gain special knowledge or information about your purpose?    Yes   The spirit does live outside the body and continues on. We can't see x-rays, radio waves, gamma rays, but we know they exist.  At the moment of death, the body gets lighter. It is my belief at that exact moment, the physical body is dead, but the spirit exits. At the same moment of death, the four candlepower of light we generate goes out and a fine mist leaves the body. That to me is the spirit moving into another dimension. I just finished a book titled 'God's Spirit Children Having a Human Experience'. It's based on my experience.

Have you ever shared this experience with others?     Yes    Forty years passed before I told anyone. Their reaction, doubtful. 'Wish your right, but...'

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?     No

What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?       Experience was definitely real

What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?       Experience was definitely real
