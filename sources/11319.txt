  		              		Experience Description:   

  					  I tripped and fell hitting my left temple on the sharp corner of a low (about two feet high) table. I was unconscious but heard people standing over me saying, 'Is he dead? Is he dead?'

At that point, I started to move extremely fast, feet first, through a dark tunnel, as I slowly turned counterclockwise. There were red, green, and other darker color lights around the edge of the tunnel. Human faces (faces only) were clearly visible around the inside of the tunnel. They were all looking at me, some were smiling, others seemed somewhat bored - I felt no threat or fear from any of the faces or from the experience in general. I did not recognize any of the faces. I begin to move even faster through the tunnel, then, all of a sudden, I was back in my body and awake. I got up and had no pain or apparent physical damage from the incident.
