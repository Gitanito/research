MADAM,
IT is with feelings of the most devout respect and
veneration, that, by your l~perial permission, I take the
present opportunity of laying the following Work at your
Highness' feet.
According to your Imperial Highness' gracious com-
mands, this Translation, although in some passages free,
(in order to adapt it to the customs of England,) is still
almost a Jae-simile, of the only and original Manuscript,
lately in possession of the ever-to-be-lamented Emperor
and King.
In adhering strictly to your Imperial commands, I hope
that my endeavours to embellish the Work, according to
the original Drawings, will meet with your Imperial
Highness' gracious 1,1.pprobation. ·
With feelings of th~ most profound respect,
I remain,
Your Imperial Highness'
Devoted Servant,
HERMAN KIRCHENHOFFER.

TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE.
TaE followiug Work is translated from a Manuscript, in the Germa~ lan-
guage, which was found among the camp equipage belouging to the late
Emperor of France, when he retreated from Leipzic, after the defeat of hi.i
army, in the year ISI:l. It fell to the lot of a Prussian officer, who, ignorant ·
of its great value, sold it for a few Napoleons to a French general officer,
then a prisoner of war in the fortress of Koningsburg. This gentleman
aware of its great importance, and knowing fr<!m Napoleon's arms, which
were emblazoned upon it, that it once belonged to his imperial master, was
resolved on his return to France to present it at the Tuilleries; but alas! he
did not live to accomplish this purpoee; for, although his medical attendants
gave him every hope of recovery from his wounds,.their efforts to restore him
to health proved unavailiug, for he died soon after f~om mmtification which
took place ..rter Amputation of the right arm.
By will, hastily drawn up, the penoaal ..W.-ts of this officer·were trans-
mitted to his family, who were enjoined to take the earliest opportunity of
putting the Manuscript in question into the Emperor's own- hands; but Na-
poleon's manifold occupations,. both civil and military, from time to tii11e.
prevented thia.
During the early part of Napoleon's ostrr..Cism in St. Helena, means were
found of conveying the Manuscript to the.Empress, who unfortunately never
had an opportunity, although she eagerly sought for•it, of sending it to her
husband. After his death her Highness gave the Translator her imperial
permission for its publication in the Eaglish language.
Regarding the purpose which Napoleon had in view in the private perusal
of this Work, it is necessary to infonn the Reader; but, previous to this,
it will be proper to state the manner in which he- himself became possessed
of it.
It is well known that many French artists and literati accompani13d

the arts and sciences, in greater perfection than in any other country iu the
world, the most civilized nations of Europe in the present day not excepted.
At the head of the " Commission of Arts" was M. Sounini, whose travel~
have since excited so much attention. This gentleman having succeeded in
perfotating a passage into the interior chamber of one of the royal tombs in
Mount Lybicus, near Thebes, found therein a Sarcophagus, in which was a
mummy of extraordinary beauty, and in fine preservation. Having examined
this curiosity very minutely, he discovered attached by a peculiar kind of
gum to the left breast, a long roll of papyrus, which, having unrolled, greatly
excited his curiosity on account of the hieroglyghics which were beautifully
painted on it.
M. Sonnini's deseription of these tombs, which are of the most astonishing
structure, is as follows: "The whole of the mounta~n Lybicus, which b.egins
.at half a league to the west of the Memnonium, and ends immediately opp<>-
site to Medinet-abou, is pierced from its base to three-fourths of its ~Jevation
with a great number of sepukhral grottos. Those which are nearest the
/ surface of the ground 'are the most spacious, as well as the most decorated ;
those which are in the most elevated part of the UM>Untain m·e much more
rudely contrived and executed ; while such as hold the middle place, bear
an adjusted proportion of space and ornament. Those which belong to the
poor are the most interesting, because they always contain llllJDJl representa-
ti'on of the arts which flourished, and the trades which were practised, at
that epoch. Tbs .plan or tlaue grotto.s is in a great measure the same. A
door, opening rowards the east, displays a gallery of abqut twenty feet in
length, which is sometimes .formed in,a straight line,'and at other times runs
olf from the entran~e in a right angle : it is indifferently supported by
columns or pilasters, of which the number varies from four to ten. At the
extremity of the gallery are wells which lead to the catacombs, where the
mummies are deposited. The '1epth of these wells varies from forty to sixty
feet, and they are connected with long subterraneous passages, r~dely shaped
in the rock, <which te,minate in.a chamber of about thirty feet square, whose
sides are supported by pilasters, and contain large remains of the mummies.
There are evident traces of numerous other subterraneous communications,
which probably lead to other chambers, that are at present concealed.
"In the upper gallery are flculptured.in basso-reli.evo, or painted in fresco,
a crowd of subjects relating to funeral ceremonies. The most intere11ting
pictures which are seen there, offer a detail of circumstances connected with
the ancient inhabitants of the country. There, are represented their first
occupations, such u the chase and the fishery ; thence we may trace the
progress of civilization, in the employments of the sadler, the cartwright, the
potter, the money-changer, the husbandman, and in the duties and punish·

ments of milit~ry life. Each• grotto is adorned with a ceiling painted with
subjects of fancy, aud whose design is exactly the same as that of the paper-
hangings which were fashionable in France about thirty years ago.
" The tombs of the kings are about six thousand four hundred paces from
the ~iver. They have been formed in a narrow valley, in the centre of the
mountain Libyc11s. The ancient way thither is not known, and ·the spot is
now: gained by an artificial passage. These sepulchre• occupy a large
ravine, which is flanked by the bed of a torrent. The plan of one of these
tombs will be sufficient to explain the general disposition of the rest. Every
grotto communicates with the valley by a large gate, which opens to a gal-
lery hollowed in the rock: its breadth and height are generally abou_
t twelve
feet, and its length is twenty paces to tlfe second gate, which opens to
another gallery of the same breadth, and twenty-four feet in length. To the
right and left of this gallery are chamber' of five feet in breadth and ten feet
long.-There, are found paintings of arms; such as hatchets, poignards,
curvated sabres, straight swords, lances, javelins, bows, arrows, quivers,'
coats of mail, shields, implements of husbandry, vases, and trinkets of every
kind. The detail of preparing food is also represented.~
"A third gaJIAry RllCCeArlR, nf' thA a2mP. .limonainM 11<1 the former, and leads
to a chamber above the level of the other apartments, which is eighteen feet
square. From this chamber is the entrance to a gallery of1hirty-four paces
in length; there is also an inclining gallery, whose length is twenty-eight
paces : at its extremity is a corridor of sixteen paces, leading to a chamber
of eleven paces square, which is connected with another of the same size by
a gallery of six paces. A square saloon then succeeds, supported by eight
pillars; its length is twenty paces, and its breadth twenty. Here is the sar-
cophagus which contained the mummy of the king. The Romans made
irome attempts to carry away this sarcophagus from the grotto where it is
deposited; they had even tried to level the ground, in order to facilitate its
removal, but they very soon renounced the impracticable enterprise. ·
"To the saloon of the sarcophagus, another apartment succeeds, oftwenty-
five paces in breadth, and forty in length. The height of the tomb is seven
feet, its length eight, and its beiwth six: the total length of the gallery is two
hundred and twenty-five paces. The tombs of the kings throughout their
whole extent are covered with pictures·and hieroglyphics ;• but the greater

part are painted in freseo, and represent the mos\ fautastic subjects that cau be
conceived. Here it was that the Romans caught that idea of the grotesque,
which formed a principal subject of their compositions during the second nnd
third ages of the empire. 'l'he researches into Herculaneum have discovered
a great uumber of paintings executed in a similar taste.
"One of the most interesting of these grottos contains a sarcophagus that
is still entire aud in its place. Its length is sixteen feet, its height twelve,
and its breadth six. It still preserves the lid, adorned with the effigy of the
king, which is a single block of granite. The astonishment that is.felt, on
reflecting that this enormous mass was transported to the extremity of a sub-
terraneous pa$sage two hundred paces in length, exceeds nil bounds, when
it is considered that it was worked upon the place where it remains. What
difficulties must have been surmounted, in order to transport a weight of
seYeral hundred tons, across the almost impracticable roads of the. moun-
tain !--Here we found the famous mummy aud papyrus roll."
Human s:.cri6ces are continually represented, as well as a diversity of
curious Hieroglyphical Figures, one of which represents Isis walking on the
Earth, and Flowers springing forth from under her Feet.
Frol'.JI tho time of Strabo, there were reckoned seventeen to1nbs of kings:
and we shall still find the same number, if we may comprehend in this
enumeration a superb grotto, whose plan is equally large and beautiful with
that of the sepulchres of the Theban sovereigns. Thie grotto is half a league
to the north of the Memnonium, and is scooped out a.t the bottom of a
mountain, whose inclosurcs contain many other. tombs : the eutrance of
several of them is closed, and the greater part of them have been violated.
It appears that those, of the ancient Egyptians, who had remained faithful
to their worship, endeavoured, from respect to the memory of their princes,
to conceal the knowledge of their sepulchres, either from their conquerors, or
the professors of other religions.
The ancient Egyptians, from the king to the lowest of his subjects, were
ver~ attentive to the construct!on of their burying-places, in the firm belief
that, after several thousand years, the soul would return to inhabit the body,
if, during that time, it should have remained undisturbed. Hence proceeded
the custom of embalming, and the position of sepulchres in places inaccessi-
ble to the inundation of the river.
In ·the neighbourhood of the Memnonium, and among the grottos of
private indivjduals, many are found which are still filled with the ·fragments
of mummies. When the Arabs, who consider the grottos as the property of

each family, apprehend that they may be visited by strangers, they 1et fire
to the mummies. which they contain, i·n order to 'turn the curious from the
research. There are some of these caverns still untouched; as the perseve·
ring traveller has not yet discovered them.
·The sepulchres of the rich are exhausted. None of the mummies which
are sold by the people of the country are dressed in the envelope, upon
which the figure of Death was painted. A fow fragments of these envelopes
are all which now appear. It is indeed very extraordinary that, except i~ the
present instance, no traveller has found the manuscripts on the papyrus,
which the mummies of distingnished P.ersons never fail to enclose. These
manuscripts are without contradiction the most ancient that have been
preserved, and appear to contain the prayers made for the dead, and also
the mysterious books used by the priests. ·They.are written in hieroglyphics
or characters, and ·are decorated with drawings that resemble the pictures
which cover the walls of the sepulchres. Many of the mummies have the
nails, both of thefr hands and feet, gilt. Two rolls of the papyrus are some-
times found with them, which are often placed under the arm-pits, though
they are also deposited in the division of the thighs, and n~ar the organs of
generation.
M. Sonnini hastened to General Bonaparte, whose curiosity likewise being
much excited by viewing this hieroglyphical treaaure, sent for a learned
Copt, who, after an attentive perusal, discoYered a key whereby he was
enabled ·to decypher the characters. After great labour, he accomplished
this task, and dictated its contents to Napoleon's secretary, who, in order to
preserve the matter secret, tranalated and wrote them down in the German
language.
General Bonaparte, having consulted the German translation of the roll
regarding some transactions in his own life, was amazed to find tha:t the
answers given, correspond strictly with what' had actually occurred. He
' accordingly secured the original 'and translated Manuscripts in his private
cabinet, which ever after accompanied him, until• the fatal day of Leipzic
above mentioned. They were held by him as a sacred treasure, and are
said to have been a stimulus to many of his grandest speculations, he being
known to consult them on all occasions. Before each campaign, and on the
eve·of every battle or treaty; Napoleon consulted his favourite Oracle. • His
grief for the loss of this companion of his priyate ho111'8, was excessive ; and
it is said that, at Leipzic, he even ran the 1·isk of being taken, in his eager-
ness to preserve the cabinet, containing it, from destructi9n.

bed to the translated Manuscript, are to be seen the following Questions, as
put to the Oracle, with their Answers as received by that illustrious man.
They are here selected, from among m11ay others on account of the v.ery
strong analogy, I might say identity, which exists between them and some
of the most important actions of bis life.

I shall forbear further quotation, as the rest.of the answers in the 'list &re'
either obscure, or relative to matteri of inferior or domestic import.
Regarding'the.personal application.of the above answers (except the lut,
of which I shall speak presently,) ·to the late Emperor, there can be no
difference of opinion i this is too obvious to admit of any discussion ;
il)deed, I have been confidently informed, that when he aspired to the impe-
rial throne, he was actually transported with rapture and amazement, whea
h" read the words eontaiaed in the Answer to Question 8, m. "·Thon shalt
meet with mauy obstacle11, but at length thoa shalt attain the highest eanhly
power aqd honour." ·
In the second Answer to Question 15, tbitt is, the 1-at which I hava
quoted from the Emperor's list, the reader will perceive that the Autocrat
of Russia is indicated ; but whether die words have any direct reference to
~hat passed before the treaty of Tilsit, or ~o any fu\ure bouudaries which
have been, or may be, opposed to Russian aggr~dize"1eut, is.not equally
certain. At all events, it mu11t be allow1,i~; that N•pClleon's iavuion of the
Russian territory clearly prove!! tha,t h.iS o-.vn etintime.atl were in entire
accordai;ice with the latter suggestion.
It had been a happy cin:umstance for Napoleon, had he uniformly abided,
or been ruled. by answers to many other questions, which he was in the
habit of putting to the Oracle, and which doubtless, forewarned hini of
danger, and most probably of his downfall.: but he was so accustomed,
from a long series of snccess in almost every pursuit which he undertook, -
td
look oli the bright side of every circumstance, that, to a mind like his, such
forewarnings were not likely to be productive ofihat salutary restraint which
1ome bfhla speculations required.
As inatances of the lamentable elFects of this want of confidence in the
oracular counsels c;_ontained in the following Work, I may adduce the battle
of Leipzic itself, and the fatal consequences of the Russian campaign, '11iz.
the con1lagration ofMoscow, the 40ttruc;tio11 of his brave army1 and finally,
the abdication of a sceptre which be was ,1>ng accustomed to wave over tbe
~eads of those very monarchs who n()w compelled him to relinquish it.
To return to ,the subject of the Manu!ICripts themselves :-What became of
the original Papyrus is not known, but it ia supposed that from the frailness
of its texture, it was destroyed in the general pillage. If, however, ~sho.1,1141
be in existence, the present proprietor is hereby earuestly entre~d fo ca«n-
municate tlaereupon with· the Secretary of Her ·lm~rial Highness, making
whatever demand for its r~toration which he may deem requisite ; or he
may, if more convenient, deposit it in the· Imperial Museum at ~ienna,

wlaere he 11iall ob.tain a receipt for the same in .due form. In the· care
of the administrators ·of the Museum, he is required to le'ave a sealed letter,
addressed to her Imperial HighnesH' Secretary, containing the demand of
money, which he feels himself entitled to, in the way of remuneration.
· It remains now for the Translator to say something respecting the nature
and quality of the Answers which are contained in the BooK or FATE. In
the first place then respecting the nature of the An1wers, it will appear that
some of these seem to have so direct a reference to the manncn nud customs
of the present age, as alm9st to de1nive them of the same just claims to. an·
tiquity which it will be allowed the others undoubtedly possess. But this
,impres:1ion will speedily vanish, when we call io mind, that a~ong the
ancient Egyptians the same arts were cultivated, as are now carried on in
England and other countries at the present day. Do not the paintings in the
1 tombs, which are still in preservation.in Egypt, prove this 1 It is likewise
necessary to take into account, that the work has already. passed through
two successive translations, consequently, in some passages there must be a
considerable deterioration from the original sense ; but more particularly, as
in phrases of a domestic or professional application, it is sometimes imponi-
blo to preserve the real idiom of a translated language.
lo my own case, I have to state, that from a: long residence in this country,
I have been enabled to attain a knowledgo of many of the peculiarities both
of customs and language among the English people. This knowledge has
been of great use in my 1·ecent labours, and it will account fo1· those slight
deviations which I have sometim.es found necessary, in adapting an ancient
Egyptian work to modern eyes and ears. These deviations, however, are
few, and I may add slight; but they will be more certainly appreciated
when the Reader bas had an opportunity of perusing the present translation,
and then comparing it with the German and French ones, which I intend to
have published immediately on my return to the Continent.
. In the se~ond place, regarding the quality of the Answers, I have to
observe, tha'\ they are of five kinds, vir, positive, mandatory, presumptive,
admonitory and conditional. As examples, I shall select five, (that is, ooe- of
each qnal,ity,) from among seventeen, which have' been returned to various
pel'90n• who consulted the Oracle since it has been io my possession.
.. '
Firs(.'theil, of the positive. It was asked (Question 17,) by a gentleman,
"Will.my fioloved prove true in my absence 1" The Answer returned wa1,
(Hieroglyphic of tke Plough,) "The affiictions of the being whom thou
love1t. will be placed on none other but thyself."
•
o;g;1;;ed by Google
PllEl'ACJ!!, • xiii.
Example of the mand11-tory. It was asked (Question 6,) "Shall I make.
or mar, my fortune by gambling 1" The answer was, (Hieroglyphic of
Cron Bones,) "Bo' warned! from henceforth, never play for money. nor
money's worth.'~
As an example of the.presumptive, it was asketl, (Question 28,) " Shall I
ever find a treasure?" The answer waa such as to leave no doubt on the
consulter's mind thnt he should find a treasure; but at the same time it con-
tained such good counsel, as to tho .application of it, as was absolutely
required by a man of his circumstances and disposition. It was, (Hyeroglyphic
of Hom of Plenty,) " When thou findest a treasure, teach thy tongue to
be silent;. and see .that thou makest good use of thy ricl:llls.''
To exemplify the admonitory, I may give an instance of a lady who con-
sulted t~e Oracle in tho followmg words, (Question 24,) "Inform me of all
particulars relating to my future husband." The Answer was, (Hieroglyphic
of the Bow and Arrow,) "Consider well whether thou onghtest, at presenl, to
change thy condition in life.''
Lastly, as an example of the conditional Answers, I select the following.
It was asked, (Questio1i 19.) by tho mother of a largo family, "After my
death" will my children be virtuous and happy 1 The Answer was, (Hiero-
glyphic of the Virgin,) " In tbe training of thy olfspring, lot thy discipline
be strict, but not severe; lose no opportunity of improving their understand-
ings, and, in tho plenitude of their happiness, they will bless thee.''
Another quality which pertain& to.a few ofth11se Answers, is tho close affi-
nity which seems to exist betwen them and some of tho most favouritd
moral axioms in use among the civilize1l nations of antiquity : but is this to
be wondered at, when WO consider that Egypt had long been tho residence
of the Hebrews, and that it had been overrun both by the Greeks and Romans,
who afterwards formed settlements th.ere 1 It cannot be doubted, therefore, ·.
that_the Hebrews not only retained the arts which they saw cultivated, and
learned iu Egypt, but also that their yriosts became possessors of copies of
books which wore in use in tho temples. That the Greeks and Romans did
so, is beyond speculation ; for it is well known (being assorted by Herodotus
and other historians) that all the Oracles, afterwards established in the states
<if Greece and elsewhere, owed their origin to books found in the Egyptiaia
temples, which were pillaged and plundered upwards of 3000 years ago.
That these books were mere transcripts of the original copy of the work
now given to the worlJ. there can likewise be no doubt; consequently, the
inference is a fair,one, that, the moral axioms, above spoken of, wore bor- .
rowed from these books, and that, being greatly admired by the literati of .

those days, such passages wete afterwards ttansplanted into their own worb,
as original.
This explanation of the apparent identity will be perfectly satisfacto,., to
every candid reader; but, in order to throw as much light on the subject as
possible; I have prefixed to the present work an authentic and interesting
account of the ORACLES which bore so famous a part in the histories of
ancient Egypt and Greece.
The Translator, in takiug his leave of the British Public, has now merely
to state that the J,JOOK OF FATE, in its English dress, is adapted to all
conditions of life: and persons of every rank and capacity will now have an
opportunity of consulting it,·aud of regulating their future conduct according
to its ORACULAR COUNSELS. .

INTRODUCTORY ACCOUNT
OF
.No institution is more Jao:ious than ,the ancient Oracles ,of,Egypt, Greece
and :Rome. They w.ere said to be the will of the gods themselves, .
and they
were.consulted, not only qpon every important matter, but.even wt,he affairi
of.private life. To make peace or war, to .introduce a .ch~nge of ,govern-
ment, to plant a colony, to enact laws, to raise an edifice, or to m11rry, were
all sufficient reasons tO coll)lult the will of the gods. . Mankind, in consulting
them, showed that they wished to pay implicit obedience to the .COJllmand
of the divinity, and, when thl'.Y .had be.eu favoured with 1111 answer, they
acted with P10re spirit, and with more vigour, conscious that the undertaking
had met with the sanction and approbat~oµ of heaven. . In this, therefore, .it
will .not appear wonderful t,hat .so m.any,places were sacred to oracular
purposes.

oracles, but in process or time, heroes were. admitted to enjoy the same.
·privileges; and the oracles of a Trophonius and an Antinons, were soon
able to · rival the fame of Apollo and Qf Jupiter. The most celebrated
oracles of antiquity were those of Dodona, Delphi, Jupiter Amnon &c. The
temple of Delphi seemed to claim a superiority over the other temples; its
fame was once more extended, and its riches were so great, that not only
private persons, but even kings and numeroud armies, made it an object of
plunder and of rapine.
The manner of delivering oraClea was diffe~ent. A priestess at Delphi
was permitted to pronounce the oracles of the god, and her delivery of the
answers was always attended with acts of ap1;>arent madness and despe-
rate fury. Not only women, but even doves, were the ministers of the
temple 'of Dodona; and the suppliant votary was often startled to hear Jiis
questions readily answered by the decayed trunk, or the spreading branches
of a neighbouring oak. Amnon conveyed his answers in a plain and open
manner ; but Amphiarius required many ablutions and preparatory ceremo- .
nies, and he generally communicated his oracles to his suppliants in dreams
and visions. Sometimes the first words that were heard, after issuing from
the temple, were deemed the answers of the oracles, and sometimes the
nodding or shaking of the head or' the statue, the ·motions of fishes in a
neighbouring lake, or their reluctance in accepting the food which was
offered to them, were as strong and valid as· the mo~t express and most
minute explanations.
It is a question among the .learned, whether the oracles 'were given by the
inspiration of evil spirlts, or whether they proceeded from the imposture of
the priests. Imposture, however, and forgery, cannot long flourish, and
falsehood b~comes its own destroyer; and on the contrary, itIs well known
bow much confidence the people, even of an enlightened age, place upon
dreams, prophecies, and unaccountable incidents. Some have strongly
believed that all the oracles of the earth cea'sed iPt the birth of Christ, but the
l[!Upposition is false. It was, indeed, the beginning of their decline; but they
remained in repute, and were consulted, though perhaps not so frequently,
till the fourth century. when Christianity began to triumph over paganiem.
The oracles often suffered themselves to be bribed. Alexander·did it, but it
is well known that Lysander failed in the attempt. Herodotus, who first
mentioned the corruption which often prevailed in the oracular temples of
Greece and Egypt, lias been severely trea-ted for his remarks, by the bisto·
rian Plutarch. Demosthenes is also a witne~s of the corruption, and_· he
observed that the oracles of Greece were servilely subservient to the will and
pleasure of Philip king of Ma~don, as he beautifully expresses it by the
word Philipidzein.
When ju a state of inspiration, the eyes of the Priestess suddenly sparkled,
her hair stood on end, and a shivering ran over all her body. In this con-

Sometimes the spirit of inspiration was .more gentle, and not alway$ violent;·
yet Plutarch ment\91l8 one of the /priestetses who was thrown into such an
excessive fury, that not only those that consulted the oracle, but also the
priest,!! ihat conducted her to the sacred tripod, and attended her during the
inspirat.Wu, were terrified and forsook the temple; and so violent was the lit,
that 11he, continued for some days in the most agonizing situation, and at last
died. At Delphos, the Pythia, before she placed herself on the tripod, used
t.o -1i her whole body, and particularly her hair, in the waters of the foun-
tain Castalis, llt the Coot of mount Parnassus. She also shook a laurel tree

. '.fhe Priestess always appeared dressed in the garment; of virgins to inti-
mate their purity and modesty, and they were solemnly bound to obaerve
tlie strictest Jaws of te1J1perance and chastity, that neither fantastical dresses
nor lascivious behaviour might bring the office, the religion, cir the 1anctity
of the place into contempt. There was originally but ooe Pydlia, besides
subordioate priests, but afterwards two were chosen, and sometimes more.
The most celebrated of aU th11se is Pheu1onoe, who is supposed by some to
hav:e been ~he first who gave oracles at Delphi.· The oracles were"'alwaya
delivel'ed in hexameter verses, a ci111tom which was some time after discon-
tinued. The Pythia was consulted only one month in the year, about the
' spring. It was always required, that those who consulted the oracle should
~ke large preaeata to Apollo, and from thcmce'arose the opulence, splen-
.door, and the magnificence of the celebrated temple of Delphi. Sacrifices
were al10 oifered to the divini\y, and"if the omens proved unfavourable, the
priest~s refused to give an answer. There were generally five priests who
asmtl,ld at the o1f11ring of the saerilices, and.there was also another who
.itended the Pythia, .and assisted h61' in .receiving the oracle.
We shall now pr1>ceed to describe some of the m_oet celebrated of the
141:jent Or~e,a :
Oracle oC Delphos.
"Di:LnPos, now called Castri, the capital of Phocis, in Greece, was anciently
1m:ieh celebrated for its Te:nple and Oracle of Apollo. It ·was also called
Pytho, by the poets~- from the serpeut Python, which Apollo killed in this
place. Pausanias, however, says that this ume Pytho was given to the city
~f Delphoe, hy Pytbis, ·son of Delphus, and grandson of Lycorus. Tho

er Bacr&us were both worshipped there ; and others, with treat• probability
derive the name from Delp~oa, single, or solitary, referring to the l'etired
·Situation of the city among the mountains.
Justin questions, which was the most worthy of admiration, the fortifica~
tion_
of the place, or the majesty of the god, who here delivered his oracles.
The Temple of Apollo occupied a· large space, and many streets opened to
it. The first discovery which laid the foundation of the extraordinary vene-
ration in which the Oracle of Delphos was held, and of the riches accumula-
ted in the temple, is said to have been occasioned by some goats which were
feeding on mount Parnassus, near a deep and large cavern, with a nart'ow
entrance. These goats having J>een observed by the goat-he1·d Coretas, to
frisk and leap after a strange manner, and to utter unusual so~ds immediate•
ly upon their approach to the mouth of the cavern, he had the curiosity to
view it, and found himself seized with the like fit of madness, skipping, dan-
cing, and fortelling things to come.
At the news of this discovery, multitudes 1locked thither, many of whom
were possesse.d with such frantic enthusiam, that they threw themselves head-
long into the openfoit of the cavern ; insomuch, that it was necessary to issue
an edict, forbiddidg all persons to approach it. This surprising place was
treated with singab.r veneration, and was soon covered with a kind ofchapel,
which was originally made of laurel boughs, and resemblep a large hut.
This, accordfog to the Phocian tradition, was surronded by one of wax,
raised up bybees. After this a thir.d was bui1t of solid copper, said to have
been the workmanship of Vulcan.
This last was destroyed by an earthquake, or, according to some authors,
by fire, which melted'the copper; and then a sumptuous Temple, altogether.
of stone, was erected by two excellentarchitects, Trophimus and Agamedes.
This tidifice was destroyed by fire in the 58th Olympiad, or 548 years B.
C. The Amphictyons proposed to be at the charge of building another;
but the Alcmeonides, a ricil'family of Athens, came to Delphos, obtained
the honor ofexecuting the building, and made it more magnificent then they
had at first proposed. The riches of this Temple, amassed by the donations
of those who frequented it and consulted the Oracle, exposed it to "arioml
depredations. . At length the Gauls, u~der the conduct of Brennus, came
hither for the same purpose; about 278 years B. C. ; but they were repulsed
w.ith great slaughter. I.ast of all, Nero robbed it oC 500 of its most precious
brazen and golden statues.
It has not been ascertained at what time this Oracle wa9 founded. It ios
certain, .bowever, that Apollo was not the first who was consulted here•
..iEschylus, in his tragedy of the.,Eumenides, says, Terra was the first who
issued oracles at Delphi : after her Themis, then Phrebe, another daughter-
of Terra, and, as it is said, mother of Latona, and grandmother to Apollo.
Pausanias aaya, that before Themis, Terr.a and NeptUne had delivered ora-

At length the Oracle of Apolio became established ud permanent ; and such
was its reputation, and such were the multitudes from all parts that came to
consult it, that the riches which were thus brought into the temple and city,
became so considerable as to be compared with those of the Persian kings.
Aho~t the time when this Oracle was first discovered, the whole mystery
requisite for obtaining the prophetic gift, is said to have been merely to_ap-
proach the cavern and inhale the vapour that issued from it; and then the
godinspired all persons indiscriminately; but at length several enthusiasts,
in the exi:ess of their fury, having thrown themselves headlong into the ca-
vern, itwas thought expedient to "ontrive a prevention of this accident, which
frequently occurred. ·Accordingly, the Priests placed over the hole; whence
the vapour issued, a machine which they called " a tripod," because it had
three feet~ and commissioned a woman to seat herself on it, where 1he might
iohale the vapour without danger, because the three feet ofthe machine stood
firmly upon the rock. This Priestess was named Pythia, from the serpe.nt
Python, !rlain,by Apollo, or from the Greek puthuthia, signifying to inquire,
because people came to Delphi to consult this deity. The females, first em-
ployed, were virgi~s Mlected wjth great precaution; but the only qualific~tion
necessary was to be able to speak and rep11at what the god dictated.
This was done by placing her ear close to one of the horns of the altar,
and listening ~o the voice.of one of Apollo's priest, to whom the question had
been communicated. This Priest, who stood near the altar, in tll11 interior
of the Temple, having been assisted by his brethren in the nece11S11ry devo-
tions and sacrifices, opened the BOOK OF FATE, which was deposited in
the Temple, and after many prayers, worked the required problems. The
Aiuwi:ll, which from the nature of the case in band, was often conditionttl,
being communicated to the Priestess on the tripod, was, after various cere-
monies, delivered to the enquiring multit.fd11, or to the individt.'llll who came
privat1>ly to consult the Oracle. .
The custom of choosing young virgins continued for a long time, till one
of them, who was extremely beautiful, was dishonoured by a yeung Thes-
saliau. An express law was then enacted, that none.should be chosen but
women !\hove fifty years old. At first there was only one Priestess; but
aftenvards, there were two or three. The oracles were not delivered every
day; but gifts and sacrifices were in some eases presented for a long time,
and even for a whole year; and it was only once a year, in the month borion,
which answered to the begl1;ming of spring, that Apollo inspired the Priest-
.ess. Except on this day, she was forbidden, under pain of death, to go into
the sanctuary to consult Apollo.
Alexander, before his expedition into Asia, came to Delphion one oflhose
day1 when the sanctuary was shut, and intreated the Prieste89 to mount the
tripod, which she steadily ~efused, alleging the law which forbade her. The

priaee, naturally impeiaoua, became impatient, and drew the Prieateaa by
force from her cell, and whilst he was conducting her to the sanctuary, she
took occasion to exclaim, "MT SON, THOU ART INVINCIBJl.E !!" As soon at
these words were pronounced, Alexander cried out that he we.s satisfied, and
·· would have no other oracle.
It is here to be observed however, that great but unnecessary preparations
were often made for giving mysteriousness to the oracle, and for eommaad-
iog the respect that was paid to it. Among other circumstances relating ti>
the sacrifices that were olfered, the Priesten herself fasted three days, and
before she ascended the tripod, the bathed herself in the fountain of Castalia.
She drank water from that fountain, and chewed laurel-leaves gathered
near it. She was then led into the sanctuary by the priests, who placed her
upon the tripod, .
A1 soon as she began to be agitated by the divine exhalation, said to ari.e
&om the cavern, but which was merely the vapour of ineense burnt there, in
order to give more mystery to the alfair, her hair stood OD end, her aspect
became wild and g!Jastly, her mouth began to foam, and ~er whole body
wassuddenly seized with_violent tremblings. In this conditio1111he attempt-
ed t~ escape from the Priests, who detained. her by·fotee, white her shrltb
and howling1 made the whole temple resound, and fitted the by"11tandt1n
with a sacred horr.or.
At length, unable to resist the impulse of the god, she surrendered hl!rself
up to him1 and at certain interval• uttered from the bottom of her stomach, ,
or belly, by the faculty or power of ventriloquism, some unconnected wol'dll\
which the Priests ranged in order, and;put in form of verse, giving them a
eonneetion which they had not when they were delivered by the Priestess.
The oracle being ptonouneed, the Priestess was taken olf the tripod and
eonducted back to her cell, whete she continued several daya to recover
•
henelf. Lucan tells us, thnt sifeedy death was .frequently the consequence
ef her enthusiasm. The oracles pronQuuced by the Priestess being generally
delivered to the poets, who attended on the occasion, and being put by them
into wretched verse, gave occasion to the raillery, that Apollo the Prince of
tM muau, waa tht tDOrat ofpoeta.
The Priests and Priestesses, to whose conduct the responses of the Oracle
were committed, were however, frequently guilty of fraud and imposture.
Aud many instances i;nlght be mentioned, in which the Delphic Prieetess wai
not 1uperior to corruption. Hence she persuaded the Lacetliemenillni to
uaist the people of Athens in the expulsion of the 30 tyrantll. Hence also,
the caused Demaratus to be divested of the royal dignity to make way fot
. Cleomenes; and supported the impostor Lysandtlt, when he endeaTettred te
ehange the 11ucc&1.sion to the throne of Sparta. It is not improbable, that

by sea, inspired the god with 'the answer he gave, ... to defend tkemselvu toitfi
tDalls oftc0od;"
These answers were likewise, on tnany occasions equivocal. Thus, when-
Crresus was about to invade the Medes, he consulted this Oracle upon the
success of the war, and received for answer, that by passing the river Halys,
he should win a great empire. But he was left to conjecture, di" to determine
by the event, whether this empire was his own or that of his enemies. Such
was also·the siune Oracle's answer tO Pyrrhus,
" .di& te, A:acida,.Rotna~oe bitu:ere posse."
which meant, "I say unto thee 0 Greek, thou canst overcome the Roman4,"
or, "I say unto thee, the Romans may overcome the Greeks."
Oraele oC Deloa.
The Oracle oC Apollo itt DelM, was one of the most famous Oracles in
the worfd, not t>llly for its antiquity, but for the richness of the sacred pre-
sents dedicated to the god, and the numbers of persons that resorted hither
from all parts for advice; in which respect It surpassed not only all the
Oracles of other gods, but even those ot Apollo . himselt,-that of Delphos
alone excepted. Some writers say, th?-t the island had the name of Delos,
• • from the clear and simple terms lu which the a1iswers wei'e here given by
the Oracle, contrary to the ambiguity observed in other places; but it was
consulted only while Apollo made Delos his summer reslileoce,'for his wiutet
abode was at Patara, a city Of Lycia. . The presents offered by the votarie~
"to Apollo were laid 011 the altar, which, as some say,"~vas erected by Apollo
himself, wheu he was only four years old, and formed of the horns of goats,
kille<l by Diana, on mount Cynthus. It was preserved pure from blood and
every kind of pollution, as offensive to Apollo. The whole islaud was an
asylum, which extended to all living ~r,eat':1~e3o,d• excepted, which were
not sulfered to be brought on shore.

Round the temple were.magnifice11t portico~, built.at the chargll of various
princes, as appears fro"11 the still legible inscriptions. To this temple the
neighbouring islands sent yearly a company of virgins to celebrate with
dan~ing the fe<itival of Apollo, and his sister Diana, and to make olferings in
thll name of their respeclive cities.
Delos was held in such reverence by iµost nations, that even the Persians,
after having laid waste the other islands, and every where destroyed the
temples of the gods, spared Delos ; and Datie, the Persian admiral~ forebore .
to anchor in the harbour.
Oracle oC .&moon.
The Temple ofJupiter Amnon was iri the deserts ofLibya, nine daysjourney
from Alexandria. It had a famous Oracle, which, according to ancient tradi-
tion, was established ~bout 18 centurles before the time of Augustus, by two
doves which dew away .from Thebais in Egypt, and came, one to Dodona,
and the other to Libya, where the people were soon informed of their divine
mission. The Oracle of Amnon was cons~lted by Hercules, Perseus, and
others; but when it pronounced Alexander to be the son of Jupiter, such
flattery destroyed its Jong established reputation, and in the age of Plutarch
it wa~ scarcely known. The situation of--the temple was pleaH~·t; and there••
was near it a fountain whose waters were cold at no.on and midnight, and _
warm in the morning and evening. There Wllre above one hundred priests
in the temple, but the elders only delivered oracles. There .was also an

tMDple of Jupiter Am·non, and the other to Dodooa, where with a human
veiee they acquainted the iohabita:ots of the country that Jupiter had conse-
crated the grodnd, which in future would give oracles. The extensive grove
which surrounded Jupiter's temple wu endowed with the gift of prophecy,
and Ot'llcles were frequently delivered by the sacred oaks, and the do.ves
which inhabited the place. This fabulous tradition of the oracular power
of the doves, ie uplained by Herodotus, who observes that some Phamiciaos
. carried away two prit1teuu from Egypt, ooe of which weot to fix her resi-
dence at Dodona, where the Oracle was establrshed. It may further be
observed, that the fable might have beeo founded upon the double meaning
of the word peleiai, which signifies dOtluin most parts of Greece, while lo the
dialect of the Epirots, it implies old womtn. Jo aocieot times the oracles
were delivered by the murmuring of a neighbouring fountain, but the custom
was afterwards changed. Large kettles were suspended in the air oear a
brazen statue, which held a lash in its hand. When the wind blew strong,
the statue was agitated alld struek against one of the kettles, which commu-
nicated the motion to all the rest, and raised that clattering and discordant
dio which continued for a 'while, and from which the priests 1lrew their pre-
dictions. Some suppose that the noise was o~casiooed by the shaking of the
leaves aod boughs of ao old oak, which the people frequently consulted; aod
from which they pretended to receive the oracles. It may be observed with
more probability that the oracles were delivered by the priests, who, by con~
cealiog themselves behind the oaks, gave occasion to the multitude to believe
that the trees were endowed with the power of-prophecy. As the ship Argo
was built with some of the oaks of the forest of Dodona, there were some
beams in the vessel which gave oracles to the Argonauts, and warned them
against the approach of calamity. Within the forest of Dodona there Wll8 a '
stream with a fountain of cool water, which had the power of ·Jighting a
torch as soon as it touched it. This fountain was totally dry at noonday,
aod was restored to its full course at midnight, from which time till the fol-
lowing noon it began to decrease, aod at the usual hour was again deprived
of its waters. The oracles of Dodona were originally delivered by men, but
afterwards by women.

the nobility were presently after chosen to be tbe keepers of these oracles,
which were laid up with all imaginable care in the capitol, in a chest under
ground. They could not be consulted without a special order of the senate,
which was never granted, unless upon receiving some notable defeat, upon
the rising of any considerable mutiny or sedition in the state, or upon some
other extraordinary occasion.
The number of priests in this, as in most other orders, was several times
altered. The Duumviri continued till about the year of the city 388, when
the tribunes of the people proffered a law, that there should be ten men
elected for this service, part out of the nobility, and part out o( the commons.
We meet with the Decemviri.'all along Crom hence, till ·about the time of
Sylla the dictator, when the Q.uindecemviri occur. · It were needless to give
any Carther account of the· Sibyls, than that they are generally agreed to
have been ten in. number; for which w~ have the authority of Varro;
though some make them nine, some four, some three, and some only one.
They all lived in different ages and countries, were all prophet~ses ; and,
according to common upini~n, foretold the coming of our Saviour. As to
the writing, Dempster tells us, it was on Jin.en.
Solinus acquaints us, that the books wJiich Tarquin bought, were burnt
in the conllagration of the capitol, the y~ar before Sylla's dictatorship. Yet
there were others of their inspired writings, or at least copies or extracts of
them, gathered up in Greece and other parts, upon a special search made by
order of the senate; which were kept with the same care as the former, till

the priest shall not add to, nor diminish from, what he findeth to be the true
answer to the question asked, as in this ROLL OF MAN'S FATE con-
tained: neither shall he substitute one answer for·another, but in all things
he shall do according to the·instructions herein given.
The highest among the Gods, in like way, ordaineth, that no bribe, nor
private gift, shall be offered or taken, either by the indiyidual who enquireth,
or by the priest who maketh answer to the consultation : let the gift, which
is to be offered·; be of free will, and let it be put upon the altar after the sa-
crifice hath been consumed, in the face of all the people. ·If herein the
priests offend, they shall, on tho instant, b,e struck down and pinioned to the
earth by the pietcing and fiery arrows which the. great Os1R1s i~ his anger,
speaking from the clouds, hurJeth at offending mortals.-Look to .it. that in
this, ye offend not.
It is further enjoined that ye take strict charge of this book; that no one
but the priest11 do touch it with their hands, and that it be preserved in a
chest of alabaster, to be placed under the altar in the midst of the temple.
It is in like way commanded that copies of the book be written as occasion
requireth, and that they be transmitted unto the priests of the other temples
throughout the'earth: also that they be depo1Jited in the tombs of the Kurns
and of the HIGH Pa1ESTS, as followeth :__;

xxv,iii. THE WBITIN& or BALASPIS
When the body hath been embalmed and sufficiently swathed in fine
cloth, let the roll of writing be placed under the left breast, and let the vest·
ment be bound over it, so that it shall be covered close and hid from view.
The body shall then be attended by the princes and priests and people to
the place of sepulture, where it is to be interred With honour ;-a strong and
durable building bieng raised on the top thereof.
HOW THE ENQUIRER SHALL OBTAlN A TRUE ANSWER
TO THE QUESTION WHICH' IJE l'UTTETH TO THE ORACLE.
When a man or woman doth come to enquire ought of you, 0 Priests !
let the gifts be made and the sacrifices oft"ered up ; and let the invocations of
the servants of the temple be chaunted. .
When silence hath been restored, the D1vINF.1l shall direct the stranger
who hath come to enquire of the ORACLE, to trace, with a reed dipged in
the blood of the sacrifice, in the midst of a circle containing the twelve
SIGNS OF THE ZODIAC,• five rows of u~right or inciined lines, in the manner
following I I I I I I I I I I I I I'. I I , taking care that each be readi-
ly seen to contain more than twelve H~s, in respect of the number of the
Sw~s OF THE ZODIAC, bu~ he must by no means do this studiously, or
count the number he hath marked, but guide the reed quickly, so that the
number, while it-be more than twelve, ~all be entirely of chance, as far as
he knoweth.
The DIVINER shall nqw reckon from the left unto the right hand line of
of each row, which the enquirer hath written, marking oft" twelve; thus :
I I I I I I I I I I I I , I I I and keeping cou~t of the remainder, so
that he may know whether the remaining number of each be odd or evm.
If the number of a row be odd, the DIVINER shall attach to the right hand
, side thereof one sm~ll star, and if it be even, he shall attach two stars; and in
. the same manner with the other rows, as herein set down,:-
I I I I rI I I I I I t. 1 I I

This double column of stan shall be, to the D1vno:R, for a SIGN whereby
.he shall be enabled to discover the fate of the ENQUIRER. _
Let the ENQUIRER now consult his own breast what he requireth to
know; and whether the matter cometh within compass o( the question
h~rein wri1, and set down in order, as followeth.*-If it doth, the Enquirer
shall straightway pronounce the queslion, audibly as it is written, without
adding to, or diminishing therefrom, and shall while he uttereth the words,
point to the number of the questions with the forefinger of bis left hand.
The D1v1NER, in his proper vestments, having invoked Osia1s, shall now
place the forefinger of bis _
right hand on the spot whereon the ENQUIRER
had previously placed the same finger of his left: he shall then search out
among the SmNs, or columns of stan, ·placed above the hieroglyphics, for
that individual SIGN, or column, which shall answer in every respect to the
one which hath been cast up, by the addition of the lines previously traced
by the ENQUIRER.
. When the D1v1NER hath found the corresponding S1GN, or column of
stars, he,must place thereon the forefinger of his left hand; he shall now
move this finger, and likewise the same finger of the right hand, from the
points whereon they have been placed, so that they may approximate, or
meet e,ach other, at right angles. .
The HIEROGLYPHIC whereat the fingers meet, must' now he noted; and
the DIV.INER, hav+ng looked into the roll, is therein to search out the coun-
terpart Qf the same HIEROGLYPHIC.
Having found it, he ia to search further on the left hand side of the
matter, or answen, appended unto this hieroglyphic for the coiintcrpart of
the StGN, or column of stars, which, in the commencf.ment ofthe coMulta-
tion, had incidentally, OR BY THE ORDINATION OF FATE, been produced by
the enumeration of the surplus oYer twelve; of the lines traced by the
ENQUIRER within the circle.
The words attached.to the S1GN, or column of stars, will be the just and
' true answer to the queation put ; which see no one.do pervert to any false
purpose of deceit, enmity or wickedness.
]S"o further ceremony now,remaineth, but that the.PRIEST who hath act~d
in the divination, do write dow.ll th& answer truly, and, with his finger placed
upon his lips, hand it unto the PaOPllllT pr PaoPHETEBS, who shall in a loud;
voice proclaim its-coptents unto the penon who came to enquire.t
common ink. As to the gifts, sacrifices, and invocations, he considersthemin a.Chriatian
land to be entirely superiluous; but in theirStead it is doubtless requisite thatthe colllllllter
should have a firm reliance on 1he goodness and providence of the Creator ofall things.

lllllli• THE WRITING OF BALASPIS
In conclusion, I am commanded to write unto you, that it is the duty o(
the PRIESTS to instruct all those who consult the ORACLE, that it behoyeth
them to be .contented with whatever ANSWER, they may through FATE
receive; and to follow implicitly, and without reservation, whatever the
ORACLE, in its Answers, may happen to dictate. If the instructions of IIER-
MES be not obeyed, what booteth it to enquire 1-If the CONSULTER. be
herein disobedient to the will of Os1R1s, the evil be upon his own head.
Further, 0 PRIESTS ! be warned to make no divination, nor to admit of
any gift, sacrifice or consultation, save during the night season, and that too,
only whilst Isis shiueth in the fulness of her beauty.• Neither shall ye give
Answers on those days or nights. in which either Osrn1s who ruleth the hea-
vens by day, or the Queen of his love, who ruleth by night, do veil the
comeliness and majesty of their countenances from the eyes of mortals, and
whilst they do retire from the labours of their celestial course, whithiu the
chambers of their sanctuary of rest.f
·--- - ----------
sary here to state one example. I shall take the same rows oflines, and the same ~IGN,
or double columuofstars, as are set down in the original instruc&fons for consultation, as
above. We shall suppose, then, that the QuESTION asked is No. 27, as marked in the
Frontispiece or TABLE, viz: Shall my intended jourmy be pro•perou• or unlucky?
Bylooking at the column ofstars, or SiaN, corresponding with that caat up we shall find
it numbered 20, a;id the consequent HIEROGLYPHIC p;'()duced by the combination ofthis
SmN and the QUESTION asked, will be that of the CRoss BoNEs.
Now by reference to this H1EROGLYPHIC and its subservient SmN, or column of stars,
in the Book of Fate, (folio 14) we fin.i that the ANswn ginn b) the Oracle is" When
thou hast arrived at thy place ofdestination, lose no time iu exeeuting thy errand, and
return without delay," which ANSWER, whilort it suggests a necessary caution, whereby
evil or danger is avoided, perfectly corresponds with the QUESTION asked.
I
In a similar way, appropriate AlfsWERS will be given to all the other QUESTIONS in the
TABLE; that is, by paying Attention to their particular HIEROGLYPHICS and SIGNS,
N. B. The Translator considers it proper to state, that in order to faciliate the search
for the Hieroglyp1llc (r.isulting from the combination ofthe QUESTION and SIGN,) in the
BooK OF FATE. it will be necessary for the CONSULTER to east his eye over the highest
line ofliieroglyphicsjn the FRONTISPIECE, and to note the NUMBER which lies immedi-
ately otier it. This number will be found to correspond with thai, folio ofthe BooK or
FATE, over which presides the 1li6roglyphic in question.
· * I presume that here the meaning ef BALAsns, is, that the Oracle should not be con-
sulted but when the MooN is at the rwi Among the ancient Egyptians Isis typified the
Moon, whilst the name ofOslRls was always given to the Sun.
t By this mode ofexpression, it is evident that eclipses of the Sw aud MOO!' are .
meant; But it is neceaMry to notice, that, 88 far 88 the experience ofthe tranalator and
his friends hu enabled them to judge, there is no apparent reason or neceaeity for con-

fining the consultation ofthe Oracle to any particular tune or season. Onething, however,
the Consulter should be aware of, which is, that it would be improper for him to uk

THE BOOK OF FATE: 5
....
Thy dream sayeth be diligent in thy business.
, Mankind are often the arbiters of tliefr--o-wil fortunes; be honest,
and Jail not to take advantage·of every circumstance which may
improve thine. ·
Destroy the seeds of vice, and implant those of virtue in the minds
of thy ch~ldreo, and happiness will be the certain issue.
Bethink thee whe~her thou oughtest now to marry•
Constancy on thy part will m·eet a due return.
When the. object is accomplished, the trave'ller will assuredly
return. ,
A colo!ly of outcasts will break their chains, and obtain grea,t
dominion.
Let not the loss of this thing pre1S heavily on_thy mind.
Rely not on those self-styled friends, who, like summer flies: buzz
about thee in thy prosperity. ·
A cottage and content give more enjoyment than the prllicely
palace of the overturner of kingdoms.

THE BOOK OF FATE.
The legacy that ~haH be bequeathed unto thee, will not much
profit thee, if thou spendest it foolishly•
Lose not thy all by rash speculation !
Be not servile in adYersity, nor despotic in thy prosperity.
yea ! if thou dost steadily ovoid the ha~nts or dissipation.
Better even sleep away thy time, than spend it in ruining thyself
or others.
Endeavour to settle all differences in a private manner.
Venture thyself on the ocean without fear.
The wicked old mau is a very wretch, who tastes of hell before
hi~ time. Wouldest thou be aged and wicked too 1 Go to! rather
let the 11apling wither, than the tree he rotten !
Visit the captive, who is in affliction ; but his woes will soon be
turned into joy.
Thou shalt marry a very worthy personage, who' will inherit con-
siderable property. · .
As the protecting oak is encircled hy the tender ivy, so shall a
numerous race of sons and daughteril claim thy paternal reg_ard•
Thy friend is in good health, at the present time; he is in the act
of bestowing charity•
Act with caution, and thou shalt undoubtedly triumph ov..cr a pcnv-
crful enemy.
Obtain an insight into two trades in which the hands are princi-
pally employed ; re.fleet on both for a week,. and follow that of
which thpu dreamest.
Be as industrious as thou art now covetous, and great riches will
be thy re,vard.
Be not aft'ected by the petty inconveniences \vhich thou mayest
meet with; else, if thou shouldest be beset with real dangers, thou
shalt not have courage to face them.

Be not intoxicated with good fortune at first :-this is the bait
which is thrown out by the gamester to allure his prey.
If thou art cozened out of thy upper garment, throw not thy
under one away, to recover it.
Let not thy inordinate desire of amassing wealth carry thee wto
foreign climes.
Desire not to attain old age, if thy mind be not well stored with
knowledge :-no wretch is so truly wretched as the ignorant old
man.
'
Some one will pity and release t!ie prisoner.
You will have every cause to love your partner.
A numerous offapring will be born unto thee :-if thou trainest
them properly, their virtues will'reward thy anxious toil.
Thy friend is free from all bodily affiicpon, and expecteth to re-
ceive a letter or news from thee.
In a contest which may soon take place, thou shalt be victorious
over thine avowed enemies.
Thou wouldest cut but a sorry fir;ure in the pulpit.
Snatch not at shadows; for thou mayest thereby _lo~e tht sub-
stance.
If thou meetest danger; face it boldly, and be not daunted by
appearances.
Fear not that a11otber will supplant thee in the affections of the
beloved of thy 1oul.
The patient's mind must not b~ aftl.ieted by doleful intelligence•
Peace, plenty and happiness, will attenl,i thy marriage with the
beloved of thy heart.
Deal openly, prudently, and honestly, and ]hou mayest defy the
breath of the slanderer. ,

On the Science of Foretelling Eventa and Charactera ·by fhe Signa of
the Zodiac and tM Planetary Syatem.
Tai: period or our birth is generally marked with 1ome peculiar circum-
1tances that have a visible eft"ect on the future conduct or our lives, our
passions, and our general character. or these circumstances none llppear
more worthy our attention than the situation or the planets at tJ>- moment
wheu we first respire the breath of life; 1ince Crom a jndiciou" ud accurate
observation of.their position at that awful time which bring• Ui into a varied
scene oftrouble and confusion, may be easily gathered wbat kind ofexistence
our destiny has decreed for us; what propensities will distinguish our career;
· what pursuits will mark our way, and whet success we may reasonably ex-
pect to attend our exertions. Thus, an education suited to our particular
genius and talents may be given us, and we may thereby be enabled to turn
many of those distinguishing peculiarities, which more or less stamp all the
beings or the human species, to our admntage and happinua, that withont
this neceuary information, might become the sources of ourWRETCHED-
NESS and MISERY.

tho sun is the most powerful and conspicuous, we shall proceed to mark his
way through the dilferent signs of the Zodiac, and show the effect of his •
revolutions, begi!1qiog, for the sakei of enabling opr rea~rs more readily to
find what they may want, with tho month of J«tiue.ry, although the'ancients '
began their year in March.
AQUARIUS.-(Water IJeaTer.)
About tho twentieth of January t)Je s1111 enters this sign; a man born at

THE IlOOK OF FA'l'E. 7
It will be here necessary to observe, that the dispositions and events we
have mentioned will be more forcible in proportion to the progress the sun
has made,in the sign; and that they will be considerably altered by a junc-
tion of any ol the other planets in the sign with the sun ; as their motion is
very unequal, we can only lay down the general influence they have,
leaving it to the jadgment of the reader to apply them ; we shall here lay
down a plan by which they will be enabled to ascertain what planet was
mostly in conjunction with the. sun at the time of their birth. When you
have ascertainfl<l positively the month and the day, examine your own dis-
position, and that with strict impartiality, neither attributing to yourself
virtmis you do not possess, nor ascribing to yourself vices to which you are
not addicted. Separate all your qualities in your mind, and try which of
them· has the greatest sway, by this means you will easily discover what
. planet was predominant at the time of your birth from what we are going
to describe of them and their influence over human nature.
SATURN
Is the most malignant of all the planets;and is thirty years passing 'through
the twelve signs, thus it happens very rarely that the sun enters the same
sign with him, at the saine time, which is absolutely necessary to give an
influence over him. This may be deemed a very fortunate ci~cumstance for
mankind, as persons who are born under his influence are morose, sour,
tyrannical, cruel and bloody in their dispositions, given to murder and rob-
bery, in short worse than savages. Whenever blood is wantonly shed, or
murder is attended with any shocking barbarity, you may be well assured
that Saturn presided at the birth of those who perpetrated· such foul deeds,
it being the character of this planet.
JUPll'ER
Is twenty-three months in performing his revolution through the 1igns ;
his conjunction with the sun therefore happens but seldom ; those born
under this planet are remarkable for their ungovernable ambition, to gratify
which they would trample down the lives and fortunes oftheir fellow crea-
tures without remorse, and sever the dearest and most tender ties which
nature has given to man.

8 THE BOOK OF FATE:
MARS
Is al~o twenty-three months journeying through the signs; persons bom
under the influence of this planet, who seldom "comes in conjunction with
the sun, are remarkable for their desire of glory, and the r,cputation of being
courageous. Thus it is that men frequently destroy.their fellow-creatures
to satisfy their idle appetites, and acquire a reputation for what they falsely
conceive to be courage and glory.
VENUS
Is the most benignant of all the planets, she presides over, and inspires ·
that secret desire, that natural impulse which pervades all creatures to pro-
pagate their !tpecies, than which nothing can give so pure, so durable, aud
such frequent transport to the thinkiirg mind ; that inspiration to love each
other which is found in. the sexes, entirely on her constant attendance on
t~e sun. ' 'Without Venus, a tiresome and stupifying apathy would <liffuse
itself over the whole creation ; h is to .her benign an<l maternal influence
that is owing the existence of that desire that constantly urges us to seek in
' ea;h other the comforts of which no individual is capable of finding in him-
self, and it is her alone that keeps this vivifying spark alive· in the, human
breast. Her mildness restrains and ameliorates the rugged suggesti~s of
the other planets; it is thus that frequently we witness the ambitious man
losing sight of his object, and retiring to enjoy the exquisite bliss which a
\ iudiciously selected female alone can bestow; thus we see the hardy auJ
veteran soldier, after the fatigues of battle, solacing himself iu the em-l:races.
of a favorite female companion ; thus we see the miser, whose very soul is
'1bsorhed in the treas11re, and who deprives himself of every comfort and
necessary of life, under the benign influence of this planet, suffering a be-
loved woman to bring forth his boards, and uul!1tk those chests that the
calls of his own· nature and the diatresses of bis fellow creatures, essayed to
open in vain ; in short, every bliss of which the lover partakes, is owing to
the inftuence of this planet, who happily for mankind is found frequently in
conjunction with the genial sun. Venus may with great trutb be said to
light the torch of Hymen.
MERCURY.
Is equally benignant with Venus, but hath a dift'ereot influence over men :·
be is the sma's constant companion, and it is to him that we are indebted for
wit, memory, understanding. vivacity, ans health; but for the predomi-
nance of some other planet less favorable to man, we should enjoy a state
of uninterrupted happiness, be equal in privileges, and be in continued
felicity from the inftueoce of this beneficent state.
THE MOON'
Performs her journey throug~ the signs in about thirty-eight days; when
she has the superiority at the birth of an infant, he is dull, inactive, heavy,

frigid, ins6nsible to those scenes that take place around him, his blood cir-
eulates feebly through his veins, he is a stranger to the joys of love, and
nothing but the irreaistible power of Venus can arouse him from his lethargy,
or set his passions afloat ; when lie sacrifices to the hymenial altar, he does
it- more after the manner of a brute than a human being, incapable bf sin-
cere attachments ; he is like a blank in tha universe, neither enjoyi1
ng
himself nor promoting the enjoyment of othera.
