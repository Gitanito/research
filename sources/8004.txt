The park was closed for repairs - it was just in front of the apartment-building where I lived with my parents and sister. That day, when I went out to play with a friend, a girl, my dad warned us not to go into the park to play because it could be dangerous, but my friend and I disobeyed his order and went in there to play. I was worried that we could be seen from the window of my home.  I went on playing on a set of chains, which were hanging from a pole and where several children and I grabbed on to them and swung round it. Suddenly, my friend and the other kids unhooked themselves and ran off, leaving me still circulating and being entangled in the other chains, which struck me on the head and body.

I felt no pain, everything went dark all of a sudden and I found myself ascending a tunnel at great speed. At its end, there was light, but I never got that far. I heard someone's voice from behind me calling me by name repeatedly. I opened my eyes quickly and found myself on the ground, on the cement area where the pipe, which held the chains, was inserted. My friend was calling me from outside the park gate, urging me to get out because the security guard was coming. What I will never forget is the feeling of peace and tranquility I had for the rest of the evening.  It was a state of peace that I have never in my life felt again. Although I'm sure my dad saw me fall, he never said anything to me. In addition, I don't know how long it can have been from the time I fell until I opened my eyes and saw my friend calling me. I don't know if this would be an NDE, but I will never forget that moment in the tunnel and the peace that I felt afterwards.
