in 1964 Soviet astronomer Nikolai
Kardashev proposed a hypothetical scale
of measuring a civilizations level of
technological advancement based on the
amount of energy they&#39;re able to utilize
a level one civilization also called the
planetary civilization can use and store
all the energy available on this planet
at that point their main focus becomes
the development of higher states of
consciousness because they have all the
technologies to meet everyone&#39;s needs
there&#39;s no shortage their economic
system is not economic in the sense that
there is a infinite abundance for
everyone because of these technologies
that can materialize things out of the
substrate of space-time the elementals
of space-time so at that point a
civilization becomes really focused on
the development of higher states of
consciousness and as they evolve in
consciousness their technologies of all
with them they will begin to then unfurl
the mysteries of consciousness in these
cities I mentioned earlier in the Vedas
but those get applied technologically
which include levitation teleportation
dematerialization by location where the
same object can be instantly resonantly
created and be in two places at once
we&#39;ve had this happen on our team
