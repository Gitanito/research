After the birth, I had intense pains in the chest.  General panic surrounding me.  Then nothing anymore.  Then I found myself above the table.  An intense light; I heard everything that was said; I witnessed my own resuscitation.

I saw my body bouncing with the electric shocks.  Doctors were talking between each other, 'Do you think it will get back?'  'I'm afraid this will not happen!'

I didn't see my daughter I just had birthed, but I knew that she was there beside me.

A last shock was shaking my body and then I don't remember anything else.

I woke up connected everywhere, with plenty of people around me.  I never dared to talk to anybody about this, except to my husband the day of the first anniversary of my daughter, when my husband told me that I had a severe cardiac arrest.

I had many after-effects that subsided with time.
