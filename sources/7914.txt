In the morning, we got up early and had to drive approx. 50 miles to Logansport (where the dive was to take place).  At age 19, I was very cocky and in my physical prime.  Since I was ''such a man'', I chose not to wear my wetsuit. (after all, the water is warm in May, isn't it?).By the end of the first dive, (and having eaten no food that morning, my body had burnt up all stored calories trying to stay warm,) so I fainted in 30 feet of water.

My dive partner was unable to help me as I started to panic when I realized, (very briefly) my predicament. I remember making the decision to start swallowing water quickly to get dying over with.  I found myself walking on solid ground, in a very bright cloudy atmosphere, and being attracted to one point in particular. (This was not the source of the light, necessarily, but I just felt compelled to go to this one point.  I had a very brief thought for the loved ones behind me, but I instinctively knew they would be o.k., and I gave them no further thought.  At no time did I see my life ''flash before me.''  I found myself at an open doorway, in a white (or light-colored) ''wall''. 

Starting into this doorway, (which was approx. in a wall approx. 20 inches deep, I saw 3 ladies, each with ''Mona Lisa smiles.'' one lady was forward of the other 2,and while no words were spoken, I had the distinct impression they knew me.  These ladies were in long white robes.  I felt warm, and completely at peace. I have never felt so much ''love''.  I remember (still in the doorway,) looking to the left, and seeing another doorway, and suddenly feeling that ''beyond that door, is the answer to all questions!''  As I started to enter the room with the women, the first woman communicated to me that although this is the right place, it just is not the time for me yet. Her Mona Lisa smile did not change, but I felt an emotion from her that she hoped I understood I was just ''not being allowed to enter yet.''

I was overwhelmed by a crushing sadness, but resigned myself to the fact that ''they knew what they were talking about. (talking!?).  With great sadness, I looked at the ladies a last time, and making a conscious decision to turn away from them, I woke up in a bed(2 days later), at Methodist hospital's intensive care unit, in Indianapolis, where I found my mother sitting at my bedside.  I asked where the women were, and of course this made no sense whatsoever.  

Since then, I have never been in such bright,'' clean'' light, as during that experience, and while I was already religious, I feel I have been given an insight into the ''real'' values in this life. I do not crave physical possessions, and am convinced suicide is not an option. (if so, what would the ladies have told me, had I taken the decision out of their hands?)
