    Summary:&nbsp;  From Pat Deveney's database:

 Magickal Link, The.
 Official Monthly Bulletin of Ordo Templi Orientis.
 Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law
 1981--2003  Monthly (irregular)
 Berkeley, CA. 
 Editor: The Caliph (Grady Louis McMurtry); various editors. 
 Corporate author:  Thelema Lodge, O.T.O.  1/1, January 1981-2003(?)  6-12 pp., varies.

  Approximately 113 issues appeared; issues beginning in 1987 were called "new series" with restarted volume and issue numbering.  This was originally produced from typescript and then typeset and printed.  This was the organ of McMurtry's Thelema Lodge in Berkeley, the Gnostic  Catholic Church, and of the O.T.O. of which he was O.H.O.  It was not intended to replace the O.T.O. Newsletter which McMurtry also published.  Each issue contained a calendar of "events at the Thelema Lodge" in Emeryville (e.g., "Gnostic Mass and Saturnalia.  $1.00 donation Suggested").  He and his (sometime) wife had earlier published in In The Continuum.  University of Texas, Austin; LOC; University of London, Warburg; Northwestern University.
