Sir William Fletcher Barrett F.R.S
——•——
Sir William Fletcher Barrett, F.R.S., was
born in Jamaica, on February 10, 1844
and died suddenly of heart failure on
May 26, 1925.
In the first issue of Psypioneer, May
2004, Leslie Price opened with the
headline: “S.P.R. was Conceived by a
Spiritualist” quoting from Edmond
Dawson Rogers’ posthumously
published Memoirs,1
and asking who
was the founder of the SPR. “Rogers or
Barrett?” 2
Later in Psypioneer October 2008, I
picked up on the story with “The Grave
of William Stainton Moses” and “The
Society for Psychical Research,
officers and council for 1882”.3
Below, the history of the foundation of
the SPR is told by Sir William Barrett in
his own words.

THE EARLY YEARS OF
PSYCHICAL RESEARCH
LIGHT:—5
By SIR WILLIAM BARRETT, F.R.S.
I am very glad LIGHT has published those most interesting memories of my old friend
Mr. Dawson Rogers. In its issue for March 15th, Mr. Rogers gives his recollection of the
origin of the Society for Psychical Research which with the following slight exception—I
can corroborate.
Mr. Rogers states that about 1882 or the end of 1881, when I was visiting him he
suggested to me “that a Society should be started on lines which would be likely to attract
some of the best minds which had hitherto held aloof from the pursuit of the enquiry” [into
psychical phenomena]. He adds that I approved of the suggestion and called a conference
for the purpose. The fact is long before I visited Mr. Rogers, Mr. F. W. H. Myers had
discussed with me the possibility of obtaining the co-operation of leading Spiritualists in
the psychical investigations we were both pursuing, and in which Professor and Mrs. H.
Sidgwick for some time previously had also been engaged. Myers was aware that I had
been contributing papers on Spiritualism to LIGHT and to the “Psychological Review” for
October 1881, which brought me into contact with the Editor, the Rev. Stainton Moses, and
also with Mr. Dawson Rogers and Mr. C. C. Massey. In a letter from Stainton Moses to me
dated August, 1881 (which I happen to have kept) he refers to the subject and to my letter
in the scientific journal, “Nature”—giving the first intimations of thought transference, in
the normal state of the percipient.
The numerous experiments I made with many different persons both in England and
Ireland had convinced me that a real “transfusion of thought” (as I expressed it in 1881)
occurred between one person and another without the aid of the usual sensory channels. In
an article in the “Psychological Review” for 1881, I described these experiments, but no
scientific society would publish my paper on the subject, as it involved a transcendental or
supersensuous faculty. Hence it became necessary to found a new Society to record and
investigate psychical phenomena.
Shortly after this I asked Stainton Moses if he would co-operate with Myers and myself
and others if a Psychical Society on scientific lines were formed. He agreed and suggested
my consulting Dawson Rogers, and that was the main object of my visit to Mr. Rogers’
house at Finchley a little later.
In his “Human Personality,” Vol. 2; p. 224, Myers has correctly stated the facts as
follows:—
5
LIGHT, June 21, 1924 page 395.
205
When in 1882 [this should be the latter end of 1881] Professor Barrett
consulted him [Rev. Stainton Moses] as to the possibility of founding a new
Society, he [Stainton Moses] warmly welcomed the plan. Edmund Gurney and I
were asked to join.
They heartily co-operated together with Professor H. Sidgwick, who consented to be
the first President.
The preliminary conference, as Mr. Dawson Rogers remarks:—
… was held at the rooms of the British National Association of Spiritualists
in January, 1882. At that meeting, Mr. Stainton Moses, Mr. C. C. Massey, Mr.
F. W. H. Myers, Mr. J. G. Romanes, myself [Dawson Rogers] and others were
present.
I was asked to preside, and Mr. Rogers arranged for a shorthand report of the meeting,
which was taken, and I hope some day may be recovered and published; for the discussion
was a most interesting one and some able speeches wore made by Sidgwick, Myers,
Romanes, Roden Noel, Mrs. Anna Kingsford and others.
Mr. Rogers not only provided the rooms, but defrayed the cost of the shorthand reporter
and of printing the notices convening the meeting which were sent out in my name and
which read as follows:—
Private and Confidential.
18, Belgrave Square,
Monkstown, Dublin.
December, 1881.
It is proposed to hold a Conference of friends interested in Spiritualism and
Psychological Research, during the first week in January, to compare notes, talk
over the present condition of affairs, suggest lines of work, and consider the
advisability of having a select Central Society organised, under some such name
as the London Psychical Society.
The Conference will be held, by the kind permission of the Council of the
B.N.A.S., at their rooms, 38, Great Russell-street, Bloomsbury, on January 5th
and 6th next, at four p.m. May I ask for your attendance?
Yours truly,
W. F. BARRETT.
Many of the replies to three notices I have kept as they are of considerable interest,
coming from eminent and representative men such as the late Lord Houghton, General Pitt
Rivers, Mr. J. G. Romanes, F.R.S., etc. The numerous letters of Romanes to me on the
206
subject are worth publishing, and as his widow informs me that she has no objection to this,
I hope some opportunity may be afforded for their publication.
I have before me a letter which Stainton Moses wrote to me on January 12th, 1882, in
which he says:—
When yon invited me to attend a Conference, my first impulse was to
decline, not from lack of interest, as you know, but because I believed the
disintegrating forces to be insuperable. Socially I thought that such men as you
and I would desire to see governing a Society and directing its aims, would not
find themselves able to act with the average B.N.A.S. man; ... and two societies
existing side by side would be mutually injurious to each other’s interests. What
I feared is coming to pass. The B.N.A.S. people will never amalgamate with the
S.P.R. They will, I think, refuse to make the attempt. If they do make it there
will be a house divided.
They did, however, make the attempt, and their leaders, Stainton Moses, Dawson
Rogers, C. C. Massey, Morell Theobald, Alexander Calder, F. W. Percival, Hensleigh
Wedgwood, and other Spiritualists were elected on the first S.P.R. Council together with
Myers, Gurney, Balfour Stewart and myself, with Professor H. Sidgwick as the President.
Unfortunately acute differences of opinion arose after a year or two, and though Myers
and myself did our best to reconcile the opposing points of view, it was impossible, to do
so—especially after an unfortunate report on a poltergeist case, which I believe Andrew
Lang subsequently showed to be inaccurate. Accordingly, Stainton Moses, C. C. Massey,
Dawson Rogers, and others—with whom some of us were in close sympathy—left the
Council and the Society, to our great regret.
Much the same conflict of opinion is now occurring in the American S.P.R. and the
moral of our experience here suggests the advice I have ventured to give our American
friends, vis., to recognise that there must always be a conflict of opinion between those who
have had first hand knowledge of genuine successful psychical phenomena, and those who
have not, but who are interested and may be valuable critics, Hence a right and left wing of
our and their Society must necessarily exist.
Here I may add that before the S.P.R. was founded not only Professor and Mrs.
Sidgwick but Frederic Myers and myself had spent laborious hours investigating various
mediums in London, Dublin and different parts of England. My paper at the British
Association in 1876 brought me into touch with Frederic Myers whom I first met when
staying with his gifted mother in Cheltenham.
I have before me some interesting letters from Frederic Myers dated 1877 and 1878, in
which he reports to me his investigation of certain mediums. If LIGHT had space to
publish these letters they would show the zealous and open-minded way in which Myers
sympathetically and yet critically investigated every medium to whom he could get access.
I was then in Dublin and had asked Myers if he could see Mr. Henley at Notting Hill and
207
others of whom I had received encouraging reports. He found Mr. Henley an enthusiast, not
quite trustworthy as to his facts, but honest. He saw a Miss B (now Mrs.—) and found her
and Miss T.—both reputed to be good clairvoyants—to be wanting, the former he thought
fraudulent. Then Myers relates that he visited the medium Cain at Bow and found him “an
entirely trustworthy man, a bluff old soldier.” He sat with the family circle but no striking
phenomena occurred; however, Myers narrates some really remarkable physical
phenomena that occurred with Cain’s little daughter before his arrival and which he
thought were genuine. Myers adds: “I will go to Hastings shortly and investigate the case
you have sent me if you will give me an introduction to the lady.” In reply to a letter in
which I asked his views as to the most efficient way of making the facts of psychical
research known to the scientific public, he says in a letter dated October, 1877, that he has
talked the matter over with Henry Sidgwick and urges our friends to make personal inquiry
and suggests that if I wrote an article on the subject both he and Sidgwick would gladly
read it over and make suggestions.
Here perhaps I may be forgiven the egotism of adding a later letter from Frederic Myers
to me dated February 2nd 1899:—
My Dear Barrett,
Bennett will have informed you officially that the Council of the S.P.R.
unanimously elected you a successor to Gladstone as Honorary Member; but I
want to add my personal expression of pleasure at having been able to take part
in the well-earned compliment. May your name long stand on our front page!
The front page of the Society which you more than anyone, founded.
Yours ever,
F. W. H. MYERS.
Though it is true I happened to be instrumental in founding the S.P.R., yet, as everyone
knows, the high position it has won and the success it has achieved, is largely due to the
three great pillars built on its foundation—Sidgwick, Myers and Gurney. It would be an
impertinence on my part to add anything to the noble tributes that have been paid to their
memory and their labour.
——•——

Afterword:
Trevor Hamilton, biographer of Myers,6
kindly commented to Psypioneer.
“The replies are included in the Barrett papers SPR.MS.3/A2. 27 replies, I think, and from
my notes I couldn't find Myers, Gurney, Sidgwick's replies in them. I think they were
cautious and, as you know, not prepared to go forward without Sidgwick.
In his unpublished autobiography Myers Box 26/63/44 Myers clearly stated that the
telepathy, etc. side of things led by Barrett’s work was what revived Sidgwick’s and
Gurney’s interest but that he, in his heart, hoped that he might get admission to private
Spiritualist sittings which would be superior to the professional/semi professional seances
that had so disappointed him and his colleagues.
Using the excellent SPR online library, one notes that Fraser Nicol, Inglis, and Alvarado
(review of Haynes SPR book) have all gone into this, as well as an outline in my book and
more details in Alan Gauld’s Founders.7
I give references to PhD theses by Noakes and Williams in my book which also cover this
but they broadly reflect the above view except that Noakes rather stresses Barrett’s
isolation by geography, philosophy (pro Home Rule etc) etc from the Cambridge group:
Perhaps exaggerates this? Certainly both Myers and Mrs Sidgwick stressed Barrett’s role
rather than Dawson Rogers’ (who, however, provided a lot of organisational help at the
very beginning). I rather think the idea was in the air from several sources in 1881 and
from several different perspectives. But the core quickly, and quite rightly, became the
Cambridge group.
I have never come across a shorthand report of the meeting.
Peter Hallson wrote an account of the origins of the SPR in Paranormal Review in 2002.
Janet Oppenheim said that Barrett eventually acknowledged that the original impulse came
from Dawson Rogers (137) though Barrett’s energy was important. She mentions the
replies to Barrett’s circular were fascinating. Moses, I think, was quite right about the
social and intellectual barriers to overcome at that time. Re Sidgwick as President—in his
draft autobiography Myers mentions that Wallace was against Sidgwick leading the society
and Cerullo hints that Rogers/Barrett debated this issue of leadership for some time.”

NEW, ANNOTATED EDITION
OF ART MAGIC RELEASED
The Typhon Press: News Release—For
Immediate Release July 21, 2011 Company: The
Typhon Press Contact: Marc Demarest Phone:
503-804-5800
The Typhon Press announced the immediate
availability of its newest title, an annotated edition of
Emma Hardinge Britten's classic occult text, Art
Magic.
First published in 1876, Art Magic is one of the
founding documents of the Victorian occult revival.
Published under mysterious circumstances, the book
was controversial in its own day, and has intrigued
and infuriated students of the occult for nearly 150
years. Regarded for years merely as a supplement to
the more famous Ghost Land (1876), this new
edition of Art Magic demonstrates clearly that Art
Magic is actually the more important work: closely
connected to the founding and early teachings of the
Theosophical Society, to Helene Blavatsky’s Isis Unveiled (1877), and to the teachings of
the Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor, as well as to the work of J. C. Street, R. Swinburne
Clymer and other occult figures.
This definitive, corrected edition of the text fixes errors in the first edition text, and
includes an in-depth bibliographical and historical introduction, as well as extensive
annotations to the text by Marc Demarest, the curator of the Emma Hardinge Britten
Archive.8
The text is available immediately from the Typhon Press web site, and from
CreateSpace,9
and will be available by August 15 from Amazon, the Kindle store, iBooks
and the Barnes and Noble Nook store.
Emma Hardinge Britten (1823-1899) was one of the most influential Spiritualist and
occult propagandists of the nineteenth century. Her work informs modern-day
organizations as diverse as the international Spiritualist movement, the Theosophical
Society, esoteric Freemasonry, and the Church of Light.

LIGHT STILL SHINES
In Psypioneer we often reprint material from LIGHT, which as a newspaper was “The
Times” of Spiritualism. The 1924 article by Sir William Barrett on the origin of the SPR,
which we reprint in this issue, is a typical example. Although we routinely draw attention
both to copyright and to the fact that LIGHT is still published, the latest issue of LIGHT
prompts a fuller note.
LIGHT is the oldest psychic journal. It is older than the Proceedings of the SPR (1882), the
Journal of the SPR (1884) and Two Worlds (1887).
LIGHT often carries material of historical significance; last year, for example, in Vol. 130
No 2, articles about Oliver Lodge and Geraldine Cummins. The latest issue (Vol. 131 No 1
Summer 2011) is no exception. It comes from an editorial board of Brian Adams, Susie
Collings and Max Eames. Tribute is paid to Tina Lawlor-Mottram who edited the previous
issue, the first one ever to appear in colour.
Susie Collings, CPS principal, contributes a report “Synchronicity and Strength of Will; the
College’s Recent Refurbishment” which is illustrated with beautiful photographs. This is
an important account of the history of the building, up to the latest high-tech innovations in
such matters as lighting and water supply. Buildings are a significant part of psychic
history. This report ought especially to be studied by anyone concerned with the
management of such buildings.
The College has renamed what it calls the grand reception room below the Library as “The
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle room”. This is fitting as Sir Arthur served as president and was
one of many noted persons to enter the doors of the 16 Queensberry Place. He might well
have descended to the basement where the LIGHT office once shone.
In another article entitled “From the Archives”, the President Max Eames recalls William
Crookes, especially his investigation of materialisation. This is a reminder that CPS is a
repository for much rare historical material, including unpublished letters from the time of
its foundation as LSA in 1884.

EMMA’S FINEST HOUR?
[Note by LP:—In this issue we are reprinting with slight changes my article about the 1890
Manchester conference, which first appeared in Psychic News. To this Marc Demarest has
kindly added some notes, and a wider comment at the end.]
When someone has many achievements, it can be difficult to identify what was the most
important. In the case of Emma Hardinge Britten, some will point to the foundation of the
weekly newspaper Two Worlds in 1887. Others will single out the transmission of the
Seven Principles which became the legal basis of the SNU. And then there were the
historical works, like Nineteenth Century Miracles (circa 1884).
I should like to choose a conference of Spiritualists which Emma encouraged in 1890. This
conference became an annual event. Eventually the people involved formed the SNU.
It may well be that some of those people wrote down their memories, and that we will
come across them in the pages of an old diary or newspaper. But recently we have been
given an inside view of the 1890 conference as it happened. Marc Demarest (MD) has put
the opening years of Two Worlds on line.11
Initially they were loaded on the Emma
Hardinge Britten site12
but eventually they may transfer to a new site devoted to old
psychic journals.
An excellent account of the 1890 conference was given a century later by Jean Bassett in
the official history of the SNU One Hundred Years of National Spiritualism (1990). Ray
Taylor, then editor of Two Worlds had drawn her attention to the bound volumes of the
newspaper which told the story of the conference.
Perhaps the most interesting document was the actual Proposal for the 1890 conference,
whose oratorical style was typical of Emma’s inspiration. This clearly indicated the
religious inspiration of the project.
The 1880s had been marked by several attempts to organise the paranormal. In 1882,
Stainton Moses and other leading Spiritualists had supported the formation in London of a
Society for Psychical Research, but had soon become disillusioned by the negative tone
sometimes shown in its publications.
In 1884, metropolitan and county Spiritualists had established the London Spiritualist
Alliance whose leadership was moderately Christian, and had no aspiration to set up
separate churches. The LSA is with us today as the College of Psychic Studies in South
Kensington, and remains a major training centre for mediums.
11
They are at:—http://www.ehbritten.org/texts/primary/two_worlds/ and will remain there for the time being.

212
There were other large societies such as the Marylebone Spiritualist Association (founded
in 1872), and many small centres and churches which suffered from their isolation.13
In recent years, the Theosophists had established active Lodges in several British cities, but
their message of course was distinctly unsympathetic to Spiritualism. Emma and her
husband had been founder members of the Theosophical Society in the distant New York
days of 1875. But now they rejected such occult claims.
Most of all, Victorian Britain was controlled by a Christian establishment. Emma clashed
with its spokesmen week by week in Two Worlds.
Emma’s proposal was to “call together in a primary annual moveable conference, the best
and united thoughts of the age on the question of how to carry on the propagandism of pure
practical spiritualism, both in its phenomenal and religious aspects. Also, how we can aid
and improve our local meetings by better methods of awakening our several districts to the
value and importance of our work.”14
Conference was the important word. Once this institution was launched, it gathered to itself
a wide variety of activities.
Whose idea was it? An editorial of July 18 recalled “For many weeks past, a party of some
sixteen spiritualists have met together at the earnest request of Mrs Hardinge Britten, to
consider a plan given to her by the spiritual guides and friends of the higher life, who have
directed her world-wide travels and protected her through the unnumbered trials and
experiences of her past thirty years of public spiritual propagandism.”
Emma gave the names of this council - Dr and Mrs Britten, Mr and Mrs E.W. Wallis; and
Mrs Wilkinson; Messrs J. J. Morse (Liverpool) W Johnson ( Hyde) J.B. Tetlow
(Pendleton), H. Boardman (Openshaw), P. Lee ( Rochdale), Messrs Rayner and J. Gibson
(Oldham), R. Flitton, T. Brown, J. Simkin, and F. Tomlinson (Manchester) “ the latter
gentleman being elected as treasurer, the others in groups as sub-committees on different
departments of use.” We should not forget their joint share in this work, even though
Emma was the most prominent.15
It will be noted that this committee was drawn entirely from one region, NW England, and
nearly all from Manchester. The committee sent out 8000 copies of their circular, hoping to
assess the views of British Spiritualists. There were hundreds of positive responses, and the
conference at the Co-operative Hall, Downing Street Manchester on Sunday July 6 1890,
13
Emma and William were close to the MSA. William was sometimes “in the chair” for their gatherings,
when he was in London, and Emma spoke before them almost every time she went down to London, which
was not all that often. MD
14
The Two Worlds, March 21 1890
15
These folks were almost all within the circle of TW—their names appear there frequently, and some of
them were directors of TW. MD
213
was full. The Yorkshire Federation (of 16 societies) was represented by its secretary, Mr
M. Marchbank, and Mr Wortley represented the London Federation of Spiritualists, not to
be confused with the LSA. James Robertson of Glasgow took part in the debate.16
The religious background of the proceedings was evident. The meeting began with an
invocation from Mrs Britten addressed “To the Father of Spirits, the Lord and Master of
Life”, followed by the first of several hymns. There were also musical interludes.
In her original proposal, Emma had praised Spiritualism as the only religion able to offer
“present practical and undeniable proofs of their affirmations.” These not only confirmed
survival but also knowledge of life’s duties, and the demands of the laws of God, nature
and duty.
She denounced “idealists, cranks, transcendentalists and speculators” who had infiltrated
the movement “to foist their vain theories on the one hand, and their worldly practices on
the other.”
She had particular scorn for orthodoxy.
“Christianity, in its modern form of absurd creeds, antiquated ideas, unworthy conceptions
of the creator, and ridiculous teachings concerning the life hereafter, is simply crumbling
into pieces beneath the analysis of reason, reverence for the grand problems of existence,
and the revealments of creative wisdom in present-day science.”
During the conference, Emma gave an important address on the need for unity about the
basis of spiritualism. (Interestingly, the capitalisation of “Spiritualism” and “Spiritualist”
lay in the future, after a definite platform had been agreed.)
She recalled that when she attended her first séance, “her mind was pervaded by the
doctrines of the Church of England, in the tenets of which she had been educated.” Her
spirit friends had given her a better faith, which she summarised in six doctrines. These
were the later Seven Principles, save only for the omission of the communion of spirits and
ministry of angels.17
She considered this a superhuman rather than human revelation. She asked “that it should
neither be affiliated with man-made creeds, labelled with simply human beliefs, opinions or
unproved revelations, nor be confounded with any sect in existence that did not offer
similar and equally incontrovertible proofs of a supermundane origin and revelation.”
16
Emma had a habit of circularizing the local societies, as with her annual census. MD
17
Indeed, in the Autobiography, she says she ran from this first encounter because she heard, during the
seance, heterodox statements being made, critical of conventional (Anglican) religion. MD
214
The conference was a resounding success; indeed Mr Wortley of London claimed never to
have enjoyed any day so much in his life. Most obviously, the conference continued as an
annual event, growing into a national organisation.
For Emma, sadly, troubles were henceforth to multiply. Marc Demarest is at present
researching the end of her work. She quietly announced her retirement from public
speaking at the 1891 Bradford conference - in the next year; she was deposed from the
editorial chair at Two Worlds for reasons that were obscure.
But Marc Demarest reveals (July 2011) “They are not obscure any more. William Britten,
who was chairman of the board of the Two Worlds Publishing Company, was called to task
by the board for stock manipulation. He had taken in two thousand pounds, in two tranches,
from an anonymous donor ( Countess of Caithness, I believe), along with a few hundred
pounds in “donations”, to prop up TW, which never made any money because it was a
penny paper—the cover price barely covered the cost of production. Instead of putting this
capital into the corporation as ordinary revenue (how that would have been accounted for
in those days, I don’t know), William used at least some of the money to purchase shares in
the corporation under various names (this is where it does get a bit obscure). The goal on
William’s part was control of the Two Worlds Publishing Company. The question, for the
board of TW, was: does this money constitute an investment or a donation? When
challenged on these transactions, William at first declined to provide details, and then
produced a phony proxy from the putative donor, named “Nemo” and witnessed by one
Jabez Sherratt, saying in essence “I own 180 shares of TW and William Britten is my
proxy.” The net effect was that the board invalidated the proxies, changed voting rights so
that INDIVIDUALS rather than SHARES voted, and tossed William out of the company.
William was intemperate in a board meeting. Emma published an equally intemperate
“circular” alleging all sorts of things on the part of the Two Worlds board, and resigned her
editorship. William and Emma then sought a restraining order against the board of the Two
Worlds, in Chancery, and lost. That was the unpleasant end of things. Wallis’ version of
events, substantially correct I think, is in the February 26, 1892 issue of TW.”
Marc concludes “My read of the situation is that the Wallis camp saw Emma largely as an
unwitting/unwilling participant in William’s schemes. They went out of their way at the
time to be kind to her, continued to cover her peregrinations and activities after she left
TW, and welcomed her back as soon as William died in 1894.”
However, an attempt to raise a testimonial for Emma caused such ill-will, that she ordered
it to cease. Her new magazine Unseen Universe (1892) was short-lived. Organisational
bickering developed between the Midlands and London. In 1894, her husband William
Britten died age 74, and by 1897, her own health had broken down.
Marc explains “Keep in mind that she terminated the Unseen Universe for three reasons:
one private (the paper was a money loser) and two public: (1) a decided lack of
organization in English spiritualism (she publishes an article by Hudson Tuttle, someone
with whom she was often at odds, on this topic; and (2) she is going to work on her
Autobiography.
215
Marc continues: It’s an open question how “with it” she was in those last few years, and
whether her sister Margaret Wilkinson wasn’t running the EHB enterprise, day to day. She
gets trotted out for events in Manchester, as some kind of grand old dame, but doesn’t
speak in public much. Some kind of deal is cut for the reprinting of Ghost Land and Art
Magic with the Progressive Thinker: which I have realized of late is *shocking.* The
reason why Emma did not allow those works to be reprinted earlier was simple: they
contained pretty direct evidence that Emma was a proponent of the obsession-by-
elementaries hypothesis…or that the author of Art Magic was, anyway. The only reasons I
can think of why she might have allowed them to be republished in 1898 are: (1) she didn’t
know (Margaret cut the deal) or (2) she didn’t care (she knew her public life was over). I
incline to (1) but it’s just a guess.
Perhaps she looked back wistfully to that perfect July day in Manchester, when there had
been such a sense of harmony. Although the Union was not to be formally constituted until
after she passed in 1899, societies had begun at once to affiliate to the Federation, as it
became known at the 1891 Bradford conference.
Most of the consequences still lay in the future—the hundreds of member churches, the
education schemes, the college for Spiritualists at Stansted, the ordination of Spiritualist
ministers. It was only a later generation that could see the full consequences of Emma’s
1890 proposal.

Afterword by Marc Demarest:
Emma learned about the value of organization early. How early I don’t know. It’s possible
her father Ebenezer was a labor radical of some kind—a Chartist, possibly. I feel—no
evidence to support this—that Ebenezer’s move to Bristol in the late 1820s was a move
motivated by political beliefs. But here’s what’s clear from the documentary record.
(1) Emma, who was the editor of its organ and a test medium under its
auspices, learned a great deal from the collapse of the Society for Diffusion of
Spiritualist Knowledge in NY in 1857 (see Modern American Spiritualism p.
134 for her diagnosis);
(2) Emma is credited with organizing Spiritualism in NY in the late 1850s:
the church (and they called it that) she and Elizabeth J. French started in NY in
1858 is viewed by the secular journalists at the time in the NY papers as being
the *first* formally organized such church in NY.
(3) Emma is credited, again by the secular press in California, with being the
woman who organized Spiritualism in San Francisco, when she founded the
Friends of Progress there in late 1863: nearly as soon as she got off the boat
from Panama.
216
(4) she is focused on institutionalization issues (among other things) in
MAS, in 1869/70 having seen what Coleman was able to do in London on the
strength of his personal network, and recognizing by that time that that the
economic viability of Spiritualist promotion (propaganda as she called it)
depended on an organization to both fund and amplify the propagandist;
(5) she proposes a ‘School for Prophets’ in Art Magic (1876), albeit for
“another reason associated with organization” (the too-varied communications
and methods of mediums), and keeps on about such a school until she dies;
(6) she participates in the founding of the TS, remains there after the
Sotheran incident, and honours her pledge of secrecy;
(7) she sees what real organization can do when she’s in Australia in 1877
(see Nineteenth Century Miracles p. 233 for example);
(8) she gets behind Dawson Rogers and Stainton Moses (and even
anticipates them) when they begin arguing for standard methods and practices
for mediums in the early 1880s;
(9) she does succeed in turning TW into the voice of “the amorphous
opposition” to Theosophy in the late 1880s and earl 1890s, but she is dismayed -
- as are others -- by the UK Spiritualists’ inability to mount a concerted defense
against Theosophy, and indeed against other (Christian and non-Christian)
debunkers who are circulating through the country attacking Spiritualism;
(10) as you say here, she is a driving force behind the National convention;
and
(11) when she terminates the Unseen Universe in 1892, she does so with her
usual complaint: you people can’t get your collective act together and support
those of us who are doing the work of the movement.
My point is: she is on about institutionalization of the movement from the outset. She IS
the major force for institutionalization. Her motive is both pure and personal: the
movement can’t grow without institutionalization, and she can’t do her job (and get paid
for it) without institutionalization.
In the Unseen Universe, in issue 8 (November 1892, pp. 420-1) a reader calling himself
“Watchman” writes:
“Can you give me, and your numerous readers, any suggestions how to remedy or improve
the present low and deplorable condition of Spiritualism in this country? I have been, as
you, dear madam, during your long residence in America may know, an earnest believer
and something of a working adherent of "the cause" for many years. Having returned to
visit my relatives in my native land, and with some expectation of making my home here,
my first and greatest desire has been to ascertain how far the cause I so much love, and that
which, in my way, I have endeavoured to aid, has progressed in England, and what do I
find? Scores, if not even hundreds, of petty meetings held of a Sunday, but secularized into
paltry shows by attempts at describing spirits in a manner that would apply to any and
every stranger you meet in the street; an exhibition of attempts also to spin yarns that
would apply to anyone in the audience, by touching handkerchiefs, letters, keys, and all
sorts of trash, in a manner calculated for practice amongst curiosity hunters in a seance-
217
room, but really clownish and repulsive in the extreme to spiritually-minded people who
wish to devote their Sundays to higher thoughts than those of earth, and go to meetings -
not shows - in the hope of feeding their souls with noble and exalting teachings. I said as
much to one of the managers of these Sunday Spiritual (?) shows lately, and he replied to
my remonstrances by saying, “Oh! Unless we have something of this sort to draw an
audience, we can’t get the people to come.” “Indeed,” I said, “then if your only aim is to
draw an audience, why on earth don't you black your performers' faces, put them in
mountebanks’ clothes, and give them bones, tambourines, and banjos to play? You'll draw
much better audiences that way, than by caricaturing such a noble cause as Spiritualism
with the trash you exhibit now.” Alas! alas! Madam, can nothing be done to lift up such a
grand possibility as we have had in Spiritualism, and so well calculated to be the religion of
the age, as well as to be the basis of a science in the seance-room, and home circle? I have
learned something of how you stand personally since my return to England, and have
wondered many times why you do not go back to the land where, as Sterne says, there are
at least "a few to love you, and so many to admire you." Since you are here, dear madam,
can you still do nothing more, or suggest something, to redeem and lift up our noble cause
from its present degradation in England?”
Emma says, in answer to the letter, which I half-suspect she wrote herself:
“It cannot be denied that there is as much truth as severity in “Watchman’s” arraignment of
the present status of Spiritualism in England. Our Sunday services should be purely
religious meetings, and for this end we need better music, better and more qualified public
teachers, more select and generally appropriate places of gathering, and a higher and nobler
sense of the purposes for which Sabbath meetings should be undertaken. Secondly, we
need a school or COLLEGE, not only for the training and culture of medium power, but
also for the purpose of establishing in our media such a high sense of morality and purity
that they may become living examples of the sublime revelations which spirit communion
brings, and still more, of the lofty religion and noble science which Spiritualism might have
been under better human guidance than it at present enjoys.
“ From what I personally know of the societies in the provinces, I believe they are formed
chiefly by good, earnest, honest people, who deem that such meetings as they can get up,
under every kind of disadvantage, are better than none at all, and such Spiritualism as they
can put before the world is also better than none at all. Contrasting the grand and influential
Sunday services which were held in the metropolis some twenty years ago, with the present
divided and fragmentary ranks, or, I should say - no ranks - of the same great cause to-day,
I cannot but feel as if there were an undercurrent somewhere more prompt to destroy that
cause than good intentions are potent to build it up. At present this is neither the time nor
place in which to review my own efforts to advance the mighty movement in this country.
It is enough for me, as a matter of self-respect, to allege that I have never ceased to labour
for it in every direction, according to my highest light, and with the means at my disposal,
since setting foot again on English soil. I am neither prepared to answer "Watchman" in full
(at least just now) as to the causes of the stupendous and ruinous divisions prevailing
amongst Spiritualists, nor yet to suggest any other remedies for the subject of his
complaints, than such as I have above alluded to. For my own part in this movement, one
218
which, like “Watchman,” I consider to be the greatest, most salvatory [sic], and fraught
with the mightiest possibilities of any the world has ever known before, I can only say with
J. G. Whittier, “I watch, wait, and labour.”
“To sum up, all I can say, not only in answer to one, but to a perfect army of
correspondents writing on the same lines as “Watchman,” I have proved, and now know,
that Spiritualism is divine, Spiritualists are human. The one represents heaven, the other
earth, and all the heterogeneous grades of being that inhabit earth. To any strong as well as
capable workers that desire to lift those grades and help to organize them into a grand
resistless army of heaven, I can only add, they will find a willing coadjutor in the most
devoted of spiritual soldiers, and in verification of this promise I call attention to my own
Manchester Sunday evening meetings, the notice of which will be found in the cover of this
magazine. These meetings were projected and urged upon me by a few earnest and
interested persons in and near Manchester, and their cost (excepting the collections) falls
upon those ill enough able to bear the trouble and expense of the undertaking. Yet though
we make no exhibitions at these meetings, their religious character seems to be sufficiently
well appreciated as to draw excellent audiences, attracting even on one Sunday night, when
the rain was falling in torrents, over a hundred persons, when scarcely one was expected.
“I am well convinced the phenomena of Spiritualism is the only present day PROOF
EXTANT of the soul's immortality and the conditions of life hereafter, but such proof
should be given in circles, and these, when organized upon harmonious and well-ordered
conditions, constitute the science of Spiritualism. Meantime the Sunday meetings should be
devoted to the religious and philosophic teachings of the spirits, and when these are given
in respectable places by educated and qualified teachers, and in reverent and appropriate
services, I am well convinced Spiritualism, both as a science and a religion, would be the
most exalting, as well as the truest, corrective of all the abuses of the age.”
She never stopped agitating for organization, scale, strategy and financial viability for the
movement. As an outsider, I look at her position, in light of the decline in Spiritualism and
Theosophy, as a prescient one.

Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and the Welsh
Physical Medium
EVAN POWELL
1881 – 1958
There is very little referenced information
on this once famous and—highly
respected physical medium from Merthyr
Tydfil, in Wales. Much of the web
information available on Evan Powell
associates him with Sir Arthur Conan
Doyle and claims profound influence on
Doyle’s early Spiritualist involvement; for
example:—18
“… it is alleged that he [Doyle] left a
séance in Wales with the medium
Evan Powell and declared “Tonight
Sherlock Holmes died!” as he vowed
to take forward the cause of
Spiritualism, which he did to great
effect until his death”.
This quote possibly originated from a
séance given by Mrs. Gladys
Mallaburn:—19
“After one of their many sittings,
Doyle announced he was killing off
Sherlock Holmes—public clamour

This is taken from the excellent website of the Northampton National Spiritualist Church, which includes
its church history, and a link to some S.N.U. videos including ex-S.N.U., presidents Eric Hatton and Judith
Seamen. There are interesting sections on Hannen Swaffer and Conan Doyle, from which the quote is taken

http://www.freewebs.com/ebabeiknarf/Seances/The%20Mallaburn%20Circle.pdf The séance is undated but would be
post 1958* [ see end note re:—Roy Stemman.]
Gladys Mallaburn was a Spiritualist’ National Union minister (MSNU). There is (Dec 2009) a Gladys
Mallaburn Trust:—“The fund was established in 1978 to provide that interest on investments be utilised
towards the general administration expenses of the head office of the Union, the fund to be invested in dated
Government stock and any capital accretion at the redemption dates being added to and forming part of the
trust for reinvestment.” See:—http://www.snu.org.uk/Images/pdfs/accounts2009.pdf
220
later prevented this slaying—to devote the rest of his days to espousing
Spiritualism. Jokingly Powell often said, “I was responsible for murdering
Holmes”.”
A more factual reference to any kind of influence Powell may have had on Doyle’s
motivation is suggested by Mrs. Barbara McKenzie who at this time was the Hon.
Secretary to the ‘British College of Psychic Science’,20
founded by her husband James
(Hewat) McKenzie.21
The College was opened on April 12th, 1920. In January and
February 1923, Evan Powell gave séances at the College and these were reported in their
journal Psychic Science by Barbara McKenzie. At this time (April 1923), Conan Doyle
who incidentally was one of the first members of the College,22
became President of its
newly established “Advisory Council.” The Chairmanship was held by Mrs. St. Clair
Stobart, with Vice-Chairman Rev. C. Drayton Thomas.
Barbara McKenzie states in her report:—23
“The editor of a well-known Welsh daily paper is amongst those who have in
recent years received some astounding demonstrations at Evan Powell’s
séances. Later, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle confesses to having received in Merthyr
the inspiration which sent him round the world as a lecturer on fire with his
subject. In The Wanderings of a Spiritualist, he says, “For two hours my wife
and I had sat listening to the whispering voices of the dead—voices which are
so full of earnest life and of desperate endeavours to pierce the barrier of our
dull senses. They had quivered and wavered round us, giving us pet names,
sweet, sacred things, the intimate talk of the olden time. Graceful lights . . . had
hovered over us in the darkness. It was a different and a wonderful world to us
now. . . . God had given us wonderful signs, and they were surely not for
ourselves alone.”
Mrs. Hewat McKenzie was the speaker at the first lecture under the auspices of the
International Institute for Psychical Research,24
on the evening of Friday November 16th,
1934. Again she reaffirms the important part Powell played towards Doyle’s conviction of
Spiritualism:—25

“It was through Mr. Evan Powell’s Mediumship that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle
received his most convincing proofs; and research work and Spiritualism is the
poorer that his Mediumship is not available to-day”.
One thing is certain. Sir Arthur held Evan Powell in high regard as to his abilities as a
physical medium:—26
“On the whole, Evan Powell may be said to have the widest endowment of
spiritual gifts of any medium at present in England. He preaches the doctrines of
Spiritualism both in his own person and while under control, and he can in
himself exhibit nearly the whole range of phenomena. It is a pity that his
business as a coal merchant in Devonshire prevents his constant presence in
London.”
Doyle makes another reference to Powell in his 1921 book, The Wanderings of a
Spiritualist:—27
“I employed the time by running down to Devonshire to give addresses at
Exeter and Torquay, with admirable audiences at both. Good Evan Powell had
come down to give me a last seance, and I had the joy of a few last words with
my arisen son, who blessed me on my mission and assured me that I would
indeed bring solace to bruised hearts. The words he uttered were a quotation
from my London speech at which Powell had not been present, nor had the
verbatim account of it appeared anywhere at that time. It was one more sign of
how closely our words and actions are noted from the other side. Powell was
tired, having given a sitting the night before, so the proceedings were short, a
few floating lights, my son and my sister’s son to me, one or two greetings to
other sitters, and it was over”.
Below is a short report of a séance with Evan Powell held in March 1923, as published in
LIGHT:—28
The “Western Morning News and Mercury,” in its issue of February 23rd,
publishes the following account of a séance held at Paignton, Devon, at which
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was present. The report states:—

222
Mr. H. P. Rabbich, President of Paignton Spiritualist Society, who would be
termed a shrewd and successful inhabitant of this world, gave a representative
of The Western Morning News and Mercury yesterday a full account of the
seance in his house at Paignton attended by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. “Evan
Powell was brought in, and Sir Arthur examined him. He was fastened in a
chair, as he always will be fastened in. After tying him I had, for double
security, fastened cotton around his thumbs, because in these sittings we very
often get the physical phenomena of his coat being taken from his back and laid
in the middle of the floor, or over the other end of the room. On this night we
started to sing a hymn, ‘Abide with me,’ and in the midst of the hymn a
beautiful bass voice broke in with us outside our own voice. The volume of the
voice more than overpowered the whole of our eight or nine voices in the room.
He joined in and sang in perfect harmony with us. As soon as the hymn was
finished, I heard a voice distinctly saying, ‘Hello, dad,’ and then Sir Arthur
exclaimed: ‘Hello, Kingsley, old man; glad you are here, glad you are come.’
I cannot tell you the whole of the conversation between the boy and his
father. He used familiar names of the family, of which we in the room had no
knowledge whatever because it was the first time I had met Sir Arthur Conan
Doyle. The conversation might have lasted for about five minutes, and then the
boy wished us good-bye, and thanked my wife and me for allowing his father to
come through, and for the privilege of letting him speak to us. After that there
started a quite different voice louder and older. Sir Arthur turned to me and said
that was his brother, Colonel Doyle, who was shot in the war. He introduced me
to his brother who thanked me for the privilege of making conditions so that he
could come back to give a message to Sir Arthur before he started on his great
missionary tour to Australia. Three voices came to Sir Arthur—his son, his
brother, and an old University friend. The only thing I can say about those
voices is that no one in my dining-room could have imitated them. It required
the unmistakable University cultured voice to speak like them, and no one in the
room had that ability. There were other voices at the same time, and we heard
the two voices together. And that same night my own son and daughter came.
When my boy came through, there was no mistaking our boy George’s voice.

Hundred Years of Spiritualism, by Roy Stemman29

“Perhaps the most striking of all the thousands of lectures given during this
period was that by Evan J. Powell, JP, on August 11, 1946. The audience were
astonished to learn that it was the 50th anniversary—to the very day—of the
first Spiritualist service Powell had taken.
“Powell was an extremely powerful physical medium in his early days. A
native of Merthyr Tydfil, South Wales, he left school at a very early age and
went into the pits. It was then that his mediumship developed. He played a vital
role in the growth of the local Spiritualist church. Later, he moved to Paignton,
South Devon, where he took part in local politics and ultimately became
chairman of the Urban District Council and a Justice of the Peace. Thousands of
holidaymakers to the area have enjoyed the cliff gardens and promenade at
Goodrington, and have bathed from the spacious sands there. It was largely due
to Powell’s foresight and enthusiasm that these beautiful gardens and cliff walks
were constructed.
“Powell’s sitters included princes, statesmen and scientists, and his
mediumship played an influential part in convincing Sir Arthur Conan Doyle of
Spiritualism's reality. He took scores of meetings all over the country with the
famous writer. In his History of Spiritualism Sir Arthur wrote:
“Evan Powell may be said to have the widest endowment of spiritual gifts of
any medium at present in England. He preaches the doctrines of Spiritualism
both in his own person and while under control, and he can himself exhibit
nearly the whole range of phenomena ... the author has heard the spirit voices as
loud as those of ordinary human talk, and recalls one occasion when three of
them were talking simultaneously, one to Lady Cowan, one to Sir James
Marchant, and one to Sir Robert McAlpine. Movement of objects are common
in the Powell seances and on one occasion a stand weighing 601b was
suspended for some time over the author’s head. Evan Powell always insists on
being very securely tied during his seances, which is done, he claims, for his
own protection, since he cannot be responsible for his own movements when he
is in trance.”
“Ralph Rossiter was a personal friend of Powell’s,31
and owed his life to the
healing he received for chronic asthma and tuberculosis of both lungs through
the medium. Rossiter wrote about one seance he attended at which he heard four
strong spirit voices speaking simultaneously, three in English and one in
Russian, with the sitters joining in the conversation.”
31
It was through this friendship that allegations were made against Gordon Higginson, see Psypioneer
Volume 6, No.5:—The Curious Case of Gordon Higginson – Philip Paul, pages 136-142:—
http://woodlandway.org/PDF/PP6.5.May2010.pdf There is an obituary for Philip Paul, the ghost hunter and
sometime Spiritualist researcher, and author of Some Unseen Power in Fortean Times no.277, July 2011.
Born 31 August 1923, died 12 June 2010 [sic], also a journalist and PR consultant. Friend of [Hannen]
Swaffer.
224
In conclusion, we can note there is no strong referenced material to substantiate the claims
that Evan Powell was a profound influence on Doyle’s resolve to champion the Spiritualist
religion. My colleague, Garth Willey commented:
I don’t recall any validating statement written or spoken by ACD that any of the
Powell séances was a critical turning point in convincing him of life after death
and the ability of spirits to communicate. Sir Arthur frequently stated that his
spiritualistic views were built up over many years of investigation, it being a
standard part of his ‘patter’ to establish his credentials and to put down anyone
who attempted to decry spiritualism without plenty of firsthand experience of
phenomena. Those ‘many years’ dated back into the early 1880’s, nearly some 40
years before he first met Powell in 1919 in Portsmouth. That first meeting,
incidentally, resulted in a séance in ACD’s hotel room on September 7 wherein
ACD’s son Kingsley materialised for the first time: no doubt a powerful influence
on ACD but not to the tune of launching ACD as the St Paul of Spiritualism since
he had already embarked on that pathway.
And, as for Powell’s séance room phenomena being cause for ACD wanting to
kill off Sherlock Holmes in favour of championing Spiritualism, Holmes had
already been killed off in The Adventure of the Final Problem in 1893; not at all
because of Spiritualism: it was because ACD wanted to rank as a writer of a better
class of literature. And as it had already turned out, ACD had then ‘resurrected’
Holmes from the dead in 1903 in The Adventure of the Empty House – and
continued to churn out Sherlock Holmes stories whenever the pecuniary need
arose until he finally put Holmes into retirement (as a beekeeper) in 1927.
An interesting observation is in the last paragraph of Stemman’s quote regarding Ralph
Rossiter32
“… owed his life to the healing he received for chronic asthma and tuberculosis
…” if we turn back to the Gladys Mallaburn circle in the same section of my first quote we
find:
He was responsible for an ingenious communication. ‘The Hawk is here,’ he
said, which Ralph Rossiter, the Spiritualist Association’s secretary, understood,
even before the communicator added, ‘Black Hawk . . . his name is Powell. .. .
This is my beloved son...’ Ralph, of course, will never forget old Evan Powell,
that wonderful physical medium, whose guide, Black Hawk, was responsible for
virtually saving his life when it seemed that he was condemned to suffer from
tuberculosis. The phrase, ‘My beloved son,’ was one that Evan always used in
referring to him. I could not follow, until Ralph explained it later to me,
Powell’s statement, ‘I have met Holmes.’ Evan was a great friend of Sir Arthur
Conan Doyle.
32
Ralph Rossiter died August 10th, 1969, in Boscastle, Cornwall. Rossiter with his wife Maud dedicated
many years to the SAGB.
225
Later on page 45 of Stemman’s book we find:
“Three years later [1960] came an equally outstanding seance, this time with
a British medium, Gladys Mallaburn, a widow from Chopwell, near Newcastle-
on-Tyne. She is a Spiritualists’ National Union minister, a healer and public
clairvoyant, and has produced materialisation and direct voice in her home
circle for years. When he learned that she would be attending the International
Spiritualist Congress in London in 1960 (organised by the Association,
incidentally), the Editor of “Two Worlds”, Maurice Barbanell, asked if she
would give a seance. She agreed and he arranged with the Association for it to
be held in one of its rooms”.
Then came this un-related communication:
“He was followed by a woman’s voice through the trumpet, which moved to
Sydney Richardson. ‘My husband, Syd,’ she said. ‘This is hard’. Then clearly
the sound of a kiss was heard. She sent ‘my love to Ursula’, the famous
medium, Ursula Roberts who is Sydney’s second wife. ‘She is so good’, she
added, ‘and you have much to be thankful for.’ “There was a cryptic message,
‘The wheels do go round’, which Sydney understood. Then came, ‘It is so nice
to hear your voice. Thank you for all the happiness we had. Tell Ursula I have
brought her mother’.”
This information is contained in “The Mallaburn Circle” cited above (note 19) although the
article states: “Now the scene changes to a small village near Newcastle-upon-Tyne, to
another home circle and to a séance, one which lasted five hours”
In the next issue we will publish more on Evan Powell’s life and his mediumship. Below is
another short report of Powell’s mediumship by Leslie Curnow a close associate of Doyle,
see Psypioneer:—“Conan Doyle’s Australian Helper- Leslie Curnow” published in August
2009.33
(That issue was dedicated to Don Galloway (1929-2009) and Sir Arthur Conan
Doyle (1859-1930); the 7th July 2011 marking 81 years since Doyle’s passing.)

EVAN POWELL’S MEDIUMSHIP.
LIGHT:—34
WONDERFUL SITTING AT THE BRITISH COLLEGE
BY LESLIE CURNOW
It is well known that mediums for physical phenomena are rare nowadays.
Manifestations now are more on the mental and spiritual planes, an evolution that was pre-
dicted years ago. But we still have in Mr. Evan Powell, of Wales, a wonderful medium,
whose results challenge comparison with some of the great mediums of earlier days.
He has been giving a course of sittings at the British College of Psychic Science,
Holland Park, and it was my good fortune to be present at one of these on the evening of
Wednesday, April 11th, when remarkable manifestations occurred., including telekinesis,
the Direct Voice, spirit lights, and materialisation. Before the sitting started, Mr. Powell
insisted that a committee of three gentlemen should accompany him to an upstairs room,
undress him, and examine his clothing. I was one of this committee, and we thoroughly
satisfied ourselves that nothing was concealed. In view of the rigid tying to which he was
afterwards subjected, such search was not necessary, but it was undertaken at the medium's
express wish.
On returning to the seance room, Mr. Powell was securely lashed to his chair by cord,
the knots being covered with sealing wax and stamped with the signet ring of one of the
sitters. Finally the medium’s two thumbs were tightly tied with a single strand of thin
cotton.
One could not fail to be impressed by the earnestness displayed by this medium in
endeavouring to meet every test that could be devised. Indeed, he suggested many himself,
in that way strongly recalling D. D. Home. One suggestion offered by Mr. Powell was that
the sitter should kick out vigorously into the space in front of him, when any manifestation
was taking place before him. This I did on numerous occasions during the subsequent
proceedings, always failing to come in contact with anything solid.
There were fourteen sitters, who sat in horseshoe formation, the farthest away being
about eight or ten feet distant from the medium, behind whom was a small curtained recess
in which stood a small wicker table bearing a set of fairy bells and a trumpet. This
enclosure was thoroughly searched before the sitting began. There were two doors in the
room. One was locked by me and the key kept in my possession. The other, which was not
in use, was found to be locked, but as an extra precaution I affixed stamp edging in various
places along its contact with the frame-work.

The lights were extinguished, and all joined hands. The medium was quickly entranced,
and Black Hawk took control. The fairy bells were brought out from the cabinet by the
spirit Ethel, and moved about the circle, touching various sitters at places where they said
they wished to be touched, as the top of the head, the knees, the chin. Then in answer to
requests the electric light globes in the ceiling were struck. The bells moved with great
rapidity about the circle.
Next came spirit lights, and these were plainly visible in all their wonderful brilliance.
They touched sitters, who described the feeling as “spongy;” or “like cotton wool.” The
lights conveyed no sensation of heat. At request, a light came to within six inches of my
face. It was orange-coloured, and the fingers of the hand conveying it could be clearly
seen—thin delicate, tapering fingers. This very fine exhibition lasted a considerable time.
In answer to a sitter, a light traced the form of a triangle, and then of a circle in the air. It
was a surpassingly beautiful manifestation of the higher chemistry. Black Hawk attempted
all explanation of how the lights were formed—an explosion of particles confined in a
small space, with more that was not easily comprehended.
Cold breezes were felt during the sitting, and flowers from a vase in the room were
brought into the circle. After brushing the faces of the sitters with them, the flowers were
dropped in the laps of various sitters. Drapery was materialised, and a number of sitters felt
it.
E. W. Wallis (a former Editor of LIGHT), Dr. Ellis T. Powell, and Mr. Cecil Husk (the
famous materialising medium), spoke to me in the Direct Voice; and during the singing of
hymns, Cecil Husk and a lady (contralto) were plainly heard joining in. At the close the
small table was brought from the cabinet into the circle, and pressed against a lady sitter,
whose hand-bag was taken from her lap and placed on the table. Afterwards the cord and
the cotton fixtures were found to be just as they were at the beginning. Nothing had been
broken or untied.
It was altogether a remarkable and convincing sitting, and Mr. Evan Powell is to be
congratulated on the results obtained through his mediumship, and for his efforts to satisfy
all who were present that there was no loophole for fraud or hallucination. The British
College deserves the gratitude of all psychic researchers for the fine work it is carrying on.

Returning briefly to the August 2009 Psypioneer issue we can also note:
PSYCHIC WARNINGS
LIGHT:—35
SEQUEL TO PUBLICATION OF A CONFIDENTIAL
DOCUMENT
[Note by LP:—In our August 2009 issue, we published several accounts of the prophecies
of cataclysm received by Conan Doyle which so exercised his last years. ACD had sent a
collation of such prophecies to Sir Oliver Lodge and others. How this list, preserved in the
Lodge papers, relates to the Wright version below is a moot point. This legal case is an
early example of copyright problems over ACD material, with which ACD biographers
would have much concern over the years.]
As a sequel to the publication in the Sunday Express of a document written by Sir A.
Conan Doyle in regard to psychic warnings of earthquakes and other disasters, judgment
was given in the Chancery Division of the High Court on Wednesday last week for Lady
Doyle and Mr. Denis Doyle, executors of Sir Arthur’s will, in an action to restrain Mr. S. F.
Wright and his son, Mr. G. Wright, from issuing the document for publication and
defendants were ordered to pay the agreed sum of £10 as damages.
Giving judgment, Mr. Justice Clauson said plaintiffs had had some damages from the
Sunday Express for infringement of copyright by publishing the document.
Opening the case, Mr. Galbraith said that about two years before his death, Sir Arthur
sent a confidential document in regard to psychic warnings to five or six of his friends. The
first defendant, Mr. S. F. Wright, had written a novel called Deluge and Sir Arthur wrote to
him on Nov. 15, 1927, as follows:
“Dear Sir,—I am reading your powerful novel ‘Deluge’ with considerable amazement.
The reason for this emotion is that I have for some years had all this information given me
in my own home circle by psychic means and that I have had at least 100 corroborations
from circles all over the world. I could show you this evidence. The great wind, the flood,
the Mediterranean subsidence. I have it all in the same order, too. I have not given details
to the world for fear of panic, but I have hinted at it in public all I dared. What I want to
know is where did you get it all? I could see you on Friday at 10, or we can correspond.”
Towards the end of 1927 Sir Arthur Conan Doyle sent the document which he had
written to Mr. S. F. Wright, but it was not to be published or broadcast, as the document at
the end said.
35

The defendants saw the editor and other representatives of the Sunday Express on July
9, 1930, and subsequently, and the whole document was published by that newspaper on
July 20.

The Beginnings of Full Form Materialisations
in England
Catherine (Kate) Elizabeth Wood 1854-1884
In April 2003 I wrote my first ever
article, titled “The Mediumship of
Catherine Wood” which was
published in The Ark Review, journal
of the now defunct Noah’s Ark
Society.36
Published below is a brief review of
Kate Wood’s early life and
development as an early
materialisation medium.
In the next issue we will continue
with her mediumship.

MISS WOOD’S MEDIUMSHIP
The Medium and Daybreak:— 37
BY T. P. BARKAS, F.G.S., NEWCASTLE-ON-TYNE.
The phenomena of Modern Spiritualism have been developed and investigated in
Newcastle-on-Tyne for about twenty-five years but it has been reserved for the last five
years to introduce the manifestations prominently before the general public, and to have
them developed to the extent which they have now reached.
Prior to the year 1872 the majority of the manifestations were of a private character, and
took place in private houses before select circles.
In July, 1872, a society was formed in Newcastle-on-Tyne, under the presidency of a
very old worker in the Cause—Mr. W. Armstrong—for the investigation of the alleged
phenomena of Modern Spiritualism, and the result was that in the course of a few months
several members of the society were developed as mediums for various forms of
manifestation. It was not, however, until the phenomena had taken the form of
materialisation of human forms that great interest was excited by them. The society met
twice a week for the purpose of developing mediumship and observing the phenomena.
In the year 1873 it was discovered that two young ladies, who were then mere girls, had
very great mediumistic power. The one (Miss Wood), was at that time eighteen years of
age, and the other (Miss Fairlamb) was about a year younger.
The society felt, and justly felt, that they could not claim the services of these young
women without in some way compensating them for the services they rendered, as it was
impossible for them to follow the occupations in which they were engaged, and from which
Miss Wood derived a livelihood, and devote a large portion of their time to the interests of
the society.
In consequence of this feeling, the society arranged to give the young women some
trifling remuneration for their services, and under those conditions the manifestations very
rapidly developed, until not merely control, conversation by the guides though the
mediums, but extraordinary movements of tables, chairs, bells, and other articles of
furniture, and musical instruments took place in the dark under test conditions.
When experiments for materialisation were tried in 1874 it was found that spectral
forms of human faces and hands presented themselves at the openings of the cabinet in
which the mediums were enclosed, and eventually, after much investigation, and con-
siderable sacrifice of time and patience, fully developed human forms, having the
appearance of men, women, and children, walked from the cabinet in which the mediums
37

231
were placed, and in various ways—by speech, motions, touch, &c.—made themselves
palpable to the audience.
The preliminary materialisation manifestations took place in the presence of a general
and somewhat promiscuous audience, as strangers were admitted, so that although they
were very remarkable and apparently inexplicable by reference to trick or ordinarily
understood natural laws, they were, nevertheless, not entirely conclusive, as few really
satisfactory tests were used, and the audience for the most part was inexperienced and
promiscuous, and in that sense not altogether reliable witnesses when occult phenomena
occurred in their presence.
In order to meet this objection of miscellaneousness, private seances were organised in
private houses of well-known gentlemen. The audiences consisted of personal friends well
known to each other; there was therefore more sympathy and harmony in the circles. Rigid
but friendly tests of many kinds were tried, and the result was that materialisations took
place, that nothing but a stubborn prejudice, perfectly inaccessible to the logic of facts;
could resist or gainsay.
I have seen through the mediumship of Miss Wood in a private house living forms walk
from the curtained recess which it was utterly impossible for her to simulate. I have seen
children, women, and men of various ages, walk forth under her mediumship. I have seen a
materialised form, and the medium at the same time. I have had through her mediumship a
childlike form standing beside me for about half an hour together; the child has placed its
arms round my neck, and permitted me at the same time to place my arm round her neck,
and has laid its cheek against mine, breathed upon my face, and, in fact, caressed me
precisely as a child would do its parent or guardian. This was not in darkness, but in light,
and in the presence of professors and fellows of one of the leading universities in the
kingdom. I have, under these conditions and after having handled the psychic form, seen it
gradually vanish or dematerialise, and become invisible in the middle of the room.
Miss Wood was born in October, 1854; she is the second daughter of Thomas Wood, of
this town, and lost her elder sister, Maggie, when she was young. She remained with her
parents until she was fourteen years of age, and at that time went to a situation which she
occupied until November 1873 when she was engaged as a medium by the Newcastle
Society. Her father, who is a working mechanic, and an investigator into Spiritualism, took
her to a meeting of the society, in 1872, which speedily led to her development as a
medium. She remained as one of the society’s mediums until about eight or ten months
ago, when she withdrew from the society, and is now acting as an independent medium for
these occult manifestations. Miss Wood’s early mediumistic experiences were of a very
demonstrative kind, principally physical, and in the early stage of her mediumship she
required careful and judicious supervision. Her chief controls are referred to in the letters
of Mr. Adshead, but she is subject to strange, controls, which there is some difficulty in
banishing.
232
It is of the utmost importance that her mediumship should not be injured, and for this
purpose she should not sit with very miscellaneous audiences, and should be screened from
all influences of an objectionable kind, as she, like many sensitives, is subject to controls
that are attracted by improper surroundings.
