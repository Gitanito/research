Foreword
T
he science o f investigating alleged abnorm al phenom ena
has, like m ost other sciences, advanced b y leaps and bounds
during die last fe w years. B efo re die W a r a back parlour, a red
lam p, a circle o f credulous sitters and a v iv id im agination w ere
all that w as thought necessary in order to ‘investigate’ a m edium .
O f course, psychic science m ade no progress. T h e m ethods o f
these researchers w ere derided b y official science and ortho d o xy
refused to listen to them.
B u t w ith die W a r cam e a change. A w a v e o f interest in the
possibility o f an after-life sw ept the country like a tornado. T h is
interest w as purely em otional, based as it w as on the fact that
tens o f thousands o f the flow er o f our m anhood w ere being shot
d o w n . Relatives m ourned them , but w ith their g rie f w as the
hope— alm ost the belief—that their sons, though dead, w o u ld
survive in another w o rld . T h e ranks o f the spiritualists over­
flow ed w ith those w h o hoped____
B u t the great w a v e o f em otion that sw ept the country carried
on its crest a fe w sane people w h o , w hile adm itting the possi­
b ility o f an after-life, dem anded that the alleged phenom ena
said to be produced in the stance-ro o m should be scientifically
investigated b y qualified and unbiased persons. T o m eet this de­
m and I founded (19 25) the N ational Laboratory o f Psychical
Research w hich, in Jun e 19 34 , w as taken o ver b y the U n iver­
sity o f London C o u ncil fo r Psychical Investigation. M o st o f the
cases recorded in these Confessions w ere investigated b y m e as
D irector o f the N ational Laboratory.

in this volum e that w ill supply an answer. T h e answer m ay be
8 Foreword
there, but perhaps I cannot read it. Fo r thirty years I have been
engaged upon an intensive quest as to w h at happens after death,
and the solution o f the eternal problem still eludes m e. T h e
spiritualists w ill tell y o u that they have evidence that die soul,
ego , o r personality n ot o nly survives the grave, but that the dis-
cam ate entities o f their loved ones 'co m e back’ and converse
w ith diem through a person o f abnorm al sensibility w h o is
called a 'm edium ’ . M y reply to die spiritualists is d u t, though I
adm it som e o f die phenom ena w h ich they obtain at séances,
there is no scientific p r o o f o f survival. T h e evidence upon
w h ich the supporters o f the spirit hypothesis base their claim s is
obtained principally through ‘m ental’ m edium s (such as clair­
voyants) w h o purport to interpret supem orm ally the voices o f
those w h o , as they term it, have ‘passed o ver’ . Let m e say at
once that m uch o f the evidence obtained through clairvoyants
and trance m edium s is v e ry im pressive; that is, impressive as to
the abnorm ality o f the com m unications w hich they deliver in a
state o f w h at is called a trance— though w h at a m edium istic
trance is, no one know s, and it cannot be tested.
B u t I cross swords w ith the spiritualists as to the causation o f
the phenom ena w h ich w e both adm it. I am told that the
'm essages’ , etc., obtained through an entranced psychic are
‘evidential’. I agree, but evidential o f w h at? T h e y are evidential
o nly o f their abnorm ality— n ot that they w ere uttered b y, or
inspired b y, the spirits o f those w h o w ere once living.
O u r k now ledge o f the conscious m ind is really very lim ited;
our ignorance o f the subconscious m ind is profound. Is it, then,
v e ry rem arkable d u t science suggests that these so-called spirit
messages (even w h en uttered b y m edium s w h o are honest) m ay
com e fro m die subconscious m ind o f the entranced m edium , or
(by telepathy) fro m the conscious o r subconscious m ind o f the
sitters? U nfortunately, w e h ave no scientific evidence that even
telepathy is a fact. B u t, the spiritualists argue, the m edium s tell
us things w h ich w ere unknow n both to themselves and their
C onfessions o f a G h ost-H u nter 9
sitters. Th is I am prepared to adm it, but does that p ro ve spirit
origin? O f course it does nothing o f the kind; it proves m erely
that the m edium has, in som e obscure w a y , obtained know ledge
unknow n to an y person present at the séance. It does not prove
su rviv a l
Assum ing that the inform ation obtained abnorm ally w as
k no w n o n ly to a dead person, that, too, w o u ld not p ro ve sur­
vival, o r that there are spirits: but it m igh t p ro ve the existence o f
w hat has been term ed the 'psychic factor’ .1 T h e psychic factor
has been suggested as an intangible ‘som ething’ possessed b y a
person w h ich m ay survive the grave. T h e theory is that, at
death, this psychic factor (not to be confused w ith the soul or
personality) m ay linger on aw hile and, under certain conditions,
com bine w ith the m ind o f an entranced m edium . Fro m this
com bination— it is suggested— emerges another m ind, m ade up
partly fro m the m ind o f the m edium and partly from that
‘ som ething’ w h ich once belonged to the dead person. This
theory has been term ed the ‘ em ergent theory’ . Assum ing that
there is an y truth in the ‘ em ergent theory’, it is v e ry easy to see
h o w an entranced m edium ’s utterances m ay include frets k no w n
o n ly to a dead person; but it does n ot p ro ve the survival o f the
soul, ego , o r personality. A n d o b viously it does not prove that
the dead can return to earth, and behave like the living.
In m y w o rk , Leavesfrom a Psychist's Case-Book,* I gave sev­
eral instances o f h o w the m ost extraordinary inform ation,
alleged to em anate fro m the spirits o f dead persons, w as re­

disaster. T h e psychic w as M rs. G arrett, the British trance
m edium , w h o does not k n o w one end o f an airship fro m the
other. T h e sitters present at the séance w ere also quite ignorant
o f such a highly-specialised business as navigating an airship;
yet 'Lieutenant Irw in ’ gave particulars o f the R i o i w h ich w ere
sem i-official secrets, and w h ich w ere afterwards confirm ed at
the public inquiry. W h ere did the inform ation com e fro m ?
Fro m die spirit o f Irw in? Perhaps, b ut w e cannot prove it.
A nother problem that confronts the dispassionate investiga­
to r is the contradictory accounts o f h o w and w here spirits
d w e ll Sir O h ver L o d g e’s ‘R a y m o n d * gives us a picture o f life
in the Sum m erland that appears v e ry little different fro m our
condition on earth. H e describes the same pains and pleasures
experienced b y mortals, and no norm al person w o u ld make
undue haste to jo in him . A n d it must be adm itted that R a y ­
m ond im parts to us no know ledge that can be regarded as
transcendental. A nother ‘spirit’ w ill give us a totally different
description o f obviously, a totally different place. It w ill talk o f
‘ spheres’, w h ere the discam atc advance in stages tow ards som e

added to our art, literature, o r learning. O n the contrary, m ost
o f the stuff that trance m edium s p o ur forth is the veriest
twaddle. E v e n the spiritualists themselves are beginning to
realise this, ju st as the m ore reputable spiritualist journals are
n o w ruthlessly exposing the fraudulent m edium w h o battens
on the credulity o f the ignorant and the wretchedness o f the
bereaved.
A ltho u gh I have emphasised that w e have no scientific p ro o f
o f ‘survival’, I m ust adm it that the spirit hypothesis can be made
to explain m an y o f those mysteries, both in and out o f the
stance-room , w h ich have intrigued m e fo r so m an y yea n .
Som e o f the cases recorded m this volum e becom e m ore intelli­
gible i f the reader is a spiritualist. Such curious incidents as ‘die
ghost that stumbled’ , the London Poltergeist, the m ost haunted
house, the ghost o f the U n ter den Linden, m y disturbed night
m the sleeping-car, and the adventures in haunted houses, can
all be explained i f one is prepared to adm it that the dead can
return and manifest in the same w a y as the living. B u t is that the
answer? I w onder. A s yet there is n o answer, though a num ber
o f scientists and others, and certain universities, are trying to
supply one.
I have endeavoured to m ake these Confessions as diverse as
possible. I have also tried to m ake them readable. Fo r those w h o
w an t m ore detailed, technical and analytical reports o f certain
o f the cases (some o f w hich w ere published m The Listener dur­
ing the sum m er o f 19 3 5 ), the original protocols are available.
B u t they are o f m ore interest to the student than the general
reader. A lm o st the entire gam ut o f alleged abnorm al manifesta­
tions can be found w ithin the tw o covers o f this volum e. Fro m
fire-w alking to hysteriacs, and fro m a ‘talking m ongoose’ to a
trip to M ars (via the stance-room ) the reader has a w id e choice
o f ‘miracles* to choose from . I have purposely refrained fro m
stressing the seam y side o f spiritualism. T h e public is sick and
tired o f the fraudulent ‘psychic’ and his rather stale tricks. I f I

CONFESSIONS OF A GHOST-HUNTER
I. The Ghost that Stumbled
y first ‘ghost’ was made o f cardboard. I w ill hasten to
explain that it was the ‘property’ spectre o f a three-act
psychic play, ‘The Sceptic', which I wrote and produced1 when
I w as still a schoolboy. O f course I took the principal part m y­
self, and I am sure I played the hero w ith considerable histrionic
The reason I mention m y early attempt at portraying the
supernatural is because ‘The Sceptic’ was the dramatised record
o f a remarkable experience which befell me when 1 investigated
m y fust haunted house.
A s a m ember o f an old Shropshire fam ily, I spent nearly all
m y hohdays and school vacations in a htde village— m fact, a
hamlet— which I w ill call Parton M agna. In Parton M agna is
the old M anor House, cir
c
aa .d . 1600. It had been purchased by
a retired canon o f the Church o f England, and his w ife. There
w ere rumours that the place was haunted— but popular tradi­
tion provides a ghost for every old country house, especially i f a
tragedy has taken place within it.
W ithin a very few weeks o f the canon’s settling down w ith
his household in their new hom e, reports were received o f curi­
ous happenings in the stables and out-buildmgs. Though fas­
tened securely overnight, stable doors were found ajar in the
m orning. Anim als w ere discovered untethered and wandering;
pans o f m ilk were overturned in die dairy, and utensils scat­
tered about. T h e woodshed received the attentions o f the
nocturnal visitant nearly every night. Piles o f logs neady

stacked w ere found scattered in die m orning, in spite o f the
fact that the door o f the shed w as kept locked. T h e manifesta­
tions in the woodshed becam e so frequent and troublesom e that
it w as decided to keep w atch. This w as done on several eve­
nings, a firm -h an d secreting him self behind a stack o f logs.
U p o n every occasion w hen a w atch w as kept on the w o o d ,
nothing happened inside the shed. O n those nights w hen the
shed w as w atched from w ithin, pebbles w ere flung on to the
corrugated iron roofing, the noise they m ade rolling d o w n the
m etal being plainly heard. T h en a w atch w as kept both inside
and outside o f the shed, but no one w as seen, though the peb­
bles w ere heard as before. T h e experienced reader w ill recog­
nise m m y narrative a Poltergeist case running true to type.
T h e disturbances around the house continued w ith unabated
vig o u r w eek after w eek until even local interest w aned some­
w hat. Th en, quite suddenly, they almost ceased, the disturbing
en tity transferring its activities to the inside o f the mansion,
w h ich I w ill n o w describe.
T h e M an o r House w as built fo r com fort, though it has been
restored at various times. Fro m the large hall a w ide staircase
leads to a landing. A t the top o f the stairs (o f w hich there are
ab out fifteen— but I am speaking fro m m em ory) is, or w as, a
solid oak gate placed across to prevent dogs fro m roam ing over
the w hole house. T h e staircase I have mentioned leads to the
m ore im portant room s opening out o f a short gallery.
T h e first indication received b y the canon and his fam ily that
die entity had turned its attention to the interior o f the house
w as a soft ‘pattering’ sound, as o f a child’s bare feet running up
and d o w n the w id e passage o r gallery. T h e noises w ere at first
taken to be those caused b y a large bird o r sm all animal o ut o f
the fields; a w atch w as kept, but investigation p roved fruitless.
These same noises w ere heard nigh t after night, but nothing
cou ld be discovered. Then the maids com m enced com plaining
that the kitchen utensils w ere being disturbed, usually during
C onfessions o f a G h o st-H u nter 1 7
their absence, in the daytim e especially. Pots and pans w o u ld
fall o ff shelves fo r no ascertainable reason w h en a m aid w as
w ithin a fe w feet o f them , but alw ays w h en her bade w as turned.
I do n ot rem em ber its being proved that a person actually saw a
phenom enal happening o f an y description, though m an y w ere
heard. A n oth er curious circum stance connected w ith this case
w as the disturbing entity’s fondness fo r raking o ut the fires dur­
ing the night. T h e danger o f fire fro m this cause w as so obvious
that, before retiring to rest, die canon’s w ife had w ater poured
on the d ying embers.
L ik e every old country house w o rth y o f the nam e, the
M an o r, Parton M agn a, had a ‘history’ w h ich at the period o f
m y story w as being sedulously discussed b y die villagers. T h e
story is that the house w as built b y a rich recluse w h o , through
an unfortunate affaire de cœur, decided to retire fro m the w o rld
and its disappointm ents. A niece, w h o acted as chatelaine,
looked after the old m an and m anaged his servants. O ne night,
som e fe w years after their settlement at the M an o r House, the
recluse becam e suddenly dem ented, w en t to his niece’s apart­
m ent and, w ith alm ost superhum an strength, strangled the girl
in bed. A fte r this m ost unavuncular act the o ld m an left the
house, spent the nigh t in the neighbouring w o o d s and at day­
break threw h im self into the river that runs through the fields
near die house. T h e legend, like the Poltergeist, also runs true to
type. Like m ost traditions, there is a gram o f truth in the
story, the fact being that m an y years previously a girl nam ed
M a ry Hulse had died at die M an o r under suspicious circum ­
stances.
It can be im agined that the canon’s health w as suffering under
the anxiety caused b y the disturbing events I have recorded
above, and he w as persuaded to leave the house fo r at least a
short period. T h is w as in the early autum n. O n m y w a y bade to
school fo r the M ichaelm as term I broke m y jo u rn ey at Parton
M agn a in order to stay a fe w days w ith our friends, w h o then
1 8 T h e G h o st that Stum bled
m ade m e acquainted w ith the state o f affairs at the M an o r
H ouse; in fact, it w as the principal topic o f conversation. T h e
canon and his household had b y then vacated their hom e tem­
porarily, the premises being looked after b y the w ife o f one o f
the cow m en. W h a t really drove the fam ily out w as the fact
that the nocturnal noises w ere becom ing greater; in particular,
a steady thum p, thum p, thum p (as o f som eone m heavy boots
stam ping about the house), disturbing the rest o f the inmates
nigh t after night. I decided I w o u ld investigate, and invited a
b o y friend to jo m m e m the adventure.
Permission to spend a night in the M an o r w as easily obtained
fro m the w o m an (w h o lived m a cottage near the house) w h o
w as looking after the place, and doubtless she regarded us as a
couple o f m ad schoolboys w h o w o u ld have been m uch better
in bed.
I m ust confess that I had n ot the slightest idea w hat w e w ere
go in g to do, o r go ing to see, or w h at I ought to take w ith m e
in the w a y o f apparatus. B u t the last question w as very soon
settled because all I had w ith m e w as a ¿-plate Lancaster stand
cam era. O n the m orning o f the adventure I cycled m to the near­
est to w n and bought som e m agnesium pow der, a bell sw itch, a
hank o f flex w ire, tw o Darnell’s batteries and some sulphuric
acid. A b ig hole w as m ade m m y term ’s pocket m o n ey! In the
afternoon I assembled m y batteries and sw itch and prepared the
flash po w d er b y m eans o f w h ich I hoped to photograph— some­
thing! So that there should be no unwillingness on the part o f
the m agnesium to ‘g o off* at the psychological m om ent, I ex­
tracted the w hite smokeless gunpow der fro m four o r five
sporting cartridges and m ixed it w ith the m agnesium pow der.
B y a lucky chance I had w ith m e a delicate chem ical balance
w h ich I w as taking back to school. W ith the weights w as a
platinum w ire ‘rider’ w h ich I inserted in the electrical circuit in
order to ignite the m agnesium flash-powder. W ith the ab o ve-

den lu x u ry!) som e cigarettes, w e bade a tender farewell to our
friends and m ade our w a y across the fields to the M an o r House,
w here w e arrived at about 9 .30 p.m .
T h e first thing w e did w h en w e reached o ur destination w as
to search every ro o m and attic, and close and fasten every w in ­
d o w . W e locked the doors o f those room s w h ich w ere capable
o f being treated in this m anner and rem oved the keys. T h e
doors leading to the exteno r o f the house w ere locked, bolted
and barred, and chairs o r other obstacles piled in front o f them .
W e w ere determ ined that no material being should enter the
portals w ithout our cognisance. A fter w e had searched every
nook and cranny o f the building, w e established ourselves in die

som ebody— to ‘turn up ’ . O u r o nly illum ination w as the light

v e ry sleepy and w ishing (though w e did not adm it it) that w e
w ere in our nice w arm beds, m y friend thought he heard a
noise in the ro o m overhead (the traditional apartm ent o f the
unfortunate M a ry Hulsc). I, too, had heard a noise, but con­
cluded it w as caused b y a w andering rodent or the w ind. It did
not sound an unusual noise. A fe w minutes later there w as a
‘ thud’ in the ro o m above w h ich left nothing to the im agination.
It sounded as i f someone had stum bled over a chair. I w ill not
attem pt to describe our feelings at the discovery that w e w ere
not alone in the house: fo r a m om ent o r so w e w ere alm ost
paralysed w ith fear. B u t, rem em bering w h at w e w ere there
for, w e braced up our nerves and w aited. Just before m idnight
w e again heard a noise m the room above; it w as as i f a heavy
person w ere stam ping about in clogs. A m inute o r so later the
footfalls sounded as i f they had left the room and w ere travers­
ing die short gallery. T h en they approached the head o f die

tinctly counted the fifteen ‘thumps’ corresponding to the n um ­
ber o f stairs— and I need hardly mention that our hearts w ere
‘thum ping’ in unison. ‘It’ seemed to pause in the hall w hen die
bottom o f the stain w as reached, and w e w ere w ondering w hat
was going to happen next. T h e fact that o nly a door intervened
between us and the mysterious intruder made us rain* a lively in­
terest in w hat its next m ove w ould be. W e w ere n ot kept lf>ng
in suspense. T h e entity, having paused in the hall for about
three minutes, turned tail and stumped up the stairs again,
every step being plainly heard. W e again counted the num ber
o f th u m p s, and w ere satisfied that ‘it’ was at the top o f the
flight— where again a halt w as m ade at the dog-gate. B u t no
further noise w as heard w hen this gate had been reached. M y
friend and I w aited at the door for a few minutes more, and
then w e decided to investigate the neighbourhood o f the d o g-
gate and M a ry Hulse’s room . B u t w e had barely form ed this
resolution before w e heard the ‘thumps’ descending the stairs
again. W ith quickened pulse I again counted the fifteen heavy
footsteps, w h ich w ere getting nearer and nearer and louder and
louder. There w as another pause in the hall, and again the fo o t-
foils com m enced their upw ard jou rney. B u t b y this tim e the

W e derided to have a look at our quarry, i f it w ere tangible, so
w ith m y courage in one hand and the cam era in the other, I
opened the door. M y friend w as close behind w ith the stable
lantern. B y this time the ‘ghost’ w as on about the fifth stair, but
w ith the opening o f the door leading into die hall the noise o f
its ascent stopped dead.
Realising that the ‘ghost’ w as as frightened o f m eeting us as

w e thought w e w o uld again exam ine die stain and the upper

part o f the house. This w e did v e ry thoroughly, but found
nothing disturbed. T h e dog-gate w as still latched and tied w ith
strin g. T o this d a y I am w o n derin g w h eth er ‘it’ clim bed o ver
the gate (easily accom plished b y a m ortal), o r whether it
slipped through the bars. I rhinlc w e w ere disappointed at not
seeing anything w e could photograph, so decided to m ake an
attem pt at a flashlight picture i f the Poltergeist w o u ld descend
the stairs again.
Fo r m y stand fo r the flash-powder I utilised som e household
steps about six feet high w hich w e found in the kitchen. I
opened out the steps and placed them about tw elve feet fro m
the bottom o f the stairs. O n the top o f the steps in an old
W a terb u ry watch-case I placed a heaped-up eggeupful o f the
m agnesium -cum -gunpowder m ixture— enough to photograph
every ghost m the cou nty! B u t in m y simple enthusiasm I w as
running no risks o f under-exposure. I placed the DanielTs bat­
teries in the m orning-room , and connected them up w ith the
m agnesium p o w der on the steps and the bell-push on the floor
o f the room , the w ire flex entering the ro o m under the door.
In the heap o f p o w der I had buried m y platinum ‘rider’ w hich
w as interposed in the electrical circuit.
T h e exact position as to w here w e should photograph the
entity presented som e difficulty. W e w ere n ot quite sure w hat
happened to it w h en it reached the hall, so w e decided to m ake
an attem pt at photographing it w h en it w as ascending o r de­
scending the stain. W e decided on the form er position, arguing
(w h ich shows h o w simple w e w ere !) that the ‘ghost* w o u ld
have becom e less suspicious o f us b y the tim e it w as on its
return jo u rn e y! I stationed m y friend on the seventh o r eighth
stair (I forget w h ich ), and he held a lighted m atch w h ich I
accurately focused on the ground-glass o f m y Lancaster L e
M éritoire cam era, w h ich I placed on one o f the treads o f the
steps. I inserted the dark-slide, w ith d rew the flap, uncapped the
lens, and then all w as ready. T h e w h o le thing w as rather m ad,
22 T h e G h o st that Stum bled
o f course, but the reader m ust rem em ber that w e w ere very
yo un g, w ith no experience o f Poltergeist photography.
B y the tim e w e had fixed up the cam era and exam ined the
connections it w as about half-past one. D urin g the tim e w e
w ere m o ving about the hall n ot a sound was heard from above­
stairs. H a vin g arranged everything to our satisfaction, w e re­
turned to the m orning-room , locked the door again and ex­
tinguished the lantern. T hen w e lay upon the carpet near the
door, w ith the pear-push in m y hand, and com m enced our
vigil.
It m ust have been nearly an hour before w e heard anything,
and again it w as from the M a ry Hulse room that the noises
em anated. T h e sounds w ere identical to those w e had previ­
ously heard: as i f someone in clogs w ere treading heavily.
Sh ortly after, the ‘thum ps’ could be heard approaching the d o g-
gate and again ‘it’ paused at the top o f the stairs. T h e pause was
greater than the previous one, and fo r a minute or so w e thought
the Poltergeist had com e to the end o f its jo u rn ey; but no, it
passed over— or through— the dog-gate and com m enced
stum ping d o w n the stairs again. H a vin g reached the hall the
visitant stopped, and in m y m ind’s eye I could picture it exam ­
ining the arrangements w e had m ade fo r securing its photo­
graph. T h en w e thought w e heard the steps m oved. In order to
get the cam era square w ith the stairs I had taken a large book
— using it as a set-square— and draw n on the tiled floor a chalk
line parallel w ith the stairs. E x a ctly against this line I had placed
the tw o front feet o f the steps.
D urin g the n ext five o r six m inutes w e heard no m ovem ent
in the halL T h en suddenly ‘it’ started its return jo u rney. W ith
our hearts beating w ild ly and w ith suppressed excitem ent w e
lay on the floor counting the slo w , measured ‘thum ps’ as they
ascended the stairs. A t the seventh ‘thum p’ I pressed the button
o f m y pear-push and— a m ost extraordinary thing happened,
w h ich is rather difficult to describe on paper. A t the m om ent o f
C onfessions o f a G h o st-H u nter 2 3
the explosion the ‘ghost’ w as so startled that it involuntarily
stum bled on the stairs, as w e could plainly hear, and then there
w as silence. A t the same m om ent there w as a clattering d o w n
the stairs as i f the spontaneous disintegration o f the disturbing
entity had taken place. T h e flash fro m the ignition o f the p o w ­
der w as so v iv id that even the m o rn ing-room from w h ich w e
w ere directing operations w as lit up b y the rays com ing from
under the door, w h ich w as rather lll-frcting.
It w o u ld be difficult to say w h o w as the m ore startled— the
Poltergeist or m yself, and for som e m om ents w e did nothing.
A fter our astonishment had subsided som ewhat, w e opened the
door and found the hall filled w ith a dense w h ite sm oke in
w h ich w e could hardly breathe. W e re-capped the cam era, re­
lit our lantern, and made a tour o f inspection. T h e first thing
w e noticed w as that the steps w ere shifted slighdy out o f the
square. W h eth er ‘ it’ m oved the steps (as w e thought at the
tim e), o r w hether the shock o f the explosion w as responsible
(wh ich is doubtful), w e could not determine. T h e W aterb u ry
w atch-case had disappeared w ith m y platinum ‘rider’, and I
have never seen the latter fro m that d a y to this. T h e watch-case
w e found eventually on the second stair fro m the bottom .
W h a t happened to it w as apparently this: through die ex­
trem ely rapid conversion o f the gu npow der and m agnesium
m to gases, and the concavity o f the interior periphery o f the
case tending to retain the gases, the case w as converted m to a
projeetde, the v e ry active propellant shooting it tow ards the
stairs (the force o f the explosion happening to send it in that
direction), w h ich it must have hit at about the spot w here the
entity w as ascending— surely the o n ly recorded instance o f a
‘ghost’ having a w atch-case fired at it, and it has been suggested
that I call this narrative ‘H o w I “ shot” m y first Poltergeist’ \ T h e
sound o f the watch-case falling w as the rattling noise w e heard
w h en w e thought w e should find our quarry lyin g in pieces at
the fo o t o f the staircase. W e im m ediately developed the plate,

T h e M an o r House continued to be the centre o f psychic
activity fo r some months after our curious adventure, but the
disturbances became gradually less frequent, and eventually
ceased. Fate decreed that some years later I should spend v ery
m any happy weeks in the house. I f sometimes during that per­
iod m y heart beat foster than its accustomed rate, the raiur was
not a supernatural one! Suffice it to say that I did not see or hear
anything o f the alleged spirit o f M a ry Hulse, though I w ill can­
didly adm it that I w as not looking for her— m y interest in the
diaphanous maiden having been transferred b y that rime to one
o f a m uch m ore objective nature!
II. The M ost Haunted House in England
O
n Tuesday, Jun e u , 19 2 9 ,1w as lunching w ith a friend,
w hen his telephone bell rang. T h e call w as fo r m e, fro m
die editor o f a great London daily. H e had been tryin g to find
m e all the m orning. H e told m e an extraordinary story. It ap­
peared that one o f his representatives had sent in a report o f a
m ost unusual Poltergeist case that w as disturbing the inm ates o f
a country house som ewhere in the H o m e Counties. H e sought
m y co-operation in unravelling the m ystery. His m an had been
at the house fo r tw o days and w as impressed b y w h at he had
seen and heard. W o u ld I take up the case? I eagerly accepted his
invitation.
T h a t same afternoon I telegraphed to the tenant saying I
w o u ld be w ith him the next d ay. His reply w as: ‘T h an k G o d —
com e quickly. W ill expect y o u to lunch.’ T h e n ext m orning
found m y secretary and m e speeding through the countryside
full o f hope as to w h at w e w ere go ing to see. A s w e took turns
at the w heel, w e discussed w h at the trouble m ight be. M y ex­
perience told m e to look fo r a m ischievous adolescent, rats,
practical jokers— or the village idiot. I have wasted v e ry m an y
w eeks in acquiring this know ledge. B u t, I argued, a London
reporter is n ot easily impressed; usually he is hard-headed,
sceptical, and prone to sco ff at such things as ‘ghosts’. I f the re­
presentative o f the D a ily --------w as convinced o f som ething
abnorm al, obviously the affair w as w o rth inquiring into. W e
had been so busily discussing die case that, before w e realised it,
w e discovered w e w ere on the outskirts o f W ------- , a m arket
to w n . W ith considerable difficulty, w e found o ur w a y to
K -------M an o r, w h ich is situated in a tiny hamlet, seven miles o ff
26 T h e M ost H aunted H ouse in England
the m ain road, and near now here in particular. W e found that
the huge entrance gates had been opened fo r us and, as I sw ung
m y car up the drive, w e could see our host, M r. H . Robinson,1
and his w ife w aiting to w elcom e us. W e ju m p ed out and
crossed the threshold o f w h at I am certain is the m ost haunted
house in En gland; a house in w h ich I have seen and heard the
m ost convincing Poltergeist phenom ena; and a house w hich , i f
it w ere in the m arket, I w o uld purchase in order to study in situ
manifestations o f an absolutely abnorm al nature. N o t o nly is
K ------- M an o r the perfect conception o f a haunted house (as
regards both situation and variety o f phenom ena), but its
psychic history goes back m any years and is fu lly docum ented.
A t lunch w e heard the com plete history o f the house and its
traditions, together w ith a detailed account o f those manifesta­
tions w h ich had brought us to such an o ut-o f-the-w ay spot.
T h e account w h ich follow s is fro m the verbatim notes w luch
m y secretary m ade during lunch.
K ------- M an o r is a large house w ith nine acres o f ground,
through w h ich runs a little stream that empties itself m a pond.
T h e grounds are w ell w ooded, and one path, know n as the
‘N u n ’s W a lk ’, leads to the little church and churchyard. C o n ­
tiguous to the w alk on one side is a law n. T h e house is not an
old one, having been built about 18 6 3. It w as erected on the
site o f a tw elfth-century m onastery, the cryp t o f w hich is still
preserved. Fo r m any years the property has belonged to the
Percival fam ily. T h e mansion w as built b y M r. Thom as
Percival, w h o resided there. H e died there m 18 9 7 . His son, M r.
W alter Percival, then becam e the occupier. H e succum bed to a
painful and lingering illness in 19 2 7 . H e died m the ‘Blue
R o o m ’. A succession o f ow ners occupied the mansion, but it
w as alleged that none w o u ld stop m ore than a fe w months,
o w in g to the disturbances. In the spring o f 19 2 9 M r. H . R o b in ­
son rented the house, and spent ¿ 2 0 0 on doing the place up;

Confessions o fa Ghost-Hunter 27
his occupation w as the signal fo r a display o f supernorm al hap­
penings w h ich , eventually, drove him out. B u t I am antici­
pating.
N o w for the traditions, because K ------- M an o r has several. A t
the period w hen the m onastery w as in its h eyday, a coachm an
belonging to the establishment fell in love w ith a nun attached
to a convent nearby. T h eir clandestine m eetings culm inated in
an attem pted elopem ent m a black coach draw n b y tw o b ay
horses, driven b y a lay brother. T h e trio w ere missed, over­
taken, and brought back. T h e three w ere tried b y their respec­
tive superiors. T h e maiden w as w alled up alive and the coach­
m en beheaded. So m uch for the principal legend— w h ich has
several variants. A m ore m o d em story tells h o w the apparition
o f M r. W alter Percival is frequently seen, dressed in the old
grey bed-jacket in w hich he died.
It is not clear w hether the traditions have been built up on
w h at a num ber o f people undoubtedly think they have seen, or
wheth er the ‘appearances’ are really the apparitions o f the un­
fortunate mediaeval lovers and the late ow ner. B u t there is no
doubt w hatever that m an y people claim to have seen a coach
and pair careering through the grounds o f K ------- M anor, and,
m uch m ore frequently, the figure o f a nun slo w ly w alking past
the law n tow ards the churchyard; that is h o w the ‘N u n ’s W a lk ’
go t its nam e. B u t the nun and her m ale friends play o n ly a v e ry
sm all part in the am azing story o f K ------ .
B y the tim e w e had finished our coffee, I had heard the his­
to ry o f K ------- and its gh ostly inhabitants. B u t w h at interested
m e m ost w as M r. R obin son ’s story o f his o w n experiences. O f
course he heard all about the K ------- legend before he took the
place, but did not believe a w o rd o f it; he regarded as fantastic
the stories that previous ow ners had departed on account o f a
‘ghost’ . His incredulity rapidly gave place to som ething akin to
fear.
T h e first ‘incident’ w as the ringing o f the front-door bell— a
2 8 T h e M ost H aunted H ouse in E ngland
big, sonorous, clanging bell that reverberated all o ver the house.
It w a s soon after the R obinsons m oved in and they w ere ju st re­
tiring to rest. It w as a terrible night. There w as a storm raging
and it w o u ld be difficult to im agine a w orse evening fo r anyone
to be abroad. M r . R obinson looked at his w ife in w onderm ent.
Th in kin g it w as a neighbour in dire trouble, he hurried to the
door and w ith d rew the bolts. T h e bell stopped ringing. W ith
the lam p in one hand, he peered into the darkness: there w as no
one there. Sheltering the lam p fro m the gusts o f w ind and rain
that threatened to extinguish it, he w alked a fe w paces d o w n
the drive m search o f his visitor. N o th in g w as to be seen. H e
w en t into the road w ay, but n o t a soul w as visible. H e re­
turned to the house and w en t to bed. T w e n ty-five minutes
later (at about 11 .4 5 ) the bell rang out again: not an ordinary
ring, but a clangorous solo w h ich lasted until he could get a
dressing-gow n on and reach the door. N o one w as there. T h e
rain had then ceased, and thinking the intruder w as a small b oy
p laying a jo k e, he explored a considerable part o f the garden
and ro ad w ay: he found no one. There w as no further disturb­
ance that night, but the nocturnal clangour o f the d oor bell rang
in an o rg y o f ringing1 w h ich persists to this day.
T h e bells w ere the start o f the trouble. O n ly a part o f the
house w as furnished, but bell-ropes in em pty room s w ere
pulled as frequently as those in the apartments in use. A n d then
the door-keys com m enced to fall o ut o f the locks. E v e ry key
w o u ld be m its place o vernight; in the m orning, m an y o f them
w o u ld be found on the floor. E ven tually, every one disappeared.
W ith die k ey phenom ena cam e die sounds o f slippered foot­
falls, in all parts o f the house, b y d ay and b y night. Especially
w h en they w ere undressing fo r bed, the R obinsons w o u ld hear
soft steps in the passage outside their room . M o re than once M r.

R obin son w aited in the dark w ith a hockey stick and m ade
lunges a t‘ som ething’ that passed him . H e never struck anything.
T hen stones w ere th row n : sm all round pebbles (origin un­
know n ) w ere hurtled through the air, o r cam e rolling d o w n the
stairs. Thin gs becam e so bad that the villagers w ere frightened.
A reporter arrived on the scene— and that is h o w I cam e to be
connected w ith the case.
T h e nigh t previous to m y arrival, a n ew phenom enon w as
witnessed. It w as reported b y several people that a light had
been seen at the w in d o w o f one o f the em pty and disused
room s. It did not rem ain stationary, but appeared to travel in an
elliptical path w h ich w as alw ays visible fro m the garden. T h e
reporter, w h o had b y then established him self in the village,
saw the light plainly and suggested to M r. R obinson that the
latter should g o to the room w ith another light and explore.
T his w as done and, fo r the space o f about a m inute, the watchers
fro m the garden saw two lights side b y side, one (our host’s)
b eing w aved about, the other quite stationary. B u t M r.
R obin son neither saw nor heard anything m the room .
T h a t w as the latest story that w as current w hen I arrived at
the M an o r on June 12 . H a vin g finished lunch, I asked to see the
staffo f the house. It consisted o f a y o u n g village girl (w h o slept
at hom e) and a daily gardener. O f course the girl k new all about
the traditions o f the place and solem nly assured m e that she had
seen ‘an old-fashioned coach’ on die law n, ‘d raw n b y tw o
horses’ . She said she had also seen the ‘nun’ leaning o ver a gate
near the house. I then learnt that w hen the R obinsons m o ved in
they b rough t w ith them fro m London a y o u n g m aid w h o
stayed fo r exactly fo rty-eight hours. Questioned about her sud­
den departure, she declared that near som e trees in the garden
she had seen a ‘nun w h o had frightened her’ . She had not been
told about the tradition, but nothing w o u ld induce her to stop.
I interviewed the old gardener, w h o inform ed m e he had never
seen the apparitions but had that v e ry w eek d ug up a skull
3 0 T h e M ost H aunted H ouse in Eng lan d
(supposed to be a relic o f the Great Plague) w hen rem oving
som e turf, and re-buried it in the churchyard.
I spent the rem ainder o f the afternoon and early evening ex­
ploring every inch o f the house, gardens, cellar, crypt, out­
houses and stables (over w hich w ere som e disused room s). M y
secretary and I, in our m inute exam ination o f every bell w ire,
w hich w e traced fro m the pull to the bell itself (they w ere the
old-fashioned variety, on springs), clim bed under the eaves and
w o rm ed our w a y between the top rafters and the tiles. W c
found a plaque on w h ich the original bell-hangers had w ritten
their names, ages, and date, but discovered nothing else. E v e ry
w ire seemed quite ordinary. W e could find nothing suspicious
in the house or grounds, so, after a meal, w e settled d o w n to
w ait fo r dusk.
It is at dusk that the ‘ nun’ is supposed to be m ost active, so
the Pressman and I decided to spend the evenm g in the garden.
M y secretary w as to report w h at took place m the house, w here
she w as on guard. W e arranged that I should keep m y eyes
glued on the back w in d o w s o f the building in w ait for the
‘light’, w hile the reporter watched the ‘N u n ’s W a lk ’. A s it was
getting chilly, w e stood m the d o o rw a y o f a large sum m er­
house. W e had been there nearly an hour w hen the reporter
suddenly gripped m y arm and w hispered: ‘There she is!’ I
looked tow ards the ‘N u n ’s W a lk ’ and sure enough there ap­
peared to be a sh adow y figure gliding d o w n the path under the
trees. A s he spoke, the newspaper m an dashed across the lawn.
W h en he returned, he inform ed m e that the figure became
m ore distinct as he approached it, but vanished as he reached
the spot. H e told m e that it ju st ‘m elted a w a y ’ . I did n ot see this
disappearance, as the reporter w as between the figure and m e.
Concluding that the ‘nun’ w o u ld not be seen again that night,
w e decided to enter die house. A s w e passed under the porch,
there w as a terrific crash and a pane o f glass from the ro o f
hurtled to the ground.
C onfessions o f a G h ost-H u nter 3 1
T h e glass missed us b y a fe w feet. It m ay have been coinci­
dence that a pane o f glass fell (for no ascertainable reason) just
as w e entered the porch, but it w as v e ry disconcerting. B u t that
w as not the w orst. W e entered the house and searched the
place fro m r o o f to cellar. Just as w e w ere com ing downstairs
after the investigation, a red glass candlestick, fro m the ‘B lue
R o o m ’ , w as flung d o w n the staircase w ell and struck an iron
stove in the hall. I w as splashed w ith splinters. Im m ediately
after, a m othball cam e tum bling d o w n the w ell. T h e o n ly per­
sons in the house w ere downstairs. (T h e m aid had gone hom e.)
I then decided to seal every door and w in d o w in the house. I
fetched fro m m y car the fitted case1 w hich I carry on these
occasions, and inserted screw-eyes in doors, posts, and w in d o w
frames. Tapes w ere threaded through the eyes, knotted, and the
knots sealed w ith post-office leaden seals. Then w e adjourned to
the ‘ B lue R o o m ’ to see w h at w o uld happen. It w as suggested
b y M r. R obin son that w c should hold a séance in this room ,
w here M r. W alter Percival had died. I was rather averse to the
proposal, as w e w ere not there to encourage the alleged ‘spirits’,
but rather to disperse them . H o w ever, I gave w a y , but insisted
upon the séance being held b y the light o f the pow erful duplex
paraffin lam p w h ich w e had earned upstairs. W e seated our­
selves on the bed and on the tw o chairs w h ich the ro o m co n -
tamed, and I m ade a short speech, addressing m y rem arks to the
four w alls o f the room . I protested that the manifestations w ere

I received other evidence as to the haunting o f K ------- M anor.
W h ile I w as in W ------- 1

gardener at the house and w h o had lived in the room s o ver the

as i f a huge dog had ju m ped fro m som e considerable height and
had then started running round the room . O ne night there w as
heard a tem ffic crash as i f the sideboard had toppled over,
smashing the ornaments m its fall. T h e gro o m ju m p ed out o f

placed— and the ‘d o g’ w as heard no m ore. D urin g m y investi­

three years previously, w as an under-nursem aid at the M anor.
She told m e that it w as com m on talk that the place w as
haunted. W h en she had been there a fortnight, she w as aw ak­
ened in the dead o f nigh t b y som eone m o vin g outside her bed­
room door. It sounded as i f a person w ere shuffling about in
slippers. T h e experience so unnerved her that her father re­
m o ved her from the place. There is m uch g o o d evidence fo r the
haunting o f K -------M anor.
D urin g m y first visit to K ------- 1

turbances w ere witnessed each evening. M y secretary stayed

III. Some Adventures in Haunted Houses
I
t is not generally realised that one can libel a house as surely
as one can libel a person. I f I w ere to assert in these Confessions
that a certain house w as haunted, dam ages could be claim ed.
B u t o n ly i f I originated the libel. A fe w years ago I was con­
sulted b y a daily newspaper w h ich had published a paragraph
that a certain country house w as the centre o f Poltergeist disturb­
ances. T h e o w n er (not the tenant, w h o rather enjoyed a bit o f
ghost-hunting) happened to see the notice and prom ptly issued
a w rit fo r alleged libel. T h e editor appealed to m e to help him .
H ad I an y record that the house w as supposed to be haunted? I
searched our files and archives, but could find no trace o f the
place, o f w h ich I had never heard. I f I could have produced tw o
lines o f printed m atter referring to the house as being ‘haunted’,
o r a person w h o could have proved that it w as ‘com m on k n o w ­
ledge’ the place w as possessed b y spirits, I could have saved the
D a ily — . B u t the newspaper had originated the story, and the p ro ­
prietors had to p ay. T h e case w as settled out o f court fo r £ 8 0 0 .
I have m ade this rather interesting digression in order to em ­
phasise h o w difficult it is fo r a ‘ghost-hunter’ fully to report and
publish all the facts about the houses he investigates. H e has to
be careful w ith his names o f persons and places. This is a pity,
as I believe in publishing the fullest details o f a case in w hich I
have been concerned, in order to authenticate it. I have acted on
this principle throughout these Confessions, w ith one or tw o
exceptions. B u t in the account o f m y adventures w hich form
die subject o f this chapter, I have been com pelled to w ithhold
certain inform ation b y means o f w h ich som e o f the places
could be identified.

G host-hunting (even professional ghost-hunting) is o f an­
cient origin and w as fully discussed as long ago as 1 5 7 2 w hen
Lavater’s fam ous book, O f Ghostes and Spirites W alking by
N yght,1 w as published. In m an y respects, the b ook m ight have
been w ritten yesterday, instead o f in the sixteenth century, and
it is a fact that Shakespeare d rew largely fro m the w o rk w hen
he w ro te H am let. T h e first chapter 'C o ncern ing certaine
wordes w hich are often used in this Treatise o f Spirits’ deals
w ith the terms spectrum, defined as ‘a substance w ithout a body,
w h ich beeing hcarde o r seene, m aketh m en afrayde’ , visions,
and apparitions. T h e author then w arns his readers to be
critical o f the evidence fo r spirits: 'M elancholike persons, and
m adde men, im agin m an y things w h ich in verie deede are not.
M en w h ich are dull o f sem g and hearing im agine m any things
w hich in v ery deed are not so.’ Lavater’s w o rds should be
em blazoned m neon lights o ver the portals o f every siance-
room . Lavater then proceeds to describe various fraudulent
phenom ena and again w arns us ‘T h a t m an y naturall things are
taken to be ghosts, as fo r exam ple, w h en they heare the cryin g
o f rats, cats, weasles, martins, o r an y other beast, o r w hen they

survival fro m every angle. C onsidering its antiquity, Lavater’s
is an am azing w o rk.
Lavater w as w ise in w arn in g his readers against m istaking
n orm al noises fo r supernorm al ones, and tw o incidents w h ich
cam e w ith in m y o w n experience are w o rth recording. T h e
first happened on N e w Y e a r’s E v e , w h en I w a s staying at a
house in a Shropshire village. I had retired to rest soon after ten
o ’clock, leaving m y bedroom w in d o w open according to m y
usual custom . A t about 1 1 .4 5 1w as aw akened b y the church
bells ringing in the N e w Y ear. T h e little church w as o n ly about
tw o hundred yards fro m the house m w h ich I w as staying. A s I
lay aw ake listening to them , I fancied that w ith their clangour
I could hear sweet m usic com ing fro m the dining-room , w hich
w as im m ediately b elo w m y bedcham ber. A s I listened, I could
distinctly hear faint chords as fro m a harp o r zither. T h en I re­
m em bered that in the apartm ent b elo w m e w as a piano, and it
occurred to m e that som eone m igh t be tw an gin g the strings,
producing a sort o f pizzicato effect. It sounded m ost w eird , and
one could easily have im agined a ghostly harpist in the room
belo w . I decided to investigate and m ade m y w a y to the lo w e r
storey. I qu ickly solved the m ystery. A ctua lly, the explanation
w as quite simple. I discovered that certain notes fro m the piano
recurred alw ays during a particular peal fro m the bells, and this
gave m e the clue to the ‘ghostly m usic’ . T h e w ires o f the piano
w ere vibrating in sym pathy w ith the noisy bells. T h is ‘sym ­
pathetic vibration’ is w ell k n o w n to physicists. In the sam e w a y
Caruso, the fam ous tenor, could em it a note that w o u ld crack
a w ine glass m the im m ediate vicinity.
T h e second incident I referred to occurred on Jan u ary 2 1 ,
19 26 , w h en the room s o f the N atio n al L ab o rato ry o f Psychical
Research w ere th ro w n open fo r public inspection. T h e building
had been n e w ly furnished and certain alterations had been car­
ried out. A fte r the cro w d s had departed, I decided to stay and
w o rk all nigh t at som e particular experim ent on w h ich I w as

engaged. T h e laboratory suite w as on the top floor o f the
building and no one but the caretakers, w h o occupied the base­
m ent flat, five floors below , w ere in die house. Y e t throughout
the nigh t I could hear noises such as raps and footsteps com ing
fro m the room s b elo w ours. A t first I thought they w ere caused
b y one o f the caretakers, but then I argued that these people
w o uld not be m o ving about so late at night. I decided to in­
vestigate.
I did so, and traced one noise to its source. In the lecture hall,
three floors b elo w the laboratory, there had been installed
during the d ay a lo w stage or platform m ade o f n ew w o o d .
T h e room s had been v e ry m uch heated in the evening, and in
the early hours o f the m orning w ere rapidly becom ing cooler.
A s the room cooled, the w o o d w o rk contracted, and the strain­
ing o f the joints em itted noises w h ich w ere m agnified m to w hat
sounded like ham m er blow s. I transferred a transmitting ther­
m ograph fro m the laboratory to the lecture hall, and noticed
that as the tem perature o f the apartment fell, so the sounds in­
creased. T h e m axim um drop m the therm ograph coincided
w ith the cessation o f the noises, the n ew w o o d being no longer
affected b y the fall m the temperature.
H a vin g n o w recorded h o w I ran to earth certain ‘ghostly’
noises, I w ill relate som e adventures m haunted houses in
w h ich , I am convinced, genuine phenom ena occurred. In parti­
cular, the derelict m ansion in Somersetshire m uch impressed
m e. T his house had stood em pty, on and off, fo r over thirty
years. N o agent could let it and even caretakers w ere afraid o f
rem aining in the place. T h e villagers declared that ‘fiendish
faces’, apparently suspended in the air, peered through the w in ­
d o w s o f the top floor. Footsteps w ere heard in locked room s
w hich had n ot been opened fo r tw en ty years, and the noise o f
boxes being dragged about the ro o m scared every caretaker
w h o attempted to live in the place. This latter noise w as a v e ry
curious one. People w h o declared they had heard the m anifesta-

dons said it w as as i f a h eavy b o x o r chest had been dropped
fro m a height, and then slo w ly dragged across the room .
O th er manifestations included an epidem ic o f broken w in ­
d o w s (caused probably b y small boys); and a curious sound re­
sem bling the ‘w h irr’ o f the w ings o f a giant bird o f p rey w hich
w as heard in various parts o f the building. I ascribed m ost o f
these alleged phenom ena to fear on the part o f the fe w care­
takers w h o had resided m the place, or to local gossip in the
village. B u t the ‘w h irrin g w ings’ phenom enon w as real
enough, as I discovered w h en I investigated the case.
I spent tw o w h o le days, and one night, in the Somersetshire
m ansion. Previous to m y visit, I interviewed several people in
die village (including tw o persons w h o had acted as caretakers
at different times) and received first-hand accounts o f the
haunting. T h e stones m ore or less tallied and w ere similar to
those contained m the report o f the place w h ich I had received
in London. I took w ith m e to the house one o f the m en w h o had
acted as custodian there about ten years previously, and w h o
k n ew every nook and com er o f the place.
W ith m y guide, I explored the house from top to bottom .
E veryth in g seemed norm al, except that the place w as in a
shocking state o f disrepair. W h a t w ere once fine Italian m oulded
ceilings littered the door, and m m an y o f the room s the w all­
papers w ere in ribbons. D am p w as s lo w ly consum ing the place.
It w as in February w hen I visited the mansion, and b y six
o ’clock it w as quite dark. W e had had som e provisions sent in
fro m die village inn, and after a sort o f high tea w e decided to
explore the place again. T h is tim e I w as rew arded fo r the
trouble and expense I had been put to in investigating the
affair, and I added to m y case-book the details o f one o f the
strangest phenom ena I have ever experienced.
It w as on die fourth (top) floor w here w e heard the curious
noise w h ich had been likened to that o f a fly in g bird. B u t to m e
it sounded like som ething betw een the h um m ing w h irr a
C onfessions o f a G host-H u nter 4 1
circular saw makes w hen in m otion and a strong w in d rushing
through a g u lly o r narrow passage. T h e place had been used as
a b o x ro o m and there w as neither chim ney nor ventilator in the
room . There w as a fairly large w in d o w w h ich , after som e
trouble, m y com panion succeeded in opening. T h e ‘w h irrin g '
stopped instantly. W e closed die w in d o w and again the pheno­
m enon w as heard. Then w e closed both door and w in d o w , but
the ‘w h irring’ sound persisted. W h eth er the door w as open o r
closed m ade no difference to the phenom enon. B u t im m e­
diately w e opened the w in d o w , the ‘rushing w in d ’ effect w as
not apparent.
T h e sceptic w ill naturally conclude that the noise w e heard
w as caused b y the w in d outside forcing its w a y through cracks
and crevices into the b o x room , thus deceiving us m to believing
that w e w ere w itnessing som ething abnorm al. W e ll, the scep­
tic w ill be w ro n g , because it happened to be a cold, frosty
nigh t w ith not even a slight breeze. It w as also v e ry clear and
starry, and fro m the open w in d o w o f the b o x room w e could
see the lights o f M inehead m an y miles aw ay.
W e m ade ourselves com fortable on som e old rugs w e had
b rought w ith us, and spent the night on the floor, tryin g to
keep w a rm and hoping that som ething w o u ld happen. A ctu ­
ally, nothing further did happen. T w ic e during die night I
w en t to the b o x room , and the w hirring could be heard on
each occasion. I spent the w h o le o f the n ext day— w hich w as
w et— in the house, and heard nothing until it w as nearly dark,
w h en the w in d phenom enon recom m enced. I returned to
London . I think it w as this particular manifestation w h ich gave
the house its sinister reputation.
A year o r so after m y visit I w as m otoring in Som erset and
m ade a detour in order to h ave another look at the m ansion.
T o m y surprise, the builders w ere hard at w o rk reconstructing
the premises. It is n o w a ‘boarding establishment fo r yo u n g
ladies’ and is occasionally advertised in the scholastic press. I

afraid not.
W h eth er the rebuilding o f a ‘haunted’ house is an infallible
m ethod o f dislodging a disturbing entity is open to doubt, as I
h ave records o f sites upon w h ich h ave been erected a succession
o f buildings, all o f w hich have acquired the sam e reputation o f
possessing Poltergeists. B u t it is probable that the traditions w ere
m erely handed d o w n fro m generation to generation. Fo r
exam ple, I once spent a night in a house near H a yw a rd ’s Heath
concerning w h ich a story w as current that C ro m w e ll’s soldiers
had once been quartered in a previous building on the sam e
site, and that, nigh t after nigh t, the sounds o f revelry and
strange oaths w ere still to be heard. I visited the house on tw o
occasions, but could n ot m ake sure that I heard anything abnor­
m al. It is curious that the great m ajority o f alleged haunted
houses o w e their reputations to the fact that the manifestations
are aural and not visual. A t this same Sussex ‘haunt’ it w as
alleged that the tram p o f soldiers could be heard at certain times
o f the year. T h e villagers are convinced that the dead C ro m ­
w ellian soldiers have stam ped their personality upon the place.

that there w as a haunted cottage on the old R o m a n site, I
visited the place and m ade som e inquiries. I happened to be
spending a vacation in Shropshire, so it w as convenient fo r m e
to com bine a little ghost-hunting w ith m y holiday.
Fro m the description o f the place w h ich I received, I had no
difficulty in finding the cottage, w h ich w as occupied b y a yo u n g
cattle dealer, his w ife and a little girl aged three years. T h e y
did not k n o w I w as com ing and I refrained fro m w riting in case
the village turned out en masse to w elcom e m e. I live in a village
m yself, and news travels quickly in such places.
T h e dealer w as surprised to see m e, and astonished w hen I
told him the reason fo r m y visit at such a late hour. It w as
nearly ten o ’clock on a June evening. Fortunately, Sum m er
T im e— that bane o f ghost-hunters— had not been invented. I
w as invited into the kitchen-parlour, and for m ore than an hour
I plied m y host and his w ife w ith questions concerning the
alleged disturbances. Y es, they had often seen a y o u n g girl, clad
m a R o m a n stola (this is not the w o rd he used) o f w hite linen,
slo w ly clim bing the few stairs w h ich led to the upper room s o f
the cottage. T h e apparition w as never seen at an y other spot
except on the stairs— alw ays clim bing and never descending.
She invariably vanished as she reached the small landing at die
head o f the stairs. B o th husband and w ife had m et ‘the girl’, but
the m an had seen nothing else. B u t his w ife— it w as alleged—
had frequendy encountered various figures m togas, cro w d in g
outside the cottage door, and alw ays w hen it w as dusk o r nearly
dusk. T h e w o m an declared that on m an y occasions, as she
opened die door, she had seen a num ber o f men dressed as
R o m a n civilians (w h om she described in detail) standing out­
side the door as i f about to cro w d into the cottage. B u t they
alw ays vanished before the d oor could be fully opened. H er
husband declared that his w ife (a Scotsw om an) possessed
‘ second sight’— a faculty w h ich w as shared b y other m em bers
o f her fam ily.

Questioned as to w hether they e ver heard anything, both the
dealer and his w ife said that raps, footsteps, and ‘a rum bling
sound as o f h eavy wheels rolling o ver cobbles’ had been heard
infrequently. I w as about to take m y departure w hen the dealer
asked m e i f I cared to spend the n igh t in the house. A lth o u gh I

and the o n ly spare bedroom w as placed at m y disposal. A fte r a
substantial meal o f fat pickled pork, red cabbage and hom e­
brew ed beer, w e drank the tim e-honoured toast to ‘all friends
round the W re k in ’ in som e excellent sloe gin, and I retired to
m y room . I did n ot undress, but sat reading b y the light o f tw o
candles and a stable lantern. T h e only disturbance that night
w as caused b y a bat w h ich flew through m y open w in d o w and
knocked a candle o ver. There w ere the usual sounds that one
hears at nigh t: the call o f birds, o w ls hooting, timbers creaking,
etc., but I could n ot persuade m yse lf that the noises w ere
abnorm al. C uriously enough, I did not feel sleepy, w hich w as
v e ry unusual. Soon after five o ’clock I heard the dealer m o ving
about the house, so I had a w ash and jo m ed him . H e w as not
surprised that I had neither seen nor heard anything, and sug­
gested m y spending another n igh t m the cottage. ‘I f yo u sleep
on the stairs’, he said, ‘yo u w ill be bound to see the girl sooner
o r later.’ B u t I w as due back in Sh rew sbury and could spare no
m ore tim e on the R o m a n ghosts. A fte r breakfast— w hich , like
the supper, consisted o f bacon and beer— I took m y departure.
M y visit w as not quite w ithout result, as I w as put m the w a y o f
acquiring a R o m a n amphora, in perfect condition, w hich had
been found som ewhere in die neighbourhood.
Speaking o f cottages rem inds m e that in 19 2 5 I investigated
one in Surrey, and in m an y w a y s the case is unique. T h e cottage
itself w as not haunted, but the tenants continually heard foot­
steps on the gravel path w h ich encircled the building. T h e
manifestations com m enced as soon as the place w as occupied.
C on fession s o f a G h o st-H u nter 4 5
D urin g the first w eek, the w o m an tw ice w en t to the door,
thinking it w as the postm an, but n o one w as there. T h e path
had been n ew ly gravelled and die lightest step upon it could be
heard w ithin the house, w h ich w as o ff the m ain road and quite
isolated. T h e o n ly occupants o f the cottage w ere the husband
and w ife , the form er being out all day.
A peculiarity o f this particular ‘haunt’ w as that the footsteps
w ere heard punctually at 8 .30 on m ost m ornings, but especially
tow ards the end o f the w eek , though never on a Sunday. A
w atch w as kept in the garden fro m certain sheds that com ­
m anded a v ie w o f the path w ay, but the peram bulating ghost
w as never seen, and never heard except fro m w ithin the cottage.
U n aw are that the entity never ‘w alked’ on a Sunday, I first
visited the cottage on a Saturday night, hoping to hear the
footsteps on the fo llo w in g m orning. Learning that this w as
high ly im probable, on the Sunday I busied m yse lfw ith m aking
four w id e and shallow trenches across the path. I filled these
trenches w ith a m ixture o f flour and silver sand w h ich I m ade
perfectly sm ooth w ith a n ewspaper in die hope that die ghost’s
footprints w o u ld be impressed upon it. N e x t m orning I w as up
early, had breakfast, and w aited fo r the m tangible visitor. O n
the stroke o f half-past eight, the steps could be heard approach­
ing. T h e y appeared to com e fro m the back o f the cottage.
T here w as nothing peculiar about the steps— it w as just as i f a
m an, w ith rather a firm tread, w ere approaching the house. I
ran into the sm all hall and peered through the letter-box. N o th ­
ing w as seen to pass, but I could hear the footsteps as they cam e
nearer and nearer, and gradually died aw ay. I rushed out o f the
cottage, but could find no one. I searched the buildings w ithout
success. T h e m an belonging to the house had left fo r w o rk soon
after seven o ’clock and n o servant w as em ployed. There w ere
no animals in the im m ediate neighbourhood. T h e nearest habi­
tation w as nearly h a lf a m ile a w ay. I w as convinced that no
person w as p laying a trick on m e. I exam ined m y trenches, but
4 6 Som e A dventures in H aunted H ouses
they w ere quite unm arked. I w as disappointed that no impres­
sions o f footprints w ere visible— even the m ark o f a cloven
h o o f w o u ld have been acceptable! I visited the cottage three
tim es in all, but heard the footsteps on the first occasion only.
T h e cottage becam e vacant a fe w m onths after m y last visit; the
place w as taken b y tw o maiden ladies w h o turned the house into
a tea garden. It did not pay, but w hether the ‘footsteps' o r the
lack o f custom w as responsible fo r their vacating the cottage, I
n ever ascertained. B u t the place is still em pty.
O ne does n ot usually associate a London playhouse w ith the
occult; and the dressing-room o f a popular musical com ed y
actress is the last place one w o u ld expect to be haunted. B u t it
w as to the A delphi Theatre that I w as called a fe w years ago in
order to investigate an alleged ‘ghost’ .
It w as at the stage door o f the Adelphi Theatre in 18 9 7 that
W illia m Terriss w as m urdered, and it w as into the dressing-
ro o m afterwards occupied b y the actress in question that his
b o d y w as carried. I interviewed a num ber o f dressers, firem en
and stage-hands, and they all claim ed to have heard the strange
noises. T h e actress inform ed m e that tim e after time, w hen
resting o n a certain couch, between the afternoon and evening
perform ances, she had been awakened b y loud noises in her
room , and thum ps com ing fro m under the couch. Friends w h o
had been w ith her on these occasions verified her statements.
O nce she aw oke w ith a scream and afterwards said her arm felt
as i f it had been gripped b y a hand. Later— I w as inform ed—
fo u r w eals appeared on her arm , exactly as i f four fingers had
tightly gripped the flesh. T h is sto ry w as confirm ed b y a friend
o f the actress. I w as asked i f I k n e w a m edium w h o could get
into touch w ith w hatever w as causing the disturbance. I said I
did not, but I happened to have arranged fo r that evening a
sitting w ith Stella C .,1 the fam ous physical m edium . I said I
w o u ld bring her to the theatre.
'See Sulla C .: an Account of Some Original Experiments in Psychical Re­
search,by Harry Price, London, 1925.
C onfessions o f a G h ost-H u nter 4 7
I held a séance in the dressing-room w ith Stella w h ich lasted
until 2 .3 0 in the m orn ing; but the conditions— an atm osphere
o f Pressmen and tobacco sm oke— w ere n ot v e ry favourable for
die experim ents. Nevertheless, w e did get a fe w phenom ena,
though these w ere undoubtedly due to Stella’s presence. I asked
the actress to sit on the couch, and later she declared that she
felt the fam iliar thum ps beneath it. O n e really curious incident
happened: during the séance a sudden crash cam e fro m the
direction o f the m irror o ver the mantelpiece. E veryo n e heard it,
and w e speculated as to w h at it could be; it sounded as i f som e­
thing had fallen heavily, although the crash seemed to com e
from behind the glass. T h e m irror itself w as untouched. This
w as certainly strange, but the late hour prevented m y m aking
further experim ents. I heard nothing m ore about the ‘haunted
dressing-room ’, w hich , i f it did nothing else, provided con­
siderable publicity fo r a num ber o f people.
M y adventures in haunted houses have not been confined to
British soil. In 19 2 8 I heard fro m the late A lb ert Freiherr vo n
Schrenck -N o tzing that a m ost extraordinary Poltergeist case in a
house at M u nich w as occup yin g his attention. H e invited m e to
co-operate in its elucidation. T h e haunting w as unique inas­
m uch that, in addition to the usual Poltergeist phenom ena, there
w ere other strange occurrences outside the house, w h ich ap­
peared to have a bearing on the case.
I decided to accept B aro n vo n Schrenck’s invitation, but I
w as delayed in various w a y s and, ju st as I w as about to start fo r
M u nich , I heard that the manifestations had suddenly ceased.
H o w ever, the case is so interesting that I m ake no ap o lo gy for
including it in this chapter.
In M unich, as m m ost Continental cities, the m ajority o f the
residents live in flats. It w as in one o f these, in an appartement o f
fo ur room s on the second floor o f a building in the A u gusten-
strasse, that the curious happenings took place.
T h e flat had fo r m an y years been occupied b y an elderly lady,

die w id o w o f a doctor. She had let one ro o m to a chem ical
student and, eigh t days before die com m encem ent o f die extra­
ordinary events I am about to relate, she had dismissed her
servant on account o f ‘m alevolence’, and had engaged as a n ew
m aid a g irl o f fourteen years.
T h e lady w en t out fo r a little w h ile one afternoon and only
die m aid and the lodger w ere left at hom e. Suddenly the front­
door bell rang. T h e girl opened the door and saw a tall man
w ith a dark cloak and blue hat standing before her. Fo r some
reason that she could never explain, she no sooner set eyes on
him than she frit afraid. T h e girl answered the d oor perhaps
tw en ty times a d ay, but this m an w as ‘different’ fro m all other
visitors. It seemed to her there w as som ething uncanny about
h im . Sh e w as a little frightened b y his dark and o ld -w o rld
clothes and his staring eyes, though he m erely asked politely for
die servant w h o had ju st been dismissed. A t this the girl began to
trem ble, and w h en she inform ed the stranger that the person he
w anted w as no longer in the house, he becam e abusive. T h e
m aid plucked up sufficient courage to close and lock the door m
his face, and then reported the incident to the lodger, w h o at once
w en t to look fo r the m ysterious intruder. H e could not be found.
T w o hours later, after the w id o w had returned, strange
things began to happen in the flat. A t first, the door bell rang
violently. T h e ringing lasted an hour, yet no one w as to be seen
at the door. T here follow ed a violent ‘drum m ing’ on the door,
though the drum m er rem ained invisible. T h is continued for
som e tim e, and then the fam ily w ere th ro w n into a state o f
panic, fo r it seemed as i f the disturbing entity had entered the
flat. Glasses, plates, vases, tum blers, spoons and various other
articles w ere flung in all directions b y an unseen hand. D oors
and w in d o w s opened b y themselves, and the w ardrobe m irror
w as smashed to pieces b y som e invisible object. A reel o f thread
w as throw n through the letter-box o f die door and as suddenly
disappeared.

Furniture m oved o f its o w n volition. N o th in g w o u ld stay in
its place fo r five consecutive minutes. O vercoats hanging in the
hall w ere m ysteriously transported to other room s. T h e m aid
w o uld d ose a draw er one m om ent, and it w o uld be opened and
die contents turned out b y unseen hands the next. T h e manifes­
tations becam e so alarm ing that finally the police w ere sum­
m oned.
D urin g the exam ination o f the room s and their contents, the
manifestations w en t on w ithout interruption. In the w id o w ’s
bedroom a tum bler o f w ater filled itself, flew across die room ,
and the contents splashed on her bed. W h en she picked up the
tum bler and placed it on a table, it flew o ff and smashed itself
against the w all. In the student’s bed w ere found a b o w l filled
w ith w ater, shoes and plates; on the m aidservant’s bed w ere
found a bottle o f w ater and a sprig o f a fir-tree w h ich be­
longed to a bunch in the hall. In her trunk w as discovered the
missing reel o f thread w hich had so m ysteriously found its w a y
through the letter-box. Behind a curtain w ere found several
valuable vases w h ich in som e inexplicable manner had been
rem oved fro m their usual positions. W h ilst these discoveries
w ere being m ade the strange displacement o f objects con­
tinued.
O n another occasion, w hen the police w ere actually in the
flat, a fire broke out m one o f the room s w ithout an y apparent
cause. A knife w as throw n at, and struck one o f the policem en,
and a glass fell on his head. It is said that the m ysterious stranger
w as again seen at the flat early in the m orning on the day after
his first visit, but quickly disappeared on being detected. N o
explanation o f the extraordinary occurrences w as forthcom ing.
T h e spiritualists claim ed that the stranger w as a ghost w h o w as
seeking som e object. W h eth er there w as any truth in this, I
cannot say. A m ore likely explanation is that the manifestations
w ere caused b y the maidservant. E v en the police had to confess
themselves baffled, w hich , to say the least o f it, is v ery unusual
5 0 Som e A dventu res in H aunted H ouses
in such affairs. Eventually, as in m ost Poltergeist cases, die mani­
festations com pletely subaided.
I rem em ber y et another peculiar 'haunting’ I investigated on
die C ontinent. This w as in a house at Hall, near Innsbruck,
w h ich w as alleged to be occupied b y a particularly vindictive
'spirit’ . Several observers stated that i f any person attempted to
enter the place after nightfall, a v ery p o w erful ‘som ething’
flung h im out w ith great force. It appeared that the ‘thing’ had
a particular antipathy even to inanimate objects, fo r i f a hat
w ere throw n into die open d o o rw a y, it w o u ld return like a
boom erang.
Personally, I saw n othing o f these w onders, fo r I m anaged to
enter the house w ithout hindrance, though appearances indi­
cated there w as som ething w ro n g . N o t o nly did the atm os­
phere appear especially oppressive, but also, on several occa­
sions, objects m oved w ith out apparent physical contact. O nce
o r tw ice w h en I w as there, room s w ere sealed up, yet w hen
they w ere opened, chairs, carefully placed in a certain order,
w ere found to have m oved. I w ill not w ea ry the reader w ith
further details o f these manifestations, since they had m uch in
com m on w ith m any others that I have described in these Con­
fessions. T h e case possessed all the usual features associated w ith
a Poltergeist— even the stories o f ‘ miracles’ w h ich never hap­
pened!
T h e ‘highest’ haunting I have ever know n w as also due to an
alleged Poltergeist, w h ich manifested in the C oncordia H ütte on
the Concordia-Platz, one o f the c h iefm ountaineering centres in
Switzerland. Huts, as the reader is aw are, are erected all o ver the
A lps b y the Sw iss A lp ine C lu b and are intended to serve as
refuges fo r persons w h o require shelter, the interiors being fully
equipped w ith food, firing, bedding, and all the necessities fo r a
com fortable night.
O ne d ay, in the C oncordia H u t on die G reat Alctsch Glacier
near the Jungfraujoch, nearly 12,0 0 0 feet above sea-level, a m an
C onfessions o f a G h o st-H u nter 5 1
w as found dead. H e had been to the Lotschen-Lucke Pass, had
apparently lost his w a y , and had staggered into the hut, too ex­
hausted even to light a fire: die paralysing cold o f an Alpine
nigh t crept upon him and he perished before a rescue party
could arrive.
T h e fo llo w in g sum m er, a p arty o f tourists also had occasion
to seek the shelter o f the hut. T h e y had been there but a fe w
hours w h en they felt that som ething w as the m atter w ith die
place, and they w ere thoroughly scared. I w as inform ed that n ot
a thing in the hut w o u ld stay in its place. T h e tourists lit a
lantern, and ‘invisible hands' extinguished it; they tried to pre­
pare a m eal, and the mischievous G eist scattered the utensils;
they attem pted to sleep, and the unseen and unw elcom e tenant
o f the hut vio len d y disarranged the blankets! T h e w ho le party
spent a miserable nigh t and, ju st as daw n w as breaking, they
decided to quit the place, and descended m to Interlaken. I hap­
pened to be staying at this beautiful Swiss resort at the tim e, and
w hen they arrived I w as consulted. I had to say that (assuming
their story to be true in every particular) the strange manifesta­
tions could be accounted fo r o n ly b y the presence o f a Polter­
geist induced, the spiritualists w o uld declare, b y the dead m oun­
taineer w h o had been found in the hut a fe w m onths previously.
I w ill continue m y adventures in foreign haunted houses
w ith an account o f one I investigated at the beautiful spa o f
B ad en-b ei-W ien . I w as staying in Vienn a at the tim e, and read
in one o f die papers that m uch excitem ent prevailed in Baden
o w in g to an alleged ghost that w as haunting a cheap pension not
far fro m the Theresienstrasse. I took an electric tram to Baden,
w here I arrived about seven o ’clock in the evening. I m ade m y
w a y to the house, presented m y card, and heard the story o f the
haunting. It appears that on the m orning o f the previous d ay, a
yo u n g girl staying at the pension had com m itted suicide b y
th ro w in g herself fro m one o f the upper w ind o w s. T h e b o d y
had been rem oved to the m ortuary.
5 2 Som e A dventures in H aunted H ouses
T w en ty-fo u r hours later, passers-by declared they saw her
staring o ut o f the identical w in d o w fro m w h ich she had leapt to
her death. Boarders in the house w ere convinced that they
could hear screams com ing fro m die ro o m she had occupied. I
spent som e hours in die pension and m ust adm it that I, too,
thought I heard v e ry faint screams com ing fro m the girl’s room .
B u t w h en I entered the apartm ent, I could neither see n or hear
anything unusual. B y the tim e I had finished m y investigation,
it w as v e ry late and I w as fortunate in finding a taxi to take m e
back to Vienna. N e x t d ay I again visited the place, and stood
fo r som e hours outside the pension in the hope o f seeing the
‘free at die w in d o w ’ . I w as unfortunate, and saw nothing—
except the gapin g crow ds w h ich im peded the traffic. I returned
to Vienna. T h e Baden ghost died a natural death— i f I can use
such an expression— and I am still w onderin g w hether I really
heard those faint screams outside the dead girl’s room . Im agina­
tion plays a m ajor part in these cases.
I w ill close this chapter b y relating an experience in m y m ost
picturesque haunted house. T h e ‘house’ happens to be a G erm an
castle, the B u rg Falkenstein, in the H arz Mountains, O n
O cto b er i , 19 3 5 , Fraulein G erda K noche, a la w student fro m
Gottingen U niversity, M r. R . S. Lam bert and I decided to ex­
plore the Schloss Falkenstein. W e w ere staying at Halberstadt,
and an hour’s car ride to o k us to Ballenstedt, in the Eastern
Harz, above w h ich is Falkenstein Castle. A fte r a stiff clim b
through pine w ood s, w e arrived at the castle. It is 10 50 fret
above sea-level, and is situated on a lo fty rock. It dates back to
the eleventh century, and is, I think, one o f the m ost beautiful
specimens o f a mediaeval residence I have ever seen. It is com ­
pletely equipped w ith contem porary furniture, trophies o f the
chase, and other antiquities. It is a veritable museum .
A t certain tim es o f die year the ow ner, the G r a f vo n Asse-
bourg, resides in the Schloss, w h ich is usually occupied b y care­
takers o nly. W e w ere conducted o v er the castle and show n in -
C on fession s o f a G h o st-H u nter 53
num erable objects o f interest. W e saw the ro o m w here, be­
tw een 1 19 8 and 12 3 5 , the jurist E y k e v o n R e p k o w w ro te the
Sachsenspiegel, the oldest G erm an legal code. W e w ere show n
die room s occupied b y B ism arck, and visited die chapel in
w h ich M artin Luther used to preach. Leading out o f this chapel
is a d oor, w ith a massive iron lock. W e w ere told that that door
has n ot been opened fo r five hundred years and no one k no w s
w h at is in the ro o m (which has no w ind o w s) beyond it. I f ever
die d oor is opened, disaster w ill befall the ow ners, and the house
w ill perish. I m ust adm it that I w as sceptical concerning the
story. Five hundred years is a lon g tim e, and it seemed fantastic
that n o one has been curious enough, o r bold enough, to brave
the ‘curse* during this period.
B u t w h at interested m e m ost w as the fact that the Schloss
contained a ‘haunted bed’. It is a high, n arrow affair o f carved
w o o d , in a large apartm ent h ung w ith tapestries. Ancient furni­
ture and bedroom utensils are in keeping w ith the ‘W h ite
L a d y ’ w h o is alleged to haunt the cham ber. I could obtain no
precise inform ation as to w h o the lad y w as, except that she is
supposed to be an ancestress o f the present o w ner o f the Schloss.
T h e caretakers have seen her m an y times, at dusk, alw ays ho v­
ering round the bed, as i f she w ere protecting som eone or
som ething in it. T h e bed itself looked quite com fortable.
T h o u g h antique, the linen sheets appeared m od em , i f som e­
w h at dam p and cold. M r. Lam bert and I asked perm ission to
spend the n igh t w ith the ‘W h ite L a d y o f Falkenstein’, and w ere
inform ed that this m igh t be possible i f w e could obtain the con­
sent o f the ow n er o f the Schloss. W e said w e w o u ld try.
T h e H err G r a f vo n A ssebourg has a large m ansion on the
edge o f a forest a fe w miles fro m Falkenstein, and w e w ere for­
tunate in finding the fam ily in residence, though the C o u n t
h im self w as hunting deer in the forest. W e w ere introduced to
his daughter, w h o laughed heartily w h en she heard o ur strange
request. O f course, she had heard o f the ‘W h ite L a d y ’, but as
5 4 Som e A dventu res in H aunted H ouses
she had never slept in the haunted bed, she had not seen her.
She confirm ed the custodian’s story that the ‘curse ro o m ’ had
not been opened fo r five hundred years. ‘I am not superstitious’,
she said, ‘but I should n ot like to open die door, and I do not
k n o w w h at the room contains.’ She could n ot give us perm is­
sion to investigate the ‘W h ite L a d y ’, and asked us to telephone
die H err G r a f w h en he returned fro m the chase. This w e did,
but w ere inform ed that he could not a llo w the room — or the
'W h ite L a d y’— to be disturbed. H e pointed o ut that the custo­
dians o f the Schloss had no facilities fo r entertaining visitors;
that the bed linen w as dam p; and that w e should be miserable
i f w e attem pted to spend a night in the place. W e w ere disap­
pointed, but consoled ourselves w ith the fret that w e had had a
thoroughly ‘mediaeval’ d ay, and had witnessed the strange
phenom enon o f a G erm an aristocrat and his retainers still
hunting the deer m his o w n forest, ju st as his ancestors did nine
hundred years ago. T h e swastika has w ro u gh t m any changes,
but the H arz rem ains inviolate.
IV . The Strange Exploits o f a London Poltergeist
K
Ion is so infrequently visited b y an alleged Poltergeist that
hen one does put in an appearance, so to speak, it natur­
ally causes considerable excitem ent. This is w h at happened a
fe w y ea n ago, the disturbances— v e ry real, w hether norm al o r
supernorm al— lasting nearly tw o months.
T h e focus o f the manifestations w as centred in a sm all villa
in a South London suburb, a bustling w orking-class district
w ith n o attractions, one w o u ld have thought, for a Poltergeist.
T h e villa w as inhabited b y a M r. E d w a rd Sm ith,1 an invalid
o f eigh ty-six, w h o had lived there tw en ty-five years, and w h o
w as rem oved to the infirm ary at the request o f the fam ily w hen
the disturbances com m enced. W ith M r. Sm ith, senior, lived
his son W alter, a tutor aged tw enty-seven, and his three sisters:
M iss L u c y Sm ith; M iss A n ne Sm ith; and M rs. H arold W e st, a
w id o w , w h o had a fourteen-year-old son C y r il. T h e Misses
Sm ith w ere school teachers.
T h e house in B u ry R o a d is o f a type o f w hich tens o f thou­
sands can be found scattered all round the M etropolis. It has
tw o floors and a small garden at front and rear. It is the typical
abode o f the Lo nd o n artisan. Fro m the garden o f the B u r y
R o a d house can be seen the back w in d o w s o f som e premises

It w as ju st before Christm as 19 2 7 that I first heard o f the
strange happenings in B u ry R o a d , but I attached no im port­
ance to the report, w hich differed h ide fro m m an y others w hich
I am continually receiving. Later, I received further inform a­
tion fro m a private source.
O n Thursday, Janu ary 1 9 ,1 9 2 8 , at 9 .30 a.m ., I paid m y first
visit. I found the fam ily at breakfast, and m y first impression
w as distinctly favourable as regards the fam ily and also as to the
im probability o f the inmates o f the house being responsible for
the destruction o f their o w n hom e. Fo r I at once saw that some­
one o r som ething had caused considerable dam age to the Sm ith
ni¿nage. B roken w in d o w s, sm ashed furniture, and the débris o f
ornaments w ere m uch in evidence. A fte r a few minutes’ chat
I w ith d rew and prom ised to call again.
O n returning to m y office I found a message fro m the editor
o f the Evening N ew s asking i f I w o u ld allo w a reporter o f that
paper to accom pany m e to the house. I consented, and at three
o ’clo ck the same afternoon a car w as sent fo r m e, and fo r the
second tim e that d ay I found m yse lf in B u ry R o a d — this n m r
w ith a Press representative.

o f Jan u ary 19 , and fro m them w e obtained the com plete story
o f the disturbances.
‘E x cep t fo r C y r il’, said M r. Sm ith, ‘w e have lived in the
house fo r tw en ty-five years, happily and peacefully. T hen on
N o vem b er 2 9 lum ps o f coal, pieces o f soda and pennies began
to fall on the conservatory— a lean-to building at the back o f
the house.
‘T h in gs becam e so serious*, M r . Sm ith continued, ‘that I
decided to call the police. I had no other idea except that som e

person w as throw ing things over the garden w all. A constable
cam e along, and together w e stood in the back garden and kept
w atch. Pieces o f coal and pennies crashed on to the conserva­
to ry r o o t but w e could n ot trace their flight. O ne lum p o f coal
hit the constable's helm et. H e ran to the garden w all, but there
w as nob o d y there. O n D ecem ber 19 our w asherw om an said
she w o u ld not w o rk any longer in the house. She cam e to m e in
a state o f terror and pointed to a heap o f red-hot cinders in the
outhouse. T here w as no fire there. H o w could they have go t
there? A g a in I called a constable, and w e decided to w atch in
the kitchen. T w o potatoes w ere hurled m w hile w e w ere sitting
there. It w as on M o n da y that the clim ax came— at nine o ’clock
in the m orning— and fo r an hour w e w ere terror-stricken.
Th ere w ere loud bangings m all parts o f the house. M y sister
ran to tell the m agistrate. T h e w in d o w panel in m y father’s
bedroom w as smashed, and I decided, as he w as in such a state o f
fear, to rem ove him fro m the house.1 1 called in a m an fro m the
street, and together w e carried him fro m the room . Just as w e
w ere taking h im out a h eavy chest o f drawers crashed to the
floor in his bedroom . Previously m y sister had seen the hall-
stand sw aying and had called m e. I caught it before it fell, but
som e strange p o w er seemed to tear it fro m m y hands, and it
fell against the stain, b reaking in tw o parts.'
A fte r w e had heard the history o f the disturbances fro m their
beginning, the reporter and I m ade a tour o f the house and
carefully inspected the dam age, w h ich w as considerable. Sev­
eral o f the w in d o w s w ere broken, som e w ith sm all holes in
them as i f stones had been fired at them b y means o f a catapult.
Som e o f the panes o f glass o f the conservatory ro o f w ere also
shattered, and lyin g on the ro o f w ere pebbles, pennies, lum ps o f
coal, potatoes, pieces o f soda, etc., w h ich had been th row n
there. A door inside the house had also one o f its glass panels
broken.

In die back bedroom w e found the panels o f the door shat­
tered; a h eavy chest o f drawers w as splintered as i f fro m a fall;
and the rem ains o f several smashed ornaments w ere scattered
about, h i the hall w e saw a smashed hat-stand in tw o pieces and
w e view ed the rem ains o f tw o broken bedroom doors, a tea
tray w ith one o f its sides ripped off, and num bers o f pictures
w h ich had fallen to the ground. In the sm all garden w ere strewn
lum ps o f soda, coal, etc., and M r. Sm ith pointed out tw o w in ­
d o w s o f neighbouring houses w h ich had received the unw el­
com e attention o f the alleged G rist: both had small holes in
them as i f caused b y stones shot fro m a catapult.
A fte r our tour o f inspection w e returned to the kitchen,
w here d ie fo ur o f us— M iss A n ne Sm ith, M r. W a lte r Sm ith, the
Evening N ew s representative, and m y se lf—stood chatting. W e
w ere die sole occupants o f die house. T h e reporter and I w ere
ju st about to take o ur departure w h en som e hard object fell
w ith a resounding th w ack in the passage at the back o f us. T h e
kitchen is connected w ith the scullery b y a short passage. T h e
scullery leads directly to the garden b y a door w h ich w e had
ju st closed.
U p o n the fall o f the object w e four at once proceeded into
the passage and found that a m etal ferro-cenum gas-lighter,
w eigh in g tw o ounces, w ith a w ooden handle (over-all length
about eight inches), w as lyin g m id w a y between the kitchen
and scullery. U ndoubtedly, it had been projected from behind
us and had, apparently, struck the w a ll in its flig h t W e im m e­
diately retraced our steps through the scullery and into the
garden, but no one w as visible. N o th in g further occurred that
day.
N e x t m orning I w as rung up b y the editor o f the Evening
N ew s, w h o told m e that the authorities had rem oved yo un g
Sm ith fo r observation as to his m ental state. I w as astounded at
this fresh developm ent. I had had an hour’s conversation w ith
W alter Sm ith on the previous d ay and had found him quite

norm al and v e ry intelligent. It appears that the police had
form ed a theory that M r. Sm ith, ju nio r, w as responsible fo r the
manifestations and decided to exam ine him at a local hospital
I again visited the house on M o n d a y afternoon (January 2 3)
and had a long interview w ith M rs. W est, the w id o w ed sister.
T h e Evening N ew s reporter again accom panied m e.
T h e fact that M r. W alter Sm ith w as not n o w in the house
m ade no difference to the alleged phenom ena. M rs. W e st told
us that during the w eek-end the manifestations had been both
varied and violent; besides the usual arrival o f pieces o f c o a l
etc., there had been ‘great activity am ongst the furniture’.
Chairs, o f their o w n volition, ‘had m arched d o w n the hall
single file’ , and three times M rs. W e st attempted to lay the
table for Saturday’s dinner. O n each occasion the chairs had
piled themselves up on the table, m aking it impossible fo r the
w o m an to proceed w ith the preparation o f the m e a l A t die
third tim e she w en t out into the road and asked a police officer
w h o w as on duty there to enter the house and exam ine the
‘ phenom ena’ himself. H e naturally accused M rs. W e st o f piling
up the furniture herself. A London policem an has litde im agin­
ation!
Th ree persons appear to have witnessed die alleged spon­
taneous m ovem ent o f the furniture, v iz . M rs. W est, M iss
Sm ith, and C y r il W est, the fourteen-year-old b o y, w h o w as so
frightened— it w as stated— that he could hardly be induced to
sit on a chair in case it should m ove. H e w as afterwards sent to
the country to recuperate.
A fte r w e had heard the story o f w h at had happened during
the w eek-end w e m ade another exam ination o f the house. It
appeared to be in m uch the sam e state as w hen w e left it on the
previous Friday. W e then returned to the kitchen, and the four
o f us (M rs. W est, M i » Sm ith, the reporter and m yself) stood
chatting in die kitchen, w hen suddenly there w as a sound as i f a
heavy object had fallen behind us, in the kitchen, but near the
do T h e Strange E xp lo its o f a London Poltergeist
passage leading to the scullery, the door o fwhich was shut. T o m e,
A c noise sounded like the fell o f a h eavy boot o r brush and I at
once began to look fo r such an article; so did the Evening N ew s
representative. In a m inute or so I saw som ething dark under a
chair in the com er and putting m y hand on it I found it w as a
pair o f lady’s black shoes. Actually I put m y hand on a hard
object w h ich w as in the right shoe and brought it to light. It
w as a small bronze ornam ent in the fo rm o f a cherub, w eighin g
about four ounces.
T h e cries o f astonishment— real o r simulated— w ith w hich
the ladies greeted m y ‘find’ w ere renewed w hen it w as dis­
covered that the ornam ent w as m issing fro m the mantelpiece o f
the front sitting-room w here, I w as inform ed, it had reposed
(together w ith its fellow -cherub) fo r tw en ty-five yea n . W e
w ere assured that these cherubim had never been rem oved from
the front room . I continued m y search o f the kitchen, but could
discover nothing else w h ich could have fallen.
W e searched the house once m ore but satisfied ourselves that
w e w ere the only occupants. T h e reporter and I arranged to
spend the next night in the house. T h e fo llo w in g day I w as in­
form ed that the B u ry R o a d house had been shut up, so that I
gave up the idea o f staying all night. T h e strange occurrences
w ere driving A c fam ily to distraction. W i A b o A o f its m ale
m em bers a w ay, one daughter ill, and the little b o y dispatched
to A c country, the tw o rem aining sisters determ ined to quit the
house o f evil associations. T h e crow ds, too, w ere frightening
them . D urin g the w eek-end, m ounted police w ere necessary in
order to keep back the gaping m o b w h ich all day and night
stood in the road and gazed open-m outhed, at nothing m ore
thrilling than a couple o f broken panes o f glass. A s I w as leaving

D urin g die early part o f the w eek M iss Sm ith and her sister
derided to return to the house. O n the T uesday the editor o f the
D a ily Express asked m e i f I w o u ld m ake the experim ent o f
taking a m edium to the house in order to see i f she could get
an y ‘im pressions'. I consented. T h e psychic w as a M iss X , the
daughter o f a w ell-k n o w n London professional m an and, o f
course, an amateur.
T h e D a ily Express representative w as M r. F. G . H . Salusbury,
w h o m I knew . W e visited B u ry R o a d on W edn esday after­
noon, Janu ary 2 5 , 19 2 8 , arriving at the house about three
o ’clock. M rs. W e st w as there— the only m em ber o f the Sm ith
fam ily w h o entered the place that afternoon.
W e took M iss X to every room in the house in order to dis­
cover i f she received an y ‘im pression. She at once declared that
the place m ade her feel ‘miserable’ . T h is w as n ot particularly
illum inating, as m ost suburban houses have the same effect
upon m e. B u t in the kitchen M iss X declared that she felt
‘chilly’. T here w as a go o d fire burning in the room — in fact,
the kitchen w as the o n ly apartm ent w h ich w as heated. N eith er
M r. Salusbury nor I felt cool m this ro o m ; on the contrary, w e
felt m uch w arm er. B u t M iss X continued to get colder and
p ositively shivered. H er respiration slow ed d o w n and her hands
w ere distinctly cold. W e left her sitting b y the fire w atching
M rs. W e st do her household duties. W e then continued our
search o f the house, carefully closing the kitchen door behind us.
W e again exam ined the upper room s o f the house, inspecting
and exam ining m inutely every article o f furniture, ornaments,
etc., and noting their exact positions. T h e room s on the top
floor o f the B u ry R o a d house are d ivided b y a passage w hich
runs fro m the back to the front o f the building. D urin g our
inspection o f these room s w e m ust have traversed this n a rro w
and w ell-lighted passage at least six or seven times. N eith er o f
us noticed anything on the floor o f the passage. W e w ere in the
front ro o m w h en w e both heard an object fell in som e part o f
6z T h e Strange E x p lo its o f a London Poltergeist
die house. W e im m ediately turned to g o once m ore to the
lo w e r part o f the building and sim ultaneously saw in the pas­
sage, w ith the light fillin g h ill on it, a piece o f com m on yello w
soap such as is used fo r w ashing clothes. It w as lyin g right in
o ur path, about six feet fro m the door o f the ro o m w e had ju st
entered. W e both declared that it w as utterly impossible fo r us
to have passed that soap once w ith o ut seeing it; to have done so
seven times w ith o u t n oticing it o r treading on it w o u ld have
been a m iracle.
W ith o u t touching the soap w e m ade our w a y downstairs to
the kitchen, the door o f w h ich w as still dosed. B o th M rs. W e st
and M iss X declared that neither had m o ved during our tour
o f inspection: the door o f the kitchen had not been opened and
no one could enter the house except b y the front door (which
opened o n ly on the inside) o r through the garden, scullery and
kitchen.
M rs. W e st accom panied us to the top floor again and exam ­
ined the soap, w h ich she said belonged to the scullery. It showed
no signs o f having had a b lo w o r o f felling heavily. M iss X w as
still v e ry cold and shivering, though she had ju st com e from a
w a rm kitchen. W e stayed in the house for another half-hour,
but nothing further happened.
M r. W a lte r Sm ith returned hom e a fe w days after the inci­
dent o f the soap. A s I prophesied, he w as found to be perfectly
norm al, and it w as preposterous that he should have been com ­
pelled to leave his hom e. T h a t w as the end o f the B u ry R o a d
affair, and d ie house w as vacated soon afterwards.
* ★ * ★ *
It is obvious that the occurrences w h ich I have described w ere
either genuine phenom ena o r w ere due to som e m ischievous
person o r persons w ith a v e ry p o w erful m otive fo r disturbing
the peace o f the locality.
M y o w n first impression w as that the ex-soldiers at the
m ental hom e had discovered that die B u r y R o a d house w as an
C

excellent target fo r their missiles. T h e angle at w h ich portions
o f die house w ere struck originated this theory in m y m ind.
T here had also been ‘friction’ betw een the Sm iths and the in­
mates o f the m ental hom e. B u t n o n orm al external force could
have smashed the crockery and broken the furniture inside the
house. I w as then faced w ith the alternative o f suspecting the
Sm ith fam ily o f deliberately destroying die hom e w h ich had
sheltered them fo r tw en ty-five y e a n , o r attributing die pheno­
m ena to a supernorm al origin.
I at once acquitted the b o y, C y ril, o fh a vin g an y gu ilty k n o w ­
ledge o f the disturbances, assuming they w ere caused norm ally,
hi the first place, he w as absent w h en m any o f the phenom ena
occurred; secondly, he had not the physical strength to inflict
the dam age w h ich som e o f the furniture sustained. A n d w ith a
house full o f people any suspicious action on his part w o u ld
have been noticed instandy. A n d on the one occasion w hen I
saw him , he looked thoroughly scared. T h o u g h phenom ena o f
the so-called Poltergeist type are often associated (as w ith
Eleonore Zu g u n 1 ) w ith adolescents, I w as convinced that in the
case under review there w as no connection between the b o y
and the manifestations.
It has been suggested that the disturbances w ere deliberately
planned b y som e o f the m em bers o f the B u ry R o a d fam ily in
order to frighten Sm ith père out o f the house— fo r w h at reason
is n ot stated. B u t that theory w ill n ot bear analysis. T h o u g h the
m ost violent o f the alleged phenom ena occurred w hen M r.
Sm ith, senior, w as in residence, die manifestations w ere after­
w ards so num erous and disturbing that, as w e have seen, M r.
Sm ith, ju nio r, w as suspected o f originating them and w as sub­
jected to considerable annoyance and personal discom fort after
his father had left the house. A n d no fam ily w o u ld deliberately
smash up their hom e fo r the purpose o f driving out one o f their
1See Leavesfrom a Psydiists Case-Book, by Harry Price, London, 1933,
pp.227-72.
6 4 T h e Strange E x p lo its o f a London Poltergeist
num ber, especially w hen that m em ber is die head o f die fam ily
and the responsible tenant. A n d it w as after M r. Sm ith senior’s
departure that the rem ainder o f the fam ily w ere subjected to
die distracting attention o f the public, police and Press.
T h e incidents o f the gas-lighter, die cherub and the soap still
puzzle m e. O n die three occasions w h en these objects w ere pre­
cipitated near m e, I could never be quite certain that a norm al
explanation could not be found fo r the supposed phenom ena.
It m ust be adm itted that the case presents som e v e ry unusual
features. T h e rem oval o f the tw o m em bers o f the household,
together w ith the suggestion that the early disturbances w ere
caused b y the inmates o f the sam torium at the rear o f the house,
m arks the B u r y R o a d m ystery as being decidedly out o f die
ordinary run o f such cases. I feel convinced that the original
trouble w as caused b y som e o f the soldiers w h o w ere receiving
treatm ent at the private m ental hom e. T h at the w o rry and
an xiety caused b y these disturbances reacted on som e o f the
Sm ith fam ily seems alm ost certain. W h eth er this reaction w as a
norm al o r extra-norm al one is, in the absence o f further evi­
dence, a matter fo r speculation. B u t I consider that the evidence
fo r the abnorm ality o f som e o f the occurrences is rather stronger
than that fo r the theory that the Sm ith fam ily w as responsible
fo r all the trouble. A n d there, I am afraid, w e m ust leave it.
V. 'Grand Hotel* and Other Mysteries
S
om e o f the most curious adventures w hich have filien to
m y lot have been, so to speak, thrust upon me. In parti­
cular, the ‘ghost o f the Unter den Linden’ (as I call it) w as de­
cidedly not o f m y seeking and proved to be die m ost un­
pleasant incident o f a psychic (if really psychic) nature I have
ever experienced.
A year or so after the W ar I decided to visit some o f the
larger German cines in order to hunt for b o o b on magic.
O w ing to the very favourable V
a
lu
ta(the m ark was tum bling
every day) I thought I could acquire them cheaply, and I was
not mistaken. I visited Leipzig, Dresden, Hanover, Cologne
and Berlin and picked up nearly tw o hundred w o r b on m agic
for less than a pound sterling.
I arrived in Berlin on a M onday afternoon in September,
and took a taxi to that hotel in the Unter den Linden made
fam ous b y V id ri Baum in her G
ra
n
dH
otel.Those w h o have
read this diverting story w ill be able to visualise the sort o f
place ‘Grand H otel’ is, and the type o f client it attracts. I need
only rem ark that it is— or was— the most fashionable hotel in
Berlin, and probably the largest. It was m y first visit: norm ally,
the hotel is too expensive for me and I usually stay at die H otel
Central, opposite the Friedrichstrasse Station, as it is m ore con­
venient for the railw ay and shops. B u t I was tempted to stay at
‘ Grand H otel’ on this particular visit owing, as I have re­
marked, to the fact that the rate o f exchange was so much in
m y favour.
A fter a wash and the filling up o finnumerable police form s, I
thought I w ould stroll as far as the C afé Bauer at the com er o f

VI. The Talking Mongoose
I
have been asked to do some queer things during m y thirty
years' investigation o f the alleged supernormal. For example,
when lecturing in Paris, I was invited to take up m y perch on
top o f the Eiffel T ow er and investigate a ‘haunted’ kiosk,
where ivories, cheap jew ellery, and similar souvenirs am p ly
vanished into thin air’, and it was thought that the thief must
be a psychic one. A gain, a poor wom an came to see me one day
and stated that for three consecutive nights she had dreamt that
a near relative, recendy buried, w as not dead, but m a trance.
Could I procure for her an exhumation order and make some
tests? Then there w as the man w ho had secured a quantity o f
peyott1(a plant from which an hallucinating drug is made) and
suggested that, i f I consumed enough o f it, I could ‘project m y
astral’ and record m y experience. Curious as these requests m ay
appear, they are com monplace compared w ith one I received in
the w inter o f 19 32 from a lady in the Isle o f M an. M y corre­
spondent inform ed m e that a farm er friend o f hers, a M r.
Jam es T . Irving, had discovered in his house an animal which,
after a little coaxing, had developed the pow er o f speech, and
was practically human, except in form . W ould I care to inter­
view the little beast? I replied that further data w ould be desir­
able before I decided to investigate the M anx prodigy. I w rote
to the farm er.
I found M r. Irving very helpful, and he confirmed all his
friend had told me. In a letter he described the animal as being
o f a yellow ish tinge, like a ferret. ‘The tail is long and bushy
and tinged w ith brown. In size, it is about the length o f a three-

We have been told th
at we discoverednothing during our
Confessions ofa Ghost-Hunter 97
quest of die ‘talking mongoose’. But that is not true: we dis­
covered why witches were hanged in the seventeenth century,
and why Lord ChiefJustice Hale publicly avowed his beliefin
broomsticks asareasonable and usual meansoflocomotion.
Gef returned to the farm on the same evening as we left it
—perhaps we passed him on our way down the mountain! He
told Mr. Irving that, although he had ‘had afew days' holiday’,
he was present at the house during our visit, and heard all we
said. He gave various excuses for not showing himself and one
o f them was that Mr. Lambert was a ‘doubter’. He admitted
knocking over the saucepan ofwater in the living-room. After
our return home this clever mongoose made impressions ofhis
paws and teeth in plasticine, and Mr. Irving sent them to me.
He (Gef) also dictated to the firmer a complete description of
himself and from these particulars a drawing was made and
published.1 Our adventures created extraordinary interest in
London and the B.B.C. asked me to broadcast the story.1 As
these Confessions go to press, Gefis still exchanging wisecracks
with Irvmg; still dancing to the gramophone on top of his
‘sanctum’; soil screwing rabbits’ necks for the Irving table; and,
I am afraid, still impressing a number of rather credulous
people.

Haunting ofCashen's Cap: a Modem 'Miracle Investigated, by Harry Pnce

VII. Some Curious Claims to Mediumship
Anyone can be a ‘medium’; whereas, if you keep a dog, run
i l l fried-fish stall, or drive a motor-car, you must have a
license. But you can practise ‘mediumship’ with impunity.
The law does not ‘inspect’ you; you are not required to fill up
forms or sign on dotted lines, or even include the amount of
your ‘spoils’ in your Income Tax return—because professional
mediumship is illegal. You can gaze into a crystal, call up
‘spirits’, produce voices from a tin trumpet, go into a trance,
‘psychometrise’, materialise ‘ectoplasm’, see visions, take spirit
photographs, or read the stars—andyou are absolutelyimmune
from every kind of tax or official supervision. The reason for
this is that the law does not recognise such a thing as medium-
ship. The psychicnot only hasno legal status, but his profession
is actually illegal under the old laws, which have never been
repealed. Legally, he is a ‘rogue and a vagabond’ and is some­
timesprosecuted assuch.
Though I have stated that a medium is immune from official
supervision, he canvery easily become entangled in the meshes
of the law. He definitely breaks die law if, for a consideration,
hepredictsthefuture:he isprosecutedunder theWitchcraft and
Vagrancy Acts1 and can be fined or imprisoned. One fre-
quendy reads in the Press ofsuch prosecutions, and usually the
offenders are convicted either for pretending to tell fortunes or
for obtaining money under false pretences. The difference be­
tween a certain type of medium and a ‘fortune-teller’ is so
subtle that the burly policeman and his wife (disguised as
‘sitters’), when they visit the psychic’s parlour, can hardly be

die ’Flower Medium’— at a cocktail party ! I was not permitted to take any
part m the control (or fore-control) o f die medium, who, before about
thirty people, and in full light, produced five common thornless roses, w ith
stems cut with a knife, from under her coat Later m die evening I had a
private séance with her (in the dark) for ’psychic lights’ (not produced)
which turned to ‘apports’ m the shape o f a handful o f shingle found under a
cushion. As she had been in the room for two hours previous to m y sitting,

have been ‘supemormaUy’ introduced into the séance-zoom
(spiritualist literature is full of such cases), your next sitting
must be held in a room absolutely devoid of anything in die
way offurniture except the few wooden chairs on which the
circle sits. All hangings, carpets and ornaments must be re­
moved, and chimney stopped up. Keyhole must be plugged,
windows sealed, anddoor locked andbolted from the outside.
Everypersontakingpartintheséance mustremovehisclothes,
which should be searched and examined by two persons
(strangers to all present) who are not taking part in the pro­
ceedings. When a sitter has been searched, he is permitted to
dress, under supervision, and is taken to the séance-zoom and
thekeyturnedonhim. When allhavebeenexaminedandhave
donned heir clothes, the medium (having been previously
examined by the doctors) should be led into the séance-zoom
andthedoorfinally lockedandbolted. No onewho tookpart
in the examination ofsitters or medium shouldbe allowed m
theséance-zoom . Ifthisfore-control wasrigidlyimposedonall
who tookpartin die sitting, and ‘apports’ werestillproduced,
I should much like to have particulars of the séance. Though
collusioncouldstill accountfor thephenomena, thechances of
fraud were much lessened, and there is aprim a facie case for
furtherscientificinvestigation.
‘Materialising mediums’ are few andfar between; but there
arestill afew ‘working’, though the evidence for ‘materialisa­
tions’ ispoor. Any mediumproducing ‘full-forms’ or ‘pseudo­
pods* should be subjected to a rigid fore-control, previous to
the tactual, electrical, or gauze cage controlling system em­
ployedatthesittingitself. A goodsubstituteforthegauzecage
is a gauze bag, into which the medium is sewn. But thejob
must be done thoroughly. If materialisations are produced
underyourownconditionsandwhilediemediumisinthebag,
thereisevidencethatfurtherexperimentsareworthwhile.

psychical researchwere those producedthrough the medium-
ship of Miss Home Cook in die presence of Sir William
Crookes. During the years 1873-4 Sir William held many
séances with Miss Cook, thenagedeighteen, andannouncedto
hisscientificbrethrenthathehadobtained absoluteproofs of
spiritmaterialisation. Thespiritwas ‘KatieKing’, thedaughter
of‘JohnKing*, allegedtohavebeenapirate. Katiematerialised
in SirWilliam’sstudyon many occasions andin oneweekno
fewerthanforty-fourphotographs ofthespiritwereobtained,
withtheelectriclightasanilluminant. Hvecameraswereused,
and the materialised form was photographed from different
angles.Manytimesbothmediumandspiritwereseentogether,
‘underthefullblazeoftheelectriclight*, andtheywerephoto­
graphedtogetherononeoccasion.SirWilliamalsoembracedthe
spintonMarch29,1874: ‘Onseveraloccasionsshe[Katie] took
my arm when walking, and the impression conveyed to my
mindthatitwasalivingwomanbymyside,insteadofavisitor
fromtheotherworld, wassostrongthat... Iaskedherpermis­
sion to clasp her in my arms. . . . Permission was graciously
given,andIaccordinglydid—well, a
sanygentlemanwoulddo
underthecircumstances.’*Both ‘Katie’ andHomeCook were
good-looking girls. Copies of Sir William’s photographs are
extant, but the negatives have disappeared. Sir William’s ex­
perimentswithHome Cook areoneofthemajormysteriesof
psychicalresearch.IamafraidthatImustinformthereaderthat
at aséance onJanuary 9,1880, Home Cook was seizedby Sir
GeorgeSitwell, andwasfoundtobedressedonlyinherunder­
clothes, masquerading a

not necessarily prove that Home cheatedduring the Crookes
experiments.
It is a bold medium who produces materialisations to-day,
and this particular phase of mediumship has always attracted

nor do I think that materialisation is by any means tbe best
form of manifestation. It is the one most open to imposture,
and my experience is that materialising spirits never say any­
thing worth listening to. You had betterexperimentwith the

In addition to the rigid fore-control, and séance control, the
medium’s mouth, teeth, etc., should be specially examined.
Tiny bits of ferro-cerium (the ‘flint’ you put in your pocket

Telekinetic phenomena are imitated fraudulently by means
of simple pieces of apparatus such as wires, thin rods, horse­
hairs, telescopic reaching-rods, the hands, feet—andconfeder­

apparatus being introduced into the stance-room, and confed­
eracy can be made difficult by excluding the medium’s
friends and having fresh sitters at each experiment. There is
fairlygoodevidencefortelekineticphenomena.3
‘Raps’ are difficult to locate, and still more difficult to

Remember that it is what a trumpet medium says, and not

at a trumpet séance, my remarks upon going to a clairvoyante

medium whom I did not consider an utter fraud. The last

Hauntedhouses, phantasmsand Poltergeists should be inves­
tigated scientifically. Before you visit the scene of an alleged
haunt, obtain the fullest evidence from as many persons a
s
possible as to what has been seen or heard at the house. On
theirreportsyoucandecidewhethertheplaceisworthinvesti­
gating. If you decide to inquire into the case, take someone
with you, and make further inquiries on the spot. Ifyou still
think it worth while to continue, ascertain exactly what the
phenomena are, where and when seen (especially the exact
days and times), and make your plans accordingly. If the
phenomena occur inside the building, assemble all inmates in
one room under the guard of your assistant, thoroughly ex­
plore thehouse,andmakeaplanof it. Sealalldoors,windows
andotheropeningsinthewayIhavesuggestedmmyaccount

the manifestations occur only in the dark, you will have to
invent some sort ofelectric or mechanical control in order to
ascertain whether supernormal happenings take place. For
example,ifitisallegedthat‘doorsopenbythemselves’ (acom­

which will immediately inform you if the door has been

There have been several modem spirit photographers. The

called‘CreweCircle’ ofphotographicmediums.In19221 hada
sitting with him, and caught him changing the dark-slide
containing my plates which had been specially marked for
me by the Imperial Dry Plate Co., Ltd. The markings, a
lion rampant, were—at my suggestion—X-rayed on to each
plate.2 Arthur Conan Doyle and his friends abused me for
years for exposing Hope—who was again thoroughly un­
masked2 by Mr. Fred Barlow and Major Rampling-Rose in
1932,theyearbeforehe (Hope) died.

Having failed to get a sitting with Mrs. Deane, I tried the
Falconer brothers, two young Scots who found they were
getting ‘extras’ on theirplates. Icertainlysawthebrothers, but
they informed me, immediately I entered the room, that the
‘power had suddenly left them’. This was on the day before
they sailed for South Africa on a ‘professional’ tour. The
Johannesburg police became suspicious, raided the boys’ flat,
found ‘spirit pictures’ in various stages of manufacture, and
prosecuted them. They were convicted (1931) of producing
fraudulent spirit photographs. Each brother was fined ^150
andcosts.Theyappealed,andlost.1
The last spirit photographer I tried to sit with was John
Myers. We met, but he refused to give me a séance. I offered
him 3^25 per hour, one hour’s work per week, for twelve
months, ifhe would produce aspiritpicturein my laboratory

Britishspiritualiststouse.
There have been other exposures of spirit photographers,
including William M. Keeler, the American, who was the
subject of a long and scathing report by the late Dr. Walter
FranklinPrince.1
This chapter is not intended as ahistory of psychic photo­
graphers, butto give thepublicsomeideaasto how the fakers
getthe ‘extras’ on to the plates. Unless aperson possesses the

matteroffact,thereisno goodevidencethataspiritphotograph
haseverbeenproduced. Having now introducedthereaderto
most of the‘famous’ photographicmediums, pastandpresent,
I will describe themethods by which ‘spirits’ canbe addedto
thesensitisedplate—whether it is supplied by thesitteror the
medium.
The easiest way of fraudulently producing a ‘spirit extra’
uponthesensitisedemulsionofaphotographicplateorfilm is,
undoubtedly, by the method known as ‘double exposure’.
Besides being theleastdifficult to produce, it is also theeasiest
of detection, as it is not very practicable to introduce the
‘extra’ mto the photograph without the knowledge of the
sitter—shouldhe be using his own plates—unless the operator
usesspecialdevices,whichwillbediscussedlater.
A psychic‘extra’ producedby the doubleexposure method,
ifit is to be atall convincing, presupposes theemployment of
eitherawaxlayfigure (suchasbarbers use) orahumanbeing
as the ghostly assistant; unless the photographer makes use of
the old family album, half-tone picture, or an existing photo­
graphofthepersonwhose ‘extra’ isbeingsoughtby thesitter.
Moss made most of his fakes by merely copying an existing
photographorpicture;butothermenuseothermethods.When
a sitter is bona-fide and serious, and brings his own plates, a
certain degree of ingenuity is required in order to make the
experimentconvincing.
The production of a psychic photograph made by the
double exposure method is simplicity itself, and well within
the skill of the veriest tyro who ever pressedthe button on a
Kodak.
The operator first arranges his scene or background (if the
platesaretobe‘switched’ forthoseofthesitter’s,ablackvelvet
backgroundisemployed), andthesitterwhoistoimpersonate
die‘extra’ takestheplaceallottedtohim.A veryshortexposure
is now given. If the picture is being taken merely for amuse-
C onfessions o f a G h o st-H u nter 173
ment, aproperbackgroundor sceneisemployed,anddie per­
son or object intended to represent the ‘ghost’ is placed in a
suitable position near the sitter: the camera is uncapped for a
fractionofasecondandre-capped.The ‘ghost’ thenmovesout
of the picture and, without the sitter moving in the slightest
degree, anormal exposureis given. The assistantwho person­
atesthe‘ghost’ shouldbedrapedmwhite, asashorterexposure

the ‘spirit’, andapicturewithbettercontrastwillbetheresult.
Thatisthefull-formghost.

san‘extra’, thehvehelper (orlay
figure) shouldpoke his headthrough ahole in a blackvelvet
sheet. If the face is whitened, and a roll ofcotton wool (ora
fewyardsof muslin) isdrapedaroundthehead, an ‘extra’, in­
distinguishable from the orthodox ‘spirit’ pictures extant, will
betheresult.
As regards the ratio of exposures, I find that if the normal
picture requires five seconds, the ‘ghost’ should be given one
second. Theseexposures shouldgive good detailin the ‘extra’,
while allowing every part of the background to showplainly
through the ghostly visitant. A fairly small stop should be
employed (one notlarger thanf.16or f.22), m order that the
various planes of the background of the picture should be
equally sharp and distinct—an important point when the
artistic appearance of the picture is to be considered. A fist
plate, backed for preference (to prevent halation), should be
used m conjunction with a slow developer. I find paramido-
phenol (a proprietary brand is sold, ready for use, under the
name of ‘Rodinal’) an excellent reagent for the development
of all ‘spirit’ pictures. Slow in action, easy in manipulation,
clean and non-staining, and with good keeping qualities, it
producesnegativesoffinequalitywithperfectgradation. Other
developers derived from coal-tar are also good. Although I

The results obtained by double exposure can be duplicated
by double or combination printing, or ‘printing in’. The sim­
plestform ofmultiple printing is the production ofacompo­
sitephotographfromtwoormorenegatives.Forinstance,with
a littlejudicious blocking out, Eros could be ‘apported’ from
Piccadilly Circus and temporarily deposited in die centre of
Kensington Gardens, or the Houses of Parliament might be
madeto appearenjoyingawell-earnedhohdayonthesandsat
Blackpool. Any intelligent amateur photographer could pro­
ducetheseresultswithlitdetrouble.
To portray a ‘spiritextra’ by thedouble-printing methodis
easierstill as, ofcourse, we want the background—if any—to
show through the ‘extra’, which is popularly supposed to be
transparent To produce a ghosdy picture m this way it is
necessaryto photograph the personor model representing the
‘extra’ in front of a dead-black background. The resultant
negative, whichshouldbe ratherunder-exposed, shouldshow
the figure surrounded by almost clear glass. It is best to use
films for this particular class of spurious ‘spirit’ photograph,
otherwisethethicknessoftheglasswillgiveafrizzyappearance
to the superimposed image. Sometimes, when the dishonest
mediumwishes his ‘extras’ to be ‘recognised’, he makes them
fuzzy on purpose. The negative on which is the setting for
your‘spirit’ isplacedintheprinting-frameintheusualmanner,
andnexttoitisplacedtheplateorfilmcontainingyour‘extra’.
The two negatives are then printed, asone, m the usual way.
The finished printwill show your ‘extra’, throughwhich die
addedbackgroundwill beplainlyvisible. Ineedhardlyinform

tion to the unskilled ‘medium’, who provides himself with a
collection of plates already bearing the latent images of an

It isjust as easy, of course, to reproduce drawings, photo­

You place them upon a dead-black background, and photo­

What is true of the half-tone process picture applies in a
lesserdegreetotheordinaryphotographicprint, asthepaperor
card upon which the negative has been printed has a grain—
more or less apparent—which is apt to be exaggerated in the
copying process as used by the dishonest medium unless the
lighting of the picture has been carefully considered and
arranged. If the paper upon which the photograph has been
printedhasanappreciable grain, andasidelighthasbeenused

ated as each tiny hillock comprising die surface of the paper
will be lighted upon one side only: the side away from the
source of illumination will be in shadow. The photographic
copy will appear to have a much coarser texture than the
original, as the grain has been exaggerated by the uneven
lighting. The sun’sillumination ofthe moon serves as a good
example of what I mean. Full and new moon occur respec­
tivelywhenthesunandmoon arealignedoppositely. Thefull
moonthenappears‘flat’ whenviewedthroughatelescope, asit
receives a front light. At quadratures the moon appears half-
illuminated or ‘dichotomised’. It is then that the mountain
ranges and craters (such a
s the Lunar Apennines) cast long
shadows and are m brilliant contrast, owing to the more
obliqueincidenceoflight.
It is apparent, then, that to avoid an unpleasant surface,

where there has been direct evidence of die use of the air­
brushandIndiaink, andtheresult hasbeentoo beautiful to be

ludicrousandinartisticatthesametime, thoughsomesittersdo

Another inconsistency often found in stereoscopic photo­
graphs of materialisations is for the alleged spirit forms to be
absolutely flat, whilst the medium or sitters and the accom­
panying m ise-en-scbie are three-dimensional and stand out in
bold relief. Sometimes die drapery of die ‘spirit’ will exhibit

One afternoon inJanuary 1921 I was waiting for a train at
Paddington Station and I got into conversation with a man
who was neither more nor less than a spirit photographer’s
mechanic. He didnotknowIwasinterestedinpsychicmatters
andbecamevery confidential. During our talkhe showed me
the most perfect piece of apparatus for adding an extra’ to a
negative thatIhaveeverseen. Itwasmadeofivory, andsmall
enough to be palmed m the hand. He called it the ‘Ghost
Stamp’, hi the lower part could be placed a tiny positive, the
upper portion containing an electric pea-lamp and immature
battery. The lightest contact with the sensitised surface—or
back—of a plate printed a perfect vignetted ‘extra’ on the

Mr. MacCarthy demonstrated his apparatus at a lecture he
gave in London on June 26, 1935. During the meedng, he
offeredto undergo astringenttest, andI willnow quotefrom
the report of the lecture which appeared in L igh t forJuly 4,
1935:
‘Mr. MacCarthy offeredto produce “extras” under any test
conditions which aspecial committeecaredto impose, andhis
challenge was accepted. Conditions were imposed which
appeared to make faking impossible. These included the pur­
chaseby thecommittee ofthephotographicplates, whichMr.
MacCarthywasnot allowed to touch during thewholeofthe
proceedings; theuseofacameraandslideobtaineddirectfrom
a dealer’s stock and operated by aprofessional photographer;
searching before the sitting for concealed apparatus; and, a
s a
final precaution, thatMr. MacCarthymustsubmitto behand­
cuffedduringtheproceedings.
‘All theseconditions Mr. MacCarthy accepted; andyet five
“extras” were produced, and the faces on three ofthem were
“recognised” bythesitters.
‘Explaining the means by which this apparendy impossible
result was achieved, Mr. MacCarthy said they were partly
psychological andpartlyscientific. To beginwith, hesearched
foroldphotographsbearingsomeresemblancetocertainmem­
bers of the committee. Two ofthese—Mrs. W. E. Gladstone
and Mr. Ben Tillet—were duly “recognised” when they ap­
pearedas “extras”, asthe motherandrelative, respectively, of
two of the sitters. Another photograph used was that of a
soldier friend of his (Mr. MacCarthy’s) father, whom—by
adroitsuggestion—heinducedhisfathertoaskfor.

careful preparation and much practice in getting diem in the
desired positions. The basis of his plan was the use of ultra­
violet rays, invisible to die human eye. After choosing die

them, leaving the question of the utilisation of radio-active
substancesuntillater.
One ofthevery easiest—andleastknown—methods ofget­
ting cloud-like forms or peculiar markings upon a photo­
graphic plate is to use an unevenly mixed developer. The
reader can easily try the following experiment: take a heavy,
concentrated, one-solution developersucha
sRodinal orAzol,
to mention only two of several brands on the market. Pour
about one hundred minims of the reagent mto a four-ounce
graduatedmeasure. Addgradually fourouncesofwater, letting
it gently trickle down the inside ofthe glass. It will be found
that the two liquids—owing to the difference in specific
gravity—will not mix, the heavier chemical remaining at the
bottom of die vessel. If the contents of the measure are now
pouredslowlyovertheexposedsensitisedplate, withoutrock­
ing the dish, it will be found that whereas the image will
slowly develop, cloud-like markings, of greater density, will
make their appearance upon the plate—due to the uneven
action of the developer. These markings, which sometimes
assum
e very curious formations, will of course be plainly
visible in the finished print. An unscrupulous medium will
assert that these marks are due to spirit agency, and will en­
deavour to point out their resemblance to human faces or in­
animateobjects. With alittle imagination youwill fancy you
see ‘something’ andgo away more or less impressed. It isnot
possible to produce a portrait by this method (unless by acci­
dent),though theseshadowyforms canbemanufacturedright
under thenoses oftheinvestigators. When no question ofin­
dividualidentityisinvolved, butmerelythatofrecognitionof
an attempt at die human face, any three random marks that
are not too far apart or too divergent in size will, of course,
gain such recognition; the more so if one talks about ‘first
attempts’, ‘theearlystages of materialisation’, etc. Thatiswhy
one sees ‘faces’ in the pattern ofthe carpet, in a figured wall-
C onfessions o f a G h ost-H u nter 185
paper, in photographs of trees or foliage, or amongst the
cinders of a glowing coal fire. With the unevenly mixed
developer method, the ‘psychic’ can utilise his client’s own
marked plates and apparatus and even his own dark-room—
providedthemixing ofthedeveloperisleft to themedium, a
s
is often thecase. In asimilarway, by the useofacamel’shair
orsablebrushdippedintheconcentrateddeveloper, formscan
be paintedupon thesensitisedemulsion that areindistinguish­
ablefromsomeoftheallegedpsychic extras’ palmedoffonthe
uninitiated. The mere fact ofnot rocking the dish during the
process ofdevelopment ofaplate will produce curious mark­
ings dueto theunevenactionofthereagent. Similarmarkings
canbeproducedbyunevenfixing.
Anotherandstillmore subtlewayofproducingweirdforms
upon thesensitisedplate under strict ‘test’ conditions isfor the
dishonest medium surreptitiously to drop a small crystal (not
much larger than apin’shead) ofsodiumthiosulphate (hypo­
sulphiteof soda, or ‘hypo’) upon the plate duringthe process
ofdevelopment. Thecrystalslowlydissolves,forminganirreg­
ularcircularpatchofvaryingintensity, removing byits action
thesilversaltsintheemulsionwhichhavenotbeen affectedby
the light. The investigator’s own plates can be used, and the
finished print will show the markings. Sulphocyanide of
ammonium,sulphiteofsoda,cyanideofpotassium,andsulpho­
cyanide of potassium can be usedin place ofthe ‘hypo’. The
cyanide ofpotassiumis particularly active asasolvent, andits
effectinagiventimeiscorrespondinglygreater.
Still another way of producing ‘extras’ upon the sensitised
surfaceofaphotographicplateisby meansoftheglowingend
of a lighted cigarette. It is quite possible for the fraudulent
photographerto producesomesemblancetoaheadandshoul­
ders by the cigarette process, for the light emanations can be
directed as surely as the artist’s brush or Mr. MacCarthy’s
ultra-violet ray projector. Obviously, this method is not pos-

siblc if die investigator is standing over die medium, but die

Ihaveshownhow simpleitisby meansofacrystalofhypo­
sulphiteofsodatoproduce ‘spirit’ formationsuponasensitised
plate.Itiseveneasiertoproducesimilarmarkingsbydippinga
finger into the ‘hypo’ and, with a circular motion, rubbing it
upon theemulsion. Finger-marks showvery plainlyupon the
gelatine surfaceofphotographicplates. Even aperfectly dean
finger rubbed upon the plate pnor to its immersion m die
developer will, owing to the natural greasiness of the skin,
produce markingsmthefinishednegative. Iheardofone man
who specialised in producing abnormal markings (which he
said were caused by ‘human radiations’) m his clients’ own
dark-rooms. These he produced by the simple expedient of
runninghisfingers throughhisgreasyhair and, unseenby the
observers, rubbing them upon the sensitised surface of the
plates. This astutegentleman used to vary theprocess by con­
cealing chemicals m his hair and using them as circumstances
dictated.
Itisquitepossibleto getmarkingsuponunexposedplatesby
wrappingthemupforaweekorso (timedependsupontheage
ofthejournal used) inanillustratednewspaperorjournal Try
the experiment ofwrapping up afairly fast plate in a page of
illustrations culled from The Listener, and putting it by for a
fewweeks. You willfind, upondevelopment, afaithfulrepro­
ductionofthepictureorprintwithwhichthesensitisedsurface
was in contact. This curious fact is due to three causes, v iz .
(1) thedeteriorationof thesensitised emulsion, whichis more
rapidwhere the blank (unprinted) paperwas touching, owing
to the preservative qualities of the grease in the printing ink;
(2) certainchemical actions setup by the printing ink; (3) the
absorption by the gelatine of a certain amount of moisture
fromthatportionofdiepaperwhichisnotprintedon. Where
die plate hasabsorbed any ofthe greasein the printing ink, it
C onfessions o f a G h o st-H u nter 187
will be found that this has the effect ofdelaying the action of
thedeveloperoverthoseportionsoftheplatewhichhavebeen
in contact with the ink. It would be possible to produce a
‘spirit’ pictureinthisway—usingyourownplates,ofcourse,or
‘substituting’.
Another andextremely subtlemethod of producing recog­
nisable portraits upon the investigator’s own marked plates,
whilstheisactuallystandingoveryouinhisowndark-room,is
known as the ‘backed plate’ method, and the trick was ex­
plained to me by the ‘Ghost Stamp’ gentleman. The pseudo­
medium first suggests to his dupe that he should use his (the
sitter’s) own marked fast plates, ‘backed for preference, as it
precludes any false images due to halation’. He then photo­
graphshissitterwithhis (theinvestigator’s) owncamera, inhis
ownstudio.Theythengoto theinvestigator’sowndark-room,
and the owner stands over him whilst he develops the plate.
(Asamatteroffart, acleveroperatorcouldlettheinvestigator
developtheplateandstillgethis‘extra’ on.) Havingdeveloped
theplate, the ‘medium’ (orinvestigator) fixes it, and, takingit
to thelight, thevictimisastoundedtofindan‘extra’, withfair
detailandnotsoclearandsharpastoappearsuspicious,looking
overhisleftshoulder.
Thesecretofthis ‘miracle’ isa
ssubtleasit issimple, provid­
ing die ‘medium’ can do a verylitde sleight of hand. Hefirst
of all obtains a small film positive, about three-quarters ofan
inchin diameter. He thentakesthephotographofthe sitterin
the ordinary way—care being taken to leave room for the
‘extra’ on one sideofthe sitter’shead. Now, it is well known
thatmostofthe ‘backing’ usedonphotographicplatesismade
ofpowderedburnt sienna, gum arabic, glycerine andwater—
which is easily soluble in the developer, which it discolours.
The fakerthentakes dieplate (ortheinvestigatorcando this)
andputsitin thedeveloperfor afewmoments. Hethentakes
it out again and, under the pretence ofseeing if the image is

appearing, holds it up to die dark-room lamp—a perfectly
naturalproceeding. By this means the 'medium* isenabled to
seediepositionofthesitterontheplate. Noting this, withthe
middle finger of the left hand he surreptitiously rubs away a
portionofthebackingatthespotwherehewantshis‘extra’ to
appear, making acircle ratherlessin diameter thanthatofhis
litdepositivefilm. He returnstheplateto the dish, and, secur­
ing hisfilm positive, retains it unseen between thefingers of
his lefthand. He againhas alook at the plate to ‘seehow it is
gettingon’, andshpshislittlefilmonthebackoftheplateatthe
spothe haspreparedfor it. Itwill be quite unnoticed andwill
remainm position by suction till it is removed. Now for the
perfectsubtlety.
It isnot generallyknown thatnot one dark-roomlampin a
hundredis‘safe’. Takeafastplate (oneofaspeedofabout 1000
to 1500 H. & D.), place three corns upon it andexpose it for
two or three minutes to the light of an ordinary dark-room
lamp. Upondevelopment, theplaceswherethecoinswerewill
be quite white and clear, but the surrounding portions of the
negative will develop up black, showing that the redlighthas
fogged it. Hold up a small spectroscope to the red light, and
youwillfindthatawidebandofthespectrum, embracingper­
haps some of the blue-violet, blue, yellow and orange lines,
will be visible. A perfectly ‘safe’ light will show only a very
narrowbandin theredendofthespectrum. Intheactofcon­
stantly holding up the plate to the dark-room lamp to ‘view
progress’, the‘red’ light (whichIhaveshownisnotwhollyred)
isprinting (i.e. fogging) thefaker’s‘extra’ upontheportionof
die plate assignedto it. The durationofthe exposure required
to do thisisgovernedby the speedoftheplate, the densityof
the‘extra’, andthequality (i.e. theamountoflight, otherthan
red, thatthelamppasses) ofthedark-roomlamp. Thebacking
prevents the remainder ofthe plate from being fogged, at the

exposurebeforean‘extra*couldbeprintedoninthewayIhave
explained. Some ‘spirit’ photographers request their sitters to
bring fastplates, andfrequentlyaskthemto purchaseplates of
aparticularbrand. Theycanthereforesetupacertainstandard
to workby, andmake theircalculations accordingly, reducing
theriskoffailuretoaminimum.
Although it is customary for the ‘spirit’ photographer to
allow hissitter to develop (or watch the development of) the
exposed plates, it sometimes happens that the after-manipula­
tionoftheplatesislefttothemedium,inwhichcasetheoppor­
tunities for fraud are unlimited. I cannot understand a serious
investigator allowing die medium to touch the plates in any
way,butIadmitthatinthecaseofalady,whoseknowledgeof
photography is perhaps nil, the temptation to ‘leave it to the
medium’ isnot to be resisted—so I will describe afew further
ways in which an alleged psychic ‘extra’ can be added to a
genuinely-exposedplate.
We will assume that the investigator has brought his own
marked plates. In the first place, any external marking can be
duplicated upon asubstitutedplate m theprivacy ofthe dark­
room. Signatures can be forged; diamond writings or marks
canbeimitatedwithease; scratchingsuponthefilm sideofthe
plate can be copied, etc., etc. What cannot be duplicated so
easilyare theX-ray identitymarks, which I originated when I
hadmysittingwithWilliam Hope,1andnowextensivelyused.
Whether the plate be marked or not, the fraudulent medium
has many dodges by which he can make an ‘extra’ appear on
anyplatesuppliedtohim.
An easy way of adding an alleged ‘spirit’ photograph to a
plateisby meansofasmallpositive, placedon theglassorfilm
side (accordingtothedegreeof sharpnessdesired) of theplate,
andexposing the positive (only) to awhite light for asecond.
Thismethodissimilartothetrickalreadydescribed,butaccom-
ISeeC old L ighton Spiritualistic ‘Phenom ena, op. cit.

plished under more comfortable conditions. Or, should he
knowthetypeof‘spirit’ hisclientdesires,hecangetanartistto
drawthe portraitofthewantedone on tracing-cloth, tracing-
paper, tissue paper, greaseproofpaper, orpapier-m ineral. This
forms the necessary positive, and is used in the way I have
alreadydescribed. Iaminformedthatoldcinematographfilms
ofcelebrities (ornonentities) arecutupandthesingle pictures
usedtoprint‘extras’ uponsitters’ plates.Thefactthatablurred
pictureof,forinstance,thelateW. E. Gladstoneissuggestedby
the medium a
s a speaking likeness ofhis client’s great grand­
father (who had side-whiskers and a long white beard at die
time of his demise) is not regarded as strangeby the average
‘spirit’ photograph hunter. Tracing-paper or cloth lends itself
admirablyto themanufactureof spurious‘spirit’ photographs.
A clever artist can simulate a photograph with his pencil and
air-brush that defies detection when it is reduced and pro­
jected, suitably blurred or out of focus, by means of a
low-powered microscope and lantern upon a photographic
plate. The fuzzy pictures are frequently ‘recognised’ by too
enthusiastic or over-credulous investigators who are seek­
ing to prove the post-m ortem existence of their friends and
relatives.
Another simpleway ofproducingweirdformsuponaplate
is by the ‘stencil method’. A sketch of the figure required is
drawnthecorrectsizeuponthebottomofaplatebox (usually
made of cardboard) and cut out with a sharp knife, like a
stencil.Thecutedgesarethenserratedinorderthattheshadow
cast upon the plate shall not be too sharply defined. A thin
piece of tissue paper (in order to diffuse the light) is now
pasted over the aperture in the box bottom, and upon the
paper are stuck tiny bits of cardboard to represent the eyes,

the plate, a first-class ‘extra’ will be seen, especially if a little
ingenuityhas beenexpended upon the fashioning ofthe card­
boardstencil,withpapersofvaryingdegreesofopacity.
Another trick, well-known to American ‘psychic’ photo­
graphers, is to paint or draw an ‘extra’ upon the emulsion of
theplate (beforeexposure) with thinopaque yellow pigment.
This isdone previouslym the dark-room and, uponexposure,
theyellow paintobstructs thelightrays falling upon thatpor­
tion of the film so treated, reproducing, when developed, a
faithful replica of the drawing. It is impossible, without close
examination, to discoverthefraudintheredlightofthedark­

triedit personally), istheobjectionablesharpnessofthe‘spirit’
dueto theclear-cutedgesofthedrawing. Thisdefectcould be
overcomeby acleverartist, or the fakercouldpainthis ‘extra’
upon the glass side of the plate and expose this side in the
camera. Whether the film or glass side be worked upon, the
pigment,composedof sugar,water, gumarable,glycerine and
ayellow dye, dissolvesinthe developer. Sometimes apiece of
yellow tissuepaper (cutto therequisite shape) ispastedon the

Another dodge, supposed to have been used by Keeler in

plate.A suitableheadorfigurewouldbecutfromthesheetand

the paper is easier to work on, owing to the superior ‘bite’

the image reflected upon the wall by the polished front face.
There isnothing to be seen upon thishighly-polished silvered
surface, andyet a reflection from it gives an accurate copy of
die image or design cast upon the back. Professor Thompson
says: ‘Here* is one of these beautifulJapanese mirrors, round,
heavy, and furnished with a metal handle. One face has been
polished with care and hard labour; the other has upon it in
relieftheornament castm the mould—in this case thecrestof

Why, in the patch of light reflected from the front of the
mirror, you see1 the pattern that is on the back. This is the
extraordinary“magic” propertythathasmadethesemirrorsso
celebrated. . . . For many years it was supposed that these
mirrors were produced by some trick. But the extraordinary
fact was discovered by Professor Ayrton in Japan that the
Japanesethemselveswereunawareofthemagicpropertyofthe
mirrors. It results, in fact, from an accident in manufacture.
Not allJapanesemirrorsshowtheproperty; thosethatshowit
best are generally thin and with a slight convex face. It was
demonstrated by Professor Ayrton, and I have since accumu­
latedotherproofs, thattheeffect isdueto extremely slightin­
equalities ofcurvature ofsurface. These ariseaccidentlyin the
processofpolishing. The mirrorsarecastmmoulds.To polish
their faces they arelaid down on their backs by the workman
who scrapes them violentlywith abluntiron tool, usinggreat
force. During this process they become slightly convex. The
polishingiscompletedbyscouringwithcharcoalandscrubbing

with the iron tool the mirror bends, but the thin parts yield
more under the pressure than the thick parts do; hence the
thick parts get worn away rather more than the thin parts,
andremainrelativelyconcave,oratleastlessconvex.’
Itisobvious then, from ProfessorThompson’sexperiments,
that it is possible to project an image, the source ofwhich is
quite invisible to the naked eye, by the reflected light from a
brass plate on which is nothing visible. The images thus pro­

I hope the readerhasnow begun to realise thenumber and
diversity of the ways of introducing spurious images into a

ThoughIhavegivenparticularsofseveralmethodsofobtain­

not, and all are simple compared to the trick apparatus that

or later. Where fakepsychic extras’ areconcernedit isclearly
a case of ‘dead men tell no tales’. China heads (dolls’ heads
make excellent models), dolls, clay figures and wooden
images have all been utilised by the faker when it suited his
purpose. Barbers’ wax lay figures, with their carmine cheeks,
flowing golden tresses, blue eyes as big as saucers, and with

We have already seen how very easy it is to fake a plate
before or after it has been exposed. I will now draw attention
to some pieces of trick apparatus designed to ‘help out’ die

usedin diosc days, containedabght metal framewhich, mits
normal position in theintenor of the camera, rested upon the
bottom ofthesmaller ofthe two telescopic portions ofwhich
the camera was constructed. This frame was used to hold a
waxed paper positive upon which was the desired full-form
‘extra’. The simple movement of pushing in the dark-slide
actuatedaleverwhichraisedthisframe from ahorizontal to a
vertical position, taking with it the positive, which was thus
placed incontactwiththephotographicplate. Thewithdrawal
oftheslidewouldof courserestorethepositiveanditsframeto

Upon exposing the sensitisedplate, the ‘extra’ would be auto­
maticallyprintedon theplate atthe sametime astheimage of
diesitterwas being registered. Upon development, both sitter
and ‘extra’ would appear simultaneously, die opacity of the
‘spirit’ depending upon the density of the image in the paper
positive. A greatnumber (fifty-four) ofHudson’spictures are
wellreproducedinabook1byMissGeorginaHoughton,adear
old lady (who ought really to have been m a home) who
visited Hudson’s studio no fewer than two hundred and fifty
times betweenMarch 1872 andJanuary 1877. All ofHudson’s

andeach ghostly visitant is nicely placed against a dark back­

Havingthoroughlyexaminedthecamera(noeasymatter,by
the way), attention should be turned to the dark-slides or

trap,whichcouldbeopenedtoadmitaprojectedimagethrown
from the pocket, dark-room lamp, window, etc., andso well
made thatitcanbediscoveredonly by theclosestscrutiny. Or
the dark-slide might have a ‘flap’ arrangement which hides a
duplicate prepared plate which could be substituted for the
sitter’s. All sorts of things can be done with a cameralens. A
microphotograph1couldbeplacedbetweenthecomponentsof
a lens and the image thrown upon the plate. This method
mightanswerwithashortfocuslens, butIdoubtifitisfeasible
with one of long focus. Or the microphotograph could be
cemented m a pin-hole in the camera bellows, lensmount or

Then there are trick developmg dishes—black papier maché

If X-rays, infra-red rays and ultra-violet light can be con­
sidered as outside the range of the ordinary commercial
‘psychic’ photographer, radio-active salts andsubstances have,
I am certain, been used m the production of fraudulent
‘extras’.1 Abnormal markings can be produced on plates by

after a short time the plate is developed, the figures on the
watch will be quite visible in the negative. An ordinary gas
mantle (whichcontainsradio-activecompounds) will produce
the same effect, and so will many other substances, including
several ores and minerals. A bottle of radio-active sulphide of
zinc, placed near a stack of plates in a photographic dealer’s
stock-room, will certainly affect some of the plates in the im­
mediatevicinity; andifthe readershouldeverfind an unusual
marking on a plate, it would be as well for him to ascertain
fromtheshopmanwhethertheplateshavebeennearanyradio­
activesubstances.
As an example of the penetrating power of radio-active
minerals, I am reproducing opposite a print from a photo­
graphic plate affected by the minerals, thorium, uranium and
pitchblende. The experiment was a
s follows: a new box of
¿-plates, withaspeedof250H. &D., waspurchased, andwith­
out opening thewrappers or touching in anyway, was placed
onthedark-roombench. A numberofpiecesofminerals, con­
taining elements of high atomic weight, were then placed on
top of the packet and left for nineteen days, care being taken
that the box was not disturbed. The minerals used were (a) a
largepieceofJoachimsthal (Bohemia)pitchblende; (6) apiece
of thorium; (c) asmallpieceof uraniumnitrate; (d) apornon
of Cornishpitchblende. Upon development, thetop plate was
foundto have beenmuch affectedby the minerals. The pitch­
blendecausedmarkingsinwhich,withalitdeimagination, can
be seen ‘faces’ and other objects. The thonum and uranium
minerals were not so effective. Uranium is a metallic consti­
tuentofpitchblende. Thorium beingalsoametal, theoxide of
whichisusedin themanufactureof incandescentmantles, that
iswhy the emanations from a gas mantle will affect a photo­

othersareautunite,monazite,thonte,camotite,etc.
The remaining plates in the box were affected to a slight
extent. It would be possible to affect the top plate only, if the
minerals were apphed for a much shorter duration, andeach
plate were wrapped separately—like some brands of pan­
chromaticorX-ray plates. Itwouldalsobeveryeasy, byinter­
posing lead stencils (cut m shape of heads with apertures for
eyes,nose,etc.), toproducesomesortof‘faces’ onthesensitised
surfacesmanunopenedboxofphotographicplates.
Speaking of X-ray plates reminds me that a method of
obtaining ‘extras’ on aphotographicplatewassuggestedto me
by Dr. Warner Collins. A stencil of aface or a ‘message’, cut
out of a piece of sheet lead, is placed over an empty X-ray
cassette containing the usual two intensifying screens: the
whole is then exposed to the X-rays. The stencil is then
removed. Ifanyphotographicplateorfilm isplacedmcontact
with the cassette (which, of course, can be thoroughly ex­
amined) within threehours oftheX-raying, theimagewill be
perfecdy reproduced on the sensitised emulsion and will, of
course, develop up m the usual way. This phenomenon—
whichDr. Collinshastested—isduetoa‘lag’ onthepartofthe
rays, and the methodhasimmense possibilities for thefraudu­
lent‘spiritphotographer’.
Having now revealed to the reader many of the tricks em­
ployed by the dishonest medium, I will now tell him how to
circumvent them. The reader may argue that, though im­
pressedwithmy accountofthepossibilitiesoffaking, itwould
be quite uselessfor him to attemptto experiment with aspirit

he will cheerfully consent to this vital fore-control. There is

Your two medical friends will now examine the medium,
and this fore-control should be thorough. See that all body
orifices are explored, paying particular attention to mouth,
teeth, nails ofhand and feet (and between the toes), prepuce,
etc. The medical examination completed, the man should be
conducted by two persons (eachholding ahand) to the bath­
room. Ifhe reallypossessessome powerofproducing asuper­

studio. If you are an expert photographer, I suggest your re­
cordingthe remainderofthe proceedings with a slow-motion
cinematograph camera, which should register every action of
the medium.
Everything in the studio should be in readiness: camera set
up, dark-slides filled, chairs in position. Do not allow the

XII. Convincing Experiments with a French
Clairvoyante
uring a visit to Paris a few yean ago, I was invited to
give two lantern lectures on Eleonore Zugun and die
Schneider boys. During my stay a friend kindly gave me an
opportunity o f experimenting with a new French clairvoyante,
Mlle. Jeanne Laplace, die latest star to appear above the French
psychichorizon.
When I first met her, Mile. Laplace was a young French lady
in the early twenties, o f attractive appearance, and I was in­
formed that her psychic faculties became apparent soon after
her fiancé was killed somewhere in the French lines during the
Great War. She told me that immediately news was received o f
his death she got a message from him at a séance by means o f
raps on a small table they were using. They were experiment­
ing at table-turning. Up to this period Mile. Laplace had taken
little interest in psychic matters, but the experience I have re­
corded led her to experiment with the ornja board and other
mechanical contrivances with considerable success. She then
realised that she possessed die faculty o f clairvoyance or, as
Professor Richet would term it, cryptesthesia to a very high
degree. Her powers were brought to the notice o f my friend
who, at the time o f my experiences with die young lady, had
arranged a series o fexperiments with her at his house.
There was no previous arrangement that I should have a
sitting with Mile. Laplace. After luncheon at my friend’s house
on Saturday,January 29,1927, it was casually mentioned to me
that the medium would be coming in the afternoon and that
my host would like me to see her. It was arranged that I should
2 io Convincing Experim ents with a French Clairvoyante
speakno word to her, andmy friend undertooknot to intro­
ducemeormentionmynameinanyway.
In order to be scrupulously fair to Mile. Laplace and the
readerIwill recordthefactthatthemediummusthaveknown
of my presence in Paris. My lectures had been extensively
advertised in the FrenchPress, andas a frequentvisitorto my
friend’shouseshecouldhardlyfailtohavebecomecognisantof
thearrangementswhichwerebeingmade for my visit. Grant­
ing this much, and the fact that she was moving m French
psychic circles, she must also have known about me and my
work.
At four o’clock on Saturday,January29, my friend ushered
meintohisdrawing-room, whereIfoundMile. Laplaceseated
in anarm-chairwaiting for hernext visitor. My host’syoung
daughter was seated at a small table with a stenographic
machineatwhichsheisveryproficient. Shesaidtothemedium:
‘Willyou kindlygive thisgentlemanasitting?’ Ididnotspeak
aword.
ImusthereinterpolatethatthemomentIenteredtheroomI
was convinced that the psychic knew my name, nationality,
mybusinessinParisandotherdetailsofmylifewhicharecom­
mon property among persons interestedm psychical research:
being an intelligent girl, she must have known these dungs.
And Iwaspreparedtodiscountmanyofherremarksinconse­
quence.
I seated myselfbefore her, at the same nme that my friend
lefttheroom. Thepsychichadhardlycommencedherremarks
—all of which were recorded verbatim—when my host re­
turned with my left-hand glove which he had found on the
halltable. He handedtheglove to Mile. Laplacewho, it trans­
pired, much prefers to handle something belonging to the
sitterduringtheséance, inthemannerofpsychometrists. Iwant
toemphasisethefactthatitwasmyfriendwhothoughtof, and
procured the glove; I was previously unawareofthe fact that

told me about myself. Also, my modesty would prevent my

American connections musthave beenknown to her, asI was
then Foreign Research Officer to the American Society for
Psychical Research. Shecouldnot havebeenawareofthefact
that in a few weeks I was due to lecture at Copenhagen and
Oslo. I had ‘great intuition—almost mediumistic’ and I was
‘always making researches, with always the desire to make
more experiments’. My presence in Paris told her as much.
Many other statements about my character, life, health, etc.,
weregiven; but IdonotthinkIamdoing Mile. Laplaceanin­
justice when Isaythatall thesepointscouldhavebeengleaned
fromwhatshe musthave knownofme andfrom the factthat
she was m personal contact with me for more than an hour.

However, I must record one brilliant ‘hit’ which Mile.
Laplacemade. Shesaid—Iamreferringtodieverbatimnotes—
‘Sometimesyou are sad; you are dwelling on the ineffaceable
past. You arealways thinking ofsomeone andtrying to bring
backthepast; this revival ofthepastisoftenin your thoughts.
Youaresufferingfrominsomnia....’ This statementwas abso­
lutely and peculiarly true. Formore than amonth I hadbeen
worriedoveracertainmatterandhadlostmuchsleepinconse­
quence. The fact that Iwas ‘dwelling on the ineffaceable past’
wasliterallycorrect. Worry andinsomniaareusuallystrangers

like acertainhistoricegg, theresultsofmyséance withMile.
Laplacewere ‘good in parts’. I now come to the brilliant por­
tion of this psychic’s performance and the raison d ’être of this
particularchapter.
After IhadthankedMile. Laplaceforherendeavourson my
behalf, I askedher ifshewould give me her impression ofthe
original ofaphotographwhich Ihadm my pocket-book. She
said she would try. I opened my pocket-book and from
amongst about twenty odien I extracted at random a small
unmountedphotographofayounggirl. Thesizeofthephoto­
graphwasthreeinchesbytwoandborenowritingormarksof
anykind. Thephotographwasofayounggirlwhowasseven­
teenyean ofagewhen thepicture—full face—was taken. As a
matteroffact, theoriginal ofthepicturelooked younger than
her yean when the photograph was secured and might easily
have beenjudged to benot more thanfifteen yean old. There
wasnothingmthephotograph to denote thenationalityofthe
sitter:itwasjustaplainfull-freephotographofayounggirlof,

IhandedthephotographofthegirltoMile. Laplacewithout

‘impressions’ were being recorded on the stenographing ma­
chine.Thefollowingverbatimnotesarefromtherecordwhich
my friend kindly sent me, and from some additional impres­
sionsconcerningthepicturewhichthepsychicafterwardsgave
me. I must add that the original of the photograph was quite
unknown to anyone in Paris, and it was purely a fortuit­
ous circumstance that I happened to have die portrait in my
pocket:

Confessions o fa Ghost-Hunter 215
and will take Mile. Laplace’s impressions in the same way as
recorded, and will arrange my comments and explanations in
thesamenumericalorder:
1. Thisisabsolutelycorrect,Molliehavingpresentedmewith
theglovesforabirthdaygifttwelvemonthspreviously.
2. This iscorrect. Not afamilyconnectionbut agreat bond
ofaffectionexistsbetweenMollie, herfamily, andmyself. I re­
gardedtheirhouseasasecondhome.
3. Mollie isnot ‘endowed’ asamusician,but isintenselyde­
votedto musicandherhomeisfilledwithmusicalinstruments,
someofwhichsheplays.
4. An accurate descriptionofMollie, butthe ‘beautiful eyes’
and‘fairhair’ canbededucedfromthephotograph.
5. No;justtheusualinfantileailments.
6. This ‘impression’ is true to life, except thatherfriends do
notregardMollieashavinga‘nervousdisposition’.
7. An accurateimpressionoftheyounggirl.
8. This is absolutelycorrect. Shehas travelledextensivelyin
France,Belgium, SwitzerlandandHolland.
9. No signs of lung affection and is never troubled with
coughing.
10. TheimpressionsgiveninNo. 10veryaccuratelydescribe
Mollie’scharacteranddisposition, thoughatleastsomeofthese
attributes could be claimed by the modem cultured young
lady.
11. Though in all probability Mollie will travel, the names
‘Rolf—Walton—Walter’ have so far had no special meaning
for her or her friends, though she has had acquaintances with
thesenames.
12. This is an accurate description of a number of traits in
Molhe’scharacter.
13. Mollie is very artistic in her dress, tastes, etc., but the
reference to ‘art’ has a much deeper significance. Her father,
Mr. F.,istheheadofalargecompanyoffineartpublishers,and
1X6 Convincing Experim ents with a French Clairvoyante
Mollieherselfwasconnectedwithafirmwhichdealsinworks
ofartandwhoarepublishersofetchings,etc.
14. A true description of Mollie’s tastes, pursuits and dis­
position. She is particularly fond of dancing and motoring,
thoughnotperhapsmoresothantheaveragemodemgirlinthe
samesocialposition.
15. Incorrect.Shehashadnoseriousillness.
16. This, ofcourse, is unanswerable; she hasexperiencedno
dangerfromfireuptothetimeofwriting.
17. Mollie has weak ankles, but is never troubled with
coughing. Shewasnotillduringthewinterof1927.
18. Thisimpressionispeculiarlycorrect. Though allnormal
girlslove theirfathers,thereisanexceptionalbondofaffection
betweenMollieandMr.F.
19. Though I have known the F. family intimately for so
long, it was not until I started checking Mile. Laplace’s state­
ments that I discovered that Mollie’sbaptismal name isMary.
‘AnothernamebeginningwithM’ isobviously‘Mollie’. Icon­
sider this a brilliant ‘hit’. Mollie was twenty-one years old m
October 1926; the readerwill remember that she didnot look
morethansixteeninherphotograph.
20. TheconditionsofMollie’slifepointedtoahappyfuture,
and she married a year or so after the experiment here re­
corded. The fra thatsheisEnglishcould, I think, be deduced
from die photographitself, asher faceisundoubtedlythatofa
typical,young,culturedEnglishgirl
21. That shelives in thecountry iscorrect; also thefra that
herpeoplemovedintoanewresidenceeightmonthspreviously.
22. When I asked Mollie if her father had any ‘secret
trouble’ she answered in the negative; certainly none of the
familyknewanythingaboutit. When IaskedMr. F. himselfhe
admitted that some tune ago he was medically examined and
his heartwas foundto be affected. Nothing immediately seri­
ous, but seriousenough for him to decide not to mention die
Confessions o fa Ghost^Hunter 1 1 7
hearttroubleto hisfamilyincaseitshouldundulyalarmthem.
The‘secrettrouble’ isthuswellestablished.
23. Dr. Clark is the name of the medical adviser to the F.
family:agood ‘hit’.
24. Molliehasnot aparticularlystrongheart, butnothing at
allserious. ‘Impressions’ 22,23 and24 should, Ithink, betaken
together, as we get in conjunction a positive case of heart
disease, a ‘secret trouble’ and the correct name of the doctor
attendingtheF.family—areallybrilliantsequence.
25. ‘Marguerite*hasnospecialmeaningforher.
26. 1 have already stated that Mollie married. It cannot be
said that so far she has ‘improved her station m life’. But she
has a ‘residence in the country’, though the appartement ‘in a
city’ hasnotyetmaterialised.
27. TheCoted’AzurisaparticularlypleasantspotinMolhe’s
opinion,butshehasnotyetvisitedthispartofFrance.
28. Atthetuneoftheexperimenttherewassomeprobability
thatMolliewouldvisittheUnited States.
29. When Mile. Laplace pronounced the word ‘ness’, I at
first thought she said ‘net’ and that iswhat I put down m my
notes. I should add thatthisnamewasgiven to me at the con­
clusion of the sitting. When I arrived m England I asked
Mollieifshehadrecentlylostanyrelativeorfriendwhosename
contained asyllablewhichsoundedlike ‘ness’. Shecouldthink
of no one. Shortly after I met Mr. F. and asked him if his
daughter had recently lost a relative whose name contained a
sound like ‘ness’. He hesitatedamomentandthensaid, ‘Why,
yes, it must be Mollie’s godmother who died last summer.’
Now Mollie had always thought ofher godmother under the
name McGregor. But this name was assumed by deed poll
early in the Great War. Her husband’s name was Steinitz,
which was altered to McGregor under pressure of public
opinion, which regarded the holderofa Germanicnamewith
deep suspicion. Though Mollie knew of the change ofname,
2 i 8 Convincing Experim ents with a French Clairvoyante
shehad forgotten what the original name was, and always
thought ofhergodmotherandherhusbandastheMcGregors.
‘Net’, ‘ness’ and nitz’ are so very similar that one canhardly
doubt thatMile. Laplace reallydid sense part of the name of
Mollie’sdeceasedfriend, who was very fond ofher godchild.
The fact that the personsensed had ‘recentlydied'isconfirm­
ation of the fact that Molhe’s godmother was the person
indicated in die psychic’svery curious1impression’.
30. Every normal modem young girl is fond of pretty
clothes,jewellery,etc.,andMolheisnoexception.
31. This statementiscorrect; Molhe was educatedat a girl’s
publicschoolmanymilesfromherhome.
32. Theyear1928wasnotparticularlybeneficialforher.
33. Molheisespeciallyfondofdogs,andthisanswerispecul­
iarlycorrect.
34. The only ‘man who limps’ among her acquaintances is
herdentist:shepromisedtobewareofhim!
Ifthe readerwill carefullycompare Mile. Laplace’s ‘impres­
sions’ with thefactsa
srelatedby me, I thinkhewill agree that
thepsychicsucceededindemonstratingaverybrilliantexample
ofclairvoyance, lucidity, or aryptesthesia—call it what we will.
Fromthesmallphotograph (bust only) ofanunknownperson
she was successful in determining the Christian name, age,
personal appearance, character, disposition, temperament and
even the weaknesses of the original. The name of the family
doctor and die ‘secret trouble’ of the father are fine examples
of her extraordinary faculty. That she did not get these im­
pressionsfrom me by telepathyisprovedby thefact thatI did
not knowthatthesubject’sbaptismalnamewasMary; nor did
I know anything of the ‘secret trouble’ of the father, or the
name of the family doctor. Also, the Steinitz incident was
absolutely unknown to me; and die fact of the ‘weak ankles’
wasquiteoutsidemyknowledge.
C onfessions o f a G h o st-H u nter 219
Eighteen months after my experiment with Mile. Jeanne
LaplaceI wasagainlecturingin Parisandtooktheopportunity
ofhavingafurthersittingwithher.Ifoundthatherpowershad
developedconsiderablyandthatshewas much surerofherself
when giving ‘impressions’, which came quicker. Shealsohesi­
tatedlessindescribingwhatshe‘saw’.
My séance withMile. Laplace wasarrangedfor threeo’clock
in the afternoon ofJuly 7, 1928, and was held in my friend's
house in the Avenue NieL My host’ssister-in-law took all the
notes, the translationofwhichforms thisreport. Mile. Laplace
knows no English, butspeaksFrenchwith avery clearintona­
tionandthereislittleambiguityaboutherutterances.
The note-taker, Mile. Laplace and I seated ourselves in the
form of an equilateral triangle, the sides of which measured
about rune feet. I stipulated thatI should saynothing andthat
the psychic should not ask questions; it is recognised that an
astutepersoncanglean quite alot ofinformation byjudicious
‘pumping’.
Mile. Laplace does not go into trance during these experi­
mentsmtactileclairvoyance (psychometry), andsheundergoes
no apparent change during these tests. She boasts no ‘spirit
guide’, ‘control’, or ‘trance personality’; her impressions are
deliveredmthecourseofwhatisverylikeafriendlychat.
I had purposely prepared no tests for Mile. Laplace. In the
firstplace, Iwasuncertainwhethertheexperimentswouldtake
the form of psychometric readings or whether she would de­
scribe the scenes she clairvoyantly visualised. Secondly, I did
not want to load my mind with any pre-arranged ideas as to
howweshouldconducttheséance inorderto lessen,ifpossible,
the part that telepathy might play in the experiments. After a
numberofsuccessful tests I was askedto hand thepsychicone
more object, and she said shewould describe the mental im­
pressionsandscenesthatthearticleinspired.

XV Stage Telepathy and Vaudeville
‘Phenomena?
F
rom the earliest days o f what I w ill call the m odem vaude­
ville act, the stage demonstration o f a pretended sixth sense
has always appealed to performers and public alike. People
enjoy being fooled by some m ystery they can neither solve nor
comprehend.
The com monest and most ancient form o f stage ‘m edium-
ship’ is that which simulates telepathy or thought-transference,
sometimes termed ‘mental m agic— though I am afraid there is
much m ore hard w ork than m agic in this class o f entertain­
ment. ‘M ental’ effects can be produced b y means o f collusion, a
concealed telephone, radio, speaking-tube, etc., though m the
case o f professional ‘mind-readers’ these methods are now
obsolete. W e are apt to regard this form o f entertainment as
quite m odem , but it was Giuseppe Prnetti de W ildalle (c. 17 50 .
1800),1 a clever Italian and the first ‘scientific’ conjurer w ho
(with his w ife) really introduced (m 1783) the stage telepathic
act, and the method he em ployed was in the form o f a code,
certain words representing certain objects, numbers, colours,
shapes, etc. For exam ple, m the sentence, ‘W hat do I hold here?’
the w ord ‘hold’ m ight stand for the metal silver and ‘here’ for
watch. I f the w ord ‘holding’ w ere substituted for ‘hold’, the

Pnce, published in TheListener (Dec. 28,1932) is reproduced an engraving

Magdeleine was also trained as a dancer, singer and pianist.
Eventuallyitwasallegedthatunderhypnosisherinterpretation
of music and the opera was little short of miraculous. In the
—alleged—trance state, and stimulated by the music, a trans­
figuration would take place and she would dance, sing and
impersonate the character in die comedy or tragedy m a way
which was stated to be ‘transcendental’. The emotions were
portrayed ‘with a vividness which spellbound all beholders’:
terror,joy, envy, hate, desire, avance, pain, etc., transfigured
her countenancein away which, itwas stated, was not possible

in die room knew where the hidden object was, Marion was
permitted to see only one of these persons. This person, or
‘agent’, was placedinthe ‘sentry-box’ andwheeled (bysome­
onewho didnot knowwhere theobjectwas) about theroom,
behind Marion in his attempts to find the hidden object. (He
saysthathecandobetterifthe ‘agent’ keepsclosetohim.) The
remaining members of the audience, who knew where the
object was hidden, were screened from Marion’s view by
means of curtains hung across the room. They were told to
‘will’ Manontofinddieobject.
As our testsprogressed, we screenedvarious portions ofthe
‘agent’s’ body andfound, generallyspeaking, thatthe more he
was obscured, the fewer the successes scored by Marion. But
the latter was able to acquire helpful indicia from even afifth
partofaperson’sbody. Butwhenthe ‘agent’s’ bodywascom­
pletely hidden from Manon, the latter scored no more suc­
cesses than chance would account for. The audience on the
othersideofthecurtains,whowere‘willing’ Manontoseekin
thenghtdirection,didnot, apparendy,helphimabit.
We also tried another piece of apparatus, a light wooden
‘shroud’ whichcoveredthewholeofthe‘agent’s’ body, except
his feet. He was able to walk about the room m this ‘shroud’,
andcould see Manon through a thick gauze net m the head-
piece. We found that the mere fact of the ‘agent’s’ walking
gaveMarioncluesastothewhereaboutsofahiddenobject.
These testsconvinced us that Manon’s ‘telepathic’ faculty is
really hypersesthesia of some of the senses, plus the ability to
readandanalyseindicia unconsciouslyprovidedbyhisaudience.
Marion canfindanobjectwhenhecansee thepersonwhohas
hidden it, and if that person can see him, or hear where he
is; when that person is not present, or is invisible, he usually
fails.
Marion (a Czechoslovak) regularly tours Europe, and it is
probable that he will be inLondon again at some future date.

X V I. A Clever American Hypercesthete
InthelastchapterI mentionedthenameofDr. A.J. Mdvor-
Tyndall as being that of a platform ‘telepathist’ or mind-
reader. Heissogoodthatnoapologyisneededforincludingan
account of his work in these Confessions. I have called him an
‘American hypersesthete’ because he has lived in the United
Statesforsomanyyearsandhishomeisthere;actually,heisan
Englishman.White-haired, tallanddignified,one might easily
mistake him for an American pastor or colonial bishop: he is
not abit like the popularconceptionofamedium. Heis well-
known m the U.S.A. a
s a medium andlecturer on spiritualist
platforms.
Through the kindness of Dr. E. J. Dingwall and the me­
dium’s friend, Mr. H. W . Symington, Dr. Mclvor-Tyndall
gaveusademonstrationofhisfacultiesinmylaboratoryonthe
eveningofMay20,1935. Asheneverexhibitshispowersunless

experiments. This was composed of two thicknesses of stout
black fabric, between whichwas sandwichedalayer ofcotton

chapter on Kuda Bux, it is extremely difficult to blindfold a
personwithanydegreeofsatisfaction.ButIwill admitthatwe
thought it improbable that the medium could use his normal
visionduring,atleast,someofourexperiments.
The group invited to meet Dr. Mclvor-Tyndall included
Mrs. Henry Richards, Dr. E.J. Dingwall, Dr. Guy B. Brown,
Mr. H. W. Symingtonandhistwosons, Mr. S. G. Soal, Mr.J.
Fry,Mr. Ellic Howe, Mr. Peel Fletcher, Mr. Jackson, and the
presentwriter. Three of die group (Dr. Brown, Mr. Soal and

myself) were members of the University ofLondon Council
for Psychical Investigation. Miss Ethel Beenham, Secretaryto
the Council, made the verbatimnotes from which this report
hasbeenprepared.
In alittle speechto the experimenters Dr. Mclvor-Tyndall
emphasisedthatallhe claimedto dowasto ‘readconcentrated
thought*. He said: ‘I try to entertain people. In each demon­
stration I give, I like people to concentrate; everybody must
concentrate. I want to give aprogramme in which I can suc­
ceed, and you must help me. For the first demonstration, I
suggestthatthosepresentshouldconcentrateupononeoftheir
number. Itisbetterto formacommitteeofsixpersons:whenI
amoutoftheroom, theseshouldchoosesomeoneuponwhom
to concentrate. Iwill returnblindfolded, anddescribetheper­
sonwhomeveryoneisthinkingabout.’
Dr. Dingwall andI thentook themediumout oftheséance-
room. We plugged his eye-sockets with cotton wool which
was kept in place with strips of adhesive surgical tape placed
criss-crossfromthesuperciliaryarchtothecheekbone. Overall
wetiedourspecial mask or bandage. We thought it improb­
able that he could see.
During our absence from the room, Mr. Soal, Dr. Brown,
Mr. Howe, Mr. Fletcher, Mrs. Richards andMr. K. Syming­
ton formed themselves mto a committee seated m a semi­
circle.Thosenotonthecommitteewereindicatedbynumbers.
Mr. Soal thenthrewadieandNo. 1came uppermost. As Mr.
FrywasNo. 1, thecommitteeagreedtothinkofhimintently.
When we received the signal, Dingwall and I led in the
medium, who gropedhisway to thesemi-circleandseizedthe
hands of those at the two extremities. The other members of
diecommitteeweretoldto formachainbylinkinghands.Mr.
Soalwasatoneendofthesemi-circleandthemediumappeared
to concentrate on him. He dropped Soal’s hand, groped his
way round the circle, again seized Soal’s hand, but finally re-
280 A C le ve r Am erican H ypercesthete
markedthattherewas something thematter a
s ‘I cannotget a
picture’.
At this moment I lit a cigarwith a lighterwhich is almost
silent.Butthemediumheardmeandsaid: ‘Igettheimpression
ofsomeonelighting acigarette.’ Then hesaidhe could get no
impressionwithMr. Soal,andseizedDr. Brown’shand.Buthe
again failed and finally abandoned the test, saying that the
blindfoldwasnew tohim andwas causingasortofpsycholo­
gicalinhibition.Ithenremovedthebandage.
For die next test, Dr. Mclvor-Tyndall suggested using his
own blindfold, whichwas ahandkerchiefmade offairly thick
black silk. I took the medium out of the room and, m my
office, tied the handkerchief rightly round his eyes. We re­
turnedto thestance-room. The mediumgropedhiswayto the
committee, took Mr. Fletcher’s right hand, then darted to­
wards Mr. K. Symington and at once stated that he was the
person upon whom die experimenters were concentrating.
Thiswasquitecorrect.Duringourabsence, Mr. Soalhadagain
thrown the die and No. 3 was indicated. Mr. Symington was
the third on the committee. Not a word was spoken during
thistest,whichwasa
scleverasitwassuccessful.
The medium was now getting warmed up to his work. I
took him out of the room again and bandaged him with his
own silkhandkerchief. For this new test, he was askedto find
diechosenperson without previouslytouchinganyoftheaudi­
ence. ImmediatelyIledhiminto the room, hegropedhisway
to the circle and touched Dr. Brown on the head. He then
walkedslowlyroundthecircle,andpassedhishandsmfrontof
two or three persons. He returned to Dr. Brown and said:
Thisisdieperson!’ Thatwascorrect—andveryclever.
The next test was also partly successful. The medium said
that he received a picture of a person in a striped suit and
stripedtie’, and indicated Dr. DingwalL Thiswas notcorrect,
as Mr. Howe had been chosen. But both Dingwall and
28i

unter
Howe wore striped suits and striped ties—hence the not un­
natural confusion.
For the next experiment we tried one of the tests we had
devised for Marion. Five identical tin boxes were placed in
variouspartsoftheroom,eachlocationbeingnumberedoneto
five. It was arranged that a handkerchiefshould be hidden in
oneoftheboxes. IthentookDr. Tyndall outoftheroom and
blindfoldedhimwithhis silkhandkerchief. When signalled to
do so, we re-enteredthestance-roomandthe mediumwalked
slowly round the apartment. Coming to a small table, he
picked up the tin box which was lying upon it andsaid: ‘The
handkerchiefismhere!’ Thiswascorrect. During ourabsence,
Mr. Soal had determined thehiding-place ofthe handkerchief
bymeansofthedie. No. 5locationwasonthesmalltable. Not
aword was spoken during this test, whichwas reminiscent of
some of Marion’s successes, except that the Czechoslovak
hypersesthetewasneverblindfoldedduringourtests.
Thenextexperimentwas suggestedbyDr. Tyndallandwas
quitenewto me. Hestatedthatif, duringhisabsence, someone
wouldplaceaagar maperson’smouthfor amomentortwo,
and then hide it inone of our five on boxes, he would, upon
returning to the room, discover (a
) the whereabouts of the
cigar; (b) the person into whose mouth the cigar had been
placed.
Dr. Tyndallwastakenoutoftheroomby Mr. H. W . Sym­
ington, who blindfolded him with the silk handkerchief.
During thebandaging, Mr. Soalthrewthedieandnumbersix
came up. Counting from left to right, the sixth person in the
roomwasMr. Fry, so I placedoneofmy cigarsto hislipsand
thenhid it in aon on the floor. We calledin Mr. Symington
and the medium, who groped his way to the centre of the
room. Dr. Tyndallaskedustoconcentrateonthehiding-place

promised to do so. The medium walked slowly round die

Then he approached the committee and asked them to link
theirhandstogether.ThiswasdoneandDr.Tyndallcompleted
diecirclebyholdingthehandsofthefirstandlastinthegroup.
Hekeptrepeating,‘Thecigarandthemouth! Thecigarandthe
mouth!’ Breaking away from the circle, the medium walked
straighttothetinanddiscoveredthecigarunderit.
Having found die cigar, he—and we—now concentrated
upon the ‘mouth’. With the agar m his hand (and, ofcourse,
still blindfolded) he slowly made the tour of the circle, stop­
pingbeforeoneortwo oftheaudience. HepausedbeforeMiss
Beenhamandmurmured,‘No,itcannotbealady’,thusproving
thathecould ‘see’—either hyperzsthetically or normally-w
ith
hiseyes. After ‘testing’ one or two more oftheexperimenters,
he suddenly darted towards Mr. Fry (who had his mouth
open!) andput the cigarin his mouth. The experiment was a
success.
Ithenproducedanewpackofcardsinanswertoasuggestion
byDr. Tyndallthatheshouldshowuscertainexperiments. He
askedusto removethreeofthecardsfromthepack, and, inhis
absence, touch some part of a person’s body with them, and
thenhidethemindifferentpartsoftheroom. Heundertookto

Dr. Dingwall and I took the medium out ofthe room, and
thoroughly blindfoldedhim. On this occasion I used m y ban­
dagewhichIhadmadespeciallyfor thesetests. Inaddition, the
medium’seye-socketswerepluggedwithcotton wool,securely

Duringourabsence Mr. Jackson removedfrom thepackof

Whenwereturned totheroom Dr. Tyndall askedhisaudi­
encetoconcentrateonwherethecardswerehidden.Atfirst,he
triedtofindthecardswithoutcontactinganyone, and,groping
round the room, touched several books on the shelves, also
Miss Beenham’snote-book. Heremarkedthathecouldgetno
impression and would like to hold someone’s hand. He then
tookMr.Jackson’shand, withoutknowingthatitwashewho
hadhidden thecards. (Neither DingwallnorI knewwho had
hiddenthecards.)
Immediately he took Mr. Jackson’s hand, the medium ex­
claimed, ‘I get the impression ofhooks’. He went straight to
one of the bookshelves (ofwhich there are many stacks) and
at once picked out the ninth hook (which, ofcourse, was the
correct one) on row Ri, and pushed it back again. He then
took thebooknextto it (theeighth) andpushedthatback. He
againtooktheninthbookand,mhishesitation,halfwithdrew
it and pushed it back twice. At the third time, he fully with­
drew die book, opened it, and found the card (the seven of
diamonds)—a brilliant piece of work, considering that there
aremorethan6000booksmthestance-room.
Still keeping contact with Mr. Jackson, he led this latter
gentleman towards Miss Beenham, who was sitting at her
note-taker’stable, andpassedhishandupanddowninfrontof
herface. Askingherto standup, he took thenote-book outof

hisway towards die endof the room, stopped at the chairon
which was the lamp, removed die lamp, andfound the third
card (die two of hearts). We had witnessed a very clever
demonstrationofmuscle-reading.
Having found the cards, Dr. Tyndall stated that he would
findthepersontouchedwithouth o ld in g Mr.Jackson’shand.He
wasa
sgood ashisword, andwent straightto Mr. Symington
andplacedhishandonhis (Mr. Symington’s) forehead, gradu­
allylowering it until it restedon hisnose. This was correct. It
is easy to see how Mr. Jackson might have been dunking—
subconsciously—of Mr. Symington (who had been touched
with die cards) when Dr. Tyndall thought that a card was
hiddenuponhim.Thiswasverycurious.
Dr. Tyndallthensprangasurpriseonus.Hesaid: ‘Iwillnow
attempt to name the cards thatwere chosen.’ He hadnot seen
the cards, but they were handed to him, one by one, by Mr.
Jackson. He guessed, or ‘saw’, thefirstcard (thetwo ofhearts)
correctly; the seven of diamonds he thought was the six of
diamonds; thethirdcardwasnamedasthe four ofspades, but
he immediately corrected himself by saying: ‘I cannot really
seeit; I don’t know what it is.’ It was the king ofspades. The
bandage was then removed, and the cotton wool and strap­
pingswerefoundtobeundisturbed.
We continued with the card experiments. Dr. Tyndall was
again bandaged, and die lights switched off. In the dark, Mr.
Soal selected acard at random and handed it to the medium.
Ofcourse,nooneintheroomknewwhatitwas.Themedium
saiditwasdieeightofclubs.Thelightswereturnedon,andwe

both suit and pips with the same card. But the good ‘hits’ re-

cordedwere suggestive ofsomething more than merechance.
Theywereprobablyduetohyperesthesiaofthesenseoftouch,
which I have discussed at some length when dealing with
Marion.
In the above experiments no one in die room knew what
the selectedcardswere, asthey were chosenat random, in the
dark. As avariant, Mr. Soal looked at a card and then, in the
dark, handed it to the medium, who said it was the two of
spades. Itwas the two ofclubs. Bothnumberandcolourwere
correct,butnotthesuit.Thisconcludedtheexperiments.
Afterreadingthechapteron vaudevillemediums, thereader
willhaveno difficultymsharinginourconclusionthatwehad
witnessed avery clever demonstration ofmuscle-reading, plus
hyperesthesia ofsome of the senses. In the case ofthe finding
oftheagarand‘mouth’, wherethemediumwasnotalwaysin
contact with one of the experimenters, it iscertain that—con­
sciously or unconsaously—he absorbed indicia unwittingly
supplied to him by his audience. Ofcourse, Marion does this,
buthewasneverblindfoldedduringourexperiments. Inmany
ways Dr. Mclvor-Tyndall is even more impressive than the
Czechoslovak. Dr. Tyndall’s performance was the more re­
markable because—he informed us—he has not practised his
‘telepathic’ faculty for many years. If properly presented,
muscle-reading appears very mysterious indeed to die unini­
tiated. But the faculty is more common than is usually sup­
posed, andIknow quite anumberofpeople who candemon­
strate it. The distinguished editor of Nature, Sir Richard
Gregory,F.R.S., can‘muscle-read’, asheinformedmeduringa
demonstration by Maloitz, the ‘singing medium’ and hyper­
aesthete. But muscle-reading must not be confused with tele­
pathy or clairvoyance, though it is often mistaken for
purelypsychicfaculties.
XVII. A Tyrolean Nights Entertainment
I
n June 1925, on m y w ay to Vienna for some experiments
w ith W illi Schneider, an account o f w hich has already ap­
peared in a previous book o f memoirs,1 1 broke m y journey at
Innsbruck in order to ascertain whether the T yrol boasted o f
any mediums.
T hey take only a very mild interest in matters psychic in the
T y r o l A t Innsbruck I found there was a small spiritualist circle
which met at infrequent intervals; and at Hall, a few miles out
o f the tow n, there lives a physical medium w ith w hom I could
not get in touch ow ing to his absence from hom e. B u t if there
w ere no mediums in Innsbruck, there w ere mysdfrers and
mysteries— one o f w hich I solved
Before m y visit I thought that i f there was one place on this
earth free from guile, that place was Innsbruck, where can be
seen Nature in its most sublime— and sometimes most terrible
— aspects, and where man, and the w orks o f man, seem small
and mean indeed. One w ould expectthe truth at a place like
Innsbruck, where the mountains, w ith their sheer precipices,
thousands o f feet high, seem only waiting for a favourable op­
portunity to topple over and bury the town. B u t it was at
Innsbruck that I experienced one o f the most curious deceptions
I have ever encountered.
A t a beer-hall or W

ethere was billed to appear during
m y stay a com pany o f ‘Tyrolean peasants’ w ho, for three
nights, w ere going to entertain the simple folk o f Innsbruck
w ith ‘m irth, music, and— miracles’ ( W

foundmeanearlyvisitorseatedatatable,withintwelvefeetof
thelow platformon whichthe ‘peasants’ were going to enter­
tain. The priceofadmissionwas one Austrian Schilling (7$d.),
'm it B ier’.
Theperformennumberedfive, allmen,whoweredressedin
theoldandpicturesquecostumesoftheTyroleanmountaineers.
The ‘back doth’, hung on the wall at the end of the room,
represented an exterior resembling a Swiss chalet, familiar to
most of my readers. In front of the doth was an ordinary
wooden table, at which sat the men with ahugejug or Stein
from which they frequently took copious draughts ofamber-
coloured Pilsner. No ‘properties’, except a sort of wooden
sentry-box (which I will describe later), were visible. Truly, I
thought, a very mundane setting for wonders which were
advertisedasübernatürlich (supernatural).
Iwill passover thefirst partofthe programme, whichcon­
sistedofsome reallyexcellent musicon guitars, zithers, accor­
dions, etc., which accompanied their Jod els, songs common
among the Swiss andTyrolese shepherds. During the interval
the wonder-workers, though claiming aspecial knowledge of
the‘otherworld’, apparentlywereinnohurrytogo there, and
methodically passed the hat round; after which very material
proceedingtheentertainmentwasresumed.
When the hat had been emptied and the beer-jug replen­
ished, the leader of the party announced that one ofhis assis­
tants had been gifted by Nature with powers which enabled
himtoreadaperson’sthoughts‘evenatadistance’; to decipher
sealedmessages without seeing them; to find stolen property;
to discoverhiddentreasureandminerals; to tell aperson’spast
andfuture,etc. Infact,thismiracle-mongercoulddoanything,
apparently, except raise himselffrom the level of a fifth-rate
beer-house performer. I awaited his act with interest, espe­
cially as the assistant (who turned out to be die accordion
player)lookedanythingbutpsychic.

The leader of die troupe informed us (in German, English
and Italian) that he would blindfold his assistant, who would
then proceed to readthe number ofanywatchwhile the case
remainedclosed, die contentsofasealedletter, etc., andasked
for tests. About fifty persons at once shouted that they had
something for the mind-reader. The leader pointed out that
time didnot permit ofhisoffering more than afew tests; and
for thefirstexperimentayounggirl ofaboutfourteenyearsof
age, withflaxenhairandinnocent-looking blueeyes, who was
seated with her father and mother at the next table to mine,
would be selected. 1 will add parenthetically that I had my
watchon my table waiting for itsnumber to be read, but the
leaderpassedmeby.
The young girl at the table had in her hand an unopened
letter which she informed the audience had 'just come* by
post, andthatdie senderwas unknown to her. I could see die
address was typewritten. After these particulars had been ex­
plained to the audience, the assistant on the ‘stage’ was then
asked to do his best in reading the contents of the unopened
letter. Without the least hesitation, and with no word being
spokenbytheleader, thewizardontheplatformstatedthatthe
letterhadbeenpostedat Salzburgandwassentbyagirlnamed
AnnatoherfriendTheresa.Theletterwastypewritten,andthe
clairvoyant ‘got an impression’ that it was sent to Theresa
thanking her for her kindness during a week-end visit. The
leaderthenstatedthathewouldhavetheletteropenedandhis
assistant’s words verified. Before theletterwashandedoverto
the leader, I asked that I might be allowed to examine it—a
request that met with instant compliance. I carefully inspected
die post-mark, stamps and envelope, but could find nothing
wrong with them. The letter was posted at Salzburg (ninety-
nine miles from Innsbruck) die previous day, by the early
morning collection, and I thought it curious that it shouldhave
takennearlytwo daysto reachthe recipient, asthereaderwill

recollectthatTheresahad‘onlyjust’ receivedit. ButI madeno
comment, asanything canhappeninAustria. I wasconvinced
that the envelope had not bom tampered with, and that I
behelddieoriginalsealing.Thecontentsoftheletterwereread,
anddielittlemaidenblushinglyacknowledgedthateverything
theclairvoyanthadsaidwascorrect—atwhichtherewasterrific
applause,tattoosontableswithbeer-mugs,etc.
I pondered over the experiment with mixed feelings. My
first thoughtswere, of course, thatthe ‘test’ wasa ‘frameup*,
and that collusion accountedfor the seeming ‘miracle*, which
was greater than any accomplished by Sfephan Ossowieclri,
Bert Reese, or LudwigKahn (famous ‘billetreaders’). I repeat
thatIthoughtconfederacyaccountedforthephenomenon, but
aglanceatTheresa’sinnocentblueeyesandthestolidcounten­
ancesofherparentspartlyreassuredme.
The next test was given by an ex-soldier ofone of the old
Austrian regiments. It seems that during the Great War false
teeth (both upper and lower sets) were—I was informed—
made up in a series offittings, numbered, embossedwith die
royaleagle, givenoutto themenwhoneededthem, andregu­
larlyinspectedwith therestofthe soldier’skit. Ourparticular
soldierhadhadanuppersetpresentedtohim (perhapsforgood
conduct), and he asked the clairvoyant if he could tell the
number of it. Instandy came the reply No. 5434, Senes No.
48B. The soldier acknowledged the correctness of the reply,
removedhis teeth, andpasseddiem round for inspection. My
theory of collusion was becoming more firmly established—
untilafterthenexttest.
After the soldier had replaced his teeth, die manager then
‘accepted’ (he had refused quite a number of tests during his
progress round the room) a small parcel which looked like a
book from a benevolent-looking old gentleman, who appar­
entlywaswellknownamongtheaudienceashewashailedwith
cheers and cries of delight. Curiously enough, I had seen this
290 A Tyrolean N ig h t's Entertainm ent
man earlier in the day driving a procession of young boys
throughdietown—evidentlyaschoolmaster.Atlast,Ithought,
hereisagenuinetest,freefromthetaintofcollusion.
The parcel the schoolmaster held up (the manager never
touchedanarticleuntilaftertheconclusionoftheexperiment),
lookedlikeaflatoctavobook, abouteightbyfiveinches, done
up in a brown paperparcel and tied with string. He held the
parcel above his head and requested die seer to tell him the
contents. The fret that die assistant was blindfolded made no
impression uponme. It is practicallyimpossible to blmdfold a
person properly without employing drastic methods; but I
certainlywascurious asto how the ‘clairvoyant' was going to
see the contents of the parcel. The assistant admitted that the
problemwasatoughone, andinsistedthatthe Stein bereplen­
ished. After along pull at the contents, he saidhe thought he
could manageit, andproceededto become ‘very entranced*a
s
themanagerputit; butthispartoftheperformancewasnotat
allconvincing, thoughperhapsgood showmanship. Ifthebeer
consumedduringtheséance hadcontainedmorethanabouttwo
per cent, of alcohol, all the performers would have been ‘en­
tranced’ long before they arrived at the second half of the
entertainment.
After some minutes’ silence on the part of the seer, he an­
nouncedthat he could see anumberofpeople, mostly auslän­
disch (foreign), eating a meal. After describing other ‘scenes’
and‘visions’, heatlasttold usthattheparcelcontainedanum­
berofforms whichforeignersatAustrianhotelshavetofill up
fordiepolice—thelastthingintheworldaschoolmasterwould
be likely to possess. Thereupon die O berlehrer gracefully
admitted that the parcel did contain police-forms (which he
handedround) borrowedfortheexperimentfrom diefriendly
proprietorofaKosthaus (boardinghouse).
A storm of applause greeted the result of the experiment,
whichofcourseentitledthechiefactorto moreliquidrefresh-

ment. But I confess it left me more puzzled than ever. Of
courseIwasconvincedthatthewhole affairwastrickeryfrom
starttofinish, but—exceptfor collusion—Ihadno theoryhow
thetrickwasdone, underdieconditions.AndIcouldnot bring
myself to believe that the headmaster of a school, holding a
responsible position among young boys, would be willing to
play into thehandsof an itinerant mountebank. I marshalled
my knowledgeofthevariouscodesandsignals—silent(visual),
talking, and electrical (telephonicorwireless)—used inacts of
thisdescription, butnonewouldfitinwiththeconditions, and
onecouldhardlyseeacrosstheroomforsmoke—whichwould
make the use of avisual code difficult. The Zancigs were not
‘init’ with thesimple‘Tyrolean peasants’! Frankly, Iwasnon­
plussed,andwasbecomingimpressedwiththeapparentskillof
thetroupe.
For thenext experiment alight wooden ‘sentry-box’, open
on one sideonly, andjust large enough to contain aman, was
dragged to the centre of the platform, with the closed side
towards the audience. Into the box the assistant, still blind­
folded,wasplaced. Forthetest, theleaderacceptedaclosedbag
from what proved to be achemical student at die University.
Therewasno mistakeabouthisbeingatypicalstudent; hehad

the bag, but asked the hidden assistant to name the contents.
Thishedidveryquickly,sayingitwasagaseouschemicalcom­

To prove it, the student opened his bag, pulled out a large
amber-coloured bottle and removed die stopper. Consterna­
tion! A successionofcoughs, tearsandsneezesproveddiecor­
rectness of the seer’s answer, and a radius of several yards
round the student was filled with an indignant crowd «w
ing
their handkerchiefs, or what did duty for them. Those who
were near the poison-gas were indignant; those farther away

were amused. Fortunately, being at die front of the room, I
wasoneoftheamused.
Two orthreeothertestsconcludeddieperformance. A local
grocer (andhailedassuch) broughtabottleoffruits,wrapped
inpaper. The answerwas given correctly, with the addedin­
formationthatthefruitswere packedby Eisler, ofVienna. An
old lady with a shawl round her head wanted to know the
numberofherwatch. Answer: * 1 1 1 6 watchisacheapone, and
hasno number.’ Right. This last testendeda very interesting
entertainment.
I left the Stube with the great mystery still unsolved. 1 was
convinced thatthepersons (ifconfederates) who receivedtests
were not of the ordinary type of ‘assistant’. They were quite
unlike the usual ‘floor-workers’, ‘boosters’, 'horses’, ‘gees’, or
‘rides’ attachedtosomesimilarshows, andIwasawakehalfthe

The next evening found me among die tint to pay my
Schilling for the entertainment; in fact, I was thefirst to enter
the Stube, where I found the ubematurlich accordion-player in
die far-from-supematural occupation of sanding the floor. If
Ihaddiscoveredhimlayingdowntelephonewires,orinstalling

die remainder ofthe troupe came in, and I think I detected a

sooner than on the previous evening, and die ‘clairvoyant’
started businessjust before nine o’clock. Again the manager
refusedtotakemywatchasatest (Inoticedhehadglancedatit
several times during the previoushour), saying he would ‘see
me later’. He did, but not in the way he meant! The blind­
folded assistant started off by naming the number of an

gave thecorrectnumberofcigarettesinaclosedcigarette-case
(and the owner’sinitials on the inside of the case), andseveral
othertests—allcorrect. Andtherecipientsofthetestswerenot
thesamepeoplewhohadhadtestsonthepreviousevening,and
were obviously persons of good standing in the town and
quite above (one would have thought) being parties to a
common swindle.
I left the room about ten o’clockjust as perplexed as I had

I could persuade myself that the show was genuine—even
genuine trickery. And i f the ‘phenomena’ were real—what a
‘find’ for the National Laboratory of Psychical Research, of
whichIwasthendirector.
As it was rather too early for me to go back to my hotel, I
turned in at a large cafif garden on die beautiful Maria-Ther-
esienstrassefor acupofcoffee. Ihadbeentherenearlyanhour,
listeningtothemusic,whensuddenlyIheardsoundsoflaughter
behindme (Ihadmy backto theentranceto thegarden). The
laughter sounded a little familiar; so turning, I beheldto my
amazement die managerofdie ‘Tyrolean peasants* (but shorn
ofhisglory in theshapeofdie picturesqueTyrolean costume)
294 A T yrolean N ig h t's Entertainm ent
withanumberofthepersonswhose‘tests’ hadprovedsointer­
esting. The secret w as out! Each ‘guest’ was equipped with a
Stein of beer in front ofhim—except the manager, who had
apparentlybroughthisbigjug withhim. Theyoungchemical
studentwastheretalkingandlaughingwith thefair (butfrail!)
Theresa,whoseblueeyesseemedlessinnocent-lookingthanon
thepreviousevening,thoughherparentswereasstolidasever.
The benevolent-looking O berlehrer was apparently telling a
good storyto the railwayofficial,andeveryoneappearedto be
enjoying himself. By the time I had recovered from my sur­
prise themanager of the troupehadseen me, andI think that
the astonishment was mutual. He stared at me for some few
seconds, when I slowly withdrew my watch from my pocket
anddangled it on itschainin front ofme. This was too much
for him- He burst out laughing, and, excusing himself, came
over to me. He told me, m excellent English (but with an
American accent), that if I would wait for a few minutes, he
would send his ‘party’ off, and have a chat. His method of
getting rid of his useful ‘assistants* was by having their mugs
refilled and telling them to hurry up. This they did, and we
weresoonbyourselves.
After his bigjug had been replenished (thistime at my ex­
pense),heunburdenedhimself.To makeiteasierforhimItold
himthatwhetherthephenomenawererealorotherwise,Iwas
‘intheprofession’ eitherway, andanysecretshemightentrust
to me would be sacred. He saidhehadno secrets, with which
statement I wasby then inentire agreement. I asked himhow
he succeeded in getting such a good class of ‘booster’ for his
entertainment, andhe told me hehadnot the slightest trouble
in getting all the people he wanted. A few complimentary
tickets and a promise of ‘free beer’ procured for him all the
assistantsnecessary, andthey invariably came from the middle
oruppermiddleclasses. Healwaysprecededhisshow byaday
or two before it was billed to open, and at mice visited die

caffe, etc.,wherehefoundallthematerialherequired. He said
the Church looked askance at the real phenomena (which he
had seen in Czechoslovakia) but tolerated his show which, I
gently remindedhim, was basedon lies, deception and fraud,
and was the most outrageous entertainment I had ever seen.
He admittedthesoftimpeachment. He saidhishelpersentered
into thespiritofthe thing. I askedhim iftheynever talkedto
theirfriendsabouttheirpartoftheperformance. ‘Theydo,’ he
replied, ‘butthepeopleintheTyrolareverysimple,andnotice
nothingwrong.’ Irepliedthataftermy experienceathisenter­
tainment I did not consider the Tyrolese particularly un­
sophisticated! I askedhim to explain the mystery ofthe blue­
eyedTheresa’sletter, andwhether ithadbeenfirstopenedand
thecontentsread. Herepliedthattheletterhadnot beenopened
(thusconfirming myjudgment), butTheresahadbeenexpect­
ing a letter from her girl friend (who had stayedwith her the
previousweek-end) employedatanofficein Salzburg, andshe
guessed the purport of it without opening it. The letter had
arrived, as I thought it should have done, by the first delivery
onthemorningof the‘test’, andTheresaherselfsuggesteditas
agood ‘experiment’. I again told my friend that I failed to see
where the ‘simplicity’ of the Tyrolese came m, and that my
frith in innocent blue eyes had been shattered for ever. Espe­
ciallywhenaccompaniedbyflaxenhair!
My friend informed me that he was bom in Prague, had
travelled widely, andhad spent six years m the United States,
wherehehadacquiredthemodus operandi of‘puttingover’ (his
own term) the second-sight act. He had seen Bert Reese
(famousAmericanbillet-reader),andfailedtocatchhiminany
deception. There were many mediumsm Czechoslovakia, and
hehadseensome‘realmiracles’ there. Hewouldnottellmehis
name. ‘My realnameisofnointeresttoyou, andIhavealmost
forgotten it,’ he said, ‘andmy stage name I change asoften as
my clothes. One week we are Tyrolean peasants; the next,

anyofyourassistantseverlet you down?’ ‘Never,’ hereplied.
I then told him I thought he must have some extraordinary
secretby whichhegaineddie confidence and goodwill ofhis
amateur helpers; some subtle power by means of which he
could divert respectable schoolmasters from the straight and
narrowpath. ‘No,’ herepliedinhisbestAmerican-German, ‘it

XVIII. Adventures with a Showman-Hypnotist
I
t w as w ith no thought o f ‘experiences’ or psychic adven­
tures that I decided to spend the summer vacation o f 1926 in
the Bernese Oberland, and m y jou rn ey to Interlaken was taken
solely in the pursuit o f health and pleasure. B u t m y guardian
angel, w h o never misses an opportunity o f thrusting an adven­
ture upon me, w as apparently in fine fettle, and I had not
traversed the beautiful H ohew eg promenade m ore than twice
when I was attracted by a sandwich-man carrying a huge poster
inviting the public to view a film revealing the wonders o f

jU
m
— as it w as termed—quite a small sum was
demanded, and I mentally resolved to present m yself at the
Adlerhalle (where the film was being shown for one week) at
die first opportunity.
Cinemas and heat-waves do not m ix at all w ell, and several
times I put o ff m y visit to the Adlerhalle in order that I m ight
witness the K
u
ltu
rfilmin com fort. B u t the tropical heat con­
tinued and on the evening I eventually visited the hall the ther­
m ometer had recorded a day temperature o f 92° Fahrenheit in
die shade. So it w ill be gathered that the night was hot.
The Adlerhalle, Interlaken, is—fo r a Swiss tow n— a large
hall and holds about five hundred people. T h e film w as due to
be show n at 8.30 p.m . and just before that hour I climbed the
short stairw ay leading to the hall. A t the top o f die stairs a girl
w as taking die m oney— at least, she w as there for that purpose
had any m oney been forthcom ing. B u t she told m e that only

one otherpersonhad appliedfor admission andhe wasin the
hall waiting for the audience to arrive. She sorrowfully in­
formed me that unless the audience grew somewhat the film
would not be shown. As apparently die visitors to the Swiss
resort were more concerned in keeping themselves cool than
in having the ‘depths of the soul’ revealed to them, I was not
really surprised that atnine o’clockthe ‘house’ was still ofthe
same meagre proportions. Even the fact that ‘young people’
undereighteenyearsofagewerenot being permitted toview
die film did not on this occasion have the effect offilling die
budding. At thisjuncture the young man in the hall had his
moneyreturned to him, andI was told definitely thatthefilm
would not be shown that evening. I said I was very disap­
pointed.
Before 1 took my departureit occurredto me to askfor the
manager, asIthoughthemightbeableto give mesomeinfor­
mationconcerningthefilm. Hewasfetchedby the girlcashier
andenteredthehallaccompaniedbyayoungmanabouttwenty
yearsold. The managerintroducedhimselfa
sDr. med. Gaston
Haas, ofSt.Just, Zurich, andheapologised—inexcellentEng­
lish—for the fact that he could not show me the film. I again
expressedmy disappointment, atthesametimepresentinghim
with my card. Upon learningthe factthatI wasprofessionally
interested m psychic matters, he became exceedingly affable
andwe had a long chat about psychical research, spiritualism
andoccultthingsingeneral. Heclaimedacquaintancewiththe
late Baron von Schrenck-Notzing, the late Dr. Geley, Fritz
Grünewald (who was then still living), etc. He also informed
me that he was ahypnotist andthat part ofhis entertainment
was the conducting ofexperiments inhypnotism and sugges­
tion. Therewasnoindicationofthisportionofhisprogramme

Continent. Dr. HaasaskedmeifIwouldcaretoseedieexperi­
mental portion of his show, and I gave a glad affirmative in
reply.
It doesnot often & 1 1 to thelot ofthepsychicinvestigatorto
be die recipient of a private entertainment given by a public
showman, and I felt flattered. Dr. Haas informed me that his
‘company’ consisted of his girl cashier, who also played die
pianoduring the running of thefilm; the young man assistant
(whom Ihadalreadyseen),who washisprincipal‘subject’ and
operator of the cinematograph projector; and himself as
lecturer-demonstrator.At9.30p.m. onSaturday,July 17,1926,
we were all ready to commence what I amafraidI mustterm
theentertainment.
Theyoungmanassistantseatedhimselfonacommonwooden
chair in front of thewhite screen. He was told to gaze atthe
doctor’s eyes and did so. Immediately the doctor simultane­
ously clapped his hands, stamped his foot, and shouted out
‘schlafen (sleep),andtheyouthstiffenedhimselfupinthechair,
at the same time showing only the whites ofhis eyes, which
became fixed. Dr. Haastold the youth to removehis coat and
turnuphisright shirtsleeve. This theyouthdidquiteautoma­
tically, at the same time putting out his armatright angles to
hisbody. The doctornow drewtwo parallelchalklines, about
sixinchesapart, on theyouth’sforearm. He informed me that
hewouldrenderinsensibleto paintheportionofarmbetween
the two lines. He now produced a fine steel needle (on a
wooden handle) which he proceeded to sterilise with some
liquid. With theneedleheseveraltimesprickeddie portionof

his arm away ashe felt thepoint oftheneedle. Thehypnotist

ofsomeloose fleshbetweenhisfingers andpiercedit with the

tion of dieneedle, and he unmistakably winced—in fact, he
violently started. I imagined that one was supposed to keep
one’seyesfixedontheneedleduring thispartofdieperform­
ance. The doctor then withdrew the needle and sterilised the
smallpuncturesthathadbeenmade.Thehypnotistnowgavea
shoutandtheboy awakened’. Theyouththenleftthehalland
returnedafterafewminutes.
The next experiment was in post-hypnosis. During the
hypnotic sleep of the youth the doctor had willed that five
minutes afterhe awoke he was to go to a certain spot on the
platform, pick up a small Spanish onion, imagine it to be a
peach—and eat it. 1had carefiilly noted the time which had
elapsedafter theboy becamenormal, and at five minutes fifty
secondsafterthedoctorhadawakenedhimhewentoverto the
stage and picked up the onion, which he commenced eating
with avidity, at the same time smacking his lips. The doctor
askedhim what he thought ofit. The youth—who appeared
absolutely normal—replied that it was the best peach he had
evertasted. The doctorthensuggestedthatitwasnot apeach,
butanonion.Theyouthinstantlymadeawryface,spatoutdie
onion andrushedto the door for some water. By the time he
had reached the door die doctor suggested that what he was
eatingwas not anonion, but a peach. More smacking of lips,
die boy remarking that the ‘peach* was almost ‘too sweet*.
These alternatingsuggestions continued, andmy own impres­
sion is that die boy overdid thispartofdieperformance.
After die onion experiment the boy sat down again and
became ‘hypnotised* at ashout from the doctor, his limbs ap­
pearingto be rigidandhiseyesfixed. The hypnotistthenpro­
ducedabox ofpepperwhichhe askedme to taste. It certainly
was pepper, though not very hot; it was probably much

adulteratedwith arrowroot. The doctor then told me that he
would give a large spoonful to die youth, at the same time
suggestingthatitwassugar.Thiswasdone,theboychewingit
upwithreal—orassumed—relish.Beforehehadquitefinished,
thedoctor‘suggested’ thatitwasnotsugar,butpepper,andthe
youth immediately made some facial contortions andspat out
the remainderofthe pepper. The doctor thentook aspoonful
offinewhitesugar(whichItasted)andheldittotheboy’snose,
tellinghimitwaspepper. He atoncehadaviolentsneezingfit.
Then thedoctor saidit wassugarandtippeditinto themouth
of die boy, who commenced to swallow it—untiltoldby the
hypnotistthatitwaspepper,whenitwasimmediatelyspatout
with anexclamation of disgust. I am afraid that these onion-
cwm-peach-cwm-pepper experiments were not at all convinc­
ing. The ‘business’ wasoverdone. I must confessto aplebeian
fondness for onions andpepper, and I was thinking—as I was
getting hungry—how well they would have tasted accom­
paniedbyalitdelocalG ruferes.
At thispointintheentertainmenttwo menenteredthehalL
It appears that Dr. Haas had advertised to relieve various ail­
mentsby hypnosis andhadinvited the public to come andbe
cured.Thetwo men (onlyonewasapatient),thinking thatdie
film was beingshown, hadturned up to seethe doctor. They
wereaskedtoremain,andtheailingonewasrequestedtocome
to the front. He gave his name as Charles Frey, a furniture
dealer, ofInterlaken. His ailment—he stated—was a stiffneck
caused by a nervous disease which had commenced fifteen
monthspreviouslyandwhichwasgettingmoreacute. Hehad
tried many doctors—including five at Bern—who had been
unabletodoanythingforhim. Hisfriendconfirmedthesevari­
ous statements. Herr Frey, agedforty-one, certainlylooked as
ifhisneckwerestiffby dieway he carriedhishead. He could
turn it, he told us, only with the assistanceofhishands. Herr
Freywasaskedto sitdownbydieplatform.Hedidso,andwas

ordersaboutadozentimes.They wereobeyedinstantly. After
afew minutes oftheseexercises, Herr Frey was askedhow he

did not answer. The assistant was then told that he was the
lecturer, andwas directed toexplain theimaginaryfilm to the
non-existent audience. Thishe didquitewell, havingseenthe
film hundreds oftimes. The youth was thenawakened by an­
othershoutandastampofthefoot.
Dr. Haas next turnedhis attention to Herr Frey (who was
stillasleeponthechair) andputhimthroughsomemoreexer­
cises with a view of restoring his neck to normal. After five
minutes HerrFreytold the ‘audience’ thathe felt better, after
whichthedoctorsaidhewouldhypnotisedieboy again.
Thenextexperimentwiththeyouthwasnothingmorethan
a card trick. On die platform was a pack of cards and an
ordinary slate which, previous to die entertainment, I had
takendielibertyofturningover. Ontheundersidewaschalked
aheartanddie number io. After die boyhadbeenputto sleep
C onfessions o f a G h ost-H u nter 303
hewashandedapackofcardsandwas toldtomakean‘experi­
ment' with them to theimaginary audience. The youth stood
up, went to the front of the platform and shuffled die cards,
asking a spectator to draw one, at the same tune explaining
whathe wasgoing to do. At thisjunctureDr. Haas called the
youth'sattentionto thefactthatatdieendseatofthefifthrow
was a rude person making grimaces at the lecturer, and told
him to put him out. The youth immediatelyjumped off the
platform, rushed to the seat indicated, had a scuffle with the
imaginary interrupter in the empty chair, went through the
pantomimeofstrugglingwith apersondownthelengthofthe
hall and pushedhisinvisible captive through one of the exits.
Theyouth,veryhotandflurried,returnedtothestageandcon­
tinued the experiment with the cards, faces down, which he
again shuffled andpresentedtohis ‘audience’. Dr. Haastook a
card—which I noticed was ‘forced’ in the usual way, except
that here the‘forcee*ofcourse was a willing dupe,making no
efforttoavoidthecardpresentedtohiseasygrasp—andshowed
me what he had drawn. I was not surprised to see he had
‘chosen’ thetenofhearts.
After thecardtrick (thereisreallyno othername for it) the
youthwas directedto go overto the piano (inone ofthe side
aisles)onwhichthegirlassistantusuallyplayed, andwastoldto
turn the leaves of the music for the young lady. This was an
excellent piece of pantomime, the youth going through the
action ofturning theleaves, with appropriatepauseswhile the
imaginarypage was being played. He remarkedhow well the
girl played, andinmy opinionthisratherspoilttheeffect, The
youthwasnowawakenedbythedoctor’sshoutingathimfrom
adistance.
Herr Frey next called for the doctor’s attention and—still
sleeping—wasput through the usualexercises. He was told by
Dr. Haas that after threevisits (for which die doctor received
nopayment) themanwouldbepermanentlycured. Herr Frey

aboutaminuteboth appearedto beasleep.The doctortermed
this experiment ‘collective hypnosis’ and stated that he could
simultaneously affect a number of persons in die same way.
HerrFreywasnow awakened, but the youthwas told thathe
had both his legs in splints, and that he was to walk off the
platform into die auditorium. The boy’slegs at once shot out

men, andI have seenmanyexamples of thiskind. I have seen
also many ofthe allegedhypnotic featsofthe itinerant show­
men, tricks madepossibleby the employment ofconfederates
—‘boosters’, ‘floor-walkers’, or ‘horses’ astheyarecalledinthe
profession—and I must confess that the antics of Dr. Haas’s
assistants were much more like the simulated article than the
real Everythingtheboy didcouldhavebeendonebyhimina
normal manner. It is not particularly painful to have a sharp
needle thrust through the loose skin of one’s forearm, espe­
cially when that skin is pinched tightly—a proceeding which
deadens the nerves. And there are many lads who would be
glad toearnasmallweekly pittanceby eatingonions andpre­
tending they were peaches. I was not asked to assist in any of

XIX. 'The Man with the X-ray Eyes’
1I 'he possibility o f paroptic perception, extra-retinal vision,
X pseudo-vision— or, in simpler language, eyeless sight— has
intrigued a num ber o f distinguished scientists and others for
m any yean . Such men as H enri Bergson, Leon B ru n sdm cq,
Charles Richet, Anatole France, £ . Boirac, and Lom broso have,
from time to time, experimented w ith a view to ascertaining
whether a person can see b y means other than the norm al
organs o f vision. T he literature o f the subject is scanty, but at
least one student, M . Jules R om ains (Louis Farigoule) has pub­
lished a m onograph on eyeless sight which is extrem ely inter­
esting. T he tide o f his book is VisionExtra-Ritiniame, and there
is an English translation.1 R om ains assumed that as somnam­
bulistic subjects can, apparendy, guide themselves w ith re­
m arkable ease, with eyes closed or even bandaged, they m ay
‘acquire a prodigious delicacy o f sensation, and kn ow h ow to
make use o f a thousand signs which a man in a w aking state
passes b y w ithout notice. T heir hearing, touch, and smell
undergo “ hyperxsthetic” change and manage sometimes to
take the place o f sight.’ Believing that these conditions could be
induced or developed m certain people, he experimented w ith
several blinded victim s o f the W ar and others, and claims some
remarkable successes. R om ains invented apparatus designed to
eliminate all objects except the one used in die experim ent, and
found that his first subject, a blind soldier nam ed M ichel,
‘recognised the digit 4, which w as about eight centimetres high,
w ith lines one centimetre thick, placed under glass’. M ichel

‘butifyoucannotcoverupthem

assert, anditis,Iamsure,theexplanationofK

But K

. He argues—
quitelogically—
thatifallheclaim

XX. Pale Black Magic
W
hen Dean Sw ift ridiculed the alchemist, R ob ert Boyle,
in his Pious Meditation Upon a Broomstick, a very few
years had elapsed since L ord C h ie fJustice Hale had—in effect—
publicly avow ed his belief in broomsticks as a reasonable and
usual means o f locom otion em ployed b y die witches that duty
compelled him to hang. ‘I believe in such creatures as witches,’
he declared at the Suffolk Assizes, ‘because the Scriptures had
affirmed so m uch.’1 This direction to the ju ry had the desired
effect and he proceeded to sentence A m y D uny and R ose
Cullender, w h o w ere duly hanged four days afterwards (on
M arch 17 ,16 6 4 ). Specifically, they w ere executed for the crime
o f bewitching and conveying crooked pins, needles and tw o­
penny nails into the bodies o f tw o young children. The chief
‘exhibit’ in this case w as a bag o f nails which the prosecution
alleged had been vom ited b y the children. Sir Thom as Brow ne,
the eminent N orw ich physician, w as called as an expen witness,
and he explained to the ju ry , b y long and learned arguments,
both theological and metaphysical, h ow the humours o f the
body could 'w ith the subtlety o f the D evil’ produce a physio­
logical condition resulting m a flux o f nails. That argum ent was
enough to hang anyone.
From a seventeenth-century Suffolk court-house to a w ar­
time Unter den Linden is a far cry. B u t twopenny nails have
not altered m uch during three hundred yean , and w e n ow find

‘W

But the conjurers would not have it. They adm
ittedthat

ineffect—
‘It is asupernorm

*Mr. Gresham Reynolds, in The Tim es o f Sept. 24, 193$, points out the
extremeantiquityoffire-walking andquotes Virgil (A enetd XI, 787,788):
‘Etmedium feed pietateperignem
Culturesmultaprenumusvestigia pruna.*
These huesare taken from Amms’sprayer to Apollo for permission to wipe
outthedisgrace thathasbeeninflictedon dieTrojansin Inly by Camilla, the
Queen o f the Volsa. Frett pietate suggests that, even among the ancients,
fire-walking was considered a trial offaith; euUores denotes that it was prac­
tisedunderthecultofApollo.

Walks’, by Harry Price, Bulletin II o f the University of London Council for
Psychical Investigation, London, 1936 (20 illustrations and aBibliography).
