I have never   understood the term soul mate until I read the definition on your site. I now am   able to recognize at least 2 soul mate experiences and maybe more. I refer to   these people as those spirits that were maybe a part of a group of spirits on   the other side who were always my companions, as it were, &quot;my gang&quot; and we were   in agreement that we would bail each other out of trouble when we were on the   earth plane and when we were needed. I have recognized each one of these   individuals before I knew their earth names at times. A non-sexual drawing or   attraction to them in a common ordinary event.

I have had soul   mates appear when I needed money in a crisis just walk up to me and give me   $600.00 out of their pocket and say, &quot; this will help out and is not needed to   be paid back. &quot; At this time, my children had been kidnapped in a family style   custody argument and my spouse and I at the time, did not have money for a plane   ticket to go and retrieve them from another state. This soul mate disappeared or   moved away without even telling me they were leaving. It was bizarre. The next   true soul mate appeared as a teacher when I went back to college in my 30's.   Life was extremely difficult financially because I was trying to go to school   and raise 5 children on my spouse's salary alone. There were loneliness problems   as well going on for me because I was progressing and my spouse who was already   educated was starting to feel threatened that if I went to school I would meet   some one I cared more about. This teacher became the best friend I ever had on a   platonic level. He was placed into my life and introduced courage, love for   myself, and was after I graduated from school, a confidant. By the way when we   met he was in his early 60's. When I first met him, I could see a white light   surrounding him and was overjoyed to see him. This was ridiculous in the earthly   plane because I did not know he was a teacher, or would be my teacher, and he   seemed too humble to be a college teacher, but he was. I believe another teacher   that he was good friends with, had recognized the soul mate syndrome, because he   introduced us and told me that it would be good for this teacher to have me as a   student because he was losing faith in what he was doing because of the changing   personalities of the younger classmates coming in. So, I went in to this soul   mate relationship on earth believing I was helping guiding and supporting this   teacher, who turned my life around and gave me courage to continue on when my   life was unraveling.

We remained   friends and confidants until he passed away at 79. I had intuited 5 years before   that, I would be specifically losing him back to the spiritual plane. It was not   the usual, he is old he is bound to die thoughts. I made the most of this. I   have now in the past 3 years discovered a new soul mate who is female and we   first met by Telephone in our work setting with her being a staff person at   another agency worksite. I knew by phone that I wanted her closer to my life.   When a position became available in my office, I lobbied for it to be given to   this person. Her spirit is again, extremely pure for the earth plane and she   gives off this white light around her person. I work with her every day and   watch with awe how she selflessly gives spiritual comforts and blessings to   those around her. It feels like soft rain, or warm sunshine on a cool day. I can   not explain the sensations because they do not relate to sexual attraction nor   earthly passion. In both of the last two cases cited it was like drinking pure   water when one is dying of thirst. My fainting soul has been nourished by both   these individuals over years. Looking back it is like an eye-blink across time.    </body>
