 1868-1870  Monthly, irregular
 Manchester, England / Glasgow, Scotland(?). Editor: Rev. John Page Hopps.  Succeeded by: Medium and Daybreak
 1/1, June 1868-March 1870.  6 1/2 x 4.

 This was a 16 pp. monthly started in June 1868  by Hopps (1834-1911), a newly minted spiritualist and a Unitarian minister, radical, and well-regarded composer of hymns.  In reviewing the first number, the Spiritual Magazine of London rather aristocratically called it "a small, unpretending sheet-'a journal of facts and thoughts in relation to spirit-communion,' specially suitable for extensive circulation among working-class people ...."  The journal carried letters and reprints from the likes of The Spiritual Magazine and The Banner of Light. It was "bought" (he assumed the debt) by James Burns after 10 issues; Burns changed the name to Medium and Daybreak and began to publish weekly.  It lasted until 1895. The history of the journal is given by Burns in "The Origin and History of the Medium and Daybreak," Medium and Daybreak, vol. 6, no. 300 (December 31, 1875): 833-835.  See also  J.J. Morse in "English Letters-No. 2," Banner of Light 28/24 (March 11, 1876): 6.  Hopps' appreciations of Kate Fox and of Henry Slade as mediums are both available online.  His book on Death a Delusion is reviewed in Lucifer (October 1893): 158.  Benjamin Coleman, in Psychische Studien in 1874, says the journal was a weekly and published in Manchester.  Hopps went on to publish The Truthseeker and other Christian reform journals. Harry Price Library; University of London; Princeton University (3 issues, 1868, 1869).
