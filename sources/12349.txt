At the time just before I was hit, the vision unfolded before me.  When the car hit me, I was lifted off the bike.  The spot where my foot would have been was where the bike was crushed.  I was tossed over 13 feet, landing on my shoulder and head. 

I was seeing shadows raising me and around me.  I was feeling a deep sense of love and compassion.  The beings were very vivid and were calming me.  Then I came back to this realm.  But the vision has stayed in me.  Every time I have been back to that area, something happens: like that was my time.
