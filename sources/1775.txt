 Felicie Onetta Crossley (1899-1976), who edited this journal, was a convinced spiritualist (she proclaimed herself "greatest spiritualist in California, if not the entire world") but the spirits' messages had a decided New Thought tone, reflected in "Delta Samadhi's" The Master Key to Psychic Unfoldment: A Physiological, Psychical and Philosophical Analysis, edited by her in 1931.  The journal contained "C.S.S.A. News" and notices of churches and societies, contributions by J.C.F. Grumbine, B.D., Delta Samadhi (on the "spiritualization of the physical"), A.T. Piercy, Patricka D'Este, Lida W. Amerige, Numerologist, Moses Hull (presumably his spirit, "through the courtesy of Mrs. J.R. Francis"), D.J. Bussell ("Thoughts for Daily Living"), et al., and the usual current advertisements for free horoscopes, "Name Analysis and Prophecy from the Birthdate," "V.P.O. for Radiant Health," "Psychic Unfoldment," etc.  Noted in Astrosophie, May 1932, which emphasizes the "simplicity and practicality" of the journal's articles on the little known occult powers in man.
