  		              		Experience Description   

  I suffered a pulmonary embolism. Time stood still. The doctors and nurses trying to save my life seemed familiar; as if they had been longtime friends. During my unconsciousness, I had many questions answered in a strange way. I didn't see a tunnel. There was a light that seemed to vibrate and emit a kind of sound. I can't explain this, but the light took my fear away. 

My lung miraculously recovered within 14 days. I believe that the light was my salvation.
