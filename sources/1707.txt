PREFACE.
I A GREAT and learned prelate of the Church of England
has declared _that 'authority is the greatest and most
irreconcileable enemy to truth and rational argument
that this world ever furnished out since it was in being;-
against it there is no defence :-it is authority alone
that keeps up the grossest and most abominable errors in
the countries around us : it was authority that would
hare prevented all reformation where it is, and which has
put a barrier against it where it is not.' Here are five
luminous truths, expressed in the most simple and laconic
manner: yet the philosopher, who studies nature, and
follows truth ought not to be discouraged on account of
this formidable antagonist; he must have the firmness to
speak the truth boldly for the sake of the few 'vho are
capable and willing to think for themselves; for, unless
we are allowed to endeavour to convince others of the
truth of our opinions, all teaching may as well be laid
aside: but as for the bulk of mankind, who take human
fictions and fancies for heavenly instructions, and who

are the voluntary slaves of prejudices, error, and supersti-
tion, they are as incapable of discerning the truth as frogs
are of flying.
The rational and virtuous education of youth can
never take place in countries where the mind of man is
enslaved by authority, and where the ecclesiastics, who
have an opposite and exdusive interest, engross not only
the education of youth, but keep the consciences of old
men under their control, and being backed by the false
zeal and ignorance of the peoplei the few who have
penetration and judgment are obliged to give way to the
prevailing absurdities. We are exceedingly apt and
ready in condemning the ridiculous creeds of other na-
tions, while our own contains as great, if not greater
absurdities, to which, nevertheless, we give the most
implicit assent; the articles of our faith and creeds being
handed down from our predecessors, and to which we
have the title of tradition only. The greater the
ignorance and folly of the people, the more easily will
they be imposed upon by crafty mystagogues, and when
the latter have really no religion, (perhaps a very common
case), and the former abound in the wild zeal of the
fanatic, the church, we may rest assured, is in a flourisl1-
ing condition. But all systems founded on notions of
preternatural revelation, are in great danger when men
PREFACE. v
place their religion in virtue and sound morality ; for
then the people have no bigoted veneration for the
'Sacerdotal Stole,' and priests would be held in no esti-
mation, except in as far as they set the example of
virtuous habits, in promoting the moral good of society:*
but wherever morality is not made the ground-work of
religion, they have succeeded in making the people
believe that eternal happiness can be dispensed by them
alone, or at least through their means; and in thus
getting the management of what they call spirituals in
their own hands, the highest degree of temporal ad-
vantage has necessarily followed, and in this latter point
they have succeeded so admirably, that in almost all the
Christian countries of Europe, the temporal interest of the
priesthood is mistaken, and passes for the soul-saving
spiritual interest of the laity.
• Instead of a theological, men should be taught a natural
morality,-instead of interdicting intemperance and vice, because
they are offensive to God and religion, they should be prevented by
convincing man that they are destructive to his existence, and
render him contemptible in society; that they are disapproved and
forbidden by reason and nature, who aim at his preservation, and
direct him to take the path that leads to permanent felicity ; and
independently of the future rewards and punishments announced
by religion, it is easy to prove to every man that it is in this world
his interest to preserve his health, to respect virtue, acquire the
esteem of his fellow creatures, and, in fine, to be chaste, temperate,
and virtuous.-Ecce Homu.
Vl PREFACE.
We all have sufficient means of knowing how widelY.
the Christian world differ in the religion they teach ;
what absurd revolutions of opinion have been amongst
them, and the horrid scenes of inhuman cruelty which
these differences have occasioned; what monstrous ab-
surdities prevail in most places, and what excessive
ignorance everywhere ;-the madness of inventing a
revelation to patch up what they call the defects of
reason, and again super-adding reason to supply the
defects of revelation.
\Vhen we duly consider these melancholy realities,
and the sad evils they produce, we are warranted in
asserting that sucl1 a state of things would not be
tolerated or endured amongst men, were they not com-
pelled by that power and authority which the Church
derives from its pernicious connection with the State;
for it was one of tl1e grandest points ever effected by the
clergy of any country in former times, to get their super-
stition made ' part and parcel of the law of the land.'
This was clenching the fetters upon men's minds, for
whoever ventured to attack the knavish absurdities of
the priest,* was punished by the civil magistrate : and
thus the honest and the virtuous became sufferers for

obeying their reason in preference to revelation, it
appearing to them more certain that God is the author
of h~;in re~!l' t~n that he is the a.!:1hor of any
particular book. It is perfectly amazing that it should
- -....-.
enter the head of any man to suppose that he has, or can
possibly have, a right to dictate to others in matters of
opinion~ and still more so that men should be so weak as
to admit and allow of such tyranny: yet such is the
credulity of those who have never been allowed to thiuk
for themselves, that the clergy find it an easy task to
impose any thing upon the obedient people, if they
recommend it with a convenient gravity and solemnity;
this holds good with respect to all religions, whatever
may be their component parts, for if we take a look into
Pagan or Christian traditions, we shall find that their
Theological legends were cl1iefly composed of Mytho-
logical fables,-the Jews copying from the Eg·yptians,
Phenicians, and Chaldeans ; and the Christians, after the
second century, when the primitive principles of the
Son of Mary no longer existed, imitated all of them in
the way of parody.
and they (the priests) bridle us, they saddle us, they harness us,
they spur us, they lay yokes and burdens upon us.' I will add, that
our own priests would do all that Scioppius complains of, if tliey
liad tl1e pou·er.
Vlll PREFACE.
The ancient Egyptians, from the use of hieroglyphics
in their religious ceremonies, gradually introduced the
greatest absurdities ;-the Ox, that patient and laborious
animal, was at first nothing more than a symbolical
representation of the means by which the earth was
cultivated; but this,simple idea was afterwards forgotten
in the ignorance of the people, who began in downright
earnest to adore the beast itself;-in like manner, but
with still greater absurdity, we of modern times, having
created our deity, degrade him into a similitude with
ourselves, and then we eat and drink him !!!
The hierophants, or religious impostors of antiquity,
taught their silly followers to adore female deities, who,
by their own account, were guilty of every species of
debauchery,-to worship goddesses greatly inferior to
the courtesans. Such in every age has been the true
character of all those traffickers in divine commodities,
or preternatural deceptions, that whenever any chimera,
no matter how shameful and humiliating to reason, was
adopted, and suited their interest, they would never
allow themselves to be undeceived, but imagined a
thousand wretched shifts, rather than abandon the most
palpable error: but this is not to be wondered at, since /
they live by the weakness and folly of the bulk of
mankind.
PREFACE. IX
To multiply human virtues depends upon societies
well ordered and regulated by good laws, to nourish and
protect those virtues ;-instead of which, the most effec-
tual means are most commonly applied to ends that are
of all others the least to be desired, and every vigilance
and anxious care is taken to instil in early youth non-
sensical creeds which of necessity can have no other
ground to rest upon than the supposed knowledge and
veracity of those deeply-interested teachers ; and it is
too certain that in this predicament, a very large
majority of our fellow creatures continue to be children
all their lives. Partly from an indolence of mind, and
partly from a superstitious timidity, they never once
attempt to examine matters thoroughly, but contentedly
take up with such notions, right or wrong, as their
instructors see their own interest in adopting for them
and what thus begins in faith cannot end in reason.
It is obvious therefore that the pliant, passive belief of
this vast majority of mankind, must be entirely at the
discretion of the rnling powers in church and state, and
consequently, should these powers adopt a new religion,
with rituals and creeds diametrically opposite to the
present, the mass* of the people would go on to think

themselves bound to believe in the manner prescribed
by authority; or in whatsoever way their godfathers and
godmothers had engaged for them to believe ;-and
hereby the ignominious fetters of mental slavery are
rivetted, although there is nothing in the case that has
any thing to do with ,belief, properly so called, because,
that which alone deserves that name, is the result of a
full and satisfactory conviction of the judgment; and
for any man to say that he believes in that which he
never allowed himself to examine thoroughly, is as
direct a falsehood as it is possible for him to utter.
Anything in the form ofapology for self-evident truths,
cannot have any effect on these who have so little sense
as to deny them :-they are the foundation of all reason-
ing, and the only just bottom on which men can proceed
in convincing one another, and by consequence, whoever
is capable of denying them, is not in a condition to be
informed, and under such a distempered state of mind, it
remains only for them to follow their own disordered
fancies, or what is more common, to be guided by the
and quarrel about things doubtful; we decree every year of the
lord, a new creed concerning God; nay, every change of the moon
our faith is altered. We repent of our decrees,' (as we have made
God repent of his), 'we defend those who have repented of them,
and we anathematize those we have defended.'

dictates of artful, and deeply interested men ; or by crazy- /
brained fanatics, for as truth will never serve the purposes
of knaves, so it will never suit the understanding of
fools ; and the latter will ever be as well pleased in
being deceived, as the former in deceiving: and when
we consider that private interest is a more formidable
enemy to truth than ignorance, and that in the,present
case, its chief security consists in the fostering of igno-
rance, the prospect of any very considerable mental
improvement amongst the bulk of ·mankind, is greatly
darkened, and almost hopeless, for this private interest in
the priesthood creates the love of wealth, avarice, ease,
and power ; disguised under the imposing robes of the
order, giving them that ascendancy in society that is well
calculated to perpetuate these evils ; and having igno-
rance and prejudice as their steady upholders, they are
likely to continue as they ever have done, fatally to
mislead the million by subduing their reaso~, palming
upon them absurd and unintelligible dogmas as the clear
and equitable precepts of the Supreme Being, and
hereby banishing truth and honest sincerity, and conse-
quently, goodness and virtue, all arising from the foun-
dation of truth; for there cannot possibly be any thing
deserving of the name of goodness, unless it has truth's
impression.
Xll PREFACE.
As the growth of miracles appears most abundant in
the compilation of what is called the Old Testament, it
may be observed here, in the prefatory way, that, although
the Mosaic accounts of the originals of men and things
are in many instances so perfectly ridiculous as to excite
our risibility, yet such is the force -of custom* and
pre-instilled opinions, that they are embraced without
the least scruple or examination; but ifwe had read stories
of a like absurd and incredible nature in the writings of
one of the early Mahometans, or in those of a Grecian
philosopher, our minds would have been filled witl1
objections, and the relation of each prodigy would have
met with scorn and sarcasm rather than belief; and how
can this difference arise, but from the early impression
that is made on our minds that Moses had heavenly
inspirations ?
The title of an atheistical or heretical pamphlet will be
bestowed upon these lectures by any fiery zealot into

whose hands they may fall; and under the pretence of
being a champion for truth, he is supported by ignorance
and malice as his seconds. But does he know wherein
the nature of atheism consists? It would be atheism to
assert that there is no Almighty Power ruling the universe,
or to deny the benevolent providence of that power.
Men holding such opinions as these would be atheists,
but not so much so as those bigoted fanatics who, building
upon false premises, continue obstinately in the most
absurd errors. The unthinking herd of mankind, whose
superstition is grounded upon the assimilation of the
Supreme Being with themselves, are apt to think that
every one they hate is the enemy of the Almighty Power,
and that all who differ from them in opinion are atheists ;
not rightly considering that he is the best Christian who
is the most honest man. And, therefore, if any man
blames me for comparing Christianity witl1 Paganism, he
shows nothing but his unworthy distrust ofthe sufficiency
of the religion he professes.

ON MIRACLES.
IT is contrary to nature, to reason, and to all experi-
ence, that a miracle should be true; but it is not contrary
to nature, to reason, or to experience, that a man, or a
class of men who lived about two thousand years ago,
should propagate falsehoods:. on the contrary, falsehood
is a coin that has ever been in ready currency amongst
mankind, and the more outrageous it is against truth
and common sense, the more readily it has generally
been received by the ignorant and deluded multitude;
because, in things supernatural the weak mind is taken

by surprise, is strongly affected, and adheres, unites, and
commits itself without ever comprehending them, " and
it is too late to make use of reason after we have long
subjected it to the obedience of faith."
A very profound philosopher has observed that, " A
miracle is a violation of the laws of nature, and as a firm
and unalterable experience has established these laws, the
proof against a miracle, from the very nature of the fact,
is as entire as any argument from experience can possi-
bly be imagined; and therefore, no testimony is suffi-
cient to establish a miracle unless the testimony be of
such a kind that its falsehood would be more miraculous
than the fact which it endeavours to establish."- The
stupendous order of nature, the revolution of hundreds
of millions of globes or worlds, round a million .of suns,
may be called miraculous, yet in all this nature is still in
an even and invariable course, acting by self-existing
laws, immutable and inviolable. If it should be asked,
" Cannot a law that is established by God himself be
suspended by its author?" we reply that it cannot; for,
beside the impossibility, there is the highest degree of
impious arrogance in venturing to suppose that the
omnipotent all-ruling power would act as men do in
making laws that were afterwards to be suspended or
vioJated.
ON MIRACLES. 3
It appears clearly enough that the mass of miraculous
stuff that has been handed down to us from the early
times of our holy church, and which we are called upon
to believe, was manifestly confuted even in those very
times; and for this strong reason, some of the primitive
priests or fathers, viz. Origen, Eusebius of Cresaria,
/
Julius Africanus, and others, have taken care to destroy
or mutilate the works of almost all those philosophers
and men of learning who lived in or near their own
times, and who exposed the tricks and legerdemain of
the early fabricators of our religion, who had even then
departed entirely from the moral simplicity of the orig·i-
nal : they have left us nothing of Berosus, or of Celsus
the epicurean, except as much of them as it suited their
ends to quote in their own works; and as for ]\fanetho,
Porphyry Symmachus, and others, they are so mutilated
that we have only fragments of them remaining.* ·After
destroying or suppressing the works of those learned
men whose arguments they could not answer,-after
making away with such respectable authorities against

forbidden, on pretence that they were written by heathens; and
the bishops themselves, at the Council of Carthage, about the year

4 LECTURE I .
their artful and imposing systems, their successors in
the church now tell us that miracles are no long€r
wanted, but that formerly they were wrought in favour
of mankind, for the purpose of establishing the Christian
religion ; but had not !!11the old r~ig}ons the same P.!!:.:
t,tnsions to miracles? Are not the Pagan legends and
traditions full of them? And have not a vast number of
them been imitated and dressed up afresh by the Chris-
tians? But the most absurd and extravagant miracle of
all is to imagine that the supreme power should, in
favour of a few ants on their little ball of earth, derange
the operation of those eternal and immutable laws inhe-
rent in, and inseparable from matter, and which govern
the vast machinery of the universe. Such departures
from nature are the delusive ravings of theological art,
but everything that has not reason in it and for it, is
man's superstition, and not religion of God's or nature's
making ; so all religions except that of nature and rea-
son, bear the impression of man, that is, of fraud and
falsehood. The favours of that supreme power which
rules all nature (by nature's laws alone) consist in its
laws themselves, and therefore to dare to ascribe mira-
cles, or what is the same thing, fickleness and imbeci-
lity to it, is an impious insult, allowing for a moment
that poor miserable man san insult that power so tran-
ON llllRACLES. 5
scendently great as to be altogether beyond his compre-
l1ension.
'Ve have seen that all religions from the highest anti·
quity have had their miracles, and wl1y should not the
Christians have theirs also ? for their priests stood as
much in need of them as did those of the older systems
of the Pagan religions ; so accordingly they adopted as
an example the Pagan and Jewish mythology and rites,
perceiving the immense power and influence that mira-
cle and mystery held over the vulgar mind; but this
species of delusion was everywhere, and in all ages, /
almost wholly confined to the illiterate rabble ; " for all
the philosophers and historians of Greece and Rome are
either silent in regard to such fooleries, or treat them
with derision and contempt; for these sages were very
far from admitting the tricks of priests, or the bigotry
of the lower orders of mankind, as the standard of
truth."
It is not only remarkable but surprising, that all na-
tions who have given up the simplicity of nature, and
become what is called civilized and polished, have fabri-
cated books of theological mysteries and prodigies which
may justly be regarded as the source of the greatest
evils and calamities experienced by mankind : in them
we discover the root and germ of intolerance, the ran-
6 LECTURE I.
corous hatred that springs from the conflicting dogmas
of priests, the religious wars consequent thereon, and
the dreadful devastations which superstition, backed by
authority, has entailed upon the human raee. This is
the religion of unnatural prodigies, that has rendered
men morose and unsociable, gloomy-minded, fierce, and
cruel; and to act in everything _
throughout their lives
with a tendency to all that is destructive of their com-
mon welfare ; but chiefly in the expedient which they
have found out, at a vast expense, of hiring p~ons to
bi;._wilder re_!!son and common sense. As these religions
have multiplied, and again been subdivided into sects,
the erection of more churches entailed so much addi-
tional expense upon the industry of the people to main-
tain them, while the black train of evils already noted
has increased in equal proportion.
Nothing but reasoning can improve reason, and no
book can improve my reason in any point, unless it gives
me convincing proofs of its reasonableness; and a reve-
lation that will not suffer us to examine and judge of its
dictates by our reason, is so far from improving, that it
forbids the use of reason, and if that faculty is left
unexercised, it will have as little force as unexercised
limbs.
All belief in miracles must necessarily exclude reason
ON MIRACLES. 7
and experience, and so general has been the infatuated
belief in them, that it would be difficult to mention a
single nation in which the roost incredible prodigies have
not been performed; and it has always happened that
the most monstrous and absurd liave been invented in
those countries where the mass of the people had little
knowledge of reading and writing, and consequently
they were the secure and easy prey of their spiritual
lords the priests. Thus we see, that amongst the nume-
rous systems of revealed religion with which the credu-
lity of man has been saddled, not one of them has been
without its code of miracles, and the priests of each have
invariably denied the truth of every one except their
own; and each of these infallible guides will give you
an unerring rule, one that, according to their own asse-
veration, cannot err, that is, by an implicit belief b.1/
faith in the particular doctrine that each of them pro-
mulgates. Now, that which proceeds from reason and
common sense, we know to be true, but what proceeds
from faith is believed only as a sort of obligation.*
" Neither reason nor study, says Boulanger, are necessary to
men who submit their judgments to the yoke of faith. From the
confession of Christians themseh:es, the founders of their religion
were simple and ignorant men. Their disciples must be as little
enlightened as they were, to admit the fables and reveries they
have received from them. It has always been remarked that the

There is a vast difference between knowing and believ-
ing; and yet it must be confessed that with the excep-
tion of that famous old personage, the devil, faith is the
best working tool in the shop of every priest, for by it
he secures a blind obedience, but without the former he
can do nothing whatever; indeed they are mutually
necessary to each other, for the devil can do nothing
without the church, because his dominion and power
are ever most extensive when the theologians succeed
in preventing all freedom of inquiry and discussion,
which they will do while their numbers are multi-
plied everywhere, and their power enlarged even to the
use of the temporal sword. Let them therefore lay
aside the folly of pretending to weaken or destroy his
Satanic Majesty, whether his existence be real or imagi-
most enlightened men seldom make the best Christians,-science is
apt to embarrass faith. If science be serviceable to political society,
ignorance is much more so to revealed religion and its ministers.
Those ages destitute of science and industry, were the golden ages
of the Christian church. Then were kings dutifully submissive to
priests: then the coffers of priests held all the riches ofsociety. The
ministers of a very numerous sect have kept from the eyes of their
followers the sacred pages which contain the laws of their religion.
This conduct is undoubtedly very discreet; for reading the bible
is the surest of all means to prevent its being respected. If in
fact, the maxicfis of the Christian religion respecting science were
rigorously and universally followed, no political society could

nary, since it is evident that their own interest is mainly
promoted by increasing his name and power; and with
respect to himself, he may rest assured that he would
cut but a sorry figure in the world were it not for the
church.*
The belief in miracles is nearly related to the detes-
table folly of crediting the foul accusations for witchcraft"
and in the darker ages, when the church had more
power, the 5y were commonly the c~f pr~ers
of the prosecutions against the unhappy and helpless
creatures who were charged with this imaginary crime,
the executions of whom cannot be looked upon as any-
thing else than so many murders; and all good men
who endeavoured to expose them as such were branded
by the church as Atheists; but these, unhappily, being
very few in number, were quite unequal to the task of
wresting out of the priests' hands the power of taking
away so many innocent people's lives and reputations.

in life to consist in the practice of virtue, and freedom
from superstition; and on the contrary, the greatest
misery in life to consist in being vicious, and believing
in supernaturals. Another great mind amongst the an-
cients describes superstition as a terrible evil, arising
from education, or the natural weakness of the human
mind, oppressing nearly the whole of mankind. If you
give way to it, says he, it will ever haunt and plague
you: all the tranquillity of the mind will be destroyed;
and sleep itself, which seems to be an asylum and refuge
from all trouble and uneasiness, does by the phantoms of
superstition increase your troubles and fears. From all
which evils you can alone be freed by following that
plain, consistent, and rational system of religion, which
is obvious in the book of nature, and whose basis is
truth and morality : all other systems give ri~e to those
vicious passions which spring from the clouds of error
and falsehood.
In what are called the schools of divinity, youth
LEARNS to believe in the manner that suits the theolo-
gian; but the man of unbiased reflection believes that
only which appears to him true, and cannot believe
otherwise; therefore, belief cannot be a duty, and the
attempt to make it even meritorious, or the want of it
criminal, is a downright mark of imposture; for truth

requires only a reasonable conviction, not a blind obedi-
ence. But if miracles wete formerly performed for the
purpose of converting mankind, and supposing that all
the believing part of the world had turned infidels, as
the consequence of their having ceased, yet not a single
sensible miracle could now be produced to re-save the
world, or what is more to Christian priests, to save their
livings and dignities. That the majority of the educated
in society are still priest-ridden is perfectly evident,
yet such a fable as the New Testament story of the
~ a~d t~e s~~ would not in these days be ven-
tured upon ; and if the same crime had been laid
to the charge of Mahomet in terms so ill judged as to
confess such atrocious iniquity, he would have been

of a detachment consisting of that number. The treaty being con-
cluded, the devils took possession of their new subjects accord-
ingly, who, feeling a most devilish commotion within them, com-
mitted suicide immediately : nor was this rash act wonderful when

munity, and palmed by the priests upon the wicked and
worthless emperors, after their apostacy from the religion
of their forefathers; and when policy compelled them to
adopt the nonsense and foolish bigotry of the people, in
order to keep them the better in subjection.
To rectify abuses that have kept their ground for so
many centuries, and remove such a host of prejudices so
long instilled by habit and education, is now become ex-
ceedipgly difficult; for, besides private interest, pride,
passion, and obstinacy, stand as bulwarks in their de-

fanatical hatred,* \yhich of all others is the most deadly,

as forming an ignis-fatuus to lead the world to perdi-

In former times, when ignorance was more prevalent
than it now is, it was b1

almighty power denounced his anger by means of
miracle, and other marvellous phenomena, but in these
times all such appearances are known, even to demon-
stration, to be common effects of natural causes, de-

with this favourite notion, he wants no proof of that
which he wishes to believe ; and we know of no demon-
stration that is strong enough to prove the falsehood of
a favourite opinion. But the most monstrous of all the
miracles that knavery has devised, and folly sanctioned,
is perhaps the Jewish one, of the ~tio~ of ~~tter
out of nothing, a proposition so unsightly and enormous,
that the rational mind rejects it at once, as the ravings
of insanity; but on the other hand, the reflecting mind
has no difficulty in the simple idea of the eternity of
matter; even the theologian himself must agree that it
would require one of his miracles to annihilate a single
atom of matter, yet he will maintain that a being which
he describes as an immaterial existence, without extent,
drew from its own source tl1e thousands of globes which
we behold, and which source is declared to be NOTHING.
This is arriving at the acme of absurdity, through the
wanderings of a distempered fancy, for it is beyond the
grasp of human intellect to conceive any distinct idea of
such a being;; but when the light of nature and reason
are discarded, faith and miracle come readily into play.
In thus setting aside all miracle and all prodigy, as the
...__
inventions of knavery to impose upon weak and credu-
lous minds, it may be asked, " Do you then, when you
fully allow that there is an omnipotent power which
ON l\IIRACLES. 15
rules everytl1ing, deny that it has the power to work
miracles if necessary?" The answer is, that it never
can be necessary, or even possible for that power to vio-
late its own modes of action, or those laws by which it
necessarily operates: this would be inconsistency with
itself, which is utterly impossible. But in this matter,
as in everything else, the pride and folly of man will not
allow him to refrain from measuring the supre1:lle all-in-
all by the scale of human conception ; and being in the
constant habit of violating the laws which he has made
in society, he attributes the same frailties and passions
to his deity. The same infatuation, infused by false
education, has made him believe that he himself was
produced at first by a miracle ; but to talk of the first
man is as silly and unphilosophical as it would be to talk
about the first blade of grass, the first elephant, the first
worm, or the first fish. These animals, and this blade
of grass, are so many natural productions of the surface
of this globe, and man himself, with all his pretensions,
is nothing else: and should superstition, war, and pesti-
lence, those perpetual scourges of the earth, remove en-
tirely by one fell sweep the whole of the human race
from the face of the earth, the sun would still give his
light, day and night would succeed each other, rain would
fall, rivers would run, and woods would grow, in the same
16 LECTUllE I.
manner as if nothing had happened to this pretended
favourite of heaven.
If man would get rid of such follies (with which his
miseries are nearly connected), and arrive at that happi-
ness of which his natural organization is capable, it is
sufficient that he wills it, by removing those obstruc-
tions by which his mind is enslaved; and this he must
owe wholly to himself,-to his own free exertions in
finding out what human existence really is; and a
knowledge of his true wants, and proper manner of
life, will necessarily follow; but this useful knowledge
never can be derived from the vain and shadowy study
of imaginary beings, with their supposed train of super-
natural actions, but from the study of the physical and
intellectual powers displayed in nature hers.elf, in which
there is no deception. The idea of a miracle being
indisputably contrary to the course of nature, and of
all experience, the question arises, who can really in his
mind believe or consent to anything that is so flatly
opposed to his reason ? for denying a thing with a man's
heart is nothing else than the gain-saying and dissent
of a man's reason ;~yet men will subject that excellent
and unerring light to the dead letter of ~jJ_gok, which
l1as been varied, corrupted, and misinterpreted in thou-
sands of different ways, to suit human passions and

the Shaster, the scriptures of the Persees, called the
Zundavastaw; or those of the Bonzes of China, which
t~ey say were written by Fo-He, whom they call
God, and Saviour of the world, by giving satiifaction
for the sins of men. \Ve have also the scriptures of
Sommonocodom, whom the Talapoins of Siam say
was born ef a virgin,* and was the God expected by
the universe.
" The story of what is called the miraculous conception, can
be accounted for in a very easy and natural way. " According to
the apocryphal Gospel of the Nativity of Mary, which father Jerome
Xavier entirely adopts, Mary, when a child, was consecrated to
the Lord, by the usual vow, and was brought up in the Temple,
which she did not leave until she was sixteen years of age. This
naturally created a suspicion that her pregnancy was the effect of
some intrigue of the priests, who made her believe, or say, that
it was God who had begotten a child upon her."-Code~ ApocrJJph:
N.T.
The high priest himself was, in all probability, the chief actor
in this sacerdotal intrigue, for he anxiously pitched upon ~
~
..!!. to be the husband of Mary; and St Epiphanius assures us
in his book of 'Heresie,' that Joseph was very old at the time of
his marriage with the Virgin; and adds, that he was the father of
six children by his first wife. And, moreover, the Gospel ascdbed
to St James the Younger, declares that the good old man espoused

Let us call to mind how many juggling tricks of
heathen and popish priests are recorded in history for
miracles, and numerous other impositions for the
wonderful works of their gods and saints; but are they
capable of the same evidence as other historical facts ?
How easy it is for the pious mind (especially in females) /
to be induced to believe the most notorious frauds that
have the face of piety, and seem done to promote it !
But prophecies and miracles have no foundation in
God or nature, and consequently none in truth ; but
are created wholly in the imaginations of men, to
answer the purposes of fraud, 2r arise from the false
ideas that men have of the supreme power, the false
gods they have imagined and set up, which strike
profound awe and terror into the distorted conceptions
of their abject supplicants.

when he found that his wife had been pregnant before their
marriage, and the reproaches with which he loaded her, on ac-
count of her lewdness, unworthy, as he thought, of a virgin
reared nndcr the eyes of the priests. Mary, as is usual ir1 such
cases, "excused herself, with tears and protestations, and swore by
the living God, that she did not know who begot the child upon
her;" which might indeed be true, if there was a sacerdotal co~
partnership in the business. " It appears that in her distress, she
even forgot the adventure of the ar~h-angel Gabriel."

The votaries of superstitious folly tell us that our
reason is blinded and lost, so as in nowise to be trusted
as a guide, and at the same tirne they declare that it
is abominable wickedness to suspect tlie letter and
authenticity of those books already alluded to, and
which they pretend to idolize, as being heaven-
descended. They account it great piety in a man not to
trust his reaeon and judgment, but perverse wickedness
to doubt the fidelity of those who compiled, and caused
to be adopted as the word of God, the dissonant
volumes in question. If the host of miracles that are
related in the said books, called scriptures, are, as
priests tell us they are, so many appeals to our reason
and senses, for the truth and authority of the heavenly
commission of those by whom ~hey are said to have
been wrought, then we say, let them be tried at the
same tribunal of our reason and senses; and if they
cannot abide the test thereof, let them be rejected, and
their authorities along with them; for the liberty of
thinking, writing, and judging for ourselves in religion,
is a natural, and even a Protestant right, for the pre-
servation ?f which we ought to be incessantly on our
guard; otherwise our understandings, as well as our
purses, will be ridden and oppressed by a designing
and tyrannical priesthood.

Nothing that is rational and consistent can be under-
stood from what are called the ' commands of God,'
except the concatenation of natural causes and things ;
and by his decrees nothing else is meant than the
universal laws of nature, or eternal verity and necessity,
which are one and the same thing; and, therefore, the
more we know of natural things, the more we have
acquired of the knowledge of the supreme power ; and
to be able to account fo! effects by knowing their causes,
is to know so much of the immutable essence of that
power. When the ancient philosophers said that such
a thing was done by a god, or the gods, they were .
only using words suited to the capacity of the vulgar,
and their meaning was that the tl1ing was done ac-
cording to the invariable and eternal rules of nature;
and not, as the ignorant imagine, that nature was idle,
or her laws interrupt~d or suspended.
There is nothing more improbable than that the
reformer, who is a follower of nature, and a moralist,
and whose endeav?ur it is to expose the arts of theolo-
gians, should have any pretensions to preternatural
powers ; and, therefore, there is no reason to believe
that the reputed founder of the christian religion, either
wrought, or pretended to work miracles; but as soon as
that system, to which his name has been affixed, began
ON l\llltA CLES. 21
to have a hireling priesthood, then were miracles
attributed to him in abundance; and that they have
been believed through these latter ages of the church,
is not at all wonderful: the priest had his interest in
them ; the ignorant and superstitious had a comfort m
them, and the wise and considerate, from the fear of
persecution,- dared not to inquire into their foundation,
however marvellous and absurd; although they appeared
to them the most manifest and the most self-evident
impostures that were ever put upon the world, yet they
have been successfol in passing through many ages and
nations, with a reputation that is perfectly wonderful;
and all by mere dint of the zealous exertions, and over-
powering influence of that privileged body of men,
whose interest will still be the same and indivisible in
every part of the world, and whose cunning and well
adapted oratory tickles the ears, whilst it warps the
understandings of the million, stupifying their minds
with dogmas and doctrines about faith and mystery,
which are past all understanding.* Thus has truth been
• The fil'st of the christian virtues is faith ;-it consists in an
IMPOSSIBLE coNVICTION of the revealed doctrines, and absurd
fables, which our relii;ion commands its disciples to believe.
Hence it appears, that this virtue exacts a total renunciation of

submission to the authority of priests, who are the only guarantees

debased and degraded by faith,-a faith that has made
men mad, exciting the nearest relations to hate,
persecute, and even to destroy each other.
In addition to the invention of miracles, the compilers
ofthe Jewish Scriptures have also ascribed to the Supreme
B~ing the most downright inconsistencies and contra-
dictions, and those who maintain that the bible con-
tains no such direct imputations, assert what is not true,
for of this there are numerous instances; but for the
sake of brevity we shall notice only the two following in
Deuteronomy, chap. 4th and verse 24th. Moses, or
some person for him, expressly declares that God is a
consuming fire, although he had directly before, in the
of the truth of the doctrines and miracles that every christian
must believe, under the penalty of damnation. It forbids all doubt
and inquiry; it reduces man to the passive acquiescence of brutes,
in matters which he is, at the same time, told are of all things the
most important to his eternal happiness. Hence it is plain, that
faith is a virtue invented by men, who, shrinking from the light of
reason, deceived their fellow creatures, in order to subject them to
their own authority. If faith be a virtue, it is c&rtainly useful
~ to the spi~itual g'!Ld_es7the chris.Qans, for they alone ;ther
its fruits. They represent this reason as perverted, and an un-
faithful guide, by which they seem to intimate that it was not
intended for reasonable beings. What grounds then has the
christian for entertaining such a belief?-His confidence in his
spiritual guides. But what is the foundation of this confidence?-
Revelation. On what then is revelation itself founded ?-On the
authority of spiritual guides ! !-Boulange1·.

12th verse of the same chapter, denied that God was
vis~ble, or like any visible thing. In 1st Samuel, 15th
chap. verse 29th, it is directly denied that God ever
repents of his decrees; but Jeremiah, on the contrary,
affirms, in chap. 18th, verse 8th and 10th, that God re-
pents both of the good and evil that he had purposed
and decreed. Besides such abominable contradictions,
the fanatic devoutly accuses the Almighty Power of
crimes that are rarely committed by the worst of men,
such as requiring the sacrifice of the innocent to expiate
the crimes of the guilty.
A miracle, being a pretended fact that is contrary to
nature, admits of no natural evidence, however positively
the f11-ct may be asserted; but anything deserving of the
name of evidence cannot possibly exist, because the fact
in its own nature excludes all evidence; but on the other
hand, the conceptions that any man frames to himself,
agreeably to the course of nature from his own experi-
ence and observation, are not prejudices depending on
his will or imagination, but have their foundation in
sense and reason, which can never contradict the truth
-
of things, and truth requires no man's assent without
conviction. But he that is persuaded to believe any-
thing contrary to the known laws of nature, because
there are things which he never can know, is seduced to

give up his understanding. It is therefore of the highest
importance that men should be on their guard against a
blind and implicit faith,-against believing anything out
of the sight and reach of their reason and judgment; but
on all occasions to assert the right, and even the neces-
sity, of having the unquestionable liberty to think, speak,
and write freely about religion, for the correction of
error and discovery of truth,-to restore the world when
it shall be ripe for it, to the primitive religion of nature,
which, according to Jesus himself, " is the end of the
law and the prophets;" from which expression, together
with a number of others which have been attributed to
liim, it sufficiently appears that the reformation he in-
tended was the establishment of this religion amongst
his countrymen, the wiser part of whom being wearied
out with their old superstitions, and sick of the burden
and bondage of their priests, were ready and willing
to embrace it. Orie of the most ancient fathers of the
church, even Justin Martyr himself, expressly declares
that they wlrn lived according to the '' law of nature,
were true christians." But in process of time the
adulterated church perverted this doctrine of primitive
simplicity, by strange and fraudulent inventions, to
suit the corrupt views of the inveutors, by wl1ich tl1c
minds of the people were suhj ngatcd and entangled

with another and worse yoke of bondage,-the into-
lerable mischiefs of an hireling priesthood; the abolition
of which is indispensable to the happiness of the human
race; for all history makes it plain, that clerical conten-
tions, and the bitter animosities, and wars arising there-
from, have. been the bane of society, and the pest of
nations; causing unnatural strife in families, "making
those of a man's own household his foes."
Would any reflecting person believe that the Span-
iards ever could have been guilty of such monstrous
cruelties and wickedness towards the simple and inno-
cent natives of America, if such horrid butcheries had
not been sanctioned and pompously set forth in the
massacres of the bible, where a blood-thirsty robber,-a
.general of banditti, blasphemously declares that these
crimes were done by command of the Almighty?*
• Proud of the protection of their Jehovah, the Jews marchcc.l
forth to victory; heaven authorized them to commit knavery and
cruelty; religion, united to avidity, rendered them deaf to the cries

the Canaanitish nations, with a barbarity at which every man must
revolt, whose reason is not annihilated by superstition; their fury
destroyed every thing, even infants at the breast, in those cities
whither these monsters carried their victorious arms, by the com-
mands of their God, or his prophets; good faith was violated, jus-
tice outraged, and the most unheard-of cruelties exercised. -

Mystery, miracle, and obscurity, never can be pro-
ductive of virtue and knowledge, because they are the
regions of imposture and ignorance, where reason and
the light of nature are condemned ;-in these dominions
therefore, knaves only reign, and fools alone obey; for
goodness, virtue, and knowledge, are not likely to be
found in such company. The religion that is not natural
is necessarily artificial, and is made up of delusive in-
ventions, the pretended mysteries and inspirations of
impostors ; but truth being within (and not beyond) the
boundaries of nature, needs not the support of inspiration,
which is capable of as many deceptions as any impostor
pleases, while he thrusts out truth to introduce falsehood
in its room; sanctifying the greatest enormities as the
will and wisdom of God, demolishing virtue, dethroning
reason and setting up the most unnatural barbarities for
the worship of the supreme power. This inspiration has
also given birth to all saintly villainy, to religious lies,
and lying wonders, made way for everything that is
impious and false ; for all that is scandalous of Almighty
power, and pernicious to man.
In all the systems of religion that pretend to revela-
tion (that is, all those of art), mystery is only another
word for fraud; yet, in the hands of dexterous spiritual
craftsmen, it becomes a formidable auxiliary, accounting

experience, and claiming its full share of credit.with any
of the other religious dogmas, the disbelief of which
consigns man to eternal perdition ; but he who may be
so easily damned out of his reason, may be damned into
any belief or opinion ; for nothing can be too monstrous
for his pliable timidity, or too shocking to his easy
credulity, if the terrors of damnation are properly held
over him. In this manner are the light of nature and
human judgment thrown down, and the authority of the
priest set up in their place, and that authority must not
be examined by reason, for if it be, reason will throw it
down by a single fl.ash of her torch. vVhen all these
things are duly considered, there arises a conviction that
..
every hypothesis that is not founded in nature is absurd,
and therefore cannot be the object of rational belief;-

for nature is as it ever has been, and is ever likely to
continue ; so the only true religion can have no other
foundation than nature, which never deceives; and tl1e

cannot be less evident than nature's laws.

perceived in their religion circumstances conformable to, and which
gave rise to those adopted in Christianity. They had miracles,
oracles, and predictions:· their mythology exhibited gods dethroned
and replacing one another : there we see gods persecuted, exiled,
and put to death ; an Osiris killed by Typhon, and raised again
from the dead; an Apollo expelled from heaven; and especially we
find many points of conformity between Esculapius and Jesus
Christ. The heathen god was son of Apollo and the maid (or
virgin) Boebias; and, like Jesus, performed a great number of
miraculous cures; he was punished and thunderstruck by Jupiter,
for having raised the dead and restored them to a better life. After
his death, he too went and rejoined the god his father.

Hercules, (according to Varro, there were no less than forty-four
Herculeses) as the Jews relate of Samson in the boo!{ of Judges;

that the Jewish Samson was only an imitation of the Phrenician

in place of Deucalion, which suited his purpose. The
Chaldeans, either admitting the Grecian floods, or
claiming the honor of having one of their own, from
some great overflowing of the Euphrates, called their
pilot hy the name of Noe, a name no doubt familiar
to the Jews when they were slaves to the Babylonians,
and hence their name of Noah, which is nearlj the

The miracle of the hermaphrodite created in Genesis,

sexes, but to be purely feminine (c. 2, v. 22), which
was no doubt more agreeable to our first parent, as it

of the accounts to prefer, has very foolishly mingled them together,
yet still leaving the two creations we find in Genesis. In chapter 1,
God (in the original it is in the plural, Elohim, or the Gods) is said
to have created man out of nothing; and on this fi~7t creati~n there
were no restrictions whatsoever imposed upon them as to what
they should eat. ' Behold,' said God, ' I have given you every
herb bearing seed upon earth, and all trees which have in them seed
according to their kind, that it may be to you for food.' But to
Adam of the second creation (chapter 2) God said, ' Thou mayest
eat of every tree in the garden; but of the tree of knowledge of
good and evil thou shalt not eat, for in the day thou eatest of it thou
shalt die the death.' In the first creation, man and woman were
formed out of nothing at the same moment, male and female, or
an individual possessing both sexes; which, probably, was found not
to answer; and therefore, in the second creation, God said, ' Let
us make a helper like unto himself;' and to effect this, God sent a
deep sleep upon Adam, and while he slept God took one of his ribs,
and closed up its place with flesh, and of this rib a companion was
made for this secondfirst man, who was called Adam, which signifies
clay, or red earth.

Nearly all of the above are so many instances wherein
the Jewish compilers of the Pentateuch have copied
from the mythological fables, or the traditions of paga-
nism; and it is very remarkable that, whatever might be
the nature of the story or legend thus imitated, these
compilers have never failed to render that which in the
original was lively and amusing, into what is now
deformed and hideous, in a manner that is perfectly
characteristic of their own semi-savage condition. The
story of Joseph may be quoted as an exception to the
above observation; and it is truly strange that we should
have it through them in such affecting simplicity; but
the impartial amongst the learned are agreed that it cer-
tainly is not Jewish, and that in the Pentateuch it is
given almost literally as it stands in the Arabian original;
but they say that the same justice has not been done to
the book of Job, taken from the Arabian also.
All our divines who call themselves orthodox seem to
agree in declaring that God is infinite ; and yet they
assert, at the same time, that there are other beings and
existences besides him whom they have asserted to be
infinite, which appears to be a contradiction in terms;
but the wiser sort of the ancient pagans reasoned witJ1

much more consistency when they maintained that God
made all things of nothing-but himself, whom they held
to be infinite, and therefore their denial of the existence
of any other thing besides him necessarily followed ; for,
said they, if anything else besides him exists, he cannot
be infinite, but only co-existent with other things.

There is a famous ~amongst the Mahometans in
Turkey, noted for their wisdom and strong reasoning
powers, who maintain that " the great power never has,
and never can discover itself, with any certainty, in any
other way than by speaking to the reason and under-
standing of men; for if we depend, say they, on oral
tradition, we lay ourselves open to the greatest falsities
and impositions, there being nothing so liable to endless
changes and alterations. Numberless mistakes, additions,

and subtractions, according as men's opinions vary by
the change of times and circumstances. Nor are books
more exempt from such doubtfulness and uncertainty ;
since we find so much disagreement and contradiction
among books written by different men, in different coun-
tries, and in different ages, and even among the varying
books written by the same men. The only sure way
then, say they, is to consult reason, as it comes from
nature,* or God; live just ancl honE-st lives; be kind and
beneficent to our fellow creatures."
All attempts to set aside, or to render the laws of
nature useless and ineffectual, are in the highest degree
pernicious to man, and a supernatural religion is the
main-spring of all such evils ; for that religion only can
be true which is reasonable and convincing to all men;
and if it be not generally held, that is a proof that it is
not convincing. But how few people there are in a
nation who take the pains to consider the bottom of any
religion!! Whatever is established will attract the

if found inconsistent with natural religion, and with
eternal reason-whicl1, being the offspring of truth, never

free ourselves from those absurdities which the folly or
the knavery of men has introduced, in opposition to the
only unerring guides of human conduct.
"For zeal, fanatic zeal, once wedded fast
To some dear falsehood, hugs it to the last."
"The Athenians of old, even long before the time of
Solon, had a prophetic and mysterious book, called in
their language the Testament, on which they pretended
the safety of the republic depended. This work of
darkness appears to have been of the same nature as the
books of the sybils at Rome, to which also the destiny
of the nation was attached, at least so pretended the
· priests and pontiffs of both nations, and the more such
gross impostures ·were impressed on the minds of their
victims, the people, the more easily did the politicians
and theologians united, gain their objects. Yet the1·e
MIRACLES AND OTHEH SUPERNATURALS. 41
was this difference, that, according to Roman history,
the books of the sybils were always produced, while at
Athens the Testament was buried in the same artful
silence as the mysteries of Ceres or Eleusis. Dicearchus
mentions this Testament in his harangue against De-
mosthenes, whom he accuses of having failed in respect
towards this ineffable volume, which contained, as the
learned say, nothing but a collection of pretended mira-
cles and predictions by two noted Grecian impostors,
named Bacis and Antiphylus."
If such books, instead of being veiled with impene-
/ trable clouds, had been examined by the rules of criticism,
it would have appeared that the sybilline books of Rome
were only an imitation of the Athenian Testament, fitted
up to suit the paganism of the Latins.
" The most dangerous superstitions of the Greeks
were precisely those which brought money both to the
priests and to the states; for the Athenians protected the
mysteries of Ceres and of Eleusis, for no other reason
than because they had a moiety of the profits from the
hierophants, or priests. When Diagoras of Melos
afterwards maintained openly that those ceremonies were
contrary to virtue, and corrupted the manners of the
Greeks, no person could, nor even endeavoured to
confute him ; but the priests secretly offered an attic

talent to whoever would take away his life." "Such was
to be the reward of Diagoras; for even in those days the
theologists reasoned with poniards and burning fagots,
instead of the ordinary rules of logic, which they con-
fessed were not made for them."
There is nothing more to be feared than the plain
fact, that the hireling priests in all religions cannot
possibly have an interest in leading men to opinions that
are true, but to such opinions only as they have enlisted
themselves to profess; and he that believes and vindicates
things that are false, in as much as they are contrary to
nature and reason, is an enemy to truth. He that
believes and justifies what is dishonourable to God,
and pernicious to reason and right action, embraces
impious and unjust principles, and when these are put
into practice he is unrighteous in fact. Nor should we
stifle in silence the truths we have discovered, for we
must either vindicate the liberty of truth, or submit to
the slavery of error; and believing without seeing, that
is, without evidence, is nonsense and absurdity. But, on
the contrary, [~tics see nothing but what is invisible,
and believe nothing but what is incredible.
Deists and other lovers of truth think it reasonable
that, as those histories containing relations of miracles

much more incredible things than other histories, they
ought to bring with them more substantial proofs than
other histories, to confirm the truth of such prodig.ies
as they relate, or else, that every relation in them which
is not as probable as other true liistory, should stand for
nought: for why should we (say they) believe on the
bare report of unknown reporters, things naturally im-
possible, or out of the range of experience, because they
are generally believed by those who never made any
inquiry?* Many believers have no disposition, others no
capacity to examine rightly ;-besides when creeds and
principles are fixed by authority as being the only right
and allow·able, it discourages. all examination ; and
throughout all the systems of pretended revelation, they
are fixed and established for that end alone, lest men
should see differently from those who mislead them.

foundation in nature and reason, are necessary parts of
religion; and the histories of all churches exhibit con-
tinued scenes of villany for upholding such inventions;
and truth, with all her willingness to come to light, is
kept in the back ground; for the more that a man is en-
dowed with good sense, natural piety' and virtue, the
more he is secretly hated as a dangerous enemy to the "
priestly order.
The universality of superstition is owned and confir-
med in effect, by each distinct sect, in declaring that it
has crept into all other sects, (~.£._wn always excepte<!_),
the respective teachers of whom find their interest in
promoting it. Nor is it possible to be otherwise, so long
as men are taught to build, their religion upon an
artificial, and less extended foundation than that on
which religion has been laid by the Universal Being of
nature. And to suppose any thing can be true from
revelation that is evidently false by reason, is to under-
mine the revelation of nature ; because nothing unreas-
onable, nay, which is not highly reasonable, can come
from that all ruling power of eternal reason.

the times of ignorance and fana~icism will return, when
the ghastly incubus of false zeal shall again brood over the
grovelling laity, stifling every natural conception of their
minds, as being the suggestions of the devil; particularly
if they clash with the interests, the real or pretended
opinions of their priests.
No system of revealed religion ever was, nor ever can
be made known to all men, therefore no revealed re-
ligion can be necessary; for a rule that is not generally
known cannot be generally obeyed; and since all the~e
superstitions differ widely from, and are indeed opposed
to each other, and you cannot prove one of them to be
truer than the rest before you can prove that one of
them is true: all of them ha,·e had similar mysteries
and miracles, and if such things are sacred only because
they are secret, expose them, and the witchcraft is at an
end, the spell is broken, and the charm has lost its force ;
it is but varnish that appears, and nothing of the splendid
pomp remains but slireds and rottenness. The more
intrinsic worth a thing has, the better will it bear investi-
gation; but fraud and its usual saintly train are the
fruits and friends of darkness; so the religion that will
not bear examination is the kingdom of darkness,
whereas truth, if not prevented, will always court the
light that it may be manifest. But it is not intended to

be seen wherever mystery and miracle are resorted to,-
like wisdom, it delights to appear in public, it loves
freedom, openness, and plain dealing; but the mansion
of mystery is the pride of ignorance, the delusion of
madmen and fools, where enthusiasm is born, and the
prophetic visions of future events are brought forth,-
where bigots and fanatics are trained,-where the voice
of reason is stopt, and inquiry is confounded,-and
where superstition, like fire, resolves everything into
itself.*

• A mysterious and unintelligible tone is essentially necessary to
the ministers of all religions. A clear intelligible religion, without
mystery, would appear less divine to the generality of men, and
would be less useful to the sacerdotal order, whose interest it ·is
that the people should comprehend nothing of that which they
believe to be the most important to them: here is without doubt
the secret of the clergy. The priest must have a metaphysical and
incomprehensible Deity, whom he makes speak and act in an
unintelligible manner, reserving to himself the right of explaining
to mortals his pleasure in his own manner, while the people, who in
general wish to have their imaginations pleased rather than their
understandings instructed, give a preference to a god that is most
concealed, most mysterious, and most unknown. Hence the

knew that the only thing necessary to be known in
regard to God and religion, is principally that of their
duty towards each other, in their different stations in life,
they would not be so easily deceived, and deterred from
exercising their reasoning faculties by theological terrors,
which inculcate the fear of death, owing, as it is said, to
the dubious fate of the vital spark afterwards; for the
assertions of divines about a very small number of souls

of others in infernal agonies,* is as hard to prove as the

fields ofpagan mythology. The more rational belief, there-
fore is, that as thought and sensibility are the consequence
of a particular organization of a portion of matter, it
follows that when that organization ceases, the conjunction
of those parts is dissolved, and the MAN is no more; the
vital part, or what is called the soul, being the requisite
compound of air and fire, which rejoin their own elements,

which composed his body and mind are eternal. This

naturals? The idle fears of eternal punishments would
fall into the ridicule they deserve; the assuming arro-
gance of the mystagogues of the church would be laid
low with all their pageantry and ceremonies, and men
would have veneration only for truth and wisdom, with
the moral virtues in their train ; and as they no longer
imbibed those mischievous principles which have never
failed to set the world at variance, so no fiery persecuting
zeal would be required for their maintenance ; and the
harmony of good will and social virtue would unite
men peacefully in society.
It is true, that in these latter enlightened ages, the
church has not been able to maintain its absurd pre-
tensions to miracles: but that does not hinder the priests
from still upholding the reality of those of antiquity,
with the use of which, together with their other
machinery of inspiration, mystery, and prophesy, they
are enabled to carry on their trade in as flourishing a
manner as ever it was at any former period; but tlie
dreadful charge of supporting such numbers of men as
are now in pay to maintain impositions, is a cruel burden

time of christianity ; for the revenues now belonging to
the different orders of priests, monks, and friars, in
popish countries, and the dignitaries of our own church,
are a greater tax on labouring man, and have introduced
a greater degree of poverty, than has ever been oc-
casioned by any lay-tyrants, or conquerors : for the
latter have been contented with temporary plunder only,
without concerning themselves how to find out ways and
means to prey upon mankind for ever. The charge
alone, therefore, of supporting so vast a number of
ecclesiastics, is a great and melancholy evil in society,
even if they were employed in the most innocent
manner, in mere eating and drinking; but this, un-
happily, is not the case, for as the peace and good order
of human society consist in the practice of moral duties,
every diversion of the mind from this proper object, to
other concerns of a hurtful tendency, or at least, of no
practical utility, must abate men's zeal in the observance
unbearded divinities. We have reduced that establishment
to three only; but nevertheless, and unaccountable as it may
appear, it has been so contrived by our modern hierophants, that
on earth the service of these three, together ~ith their train of
deputies and saints, holy-days, &c., has entailed upon human
industry a tax of an hundred times the amonnt per annum of that

prejudice the peace and general good of society.
Ambition, political tyranny, revenge, and covetous·
ness, have in all ages more or less plagued the world,
and been the source of great disorders ; but a blind
zeal to impose preternatural speculations has not only
had the same effects as these evils, but has carried men
to a pitch of wickedness, which otherwise, " eye had
not seen, nor ear heard, nor had entered into the heart
of man to conceive ;" for what ancient or modern
history can parallel the malign brutality of religious
fanatics ? The most irregular of our passions decay .
with time, and their mischievous effects are restrained
by common sense, and the policy of society ; and there
are in us some good passions, or natural feelings of the
heart, such as compassion, good nature, and humanity,
which when left free, serve tolerably well to equilibrate
I
human conduct ; but that furious zeal which flows from
religious systems of pretended revelation, gathers
strength with time, bears•·down all those rational and
useful lessons which we derive from the light of nature,
overleaping the bounds of the material and animal world,
and subduing all the tender passions.

reason has perhaps had the most powerful adversary in
the invention of heavenly inspiration, for it is ever in
readiness as a salvo, to smooth down, and account for
whatever is rejected by reason and experience, however
absurd or unsightly : and upon it also is artfully founded
all legitimate authority against human understanding,
simply on its being asserted, (by whom, where, or when,
we know not) that there have been some men so divinely
taught of God, that to question their fidelity, or
doubt their veracity, or not indubitably to receive their
tales, is, they say, to call to account God himself,
because their affirmations are stamped with what they
declare to be the divine impression; thus their delusions
are sanctioned, and hence arises the power of the church
to overawe men into a prescribed belief, without daring
to make any inquiry; but let men only learn to treat
the grave malediction of the priest, when lie denounces
damnation, in the way that it deserves, that is, with
perfect scorn and contempt; then, and then only, will
the honest world begin to see that they have as much
right to judge of these matters as of anything else.

ever proceed from that fountain of perfect consistency
and rectitude, which never can give birth to contention,
or plans of imperious ambition, for the subjugation of
the human mind. But, on the other hand, christianity
is now become a trade of gain, (godliness is a great
gain, saith the scripture),* a regular scheme of dominion,
and a school of contention ; the pure and simple system
which its reputed founder taught, is now the severest
satire in the world against the priestcraft of the present
day.. It is true, that in these times the church cannot
so easily indulge its propensity to set fire to people,
as it did in former ages, but if Jesus had, by means of
a- miracle similar to some of those ascribed to him,
revisited the earth about the fourteenth century of his
own era, and preached the same system of nature that
he formerly did, he would most assuredly have been put
to death ; but previous to a second catastrophe in this
way, we may suppose some catholic priest, with more
good nature and humanity, than is common in the order,
to have addressed him in this manner:-" My good

friend, you cannot but remember that your countrymen,
the Jews, crucified you for exposing the folly of their
superstitions and idle ceremonies, and that the mild and
tolerant government of the Romans could not save you;
but if on this occasion you will listen to good advice,
you may make your fortune, and be no longer under
the necessity of working as a carpenter, or in danger
from violence a second time ; for know that of your
scheme of natural religion and good morals, not a single
vestige remains, save the name alone; but upon that
name, we have contrived to raise the most ambitious
system of grandeur, riches, power, and dominion, that
was ever devised by the bead of man ; and with a degree
of success at which you will be astonished, when I tell
you, that we have done all this merely by reversing tlie
principles which you strove to establish : for you judged
too favourably of human nature, when you supposed
that the simple religion of deism, together with govern-
ments founded upon principles of pure ethics, would
serve to guide the great mass of mankind ; and the
strongest proof of your ignorance appears in our having
established a system, by strictly inverting every principle
of yours; only by calling in to our aid as much machinery
from the Pagan mythology, as suited our purpose; such
as mystery, miracle, and prophesy, using all our art

to foster as much ignorance as possible, that being
an indispensable ingredient in our mixture ; and to
strengthen the above, we add the terrors of eternal
perdition to all who oppose, or do not believe us.
These are the only proper nostrums for the bulk of
mankind ; therefore, I say again, be wise for the future,

After this address we may easily conceive what would
be the reply of the virtuous moralist, using his former
words,-" 0 ye generation of vipers, ye have made use
of my name to enslave the human mind, which I en-
deavoured to set free. I reverenced nature, truth, and
reason, as mypole-stars, in everything; ye have subverted
these unerring guides to the utmost of your power, and
on the ruins thereof have ye raised the empire of hypo-
crisy and superstitious delusion ye have just described !
And being thus arrived at the highest summit of human
grandeur and power, wallowing in riches and luxury,
maintained by the earnings of the industrious but credu-
lous people, ye have held over their weak minds the
terrors of an imaginary futurity which I never taught,
grossly deceiving and abusing them in my name, im-
piously ascribing to me, at the same time, miracles and
other prodigies which I never wrought, and which are

equally false and abhorrent in the ways of the almighty
power. "Ye are not my followers, but the followers of
that wild and inconsistent visionary Saul, or Paul, who
in my name taught unintelligible dogmas, and absurd
reveries about my deification, and upon which false foun-
dation ye have raised your present boasted edifice of
superstitious grandeur. I taught my followers to be
like sheep among wolves, but ye .are wolves among
sheep."
In descending from the miracles of antiquity, down to
those attributed to the early Christians, we are told by
Lucian, Celsus, Julian, and others, that these seeming
prodigies were performed by crafty jugglers, expert at
their trade,-miracle-mongers by profession. Celsus
represents all the Christian wonder-workers as mere va-
gabonds and common cheats, "who rambled about to
fairs and markets; not in the circles of the wiser or
better sort, for among such they never ventured to ap-
pear; but where they saw a set of raw young fellows,
slaves, or fools, here they obtruded themselves, and prac-
tised all their arts of deception." Cmcilius calls them a
" lurking nation, shunning the light; mute in public-
prating in corners." The charge of fraud and imposture
was constantly urged against them by their opponents,
and with good reason, as their constant prctensio11 was

to the command of supernatural power. Did they ever
exhibit their miracles amongst the learned, intelligent,
or higher ranks of the people? No. To whom then?
To the lowest classes, to the uninformed, weak, and
ignorant only. What were those miracles? Such only
as might easily be counterfeited, when aided by collu-
sion,--casting out what they called devils, healing the
sick, lame, blind, and causing those to speak who pre-
tend to be dumb.*

their assent? Miracles were introduced to prove things which it is
impossible to believe,-things incredible are here adduced in proof
of incredible things. Almost all impostors who have fabricated reli-
gions, have announced incredibilities to mankind; and they ·have
afterwards fabricated miracles in proof of those incredibilities.
"You cannot (they said) comprehend what I tell you; but I will
clearly prove that I tell the truth, by doing things which you can-
not comprehend." Truth is simple and evident; the marvellous is
ever to be suspected. Nature is always true to herself; she acts
by invarying laws. To say that God performs miracles, is to say
that he contradicts himself, and violates the laws which he has pre-
scribed to nature; it is to say, that he renders useless human

been Saul, alias Paul, of saintly memory, and a whole-
sale manufacturer of miracle, mystery, and quibble. The
most probable account we have of this man is in the
Acts of the Ebionites, who tell us that he was not origi-
nally a Jew, but a Gentile, or Pagan proselyte, whose
itinerant propensities led him to Jerusalem, where he
was employed as a menial servant by Gamaliel, who was
then the high priest of the Jews. Here his active and
overbearing disposition soon distinguished itself in fer-
reting out, and running down, the new sect of Galileans,
or Christians, the better to ingratiate himself with the
high priest, to who$e daughter he had impudence enough
to have pretensions in marriage ; and for that purpose
he submitted to the operation of circumcision. But his
circumcision availed him nothing, and he might well
ask, as he does in Romans, chap. 3rd, verse 1st, "what
profit is there of circumcision ?" for both the young
lady and her father were sadly against the match. Nor
was this aversion on the part of the daughter to be won-
dered at, if we consider the personal description given
of him by Lucian and others, ~iz. that he was bald
headed, short in stature, hook nosed, bandy legged, with
a fierce forbidding look. Thus repulsed in his views of
marriage, he wreaked his revenge on Gamaliel ;-saw

day," left his master the high priest, and went over to
' the Galileans. It is not necessary to say much about
the three varying accounts he gives of himself in the
Acts of the Apostles, but these inconsistent statements
verify the old adage, that those who depart from the
truth ought to have good memories. Having been driven
out of Antioch in Phrygia (Acts, chap. 13th) for his mal-
practices, he proceeded to the town of Iconium (Acts,
chap. 14th) where the fathers say he made a convert of
St Theda, the first female martyr. She had been con-
tracted to Thamirus, a man handsome, rich, noble, and
of the first rank in the city ; but Paul having converted
her, she renounced her marriage to embrace VIRGINITY.
Enraged at this seduction, Thamirus complained thereof
to the Roman pro-consul, Sextilius, who caused the
saint to be scourged, and driven out of the city. From
thence he went to Lystra, where he played one of his
juggling tricks by collusion, causing a cripple to walk;
but being followed by some Jews who had seen his leger-
demain at Antioch and Iconinm, he was detected by
them, and the miracle of the cripple ended in his saint-
ship being cast out of the city, stoned, and left for dead.
Soon after this he returned to Antioch, and here the
fathers tell us he was joined by his convert Theda, who,
as a matter of course, would be abandoned by her rela-
60 LECTURE II.
tions; but with Paul she had no doubt a very proper
asylum for the preservation of her chastity, for where
could it be so safe as in the keeping of a saint? Good
repute is not much cared for, in the wanderings of female
adventurers, especially in those who follow vagrant
preachers. The saint was again flogged at Thyatira,
for his old habit of tampering with the women; and
practising the same sly custom again at Thessalonica, the
same reward was prepared for him, but he was concealed
by his friend Jason, and sent from thence in the night
(Acts 17th, verse 10th) to Bera, or Berea, from which
place he soon absconded likewise, being afraid of another
flogging, leaving behind him in that town his compa-
nions, Silas and Timotheus, who were less obnoxious
than himself, probably from having less of the libido,
dinis, in them. At Ephesus his outrageous conduct
would in all likelihood have cost him his life, and some of
his companions were caught, but he himself escaped into
Macedonia, not choosing to abide the mode of trial that
was recommended by the town clerk. It is certain that
although Paul abounded in miracles to benefit others,
yet the poor fellow could not perform a single one to
save himself, or his companions, even when they stood
most in need of them; nor could he preach himself out
of bonds. In his Second Epistle to the Corinthians
l\IJRACLES AKD OTHER SUPERNATURALS. ul
(chap. 11th) he tells us that the Jews flogged him five
times, and that each time he received thirty-nine lashes;
that lie was thrice beaten with rods, and once stoned,
punishments which were then commonly inflicted on
such turbulent and seditious demagogues. But the asto-
nishing part of the matter is, his success in causing a vast
majority of the Christian world to believe that he never
outraged the peace of society, nor committed any crimes
to deserve those chastisements. He tells us farther, that
he had been "a night and a day in the deep," which
showed a laudable ambition not to be outdone by Jonah
and his whale, but he does not tell us how he found him-
self after such a ducking.* The above are a few sketches
of the true character and conduct of a vagrant, unruly
mystagogue, who, nevertheless, has commanded the faith
and veneration of those called true believers (that is, all
who believe whatever bas been taught them in childhood)
for more than sixteen centuries !!!
After venturing so far to take a peep into the holy of
holies, to examine the great arcan_um of priestcraft, it

may not be improper to digress a little in giving a dis-
section of another special character, which has long been
impiously held up by priests and their ignorant followers,
as being the man according to God's own heart. Now,
the Hebrew historian relates that this man, David, " col-
lected about six hundred vagabonds, overwhelmed with
debts and crimes, and at the head of these banditti, pil-
laged his countrymen. After these robberies he resolved
to destroy Nabal and his whole family, becau~e he refused
to pay contributions to him. He hired out his services
as a mercenary to King Achish, the enemy of his
country, and soon afterwards betrays this Achish, not-
withstanding his kindness to him, which he requites by
sacking the villages in alliance with that king, massacreing
every human being, including even infants at .the breast,
that no one might be found at a future day to give testi-
mony of his depredations; as if an infant could have pos-
sibly disclosed his villany ! Another exploit of his was
to destroy all the inhabitants of some other villages,
under saws, and harrows, and axes, and by burning them
in brick-kilns. His ambition now aspires to the top of
the ladder, and he wrests the throne from Ishbosheth,
the son of Saul, by an act of perfidy, which he follows
up by despoiling of his property, and afterwards putting '
to death, Mephibosheth, the son of Saul, and brother
MIRACLES AND OTHER SUPERNATURALS. 63
ofhis own peculiar friend and generous protector Jona-
than; he has also the horrible wickedness to deliver up
to the Gibeonites, another son of Saul, and five of
his grandsons, who perished by the gallows !!! After
these crimes we need hardly n?tice his numerous concu-
bines, his intrigue with Bathsheba, or the murder of her
husband Uriah.,
"
The veneration in which such characters have long
been, and are still held by folly and ignorance, shows
that superstition is a mad error; it exalts the unworthy
and profligate, it fears those who deserve to be loved,
and it injures whatever it worships: and how, indeed,
can it be expected that the same evil which has in all
ages, and in all countries, been hurtful to truth and true
religion, should in any age become the guardian of
them?
That the church should have particular respect and
veneration for this St Paul, is not at all surprising, since
he has furnished out a greater number of mysterious
nothings, or nonsensical quibbles, than any other of the
contributors to the writing of the New Testament; and
as his Gospel formed an excellent foundation for theolo-
gical power and corruption, it is eminently esteemed ;
whilst that of Barnabas, which seems to have been one /-,
of moral simplicity, has been suppressed, and declared
64 LECTURE. Ir.
to be apocryphal, because it did not favour clerical great-
ness. It is said, however, to be held in respect by the
Mahometans, who, after making such interpolations as
suited their own superstition, found that Mahomet was
expressly the promised pa:aclet, or comforter, there men-
tioned; and that the said Gospel of Barnabas was the
only true one amongst the many hundreds of Gospels,
Epistles, Acts, and Revelations of the Christians.
If Paul was not the first, he certainly must have been
amongst the very first who corrupted and metamorphosed
the system of Jesus from its original principles of natural
lightand simplicity; the strongest proof of which we find
· ! in his quarrels with Barnabas, James and Peter, who
directly charge him with this perversion; and Peter, in
a letter to James, which is quoted by Cotelerius,
and prefixed by him to the Clementines, complains
that his true and legal preaching had been rejected
amongst the Gentiles, "who had embraced the trifling
a11d lawless doctrine of a man who was his enemy."
Now this could allude to no one else than Paul, who
was both the apostle of the Gentiles, and tl1e enemy of
Peter.
That Talmud, which was composed by the Jews of
Mesopotamia, about the fifth century, relates that there
have been many Christians who, after comparing the
MIRACLES AXD OTHER St:F:f.RNATURALS. 65
miracles of the Old Testament with those of the New,
embraced Judaism, considering it impossible that the
Sornreign Lord of nature should have wrought such stu-
pendous prodigies for a religion which he intended to
annihilate. "\Vhat impious. inconsistency ! exclaimed
they, in supposing that the Almighty power should, for a
series of ages, have exhibited a train of the most amazing
miracles in favour of a true religion that was soon to
become a false one~hat, !-he would send his own Son,
...... ../ 1
who is declared to be no other than himself, to make that
untrue and nugatory, which he took so many ages to
erect and establish !
One of the Talmuds makes the Almighty gather toge-
ther his celestial army in the reign of Ahab, and he asks
the spirits, " "\Vho amongst you will go and deceive Ahab,
and persuade him to go up to war against Ramoth
Gilead?" and there C9.me forth a lying spirit, and stood
before the Lord and said, "I will persuade him." Here
we have a lying angel, and God Almighty himself
prompting to a falsehood, or endeavouring to deceive.
The belief of such impious absurdities is alone sufficient
to show that the credulity of man has no bounds what-
ever ; that it is even greater than anything which his
mind can possibly conceive.
In another Lecture it has already been observed, that
F

as the reputed founder of Christianity was a follower of
nature, and a preacher of good morals, it is inconsistent
to suppose that he even believed in miracles ; but on the
contrary, his earnest intention vrns to reclaim his country-
men, the Jews, from all such absurd perversions of rea-
son and common sense. It does not anywhere appear
that he himself wrote anything; and it was not _until
near two hundred years after the time of his death, that
some obscure pretended followers, using his name, pro-
duced the books containing the alleged miracles. And as
the church grew strong in wealth and power, these books
have been altered and interpolated, at the will and plea-
sure of the early fathers, to suit their own, and the general
interests of the church ; for, however strange it may
appear, it is a well-ascertained fact that they were
frequently engaged in altering, remodelling, and fitting
up their GosPELS, that is, settling what should be, and
what shmil.d not be, the word of God ! !! Tithes, and all
other temporal benefits that served to promote the riches
and power of the clergy, always formed part of tlte
word ef God.*

It is recorded by Victor of Tunis, an African bishop,
and the same is also stated by Scaliger, that a general
alteration of the four Gospels took place in the sixth
century, by command of the Emperor Anastasius, as
follows :-"That the holy Gospels, as written, IDIOTIS
EVANGELISTIS, are to be corrected and amended."
1\fahomet expressly declares that he wrought no mira-
cles; but exactly as in the case of Christianity, his less
judicious followers make him work many of a very asto-
nishing description ; and many Christians, prompted by
a false zeal against him, accuse him of boasting of certain
miracles which the Arabian writers never attributed to
him. His accusers even go so far as to say that when
he made his rapid journey to visit all the heavens in a
single night, he was mounted on the mysterious mare
Borak, which he had borrowed from his friend, the arch-
angel Gabriel, (making good the old proverb, that a
borrowed horse goes far), and that he was so ungrateful
as not to return the mare, but kept her for his own
stud.
One error naturally leads to another, and the art of
drawing dogmas, or infallible conclusions from false foun-
dations, which never can be allowed by truth and reason,
has ever been one of the principal strong-holds of theo-
logy, which, in endeavouring to support its favourite
I

assertion of the creation of matter, rushes headlong.into
a greater difficulty, (if that be possible), for having no
material to work with, it is forced into the palpable
absurdity of creating matter out of nothing. The super-
ficial reasoner cries out, " This clock did not make
itself, it liad an artificer, and therefore matter must have
had a creator and artificer also."-" Very true, my
friend, your clock did not always exist as a clock, but
most assuredly the matter of which it is composed did
always exist, and ever will exist in some form or other,
and has undergone thousands of millions of different
modes and states of being, before nature produced the
particular substances of wood and metal of which it is
composed."
One of the fatal errors impressed upon the mind of
man in early youth, is the folly ofmeasuring the Almighty
power, and the endless resources and changes of nature,
by his own poor, weak, and perverted understanding;
always taking a distorted or mistaken view of her com-
mon process in the dissolution, decomposition, and the
separation of the elementary particles of bodies, for the
entire and radical annihilation of them, which, if true,
would indeed be a miracle. Jt is therefore not repug-
nant to reason, or contrary to what appears from experi-
ence to be the universal order of things, to acknowledge
:MIRACLES AND OTHER SUPERNATURALS, 69
that matter is self-existent, self-ruled, and self:.modified
by motion, which is co-eternal with its own nature, and
may be said to be its executive, or energetic power; and
that the annihilation of any part of it, even by its own
power, which cannot be subject to control, is utterly im-
possible; and as there can be no such thing as the
organization or production of animal life without mo-
tion, so is it equally necessary in the death and decom-
position of every creature that has life ; in all which pro-
cess nature is pursuing her own invariable course . of
perpetual change into new modifications of matter; but
utterly denying, by lier immutable laws, that any man,
or other animal that has once been dead in reality, did
ever come to life again, although it is quite in the pro-
cess of nature that dead animals (the dissolution of gross
bodies being wrought by fermentation) should give rise
to other and very different organizations both animal and
vegetable.
A power to work miracles would be superior, and __\..
external to, the universal and immanent laws by which
the systems of things are governed ; and exists nowhere
but in the fantastic imagination of man, being directly
contrary to the attributes of Almig-hty power,-to that
which is the most clear of all others, its uncliangeable-
ness; and the more men are amused with miraculous
70 LECTURE II.
tales, the more will they be diverted from exercising
their reason. But when truth is valued, the rational
faculties will be freely used, and superstition will inevi-
tably sink, with fanaticism its offspring. The more
respect that is paid to anything substituted in the room
of truth and moral righteousness, the less will these he
practised and regarded ; and whenever the resurrection
and prevalence of these shall take place, the death-blow
is given to the false righteousness of faith, and all preter-
natural religions.

The Indian asserts that the Brama himself is the author of his

the Jew and the Christian have received theirs from Jehovah, by
the ministry of Moses and Jesus, the Mahometan affirms that he

all religions pretend to a divine origin, and they all interdict the
use of reason in the examination·of their sacred titles. Each pre-
tends to be the only true one, to the exclusion of all others; and
all acquire the charaeter of falsehood by the palpable contradictions
with which they are filled ; by the misshapen, obscure, and orten
odious ideas, which they give of the Godhead; by the whimsical

make free inquiry into these ma~ters absolutely neces-
sary; and although none of them will be considered as
the messengers of heaven by the few that are wise and
considerate, yet the impostors ought to be detected for
the benefit of the misled many, who either cannot or dare
not think for themselves; for it is equally inconsistent
and ridiculous that we should be required to believe men
the more, for those very reasons upon which common
sense tells us we should believe them the less. Tertul-
lian;speaking of a certain miracle, says, " It is no shame
to own it, because it is a thing to be ashamed of." Again
he says; " It is wholly credible, because it is absurd."
And again, speaking of the same miracle, " It is certain, /
because it is impossible." St Aus!_i!!_said, that "He be-
lieved some things, because they were absurd and impos-
sible." Cicero, that all-accomplished philosopher, though
he was himself an honorary priest, wrote a treatise on
divination, wherein he has exposed and destroyed the
whole revealed religion of the Greeks and Romans, by
showing the imposture of all their miracles and oracles ;
and he records a saying of the wise Cato, the censor,
which shows that he understood the whole fraud and
mystery of the Roman religion as by law established.
72 LECTURE II.
" I wonder," says Cato, "how one of our priests
can forbear laughing when he sees another, at the
thoughts of that fraud they live by;" and liad the
profound Cato lived in the nineteenth century, he
would have made the same observation; for the Chris-
tian priests, as well as those of other religions, do, we
may be well assured, secretly make themselves merry,
when over their cups, at the success of their own
craft, and at the weakness of the people in being so
easily imposed upon, but more especially for the silly
absurdity of maintaining them in luxury as the price of
their fables.
The oracles of antiquity formed another order of su-
pernaturals, and Eusebius takes occasion to triumph in
charging his antagonist Porphyry with being the head
· and advocate for a number of the oracles of Greece,
making part of the heathen religion; but he takes care
to withhold from us the matter which accompanies those
writings of Porphyry, which he quotes; and this omis-
sion alone gives us every reason to believe that the
latter was in reality condemning and exposing oracles,
instead of being an advocate for them. ·However, it is
certain, t11at although all the lower and many persons in
the higher classes amongst the Greeks did consult ora-
MIRACLES AND OTHER SUPERNATURALS. 73
des in their important affairs, yet in the three greatest
schools of philosophy they were treated as the absolute
impostures of priests, and as such they are treated by
Eusebius. But like all other priests, as he could do
nothing without the devil, or some of his subaltern imps,
he assures us that these oracles were delivered by de-
mons. Though lie could not but see clearly that they
were nothing else than cheats, still he would not confess
them to be so, because it served the interest and stabi-
lity of the church, that the devil should have the chief
direction of the oracles, the better to run down and ex-
plode the old religion.
The origin of oracles was like everything else of the
preternatural order, an imposition on the easy credulity
of man; a propensity so notorious in him, that you have
only to persuade a few people that it is not the sun that
causes the appearance of day, and having succeeded in
this, you need not despair of making whole nations em-
brace the same opinion; for let any notion be ever so
monstrous or ridiculous, you have only to maintain it
by authority for a time until it becomes sanctioned
by. antiquity, and then the truth of it is proved suffi-
ciently.
All the false -teligions m the world, or that have

pestered it, have pretended to inspiration, and this
shows very clearly that this sort of revelation is, by the
common consent of mankind, the very best foundation
of supernatural religion, and therefore every impostor
pretends to it; but if we would not suffer ourselves to
be beguiled, we must be strictly on our guard against
deceit, and preserve and protect the moral virtues; for
sincerity, :fidelity, and honesty, are as truly the life and
soul of true religion, as deception and hypocrisy are the
bane of it.
Wicked and designing men, who have conjured up a
power superior to nature and reason, solely for the pur-
pose of destroying both, " have depreciated the true-
born daughter of God, Faithfulness, and anointed the
bastard l<'aith in her room."
In concluding this Lecture, I shall shortly observe that,
since as men we are all liable to error, the above reason-
ing has certainly no claim to be exempt from it; but my
chief care has been to advance nothing that is not
consonant to reason and experience, free from every-
thing that is mysterious; and to show that the only
true religion of moral righteousness, whose basis can
be no other than truth, cannot be founded upon any
traditional or historical faith, which has no other sup-

actions, which have no other proofs than such as are
quite as suspicious as the actions themselves, and
altogether inconsistent with common sense and expe-
rience.

FUJ;tTHER CONSIDERED.
IN dealing with the important subject of supernaturals
for , the third time, it is analogous with our highest
admiration of the All-ruling Power again to observe,
that with the exception of the faint and glimmering
light which we have of the works of nature before us,
all knowledge of the Almighty and Self-directing power
is of infinitely too sublime a nature to be comprehended
in any degree by poor mortals. And, as we can discover
but very few of the causes of the endless effects we see
in nature, it is the most ridiculous of all follies to

imagine others, and place them beyond, or external to,
the empire of nature. Therefore, none are such ___,,__,
great atheists as tl10se men who gain an ascendency
over the minds of tl1eir fellow men, and therewith the
riches and luxuries of the world, by propagating or
maintaining falsehoods,-in impiously pretending, by
secret inspiration, to have an exclusive knowledge of
that All-ruling Power. Such men have introduced pro-
digies and doctrines, not only impertinent to, but absurd
and unworthy tenets concerning that power, with-
drawing men as well from their reason, as from the
study and practice of truth. This sacerdotal villany
has more or less prevailed in all ages, and must have
been well known to the cynic, Diogenes,_who made
the following answer to a priest who wanted him to join
his order:-" \Vilt thou (says he) have me to believe ...,,_
that those famous men, Epaminondas and Agesilaus,
shall be miserable hereafter, when thou, who art but an
ass, and doest nothing of any work, shalt be happy
only because thou art a priest!"
Em·ly in the fifth century, a highly respectable Bishop
of our church, mal<es the following observations :-
" vVhoever writes anything for the people (says he),
or addresses his speech to them, must necessarily be
popular in liis doctrine, and invent or discourse what

gratifies them ; for they being unlearned, are therefore
pertinacious and intractable defenders of their senseless
prejudices, in so much, that if any one declines from
the rites and foolish ceremonies of his country, he must
prepare to drink the juice of the hemlock." In other
words, the amiable Bishop meant to say that the
preacher of learning and genius might philosophize at
home, but abroad he must talk popular nonsense; for
no sort of brute is more cross-grained, or requires
more cunning to manage than the superstitious brute,
especially if he be ignorant.
Natural powers are amply fit to answer all the ends
of virtue and true religion ; therefore, supernatural
powers (allowing for a moment the existence of them)
are needless. No extraordinary inspiration is necessary
to teach the most excellent morals that were. ever
taught,* with the reasonable belief of one ruling power
" The few precepts of sound morality that are to be found in
the New Testament, and which are so much boasted ofby Christians,
are almost a, literal copy of the Morals of Confucius, who wrote
about six hundred years before the time of Moses, and nearly two
thousand years before the birth of Christ. This will appear evident
from some of the following extracts.
24th Moral-" Do to another what you would he should do to
you, and do not unto another what you woulc! should not be done
unto you: thou needest only this law alone; it is the foundation 1tnd
principle of all the rest."

supreme; but so far as regards the NAME by which we
designate that power, it cannot possibly be otherwise
than a matter of perfect indifference. It may be laid
down as a maxim, that as error and falsehood may be
confuted, as well by one man, as by a thousand, so
reason and truth have no more to fear from one thousand,
than from one man. Let us remember the excellent
Confucius, the great philosopher of China, who was
inferior to no man that ever lived : yet neither pre-
tending to inspiration above nature, nor the power of
working miracles, he was the revivor of a religion, of
which nature was the author, which is older than even
the Chinese race, and as old as their country, .which
5lst Moral-" Desire not the death of thine enemy ; thou
wouldst desire it in vain; his life is in the hands of heaven."
53rd Moral-" Acknowledge thy benefits by the return of other
benefi\s, but never revenge injuries."
63rd Moral-" We may have an aversion for an enemy without
desiring revenge; the motions of nature are not always criminal."
"Do those things which you think right, though you think that
after you have done them, you shall be disesteemed; for the vulgar
are ill judges of good things, and as you despise their praise, so
despise their censure."
The disciples of Confucius are yet numerous, after the lapse of
four thousand years since he lived, He instructed as well by his
example as by his precepts; and it would be well if his morals were
taught in all the schools of christendom, instead of creeds and
dogmas which are unintelligible.

their wise men still esteem and enjoy, and which God
never abolished by any NEW WILL, though he has per-
mitted fools that dislike it, to choose other religions.
How widely different are such incomparable legislators
and moralists, from those impostors of antiquity and of
more modern times, teaching their wild and baneful
schemes of preternatural revelation ; and who, w]1en
they perceived that what they established by fraud,
could only be supported by force, coalesced with corrupt
legislators, to get it made a capital offence to question
their dictates, and highly disreputable so much as to
examine, but perdition to doubt them. The priests,
for theii; own interest, were never wanting anywhere
to promote, and cruelly to enforce all such penal laws;
· and hence no room was left for the propagation of truth,
except at the expense of a man's life or liberty, or at
least of his reputation and employments, of which the
examples are innumerable in all a~es. The Philoso-
phers therefore, and other well-wishers of mankind,
were constrained by this holy tyranny, to make use of
two doctrines, the one public, and accommodated to the
prejudices of the vulgar; the other philosophical, and
conformable to reason and the nature of things, con-
sequently to trutl1, and which they communicated only
to friends of known probity, prudence, and capacity;
l\lIRACLES AND OTHER SUPERNATURALS. 81
they being well aware from experience that, in matters·
of theology, truth can hardly be declared anywhere,
except at the hazards that have already been stated.
This chaos of error and absurdity, in which men are
bewildered, naturally produces the woful effects of
mental bondage, superstitious fopperies, pious frauds,
unintelligible jargons, gross ignorance, hypocrisy, and
human persecution: from all of which proceeds that
mass of profligacy and crime that pervades society.
We learn from Zosimus and others, that the Emperor
9..9n~~ whom priests. have called the great, after
he had committed those horrible crimes and cruelties,
which the Pagan priests told him were not to be ex-
piated in their religion, was assured by an Egyptian
bishop of our ch:urch, that there was no crime, no
villany so great, but was to be expiated by the sacra-
ments of the Christian religion ; and therefore, to get
himself white-washed, he embraced the new impiety,
(so Zosimus unfortunately calls the Christian religion),
and so quitted the religion of his ancestors ; for which,
however, the priests did not brand hirn with the epithet
of apostate, although he was one in the strictest and
worst sense of the word. But on his nephew, Julian, one
-
of the best and greatest of human beings, they bestowed
this stigma, in spite of the clearest evidence tliat he 1vas

the very reverse of an apostate, inasmuch as he never
did embrace the Christian religion in his heart; for it is
a known truth that, in his boyhood, he was forced to an

remarks, let us see how he satirises our religion;-
" Whoever,'' says he, " is guilty of rapes, murders,
sacrilege, or any other abominable crimes, let him be
washed with water, and he will become pure and holy ;
if he relapses into the same impieties, he will again
become pure and holy, by thumping his breast, and
beating his head."
Traditional and historical facts may be precarious and
uncertain, and the most wonderful will always be the
most improbable. If the laws of nature are un-
changeable, no work can be wrought, or event take
place contrary to them, nor can they contradict them-
selves; if they are changeable, there can be no depend-
ence on anything; for whatever can interfere with, or
set them aside, must of necessity set aside all criterions
of truth, and all possible knowledge of it. If then
there be any truth that may be depended on, what is
founded on the laws of nature must remain evidently, and

unchangeably so,-till nature changes,-and can suffer
no mutation by miracles. Nature cannot divest itself
of itself; and that which may be supposed or imagined
capable to do it, is altogether supposition and imagina-
tion, because it can only be said, the proof being
contrary to nature. The argument on the side of deism,
therefore, is so far from being pernicious, or destructive
of true religion, that it tends to fix it on true, solid,
and eternal principles, which are everywhere of the
same importance, stability, and lustre.

The word spiritual is admirable in its efficacy, and
endless in its applications, inasmuch as things naturally
false and absurd, when tried by the rules of reason and
common sense, may by it be made perfectly true and
consistent; or, in other words, that which appears eVl-

If we may depend upon anything that Origen l1as
given us, as being the arguments of Celsus against him,
it appears the latter asserted that it was the want of
strict examination and scrutiny into the reports of re-
puted miracles, that gained them credit in the credulous
world at first. He makes Celsus say, that some of the
Christians, neither examining what it was they believed,
nor caring to be examined,* used this expression :-
" Do not examine into matters, but believe, and thy
faith shall infallibly save thee." Celsus would have
made the same observation if he had lived in these

the continual ebriety of our senses, prevent us thinking seriously of
a religion too austere and gloomy to please. If by chance a young
man examines it, he does it with partiality, or without perseve--
rance; he is often disgusted 'vith a single glance of the eye, on
contemplating an object so revolting. In riper age, new passions
and cares, ideas of ambition, greatness, power, the desire of riches,.
and the hurry of business, absorb the whole attention of man, or
leave him but few moments to think of religion, which he never
has the leisure to scrutinize. In old age, the faculties are blunted,

everywhere by the promoters of error, and those who
prefer interest to truth, which they strive to reduce to

The famous Lori..§Eaf!es~ury,. when conferring one
day with Major Wildman, about the many sects of reli-

this conclusion, that, notwithstanding those infinite divi-

Aristotle, that consummate philosopher, did, during the
life of his pupil and patron, Alexander the Great, freely
read to his scholars the lessons of truth and philosophical

It is no wonder that one miracle is said to be wrought
to prove another. Miracles can be defended by nothing
but miracles, for if they could be proved by anything
else, that proof would be a miracle. Homogeneous
things nourish and support each other; animal organiza-
tion can alone be supported by that which has itself been
organized, either in animal or in vegetable life; truth is
supported by truth; lies by lies; fraud by fraud, and
force by force. But it seems very unreasonable that
the worst story-tellers should demand the best credit,
and that on the severest penalties. This of itself is a suf-
ficient demonstration of the badness of such stories, and
of the cause in which they are told, that they need such
penalties to make them pass ; for the most shining truth
is always attended with the clearest evidence, and virtue,
being the offspring of truth, is wholly without com-
pulsion. They go hand in hand, always attended by
freedom; but error dwells with dissimulation, vice, and
compulsion.

phus, a tolerably good historian of the Jews,-speaking
of Cain, he says, "that after a tedious journey through
several colllltries, he took up at length at Nais, and
settled his abode; but was so far from mending upon
his affliction, that he went rather from bad to worse,
abandoning himself to all manner of outrage, without
any regard to common justice; he enriched himself by
rapine and violence, and made choice of the most
profligate of monsters for his companions, instructing
them in the very mystery of their profession. He
corrupted the simplicity of FORMER TIMES, with a novel
invention of weights and measures; and exchanged the
innocency of that primitive generosity and candour, for
the new tricks of policy and craft. All of which shews
plainly enough, that the world had been full of inhabi-
tants long before the father of Cain existed.*

the story thus, "that Nebuchadnezzar, after seven years
spent in solitude, and no one daring during that time
to disturb his government, God was prevailed on to
reinstate him in the exercise of his kingly power." He
·t- farther says that the passage of the Red Sea by the
Israelites, was effected by the same means and manner
as that which happened to the Macedonians under the
command of Alexander, at the Pamphilian sea, in which
there was nothing miraculous, if Alexander himself is

When he relates the miraculous appearance of Moses's
God on Mount Sinai, he adds, " that the reader may

If any priest, or lover of the marvellous, should ask me
why I prefer the relations of Josephus to those of the
Bible, I answer, simply because the accounts of the
former are plain, rational, and perfectly consistent with
experience in matters of fact and history, whereas
the latter are exactly the reverse in all these parti-
culars.

benefit and satisfaction of one generation and not for
another; but if such violations of nature's laws could be
at all necessary, they would be equally so at all times,
and to every people. By this impious charge the justice, l
mercy, goodness, and wisdom of the supreme being is
degraded, inasmuch as he is represented to us as a
partial God, full of capricious levity, now choosing
one thing, then another, and frequently repenti~g of
his actions, so as to be under the necessity of amending
them by the working of miracles ! The belief of s~ch
absurdities is destructive to the moral character of the
deity. "The wonders which are said to have been
wrought in one age, can never convince a sober thinker
in the next, unless there be such lasting monuments
of them, and they are so clearly and fully evidenced
that they appear true against all contradiction :" nor is
it fit they should; because, to believe that miracles
were performed in a certain manner, time, and place,
of which no shadow of proof remains more than in the
bare report, is putting faith iu the reporters, not in the
operators; thus I may be always amused by fabulous
tales as often as simple or bad men please to relate them,
unless I can be sure that no man will tell a lie to serve
his own ends, or be imposed upon by others to believe
a false story.

As the Supreme power always acts towards man
agreeably to the moral fitness of things, there can be
neither room nor occasion for prodigies; for if reasonable
exhortations to virtue, and dissuasions from vice,-if the
example of moral goodness and just laws will not make
people virtuous, nothing can. But pretended miracles
and inspirations rather force the passions by violent, than
guide them by gentle means, and drive men on without
rational sense, instead of driving it into them. Surprise
seizes the imagination, the person no longer hesitates
concerning truth, or deliberates of virtue, but is carried
away, in the rapid torrent of his misguided passion~, by
the power of supernatural chimeras, which astonish and
subvert the imagination. Such is the gloomy conse-
quence when priests succeed in making whatever im-
pressions they please on the minds of the people, and
that which reason rejects, and refuses to support, is upheld
by force and custom. This settled habit, or custom,
may be called the goddess of the multitude,* who, when
backed by their theological leaders, which they are sure

to be in all superstitions, are then very dangerous, as
well as ridiculous opponents of common sense; for their
inconsiderate fury has in all ages proved the greatest
support of the priests against reason, and hence the
generally received a."'<:iom, that the ignorance of the laity

it will be a hard matter to come at truth ourselves, and
dangerous to publish it to others. /
Amongst the ancient Egyptians, Greeks, and other
nations of antiquity, their numerous gods and goddesses
were taken by the ignorant rabble to be so many real
personages, and this folly was carefully inculcated and
taught them by their priests: but amongst the wise and
the initiated they were considered to be nothing else
than so many names for the various physical powers of
nature, for causes, qualities, incidents, &c.; but as the
prudent and the wise alone were initiated, they carefully
concealed their opinions respecting the principles of

there was ignorance enough still among the laity to support the
authority of the clergy." --'\

symbols ; under allegories and metaphors ; thus the
famous Isis of the Egyptians, whom the vulgar believed
'\__ to have been a queen, and of whom they had thousands
of fables, meant nothing but nature, or tlte nature efall
things, according to the philosophers, who held tlrn
universe, or all matter, to be the ruling principle, or
God. And consequently the Supreme Being was said to
be obscure, or beyond comprehension, none seeing
deeper than the surface of nature ; which in some degree
deciphers the inscription upon the figure of !_~is~ais~
" I AM ALL THAT WAS, IS, AND SHALL
BE; NOR HAS ANY MORTAL DISCOVERED
WHAT IS UNDER MY HOOD."
It is very remarkable that in the Mosaic story of the
burning bush, Moses puts into the mouth of the God,
whose hinder parts he pretends to have seen there,
the very name which the Almighty power had always
borne in the sacred mysteries of Isis, viz.-'' I am," or,
" I am that I am,-thou shalt say to the people of Israel,
I am hath sent thee," which sho\\1S that Moses was an
adept in those mysteries, and that he knew how to
turn them to his own account, in imposing upon his
ignorant followers.

If pure deism was universally diffused, then all the

Then farewell to all the holy wars of the Church:
farewell to all the holy burnings and massacres of the
infuriated zealots of these religions. Nature, being as it
were defiled with the sacred poison, would resume her
purity and rights; and truth and virtue would prevail

their submission to priests, and their endless credulity; and from
this roguery of their priests alone, they became beyond all contra-

CRUCIFIX IN HAND, and this, without reckoning all the
massacres precedently committed in the name of Jesus
Christ, to say nothing of the innumerable schisms, and
twenty wars of popes against popes, bishops against
bishops, the poisonings, the assassinations, the rapines of
more than a dozen of popes, who far exceeded a Nero
or a Caligula, in every species of crime and wickedness ;
in short, he observes that this horrid and almost unin-
terrupted chain of religious wars for fourteen centuries,
never subsisted but among Christians, and that no people
but themselves ever spilt a drop of human blood for
theological arguments. "\Ve are obliged to grant to this
philosopher that all this is true, and to which may be
added the horrors with which so many Christian churches,
from the very first of their existence, have stained them-
selves ; the cowardly barbarity of the magistrates who
could sacrifice to the priests so many worthy subjects;
the princes, who, to please them, have become infamous
persecutors ; so much downright nonsense in all eccle-
siastical quarrels; so many abominations in the course
of them; the people murdered or ruined; the thrones of

and mark well that our priests would act the same
tragedies at this day if law and usage did not restrain
them.* Should all the Christians have murdered each
other, brothers cut the throats of brothers for the sake of
arguments, and should there remain no more than a
single Christian on the face of the earth, let him look at
the sun, anditis impossible that he should notacknowledge
and adore one single, eternal, and almighty being, which
comprehends within itself everything that exists,-that
infinite, material, and intellectual sphere, "the centre
of which is everywhere, and the circumference no-

caused more ravages and troubles than any other superstition, and
is in that respect very accordant lo its principles. The theology

metaphysics, modern theologians have become systematically ab;u~
and wicked. By once admitting ilie odious ideas which- theJ

both of courage and reason, and renders us stupid,
distracted, and inactive ; for of all fears none confounds
a man so thoroughly as the fear of the religionist ; and
of all mobs none are so sanguinary and dangerous to the
votaries of reason as the fanatical mob, stirred up at the
instance of their priests; and those of antiquity differed in
nothing from the rabble of the present day, except m
having a more innocent, and less absurd superstition.
Those men who use their understanding must have
more sense than those who use it not, but allow others to
understand for them ; yet if any man presumes to think
for himself, and in consequence of that,. refuses to follow
the sentiments of the common herd of mankind around
him, he cannot fail to draw upon himself the most virulent
malice of the priest, and all his believing adherents,
together with all those who hope to forward their
interests by pretending to believe in him, which will be
about nine hundred and ninety-nine in every thousand;
so that our votary of truth and reason can have no credit
but for what his virtue necessarily procures for him, in
spite of the malice of his enemies; whereas, any profli-

-f- The philosopher already alluded to goes so far as to tell
us of a miracle that is recorded in the appendix of the first
council of Nice, wherein it is said, that the holy bishops,
being full of zeal to distinguish the canonical books from
the false, placed all the immense collection confusedly
upon a great table, and a prayer was addressed to the
Holy Ghost, that he would be pleased to cause the
apocryphal writings to fall to the ground,-that they did
so of themselves accordingly, and went under the table,
whilst those that were genuine remained upon it. He
even hazards a conjecture that the Holy Ghost might
possibly receive some assistance in the night, in selecting
those to be the word of God, which favoured the temporal
interests of the clergy, and the grandeur of the church;
whilst the story of the priests of Bel, or Baal, and all
such books, would be decidedly apocryphal, for exposing
the tricks of the priests in consuming the provisions of
the God, during the night.
Photius relates that the celebrated Synesius, originally
a heathen of great learning and abilities; was, like the
wise Celsns, a disbeliever in all miracles; yet he easily
came into the belief of the resurrection, after he was
made a bishop; and after receiving the new light, as the
consequence of his promotion, he declared that exact
philosophical truth was not necessary for " the vulgar,

them to live in their prejudices." So do the dignitaries
of the church in the present day.
It cannot be too often repeated that supernaturals of
all descriptions form the market in which the mental
liberties, properties, and the souls of men are bought and
sold. This trade is beneficial to the teachers or venders,
but prejudicial in practice to the customers; the doctors
gain what the disciples lose by it; the more poverty it
causes to the stupid believers, the more opulence and
luxury the preachers enjoy,-the more the simple convert
gives, the more the church receives. All concerned in
a false religion must necessarily be either sheepish prey,
or preying wolves, but the true religion is equally within
the comprehension of all, and allows of no inlet to
designing knavery, being agreeable to, and worthy of
God and nature, therefore pure and perfect. But all
revealed, or artificial religions, puzzle and confound their
victims, bewildering them in a maze of confusion, wherein
they cannot distinguish between good and evil, labouring
as they do under the uncertainty of moral right and
wrong. But that of nature clears the apprehension, and
informs the judgment, producing satisfaction and serenity

of mind. Reason and nature, uncorrupted by bad
education, or regenerated from it, afford the possessor
pleasures pure and harmonious, widely different from the
ghastly starts and convulsive raptures of the saintly
fanatic, whose high tide of spiritual folly rolls rapidly on,
and leaves the channel dry. "Not so the charms of
...-~ pliilosophy,-it has all the serene majesty and harmony
of nature within, and without, it is all manly, just, and
good." But religion formed by human inventions pro-
duces perplexity and discord; because it is founded upon
false, unnatural, and precarious principles ; and in the
paroxysms of a blind and heated zeal, is a hell in the
minds of its votaries, as well as occasioning a hell with-
out to the world. vVhat horrors has it not begotten?
What species of iniquity has it not brought forth? By
its fruits it may be known. Thus, from what has been
shown, it follows that a religion built on fallible human
traditions (as all the revealed systems are) is necessarily
fallible and human. Why then should that be infallibly
depended on, or how can that be safely credited, which
is not erected on infallible principles, but on fables and
legends that are equally absurd and uncertain? or, if it
was possible they should be true, we cannot possibly
KNOW them to be so. Again let it be repeated, that

obscurity and uncertainty are the best cloaks for falsehood
to wrap itself in.
It is true that the fatted calf of superstition is now
staggering as from a fatal thrust, yet if men art;l not
incessantly on their guard for the conservation of their
liberties, what security have we that those times may not
return, when a hireling priesthood, backed by mad
fanatics, will, as they already have done, destroy the
supporters of these truths with fire and fagot ? But the
trutlis tl1emselves can never be destroyed, because they
are founded in nature and right reason. Let the soaring

guilt ! !! Such a faith as this is more preposterous, more wicked,
and more impious than downright Atheism itself. "The immolating
or sacrificing of one person or thing, to atone for the guilt of
another, can make no part of the economy of an all-wise and all-
powerful being; such unjust substitution involving a virtual denial
of these sublim~ attributes."

damned for this, ·they will be damned with a good con-
science, so that even the hell of priests cannot be a bad
one while a consciousness of rectitude remains. If there
is no material fire in that hell for the body, there is no
immaterial that can hurt a good conscience.
But granting for a moment tbe hypothesis that super-
stition has in any instance, or at any time, proved
beneficial to human society, owing to its distortion; yet
at other times, without number, and in things of incom-
parably greater importance, it is found to have been
detrimental, destructive, and utterly pernicious; nor
advantageous to any, except to priests or princes, who
dexterously turn it to their own interest, and always
direct it according to their own pleasure. But the crafty
empirics do not stop here ; they know full well that tl1e
falsity of facts, and the utterly untenable ground of
their arguments, may at any time be detected by men of
penetration, and therefore they have always boasted of a
superior, or what they call a divine knowledge above
supposing that he punishes to all eternity those to whom he refuses
the means, or the will, of saving themselves,-this gives us the idea
of nothing but a whimsical tyrant, who, if he be lavish of his favours
to a few, is at least cruel and unjust to the rest: surely nothing can
be more inconsistent with the just notions of an immutable deity,
whose mercies are infinite, and whose goodness is inexhaustible."

nature, and which, they say, is not subject to the rules of
criticism, nor in any respect an object of the under-
standing. In this metaphysical strong-hold they have
hitherto sheltered themselves against the light of nature
and common sen.se, and the effects have been in the
l1ighest degree pernicious and deadly to reason, freedom,
and the happiness of mankind, by introducing and
establishing spiritual tyranny in the clergy, and the most
abject slavery of mind in their silly believers.
It may be objected, that God can do things contrary
to nature, but we repeat that, setting aside all foolish and
inconsistent traditions, what proof is there that the
supreme power ever did, or ever will suspend, or depart
from, the eternallaws of nature ("that it can, is doubiful;
that it never will, is certain"). And therefore every man
of judicious reflection may suspend his belief until he is
rationally convinced, and by a noble effort spurn from
his mind the priestly scourge of damnation which ~angs
over him for doubting. This famous scourge "drives faith
into the timorous, as a mallet drives a wedge into a
DLOCK; and in like manner divides, rends, and weakens
the understanding.''
Common sense, if not suppressed, is alone sufficient to
destroy all the evidence in the world of a thing that is
MIRACLES AND OTHER SUPERNATURALS. 107
diametrically opposed to it; for it would be a foolish
attempt to prove a fact true, by other facts which equally
want proof themselves.
On a faith so pernicious every unprejudiced person
must look with abhorrence, and hold in suspicion the
professors thereof, whether they are induced to it by
their own blind ignorance, or by hire and bribery ; the
former class deserve our pity, from their neglect of
common sense; the latter merit our contempt from their
shameless selfishness and delusions. In the present
dawn of rational light, the minds of the rising generation
should therefore be taught to be on their guard, as to
the compass by which they direct their judgment and
conduct;-let them scrupulously weigh arguments, and
the reason of things impartially; and let not men be
deluded by holy names and a face of godliness ; since it
has generally happened that those whom Holy Mother
Church has designated as saints, have been the vilest of
men ; insomuch t~at saint and villian have commonly
meant the same thing, and may be considered as synoni-
mous terms; for it has seldom escaped the penetration
of those who are capable of thinking, that all who appear
more sanctified than others whose pretensions go not
beyond the standard of moral honesty, have only been so
much more secretly and artfully wicked. And therefore,
108 LECTURE III.
if we would not be choused out of our understanding
and substance, by base hypocrisy in every grave and
holy shape, let us remember the old maxim, "when you
see a saint, look to yourself."
Since all the authority that we have of the authenticity
of the earliest Christian writings and traditions, is from
the fathers of the church, it is highly pr~per that the
character and conduct of these men should not wholly
escape observation; and against some of them it has
L
; been strongly contended by many of the pagan writers
ofcredit, that those !fitings called gospels, had no exis-
tence as we now see them, l!ntil very long (some say
~
more than two centuries) ~fter the times in which it is
said the Apostles lived; that tliey were compiled by
obscure persons from the writings of the Egyptian
monks, or Therapeutre, who prefixed the names of cer-
tain Apostles to their writings, the better to obtain
credit; that these were again altered, amended, and fitted
up at will by the early fathers of the church, to suit
their own interest, and the ignorance of the times; of
which fact we have sufficient proofs; and amongst others
the younger Scalige~ expressly declares, that "they put
into their scriptures,. or gospels, whatever they thought
would serve their purpose." Faustus says, "we ltave
frequently proved that these things were neither writ-
l\IIRACLES AXD OTHER SUPERXATUllALS. 109
ten by himself (Jesus Christ) nor by his Apostles, and
that they were picked up long after their decease, from
vague stories and flying reports." Of such suspicious
materials did a few of the fathers compose and trim up
the gospels; each espousing those parts as canonical in
which his interest, and his peculiar tenets were to be
found, rejecting such parts as did but indifferently favour
the views of the clergy, as being apocryphal: but of all
these trimmers, none equalled the famous Eusebius,'
bishop of Cresarea, at getting up, and dressing off a
gospel to suit the .general interests of the church. /
But, " to be particular about the fathers,-any at-
--
tempt to delineate their ambition, insolence, avarice,
ignorance, faction, sedition, persecution of each other,
cruelty, murders,* lies and forgeries, and other flagrant
vices, would be endless; yet these are the men whose
honesty we are to depend upon for conveying to us THE
ORACLES of TRUTH. Are we to learn our religion from
men immersed in such vices, and who wanted charity?

early perioJ, "that they were led on by fury, faction, and madness,"

knocked and kicked Flavianus, Patriarch of Constantinople, with
such fury that within three clays after he died."-/,'AM: Concil.

cursing each other? No people upon earth ever differed
more, or proceeded with greater fury and bitterness in
their differences :-they were constantly quarrelling
about the smallest, as well as the greatest points ; and
for the smallest as well as the greatest they damned
one another. That these foul marks belong to many of
the fathers, and all of them to some, is too manifest.
In a word, a man might fill volumes with the bare
reeital only, and that from the very best authorities, of
the impieties and senseless vanities of the fathers ; but
indeed ecclesiastical history has done it already to our
hands, being itself nothing but a compendium of their
vices."*
If we have the relations of foolish and unnatural
stories, said to have happened nearly two thousand years
before our time, and cannot possibly come at the true
characters of the first relators, there is surely no evidence
that can be relied upon ; but if the characters of the
intermediate relaters are well known, and we have every
reason to believe from their writings, and all we have
been able to learn of them otherwise, that they were
" We learn from Burnet's Exposition, that the practice of unna-
tural lusts had been so general amongst the dignitaries of the church,

both weak and entlwsiastical, self-interested, and design-
ing knaves, easily imposed on themselves when lucre led
the way, and ever readily disposed to deceive others,
then the relation deserves no credit whatever. "And
such a set of men the fathers, or heads of the contending
sects, appear evidently to have been, almost to a man,
during the four first centuries; injudicious in all they
relate, taken up with every idle report, uncharitable,
ignorant of true religion, bigots, knavish in all favourite
points of theology, and betrayers of the simple deism
of primitive Christianity; and instead of establishing
the books called scriptures by their testimonies, they
have rendered them the most precarious and suspicious
writings in the world."
Such were the men who compiled, amended, and
changed at pleasure, what they have called the word of
God, founding thereon a system of religion which has
taken root in a considerable portion of the world; and to
the shame of abused and credulous mankind, it has been
established, as it were, in defiance of the light of nature,
reason, common sense, and all experience; and, what is
yet still more strange and revolting, by those very means
and agencies which men ought to hold most in contempt
and detestation ;-viz., forgery, mystery, pretended mira-
cles, prophecy, fraud, hypocrisy, avarice, cruelty, tyranny,

wars and massacres which have deluged the earth with
blood, and sacrificed hundreds of millions of human
beings to the baleful demon of superstition.
However painful the confession may be, we are
obliged to acknowledge that all these horrid wars and
massacres on account of religious opinions, liave affiicted
mankind only since the introduction of Christianity, and
during its progress for the last fifteen hundred years;
for, in the former times, the men called heathens, or
pagans, had no exclusive religion, and every man was at
full liberty to w'orship his God .in any way he pleased ;
every thing in their mythology was easy, pliant, and
liarmonious, and they never thought of cutting each
others' throats on account of speculative notions in reli-
gion, except in a few solitary instances, when goaded on
by their priests against enlightened individuals, as in the
case of Socrates, Aristotle, &c. ; but, generally, the
priests thought only of multiplying the sacrifices, and
other offerings for their own support; and they were
even so indulgent as to permit their votaries to laugh as
much as they pleased at the ridiculous notion of sticking
a knife into the neck of a calf, in order to disarm the
wrath of all the gods and goddesses, provided the veal
was of a proper age, fat, and well flavoured. This was
an easy, light, and jocular superstition, which, like all
MIRACLES AND OTHER SUPERNATURALS. 1]3
artificial religions, stood most endangered from disuse
and oblivion; and, therefore, if numerous sacrifices were
continually offered, and Jupiter was invoked at all, the
priests did not much concern themselves about the
manner, or the many names under which he received
worship and adoration ; only they took special care that
this worship should not be deemed efficacious without
their intervention. Thus we see that superstition suffers
neither God, man, nor the other animals to live in peace,
as evidently appears from the sacrifices of antiquity, as
well as from the more gloomy and costlier religions of
more modern invention. In those times, the foolish
enthusiasts often saddled their family inheritances with
an annual routine of entailed sacrifices, which burdened
the land, and rendered it less valuable; for all purchasers
wished to have the land sine sacris, sine sumptu, as people
now wish to get rid of tithes.
,
The numerous herd of believers in miracles, in place
of being the best, is the very worst touchstone of truth,
since the number of fools so far exceeds that of the wise;
and he is not to be thought impious who pourtrays the
god of the priest-led multitude, but he who applies the
opinions of the multitude to the Supreme Being.
It has been observed elsewhere that, if the pretended
miracles which are brought forward to prove the truth of
114 LECTURE III.
any set of dogmas, stand·themselves equally in need of
proof, and that proof naturally impossible, they only add
to the string of absurdities; and it cannot be denied, that
all the three religions that now inthral the human mind
in Europe, part of Africa, and a great portion of western
Asia, have had abundance of miracles, but the code of
the last invented one is the smallest in number, and these
have been fabricated by Mahometan priest'l since tl1e
-f- time of the founder. Now, since about three fourths of
mankind are neither Jews, Christians, nor Mahometans,
t!iese miracles (allowing for a moment the truth of them)
have been wrought with more partiality ttian justice,
there having been thousands of millions of men who
never heard of Moses, Jesus Christ, or Mahomet.
' The Supreme Being is best displayed in the fixed and
unalterable order of nature.'
Tully says-
" The superstitious man, asleep or awake,
Enjoys no repose :
He lives not happily,
Nor dies securely,

ON TRUTH, AS THE BEST BOND OF
SOCIETY.
WHEN the free and unprejudiced mind takes a com-
prehensive view of the present structure of society in all
its degrees, particularly in wliat are called the higher
walks of it, the best feelil).gs of our nature are shocked
and outraged, on perceiving that deceit and dissimu-
lation, are the indispensable pre-requisites in the strife of
making way in the world, and seem to be regularly

taught in youth, both by precept and example, so as to
make the perfection of education to consist in the prac-
tice of that falseness of intellectual conduct, which causes
every man, and every woman, to appear exactly the
reverse of what they are in reality. Nor is there any
remedy for this horrid condition of things. "So shall the
world go on," while superstition maintains her pestiferous
sway; and every attempt to remodel society from the
foundation, will be vain and hopeless, so long as that
arch fiend remains, to mix and poison the wholesome
streams that flow from the pure fountain of morality ;
for the fatal mixture of this foul ingredient has rendered
man so depraved by errors, so tainted with the most
atrocious crimes, and so excessive!y ferocious, through
having nearly destroyed the original mildness of his
nature, that there is now hardly any animal viler than
man.
But if the principles of society were calculated for
the general good of mankind, and founded upon a
basis in nature, truth never could be injurious to
·any human being; and it is unsuitable to man ?nly
in consequence of his departure frotn nature, and his
·having been long· immersed in the follies and super-
stitions of an absurd education, and afraid to look
truth in the face. There is l1ardly any usage or
TRUTH, THE BEST BOND OF SOCIETY. 117
custom in society that is not so unnatural, false,
and pernicious, that it may be doubted whether the
very reverse of every one of them, would not be
beneficial to it, and place humanity on a better footing
than that on which it stands at present. This enormous
mass ofcorruption has given rise to the beautiful allegory
of the well: for truth, seeing herself despised, and
her throne usurped by the hags of hypocrisy and super-
stition, modestly creeps back into the bottom of her well,
out of which her small still voice is seldom heard,
drowned as it is by the thundering and overbearing tones
of her opponents, the votaries of error, aud theologic
vision. But when mankind shall be prepared to make
the light of nature, truth, and virtue, the only ground-
work and bond of society, in place of human artifice,
falsehood, and the vicious notions which they have
always been addicted to, in forming their deity after
their own image and character, then will truth come·
forth from the bottom of her well, and appear in her
native loveliness and simplicity, no longer to be deemed
injurious to the human race, as there will then be an end
to t11at juggling imposture that has hitherto ruied the
world.
In the present distorted order of things, error is
118 LECTURE IV.
carefully propagated and handed down from father to
son, from family to family, and the mind is debauched
in early youth by the folly of impressions instilled by
superstitious parents, and the craft of interested hirelings,
whose visionary ravings are founded on faith in super-
natural mysteries and prodigies; and as that which is the
object of
J.faith, never can be that of reason, so we haye
bigotry and intolerance in its place. These are some of
the unhappy results of man's having swerved so far from
the laws and principles of his nature, as to become quite
unnatural in almost every institution and custom in
which his happiness is mainly concerned0and hence
arise all his miseries in society.
Amongst the numerous objections that would readily
be started against a conformity to the laws of nature,
a very prominent one would be to the free intercourse
between the sexes, at which the slave of artificial society
would take the alarm, and declare that if the laws of
marriage did not exist as they are at present, and if love
was not shackled by their prohibitions, how would a man
be able to know his children if he had n~t the exclusive
possession of his wife? This is an old question, but it
is only measuring the magnitude of an evil by others
which surround, and are connected with it; for wl1ile the
TRUTH, THE BEST BOND OF SOCIETY. 119
whole structure of society is indeed nothing but a Pan-
d•:n·a's box, where evil is created to prop up evil against
the light and laws of nature, I repeat that, any attempt
to remedy an individual ill would be unavailing; and,
therefore, nothing short of a radical reformation of
society, on the basis of nature, truth, and reason, can
restore man to that happiness which his mind and organi-
zation are capable of enjoying. In a state well regulated
by good and equal laws, which nourish the moral
virtues, love would be free to man as it is to all the
other animals, and would mainly console and sweeten
his existence,-
"And love ma<le free,-a hope which we have nurst
" As nature's choicest solace,-"
instead of serving to be the pest of his life, as it now is
generally ; and the bringing forth of children to that
state, under any circumstances whatsoever, would tend
to the good repute and honor of the women, in place of
being what it now is, a stigma, a reproach, a curse, to all
who are not in the commonly unfortunate monopoly of
marriage, which comprises hardly a half of the sex, whilst
the other moiety are condemned to contend against
nature through life.
Laws, which appear to be a perfect rule for the most
120 LECTURE IV.
perfect of all things, they being no other than the laws
of Almighty Power, must certainly be allowed to be the
most perfect rule for the conduct of mankind. Cicero,
who possessed the highest gifts of mind and genius,
declares that, "it is impossible to err as long as we follow
the guidance of nature;" and again,-" there is no man,
who, following the dictates of nature, may not arrive at
perfection,"-meaning all the perfection his nature is
capable of.
/
, So long as man shall continue the idle attempt to
distinguish nature from herself, and from truth, so long
will his senses and reason be hoodwinked and bewil-
dered; with a mind enervated by idle tales of gross
superstitious folly, he trembles before idols, the creation
of his own fancy; perpetually occupied in disarming
their wrath by forms of prayer and adulation, borrowed
from the meanest human usages, and taught him by
those whose interest it is to uphold those systems of
delusion, by which they enjoy in ease and affluence the
good things of the world; he has wantonly wasted the
fruits of his industry in building fine houses for these
imaginary beings to dwell in, or at least for their
occasional accomodation; he has sacrificed his own species
by millions, to serve and glorify them; he has made
psalms and ballads and sung them in their praise, in
TRUTH, THE BEST BOND OF SOCIETY". 121
imitation of the flatterers of great men; he has scourged
himself; he has danced, he has lamented, he has clothed
himself gorgeously; he has gone naked, and in nasti-
ness; he has sat upon nails run into his flesh; in a
word, there is hardly a whim or a prank that the imagi-
nation can devise, which has not been in exercise
to disarm, or propitiate those unreal forms of his own
fancy.
To all this has ma:q. submitted in times past, and what
is worse, he may continue to do so for centuries to come,
before he can effectually discard the foolish mummeries
that blind him, and rally round the. standard of his
reason, a task that. is exceedingly difficult, for, as we
have already observed, the pride of men will endure no
correction in these matters, judging every attempt of
the kind to be a reflection upon their understanding,
although, in truth, these faculties of the mind had npt
been consulted or exercised ; yet- they are ever ready to
defend, with the most passionate obstinacy, whatever
they have been-accustomed to reverence in the shape of
religion, or other customs, ho,vever preposterous ; and
the_voice of reason prevails with few indeed.
It has often been urged, by those who candidly
acknowledge the prevalence of such absurd abuses, that
it is better to sanction their continuance than to attack

and expose them, as such notions of preternatural powers
serve a good purpose in society, by keeping the lower
orders in fear and subjection. But any strength that
is in this argument, does, in reality, favour the true
and rational side of the question, as it amounts to a
broad admission that there is a general secession
from the simplicity of nature, that insincerity is re-
quired to prop up falsehood, and that errors, and
absurd follies form the constitution and texture of
society.
Taking the aggregate of the pains and pleasures
which man experiences through life, whatever may be
his rank or condition, tl1e probability is, that he is one
of the least happy of all the animals that come under our
observation ; and this preponderance of evil, which few
will dispute, is chiefly occasioned by his egregious

and customs, from which have sprnng all the follies of.

the mind is not confined to Christendom, but exists
wherever men have been weak and silly enough to sup-

and the difficulty there is in not believing t110Se
tbings that claim a supernatural original, though there
be neither sense, argument, nor reason to confirm
them.
Our divines tell us, perhaps in the way of allegory,
that the Almighty Being is said frequently to swear, and
even to swear in wrath; that he smiles, loves, hates,
gives, receives, wrestles, fights, &c. ; but having no
superior, whom can he invoke or swear by? unless, like
the Jupiter of old, he shakes his imperial curls in token
of swearing by himself.*
The only way to account for this theological nonsense
is, that everything said of the All-ruling Power, by
priests, is borrowed from the passions and conduct of
men towards each other; and vainly endeavouring to
establish an analogy that is not only vicious and imper-
fect, but perfectly ridiculous. But even here they stop
not, for wicked priests have represented the Supreme
Being under opposite characters, causing l1im to make a
will, or testament, which he afterwards revokes (as a
man does), and makes another, giving rules of conduct
in one that, are contrary to those of the other.t In this

have no validity; yet our priests make use of either the
one or the other, just as it serves their interest; telling

that he has no body; yet still possessing a spiritual body,

"' The French priest, Menot, tells a ludicrous story about the ··\
incarnation. He says " that from all eternity God had made up his
mind to send his Son for the salvation of the human race, but was

the incredulity thou shew'dst when I informed thee that thou
shouldst be the mother of Isaac." The third was Madame Rebecca,
to whom God said, "thou hast done a g1·eat injury to Esau, in

When men eminent for learning and abilities can
with seeming seriousness maintain assertions so per-
fectly contradictory of each other, using all the powers
of eloquence in their defence, and hold forth such wild

as being the word of the Supreme Power, there is no
wonder that they become confounded and stupified in the

Such irrational notions and opinions amongst mankind
are evidently founded in, and are the fruits of a pernicious
education, infused into them as well traditionally as from
books, confirmed by liabit and example, and enforced by
authority, to the exclusion of examination, which rarely
takes place, as they are considered as inviolable from

The total departure from nature and truth in matters
of religion, has never been known to originate amongst
the common people, for in every instance the new
inventions of revelation, and other chang·es from bad to
worse, have sprung up in the sacerdotal order, or with
knaves who aspire to it ; and therefore, this crime ought
to be imputed solely to them, together with political
rulers, who act with them for the same corrupt and
fallacious end, in every country; and not to the populace,
who, moulded by habit and authority, are reduced to
passive obedience. And when we look back to the bottom-
less fountain of the ethnical superstitions of antiquity,
out of which has been sewered down to us, t!ie more
turbid stream of modern folly and absurdity, it seems .
hopeless to find a thread of truth, by the assistance of
which the abused laity may extricate themselves from the
labyrinth of error, in which the great mass of them have
all along been immersed, otherwise than by a total
will cease when men cease to be ignorant and credulous. Then

sons for the laity to depend on in matters equally
unknown to all ?-or, are they, who are not permitted to
choose their own religion, fit to choose a religion for
others?
A very int!!lligent author has observed, that "the dis-
putes between Christian priests have always been scenes
of animosity, hatred, and heresy. We find these to have
existed since the infancy of the church. A religion
founded on wonders, fables, and obscure oracles, could
only be a fruitful source of quarrels. Priests attended
to ridiculous doctrines, instead of useful knowledge, and
when they should have studied true morality, and taught
mankind their real duties, they, only s~rove to gain
adherents. They bus~ed themselves in useless specu-
lations on a barbarous and enigmatical science, which
under the pompous title of the science of God, or
theology, excited in the vulgar a reverential awe. They
invented a bigoted, presumptious, and absurd system, as

incomprehensible as the God whom they affected to wor-
ship.* Hence arose disputes on disputes concerning
puerile.subtilties, odious questions and arbitrary opinions,
which, far from being useful, only tended to poison the
peace of society. " In these contentions, we regret·to
find the most profound geniuses occupied, and are
forced to censure the prostitution of talents worthy of a
better cause. The people, ever fond of turbulence,
entered into quarrels they could not understand. Princes
undertook the defence of those priests they wished to
favour, and orthodoxy was decided by the l.ongest sword.
This assistance the church never hesitated to receive
in times of danger; for on such occasions the clergy
rely rather on human assistance than on the promise of
God, who declared that the sceptre of the wicked should
not rest upon the lot of the righteous. The heroes
• From the very few fragments of the best pagan writers which
Eusebius, an<l other fathers of the church have suffered to come
down to us, it clearly appears that the ancient term God, or any
other appellative such as the I-a-ho of the Phrenicians, (which
l\Ioses turned into Jehovah), the Isis, or Knef, of the Egyp-
tians; the Zeus, or Jupiter of the Greeks, &c., all of them
being expressive of power in the superlative degree meant nothing
more than a Personification of Nature, as the whole, or all-in-all;
and the inferior train of subaltern gods and goddesses signified the

found in the annals of the church, have been obstinate
fanatics, factious rebels, or furious persecutors ; they
were monsters of madness, sedition, and cruelty. The
world, in the days of our ancestors, was depopulated in
the defence of extravagancies which excite laughter in a
posterity not indeed much wiser than they were."
If there is a law of nature, it can be no other than the
religion of nature, with the observance of which the
Supreme Power will not dispense, either in itself, or in
its creatures; and no religion can be true that, in the
most minute circumstance, is contrary to its invariable
righteousness: and certainly nothing can be a greater
libel on that only true religion, than to suppose it does
not contain such internal marks, as will, even to the
meanest capacity, distinguish it from all the false religions
that now distract the world; so as that a man, although
unable to read in his mother tongue, may, with~ut
pinning his faith on any set of priests, know what the
Almighty Power requires of him. But, under the present
mental bondage, the mass of the people will be enabled
to know this only by a fearless search after truth, under
the guidance of unerring reason : in place of which, they
hitherto have, from sloth and blind obedience, examined
none of the marvellous things they have been taught,
but like beasts of burden, patiently crouched down, and

with donkey indifference, have undergone whatever their
oppressors have laid upon them.
When commonly received notions are attacked, and
which cannot be defended, because they have no found-
ation in truth and reason, the usual cry and alarm is-
" Why will you pull down these, and substitute nothing in
their place, to overawe and keep the multitude in order?"
Tl1e answer to this question is, that we have only to open
our eyes to be convinced; that religion, among high and
low, restrains nobody, not even the priests who preach
and .live by it. The most devout nations of Europe,
such as the Spaniards and Portuguese, are alike distin-
guished by their bigotry and corruption of manners; the
clergy themselves show them the example of perfidy,
cruelty, and the most unbridled licentiousness. To restrain
men, there is need neither of falsehoods nor fables, but
of good laws, good education, cultivated reason, science,
good examples, rewards, and equitable punishments,-
all these produce the most excellent morals ; 'whereas,
when chimeras only are opposed to the irregularities of
mankind, they are not capable of vanquishing their
inclinations : error must be removed before truth can
take its place, for they cannot exist for a single moment
together; and in the present case we have only to remove
the rotten materials of a false and groundless fabric,
132 LECTURE IV.
to make way for truth and the eternal reason of
things.
The Epicureans of old were the chief sect who held,
and taught the mortality of the soul; yet notwithstanding
this opinion, they were generally esteemed as the most
exemplary and virtuous of all the anci'ents, and the most
noted for the value of their moral actions. We may
gather from the writings of Cicero and Diogenes
Laertius, that they did more scrupulously observe the
laws, piety, and fidelity among men, than any other
sect whatsoever, not excepting even the stoicks them-
selves. They held that a man was either good or bad
according to education and custom : being above all
others strict observers of truth and honesty, they were
often chosen to manage the inheritances of orphans, and
it was common with them to rear and educate, at their
own expense, the children of deceased friends : their
known integrity frequently procured for them offers from
the Roman Consuls and Emperors, to fill places of high
employments and trusts, but these offers were often
declined, from the strong desire they had to lead pri-
vate lives, free from care and anxiety: they were
not ambitious, for where a future state is utterly denied,
there could be but little desire for posthumous renown.
But in modern times society is in a great measure

destitute of such pure morality, all being mixed up with
the ever-changing alloy of theology, which is consistent
in nothing but its exclusive interests, and in forbiding all
inquiry into its mysteries. It has dictated creeds for the
bulk of mankind in all countries, followed up by the
assertion, that what is generally believed must be true;
but this will hold good only when men shall take nature,
reason, and' experience, alone for their guides. Of this
grand truth many instances might be adduced, such as
the following :-Before the times of £oper.1!icu~ and the
famous Q[tlile~, men were taught by their priests that
the sun revolved round the earth, that the latter was fiat
like a table, and one-third longer than it was broad, and
hence our terms of longitude and latitude. Copernicus
showed the absurd falsity of these notions, and taught
that the sun was the centre of his own, or, what is called
the solar, system, and that the earth had a double motion-
in revolving on its own centre, and also round the sun.
But knowing of the hosts ~f priests who were ready to
pounce upon him, if he discovered these truths openly, he
never could be prevailed upon to publish his works until
near the time of his death, and he lived just long enough
to receive a corrected copy of them. Galileo, at the
distance of more than a hundred years after the former,
offended the holy conclave still more, in asserting, that
134 LECTURE lV.
the sole cause of the appearance of day and night, was
owing to the earth's revolution on its own axis in twenty-
four hours. These, and many other scientific discoveries
of this great man, drew down upon his head the implac-
able vengeance of the whole Catholic church, and he
was condemned by that wicked conclave which calls
itself holy, for daring to know and to propogate truths
that are now known to every school-boy.>11<
These well-attested facts ought to press strongly on
every unprejudiced mind, leaving the lasting effect of
showing that all such great luminaries in science, for ~he
developement of natural truths, are still as unpalatable
to clerical dominion, as ever they were at any former
period. But to the great detrimentof that dominion, the
day of burning at the stake has now passed away in the
reformed countries of Europe, and the light of nature
and reason have happily gained some ground; and science,
whose foundation is truth, has ventured to clip the wings
of the demon of ecclesiastical power; but nothing can be
more certain than that the ever-living thirst after this

power, with the free inquisitorial exercise of it, will for
ever be the same in the officers of all superstitions, so
long as man shall have the folly to maintain an hireling
priesthood, to drain his purse and enslave his mind.
A modern philosopher has observed, that it was evi-
dently from the Timams, and other writings of~ that
the early fathers of the Christian ch.J!!.ch fab~ated t~ir
tr~ty, and were generally instructed in the arts of
mystery and ambiguity; and hence they have called him
divine, for furnishing them with three hypostases, or
existencies, by personifying the goodness, wisdom, and
power ofthe Supreme Being, that is, by converting these
divineattributes into so many persons. Thus, byperverting
and twisting the obscure physicks of this philosopher to
suit their own spiritual fantasy, they have contrived to fit
up their trinity, and thereby to establish one of their
strongest holds over the vulgar mind. Other grounds
of the Christian trinity have been found in the writings
of Plato, as when he says, "the son, the wonderful pro-
ducer of good;" but here, under a kind of punning
metaphor, it is evident he alludes to the sun which we
behold, and which he calls " the most sensible image of,
or most eximious representation of that supreme God, or
all ruling power,, of which the sun was only a repre-
sentative, but forming a most glorious part of the

unbounded all-in-all. The "word" comes next to complete
the Platonic trinity,* and, by thie, in all probability, he
meant only to signify the nature ofall earthly things, meta-
phorically represented by the god Pan, or Mercury, who
according to pagan mythology, was the "word" ofJupiter,
the then supreme god. However, out of these materials,
the early Christian fathers drew the idea, and contrived
to get up their trinity, from the writings of a heathen
philosopher, who would sometimes require a revelation
to explain him.t But his obscurity may easily be
" The word Trinitg was first used by Theophilus, bishop of
Antioch, in the year 150, to express persons, as they are callecl, in
the Godhead. The passage in the 1st epistle ofJohn, chap. 5, v. 7,
never appeared till the second edition of Erasmus's New Testament,
about 1560. The 1st edition was printed in 1514, anrl the terct

-/ t Even the idea of Mediator is boi:rowed from the famous _
?'.oroastes, or Zoroaster of Persia, who, according to Plutarch,
taught, that there existed two principles, one ofgood, and the other
evil; the first was called Oromazus, or Oromasdes, the Ancient
ofDays, being the princ!ple of good or light; the other, Arimanes,
was the genius ofevil and darkness. Between these two he placed a
third power, called Mithras, to which the Persians gave the name of
Mediator, and this l\fithras, or Mediator, was no other than the
physical sun, which we behold, and which was also called Triple,
either from power, wisdom, and goodness, or from heat, light, and
influence. Oromazus is the name which the followers of Zoroaster-
gave to the Supreme Being, and which signifies, in the Chaldean
language, a burning light. The bad principle, Arimanes, signifies my
enemy, or cunning and deceitful. From these principles of good

accounted for, inasmuch that even in his day the influ-
ence of the priests made it dangerous to speak those
truths which exposed their arts; for if he had expressed
in full and clear terms the convictions of his great and
luminous mind, he could not h~ve escaped the fate of his
master Socrates, who (it cannot be too often repeated),
was put to death at the instigation of the Athenian
priests, for his adherence to truth.
The ancient Brahmins of India were probably the £rst -j-
who corrupted human society by the invention of spiritual,
or celestial existencies ; and all the successive religions
that have sprung up in the west, (and they have been
many in number), have adopted the same machinery,
varied according to time and place. And from the past we
are warranted in concluding that new religions will
always be springing up, all inimical to truth and reason,
nineteen in every twenty of which will fail to take root,
and a very few, from particular circumstances, will be
successful and flourish for a time-perhaps for many
centuries-and then be exploded in their turn, to

views of theo1ogian8, leagued with tyrannical govern-
ments.
In such a manner have mankind been always abused,
and as there seems to be, unhappily, a large portion of
credulity in man's very nature, which easily subjects him
to such thraldom of the mind, nothing but the strongest
efforts of natural reason, aided by the impartial school of
experience, and the utter exclusion of all artificial
religions, can enable hiin to overthrow the altars of
error, and guide him in the paths enlightened by nature
and common sense; for it may be taken as a general rule,
that whatever is contrary to nature is against reason, and
whatever is against reason ought be rejected as absurd.
To the free and unprejudiced inquirer, it cannot but
appear perfectly plain, that in Christian society, from the
earliest times, theology has ever exerted itself in the
suppression of all natural truths of the higher order,
wherever man has had the genius to discover them, in-
somuch as virtually to admit that any deep knowledge of
nature, is so incongruous with theology, that they can
have no existence together; and numerous instances )
might further be adduced, such as the following :-Virgil,
bishop of Saltzburgh, was condemned by the church for
daring to maintain the existence of tl1e Antipodes. The
great Descartes died in a foreign land, from church

persecution. Julius Vanini was burnt by the clergy for
saying that " God is both the beginning and the end,
without being in need of either; in no one place,, yet
present every where ; he is within and without every-
thing, his power is his will." For such tenets did the
theologians burn poor Vanini; and the learned Stephen
Dolet, was burnt by the inquisition for exposing the
clergy and asserting the unity of God. Thus, in all
ages, has religion been employed as an instrument in
the persecution of great men. " Thus has superstition
incessantly disturbed the harmony of mankind, raised
up the most inextinguishable flam;s of hatred and
discord, arming the infuriate maniacs to strew the earth

gorged from her bosom. The bones of five millions of human
beings have covered the wretched countries to which the Spaniards
and Portuguese transported their avarice, their superstition, and
their fury. These bones will plead to everlasting ages against the
doctrine of the political utility of religions, which is still able to

manner of their persecutors." All of which shows clearly
the truth that, the wild delirium of fanaticism is as
incompatible with the calm tranquillity of reason, as
fire is with water.
Maukind will never be disposed to use their own
strength, or make free inquiry whilst an undisturbed
lazines·s, ignorance, and prejudice, give them full satisfac-
tion as to the truth of their opinions; but where there is a
sincere desire to elicit truth, she will never want profes-
sors; and she can never be wholly banished, exceptwhere
human decisions, backed by power, carry all before
them, putting men out of the way of truth by mere
force of authority; for when the Magistrate, the Church,
and the zeal of that numerous class who believe all that
divines tell them, unite their strength, the three make
the most formidable bond imaginable against the just
liberties of mankind.
In the different systems of revealed religion that
hitherto have, and now continue to distract the world,
the dogmatical machinery of the various churches, have
been nearly the same in all, admitting of no other proof
than what arises from faith and ignorance ; the first being
a quiet and sottish submission of the judgment, to the
guidance and control of others, who are deeply inter-
ested in the maintenance of those delusions which support

them,-submission of that judgment which the ruling
power of nature bestowed upon every individual, for the
study of her own broad book, in which alone is to be /
found the only true religion. " Father_9-a:r:_~~5'' of the
Jesuits, declared that he could very easily invent a much
better religion than any of those that now divide and
disturb the world, if he could only pick up a dozen of
scoundrels, who would submit themselves to be burnt in
defence of his notions."
A great poet has said, " that things naturally bad make
strong themselves by ill." So, in like manner, things
that are in themselves absurd and unnatural, are not only
strengthened, but rendered all-powerful by superstitious
folly and credulity, which, in the fulness of their power,
have shed oceans of human blood in supportof fantastical
whimsies, which have been turned into theological
dogmas, that are inconsistent with, and entirely beyond
the conception of reason, giving birth to the most
rancorous spirit of discord.
If any man of an impartial and enlightened mind,
should address himself to the contending parties in a
manner such as the follo\ving-" The men who lived in
the world three thousand years ago, appear to have been
better men than you are, and had no disputes about
religion, but served their God, or gods, just in any way
142 LECTURE IV.
they pleased, and with the only union required, the union
of affection amongst themselves,"-all that such a man
would get by this admonition would be, to be called
Atheist by both the hostile parties, and persecuted
accordingly.
To arrive at the purest standard of morality, it is
necessary that the minds of men should break the
shackles of superstitious respect, know the limits which
ought, and will, eternally separate reason from all the
systems of revealed religion, and remove the obstacles
placed against its progress by the corrupt legislator, the
priest, and the fanatic; the ~wo former will never fail
to exert their united influence in fostering and protect-
ing ignorance, as the surest means of giving stability to
their power; and it is hereby that they render them-
selves the most cruel enemies of the human race. Men
generally are more stupid than wicked; and in curing
them of the errors which arise from sluggish credulity,
we should cure them at the same time of most of
their vices; and whoever endeavours to oppose that
- cure, commits the crime of treason against human
nature.

making a vast majority of mankind become the fools of
the common folly, whatever that may happen to be,•
and the more foolish an opinion is, the more readily will
it be received as praiseworthy, and consequently, the
more dangerous it will be to prove its folly.
Nature speaks to man in the following language :-
" It is in vain, 0 thou fantastical being, to seek after
" happiness beyond the limits of universal matter in
''which I have placed thee; in vain dost thou expect it
"in those fanciful regions which have no existence but
"in thine own delirious imagination, which is filled with
" capricious systems and illusions, the baneful effects
" of an absurd education, inculcated in youth by selfish
"and interested men, who have taught thee to depart
" from the simplicity of my laws, which are mild and easy
'' in comparison with those of theological bigotry. The
" tyranny of the mind is unknown in my dominion:
"benevolence and humanity, the offspring of wise and
"equitable laws, are the fruit of the soil, and imposture,
" with his obscuring mists, are unknown in the land.
"As members of society, be kind, be just, be virtuous,
"" Grotius, in quoting Curtius, says-" The multitude, ensnared
by superstition, are more apt to be governed by their priests than
princes; and that kings and emperors have learnt this at their
cost, insomuch that to produce examples of this kind, would in a
manner be transcribing the history of all nations."
144 LECTURE IV.
"be merciful, and peace of mind will be your portion.
" But beware of the transient pleasure that arises from

In such language does nature cry aloud to ma~, but
sl1e calls in vain, while he continues in the besotted
belief of what his interested guides have taught about
fallacious divinities, the splendid trumpery of superna-
turals, and seeing visions, the workings of human fancy ;
--while he shuts his eyes to the physical realities which
surround him, and which never deceive his senses. Such
is the language ever held by unerring reason, which is
marked by the contempt and detestation of the priest,
insulted by the fanatic, and left unexercised by the
stupid devotee who follows those wild reveries that over-
whelm common sense, and which man can neither prac-
tise nor understand ; making it consequently a virtue to
favour imposture, which constantly endeavours to en-
trench itself artfully behind the rampart of truth. "But
the worshipper of truth will never compromise with
falsehood-the adorer of nature will not be the apostle
of deceitful chimeras, turning this world into an abode of
illusions,'' aud by a total departure from truth, reason,
and virtue, destroying the happiness of the human
race.
On taking a view of the numerous traditionary reli-
gions which have overspread the earth, 'all pretending. to

divine revelation, we readily allow the gross falsehoods
and absurd notions which the priests of all have impu-
dently imposed on their silly followers. Yet our own
priests, forsooth, must always be allowed to be such
faithful representers of truth, that we may as well deny
all historical facts as doubt the truth of things believed
on their authority. Priests of other religions, we know,
will propagate falsehoods to support their own interest ;
and knowing that no revealed religion will bear exami-
nation, they take care to have them guarded by penal
laws. But, I pray you, my friend, have not our own
priests done all these things?
We have only to consult ecclesiastical history, to find
that the worst of tyrannical princes nave been the most
sure of obtaining the assistance of the theologians of all
religions, even for the purposes of carrying on the vilest
and most barbarous designs, provided tl1e interest of the
church was promoted in so doing. And any prince,
having the good intention to forward and protect the
interest of pure natural religion, free from priestcraft
and superstition, was sure to meet with their most ran-
corous opposition.* In mixing up chimerical notions in

their religions-fooleries equally inconsistent with the
invariable nature of the All-ruling Power and the good
of man, they have even had the audacity to declare, that
the common people will never be influenced by, or satis-
fied with, plain and simple truths ; and therefore the
supernatural weapons of inspirations, visions, conference
with spirits, trances, extasies, miracles, and the fires of
hell, were absolutely necessary to keep them in order:
and from this foul source have issued most of those
absurdities which, to the shame and scandal of mankind,
have overrun human nature. " Indeed so doltish have
the laity generally been, and so seldom have they
thought of asserting their natural rights in matters of
~eligion, that they have commonly sacrificed to the
malice of the priests, all who have endeavoured to main-
tain these rights; and as often as the people have suc-
ceeded in throwing off one set of ecclesiastical tyrants, it
human race, all these different kinds of flagitious men, forced by
their private interest to establish laws contrary to the general good,
have been sensible that their power had no other-foundation than
the ignorance and weakness of mankind. They have therefore
imposed silence on whosoever, by discovering to the people the
true principles of morality, would have opened their eyes with
respect to their misfortunes and their rights, and have armed them

has been only to become slaves to another. Yet they
have ever been ready to join against any one who endea-
\ voured to set them free for all theological tyranny.* In
former times it is too notorious that, whenever a gleam
of light issued from a mind capable of discerning the
path of truth, it was immediately extinguished in the
blood of its author.
It is a sad, and I hope an unjust reflection upon
humap nature, that in the most ancient times of which
we have any any records, as well as in the present, the
bulk of mankind were held to be unfit to hear the truth.
Clemens of Alexandria declares, that the greater pagan
mysteries were open to none but men of superior rank,
education, merit, and learning; and Varro says they
were instituted for the conveyance of certain truths,
which it was not expedient the people should know.
Now, these mysteries detected and disclosed to the ini-
tiated alone the errors and absurdities of the vulgar
polytheism, whilst they taught the union of the Supreme
Being, or nature. Thus also Parmenides, in his Exote-

"' Aristippus says that, " to be able to think is to draw upon
ourselves the irreconcileable hatred of the ignorant, the weak, the
superstitious, and the corrupt, who all loudly declare themselves

rics, or books accommodated to the public taste, says,
" fire and water are the beginning or principle of all
~hings," as if he had acknowledged the creation of
matter; but in his Esoterics, or books composed accord-
ing to truth, he says, " the universe is one, in.finite, and
immutable."
The origin of man (as we have elsewhere observed) ,
and the ridiculous distinctions which vanity and selfish-
ness have drawn between him and the rest of animated
nature, have given rise to the wildest arrogance of con-
jecture, whilst what appears to be the plain and simple
truth in this matter, has been kept as much in the back
ground as it usually is in all points which admit not of
demonstration. The origin of man, and the propagation
of the species, perfectly resemble that of other·animals,
and the cause of the existence of all, is in the very
existence itself. If we examine the action~ and .
behaviour of many of those we call brutes, such as the
monkey, the elephant, the beaver, &c., it is perfectly
evident that they could not act in the manner they do,
,
without a mind and understanding; and these faculties
being proved in them beyond all contradiction, why
then, 0 ye fanatics, will ye deny them this undefinable
something, called soul, which ye say yourselves are

possessed of? Permit me to answer the question. It is
your excessive pride and self-love,* which are mainly
nursed and cherished by the illusions of a preternatural
futurity, which yout priests buoy you up with, in
exchange for the pampered luxury and ease enjoyed ,
by them through your credulity. Well, you at last
reluctantly grant that the other animals have souls; but
in making this concession, you contend, as your last
refuge, that such paltry half-inch souls as theirs, are not
worthy to be immortal, as those of men are, and con-
sequently perish with the body.t Here again is another
distinction that is equally worthy of the pride and self-
love of man, and of theological ingenuity, for it is the
pure offspring of both; but the truth of it is utterly
denied by nature and reason. This story of the soul's
immortality must have been unknown, or at least not in
" Lord Bolingbroke observes, that from an excess of pride, man
avoids and hates everything that in the least assimilates him to the
brute, and consequently gets out of sight when he performs the

books attributed to him.* It is true, that amongst the
ancient Chaldeans, Phcenicians, Egyptians, and Greeks,
a notion existed that the vital part of animals was im-
mortal (which probably had its rise in the Metempsy-

breath, since the body dies instantly when deprived of
it. The next difficulty was, of what is it composed ?t
Some said air, others fire, others ether; and a fourth
class declared that it was th_e requisite compound of the
above elements, adjusted by nature, so as to sustain
animal life; this was the pneuma of the Greeks, and the
anima of the ,Latins, to which they attached no other
meaning than simply the breath ef life, in all animals ;

the soul, in this sense, may justly be entitled to what is
called immortality. Philosophers reasoned after the
above manner long, before the time of Plato ; but he
gave a new light on the subject, by declaring that
the soul was a compound of the same, and the otlier,-a
most divine definition indeed! and admirably well calcu-
lated for the use of the fathers of our holy church; for
out of it they could make anything they pleased. It has
already been observed that, the obscure writings of this
philosopher was the ordinary source from whence the
fathers drew their mysticisms ; and in this instance he
has furnished them with the idea of those souls which
the theologians of the present times traffick in, and which
they turn to such excellent account.

In treating of impostors in this, and the foregoing
/
lectures on miracles, the writer distinctly and unequivo-
cally disclaims all intention of placing Jesus Christ at .f
the head of the impostors of Christianity, because he is
fully convinced, after the most impartial investigation of
the subject, that the person in question ought rather to be
considered as the Socrates, (in epitome), of the Jews,
and resembling in many points of character, and perse-
cuted virtue, several of the philanthropists of the present
day; for, like them, his whole aim and endeavour was to
release his countrymen from the superstitious thraldom
of their priests,-to establish amongst them a pure
and practical morality, and laws calculated to guide
them in paths more congenial to nature, and their
transfiguration, and others render unto the soul of the departed,
honour and worship, making a god of him that was not so much
as a man; as if the manner of men's breathing differed from that of
other living creatures, or as if there were not to be found in the
world many animals that live much longer than man. Now these
are surely but fantastical, foolish, and childish toys, devised by men
who would fain live always; the like foolery is there in preserving
the bodies. But what a folly of follies it is to think that deat/1
should be the way to a second life ! Certainly this foolish credulity,
and easiness of belief, destroy the benefit of the best gift of nature,
-death. How much more easy, and greater security were it for
each man to ground his reasons and resolutions upon an assurance,
that he should be in no worse a condition than he was before he

true happiness: that such alone were his views, is
proved to satisfaction in the single circumstance of liis
having all the priests of his day as his most bitter
enemies; and by them, and their blind-led abetters, he
was put to death for exposing the irrationality and folly
\
of their absurd systems. That such should be the result
of his earnest exertions to benefit mankind, is no way
surprising, for all experience assures us that, without
the protection of wise and equitable laws, no description
of priests that the world has yet seen, would have
suffered such a man to live, and be the occasion of
destruction to their trade; a consequence inevitable,
because his religion was too natural and too simple to
require a hireling priesthood. His doctrine was- the
system of nature, of which he appears to have been the
enthusiastic admirer, as may be shown from many of the
aphorisms and parables attributed to him ; such, for
instance, as that in Luke, chap. 6th, v. 48, where his
intention is to compare the follower of the religion of
nature to a man who lays the foundation of his house
upon a rock; and in the same book, chap. 12th, v. 2'1,
we have the beautiful simile of the lilies, evincing
thereby his reverence towards the common parent of all
existence.
As a follower of nature, he would have abolished
TRUTH, THE BEST BOND OF SOCIETY. 155
marriage, his aversion to which seems to have been
notorious amongst his acquaintance, and what he says
m Luke, chap. 20th, v. 34, lS confirmatory of that
aversion; but when he admonishes, as he does in
1\fatthew, chap. 5th, v. 34, saying, "swear not at all,"
he abolishes marriage in the most positive manner.
'Vhen he says, ''what God has joined together, let no
man put asunder," he assuredly means, that while mutual
love and concord join a couple happily together, no
man should put them asunder, because, in so doing he
would commit a crime against nature, in disturbing the
union of congenial hearts; but it is utterly impossible he
should mean to include, or have any allusion to, the vast
majority t f marriages, which are cemented by Mammon
and the priest, wherein nine-tenths of the parties turn
out to be mutual torments to each other. He was no
doubt desirous to render marriage that which reason
requires it should be, viz., a simple contract only, and
dissolvable at the pleasure of the parties; and so it was
originally, until the usurpations of the church made it a
sacrament, or divine obligation, thereby converting it
into that which the generality of mankind liave found it
to be-a life-lasting bond of the most woful description;
and so confessedly was it so, that the priests of former
times took special care to preserve for themselves the
156 LECTURE IV.
privilege of being exempt from its trammels. Matthew,
Mark, and Luke, state severally, that certain questions
were put to him (Jesus) regarding marriage and divorce;
and it is quite evident that these questions were put ,
solely with the view of entrapping him into such answers
as would have been contrary to the Jewish laws, and
thereby afford the priests a pretext for seizing him ; so
he seems to have been on his guard accordingly;
but as to the. precise answers which he gave to these
questions, the three K{angelists are as much at variance
with each other, as they are in almost everything el~e.
He must have been satisfied, that if marriage was
abolished, adultery could have no existence ; for the
former unnatural yoke, is not ,.only the cause of the
latter crime, but constitutes its criminality; carrying
along with it at the same time, thousands of other evils
which are entailed on a vast portion of the female sex;
-first, because the galling shackles of monogamy
prevent nearly the half of the male sex from entering
into a state, where misery is so likely to follow for life ;-
and secondly, because of the false and preposterous
odium which the perverse condition of society has
attached to poor unhappy woman, if she follows the
impulse of nature ; and if she resists that impulse, another
abyss of misery is before her, and she becomes the prey
TRUTH, THE BEST BOND OF SOCIETY. J57
of a certain malady, in the paroxysms of which, the
mode of gratification will not be much considered ; and
if the necessities of nature find not a remedy, the
unhappy sufferer falls the victim of a disease, fo1· the
cure of which the world is full ef physicians. He must
have been of opinion also, that prostitution is only a
consequence of marriage, for without the latter, the
former could have no existence : in short, he seems to
have fully coincided in opinion with two of the ancient
sages in regard to matters of love. Plato, in his republic,
abolished marriage ; and Zeno declared, " that women
ought to be unrestrained in their amour.s, in order that
that their children might be equally dear to all men.
Jesus evidently wished to annul paternity also ; as
appears from the admonition he gives in Matthew 23rd,
and v. 9th ; and he elsewhere declares that "all children
proceed from the spirit of nature, or God, and in regard
to himself, he never would acknowledge any other
paternity." _ I
The principal impostors in Christianity (Paul perhaps ~
excepted) arose some centuries subsequent to the time of
Jesus, and they have fallaciously reared up, and ascribed
fo him, a theological fabric, so monstrous, chimerical, and
absurd, as to be altogether inconsistent with his principles
and views-with tl1e generous exertions he made to
158 LECTURE IV,

the truth and simplicity of his doctrines.
He.was a teacher of such men only as would receive
the truth with pleasure,-he found few of these; but
that did not prevent_his tea5!hing, or, at least, his en-
deavours to teach that very system that was afterwards
held forth, and taught by Justin Martyr, viz, " that

Christ (or Chrestus, which signifies any good man), the
first begotten of God, means nothing else but reason, of
which all mankind are partakers; and all those that live
by or according to reason, though they are esteeJl,.led
atheists, and worshippers of no God, are Christians ;
and such were Socrates, and the like."
Every age, as well in ancient as in modern times, has
produced a few of these, the disguised or oppressed
friends and adherents of truth and reason, some of whom,
in one way or other, became the victims of priestly
rage ; and others, from possessing less of moral courage,
were reduced to silence, giving way to the torrent of
power, which is chiefly supported by men who even
glory in rejecting that light which reason offers to them;
whilst they are ever ready in supporting theological
speculations, which no one understands, and which
have so frequently disturbed the repose of the world,

tions calculated to give scope to knaves and jugglers, to
apply them for the purposes of deception.
The laity of the present day are become pretty gene-
rally acquainted with the audacious impositions of the
church of Rome, and are astonished at the childish
credulity of their progenitors; but they seem far from
perceiving, or duly acknowledging, the very few acci-
dental circumstances upon which depended the incom-
plete reformation of the church, which took place in the
sixteenth century. This rested wholly on the honest,
truth-loving boldness of two or three men, who happened
to be more enlightened than those around them; and
but for this fortuitous event alone, the mass of mankind
in Europe would have continued in the same grovelling
submission to knavery, and Catholic delusion up to this
very hour. And how were these men treated and
esteemed in their day, by the adherents of superstition?
The exposures they made, and their writings, were looked
upon, and treated by the whole Roman church, precisely
in the same manner as the writings of Thomas Paine
are now treated by the votaries of superstition through-
out Great Britain,-" Not all the devils in hell," cried
the Catholic priests, "can equal the blasphemous wicked-
ness of Martin Luther, and his impious adherents." But

bel10ld the result of this pretended wickedness ! The
reformed countries of Europe bear witness at this day,
of the salutary effects produced by even the partial
victory that was then gained over superstitious tyranny.
The reformers went but half way in the work that was
required by reason and common sense,-" they but
scotched the snake, not killed it." For in England, and in
Ireland, the church still forms an incubus that is almost
as grievous upon human industry as ever it was at any
former period. Still let us do the reformers the justice
t11ey deserve, by confessing that, although they did only
a 11alf of the work, they wrougl1t wonders, and it was
perhaps impossible for man to do more at the time, more
especially when we consider the extreme tenaciousness
with which mankind adhere to the superstitious follies
of early youth. They went great lengths in venturing
to expose the enormous extent to which clerical usur-
pations had reached; but any attempt at that period,· to
compel the clergy to relinquish all their temporal advan-
tages, would have been fruitless, and would have made
them fly to arms much more readily than even the
attempt to rend the veil wherewith they concealed the
truth.

STRATO AND MODERATUS.
Moo.-I have observed, Strato, that your opinions
on most subjects are strangely at variance with those
that are sanctioned by the highest authorities of the
church and state; and when a man differs so very widely
in his way of thinhlng from the generally received
notions of his countrymen, and those around him, his
reasons ought to be well founded, and he ought to be
sure in his own mind that there is no mixture of
affected singularity in the matter.
STRATo.-The remark you have just made is very
true, but if these reasons appear to him clear, satis-
factory, and conclusive, it is quite impossible for him
to tl1ink otherwise ; and one of our most enlightened

divines allows, that a man cannot believe and disbelieve
at pleasure, inasmuch as belief is not the work of the
will, but of the judgment alone, and arises irresistibly
upon conviction ; and therefore, to assert that a man
is bound to believe either one thing or another, is so
far from being true, that it is not common sense.
Mon.-I have no difficulty in granting your position,
yet still a man may be a good member of society, ful.
filling in an exemplary manner all the moral duties,
and glide quietly through life, while he believes, or
fancies he believes, in all those popular notions, which
you are pleased to call the preposterous delusions that
guide the great herd of mankind.
STRATo.-This is precisely the case with ninety-nine
in every hundred of the human race1 in all countries ;
they either cannot, or will not think for themselves ;
and it is in vain that nature sometimes sends amongst
them a spark of her own fire, to enlighten the mind of
genius and penetration, for every ray of the light of
truth gives offence, and they shrink with horror at the
idea of giving way to inquiry, so fettered are their
minds with the bands of e~y imp~ions, the ~­
j~ices of edu~~tion ;-this uniformly applies to the
weak and the ignorant, who are very numerous, and
not always confined to the working classes,-besides,

few will readily "separate themselves from error, when
vanity, the companion of ignorance, 11as rendered it
dear to them."
Mon.-Allowing what you have said to pass for the
present, still matters are not in reality the worse on
that account, for in every age and country of the
world, the lower orders of mankind have always been
weak and credulous, and their minds governed by an
order of men who are appointed and paid to think for
them ; and this condition of things forms one of the
strongest bonds of so~iety, for its peace and security :
so that which you complain of is so far from being an
evil, that I am reluctantly induced to believe, that the
more irrational and absurd the superstition is, so much
the better does it answer the intended purpose ; ambi-
guity, mystery, and obscurity, coming in as useful
auxiliaries, and are indeed the main pillars that support
the superstructure ; so here is a positive good arising
out of what you denounce as an intolerable evil. But,
to change the subject, what do you think of the
peopling of America ?
STRATo.-You might as well ask me how the oak
and the ash got there-who carried over the dogs, cats,
hogs, &c. &c., for I am quite satisfied that the same
power which produced animals and trees in the other

parts of the world, produced them in America also.
But why do you insist on having that hemisphere
peopled from Asia, when the proposition might with
equal propriety be reversed, in maintaining that Asia
was peopled from America ? The plain truth of the
matter is undoubtedly this, that the discovery of this
vast portion of the globe, was a stumbling block to the
theological worthies of our holy church, and placed a
considerable portion of the ground-work of their edifice
in a ludicrous point of view; for the heavenly in-
spirations of the early fathers of our church, did not.,
it seems, convey even a single hint of the existence of
that immense continent; but since the restless inno-
vations of profane science (which the church dislikes
above all things) did make that discovery, the priests
found themselves under the necessity of peopling it in
the best way they could, and in as straight a line from
father Adam as possible: so to work they went with all
the zeal and anxiety which the untowardness of the case
inspired ; but, working against nature, as they always
do, they have made a most bungling and laughable
business of it. If bishop Eusebius, of Cresaria, had
been alive, he would have peopled the western hemis-
phere with more address and plausibility than all of
them put together.
STRATO AND l\IODERATUS. 7
The thesis laid down is, that America was peopled
from Asia, and the antithesis goes to establish the
reverse ; but both propositions will appear equally
absurd, when we consider the perfectly different spe-
cies of man found upon each continent;* for the
white-skinned native of northern Asia, could no
more beget the copper-coloured, beardless native of
America, than a bull dog could beget a fox, - the
Negro of Africa, the Laplander; the leopard, the lion;
the ass, the horse; or an Esquimaux, a Hottentot, &c.
No one species could by any possibility spring unmixed
from any of the others, because of the specific dis-
tinctions made by nature herself,f and she has, in
* "None, but those who are blind, can have any donbt that the
whites, the negroes, the Albinos, the Hottentots, the Laplanders,
the Chinese, and the Americans," are altogether different species,
although they perhaps come under the genus Homo.
t The grandsons of Noah, as soon as they were landed from the
ark, had a Herculean task to perform,-the sons of Ham, for no
fault of their own, were exiled to the interior of Africa, and the
coasts or' Guinea and Congo, a distance of more than five
thousand miles, there to beget a prodigious number of children
of a species of Homo, entirely different from their own, with
skins as black as ebony. " Magog, Tubal, and Gomer, after sub.
duing Germany, Spain, and Gaul, had to propagate their own
species in begetting vast quantities of children, with white skins,
to people those countries, in a very few years. Even children in
the nursery now begin to laugh at such obscene absurdities."

authority, which it is not permitted us to doubt, that

STRATo.-All your deductions arise from your build-
ing upon false and groundless premises, and drawing
conclusions from such premises as never have for a
moment been admitted in the eye of reason; and as for
your Jewish story about the first man called Adam, his
wife Eve, and a serpent, to say nothing of its gross
impiety, it is too silly and ridiculous for old women to
tell in the nursery. A very few philosophers who
ventured fo exercise their own reason on this grand

much interested in upholding, there i~ no wonder in
their taking the alarm, and endeavouring, by their usual

Mon.- \Vhatever may be the subject under inquiry,
you seldom fail to reflect on the ecclesiastical order, as
a class of men who are chiefly blame~ble for the apathy
and ignorance of the lower orders of the people, and
perhaps for their vices also; but this is unfair and
illiberal, for priests are neither better nor worse than
other men ; and having been at the expense of learning
a profession, ·which is generally allowed to be one that

the smaller islands appearing to be only the tops of so
many mountains, separated by some efficient, but un-
known cause, from the continents, or greater lands
adjacent to them, to what are we. to attribute such
phenomena ?-whether to violent concussions of nature,
to earthquakes and subterraneous fires, &c., or to time,
and the slow action of the elements?
STRATo.-Although no portion of matter can be anni-
hilated, it is subject to continual change of form, from
its own inherent. or self-existing operations ; thus, that
part of our globe which we call land, is everlastingly
acted upon by that portion of its surface which we call
sea, or water. of which element there is a certain
quantity on, or belonging to our globe : and this parti-
cular quantity cannot, by any power whatsoever, be
either added to, or diminished. This portion of matter
then, of which the sea is the grand reservoir, is un-
ceasingly in motion, and by a slow, but sure process,
in co-operation with the elements of air and fire, is
continually reducing into a loose, or fluid state, those
particles which it had, perhaps ~s ef. y~ pre-
viously, laid as loose sediment, and which, after bei.ng
raised by accumulation to such a height as to be, in the
ordinary routine of alternation, left by the sea, be~tme
solid rock, from the action of the atmosphere, perhaps

owmg to the consolidating power of some unknown
ingredients thereof. Thus the perpetual action of the
element of water, together with the aid of other
physical powers, is unceasingly reducing, or unmaking
the land formed of old, in the manner as aforesaid (for
it is a demonstrable fact that all high land is necessarily
in a state of diminution), and forming other lands that
will again be reduced in endless succession ; motion
being essential to matter, and one of the properties of
its self-existence, of which it cannot divest itself. For
a solution of your doubt, therefore, I see no necessity
for having recourse to what are called convulsions of
nature, to which the geological changes that have taken
place on the surface of the globe, have been ignorantly
attributed, for they never do materially change the face
of countries, their effects being alway§ sudden, partial,
and by no means lasting.*

so that the universe is without beginning or ending: but always
remaineth in the same condition it is now in, equal and like itself:

situations, intervals, faculties, mutual swiftness and slowness of

12 DJA LOGUE.
MoD.-If the great changes that take place in that
part of the globe which is land, are caused in the way
you state, we must suppose a prodigious length of time as
by the name of universe, which appellation it obtaineth in that it
comprehendeth all things, being an absolute and perfect collection
of all natures, and besides the universe there is nothing, for al! is
contained in it, either as a part, or excrescence, and therefore it
stands in need of nothing besides itself, being eternal, perfect, and
permanent for ever. If we suppose the universe to be dissolved,
it must of necessity be dissolved into something, or into nothing,-
not into something, inasmuch as there would not in that case be a
total annihilation of matter,-not into nothing, for it is impossible
that something should either be made of nothing, or that any part
of matter should be annihilated. ·wherefore the universe can
admit neither production nor annihilation; and there can be nothing
without, or external to that which comprehends all things,-but
men and other animals, do in a more inferior manner finish the
progress of their nature, since they do not return to their first age,
neither have they a reciprocal change into one another, as it is in fire,
air, water, and earth; but after they have passed their several ages,
they die, and are dissolved, becoming in the same state as they 1vere.*
These, therefore, are arguments sufficient to prove, that the universe
remaineth perfect and uncorrupted ; as also that the excrescence
and results thereof suffer only a mutation, and not an annihilation;
there being no such thing ·as quies in natum, all things being in a
perpetual circular motion. Nay, that the figure, motion, time, and
substance thereof, are without beginning or end, and therefore
infinite. Nor hath man had any original production from the earth,
or elsewhere, as some believe; but hath always been, as he now
is, co-existent with the world, whereof he is a part.-Nature and
generation govern all things.

being requisite to bring them round in succession ; indeed
it is almost beyond human conception the idea of the
time required in such a slow process as you have sugges-
ted; for we find shells and other marine productions on
the tops of the highest mountains, and according to your
theory, these mountains must have been covered by the
sea, otherwise they could not have been formed by its
deposition or sediment : and by the same theory, these
mountain tops, so covered, and having these shell-fish
remains upon them, must have been in a loose, uncon-
solidated state, like a sand, or shell bank under water,
until they were gradually raised so high as naturally to
be above the medium level of the sea, and then hardened
into solid rock by the action of the more subtile elements.
STRATo.-The great difficulty, as well as the fun-
damental error in this matter arises, as you state, from
unfounded and false notions about time,-notions at first
invented and propagated by the sacerdotal orders of
former times, and now chiefly supported by their modern
successors, to suit their own ends ; they tell us that,
something less than six thousa_!_ld y~s ~go, there was
no sun, no moon, no stars, no earth, no matter of any
sort, and even no time itself; for they make God to say,

see before them :-and having thus confined within tlie
comparative period of a day, the very existence of nature

attempt to open their eyes to the light of nature and

they have changed its name, and called it ~ell.* The true

Mon.-According to this watery theory of yours, we
will suppose, for the sake of a case, that the Canary
Islands are the remaining tops of so many mountains, all
of which did at some exceedingly remote period, form a
part of the continent of Africa, and of course that the
peak ofTeneriffe was a huge mountain of that continent;
now, I wish to ask you what length of time this for-
midable agent, the sea, has taken to work its way so as
to effect so wide a separation between these islands them:-
selves, and between all of them and the main land of

STnATo.-The peak of Teneriffe cannot be considered
as any thing else than the top of a vast mountain, which,
in very remote times did (together with the other
islands around it) unquestionably stand in Africa, its
basis probal)ly still extending near to that continent, of
which, some half a million of years ago, it must have
formed a part, until a separation was effected by the
searching and never sleeping action of the sea. In
regard to the length of time that might be requisite for
the sea to wear so wide a channel between these moun-
tain tops and the main land of Africa, and such consider-
able channels between each other, I will not deal scru-
pulously with you, for if five hundred tl10usand years are
deemed insufficient for so great a work, you may double
or triple the amount. In alluding to a :!1,ood~ I suppose

Mon.-Whatever may be the apparent inconsistency
of our despising the Jews as a people, and at the same
time holding in reverence and adoration their sacred
writings, we cannot possibly have a doubt of the divine
origin of their books, impressed as they are, not only
with the marks of the very highest antiquity, but com-
mencing with the creation of matter itself; and hence
it follows that all other nations, even the most ancient of
the Pagans, must have imitated their religion, customs,
and traditions, varying all of them, according to times,
circumstances, and countries.
} STRATo.-Just the reverse of all this appears to have
been the case, as will hereafter be shown on the autho-
rity oftheir historian Josephus; and even by their Bible
accounts, if we admit them ; but the fact is, we can
hardly depend on the truth of any one statement con-
tained in their Pentateuch, as they deal in little else than
the miraculous, or the marvellous, and their stories are
scarcely ever supported by any corroborating historical

testimony. The first thing we· learn of t11em with any
certainty is, their slavery in Egypt, and herein for once
their own account agrees with what Tacitus and several
otl1er authors have said on the subject: as to how and
wli.en they became slaves there, is not so certain, but
from all that has been gathered regarding this point, the
probability is that, as a wandering horde of the desart,
they had entered Egypt for plunder, and were there
made slaves for their robberies, &c. : they still continued
to observe their own customs and habits ; and as the be-
getting of children was always a primary object with
them, they are said to have used every means to attain
this end, living filthily and incestuously together, until
they became so formidable, both from their number and
-·----~--
~stiness, that the Egyptian king determined on expel-
ling them. The species of leprosy they were subject to
(all lepers are more libidinous than other people) was
the scab, or scabies, as it is rendered from Tacitus, which
caused them to become loathsome to their Egyptian
masters. After this expulsion or flight from Egypt,

king of Egypt ever brought into the field the half of
that number of fighting men; however, it is certain that
at the time of this , expulsion, or flight, the Greeks, the
nations of Asia Minor, and all those of the east, were
great and powerful, while this outcast horde of freeboot-
ers wandered in the desarts around Mounts Horeb and
Sinai, having clearly no dialect, except such gibberisl1 of
their own as they had formed out of the Egyptian lan-
guage. Leaving this desart, and not· knowing where
they were, being as ignorant of geography as of every
thing else, they wandered north-east through Idumrea,
invading the Hebrew countries towards the lake Asphal-
tites, or, in the words of Tacitus, in the fifth book of his
history, " encroachi11g upon tl1e Hebrew countries and
borders of Syria." Now, mark well that, when Taci-
tus here speaks of "the Hebrew countries," he cannot
possibly mean any thing else than the Phrenician coun-
tries, whose language was the ancient Hebrew, which
had been in existence for many thousands of years be-
fore a Jew or an Israelite was known or heard of; at
least this much is incontestibly certain, that as !_n i!lite-
ra~5aste they could know nothing of the Hebrew wl1ile
they were in Egypt, nor until their invasion of the He-
brew or Phrenician countries, where, it appears by lheir
own account, they were afterwards deservedly ovcrpow-

ered by, and made slaves to these Hebrews, whose lan-
guage they adopted and barbarized to suit themselves;
and, agreeably to their usual endeavours to mystify ai:d
conceal the truth, they called this their bondage, or sla-
very to the Philistines, in place of Phamicians.
Moo.-It appears from the sacred records, that it was
the Hebrew language in which God himself wrote, or
dictated to Moses, the tables containing the Decalogue
and the laws, which were in that languag~ engraved on
tables by that legislator, together with all the books of
the Pentateuch; and since all this was done by miracle,
consistency requires us to believe that the Hebrew was
already prepared as a language by God himself, and
communicated to Moses for the express purpose of ful-
filling his will ; and this being the case, that language
would very quickly be disseminated not only amongst
the Jewish people, butalso in those countries where they
settled; this accounts for the Hebrew language being
afterwards found in use amongst the Pli.amicians, and
establishes the antiquity of the Jews.
STRATO.-You did well in calling in miracles to your
aid to solve your difficulties, as reason and the common
course of things would not serve your turn. But are
you not ashamed of the impious knavery of this

with God Almig·hty, and charging him with being a
party to crimes and villanies so derogatory to, and un-
worthy of the majesty and power of the Supreme
Being? The truth is, that since he himself and all his
followers were born in Egypt, it follows a~ certain that,
if he wrote any thing in the desart (laying aside your
miracles, if you please), it could be only in the Egyptian
language, because, allowing that he could write in any
other, it would have been useless to his ignorant people :
but the plain likelihood is, that with the connivance of
his brother priest Aaron, he could easily d~e t~
r].}Ele with a few hieroglyphics, cut upon blocks of wood
or stone, and give them whatever interpretation suited
his own ends. As to the matter of antiquity, their his-
torian, Josephus, has conceded that point, for in his dis-
course against Apion, after magnifying his countrymen
as being the first inhabitants of the earth, confesses that
he dares not, nevertheless, compare the monuments of
the Jews with those of the Egyptians, Chaldeans, and
Phcenicians, as the air of those countries, from being
less subject to corruption, was proper for preserving
written records ; which is as much as to say, that as no
other nations but the Egyptians, Chaldeans, and Phceni-
cians had preserved the old records of their originals,
he would not contend with them for antiquity, but only

l\:IoD.- 1 have no difficulty in allowing that when the
Jews quitted Egypt they might have few, or perhaps no
written records of their own as a people; but you are
not disposed to credit what they say in regard to the ex-
ceecling remote antiquity of that event, or even to admit
their just pretensions to letters and civilization, when
they afterwards became a nation.
STRATo.-There are numerous proofs in their own
books (some of which will be adduced hereafter), suffi-
cient to convince us that they had no books or writings
of their own until long after their guilty invasion of the
Hebrew country; and when, after a time, they had
formed their dialect out of that language, and committed
some of their traclitions or legends to writing, these
seem to have been concealed from all but their priests,
and rulers, at least the neighbouring nations knew

nothing whatever of their writings, until the second
Ptolemy of Egypt (to whom the Jews were then sub-
ject) demanded their assistance in making a translation
of their secret books from the Hebrew into Greek,
which was done accordingly at Alexandria, but in 'a
manner so untoward and against the grain, and with such
Istudied deception, that all the learned Jews of after
times, and many learned Christians have declared that
this Septu~t translation, which is our Bible, is the
most faithless version that ever was made of any book
whatsoever ;* and that such was the result is no way
surprising, as the eastern Jews of Judrea looked upon it,
as a sad national calamity, perhaps more grievous and
intolerable than any one of their many captivities, to be
required to disclose the mysteries of that pretended
theocracy which their crafty priests and rulers had taught
the ignorant to believe in, as being sacred and heaven-
descended. It is therefore not wonderful that the Jews,
thus tasked by an authority which they dared not to re-
sist, should deviate as widely from the original as the
nature of the task would allow. The learned Jew Philo,

in the rcvisal and correction of the Latin or Vulgate version of the

confesses that before the Septuagint translation, the ~~
Jewish writings were utterly unknown to other nations;
and, as this authority is undeniable, how was it possible
for those nations to borrow from tl1e Hebrew books,
which were not only kept out of sight and unknown, but
of a very recent origin compared with the allegorical
traditions and histories of the Egyptians, Greeks, Phre-
nicians, and all the nations of the east ?
Mon.-\Vhen you deny the great antiquity of the
Jews, and will not allow that they were either the
most ancient people on earth, or the most in favour
with the Supreme Being, can you account for the
silence throughout the Bible with respect to the pyra-
mids, in any other way than that they had not been
erected at the time when the Israelites were in captivity
in Egypt? If this is admitted as a fact, it will alone
establish a very high antiquity for the Jews, si~ce Hero-
dotus tells us that when he travelled in that country
about two thousand three hundred years ago, he heard
various accounts of their origin, most of which appeared
to be fabulous; and his account is corroborated by Dio-
dorus Siculus. It is also r.emarkabl~ that, although the
latter of tl1ese historians (and I believe the former also)
enumerates long successions of the ancient· kings of
Egypt, for some thousands of years before their times,

they no where, that I remember, mention the name
of Pharaoh, whicl1 leads me to suppose that this scrip-
ture name must have been a designation common
to a race of Egyptian kings, who reigned anterior to tl1e
times of the two Sesostris, Busiris, or even that of
Menis.
~TRATo.-Notwithstanding the evident endeavours of
the Jews to keep their origin out of sight, there is some
historical evidence, besides the proofs contained in their
own books, all of which are opposed not less to the
respectability, than they are to the great antiquity of
their origin. The first translator of Tacitus into English,
either out of compliment to the Jews, or to the church,
either omitted, or stopped short at the account which
that historian gives of that people; and subsequent
translators have not rendered him fairly, inasmuch as
Tacitus says that, "as an ignorant people, they assented
to put themselves under the conduct of Moses." And
again, that by whatsoever means their customs and
observances had been introduced, "they have no anti-
quityfor their patronization."
From the many proofs that may be quoted against th~
~nti~ of the books attributed to Moses, I shall here
for the present give only one, which is of itself beyond
all contradiction destructive of any such pretensions.
STRATO AXD MODERATUS. 27
In Genesis, chap. 36, verse 31, it is said, " And these
are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom, before
the children of Israel had any king ;" which shows
clearly that this first book of the Pentateuch could not
possibly have been written until after the reign of
several kings of Israel, and therefore it is only a fair
inference to conclude, when backed by so much concur-
rent testimony, that it was not written until after the
Babylonish captivity, and the restoration of part of them
to Jerusalem by Cyrus, who gave them leave to rebuild
their temple on their paying him a large sum of money
("for many of them had grown rich at Babylon by their
usual trade in old clothes and money clipping"); so with
this encouragement many of them returned to Judea.
After this period their high priests or pontiffs were com-
monly their rulers, and from this arose their division
into opposing sects, the never-failing consequence of
theological dominion; but having now the advantage
of adding some Chaldean to their Phrenician lore, their
scribes began to arrange their traditions for the short
time they had been a nation, intermixing therewith the
ancient fables of those countries where they had been in
slavery. But first of all it was necessary to forge for
themselves a more respectable origin than the true one ;
so they adopted the name of Ibraham, or Ibrahim, as

the name of the imaginary personage who was to be the
common stock or root of the chosen people. This name
is famous in Arabia and other eastern countries, and
signifies, in the Arabic and Chaldean languages, " the
father ef a people." The adoption of this name was
crafty and ingenious on the part of the compiler, but his
changing it into Abraham was a poor and petty disguise,
for the names are precisely the same. In order to raise
scions from this stock, Abraham is dispatched into
Egypt,* with Sarah his wife, whom, as the story goes, he
turned to excellent good account in using as the means
to secure both wealth and progeny. This is the plan
devised for the purpose of accounting for, and giving a
respectable origin to this singular people, fabricated and
put together after their return from Babylon, in or
about the time of Ezra and Hilkiali, who are supposed
by some of the learned to have been the compilers, and

years. But in the same book of Genesis, we are told that Terah,
his father, begat him, when seventy years oh!, and lived to the age
of t\YO hundred and five years; so that Abraham must have quitted
Chaldea at the age of a hundred an'd thirty-five years; and it cer-
tainly seems strange, that at that age he should abandon the fertile
plains of Mesopotamia for the far distant and stony country of
Sichem." From Sichem they represent him as going to Memphis,

others are of opinion that the whole mass was fitted up,
and arranged in the order we now see it, under the
superintendence of Esdras, and other scribes of the day.
Now, as it was six hundred years between the time
when the king of Assyria carried all the twelve tribes in
bon<lage to the countries east of the Euphrates, and ~1e
time when the two and a half tribes were restored by
Cyrus; if we add to this the time spent in their other
slaveries, together ·with their chronology while they
were a nation, under their judges and kings, we shall
find a period of not less than nine hundred years .(per-
haps it was much more) between the time in which it is
said Moses lived, and the restoration of the two and a
half tribes to Jerusalem by Cyrus. Thus, the Penta-
teuch was not composed until at least mne hu.!!£red
y~rs after the time of M~es.

rest on probability, or presumptive evidence only, which
is not sufficient in a matter of such importance. You
have no authority that I know of for alleging that the
Jews sprung from a horde of banditti, who had been
made slaves in Egypt for their robberies, and were
thence expelled afterwards for similar crimes; yet if all
this had even been true, they might still become the

this predilection. As you have said nothing in reply to
what I suggested respecting the pyramids, and the race
of Egyptian kings bearing the name of Pharaoh, I sup-

STRATo.-Enough has already been said to show that
the Jews, but more especially their books, can have no
just pretensions to a remote antiquity, and I have
farther proof to offer in support of what has been ad-
vanced respecting their origin. As for their being the
chosen and most favoured people of God, their own con-
fessed crimes and horrible narrations, their barbarous
cruelty and ignorance, and the contempt and detestation
i in which they were held by all the nations where they
f, were known, sufficiently testify against them.* Their
constant efforts to overcloud and disguise everything
relating to themselves, by change of names and varia-
tion of events, has been so far effectual, that it is diffi-
cult to reconcile the greater part of their writings with
any other historical testimony, and no person will deny
that they are often at variance with their own state-
ments, forgetting the old adage, that a certain descrip--
Jion of people require good memories. But if we take

a look into Diodorus Siculus, we shall find what is very
satisfactory, as what he relates to the following purport is
perfectly applicable to the primitive Jews, beingconsistent
with what Tacitus and others have written, as well as
with their own accounts. He informs us that long after
the death of the two Sesostrises, Actisanes, an Ethiopian
prince, invaded and conquered Egypt ; that at the time
of this conquest the country was infested by-bands of
robbers, who were probably some of the wanderi~g
hordes of the desarts; and King Actisanes being deter-
mined to get rid of all such vermin, collected together
all such of them as l1ad upon trial been convicted of the
crimes laid to their charge, cut off all their noses (some
say their ears also), and banished them into that desart
which is between Egypt and Syria, at the north-east
extremities of the Red Sea ; here they were in great
danger of perishing from the want of water, there being
very little except salt or brackish ponds around them.
In this predicament, however, they contrived to live for
some considerable time, by subsisting on quails, which
they caught in great abundance from the immense flocks
in which these birds make their passage, and tl1is was
done by entangling the birds in long nets made with

forcible possession of lands belonging to the Phrenicians,
whom, for reasons already stated, they called Philistines,
an<l, for the same reason, they have concealed the real
name of the Egyptian king who held them in slavery,
under the fictitious name of Pharaoh,*-a name which,
if I am not much mistaken, is not acknowledged either
in the fabulous or the authentic history of the kings of
Egypt, although the Jewish books seem to speak of
many of that name. But whoever amongst their scribes
might be the compilers of their traditions or legends,
they had good reasons for keeping the truth in the back
ground, for if the real name of the king who expelled
them, or permitted them to go, had been given, the time
of their departure from Egypt, and the true cause
thereof, would have been known by history, which would
at once have destroyed both their credit and their pre-
tensions to antiquity; fgr the same reasons, perhaps,
they have nowhere, that I can find, mentioned the

proper name of the man. It is true that Josephus mentions the
name of Pharaon as being an nppcllative common to the male line
of Egyptian princes.

the fact seems to be, that ,hey were erected long before
the time of this king Actisanes. Another of the kings
of Egypt, wl1ose name was Nileus, so far excelled all his

the great river, that, after his death, his name (Nile)
was, hy common consent, given to the river, which pre-
v~ously had been calle<l by different names, viz. Eagle,
Oceanus, F J yptus, &c. Now, at the time when the
Jewisl1 books were compiled, the river was known by its
modern name of Nile, and lest this fact should betray
the recent orig·in of the,se pretenders to antiquity, they
seem studiously to have avoided the name of Nile, giv-

while the Euphrates, Jordan, &c. go by their proper

little that is rational and intelligible in their mvn ac-

ha'l direct allusion to the expulsion of the Jews from
Egypt, for they themselves declare that they wandered
in thi; very desert for a great length of time, confirming

After the battle of hsus, when Alexander conquered
Syria and Phcenicia, the same historian mentions nothing
at all of the Jews as an independent nation, and there-
fore they must have been conquered by, and then in
slavery to the Phoenicians, who had them in bondage
three different times.
Mon.-You have said, in such terms as cannot be

so held them in slavery, should imitate the customs of
their masters, rather than be taken as an example by

these things as to leave them with a retrospect at conve~

during the very Eihort time they held, as a nation, a small

gous to suppose that matter itself must have been pro-
duced, or created, by an infinite power, and this power
being itself immaterial, stood in no need of materials to
\1.rork with, as it created every thing 011t nf itself, that is,
out of nothing.
STRATo.-It is just this superficial mode of drawing
inference from the works of man, that gives rise to the
idea of the creation of matter, because he cannot distin-
guish between nature anol a clock-maker; for it is the
invariable propensity of men to prefer the prodigy and
the miracle, to that which is naturally easy and reasonable;
and they either cannot, or will not, perceive the thou-
sand-fold difficulty of supposing a time when matter did
not exist, and that it was created out ef nothing, to this
plain, simple, and rational proposition, that it did always
exist in and ofitself. The word creation, in its common
acceptation, has therefore no proper meaning, nor does
it admit of any fixed definition, except when applied to
the creation of new forms, from pre-existing forms of
matter. We see nature, or if you will have it so, God,
in every thing; and St Thomas tells us that, " he is
nature, and the agent." This All-Ruling Power, then,
call it God, or nature, or by any other name you please,
(for names are truly nothing except in as far as they
serve to convey clear ideas, and tliat which is alone all

can be confo unded), must be in all places where there is
existence ; and is by, :md of itself, every thing that ex-
ists, filling every thing, and leaving no space for any
other substance : therefore, every thing that presents
itself to the senses, or of which the mind can possibly
form any conception, being material, or matter in some
form or other, it follows that every existing thing is
comprehended in this unbounded and Almighty material
power, which has been called, or designated by thousands
of different names, in the thousantls of artificial, and ever
fluctuating religions that have distracted the world.
MoD. -I imagine, as you have statecl, that no distinct
and rational conception can be formed in the mind, of
any thing that is not material; and even allowing the
absurdity of supposing that the mind can form any idea
of a thing that is essentially nothing, still it does not
11ecessariiy follow that matter is self-existeµt, self-ruled
and modifierl ; for all appearances in natnre seem to
warrant, and even to force us to the conclusion, that so
much harmony and order cannot exist without the direc-

principles dependent npon itself; an<l this power, or

STRATO.--If you admit that nature is the principle,
there is no room left for supposing any other existence;

the inherent powers and energies which govern matter,
all that man has yet discovered respecting them, are cer-
tain qualities, or properties which he has called by the
names of gravitation, repulsion, attraction, motion, &c.
and there are probably thousands oi other qualities be-
longing to matter, which are beyond tlfo powers of the
human mind to discover; all constituting t11osc immutable
laws of nature, or matter, and of which it cannot be
divested, not even by its own powers. And in all this
there is nothing more surprising than there is in water
running downwards, when left to itself, a property
of which n'o power whatever can divest it. Thus,
matter acting by its own laws, is the principle of prin-
ciples.

cynical sneering way, you have elsewhere said that man
has returned the compliment by making his God in

S-rnATo.-" This is as much as to say that, as noses
wear spectacles, therefore noses were made for specta-

Omnipotent Power, which rules every thing, made man
in its own form or likeness, had its origin, no doubt,
amongst those whose interest it always is to mislead the
multitude, (the-personifying of Deities being common in
the remotest antiquity) by buoying· up the false pride
and folly of men, between '1.rhorn, and their three Deities,
they have constituted themselves as the legal and antl10-
rized mediators. Man differs from the other animals in
the structure of his body, and is superior to them only
in some qualities, which are greatly improved in educa-
tion by the experience and combination of society, as
may be proved beyond contradiction, by comparing h:im
as the educated production of society, with what he is
in the wild, or natural state; for in the latter condition he is
so far from being superior, o; formidable, that he hardly
holds a middle rank with the larger animals, many of
whom look upon him as destined by nature for their sub-
sistence, and use him accordingly; and by the same rule
of right that guides man in such cases, viz. having the
art, or the force to subdue their prey.
44 DIALOGUE.
Mon.-To say nothing of what we call a diYine right
in man to the other animals, his superiority over them is
proved, in as much as no other is capable of reasoning
or speech; of calling assemblies, and holding consulta-

making written laws for the government of countries,
and, under the protection of these laws, to build cities
for national convenience and safety.
STTtATo.-In society man has now before him the
written learning and experience of his species for more
than tv;o thousand ye~rs, to whicl', if we add his natural
inger.:iity and subtility, arising from his large proportion
of brain, we will not be at all surprised at his having
subdued so many of the other animals to his own use and
service : but in doing all this by dint of combination in
society, has he truly improyecl his condition for the short
term of life which nature has allotted for him? Are not
the evils which spring from the present distorted condi-
tion of society, greater than its advantages? After sub-
duing the other animals, has not man left HIMSELF,
his own species to contend against, corrupted as they
are by false and ridiculous systems of religion, by unna-
tural and iniquitous laws which, in a great measure,
spring from those sources, and by a general hypocrisy
and falseness of character, which pervaclos society from the

highest to the lowest ?-Under such deplorable circum-
stances, let any man of candour and observation lay his
hand upon his heart, and honestly declare whether his
fellow men, and even those he calls his friends, are not
the cause and prime source of all his inquietudes and
miseries,-whether man is not the animal that he is
obliged to be more continually on his guard against than
any other ! These melancholy evils arise, not from any
thing innately vicious in his nature, but from the accu-
mulated mass of absurdity, error, and falsehood that has
overwhelmed society, and to which I have already ad-
verted; but it may be farther observed here, that all this
perverse degeneracy is chiefly to be attributed to a
general apostacy from nature and in place of her plain
and wholesome laws, men have substituted the arts of
insincerity and fraud, with institutions, manners, customs,
&c. the most pernicious to human happiness. In proof
of this perversion of nature, take as a single instance for
t11e pres:mt, the baleful effects of the laws relating to
monogamy, or single marriage, so pregnant with mis-
chief and misery to nine-tenths of mankind who unhap-
pily bind themselves by them ;--love constitutes the
chief happiness of all animals except man, to him alone

has been usurped by the church, where the priest, by a
few conjoining syllables takes upon him to unite amicably
together, dispositions of the most discordant nature, the
union of which may turn out to be as fire with water;
and that too by a bond which cannot be cancelled but in
death : but although tl1e priest may thus violate nature,
he cannot extinguish her : his two persons turned into
one, soon find that they not only continue to be two
still, but that they are at all points opposed to each
other; and then follows a scene of clouds and tempests,
where there is no haven of peace, and therefore ship-
wreck or ransomless captivity is the inevitable doom.
The only thing that could ever render monogamy at all
bearable, would be the liberty of divorce to the fullest
extent, at the instance of either party, but without that
remedy the intention of nature is thwarted doubly, and
the obligatory tie is a cruel and unnatural imposition,
standing as it does in full opposition to those free and
voluntary means which nature intended as the means of
procreation. This glaring fact daily presents itself be-
fore us,-that, the horror of such unnatural trammels con-
demns nearly the half of the female sex to that pining,
cheerless state of celibacy, that is far more than any
thing else, abhorrent to nature :- in youth men will

monly too strong for headlong inexperience; but in riper
years, people of sense and observation, who value their
liberty, will not readily be induced to commit themselves
so egregiously for life, well knowing that such a yoke,
under such conditions, is in the highest degree repug-
nant to nature, which teaches us that, if galling fetters
so contrary to ·will and conscience, cannot be removed
or rectified by law, they should be eluded by preven-
tion. " If law forbids the cancelling of cruel bonds?
nature directs us not to sign and seal them:" and,
" Since many are so bad, 'tis wisdo!l1 to beware,
And better shun the bait than struggle in the snare."
It is rernarkrv
ble that man should be the only animal on the
earth;. that has had the folly to bind himself through life
by shackles so inimical to, and subversive of his natural
liberty,-all the others reason better in marrying during
the season of love only, and the offspring is in little
danger, save from the rapaciousness of man. In short,
'marriage almost always represents nothing more than
the picture of two unfortunate human beings, who are
chained tog·ether, to be a reciprocal torment to each
other.'

although you draw ,your premises from nature, many of

the religion and other institutions of your country, or in
your attempts to show that, by disregarding· the obvious
principles of nature, man has become a mere artificial
animal in society, the patch-work of dissimulation and
superstition :-but these attacks are ill judged, and will
certainly gain you no credit, for even if the whole of
what you allege was strictly true, yet men neither can
nor ought to bear to be told such truths, because every
endeavour to lower or vilify an establisherl order of
things, whether that be in itself good or bad, serves more
or less to unhinge society. Auel you know little of
human nature, if you suppose yourself able to convince a
majority of the people you live amongst, that man is not

has bestowed upon him such excellent qualities of mind
and body, as show indisputably his vast superiority over

nothing but a pulp of marrow, which is the brain, where the original

seated, and the heart, which begins already to beat in this soft
pulp: this is the punctum sa!iens of Malpighi, part of the liveliness
of which does perhaps already proceed from the iofinence of the

next, which is divided into two parts by a partition, called by
anatomists the diaphragm. These parts being expanded, furnish

names.. of mind and reason, in man, exist to a certain
degree in all animals, and are even much more perfect
in some ofthem than they are in man; but his excessive
pride, and love of dominion, prevents his seeing and
acknowledging this truth, while he arrogantly contemns
all the other creatures ; and his interested teachers have
found out another name to express precisely that quality

INSTINCT; a term which, forsooth, we must never fail
to apply, when speaking of the mental faculties of those
animals we call brutes, lest they should too nearly
approach the dignity of the " lords of the creation;" and
herein they are right, for reason and all experience at
once confess the truth, that the sole difference is in the
distinction of terms. To deny mind and reason to the
dog, the bee, the ant, and hundreds of others, is as
absurd and false as it would be to deny that the eagle
had wings.* To judge of rationalty and irrationalty from

written laws ; I answer, neither had men, while they
were happy, and had not become victims of that society
which is now monstrously unnatural, with all its train of
follies and superstitions. If pride and prejudice would
allow, man would see clearly that many of the animals
even far surpass him in those reasoning powers of the
mind that serve as guides towards preservation and
health; for all the grazing classes have a perfect know-
ledge of the herbage that is deleterious to them, by the
smell alone; but to avoid what is injurious, man requires
generally to unite smell, taste, and experience, to guide
him in safety: many of the domestic animals have a fore-
knowledge that amounts to certainty, of approaching
atmospherical changes, impending storms, &c., for we
see that they provide against them, and are never de-
ceived. These instances show what may be called a
utility of mind, or a degree of useful wisdom that leaves
man at a distance; and many others might be quoted of
the wonderful foresight, providence, and reasoning'*
powers of those we call the brute creation.

Mon.-The true meaning and tendency of your argu-
ment is, to establish the fact that the dominion of man
over the other animals, is wholly and exclusively owing
to the following causes, viz.-the learning and experi-
ence of his species, handed down to him, generation after
generation, for more than two thousand years; his com-
bination in society against the other animals; and the
~unning and dexterity which his ample allowance of
brain naturally gives him. But, granting that he has
benefited by the writings of antiquity, and those of his
forefathers, still those writings are the effects of the
ingenuity of man, and cannot have any other ongm,
however far back you may trace them ; and it follows
t11at each succeeding generation have a right to avail
themselves of the advantages handed down to them by
their ancestors.
STRATO.-That the orang-outang and others of the

to the comfort and happiness of their lives, since it

appears pretty plainly that all the useful knowledge and
experience of former generations is handed down
amongst them (as well as amongst men), in a manner not
undeserving of the name of oral tradition ; for nothing
can be more evident than the perfect understanding that
is amongst them, and which is communicated most likely
by signs as well as by sounds; and for any thing we can
ever know to the contrary, that tradition of their's may,
in some respects, be more perfect than it is with man.
Mon.-I cannot account for your apparent wish to
undervalue the true rank of your own species, in the
scale of animated being, while at the same time you
cannot refrain from blaming them for exercising those
powers of bodily strength or dexterity, which surely
were not given them in vain, but intended by nature for
their advantage against their enemies. If it is thus you
mean to argue, it is wrong in principle, and in experience,
for it is quite evident that if man had not, in some way:
or other, subdued the greater part of the land animals,
they would have overrun, and exterminated his whole
race; so that his conduct herein is perfectly defensible on
the strong ground of natural right.

of the very few who are satisfied that nature never in-
tended man should eat the flesh of animals; yet it seems
a very common order of things that one animal should
live upon another; and the only excuse that I can find
for man's degeneracy in this particular, is the probability
that he began to kill and eat animals in self-defence, to
prevent his being devoured by them; and as soon as he
began to relish this diet, the priests with one consent
made the discovery, that the gods were much better
pleased with the grateful fumes of fat roasted beef or
venison, than they were with those of myrrh and frankin-
cense ; so these innocent and bloodless altars of primi-

the bloody priest, who, on particular occasions requiredthe

that is, the right of conquest, and no more. To account
for this conceited folly in men, we have only to consider
the early impressions that have been made upon their
minds by that long-robed class, whom they have the in-

again to divert your attention to other matters :-You
have wholly denied the creation of matter, and you
attribute the continual change of its forms, and new com-

is eternal, and motion essential to it, for then it follows
that motion must be co-eternal with it. There can be no
absolute rest for any portion of matter, and any
change, whether organic or otherwise, cannot possibly
be effected without motion. All things are so perpe-

But as for the numerous systems that have, and do still
pretend to particular revelations, all different from, and

they have borne-the rivers of human blood that has
been shed to support them against truth and reason. No
sect amongst all these various inventions can brook a
contradition, and much less endure that their doctrines
should be charged with absurdity and falsehood, and
their ceremonies with vanity and folly; for in these
points the priests will proceed to a degree of fury and

thereby endangering the very existence of those arts

the good things of the world, which mainly depend
on the belief, or at least the acquiescence, which their
preachings meet with. All things are sent them from
heaven, although it is evident they are human inven-
tions, superfluous, empty, and often ridiculous fictions,
frequently so far pernicious as to be hurtful to virtue
and public tranquility, as can be shown from history,
and all experience. If it is objected that it is not pos-
sible, that none of all their conflicting opinions should
be true, it is at least equally impossible that more

than one of them should be true. Their opponents,
the Deists, on the other hand, who cannot agree to the
ravings of theological theories, are abominated and
persecuted ; the fierce devotee would have them pl'o-
hibited fire and water whilst alive, and such is their
implacable hatred that they would have them eternally
tormented when dead, to effect which laudable and
humane purpose, they have invented a suitable place
for the end they had in view. Such has superstition
ever been when vested in power and authority, and its
+ cruelty and intolerance have always been commensurate
with its power.* It is, therefore, the reason of nature,
that every good and virtuous member of society should
use all his endeavours to pluck out the teeth, if he
cannot destroy this most pernicious of monsters, that
has abused in a certain degree the ignorant credulity
of mankind in all ages, and in a greater degree amongst
the Christians ever since the second century.
* In the true spirit of persecution, John Calvin, when armed
with power, wrote to the high Chamberlain of the King of Navarre,
of date the 30th Sept. 1561, thus: "Honor, glory, and riches, shall
be the reward of your pains; but above all, do not fail to rid the
country of those zealous scoundrels, who stir up the people to re-
volt against us. Such monsters should be exterminated, as I have
exterminated Michael Servetus, the Spaniard."

Mon.-By your own admission, antiquity will show
that mankind have always been prone to superstition,-
that tliey will stick by, and defend whatsoever sort of it
was first imposed upon their minds ; and although the
ground-work of the ever-varying religions was change-
able, yet notions of a supernatural deity, or deities,
entered into all of them; nor can such indispensable
apparatus be excluded from any religion that is calculated
to foster the love of the marvellous, and the faith in
prodigies, which is so much interwoven with human
nature,-it is preternatural weapons and machinery alone
that can act upon the hopes and fears of men in regard
to a future state. Now, you would overturn the present
fabric of theology, without substituting any thing in
its room, to answer the above purpose, except the simple
religion of nature and reason, which, by your own
confession, cannot be appreciated by more than one in
every hundred of mankind; thus you would not only
loosen, but altogether untie those bonds which churches
and states, with united power, have found so necessary
to govern society.
ISTRATo.-A very excellent philosopher informs us,
that-" In Pennsylvania there is no religion established
by the government; every person adopts the one he
likes best,-thc priest is no charge to the state,-the
STRATO AND MODERATUS. 61
individuals provide for them as they find it convenient,
and tax themselves accordingly; the priest is there,
like the merchant, maintained at the expense of the
consumer ;-he who has no priest, and consumes no l'art
of the commodity he deals in, pays no part of his
expense. Pennsylrnnia is a model for other nations."
In like manner I would have all religions, except
that of nature and reason (which requires no hireling
priests), made marketable commodities, so that every
votary, or consumer, might supply himself at that
preaching shop, where the article best suited his fancy,
and THERE to pay the vender for the quantity purcliased.
This woulcl be fair and reasonable. But to support the +
present profligate superstition, authority comes to stand
in the place of reason, and is the natural result of the
evil of having an established religion; and then comes
the tenfold evil of the adulterous connection between
that religion and the state, confirmed by laws which
were no doubt procured through the immense wealth
and power of the clergy in former times, when they
secured to themselves peculiar privileges and immuni-
ties ; and by the strength of that common interest, which
is exclusively their own, and is the strongest imagin-
able, they formed a distinct state within the political
st3te, in almost every nation in Europe, and these

sacerdotal states being firmly united, although at a
distance from each other, were often formidable to the
civil governments of Europe; and where they bear
sway and rule in the executive of any nation, as at
present they do in Spain and Portugal, that nation is
doomed to the most abject slavery, to ignorance, weak-
ness, degradation, and the contempt of other nations.
Witness the present condition of the two countries
above mentioned, -where the two millstones of knavery
and folly will grind on till some rational powers of
genius shall start up, and rouse the people from their
sloth and stupidity.
Mon.-ln every age and in every country of the
world, there have always been religions of some sort or
other, and of course there must have been priests
attached to all of them, to administer and expound;
and when men of learning are set apart for a public
office, a public expense will be incurred for their
maintenance.
STRATo.-The inference you draw from the position
laid down, is quite correct ; but have the mass of man-
kind in any age or country, ever freely and impartially
ventured to examine into the reputed necessity, or
whether there is really any indispensable obligation on
their part to support such establishments, which the

very few in every country, who are capable of just and
wise reflections, know to be wholly illusory ; and thus
to encourage idleness and luxury in this numerous class
of men, who eat up such an unconscionable share of the
earnmgs of industry ; while a vast portion of that ....\-
property which ought to form part of the resources of
the state, is ingulfed and squandered upon bishops, and
other dignitaries, who profess to be patterns of all that
is humble, poor, and self-denying, yet whose lives
generally, are so many examples of the full-blown vices
that stand in natural opposition to the virtues they
profess; and it is through their powerful influence, the
better to support that glare and pomp which dazzles the
weak vulgar, that the land is groaning with churches in
every corner,>K< with their heaven-directed spires, and
• To build churches and temples, says Zeno Citticus, is no
way necessary, for nothing ought to be accounted sacred by right,
or esteemed holy, which men themselves erect; neither among
the Persians of old, nor among the primitive Hebrews, were there
any temples dedicated to divine service, till at last one was founded
by Solomon, for which he is reproved by the prophet Isaiah.
Cornelius Agrippa also observes, that amongst the Gentiles there
were some very eminent for the structures of their temples; but
others there were who never made use of any, of which number
was Xerxes, who is reported to have burnt all the temples of the
lesser Asia, at the request of his magicians, esteeming it no less
than impiety to enclose the gods in walls.

all the other expensive and imposing decorations, so
well calculated to over-awe those who have been taught
to think what others think ; not how to think for them-
selves. All this, taken together, composes the enormous
fabric, called generally, the Church, at first invented by
Priests, in league with tyrants, supported from the
labour and sweat of the people, and dedicated to
theologic visions and chimeras.
Mon.-With all your strange hostility to churches
and their decorations, you never can make it appear
that the people derive no real benefit or advantage from
them; for even if we lay aside the obligation of their
divine institution, the mere erection of them diffuses
wealth, and affords employment for the necessitous, who
might otherwise be destitute; and besides this grand
object, we ought to make due allowance for the orna-
ment and grandeur which cities and towns receive from
such public buildings.
STRATo.-What hinders men from combining what
is nationally beneficial with the agreeable and the orna-
mental? Can we conceive any thing of greater utility,
and at the same time more ornamental than the cultiva-
tion of waste lands,-the conversion of those unprofitable
wildernesses into so many beautiful fields and gardens,
all conducive to the health and subsistence of mari ? In
STHATO AND l\IODERATUS. 65
England, the prodigious expense lavished upon the
monuments of superstition, in the shape of churches,
together with the church lands and revenues of those
fatlings, the dignitaries, would alone have turned a vast
portion of the waste lands in the kingdom, into culti-
vated and fruitful fields, and intersected many convenient
parts of it with useful canals, and defrayed the expense
of other national works of unquestionable utility; whilst
our ' tithe pigs metropolitan,'* with their trains of
subaltern drones, would have been taught to follow up
the \intentions of nature, by labouring for their sub-
sistence in the cultivation of mother earth, or other
employment that would be really useful in society.
You have said that this order of men are not to be
blamed for living by a trade that is generally considered
as being indispensably necessary :-be it so, but I say
again, let those alone bear the expense who are silly
enough to be led to believe that such institutions are at
all important or useful to humanity, abolishing all
established, or state religions, leaving every man at
*'Fleury informs us that, in the early periods of Christianity, all

liberty to pay his priest (if he keeps one) as it suits his
will and convenience; and then the article vended by
the preacher, will find its intrinsic value in the market.
To render Ireland flourishing and happy, nothing is so
much wanted at this moment, as the abolition of aH
favoured, or established religion, and a free trade granted
in theology.
Mon.-The church itself has always insisted on the
absolute obligation that states and communities are
under, by the fiat of heaven, to settle permanent re··
venues for the maintenance of the clergy, and for the
support of respectability generally, as well as to set the
whole concern above any dange~ that might proceed
from the alienation of the minds of men from its creeds
and dictates ; and without some such independent pro-
vision, I do not see how any church could stand against
the increasing numbers of those who are declared ene-
mies to all the systems ofrevealed religion.
STRATo.-The most formidable enemies of all tl1ose
religions which pretend to revelation, and the most
daring exposures of their absurd dogmas, have come from
amongst those who were educated for the church, many
of whom refused to take orders at all; and others, from a
rare honesty and tenderness of conscience, abandoned
the profession altogether, refusing longer to be supported

by an avocation which they considered to be, in no small
degree, inconsistent with truth and good morals; the
supernatural part of it, which is nearly the whole, being
a practical imposition upon the weak-minded portion.of
mankind. .This self-denial, and virtuous dignity of mincl
in those individuals, arose from the rare coincidence of
certain moral qualities,-viz., an incorruptible love of
truth, integrity of heart, with learning and genius
sufficient to distinguish between truth and falsehood.
In speaking of the ill effects and irrationality of national
churches, it must be readily allowed that there are many
good and virtuous men belonging to the clerical order ;
and although it cannot well be doubted that thousands
of them hold the same opinions that the honest infidels
hold, yet this is somewhat excusable when we consider
how society is constituted, and that falsehood is the
present goddess thereof; consequently, being thus sanc-
tioned, most of men will think themselves warranted in
leaving c~nscience out of the question, when an easy and
comfortable subsistence can be obtained by means which
they judge of no more concern than a temporal conveni-
ence. This is speaking of the subordinate functionaries
of the church, but how much more will those high digni-
taries exert all their powers by every stratagem to reduce --\
men's reason to those particular opinions which alone

their own profit and glory with so easy a bait as the
gullibility of the multitude; whilst by the united energies
of all, and the designing knavery of the greatest number
of their body, they will use the most strenuous endeavours
to secure themselves in the advantages arising from these
abuses, until men shall begin to open their eyes, and the
free exercise of truth and reason shall burst the mighty
bubble.*
Mon.-The immense riches of the church, which
constitutes its power,--the number, the learning, and
the common interest of the clergy, will support it in
perpetuity against all the innovations of reason and
natural religion ; but there is yet another sustaining
power which will never fail to stand by it so long as

t~ with devotedness and fervour, exercising at the
same time so subtle an influence over the weaker part of
the male sex, that I confess having some doubts on my
mind whether any one of all those religions pretending
to revelation would stand for twenty years, without this
never-failing prop; for it is equally important in all
superstitions, in all countries. A learned clergyman, in
writing to a female friend, makes this remark,- "it~
indeed, your sex should enter into the irreligious notions,
which now prevail too much among men, the next
generation would be irrecoverably lost," which is as
much as to confess that the church is in no danger
while it holds its deep-rooted impulsive power over the
female mind.
STRATo.-I quite agree with the learned divine you
have quoted, and his observation applies not only to the
church of England, but to all fabrics of superstition
grounded upon particular revelations ; for nothing can be
more notorious than that women have, in all ages, been
the upholders of superstition; owing in the first place, to
" their very nature, which is more weak and fearful than
the nature and disposition ofmen," (so says Hippocrates);
and, secondly, to the fanciful and timorous notion of the
superintendence of spiritual powers that are beyond the
pale of nature; to which may be added, the gaudy and

imposing pomp of ceremonies, all of which, taken
together, render the female mind as it were, a softer and
more pliant wax to receive the theological impression.
And hence it is that the zeal and devotion of the ladies
for their respective religions, appear to be exactly the
same amongst the Pagans, Jews and Mahometans, as it
is throughout the Christian world. Strabo makes the
following strong remark, - "It is a thing universally
taken for granted, that women are the ringleaders of
superstition ; they tease their husbands into all sorts of
worship of the gods, into the observation of feasts and
fasts; but it is a rare thing that any man, leading a
single life, isfound to be such a person."
I shall close my authorities on this subject, with a
quotation from the learned Selden. " When priests
come into a family," says he, "they do as a man that
would set fire to a house,-he does not put fire to the
brick wall, but puts it into the thatch ;-they work upon
the women, and let the men alone."
