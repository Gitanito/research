  		              		Experience Description   

    I just want to start off by saying I have a condition that causes my heart to shut down and almost stop beating. The condition has a very long name that starts with 'cardio' and ends with 'syncope.'  When this happens, I have out of body or NDE  experiences. I can’t say it always happens. But, I suspect I always have an experience,   but I just don’t remember all of them. I have recollection of 4 different experiences. 

  My first episode of this was when I was age 17. I had just gotten my wisdom teeth  out and was recovering at home. I got up to go to the bathroom.  I heard two  thuds and then I was in another place. The place was made of light and love. There were robed beings of light were taking care of me. My parents heard my body fall in the bathroom. They broke the door down and brought me back here. My mom told me that I was white as ghost with no life in me at all. It really scared her. I didn’t know what to make of the experience other than that I knew it was more real than real. I just tucked it away and went on my life. 

  My next experience happened at age 29. My  stepson and I were on a 4-wheeler ATV. I was driving and he was on the back. We were going down a hill pretty fast and I remember braking because we were going too fast to make  the curve  at the bottom of the hill. Something happened with the brakes because the next thing I remember was  standing on the hillside. Beside me was the 4-wheeler turned upside down and I saw myself lying face-down underneath of it. I didn’t pay much attention to  that scene  because coming toward me from across the creek in front of me were two beautiful, golden whispy-glittering lights. The lights came  got on either side of me and transformed into two beings. They were at least 8 feet tall, human-looking Beings  with pinkish, fair skin and dutchboy haircuts. One had straight platinum-blonde hair and the other had yellow hair with a bit of a wave to it. They both had white robes on. I was in awe !!!

 We went up very fast and in the blink of and eye we were in this wonderous place of bright-colored landscapes. There were  beautiful plants and grass. All of this was alive, like they were conscious plants. (That’s the only way I can describe it.) It was a place full of joy that even the plants were happy. 

  There was a white, walled city in the distance. There were some domed buildings on the other side of the wall. The two tall   Beings sat me down on  a bench and told me I had to stay there until they were done  talking to another very tall, slender, male person with short dark hari and who was dressed in a dark one-piece outfit. When they came back, I was told that I couldn’t enter the city.  I was devastated because I wanted so badly to go into the city.  I asked if I could come back here and they replied, 'Yes.'  They were very gentle and loving with me, but firm. Then  I was sucked back into my body. 

I was underneath the 4-wheeler and my stepson was trying to get it off of me. I don’t know how, but I raised up off the ground and threw the 4-wheeler off of me. It went tumbling down the hill. Fortunately, neither one of us were seriously hurt, but I was pretty sore and banged up. My stepson didn’t have a scratch on him. Later he told me that we slammed into the bank beside us and he flew through the air and landed unharmed. I have to say that this experience profoundly effected me. I knew it was more real than real and I couldn’t stay there despite  badly wanting to go back. 

   I was angry and very sad for years, thinking that I may never get to go back there. I have had a life-time of heart problems. As I’m writing this, I have survived 6 heart attacks, several stint placements, a quadruple heart-bypass and I have a defibrillator/pacemaker implant. I had a spell of tachycardia at work that prompted me being taken to the hospital. They preformed a number of tests on me what brought that on without success. In the process, it was the tilt-table test in which they found I had this cardio cyncope condition. I failed the test. 

  But when I did, I left my body to find myself in a twisty, turning  corridor. Above, was this beautiful multicolored light that was good and full of love.  I was chasing it. I wanted the light so badly, that all I could think about was to get to that light. As I was gaining on it, then all of the sudden, I pulled up out of there and above the area. I realized that it was a giant labyrinth. I was sucked back into my body on the table.  I  opened my eyes. The doctors were asking how I was. They told me I had failed the test in the worst way they had ever seen.  All could think about was how furious I was to be back here. I just didn’t want to be here. 

  My next and last NDE was the most profound experience ever. I had been having severe abdominal pain; so much so that I had to go to the emergency room  a couple of times. Then one morning I awoke to the severe abdominal pain. It was  worse due to severe  diarrhea and dehydration that was  life-threatening. My condition triggered a syncope episode that would not stop. I was fighting to hold onto  consiousness. It was so bad that my wife, at the time, had called 911 and a squad of first responders were on the way. I fought to stay conscious until they could get there. They took me out of the bathroom on some kind of wheel chair. They wheeled me to the gurney and asked me to stand up and get on it. I told them I couldn’t stand, so  they said they would help me. They got on both sides of me and helped me to stand.  I found out later that my body had fallen to the ground,  my eyes were wide-open, and my mouth was t making gurgling sounds. 

  Yet,  I was instantly in this place of golden light and pure love. I was standing in this area of light without boundaries. The love was incredible! I saw a group of people made of light. I  wondered who they were. As soon as I thought that, they instantly came to me. There were about a dozen people and two of them came  closer to me. One of person was a beautiful woman with auburn hair. She was dressed in a white robe and radiated light from her being. She was powerful, in-charge but full of love. The love surrounded us and it was in us. We were all connected in the love light. We began to communicate with each other. Instantly, I knew all about her and she knew all about  me. Then I realized that I was home.  I knew everyone and they knew me. 

  I’m crying as writing this. Every time I think about it it makes me cry. 

  This woman was my  grandmother and the male that was with her was my dad. It was not so much them as I knew on earth, but who they really are. They were the Beings I’ve known for an eternity.  They love me so much and I them. I realized this is where I’m from and where we’re all from. I remember that part of me has been away here on earth, at school. They were so glad that I was back. They admired me so much for being gone. I knew so much instantly, that I don’t remember anymore at this time. I can only speculate that I can’t know it in the physical state I’m in now. There was a flood of information,  images, and knowledge. 

  I inquired about Jesus. The answer came instantly. 'He is who he says he is and he’s coming back.' I inquired when.  I got the answer 'soon'. I was under the impression that they didn’t know exactly either, but they were excited about it. I kept getting a vision of an old farmhouse. It was dear to me but I don’t know why. I learned that we come here to earth many, many times.  I pretty much knew there were other places too besides earth. We come to earth to learn to grow up. We learn far more here than we can there. The pain and joy that we suffer here teaches us so much about  love and goodness by experiencing  the lack of it. It’s a powerful lesson we have to learn. I was informed that I was only going to be there until they got my body fixed up enough to where I could inhabit it again. I was devastated, again. I didn’t want to go back! But I had to go back. They laid me down in my body and the woman reached in to kiss me.  I was suddenly pulled away and left with one final message 'Trust in the Lord'. 

  I was sucked back into my body. My stepson was standing over me and shaking me yelling, 'Dad! Dad!' I was  in considerable distress. They had my feet above my head and couldn’t get a blood pressure reading and my heart rate was 30 bpm. They ended up air-lifting me to another hospital where I spent several more days.   I’m missing some days. I have no memory of them. 

  Years later I was in Tennessee with my mom, daughter and sister. We got lost  in the country and pulled into a drive to turn around. There in front of me was the farmhouse from my NDE. The house jwas exactly the way I saw it. And I haven’t told very many people but that beautiful auburn-haired woman, who was once my grandmother, is now my granddaughter. It’s just something that I know.  					  
  
  EMAIL1: When say 'inquired' that’s just the way I can relate to the situation. It was if I was connected to a part of a vast wealth of knowlege. I was able to access this when the  woman in my last NDE came in direct contact with me. Everything I wrote down is pretty much what I know or can recall. I can say that when I hear people talk on the subject of life and the subject of why we’re here, my soul resonates when I hear the truth. I just know it is the truth. It’s more of a subconscious thing. When I came back from my last NDE I was in poor physical condition. I don’t remember much about my stay in the hospital. I didn’t remember everything about my NDE like I do  now. My memories  came back to me a little at a time. I don't pretend to know it all or have any great wisdom. I just know at the time of my NDE I was connected to something that was all knowing and I was able bring back just bits and pieces with me.  I know there was so much more. I liken it to a person with amnesia who suddenly wakes up and realizes who he is but then loses it again, yet was able to keep a little bit of it. Actually, writing my experiences down on your sight helped bring it all back to me. I guess I’ve  repressed it because when I think about it I don’t want to be here. To be honest I’ve been broken-hearted about being taken away from there. I  know I’m here for a reason and I’ll get to go back home when I’m done here. It’s just that I miss it so much that it sometimes makes my life here harder than it probably would be had I not been back home and had to come back here. Part of me wishes I didn’t remember any of it. I wished I would have dug deeper into the information I had at my disposal but I was just so overwhelmed with joy throughout the whole experience. I felt overwhelming love, peace, and a sense of relief and extreme joy were common denominators in all my experiences. It’s hard to have had that and then have it taken away. From time to time, I’m still visited by the presence of that Love. It covers me and consoles me and helps me to continue on my journey here.  
  
  EMAIL2: I know who Jesus claimed he was from the Bible. He claimed he was the son of God. The answer I got,  confirmed what I already knew as a Christian. It was a confirmation that he’s coming back to earth. The energy I felt was excitement. The other side is waiting with anticipation for this to happen. I understood that it’s going to be a marvelous event. Then the woman held her hands up and put them together,  interlocking here fingers, much like a Quarterback does when he’s calling for a huddle. I understood that to mean that these two realms (here and there) are going to be one. I felt a sense excitement and wonderfulness . I asked when this would happen  and all I got was 'soon.' They didn’t know exactly when. That’s when I felt like they came over the top of me as if I were lying down. She reached in to kiss me and I was rapidly pulled away, almost like I was going down a drain. I heard an audible voice that kept telling me to trust in the Lord. The lord to me is Jesus Christ. I felt myself being sucked back into my body. Thats how I describe it. Think of a vacuum cleaner at a car wash. How it sucks air but when it encounters something large it plugs up the air flow with a thud. It’s  like a jolt. It’s like that when I come back every time. 
  
  EMAIL3: Reincarnation was something I just knew. Other schools of learning existed but I can’t say if I had been to one or not. I knew this wasn’t my first time here on earth. I knew I was much older and part of something way bigger than myself on earth. I know that we are immortal beings having to live successive mortal lives, but I don’t know why other than to learn and grow. I know this school will come to an end with the return of Jesus. I feel like there is more but I never got that information or I’m not supposed to remember it.  I wished I could make more sense of my experiences. In all of my NDEs, I really wasn’t given any instructions other than to trust in the Lord. Talking to you about this and writing it down has brought my experiences back to me. I was really hesitant to do this but I’m not in the best of health. On top of the heart condition I have, I’ve  survived six heart attacks; one was Massive and another was major. I have several stints and have had a quadruple bypass and I have a pacemaker/defibrillator implant. The bypass surgery is approaching 10 years out.  That is about how long it’s good for. I’ve already had to have one of my bypasses stinted. So I know I’ve probably not got a lot longer to be here. It’s hard to remember my experiences because it just reminds me how good it was. Honestly, I’ve probably went through some of the worst times of my life since my last experience. I guess I just want to have a record of it before I leave here. Maybe it will help somebody.

  EMAIL4: If you google RUFOS you’ll find the page roundtownufonsociety scroll down on that sight and you’ll find a link with audio of me talking to them about my experiences. I’m a memeber of that group and this is the only time I’ve sat down tried tell someone about my experiences, other than family.  I don’t think I’ve even told them everything.
