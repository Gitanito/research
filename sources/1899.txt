    Summary: &nbsp;  From Pat Deveney's database:

 Word, The. 
A Monthly Magazine Devoted to Philosophy,  Science, Religion, Eastern Thought, Occultism,  Theosophy and the Brotherhood of Humanity. 
1904-1917 
New York, NY.  Publisher: H.W. Percival.  Editor: Harold Waldwin Percival. 
1/1, October 21, 1904-25/6, September 1917.  64  pp.  $4.00 a year.

 The journal also lists Kegan,  Paul, Trench, Trubner & Co. of London as its  English publisher.  Percival (1868-1953) was an  astrologer and independent Theosophist, author of  the well-regarded Thinking and Destiny, with a  Brief Account of the Descent of Man into this  Human World, and, How He Will Return to the  Eternal Order of Progression (New York: The Word  Foundation).  The journal eschewed the flashier  aspects of the current New Thought and occultism,  and instead presented lengthy, thoughtful  articles (of a generally Platonic cast) on  subjects from the world occult tradition.  Its  purpose was set out on the inside of its front  cover:  "This magazine is designed to bring all  who may read its pages the message of the soul.  The message is, man is more than an animal in  drapings of cloth-he is divine, though his  divinity be masked by, and hidden in, the coils  of flesh."  The Word notably published a partial  translation of the Zohar, excerpts from Eliphas  Levi, and articles by Alexander Wilder (on the  story of his life and his relationship with H.P.  Blavatsky), Laura C. Halloway Langford, Paul F.  Case, C.H.A. Bjerregaard, and many others.  The  Word Foundation continued Percival's work and  published a journal under this name in Dallas,  Texas in the 1980s.  A large selection of  Percival's editorials from The Word is now  online, including his thoughts on Adepts, Masters  and Mahatmas, Cycles, Desire, Glamour,  Individuality, Karma, Mirrors, Sex, the Zodiac,  etc.   "The Early Writings of Harold W.
