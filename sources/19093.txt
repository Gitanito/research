some years ago
i was invited to go to a underground
research facility in el paso on the
mexican american border and this is a
place where they were doing
these sort of technologies that are
trans-dimensional but medical
applications
major stuff technologies are literally
electromagnetic trans-dimensional
technologies where they can if someone
had a missing limb
they can attach to the subtle body
the mystics call astral body but that
energy like you have phantom pain and
regrow it here&#39;s the issue
the same technology that gives you
that would give you
free energy to run your house because
it&#39;s in that same let&#39;s call it
constellation
of extraordinary technologies that they
want to keep secret so there are a lot
of
spin-offs beyond energy propulsion in
the environment
that will benefit humanity once we can
get the first level of this out because
it&#39;s unbelievable how backward
even our medical technology is compared
to what&#39;s possible
so that&#39;s also a very bit of good news
this is why i&#39;ve called for
sort of a
marshall plan for the planet for new
energy in the environment that is
supported and funded by individuals
in an open source way and not expecting
i think it&#39;s you know silly to expect
the government of the united states or
any other government to get behind doing
something that brings out
the most disruptive technologies in the
history of the human race let&#39;s be blunt
but it also creates a new civilization
and it saves our future
so if
this had been introduced slowly
from the early 20th century 100 years
ago
to now
we&#39;d be okay but now we&#39;ve run out of
time because what&#39;s happening to the
biosphere
geopolitically population boom so in
order to create
uh
you know enough change quickly enough
we&#39;re gonna have to do something very
different very
fundamentally different than what we&#39;ve
been doing
