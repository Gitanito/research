      Summary:  From Pat Deveney's database:

 American Society for Psychical Research, Journal of the
 1907  Monthly, then quarterly
 New York, NY.  Publisher: American Society for Psychical Research.  Editor: James Hervey Hyslop, Hereward Carrington, W.F. Prince, Frederick Bligh Bond, Frederick Edwards.  Succeeded by: Psychic Research -> Journal of the American Society for Psychical Research
 Corporate author:  American Society for Psychical Research
1/1, 1907-current.  22/1, January 1928-25/12, December 1931 were called Psychic Research, with volume 26 the journal resumed its original title and was published as a quarterly.

 The companion to this was the Proceedings of the society, published irregularly for material unsuited for the journal.  Since 1968 the society has also published a quarterly ASPR Newsletter from New York.  The A.S.P.R. was founded in 1906 (or re-founded, since there had been an earlier society of the same name that dissolved in 1905 on the death of Richard Hodgson) by James Hervey Hyslop (1854-1920), a member of the Philosophy Department at Columbia University in New York.  It is likely that Hyslop was the "J. Hyslop" who was among the founders of the Theosophical Society in New York in 1875.  Bond (1864-1945) was an architect, amateur archaeologist (he excavated Glastonbury Abbey with the assistance of messages from the spirits), occultist and psychical researcher.  His middle name commemorates the fact that he was the great-grand nephew of Captain Bligh of the Bounty.  He also edited Psychic Science and Survival.  Bond also published a series of booklets of automatic-writing communications on Glastonbury, King Arthur, and related subjects.
