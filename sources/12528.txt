  		              		Experience Description   

    I believe the following summary will be a book some day. It relates to the passing of my daughter at the age of 18. It began with a miraculous vision I had in 2008 of a bright blue butterfly on a black background. My daughter had a rare and incurable illness. We had many years of medical care including surgeries, tests, hospital stays, and home care. (I will use my daughter's middle name, Noel, from this point on). 

  Noel had this magnetic way with butterflies. They would follow her, land on her, and find her in unusual ways. People that knew nothing of our developing butterfly story would send her butterfly cards, jewelry, and more. Once we changed to a new (for us) children's hospital (Nationwide Children's). When we pulled up to the parking lot we noticed the logo with butterflies, with the most prominent being a large blue butterfly. It was not quite the same as the butterfly in my vision, but it was God's way of saying, 'You are on the right track.' We also found out that this hospital had just recently updated their logo to include this butterfly prior to our visit. It was during an extended ICU stay in 2015 at this hospital that Noel nearly died, but a series of miraculous events gave Noel her best few years on earth.  

  My vision in 2008 was accompanied by intense prayer and fasting. At first I thought that it was God's way of saying that she would be healed. As time went by, it began to seem like healing would not come quickly, easily, or completely in this earthly life. However, we continued to see signs of the butterfly. We did see some miraculous events throughout the years that extended her life, but Noel's last year on earth was a series of challenges that required the kind of care that only extended her life, without improving her quality of life. A couple of new life-threatening issues came up and after Noel turned 18, she made the decision to forego major medical intervention. 

  She entered Hospice care in March 2020. She had a peace about her decision and was very content for most of this period of time. Her faith matured greatly during this time. We listened to a lot of streaming Scripture and praise songs (her choice). I played a lot of classical or sacred guitar by her bedside. On her last day, she seemed a bit agitated, so I just sat at the foot of her bed and nervously fumbled through her prayer page on Facebook while her mother stayed by her side in bed. 

  While I was scrolling and reading encouraging words on her prayer page an image of a blue butterfly--exactly like the one from my vision (except on a white background), popped up on my screen. I quickly typed to my friend who posted it (whom I had not seen in more than 20 years), 'That's the one.' He was living in Hawaii and I was in West Virginia. I had not seen or spoken to him since college. I knew he would ask me later why I said, 'That's the one' and I would be able to provide more details. He later told me he did not know anything about my vision or anything about my daughter's unusual relationship with butterflies, but he said he felt moved to select that image to send us at that moment. No words. Just an image. A month or so later, I went back and took a screen shot of the image for proof.

  That in itself is quite interesting, but the final miracle of Hannah's life was the timing of her departure. While I was typing, 'That's the one' to my friend, my wife said, 'She just took her last breath.' I already knew this was the case, for when I saw that image of the butterfly pop up on my screen, I was filled with faith and peace--knowing that it was God who sent that image. My friend was just a conduit. The timing of the image was miraculous. I could sense her departure into the presence of God in a very real way. I did not see her go with my physical eyes in the same way that others with shared death experiences see. Rather, God gave me the kind of proof that I can show others with my saved screenshot and 12 years of amazing butterfly encounters.

  I am approaching the two year anniversary of Noel's departure. We miss her just as much as ever. The pain of loss is very deep. I don't think anyone really gets over losing a child that they knew so well, loved so deeply, and cared for so attentively; however, the way this real life story unfolded give me supernatural comfort even now, while I am typing. I can still remember that blue butterfly in my vision so clearly, as if it just happened moments ago. It's as if the image was permanently seared into my consciousness. It is the only time in my life to this point, that I experienced a true vision from God. I never doubted this vision, although at times it was very confusing--b/c I misunderstood its meaning. It wasn't until it was time for her to be transformed from her old earthly body to her new heavenly state that the vision made full sense to me.

Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?

During your experience, did you gain information about universal connection or oneness?         Yes     Yes, for the same reasons I explain in my story. My friend was connected to what was happening with us. He was in Hawaii while we were in West Viriginia.  

During your experience, did you gain information about the existence of God?         Yes     The timing of what happened gave me a sense of absolute certainty of God's presence.  

Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:       

During your experience, did you gain special knowledge or information about your purpose?      Yes   I knew when the blue butterfly popped up on my screen that it was exactly like the one from my vision 12 years prior. I knew without a doubt that it was God's message.

I knew without a doubt that Noel's existence was forever changed for the better and I could sense the release of her spirit from her body.  

During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?         Yes     I knew right away that it was meant for me to retell this story in as many ways and to as many people as possible.

Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          No   

After the NDE:       

Was the experience difficult to express in words?        No     

How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  The days and hours before, and the time after this seem somewhat foggy already, but that. We were sleep deprived and emotionally exhausted. But this special moment is crystal clear in my memory.  

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         Uncertain     I have had dreams since the event that involved a visitation from my daughter. These dreams seem very real. One involved here returning from heaven. I kept asking her in my dream what heaven was like. She responded with a peaceful smile and with a sort of mental telepathy (?) communicated to me without using her voice some of what heaven was like, but mainly was just telling me, "You will see, you will see." It was also as if she was telling me, 'I cannot reveal all that I know to you now.'  

Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          From the vision in 2008, to her departure and my friend's post at the exact moment of her passing, to the lucid dream that was more like a real visitation, I now see all of life on this side and the other as inseparably connected.  

Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    My wife was in the room when it happened and I showed her immediately the image. That is when she said, 'She just took her last breath.' I did not hold back, but immediately began telling friends and family. I called the man who send the image a couple weeks later.  

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       No     

What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real     I had no doubt at the time of the event that it was real.  

What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real     I have yet to have any doubts that the experience was real.  

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       Yes   dreams  

Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?         There are many more details about the butterflies, but none that pertain directly to the events of that particular night.
