The feeling is just so incredibly beautiful and miraculous for anyone to describe it. But it is so true, so loving, and so peaceful that I feel it has become a part of me. 

It was the sunny morning at around 11 pm on May 18, 2007. I boarded a bus to work in another city. I do not know what happened, all I can remember is hearing concerned voices around me all pleading with me lovingly, saying ‘Wake up!! Wake up!! Nothing will happen to you. Nothing will happen to your brain. You are a vipassaniya! Wake up, wake up! And woke up. I saw that the bus I was travelling on had been involved in a terrible accident, killing the bus driver and injuring many of us passengers. I was the only one who was flung from a front seat. My vision was blurred and the sound around me was dull. A man asked me if I wanted to inform a member of my family. I struggled to answer, but managed to give my husband’s name. Then I saw my blood soaked body covered with splinters. My leg was crushed badly. I fell unconscious. 

I opened my eyes, gasping for breath and saw myself amidst the doctors. I tried to make a sign to alert them to help me breathe saw the doctors and nurses cutting my clothes off. I tried to protect myself but gave up. Then a bright light appeared which had a soft male voice. It said ‘You will leave everything behind. Your loved ones, the hard-earned awards, money, even your clothes. You will come to me empty handed’. The light also gave me an important message and to remember it.  

My mother said I was unconscious for 3 days. My doctor and family told me I was in a near fatal condition due to my head injury. Anything could have happened to me from being left in a permanent vegetative state, to losing my memory or possible death. I smile because I was already informed by the angels. The accident rendered me disabled to this day. When people see me smiling, they wonder why I have a glow on my face. It is the glow of God. I feel very homesick and feel a sense of not belonging to this world. For I know this is not my home. I do not feel human. I have to live this life and obey the message until He calls me back. He only had love for me. It is very hard but I am trying my best to spread the LOVE and PEACE God has for all of us.

    Experience Description 3951  					</p>  					It was in May 2007 and I was travelling by bus from Mumbai to Pune in India. All of a sudden, I heard very concerned voices. I am sure they were females, perhaps 3 or 4. They said ‘Wake up, wake up! Nothing will happen to you, nothing will happen to your brain’. I got up and saw that the bus I had been travelling in had been involved in a terrible accident. I was able to ask someone to call my husband and then I cried out in pain. I fell unconscious. I woke up in a bright light that filled the operating theatre. The light spoke to me in a soft male voice and gave me a message.  

Three years later, in 2010, I had severe meningitis followed by face paralysis. It was at this time that the message made sense to me.
