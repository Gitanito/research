I had a sudden cardiac arrest at a tennis club on Friday 11/8/2013.  I woke up Tuesday, 5 days later, in hospital bed.  I was unconscious, or in 'cold coma' from the event until I woke. The experience is the only thing I remember.  It was very visual, through my eyes.  I was rocketed straight upward to a bright light.  It was like a different galaxy, or some kind of vortex in the sky.  When I hit the light, everything was backwards.  Up became down and I was then racing downward.  As it became closer to earth, which was in black and white, I started to see streets and houses.  It felt like a town but when I got closer, the earth then turned to blue and green in color.  Upon impact, the colors expanded into an explosion of blue and green.
