I recall being rushed to the operating room. After that, it seemed I was rushing through a long passageway, which was filled with colors and sound. The sound was a high-pitched yang-ying. It seemed to take ages to get to the end of the tunnel; however, when I did it was so beautiful. I was greeted by three people who told me they were to 'help' me over. They were in white and handsome, fair it seemed. Behind them I could see lovely flowers and rolling hills.

Background Information:

Gender:	 Female

Date NDE Occurred:	  5/25/1955

  NDE Elements:

At the time of your experience, was there an associated life-threatening event?       Yes         The child was in stress and not facial presentation, she was face down.  When I came back, two nurses were standing over me, one was massaging the womb area of my body her words were, and 'We thought we had lost you.' The doctor told me I was a very lucky person; he said he did not think either of us would survive.

Did you feel separated from your body?    No

At what time during the experience were you at your highest level of consciousness and alertness?       I was under some kind of drug so was therefore unconscious.

Did time seem to speed up or slow down?       No

Please compare your hearing during the experience to your everyday hearing that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.    See main narrative. I can recall them even today.

Did you pass into or through a tunnel?       Yes     See main narrative.

Did you encounter or become aware of any deceased (or alive) beings?       Yes     They were tall, attractive, light haired men. I didn't know them but they beautiful. They greeted me at the 'door' and we communicated by thought

Did you see an unearthly light?       Yes   When I came to what I described as, the doorway.

Did you seem to enter some other, unearthly world?       A clearly mystical or unearthly realm     Behind and around the beings was such peace and beauty and flowers and hills.

What emotions did you feel during the experience?       Surrounded by peace, it was so calm and beautiful. I didn't want to leave but I knew that I had to return and tell others that there was something for them.

Did you suddenly seem to understand everything?       Everything about the universe     They told me that 'everyone comes here'. My reply was, 'No, not me.' At which they smiled and said, 'Everyone.'

Did scenes from your past come back to you?       My past flashed before me, out of my control

Did scenes from the future come to you?       No

Did you come to a border or point of no return?       I came to a barrier that I was not permitted to cross; or was sent back against my will   As written in an earlier paragraph.  

God, Spiritual and Religion:

Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?       Yes     I felt stronger in my belief of Christianity. No fear of death, which is inevitable.  

     After the NDE:

Was the experience difficult to express in words?      Yes   I told my husband and he said he believed me but that others may think I'd gone a little mad so not to say anything. It took me several years before I could discuss it.

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?       No

Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?        I found the noise (ying-yang) and the floating a little upsetting. The best part was meeting with the welcomers and knowing that they made me feel safe.

Have you ever shared this experience with others?     Yes    As explained earlier although my husband said he believed me he was not happy with my ever discussing it. My mother was more receptive and I like to think that it helped her when she passed on. A girl friend's mother had passed away and when I told her, it helped her in her grief.

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?     No
