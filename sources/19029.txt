hello i&#39;m demi lovato
and i&#39;m dr steven greer and we are here
in joshua tree california national
park and we are going to make contact
with ets or we&#39;re going to attempt to
and i don&#39;t know if you want to tell
people more about that
um i do yeah please do you want to
mention what happened on your birthday
well yes so first of all um if anybody
uh has seen
the documentary close encounters of the
fifth pine or
has heard of the disclosure project that
was
started by this guy right here
and um if you&#39;ve seen those
documentaries
and i&#39;m talking serious unacknowledged
close encounters of the fifth kind
and you know exactly who he is but um i
i had watched all of those and
um for at my birthday i wanted to
try to make contact and i ended up
having
an experience that was just completely
like you couldn&#39;t debunk it and
um what i and six of
my closest friends saw was uh
just completely yeah and
you couldn&#39;t debunk it so um i wanted to
i immediately
um got in touch with dr steven greer and
um you know there&#39;s a really important
uh purpose that he has and
um and i think that if our audience is
meaning my my fan base and the people
that follow his work
kind of align together we could possibly
shift the direction of the planet into
a um more positive
direction so i don&#39;t know if you want to
explain a little bit more about that
yes so and what what demi was using was
an app called the ce5
contact app and so if you want to just
get that while we&#39;re doing this you&#39;ll
see
and it trains you to be able to use your
consciousness and mind
to see remote places but also contact
these extraterrestrial civilizations and
invite them or guide them into where you
are
and that&#39;s what we&#39;re doing and we&#39;ve
been doing this now for 30 years
and we have had literally thousands of
events happen
up to it including et&#39;s appearing here
in this area and making contact with us
and the purpose of what we&#39;re doing now
is to
try to get about one percent of the
world population
to be meditating and making peaceful
contact
which is the amount needed to make a
shift in the direction of the planet
towards a civilization
that is enlightened and peaceful and can
go on
in a positive way for thousands of years
so we&#39;re asking everyone to join with us
in
the meditation and we call it a ce5
contact global meditation and that&#39;s
what we&#39;re going to do here in a moment
and we invite everyone to to join us in
if you want to learn how to do it more
extensively there&#39;s a whole program
of training on the ce5 contact app of
how to do the meditation the remote
viewing
how to set up a team and it also has a
way that you can see who&#39;s in your area
so you can message them and form your
own group which is what we really need
to have happen
is you know millions of people doing
this together
so thank you demi and what we&#39;re going
to do now is i&#39;m just going to go
through
an abbreviated version of our the
meditation we do
and so we&#39;re just going to close our
eyes and we&#39;re going to do it for maybe
10 minutes or so
so let&#39;s close our eyes
let&#39;s take some deep breaths in and out
and with our nose and out with our mouth
and as we breathe inward see that you&#39;re
being filled with light
and consciousness and energy
and as you exhale let go of all of your
stress
and concerns as it is taken
in the purifying breath of mother earth
and with each inward breath you become
more awake
and filled with energy and consciousness
and light and with each exhalation
you become centered and calm
and deeply relaxed and as you begin to
just breathe normally
let yourself become aware of your
conscious mind
see the conscious mind watching the
breath
and become aware that that awareness
the conscious mind within you
is actually one conscious mind
in all beings it is infinite
and it is eternal
and as we do this become aware
of those around you and that they are
conscious
and even though each person is unique
and no two are alike the light of
awareness
is a singularity it is one
and we are all one in spirit together
and now become aware that this field of
conscious mind
deep within us within each person
is like a vast ocean that is infinite
and settle more deeply into the depths
of that quiet ocean
of clear light a pure
consciousness
and as we go into this quiet mind
acknowledge that it is omnipresent
and that this conscious mind is actually
cosmic
and has no limit in space and time
and therefore is boundless
being then aware of the true nature of
our conscious mind and self
we can awaken and see any place in space
or time with our own awareness
with our inner sight
so let us expand our sense of conscious
mind
to the circle around us
and into the earth
and we become aware that the earth is a
conscious being
who is female and she is awake
even as we are though not human
and we feel the love and the oneness of
earth
and then we become aware in our mind&#39;s
eye
the father sky
and of the space around the earth
and it is not empty space but it is
pure cosmic consciousness
infinite and all
star systems have planets
if they are stable stars with people
who are awake just as we are
and the universe is teeming with
intelligent life
and in this state of peace we
effortlessly rise upward
above the earth into father&#39;s sky
and as we go up above our homes
and the areas where we live wherever you
are on earth
you can gaze and see what is around you
and then as we go into space we see the
entire earth a beautiful blue planet
conscious pure love
spinning in the vastness of interstellar
space
and then as we rise upward we go out
by the moon and we may pause
there and gaze around our solar system
we see that on the moon there are
ancient structures
and on mars there are ones millions of
years old
from prior civilizations
and we become aware of the entire solar
system
and there are many extraterrestrial
civilizations
waiting for the earth to become peaceful
and as we rise further into space
we behold all of the space around us
as pure conscious light
and it is the same consciousness whereby
we are
awake at this instant
and it is one and we are one
with that cosmic mind
and as we expand further we go into
interstellar space
and our minds expand with our vision
so it encompasses the entire milky way
with hundreds of billions of stars
a spiraling galaxy and our solar system
is out on one of the outer spiral arms
and then in a flash of awareness
we go into intergalactic space
and we see the vastness of the cosmos
which is in fact infinite
and in this state we feel the love
and the purity of the vast
great spirit that has manifested all
that exists
and effortlessly we gaze across the
cosmos
and if we see a world or an
extraterrestrial starship
or a being from another planet
we politely ask to go within
and we say hello to them and invite them
to earth wherever you are located
and as we gaze into their eyes
without fear and without prejudice
we see the light of consciousness within
them
and we feel the light of consciousness
within ourselves
and we realize that we are one
and that we are all one in spirit
and in this state of clarity of mind
and pure heart we invite them
to where we are located
and wherever you are on earth
politely ask them to follow you in your
vision
because they have technologies that will
receive
clear thought that is pure of intent
and strong and emanating from deep
within
and so you show them our galaxy
and our solar system and the third
planet
from the sun the earth
and then you zoom in to wherever you are
on the earth
and you ask them to appear in any way
that it is
safe and appropriate for this time
and place and so you come
closer to your country
your region your town
your home and you show them in a clear
stream
of thought and consciousness your
location
and invite them here in a spirit of
universal
peace and ask them
as an ambassador to earth to their
people
to come and to meet with
us and to show themselves
in any way they see fit whether in light
or in a starship or as a person
or as an essence in thought
and as we show them our location
we share this vision with them
that in the coming years the earth
will take her place with the other
planets
and the time for the disclosure of this
information
has arrived and we must do this only
in universal peace
so thank you all and i appreciate you
doing this with us

steven greer
for everything that was beautiful it&#39;s
my pleasure
