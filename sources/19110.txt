the civil rights movement would have
never happened from the top down
let freedom ring from every hill and
molehill of mississippi
from every mountainside let freedom ring
and when this happens
it took a mass of people when will our
freedom ring
millions of people all over the country
when we let it ring from every village
and ever hamlet
from every state and every city to
change that
direction of our civilization out of jim
crow onto a society that is not perfect
is more open and inclusive than it was
he will be able to speed up that day
when all of god&#39;s children black men and
white men
jews and gentiles protestants and
catholics
will be able to join hands and sing in
the words of the only growth spiritual
free at last free at last thank god
almighty
you have to understand what cosmic
consciousness is what the nature of the
cosmic mind is
that is resonating within every single
human being
because that&#39;s the foundation for the
relationship between humans
and these civilizations
