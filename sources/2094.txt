THE FRIENDS OF TRUTH.
' l
MY BU.ovm> I'U.LOW TowwsuN,
A BOOK ' lias lately bee~ offered to yolir notice, under
the rather enticing title of " Awful Disclosures in .a
Nunnery: bY'· Maria Monk," which I have re&aon to
believe, baa been very widely circulated amongst you.
~ many highly respectable.pe~ns into '!ho~ hands
1t fell, were convmced,- from 1ts Internal evidence,.that
it.waa.a fo~ry, I am fully aware,~but that otheri
would take-for .granted_the horrible narrative to be
true, ia I~apprellend; too ~uch t~ be feared.. Permit
me then to·lay before you, a com~lete re'futat1on ofthe·
disgustina calumnies of_
this desp1~ble book from the
best possible witnesses·. You Will find .that the prin-
cipal part ofthis odious work, which has been wickedly
put together for the sake of the filthiest lucr~, was·bor~
rowed from an infamous ~phlet published in 1731,
entitled, " The Gates of .Jiell opened, or a develope-
ment of the secrets of Nunneries." Dr. Bartlett, a
respectable Protestant gentleman, the editor of the
Boston Post, has publicly pledged himself as to this
fact ;-and the editors of tlie Boston Pilot have offered
to make affidavit, that the above mentioned book was
lent by them to the publishers ofMaria Monk's" Awful
Disclosures," shortly befo1·e the appearance ·of that
· work.· I may also state, that whole columns have been
· publiShed iq some American newspapers, with pages of
the "lie" publisht:~ in 1731-and Maria Monk's story
in'1835, word for m~d alike !! I ··
The gentleman who signs his name at page 52 in tbia
pamphlet ." William t. Stone,". is a Colqnel Stone of
IV
New York, and I have it from the authority of one of
the most respectable Protestant gentlemen in Phila·
delphia, and one who is connected with literature ofthe ,
·highest class in this.-coun.try,. that ·CoJonel Stone is a
person. of the highest veracity and · uprightness of
character. Deeply grateful as I am bound to feel to
. this gentleman for his .manly and upright conduct in
this affair, I.canforgive.the unfavouraJ>le, a:nd as If~el,
unfounded prejudices .he entertains &gainst.our.faith,
· and pray sincerely, "Talis cum sis, utinam noster
eases/' . ..
The last part of this pamphlet offered to your candid
perusal, is, the documentary. evid~n<;e of var~ous.per·
sons mentioned in Maria Monk's book, or some way
itr;tplicated with·,it. · Yo~. will.not f~iLto. observ.e;; that.,1
many of the accounts:ARE GIVEN, UPON. O.t\'J'.H, .and·that,l
several·of the ,deponents are .Protestants.· Thit:body.
of evidence I:'consider.of·immense value; for.yo\\ must:
e~th_er- conclude.the whole of. those personf! who have·
sworn·to the truth of their statements, .both} Protes~t~r
and. Catholics, to·be.perjurers of the .blackest ,_die,~
·yes, deliberate, blasphemous.perjurers~r that M;ariai
Monk's account.is true!
Fellow· Christhins,..-God .is. my witneis: that: the;
cause of TRUTH is my only object m placing·this littler
pamphlet before you. If I had:reason to believe.that.
such a system 'of lust and: butchery• was..carried,.on,
within:the walls of.the Convent of the ·Hotel Pieu,.11s·
is represented; I would.hide ,my. " diminished hea.d:~
and blush indeed.. for the wretches, who un,der the.
hallowed g~rb of. Religion, cou~d perpetrate such
deeds ofinfamy as those charged upon them by. ~aria
Monk. . ·· • . . ·
Judge then for yourselves;. and. let your j:udgiJlen~
be formed upon an impartial and candid·investigation;
Act with ·the same candour you..will wish for.at the.
day when the ·Great God will sit in judgment ijpon us
all. · Let not religious prejudice, the.very bane·Qf f~a":

1 ~'The Catholics who raised .this money,• who built
and endowed these Churches, were a charitable people.:
I:ri their days, and before Henry VIII. and his rej0r1Mtl
Church had laid violent hands on·their property, there
was abundant provision for the poor; · ·Wherever the
poor were, wherever.they went, the doors ofabbe1• and '.
alms-houaeawere opento atrord them money,provt1ion1,
' medicines, and other comforts~ The revenues derived
from tithes were.divided into· four partst..:..one for .
thtt'
the clergy,.'one· for the repair and maintenance of.the
church buildings, and'one for the .pilgrim and atranger
and one for the poor:· This was the case ·in-' Catholic··
days; ·but when Henry VIII. and his ·new Church
seized upon these revenues, what did t}ley do 'I They ·
took all and divided it among themselves. 'The head
of .the Church took· a good.· share,' and divided· it
amongsthis satellites; the body of the Church took all
the rest and divided it amongst its satellites.·..:,It took
the moneyfor·the repair of tlte Okurchell; aflil tl.e
money·ofthe poor;·and threm both the Ohurche1 antl
the poor tfpon the country: . !fhis ~as :the first act of
the Church and·its founder....:..this the Church did in the
very infancy of its being. · While the Catholics 'who
raised all this wealth, had the ·possession and direction
of it,-··there were no Church-rates, there were no ~r,..·
rates, for there were abundance for all pu~ses ; but·
the moment this self-styled reformed Church seized it,
with the true spirit of tbe robber, it absorbed -all, and
left the poor to shiftrfor themselves." ·. . ··. . ' .'
. But I wish to otrer you an authority•.-of still greate~
weight. than the above-nam~ly, that of a Bish~p oftht:
Established Church, and he cannot of course be sup-
posed to_
be biased -in· favour of Catholicity. .B~shop
Tanner, m the preface of his celebrated account of th~­
Monasti~ Institutes, gives the following descriptio.n of ·
these establishments at pages.20 and 2~ - :- . ·. ·· ··...,

upon the road, lodged at one religious house; and dined
at another, and seldom, or never, went to inns. In
short, their hospitality was su~h, that_
in the Priory of;
Norwich, one tnousand five hundred quarters ofmalt,
and aboye ei~h~ hundr-:d quarters ·of. wheat, and all

by.making them,_first, monks and nuns, and in time,
priorsand prioresses, and ab~ots and abbesses.t Fifthly,
they were of. considerable advantage to the C~own :
I. .'By the profits received from th~ aeath of one abbot
or prior to the election, or, rather, confirmation, of
another. 2; By great fines paid for -the confinnation
or their liberties. 3. By many corrodies g~nted to_

many of them were really noble buildings; and though

admired in their times; aa ·Chelsea and .Greenwich

In commencing the exposure o£ Maria Monk's false.~o

· "From'the columns of a Montreal paper we leam~ .
.that the system, of.whi~h Rebecca ·.Reed was the firlt

son' of a .young woman of light mind and depraved
habits, oomed Matia Monk, a native of Montreal.

she admttted that she had uttered an untruth~ and that
in reality her father was one·.William·Monk, of that

insanity,-- to·which she was subject,;· her parenta had .
.kept her chained ~ a cellar .for four ~ra. : When it
.was remarked to her that her.person·bore no.marks of

·that her.mother took care .to .cover the.irons with s.oft
cloths to rrevent them ·injuring the skin. From this ·
·time.un~i ~uguat last Dr..Robertson,·last sight of this
strange story-teller. It would s~m, however, that in
.the interval she made her appearance.in Ne~ York; in
a very destitute condition, where she excited the in..

the.confidence they reposed in the ~o~urity of the livea
and conduct of the memhers of tl,eee in.Ututiont, by
committing their young <laughters to their cere and
instruction. , The conduct of the. Roman C holic
clergy in Canada deserves au e!Jually strong testimony
from us. We ~ave witnessed tl1eir courageous and
tmtemhtiug att~ntion to their duties, when an appalli
pc c: tiJ,~iwe twice swept oYer the land; we have
thf:m ~3 the preceptors ~f youth in the seminaries-we
have known them in tlie discharge of their mora limited,

these characters we are bound to say, that their conduct
lw.a been such as to command the love of their own
flocks, and the sincerest ~spect of the Protestant inha-
bitants _i.u>~1ards the Roman Catholic clergy.' .

" 'William Robertson, of Montreal, Doctor in Medi-
ciue, being duly sworn on the Holy Evangelists, dep'o--
seth and·saith as follows :-On th~ 9th of November,
1834, three men came up to my house, having a/oung
temale in company with them, who, they sai , was
observed, that forenoon, on the bank ofthe canal, near
the extremity of the St. Joseph suburbs, acting in.a
manner which induced ·some people, who saw her, to
think ·that she intended to drown herself~ They took
her into a house in the neighbourhood, where, after
being there some hours, and interrogated as to who she
was, &c., she said 8he was the daughter of Dr. Robert-
son. · On receiving this information they br~·Jght her
to my house. Being from home when they came to the
door, and learning from Mrs. Robertson that she had
denied them, they conveyed her to the watch-house! '
Upon hearing this story, in company with G. Auldjo, t
Esq., of this city, I went to the watch-house, to inquire
into the aftair. , \Ve found the young ·female, ~hom
I have since ascertained to be Maria Monk, daughter
of W. ·Monk, of this city, in .custody. She said that
although she was not my daughter, she _was the child
of respectable parents, in or very near Montreal, who,
from some light conduct of hers (arising from tempor-
ary.insanity, .to which she was, at times, subject from
her infancy), had kept her confined and chained in a
cellar for the last four years. . Upan examination, no
mark or appearance indicated the wearing of manacles,
or any other mode of restraint. She said, on my ob-
serving this, that her mother alwavs took care to cover
the irons with soft cloths, to prevent them injuring the
skin. From the appearance ofher hands, she evidently
· had not been used to work. To remove her from the
watch-house, where she was confined with some of the
most profligate women of the town, taken up for in-
eb~iety at}d disorderly conduct in the streets, as she
could· not give a satisfactory account of herself, I, as a ·
justice of the peace, sent her to jail as a vagrant.\ The
following morning, I went to the jail, for the purpose
ofascertaining, if' possible, who she was. After con-
.. siderable persuasi'on, she promised to divulge her story.
to the RevJ H. Esson, one of the clergymen of the
.Church of ~cotland, to -whose congregation she said

her.parents belonged.. That gentleman did call at tho
jail, and a!Jcertain who she was. I In the course of a few
days she was released, and I did not see her again ~til
the .montli of August ·1ast,. when ·Mr; Johnsqn, or
Griffin-town, joiner, and Mr. Cooley, ofthe St. A,nn'i
suburbs, merchant, called upon me about ten o'clock
at night, ·and after some"'prefatory remarks, mentioned
that the object of their visit was to ask me, as a magis-
trate, .to institute an inquiry int~ some very seriou~
charges which had been made against some of the
Roman Catholic priests of the place, and the nuns of
the General Hosp1tal, by a female who ba4 been a nun
in,that institution for four years, and who had divulged
the horrible secrets of that establishment, such as the
illicit and criul.inal intercourse between the nuns and
th~ priests, statipg particulars of su~h depravity of
conduct, on the part of_
these people, m th1s.respect,
and their .murdering ·the offspring of these criminal
connexions as soon as th~y were born, to the num~
her of f~om thirty to forty every year. I i~stantly
stated, that I did not believe a word of what they told ·
me; and they must have been imposed upon by some
evil-disposed and designing _
person. Upon in9uiry
who this nun, their informant, was, I discovered that
she answered exactly the description of Maria Monk.
·whom I had so much ·trouble about his~ year, and
mentioned to those individuals my suspicion, and what.
I knew of that unfortunate girl. Mr. Cool.
ey said to
Mr. Johnson, 'Let us go home, we are hoaxed.' 'l,hey
told me she was then at Mr. Johnson's house, ·andre-
quested me to call there and hear her own story. 'fhe
next day, or the 'day following, .I did call, and sa~
Maria Monk at Mr. Johnson's house. She.repea~ed in
my presence the substance·of what was mentioned to
me before, 1·elating to her having been in the nunnery
for four years; having taken the black veil; the crimes
committed there;· and a variety of other circumstances -
concerning the conduct ofthe priests and nuns. A·Mr.
Hoyte was introduced to me, and was present during·
the whole time that I was in the house. He .was re..
jlresented as one of the persons who had come in from
.New York with this young woman, for the purpose of
investigating into this mysterious affair. I was asked
. 18
to take her deposition, on her oath, as to the truth of
what she had stated. I declined doing so, giving as a.
reason, that from my'.knowledge of her c~aracter, I _,
considered her ~sertions upon oath wei·e not entitled
to more ·credit than her bare assertion, and that I did
not believe either; intimating at the same time, my
willingness to take the necessary steps for a full inves-
tigation; if they could get any other person to corrobo-
rate any part of her solemn testimony, or ifa direct
charge were made against any particular individual of
a· criminal nature. .During the first -interview with'
Messrs: Johnson and Cooley, they mentioned that
, Maria Monk haJ been found in New York in a very
destitute situation by so~e charitable individuals,,who
administered to her necessities; .being very sick. She
expressed a wish to see a clergyman, as she had a \
dreadful secret which she wished to divulge before she
died: a clergyman visiting her, she related to him the
alleged crimes of the friests and nuns ofthe General
Hospital at Montrea. After her recovery, she was
v~sited and examined'by the mayor and ~orne lawyers
at New.York, afterwards at Tro~·, in the State of,New
York; on the subject; and I understood them to say,
that Mr. Hoyte, and two other gentl~men, one of them
a lawyer, were sent to Montreal with her, for the :(>Ur-
pose of examining into1 the' truth of the accusations
thus made. 'Although' incredulous as to the truth of
Maria Monk's story, I thought it incun1bent upon me
to make · some inquiry concerning it, and have ascer-
tained where she has been residing a great part of th~
time she states havirig been an ininate of the nunnery.
During the.summer of 1832, she was at service ,at
William Henry ; the winters of 1832-3, she passed' in
this neighbourhood, at St. Ours, and St. D(mis. . The
accounts given of her conduct that season, corroborate
the opinions I had before entertained of her character.

" \Ve now come to the affidavit of the mother o( '
Maria Monk. It is ofgreat length, and contains some
minor details which do not materially strengthen the·
evidence, though they would do so were tl1at evidence
'of a less de'cided character. Many of these details we
shall therefore omit, giving only the tnost important .·
passages, · - · · .
· "The affidavit was sworn to on the 24th of October,
1835, before Dr. Uobert!Jon; whose own evidence the
1·eader has just perused, ·
" Mrs. Monk declares in this affidavit,-
" 'That wishing to guard the public against the de•
ception which has lately been practised in Montreal by
designing men, who have taken advantage of the occa•
sional mental derangement of her daughter, to make ·
scandalous accusations.,again!llt the priests and nuns in
Montreal, and afterwards to make her pass herself for
a nun who had left the convent1'
\'She proceeds to state, that in August, 1835, a man
named Boyte, who stated·himself to be a minister of
New York, called upon her and informed her,- .
. • I
"'That he had lately come to ~Qntrea1, 'v1th a young.
woinan and child of five weeks old ; thdt the woman

they were lod~ing, and left him with the child; he gave

pccted that tllis wal!l planned; 1asked for the child,
Rod said that I would pla~e it in a nunnery ; to that
Mr. Hoyte started every .objection, in abusive la11guagc :
against the nuns.: .
"Subsequently the child was delivered to her. ·Mrs:
Monk then sent an acquaintance, a Mrs. .Tarbert, to ·
.seek for her daughter, who was found, but.she refused
20
to go to her mother's house. The only.fact of import·
ance, in this portion of the affidavit, is, that M!lria
Monk had borrowed a bonnet and shawl 'to assist her
-escape from that Mr. ·Boyte, at the Hotel,' and she re•: '·
quested Mrs. Tarbert to teturn them to the owner.
" We now proceed to quote a further portion of Mrs.
Monk's affidavit:~ · · •. ,
'''Early in the aftetnoon of the sam~ day, Mr. Boyte
came to my house with the sa.-ne old nian, wishing me
.to make all my efforts to find the girl~ in the rru~an time
speaking very bitterly against the Catholics, the priests~
·
and the nuns ; mentioned that my daughter had been
in the nunnery, where she had been ill-treated. I·
denied that my daughter had ever been in a nunnery;
that when she \vas about eight years of age she went to
a day-school; at that time came in two other' persons, \
whom Mr. lioyte introduced; one \Vas the Rev. Mr. 1
Brewster. I do not recollect the other reverence's name.
They all requested me in the mosf pt·essing terms, to
try to make it out my daughterhad been in a nunnery~
and that she had some conuexion with the priests of
the seminary, of which numiery and priests she spoke ·
·in the most outrageous tPrms; said that should I make
that out, myself, my daughter and child, would be
protected for life, I expected to get rid of their im-
portunities, in relating the melancholy circumstance
by which my daughter was frequently deranged in her
head,. and told them that when at .the age of about
aeven years, she brol\.e a slate pel1cil in her head; th~t
.since that time her mental faculties were deranged,
and by times much more than at other times, but that
abe was far from being an idiot; that she could .lnake
the most ridiculot1s but inost plausible stories'; and
that as to the history that she had been in a nunnery,
·it was a fabricatiQn, for she never wP.s .in a .nunnery;
that ~ one time I wished to qbtaiu aplace in a riunnery
for her; that I had employed the influence of Mrs. De

cross, and refus_

absolutely refusing to
come to my house. Soon after, Mr. Boyte c~me and
demanded the child: I gave it to him. Next'morning .
Mr. Hoyte returned, and was more pressing than.in his
former solicitations, _
and reques~~d me to say that my
daughter.had been in the nunnery;-'that should I say
so it would be better than one hundred pounds to me;
that I would be protected for life, and that I .shotdd
leave Montreal; and that I would be bettcrr r·rovided
for elsewhere; I answered that thousands of pounds
would not induce me to perjure _
myself; then he got
saucy and abusive to the utmost; he said he came tO
Montreal to detect the infamy of the priests and nu~s.'
"'What follows is not )mportant, except that .: M~.
Monk heard a few days after that her daughter .was at
one Mr. Johnson's, a joiner, at Griffin-town, with
Mr. Hoyte, 'that he fassed her for a nun who had
escaped from the Hotc Dieu Nunnery;' and on further
enql.liry, she found that her daughter had subsequently
go~e off.with the said Hoyte. . ·

.. '.. '
In the course of a recent flying excursion through.&
portion of the province of Lo'Yer Cimada bordering
upon.the'St. Lawrence, it was both ~esirable. and 'con-
venient to pass a few days in Montreal. .The sojourn~
in good weather, upon ·that rich·'and beautiful island.o£
which the city bears the name,- could scarce be other-
wise than'pleas~nt to'the inquirin~ traveller, under any
circumstances. Doubly so was 1t rendered to us by
the kind attentions and ~ospitalities of intelligent .
friends,\who spared no pains in contributing.to .our
comfort, and ministering to our curiosity. ·
To an American who 'has riot " been abroad;''.. and
.whose eye is accustomed only to the light and .airy
towns and citie~ ofour own country, the narrow streett,
and dark, massive-built stone dwellings and store-
houses, erected with an eye rather to use, convenience,
and comfort, thari to the ~ratification of taste, or any
correct principles of arch1tecture, thecity itselfpresenta
few external . attractions. But its location is very
bea~tiful.-The island,.upon the south-eastern side of
which the city is built, is formed by the St. Lawrence
on the south; -and by a'branch of the Ottawa on.the
north. . Ii is thirty miles in length, 'f?y.ten and a half
in breadth ; constituting a very large seigniory, ,and
belonging .to the Roman C~tholic Semi:n~ry. ' .
Cl
26
With the ~xceptj.on ofa single mountain rising near
the centre, to the height of from five to eight hundred
feet, the island is perfectly level, and for the most part ,
in a high state of cultivation. The base and sides of
the.mountain are adorned· by the orchards, gardens,
villas,' and substantial countrlseats ofthe most opulent
citizena, while it is crested wtth a noble array of primi-
tive forest trees. The orchards are numerous and
thrifty~ producing an abundance of apples·of the finest
varieties, several of which were entirely new to me.
All the usual garden fruits are produced in great abund-
ance and perfection. In ridmg upon the side of the
mountain, and at the left, as we were climbing the road
that passes over it, among other fine country estates,
my attention was directed to an ancient stone edifice,
on the skirt of the ascent, surrounded by a wall, fo.~~-
"merly distinguished by·the appellation 'of the 'ChatP.a·u.
des Seigneurs de .Montreal, but now generally called
La Maison·des Pretres, or the Priest's Farm, as it
belongs to ~be .s~ipary, and is occupied as a summer
retreat and place"'of recr~tion during the warm weath~r.
:rhe grounds are ample, ·comprising spacious gardens
and orchards, .and all the members of th~ seminary,
priests, tutors, and ·pupils resort thither once a wt>ek in
aummer.
. From the summit of this mountain the view is ex-
.ceedingly picturesque and beautiful. The island itself,
and thf:' eastern sliore;...of St. Lawrence-pouring the
mighty _floods of thei'great lakes into· the Northen1
Oce~n-are thickly inhabited, to the extent of many
miles. The parish churches are numerous, and every
where sl\rrounded by the neat.white cottages of the
pe&s!lutry clustering around them. The rapid~ of
Lachine in a perpetual foam above the sweet island of'
the Nuns on: the south ; the charming island of St.
Helen's, with its fortifications.in front of the city, .and
the lofty mountains of Vermont and,. Chambly \in the
' azure distance on the east and south-east; with alevel
plain,' sprinkled with villages, farms, orch11tds, ,and
~rdens, all around from the St. Lawrence to the'
Ottawa, spl'¥.ding beneath ~he feet of the beholder,

enough-perhaps already -too much-Of ·description.
I will now proceed to.graver matters. - · ··
Among the religious and other public institutions of
Montreal demanding the attention of the inquisitive
stranger, the monastic establishments of the Roman
Catholics are not the least prominent. The history of
.Jionacltism, from the days of Paul the Egyp.tian;wbo
leads-the ,:an in the army ofthe monastic samts as the
first Christian hermit-to ·say nothing of the Esscnes
and 'l'herapeutes, the recluses of Palestine and l;gY},t
before.the commencement of the Christian era~is rich
in instruction and of absorbing interest. The 'first·
monastery was founded, according to the Romish.
legend-and the tale is a beautiful one-in the deserts
ot Upper Egypt, by the aforementioned Paul; in ·con-
nexion with ~t. Antony, in the year 303, '?r thereabout.
~"'emale monasteries, or convents of nuns, were insti-
tuted about a century afterward; Both have been at
times eminently useful, and both at other times emi-
uently·corrupt. They have served as places of refuge
from persecution, of retirement and repose from ·the ,
cares of the world, of religious study and meditation,
and as schools of learning,' benevolence, and ·virtue•.
They have :also at times degenerated into dens of de-
bauchery and crime. Still, .when we consider that it
was to them, for many cen'turies, that the world was
indebted for all it knew of letters and religion, and .that
they were the abodes of such meekand holy spirits as
Bede and 'fhomas-a-Kempis, it is not to be taken fo~
granted by every opponent of the Roman See·, .that a
monastery must necessarily be the vestibule of hell, and
every recluse worthy only of such an abode. ~ ; · ·;.
With such views and impressions,:! was ofcourseglad
of an opportunity oflooking at an'"~stablishment of this
description with my own eyes; and haying from m'y.
youth heard much of the Christian monastiCism of
Lower Canada, it may well be co~jectured that the ex-
dtement recently enkindled in the United Stat(:s against
the priests. and nuns of Montreal, by 'the startling pubf-
lications of Maria Monk, in connexion with the writing$
of sev~ral Protestant controversialists o~. ackno~ledged

communities. orthe verity or falsehood of the truly
"Awful Disclosures" of Maria Monk, I had formed no
very definite opinion previous to entering the province. ,,
Indeed I had not read the book in any other mA.nner than
by an occ_asional and very cursory glance at afew ofits
pages. Still I had read muchfrom and ofit, and heard
much more; and I am constrained in candotir to con·
· teAs that, although at times a partial believer, and at
others a sceptic, as to the truth ofher fearful revelations
of hypocrisy, lust, and blood," I was rdther a believer
than otherwise during the earlier part of my Canadian
. ~ . t
~~ -
True the tale was most revolting, and it was not &
little difficult to bring the mind to believe it possible,
that even the most hardened of our species could be
guilty, from y~ar to year, of the frig~tful abominationa \
charged by Miss Monk upon the·,priests and nuns of
Montreal; much less that the professed ministers ofthe
Christian religion, ofany faith, however widely they
might have strayed from the truth, or however deeply
been·plunged in error, or however much involved in
~he gross·and mystical fanaticism of the" scarlet lady,"
co~ld ·have been··guilty ·of the horrible ·succession of
crimes imputed 'to them. Still more difficulty was it to
1uppose it possible that woman, gentle woman, who
had·sought in solitude a protection against the corrup·
tions and temptations of the world, assuming a name
indicative of purity as well as its garb, could resign
themselves by whole communities as the ready and wil· .
lirig instruments of lust and murder. But, on the other
hand; ·my prejudices against the Catholic·faith were
strong. Its monstrous- corruptions in the old'W.orld
were notorious. · The work of Maria Monk I kn~w to
have been written by one ofour mos~ estimable citizens,
a gentleman of character and approved Christian piety,
who had taken every pains, ·as he supposed,' to record
the exact truth. -1 knew, from his own lips,· that he
.was a religious belie~er of all that:he had thulil wtitten.

heard that emissaries from the priestl were prowlingr·
uuout New York, nd that several attempt. had been
made to spirit the poor ~irl away, and bring her once
more forc1uly within their power.at Montreal. I had
heard ot' her repeated offers to go .to Montreal, and
establish the truth of her disclosures by examinations;
which propositions .had been refused. I had been
taught to regard the mysterious silence of the accused
as ominous of evil, and had been assured by numeroua
publications, that circumstances numerous and strong
had transpired, going to shew that extensive ~&Iterations
within the nunnery had been made, for the purpose of
preventing detection, should au examination ever take,..
place. A variety of incidents, moreover, had been
communicated to me a~ facts, while on the way to :
Montreal, which had materially streng~hened the im-__
pression upon my mind, arising from this formidable
array of circumstances, until I had almost arrive~ at
the belief that, after all, there might be more truth iu
the tale than I had been willing at first to admit. ..
I _
soon ascertained, however, that such was by no.;
means the opinion of the citizens of Montreal. I did,
not indeed expect to find t\le people generally, or even
the half ofthem, believers iu the entire revelations of.
the fair fugitive. But having been assured, from time .
to time, by the publishing friends of the interesting.
victim, t~at her work was causing some excitement iu
that capital, and that the army of believers ~ould be.
vastly greater bu~ for t.he terror in which the Protestants
were held by the Roman~sts, and the danger they would,
incur by the ~A"JH'P-ssion of any opinion unfa~ourable
to.thP-m, I did expect to meet now and then with some
one courageous believer, with a multitude of others
stealing timidly along, looking unutterable things, and
shivering and shuddering at every apparition of cowl
and cassock, as though expecting every moment to be
seized and pulled to pieces with hot pincers. But it
was not so. Such a city ofsceptics, in all that pertained
to the disclosures of the wronged frail one, was never .
before seen. Nay, more, so perfectly absurd and r.jdi-
culous did the people with one accord consider the
whole affair, that they seemed to look upon the i.Itel-
ligent denizens of the United States as labouring und~r,,
'
30
a widely extended monomania! There was but one
voice upon the subject; Protestants and Catholics,
those of every and. all denominations, hom and bred. ,
upon the spot; men of intelligence and unquestionable
p1ety, those who had passed the open gates of the Hotel'
Dieu, or looked from their casements over its ,frowning
walls every day of their lives-were all stubborn un._
believers; and I may &dd in,this place, instead of else-
where, that I was able to hear of but two believers in
the " Awful Disclosures" ·in Montreal, one of whom,.
as:~ill be seen in the sequel, was evidently afraid to
visit the nunnery' lest he should be forced by actual
demonstration to change his opinion. '
But the fact that the whole town an4 province dis-
believed the narr~tive of Miss Monk, was no good ,
reasori why I should not take a survey of the establish- \'
ment, in which the reported enormities were occurring,
more especially as there were at least twice the number
oil the Yankee side of the line (that is to be), who were
most .devout believers .of the whole. And as for any
auppose~ advantages derived l>y the former from their
,, n~ar, locatio1_1 and ac'<iuaintanceship with·the _ac~us~d,
d1d not the mcrease ot numbers on the other s1de brmg
the balance to an equipoise'? Perhaps not; but I was
determined in any event to visit the Catholic establish-
ments generally, .. and ,,look as closely into the fearful
Hotel Dieu as tlu~ guardians of its portals would allow
me to come. ,
'fhe friends accompanying us were A. Frothington~
Esq., President of the Bank of Montreal, and Duncan
Fisber, Esq. to whose kind. atten~ions we were greatly
indebted. Our first visit was to the Hospital General
des Sccurs Grises, a convent of the Grey Sisters
1
; an
institution founded.in 1750, by Madame de Youville,
as a refuge for the infirm poor, invalids, and the desti-
tute aged~ It occupies.a space of 678 feet along the
little .rivet· of St. Pierre, by nearly the same depth, con-
' taining a conveut for the residence of the nuns, a depot,
ample 'Yards for both sexes, all the requisite office~ for
auch ari'extensive establishment, and a detached build-::
ing for persons labouring under diseases of the min'd.

were filled with the lame, the halt, and the blind; and-'
every sp(~cies of decrepitude, and a~ong th,e ~ubjects
were mauy who .were very old. One of these,. wi~h
whom we c~mversed, ~ad not only been many years
an'inmate, but was cheerful at the ·advanced age of' one
hundred and.four years, having been born in th~ same
vear 'vith-Washingtoil. The eyes ofthe old centenarian
brightened at the recollection, as though it was no
mean honour even to have drawn his first breath in the
11ame year' with such a man. It was a gratifying spec•.
tacle to observe the kindness and attention received by
these aged and infirm fellow-beings, whom misfortune
had thrown upon the benevolence of this conunimity ;
an.d however much we may deplore the errors oftheir
religious faith, we could not but admire their zeal in
alleviating the distresses.of their fellow-men: ·
From these departments we were next led into the
rooms occupied as an orphan asylum, or foundling
hospital; I am not certain which; perhaps both. In
the first division we found some twenty or thirty boys of
ten years and under, and a like 'number of girls in the
aecoud. They were all cheerful; bpt much more viva:.
(!ity was exhibited in the second, characteristic alike of
females and the French. I~ each of the apartmeriti
visited, artiCles of fancy needle-work were produced,
11ales of w,hich are made for the benefit of the institu..
tion. '
'Ve entered the Grey Nunnery at il o'clock, ju11t
as,the sisters had ·~one to dinner. -1'he nuns, and the
11riests at the Semmary dirie at the same hour. They
take a very light breakfast at half-past 4, consisting or
a piece of bread and cup of tea; dine at 11, and are
summoned to the chapel,for their mid-day devotion•
at 12. With the ringing of the bell; we, by requestt
were conducted to the chapel; where the nuns having
entered first, were already upon their knees in a colurim
of two deep in the centr~ .aisle. They told their bead•,
and ·repeated their prayers. in chorus, and having c·on..
eluded, rose ata signal from the superior in the gall~ry,
wheeled round to the ~ight and left, and returned; scnrc11
raising their eyes from the polished floor. 'rhey weta

The habit of the grey sisters consists of a dress of
drab bombazine, made in the fashion of our Quaker
friends, only that the sleeves are long and ample, a Ia
Bisltop, ·terminated with broad cuffs of the same ma-'
terial. They·wear a ·black Italian crape cap, lined
with black silk.-This cap, too, is after· the Quaker
fash~on. '·While in the nunnery, I observed that the
skirt is always turned up and fastened under the waist
behind with a hook and eye. We saw them afterward
going in proce_
ssion to the Cathedral, and then the
skirts, I believe, were not thus turned up, but am not
,, . .
qmte certam.
. The chapel is a·very neat apartment, well supplied
with pictures none of which are good, and for the
most part very bad. The alter was richly gilded, and
adorned with vases of various freshly-gathered flowers.\
Among the relics displayed, was a fragment cut from
the veil of the sacred statute of the Virgin, if we do
not misrecollect, of very great antiquity. It is care·
fuUy frame4 within glass, together with the certificates
of its authenticity. ·
From .the Grey Nunnery we drove to the terrible
theatre of. the "awful disclosures," the Hl>tel Dieu
itself, the portals of which,- from the publications
'of- Maria Monk and her collaborateurs iu this city,
we might very well ,have expected to find guarded
by " gorgons, hydras, and chimeras dire." But it
was not so. The broad and ample gateway into the
yard was wide open, as -our kind companions assur-
ed us it always had been during the day time. ·•hese
thirty years, and how much longer they could not
tell. A very civil-Rpoken man met us at the door,
and conducted us into the hospital. This now sdcele-
brated institution fronts upon·St. Paul's-street on the
·east, extending along that str~et 324 English feet by
469.feet in depth on St. Joseph-street, from whic~ lat·
ter we entered. The whole buildings belonging to and
connected with the establishment include the hospital,
the convent, Ol" cloister, a chapel, kitchen, bakehouse,
'stables, and a cemetery. A large garden is likewise at..
tached. :It was founded in 1664, by the Ducbe'ss 0f'

Notwithstanding the favourable ·appearance ·of all
that we saw, and the universal scepticism before spoken
of existing among the people, I cannot deny the fact; \
that the publications already referred to had in some
degree prejudiced our minds against the inmates, and·
rendered us suspicious of almost every thin~ we were
to see. On entering the first ward, Mr. F. mquired of
thenurse in attendancefor Miss Beckwith, one of the
sisterhood who speaks English, and with whom he .Wa$
acquainted. After a few moments she came, and we'
were introduced to her. She received us with great
kindness~ Her whole appearance is extremely agreea-
ble. She conducted ·us to the chapel, through both
wards ofthe hospital, and through the apothecary's
apartment. Eve1·y variety of disease finds alleviation
here, without any questions .being asked as to sect or' '·
country. Iflabouring ·under a disease which is not ..,
contagious,·the patient is received on application, and ,
when restored, is dismissed without any compensation
or any questions being a$ked~ The.beds and rooms
were in perfect order, each bearing the mime of a Catho.. ·
lie saint) a male, if in the men's apartment, and a
female in that of the women. The :ick lay quiet· ,
ly in their respt>ctive beds, neatly curtained, looking
as if the hand offriendship and female sympathy had
smoothed and arranged them. All was still and serene~ ·
Can these walls thought I, .witness so much self~de..
nial and patience, so much toil and watching, without
expectation offee or reward on earth, and yet be the ·
abode of vice and profligacy, which it is shame even
.to name? ~s it possible fot beings depraved as these
have been reported ~o be; to find that pleasure in doing
good, which sustains them amidst all their privations?
Is it probable, is it at all te~oncileable, that persons
living. i~ habits of criminal sensuality, can be found·
disciplined in spirit as.to attend upon cases .of·disease
most revolting; and for·that class ofsociety too, which
D . .
\
34
exhibits disease in-the most revolting features, because
its subjects are destitute of refined feelings, and that
delicacy which con<:eals as much as possible what has,
a tendency to disgust <?f ·offend'? And this course of
conduct is not an occasional gush of feeling exhibited
before th.e world for . effect, but is undertaken as a
pei'Inanent e01ployment from which sic~ness or death
·only·.can release them. As these thoughts passed
through·my, mind, Mr. F. mentioned -Miss Monk's
book to ·Miss Beckwith, and asked her ifshe knew the
lady who had written it. She replied that the r~puted
--author never had been there as a nun,. though It was
.possible she might have been in- the hospital, as the
names of patients were never enquired: She said she
had not read the book, though she had heard of many
things.contained in it. She said she had herself taken\
the veil ten years since, and during that time had
never heard of Maria Monk. · She then observed, that
within the last few months strangers·. visiting the hos-
·pital had often enquired if there was a nun with them
~amed Jane Ray. She told them that she never had
heard ·ofone '!>y that name since she had been . there;
.bnt the.question being so often put, at length excit-
ed some curiosity and induced her to ask the su-
-perior, who told.her she had _never be~n .there! a_nd
they then bethought themselves of makmg an .enqmry
· vf Mrs. M'Donell, who _kept the Magdalen Asylum.
Mrs. M'Doilell immediately replied, that Jane Ray was
then in her establishment, and, I think, at the same
time mentioned Maria Monk as having be~n there also.
It was ·then, for the first time, and, from . Mrs.
M'Donell~ if~ understood Miss Beckwith correctly,
that they 1·eceived intelligence of the ·'Awful Disclo-
sures.". · In continuation, she remarked, that she had
neverre::.t! the bookherself; but from whatshe had heard
of its contents; she should. suppose that no one could
write -such details unless very depraved; and · a pure-·
minded person could not have imagined them. '·When
it was told her that the book was believed by many in
the States, sho said "the Protestants hate the Catliolics
so much, that they are willing to believe every thing
said against them. But," she ·added, "how can they
,believe such stat':'ments as these disclosures, when Mr.

Perkins has examined the cloister, for he is a very de-
cided Protestant, and in nowise favot,trable to our
religion." Still, on asking her if we could be permit- '
ted to extend our observations ·to other apartments, .
she said no. '!'his nunnery was a Cloister,·and neither
priest nor'layman, man or woman, was ever permitted.
to enter farther, unless by an express order from the
Bishop. Thus·in partwas theNewYork story confirm-
ed, that no e"aminatioil ofthe nunnery itself--its heavy.
iron d6ors and dark passages-its rooms ofprostitution
and vaults ofgloom-would be allowed. ·
In closing this account of our first visit, however, I
must be Jfermitted enpaseaftt to note the fine condition
and beautiful order ofthe apothecary's apartment. . It·
is extensive, and arranged in a manner that would
gladden the sight ofthe New York collt>ge ofPharmacy.
'!'hejars and gallipots .are .all of the ancient translu- '
cent dark blue and white china, of the same size and'
pattern, rendering the shelves perfectlyuniform.. Two
of the.nuris are in constant attendance on this establish-
ment,·. manufact~ing and preparing medicine. · They
also c~p and bleed. The physician in attendance.merely
prescribes, a.nd they execute his orders. Two of the
nuns are also in constant attendance upon each ward··
of the hospital, night and day; they take ~.heir tum•,
and in a community ofonly thirty-six, the occasion does
not seldom come round. · : ·;
·· Thus en'ded our.first visit to the Hatel Dieu, 1having ·
seen nothing of "maYks, hat~hes, racks, and vipers,"
nor exper-ienced any thing to remind us ofthe sanctum
officium: of Pope Innocent III., or of Torquem'ada.
Still we.had been permitted to proceed no farther than
the hospitals; ·an beyond was secret, silent, and myste-·
rious. · We had heard no groans: but some of the
l>eliev~rs in Maria Monk may suppose thathalfadozen
infants might have been very gently smothered, during
our visit, and' some pretty rebellious nun trodden to
qeath between two feather-be~s, for all that. Never-
theless, we took our departure, and proceeded next to
the cathedral, stan'ding aOfew rods farther to the north, .
on the left'of St. Joseph-street~ fronting upon Notre
Dame-s~reet,, an~ directly upon a diagonal · l~ne :from
the Ho~l D1eu to.·the semmary of the...Pr1ests, thtl
36
Cathedral well nigh filling the intermediate block be-_
tween them. The Cathedral isa new edifice, anJ is in
· .~ome respects th~ most sple~did temple in the ne11J
· world, and, as sa1d a late foreign traveller,··only sur·
passed by the old in interior grandeur. Its length is
225 feet, and its breadth 234. It was commenced in
1824, finished in 1829, and dedicated to the Virgin
Mary. The height · of its walls is 112 feet. The
architecture is of the rich Gothic of the 13th century.
Ithas six massive towers, between which is a promenade
along the roof, 23 feet wide, elevated 112 feet. There
are seven altars, and the east window behind the grand
altar is 70 feet high by 33 feet broad. The dther win-
'· dows are 36 feet by ·10. It is surrounded by a fine
terrace, and the chime of bells, the clocks,· altars, &c. \
are comparatively rich.
. But as a whole, the interior
. is not equal to the exterior' nor by any means equal, in
}>oint of taste, splendour of decoration; and beauty of
1ts p~intings, to the Cathedral of Baltimore. This
structure is larger, however, than that,of Baltimore,
being sufficiently capacious to accommodate .12,000
.persons. . My reasons fm: the particularity of this ·de-
scription.in this pl_£'1ce 'Yill appear i~ the sequel. I at-
tended h1gh mass m th1s noble edifice on two sabbath
mornings, before the commencement of worship in the
Protestant churches. .On both occasions the Cathedral
.was filled by as attentive and well-ordered a congrega- I
iion as I have ever seen in: New Yqrk. The organ is
too small for the place; but aided by other instruments,
and a full choir around the great altar, the ·'music was
as deep, rich, and solemn as. the big "base of the
ocean." · "' t
The Seminary of St. Sulpice, situated upon the cor-·
ner of Francois-Xavier and Notre Dame-streets, open-
ing·upon the latter, and directly west of the Cathedral,
was next visited. This is the general residence of the -
priests of Montreal, whose practice -~~ is accordjng to
Maria Monk, to be continually visiting the IlMel Dieu,
·for purposes of seduction and murder, by a subterranean
passage, which, if it exists, must lead directly under the
stupendous pile of the Cathedral just described. This
Seminary extend's 342 feet t:pon Notre Dame-street,
:-and 449 on Francais-Xavier-street.' It waf.f founded

in 1657, by the Abbe Quetus, .who was sent out by the/
Seminary of St. Sulpice, in Paris. The original'object
of the institution wets the ~ducation of youth, 'through
all departments, including tb.e higher branches of phi:-
losophy and the mathematics. It has an able'superior,
and professors of eminence in the different sciences,
who are said to pursue a judicioits plan of general in-
struction.' Jn order to extend iis nsefulness, anew col-
lege has been erect~d by the Seminary in the Recollet
suburbs~ large and han~om~ structure. · 1
· I was introduced, at the Seminary, to many ·of the
clergy and some of the dignitaries of the church, among
~hom ..were the Lord· Bishop M'Donald, of Upper
Canada,.and the Bishop of Red River, .both being on
·a visit t3 the lower province. I was also introduced to
Fatl1erRichards who figures ~n the·"AwfulDisclosures"
as one ofthe most humane'of the priests"
at the murder
of the nun St. Frances: ·Father Richards·is ·a short
fat per!jonage, has a mild blue eye,· and js exceedingly
fair spoken. He was once a Methodist Minister in
Virginia; ,but conceiving 'the project ofconverting the
Catholic Clergy of Montreal to the true faith, he pro-
ceeded thi.ther for that'purpose ; but in the end h~ was
as badly off as the Count,O'Reilly; who went to take
.Algiers-Algiers took him! Bishop M'Donald is a
Scotch gentleman of the old school, affable, intelligent,
and~ for a CathQlic, not intolerant. He allows his
people to read the Bible, and gives ,away all that he
.can obtain for ihat object In passing down the ~t.
Lawrence with him to Quebec, I found him to be ·a
niost·agreeable travelling companion. · . ;.
The subject of Maria Monk's "~wful Disclmmres"
having been introduced at the Seminary, those ofthe
clergy who spokeEnglish entered freely upon it, without
hesitaHon, and with an air of conscious innocence.
Hl!.ving intimated that there was nothing of,·in, or about
the.!Iotel Dieu respecting which th~y desired conceal-
ment, the idea first seriously occurred to me of putting
their sincerity, and that of the nuns, to the test, by ap-
plying_for permission to visH the cloisters, and make. a
thorough scrutiny. They, 1~pe~ted what had be~n said
to us by the nuns, that no person could be permitted to
enter the cloisters without au o1·der from the Bishop of
. ' ... D 2 · ·~ - · . '·'
. .
38
Montreal, who was then absent from the city. But
Bishop M'Donald !;lnd Father Richards entered at once
into my views, and· promised·their good offices in ob-
taining the necessary order as soon as the Bishop should
return. I assured them that my only desire was to arrive
at the truth, and that if I entered upon the duty, I
·should not be satisfied.without making thorough work
ofit: And thus I left them. .
.The more I reflected upon the subject, the more evi-
dent did it seem that the cause of truth and justice
required a~ my h~nds an investigation of this lc.ind,
placed there as I was, without any previous design of
making such a visit, and whollJ unnommitted and un-
connected with any of the parties to the controversy.
If the priests and t.he.nuns were actually guilty of these \
.fearful practices imputed to them, the truth·should be
'known. If, on the contrary, the horrible stories re:.. ·
·specting them were not true, the · slander, whether
originating inlthe malice of a wicked woman~ or the
distempered imagination of one who added insanity to
her frailty, should be arrested. .In any event; the
Cath9Ii~s were .as much entitled to justice as any other
sect of Christians ; a~d I could not but hope and be-
lieve, tbat in ' the event of being allowed to make a
tho'rough investigation of the premises, I could not
only arrive at a .satisfactory conclusion myself, but
should be able to aid in giving the public mind in my
ov.n country a proper direction. Should it- in the end
·appear th~t Maria Monk had told the truth, no punish•
ment ever invented l;>y the Holy Inquisition would be
too severe for such lustful, bloo~y, and hypocritical
vi~lainy. · But, on t~e ?ther hand, shou~d it be ~pp~~ent
that they were the v1cttms of calumny, It was high time
that the crusade should be at an end, since I could per-
ceive nothing more commendabk in Protestant than in
· ·Catholi'<: persecution._ Entertaining and pondering
'these view~. I sought and obtained an intervie~ with
the Rev. Mr. Perkins, ofthe American Presbyterian
church-:-the able, zeaJous,, and pious successor of.the
lamented.Ohristmas _in that city, and a son of the l~te
Hon. Enoch Perkins, of Hart~ord. Mr. P. warmly
approved :_of my design. · He had himself..visited the
cloiste·r~· as one,. of the co~mittee, in July, and was

smarting under the cruel attacks of the friends ofMaria
Monk in th~s city. He was therefore exceedhigly
anxious that I should haye the testimony ofmy own
senses;·to the correctness of fhe conclusions at which
he had'arrived, or discover \.0 him his error· ifhe was;
wrong. 'He did not hesitate ·to express to me his per- .
feet conviction, however, that an examination would
bring me to the unshaken conclusion, that, however
' bad the Catholics may be in other respects, or in other
countries, they are entirely innocent in this mattE>r.
There was no'mistake in his opinion upon the subject.
He had resided there several years-was well acquaint'-
ed with the general character of the priests and people,
as also by common fame with the character of Maria.
Monk--and he did not hesitate to pronounce her dis-
closures the'most entire and atrocious collection or lies
that could be conceived:' Thus believing-nay, thus
knowing-he had endeavoured, as strongly as he could
by letters to the writer of Maria Monk's book, to pre-
vent its publication. He had admonished him·of the
falsity of her tales, and implored him to desist.
Other Gentlemen of different Qhurches were also ,~on­
suited. Their opinions were the same, both as it ·re-
spected the character of the disclosures, and the pro-
priety of my proposed examination. The result was,
that rresolved on :making the attempt ; and retttrning
to Montreal from Quebec on Saturday mornipg, the
23d ult., I was informed that an prder for the admission
of Mr. ~rothingham, Mrs·. Stone, and myself into the
cloister, had been issued by the Bishop on the preced-
ing day. A Gentleman f:om Richmond (Va.) a Mr.
Shephard, with his lady, having understood our design,
obtainedan order through a friend) on that morning; -
to be permitted to accompany us in the visitation.· ·
The editors of the Montreal Gazette and the .Ami
du Peuple, ,in calling for the present narrative, have
both taken occasion·to introduce the name of the Rev.
Mr. Clary, a congregational clergyman recently from
this State, and now the pastor of a congregation in that
city.' Regretting as I do, that the name of that gentle- -
mim'should have been thus orought. before the public,
the duty is nevertheless devolved upon me 'ofmaking
an explanation, in justice to bot~ of us, and to all.
40
On the morning of the day appointed for the explora-
tion of the Nunnery, Mr. Clary favoured me with a
call, and gave me the ~rst information l had received, ,
that his name had been a·ssociated with mine, in the
order for opening the cloisters of the Hotel Dieu .for
· our insp~ction. It is not necessary, were it even
proper, to give a detail of all the conversation that
passed between us. An abstract will be ·all-sufficient
for the purpose in hand. M~. C. informed me frankly,
that his position was.peculiar, and he seemed apprehen-:-
sive that were he to accept the invitation, it might place
him in an unpleasant situation. He said his name had
already appeared in some of the New York publications
in connexion with the controversy on this subject-a
letter of his having been published, in which he had
declared that admittance mto the cloisters had been \
denied him.; and he evidently apprehe~ded that the
pre~5ent spontaneous offer had·been made to entrap him.
He said that that letter was strictly true, as he had once
been promised admission in the N1:1nnery, but when he
subsequently applied for permi~sion to:search the
building in company with Maria Monk, he had been
refused. . He was particularly desirous to know whether
it was my intention .to take merely a cursory and super-
ficial examinatio~ ofthe premises, or to in8.ke thorough
work of it. In .reply, I assured him repeatedly, that
my determination was inflexible, to 'make as thorough
an investigation as could be desired ;' that t~e priests
· had given me to understand that every facility for that
end should be granted: and that I was resolved to
scrutinize the whole structure, ,in all it~ ramifications,
from garret to cellar ;,. to lift every t~(4p door, to ~spect
every secret vault, unbar every door, search every eel,.
lai, and thr~~d every subterraneous passage: Mr. Clary
did not admit that he .was a believer in Miss Monk's ·
book, but h~ was evidently not a disbelit;ver. A~ong
the objections he started; W!J:S the probability tll,at ~ere
we to make t~e visit, we sh?uld be cal~ed upon to ~rite
upon.the subject. ·. To . which I replied that ! :could
perceive no objection to that; should the examination
be.full, and free, and fair, we could say so. And~ on
the other hand, should we leave the institution unsatili,-
..fled, there need ]Je nQ hesitati.o~ in proclaiming_.that

fact likewise. But he intimated his apprehensions that
we should be deceived by the wiles of those with whom
we were to have to do, and repeated his reluctance to
place himself in a position -that would compel him to
write any thing upon the subject. We parted before
he had determined what course to pursue, with an un..
derstanding .that I should call upon him in the course
ofthe morning, and apprise him ofthe hour·or entering
upon the investigation. This engagementwas fulfilled;
but Mr. C. was undetermined whether to go or not.
Being very anxious that he should make one of the
party, I urged him to accompany us, but was obliged
to leave him again jn a 'state of uncertainty. At the ·
hour appointed he called at my hotel, and stated that
on the whole he thought it best to decline the invita•
tion. I hinted to him the unpleasant dilemma in which
he might be involved by the refusal, but to no purpose.
He retired, and I saw him no more.
The hour appointed for commencing our researches
was two o'cb ck, and the residue of the morning was
devoted to the study of the latest edition of the "awful
disclosures," which is accompanied by the drawings of
the premisesas laid down in the tablets ofMaria Monk's
memory, and for a copy of which I was indebted to the
politeness of Mr. Clary. .A few passages for special
reference were marked in pencil; and the leaves turned
down at others. But my determination was to make
the examination book in hand, and refer to its page~
as occasion might require. Such w~s the course
pursued. ·
Punctual to the appointment, we arrived at five
minutes after two, and were received in the " apothe-
cary" by the assistant superior Miss Weeks, an Ameri..
can lady, a~d two other sisters, who had been designated
to attend us: I inquired for Miss Beckwith, also from
the United State11, whose parents reside in tl..e neigli..
bour4ood of Batavia; she was immediately sent for,
and soon made her appearance, Our meeting was like
that of old friends. She is certainly one of the most
prepossessing ladies with whom I have ever met. -Her
countenance is full of intelligence, and expressive of
great tenderness and sympathy, and tlJ.e tones of her
voice harmonize with these qualities; ·· I remarked to
42
them that I presumed, from what had dropped at our
former visit, they were fully apprised of the object of
our call..;_being, if possible, to test the truth or false-
hood of Maria Monk's publications in New York: I
informed them that I should be satisfied with nothing
short of a minute examination of any and every part of
the institution. I said to them, frankly, that I had
been admonished of their arts of deception, and had
been told that they would mislead me at every tum,
an4 throw dust in my eyes at their own pleasure; and
that consequently 1trusted they would be neither dis-
pleased nor surprised if the scrutiny I was about to
Institute should seem over-nice and particular. They
rep~ied that it was their desire to have the investigation
satisfactory to me, and that the keys and their assist-
ance were at my disposal. The Lady Superior, they
informed me, was confined to her apartment by indis-
position, otherwise it would have beeri her pleasure to
. receive. us in person. She would, ho'!ever, be happy
to recetve us m her own apartment. '
· We then commenced our travels and researches, being
soon joined ~y sev~ral a4ditiorial members of the sister-
hood, who accompanied us through our examination.
Others we met in their· respective apartments, busied
·in· their regular occupations. Having passed through
the h,ospitals as before, we entered the cloister, and
proceeded through the various apartments qf the first
story. Every door of every room, closet, and pantry
was readily opened at my request, and there was not an
apartment-, in either story, which I did not examine
with the closest scrutiny, from floor to ceiling, to note
whether there had or had not been any ' alterations-
any removal of part~tions, closing of doors, new pain~
ting or suspicious white-washing, or any such things
not forgetting one truth, inserted by the ·amanuensis of
Maria, in the sequel ofher latest edition, that "rvliateve'l'
1 altera-tions may beattempted, there are changes'which
no ma~on or carpenter can make and e.ffectually
conceal. " But in this story there had been no changes
pf any kind. The work and fixtures were·all, evident!v

drawings of Maria Monk. Every one of these trap·
doors I opened mvself, and into every one of the
vaults I descended, sometim_
es alone, but more f1·e.:
qncntly accompanied by Messrs. Frothingham and
Shephard. 'fhese vaults were usually store-rooms for
the accommodation of the particular apartments imme- '
diately above. Every wall was carefully examined,
both a~ to its appearance, the texture of the mortar, &c.
Aner these examinations were en ed, the sisters took u11
into the yards, and conducted us into the cellars arid
vaulted rooms. 'fhe same· scrutiny was every where
made, and the texture ofthe mortar tried by an it·on· •'
pointed cane. Every door and passage way was open-
ed with the like results. ·
've now re-entered the convent, and ascended to
the next story examining every apartment with the most
deliberate and eagle-eyed attention. We visited the
cells ofthe mms, and examined their furniture. 1'he
unsophisticated reader may perhaps think these" cells"
are very dark and gloomy places, with stone .1loors,
and locks and bars and grates, No such thing. They
are neat_
little apartments, containing a single bed, with.
green curtains and counterpanes, two old-fashioned
high-backed chairs, a littlo d sk, with a small case fo·r
Looks, and within which is also a crucifix. 'fhe books
so far as we looked at them, were such as good Protes-
tants might become sti 1 better by reading. Having
ascended the attic, we had now examined every part
except_
one of the long attic -
rooms, into which I look-
ed carefully through a glass window at the head of the
stairway, Miss Weeks having forgotten to bring the
key to the door. The roomwas used for drying clothe• ,
for which purpose as it vas well lighted, I saw the ne-
cessary fixtures, and I did not think it necessary to
serid the lady down all the stairs for the key. ·
Soon after we commenced our investigations, we
were presented to the Lady Superior, at the door ofher
apartment,· into which we were admitted. She was
suffering from an attac~ of rheumatism. · She is a lady
of dignity and refinement of manners-somewhat ad-
vanced in years. She received us with, the utmost
urbanity, nay, with cordiality; and re~etted not being .
able to.accompany us through the institution. Inde~d

the nuns have all the ease, .simplicity; dignity, 'and
grace which distinguish the high-bred and truly gen- .
teel. I have rarely-seen so many ladies together, pos- ..
sessing, in so great a degree, the charm of mannerl
They were all -affability ·and Jundnesa. Cheerfulness
was universal, and very unlike the notions commonly
entertained of the gloom of the cloister. Th'eir faces ·
were too ofte~ wreathed in smiles to allow us to sup..
pose they were soon to assist in smothering .their own
children, or that those sweet spirits were soon to be.
irbdden.out of their bodies by the rough-shod priests
of the seminary. ·The costume ot the black nuns is
different from what I had supposed. The dress is of
black bombazine, with ample skirt and bishop sleeves;
the neck dress consists of a large square white lined .
collar, reaching up to the chin; to this is attached a \
strap passing across the top of the heaa, to which the
bandeau is fastened. This is a white linen band.bound
round the forehead, and reaching down to the eye"
brows, so as to conceal the hair entirely. To this the
black veil is attached, which is made of a large double
square of black Italian crape, and l'eaches from the top
of the bandeau halfway-down the skirt behind• . Th~
face is not at all covered by the veil; nor .the front of
the person. The skirts are turned .up, like those of
the grey nuns. The tout ensemble is dignified,.becom•
· ing; and rather ·graceful. . - , .
· In ·the recreation room we were introduced to the·
novices, some four or five. The conversation was gay
and cheerful~ and so pleasant was their laughter ~t some
of our remarks; that I asked them in badinage.what
right they had to laugh'-that in such, a place ,t~eir
business must·be to look grave andgloomy, and nen~r
smile. 'rhe greater n~mber ofthe nuns ar~ advanced
in life, and soroe ofthem are very aged. In the infirm-
iu·y of the cloisi;er we were introduced to quite an·aged
. ~ember of the community. ..Although ~n invalid for.
. . man~ years, she wa~ cheerfu~ and ~reeable, receivi~g'
u·a W1.th marks of kind consideration. Indeed I·have
never witnessed in any commllnity or family more mi- .
·affected cheerfulness and good humour, nor more satis:.

the Superior..for.permission, -which was .immediately
and readily granted. · The task of exploration was un~
dertaken and executed. I~ was niostthoroughly done,
and we ll;ere now about to take leave, when I discovered
another cellar door, leading from the outside directly
iQto that part o~ the ..building ,from beneath which ac-
~ording to the plan ofthe.book, the.secret subterranean
passa~s lead to t~e ~.emmary . one.way,.and the con-

dilapidated_fi:id~res. Not supposmg tha~ the .~un~
would throw the1r murdered .sisters and children·mto
the'spring froin;'which they draw their water for t~eir
tea and·cooking, I did not descend. .The walls; how~
ever,: as before, were most thoroughly .examined hi~
every·nook and corner; and I' was compelled' ·no\v to
conclude my subterranean researches without being able
to siroll under the .deep ·foundations'of the Cathedral, .
and start!9 +he priesis of the Seminary by 'coming_
up ·
througli'(),_.,, r-! their owri trap-doors! · · . '
I have :~~•..:i:ldy remarked, that the cellars mgeneral
were used for store-rooms: In·one of them, into which '
I descende~·through a trap-~oor,,.I foun~ a number C?f
large stoneJugs. . Recollecting that Marta had spoken .
of some vessels, which, from her description, must have
been carboys of sulphuric acid, used, as she intimates;
with lime to destroy the remains of..'the ·murdered vic-
thns, l examined these jugs. From _
the odour,o~ the
corks, and the scent oftheJugs themselves, I presumed ·
their contents had been syrups, essences, 'and t!u!dicimll
decoctions'for the sick and the apothecary. The only
lime that I discovered,· was in a: hot-bed the gardener
had been making for radishes, I believe. . ·
· Thus, ended this examination,·in which we were most
actively engaged for about three hours. The result is'
the most thorough conviction t.hat Maria Monk is an
arrant 'impostor; that she never was a nun, and never
was within the walls ofthe Hatel Dieu; and consequent-
ly that her disclosures are wholly and unequivocally,
from.beginning to end, untrue; either the vagaries of
a distempered brain, or a seriesofcalumnies, unequalled :'
in the depravity of their invention, and unsurpassed in .
their enormity. There -are those, I am well :-aware,
who will not adopt this conclusion, though one should .,

No builder'couldbreak up an: 'old stone wall, or par-
tition, and remove'it;or stop·up a vault, or build up a
··gateway without leaving indubitable evidences ofthe
new work; and the alterations. ' Could any builder in
New York build up the doors and .windows· of the
Bridewell, w~i:lJ.OUt the use of paint or white-wash, so
as to prevent detection,.,or so as to make the new wo~k
in all respects to correspond with the old'? Th~ thing I
is impossible. ·· ' · , ·
Again-Maria Monk ·has laid down the track_by
which she escaped; and has givena narrattve of the way
she proceeded·to get·out, which, in the first place, the
walls she must have climlied, prove to ·have bee~l'im.
pos~ible, and to which the internal regulations of the
' house,_as·I believe, ghe a positive :::·Jntradiction. ··By
the course she has marked out on the map, she'must
have come first within a few feet of the broad gate,
always open in the day-time, leading into St.·Jostipb:.
street. In the yard .where she then was, there ·are
various doors opening into several parts of the •build-
ings. Well-having been near the ·broad gate,· she
wheeled round to the right, ·aln;10st crossed ,her track
in turning.a wing, and finally escaped through the
garden grounds..into Jean Baptiste-street. ·Now this
· E 2 • .
51)
whole tale is not only improbable, but JLbsolutely im-.
possible. There is no passagethat way; s~e must have
leap~d .a succession of walls-the outer wall some ·
twenty feJe~ high-walls .which no unaided -~ortal, man
or :woman, could have ~urmounted. . ·· ·~ . · · ·
. ·When reminded ofthese facts by ·Messrs. Jones and
Le Cl~rc; geDt.lemcn from Montreal, wlio had an in-
terview with· ·:aria .at Messrs. Van Nostrand and
Dwight's bool.. .-Jtc..-e. in August, she resorted ·to the
usual subterfuge, that there were a door' and a gate
there then..:..but intimating .that they had been altered.
Again, ~ say; it is not trUe.! · The walls have stood a
cent~y~~ere was no . gate, and no passage-way has
bee_
n filled up. " As 'well might Alderman ·Woodruft'
send a·bevy of masons tobuild up the portals of·the
City.Hall, a~d. tl-1 people of New.York, not know it,
as that·such works could have been executed in Moo-
ileal, and the people of ·Monireal, kept in ignorance
of the·fact. But wh~nce this great difficulty of
escaping ? There are plentr of doors ·and ~ate~; and '
every nut;l has.a key at her stde. · The restramt IS vol-
untary, and they can break their vow and retire if they
ple,ase. . Or, iftheir health will not bear the confine-
ment, they can-leave after the white veil, and ·before
ta~ing the black. Such instances are ~ot rare. The
whole tale is one of falsehood. ·
Again,. ·as to th~ $ecret passage·under ground to the
Seminary. .Whence its·necessity,-since the gate is al-
ways open, and the hospitals with communicating doors
to the ·cloiste:r:s always accessible? If -such pas_
sage'
had ever.existed, it must necessarily have·led underthc
pr~sent foundation of the stupendous cathedral before
described. The foundations- of this structure were
laid ~?road and deep. They dug· until they came to
water, and had such a path-way existed, it would ~ave
beendiscqvered then. Mr. Frothingham, andhu~dreds
of others, passed the ~ot daily, and viewed the progress
of the 'rOrkmen contmually ; yet no such passage was
ever seen.or heard of,.;_and there has 'been no filling
up.-There was .indeed, ·an old passage-way to the
river-perhaps from the old.French church in Notre
:Pame-stree~, now-pulled down, constructed, according

.· Again, as to the births and-murders of-children:-
In .t}le first place, the whole tale is improbable, both as
to .the .number of nuns .and infants. ~· Do murdeiers
~Iu,ter in numbers to perpetrate .their .butcheries, and
thus purposely · furnish , the mea~s of, conviction 1
wauld they be so foolish, ;and so :mad, ..as to keep a
writ~en record.of their muJ:"ders ? 'And would so many
mo,hers consent to strangle their OWIJ offspring'? · Can
a woman forget per suckitig child? ·. It is not so ! The
voice.of indignant nature rises up to proclaim the false-
l:ood !. .A,nd; .moreover, as'to the number ·of novices
and infants; .Miss.Monk states, that on a certain occa- · ·
sian, ·she.discovered a booh)n the Superior's cu.siody,
containing the record of the admissions ofnovices, and
of the }li~:ths of infants who werP·murdered. About
t.wenty-five.of these pages werel'l.uj.ten over, containing
about fifteen entries on·a page. " Several of these
pages,~' she says; ,"were occupied with the reco.·ds·of
the·births .o( the murde:red infants... And all the re-
cords were either of admissions or ·births." .Nowwe
will allow,twenty pages for the records of admissions
of novices, and five for the births of the murdered ~
children:• Fifteen entries on apage, ·twenty pages,
will give us the number of.THREE·HUNDRED admissions
in two.years. Now there are but thirty-six nuns i'l all,
and seldom more than four or five novices or postulants,
Again, as to the infants-if we.allow five pages to have
been devoted·to these records ofbirths, we have sEVEN~
TY-FIVE births during .;be same period! !-Now, .as I '
have already said, there are but thirty-six nuns; more
than one-halfare '~past age/'· Certainly not more than
fifteen ofthem 90uld,'," in the natural course of human
events," 'become mothers. Taking Maria's .statements,
therefore, .as. correct data, and each of those fifteen

solicitation of some of the friends of 'Maria Monk; I
have had a~ i interview with her, together with the
newly-escaped nun, as she calls herseJf, Frances. Par-
tridge~ who has arrived in season to confirm all Maria's
statements; and ·add divers 'other.tales of terror 'Qf her
own. The result is,-that, so far from giving me reason
to alter,·a single line that I have written' I would·add
to the force ofmy contradictions of thecalumnies con-
tained in the "Awful Disclosures," if language would
allow of it ; for if I before had entertaine(l the least

not. One reverend gentleman waxed angry, ,and said

lea.ve-:-pained that men of sense should show such a
spirit, and allow themselves to be made such·egregious
dupes of, by two of the most shallow impostors that I
ever saw. - The Apostle speaks of certain men in latter

thus·- · · · ·
After an introduction, .tlie .conversation was ~om­
menced, I believe, by the Rev: Mr. Slocum, ·the guar· ·
dian of Miss Monk;' and with whom Miss Partridge is
also now residing;. Mr. S. began by a series ·of pre·
liminary questions to the following effect :__; · · . ··
"You liave recently .been in Montreal,_I am told?:' .
~'Yes.'~ · · 1 ·
" _
How,were you ple38ed ?" ' · ·
"Very well." ... ·' · .
"Did-r,ou s~ the ~~v. · Mr. Clary 'I"

have been expecting letten from him for some time.
Did lou see much of.him?" · .~· · · · "

' '~ Didlou visit any nunneries?"
' "I di ."
"Which of them 'I"
"Two; the Grey Nuns, and the Hotel Dieu."
· " Which is the largest of the two ?" · .
·I
"The convent of the Grey Sisters occupies the most
ground, I believe." · ' · . ·
" A~ you not mistaken 'I The Black Nunnery is
very large." . _
" True : but I believe the gr~unds of the.other.,are
of the greatest extent." · - ,
" well : where did you go next?"
" To the Hotel Dieu." · _
".Which way did you enter it?"
"Through the·broad gate, in St. Joseph-street."
By Miss Monk•. : " rou foun4 yourself among a ·
number of out:.buildings there'?" "
" Yes : Several." .
Thus far J.had submitted to the questioning, because
the preli~inar~es were not.material. · Another question
was now p~t to me, I think-by Mr..~locum, .tlie effect
ofwhich .would.have been.to make me· open the doors
of the conyent to them. ·This was not the plan I had
adjusted in·my own mind, to bring the ·veracity ofth~ .
pretended nuns to the test. My reply to_
the questioh
was as follows ~~
56
"Gentlemen, I did not come here to be catechised.
I have answered thus far cheerfully. But I am neither.
a party jn this mf_ltter, nor a witness. I came hither on·
invitat~on, to meet these ladies, and bear what they and
you have to say~ My only object is to arrive at the
1!uth-~ to the matter in hand." · · "...
TQ which there was a general reply from the gentle-
men, that that was their only object. '
After a pause, and a few indifferent remarks as to the
embarrassment ·of the .Position in which·we were ·au
placed, Maria Monk spoke up quite pertly :-..: · ,
"I should think that such an old man as you, Mr.
Stone;•would not be·afraid to speak to such girls as we
(cr before us upon this subject, I am not certain as to
the words.) \
"Not so very .old, Miss Monk·: how could you say ,
so? I have not a gr~y hair yet!" .,' · ·. .
·Miss Monk. "But can't you tell us how you found
the nunnery 'I We should like to know something
about it, .as you have been there so long since we
have." . . ' · · .. · . ·
" So I suppose. But I don't choose to be questioned
about it now." .
[After some other observations, Colonel Stone gives
the following account· of the examination of Frances
Partridge and Maria Monk :-] ·
Question from ~Mr. Stone. Miss Partridge, you

Miss Partridge. I am. ·

Ana. 'The ceiling' was all newly plastered, and
partly down on the wall, where it ·broke ofF. You
could st>e a blue or green streak where the new plas-
ter was joined on. .

pomts. ·
Question by Miss Partridge. Did you go up all .
the stairs?
·.Ans. I believe I did.
Qu.· bg Miss,P. Did you go up th~ long · stairway.
leading to Notre Dame-street·? · . ·
Ana. The stairway~ did you say, leading from
Notre Dame-street! Are you quite sure'? ·
At this instant Maria Monk JOgged her and inter-
posed--" The congregational Nunnery, you mean!"
Mr. Stone. I am talking to Miss PartriJgo-;a, Miss
Monk. You·are certain, Miss Partridge, th;~t 1t is the
long stairway leading from the Hotel Dieu into Notre '
Dame street·? . · ·
.llns. Yes-that is theone. [or words ·equivalent.]
Gentlemen, these enquiries are important, and must
be kept in mind. ·
Question by Mr. Stone.-Well, Miss Partriu~e, we·
will'come to the cellars again': Pray tell me whtch of
the cellars under the hospital has been.the latest white-
washed, during the present season'? ·
, Aus. Why-they have all been white~washed this
summer.
Qu. What-all the vau1ts and cellars1 Are you
quite sure, Miss Partridge?
F
58
, i'
Ans. Yes: al.l of.the~ have b~~? thoroughly wh~te..
washed~ .,. ·
. .Qu. Are you not mistake~ about all being ,white..
washed? · . . · -
·
'Ans. No: I know it1 ~o~ I helP.~d to white-wash
'them my~elf. Why; (tummg to, M1ss Monk) Maria1
you have helpEd J:ne to whitewash them, hav'nt you?
To .which I understood Maria to assent.
This exam4tation of t_he latest pattern of·an escaped
nun, was sufficient. I told her that *at was enough, ,
and>
tu:ning to. her frie~ds ~· remark~~Gentlemen';
that woman has not been in ·the Hotel ,l>ieu at all.
She is an impoator. She is im:f,oaing falsehoods upon
you. I assure you, upon my hOnor, and from my own
personal knowledge and observation, that all she has
told us here is false. .There haa 'been no new wall
built where she describes;· o:r in.any other place. · I
have examined .every inch .of ground. There· have
been none of the alteraU..ns of whicb she.speaks--not
the reruoval of a wall, .a partition;. or a board. .She
does not know, gentlemen, even where ..the Convent is
situated, for she has located it on the wrong street, and
on the wrong side.of a very large block. Three times
has ·she said there is a large.stairway, en.~ a passage
from the Convent directly into Notre Dame~street,~
whereas the Convent i& far aw~y from that street, with..
out any 9pe~ing or 'communication thither. . But,
more than all, gentlemen, on the subject of the white-
washing. All that she has said i1f.false. Not a single
cellar, or vault·of that Convent hu e'De'r b~n .white•
washed ! The walls are as dark and bare of lime as
when they were first built, a eentury ago. This fact I
k~ow, from having just exam"tned every one of them
with the close~t scrutiny. .And yet ahe a~ys she hr~!ped
to white.,wash them, and Maria, too, ~&ya eh.e has for~
merly helped her! It is all false~ gentlemen. .
Question by.Dr. BrlWIJ.nlee. But, Miss. Part\idge1
how ntany stor~~s are there~ 1mderground 'I '
, Ana.t Only two, underground. Oh! I helieve the
lower on~ underground .has not been white-washed: .

I now resumed the examination of Maria Monk. .
Qu. Miss Monk, in your book you speak offinding
a certain'book 'in the Superior's room, containing a
re.cord for tw'o years, of the entrance ·of novices into·
the Convent, and the birtliJ of children, all of which
were murdered. .. · ·· ·· -' ·· ; -
Ana. Yes. ·
Qu. How many pages did that book contain 1
Ana. I do not remember.
·Qu. Can you ·recollect how many pages.are.stated
in your book' · , · · "' · · · ·
.4nl. No'; I told Mr.·Dwight as near as I could re-
collect, and he put it down. ,' · ·· : · . ·
· Mr. Stone. Very well: I will help you. Your
book says there were about one hundred pages. Now,
Miss Monk, how many pages did you say were written·
over'l · · ·· · · . :,
.Ans. I don't recollect. I told :Mr. Dwight 'as near ·
as I could. ' ·
By'Mits Partridge and Mus_ .Monk. We could
never have time to count -the pages of such a book-
We shopld ilot dare to look at such a book more than
two minutes, and how could we count the pages 'I ·
Mr. Stone. Very well: I will help youagain. · You·
say in your book, that one quarter of the book was
written through-making twenty-fiv.epages. Now, Misil
Monk,,can you tell how .many entries there were·on
each page'I . ·
\ Ana. I do not recollect•
.Mr. Stone. Then I will assist you again. You say
the~e were about fi.t'teen entries on a page. Now M~ss
Monk, can you inform me how many of these twenty-
five pages were devoted to recording the ·entries of
novices, and ho-.v many to the births of infants, all of
whicli were murdered' '...
60
Am. No : I don't remember the exact number. I
told Mr. Dwight as near as I could.·,.. .
1'rfr:·Stone. Very well:" yo'rir book .s~ys '~ Several
9{these pages~~ w~re ~~voted to re<:~rd,ing the .birtl~s of
mfants. ··-Now how many do you mean·by "several?"
.
.' Am. Why thafs a ..s~range questio~: Of~_ course
more than one. · · .. ·· · ·
····.Mr. Storie: .But that will'not answer. , lf~hat you
uy is true, .those were deeply .important records~
not~ng less than the births ~nd murder ot" chi!dren.-
We'must endeavour -to arrive at some degree of pre-
cision. About how many do you mean by several?
surely you can form some opinion. ,: · .
· Miss Monk hesitated'; a.nd "'several gentlemen inti-
.mated that I was pursuing an unfair.method of exami~
nation; to which I ' replied, ·" Not at all, ·gentlemen;
this is an i~porta~t point. ·I,t mus.t be push~d home to '
get at the truth." · · ...
Mr. Dwight You might as well ask her how large
is a piece of chalk. · · ·· · ·
.Mr. Stone•.' That *ill·do very well for a get·off,
Mr. Dwight.; But l must have an answer of some sort. .
Now, Mr, Dwight, 'Yhatqo you understand by several,
in the sense you have used it in . writing the book'?
~u\>pose a.boo~ <?f one ~~~dred . pag~s.:....twenty-five of
wh1ch were written over, and "several" of whiCh were
devoted to a.part~cular subject. . In s~c~ a case you
would suppose that·'\several" would imply as many as
five or six, would you not? • . ·
·Mr. Dwight.' I should think that aboufrigltt.
, ·~r. B_tone. · Very well-we will take five. (To
whiCh Mtss Monk assented.) We have now five pages
of the records of births .of infants, which have been
.bom and murdered within t\Vo ytlrs.....;.fifteen on a page.
Now, Gentlemen, I remarked,, there are but thirty-six
nuns in the Convent~ ·· .
Miss Monk turned round, smiling at my assertion,
and·said there were many more·.
No, gentlemen; (I continued) there are but thirty-six
nuns and'some four or five novices.•

Miss Partridge. I don't know how many'were sent

day. A good many·were sent ofF. '· · •
Mr: Stmee. Gentlemen, -this ii all nonsense~ That
woman has never been in the·Nunnery at all, and there
were none sent offon the occasion referred to-it's ,n
folly to suppose any such thing.
-Btmeral.-But the proof rests with you.
Mr. Stone~-No, gentlemen: not at all. I assert
the fact, that there are, arid have· been but thirty-s~x
nuns in ~he Ht>tel Ditm. That was the original num-
ber ofthe foundation-it has always been tlie number,
and no mo.-e. For the truth ~fthts assertion, I can.ap-
peal to the history of the institution-to the whole
people ofMontreal-to my own observation. I the:p
added- · ··
"Gentlemen, there are but thirty-six nuns in that
Convent;....more-considerably more-than one l)alf'
of those nuns are too far advanced in life to become
the mothers of young children. And yet we have, by
Miss Monk's statement, five pages of recotds, fifteen
births and murders to the page, and all within the
period of two years, and not more thari twelve or fifteen
nuns who would probably bear children." Then turn-
ing to Maria, I asked- : ' ,. ·
" Pray, Miss M.;onk, will you be so good as to inform
me how many children &·piece those nuns have every
year~
There was no direct answer.

says, Mana Mo~k "was .a V'lclous ,profbgate·'on the
town,' and w~s taken into ~agd!llen Asylum in 1834,
with the hope of reformation." He continues,-J .. '
.•-.,Having fallen into the han~s of Mr. Hoyte, after her
'dismissal from the asylum of Mrs. M'Don~ll, th~t
gentleman, lu;lowing the blind-zeal and credulity of
th.e.!Wti-Papists,.pa,- e:~.·~.~ellen~;- hit upon the expedi-
ent, as it is believed, :of <:liciting the public sympathies
in her favour, and bringiug. out a book, from whi9h .
.gre~J.t profits.were '.to be realized. - 'When her case be-
c~~e known in.New York, certain Prowr..~nt cler~y­
men, morbidly cr~dulous in relation to ev~ry th1ng
c~~ceming Popery, 'Convents, :Priests and _
NUD.s, ·be-
.Cf1me greatly i~ter~~ted -~~· h~J: story-the fancy•work,

~~les . w~:re all e~d~r!!ed by. Hoyte, and the ,h,ouses,
hearts, a~d purses ofall we~e,.opened to thei supposed
nun and 4er,g1;lard.ian. It was so.ou· di~<;overed, how-
ever,.that Hoyte had'~ sev~n principles" up'!n the :mb-
ject, viz: ~'the five.. loaves and two fishes;" and his
j'lldicious advisers cau~ed his dismission from her.affairs
arid as her protector• . The Rev. Mr. Slocum .bec3.1Ile
I her guardian, and a very.estimable .and conscientious
l~terary gentleman, Mr. Dwight, was employed to. write
her narrative from her,own verbal.recita1s. , .·
In due time the ·volume was ushered forth to the
public, and then came th~ scramble ~rea~y -rt:ferred
to, among ministers, and writers, and printers, ·for the
division of the ·spoil~ach party cl~ming to favor
·the interest of,Maria, while she, poor creature, knew
not whom.among the whole she ought_
.to trust. Jfer
anc~ent predilections fqr Hoyte, had induced her to
give him a legal cia~ .to the copyright, and yet her
.distrilst having been awakened, she gave similar powers
'ofattorney,,to one or more of th~ other parties-re~ok~
jng the former.; .and when the stereotype plate~ were
prepared, it was found that· mo:J;"e than one or two
claimants were awaiting ~heir delivery, all ha~ing ~rit­
.ten orders under · the sign manual of Mar1a Monk.

was agreed, as I have been informed, that Maria should

inmates were not only daily repeating their deeds of
infamy and ·blood, but that 'these murdered children
were left there at the hazardof detection and exposure;
under circumstances indicative of downright insanity.

men and ministers in ·the city of New York, who
greedily ~wallow the; whole, and regar4 th~s "awful

vile plot against ita professors. This honeat prejudice (and I am sure in
him, it il honelt) makes hla generous testimony the more valuable.

· The,_question'I have.been ~xamining, is not w~ether
J?opery be true, or the priests of ~orne ..holy, or the
nuns virtuous, but simply and,only ~his : Whether.
~he loathsome revelations of Maria Monk, and Frances
.l 'artr~dge, are'true or false~ in regar4 to.tJ:le p~~ests and
nuns of Montreal 'I The importance of.a_
correct deci-
:-~ion of this question, grows out ofthe .extensiye credit
which her book has o~tained, and ',the inte~est which
every man, whether Protestant or Catholic, has in the
suppression of vice, .the prevention of crime, and the
mainterian·ce of truth. · 'fhe .fact already confessed,
that I was, myself, at times,' almost if -q.ot quite a·,
believer in her book, in ·common with multitudes of
others, of perhaps less credulity, led to the desire of an
opportunity of examining for myself; and as circum-
stances favored the gratification of this desire, I entered.
~pon an i!J.spec~ion .o~ t~e p~e.mi~es,. w~t~ .a··~etermiria­
tton of makmg a rigid and Impartial scrutmy. The
result is .before the reader; and ;having' 'ascertaine(f
from the evidence: of their ow~ dt;!clarations, an,d my·
own senses~ that neither Maria Monk nor Frances Par-·
tridge has been an inm~te of the Conven~. from which
they pretend to have escaped; I cannot, and will not,
~ithhold the public· expression of my deliberate,con-
viction, that the book of Miss Monk is a'vile and in-
famous fabrication ; that she and the pretended St.
Frances are both arrant impostors ; both of which if
not protected by the convenient plea of insanity, de-
serve to be punished by the laws of the land. . ·
I cannot but lament,.in common with all Protestants;
the corruptions of the Church of Rome; especially do .
I deplore the increase of the professors of that creed,
in our own country. ·But still I cannot as a professing
Protestant; withhold the evidence in my possession to
protect them from calumny and falsehood. At the
same time, I am free to confess that I have yet anoth,er
object in view, viz : the emancipation ofmy own coun- ·
trymen from the bondage of ·prejudice, superinduced
by the most flagrant impostu~e. This task .I have
attempted to perform, honestly, and according to the
..
66
beat of.my ability, without fear, f,vor, or affection.
I~ io doing, I have believed myself to be likewise per-
fanning _
a_
duty.to Protestant C,hristianity in the hght
of truth;- lince·J.believe the·most sovereign antidote
to the march of Popery will ever be found .in that
diyine ~ttribute; and if the Papal p~wer can dnly be
overthrown by fraud, falsehood, and unposture, I say,
.for one, let it stand. .. · . , .
\ .. . . . ... ·, . .. ..' . '
Still, for the sake ofthe public morals and the pub-
lic tranquillity, I could heartily wish that no more of
this description of anti-Popery literature should be-
thrown from-the American press. · The evils inflicted
upon our w~ole population,. by such publications, are
not properlY: appreciated, or· they would lorig since
have received the stem rebuke of our moralists. ' They
.are extensive aiid to ade~ irreparable, ~ Among the
most prominent ofthese e~ils is the increase of Popery
itself-the certain result·of intolerance 'and persecu..
tiori-more es~ially when such persecution is founded
in f~l-~h~~ ~nd im,po~re.

It would be possible to produce h~re evidence bear..·
ing on the life ~d adventures of MariaMorik, from her
infancy.to the present moment. She is still young-
very young ; h~r personal acqu~ntances are ,to be met
with in numerous directions on the banks of the
St. .Lawrence and Richelieu rivers, and very little
trouble would have enabled us to exhibit her entire
career from the "Primer" to the "Disclosures;" but
it would not be interesting to the public to know more
of the history of Maria :Monk than is necessary, in all
reason? for the refutation ofher pretensions, and the
exposure of the imposition which has been attempted
in her name on popular credulity. The task of unfold··
ing the immorality ofthis wretched woman is any thing
hut pleasing.· It is not undertaken to gratify idle curi.:
..
68
osity, but to vindicate from atrocious aspersions the
characters ofmen whom we deeply venerate--to redeein
from calumny the noble lives of good, peaceful, and
charitable women. · ·
When this refutation and these proofs shall meet the
eye ofthe scurrilous"•and unhesitating defamer,· will he
not seek to es"
cape the light of day and the regards of
his fellow-men 1 ·. The turbid current of his deliberate
apd b~asphemqus fanaticism will be heated by hot shame
and unavailing regret. · The st~pid and lying wretch,
the'base knave, the imbecile crimmal, will writhe in his
anguish, scorned and loathed by an insulted and indig-
nant community.. We have carried back our inquiries
into the adventures of-·Monk as far as the year 1831 ;
she was then in her fifteenth year. It cannot be said \
positively that it is not pretended that she was a pro-
fessed nun previously to th~t age ; but we have reason '
to believe, fron1 the language held by"her s'upporters in
the public prints, that her conventual trials principally
occurred in the years 1831, 1832, 1833, and 1834.
We now proceed to present our first document :-
No. I.' E'DiJence of Charles Gouin.

" The undersigned being requested tO state what he
knows concerning .Maria Monk, daughter of Mrs.
Monk, housekeeper-ofthe house known as the Govern.:

Monk entered into his service at Sorel, or William

the said Maria left his service, she made a voyage to

Mr. Gouin is a man of years, and keeper of the prin-

I. That in the year 1831 and 1832, Monk was in his
service for the space ofabout ten months.
' 2. That she wasin his service, .during the Cholera·
season of 1832. ·.
3. That while in his service, she denied her own
' mother. The conduct of Mcuk, towards her mother
~as alway~ been ~ngrateful ; and her habit ofindul$ing
1t1 calummo.us reml\rks on her parent could be testified
by hundreds of witnesses.
N<?· 2. E'Dide_nce ofMrs•.Monk, ofSorel.
: . . "Sorel, 24th July, 1836.
"The undersigned, bemg requested to state her infor·
mation and kno·w~edge concerning Maria Monk,
daughter to Mrs. Monk, house·keeper of the Govern-
ment House in the city of Montreal, hereby declares·
that Maria. Monk entered her service as domestic in the
Autumn of 1832; .that the lindersigned understood
that Maria had just returned from Quebec; and that a.
short time previously she had been employed as ~l
domestic in the hotel kept by C. Gouin at Sorel; that.
having·remained about one week in the service of t;;H~
undersigned, Maria Monk secretly withdrew from it,
carrying with her a quantity ofwearing apparel belong-
ing to the undersigned; that Maria was immediately
pursued to St. Ours, a village about twelve miles from
the borough of Sorel, and there discovered ~ith the
stolen articles in her possession; but in . consequence
of her extreme youth sh~ ·was released from custody,
and suffered to go at bberty. The undersigned has
never understood, except from recent public report,'
that Maria had been at any time an inmate ofa Convent. '

To guard against error from the similarity of nam~.":~.
it is proper to state that Mrs. Monk is in no wise cc:.:.
nected with Monk the 'thief. Mrs. Monk's evidence
proves the commission· ot' the crime .of theft, and cor.
roborates the evidence ot' Mr. Gouin. On the libera-
tion of Monk 'from custody, she attempted to pass her-
sEM on Mr. Pringle1 a farmer of St. Ours, as an ~onest
girl; ana indeed. was in his service for a few days; but
Mr. ·Pringle ·C).~icklv ascertained her character, and dis-
missed her ~nth igtiominy. ··
The inhabitants of the Canadian villages arc simple ·
and'primitive in their manners, slo vto suspect the ex-
istence of vice, slow to detect it. I Menk is represented
by all who knew her, as having been at one time a
g1rl ofextremely interesting appearance. Immediately
after her dismissal from the house of Mr. Pringle, she
fled from St. 'Ours, and made her wa~ to St. Denis, a
village about twelve miles distant. · 'Ihe communica- '
tions bet,veen the French, and- scattered English in-
habitants of the parishes, are as slight as it is possible to
imagine. Monk met therefore.with,no difficulty in pro-
cttring employment, in a Canadian family; ·and she ac-
cordingly took service in the house ofMr. St. Germain1
a respecrable tradesman and ~echanic of St. Denis.
Mr. St. Germain is since deceased; but his widow has

This deposition carries us fOJ:ward six months, to the
Spring of 1833. On leaving Mrs. St. Germain's,.Monk
became dependant on the charity of various indivi-
duals, and remained for about two months, without anj
fixed employment. . She was regarded by ihe inhabi-
tants of the village as a girl ofat least doubtful virtue.
This circumstance compelled her to quit it. She wun-
dered into the country, and prevailed on the untutored
peasants to employ her as a teacher of Englis~. .. ·

The part attributed to Miss Bousquet, in th~ "Awful
Disclosures/' is more than she will confess to. She is
: no-: married, and the curious tnlvellei' visiting the so
called Sixth Concession, nine miles East of the village
of St. Denis, will find her the happy and contented wife
of John Baptiste Archambeau, ~njoying some·reminis- .
cen~es ofMaria Monk, but wholly dead to the memory
of tbe·murdered St. Francis. The evidence ofMadame
Archambeau proves that the residence of Monk in and
about the parish of St. Denis was extended to the month
ofJuly, l.S34. It moreover corroborate~ the evidence
of Mrs. St. Germain, and of Michael Gu~rtin on the
~ntire period of the residence of Maria .Monk at St.
Denis. It will be observed that she entered the service
of Mrs. St. Germain in the autumn of 1832, and that
she lost her situation with Miss Bousquet in the sum-
met of 1834. . . , .
As ·is stated;.in the deposition of Miss Bousquet,
Monk then withdrew from St: Denis. It cannot be
.said Monk's .vicious propensities slumbered while she
wa8 in ·the country ; .for 1t is certain tliat the 4eponents
of St. Denis, who are silent on her moral. conduct
might have stated much against' it. That she was a girl
practised in evil, may be inferred from the evidence of
Coumoier, commonly called Martel Paul.

Capt. Ryan informed m~, that on the arrival of the

communicating with him, a»d that he had reason to

Mr. Kidd is one of his Majesty's Justices ofthe Peace
for the District of Montreal. It does not appear from
the evidence of Mr. Kidd, in what month of the sum.:.
mP.r of 1834 Monk made th~ journey there mentioned;
but by recurring"to the evidence of Miss Bousquet, as
to the time of her withdrawal from her service (July),
and to the'evidence of Mr. Lovis as to the time of her
entrance into his flervice (12th July), it will be per-
ceived that 1the journey mullt have been made subse-
quently to the 8th of August. .It is doing Monk no
injury to believe that she stole Capt. Ryan's watch.
The unfortunate woman has committed crimes which
obscure stealing.
It is no libel to write Maria Monk a thief.

Baptiste Gira.rd.as being the woman mentioned in the
said warrant ; he, the said deponent, by virtue of the
said warrant, made her a prisoner, and took her into
his custody and keeping; that all the goods stolen from
the said Jean Baptiste Girard were found in her posses-
sion, part of which, women's clothes, she wore on her
person, and the remainder she carried in a bundle, with
the exception of the said silver·watch ·and a veil, which
she stated she had sold iu Montreal prior to her depar-
ture from there ; and that she would show to the de-
ponent the persons to whom she .had made sale .of
them. That .she then named herself Maria Mills, and
on the road to Montreal, ab9ut halfway fromLachirw,
she remarked that she would not like to be seen by
persons who were working in a field adjacent to the
road, as her uncle, Mr. Mills, lived there. .. 'fhat after
having reached '·i·.Iontreal, ,she took the deponent and
the said Jean Baptiste Gi;rard.tp the j~weller's shop of
Messrs. Savage, in St. Paul-street, .sta,tmg that she had
sold the said watch there, for the sum oftwo dolla1·s;
which was, on the application to Mr. Savage, imme-
diately returned to the said Jean Baptiste Girard. That
she then took them to a house .in St. Ann suburbs,
where she stated she had sold the veil ; but the veil
could not be obtained there, as the people denied the
fact; that she was then taken (that night) to a tavem
kept by one William Brown, at the New-market of this
city, and the:te kept during the niyht under the charge
of the said Jean Baptiste Girard. That on the morning
following, tlie deponent, the said Jean Baptiste Gira)·d,
and the said woman who named hers'elf Maria Mills,
left Montreal for the parish of Varennes~ the residence
of the said Jean Baptiste. Girard, fifteen miles from
Montreal, and hired ~ ferryman named.Peter Plouff to
convey them by water to that place. That after having
reached Varennes, she taxed. ,the servant-maid of the
said Girard with having stolen the said effects, and
given them to her in a bundle.. Th3t the said Girard
and his family, being convinced of the falsity of the
story, did not believe her: and would not allow her to
sleep in their hGuse that night.; when deponent was
obliged to provide lodgings for her at a tavern kept
hy a. widow named There.:1e Delf'\luse. That on the
'·
so
morning following, the saidJean Baptiste Girard having
positively declined prosecuting the charge any further
on account of the respectability of her family and her
youth, the deponent brought her ba~k to Montreal.
'rhat whilst .at Val'ennes, she told the said deponent
that her real name was Maria Monk, and that she was
tile daughter of Mrs. Monk, who was living at the Gov.
t!rDment House in the city of Montreal; which the de·
ponent subsequently ascertained was the tru~, and
requested of ~he deponent not to take her to her mother;
as she'would chain her up and make her suffer as she
had done before. That the deponent taking pity on
her, took her to an inn kept in ·Commissioners'-street,
by one Richard Ouston, ·where she remained two or
three days; after which she left th&t house, and the
deponent does ~ot know where sht: wept to ; but in a
few days subsequently, the deponent was sent for by a
young boy, who told him there was a younp- woman at
the New-market, in a tavern kept by one John Irvin~
desirous ofseeing him. That the deponent having gone
there was directed to a room in which he found the said
Maria Monk; who, among other things, told the de-
ponent that she intended leaving for Quebec. That
they then parted, and the deponent never heard of her
afterwards, until about the early part of the month of
Sept~mber last, when, on arriving home in the after-.
noon he was informed that the servant of one Josephine
Raymond, widow of the late John George Dagan, had
come there to request. the deponent to go to the said
Josephine Raymond's residence; that there was a young
woman from New York desirous of seeing deponent.
That the deponent having gone there found thai the..
young woman in question was the said Maria Monk he-'
fore mentioned. That she then told tht~ deponent that
she had just anived from New York, with her friend,
the .Rev. Mr. Hoyte; that they had tal>en lodgings at
Goodenough's hotel, but that she had nin away frot.n
him and left him his child; she also stated that she dia
not know how to get her clothes from Goodenough's.,
hotel: that she would no longer live with the · said
Hoyte, as she did not like hili\; and that she would '
do anything sooner than return with him, the said

that about the close of ·the month of November, one .
thousan~ eight hundred and thirty-four, Maria.Monk,

with a man who had·reached the yard of the Asylum,
by scaling the enclosures, she sent for the said Maria,

holding such communications was in direct violation
ofthe rules of the iilstitution, and did moreover indi-
cate a disposition to rE:llapse into her vicious courses;
that the said Maria was not touched by the remon-
strances addressed to her, but became more indecorous
in her conduct every day; and that finally, deponent
was compelled to dismiss her from the Asylum. That
the said Maria, before·l1er dismissal, did _

In 1831 there were two novices, and in 1836 we find
one; and we can assert.witbgreat certainty, .that at"no
time since the foundation· of the 'Hospital there have
been forty, or any number approaching to it.' · ' .
The extracts from the Quebec .Almanack:·also 'cor-
roborate · what we have already advanced, .that .the'
sisters ofthe Congregational Nunnery take the'naine of
saints, but that the sisters ofthe H&tel Dieu never do.
In the "Disclosure&" with the exception'of"_J~e Ray"
·the nuris ofthe latterare always de~ignated is "saints.,
At page 179 et al,iunde, it is insinuated, that ·~'. su­
periors'!, when they grow old,. are regularly m-qrdered,
and the bloody exit of one in pvticular is' plainly inti-
mated. In ·the extracts from ,the Almanack are the
names of two superiors. t The sister Meziere, mention.:
ed in No. 19; ·was superior from 1827 to 1833. The
sister Lapailleur Devoisy, mentioned in No. 21, was
superior from·1821 to 1827, and was re-elected first
in 1833, and again recently in June; '1836.
At page 33 it is asserted, that "about one. hundred
ppests are connected with_
the Seminary of Montreal."

this city, I did, a few weeks s.ince, in .company '!ith
N:·B. ·.D~ucet ~d I. ?· :Lac~1:x, E.s9wres, IJ:Dd With-
out sendmg any previous notice; yi&lt the sa1d Nun-

all that part of.the said.building between the.wall of

side·of the public 'chapel;·(the top of the.map bein$
called north;) that fronts on St. Paul's-street to·the ex-
h:eme comer, from·.whence the passage to the Congre-
gational Nunnery is laid down in the said map;·and I do
moit freely declare, that after apatient and protra~ted
.scrutiny of the ;walls, windows; closets, doors, cellars,
robms;· and furniture of the _
same; after having ex-
amined,"With equal .scrutiny~ all the ·hospitals, OUt-
)lolises, gardens~ -va:ults;· ate. with special referenc~ not
only·to their appearance, but their relative position to
each'other; so as.to be sure that nothing was.overlook..
ed; I was unable to discern any·resemblance whatever
~etween .~d· buildin~, 'in whole o~ .part; ~nd that por~
~1on of sa1d mal? furnished by·Mana Mo~k. ·The only
resemblance bemg that betwee~ the outs1de walls, and
the ground plan in .said .map; which, she says, was
furnished by another.hand. All the interior ,is unlike
her plan in every respect; and inasmuch· as most, if
not all, of the ·partitiqn walls are commenced in the
cellar, and built of heavy, stone, it'is impossible, in
the natu.re of the case, that the building should h'ave
been su altered as to make this discrepancy; for, to say
nothing of the laQour BI.ld.expense and publicity ofsuch
a work, the walls and wood-work bear that appearance
·of age which.cannot be counterfeited. · When the Nuns

acces~ to the whol~ _
ofthe C~oister~ department; and
I was assured that as soon as he should return to the
city, ·such permit should be had. . , . ,
: "I further more certify, that having been inform~
that a permi~ had been obtained for a part)' to visit
and examine said H&tel·Dieu Nunnery, .and that I was
requested to make one of the number ; I did, ·on the
15th of July7.1836, after the Rev.
. G. W. .Perkins had
l;»een added to the number' go in company with the said
party, consisting of Rev. G. W. Perkins, oftheAme-~
rican Pres; Church, . Rev. H. Esson, or the Scotch
Pres. Church,· Benjainin Holmes, ·. Esq., cashier of
the Montreal Bank; Protestants, .and J~ Jone·s, pub-
lisher of L'Ami du Peuple, a Roman Catholic, and
commencing at the General' Hospital and Chapel," I
examined, in company ·with these gentlemen, all the
remainder of·the buil~ings·and grounds .ofsaid H&tel
Die:u and Nunnery, until we baa-repeatedly traversed
every section -of the ·same. We examined·closely the
walls, windows, doors, rooms, vaul~,-&c~, and com-
pared the same with Maria Monk's printed plan and
description .of what she denominated the Black N.un-
nery ;.and I freely declare, that after the closests~!lrch,
during which the Lady Superior; and several Nuns,
stood ready to lead in every direction and give every
assistance, we were unable to discover the remotest
resemblance between any part·ofthe said building and
the plan or description ofMaria Monk. I further more
assert, that I do not believe it possible that any persons ..
could have made these alteratons in the building, that
would have produced this discrepancy, without having
torn down and re-built the Nunnery from the roof to
the ground.- We examined the burial place, .and the
register of deaths, commencing with the foundation of
~be Convent; We .examined, also, the. register in
which are entered the names, ages, and dates of the
!aking the veil ofeach·Nun: To ascertain whether this
was the real register, I . called for the name ofa Nun
with whom I had become acquainted about one year
102
aince, and ~as immediately referred to it. In this-~e­
cord, which was an old book, there were· no erasures,
no mutilations.' We searched for the na.me of Maria
Monk, . and-others mentioned in her book; DO such
riames were ·there. · In conclusion, 1·declare to all

reasons. . The detailed plan presents partition walls on
the first and second atoriest which have no correspond-
ence with e.ach other, COJDIIlencing and ending on each,,
separate story; whereas it is n~ces~~ that _
such walls
should not only correspond w1th each other, but ' that
they should commence in the cellar ; also the second

in August, 1835, and who had the impudenc~ to offer
112
himselfto the notice of several honourable men, as an
investi~tor of the truth·of certain rumours concerning
the priests and. nuns· of which he himself 'was the
Author ! ·. The ·wretch .was scorned :as he deserv·.~d.
"Judge.Turner" of Vermont, who foolishly counte•
nanced him for a brief period, doubtlessly in conse-
quence of having discovered his cohabitation with'the
prete~ded ex-nun, withdrew from his society. .·

" District of Montreal, Proviu~e of Lower Canada :
"Before ine, W: Robertson, one of hi~ Majesty's
Justices of the-Peace for .the District of Montreal, -ap-
peared Catherine Conners of Montreal; she having
made oath on the Holy Evangelists, ·to say the truth
and nothing but the truth, declared and' said' what
follows: · I
" Towards the 19th. of August last, two men and a
wotitan caine to the Ea:change Coffee House; their
names were written i~ the book, one J>y the name of
Judge Turner, ana the other as Mr. Boyte; the name
.of the woman was not written in the book in which the
· names oftravellers are written, because I was inform-
ed that they were taking a single room with two beds.
Some time after another room was given to them for
their accommodation; the woman passed for the wife
of Mr. Hoyte.
· '~The day following, when I was making the bed, I
found the woman in tears. Having made the remark
to her that her child was a very young traveller' she
replied, that she had not the power to dispense with
the journey for they had travelled on business of im-
portance ; she also said that she had never had a day
of happiness since she left Montreal, which was four
years, with Mr. Boyte; she expressed a wish to go and
see her father. She entreated me to try and procure
secretly clothes for her, for Mr. ·Hoyte wished to dine
with her in his own room, in which he was then taking
care of the child. I gave her·my shawl and bonnet,
and conducted her secretly out by the street St. Pierre;I
she never retur'led, and left the child in the hands of
:Mr-
. Boyte. .She said t~at her husband was a Metho_

returned to the.room, Mr. Hoyte was still taking care·
of the child : he asked me ·if. I·had seen his lady ; ,I
said no. Upon this question he told me that .t~e
father of his lady' was dead, -
that her mother yet lived
in the suburbs of Quebec, and he asked me for all the
clothes which J had given to wash for him, his_lady
·and child ; clothes the lady had taken from the port-
manteau which they ·had. Beyond that, I perceived
nothing remarkable, except that Mr. Hoyte wished to
conceal this woman, and to prevent her from going
out. I heard the judge say ·to him " now she is

No. 33. Evidence of_Mrs. Monk. 11
[For the important evidence upon oath of Mrs..
Monk, the mother of Maria, see page 19, et seq.] .
We are informed that Mrs. Monk's evidence on the
material question of her daughter's residence in the
Hatel Dieu Convent has been disputed on some un-
i~aginable ground 'of interest and secret influence. It.
is unnecessary to draw comparisons between Mrs. Monk -
and her unh~ppy daughter; but we are bound to state,
that in her situation in life Mrs. Monk is regarded and
esteemed. Her good conduct and management, at the
Government House, ·has secured to her, for ·many
years, .a situation of trust, and will continue to secure.
to her a decent subsistence to the end ofher days. The
attempt made to bribe Mrs. Monk was rept'ated in re-
114
gard to other persons. Miss Louise Bousquet, of St.
Denis, was induced to visit Montreal on afalse induce-
ment, which the parties were frightened from following
up hy an explanation of their real intentions. The
evidence of Miss Bousquet (No. 5,) refers to Ambroise
Vigeant. · ,

" Province of Lower Canada : ·
-•. " ,This 26th day of July, eighteen hundred and
thirty-six, appeared before me, Benjamin Holmes, one
ofhis Majesty's Justices ofthe Peace for the District
of Montreal; Ambroise Vigeaut, who, having been
sworn·on the Holy Evangelists, declared : ·
"That deponent had attended a school kept by the so
called Maria Monk at St. Denis, for the space of about
two months, in the year eighteen hundred·and thirty-
three ; .that whilst deponent attended her school, she
kept it at two different places; -first, in the house' of
MIChael. Guertin, farmer, a9d subsequently, in the
house of Jean Baptiste Laftamme dit Timineur ; that
pi'~viously to his attendance at the said .school, depo-
nent had understood·that the said Maria had resided at ·
St. Denis arid in the neighbourhood for several months;
th_
at subsequently to his departure from the said school,
he had understood that the said. Maria remained resid-
ing in and about St. Denis for several months; and de--
lH>nent particularly declared, that he saw 'the said Maria
at St. Denis on the twenty-ninth day ofJune, one thou-
sand eight hundred and thirty-four, being the day ·on
which my Lord the Bishop of Telmesse there adminis-
te.red confirmation; and deponent further declared, that
in the summer of eighteen hundred and thirty-five, the
said Maria. accompanied by a man, whose name is un-
known to deponent, came to the bar of Philip Lavoiel,
tavern-keeper, residing in the main street of the St.
Lawrence suburbs, city of Montreal, where deponent
was employed ; that the said Maria and the said nian
having conversed for a long.time together, the sai<_l
Maria requested deponent to write to Miss Louise Bous-
quet of St. Denis, and say to her, <?n behalf ofthe said ··
Maria, that the said Maria had two hundred pounds

The associates, defeated in'their attempts to suborn
witnesses, defeated in their expectation of Protestant
. illiberality in Canada, departed from it. · ·
The admirable, noble, and generous conduct.'ofthe ·.-·
Protestants of Lower Canada, in relation··to these · .
"Awful Disclosures,'! is an example to all nations and
all communities. Each man pressed forward with his
· unsolicited tE;stimony in the cause of insu~ted virtue j •
the press echoed the .public voice, and in .. accents of ·
deep an.
d eloquent indignation, reprobated the unap-
proachable infamy of," We the Subscribers" . :
The act of accusation, brought by " We, the Sub- .
scribers," against. the priests and nuns of Lower
Canada, recalls the proceedings of the Gallican revo-
lutionary assassins on the trial of Marie Antoinette.
When that persecuted princess was charged before a
fanatical tribunal with an impossible ct:ime, she turned
from the tigers to her fellow creatures, and exclaimed,
" I appeal to the hearts of mothers;''

APPENDIX.
Since the preceding was sent to press, I have met
with·the following interesting extractin a book entitled·
" Men and Manners in America," by the popular and
talented author of " Cyril Thornton." It was pub- "
lishe4.by Cadell, Strand, London, in 1833. I may adc1.
the respectable writer is not a member of the Catholic
faith. The Convent he alludes to, is, I presume, that
of the " .Grey Sisters" mentioned in Col. Stone's Nar-
rative:-- . ·
"There are several Convents in Montreal, one ofwhich I viaited,
m company with an eminent merchant of the city. The building
ls commodioua and e.lLtensive, and the establishment conaiatl of a
mire n~pirieure, a11.d twenty-four nuns. Ita funds, which are con-
siderable, ·are devoted to purposes of charity ; and I aaw a little
troop of orphans, whom they support and educate. There is like-
wise an hoapital for the insane and incurable, which I declined
viaitiog.. I aaw aeveral of the sisters,-pale, unearthly-looking ,
beingo,-who, accustomed to the ministrations of the sick-bed, lit
'about with noiselesi steps, and speak in a low and subdued tone.
Their garb is peculiar. It consists of a gown of light drab, plain
mualin cap, black hood, a aort of tippet of white linen, and the
usual adjuncts of rosary and crucifix.
" The interest excited by this pioua and benevolent inatitution
waa certainly not diminiabed by the ·communication• of my com·
panion. •It ii impoasible,' he aaid, •that I can look on thia
establishment, without feelings of the deepeat gratitude. Thirty-
five yean ago, I came to tbia city a pennileas and friendleas boy;
and I hac! not one friend or connection in the colony from whom I
might expect kindneu. Shortly after my arrival, I fell aick. I
could not work, and wu utterly destitl1te of the means of aubaiat- ~
ence. In thia aituation, these charitable nuns received me iqto
this houae, nuned me with tenderness, through a long and grievous
illness, and aupplied me with the means of support, until, by my
own labour, I wu enabled to rid them of the burden. By God's
providence, I have pr011pered in the world. I am now rich, but
never do I pus the gates ofthia institution without a silent bleuing
on ita humble and pioua inmates.' "-Vol. n . Chap. 8. ,
. P.S.-There is a possibility that this little pamphlet
may give displeasure to some zealous persons, whose
favo•trite pursuit is to sink Catholicity in the estimation
ofothe!s ; if so, and I should be honoured by the notice
of such, I trust they will also honour me with their
names. If wea re to contend-let it be openly--can-
didly-and charitably;--and may God defend the right!
