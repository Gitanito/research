  		              		Experience Description   

    My accident happened after lunch outside the school cafeteria. It was customary to help the janitor take the trash outside to the dumpsters. There was a side-door with two to three concrete steps going down. This is where the accident occurred. I fell and hit my head unsupported on one of these concrete steps. I don't remember the accident. The circumstances are vague. 

  What I do vividly recall, is finding myself floating over a scene unfolding on the ground below me. It was a very surreal experience in hindsight. But at the time my Being was without negative feelings  like fright, anxiety, concern, etc. It was a completely peaceful feeling. It was very natural and I had no  worries. I know I was very young at the time, but I am able to still experience it as it happened all these many years later. As I floated over the scene, I witnessed the other kids below me who were huddled around my body. Somewhere along the line, they moved my body closer to the large trash dumpster which was top loading type and had wood steps with platform to reach it. 

  Why they moved my body, I'm not sure. It was speculated later that this was done by the administrators at the school to cover up how the accident happened. But they did move my body and I did watch them do it. This is an important point, because there was a court deposition made by me where I testified that they moved my body and the judge asked me how I knew this. In a matter of fact way, I told him I watched them do it. I was floating up above watching them. The judge was skeptical. I was  5 years old, and  wasn't just making it up. How and why would I? It was confusing to them. I didn't think it was confusing and thought it was natural. 
  
  After floating above my body for some time, I began to slowly rise. I remember the large trees that I began to float above and past. I didn't get much higher than that. Then I  shot back down. 

  My next recollection was briefly regaining consciousness in the back of my mother's car as she rushed me to the hospital. The school didn't  call an ambulance. Times were different back then I suppose. I was in a semi-coma for a few days at the hospital. I regained consciousness abruptly at night by myself in a hospital room a few floors up. I got out of bed, walked to the window and was freaked out because I didn't know where I was at. 
  
  The thing that stands out about the whole experience was the feeling. It was a feeling of complete peace unlike anything felt before or since. I know I was very young, but the feeling was very mature beyond my years at the time. It was the feeling of peace, content, acceptance of the circumstance without question. It wasn't  something that I questioned and it was totally natural. I do have the sense that I was sent back for a purpose, but I'm not sure what that may be. I don't live a perfect life. I do have strong morals, but not a passive life either. I suppose someday my questions will be answered. Until then I don't fear death but I don't embrace it either.
