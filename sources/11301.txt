I saw a very bright light. My deceased father was there. My father stated that he forgave me. 

My father passed away when I was sixteen from lung cancer. I was very mean and not understanding. I have always regretted the way I treated him.  He was a very kind and devoted father. I never understood that until I had children of my own. At the time of my experience, I was having trouble with my own teenage daughter.

I know this was not a dream. The emotion and peace that I felt when I woke up was nothing of this world.

My husband had and still does have great concerns while I sleep. I have been tested three times for sleep apnea. My husband will contest that I stop breathing and it will be quite a few seconds before I start again. My husband insist that I use a device to help regulate my breathing. I am now very compliant.
