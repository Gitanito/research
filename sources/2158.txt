PREFACE.
After the numerous works which have appeared, pro
fessing to teach the elements of the English Language,
some of them under the superintendance of gentlemen of
undoubted talent, and to whose labours the public have
awarded the highest meed ofpraise, I am assured that the
reasons ought to be given, which have induced me to
enter the field in this department of School Literature.
However, a short statement of those reasons must suffice
in this place, as they are fully explained in the body of
thework,ofthe meritsof which work the enlightened Public
will be the bestable tojudge when compared with previous
Grammars.
DR. LouTH affirms, “That if children were taught
the common principles of English Grammarby some short
and clear system, in which rules are laid down and illus
trated by examples, they would not be engaged so long
as they are, with so much labour of the memory, and so
little assistance of the understanding.”
In this assertion I fully acquiesce, as being my decided
conviction, based on practical application; and the plan
is here carried out in all its bearings.
It is universally allowed by all preceptors, who have
laboured to assist the juvenile mind in the study ofGram
mar, that practical illustrations, in conjunction with theo
retical instructions, are alone calculated to effect that
purpose. In these essentials, I have endeavoured to be as
full and as explicit as possible.
Mr. Lindley Murray's Grammar is generally under
stood to be the best, because it is the most popular; but
this is a mistaken notion; for his definitions are so com
plex, and so difficult to be understood, as to render them
oflittle utility. Notwithstanding, it contains some excel
lencies, such as the collection of opinions of different
*

men of learning upon the English Language. And for
this reason, it appears better adapted than any previous
Grammar to the general purposes of education. Never
theless, it is defective, for there are many rules of import
ance unnoticed by him.
Mr. Murray's rules must be committed to memory in
a kind of philosophical phraseology, of which the pupil
can comprehend but little, except he discovers that his
mind is burthened, and his judgment very little improved.
His syntactical rules are perplexing to the learner, from
their inconclusiveness. In some cases, where difference
of opinions prevailed among the authors from whom his
work is compiled, he has shrewdly left thelearner to decide
for himself. An excellent writer observes, “A Grammar,
to be valuable, must be comprehensive,—a guide in diffi
culty, as well as in easy cases; because, ifin such instances,
it affords us no assistance, what is there that can supply
its place P”
Mr. Murray's rules are unfit for learners, from their
defectiveness; they lead adult minds, much more those
of children, into difficulties, out of which the exercises
and notes are unable to extricate them. In short, his
whole work is so intricate, that the youthful aspirant,
unless imbued with uncommon perseverance, is almost
driven to despair of ever becoming master of his verna
cular tongue. *
Mr. Cobbett's Grammar is an ingenious commentary
upon the translation of the Latin Grammar. However,
it is written in that loose kind of syle which abounds
with circumlocution and a multitude of words. It is unfit
for schools, from its peculiar arrangement and incomplete
ness ofpractical illustrations. In his critical disquisitions,
it is obvious, in many parts, he has violated his own rules.
But there is a stronger objection to Mr. Cobbett's Gram
mar, even if itpossessed every other qualification that could
render a Grammar complete; it is so tinged with political
allusions and personal animosity, as to render it totally
unfit for general adoption.
Lennie, Guy, Blair, Pinnock, M’Cullock, and others
of minor importance, have aimed at rendering the gram
matical structure of our language comprehensive; this
they have in some measure accomplished; but even their
works are not sufficient guides in difficulties.
PREFACE. V
This work possessesmore originality than generallyfalls
to the share of English Grammars; yet I hesitate not to
acknowledge, that I am under some obligation to most of
the previously mentioned authors; also to Mr. Hiley,
whose work is decidedly the best. These I have brought
to the test of practical experience; and whilst it contains
all their good qualities, I have endeavoured to make those
parts in which they are obscure, more intelligible; and to
lay down a series ofrules, which, whilst they neither fatigue
the memory, nor perplex the understanding, render the
attainment of a knowledge of correct English language
comparatively easy and attractive.
I am aware of the difficulty connected with the intro
duction of a new treatise, and the questionable view in
which the first attempt of an author is beheld, by those
who are in possession ofthe field of literature, as if he had
peremptorily entered upon forbidden ground; and unless
his work not only possesses improvements the most strik
ingly important, at the slightest glance, but is also exhi
bited to public notice by efforts the mostpopular, “itmay
remain almost unknown, and for ever neglected.”
It is to be desired that our reviewing literati, those
arbiters of the fate of authors and their works, were
possessed with the spirit of impartiality, equal to their
great abilities, and would judge of the practical utility
ofa Grammar, as well as of its philosophical and theo
retical principles. -
The utility of this work may, in some measure, be seen
by the simplicity in which it is arranged, as well as by
the additional branches of whichit treats, in order to make
an accomplished and a correct speaker. For, besides the
common divisions of Orthography, Etymology, Syntax,
and Prosody; it treats of Style, Rhetoric, and Compo
sition.
Orthography is briefly treated, but sufficiently long for
every useful purpose. No rules for spelling are inserted.
It is impossible to lay down any particular rules for the
spelling of the English language. The best and most
expeditious method of teaching to spell, is by writing
and dictation. Let the teacher read slowly to his pupils
a portion of any correct composition, and desire them to
write it. When this is done, he must examine it, point
V1 PREFACE.
out those words which are incorrect, and then desire the
Pupil to correct them. As for the powers or sounds of
' the learner may trust to judicious imitation and
experience, or he may consult such a Dictionary as
Walker's. |
Under Etymology, our language is divided into com
ponent classes, in one or other of which every word has
found a place. Grammarians differ concerning the num
ber of the parts of speech. The general number, how
ever, is nine; and rather than enter into any lengthened
discussion on the subject, I admit that number. It con
tains full, clear, and indispensible explanations of the
nature and properties of the parts of speech, the princi
ples of which are inculcated by practical illustrations and
explanatory remarks. The definitions are plain and con
cise. Those portions essential to be committed to memory
are printed in a larger type; those parts which are easily
gained by careful perusal are in a smaller type; that which
can be retained only by frequent repetition, is worked in
the mind by numerous exercises.
Some terms used in the moods and tenses of verbs have
been discarded, and others more appropriate are substi
tuted. I have made use of four kinds of verbs, and my
reasons for doing so, are given in their proper place. The
subjunctive mood is rendered plain, and easy to be
understood. *
As “nothing contributes more to arrest the attention
and assist the judgment of persons learning Grammar,”
nor is any method more advantageous in facilitating their
improvement, and alleviating the labour of the teacher,
than pertinent questions, every part of speech is followed
by questions and exercises in parsing, arranged in the
order in which they should be studied. By this method,
one part ofspeech is impressed on the mind before the pupil
is allowed to proceed. After these, come a specimen of
promiscuous etymological parsing, with a table of ques
tions, and about fifty lessons, for the investigating and
confirming of the pupil's knowledge of Etymology.
Under Syntax, I have endeavoured to place the rules
in the order in which they most frequently occur; and
those which are most easy to be understood precede those
which are more difficult. All are of utility, and all must
PREFACE. vii
be learned, to have a perfect knowledge of the language.
The arrangement may not please all, yet I consider it
the most advantageous method. The reader may be sur
prised to see so many rules. Let me observe, that my
predecessors have exceptions and notes, together with
complex rules, all of which must be committed to memory,
which increase, in a tenfold degree, the difficulty of under
standing and applying them. Let these be brought in
juxta-position with my rules, and they will be found to
be half as long again. My rules, besides being very short,
aremadeextremelysimple,andarealmostwithoutanexcep
tion. New rules are also inserted, which cast light upon
things which have hitherto been obscure. They are
illustrated and exemplified; broken into answers and fur
nished with appropriate questions, by which the pupil
will fully understand each rule before he proceed to correct
the exercises connected with it. \
I have endeavoured not only to select the shortest sell
tenses of false construction, but also that they contain some
moral and important principle, or convey some useful
information. Even sentiments of a religious nature are
thought not improper to be occasionally inserted. Care has
also been taken to avoid selecting those sentences which
are glaringly erroneous, and which do notgenerally occur
in the conversation of persons of a tolerable education.
If there are any deviations from these principles, they
are generally confined to those rules, which, from the
nature of them, could not have been otherwise clearly
exemplified to young minds. - -
Some of the rules contain many more violations than
others. This has arisen from their importance, and from
the variety requisite to exemplify them properly. When
a few instances have afforded sufficientexercises, the pupil
is not fatigued with a repetition, which casts no new light .
on the rule. In order that the rules may be easily under
stood, and their violations readily perceived, the violations
immediately succeed them. That the ingenuity of the
learner may be exercised, and to render him master of
his rules, exercises, promiscuously disposed, are inserted
after every three or four.
Under Punctuation, are given ample rules and exer
cises, by which the sense and proper delivery of every
viii PREFACE.
sentence may be ascertained. Besides the usual number
of points used in punctuation, is inserted the reading
pause, the use and utility of which are noticed.
Under Prosody, is found the usual information—the
method of scanning verses, with sufficient examples and
exercises. Also a description of Poetry, and the different
kinds into which it is divided.
Style is simplified; the rules are reduced to practice
by exercises, and will be readily understood. By strict
attention to thispart, the pupil may become a clear,perspi
cuous, correct, and forcible writer and speaker. Rhetoric,
or Figurative Style, is a new feature to similar publica
tions; it is concise, yet full, containing every figure that
can be used, with its original importin Greek; the utility
of which is seen under its own head.
Composition is of such intrinsic worth, that comment
on its utility, or recommendation to the study of it, is
unnecessary. I commence with the simplest rules, and
proceed in a uniform gradation, from the writing of
names,to thedescribing ofobjects, to the writing of themes,
to orations, to logical arguments, and to subjects requiring
the full employment of highly cultivated faculties.
The last article which claims our attention, is the KEY.
As many of the promiscuous syntactical exercises, as well
as those under style, contain several errors in the same
sentence, it is considered necessary to supply a Key, to
assist young men, and others who have not the opportu
nity of learning under a competent preceptor. As this
Grammar contains so many exercises, a separate book of
them is unnecessary.
In conclusion, I take leave to state, that though care has
been taken to prevent mistakes and defects, I am conscious
that inaccuracies may be found. I am open to convic
tion; and shall carefully attend to any remarks, liberal
criticisms, and suggestions that may be given, in order
that it may be made more efficiently, “The Practical
Self-Teaching Grammar of the English Language.”

ENGLISH GRAMMAR.
*
ENGLISH GRAMMAR is the art of speaking and writing
the English language with propriety.
It is divided into four parts, namely, orTHoGRAPHY,
ETYMOLOGY, syntAX, and PROsODY.
Orthography is a word made up of two Greek words—from
op60ç, (orthos) correct, and yoapa, (grapho) I write.
PART I.
ORTHOGRAPHY.
1. ORTHog RAPHY teaches the forms and sounds of
letters, and the just method of spelling words.
2. A letter is the least part of a word, and represents
the sounds of the human voice.
3. The letters of the English language, called the
English Alphabet, are twenty-sia, in number.
4. Letters are divided into vowels and consonants.
5. A vowel is an articulate sound, which can be per
fectly uttered by itself; as a, e, 0.
6. The vowels are a, e, i, o, u, w, and y. W and
are consonants when they begin a word or syllable; but
in every other situation they are vowels.
7 A consonant cannot be sounded distinctly without
the aid of a vowel; as, b, c, d, f, l.
8. Consonants are divided into mutes and semi-vowels.
9. The mutes cannot be sounded at all without the aid
of a vowel. They are b, p, t, d, k, and c and g hard.
10. The semi-vowels are such as have an imperfect
sound of themselves. They are f, l, m, n, r, v, s, z, a, and
c and g soft.
11. Four of these semi-vowels, viz. l, m, n, and r, are
called liquids, because after a mute, their sound is some
what liquidated or diminished, by easily uniting with the
preceding short vowel.
P
2 ENGLISH GRAMMAR.
12. Consonants are also divided into labials; as, b, f, p,
v, which are sounded by the lips; into dentals, which are
sounded by the teeth; as d, s, t, z, and soft g or j; into
gutturals, which are sounded by the throat, as k, q, and c
and g hard; into nasals, which are sounded by the nose,
as, m, n, and ng.

LESSON SECOND.
OF SYLLABLEs AND WoRDs.
1. A syILABLE is a word or as much as can be sounded
at Once ; as, ant.
2. Words are articulate sounds, used by common con
sent, as signs of our ideas.
3. In every word there are as many syllables as there
are distinct sounds; as, or-tho-gra-phy.
4. A word of onE syllable is termed a Mono-syllable;
as, fox, cow, school.
5. A word of Two syllables is termed a dis-syllable;
as, ink-stand.
6. A word of THREE syllables is termed a tris-syllable;
as, but-ter-fly.
7. A word of Four or MoRE syllables is termed a poly
syllable.
8. MoNo signifies one; DIs, two; TRIs, three; Poly,
many.
9. A DIPTHONG is the union of two vowels in one syl
lable; as, ea in beat.
10. A PROPER dipthong is one in which both the
vowels are sounded; as, oy in boy.
11. An IMPROPER dipthong has only one of the
vowels sounded; as, ea in eagle.
12. A TRIPTHoNG is the union of three vowels in the
same syllable; as, iew in view.
----------
ORTHOGRAPHY. 3
13. All words are either primitive, derivative, simple,
or compound. -
14. A PRIMITIVE word is not derived from any other
word in the language; as, art, kind, good, man.
15. A DERIVATIVE word is that which is derived from
another word; as, goodness from good; manful from man;
wisdom from wise.
16. A sIMPLE word is that which is not made up of
more than one; as, school, boy, desk, pen.
17. A comPounD word is formed by the union of two
or more primitive words; as, school-master from School
Master.
18. When compound words are considered as perma
ment, they are united; as, horsemen; but when they are
not considered as permanent, they are joined together by
the hyphen; as, sea-horse.

PART II.
ETY MOLOGY.
LESSON THIRD. *
1. The seconD part of Grammar is Etymology, which
treats ofthe different sorts of words, their various changes,
and their derivations.
Etymology, from eruoc (etumos) true, and Noyoc (logos) word.
2. There are in English nine parts of speech; namely,
article, noun, adjective, pronoun, verb, adverb, preposition,
interjection, and conjunction.
3. An ARTICLE is a word put before nouns, to limit
their signification; as, a pen, the man, an apple, the apples.
4. In English there are but two Articles, a and the ; a
becomes an before a vowel, and before a silent h; as, an
acorn, an hour.
5. A is used before words beginning with a consonant;
as, a tree; before the long sound of u, and before w and
y; as, a unit, a ewe, a week, a year, such a one.-.1n is
used instead of a before a vowel or silent h, and in words
beginning with h sounded, when the accent is on the
second syllable; as, an heroic action.
Words beginning with silent h are, heir, herb, honest, honour,
hospital, hour, humour, humble, and their derivatives.
6. A or an is called the indefinite ARTICLE, because
it does not point out a particular person or thing; as, give
me a pen: that is any pen.
7. The is called the definite article, because it refers to
a particular person or thing; as, the pen: that is some
particular pen.
8. An is used before nouns in the singular number only.
.4 is sometimes used before the plural nouns, when preceded
by such phrases as, a few, and great many; as, a few
men, a great many apples: before collective words; as,
a dozen, a score.
9. The is used before nouns in both numbers; and
sometimes before adverbs in the comparative and superla
tive degree; as, the more I study grammar the better I
like it.
10. A noun without an article put before it, is taken
either in its widest sense, as comprehending the whole of
ETYMOLOGY. 5
its species; as, “Man is mortal,” that is, all mankind;
or, in an indefinite sense, denoting a quantity, but not the
whole; as, “There are men destitute of prudence;" that
is, some men.

illiterate man, an handkerchief, a open field.
- LESSON FOUR.
OF NOUNS.
1. A noun is the name of any thing, person, or place;
as, horseman, Sheffield.
ILLUSTRATION.—Every thing that we can hear, touch, see, smell,
taste, or conceive to exist, whether material or immaterial; or
whatever has a name is a moun; wind, hat, light, scent, bread, are
nouns, because they are names. Honour, wickedness, goodness, hope,
are all nouns, for though we can neither see nor hear them, yet
we can conceive such things to exist; as, “He was held in honour.”
“The wickedness of the people.” “Hope cheered him.” “His
goodness was known.”
2. Nouns are either common or proper.
3. Common nouns are the names of things in general,
or when they apply to all individuals of one kind; as,
desk, man, table, chairs. -
ILLUSTRATION.—Common nouns are those words which denote
the names of things containing many classes or individuals; and
the name is common to every individual of that class; as, trees,
men, boys, apples, animals. There are many classes of trees, men,
boys, apples, and animals, and many individuals in these classes,
but the name trees, men, boys, apples, animals, is common to every
individual of the class.
4. Proper nouns are the namesgiven to places, persons,
seas, &c., to distinguish them from other places, persons,
seas, and so on; as, Whiston, John, Mediterranean Sea.
6 ENGLISH GRAMMAR.
5. Proper nouns take no article before them, because
the extent of their meaning is pointed out in the word
itself; as, John, London.
6. Proper nouns have the plural only when they refer
to a race or family of persons; as, the Elliotts, or the
four Georges.
7. Proper nouns become common by having an article
prefixed to them; as, “He is the Newton of his age.”
8. Collective nouns are those nouns which, in the sin
gular number,denote many; as, multitude,people, crowd.
9. Abstract nouns are the names of qualities consi
dered as abstracted from their substances; as, wisdom,
wickedness.
10. Verbalandparticipalnouns are such as are derived
from verbs and participals; as, reading, from read.
QUESTIONS AND EXERCISES.
1. What is a noun? A noun is the name, &c.
What is the noun in this sentence—Where is George 2 George.
Why? Because it is the name of a person. Show me your book?
Book. Why? Because it is the name of a thing. Where is the
dog? Which man? Bring my hat. Beware of idleness. Flee
from vice. Never sport with distress. Love virtue. Assist
modest merit.

LESSON FIVE.
I. Nouns are varied by number, gender, and case.
OF NUMBER.
1. Number is the distinction of one from more.
2. Nouns have two numbers, the singular and the
plural.
3. The singular expresses one object; as,a pen, a desk.
The plural expresses more objects than one, as pens, desks.
4. RULE1. The plural of nouns is generally formed by
adding s to the singular; as, book, books.
ExERCISEs.—Whether is chair singular or plural? Singular.
Why? Because it denotes only one. Which is the noun in this
sentence—Read your books? Books. Why? Because it is the
name of some thing. What number? Plural. Why? Because
it denotes more than one.
ETYMOLOGY. 7
Tell the nouns and number in the following sentences:—I like
nuts. An inkstand. John's hat. Your pen. A good boy.
Fruit delicious. Shun bad company. Never sport with distress.
An odourous garden. We ought to love virtue. Flee from vice.
A final reward. An open countenance. Regions gloomy. A
dignified character. 1. How are mouns varied? What is number?
2. How many numbers have nouns? 3. What does the singular
express? What does the plural express?
Repeat the first Rule. Answer. The plural of nouns &c.
1. Whether is chairs singular or plural ? Plural. Why?
Because it means more than one. What number is a desk? Sin
gular. Why? Because it expresses only one.
OBSERVATION.—Ask the pupil whether each of the following
words is singular or plural, and why:
Top, school, man, boy, girl, desk, pens, streets, shoe, pig, colt,
fire, son, slates, lanes, clock, time, hat, peg, apple, voyage, sea,
ship, mind, heart.
RULE 2. Nouns ending in s, sh, ch, a, or o, after a con
sonant, form the plural by adding es; as, Miss, Misses;
lash, lashes ; church, churches ; foal, foales ; hero,
heroes. Nouns ending in ch, sounding as k, form the
plural in the regular way; as, stomach, stomachs.
Nouns ending in io,withjunto, canto, tyro,grotto,portico,
solo, and quarto, have s only in the plural; as, junto,
juntos; canto, cantos; tyro, tyros.
The pupil should spell the plural of the following nouns, and
tell the rule every word:—Spell the plural of fish. Fishes. Why?
Because mouns ending in sh form the plural by adding es. Spell
the plural of church, lass, fox, mass, match, rebus, flash, dish,
monarch, distich, puss, bolus, heiress, tax, pinch, goldfinch,touch.
RULE 3.—Nouns in forfe change for fe into ves in
the plural; as, loaf, loaves; life, lives. Butnouns in f
form their plural by adding s, as, muff, muffs; except
staff, which sometimes has staves; though the compounds
of staff are regular, as flagstaff, flagstaffs.
Brief, chief, dwarf, fife, grief, gulf, handkerchief, hoof, kerchief,
mischief, proof, roof, reproof, scarf, strife, surf, turf, and warf,
never change forfe into ves, but only have s added.
ExERCISEs.—Spell the plural of life. Lives. Why not lifs?
Because mouns in forfe change forfe into ves. Spell the plural
of calf, half, wolf, hoof, cuff, thief, shelf, proof, snuff, turf, gulf,
roof, brief, cliff, knife, leaf, relief, muff, handkerchief, kerchief,
stuff.
RULE 4.—Nouns in y, after a consonant, change y into
ies in the plural; as, lady, ladies. But y with a vowel
before it is not changed; as, boy, boys; also proper names;
as, Henry, the Henries.
8 ENGLISH GRAMMAR.
Spell the plural of fly. Flies. Spell the plural of day. Days.
Why not dies? Because y with a vowel before it is not changed.
Which is the vowel? A.
Write or spell the plural of the following nouns:—Spy, beauty,
cry, cherry, covey, duty, folly, alley, play, toy, glory, lily, fancy,
history, journey, enemy, city, relay, money, key, booby.
RULE 5.—Some nouns form their plural irregularly;
as, man, men; child, children; woman, women; foot,
feet; goose, geese; mouse, mice; louse, lice; tooth,
teeth; or, oven; penny, pence; and pennies to denote
the distinct pieces ofcoin. Brother, brothers, when applied
to persons of the same family; brethren, to persons of the
same society. We may say Turkoman, Turkomans;
Mussulman, Mussulmans; although men, in the plural,
would be more elegant.
6. Sow or swine makes sows or swine; die (for gaming)
makes dice; die (for coining) dies; aid-de-camp, aids
de-camp; court-martial, courts-martial; cousin-german,
cousins-german ; father-in-law, fathers-in-law; peas
denote the seeds as distinct objects; pease, the seeds in a
in188S.
What is the plural of man? Men. Spell the plural of tooth,
mouse, louse, foot, woman, or, penny, sow, alderman, die, (for play)
die, (for coining) Mussulman, &c.
OBSERVATION.—Proper nouns of individuals, when pluralized,
are in some degree common, and admit the same rule and an arti
cle; as, the Catoes, the Henries, the Plantagenets.
2. The proper names of nations are generally plural; except in
a direct address, they are usually construed with the definite
article; as, the Germans, the Romans, the Greeks.
WORDS WHICH HAVE NO PLURAL TERMINATION.
1.—There are some nouns which have no plural; such as those
which express the qualities, propensities, or feelings of the mind;
as honesty, meekness, and compassion; names of metals, herbs,
minerals, liquids, vices, virtues, and fleshy substances, and things
that are weighed or measured, are in general singular, and almost
all sorts of grains: There are exceptions here, for while wheat
has no plural, oats have seldom any singular.
2. Some words denote plurality without a plural termination;
as, deer, sheep, hose, folk, swine, trout, salmon, &c. The sin
gular of these nouns is generally distinguished by the article a ;
as, a sheep, a deer.
3. Alms and riches are generally considered plural. Pains is
singular or plural; but for the most part is used in the plural.
4. The words brace, dozen, pair, score, hundred, &c., when used
with a numerical adjective, retain the singular form; as, several
pair, three brace; but otherwise, they take the plural form; as,
“He bought partridges in braces, and books in dozens.”
ETYMOLOGY. 9
5.–Cannon, shot, and sail, are used in a plural sense. The
words horse, foot, and infantry, comprehending bodies of soldiers,
are used as plural, and followed by verbs in the plural; as, a
thousand horse were ready; ten thousand foot were there.-Men is
understood.
6. The following nouns, having the plural termination, must be
considered as plural, and must bejoined to verbs in the plural; as,
Annals Customs Literati Snuffers
Antipodes Data Lungs Scissors
Archieves l)rawers Minutiae Shears
Ashes Downs Manners Shambles
Assets Dregs Matins Sessions
Bellows Embers Mallows Tidings
Betters Entrails Nippers Tongs
Bowels Fetters Odds Thanks
Breeches Filings Orgies Trowsers
Compasses Goods Pains Vespers
Clothes Hatches Pincers Vitals
Calends Ides Pleiads Victuals
Credenda Lees Riches Wages
The singular of literati is made by saying one of the literati.
Bandit is generally used in the singular of banditti. Pains, pre
ceded by great, has a plural verb. The word much should never
be joined to a plural noun; thus, “much pains have been taken,”
should be “great pains, &c.” Much is sometimes joined with col
lective nouns, but these denote number in the aggregate; as, much
company.
7. The following nouns have generally a plural termination, but
sometimes are used with a singular verb:—Amends, alms, billiards,
conics, ethics, fires, hysterics, mathematics, metaphysics, means,
measles, optics, physics, politics, pneumatics, &c. They are con
strued as singular; as mathematics is a science; and so of the rest.
OBSERVE.—Means, when it signifies one object, has a singular,
when more than one, a plural verb. Gallows and News have gene
rally a singular verb; as, the gallows is erected, news has come.
RULE.—Nouns in um or on have a in the plural termi
nation; andthose which have is in the singularhave es in the
plural, and these are adopted from foreign languages; as

OF GENDER.
1. Gender is the distinction of sex. There are three
genders—the masculine, the feminine, and the neuter.
2. The masculine gender denotes animals and persons
of the male kind; as, a horse, a dog, a man, a boy.
3. The feminine gender signifies animals and persons
of the female kind; as, a cow, a girl.
4. The neuter gender denotes whatever is without
breath, and inanimate objects; as, milk, a tree.
5. Some nouns are either masculine or feminine, and
are therefore said to be of the common gender; such as,
parent, friend, infant, servant, child, &c.
6. Some nouns, naturally neuter, are converted by a
figure of speech into the masculine or feminine gender;
as when we say of the sun, “He is setting;" ofthe moon,
“She is rising;” and of a ship, “She sails well."
REMARKs.—1. All those objects to which we apply the word he
are masculine; and all those words to which we apply she are femi
nine. Every other object is neuter.
2. When speaking of living creatures, when the gender is not
known, we apply the neuter pronoun it; as when we speak of a
child, when it is uncertain to us whether it is a boy or a girl, we
prefix it; thus, “It is dead.”
3. All nouns having the property of productiveness are
of the feminine gender; such as fruit trees, rivers, all
vices, virtues, &c.
ETYMOLOGY. II
There are three ways of distinguishing the sex.
1. By different words: as,
"MALE. FEMALE. MALE. FEMALE.
Bachelor Maid, spinster King Queen
Beau Belle Lad Lass

A man servant A maid servant
A he goat A she goat
A he bear A she bear
A male child A female child
Male descendants - Female descendants
It is improper to use authoress, for the female noun or pronoun,
that invariably accompanies this word, will distinguish the gender
in it, as well as in writer, author, poet, &c. Thus, in the sentence,
“The poets and authors of this age are distinguished more by
correctness of taste, than sublimity of conception,” I clearly
include, in the terms poets and authors, both males and females;
but if I say, “She is the best poetess or authoress in this country,”
I then assign her the superiority over those only of her own sex;
and when we wish to distinguish the ser, this mode becomes
necessary.

What is the feminine of tiger, tutor, poet, emperor, count, heir,
prior, prince, marquis, lion, songster, sultan, peer, actor?
OF PERsons.
Nouns have two persons, the second and third. Nouns
are of the second person when spoken to ; as, boys,attend
to your writing; and of the third when spoken of; as,
that boy is writing.
OF CASE.
1. CASE is the form or state of a noun or pronoun, to
express the relation which it bears to another word, a verb,
or preposition.
The word CASE has a variety of meanings, but its general
meaning is state of things, or state of some thing. Case is derived
from casus, a fall; because the Latin grammarians gave their
nouns six cases, representing the five last as filling or declining
from the nominative. Hence, telling the cases is called declining
a noun. They call the nominative the direct case from casus rectus,
while the others are named casus obliqui, or oblique cases.
2. Nouns have three cases; the nominative, the pos
sessive, and the objective.
3. The nominative simply expresses the name of a
thing, or is the subject of the verb; as, “The boys play,”
“The girls learn.”
4. The possessive denotes possession or property, and
has an apostrophe with the letter s coming after it; as,
“The scholar's duty;” “John's book;” “My father's
house.” -
When the singular terminates in ss, the apostrophe is generally
omitted; as, “For goodness' sake;” “Righteousness' sake.” All
monosyllables in s or ss should have an apostrophe and s added;
as “Miss's shoes;” “Bess's government;” “James's book; ”
“Thomas's shop.”
The possessive case is an abreviation of the old Saxon genitive
or possessive, which ended in is. Thus the Saxons, to express the
treachery of Judas, would have said Judasis treachery; whereas
we now say, by contraction, Judas's treachery.
5. When the plural ends in s the possessive is formed
by adding only all apostrophe; as, “On eagles' wings;”
“The drapers' company.
14 ENGLISH GRAMMAR.
OBSERVE.—The noun in the possessive means that the thing
after it belongs to it. Thus, George's book means that the book
belongs to George. The particle of is the sign of the Norman
possessive; as, “The wisdom of man.” The possessive is often
expressed by of as well as by an s. If I take aways from George,
and put of before George, the same meaning will be expressed,
for the thing before of will belong to the thing after it; as, “The
book of George.”
N.B.—The same meaning is not always conveyed by the of that
is conveyed by the apostrophe and s; for the Lord's day means
Sabbath; but the day of the Lord means the day of judgment.
EXERCISES.
Instead of saying John's book, what could we say? The book

The bonnet of Ann 2
In the following and similar sentences, possession should be
expressed by of, rather than by the s, with an article before the
first word; as, “Knowledge's hill;” “The hill of knowledge.”
Correct the following sentences in the same way:—Austria's
Emperor; London's Lord Mayor; Liverpool's trade; Socrates'
wisdom; war's horrors; gold's crown; Hamon, the Jews' enemy;
Kentish's hops.
In the following aud similar sentences, we must use s rather
than of
Correct—The wine of Adam; the porter of Whitebread; the
hat of John; the bonnet of Mary; the parasole of Jane; the
book of Robert.
6. The objective case expresses the object of an action
or of a relation, and follows either a verb or a preposition;
as, “I love Henry.” “They live in London.”
7. The nominative and objective cases are alike; but
in pronouns they are different. The cases are distinguished
from each other only by their situation; thus,
- NOMINATIVE OBJECTIVE
Henry loves John.
John loves Henry.
The nouns in both instances are alike; but the nomi
native case generally comes before the verb, and the objec
tive after the verb or preposition. -

ADJECTIVEs.
1. An adjective is a word added to a noun, to express
its quality, number, quantity, or any other circumstance
belonging to it; as, “A good boy;” “A bad man;” “A
long desk;” “A sharp knife;” “The green grass;” “Ten
men;” “JMuch talk;” “This pen.”
Adjective from adjectus, which means to add, tojoin to, to put to;
and the word adjective, in its full literal sense, means something
added to something else. It may be called an ad-noun, as being
a word added to a noun. For instance, there are several turkeys
in the yard; some black, some white, and some speckled; and
there are large ones and small ones, old ones and young ones,
and of different colours. I want you to go and catch a turkey;
but I also want you to catch a white one, and not only a white
turkey, but a young and large one. Therefore, I add or put to the
moun, the words white, young, and large, which therefore are called
adjectives. -
An adjective may sometimes be known by its making sense
with the addition of the word thing ; as, a good thing; a bad thing;
and generally answers to the question, what sort or what number;
as, this sort; ten of them.
2. English adjectives, with the exception of the defi
mitive, are not varied on account of gender, number, or
case; thus we say, a careless boy, careless girls.
3. Adjectives are divided into several kinds; namely,
common, proper, compound, verbal or participal, and
definitive. -
4. Common adjectives are those which indicate quality
or quantity of the nouns to which they are attached; as,
good, black, sour, high, low, rich, poor, &c.
5. The verbal or participal adjectives are those which
are derived from verbs; as, learned, honoured, adored,
charming, pleasing, &c.
6. Common and verbal adjectives admit degrees of
comparison.
7. There are commonly reckoned three degrees of com
parison, the positive, comparative, and superlative.
8. The positive is the primitive word, and expresses
the simple quality; as, good, wise, great.
18 ENGLISH GRAMMAR.
9. The comparative degree expresses a higher or lower
degree of the quality than the positive; as, greater, less
wise.
The comparative is employed to denote the superiority of one
of two things or aggregates, whether belonging to the same class or
to different classes; thus, a tree may be high, but another may be
higher; the former is high, but the latter is higher; and this dis
tinction is denoted by the comparative higher.
10. The superlative expresses the highest or the lowest
degree; as, greatest, least wise.
The superlative compares a thing or an aggregate with its own
class; and is employed when more than two are implied; thus,
here are three trees that are tall. The second is taller than the
first, and thereforeis higher of the two; but the third is taller than
the two others, and is therefore the highest, which is denoted
by the superlative degree.
11. The simple word, orpositive,ofonesyllable,becomes
the comparative by adding r or er; and the superlative by
adding st or est; as, wise, wiser, wisest.
12. Adjectives of more than one syllable are generally
compared by prefixing more and most; as, frugal, more
ifrugal, most frugal.
13. Diminution of quality, whether the adjective is of
one syllable or of more than one, is formed by less and
least; as, less happy, least happy; or by adding to some
adjectives ish ; as, black, blackish, salt, saltish.
14. The adverb rather also expresses a small degree or
excess of quality; as, “She is rather little.”
The words more and most, less and least, when prefixed to adjec
tives, are considered as forming part of the adjective, and conse
quently more happy, less happy, and similar words, when taken
collectively, will be adjectives in the comparitive degree. More
joined to a noun, is an adjective, but when joined to an adjective,
it is an adverb.
15. Dissyllables in y, preceded by a consonant, change
y into i before er and est; as, happy, happier, happiest;
lovely, lovelier, loveliest.
16. Dissyllables ending in ble, as, noble, nobler, no
blest; also those ending in e, as ample, ampler, amplest;
and especially words accented on thelast syllable, are often
compared by er and est; as, discreet, discreeter, dis
creetest,
ETYMoLoGY. 19
17. Some adjectives are compared irregularly; as,
POSITIVE. COMPARATIVE, SUPERLATIVE.
Good Better Best
Bad or ill Worse Worst
Little Less Least
Much or many More Most
Late Later Latest or last
Near Nearer Nearest or next
Far Farther Farthest
Fore Former Foremost or First
Old Older or elder Oldest or eldest
18. Some few adjectives are compared by adding most
to the end of the word; as, under, undermost; upper,
uppermost, &c.; and then they are considered in the
superlative degree.
19. Some nouns are often used as adjectives; as, a
wine vessel; a corn field; a gold cup; a windmill; a
silver tea-pot, &c. Adjectives are sometimes used as
nouns, and considered as such ; as, Providence rewards
the good.
20. MUCH is applied to things weighed or measured;
MANY and FEw to those that are numbered.
21. Elder and eldest are applied to persons; older and
oldest to things.
22. Some adjectives do not admit comparison. First:
Words expressive of figure; as, round, square, oval, tri
angular, &c. Second: Definitive adjectives; as, first,
second, &c.; one, two, &c. Third: Words denoting the
highest or lowest degree; as, chief, extreme, &c. Fourth :
Words implying matter, time, place, &c. Fifth : Words
denoting unity and universality; as all, sole, &c.
23. Proper adjectives are such as are derived from
proper names and nations; thus, English from England,
French, Dutch, &c.; and Newtonians from Newton.
24. Compound adjectives are those which consist of
two or more primitive words joined by a hyphen; as,
nut-brown ale; four-footed beasts: party-spirit zeal.
25. Definitive adjectives are prefixed to nouns to limit
and show their signification, without expressing any
quality.
26. This and that, with their plurals, these and those,
are called the demonstrative, because they precisely point
out the subjects to which they relate; as, “This boy does
20 ENGLISH GRAMMAR.
not read so well as that girl.” Former and latter, with
yon are of this class, serving for both singular andplural.
27. This refers to the nearest person or thing, that to
the more distant, and yon to the most distant; as, “This
man is wiser than that, but yon is the wisest.”
This refers to the latter mentioned, that to the first or former.
That is a relative pronoun, when it can be turned into who or which,
without destroying the sense. (See RELATIVE PRONoUNs.)
28. Each, every, either, neither, are called the distri
butive, because they denote the persons or things which
make up a number, as taken separately and singly; as,
“Each of his brothers is favourably situated.;” “Every
man must account for himself.”
Each and every seem to be nearly allied in their meaning; they
are not so in their application; for each refers to one of two as
well as to one of a large number; every relates to more than two
objects, and signifies each one of them as taken separately and
singly. Either signifies one or the other, but not both. Neither
imports not either.
29. None, any, all, such, whole, some, very, both, one,
other, another, several, few, many, and such, are called
the indefinite, because they do not limit their subjects to
any exact number; these can have no degree ofcomparison.
30. Any, none, and some, are used in both numbers;
both, all, and most, are used in the plural number only.
31. Other is declined in the following manner:
SINGULAR. PLURAL,
Nominative, Other Others.
Possessive. Other's Others'.
Objective. Other Others.
One and another are declined in the same manner.
32. Numeral adjectives are such as distinguish the
number or order of beings or things, and they are of two
kinds, cardinal and ordinal.
33. The cardinal are those which express a number
absolutely; They are one, two, three, four, &c.
34. The ordinal denote the order or succession in
which any number of persons or things is mentioned; as,
first, second, third, fourth, &c.

PRONOUNs.
1. A pronoun is a word used instead of a noun, to
avoid the too frequent repetition of the same noun or name;
as, “A lady went to a butcher, and told him that she
thought his meat was not so good as it had been.”
ILLUSTRATION.—In the example, “A lady went to a butcher, and
told him that she thought his meat was not so good as it had been,”
there are four pronouns; if there were no pronouns, the sentence
must have been as follows:—“A lady went to a butcher, and told
the butcher that the lady thought the butcher's meat was not so good
as the butcher's meat had been.”
PRONoUN (Latin pronomina) of pro, for, and nomina, plural of
nomen, a moun or name; that is to say, instead of nouns.
2. There are two kinds of pronouns; viz, the personal
and the relative.
3. Personal pronouns are such as stand for nouns that
denote persons.
4. There are five personal pronouns; namely, I, thou,
he, she, it; with their plurals, we, ye or you, they. .
The pronoun it, however, is generally applied to things. *
5. Personal pronouns, like the nouns which they repre
sent, admit number, person, gender, and case.
6. There are two numbers, the singular and the plural.
I, thou, he, she, it, are singular; we, ye or you, they, are
the plural nominatives.
- - “i - - -
He is often used instead of you in the nominative; as, ye are
happy.
FTY MOLOGY. 25
7. The persons of pronouns are three in each number,
namely:—
I is the first person, who speaks;
Thou is the second person, who is spoken to ;
he, she, or it, the person or thing spoken of, is the
third person;
Singular.
We is the first person
Ye or you is the second person Plural.
They is the third person
ILLUSTRATIONs.—“I caution you against him.” Here I, is the
first person who spoke; you, is the person spoken to, and is of the
second person; and him is the third person, and is spoken of
8. Pronouns have three genders; but variety of form,
to distinguish thesex is confined to the third person. He
is masculine, she is feminine, it is neuter.
9. Pronouns of the first and second person are either
masculine or feminine, according to the sex of the speaker,
or of the person spoken to.
NoTE.—As the persons speaking, or spoken to, being, at the
same time the subjects of the discourse, are supposed to be present,
and their sex is commonly known, it is unnecessary that the
pronouns of the first and second persons should undergo any
variation to mark out their gender; but persons or things spoken
of being absent, it is necessary to make a distinction of gender;
the third person of the pronoun, singular, is distinguished by
using he to denote the masculine, she to denote the feminine, and
it to denote the neuter gender.
10. Pronouns have three cases, the nominative, the
possessive, and the objective. These cases are the same
as those of nouns.
11. The nominative pronouns are five, in the singular,
namely: I, thou, he, she, it; and three plurals, we, ye
or you, they.
12. The possessiveare eight, namely: my, mine; thy,
thine; his; her, hers; its, in the singular; and six, our,
ours; your, yours; their, theirs; in the plural.
13. The objective pronouns in the singular number are
five; me, thee, him, her, it; in the plural, three, namely:
us, you, them. -
The objective case follows a verb active, or a preposition, express
ing the object of an action or of a relation. The objective pro
noun has, in general, a form different 'om that of a nominative
or possessive; but that of a moun always remains the same. (See
page 14, No. 7.)

15. Two words are generally given to the possessive
case, my, thy, her, our, your, their, and are prefixed to
nouns: mine, thine, hers, ours, yours, theirs generally
follow the noun. His and its are used either with, or
without nouns.
16. Mine and thine were formerly used as nominatives,
instead of my and thy, before a noun or adjective begin
ing with a vowel or silent h; as, “Mine eyes shall see
thy salvation.”

Out nounS.
RELATIVE PRONOUNs.
1. Relative pronouns relate, in general, to some noun,
pronoun, or phrase, going before it, which is thence called
the antecedent; as, “The master who taught us.”
ILLUSTRATIONs.—In the sentence, “The master who taught us,”
who is the relative, and master its antecedent. “He that shall
resolutely exert his faculties, and excite his virtues;” that is the
relative, and he is the antecedent.
2. The simple relatives are, who, which, and that;
they are alike in both numbers, and have three cases.
The relative is always of the same gender, number, and
person with its antecedent, but not always ofthe same
COLSe.
C 2
28 ENGLISH GRAMMAR.
3. Who is thus declined:—
SINGULAR and PLURAL.
- Nominative. Who.
Possessive. Whose.
Objective. Whom.
4. Who is applied to persons; as, “The boy who.'
Who is also applied to inferior animals, when they are
represented as speaking and acting like rational beings;
as, “A stag who came to a river, seeing his own image,
said,” &c.
5. Which is applied to animals and things without
breath; as, “The dog which barks;” “The tree which
produced no fruit.”
6. That is often used instead of who or which, to pre
vent the too frequent repetition of who or which, as,
“The boy that reads;” “The book that was lost"
7. That is a relative when it can be turned into who
or which, without destroying the sense, and may be
applied to persons, creatures, and things; as, “He that
acts wisely deserves praise;" “Modesty is a quality that
highly adorns a woman;” “This is the tree that blooms.”
8. What is a compound relative, including both the
relative and the antecedent, and is equal to that which,
those which, or the thing which ; as, “This is what I
wanted;” that is to say, “The thing which I wanted.”
What has, in all cases, this extended signification; for, when
in the way of inquiry as to words of which we have no clear under
standing, we say, what? our full meaning is, “Repeat to us, that
which you have said, or the words which you have spoken.”
What in the repetition of a question of amazement, is an inter
jection.
9. Who, which, and what, are called interrogatives,
when they are used in asking questions; as, “Who is
he * “H'hich is the pen P” “What are you doing?"
10. WHo inquires for a person's name, and whAT for
his occupation and character. WHICH selects one or
more persons or things from a number.
11. When the affix, ever, is added to who, which, and
what, their signification is unlimited; as, “Whoever they
be;” “Whichever he does;” “Whatever he does is wrong."
12, That, which, and what, are used in the nomina
tive and objective alike. Whose is frequently used in the
possessive of which; as, “A religion whoseorigin is divine."
13. That is a conjunction, when it cannot be turned
into who or which, but marks a consequence, an indica
ETYMOLOGY. 29
tion, or a final end, and joins sentences together; as,
“That he never was so happy as he is now;” “Take
care that every day be well employed.”
14. That is a definitive adjective, when it is placed
immediately before a noun, expressed or understood,
which it defines or limits; as, “That house is mine;”
“ that boy is industrious.”
REMARK.—Whether, signifying which of the two, and denoting
interrogation, is not frequently used. A relative refers to a sub
ject that is antecedent; an interrogative, to one thatis subsequent.
15. Whoever, whosoever, and whoso are relatives equal
to he who; or the person that.
16. Whatever and whatsoever, with whichever and
whichsoever are sometimes adjectives, and combined
with nouns, and sometimes compound relatives, equal
to that which. These compounds, particularly whose,
are now generally avoided. Whatever and whoever are
most used.
QUESTIONS FOR EXAMINATION.
LESSON FIRST—EXERCISES.
1. What is a relative pronoun? 2. Which are the simple
relatives? Which is the relative in the following sentences?—The
game which he shot; the boy who reads; she £ loves her

made; you who have health should improve it. Of what number,
gender, and person must the relative be? 3. How is who declined?
RULE:—When the antecedent or word going before
the relative is singular, the relative should be singular;
but if the antecedent be plural, the relative must be
plural.
How do you know when the relative is singular and when it is
plural? By its antecedent. Repeat the rule. What is its ante
cedent in the following sentences? The boy who is good should be
esteemed ? Boy. Which is the relative? What number is
boy? Singular. What number is who here? Singular why?
Because boy, its antecedent, is singular. Which is the relative in
“Those who love us, we should obey?” Who. What number is
who? Plural. Why? Because its antecedent, those persons, is
plural; and the relative is always ofthe same number and person
with its antecedent. Which person is who here? The third.
Why? Because its antecedent those is of the third person, as
being spoken of; and the relative is always of the same number
and person with its antecedent.
Which is the relative in the sentence—“He that is discreet acts
wisely?” That. Which person? The third. Why? Because

its antecedent he is the third. What number? Singular. Why?
Because its antecedent is singular; and the relative is always of
the same number and person with its antecedent.

ETYMOLOGY. 31
which is applied to animals, and things without breath. What
could you say instead of who? That; for that is applied to both
persons and things. The knife whom I lost is found. Whom

Promiscuous Exercises in Parsing, and Examinations
on the ARTICLE, No UN, ADJECTIVE, and PRONOUN.
1. Compound nouns ending in full, and all those in which the
principal word is placed last, form the plural in the same way as
the nouns in page 6th, Rule l; as, mouthfu's, fellow-servants, &c.
2. Parse as in lesson eighth, page 24, the following sentences:—
A more beautiful moon; a numerous, gentle army, ever the same;
Watts's hymn books; the chief magistrate; an enterprising officer;

clerk; that is the foor of the school; the clerk of the town. We have
thousands of these instances.
4. Adjectives are sometimes employed to express absence, or
the want of quality in the object to which they are joined; as,
'cloudless sky,” that is, “A sky without clouds.” (See page 18,

OF VERBs.
1. A verb is a word that affirms something of its nomi
native, and expresses the state of being; as, “I am;”
“I live.” It also expresses deed, action, movement, or
suffering of some person or thing; as, “I read;” “I
strike;” “I jump;” “I am taught;" It is also used to
ask a question; as, “Have you been ?” It is also used
to command, request, or exhort; as, “Be still;” “Give
me a pen;” “Study diligently.”
ExPLANATION.—We say a verb affirms something of its nomi
mative in the following phrases:—I write, John reads; something
is positively declared respecting the nominatives, I and John ;
namely, writing and reading. The NoMINATIVE case generally
comes before a verb. (For an example, see page 14th, No. 7.) The
verb may be denominated the life or soul of a sentence. No full
sentence can be expressed without a verb repeated or understood.
2. Verbs are of Four kinds, active-transitive, active
intransitive, passive, and neuter. They are also divided
into regular, irregular, and defective.
3. Active-transitive verbs express action, or a thing
done by the nominative of the sentence, to some object;
as, John strikes the table. -
The active-transitive verb always supposes a person or
thing that acts, an agent or doer; and another person or
thing, an object which is acted on. (See page 15, for
nominative and objective.
ILLUSTRATIONs.—“John strikes the table.” Here, John is the
AGENT or DoER of the action, and is called the nominative; strike
is the active-transitive verb; table is the oPIECT acted on, and the
“Strikes” passes from John, the doer, to table, the object.
ETYMOLOGY. 35
4. An active-transitive verb may be known by its
making sense of a phrase with a noun or pronoun after
it; as, men, virtue, him, you, &c. Thus, commend is
an active-tansitive verb,because we can say, I “commend,
men, virtue, him, you, &c."
This rule may be relied on at all times, because an active-tran
sitive verb always marks the action of its subject or nominative,
and makes good sense with the objective case of the thing or person
on which or whom it acts.
5. An active-intransitive verb denotes action confined
to the doer, actor, or nominative; as, “I run ;” “They
walk.”
PREFACTORY REMARKs.—The young tyro is very frequently
puzzled with this class of the verbs. He frequently takes this
verb for an active verb, as it is commonly called. In the exam
ples above, “Run” and “Walk” evidently imply action or motion:
but it does not, however, pass from the subject or nominative “I”
or “He;” consequently, the action is confined to the DoER or
AcToR. Most of my predecessors have made but three kinds of
verbs, “Active, passive, and neuter.” Sometimes there is a nice
discrimination between “Active and neuter verbs,” which the
student finds difficult to understand; but this difficulty is entirely
removed by the introduction of the active-intransitive. “A neuter
verb” expresses neither action nor suffering, but being or state of
being; as, “I am,” “I sit.” Here is a state of existence without
action. And there is an obvious distinction between active-intran
sitive, “I run," and the neuter, “I sit.” Hence the utility of the
active-intransitive verb. Sometimes an active-transitive verb, by
the addition of a preposition, becomes a compound active-transitive
verb; but it cannot be followed by the objective case, nor be con
strued as a passive verb. We cannot say, “She smiled him,” or
“He was smiled;” but we can say, “She smiled on him,” which is
a compound active-transitive verb, and the verb may thus become
passive; as, “He was smiled on by fortune.”
6. A passive verb expresses the suffering of an action,
or the enduring of what another does; as, “The table
is struck.”
7. A passive verb is an impression felt by any person
or thing, and the nominative is the object of an action done
by some doer or agent, expressed or implied; as, “John
is taught by the master.”
ILLUSTRATIONs.—1. Here, “Is struck” is a passive verb, and
obviously implies the suffering of the action of what another does;
in this sentence, the agent or doer is understood; as, “The table
is struck by John.” 2. Here, “Is taught” is a passive verb, as it
expresses what is endured by the object John, from the AGENT or
D0ER master.
36 ENGLISH GRAMMAR.
ExPLANAtoRY REMARKs.–1. The nominative to the PAssive
vERB denotes the suff'rer or receiver of the action.
2. The object suffering or not resisting, (for the word passive
means unresisting, not opposing; suffering, not acting ;) is still the
nominative case to the verb; but it feels or suffers, when used
with a passive verb, whereas it acts, when used as a verb active.
We have expressed the active-transitive verb by “I commend.”
By changing the phrase to “I am commended,” we have an example
of the verb passive.
3. An active-transitive verb is made PAssive, by the aid or
association of the auxiliary verb to be. “I carry,” “I love,” are
active-transitive; but “I am carried,” “I am loved,” are passive.
ORsERVE.—The nature of an action, as implied by an active
transitive or passive verb, is the same; but the expression is
varied, accordingly as we wish to turn the attention of the hearer
principally, to the ament, or to the patient or object. The idea
annexed to the verb stri'es remains the same, whether I say,
“John strikes the desk,” or “The desk is struck by John.” In the
former case, I call the attention of the hearer to the person or
agent, and in this instance, the verb is said to be active; by the
latter, I call the person's attention to the thing that underwent
the action; and hence, the verb becomes passive. But you will
perceive that, in the latter case, I have supplied the auxiliary
verb to be, which is “Was.”
8. A neuter verb simply expresses being, or a state of
being, situation, or action, confined to the actor; as, I
live, I am, I stand, I sit.
9. A neuter verb may be known by its not making
sense with the addition of a noun, immediately following
the verb; thus, I live you; I am books, is nonsense;
therefore, these are neuter.
ILLUSTRATION.—In the phrases, I live, I am, I stand, I sit, the
verbs live, an, stand, sit, imply being, state of being, situation, and
merely show the existence or condition of the nominative I.
10. A regular verb is one that forms its past tense
and past participle, by adding d or ed to the present; as,
present, love; past, loved; past participle, loved.
11. An irregular verb is one that does not form both
its past tense and past participle by adding d or ed to the
present; as, present, choose; past, chose ; pastparticiple,
chosen.
12. Auviliary or helping verbs, by which verbs are
generally conjugated, are defective, having only the present
and past indicative; thus,
Present : Do, have, shall, will, may, can, am, must.
Past: Did, had, should, would, might, could, was, must.
Let and must are complete, and have no variation.
DTYMOLOGY. 37
"
*
13. The verbs, do, be, have, and will, are not always
auxiliaries, but are sometimes used alone, and are then
principal verbs; as, “He does it;” “The sky is red;"
“I have a pen;” “She wills his death.”
14. These verbs are auxiliaries only when their mean
ing is dependent upon another verb, in the infinitive or
participle following; as, “I shall love;” “I have loved.”
OBSERVATIONs.—The verb LovE is in the infinitive, and the
word LovED is its participle.

OF THE NUMBER AND PERson of VERBs.
1. The properties of verbs are number, person, mood,
and tense or time.
2. Verbs have two numbers, the singular and the
plural, and have generally a noun or pronoun before them;
as, I love, we love.
3. The verb is always of the same number and person
as the noun or pronoun before it; as I love is the singular
number, and the first person; we love is plural, and of
the first person.
38 ENGLISH GRAMMAR.
REMARK.—The verb in the plural never ends in s.
4. There are three persons in each number, the same
as in nouns and pronouns; as,
SINGULAR. PLURAL.
First person, I love, We love.
Second person, Thou lovest, You love.
Third person, He, she, or it loves, They love.
OBSERVATIONs.—1. The only variation in the termination of
the verb is in the second and third personssingular; thefirst person
singular and the third person plural being always alike.
2. The termination of the verb in the second person singular
is always lt, st, or est; and that of the third person, s, th, or eth,
but more generally that of s.
3. Thus love makes thou lovest in the second person, and he
she, or it loveth, or loves in the third person.
QUESTIONS FoR ExAMINATION.
1. What are the properties of verbs? 2. How many numbers
have verbs? 3. What is the verb always? Repeat the remark.
4. How many persons are there in each number?
OBSERVE.—The verb is always of the same number and person
as the nominative, which is either a noun or a pronoun.
“I love.” What number is I? Singular. How do you know
that I is singular * Because it means only one. If I is singular,
what number must the verb love be, in the phrase “I love?”
Singular. Why? Because I, its nominative, is singular.
What number is love in “We love?” Plural. Why? Because
we, its nominative, is plural; and the verb must be in the same
number with the pronoun before it.
OBSERVATIONs.—The verb is always the same person as its
nominative. If the nominative be the first personal pronoun, the
verb is of the firstperson; when the second personal pronoun is the
nominative, the verb is in the second person; if the pronoun is in
the third person, the verb must also be of the third person.
Which person is love in the phrase “I love?” The first. Why?
Because I, its nominative, is the first.
Which person is lovest in “Thou lovest? The second. Why?
Because thou, its nominative, is the second.

OF MOOD's OR MODEs.
Mood or mode, from the Latin modus, which signifies
77.0/0/06/".
ETYMOLOGY. 39
1. MooD or MoDE is the particular form of a verb,
showing the manner in which the being, action, or passion
is represented.
ILLUSTRATION.—1. Moods or modes of verbs shew that a person
has positively performed an action, or does perform it, or will per
form it. 2. It shews that he may, or can, or ought to perform it
conditionally. 3. It is indeterminate and doubtful whether he per
forms the action or not.
2. Verbs have five moods; namely, the indicative,
potential, subjunctive, imperative, and infinitive.
3. The indicative mood simply indicates or declares
positively, and without condition an action or event; as,
I study; he sleeps; he is loved; #" asks a question;
as, does he sleep? Is he loved ?
OBSERVATIONs.—The three first examples are all positive asser
tions, showing action, state of being, or passion, without any con
ditional or qualifying circumstances.
4. The indicative mood is never used in any situation
without a noun or pronoun before it; as, I read, he writes,
the man runs.
5. The potential mood expresses possibility or liberty,
power, will, or duty to do or suffer an action; as, I may
sing; we may walk or ride; she can read; he would
run; they should learn; you should obey your parents.
6. The potential is known by the signs, may, can,
might, could, would, should, must.
ILLUSTRATIONs.—I may sing implies the possibility of my sing
ing. We may walk or ride, indicates we are at liberty to walk or
ride. She can read, denotes the person has the power of reading
if she chooses. He would run, denotes he has a will or inclination
to run. They should £ orts it to be their duty to learn,
as well as to obey their parents, which is an obligation of all chil
dren. Some Grammarians discard this mood, and include it in
the subjunctive mood; but I have used it for the sake of perspi
cuity, for under this mood, the signs, may, can, &c., prefixed to
verbs are more easily explained than under the subjunctive
mood. - -
7. The subjunctive mood implies a doubt, uncertainty,
condition, supposition, motive, or wish, and is preceded
by a conjunction expressed or understood; as, if I fall;
were he good he would be happy; or he would be happy
if he were good.
8. The word subjunctive signifies subjoined to some
thing else; and the subjunctive mood of itself makes no
complete sense, but requires the addition of some verb or
40 ENGLISH GRAMMAR.
phrase, to make a full and distinct meaning; as, “If he
come, I will go.” “If he come” requires to be joined to
“I will go,” to make full sense.
ILLUSTRATIONs.—“If I fall.” Here my falling is uncertain; i
may or may not fall. “Were he good, he wou'd be happy.” Here
are a condition and a supposition, but the conjunction is under
stood—“If he were good.” “Supposing he were good, he would
be happy.” Here supposition is evidently implied. “Though he
ealls, I do not hear him.” In this sentence, the assertion is posi
tive, therefore, the verb calls is in the indicative mood, and pre
ceded by a conjunction.
9. The verb in the subjunctive mood will always be of
the plural, even when the nominative is singular, when
uncertainty and FuruRE TIME are both expressed.
10. When doubt, condition, or uncertainty is implied,
and the nominative is plural, there can be no mistake in
the subjunctive; for the verb will always be plural with its
nominative,
11. When the past or present tense or time denotes
uncertainty, the subjunctive mood is precisely the same
as the indicative; as, “If it blows;” “If thou goest.”
12. But a FUTURE uncertainty is expressed by the
verb being in the plural; and the s is omitted in the first
and third person singular, and the storest in the second
person.
ILLUSTRATIONs.—“If it blows at this present time.” Here it is
uncertain to me whether it blows or not, therefore, the indicative
mood is used. But “If it blow to-morrow.” Here both uncer
tainty and futurity are implied; consequently, we use the verb
blow plural, or the subjunctive mood.
“If thou go to-mo row.” Here is FUTURE uncertainty, therefore,
we omit the est of the verb in the second person of the indicative,
and use the subjunctive.
You may generally know when the subjunctive mood is to be
used, by supplying the auxiliaries, shall, will, should, would, could,
might, may, can ; as, if it blow, supply should,—if it should blow;
if thou go,-ifthou shou'd go, &c.
14. The imperative mood commands, orders, exhorts,
entreats, or permits; as, do this; be ready; let us pray;
hear, O my people ! go thy way.
The word imperative comes frm the Latin imperio, to command.
This might, with propriety, be called the commanding mood, espe
cially when a superior exercises authority over an inferior.
ILLUSTRATIONs.—“Do this” expresses a command; “Be ready"
is an order; “Let us pray” an exhortation; “Hear, O my people”
an entreaty; “Go thy way” is a permission.
ETYMOLOGY. - 41
------
OBSERVATIONs.—Sometimes, the same word is used to express
a command, an entreaty, or permission, according to the quality
ofthe person using it. For instance, a master shall say to a
servant, “Go home;” this is an order and a command. The ser
vant asks his master, “May I go home?” “Yes.” Here, “Go”
is an entreaty on the servant's part, and a permission on the
master's.
15. The infinitive mood expresses the action,passion,
or state of being of the verb, in a general and unlimited
manner, without any distinction of number or person,
and generally has to before it; as, To love, to read, to
study.
16. The infinitive mood is the radical form of the
verb, from which all the other parts are derived; as, carry,
love, obey.
Rewark—1. word to before the infinitive is considered as
part of the verb, and when omitted it is implied or understood;
in every other situation it is a preposition.
ILLUSTRATION.—The infinitive mood I say has no regard to
person, number, or time. To denotes that point of time or place
to which action tends, and in which it terminates. When the
infinitive verb is used, the signification to which it islimited, must
be determined by the words used with it, whether before or after
it; thus, “I desire to learn;” “I desire” shows now at this time
“to learn.” When the infinitive verb is the immediate subject of
action, the to is omitted; as, I do to go should be, I do go. (See
Rule 40 of Syntax.)

OF PARTICIPLEs. -
1. PARTICIPLE is derived from the Latin participio,
to partake, compounded of pars, (partis,) a part, and
capio, to take; because, though it partakes of the verb,
42 ENGLISH GRAMMAR.
as action, passion, being, and time, it partakes also of the
quality of an adjective in being added to a noun; as, “I
am moving ;” “...Moving is troublesome.”
ILLUSTRATIONs.-1. Here, in the first instance, moving is part
of a verb; in the second, it partakes of the character of the noun;
and when we speak of a moving or an affecting scene, the words
moving and affecting are distinctly adjectives.
2. The participle is derived from the verb, and, like it,
signifies being, doing, or suffering, but without affirming
anything; as, “Loving to give;” “Devoted to study.”
3. There are three participles; the present or active;
as, loving ; the perfect or past; as, loved; and the com
pound perfect; as, having loved.
4. The present participle always ends in ing, and
denotes an action in progress but not finished; as, I am
reading; he is writing; she was walkin/
5. The perfect or past participle denotes an action
finished, and is formed by adding d or ed to the present
of a regular verb; as, blame, blamed; but in irregular
verbs the past participle is differently formed.
6. Thecompound perfect participleis formed by adding
the passive participle to the word having; as, “Having
loved.”
7. Participles become adjectives when prefixed to nouns
expressing their quality or property, and will have the
degree of comparison; as, “A loving, a more loving, a
most loving man.”
8. The participle is distinguished from the adjective
by the participle expressing time; as, loving, present;
loved, past; but the adjective denotes only quality; as,
high, sweet, sour.
ILLUSTRATIONs.—Loving to go; loved to sing; moving in haste.
The words loving, loved, moving, are participles, because they
convey the idea of time and action. But a loving man; a moving
spectacle; a learning boy; the words loving, moving, and learning,
simply express quality, without regard to time, and, therefore, are
adjectives.
9. Participles sometimes perform the office of nouns,
and are used as such, as making sense either by them
selves, or joined with adjectives; as, learning; a good
understanding ; a little learning ; building ; a great
building.
10. The present participles are represented as active;
all verbal nouns signify action, and the past are repre
ETYMOLOGY. 43
sented as passive; but they are not always so situated; the
present are sometimes passive, and thepastare frequently
active; as, “He was walking on the road;” “He has
relieved me.”

OF TENSEs oR DISTINCTIONs oF TIME.
1. TENSE of a verb expresses the time of the being,
action, or passion which it signifies.
OBSERVE.—Tense is used for time, and is formed either by the
variation which the single verb undergoes, or by the combination
of two or more words.
2. Properly speaking, there are only three tenses, the
present, past, and future; yet they are subdivided into
three more, the perfect, the past perfect, and the future
perfect.
3. The PRESENT TENSE represents an action or event,
which is going on just now; as, I rule, I am ruled. Its
signs are am, do, or does.
4. The PAST TENSE represents an action or event, as
pastand finished; as, “He shot the dog and was flogged.”
Its signs are was or did.
5. The PERFECT TENSE represents an action or event
as finished, and yet refers to the present time; as, “John
has just now come;” “I have heard him preach.” Its
signs are have, has, and hath.
6. The PAST PERFECT TENSE represents a thing as
past, at or before, some other past action or event hap
pened specified in the sentence; as, “I had finished my
letter before he came.” Its sign is had been.
7. The FUTURE TENSE represents an action or event
yet to come, either with or without reference to the pre
cise time when ; as, “I will see you again, and your
hearts shall rejoice.” Its signs are shall or will.
8. The FUTURE PERFECT denotes that a future action
or event will be completed at or before the time of another
44 ENGLISH GRAMMAR.
future action or event; as, “I shall have dined before
three o'clock to-morrow;” “We shall have been studying
two hours when it is five o'clock.” Signs, shall have or
will have.

REMARKs on the TENSEs and OBSERVATIONs on the
AUxILIARY VERBs. (See page 36, No. 12.)
THE PRESENT TENSE.
1. Present tense is used in three forms, simple, progressive, and
emphatic.
2. In its simple form, it expresses general truths; as, “Man is
born to trouble.” It expresses habits or customs; as, “He snuffs;”
“He goes to school.” It is sometimes applied to persons long
since dead, when refering to their writings or works; as, “Newton
is admired in his works.”
3. In historical narrations, it is sometimes used for the past;
as, Titus enters Jerusalem, fights, and conquers.” It is often
used for the perfect; as, “Josephus tells us of the destruction of
Jerusalem,” for has told us.
4. When preceded by such words as when, before, as soon as,
after, it expresses the relative time of afuture action; as, “When
he arrives, he will or shall be welcome.”
5. The progressive form denotes an action begun and going on
just now; as, I am studying my lesson.
5. The emphatic form is used to remove some doubt on the
part of the person addressed; as, “I Do write.”
Do is the emphatic form of this tense.
ON THE PAST TENSE.
1. The past tense has three forms; the simple, the progressive,
and the emphatic.
This tense is used when the event or action is completelyfinished,
and secludes all idea of the present time. It supposes that a por
tion of time has elapsed between the time of the action and the
time of speaking; as, “He was down last week.”
2. The progressive form expresses that an action was unfinished
at a certain time past; as, “I was writing when he came.”
The sign of the progressive form, was doing.
The emphatic form is did; as, “I did go.”
After death, all agents are spoken of in this tense; as, “Solomon
was wise.” In marrative style, we use the past tense; as, “He
was much admired;” “He did much good;” and not he has been,
&c.; he has done much good.
ETYMOLOGY. 45
ON THE PERFECT TENSE.
1. The perfect tense denotes a thing that is past just now ; as,
“The coach has arrived;” that is, just now.
2. It denotes an action done in a limited space of time, (as a
day, a week, a month,) a part of which time has yet to elapse; as,
“We have seen strange things to-day.”
3. An action completed some time ago, but the consequences
of which extends to the present time; as, “I have neglected my
duty, and am therefore unhappy.”
4. Duration or existence requires the perfect, when mentioning a
deceased person or his works; as, “He has been dead three days
already.” Here is duration, because he is yet in a state of com
position. We say, “Cicero has written orations,” because the ora
tions are still in existence; but we cannot say, “Cicero has written
poems,” because the poems do not exist; they are lost; therefore,
we must say, “Cicero wrote poems.”
5. When preceded by such words as when, before, as soon as, after,
it expresses the relation and completion of a future action; as,
“When he has finished his work he shall be rewarded.” Here,
useinstead of “When,” assoon as, or after, which will be tantamount
to the same word.
6. The progressive form of this tense implies that the action is
complete either at the present, or was at a very short time before;
as, “I have been walking these six hours.”
FUTURE TENSE.
The following modes of expression denote future time; as, “I
am going to write next week;” “I have got a sum of money to pay
to-morrow,” that is, “I am under a present necessity or obligation
to do a future act.”
FUTURE PERFECT TENSE.
l. In this tense, shall and will ought to be used in all the three
persons; as, “I shall or will have written this grammar before
midsummer;” that is, “I am determined to have it finished before
midsummer.” Here future tense is not so much implied as my
determination or resolution.
2. “Thou shalt finish thy drawing before Christmas;” “He
shall complete his geometry before his father arrives.” In these
instances, I do not merely foretell what will be done,but positively
what shall be done.
AUxILIARIES.
The auxiliary verbs are those which exist in the conjugation of
principal verbs. They were originally principal verbs, having
after them either the past participle or the infini’ive mood, with
the to omitted. (See rule of Syntax 40.) The list of auxiliaries
is given in page 36. Do is not only an auxiliary, but also a
principal verb. Do and did are the only parts of this verb which
are used as auxiliaries to other verbs. Do and did express the
46 ENGLISH GRAMMAR.
action more emphatically, as though a doubt existed on the sub
ject, either as regarding the time or the fact; as, “I do write,”
in the present tense; and “I did write,” in the past tense. (See
page 36, for the auxiliaries.)
Do and did are sometimes used in the negative sense; as, “I
do not write;” “I did not write.” They are used in the interro
gative sentence; as, “Do you study?” presenttense; and “Did
you study?” past tense. They sometimes supply the place of
another verb, and make the repetition of it unnecessary; as,
“You mind not your lesson as they do, or even as John does.”
PoTENTIAL MooD.
Several of the auxiliary verbs in the potential mood refer to
present, past, and future time.
The PRESENT tense is expressed; as, “I wish he would or could
come just now.”
PAST time is expressed with the similar auxiliaries; as, “I
could go if I chose.” -
FUTURE tense is expressed thus; “If he should or would come
to-morrow, I might, could, would, or should speak to him.”
Must denotes necessity, and has no variation or relation to time;
as, “I must do it.” Here mustdenotesnecessity and do the present
fime. “I must do it next week.” Here future time is denoted
by next week. “I must have done it.” Here,must merely expresses
necessity, as before; and have done it shows the past. This shows
what we ought to do.
Can expresses power unconditionally; as, “I can write.”
May and might express a right, liberty, possibility, capacity, and
power, connected with some contingent event; as, “I have the
power and may go, ifI think proper;” “I might see him if I chose.”
Would denotes the inclination of the will; as, “I would ride if
I had a horse.” This is contrary to may and might; for while in
the former instance, there is power, &c., in the latter the power
is not under the controul of the agent.
Should signifies obligation or duty of the agent; as, “He should
study if he intends to learn.”
Could (the past tense of can) implies conditional power; as,
“Can you lend me your horse?” “I can” expresses the condi
tion; “Ifhe was at home I could,” or “I couldif he was at home.”
Ought is a defective verb, having only its present and past indi
cative; yet it is an independent verb, and always governs another
verb in the infinitive.
Ought denotes obligation without any relation to time; as,
“These ought ye to do.” Here ought denotes the obligation, and
do the present time. Again, “These ought ye to have done.”
Here, ought denotes duty or obligation, and the past time is denoted
by to have done. Certainly time is not denoted by ought, as it is
generally understood to be by most grammarians.
Be, have, and will are often principal verbs, when unconnected
with a principal verb; as, “You have it.” Yet they have their
auxiliaries; as, “You have got it.” (See page 37, No. 14.)
Am and was are used with the participle in ing, to express a
continuation or progression of action; as, “I am writing;” “I
was reading.” (See page 42, No. 4.)
ETYMOLOGY. 47
The auxiliaries do, did, am, was, have, had, shall, will, and can,
designate absolute or unconditional affirmation; may, might, could,
would, should, conditional affirmation.
Let is an active verb and complete. It has no variations. It is
not an auxiliary, but a principal verb. Let not only expresses
permission, but entreating, exhorting, and commanding. (See impe
rative mood.)
OBSERVATIONS.
To have, through its moods and tenses is only placed before
the past participle; as, “I have worked;” “I had written.”
To be is placed both before the present andpast participle, through
all the moods and tenses; as, “I am loving, I am loved;” “I
was loving, I was loved.”
To be is sometimes used to conjugate active-transitive verbs, by
adding the present participle to the verb to be, through all its
changes of moods and tenses; thus, instead of “I teach,” we say,
“I am teaching.”
When an auxiliary is joined to a verb, the auxiliary goes through
all the changes of persons and number; and the verbs continue
always the same.
When two or more auxiliaries precede a verb, the first of them
is changed, and the rest continue the same without change.
The participle is often used with neuter verbs; as, “I am
musing;” “He is sleeping.”
The neuter verbs, in many instances, admit the passive form,
retaining still the neuter signification; as, “I am arrived;” “I
was gone;” “I was grown.”
Should is often used instead of ought, to express duty or obliga
tion; as, “We should do good to all men.”
Shall (its past tense should) sometimes signifies duty; as, “Thou
shalt not steal,” means, “It is thy duty not to steal.”
Shall, in the first person future, only foretells; as, “I or we
shall go to-morrow.” In the second and third person, it promises,
commands, or threatens; as, “They or you shall go;” “Thou shalt
not steal;” “The soul that sinneth shall die.”
Shall commands, &c., in the affirmative sentences only; when
used as interrogatively, in all the persons, refers to another's will;
as, “Shall I send you a copy of this grammar?” “Shall you
go?” “Shall he go?” “Will James return to-morrow?” i.e.,
“Do you expect him?”
When the second and third persons are represented as the sub
jects of their own expressions or their own thoughts, shall foretells,
as in the first person; as, “He says he shall be a sufferer from
this bargain.” Do you suppose that you shall go 2"
In the subjunctive mood, shall is used in the second and third
persons, to signify conditional future time; as, “If you shall
consent;” “If he shall proceed.”
Will (its past tense wonld) is used as a mark of futurity, and
signifies intention; as, “I will come.” Here it marks a determi
nate intention. Will intimates a promise in the first person; as,
“I will come;” that is, “I promise I will come.” In the second
: third persons, it only foretells; as. “You will or they will
ie.”
48 ENGLISH GRAMMAR.
* When will signifies intention in the second and third persons, it
is pronounced emphatically, and is considered as a principal verb,
the same as do and did; as, “Ye will not come unto me.” See
Deuteronomy 25c., 7 and 9 v. Would (the past of will) is used in
this way. See Luke 16 c., 26 v.
Should and would are subject to the same rules as shall and
will; they are generally attended with a supposition; as, “Were
I to run I sh uld soon be fatigued.”
Shall never expresses the will or resolution of its nominative or
subject; the followingexpress no resolution:—thus, “I shall fall;"
“Thou shalt go if thou wilt.”
PROMISCUoUs RULEs.
1. Verbs ending in ss, ch, a, or o, form the third per
son singular of the present indicative, by adding es; as,
“He dress-es, march-es, brush-es, fix-es, go-es,” the same
as the nouns. (See page 7, rule 2.)
2. Verbs in y, with a consonant before it, is changed
into i before the terminations est, es, eth, and ed, but not
before ing; y, with a vowel immediately before it, is not
changed into i, as,
PRESENT: Try, triest, tries, or trieth. PAST: Tried, shied, gloried.
PRESENT: Pray, prayest, prays, or prayeth. PAST: prayed, stayed.
PARTICIPLE: Trying, praying, playing, shying.
3. Verbs accented on the last syllable, and those of
one syllable, ending in a single consonant preceded by a
single vowel, double the final consonant before the termi
nations est, eth, ed, ing; but never befores ; thus,
Allot, allottest, allots, allotteth, allotted, allotting.
Blot, blottest, blots, blotteth, blotted, blotting.
4. Adjectives in the positive degree ending in d, g, or
t, preceded by a single vowel, form their comparative and
superlative by doubling those lettels; thus, red, redder,
reddest; big, bigger, biggest; hot, hotter, hottest. But
if the d, g, or t, is preceded by another consonant, or by
more than one vowel, the final consonant is not doubled
in forming the two last degrees; as, kind, kinder, kindest;
neat, neater, neatest; strong, stronger, strongest.
5. When the positive ends in y, preceded by a conso
nant, the y is changed into ie, in the other degrees; as,
pretty,prettier, prettiest. (See nouns, page 7, rule4.)"
6. The nominative and vocative cases in Latin, corres
pond with the English NoMINATIVE; the genitive is
equal to the PossEssIVE ; and the dative, accusative,
and oblative, are all comprehended in the objRCTIVE.

together, and JUNCTIO, joining, making joining together;
and denotes the regular combination and arrangement
of a verb, in all its variations of mood, tense, number, and
person.
2. The conjugation of an ACTIVE VERB is stiled the
active voice, and that of a PAssIVE VERB the passive

OF VERBs.—To BE.
The verb to be is also a principal verb, as well as an
auxiliary. As a principal, it signifies to exist. Thus,
to be well or ill, signifies to exist in a state of health or
illness. This verb, in its compound tenses, requires, like
other verbs, the help of the verb to have; as, “I have
been ill;” I should have been safe.” As an auxiliary,
the verb to be, in its moods and tenses, is used with both
present and past participles of other verbs; as, “He is
walking;” “It is finished.”

The tenses of this mood are the same as those of the indicative
mood, except the suppositional tense and the first portion of the
future in the subjunctive. This mood is frequently violated both
in conversation and written composition. When the verb has no
reference to future time, it has of course either to past or present,
and then if it express doubt or condition the verb varies the same
as in the indicative.
Mark the difference between the past tense “If I was,” and the
suppositional tense, “If I were.” The past tense expresses a doubt,
motive, or condition respecting a fact, which, if ever it did occur,
must have occured in some past time; thus “If he was at the
meeting, he delivered the lecture.” Here I am in doubt respect
ing some past action.
The suppositional tense expresses no more doubt than the other
tenses; but, it is used to discriminate between a past uncertainty
and a future uncertainty; thus, “If he do promise, he will cer
tainly perform.”
60 ENGLISH GRAMMAR.
To know what "tense you should use ask the questions—Has
the time of the event taken place 2 or, is it now taking place?
In the sentence, “If he was at the meeting,” &c. Has the time
of the meeting taken place? Yes; but I am uncertain whether
he was there or not. Then you use the past tense indicative mood.
Again, “If he do promise,” &c. Has he promised? No. Does
he promise? No. Then if ever he promise it must be at a future
time, and the suppositional tense is used, in which tense the verb
is of the plural form. (See page 59 and Rule 46 of Syntax.)
OBSERVE.—Though, unless, except, whether, &c., may be used
as well as if.

PROMISCUOUS QUESTIONS AND EXERCISES.
What is a verb 2 What is a neuter verb 2 How may it be
known 2 What are regular verbs 2 What is a passive verb 2
What is an active-transitive verb ' What an active-intransitive 2
What part of the verb has no nominative? How many parts of
the verb have “Have” in them? What mood has a conjunction
understood? Repeat the imperative mood. Which person of the
verb ends in s? Which person commonly ends in t? What is
the past participle? The present? The perfect? Is there
any resemblance between the present potential and the perfect
potential mood? What has the perfect more than the pre
sent? What other tenses have some resemblance 2 In what do
they differ? What part of the verb has no nominative? Infini
tive. How many parts of the verb have “Had” in them? Con
jugate love with do in the emphatic form. Also conjugate music,
work, read, write, sing, play, run, learn, in the same way. What is
used instead of a noun? How many voices have verbs? Name
them. How many tenses are there? What are they? What do
they signify?
OBSERVE.—To have, as a principal verb, signifies to possess.
Thus, “I have a book;” “I have a horse;” which means I possess
a book and a horse. In this case the verb “To have” has as
many moods and tenses as the verb “To love.” As an auxiliary,
the verb have is used for forming the compound tenses of the other
verbs. These tenses are formed by prefixing the auxiliary have,
through all its moods and tenses, to the past participle; as, I
have worked; we had worked; they might, could, may, or should
have worked; he shall or will have worked. (See the verb “To be,”
page 56.)
OBSERVATIONS.
l. The nominative to an ACTIVE-TRANSITIVE VERB denotes the
doer of the action.
2. The nominative to an ACTIVE-INTRANSITIVE and to a NEUTER
denotes merely the subject of the verb.
3. The nominative to a PAssIVE VERB denotes the sufferer or
receiver of the action.
LESSON FIRST.
Of..Active-transitive, Active-intransitive& Neuter Verbs.
What are active-transitive, active-intransitive, and neuter verbs 2
Are the following verbs active or neuter?—Shine, sob, jump, work,
66 ENGLISH GRAMMAR.
skip, sin, dance, frown? Are the verbs sit, lie, set, lay, rise, active or
neuter? Which is the verb in the following sentences:—James
beats the dog? Beats. Why? Because it is something done.
What kind of a verb 2 Active-transitive. Why? Because the
action is passed from the actor or doer to the object. Who is the
actor? John. What is the object? Dog. How may you know
when the verb is active-transitive, active-intransitive, or neuter?
(Look backto yourverbs, pages.34,35, and36.) Tell theverb in “James
walks in the garden.” Walks. Why? Because it is doing some
thing? What kind? active-intransitive. Why? Because it is
an action confined to the actor. Who is the actor? James.
What is the nominative to an active-intransitive verb? The subject
of the verb. “I sleep?" Sleep. What kind? Neuter. Why?
Because it expresses merely a state of being.
Select the verbs out of the lessons h, i, j, k, l, and m, and exer
cise them as in the above examples.
LESSON SECOND.
What is a passive verb? Conjugate as the verb to be loved:—
Detain, inform, instruct, offend, examine. 1. Is the verb to love
regular or irregular? Why? Is it active, passive, or neuter?
Why? Answer: To love is a regular verb, because it forms its
past tense and past participle in ed; as, present, love; past, loved;
past participle, loved. It is active-transitive, because it makes sense
with a noun after it; as, “I love books.” 2. Is the verb to be
loved regular or irregular? Why? Is it active-transitive, active
intransitive, neuter, or passive? Why? “To be loved” is regular,
because it forms its past tense and past participle in ed; as,
present, love; past, loved; past participle, loved. It is passive,
because it is formed by adding the past participle to the verb to
be; as, “To be loved.” 3. Is the verb to grow regular or irre
gular? Why? Is it active-intransitive, active-transitive, passive,
or neuter? Why? “To grow” is an irregular verb, because it
does not form its past tense and past participle in ed; as, present,
grow; past, grew; past participle, grown. It is neuter, because it
will not make sense with a noun after it; as, “To grow.”
Ask the same questions ofthe following verbs —To learn, to praise,
to destroy, to propose, to admire, to confess, to give, to hear, to
dig, to be loved, to be informed, to be saved, to be destroyed, to
be beat, to be bent, to be, to be caught, to go, to come, to fly, to
cling, to fall, to be followed.
(For parsing verbs, see page 54.)

Name the verbs in this lesson that have their past tense and
past participle alike. Some of the irregular verbs have two past
participles. Conjugate them after the following examples:—
PAST TENSE.
SINGULAR. PLURAL.
1. I bereft or I bereaved. 1. We bereft or we bereaved.
2. Thou bereftest or thou be-2. You bereft or you bereaved.
reavedst. -
3. He bereft or he bereaved. 3. They bereft or they bereaved.
PERFECT TENSE.
SINGULAR. PLURAL.
1. I have bereft or I have be- 1. We have bereft or we have
reaved. bereaved.
2. Thou hastbereft, or thou hast 2. You have bereft or you have
bereaved. bereaved.
3. He has bereft or he has be- 3. They have bereft or they have
reaved. bereaved. -
The past, perfect, past perfect, and future perfect, indicative,
with the perfect and past perfect potential, perfect infinitive, and
past participle, are exercised with bereft or bereaved in the same
way that the past and perfect, as is before exhibited.
ETYMOLOGY. 73
The whole of the passive verb will have bereft or bereaved, and
so on with other verbs that have two past participles; for it is the
past participle that is put after the verbs have and be, and not the
past tense. Although there are two ways of the past tense in such
verbs as bid, which has bid, bade, in the past tense, yet it will have
only one way, namely, bid, in all the tenses above mentioned,
that have the auxiliaries have or had, and through all the passive
voice, that is, after any part of the verb to be.
EXERCISES ON SOME VERBS.
ExAMPLEs.—1. “To love” is a regular verb, because it forms
its past tense and past participle in ed; as, present, love; past,
loved; past participte, loved. 2. “To grow” is an irregular verb,
because it does not form its past tense and past participle in ed;
as, present, grow; past, grew; past participle grown. Exercise
the following in the same way:—To learn, to praise, to destroy,
to propose, to admire, to be bent, to be caught, to be destroyed,
to fly, to go, to be, to hear, to dig, to be saved, to confess.
OF ADVERBs.
ADVERB is derived from ad to, and verbum a word or
verb. -
1. An adverb is a word added to a verb, an adjective,
or another adverb, to express some additional circum
stance, or modification of time, place, or manner,
respecting it; as, He reads well;” “A truly excellent
scholar;” “He conducts himself very honestly.”
ILLUSTRATIONs.—1. “When you sow small seeds, make the earth
very fine, and if it has of late been dry weather, take care to press
the earth extremely hard upon the seeds.” Here are four adverbs—
“When” relates to time. “Very” is added to fine, to denote a high
degree of fineness. “Of late” denotes time. “Extremely” is
'.to express the manner or quality of theearth, viz. “extremely
stra.
2. An adverb may be generally known by its answering
to the questions, how when * or where ? thus, “An
exceedingly pious woman.” How pious? Answer.
Exceedingly; this word is an adverb. He wrote lately.
When did he write * . Lately; here lately is an adverb.
It went upwards. Where did it go Upwards.
3. ADVERBs are of various kinds; the chief are those
of time, manner, place, quantity, doubt, number, &c.
4. ADVERBs of TIME are easily known by their mean
ing; as, now, to-day, before, not yet, always, long-ago,
immediately, often, seldom, ever, daily, hitherto, &c.
5. ADVERBs of MANNER or QUALITY are the most
numerous, and are generally formed by adding ly to an
E
74 ENGLISH GRAMMAR.
adjective; as, wise, wisely; bad, badly; just, justly;
&c., or by changing le into ly; as, able, ably. So, also,
too, thus, likewise, and many others.
6. Most adverbs ending in ly may be compared by
prefixing to them more and most; as, lovely, more
lovely, most lovely.
7. Words derived from adjectives ending in y, to form
the adverb, the y is changed into i, as, heavy, heavily.
8. ADVERBs of comPARISON are, alike, better, best,
least, less, very, more, most, often, much, soon, &c.
9. ADVERBs of AFFIRMATION and of DouBT are,
truly, surely, nay, not, no, yes, yea, indeed, really, &c.
Perhaps, peradventure, perchance, and possibly, are
those of doubt.
10. ADVERBs of PLACE are, above, below; down
wards, upwards; backwards, forwards; hence, whence,
thence; here, there, where; hither, thither, wither ;
herein, &c.
11. ADVERBs of NUMBER are, often, once, twice, &c.
Those of oRDER are, firstly, secondly, thirdly, &c.; and
adverbs of NEGATION are, nay, no, not, not at all, &c.
12. ADVERBs of SEPARATION are, apart, asunder,
separately; of PREFERENCE are chiefly, especially,
rather; ofABATEMENT are, scarcely, hardly; of INTER
RogATION are, how, why, &c.
13. ADVERBs of conjunctION are, together, generally,
and universally.
14. Most adverbs are contractions, which are used to
express a sentiment in few words; as, he acted wisely;
that is, with wisdom; where denotes in which place.
15. Some words are used as adverbs; as, to-day, yes
terday, and tomorrow. Some are used as adverbs and
adjectives, as, little, better, much.
Much is used, 1. as an adverb; as, it is much better to give.
- – 2, as an adjective; as, in much wisdom is much grief.
- — 3, as anoun; as,where much is given much isrequired.
16. ADVERBs which are composed of nouns, instead of
at, on, &c, we use a ; as, aside, afoot, ashore, &c. .
17. INDEFINITE ADVERBs are, again, always, daily,
hourly, ever, never, seldom, oft, often, oft-times, &c.
18. ADVERBs of comEINATION are those which are
joined to prepositions; as, thereof, whereof; herewith,
therewith, &c.
ETYMOLOGY. - 75
19. CoMPOUND ADVERBs are those which consist of
two or more simple words; as, by-and-by, which should
always be joined by hyphens; as, now-a-days.
OBSERVE.—Some words are of different parts of speech, accord
ing to their positions in sentences, and to their signification.
Care to the definitions of the parts of speech will be your only
and unerring guide.

ETYMOLOGY. 77
OF PREPOSITIONS.
Preposition is derived from the Latin pre, before, and
prono to put; and positio, hence their position is before
nouns or pronouns.
1. A preposition is a word put before nouns and pro
nouns to show the relation between them; as, “He went
from London to York with the Judge in the coach.”
ILLUSTRATION.—In the above example “from" points out the
place of commencement, and “to” that of termination; “with ”
points the relation between him and the judge; “in” shows the
vehicle which conveyed them, and bears a relation to the coach.
2. A preposition may be known by its admitting after
it a personal pronoun in the objective case; thus we can
say, to him, of us, with me. To, of, and with are
prepositions.
3. A List of Prepositions to be got by heart.
About Before From. Through,
Above Behind In Throughout
According to Below Into Till
Across Beneath Instead of. To
After Beside Near Touching
Against Between Nigh. Towards.
Along Betwixt Of Under
Amid Beyond Off Underneath
Amidst By. On Unto
Among Concerning. Over Up .
Amongst Down Out of. Upon.
Around During. Regarding With
At Except Respecting Within
Athwart Excepting. Round. Without. *
Bating For Since.
4. Prepositions serve to connect words together to make com
plete sense of a phrase or sentence. Thus we say, “he writes a
pen,” they run the river,” “The man is the house.” Such sen
tences are unconnected, and devoid of meaning, the sense must
be made up of some connecting word; thus, “he writes with a
pen;” “they run up the river;” “the man is in or within the
house.” All these connecting words so necessary to complete the
sense, are prepositions.
5. Towards is a preposition, but toward is an adjective. The
words after, above, before, beneath, and several others, have some
times the signification of adverbs; as, “They had their reward
* Some grammarians give an explanation to the above words; but this is
omitted, as it can be of no utility to the student. Also, other grammarians give
alist of Latin and Greek prefixes used in the composition of English words:
for example, they would say, A, ab, abs signifying from or away; as, abstract,
to draw away. Of what use can these preffices be to the English reader? None
whatever. Let the student look at his dictionary, and he will see at once that
abs-tract imports “to take away one thing from another.”
78 ENGLISH GRAMMAR.
soon after.” “He dwells above.” “He died not long before.”
But if the nouns time and place be added, they will lose their
adverbial position; as, “He died not long before that time,” &c.
OBSERVE.—Before is a preposition when it refers to place, and an
adverb when it refers to time. Where a preposition does not govern
the objective case, it becomes an adverb; as, “He rides about.”

Parse the following, asking the same questions as in the other
parsing lessons, and when you meet with a preposition, ask—Why
a preposition; thus, “I threw above it.”
Which is the preposition? ANs. Above.
(Because it is put before the pro
noun * it” to show that “above”
has a relation to “ it.”
Why a preposition?
Proceed in this way through the whole of prepositions.
Parse the following parts ofspeech.—l. You are seated above us.
They sre placed beside her. Charles is beyond him. It is behind
you. I am about them. They are beneath him. We went
among them. He came within the time. Of whom do you speak?
Measure around it. I perform it with pleasure.
2. He passed throughout the camp. I sailed down the stream.
They passed through it without danger. The fields were under
the water. He is going up the hill. Step into the carriage. He
looked over the estate. You spoke concerning the war. Below
me trees unnumbered rise.
OF CoNJUNCTIONs.
CoNJUNCTION is derived from Con, together, and
junctio, join, hence the word conjunction to conjoin
or join together.
1. A conjunctIoM is a word which connects sentences
and words together; as, “He and I must go; but James
may stay.” “Two and two make four.”
Conjunctions also begin sentences after a period, showing some
relation between sentences in the general tenor of discourse.
ILLUSTRATIONs.—“He and I;” here, by means of the conjunc
tion and, we unite two sentences in one, and avoid a repetition;
thus instead of saying, “He must go,” “I must go,” we join
together the “He” and “I,” because the same thing is affirmed
of both, namely, must go. In the sentence “two and two make
four,” the and signifies addition, and merely joins the words two,
as these two numbers when added together amount to four.
ETYMOLOGY. 79
2 Conjunctions are generally divided into two kinds:
the couplative and disjunctive.
3. The copulative conjunction serves to connect words,
or to continue a sentence, by expressing an addition, a
supposition, or a condition, a cause, a design, or an end,
an inference, or an exception; as, “Green and blue;”
“I will go if he come.” “You prosper because you
are industrious;” “He bought a horse that he may ride;”
“You are young and therefore inexperienced.”
ExPLANATORY REMARKs.—l.—The copulative conjunction is
used to express an addition and a continuation of the sentence;
as, you and I are both young. Here the “and” denotes that “you”
is joined to “I,” and expresses union or addition; “young” being
applicable to both. 2. They are used to express a supposition or
condition; as, “I will go if he come.” Here, “I will go,” depends
on some condition, namely, “his coming;” and the word if indi
cates this supposition, or on this condition, 3. To express a
“cause;” as, “You are prosperous because you are industrious;”
here, his industry was the cause of his prosperity; and this par
ticular relation is denoted by the conjunction, because. 4. To
express “a design or an end;” as, “He went to school that he
might learn.” Here, his going to school was for this design orend
that he might learn, and this is denoted by “that.” 5. To express
“an inference or an exception;” as, “He was idle, therefore he re
mained in poverty.” Here, poverty is said to be the consequence
of his idleness, and this consequence or inference is denoted by
the word “therefore.”
4. The disjunctive conjunction serves, not only to
connect words, or continue the sentence, but also implies
that the latter part of the sentence is, in some degree,
opposed to the former; as, “You ride, but I walk.”
ILLUSTRATION.—“You ride, but I walk.” In this sentence one
part is disjoined by the conjunction “but” from the other. Here
the word but shows that the latter part of the sentence “I walk"
is in opposition to “you ride.” "
5. A list of Conjunctions.
Copulative.—Also, and, as well as, because, both, else, for, if,
since, that, then, therefore, wherefore.
For is used as a conjunction when it can be turned into be
cause; as, “I went at once, for (because) it was useless to stay.”
For is a preposition when it cannot be turned into because; as,
“She sighed for (a prep.) love, he for (prep.) glory.” Since is
used for a preposition, a conjunction, aud an adverb; as, “I have
not seen him since (prep.) that time.” “Since (conjunction) it
must be so, let us not murmur.” “I finished my work long
since (adverb).”
80 ENGLISH GRAMMAR.
Then is used both as a conjunction and as an adverb; as,
“Upon these facts then (conj.) I rest.” “He went then (adverb)
that is, at that time.”
Disjunctive.—Although, as, but, either, except, lest, neither,
mor, notwithstanding, or, provided, seeing, so, than, though, un
less, until, whether, yet, whereas.
But is some times used as an adverb; as, “We are but (only)
of yesterday.”
6. Some conjunctions are used as ADVERBs; as, as,
so, still, again, indeed, therefore, wherefore.
7. The English conjunctions are chiefly derived from
the Anglo-Saxon language.

OF INTERJECTIONS.
Interjection is derived from two Latin words; inter,
which signifies between, and jectio, a throwing. Hence
an interjection is a word which is thrown in between the
members of a sentence.
1. An interjection is a word which expresses a sudden
passion or emotion of the mind as, “..Alas! I fear for
life!” “O, virtue! how amiable art thou!”
2. Any word, or even a phrase, may become an inter
jection, when used in an unconnected manner; as, “Lo !
Behold ! Well done ! Oh, dear! Forshame! &c.

DERIVATIONs.
Words are derived from one another in various ways,
namely: 1. Nouns are sometimes derived from verbs;
as, from write comes writer; sometimes from adjectives;
as, from white comes whiteness, and from long comes
length. *
2. Verbs are derived from nouns, adjectives, and some
times from adverbs; as, from salt comes “to salt;” from
warm comes “To warm;” from forward comes “To
forward.”
3. Adjectives are derived from nouns; as, from health
comes “Healthy.”
4. Adverbs are derived from adjectives, by adding ly; as,
from base comes “Basely.”
5. Some nouns are derived from other nouns,by adding
the terminations hood or head, ship, ery, wick, rick, dom,
ian, ment, and age,
6. When participles are used before nouns to express
quality, they are ADIECTIVEs; but when they signify
action, they are VERBs. (See page 42, No. 7.)

PART SECOND ON PARSING.
Parse is pronounced as parce, to rhyme with farce,
purse; and not pronounced as if written parze. It is
indispensably necessary that the pupil should be a good
parser, Indeed, so obviously great is the utility of
parsing, that no proficiency can be obtained without it.
And, if it is of such paramount advantage, the teacherwho
neglects this important exercise is justly chargeable with
a high degree of culpability.
Parsing is to resolve a sentence into the elements or
parts of speech. It is presumed, the pupil ere this, is
sufficiently acquainted with the inflection of every word;
but togive full scope to the learner's discriminating faculty,
the residue of the exercises contain all the parts of speech,
promiscuously arranged. I shall here introduce a set of
appropriate questions, the answers to which must be
given ExACTLY as they are in the definitions on the
different parts of speech in the Grammar.
The student will find the method of exercising himself
upon the article and noun at page 16; the method of
exercising the article, noun, and adjective atpage 23; the
pronoun, together with the article, noun, and adjective, at
page 32; the verb, at pages 54 and 55; the adverb, at
pages 75 and 76; the preposition, at page 78; the con
junction, at page 80; the interjection, at page 81.
RULES TO BE COMMITTED TO MEMORY
PREPARATORY TO PARSING.
1. Nou.Ns and PRONoUNs, governed by active-transi
tive verbs and prepositions, are in the OBJECTIVE case;
as, “The master commands the boys.” “Between him
and her.” (See page 14; also page 77, No. 2.)
Here the noun, boys, is governed by the ACTIVE-TRANSITIVE verb,
commands, and is therefore the objective case. (Seepages 15 and 34.)
In the second example, between is a PREPosition, and the words
him and her are pronouns in the objective case. (Seepage 77, No. 2)
2. When two nouns come together, signifying different
things, the former is put in the possessive, and the latter
will also be in the possessive; as, “Henry's pen.” Here,
pen is in the possessive case, the same as Henry's This
must be particularly attended to in the parsing lessons.

See the questions page 83, and

them. -
In parsing, the teacher should be particular in asking the ques
tion on the different parts of speech, in the order they are given
in the Table of Etymological parsing, until the questions and
answers are become familiar. The pupil should be requested to
give a reason for every thing he says. After this, the pupil
should be made to understand, that he gives an answer to every
88 ENGLISH GRAMMAR.
question, which is supposed to be asked, without obliging the
teacher to lose time to no purpose in asking them. Thus were
the sentence “The boys learn well,” to be parsed, the pupil
might say:—The, is the definite article, because it refers to some
particular boys; as, “The boys who learn.” Boys, a noun, be
cause it is the name of persons, common, masculine, because it
denotes the male sex, plural, because it denotes more than one,
nominative, third person, because I speak of boys. Learn, a verb,
active-transitive, because it denotes action, and it makes sense
with a noun or pronoun coming after it, regular, because it forms
its past tense and past participle by adding ed to the present,
indicative, present, boys is its nominative or agent, plural number,
because its nominative boys is plural; (conjugate it). Well, an
adverb, because it is added to the verb learn, of the affirmation.
Some of the following lessons have already been parsed in part,
but, in order that the pupil may be completely master of the
parsing, he must take them consecutively, answering the ques
tions in the Table of Etymological parsing page 83. When the
questions are familiar to him, he may then leave off the questions,
as is elucidated in the examples, above. I have arranged them
in an alphabetical order, for the convenience of reference. Also
they are further divided into lesser portions, in order to accom
modate the different arrangements of schools. For there are
some who teach in class, then a larger portion is necessary than
when pupils are taught singly. Besides this, a parent may in
struct his own child, in small portions as is convenient.
LESSON a.
An owl. The constitution. Constancy. Nothing. Yorkshire.
The Caesars. Wisdom. The fields. The scholar's duty. The
vices. Temperance. Parchment. George. An earthquake.
Blackness. A good heart. The verdant fields. Composed

An affable deportment. A gloomy cavern. Unwholesome

wife's mother. A resolution wise, noble, and disinterested. I am
sincere. You shall submit. They will obey us. He is disin
terested. We honour them. Thou dost improve. Let him

LESSON C.
Having been deserted, he became discouraged. These are
yours; those are ours. Each must answer the question. Every
heart knows its own sorrows. It was neither. Whose books are
these? Whom have we served? One may deceive one's self.
Some are negligent, others industrious. All have a talent to

ETYMOLOGY. 89
LEssoN d.
The house was sold at a great price, and above its value. She
came down stairs slowly, but went briskly up again. He is
his class-mate, but not so learned. We ought to be thankful for
we have received much. Neither prosperity nor adversity has
improved him. He can acquire no virtue, unless he make some
sacrifices. If he has promised, he should act accordingly. Though
he condemn me, I will respect him.
No. 2.
Notwithstanding his poverty, he is a wise and worthy person.
Hope often amuses, but seldom satisfies us. O peace! how
desirable art thou! I have been often occupied, alas! with trifles.
Strange! that we should be so infatuated. Ah! the delusion of
hope. Hark! how sweetly the woodlark sings. The ten dirty,
idle boys and girls.
LESSON e.
Oh! the humiliation to which vice reduces us. Hail simplicity'
source of general joy. Behold! how pleasant it is for brethern to
dwell together in unity! Welcome again! my long lost friend.
If thou wert his superior, thou shouldst not have boasted.
Though he is often advised yet he does not reform. Forget the
faults of others, and remember your own. Study universal recti
tude, and cherish religious hope.
No. 2.
Suit your desires to things, and not things to your desires.
Abstain from pleasure and bear evil. Expect the same filial duty
from your children which you paid to your parents. Consider
yourself a citizen of the world; and deem nothing which regards
humanity unworthy of your notice.
LEssoN f.
Chiefly on the article, noun, adjective, and pronoun.—Henry has
great fear. The apples are ripe. This is truly a most delightful
scene. The birds sing sweetly. The fragrance is delightful.
The wines are sour. A distant sound isheard. Adverbs qualify
verbs, and sometimes other adverbs. That man who is neither
elated by success, nor dejected by disappointment, whose conduct
is not influenced by any change of circumstances to deviate from
the line of integrity, possesses true fortitude of mind.
LEssON g.
A few sentences of the same words constituting different parts of
speech.—Damp air is unwholesome. Guilt often casts a damp over
our sprightliest hours. Few days pass without some clouds. The
few and the many have their prepossessions. A little attention
will rectify some errors. The gay and dissolute think little of the
miseries which are stealing softly after them. Many persons are
better than we suppose them to be. Though she is rich and fair,
yet she is not amiable. A soft body damps the sound much more

LESSON 71.
Few days pass without some clouds. Think much, and speak
little. Yesterday I ought to have been there. Yes, it was I that
called. Matter is presented to us in three very different condi
tions—in the solid, in the liquid, and in the gaseous form. Gases
are very thin, like the air which we breath.
LESSON 0.
Vapour is the name given to any matter which may be thin and
gaseous, like the air, but differing from it, in being easily con
densed into a liquid, as steam, which becomes water when exposed
to cold. All kinds of matter tend to attract each other, mass to
mass, and particle to particle. Air is not an element, but a com
pound of two gases, oxygen and nitrogen, and its chemical
properties depend principally upon the oxygen it contains.
Nitrogen gas is observed only in a few vegetable substances.
LEssoN p.
I go on horseback. I and you intend going. They live in the
city. We go by his order. I attend for my master. Either you
or I must attend. He is a scholar, but very reserved. I will

No. 2.
Sit near us. He is going from Sheffield to London with his
sister beside him. He came within the time. They are more
learned, because they are more industrious. Letters were intro
duced from Phoenicia into Greece, by Cadmus. A comma is put

LEsson q.
This diversion is adapted for both young and old; but young
people should be cautious not to indulge in it to excess, for, if
they do, it may injure their health. Though it was evident that
he was sorry, yet he would persist. He will stay until they

Notwithstanding his age, he is very dificient. Consider the ravens;

barn; and God feedeth them,

LESSON 7°.
I have proved him to be honest, wherefore do you doubt. It
is not convenient, else why should they disappove of it. If they
are contented so are we. The life is more than meat, and the
body more than raiment. Why should they contend, seeing he
is convinced? He was expensive, whereas his income was small.
They will not attempt it, lest they should err. They cannot be
gratified unless they delight in the scenes of nature.
LESSON S.
Hail, simplicity' source of genuine joy. Hark! how sweetly
the woodlark sings. Immortal! man. The sky is changed !—
and such a change | O, night! that all was lost! What a piece
of work is man! how noble in reason! how infinite in faculty!
in form and moving, how express and admirable! in action, how
like an angel! in apprehension, how like a God! O Caledonia!
stern and wild, meet nurse for a poetic child!
No. 2.
Unfaded hope! when life's last embers burn,
When soul to soul, and dust to dust return!
Heaven to thy charge resigns the awful hour !
Oh! then, thy kingdom comes! Immortal power!
What, though each spark of earth-born rapture fly
The quivering lip, pale cheek, and closing eye |
O wretched state | O bosom black as death!
O limed soul! that, struggling to be free,
Art more engag’d.
LESSON t.
Discretion stamps a value upon all our qualities; lt instructs
us to make use of them atpropertimes, and turns them honourably
to our own advantage; it shows itself alike in all our words and
actions, and serves as an unerring guide in every occurence of life.
Shame and disappointment attend sloth and idleness. Gentleness
ought to form our address, to regulate our speech, and to diffuse
itself over our whole behaviour. Meekness controls our angry
passions; candour our severe judgments. Restlessness of mind
disqualifies us both for the enjoyment of our peace and the per
formance of our duty.
No. 2.
Chiefly on the neuter and passive verb, and the verb
“TO BE.”
A virtuous education is a better inheritance than a great estate.
Good and wise men only can be real friends. The coach arrives
daily. Nothing appears to be so low and mean as lying and dis
simulation. You may be deprived of honour and riches against
your will; but not of virtue without your consent.
94 ENGLISH GRAMMAR.
No. 3.
words arelike arrows, and should not be shot at random. There
is not a more pleasing exercise of the mind than gratitude; it is
accompanied with such an inward satisfaction, that the duty is
sufficiently rewarded by the performance. I have long been taught,
that the afflictions of this life are overpaid by that eternal weight
of glory which awaits the virtuous. These two things cannot be
disjoined—a pious life and a happy death.
LESSON ?t.
Forget the faults of others, and remember your own. Suit your
desires to things, and not things to your desires. Consider your
self a citizen of the world, and deem nothing which regards huma
nity unworthy of your notice. Let your religion connect prepa
ration for Heaven with an honourable discharge of active life. Let
your words agree with your thoughts, and be followed by your
actions. We observed him walk off hastily.
And that tongue of his, that bade the Romans
Mark him, and write his speeches in their books,
Alas! it cried—give me some drink. Titimius.
No. 2.
Abstain from pleasure and bear evil. Expect the same filial
duty from your children which you paid to your parents. Be kind
and courteous to all, and be not eager to take offence without just
reason. Practise humility, and reject everything in dress, car
riage, or conversation, which has any appearance of pride.
LESSON ??.
Position of the Nominative. (See Rule 4 of Syntax.)
RULE 1.—The nominative generally precedes the
verb; but this position is sometimes changed, and the
nominative follows the verb, when the sentence begins
with here, there, then, thence, hence, thus, hereafter, now,
when a question is asked, a commandgiven, a wish expres
sed, and when if or thou is understood. (This rule to
be got by heart.)
OBSERVATIONs.—To find the nominative to a verb, ask the ques
tions who or what with the verb, and the word that answers the
question will be the nominative; thus, “I have got some work to
dispose of.” What have you got? “Some work.”
RULE 2.—The nominative sometimes consists of one
or more nouns or pronouns; as in the example “James,
John and you are learning grammar.” Who is learning
grammar P James, John, and you.
Where is thy brother? Gaming is a vice pregnant with every
evil, and to it are often sacrificed wealth, happiness, and every
ETYMOLOGY. ' 95
thing virtuous and valuable. Then shall thy light break forth as
the morning. Were he at leisure, I would wait on him. Were he
to assert it, 1 would not believe it.
No. 2.
RULE.—The nominative is often a great distance from
the verb.
That fortitude which has encountered no dangers, that prudence
which has surmounted no difficulties, that integrity which has
been attacked by no temptations, can at best be considered but as
gold not yet brought to the test, of which, therefore, the true
value cannot be assigned.
No. 3.
To endure misfortune with resignation, and bear it with forti
tude, is the striking characteristic of a great mind. To be at once
merry and malicious is the sign of a corrupt heart and weak under
standing. To advise the ignorant, relieve the needy, and comfort
the afflicted, are duties that fall in our way almost every day of
our lives.
LESSON 20.
Chiefly on the relative Pronoun and its nominative.
The chief misfortunes that befall us in life can be traced to
some vices or follies we have committed. Justice consists not
merely in performing those duties which the laws of society
obliges us to perform, but in our duty to our Maker, to others,
and to ourselves. The veil which covers from our sight the events
of succeeding years, is a veil woven by the hand of mercy.
No. 2.
RULE.—When the antecedent and relative are both in
the nominative, the relative is the nominative to the verb
next it, and the antecedent is generally the nominative
to the second verb.
He that does good for the sake of virtue, seeks neither praise
nor reward, though he is sure of both at the last. He who is a
stranger to industry may possess, but he cannot enjoy; he only
who is active and industrious can experience real pleasure. That
wisdom which enlightens the understanding and reforms the life,
is the most valuable.
No. 3.
RULE 1.—The objective generally comes after the
verb that governs it; but when a relative, and in some
other cases, it comes before it.
2.—When two objectives follow a verb, the thing is
governed by the verb, and the person by a preposition
understood
96 ENGLISH GRAMMAR.
Him whom ye ignorantly worship, declare I unto you. If thy
brother shall trespass against thee, go, and tell him of his fault
between thee and him alone. He taught me grammar. These
curiosities we have imported from China. Give me understand
ing. Sell me meat for money.
LESSON a'.
RULE 1.—The objective after an active-transitive verb,
especially when a relative, is often understood.
2.—Sometimes the antecedent is improperly omitted,
and must be supplied.
Our good or bad fortune depends on the choice we make of our
friends. He eats regularly, drinks moderately, and reads often.
Let him labour with his hands, that he may have to give to him
that needeth. There have been that have delivered themselves
from their misfortunes by their good conduct or virtue. Few re
flections are more distressing than those we make on our own
ingratitude.
No. 2.
RULE.—The Past Participle has uniformly either a
relative or personal pronoun, with some part of the verb
to be understood before it.
Knowledge softened with complacency and good breeding, will
make a man beloved and admired. Precepts have little influence
when not enforced by example. Mere external beauty is of little
estimation; and deformity, when associated with amiable dispo
sitions and useful qualities, does not preclude our respect and
approbation. Modesty seldom resides in a breast not enriched
with noble virtue. Economy, prudently and temperately con
ducted, is the safeguard of many virtues; and is, in a particular
manner, favourable to exertions of benevolence.
No. 3.
Supply all the words that are understood. The infini
tive to be, or to have, is often understood.—Not supplying

I love you as well as him. Virtue is of intrinsic value and

PART III.
SYNTAX.
1. SYNTAx is that part of Grammar by which we are
taught the proper arrangement, dependence, and con
structions of words in a sentence or phrase, according to
rule. -
The word SYNTAx comes from the Greek syntaxis, which is
compounded of avv, with, and raačva, to order. Syntax when
applied to grammar relates to the agreement and government of
words.
2. A sBNTENCE is a number of words so arranged as
to make complete sense; as, “I study grammar.”
Sentence both in French and English is from the Latin sEN
TENTIA, a thought Or meaning.
3. Sentences are of two kinds, simple and compound.
4. A simple sentence contains but one subject (or
nominative), one finite verb, and one noun or pronoun;
as, “James loves me.”
1. There are several sorts of simple sentences. An explicative
or affirmative, explains or asserts something; as, “I love virtue.”
2. A negative sentence, is one in which the adverb not is used;
as, “I do not fear him.”
3. An interrogative sentence asks a question; as, “Does he
write ”
4. An imperative sentence commands; as, “Do this work.”
ORSERVE.—A finite verb is that to which number and person
appertain. The infinitive mood has no respect to number or
person. -
5. A compound sentence contains two or more simple
sentences, connected by one or more conjunctions; as,
“Life is short, but eternity is long.”
6. Sentences are divided by stops. Those parts of a
sentence which are separated by commas, are called
clauses; and those separated by semicolons, are called
members.
7. A phrase is two or more words put together so as
to express a certain relation between our ideas, without
affirming anything, or making a proposition; as, “In
good earnest.” “In truth.”
SYNTAX. 99
8. The principal parts of a simple sentence are three,
the subject, or nominative; the attribute, or verb; and the
object. All the other parts ofasentence are called adjuncts.
OBs.—The principal ADJUNCTs are ADJECTIVEs and ADVERBs.
The ADJUNCTs are those words which modify, complete, or deter
mine the signification of the Nouns or verbs to which they refer.
They are of three kinds; namely, those which modify the NoUN;
those which complete the signification of the VERB; and those
which determine the signification of the SENTENCE.
9. The subject is the thing chiefly spoken of; the
attribute (or verb) is the thing or action affirmed or de
nied; and the object is the thing affected by such action,
affirmation, or denial; as, “George writes his copy.”
Here “George” is the subject; “writes” is the attribute
or thing affirmed; and “copy” the object.
OBs.—The subject, agent, or nominative is the person, or thing
acting. (See page 15 and 65.) The attribute or verb is the action
done; and the object is the thing affected by such action.
10. Words used to explain or modify either the subject,
attribute, or object, are placed as near as possible to the
words to which they belong.
11. Every sentence, or complete sense, must have, at
least, one verb expressed or understood. Verbs are the
life of sentences; no sentence can be complete sense
without a verb.
12. SYNTAx principally consists of two parts; concord
and government. -
13. CoNCORD or AGREEMENT is that which one word
has over another, in gender, number, case, or person.
14. GoverNMENT, or REGIMEN, is that power which
one part of speech has over another, in directing its mood,
tense, or case.
15. All words that are omitted by ellipsis, and that are
necessarily understood to complete the construction,
must be supplied in parsing.

100 ENGLISH GRAMMAR.
RULE 1.—When a pronoun is used as the subject of
a verb it should be the nominative pronoun; as, “He
and she were married.”
ILLUSTRATIONs.—“He and she were married.” Here you see
that “He and she” are two pronouns; the subject to “were read
ing.” We cannot say, him reads, her runs, me speaks, &c.,
because him, her, and me, are objective pronouns.
REMARK.—There is an apparent exception to this rule when
the verb To BE is used with a perfect participle of an active verb,
the objective is the subject of the verb, and the subject becomes
the object governed by a preposition; as, “We are loved by
him.” In this sentence the subject or doer is represented by the
objective pronoun him, and the thing done to, or object, is repre
sented by the nominative pronoun we. But though this appears
to be an exception to this rule, strictly speaking it does not belong
to it, but to the rules belonging to prepositions and active-transi
tive verbs. (See rule 39.)
STUDENT.—What is a pronoun? Repeat the nominative pro
nouns. Name the objective pronouns. What is the first point to
be noticed under this rule ! Ans. The subject of a verb. What
do you mean by the subject of a verb Ans. The nominative or
thing chiefly spoken of The pronoun of every sentence should
be in the nominative case.
The subject is always either a noun, pronoun, or a word or form
of words equal in effect to a noun.
Correct the following violations—1. Him and her were married.
2. Whom is it? 3. Him and me came together. 4. My brother
and him are good writers. 5. You and us enjoy many privileges.
6. Us three learn grammar. 7. Him whom ye pretend reigns in
heaven. 8. Whom of all men in the world, do you think was
chosen? 9. Them and us learn geometry. 10. Thee and him
might live godly. 11. She and him got the prize. 12. Them and
us went to the lectures. 13. Him and them were the topic of
their conversation. 14. Thou and them were present. 15. Her
and him never quarrel. 16. Them are them which testify of me.
RULE 2.—Werbs whether expressed or understood, and
the words than and as require a nominative pronoun for
their subject; as, “He is wiser than I (am). Thou art
as good as he (is). |
ExPLANATony REMARKs.—This rule is frequently violated.
We ought never to use an objective pronoun in such cases. You
may find that the pronoun is the subject of the verb, by filling up
the ellipses. “John can read better than I.” Fill up the ellipsis.
John can read better than I (can). .
“I love my country as well ashim,” is grammar, if it is intended:
to convey the following meaning: “I love my country as well as
I love him.” Strictly speaking this example does not come under
this rule; for, “I love" is an active-transitive verb, which governs
the objective case. (See Rule 39.)
| SYNTAX. 101
If a preposition or an active-transitive verb is understood before
the pronoun, then the pronoun should be in the objective case;
as, “It was better done by him than by me.” Here the pronouns
“him” and “me” are under the influence of the preposition “by.”
(See Rule on Or.) Hence, thrn, and as, do not influence the
case of personal pronouns, but the pronoun is either the nomi
native to a verb, or the object governed by a verb or preposition.
ILLUSTRATIONs.—“John can read better than me.” Me should
be I, because it is the nominative to “can write” understood;
that is, “better than I” (can write). “He is as good as her.”
Her, should be she, because it is the nominative to is understood,
i.e., “He is as good as she (is).”
STUDENT.—What are you to notice first under this rule? Ans.
Werbs expressed or understood. What is the second? The words
than and as. What do they require? Nominative pronouns for
their subjects. How are you to know the subject? By supply
ing the verb understood.
WIoLATIONs to BE correcTED.—1. He is younger than me. 2.
She suffers hourly more than me. 3. They are greater gainers
than us. 4. They know how to write as well as him, but he is a
better grammarian than them. 5. John can write better than me.
6. If the kinggive usleave, we may perform the office as wellasthem
that do. 7. He is as good as her. S. It was me that wrote the
letter. 9. She is not so learned as him. 10. Cromwell than
whom no man was better skilled in artifice. 11. Whom do you
think I am. 12. They can write as well as him, but he is a better
grammarian. 13. A stone is heavy and the sand weighty; but a
fool's wrath is heavier than them both.
RULE 3.—Nominative pronouns must be used with all
the persons of the verb To BE whether pronouns come
before or after the verb; as, “It is he.”
CAUTIONS AND ExPLANATORY REMARKs.—Both Lennie and Mur
ray say “The verb To BE through all its variations has the same
case after it, as that which next precedes it.” Let us reflect; and
we shall see, that, whenever an objective pronoun is used either
before or after the verb “To Be,” that pronoun is governed by
an active-transitive verb or preposition; as, “You believe it to
be him,” not he. “Whenever the verb ‘To BE is used the
receiver or be-er is, or must be” a nominative pronoun. When
the infinitive mood To BE follows an objective case it requires an
objective pronoun after it; as, “I understood it to be him.” The
auxiliary verb To BE conjugates passive verbs only; neuter
verbs are conjugated as the active voice with have. We must not
say “When I was come.” “He is arrived.” “They are de
parted.” We should say “When I had come.” “He has arrived.”
“They have departed.” Part of a sentence is sometimes the
nominative both before and after the verb To BE.
ILLUSTRATION.—“It was not me.” “Was” is the verb to be, and
requires “I” nominative after. “It” before was, is the nomina
tive as well as the objective; but here, according to rule, we call
it the nominative,
102 ENGLISH GRAMMAR.
STUDENT.—What are you to notice first? Ans. Nominative
pronouns. What is the second? Nominative pronouns must be
used, &c. What are you to do with them? To place a nomina
tive both before and after the verb “To Be.” Mention some of
the verbs that are of the verb To Be. Ans. Am, was, are, were,
is, may, can, has, have, &c. What does the verb “To Be” signify?
Ans. (Page 58.)
EXERCISES–WIOLATIONS.
1. It was him who wrote the letter. 2. Be not afraid, it is me.
3. It was them who gave it. 4. Whom think ye that I am. 5.
Was it me who said so. 6. I am certain it was not him. 7. It
might have been him. 8. It is impossible to be them. 9. It
was either him or his brother who got the prize. 10. I am her.
11. He said it was not them, 12. Was it him who gave you that
intelligence. 13. I said they were them. 14. Art thou him.
15. I know not whether it were them who conducted the business,
but I am certain it was not him. 15. You were convinced it was
not me you saw.
RULE 4.—VERBs must be in the same number and
person as their suBJECTs or nominative case; as, “I
learn.” “Thou mayest.” “The boys play.”
OBSERVATIONs.—The subject or nominative, will be either a
noun or a pronoun. To find the subject of a verb, ask the ques.
tions who or what, with the verb, and the word that answers to the
question is the subject to the verb; as, “John can write.” Who can
write? Answer: John. Then you see John is the subject to the
verb write. The plural verb never ends in s. What is the plural
of is—of was—of has 2 Answer: Are, were, have.
PosLTION OF THE suBJECT (or nominative.)
1. The subject, though generally placed before the verb,is often
placed after it; especially when the sentence begins with here,
there, then, thence, hence, then, yet, hereafter, thus, yet, so, now, such,
herein, therein, wherein, &c.
2. When a question is asked, when a command is given, a
wish expressed, a supposition is elliptically expressed or made
without if; also, after a neuter verb.
3. When a sentence depends on neither or nor so as to be
coupled with another sentence.
4. When we wish to dignify the subject and make it more
emphatic.
STUDENT.—What are you to notice first under this rule?
Answer: The verb, What is the second? Its subject. What do
you mean by its subject? The subject is the thing chiefly spoken
of, or is that which is affirmed or denied. What is a verb 2 (See
page 34, No. 1.) What are you to do with the verb and its sub
ject? Make them agree. What do you mean by agree? If the
subject is singular or denotes one thing, the verb must be singular;
if plural, or the subject denotes more than one, the verb must be
plural. If the subject is the first person, the verb must be the
Jirst person; if the second, the verb must be the second, &c.
SYNTAX. 103
OBSERVE.—1. You must not alter the subject, it is right; but
the verb must be made to agree with it in number and person.
2. All singular nouns are of the third person singular, and all
plural mouns are of the third person plural. 3. When you have
read a sentence, ask, Which is the subject or thing chiefly spoken
of? Is it singular or plural? Then look for the verb and make
it agree with its subject.
ILLUSTRATIONs.—“I says it.” Which is the verb in this sen
tence? Says. How do you know? Because it affirms some
thing. What is its subject? “I.” Do they agree? No. In
what dothey disagree? In number? No; they agree in number,
for they are both singular. They disagree in person; for “says”
should be say in the first person, because “I” is the first person;
and verbs must be, &c. Repeat the rule every sentence you
correct.
Violations of the rule to be corrected.—1. I loves reading. 2.
They runs. 3. We works well. 4. They appears lovely. 5. All
proves right. 6. We understands you. 7. Books teaches silently.
8. Boys plays rudely. 9. Children loves play. 10. You judges
rightly. 11. You composes correctly. 12. They was with us.
13. Is your relations in town. 14. Thou shallnot kill. 15. The
days is short. 16. The number are small. 17. There's two or
three of us. 18. Where is the snuffers. 19. He need not go.
20. Whence camest they, 21. Menjudges partially. 22. Many
battles was fought and many men was killed. 23. A variety of
pleasing objects charm the eye. 24. Great pains has been taken
to make this rule plain. 25. The days of man is but as grass.
26. So much of both merit and ability are seldom found. 27.
There is many occasions in life in which silence and simplicity
is true wisdom. 28. His head and hairs was like wool, and his
eyes as a flame of fire. 29. And they had tails like scorpions,
and there was stings in their tails, and their power were to hurt
men five months. 30. There is more cultivators of the earth than
of their own hearts. 31. Not one whom thou sees clothed in pur
ple are happy. 32. What signifies rules of grammar if none will
attend to them.
RULE 5.—Two or more singular nouns or pronouns,
coupled with AND or wiTH, expressed or implied, require
a verb and pronoun in the plural; as, “John AND James
were there.” “The king witH his guards were there,
and they made the town busy.
OBSERVATIONs.—1. Writers frequently violate this rule; for
when a singular noun has a close joined to it by with, it is some
times used with a plural verb, and sometimes with a singular; for
example, some would write, “The boys with the master was
Writing.” Was should be were, in this and similar sentences. 2.
When the nouns are nearly related in sense, they must be followed
by plural nouns and pronouns; and not, as Murray and many
others say, in the singular. When “As well as” can be turned into
and, the verb and pronoun must be plural. 3. Though the rule
104 ENGLISH GRAMMAR.
says, “Two or more nouns or pronouns” they all may be nomi
native pronouns. These singulars being adequately engaged in
doing or being are equal to they.
QUESTIONs.—1. What is a noun? 2. How many numbers have
nouns? 3. What does the singular express—what the plural?
4. How is the plural formed? 5. What is a verb 7 6. What is
a plural verb. Answer: One that does not end with s. 7. What
is a pronoun? 8. Repeat all the plural pronouns. (See p. 26.)
STUDENT.—What are you to notice first in this rule? Two or
more, singular, &c. What is the second? A verb and pronoun.
What do they require? A verb and pronoun in the plural. Ex
plain yourself. When a pronoun refers to singular nouns before
and after with and and, the verb and pronoun must be plural.
ILLUSTRATIONs.—“Your book and pen is in the desk.” Which
are the two nouns? “Book and pen.” To what are they equal?
A plural. Which is the verb’ “Is.” Singular or plural?
Singular; and should be plural, are. Because two or more sin
gular, &c. “John and James are come; they have been.” Here
they agrees with the two singular nouns, “John and James.”
VIoIATIONs of THIs RULE.—1. Mary and Jane is not at home.
2. She and her father was in the garden. 3. Time and tide waits
for no man. 4. Humility with poor apparels, excels pride and
ignorance under costly attire. 5. The planetary system, bound
less space, and the immense ocean, affects the mind with sensa
tions of astonishment. 6. Religion and virtue, our best support
and highest honour, confers on the mind principles of noble
independence. 7. What signifies the counsel and care of pre
ceptors, when youth think they have no need of assistance. 8.
His politeness and good disposition was, on failure of their effect,
entirely changed. 9. Wisdom, virtue, happiness dwells with the
mediocrity. 10. Presumption and self-conceit overshadows the
brightest attainments. 1 1. Lightning and electric matter is the
same. 12. Liberality and thankfulness is the bond of concord.
13. Quietnessandpeace flourishes wherejustice andreason governs.
RULE 6.—When not is joined to and disuniting the
second close of the sentence from the first, the verb then
refers to only one of the nominatives, and the verb must
be singular; as, “He and not she was present;” that is,
“He was there, but she was not.”
STUDENT.—What are you to notice first? Answer: When not
is joined to and, &c. What is the second ? The verb is used in
the singular in such cases.
VIoLATIONs.—1. Genuine piety and not great riches, make a
death-bed easy. 2. Ignorance and not negligence, have produced
this mistake. 3. Her prudence, not her possessions, render her
an object of desire. 4. Good order and not mean savings, pro
duce profit.
RULE 7.—Two or more singular nouns, coupled with
and, require a verb and pronoun in the singular, when
they express only one person or thing; as, “That able
scholar and critic has been eminently useful.
SYNTAX. 105
STUDENT.—What are youto notice first? Two or more singular
nouns coupled with and. What do they require? They require
a verb and pronoun in the singular, “when they refer to one
person or thing.”
2. When comparison is expressed or implied, and not
combination, the verb and pronoun must be singular; as,
“He, as well as I, must perform his duty;” that is, “He
must perform his duty, as well as I must perform mine.”
STUDENT.—What do you notice first? When comparison, &c.
Of what number must the verb and pronoun be in such cases?
WIoLATIONs.—l. She, as well as he, were studious at their
books. 2. Burke, as well as Chatham, distinguished themselves
in the British senate. 3. That superficial scholar and critic, like
some renowned critics of our own, have furnished most decisive
proofs that they knew not the characters of the Hebrew language.
4. It is true, that the prince, as well as the people, were to blame.
RULE 8.—When a pronoun refers to two words of
different persons coupled with AND, the pronoun becomes
plural, and agrees with the first person, when I or we is
mentioned, and with the second when I or we is not men
tioned; as, “Thou and Thomas shared between you.”
ILLUSTRATIONs.—“Thou and he shared it between them.” Here
“Thou” and “He” are the two words coupled with and; but
neither “ I” nor “We” is mentioned, therefore, the pronoun
then, which is of the third person, should be of the second—
“You”—according to rule.
REMARKs.—The first or second person will always be one of
the parties. The pronoun will always be either of the first or
second person plural,
STUDENT.—Decline the personal pronouns. (See page 26, No.
14) What do you notice first? A pronoun, whether it refers,
&c. What is the second? Two words of different persons
coupled with and. What do you do next? Make the pronoun
plural, and of the first person, when I or we is mentioned; and
of the second when I or we is not mentioned. Tell all the plural
personal pronouns.—(See page 26, No. 14.)
WIOLATIONS.-1. James and I are attentive to their studies.
2. You and he are diligent in reading their books, therefore they
are good boys. 3. Thou and he shared it between them. 4. He
and I attend to their business. 5. You and James have got their
lessons. 6. Thou, he, and I, are attending to your studies. 7.
You and I are constantly employed in your domestic affairs.
8. He and you honour our parents.
RULE 9. The words one, this, that, each, every, either,
neither, or, and nor, require verbs, nouns, and pronouns
in the singular. All is joined with a singular, when it
refers to quantity, and with a plural noun when it refers
to number. -
F 3
106 ENGLISH GRAMMAR.
Observations.—Each denotes two or more persons or things
taken separately. Each other denotes two. One another denotes
more than two; as, “They killed one another.” Every relates to
several persons or things, and signifies each one of them all taken
separately; as, “Every one of them is here.” It is sometimes
joined to plural nouns which convey unity of idea; as, “Every
ten men;” then the verb will be plural. Either signifies the one
or the other, but not both. To say either of the three is improper.
Neither imports not either. Either is sometimes improperly used
instead of each. Neither, nor, either, and or, should be placed
near the words to which they refer.
STUDENT.—What are you to notice first? The words, &c.
What do those words require? Verbs, nouns, and pronouns in
the singular. How do you use all?
Violations.—1. Every man are here. 2. Each of the men
paid their share. 3. The kings sat each upon their thrones. 4.
Ignorance or negligence have caused this mistake. 5. Neither
character nor dialogue were yet understood. 6. Either his grati
tude or compassion were roused. 7 Neither poverty nor riches
were injurious to him. 8. Neither the masternor the servant were
there. 9. One are never satisfied. 10. Let each of us mind
their own business. 11. Death, or some worse misfortune, soon
divide them. 12. Virtue or vice predominate in every mind.
13. Happiness or misery are the result ofsuch conduct. 14. When
sickness, infirmity, or reverse of fortune affect us, the sincerity of
friendship is proved. 15. Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron,
took either of them his censer. 16. The king of Israel and the
king of Judah sat either of them upon his throne. 17. And
Jonathan, the son of Shimeah, slew a man of great stature, that
had on every hand six fingers, and on every foot six toes. 18. By
discussing what relates to each particular, in their order, we shall
better understand the subject. 19. Are either of these men your
friend. 20. Want ofjudgment, or want of enquiry, were occasion
of his error. 21. Hope or despair govern him. 22. Man is not
such a machine as a clock or a watch, which move merely as they
are moved. 23. The returns of kindness are sweet; and there
are neither honour, nor virtue, nor utility in resisting them. 24.
Either you or your friend were present.

RULE 10.—A singular and a plural noun, separated
by oR or Nor, require a verb in the plural, and the nomi
native plural should be placed next to the verb; as,
“Either, he, or they were offended at it.”
If the verb has been expressed to the first nominative,
it must be repeated to the second; also, when a parti
cular emphasis is made; as, “Neither was poverty nor
were riches injurious to him.”
ILLUSTRATIONs.—“Neither your intention nor reasons has
influence.” Here, “intention” is singular, and “reasons” plural;
and the verb “has” singular, which ought to be have to agree with
“reasons.” “Neither she nor her sisters were commanded.” If
we wish to lay a particular stress upon the nominative, the verb
must be repeated to both; thus, “Neither was she, nor were her
sisters commanded.”

WIoLATIONs.—l. Either his brother or parents was to blame.
2. Neither he nor his brothers was present. 3. He or they was
offended. 4. Neither the captain nor the sailors was saved. 5.
Neither the king nor his ministers deserves to be praised. 6. The
deceitfulness of riches, or cares of this life, has choked the seed
of virtue in many. 7. Whether one or more was concerned in
the business does not yet appear. 8. Neither the thunder nor
the storms was injurious. 9. Neither was the moon nor stars
visible. 10. Either the general was there, or was some of his
officers. 11. Neither were their exertions nor their skill successful.
12. Neither were his honours nor his estate inherited by his
descendants.
RULE 11.—When the subject of a verb consists of
pronouns of different persons separated by or or NoR, the
verb should be supplied to each nominative; as, “Either
he is or I am the man.”
ExPLANATORY REMARKs.—Murray, Lennie, Guy, and most
grammarians say “When singular nominatives of different per
sons are separated by oR or Nor, the verb agrees with the person
next it; as, “Either thou or I am in fault.”’ Lennie observes,
“The verb, though expressed only to the last person, is under
108 ENGLISH GRAMMAR.
stood to the rest. and the sentence when the ellipsis is supplied
stands thus, “Either thou art or I am in fault.” Let us fill up a
few sentences, and then we shall have a fair specimen of gram
matical elegance. “They am in fault, or I am in fault; I is the
author, or they is the author, or he is the author.” I suppose that
grammarians thought itprudent to adopt this rule of error, because
great writers frequently committed these errors: let us set our
selves against such formidable authority, rather than violate the
rules of grammar. Such sentences may always be put into a
different form, and it is better to take a little trouble, than to
write nonsense, or even questionable grammar.
ILLUSTRATIONs.—“Either he or I am going.” Here “he” re
quires is after it, and “I” requires am. According to rule this
sentence is read thus “Either he is going or I am going.” Or,
“Either he is, or I am going.” -
STUDENT.—What are you to notice first? When the subject of
a verb, &c. What do you mean by different persons? The one
in the first person, the other in the second or third, &c. What
are you to do with the verb? Supply it after each nominative.
In order to avoid stiff and pedantic language what are you to do?
Avoid inconvenient forms of expression.
VIoIATIONs.—1. He, thou, or I art the author of it. 2. Either
he or I is to blame. 3. John or I has done it, 4. He or thou is
the person who must write grammar. 5. Either Thomas or thou
has tore the book. 6. Thou or I art the person that must under
take the business. 7. Neither he nor you is attentive to your
interests. 8. She or Charles is still playing. 9. He or I is sure
of this week's prize. 10. John or I has done it. 11. Neither you
nor I were pleased at my reception. 12. Either that man or you
is concerned in the affair.
RULE 12.—When the verb “To BE" stands between
a singular and a plural nominative, it agrees with that
which is properly its subject; and the subject must be
placed before the verb; as, “The wages of sin is death.”
“Death is the wages of sin.”
ExPLANToRY OBsERVATIONs.—In the above sentences let us try
to find the proper nominative to the verb. Is death or wages the
subject? Death is, or constitutes, the wages. The bond of society
is the laws; should be, the bond of society are the laws; for the
laws are the bond. “An author's best monument is his works;”
or, are his works. Works is properly the subject which constitute
his monument. Avoid the verb “To Be" in all such cases of
obscurity.
ILLUSTRATIONs.—“His meat was locusts and wild honey.”
Was is the verb “To BE.” and stands between meat and locusts,
and meat is the nominative, singular, therefore we use a singular
verb, “Locusts and wild honey” constitute his meat, therefore
we use a plural verb. -
Let the sense of the sentence direct you in this rule. I main
tain that when two nominatives are employed, the following verb
SYNTAX. 109
should be plural. But if you use a single nominative before the
verb, the verb should be singular also. I invite any person to
demonstrate to me the difference
STUDENT.—What is the first point? Ans. The verb “To Be."
The second? A singular and a plural nominative. Where do
you expect them to be placed ? The one before and the other
after the verb To be. Sometimes the singular is before the verb
and sometimes the plural. Where should the subject be placed?
Before the verb. Consider well which is the subject, place it
before the verb, and then make the verb agree with it.
WIoLATIONs.—1. His chief occupation were reading and writing.
2. Reading and writing was his chief occupation. 3. A great cause
of the low state of industry were the restraints put upon it. 4
The restraints which was put upon industry were the great cause
of its low state. 5. His chief occupation and enjoyment was con
troversy. 6. Controversy were his chief occupation and enjoyment.
7. His pavilion were dark waters and thick clouds. 8. The subject
of this elegy, are the poignant sufferings and affecting death of
Annabella. 9. The comeliness of youth, are modesty and frank.
ness. 10. Modesty and frankness is the comeliness of youth.
RULE 13.—When a noun of multitude conveys plu
rality of idea, the verb and pronoun should be plural; as,
“The committee were divided in their sentiments.
When a noun of multitude conveys unity of idea, the
verb and pronoun should be singular; as, “The com
mittee was sitting.”
NoTEs.— The words, corporation, regiment, remnant, nation,
flock, parliament, fleet, generation, shoal, army, class, church,
family, world, are generally singular; but, when a meeting or
counsel, &c., is unanimous it conveys unity of idea, but when not
unanimous, plurality. -
2. Mankind, peasantry, people, crowd, multitude, and sometimes
committee, are generally plural. -
ILLUSTRATIONs.—“The committee was sitting.” Here the com
mittee represents a number of individuals acting in an united
capacity, and therefore the verb must be singular——was. In the
sentence “The committee were divided in their sentiments.”
The word committee represents the individuals acting in a dis
united capacity, therefore the verb were, and pronoun their should
be employed.
STUDENT.—Name the collective nouns. Tell me the first thing
to be noticed in this rule? A noun of multitude. What is a
noun of multitude? The second? A verb and pronoun. For
what are you to look in every sentence? A noun of multitude.
What then? To look if it conveys unity or plurality of idea. If
it conveys unity what do you do? I make the verb and pronoun
in the singular. Read over the notes. If the verb conveys plu
:of idea, what do you do? I make the verb and pronoun
plural.
110 ENGLISH GRAMMAR.
Sometimes there is no pronoun in the sentence, and sometimes
there is no plural.
WIoIATIONs.—1. The people is dispersed. 2. Every class were
busy by themselves. 3. The army consist of sixty thousand.
4. The peasantry goes barefoot. 5. The crowd quarrelled among
itself. 6. There is no church careless of their own defence. 7.
Mankind is naturally jealous of its rights. 8. The meeting were
large. 9. The people rejoices in that which would give them
sorrow. 10. The whole world were about that time in expectation
of a prince out of Judea. 11. The court of Rome were not with
out solicitude. 12. The court have just ended, after having sat
through the trial of a very long cause. 13. The crowd were so
great that the judges with difficulty made their way through it.
14. The fleet were seen sailing up the channel. 15. The flock
and not the fleece, are, or ought to be the object of the shepherd's
care.
RULE 14.—Pronouns always agree with their antece
dent and the nouns which they represent, in gender,
number, and person; as, “The boys were attentive to
their lessons.
ILLUSTRATIONS.–In the sentence, “The boys were attentive to
their lessons,” boys is of the plural number, masculine, and of the
third person; the pronoun their agrees with boys in gender, num
ber, and person. “The tree is known by its fruit.” Tree is of
the neuter, singular, and of the third person; and as its refers to
trees, it must be in the same gender, number, and person.
STUDENT.—What are you to notice first? Pronouns. What is
a pronoun? What do you notice second? The antecedent.
What is meant by the antecedent? What are you to do with the
pronoun? Make it agree with the antecedent. What do you
mean by agree? To make the pronoun in the same number,
gender, and person.
VIoLATIONs.—1. John is a good boy, she loves her book. 2.
Jane and Ann are naughty; for she disobey me. 3. Beware of
pleasure who is a deadly poison. 4. Send each of them in their
turn. 5. The mind of man cannot be long without some food to
nourish the activity of his thoughts. 6. A stone is heavy, and
the sand weighty; but a fool's wrath is heavier than it both. 7.
France, who is in alliance with Sweden. 8. The foe is not so
forward as we supposed them to be. 9. A soul, inspired with the
love of truth, will keep all his powers attentive to the pursuit of
it. 10. I do not think any one should incur censure for being
tender of his reputation. 11. His sound understanding and refined
education discovered itself at a single interview.
RULE 15.—Personal pronouns must not be used for
THESE and THOSE, which have always nouns, expressed
or implied. Itis improper to say, “Give me them books;”
it should be those books.
SYNTAX. - - I 11
Nouns and numeral adjectives must agree in number
according to the sense; thus, “this books” should be
“these books,” because books is plural.
OBSERVATIONs.—1. Make these and those agree with the noun
implied or expressed. 2. This and that agree with the singular;
these and those, with the plural. (See page 19, No. 26.)
ILLUSTRATIONs.—“Them that tell lies should never be esteemed.”
“Them” should be those, for the noun person is implied. If the
noun was expressed, the sentence would read thus; “Those per
sons that’ &c.
STUDENT.—What is the first point? Personal pronouns. The
second? These and those. The third? Nouns expressed or
implied. For what should personal pronouns not be used? For
these and those. With what should a numeral adjective agree? In
number, according to the sense.
WIoLATIONs.—l. Those sort of things is made at Sheffield.
2. I have not seen him this ten years. 3. Give me them here,
4. You have been talking this three hours. 5. We have lived
here this many years. 6. I have no interests but that of truth
and virtue. 7. Those sort of favours did real injury. 8. He
has lived here this ten years. 9. Which of them two persons
has most distinguished himself 10. None more impatiently
suffer injuries than these.
RULE 16.—THEY is generally used in preference to
those, at the begining of a sentence; also, when there is
no particular reference to an antecedent; thus, those that
sow in tears, should be, “They that sow in tears.”
STUDENT.—What are you to notice first? They is to be used
instead of those, at the beginning of a sentence. What besides?
When there is no particular reference to an antecedent. What do
you mean by antecedent?
WIoLATIONs.—1. Those that are diligent will generally succeed.
2. Those that prepare to die, die happy. 3. Those who win gold
ought to wear it. 4. Those that study intently generally improve.
5. Those who are your superiors you should honour, and not
those who are your servants. 6. Those who honour me I will
honour. 7. Those who keep peace are called peacemakers. 8.
Those who hate sin will flee from it. 9. Those who seek wisdom
will certainly find her.
RULE 17—In the position of the personal pronouns,
the second person should be placed before the third; but
the first person should be placed last; as, “Thou and he
came.” “Thou, he, or I came to do it.”
NoTE.—The neuter pronoun “It” is sometimes understood
and not implied; thus we say, “As appears” for “As itappears.”
The pronoun “It” is sometimes employed to express—1. The
state or condition of anything, or the cause of something produced;
as, “How is it with you?” 2. The subject of any discourse or
I 12 ENGLISH GRAMMAR.
-
inquiry; as, “It has happened fortunately.” “Who was it that
spoke to him?” 3. The persons or things that may be the cause
of any effect or event, and when the nominative to a verb applies
to persons and things; as, “It was I.” “It was thou.” “It
was he who did it.” “It rains.” “It is cold.” “It is them.”
“It is the queen.” “It is I, be not afraid.”
ILLUSTRATIONs on THE NoTE.—“It rains;” that is, the state
of the atmosphere is such as to produce rain. “It is a frosty
morning;” that is, the state of the morning is such, that it (the
morning) is frosty.” 2. “It has happened fortunately.” “It” refers
to something which is the subject of the thing happened. 3. “It
was he that hurt him;” that is, he was the person who caused the
hurt, or he effected the hurt.”
OBSERVATIONs.—l. “It is and “it was" are often used in a
plural construction, to express the persons or things which may
be the cause of any effect or event; as, “It is they that come
in late.” “It was the scholars who gave them.” But when the
cause of any event or effect is not implied, this mode of expres
sion is not employed; thus, “It is true his assertions, though
they are paradoxical;” should be, his assertions are true, though
they are paradoxical.”
1. The word there, is under the same influence. Both words
(it and there) are most frequently employed in the anomalous
manner, in combination with the verb to be; as, “It was I that
did it.” “It is shameful.” There are many men injured by this.”
“There is no objection to that.”
ILLUSTRATIONs on THE RULE.—“I and he.” Now, he is the
third person, and I is the first. According to rule, “I” should
be last.
STUDENT.—Where should the second person be placed ? Before
the third. Tell me all the second persons singular and plural.
Where should the first person be placed ? The last. Mention all
the second personal pronouns, singular and plural. Repeat the
first persons singular and plural.
VIoLATIONs.—1. I and thou must go together. 2. He and thou
must do it. 3. I or you must write a letter. 4. He and thou
must pronounce it. 5. I and he told the same story. 6. He and
you were busy. 7. I and he have been consulting the biographical
chart. 8. I and you have not written our exercises. 9. It is
remarkable, his continual endeavours to serve us, notwithstanding
our ingratitude.
RULE 18. It is improper to use both a noun and its
pronoun as a nominative to the same verb; as, “The
king, he is just.” “The men they were there;” should
be, “The king is just.” “The men were there.”
Also, it is improper to use both a noun and its pronoun
as an objective AFTER the same verb; thus, “All that
was committed to thy servants, they do it.” IT should
be omitted,—all is the objective after do. (See 2 Chro
nicles 34 c., 16 v.)
SYNTAX. 113
ILLUSTRATIONS AND QUESTIons.—What are you to notice first?
A noun and its pronoun. What are you to do in every sentence?
To omit the pronoun. Can a noun and a pronoun be used to the
same nominative? Can you use a noun and a pronoun as the
object, after the same verb? No. Whether should you omit the
noun or pronoun? The pronoun.
“The books they are thine.” Which is the noun? Books.
What is a noun? Which is the pronoun? They. To what verb
are books and they the nominative? To are. Which should be
omitted ? They.
Violations.—1. My banks they are furnished with bees. 2.
For he bringeth down them that dwell on high; the lofty city he
layeth it low. 3. Simple and innocent pleasure they alone are
durable. 4. Many words they darken speech. 5. Who instead
of going about doing good, they are perpetually intent upondoing
mischief. 6. The boy he is good. 7. Disappointments and afflic
tions, however disagreeable, they often improve us. 8. These
pictures they are sold. 9. Which rule, if it had been observed, a
neighbouring prince would have wanted a great deal of that
incense which has been offered to him. 10. Man, though he has
a great variety of thoughts, and such from which others, as well
as himself, might receive profit and delight, yet they areall within
his own breast. 1 1. I saw her the queen. 12. I will flog him
his back.
RULE 19.—Every adjective has a noun expressed or
understood, with which it must agree in number; as,
“This kind of knives.” “These kind of knives” “This
**
man.” “These men."
ILLUSTRATIONs.—“He is a good as well as a wise man;" that
is, “He is a good man, as well as a wise man.” In the sentence
“Man” isunderstood afterthe first adjective “good,” and we use the
singular “a.” “Few are happy," i.e. persons, understood in the
plural, to agree with the plural adjective FEw.
STUDENT.—What is an adjective? For what do you look first?
Ans. For the noun, expressed or understood? With what must
the adjective agree? With the moun. What do you mean by
agree.
WIoLATIONs.—1. These kind of indulgences soften and injure
the mind. 2. Instead of improving yourselves, you have been
playing these two hours. 3. Those sort of favours did real injury
under the appearance of kindness. 4. The chasm made by the
earthquake was twenty foot broad, and one hundred fathom in
depth. 5. How many a sorrow should we avoid, if we were not
industrious to make them. 6. I have not seen him this ten days.
7. There is six foot water in the hold. 8. Those solt of plants
is fragrant.
RULE 20--The phrases THIS MEANs and THAT MEANs,
should be used when they refer to one thing or word;
THESE MEANs and THOSE MEANs when thev refer to
114 ENGLISH GRAMMAR.
plurals; as, “He was diligent, and by this means he
became learned.” “He was also industrious and frugal,
and by these means he became rich.”
STUDENT.—What is a phrase? What do you mean by singular?
What do you mean by plural? What is the first thing this rule
teaches you? To use this means and that means when they refer
to one thing or word. What is the second? To use these means
and those means when they refer to plurals.
NoTE.—Amends is used in the same way as means; as, “Peace
of mind is a honourable amends for the sacrifice of interest.”
2. The phrase “a mean” is used in the singular only, to denote
mediocrity, moderation, medium or middle state; as, “This is a
mean between the two extremes.”
VIoIATIONs.–1. He lived temperately, and by these means pre
served his health. 2. Charles was extravagant and by this mean
became poor and despicable. 3. It was by thatungenerous mean
that he otained his end. 4. Industry is the mean of obtaining
competency. 5. Though a promising measure, it is a means
which I cannot adopt. 6. This person embraced every oppor.
tunity to display his talants, and by these means rendered himself
ridiculous. 7. Joseph was industrious, frugal, and discreet; and
by this means obtained property and reputation.
RULE 21.—When two objects are compared, the com
parative must be used; but, when more than two, the
superlative must be used; as, “She is stronger of the
two, and is the happiest of her sisters.”
The comparative and the word other are followed by
than when opposition is intended; and by of when selec
tion is implied.
ILLUSTRATIONS AND EXPLANATORY REMARKS.
The comparative degree is used when the things compared
belong to different classes; as, “The English are braver than the
French.” In this case the comparative is followed by than. The
use of the word other after the comparative confines the persons
or objects to the same class; thus, when I say, “Socrates was
wiser than any other Athenian;” I mean Socrates was an Athe
nian. But were I to say, “Socrates was wiser than any
Athenian;" it would imply that Socrates was not an Athenian;
but was wiser than the Athenians. The word other must always
be followed by than.
The superlative always compares one or more objects with others
of the same class, and in these cases the word other is not used;
thus instead of saying, “Cicero, of all other Romans was the most
elloquent;” we should say, “Cicero was the most eloquent of the
Romans;” that is, out of the whole class of Romans.
STUDENT.—What does the positive degree express? What does
the comparative degree express? When is the comparative em
ployed? What does the superlative express? What does the
superlative compare? See page 18. Compare lesson 7th, p. 24,
SYNTAX. - 115
What does the first part of the rule teach you? Ans. Two objects
compared. What degree are you to use? The comparative.
What does the second part teach you? What words does than
follow 2 When is of used?
WIoLATIONs,—1. Wisdom is better nor health. 2. Africanus
was the greatest of the two Scipios. 3. He is the tallest of the
two. 4. The opposite scale is the heaviest. 5. When two verbs
come together, the last must be put in the infinitive mood. 6.
Of the three, John is the more learned. 7. William, Jabez, and
James, came together; the latter seems to be in ill health. 8. I
understood him the least of all others who spoke. 9. She is the
most amiable of all her sisters. 10. He is the best of any man
I know. 11. He, of all others made the greatest figure. 12. Of
all his brothers he has the most talent.
RULE 22.—Double comparatives and double superla
tives must not be used; as, “A worser conduct.” “A
more severer temper.” “The most happiest number.”
Should be, “A worse conduct.” “A more serene tem
per.” “The most happy number; or, the happiest
number.”
ILLUSTRATIONs.—“Don is the most swiftest dog.” Tell the
adjective. Most and swiftest. What degree? How do you cor
rect this error? By omitting most. Could you not omit est at
the end of swift? No. Why? Because swift is a word of one
syllable, and must be compared by adding est,
STUDENT.—What are the two things to be noticed? Double
comparatives and double superlatives. What must you not do?
I must not use them. How is the comparative formed? How is
the superlative formed? Then you are to omit one of the com
paratives if there are two; also one of the superlatives if there
are two together. -
CAUTIONs—You should not be profuse in the use of the super
lative degree; avoid strong expressions, the too frequent use of
which betrays the inexperienced writer, and the feeble thinker,
instead of giving additional force and energy to a description.
Never use such words as shocking, horrible, atrocious, diabolical,
scandalous, &c., in speaking or writing on trivial and unimportant
matters.
Justin Brenan observes—“Unpractised writers deal out praise
with shameless profusion, and thus make themselves the sport
of the more sensible and discerning. They give us abundance of
most judicious, most kind, excessively humane, uncommonly good,
kindhearted, quintessence of perfection, elegant, beautiful, mild, sweet,
delightful, charming, fine, and every thing that can mark encomium
high.” This author further observes—“This propensity betrays
itself in conversation also, for, with these indiscriminate praisers,
a girl is beautiful, and so is boiled mutton at dinner—soup is
elegant, a pig's face charming, and a cod's head delightful.”
Viola.TIONS.-1. He sometimes claims admission to the chiefest
offices. 2. The tongue is like a race-horse, which runs faster the

lesser weight it carries. 3. The Supreme Being is the wisest,
the most powerfulest, and the most best of being. 4. The night
ingale's voice is the sweetest in the grove. 5. James is a worser
scholar than John. 6. Absalom was the most beautifulest man.
7. It is more easier to build two chimmies than to maintain one.
8. It was more warmer yesterday. 9. A more yellower flower.
10. The most strongest man. 11. This is a splendider apart
ment than the other. 12. The prettiest but not the happiest
of the two.
RULE 23.—Adjectives which in their simple form
imply the highest or lowest degree, do not admit the
comparative or superlative form; such as, chief, perfect,
true, universal, supreme, consumate, extreme, prior,
false, eaterior, superior, ulterior, &c.
CAUTIONs.—Instead of more or most universal, say more exten
sive, or most extensive. Universal imports over all, and nothing
can be more than over all the universe. “His tale was most
false;” say, evidently false. Never use more or most perfect.
STUDENT.—What do you notice first? Adjectives which in
their simple form, &c. (See page 19, No. 22; also, page 22,
exercises.)
Violations.—l. His work was more perfect than his brother's.
2. That expression is more untrue than the other. 3. It was
situated on the extremest point of the land. 4. He was the
chiefest of ten thousand. 5. The house is quite full. 6. That
opinion is too universal to be rejected. 7. Virtue confers the
most supreme dignity on man; and should be his chiefest aim.
8. His assertion was more true than that of his opponent; nay
the latter words were most true. 9. His work is perfect; his
brother's more perfect; and his father's the most perfect ofall.
10. He gave the fullest and most sincere proof of the truest
friendship.
RULE 24.—When two persons or things are con
trasted; also, when two things have been mentioned and
you have occasion to mention them again; THAT refers
to the former or more remote mentioned, and THIs to the
latter or nearer; as, “Knowledge and wisdom are very
different; this enables us to do what is right, that to know
what is right.”
FoRMER and LATTER are often used in the plural
instead of that and this, they are alike in both numbers.
OBSERVE.—Former and latter are applied to both persons and
things. This and that should not be applied to persons.
ILLUSTRATIONs.—“Virtue and vice are opposite; that (namely
virtue) enobles the mind; this (namely vice) debases the mind.”
“Newton and Aristotle were men of high renoun; the former for
his astronomical knowledge; the latter for his metaphysics.” In
this sentence we could not use that and this; because the sentence
refers to persons; but we can say former and latter.
SYNTAX. 117
STUDENT.—What part of speech is this and that; former and
latter? To what do this and that apply? To what do former and
latter apply? To both persons and things. What do you notice
first? Two persons, or things contrasted. What do you mean by
contrast? Two objects of opposite qualities; as, “Light and
dark.” What do you notice second? The words this and that.
To which does this relate? To what does that relate? Which
number do this and that denote? To which number do former
and latter apply? To both. (See p. 19, No. 26; also page 20,
No. 27.)
WIOLATIONs.—Wealth and poverty are both temptations; this
tends to excite pride, that discontentment. Moses and Soloman
were men of the highest renoun; the latter was remarkable for
his meekness, the former was renound for his wisdom. Body and
soul must part; the former winds its way to the almighty source,
the latter drops into the dark and noisome grave. Religion raises
men above themselves; irreligion sinks them beneath the brutes;
that binds them down to a poor pitiable speck of perishable earth,
this exalts them to the skies. And the cloud came between the
camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel, and it was a cloud
and darkness to them, but it gave light to these. I have always
prefered cheerfulness to mirth, the former I consider as an act,
the latter as a habit of the mind. Rex and Tyrannus are of very
different characters; the one rules his people by laws to which
they consent; the other, by his absolute power: this is called
freedom, that tyranny.
RULE 25.—Adjectives should not be used as adverbs,
nor adverbs as adjectives. An adjective must be used
when the quality of a noun, expressed or implied, is indi
cated; but an adverb must be used, when the degree,
manner, time, of an adjective, a verb, or an adverb, is
implied. And further, adverbs qualify adjectives and
verbs. Adjectives qualify nouns.
ILLUSTRATIONS.–In the following phrases adjectives are im
properly used for adverbs: “Miserable poor;” “ Indifferent
honest;” “Eacellent well.” They should be, miserably, indiffer
ently, and excellently; because these words are placed before
adjectives; and adverbs qualify adjectives.
The following phrases contain adverbs improperly used for
adjectives:—“Their manner of living was agreeably to their rank
and station.” Agreeable; because it qualifies the nouns rank and
station; that is, their manner of living was agreeable. “He must
not expect to find study agreeable always” should be always
agreeable.
DIFFERENT POSITIONS OF THE ADJECTIVES
The adjective is generally placed immediately before its noun;
as, “A glorious prospect.” There are exceptions to this rule,
and this order is inverted:—l. When one or more words are
*
118 ENGLISH GRAMMAR.
dependent on the adjectives; as “Knowledge is requisite for a
statesman.” 2. When the adjective is emphatical, or is used as
a title; as, “Alfred the Great.” 3. When several adjectives
belong to a single noun, they may either precede or follow the
moun—(they generally follow); as, “A learned, wise, and amiable
man;” or, “A man, learned, wise and amiable.” OBSERVE.—
The longest adjective should be placed last. 4. When the adjec
tive is preceded by an adverb; as, “A man conscientiously exact.”
5. The verb to be often separates the noun from its adjective; as,
“Gaming is ruinous.” 6. When the adjective expresses some
circumstance of a noun, placed after transitive verbs; as, “Vanity
often renders a man despicable.” 7. In an exclamatory or emphatic
sentence, the adjective generally precedes the noun; as, “Great
is our God.” Sometimes the word all is emphatically put after a
number of particulars comprehended under it; as, “Ambition,
honour, interest, all concerned.”
STUDENT.—What is an adjective? What is an adverb? For
what should not an adverb be used? Where should an adjective
be placed? When may an adverb be used? What do adverbs
qualify? What do adjectives qualify? When may an adjective
be use ? When the adjective is emphatic, where is it placed?
Where is the word all put? When two adjectives come together,
which is placed last? Tell me all you know on the position of
the adjectives.
VIoI.ATIONs.—They lived conformable to the rules of prudence.
He acted agreeable to his instructions. She reads proper, writes
very neat, and composes accurate. His manner of living was
singular absurd. He came agreeable to his promise, and con
ducted himself suitable to the occasion. Three month's notice is
required to be given previous to a pupil's leaving the school. He
behaved himself submissive, and was exceeding careful not togive
offence. They hoped for a soon and prosperous issue to the war.
I intend, conformable to my plan, to suggest a few hints. He is
a person of great abilities, and exceeding upright, and is like to
be a very useful member of the community.
RULE 26.—FROM should not be used before hence,
thence, and whence, whenever it can be done without
occasioning stiffness.
2. After verbs of motion, hither, thither, and whither
should be used instead of here, there, and where, on
solemn occasions.
3. When, there, and while should not be used for
nouns: where, when no reference to place is intended,
must not be used for a relative and a preposition.
ILLUSTRATIONs.—1. “From hence” should be, “hence,” because
“hence” signifies from this place. 2. “Where are you going"
should be, “Whither are, &c.” “Come here" should be, “come
hither.” 3. “Since when” should be, “sincewhich time;” because
SYNTAX. 119
when must not be used for a noun-time. “Since then” ought to
be, “since that time.” “Tell me where it happened ” Here is
reference to place and should be, “Tell me in which place it
happened.”
STUDENT.—What part of speech are hence, thence, and whence?
(See page 74, No. 10.) What do they imply? From this place,
from that place, from which place. Why should not from be used
before these words? Because it is implied. What part of speech
are hither, thither, and whither? (See page 74, No. 10.) When
should not these words be used? What do you mean by verbs of
motion? What part of speech are when, then, and while? What
does where denote? (See page 74, No. 14.) When must not
when, then, while, and where not be used?
WIoLATIONs.—1. He departed from thence into a desert place.
2. From whence come ye? 3. From hence arose all that confu
sion. 4. He drew up a petition, where he too freely represented
his own merits. 5. Where are you going? 6. He left the semi
nary too early, since when he has made little improvement. 7.
We walked there in an hour. 8. His follies had reduced him to
a situation where he had much to fear and nothing to hope. 9.
He went to London last year, since when I have not seen him.
10. Nothing is better worth the while of young persons, than the
acquisition of knowledge and virtue. 11. It is not worth his while.
12. Some of my then hearers prevailed upon me to publish these
lectures. 13 George is active; he walked there inless than an hour.
RULE 27.—Adverbs are, for the mostpart, placed before
adjectives, after verbs active-transitive or neuter, and fre
quently between the auxiliary and the verb; as, “He is
very attentive.” “She behaves well, and is much
esteemed.
ILLUSTRATIONS AND EXPLANATIONS.
l. The adverb is placed before the adjective; as, “A truly good
grammarian.” 2. After a single verb, and after the objective of a
transitive verb; as, “She walks gently.” “He loves him sin
cerely.” Sometimes, it precedes the verb; as, “Men often deceive
themselves.” 3. When there are two auxiliaries, it is placed either
between them or after both; as, “He might easily have done it.”
“He should have earnestly urged it upon him.” When anything
emphatical is intended, it precedes the auxiliaries; as, “Certainly
you must have known.” 4. The adverb is generally placed after
passive verbs; as, “He has been severely reproved.” Adverbs of
time either before or after the second auxiliary. (See page 73, No. 4.)
5. Not, when it qualifies the present participle comes after it; in
other situations, it comes before the participle. 6. When there
are several adverbs and several auxiliaries to the same verb, the
adverbs must be intermixed with the auxiliaries.
7. Never generally precedes the verb except be; as, “I never
saw him.” But it may either be placed before or after the auxi
liary. Never must not be used for ever; thus, “If I make my
hands never so clean,” should be, “Ever so clean.”
120 ENGLISH GRAMMAR.
The chief point to study is, that the adverb may be so situated
as to qualify the word which it is intended to qualify, and that
word only. Perspicuity is the grand object.
RULE 1. The adverb only must always be placed as
to convey the meaning intended; therefore, it may be
placed either before or after the word which it modifies;
as, “He only was poor;” I mean he was the only person
that was poor. If I say, “He was only poor," I mean,
that he was poor, and nothing else.
RULE 2.—The adverb enough must be placed after
the adjective which it qualifies, and both the adjective and
adverb after the noun; as, “A book large enough.”
OBSERVE.—I have been as explicit and perspicuous as possible
in defining and expounding this rule, notwithstanding there are
other precautions to be made. Becautious how you place the
adverb Not onLY, and NoT MERELY; leteasy flow, and perspicuity
of the phrases be chiefly regarded.
STUDENT.—What is an adverb? Where should itbe placed? For
the most part, &c. Is the adverb placed before the adjective?
What is an adjective? What is an active-transitive verb 2 What
is an auxiliary verb? (See page 36, No. 12.) Repeat them. Where
is the adverb placed when there are two auxiliaries? Where is
the adverb placed when anything emphatical is implied? How
is the adverb placed with passive verbs? How with adverbs of
time? How is not placed ? How do you place the adverb when
it is connected with several auxiliaries? How is never generally
placed? For what must never be used? What is the chief point
to study in reference to the placing of the adverbs? Where should
the adverb only be placed? Where should enough be placed?
VIoLATIONs—l. These things should be never separated. 2. It
may have been recieved thankfully. 3. William nobly acted,
though he was unsuccessful. 4. The heavenly bodies are in
motion perpetually. 5. He sweetly sings, he charmingly converses,
he prudently conducts himself, on all occasions. 6. He might
have at least civilly requested it. 7. Ask me never so much
dowry. 8. He spoke in a distinct enough manner to be heard
by the whole assembly. 9. He gave him a large enough number.
10. I saw three persons only. Il. If some persons' opportuni
ties were never so favourable, they would be too indolent to
improve them. 12. A God verily there is that judgeth
the earth. 13. We should not be overcome totally by present
events. 14. He impertinently behaved to his master. 15. He
unaffectedly and forcibly spoke, and was heard attentively by the
whole assembly. 16. They were permitted never to assemble in
large numbers. 17. A sovereign was never so much beloved by
the people. 18. He was determined to invite back the king, and
to call together his friends. 19. It is impossible continually to
be at work. 20. The women contributed all their rings andjewels
voluntarily, to assist the government. 21. Having not known,
SYNTAX. 12]
or having not considered the measures proposed, he failed of suc
cess. 22. In the proper position of adverbs, the ear carefully
requires to be consulted as well as the sense. -
RULE 28.—Two negatives in the same sentence should
not be used, when negation is intended; thus “I cannot
drink no more wine;” should be “I can drink no more
wine;” or, “I cannot drink any more wine.”
CAUTIONs.—Hiley. Lennie, Pinnock, and Murray, say, “Two
negatives are equivalent to an affirmative; as, “Nor did they not
perceive him;” that is, “They did perceive him.” Here is com
plete nonsense. How can two denials be equivalent to an affirma
tive? Exactly as two lies are equal to truth. If we are allowed to
use two negatives, or one negative as we think proper; why give
a rule at all? If I wish to affirm the above assertion, I should
say, “They did perceive him.” If I wish to negative the above
assertion, I should say, “They did not perceive him.” This is
according to the grammatical construction of the sentence. It is
better to express an affirmation, by a regular affimative, than ob
scure the sentence by two separate negatives.
QUESTIONS AND ILLUSTRATIONs.—What do you mean by nega
tive? A denial. What is meant by negation ? Denial. Repeat
the adverbs of negation. No, not, nay, not at all, nothing, never,
neither, &c. What do you notice first? Two negatives. What
should you do with them? Omit one; for two in the same clause
ofa sentence are improper. Example.—“He cannot do nothing.”
Which are the two negatives? Not and no. Correct the sentence.
“He can do nothing.” What have you done? Cast the not out.
Can you express the sentence any other way? Yes, I can say
“He cannot do anything.”
WIoIATIONs.—1. He will not, by no means, act as they advise
him. 2. We have not done nothing to-day. 3. Neither precept
nor discipline is not so forcible as example, 4. So tranquil was
he, so armed in conscious virtue, so sustained by the noblest re
ligious principles, that no adverse occurrence, no change of fortune
never disturbed him. 5. He will never be no taller. 6. Be honest,
nor take no shape nor resemblance of disguise. 7. They could
not no farther. 8. We need not, nor do not confine his operations
to narrow limits. 9. Covet neither riches nor honours, nor no
such perishing things. 10. I cannot comply with the proposal,
neither at present, nor at any other time. I 1. Nothing never
affected her so much. 12. There cannot be nothing more insig
nificant than vanity. 13. I am resolved not to do it never at no
time. 14. These people do not judge wisely, nor take no proper
measures to effect their purpose. 15. The measure is so excep
tionable, that we cannot by no means permit it. 16. The king
nor the queen were not at all deceived in the business.

perienced and older than she. 19. That is a very unpretending
and useful little volume. 20. He acted agreeable to his
instructions.
RULE 29.—When two nouns, or a noun and a pronoun
come together, signifying different things, the former is
put in the possessive; as, “My father's house.” “John's
book.”
When the thing possessed is obvious, it is usually
omitted; as, “I went to the draper's;” that is, to “the
draper's shop.”
Two nouns coming together, and signifying the same
thing, are put in the same case; as, “ Victoria the
queen.”
STUDENT.—What is a noun? How is the possessive formed?
How many cases have nouns? Name them. How is the posses
sive plural formed when it ends in s? What do you notice first?
What do you notice second? In what case must the first be?
When the thing possessed is obvious, what do you do? What do
you do when two nouns come together signifying the same thing?
ILLUSTRATIONS.—lst. “Roberts hat.” Here are two nouns to
gether, and the first, according to rule, should be put in the pos
sessive; thus “Robert's hat.” 2nd. “I have been at St. Pauls.”
Here the second noun is obvious, meaning “ St. Paul's church.”
3rd. “The city of London.” These two nouns signify the same
place, therefore they are put in the same case.
WIoLATIONs.—1. The kings picture. 2. A ladys fan. 3. Virtues
reward. 4. The mens gloves. 5. Childrens toys. 6. A mans

16. Jesus feet. 17. Moses rod. 18. He is gone to the booksellers.
19. We have been at St. James. 20. Religion the support of
adversity. 21. Cicero the orator.
NoTEs.—1st. Nouns are always of the third person, except
when they are employed to name the person addressed; in which
case they are of the second person; as. “Our Father who art in
heaven.”
2nd. The possessive its is often improperly used for “it is;”
as, “Its my book,” instead of “It is my book.” You must use
neither “tis nor its,” but “it is.” (See Observations, page 112.)
3rd. Two proper nouns forming one name, or a name and title;
or, several persons of one name, the plural form is annexed to the
last;Pas, “Miss Bells;” “Mr. Thompsons.” When speaking of
them in a particular manner, we say, “The Miss Bells,” or
* The two Miss Bells.”
4th. In composition, and in addressing letters to several per
sons of one name, or of one firm, we pluralize the title; as, “To
Misses Bush;” “To Messrs. (for Messieurs, French) Greaves.”
RULE 30.—When several possessive nouns come
together, the apostrophe and s are annexed to the last
and understood to the rest; as, “John and James's
book.”
ILLUSTRATIONs.—“David and Jonathan's friendship.” Here
friendship is equally applicable to David and Jonathan; therefore
the latter only has the sign of the possessive.
STUDENT.—What do you notice 1st? Several possessive nouns
coming together. Which is put in the possessive 2 The last.
REMARK.—The thing possessed belongs jointly to the individ

VIoLATIONs.—1. Johns and Eliza books. 2 This was my
father's, mother's, and uncle's advice. 3. Peter's, John's, and
Andrew's occupation was that of fishermen. 4. He asked his
fathers as well as his mother's advice. 5. It was the men's,
women's, and children's lot to suffer great calamities.
RULE 31.—The sign of the possessive should be
annexed to each noun; 1st. When a particular empha
sis is to be laid ; as, “They are John's as well as Eliza's
books.” 2nd. When several words intervene; and when
comparison is made; as, “ This not only gained the
king's but the people's approbation.”
ILLUSTRATIONs.—Emphasis is laid on the nouns of the follow.
ing sentence, and according to rule the possessive must be annexed
to each; thus, “He had the physician's, the surgeon's, and the
apothecary's assistance.
2. Several words intervene in this sentence—“Thy ancestor's
virtue and character is not thine.

STUDENT.—What are you to notice first? The sign of the pos.
sessive. The second 2 To see if there is an emphasis placed

VIoLATIONs.—1. Not a day nor an hour's unnecessary delay.
2. The emperors and the kings forces. 3. He took refuge at the
governors the kings representative. 4. Not only the counsel and
attorneys, but the judge opinion also favoured his cause. 5. The
judge and the jury's sentiments are often at variance.
RULE 32.—When a name or title consists of two or
three terms, the sign of the possessive is annexed to the
last, whether the governing noun is expressed or implied;
as, “TheDuke of Wellington the general's tent.”
REMARKs.—When the governing noun is expressed the 's is an:
nexed to the office or profession, as in the above sentence, where
general is the office. In those cases, in which several terms are
applied to the same individual it is better to use of rather than s.
STUDENT.—What is the first point? Sentences which contain
names or titles of two or three terms. To which is the 's added?
To the last. When the governing noun is expressed, to which is
the 's annexed ? To the office.
ILLUSTRATIONs.—He called upon Mr. Newton, the chemist and
druggist's shop. Here the governing noun shop is expressed, and
therefore the noun druggist has the 's annexed.
VIoIATIONs.—1. Paul the apostle advice. 2. Alfred the Greats
palace. 3. Henry the eighth reign. 4. This is the Grand Sul.
tan's Mahomet's palace. 5. The Bishop's of Landaff excellent
work. 6. The Lord Mayor's of London authority. 7. The cap
tain of the guard's house. 8. I will not do it for David's thy
father's sake. 9. Give me John the Baptist head.
RULE 33.—When one or more explanatory terms, |
which signify office or possession, are added to a name,
the apostrophe and s are added to the name only, when
the governing noun is understood; as, “I left the bottle
at Mr. Newton's, the chemist and druggist; here, the
governing noun shop is understood, and, therefore, not
the possession druggist; but the name Newton must
have the 's added; thus, “Newton's.”
ILLUSTRATIONs.—I called at Mr. Greaves's, the printer, book
seller, and stationer. The silk was purchased at Brown's, the
mercer and haberdasher. In both these cases, shop is understood,
and therefore the apostrophe and s are added to the name only.
SYNTAX. 125
WIOLATIONS.-1. These psalms are David, the king, priest, and
prophet. 2. This is Dr. Watson, the bishop of Landaff's. 3. He
emulated Caesar's the great. 4. We staid a week at Lord Grosvenor
the president's. 5. I reside at Lord Littleton, the ornament
of his country.
NoTE RULEs.—1. In some cases, the word of is used
instead of the apostrophe and s; as, “Thehill ofscience”
for “Science's Hill.”
The following sentences are better expressed by of,
with the coming before the noun. -
EXERCISEs.—Correct the succeeding sentences:–1. Socrates's
wisdom. 2. In the armies' name. 3. Lord's house. 4. Com
mon'shouse. 5. Sheffield's trade. 6. England's queen. 7. Spain's
king. 8. Gold's crown. 9, War's horrors. 10. London's Lord
Mayor. (See Observations and Exercises, page 14.) When of would
destroy the sense, it should not be used instead of the 's. In the
following and similar sentences, we must use the 's rather than
of:—The book of John. The bonnet of Amelia. The wine of
Adam. The parasol of Jane.
RULE 2.—Qf, joined to a noun, is equal to the pos
sessive case only, when the expression can be turned into
the possessive without altering the meaning; thus, a cup
of ale cannot be turned into ale's cup; nor a crown of
gold into gold's crown.
RULE 3.—In some instances, the word following of
has the 's; in these cases, plurality is denoted; as,
“A horse of my friend's,” signifies, that is a horse that
belongs to my friend. A picture of my uncle's indicates,
this is one out of several. Sometimes, the sentences
might be better expressed by using one; as, this is one
of my uncle's pictures.
If there is only one subject possessed, the word immediately
following of is in the objective case, without the possessive sign;
as, “This picture of my friend,” meaning a likeness of him. That
is your friend's house; but not, that is the house of yourfriend's,
when only one house is intended.

three books, (severally) areJohn, Thomas,and William's. 15. The
Misses Clayton are come. 16. The house was Joseph's and
Robert's property. 17. The letter was addressed to Miss Johnsons.
RULE 34.—The relative pronoun is of the same num
ber, gender, and person as the antecedent, and the verb
agrees with it accordingly; as, “Thou who lovest wis
dom.” “The men who officiated were very kind.”
NoTE RULEs.–1. Who is applied to persons; which
to both things and persons, when asking questions. (See
page 28th, No. 10.)
2 The relative must be put in the objective case when
it is the object of a verb or preposition; as, “He whom
we serve is eternal.”
3. That is used instead of who or which, 1st, after
adjectives in the superlative degree—after the words
sAME and ALL, and after some and any. 2nd. When
the antecedent consists of two nouns, the one requiring
who.and the other which ; as, “The man and the horse
that we saw yesterday.” 3rd. After the interrogative
who ; as, “Who that has common sense will believe it P”
4th. That is also used when persons form only part of
the antecedent; as, “The men and things that he has
studied have not improved his morals.” 5th. When the
antecedent of the pronoun is a clause or part ofa sentence,
the pronoun is put in the neuter gender, singular number,
and third person; as, “It grieves me to hear of your
illness.” “She was over-indulgent to her children, which
is a sin.”
ILLUSTRATIONs.—In the sentence, “Thou who lovest wisdom,”
the pronoun thou is the antecedent in the singular number, and of
the second person; and, therefore, who, the relative, must be in
the same number and person, to agree with it, and the verb lovest
agrees also with the relative, as its nominative. In the sentence,
“The men who officiated were very kind,” the antecedent, men,
is in the plural number, and of the third person, (as being spoken
of;) and who must be in the same number and person, to agree
with it.
OBSERVE.—The relative does not agree with it in case; the ante
cedent may be in one case, while the relative may, according to
circumstances be in another. -
STUDENT.—Name the first point. The relative. What the
second? Its antecedent. Having found these two points, what i.

ance? 9. Who of those boys reads the best? 10. The horse
who I saw run for the cup. 11. Who of you did that?
QUESTIONS AND EXAMINATIONS ON THE -
- THIRD NOTE RULE.
Name the first point. The relative that. You will not find a
“that” in every sentence. You are to turn who or which into THAT.
Repeat the whole rule. Now, you see you are to use THAT, first
after the superlative degree; also, after same and all; second, after
two antecedents, the one requiring who, the other which ; and 3rd,
the interrogative who. Now, when you get any of these words in
a sentence, throw out the who, which, or whom, and put THAT in
its place.
ILLUSTRATIONs.—“The boy is the best who repeated his lesson
first.” Who should be THAT, because that is used instead of who,
after adjectives in the superlative degree.
“The man and the dog which we saw.”
Which should be that, because man requires who, and the dog
which, according to rule, which says, “THAT is used instead of
who or which, &c.” The relative that is applicable to both man
and dog. -
WIoLATIONs.—1. It is the same picture which you saw before.
2. Who of these came to his assistance. 3. He is the best scholar
which I ever saw. 4. It is richer than any which you gave me.
5. All these men who fought for their king. 6. The master and
the books which I received. 7. And all which beauty, all which
wealth e'er gave, &c. 8. Some village, Hampden, which with
dauntless breast, &c. 9. This is the same pen which I had
yesterday.
4. The relative must be in the possessive case, when it
denotes the possessor, as, “He, whose creatures we are
is Almighty.” Here, whose is in the possessive, because
it signifies the possessor.
5. Who is not applied to collective nouns, signifying
unity of idea, though they imply persons; thus, “The
court who,” “The cavalry who.” “This generation
who,” In all these, and similar cases, who should be
t
128 ENGLISH GRAMMAR.
wHICH. When plurality of idea is implied, the relative
who is employed for the nominative, and whom for the
objective.
6. Which is applied to infants, to irrational animals,
and to inanimate things; as, “The child which I saw.”
If the proper name of the child is mentioned, then who
must be used; as, “The child James, who, &c. “The
book which was torn.” “The bird which was shot.”
7. Whose is applied to both persons and things; as,
“The man whose condition.” “The pleasure whose
nature.” “Locke, whose name.”
8. Who must never be used for whose and its governing
nourt; thus, “It is no wonder if such a man did not
shine at the court ofqueen Elizabeth, who was but another
name for prudence and economy; should be, “Whose
name was but another word, &c."
RULE 35.—The word whAT must not be used for
that, nor the word THAT for what; thus, “We speak
that we do know, and testify that we have seen,” should
be, “We speak what we do know, and testify what we
have seen.”
REMARKs.—When what can be turned into those which, or the
thing which, it must be used; in other situations, that must be
used. (See relative pronouns, pages 27 and 28.)
ILLUSTRATIONs.—“They would not believe but what I was the
guilty person.” Here, what cannot be turned into the thing which,
therefore, what should be that; as, “They would not believe but
THAT, &c. “We speak that we do know, and testify that we have
seen, &c.” Here “that” is improperly placed, for it can be turned
into the thing which ;” thus, “We speak (the thing which or) what
we do know, and testify (the thing which, or) whatwe have seen."
VIoLATIONs.—1. They will not but believe what I have been
to blame. 2. He is the same inan what we saw before. 3. Who
what has any sense of religion would have argued thus. 4. The
estate what became his portion. 5. This is that thing which I
wanted. 6. All fevers, except that, are called nervous.
RULE 36.—Whoever, whichever, and whatever should
be used instead of whosoever, whichsoever, and whatso
ever, except in scriptural language.
These words are often divided by the interposition of
the corresponding word; thus, “On whichsoever side
the king cast his eyes” should be, on which side soever,
Howsoever should always be divided. IIe that, should
always be used instead of whoso.
SYNTAX. 129
STUDENT.—Name the first point in this rule. Whoever, &c.
What are you to do with them? We should use them instead of
whosoever, &c. Are these words ever divided? Yes, they are
divided by the interposition, &c. What is the next? To always
divide howsoever. The next point? To use he that instead of
whoso.
ILLUSTRATIONs.—“Howsoever beautiful they appear.” How
soever being divided, the sentence reads thus:—How beautiful
soever they appear. “On whichsoever side he looked,” would
sound better if written, “On which side soever he looked.”
“Whoso keepeth his fig-tree” should be, “He that keepeth,” &c.
REMARKs.—The above words should never be altered in scrip
tural language. Whoever, whatever, and however cannot be divided;
we properly say, “Whoever committeth sin, isthe servant of sin.”
Whatever he does he does well. However great he may be."
WIoIATIONs.—l. On whatsoever side they are contemplated.
2. Howsoever beautiful they appear. 3. Whoso keepeth the fig
tree. 4. Whosoever told him, it is false. 5. In whatsoever light
we view him. 6. Whosoever neglects religion will repent of his
folly. 7. Do whatsoever I command you. 8. Whichsoever he
takes. 9. Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry ofthe poor. 10. Whoso
keepeth his mouth and his tongue, keepeth his soul from troubles.
RULE 37.—When the relative is preceded by two an
tecedents of different persons, the relative and verb
generally agree in person with the latter, and to prevent
ambiguity, the relative ought to be placed next its ante
cedent; as, “I am the man who commands you. “The
master who punished the boy for idleness, never chastises
without a reason,” should be, “The master who never
chastises, &c.” -
NoTE.—When we address the Deity, and in scriptural language,
the relative is made to agree with the former antecedent; as,
“Thou art the Lord, who seest us in all our ways.”
STUDENT.—What is the first thing to be noticed? The relative.
The second? The two antecedents of different persons. How
many persons are there in grammar? Three; first, second, and
third. Name them. (See pages 13 and 25. No. 7.) What is the
fourth? To place the relative next its antecedent. Why? To
prevent ambiguity. In scriptural language, with which antecedent
should the relative agree? With the former.
ILLUSTRATIONs.—“The king dismissed his minister without
any inquiry, who had never before commited so unjust an action.”
We are uncertain whether it was the king or the minister who
committed the unjust action. According to rule the relative should
be next its antecedent king, then the sentence is clear; “thus,
“The king who had never before committed so unjust an action,
dismissed, &c.” “You are the friend who has often relieved me.”
G 3
130 ENGLISH GRAMMAR.
Which are the two antecedents 2 You and friend; and the relative
who must agree with the latter, namely, friend. “I am the tutor
who instructs you to-day,” and, “I who instructs you to-day, am
the tutor.” A difference of meaning is implied, arising from the
position of the phrase to-day. “I am the tutor who instructs you
to-day;” that is, only for this day; but “I who instructs you to
day am the tutor; that is, “I am your regular tutor.” The sen
tences, without the phrase to-day, would have the same meaning,
whether the relative comes before or after the second antecedent.
WIoLATIONS.-l. I am a man who speaks but seldom. 2. I am
the person who adopt that sentiment, and maintains it. 3. Thou
art the friend that has often relieved me, and that has not deserted
me now in the time of peculiar need. 4. The soldier with a single
companion, who passed for the bravest man in the regiment.
6. The boy beat his companion, whom everybody believed inca
pable of doing mischief. 6. Thou art he who driedst up the red
sea before thy people Israel. 7. Thou art a pupil who possesses
bright parts, but who has cultivated them but little. 8. I acknow
ledge that I am the teacher who adopt that sentiment and main
tains the propriety af such measures. 9. I am the Lord thy God,
who teacheth thee to profit, and who lead thee by the way thou
shouldst go. 10. I am the person who advise such things.
2. When the relative and the verb have been deter
mined to agree with the antecedent, the same relative
and verb must be preserved throughout the sentence; as,
“I am the father who loves you, that cherishes you, that
provideth for you,” should be, “I am the father who loves
you, who cherishes you, who provides for you.” “I am
the Lord, that maketh all things, that stretcheth forth
the heavens.”
Should we annex to the last sentence, “by myself,” then the
verbs must be in the first person; as, “I am the Lord that
make;” that is, “I make,” “I stretch.” In the third person sin
gular of verbs, the solemn eth seems to become the dignity of the
Almighty better than the familiar es; thus, “I am the Lord
thy God, who teacheth thee to profit; who leadeth thee by the way
thou shouldst go;” is more dignified than, “I am the Lord thy
God, who teaches thee to profit, who leads thee, &c.
This rule needs no further illustrations, we may now proceed to
coRRECT the following sentences:—1. I am he who preserves
thee, that teacheth thee, thatprovides for thee. 2. The boy who,
when he was at school, learned fast; but had the misfortune to
lose his father, who loved him, which provided for him.
3. In familiar language, the relative is frequently
omitted; as, “He is a man I greatly esteem,” instead
of “He is a man whom I greatly esteem.” The rela
tive should never be omitted, even in familiar con
SYNTAX. 131
versation. “I am displeased with the manner I have
spent my time,” is very inelegant; it should be, “I am
displeased with the manner in which, &c.
RULE 38.—When the relative pronoun is ofthe interro.
gative kind,then thenoun or pronoun containing the answer
must be in the same case as that which contains the ques
tion; as, “Whose books are these ?” “They are mine.”
STUDENT.—What is the first point? To look in what case the
relative pronoun that asks the question is. Why? Because the
pronoun which answers the question must be in the same case.
Explain yourself. If the question begins with a nominative pro
noun, the answer must be the nominative pronoun. If the ques
tion begins with a possessive pronoun, the answer must be the pos
sessive pronoun; and if the question begins with an objective pro
*oun, the answer must be the objective pronoun,
ILLUSTRATIONs.—Who calls? I; that is, I call. We could
not say me (calls.) Whose pen is this? Mary's; that is, it is
Mary's pen. Whom shall I serve? Him. Because whom is the
objective, and the answer him is the objective.

Whom did you meet? He. 15. Who bought that book? Him,
16. Whom did you see there? He and his sister. 17. Whose
pen is this? Mine's.
RULE 39.—Active-transitive verbs govern nouns and
pronouns in the objective case, but do not admit a prepo
sition after them; as, “We admire them.” You tell
James.”
ExPLANATORY REMARKs.—1. A whole clause may be the object
of an active-transitive verb; as, “You see how few of these men
are returned.” 2. A noun or pronoun preceeding the transitive
verb, is in the nominative, when it is the AGENT of the action; as,
“John loves Henry.” (See page 14, No. 7; also, bottom of page
15.) 3. When the objectiveis a relative expressed or implied, it
comes before the verb that governs it; as, “If ye love me, keep
my commandments.” (See lesson w, No. 3, page 95.) 4. The
objective noun or pronoun, when emphatic, precedes the verb; as,
“Whom ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you.” Place
the objective noun or pronoun as near the verb as possible.

power to reward or punish us for ever.
RULE 40.—Trans tive verbs, signifying allow, ask,
deny, envy, fine, give, grudge, offer, pay, promise, teach,
teil, send, admit two objective cases after them, the thing
is governed by the verb, and the person by a preposition
understood; as, “He sent it us;” that is, “He sent it
to us.”
STUDENT.—What verbs are followed by two objective cases?
Are both these cases governed by the verb 2 By what is the thing
governed? By what is the person governed ?
Supply the preposition to its proper object in the following sen
tences:—He asked him his opinion. He promised him a book.
I sent him a grammar. He offered me a pardon. She told you
the story. I will pay you the sum.
RULE 41.—Active-intransitive and neuter verbs do
neither admit the passive form in a sentence, nor the objec
tive case after them; as, “Repenting him ofhis design,"
should be, “Repening of,” &c. “Whose number was
now amounted to twenty,” should be, “had amounted."

bid, can, dare, feel, hear, have, know, let, make, may,
must, need, perceive, observe, say, shall, see, will ; as,

ExPLANATORY REMARKs.—1. To is generally prefixed to 'the
passive voice of these verbs, except let; as, “He was bid to run.”
“They were made to go.” “He was let go.” 2. Have, denoting
possession or obligation, is generally followed by to; as, “I had
to walk all the way.” When have implies volition (willing) to is
generally omitted; as, “Would they have us reject such an offer?
4. Dare, when it signifies defy or challenge, requires to; as, “I
dare thee but to breathe upon my love.”
STUDENT.—What do you first notice in this rule? A verb in
the infinitive mood. What does the infinitive mood express?

REMARKS AND CAUTIONs.—1. Prepositions should never be
separated from their relative or object. “Who servest thou under"
should be “Under whom doest thou serve.” *:N×
2. The preposition to is generally omitted before the personal
pronouns; as, “Give me the book, instead of “Give the book to
me,” or, “Give to me the book.”
3. Sometimes the relative is omitted; it should always be sup
plied; as, “The temper of mind he was then in,” should be,

4. One relation must not be expressed by two different preposi
tions in the same clause; thus, “The combat between thirty
French against twenty English.” Here there is only one idea

sequently, the use of two different prepositions is improper.
5. Never connect two prepositions, or one and an active-tran
sitive verb, with the same noun; thus, “They were refused

RULE 46. Conjunctions couple the same moods and
tenses of verbs, when the subject is not repeated; as,
“Do good and seek peace.”
REMARKs.—l. The same form of the verb must be continued
through the sentence; as, “Professing regard, and acting differ
ently, mark a base mind.” It should not be “professing regard
and to act differently,” &c. \
2. If the sense requires the verbs to be in different moods and
tenses, the nominative must be repeated, otherwise the second verb
will have no nominative; as, “I know it, and I can prove it.”
3. The nominative is generally repeated, even to the same mood
and tense, when a contrast is stated, or when the sentence is inter
rogative or emphatical; as, “Do you say so, and can you prove
it?” (See Rule 10, the second portion.)
STUDENT.—Name the first point here. Conjunction. What is
a conjunction ? What do conjunctions do? Couple the same,
&c. What do you mean by mood? What by tense? What is

wrote should be writes, because conjunctions couple, &c.

ORSERVE.—Great attention must be paid, to preserve a correct
and an easy connexion of these different clauses, which custom
has made to correspond to each other, so that, when one of these
conjunctive particles is found in the beginning of a sentence, the
corresponding one is expected to follow in some subsequent part
of the sentence.
VIoIATIONs.—1. Both honour, riches, glory, await the con

fixed, that the secret was yet communicated to very few. 15. He
has too much sense and prudence than to become a dupe to such

PARTICIPLES.
RULE 48.—Active Participles govern nouns and pro
nouns in the objective case, as the verbs do from which
they are derived; as, “I am weary with hearing him.”
“Having praised them he sat down.”
REMARKs.—1. When the past participle is used with the person
of the verb to be, then an objective pronoun cannot follow it, with
out a preposition; as, “I am loved by her.” 2. Such phraseologies
as these are called passive The same meaning may always be
expressed actively; as, “She loves me.”
3. When the participle is taken absolutely it is adequate to a
verb in the infinitive mood; as, “Properly speaking; (absolute
Jorm) for, “To speak properly.”
STUDENT.—What is the first point here? Active participles.
What is a participle? Name ten active participles. What do
active participles govern ? Nouns and pronouns in the objective
CàS6.
142 ENGLISH GRAMMAR.
WIoLATIONs.—l. Who I am obeying. 2. They I am reproving.
3. He is wearying hisself in vain. 4. I could not refrain from
suspecting they as enemies, and he as a suspicious friend. 5. He
prepares them for this event, by sending to their proper informa
tion. 6. Upon seeing I he turned pale. 7. He is a man who I
am far from considering happy. 8. Respecting you, he, and they
I said little.
RULE 49.—When the present participle is active or
doing something, then it requiresan article before it,and of
after it; as, “By the preaching of Christ.” “In the
hearing of the philosopher.”
REMARKs.—1. The present participle has always the capacity
of a noun when preceded by an article. “By the preaching of
Christ,” or, “By Christ's preaching.” “In the hearing of the
philosopher;” or, “In the philosopher's hearing.” Here Christ
and philosopher are active. Christ preached; the philosopher
heard. In these instances, the words preaching and hearing are
InounS.
STUDENT.—What is the first point? What does it require?
In what does the present participle end ? Name ten present par
ticiples. Repeat No. 9, page 42. Repeat No. 10, p. 42.
“By exercising our faculties they are improved.”
Which is the present participle? Exercising. Is it active or
doing anything? Yes. What does it require? The sentence
should be, “By the exercising of our faculties,” &c.
VIoIATIONs.—1. Learning of languages is very difficult. 2.
The learning anything speedily requires great application. 3. By
the exercising our faculties they are improved. 4. By observing
of these rules you may avoid mistakes. 5. By obtaining of wis
dom thou wilt command esteem. 6. This was a betraying the
trust reposed in him. 7. The not attending to this rule is the
cause of a very common error. 8. Poverty turns our thoughts
too much upon the supplying our wants, and riches upon the en
joying our superfluities.
RULE 50.—A noun or pronoun before the present
participle is put in the possessive, and must not be
followed by of; as, “Much depends on the pupil's
composing frequently.”
Also, when the noun or pronoun represents the object
ofan action the article and preposition of must be omitted;
as, “ In hearing the philosopher.”
REMARKs.—1. The participles having, and being, and those of
intransitive verbs, exclude the preposition after them; as, “The
having a warm house;” not, “The having of a warm house,” &c.
“The being of a good scholar,” in which construction the word
being has a different meaning; as, we say, “The being of a God."
SYNTAX. 143
2. There is a manifest difference in sense, between “Hearing
the philosopher,” or “ The hearing the philosopher,” and “The
hearing of the philosopher.” In the last form the noun is repre
sented as being the doer. In the first form the noun is the object,
he was heard; according to the second portion of the rule.
3. ILLUSTRATIONs.—“Much depends upon the pupil's composing
frequently.” Here pupil's is in the possessive as coming before
the present participle, according to the first portion of the rule.
4. When a preposition follows the participle, of, is omitted; as,
“His depending on promises,” &c. Depending, according to rule45,
requires to ; in such cases the article should be omitted before the
participle.
STUDENT.—What is the first point in this rule? A noun or
pronoun before the present participle. In what case is it put?
By what must not the participle be followed? What does the
second part of the rule teach 2 When a noun or pronoun repre
sents, &c.
VIoDATIONs.—1. Much depends upon the tyro observing this
rule. 2. What is the reason of this man dismissing his servant?

gaining of converts. 4. I remember it being done. 5. The mid
dle station of life seems to be the most advantageously situated
for the gaining of wisdom. 6. Nothing could have made her so
unhappy, as the marrying a man who possessed such principles.
7. By the observing of truth, you will command esteem. 8. For
his avoiding of that precipice he is indebted to his friend.
RULE 51.—The past participle must always follow the
verbs to have and to be; as, “I have written ;” “He
was chosen;” and not, “I have wrote ;” “He was
chose.”
REMARKs.—1. The past tense and past participle of regular
verbs being formed alike, it is impossible to violate this rule, ex
cept when the participle of an irregular verb is employed. “He
was chose,” is wrong, for chose is the past tense of the verb and not
the past participle. “He repeats verses wrote on glasses.” In
this sentence the verb to be is not expressed before the word wrote,
but it is implied; as, “He repeats verses that are wrote on glas
ses.” It ought to be, “He repeats verses written on glasses.”
STUDENT.—What is the first point? The past participle.
Name the past participles of page 70. What is the second? The
verbs to have and to be.
“He has chose to ride.”
Which is the verb, have or be? Has. What does the verb to
have require after it? The past participle. Which is the parti
ciple? Chose. What should it be? Chosen, because the past
participle must always follow, &c.
WIoLATIONs.—l. This is well wrote. 2. He had mistook me.
3. Smiles were interwove with sighs. 4. He had broke it. 5.
He was beat. 6. The health of Mr G. was drank with applause.

fell out unexpectedly. 10. He would have went with us. 11.
The cloth was wove. 12. The French Language is generally
spoke. 13. He had mistook his true interest, and found himself
forsook by his friends. 14. The Rhine was froze over. 15. She
was showed into the room. 16. He has broke the bottle. 17.
The boy has fell. 18. The horse was stole,
RULE 52.—The past participle must not be used for
the past tense; thus, “He begun,” for, “He began.”
The active participle must not be used for the passive
participle; thus, “Nothing else is wanting,” &c. should
be, “Nothing else is wanted,” &c.
REMARKs.—1. This rule is frequently violated. We often see
the past participle used for the past tense; as, “He run, he drunk,”
instead of “He ran, he drank.”
2. The active participle is frequently used instead of the pas
sive; thus, were I to say, “Ann is wanting,” you would understand
that she was active and seeking, or desiring something, and you
would say, “What is she wanting? But, “Ann is wanted,” is
passive, and means some person wants her, or wishes to see her.
STUDENT.—What are you to notice first? The past participle
must not be used, &c. What is the second? The active parti
ciple. How many participles are there ! In what does the active
or present participle end? Repeat the perfect or past participle.
For what must not an active participle be used? -
Violations.—1. He was greatly heated, and drunk with avidity.
2. They begun to sing with joy. 3. He soon begun to bé"weary
of having nothing to do. 4. He dared not commit so great an
offence, as that which was proposed to him.
PROMISCUO US EXERCISES ON RULES 48 TO 52.
From calling of names he proceeded to blows. Time and
talents were wanting to do justice to the subject. Propriety of

I have rose early this morning. And when they lift up their eyes
they saw no man save Jesus only. The laws of Draco are said
to have been wrote with blood. He spent his whole life in the
doing of good. If we alter the situation of any of the words, we
shall presently be sensible of the melody suffering.
RULE 53.—A or an is used before nouns in the singu
lar number only, individually or collectively; as, “...A
Christian, an Infidel, a score, a thousand.” -
2. The is used before nouns in both numbers; as
“The garden, the scholars, the kings.” (Repeat No. 9,
page 4.)
3. The article being once expressed is sufficient, except
when one word in the same construction begins with a
- SYNTAX. - 145
vowel and another with a consonant; also when a parti
cular emphasis is intended, the article must be repeated
to each word; as, “A dog, a cat, an owl.” “The day
and the hour were appointed.”
4. The article is omitted before a noun that stands for
a whole species, and before the names of minerals, metals,
arts, and sciences. (Repeat No. 10, page 4.)
5. The latter of two nouns, after a comparative, should
have no article, when they both refer to the same indivi
dual; thus, “He is a better reader than writer.”
REMARKs, CAUTIONs, AND ExPLANATIONs of No. 1 of THIS
RULE.—A or an is sometimes used for each, every, or per; as,
“A crown a day;” “Ten pounds per year;” that is, each day;
(l Wear.
: or an before the words few and little serve to increase the
number; as, “He has gained a few friends,” means he has gained
some friends. The omission of the article before such words tends
to diminish the number; as, “His behaviour gained few friends.”
2. The is sometimes repeated before titles; as, “The worship,
the Mayor. The is used before the superlative degree; as, “The
happiest man.” The is used before anything representing the whole
of its species, when compared with another thing representing the
whole of its species; as, “The dog is a more grateful animal than
the cat.
3. It would be ingrammatical were I to say, “A garden and
orchard,” because a is used before consonants, and an before
vowels; it should be, “A garden and an orchard.”
4. Words used in an indefinite manner have no article before
them; as, “He obtained the title of Lord.” Likewise words which
are pointed in their signification; as, “Government offices.”
(Read No. 5, page 6; also, No. 6, page 6,)
5. Great care must be taken in this portion of the rule. Were
I to say, “He makes a better painter than a musician,” I should
mean, “He makes a better painter than a musician would.” But,
were I to say, “He makes a better painter than musician,” I should
mean, “He makes a better painter than he does a musician.”
When there is a peculiarity in the manner of using the adjec
tive, we sometimes place the article between the adjective and the
noun; as, “Too careless an author.”

case of the pronoun, of the first person, and with the
nominative of the pronoun of the second; as, “Ah me!"

STUDENT.—What is the first point? Interjections. What case
follows the first personal pronoun? The objective. What case
follows the second 2 The nominative. What is an interjection?
May any word be an interjection?
Interjective phraseologies occur chiefly in circumstances in which
the person is supposed to be absorbed in his own feeling, or not to

how hast thou deceived me? 3. Oh! happy us, surrounded with
so many blessings. 4. Woe's Il for I am unclean. 5. Ah!
unhappy thee.
THE SUBJUNCTIVE MOOD.
RULE 55.—When sentences imply doubt,condition, or
supposition, the verb must be of the suppositional tense,
subjunctive mood, when FUTURITY is implied; as, “If
he be alone give him the letter:” - -
But when the past or present tense denotes uncertainty,
the subjunctive is the same as the indicative; as, “If he
speaks as he thinks, he may be trusted.”
ExPLANATORY REMARKs, &c.—1. Sentences containing verbs in
the indicative, past tense, imply the action to have taken place,
although to us it is uncertain; and in such cases we use the sub
junctive form if, unless, &c.; as, “IF the king was present.”
2. Many writers in the perfect tense use have instead of hast
and has; as, “If thou have determined;” “Unless he have learned;”
should be, hast determined, has learned.
3. The past perfect and future tenses of the subjunctive are for
the most part improperly used; thus, “If thou had applied;” “If
thou will go; should be, hadst and wilt.
4. We sometimes see the second person singular ofthe past tense,
in the subjunctive improperly used; as, “If thou loved him.” Loved
should be lovedst. (See page 51.)
STUDENT.—What is the firstpoint? Sentences implying doubt,
&c. What is the second? The verb must be of the suppositional
tense, &c. When is the subjunctive the same as the indicative?
When the past or present tense denotes, &c. What does the sub
junctive mood imply? What does the word subjunctive signify 3
Read the illustrations, p. 41. How is a future uncertainty expressed ?
Repeat the past tense, subjunctive mood. Repeat the present. In
what tense is “If it blows”—“If he was poor”—“Ifthou art the
Son of God?” Repeat the suppositional tense. Repeat the future.
Repeat the future perfect. In what tense is “If thou be”—“If I
shall have been”—“If thou shalt or wilt be?” What do I mean
when I say, “If thou be the Son of God?" You mean ifhe should
at a future time be the Son of God. What should it be? If thou
art, &c. Why? Because he either is or is not the Son of God.
What does the suppositional tense imply? It implies not only a
condition, but also futurity. How do you know when to use the
H 2
148 ENGLISH GRAMMAR.
subjunctive mood? By supplying the auxiliaries. (See page 40,
No. 12.) How do you know what tense to use? By asking,
“Has the event taken place? or is it now taking place?” (Read
top ofpage 66.) When does the verb undergo no variation? In
the future, without auxiliaries; as, “If Igo;” “If thou go;” “If
he go;” “If we go;” “If you go;” “If they go.” (See page 40,
No. 9, 10, and 12.)
“If he acquires riches.”
Which is the conjunction? If Which is the verb Acquires.
Has he acquired riches? No, Does he acquire riches? No.
In what mood should the verb be? Subjunctive. Why? Because
both futurity and uncertainty are implied.
VIoLATIONs.—l. Love not idleness, lest thou comest to want.
2. He will be punished if he transgresses the law. 3. If thou

walk in the fields to-day, unless it rains. 17. If thou be Christ.
18. If thy right eye offend thee. 19. Oh! that his heart was
tender. 20. If he have promised he must be faithful. 21. If
thou had succeeded, perhaps thou would not be the happier.
THE USE OF THE TEN SES.
RULE 56.—In the use of verbs, words, and phrases
which, in point of time, relate to each other, use that tense
which clearly conveys the sense required; thus, instead
of saying,“I remember him these many years,"we should
say, “I have remembered him these many years.”
ILLUSTRATIONs.—“I remember him, &c.” Remember ought to
be, have remembered, &c., because the action implied by the verb
remember was finished, and yet refers to the present time, the verb
must, therefore, be in the perfect tense.
STUDENT.—What is the first point? In the use of verbs, words,
and phrases, &c. What words beside verbs relate to time?
Adverbs of time. Repeat No.4, page 73. Whatmust be observed
respecting those verbs, &c., that imply time? We use that tense
which clearly conveys the sense required. Read the remarks on
the tenses, page 44 to 48.
VIoLATIONs.—l. The Lord hath given and the Lord hath taken
away. 2. I have compassion on the multitude, because they con
tinue with me now three days. 3. Ye will not come unto me,that
ye might have life. 4. And he that was dead sat up and began to
speak. 5. The next New Years Day, I shall be at school three

years. 6. It would have given me great satisfaction to relieve

day a valuable book, but to-day he took it from me. 8. He has
lately lost an only son. 9. In the least insect, there have been
muscles, nerves, joints, veins, arteries, and blood.
RULE 57.—After the past tense, the present infinitive,
(and not the£ should be used; as, “I intend to
write to my father—and not I intended to have written.”
STUDENT.—What is the first point ? The past tense. What
should be used after the past tense? The presentinfinitive. What
then should you do? Look for the past tense, and put the verb
that follows it in the present infinitive.
VIoIATIONs.—1. They said they intended to have met us. 2. I
expected to have gotten a prize this week. 3. It was then my
purpose to have visited Wales. 4. We have done no more than

CoRRECT-l. We shall welcome him when he arrive. 2. He
must suffer before he repent 3. As soon as he return, we will
recommence grammar. 4. Let it remain till he come.
RULE 58.—To express our ideas in few words, an
ellipsis, or omission of some words is frequently admitted;
thus, instead of saying, “He was a learned man, he was
a wise man, and he was a good man,” we say, “He was
a learned, wise, and good man.”
REMARKs.—1. Where a word has been once introduced in a
sentence, and can be easily understood, it should be omitted;
thus, “A house and a garden.” The a before garden may be
omitted. (See page 144, No. 3.)
2. The auxiliaries of the compound tenses are often used alone,
to avoid the repetition of the principal verb; as, “We succeeded,
but they did not;” that is, “They did not succeed.”
STUDENT.—What is the first point? What is an ellipsis? A
sentence in which something is left out. What does this rule
teach you? To omit all words that may with propriety be left
out.

punished, and they shall be punished. 8. That gown is the par
son's gown. 9. The gay and the pleasing are sometimes the most
insiduous and the most dangerous companions.
RULE 59.—When omission of words would obscure
the sentence, weaken its force, or render it ungrammatical,
they must be expressed; for example, “The captain had
several men died in his ship,” should be, “The captain
had several men who died,” &c.
When we wish to render the sentence emphatical, the
repetition of words is necessary; thus, “Power, wisdom,
goodness, shine forth in the works of creation,” would be
more strongly expressed by saying, “Power, and wisdom,
and goodness, shine forth in the works of creation.”
EXPLANATORY REMARKS AND ILLUSTRATIONS.
1. When several words follow each other, having the same con
struction in a sentence, and all defined by the same word, the
defining term may be omitted without affecting the grammatical
construction, or the sense; as, “He gave his library, books, and
papers to his brother.”
ILLUSTRATION.—Here, the words books and papers, following in
the same order as library, renders it unnecessary to repeat the
defining term his.
2. The ellipsis of the ARTICLE is thus used; “A man, woman,
and child;" that is, “A man, a woman, and a child.” (See Rule
53, No. 3.)
3. The NoUN is frequently omitted in the following manner:—
“The laws of God and man;” here the repetition of laws is unne
cessary.
4. The omission of the ADJECTIVE. “A little man and woman;"
that is, “A little man and a little woman.”
OBSERVE.—In expressions of this kind, the adjective ought to
have exactly the same signification, and be quite as proper, when
joined to the latter as to the former, otherwise the ellipsis should
not be admitted. The same adjective should not be applied totwo
nouns of different numbers; thus, “A magnificent house and gar
dens;” is better thus, “A magnificent house and fine gardens.”
5. An ellipsis of the PRONoUN. “I love and fear him;” thatis,
“I love him and I fear him.” (See page 130, No. 3; also, page
134, No. 3.) -
6. Of the VERB.—“He was old, sullen, and crafty;” that is,
“He was old, he was sullen, and he was crafty.” When we wish
to point out one property above the rest, then we place that
perty last, and the ellipsis is sppplied; as, “He was old, sul
and he was crafty.”
7. Of the ADVERB. “He spoke and acted wisely;” that is, “He
spoke wisely, and he acted wisely.”
SYNTAX. 15]
8. The ellipsis of the PREPosition, as well as of the verb, is seen
in the following instances:—“He went into the abbeys, halls, and
public buildings;” that is, “He went into the abbeys, he went
into the halls, and he went into the public buildings.” “He was
expelled (from) his country.”
9. The conjunction. “They confess the power, wisdom, good
ness, and the love of their Creator;” that is, “The power and
wisdom, and goodness, and love of their Creator.”
10. The ellipsis of the INTERJECTION is not very common; it is,
however, sometimes used; as, “Oh! pity and shame!” that is,
“Oh pity! Oh shame!”
ExERCISEs.—1. A horse and ass, 2. A learned and amiable
young man. 3. I gladly shunned who gladly fled from tae. 4. I
must, however, be so candid to own I have been mistaken. 5.
Why do ye that which is not lawful to do on the Sabbath day?
6. It is not only the duty, but interest of young persons to be stu
dious and diligent.
RULE 60.—All the parts of a sentence should corrre
spond to each other, and a regular and dependentconstruc
tion throughout be carefully preserved. Also, a proper
choice of words should be carefully attended to.
ILLUSTRATION.—“Neither has he, nor any other persons, sus
pected so much dissimulation.” Nor any, should be, nor have
any, to correspond with, neither has.
ExERCISEs.—1. He is more bold and active, but not so wise
and studious as his companion. 2. The first proposal was essen
tially different and inferior to the second. 3. Thou hearest the
sound of the wind, but canst not tell whence it cometh and whither

there is none so useful as discretion. 19. No man is fit for free
conversation for the inquiry after truth, if he be exceedingly
reserved; if he be haughty and proud of his knowledge; if he be

peace. 2. A child of four years old was thus cruelly deserted

Groves, fields, and meadows, are, at any season of the year, beau

mony which he is compelled to give. 6. James used to compare
him with a cat, who always fell upon her legs. 7. There never

greatest statesman and the wisest philosopher. 9. It is of great
consequence, that a teacher believes firmly both the truth and
importance of those principles which he inculcates upon others;
and that he not only believes them speculatively, but has a lively

honoured and prosperous in the world, it is sometimes discourage
ment to virtue. 11, Was there no bad men in the world, to vex

it to have been. 29. He runs as if he contends for victory. 30.
He trifles as if he is destitute of sense.
MISC ELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.
1. FARTHER applies to place and distance, and FUR
THER to quantity or addition.
2. LATER or LATTER cannot, with propriety, be used
indifferently; latter refers to place; later respects time
only. -
3. The phrase “seldom or ever” is improper; it should
be, “seldom if ever,” or “seldom or never.”
4. We should not say, “He lays in bed too long,"
(lies.)
SYNTAX. 161
An author says—
“I have a work laying by me,” (lying.)
“Go and lay down on the bed,” (lie.)
“I laid and slept an hour,” (lay.)
“I was laying on the grass,” (lying.)
“He has laid there a long time,” (lain.)
“He has lain himself down to rest,” (laid.)
5. When the nominative case has no personal tense of
a verb, but is put before a participle, independent of the
rest of the sentence, also when an address is made to a
person, it is called the case absolute; as, “John, attend
to your lesson.” “Shame being lost, all virtue is lost.”
6. Every verb, except in the infinitive mood or the
participle, requires a nominative, expressed or understood;
as, “Attend to advice;” that is, attend ye.
7. An objective case must never be used for the nomi
native absolute; as, “Him destroyed” should be, “He
destroyed.”
8. The phrase as follows is frequently misapplied.
When the subjectis singular, we use the phrase as follows;
as, “His argument was as follows.” But when the sub
ject is plural, we use as follow; thus, “His words were
as follow.” -
The word as is adequate to that which, or those which,
..As appears is always singular; “His arguments were, as
appears, incontrovertable;” that is, as it appears.
When we say, “His arguments were such as follow,”
we convey the idea, that the arguments which follow are
not the very same that he used, but that they are only of
the same nature or kind.
9. The relative THAT is prefixed to the first of several
adjectives, qualifying one noun; as, “That great and
good man” means only one man; but that great and that
good man, would mean two men; the one a great man,
the other a good man.
That must not be used after a proper name. .

PUNCTUATION.
PUNCTUATION is the art ofdividing written composition
into sentences, or parts of sentences, by points or stops,
in order to convey to the reader the exact sense, and assist
him in the proper delivery.
The principal points are, the Reading Pause (),
Comma (,), Semicolan (;), Colon (:), and the Period
(..). To which may be added the Vote of Intorroga
tion (?), the Ea'clamation (!), and the Dash (–).
In reading we frequently find it necessary to make
almost an unapprehended cessation of the voice, where
the comma is inadmissable. Consequently, we consider
the art of punctuation defective. This defect, therefore,
I have endeavoured to remedy, by the introduction of the
READING PAUSE.
READING PAUSE.
RULE 1.—A simple sentence, when it is a short one,
requires only a full stop at the end; as, “God created
the world.” -
RULE 2.—The Reading Pause should be employed
when the sense of the passage requires a slight pause,
and, at the same time, will not admit the comma; as,
“Of all ill-habits, that of idleness is the most incorrigible."
ExAMPLEs.—l. What is the difference between the old, and the
new. 2. There are witnesses of the fact, which I have mentioned,
3. The mind of man should not be left without something, on
which to feed. 4. He was influenced both by a just, and a gener
ous principle.
-
-
RULE 3.—The Reading Pause must be used before
an adjective, when it has other words depending on it;
as, “There is a system of opinions, peculiar almost to
every age.”
RULE 4.—After the case absolute and the infinitive
mood, the Reading Pause must be used; as, “To give
him his due, he was an honest man.”
PUNCTUATION. 168
RULE 5.—When the nominative case is a phrase, the
Reading Pause must be placed between the nominative
and the verb; as, “To be good, is to be happy.”
RULE 6.—When a comparison is used by the adjective
like, and consists of several terms, it is separated from the
rest of the sentence by the Reading Pause; as, “Gene
rations of men glide away, like the rapid streams of a
T1Wer.
But when the comparative member is short, the Read
ing Pause may be omitted; as, “Our time passes away
like a shadow.” -
EXERCISES ON THE WHOLE RULES.
1. Live well that ye may die well. 2. To confess the truth I
own I was much in fault. 3. There are witnesses of the fact
which I have mentioned. 4. Peace of mind being secured we
may smile at misfortunes, 5. The book of Job is a poem full of
the noblest and most majestic figures. 6. The great end of all
human industry is the attainment of happiness. 7. Many persons
gratify their eyes and ears instead of their understanding. 8.
Our intention being good we had nothing to fear. 9. The mind
of man should not be left without something on which to employ
its energies.
CoMMA.
RULE 1.—When a simple sentence is a long one, a
Comma must be inserted immediately before the verb;
as, “The most acceptable sacrifice, is that of a contrite
heart.”
ExERCISEs.—The friend of order has made half his way to
virtue. To be totally indifferent to praise or censure is a real
defect in character. The most acceptable sacrifice is that of a
contrite and humble heart. Too many of the pretended friend
ships of youth are mere combinations in pleasure. The inter
mixture of evil in human society serves to exercise the suffering
graces and virtues of the good. The good taste of the present
age has not allowed us to neglect the cultivation of the English
language.
RULE 2.—The simple members of a compound sen
tence are separated by commas; as, “He studies diligently,
and makes great progress,”
ExERCISEs.–Crafty men contemn studies simple men admire
them and wise men use them. To be humble and modest in
opinion to be vigilent and attentive in conduct to distrust fair
appearances and to 1estrain rash desires are instructions which
the darkness of our present state should strongly inculcate. If
164, ENGLISH GRAMMAR.
the mind sow not corn it will plant thistles. If we delay till to.
morrow what ought to be done to-day we overcharge the morrow
with a burden which belongs not to it.
RULE 3.—Two words of the same part of speech,
whether nouns, adjectives, verbs, participles, or adverbs,
do not admit a comma between them, when connected by
a conjunction; as, “George and John are good.”
But when the conjunction is not expressed, a comma
is inserted between the words; as, “He is a plain,
honest man.” *
ExERCISEs.—Deliberate slowly execute promptly. Benefits
should be long and gratefully remembered. Some men sin de
liberately and presumptuously. The vicious man is often looking
round him with anxious and fearful circumspection. He and she
were present. By reading and composing frequently he acquired
facility of expression. Every tie every sense of honour was
obliterated. This unhappy person had often been seriously and
affectionately admonished.
RULE 4.—Three or more nouns, adjectives, verbs,
participles, or adverbs are separated by commas; as,
“The sun, moon, and stars, are the glory of nature.”
When words follow in pairs, they are separated in
pairs by the comma; as, “His English is pure and
simple, nervous and clear.”
ExERCISEs.–Corn wine oil and vegetables are preferable to
diamonds and rubies. He loved them because they were mild
attentive and grateful. The man of virtue and honour will be
trusted relied upon and esteemed. He was happy in being loved
esteemed and respected. To live soberly righteously and piously
comprehends the whole of our duty. Whether we eat or drink
labour or sleep we should be moderate. Truth is fair and artless
simple and sincere uniform and consistent. The rose the violet
the tulip the narcissus the hyacinth the gilliflower the jasamine
the lily the honeysuckle the ranunculus are the delight of the
sight.
RULE 5.—All phrases, emphatic words, or explanatory
sentences, whether in the beginning, end, or middle of a
simple sentence, are set off by the comma; as, “He
was, in short, a great man.”
ExERCISEs.—The king approving the plan put it into execution.
Paul the apostle of the Gentiles was eminent for his zeal and
knowledge. I have seen the emperor as he was called. Charity
like the sun brightens all its objects. Trials in this stage of being
are the lot of man. Gentleness delights above all things to
alleviate distress and if it cannot dry up the falling tear to sooth
at least the grieving heart.
PUNCTUATION. 165
RULE 6.—The modifying words and phrases, against,
at least, besides,' indeed, in fact, first, formerly,
hence, however, lastly, nay, now, so, in short, therefore,
wherefore, and the like, are separated by commas when
considered of importance.
When, however, these words are not of importance,
and, particularly in short sentences, the comma is not
inserted.
ExERCISEs.—I shall make some observations first on the ex
ternal and next on the internal condition of man. I proceed
secondly to point out the proper state of our temper with respect
to one another. Here every thing is in stir and fluctuation there
all is serene and orderly. Industry will undoubtedly be rewarded.
He was formerly a wealthy citizen. It was indeed very culpable.
RULE 7.—Any clause containing a finite verb, and
coming between a nominative case and its verb, may be
separated by a comma.
ExECISEs.—The man who is faithfully attached to religion may
be relied on with confidence. Thou who hast been a witness of
the fact canst give an account of it. The king who loves his
subjects deservedly honoured. He who conquers himself is a
brave man.
RULE 8.—The words used in a direct address, a short
observation, and the infinitive mood absolute, when it is
not used as a nominative case, are separated from the rest
of the sentence by commas.
ExERCISEs.—My son give me thy heart. I am obliged to you
my friends for your favours. I remain Sir your obedient Servant.
Plutarch calls lying the vice of slaves. I thank you madam. To
say the least they have betrayed great want of prudence. Come
then companion of my toils let us take fresh courage. -
RULE 9.—A comma is inserted between the two parts
of a sentence, which have their natural order inverted;
as, “Him that is weak in the faith, receive ye.”
ExERCISEs.—In youth the habits of industry are most easily
acquired. What is the right path few take the trouble of inquir
ing. To God nothing is impossible. By threads innumerable
Our interests are interwoven.
RULE 10.—When several words come between the
relative and its antecedent, a comma must be inserted;
but not in other cases; as, “There is no charm in the
female sex, which can supply the place of virtue.” “It
is labour only which gives the relish to pleasure."
l66 ENGLISH GRAMMAR.
Ex:Rcises.—The first beauty of style is propriety without
which all ornament is puerile and superfluous. Blind must the
man be who discerns not the most striking marks of divine
government exercised over the world. Many of the evils which
occasion our complaints of the world are wholly imaginary.
RULE 11.—The verb to be, followed by an adjective
or a verb in the infinitive, which, by transposition, might
be made the nominative to it, the former is generally
separated from the latter verb by a comma; as, “To be
diligently employed in the performance of real duty, is
honourable.” “It is honourable, to be diligently em
ployed in the performance of real duty.”
ExERcises.—The greatest misery is to be condemned by our
own hearts. One of the noblest of the Christian virtues is to love
our enemies. The best preservative of health is to be temperate
in all our gratifications.
RULE i 2.—When a verb is understood, a comma must
be inserted, and particularly before not, but, and though;
as, “Reading makes a full man; conference, a ready
man; and writing, an exact man."
ExERCISEs.—He was a great poet but a bad man. The sun is
up though he is not visible. A man ought to obey reason not
appetite. As a companion he was severe and satirical; as a
friend captious and dangerous; in a domestic sphere harsh jealous
and irrascible.
RULE 13.—Any remarkable expression resembling a
quotation, command, or emphatic phrase, is separated by
a COinlina.
ExERCISEs.—I say unto all watch. Against thee thee only
have I sinned. Turn ye turn ye why will ye die? There is
much truth in the proverb without pains no gains.
RULE 14.—Adjectives and participles, whensomething
depends on them, are generally separated from the rest
of the sentence, by commas. -
ExAMPLEs.—The king approving the plan, put it into ex9.
cution.
Let graceful memory, from her purest cell,
Lead forth a goodly train ofvirtues fair,
Cherished in earliest youth.
Human affairs are in continual motion and fluctuation, altering
their appearance every moment, and passing into some new forms.
RULE 15.—The word that, used as a conjunction, is
preceded by a comma; as, “Be virtuous, that ye may
be happy.”
*
PUNCTUATION. 167
ExERCISEs.—Be diligent that you may become learned. Search
the scriptures that ye may become wise to salvation.
RULE 16.—Words in what is called opposition, must,
when other words accompany them, be separated from the
rest of the sentence, bythe comma; as, “Paul, the apostle
of the Gentiles, was eminent for his zeal.”
ExERCISEs.—The island of Mona now Anglesea was the chief
seat of the Druids. Augustus the Roman emperor was a patron
of the fine arts.
RULE 17.–Simple members of long sentences, con
nected by comparatives, and phrases placed in opposition
to each other, are separated by commas; as, “As thy
day, so shall thy strength be.”
ExERCISEs.—As the hart panteth after the water.brooks so pant
eth my soul after thee. The more a man speaks of himself the
less he likes to hear another talked of The friendships of the
world can subsist no longer than interest cements them.
Though deep yet clear though gentie yet not dull
Strong without rage without overflowing full.
RULE 18.—When a conjunction is divided, by a phrase
or sentence, from the verb to which it belongs, such inter
vening phrase has generally a comma at each extremity;
as, “They set out early, and, before the close of the day,
arrived at the destined place.”
OF THE SEMIcolon,
Containing insertions of the Semicolon and the Comma.
The semicolon is used to separate the parts of a sen
tence, which are less dependent on each other than those
separated by the comma. -
RULE 1.—When a sentence consists of two parts, the
one containing a complete proposition, and the other
added as an inference, or to give some explanation, the
two parts are separated by a semicolon; as, “Economy
is no disgrace; for it is better to live on a little, than to
outlive a great deal.”
ExERCISEs.—When you have received a favour remember it
when you have granted one forget it. Modesty is one of the chief
ornaments of youth and it has ever been esteemed a presage of
rising merit. The passions are the chief destroyers of our peace
the storms and tempest of the moral world.
168 ENGLISH GRAMMAR.
RULE 2.—When there is some comparison or contrast
in the sentence, a semicolon should be used; as, “Heaven
is the region of gentleness and friendship; Hell of fierce
ness and animosity.”
ExERCISEs.—The path of truth is a plain and safe path that of
falsehood a perplexing maze. As a roaring lion and a raging
bear so is a wicked ruler over the poor people. He that loveth
pleasure shall be a poor man he that loveth wine and oil shall not
be rich.
RULE 3.—When several short sentences follow each
other, having merely a slight connexion in idea, though
in other respects independent of the former, they may be
separated; as, “Everything grows old; everything passes
away; everything disappears.”
ExERCISEs.—Wisdom hath builded her house she hath hewn
out her seven pillars she hath killed her beasts she hath mingled
her wine she hath also furnished her table. The pride of wealth
is contemptable the pride of learning is pitiable the pride of dig
nity is ridiculous and the pride of bigotry is insupportable. In
the prospect of poverty there is nothing but gloom and melancholy
the mind and body suffer together its miseries bring no alleviation
it is a state in which every virtue is obscured and in which no
conduct can avoid reproach. The epic poem recites the exploits
of a hero tragedy represents a disasterous event comedy ridicules
the vices and follies of mankind pastoral poetry describes rural
life and elegy displays the tender emotions of the heart.
OF THE Colon.
RULE 1.—The Colon is used when the member of a
sentence is complete in itself, both in sense and construc
tion; but is followed by some supplemental remark or
illustration, depending upon it in sense, though not in
syntax. -
ExAMPLE.—Nature felt her inability to extricate herself from
the consequences of guilt: the Gospel reveals the plan of divine
interposition and aid. -
ExERCISEs—containing also application of the Comma and the
Semicolon.—Do not suffer life to stagnate it will grow muddy for
want of motion commit yourself again to the current of the world.
To sail on the tranquil surface of an unruffled lake and to steer
a safe course through a troubled and stormy ocean require differ
ent talents and alas human life oftener resembles the stormy
ocean than the unruffled lake, Happy would the poor man think
himself if he could enter on all the treasures of the rich and happy
for a short time he might be but before he had long contemplated
and admired his state his possessions would seem to lessen and his
cares would grow.
PUNCTUATION. 169
RULE 2.—When a long sentence contains several
complete members separated by the semicolon, the con
cluding member requires a colon before it.
ExAMPLE.—By doing, or at least endeavouring to do, our duty
to God and man, by acquiring an humble trust in the mercy and
favour of God, through Jesus Christ; by cultivating our minds,
and properly employing our time and thoughts; by correcting all
unreasonable expectations from the world, and from men; and,
in the midst of worldly business, habituating ourselves to calm
and serious recollection: by such means as these, it may be hoped
that, through the Divine blessing, our days shall flow in a stream
as unruffled as the human state admits.
RULE 3.—A colon is generally used when a quotation
or speech is introduced.
ExAMPLEs.—He was often heard to say: I have done with the
world, and I am willing to leave it. The scriptures give us an
amiable representation of the Deity, in these words: God is love.
RULE 4.—A colon is used where the sense is com
plete in the first clause, and the next begins with a con
junction understood; as, “ Apply yourself to learning:
it will redound to your honour.”
But when the conjunction is expressed, the semicolon
must be inserted; as, “Apply yourself to learning; for
it will redound to your honour.”
OF THE PERIOD.
RULE 1.—When a sentence is complete, in construc
tion and sense, it is marked with a period; as, “God
made the world.” The period must be used after all abre
viations; as, A.D., M.M.S., Fol.
A period is sometimes inserted between sentences which
are connected by conjunctions; as, “And he arose and
came to his father. But when he was a great way off,” &c.
Interrogation (?) is used when a question is asked.
Exclamation (!) is used after all interjections, sudden
emotion, joy, terror, surprise. (See page 81; also 93.)
Other characters are likewise used in composition.
A parenthesis () includes a clause inserted in the
body of a sentence, containing some useful remark, which
may be taken out without injuring the sense of that which
encloses it.
An apostrophe ('), marks the possessive noun, or a
contraction; as, ne'er for never.
-
170 ENGLISH GRAMMAR.
The marks for acclamation and measure are the acute
accent (') which is used to denote a short syllable.
Grave accent () denotes a long syllable.
An hyphen (-) is used at the end of the line, to show
that the rest of the word is at the beginning of the next
line. It also connects compound words; as, lap-dog.

so marked at the beginning and the end, are a quotation
from some author.

172 ENGLISH GRAMMAR.
PROSODY.
Prosody, from Trpoc (to,) and wón, (song).
PRosody, is that part of grammar which teaches the
true pronunciation of words, and the measure of verses.
Pronunciation comprises accent, quantity, emphasis,
pause, and tone.
.Accent, is a particular stress of the voice on one syllable
of a word, that it may be better heard than the rest in the
same word; as, date in the word sedate.
Quantity means the length of time necessary for the
proper utterance of each syllable. Quantity is either
long or short; as, “Consume.”
A syllable is short when the accent is laid on the consonant;
and long when the accent is on the vowel. (See Walker's Pro
nounciny Dictionary.) A syllable is accented or unaccented according
as stress of the voice is placed upon it in pronunciation.
Emphasis, is a stronger and fuller sound of the voice,
by which we lay a greater stress on some particular word
or words, in order to mark their superior importance in
the sentence; as, “Grammar is a useful science.”
On the right management of the emphasis depends the life and
spirit of every discourse; without it, not only is the discourse
rendered heavy and lifeless, but the meaning is ambiguous; if the
emphasis is placed wrong, we completely pervert and confound
the meaning.
For the proper management of Emphasis.—Study to attain a just
conception, force, and spirit of those sentiments you are about to
utter; mark well the emphatical words; but beware of multiply
ing them unnecessarily.
A Pause or rest is a total cessation of the voice *
order that the speaker may breath. -
Pauses are of two kinds, emphatical pauses, and such as mar
the distinction of sense.
Emphatical pauses are made after something of importance has
been said, on which we wish to fix the hearer's attention. B
careful never to use such pauses too often.
-
VERSIFICATION. I7S
Pauses which mark the distinction of sense.—The distinction of
sense is one of the nicest and most difficult points in public speak
ing, the voice should be relieved at every stop; a breathing slightly
at a reading pause, longer at a comma, a little longer at a semicolon,
still longer at a colon, and completely at a period.
Tones, in pronunciation are different both from em
phasis and pauses, consisting in the modulation of the
voice, the notes, or variations of sound which we employ
in speaking.
It is chiefly in the proper use of tones, that the life, spirit,
beauty, and harmony of delivery consist. As every man when
earnestly speaking in common discourse, on some subject which
interests him, has an eloquent and persuasive tone and manner,
a judicious imitation of this in public speaking will be the best
guide.
Anger, must be expressed by a strong, powerful, and elevated
voice; love, by a soft, smooth, and languishing voice; sorrow, by
a low, flexable, and interupted voice; joy, by a quick, clear, and
smooth voice; courage, by a bold, full, and loud voice.
VERSIFICATION.
Versification is the arrangement of a certain number
of syllables, according to particular rules.
A particular number of connected syllables are called feet, or
measure of paces.
Afoot is part of a verse, and consists of two or three syllables.
A verse is a certain number of connecting feet, forming one line.
A hemistich is half a verse.
A distich or couplet is two verses.
A stanza or stave is a combination of several verses, varying in
number, and forming a division of a song or of a poem.
Rhyme is the name by which we distinguish verses that end with
syllables of similar sound.
In blank verse, the syllables do not rhyme.
Metre consists in the number of syllables in a verse, and the
position of the accent.
Scanning is the measuring or the dividing of a verse into the
several feet of which it is composed.
All feet consist of either two or three syllables, and are of eight
different kinds, four of two syllables, and four of three syllables.
The (") marks the long or accented syllable, and the breve (")
indicates short or unaccented syllables.
DISSYLLABLES, TRISSYLLABLEs.
A trochee. A dactyle.
An iambus. - An amphibrach.
A spondee. An anapaest.
A pyrrhic. A tribrach.
174 ENGLISH GRAMMAR.
Dissyllabaic feet, or feet of two syllables.
A TRochEE (" ") has the first syllable accented, and the last
unaccented; as, “Lövely, hâteful.”
An IAMBUs ("") has the first syllable unaccented, and the last
accented; as, “Béträy, bêcóme.”
A SPONDEE (" ") has both the words or syllables accented; as,
“The pāle moon.”
A PYRRHIC (**) has both the words or syllables unaccented;
as, “On thè tree.”
Trissyllablefeet, or feet of three syllables.
A DACTYLE (" ") has the first syllable accented, and the two
latter unaccented; as, “Pröbābly.”
An AMPHIBRACH (" " ") has the firstand last syllable unaccented,
and the middle one accented; as, “Döméstic.”
An ANAPAEST (" " ") has the first syllables unaccented, and the
last accented; as, “Intércède.”
A TRIBRACH (* * *) has all its syllables unaccented; as,
“Numérāblé.”
Verses are distinguished by various names, according
to the feet that prevail in them; as, Iambic, Trochaic,
and Anapaestic.
The two most common kind of verses are the Iambic
and Trochaic.
IAMBIC MEASURE.
Iambic measure has the weak percussion first, and the
loud last. It is the most dignified, and is adapted to
serious subjects, and consists of verses of several kinds; as,
1. Of four syllables, or two feet; thus,
“Unheard, ünknöwn,
Hë mákes his moan.”
2. Of three Iambic feet, or six syllables; thus,
“Thöulöv'st—tó lie—änd hèar
Thérôar-5 f wa—tèrs néar.”
3. Of Iambic of four feet, or eight syllables; thus,
“And māy—ät låst—my wéa—ry āge
Find out—the pèace—fül hèr—mitage.”
Hypermeter, with double rhyme.
“Exulting, trembling, raging, faint—ing,
Possess'd beyond the muses’ paint—ing.”
4. Iambic of five feet, or ten syllables; called our heroic,
hearameter, or tragic verse; as,
“Thé séas—shällwäste,—thé skies—in smöke—dècay;
Röcks fäll-tó dust—ānd möun—tains mêlt—āway;
But fix’d—his word,—his sav—ing pow'r—remains;
Thy realm-for ev-er lasts;—thy own—Messi—ah reigns."
VERSIFICATION. 175
OBSERVE.—The last line contains six Iambic feet, or twelve
syllables; this metre is called the Alexandrine verse.
5. Of verses containing seven feet, or fourteen
syllables ; as,
“Lêt säints—below,-with sweet äccörd, | unite—with those
above.”
These are generally written in two lines in our psalms and
hymns; the second line beginning with the word unite.
TROCHAIC MEASURE.
Trochaic verse has the loud percussion first, and the
weak last. This measure is quick and lively, and com
prises verse,
1. Of onE Trochee and a long syllable; as,
* Tümült—céase
Sink to—peace.”
2. Of Two Trochees, with an additional syllable; as,
“In the—days 3f Öld,
Störiès—pläinly—tóld.”
3. Of THREE Trochees; as,
“When our—hèarts āre mourning.”
OBSERVE.—This form has frequently an additional syllable; as,
“Vitāl—spårk 5f—hèav'nly—flâme!”
4. Of Four Trochees, or eight syllables; as,
“Nów the—dreadfül—thundér's—röaring!”
5. Of six Trochees, or twelve syllables; as,
“On ä—möuntain,—stretch'd bé—nèath ā—höary—willów,
Lāy #—shéphérd—swāin, änd—viêwed thé—röaring—billöw.”
ANAPAESTIC MEASURE.
In Anapaestic verse, the interval between the accented
syllables is double, and the percussion falls on every third
syllable.
1. The first form consists of Two Anapaests; as,
“In my räge—shällbé sèën
Thé révénge—öf à quéén.”
Sometimes, this form assumes an additional short syllable; as,
“Büt his cou—räge gån fail him,
For no arts—could avail him.
176 ENGLISH GRAMMAR.
2. The second species, much used both in solemn and
cheerful subjects, consists of THREE Anapaests; as,
“Whā āre they—thät nåw bid—ü's bé slaves?
They aré föes—tö the gööd—änd thé frèë.”
Sometimes, a syllable is retrenched from the first foot; as,
“Yé shëphèrds,—sö chèërfül—änd gåy,
Whöse flöcks né-ver careless |ly röam.”
3. The third kind contains Four Anapaests, or twelve
syllables; as,
“Fröm thë knäves—ánd thé fööls—änd thé föps—öf thé time;
Fröm the drüdg—és in prose—ánd thé tri-flèrs in rhyme.”
This form sometimes contains an additional syllable; as,
“'Tis thé vöice—öf the slüg—gård; I hèar—him cömpläin—ing"
The preceding are the different kinds of the principal feet, in
their simple forms. They are capable of numerous variations,
by mixing them with one another, and by the admission of the
secondary feet, the following ore specimens:
The Pyrrhic mixed with the Iambic.
“And tö– thé deåd—my will—ing shäde—shåll gö.”
The Spondee with the Iambic.
“Forbear,– great män—in arms,—forbear.”
The Trochee with the Iambic.
“Tyränt and slave,—those names—of hate—and fear.”
The secondary feet promiscuously blended.
T8 the thick woods the wool—ly flocks—retreat.
Fröm the—vāin cón—vèrse 5 f—the world—rétir’d.
And à | rich knäve's a li—-bël &n the laws.
Whèn yöu the dull est 5f-düll things have said.
And tö a life móre häp |py and—refined.
THE CAESURA,
A Caesura is a cessation of the voice and occurs imme
diately after the fourth, fifth, or sixth syllable; it also
occasionally takes place, without disadvantage, after the
third or seventh.
The dumb shall sing, the lame his crutch forego,
And leap, exulting, like the bounding roe.
Exalt thy tow'ry head, I and lift thy eyes.
Exploring till they find their native sleep.
Within that mystic circle safety seek.
Sometimes, the line requires or admits two pauses.
His cooks, through long disuse, their trade forgot.
Caesar, the world's great master, and his own.
Or pierc'd, I with half so painful grief, your breast.
POETRY. 177
DIVISION OF PoETRY.
Poetry may be divided into different species —the
epigram—epitaph—sonnet—pastoral –didactic— satirical
—descriptive—elegiac—lyric—dramatic—and epic, or
heroic.
1. An Epigram is a short and witty poem, the point or
humour of which is expressed in the latter lines.
2. The Epitaph means, literally, an inscription on a
tomb, which serves to attract the notice of the passenger.
3. The Sonnet is borrowed from the Italian, and means
a little song consisting only of fourteen lines.
4. Pastoral poetry is very ancient, and is a descrip
tion of rural objects. Pastorals are in different forms;
sometimes in that of a simple ballad or popular song,
which is indeed the most natural.
This species of poetry has, at all times, allured many
readers, and excited many writers. The Pastoral Ballad
of Shenstone is considered to be the best poem in the
English language. E. Elliott, of Sheffield, has composed
some excellent pastoral verses.
5. Didactic poetry teaches morals, philosophy, or the
arts, in versification.
6. Satiric poetry is intended to ridicule vices and
vicious characters. Satire is divided into the jocose and
ludicrous, and the serious or declamatory. The poem of
Hudibras is a specimen ofthe former, and Pope's Dunciad
of the latter kind. -
7. Descriptive poetry enters into every kind of poeti
cal composition, and is generally introduced as an embel
lishment.
8. Elegy was first employed in lamentation for the
decease of great persons, or those who were particularly
dear to the writer; it was afterwards extended to express
the misery of disappointed love, and has sometimes been
made the vehicle of moral sentiment.
9. Lyric poetry is such as is sung or set to music.
10. Dramatic poetry is a play in blank verse.
11. An Epic poem is an historical representation or
description of some important action.
Poetry has many peculiarities with regard to its grammatical
construction; it yields to no Syntactical arrangement. Poetry
admits words and phrases, which, in prose, are considered obsa.

lete. Some words are lengthened by a syllable, and others abbre
viated. Poetry uses nouns as adjectives, runs two syllables into
one, and verbs, mouns, and prepositions are omitted at the fancy
of the Poet.
EXERCISES ON PROSODY.
Scan the following verses.
Mention or write out and divide each line into feet, and distin
guish the quantity of each syllable as in the following Iambic:
Bégin my lörd, in ear |ly youth.
Tó stif fêr, māy, éncöu räge truth.
1. Alas! thou know'st not winter drear,
In snowy vest, will soon appear.
Each heart, in suffring virtue's cause,
Shall swell, amid the loud applause.
2. Earth to earth, and dust to dust!
Here the evil and the just,
Here the youthful and the old,
Here the fearful and the bold,
Here the matron and the maid,
In one silent bed are laid.
3. Not a drum was heard, nor a funeral note,
As his corpse to the ramparts we hurried,
Not a soldier discharged his farewell shot
O'er the grave where our hero was buried.
4. The fiery courser, when he hears from far
The sprightly trumpets and the shouts of war,
Pricks up his ears, and, trembling with delight,
Shifts place, and paws, and hopes the promised fight.
5. “On, Orpheus! on, Orpheus! he works on the crowd,
He sways them with harmony merry and loud.”

The search shall teach thee to prize life
And make thee good wise and grateful
Thousands bend where'er she passes
And thousands attend where she moves
Earth resumes all her verdure
And its splendour illumes heav'n
The voice the dance obey thee
To thy warbled lay temper'd
Content and joy are now fled from our dwellings
And instead disease and want are our inmates
The hotter the fight we still grow the fiercer
So we conquer the foe the loss we heed not
Adieu to the woodlands where gay and sportive
The cattle play so frolicsome light bounding
A mother may forsake her son
But I will ne'er break my covenant
We can spy faults in other men
And blame the mote that dims their eye
Find each little speck and blemish
Blind to our own stronger errors
Their board is crown'd with flow'rs by thee
Their walks resound with songs by thee
Their sprightly mornings shine by thee
And ev'ning hours decline in peace
Oh man degen'rate man no more offend
Go learn of brutes to adore thy Maker
Shall these through ev'ry scene own his bounty
Of all his works thou alone ungrateful
When the tuneful voice of mercy cries deaf
And when sov’reign goodness charms the eyes blind
Adieu to the woodlands where I have row'd oft
And with the friend that I lov’d convers'd sweetly
While I thus prolong my stay here
The silent night steals along swift
O gracious God wise and omnipotent
Ruler of the skies and unerring Lord
All condescending to my feeble heart
Impart one beam of thy celestial light
I seek not glitt'ring power nor sordid wealth
O grant me wisdom and no more I ask
While night invests the pole in solemn shade
And calm reflection sooths the soul pensive
While undisturbed reason asserts her sway
And fade away life's deceitful colours
I devote to thee all conscious presence
This peaceful interval of sober thought
Here confine all my better faculties
And be thine this hour of sacred silence
Leander bow'd to Hero's eyes
Her cheek glow’d with yielding blushes
180 ENGLISH GRAMMAR.
STYLE,
RHETORIC, AND COMPOSITION.
1. Style is the peculiar manner in which a speaker or
writer expresses his ideas to others. All that is neces
sary in the study of style may be arranged under two
heads, Perspicuity and Ornament.
2. Perspicuity signifies the conveying of our ideas
to the minds of others, so that they may understand us
without the least difficulty.
The study of perspicuity requires attention, first, to single words
and phrases, and next, to the construction of sentences.
Perspicuity considered with respect to Words & Phrases.
Perspicuity, considered with respect to words and
phrases,requires—PURITY, PROPRIETY,and PRECISION:
Purity of style consists in the use of such words and
phrases as properly belong to the idiom of the language
in which we write or speak; avoiding the adoption of
foreign, obsolete, new-coined, or ungrammatical terms.
RULE 1.—All foreign words, unless where necessity
requires them, should never be admitted into our compo
sition. Never use either Latin, French, or any other
words to express your meaning, when there are English
words of the same import. Avoid such as politesse,
hauteur, for politeness, haughtiness.
RULE 2.—Obsolete words must be avoided; such as,
behest, quoth he, behoof.
RULE 3.—Avoid new-coined words; such as martyr
ised, for martyred, encumberment, for encumberance, &c.
RULE 4.—All ungrammatical expressions must be
avoided. A violation of any grammatical rule is called
a solecism.
RULE 5.—Never abbreviate your pollysyllables; as,
extra, for extraordinary.
STYLE. 181
STUDENT.—What is style? What does perspicuity signify?

ment of some laws. 11. They have manifested great candidness
in all the transactions. 12. Methinks I am mistaken in my
opinion. 13. The disquietness of his mind was visible. 14. He
gained great rep by his discoveries.
PROPRIETY.
Propriety of language, is the selection of such words
as the best usage has appropriated to those ideas which
we mean to express by them, in opposition to vulgarisms,
or words and phrases which are either ill-chosen, or not
fully expressive of the ideas we mean to convey.
OBSERVE.-Style may be purely English without vulgarisms, or
ungrammatical, irregular expressions; and may, nevertheless, be
deficient in propriety; for the words may be ill-chosen to convey
the intended meaning.
RULE 1.—Avoid low or vulgar expressions; such
as, topsy turvy, pell mell, pro and con, hurley burley,
pop out. -
ExERCISEs.—1. They were all hurley burley in battle. 2. By
dint of assurance. 3. I heard pro and con. 4. He betrays great
weakness by bragging of his abilities. 5. He is not a whit better
than she. 6. William turned them topsy turvy. 7. He was
dancing attendance. 8. I thought him long winded. 9. When
they arrived, they fell to work. 10. I began to smell out his mo
tives. 11. I can see it with half an eye. 12. It is handed down
to us.
RULE 2.—Supply words thatare wanting; as, “Death
is the common lot of all; of good men and bad;" it
should be, of good men and of bad.
OBSERVE.—Study the observations under Rule 53, page 145.
ExERCISEs.-1. He is engaged in a treatise on the interest of
the soul and body. 2. The French tongue, in its purity, was
never spoken in England. 3. He is impressed with a true sense
of that function, when chosen from a regard to the interests of
piety and virtue.
182 ENGLISH GRAMMAR.
RULE 3.—Be careful not to use the same word too
frequently, and in different senses in the same sentence.
ExAMPLE.—“They were summoned occasionally by their kings,
when compelled, by their wants and by their fears, to have recourse
to their aid.” This sentence would be properly expressed thus;
“They were summoned occasionally by their kings, who had
recourse to their aid, whenever want or fear rendered it necessary.”
ExERCISEs.-1. Gregory favoured the undertaking, for no other
reason than this, that the manager, in countenance, favoured his
friend. 2. True wit is nature dressed to advantage, and yet some
works have more wit than does them good,
RULE 4.—Avoid equivocal words; that is, such words
as convey a different meaning from the sense you intend
to be conveyed.
ExAMPLE.—“Lisias promised to his father, never to abandon
his friends.” The second his is ambiguous; the his may refer
either to his own friends or to his father's. On the first supposi
tion, say, “Lisias, speaking of his friends, promised his father
neverto abandon them;” on the second supposition, say, “Lisias,
speaking of his father's friends, promised his father never to
abandon them.”
ExERCISEs.–1. The eagle killed the hen, and eat her in her
own nest. 2. It has been said, that not only Jesuits can equi
vocate. 3. Solomon, the son of David, who was persecuted by
Saul, was the richest monarch that reigned over theJewish people.
4. It may be justly said, that no laws are better than the English.
RULE 5.—Avoid the injudicious use of technical terms.
REMARK.—Technical phrases, not being in current use, and
the peculiar dialect only of a particular class, we should never
use them but when we know that they will be understood. Sailors
use peculiar phrases, which can be understood only among
themselves.
This rule cannot be furnished with exercises of the technical
terms used among all classes,
RULE 6.—Avoid unintelligible and inconsistent words
and phrases; such as, tip him the wink; currying favour.
These expressions are not only nonsensical, but vulgar.
CAUTIONs.—1. To prevent unintelligible composition, acquire
a clear and distinct conception of the things on which you write.
2. Never affect excellence. 3. Never use synonymous terms the
meaning of which you do not understand.
RULE 7.—Avoid all those words and phrases, which
are not adapted to the ideas which we mean to commu
nicate, or which are less significant of those ideas than
others; as, “He feels any sorrow that can arrive at
man;" it should be, “that can happen to man.”
STYLE. 183
REMARK.—One great cause of impropriety of expression is the
injudicious use of synonymous words; as, “To abdicate, renounce,
resign.” These are termed synonymous words,but do not express
the identical idea. To abdicate the throne, renounce an error,
resign an office.
Such words as the following are frequently misapplied; as,
“Doctrines, precepts, principles.” Doctrine is that which consti
tutes our faith; precept is that which directs to practise; a prin
ciple is the beginning of a thing. We believe in doctrines, obey
precepts, imbibe or hold principles.
Violations.—1. He remembered me of that subject. 2. A
fop is a risible character. 3. No less than ten were there. 4. Sha
is ashamed when spoken to. 5. James, close the door. 6. It
lays on the table. 7. I had rather not. 8. It is apparent to me.
9. He proposes to buy an estate. 10. A novel fashion. 11. An
oldish lady. 12. He begins to make rich. 13. The house is a
cold one, for it has a north exposition. 14. They shall flee as an
eagle, which hasteneth to eat. 15. He died with violence; for he
was killed by a sword.
RULE 8.—Avoid provincial expressions, and strictly
adhere to the language used by the best writers.
STUDENT.—Explain propriety. What do you mean by best
usage? To employ language that is reputable, national, andpresent.
What do you mean by reputable 2 We mean whatever modes of
speech are authorised as good, by the writers of a great number
of celebrated works. What do you mean by national 2 A lan
guage that is intelligible throughout the nation. Repeat the first
rule for Propriety. What word is preferable to the phrase shunned ?
to brag 2 cry up 2 their betters? pitch upon 2 stirred up? Repeat
the second rule; the third; the fourth; the fifth; the sixth; the
seventh; the eighth.
PRECISION.
Precision is the art of expressing, fully and properly,
our ideas; but if we wish to be precise we must avoid
using those words, which serve merely to repeat the same
idea, or some thing more than that which is intended.
RULE 1.—Avoid tautology, or the repeating of a word
or idea that has been fully expressed or implied; as,
“He returned again.” The word again is superfluous,
for return implies come again.
ExERCISEs.–1. Before I do that I must first finish this. 2.
The latter end of that man shall be peace. 3. Learn from hence
to study the Scriptures diligently. 4. I leave town in the latter
end of July. 5. Give me both of them books. 6. Lift up your
book. 7. Smoke ascends up into the clouds. 8. We were
mutually friendly to each other. 9. We must do this last of all.
10. I never fail to read whenever I can get a book. 11. The
184 ENGLISH GRAMMAR.
reason why he acted in the manner he did, was not fully ex
plained. 12. Those two boys appear to be both equal in capacity.
13. It is six months ago, since I paid a visit to my relations.
14. I hope this is the last time that I shall ever act so impru
dently. 15. This measure may afford some profit, and furnish
some amusement.
RULE 2.—Avoid that loose kind of style which abounds
with circumlocution and a multitude of words; for every
word that does not add to the meaning of a sentence,
must injure it. The admission of superfluous and syno
nymous words is called Pleonasm.
ExAMPLEs.—“I went home full of a great many serious reflec
tions.” The words a great many add nothing to the sense, they
should therefore be omitted.
A crowd of useless words is brought together by some authors,
who, being afraid of expressing themselves in an ordinary manner,
and allured by an appearance of splendour, introduce a certain
copious loquacity. The following sentence contains the intro
duction of an additional idea. When an author speaks of his
hero's courage in battle, the expression is precise, and clearly
understood; but if he praise his courage and fortitude, precision
is destroyed, for courage resists danger; fortitude supports pain:
fortitude should be omitted. -
The following common expressions are violations of this rule:–
obvious and manifest; bounds and limits; copious and full;
intents and purposes. Here, as the same idea is implied in the
same term, you must omit the words which are printed in italics.
VIoLATIONs.— 1. She treated her inferiors with haughtiness and
disdain. 2. He died with great courage and fortitude. 3. If I
mistake not, I think he is improved both in knowledge and be.
haviour. 4. He abhorred and detested being in debt. 5. He was
a man of so much pride and vanity, that he dispised the sentiments
of others. 6. He delights to worship and adore his maker. 7.
Poverty induces and cherishes dependence; and dependence
strengthens and increases corruption. 8. He behaved with great
prudence and wisdom. 9. His whole time was entirely taken up
in chat. 10. Such equivocal and ambiguous expressions, mark
a formed intention to deceive and abuse us.
NoTICE.—In some particular occasions, too great attention to
precision, is apt to betray us into a dry and barren style; to unite
copiousness and precision, to be flowing and graceful, and at the
same time correct and precise in the choice of words, is one of the
highest and the most difficult attainments in composition. In
our language there are scarcely two words that convey precisely
the same idea. Some words are like different shades of the same
colour: an accurate writer can employ them to great advantage,
by using them so as to heighten and complete the object which
he presents to us. He supplies, by one, what was wanted in the
other, to the force, or to the lustre of the image which he means
to exhibit. But, with a view to accomplish this, he must be at
tentive to the choice which he makes of them.
STYLE. 185
When we wish to express an earnestness of affirmation on an
interesting subject, we may admit superfluous words; as, “We
have seen with our eyes; and we have heard with our ears.”
STUDENT.—What is meant by precision ? Repeat the first rule.
Repeat the second. *
OF THE STRUCTURE OF SENTENCEs.
Sentences, in general, should be neither very long nor
very short. Long sentences, unless constructed with care,
require close attention to make us clearly perceive the
connexion of the several parts; and short ones are apt to
break the sense, and weaken the connexion of thought.
ExAMPLEs.—“If you look about you, and consider the lives of
others as well as your own; if you think how few are born with
honour, and how many die without name or children; how little
beauty we see, and how few friends we hear of; how much poverty,
and how many diseases there are in the world; you will fall
down upon your knees, and instead of repining at one affliction,
will admire so many blessings which you have received from the
Divine hand.” Here the sense is not clear till towards the close
of the sentence; the following construction will remove this de
fect. “If you look about you and see how little beauty there is
in the world, and think how few are born with honour, and how
many die without children or a name; how much poverty, and
how few friends; and how many diseases exist: then consider
your own life with that of others; and instead of repining at one
affliction you will fall down upon your knees and adore the Divine
Being from whom you have received so many blessings."
The following is an example of one in which the sense is formed
into short, independent propositions, each complete within itself.
“I confess, it was want of consideration that made me an author.
I wrote because it amused me. I corrected because it was as
pleasant to me to correct as to write. I published because I was
told I might please such as it was a credit to please.”
A train either of long or short sentences should be avoided; so
must also sentences similarly constructed, and having the same
number of members; for the ear tires with a perpetual uniformity.
On the contrary, by a proper mixture of long and short sentences,
and of those variously constructed, not only is the ear gratified;
but also animation and force are given to our style. -
The properties most essential to form a perfect sentence, are,
1st. Clearness or Perspicuity; 2nd. Unity; 3rd. Energy; 4th.
Harmony.
OF THE CLEARNEss or PERSPICUITY OF A
SENTENCE.
1. Clearness, respects our ideas; Perspicuity, the mode
of expressing those ideas.
186 ENGLISH GRAMMAR.
2. To avoid errors, we must strictly attend to the gram
matical arrangement of the sentence. But as syntactical
rules do not comprehend every case, an ambiguous ar
rangement of words may frequently be observed, when
we can discover no transgression of any syntactical rule.
RULE 1.—Obscurity is frequently occasioned by mis
placing the adverb and especially the word only.
ExAMPLEs.—“I only bought three books.” As the word only
stands in the sentence, it implies that something else should have
been done with the books besides buying them; on the contrary
it alludes to the number, and should have been expressed thus,
“I bought only three books.”
I have fully explained the position of the adverb under Rule 27,
page i 19; also, Rules 1 and 2, page 120; to which you must now
turn.
RULE 2.—Ambiguity is frequently made by misplacing
some circumstance, or particular member in the middle of
the sentence; this should be avoided.
ExAMPLE.—Are these designs which any man who is born a
Briton, in any circumstance, in any situation, ought to be ashamed
or afraid to avow.” Observe, the circumstantial or particular
member is in italics. We are left at a loss to know what the
author intends to be understood; yet we presume the sentence
should be “Are these designs, of which any man who is born a
Briton ought to be ashamed or afraid, in any circumstances, in
any situation, to avow.”
ExERCISEs.—1. The embarrassments of the artificers, rendered
the progress very slow of the work. 2. They are now engaged in
a study, of which they have long wished to know the usefulness.
3. The emperor refused to convert at once, the truce into a defini
tive treaty. 4. However the miserable remains were, in the night,
taken down. 5. He was a man of the greatest prudence, virtue,
justice, and modesty. 6. His labours to acquire knowledge have
been productive of great satisfaction and success.
RULE 3.—Ambiguity is frequently created by the im
proper position of the relative pronouns, who, which,
what, that, and whose. See Syntax, Rule 37, page 129.
The following sentence will tend to illustrate this rule. “It is
a folly to pretend to arm ourselves against the accidents of life, by
heaping up treasures, which nothing can protect us against, but
the good providence of our heavenly Father.” This construction
implies that it is treasure, and not the accidents of life; from which
no mortal can protect himself by his own exertions. The sentence
should have been thus:—“It is folly to pretend, by heaping up
treasures, to arm ourselves against the accidents of life, against
which nothing, &c.”
STYLE. 187
ExERCISEs.—l. They attacked Northumberland's house, whom
they put to death. 2. They are the master's rules who must be
obeyed. 3. It is true what he says, but it is not applicable to the
point. 4. He was taking a view, from a window, of the Cathedral
in Lichefield, where a party of the royalists had fortified
themselves. * -
RULE 3.—Circumstantial clauses, however, should not
be crowded together, but be interspersed in different parts
of the sentence, and joined with the principal words on
which they depend.
ExAMPLE.—What I had the opportunity of mentioning to my
friend, sometime ago, in conversation, was not a new thought.” The
following arrangement is preferable; “ at I had an oppor
tunity, sometime ago, of mentioning to my friend, in conversation,
was not a new thought.”
RULE 5.—Never place a circumstantial clause, by way
of simile, between two principal members of a period.
ExAMPLE.—“The minister of state, who grows less by his ele
vation, like a little statue on a mighty pedestal, will always have his
jealousy strong about him.”
OBSERVE.—The words in italics are the circumstantial clause
introduced by way of simile, but it is doubtful whether it relates
to what goes before, or to what follows. We presume the sentence
ought to be constructed thus; “The minister of state who, like a
little statue placed on a mighty pedestal, grows less by his elevation,
will always, &c.” *
Rule 6.—when the sense admits it, the sooner the
circumstantial clause is introduced the better, that the
more important words may possess the last place.
ExAMPLE.—“The emperor was so intent on the establishtment
of his absolute power in hungary, that he exposed the empire
doubly to desolation and ruin for the sake of it.” This sentence is
faulty; better thus, according to rule: “The emperor was so in
tent on the establishment of his absolute power in Hungary, that,
for the sake of it, he exposed the empire doubly to desolation and
ruin.”
RULE 7.—When different things have an obvious rela
tion to one another, with respect to the order of time,
place, cause, and effect, a corresponding order should
be regarded, in assigning them their positions in the
Sentence.
ExAMPLE.—“Ambition creates seditions, wars, discords, hatred,
and shiness.” We should say, “Ambition creates hatred, shiness,
discords, seditions, and wars.”
RULE 8.—Considerable obscurity arises from the too
frequent use of the pronouns who, they, them, and theirs,
188 ENGLISH GRAMMAR.
especially when we have to speak of different persons.
This should be avoided by substituting appropriate words.
OF THE UNITY of A SENTENCE.
By unity is meant that connexion of the several parts
with one proposition, object, or design which is found in
every sentence.
ObsBRVE.—A sentence implies one proposition; it may consist
of parts, but these must be so intimately connected, as to make
the impression on the mind, of but one principal subject.
RULE 1.—Never crowd into one sentence objects that
have so little connexion, thatthey could bear to be divided
into two or more sentences.
ExAMPLE.—“The march of the Greeks was through an uncul
tivated part or the country, whose savage inhabitants fared hardly,
having no other than a breed of lean sheep, whose flesh was rank
and unsavoury, by reason of their continual feeding upon sea
fish.” Here, the change of the scene is frequent. The march of
the Greeks, the description of the inhabitants through whose
country they travelled, the account of their sheep, and the cause
of their sheep being ill-tasted food, form a jumble of objects diffi
cult to be comprehended under one view.
RULE 2.—Never insert parentheses in the middle of
a sentence, when it can be avoided. When the paren
theses '' short, and serve as necessary explanations,
they may be admitted; but generally they may be trans
ferred to the following sentence:—
ExAMPLEs.—1. A parenthesis is introduced in its proper place;
as,
“And was the ransom paid? It was; and paid
(What can exalt the bounty more?) for thee.”
2. “If your hearts secretly reproach you for the wrong choice
you have made, (as there is time for repentance; and a return to
wisdom is always honourable) bethink yourself that the evil is
not irreparable.” It would be much better to put the parenthesis
into a separate sentence; thus, “If your hearts secretly reproach
you for the wrong choice you have made, bethink yourselves that
‘the evil is not irreparable. Still there is time for repentance;
and a return to wisdom is always honourable.”
RULE 3.—Let your sentence be complete and brought
to its natural close, but not extended beyond it; for
appendages are destructive both to strength and unity.
ExAMPLE.—The following sentence is improper in this respect.
“With these writings young divines are more conversant than
with those of Demosthenes, who by many degrees excelled the
other, at least as an orator.” The natural close of the sentence
STYLE. 189 |
is at these words, “excelled the other.” The sentence is better
thus; “With these writings young divines are more conversant
than with those of Demosthenes, who, by many degrees, as an
orator at least, excelled the other.”
RULE 4.—During the course of the sentence, the scene
should be changed as little as possible.
ExAMPLE.—“After we came to anchor, they put me ashore
where I was welcomed by all my friends, who received me with
the greatest kindness.” The fault is, in shifting so often both
the place and the person, we and they, I and who ; the sense is
weakened, and the unity of the sentence is impared. Correct
thus, “Having come to an anchor, I was put on shore, where I
was welcomed by all my friends, and received with the greatest
kindness.”
OF THE STRENGTH OF ENERGY of A SENTENCE.
Strength or energy comprehends everything that con
duces to stimulate attention, to impress strongly on the
mind the arguments adduced, to excite the imagination,
and to arouse the feelings.
RULE 1.—Care must be taken to avoid a redundancy
of words and members.
ExAMPLEs.–1. On a redundancy of words. “They returned
back again to the same city from whence they came forth.” The
five words, back, again, same,from, and forth, are superfluous. 2.
On a redundancy of members. “The very discovery ofbeauty
strikes the mind with inward joy, and spreads delight through all
its faculties.” Here the second member is little more than an echo
of the first.
RULE 2.—Attend to the use of relatives, copulatives,
prepositions, and all the particles employed for transition
and connexion. (See Rules 34, 43, and 46.)
ExAMPLEs.—“There w nothing which disgusts us sooner than
the empty pomp of language.” Had, “there is,” and, “which"
been omitted, the strength of the sentence would have been
greatly increased.
RULE 3.—Let the members or propositions of the
sentence go on rising and growing as they approach the
end. (See climaa, in Rhetoric.)
ExAMPLE.—Charity breaths habitual kindness towards friends,
conrtesy towards strangers, long suffering to enemies.
N.B.—When a sentence consists of two members, the longe
should generally be the concluding one.
RULE 4.—Never conclude a sentence either with an
adverb, a preposition, or any inconsiderable word. (See
Rules 27 and 43.)
190 ENGLISH GRAMMAR.
RULE 5.—In the members of a sentence where either
resemblance or contrast is designed, some resemblance
in the language and construction should be preserved.
ExAMPLE.—“The wise man is happy when he gains his own
approbation: the fool when he recommends himself to the applause
of those about him.” The sentence should have been expressed
thus; “The wise man is happy when he gains his own approba
tion, the fool when he gains that of others.”
OBSERVE.—Such sentences when constructed with propriety
and not too frequently introduced, have a sensible beauty. But
when such construction as this is uniformly aimed at, our com
position becomes tedious to the ear, and the hearer plainly dis
covers affectation.
RULE 6.—Dispose of the principal or most important
words in that situation of a sentence in which they will
make the fullest impression. Whatever is intended to
strike the attention, should be placed at the beginning of
a Sentence.
ExAMPLE.—“The cripple who sat begging at the beautiful gate
of the temple, earnestly looked on Peter and John, expecting to
receive something; Peter said to him, “Silver and gold have I
none, but such as I have, give I thee; in the name of Jesus of
Nazareth, rise up and walk.’”
Sometimes when we intend to give weight to a sentence, the
important clause should be preserved till the conclusion; as, “On
whatever side we contemplate Homer, what principally strikes us,
is his wonderful invention.”
THE HARMONY of A SENTENCE.
Harmony implies an agreeable and smooth flow of
words in respect of the sound of the sentence, as well as,
that agreeable sound or modulation of the voice which
£ the ear. Noble and pleasing ideas, strong and
orcible reasoning, conveyed in harmonious language,
produce a deeper impression on the mind than if trans
mitted by means of harsh and disagreeable language.
RULE 1.—Avoid words which are difficult of pronun
ciation, for they are generally harsh and painful to the
ear.
RULE 2.—To produce an agreeable sound or melody,
such words must be chosen as are composed of smooth
and liquid sounds, with a just proportion of vowels and
CGnSOnantS.
STYLE. 191
OBSERVE.—Long words are commonly more agreeable to the
ear than monosyllables. They please by the composition or suc
cession of sounds which they present to the ear.
RULE 3.—Avoid those words which are composed of
words already compounded, the several parts of which are
not well united; as, “Tenderheartedness, shamefaced
ness,” &c.
RULE 4.—Avoid such wordsas have the syllables which
immediately follow the accented syllable, crowded with
consonants that do not easily coalesce; as, “Question
less, conventiclers,” &c.
RULE 5.—Avoid such words as have too many sylla
bles following the accented syllable; as, “Curiosity,
peremptoriness.”
RULE 6.—You must not use such words as have a
recurrance of the same, or of similar syllables; as, “Ho
lily, sillily.
OBSERVE. –It is necessary, in order to render the sentence har
monious, not only thatthe words should be well chosen and well
sounding, but also, that they should be properly arranged. The
following sentence is remarkably harmonious: “We shall con
duct you to a hill-side, laborious, indeed, at the first ascent; but
else, so smooth, so green, so full ofgoodly prospects and melodious
sounds on every side, that the harp of Orpheus was not more
charming.”
The words in this sentence are, well-chosen; full of liquids and
soft sounds; laborious, smooth, goodly, melodious, charming; and
these words so artfully arranged, that were we to alter the collo
cation of any of them, the melody would be injured.
RULE 8.—To promote the harmonious arrangement of
words, when the preceding word ends with a vowel, let
the following begin with a consonant; and the contrary;
thus, “a true friend, a cruel enemy,” are smoother and
easier to the voice, than, “a true union, a cruel de
stroyer.”
RULE 9.—In general, a number of long or short words
near one another should be avoided.
ExAMPLEs.— 1. “Disappointment in our expectations is
wretchedness.” It should be, “disappointed hope is misery.”
2. “No course of joy can please us long.” It is better to say,
“no course of enjoyment can please us long.”
RULE 10.—Avoid a succession of words which have the
same quantity in the accented syllable.
192 ENGLISH GRAMMAR.
ExAMPLEs.—“They could not be happy; for he was silly,
pettish, and sullen;” better say, “They could not be happy, for
he was simple, peevish, and gloomy.”
2. “James was needy, feeble and fearful:” better say, “James
was timid, fearful, and destitute.”
RULE 11.—In general words beginning alike, or end
ing alike, must not come together; and the last syllable
of the preceding word should not be the same as the first
syllable of the following one.
ExAMPLEs.—1. “This is a convenient contrivance;" it is more
harmonious to say, “This is a useful contrivance.” 2. “She
behaves with uniform formality;” to say, “She behaves with
unvaried formality,” is more harmonious.
RULE 12.—The members of a sentence should not be
too long, nor disproportionate to each other; but the
rests should be distributed so as to make the course of
breathing easy, and, should fall at such distances as to
bear a musical proportion. They should also go on in
creasing in importance and length to the close of the
Sentence. *
ExAMPLEs.— 1. The following sentence is a breach of this rule.
“This discourse concerning the easiness of the Divine commands
does, all along, suppose and acknowledge the difficulties of the
first entrance upon a religious course; except only in those per
sons who have had the happiness to be trained up to religion by
the easy and sensible degrees of a pious and virtuous education."
The fault of this sentence is owing to the great length of the two
members into which the sentence is divided; as there is but one
considerable pause, there is too great a stress of the breath in
pronouncing it.
2. The following is an example in which the different members
are proportionately arranged. “But his pride is greater than his
ignorance, and what he wants in knowledge, he supplies by suffi
ciency. When he has looked about him, as far as he can, he
concludes, there is no more to be seen; his own reason he holds
to be the certain measure of truth; and his own knowledge, of
what is possible in nature.” (Read Habakkuk, 3 c. 17and 18 v.)
RULE 13.—Let there be nothing harsh or abrupt in
the close ofa sentence; the longest members of the period,
and the fullest and most sonorous words must be reserved
for the conclusion.
ExAMPLEs.-1. The following is a breach of this rule:—“The
doctrine of the Trinity is a mystery which we firmly believe the
truth of, and humbly adore the depth of.” This might have been
rendered harmonious, by this transposition:—“The doctrine of
the Trinity is a mystery of which we firmly believe the truth, and
the depth of which we humbly adore.” (See Rule 43; also,
remark 1, page 134.)
RHETORIC. 193
RHETORIC OR FIGURATIVE STYLE.
RHEToRIC is considered to be a study of the highest importance;
while Greece and Rome were free, it was almost the only passport
to distinction and power; and in modern times, the knowledge of
its rules is essential to every one who wishes to become eminent,
either in the pulpit, on the platform, in the senate, or at the bar.
It is a study which exercises our reason without fatiguing it.
It strews flowers in the path of science, forms a pleasing relief to
the more toilsome labours to which the mind must submit in the
acquirement of erudition or the investigation of truth.
When we employ words that describe things by their own
names, our language is said to be plain or literal; but, when we
introduce others, that are substituted instead of these names, our
language is then denominated figurative. Thus, when we say, “A
person has a fine taste in wines,” the word, taste, has its plain or
literal signification; but, when we say, “He has a fine taste for
painting, poetry, or music,” we employ itfiguratively.
Figures are the most natural and the most common method of
uttering our sentiments; they are part of that language which
nature dictates, and are frequently used by the illiterate and vul
gar, as well as by the learned and refined.
Figures are generally divided into two great classes; figures of
words and figures of thought; the former are usually called Tropes,
the latter simply Figures.
A Trope consists in a word's being employed to signify some
thing that is different from its original meaning, so that if we alter
the word we destroy the figure. Thus, “Light ariseth to the up
right in darkness;” the Trope consists in “light and darkness”
not being meant literally, but substituted for comfort and for
adversity, on account of some resemblance or analogy which light
and darkness are supposed to bear to these conditions in life.
Tropes and Figures enrich language, and render it more copi
ous; they bestow dignity upon style; and impart to us the
pleasure of viewing two objects at once without confusion; lastly,
they frequently give us a much clearer and more striking view of
the principal object, than if it were expressed in simple terms,
and divested of its figurative dress.
RHETORICAL TROPE.S.
* The principal Tropes (from Tporos, a turning) are seven;–
1. Metaphor; 2. Allegory: 3. Metonymy; 4. Synecdoche; 5.
Irony; 6. Hyperbole; 7. Catachresis.
1. A Metaphor (Merapopa, a transferring) is founded on the
resemblance which one object is supposed to bear in some particu
lar respect to another.
R
194 ENGLISH GRAMMAR.
ExAMPLE.-“Thy word is a lamp to my feet.” The word lamp
is the metaphor employed to express the enlightening influence of
the Word of God upon the human mind; for as a lamp directs us
on our way in the dark, so does the Divine Word of God instruct
us in the course of conduct which we are to pursue. (See Psalm
18–2. Duter. 32–13.
OBSERVE.— 1. Metaphors must be suited to the nature of the
subject of which we treat, neither too elevated nor too mean for it,
that we may neither attempt to force the subject to a degree
of elevation which is not consistant with it, nor on the other hand,
allow it to sink below its proper dignity.
2. The resemblance between two objects and the idea intended
to be conveyed, must be perspicuous, neither far-fetched nor
difficult to discover.
3. Never intermix metaphorical and plain language.
4. Different metaphors ought never to be employed in describ
ing the same subject. The violation of this rule is called a mixed
metaphor.
5. Metaphors must never be pursued too far. When we dwell
too long upon the resemblance on which the figure is founded,
and carry it into all its minute circumstances, we fatigue the
hearer with this play of fancy, and render our discourse obscure.
This is called straining a metaphor.
2. An Allegory (ANAmyopia, speaking otherwise,) is a continua
tion of several metaphors, so connected in sense, as to form a
kind of parable or fable. *
ExAMPLE.— Psalm 80, v. 8 to 17. Ezekiel, 17 c. 22–24 v.
3. Metonymy (Merovvuta, change of name,) is a change ofname,
or putting the cause for the effect, or the effect for the cause, the
container for the thing contained, the sigm for the thing signified; as
when we say, “I am reading Virgil,” that is, his works. “Grey
hairs should be respected;” that is, old age. “The kettle boils;”
means the water. “He assumes the sceptre;” that is, He assumes
the sovereignty.
4. Synecdoche (Suverãoxn, a taking together,) is when the whole
is put for a part, or a part for the whole; as, “The waves for the
sea;” “the head for the person;" “ten thousand for a great
number.”
5. Irony (Eupova, Dissimulation) is frequently used by way of
jest, and banter, insult or derision. Irony is intended to
convey a contrary idea to that which the words import; as, “O
wise and valiant hero !” means, “O foolish coward.”
N.B. Ifyou meetwith a person who frequently speaks ironically,
abandon his company, for he is a lying and deceitful person, as
the word originally implies.
6. An Hyperbole (Yrspßo\m, Excess,) is a figure which goes
beyond the truth, and represents things greater or smaller, better
or worse, than they are; thus, “He runs swifter than the wind,"
for very swift.
RHETORIC. 195
7. Catachresis (Karaxonoic, abuse) borrows the name of one
thing to express another, which has either no name of its own, or,
if it has, the borrowed name is more agreeable; as, “And there
was set there six water-pots of stone.”
FIGURES OF THOUGHT.
Figures of thought, or simply figures, are those which lie wholly
in the thought, the words being taken in their proper and literal
sense, and the figure consists in the turn of the sentiment.
The principal figures of thought are,
1. The Parabole, or Simile (IIapa/30\m, SIMILIs, resemblance
or comparison) of some one particular thing, between two objects
which are in themselves dissimilar and belonging to different
species; thus, we can say of a man, “He is as firm as a rock.”
The comparison is generally expressed by such words as, like,
as, so, thus, such, compared with, &c.
2. Antithesis (Avri6egic, Opposition,) contrast or opposition of
two objects of the same species. Contrast always makes things
appear to greater advantage; as, “The wicked flee when no man
pursueth, but the righteous are bold as a lion.”
3. Prosopopaeia (IIpogotro:toua, Feigning a person, or personi
fication,) is the figure by which we attribute life and action to
inanimate objects; as, “The sea saw it and fled.”
This is one of the boldest and the finest figures: you must
never attempt it, unless prompted by strong passion, and do not
continue it when that passion begins to flag. Never personify
any object that has not some dignity in itself, and cannot make a
proper figure in the elevation to which you wish to raise it.
4. Climax (KAua#, a ladder.) or amplification, rises by regular
steps, from one circumstance to another, till the thoughts cannot
be carried to a greater elevation.
ExAMPLE.——What a piece of work is man! how noble in reason!
how infinite in faculties! in form and moving, how express and
admirable ! in action, how like an angel; in apprehension how
like a god. (Read Rom. 8 c. 38 and 39 v.)
5. Apostrophe (Atroarpopn, a turning away,) consists in addres
sing persons that are either dead or absent, or even inanimate
things, as if they were endowed with sense and reason; as, “Death
is swallowed up in victory: O death, where is thy sting?” Read
1 Cor. 15 c. 54 and 55 v. Luke 13 c. 34 v.
6. Erotesis (Eptormouc, interrogation or questioning) is a figure
by which we express the emotion of our mind, and infuses an
ardour and energy into our discourse, by proposing questions.
ExAMPLE.–“ Hath the Lord said it 2 and shall he not do it?
Hath he spoken it? and shall he not make it good?”
7. Ecphonesis (Expowmaic, Eaclamation,) is a figure which
shews that the mind labours with agitated feelings, admiration,
wonder, surprise, anger, joy, or some vehement passion.
K 2
196 ENGLISH GRAMMAR.
ExAMPLE.—“O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and
the knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments,
and his ways past finding out!”
8. Oxymoron (0%vuopov, a witty, foolish saying,) or seeming
contradiction, is a figure which expresses an idea which at first
appears absurd: as, “Affected simplicity; proud humility.”
9. Periphrasis (IIspuppaaic, Circumlocution,) is the using of a
number of words to express one idea.
ExAMPLE.—“And now the distant villages smoke, and the
.**
shadows fall larger from the lofty mountains;” in brief language,
it was sunset.
10. Epamaphora (Eravapopa, Repetition,) or words frequently
repeated; as, “Though fall'n on evil days,
On evil days though fall'n, and evil tongues.”
11. Anasthrophe (Avaaroopm, Inversion,) is a figure by which
we alter the natural order of a sentence, placing that last which
should be first; as, “Arms and the man I sing;” instead of, “I
sing of arms and the man.”
12. Hypotyposis (YTortroduc, Representation,) or a description
of things in such vivid colours, as to make them seem present to
the imagination; as, “He stood erect on tiptoe, and fearless
stretched his arms on high to the Gods.”
13. Asyndeton (Arvyčerov, no copulative,) is the omission of
copulative conjunctions, and it expresses energy and urgent haste;
as, “Bring flaming brands quickly, spread your sails, impel your
oars.” Read Gal. 5 c. 1923 v.)
14. Polysyndeton (IIoMwavvčerov, many copulative,) is a figure
by which we join or dis-join a long train of nouns. For example
read Romans, 8 c. 35 v. to the end.
15. Aposiopesis (Atrogiornotc, a ceasing to speak, or pause) is a
sudden breaking off in the middle of a sentence; such a pause is
often eloquent; as, “Whom I but first it is proper to compose
the swelling waves.” -
16. Prolepsis (IIpoxmibic, Anticipation) is a figure by which a
speaker anticipates objections that may be raised and answers
them; as, “Perhaps some will say if the sun is not fire he cannot
be the dispenser of heat; to this I answer,” &c. Read 1 Cor.
15 c. 35 to 38 v.
17.—Epanorthosis (ETravo96ogic, correct) or recall what we
have spoken, for the purpose of substituting something stronger
or more suitable; as, “I have an only son, a young man. Ah!
what have I said? I have a son 2 Not so, I had.”
ExAMPLE.—“What is it, then, can give men the heart and
courage—but I recall that word, because it is not true courage,
but foolhardiness, to outbrave the judgment of God?”
18. Apophasis (Atropagic, omission) is a figure by which the
speaker pretends to conceal and omit what he is really declaring
and strongly enforcing; as, “I say nothing of your drunkenness
and debauchery, I pass over your riotous conduct.”
RHETORIC. 197
19. Synchoresis (>vvywpngic, concession) a yielding up some.
thing in order to gain some more weighty or important point; as,
“I grant that he is a sacrilegious robber, and the chief in every
kind of wickedness, yet he is a good commander.”
20. Anacaenosis (Avakouvøgic, communication).
21. Epiphonema (Etripovnpa, acclamation) is a sentence con
taining some lively remark; as, “Dwells such wrath in celestial
minds.”
22. Antonomasia (Avrovouaoua, instead of a name) imparts pro
per names from country, kindred, or epethets; as, “The mighty
Stagirite first left the shore.” This means Aristotle, born at
Stagira.
RHETORICAL TURNS OR REPETITION.
Beside Tropes or Figures, there are many Rhetorical Turns
or Repetitions, which add greatly to elegance of diction and to the
beauty of composition.
Repetitions, or fine turns, are such as gracefully repeat either
the same words; or, the same sound in different words. The
following are the principal:
1. Anaphora (Avapopa, Rehearsal) or the commencing ofseveral
clauses with the same words.
ExAMPLE.—By foreign hands thy dying-eyes were clos'd;
By foreign hands thy decent limbs compos'd;
By foreign hands thy humble grave adorn'd;
By strangers honour'd, and by strangers mourn'd.
2. Epistrophe (ETruarpopm, a turning to) is a closing of sen
tences with the same word either in verse or prose.
ExAMPLE.—We do pray for mercy;
And that same prayer doth teach us all to render
The deeds of mercy.
3. Symploce (X'vptAokm, a complication) is the connexion both
of Anaphora and Epistrophe.
ExAMPLE.-“Sing praises to God, sing praises; sing praises
unto our king, sing praises.”
4. Epizeuxis ("Ett'sváic, a joining together) repeats immediately
the same words; as, “In a dying, dying fall.”
5. Anadiplosis (Avačut)\ogic, Reduplication) is when the second
line begins with the same word as that which ended the first; as,
“Love God, God is worthy to be loved.”
6. Epanalepsis (ETrava)\mbic, Repetition) is when the same
word or phrase begins and ends a line;sas,
Reft of thy sons, amid thy foes forlorn,
Mourn, widow’d queen, forgotten Sion, mourn
198 ENGLISH GRAMMAR.
7. Epanodos (Eravočoc, Regression) is a figure which when it
has arrived at the middle of a phrase, retraces its steps to the
beginning; as, “Woe unto them that call evil good, and good
evil.”
8. Polyptoton (IIo\varroro”, many cases) is a figure which
signifies a change of cases, number, &c.; as, “Vanity of vanities,
all is vanity.”
9. Antanaclasis (AvravarAagic, Reciprocation) is the using of
a word to express more meanings than one; as, “Let the dead
bury their dead.” Here the former dead has a different meaning
from the latter. When this figure is used as a species of wit it
is called a Pun. -
10. Paronomasia (IIapovouagua, Agnomination, likeness of words,
is the using of words alike in sound, but different in sense; as,
“Thou art Peter, and upon this Petra (rock) I will build my
church.”
NoTE.–In this figure, is included Alliteration, or the commenc.
ing of several words with the same letter; as, “And be by,
blessing, beauty, blest.”—Johnson.
11. Homoioteleuton ('Ouotors.Asvrov, a like ending) is a figure
which makes two members of a sentence rhyme with each other;
as,
Now under hanging mountains,
Besides the falling fountains,
Or where Hebrus wanders,
Rolling in meanders.
Taedet quotidianarum harum formarum.
- Terence.

(name appellation) can with (justness propriety) be made to bear,

art of reasoning. It (investigates examines) the (principles doc
trines) on which argumentation is conducted, and (furnishes sup
plies) rules to (procure secure) the mind from (wrong error) in its
deductions. Its most (judicious appropriate) office, however, is
that of (making instituting) an analysis of the process of the mind
in (arguing reasoning;) and in this (light point of view,) it is, as
has been (stated said,) strictly completely) a science: while con
sidered in (reference respect) to the practical rules above men
tioned, it may be (denominated called) the art of reasoning. On
the utility of logic, many writers have said (much a great deal)
with which I cannot (coincide agree with,) and which has (tended
been a means) to bring the study into unmerited disrepute. By
(honouring respecting) logic as (furnishing supplying) the (sole
whole) instrument for the (discovery inventing) of truth in all
subjects, and as (instructing teaching) the use of the intellectual
faculties (generally in general,) they raised (desires expectations)
which could not be realized, and which naturally led to a reaction.
The (complete whole) system, whose (unfounded ungrounded)
(intentions pretensions) had been thus blazoned (abroad forth,)
has come to be (generally commonly) regarded as utterly futile
and empty; like (many several) of our most valuable medicines,
which, when first (issued introduced) were proclaimed (each every
one) as a panacea, infallible in the most (diametrically opposite)
disorders; and which, consequently, in many instances, fell for a
time into (complete total) disuse; (though, although,) after a long
interval, they were (established instituted) in their just estimation,
and employed conformably to their real properties.”

those subjects which are intimately connected in sense.
1. Grammar is necessary in the most important questions con

which all literature, properly so called, ought to be raised, is a
competent knowledge of our own language.

sword: myself you may drive forth a houseless, childless beggar,
or load with fetters of slavery; but the hatred I feel to your oppres

rains our seasons, yet our sullen skies and fields without a flower,
I would not exchange for warmer France with all her vines.
4. On came the evening. There was over all the land deep
silence; and though the sun in murky clouds went down, yet,
that he would not rise at morning dawn in wonted brilliancy, none
dreamed. Butnot long were men keptin suspense. Before midnight,
were heard over all the district, unusual noises. The ocean became
agitated without any apparent cause; down fell the rain in tor
rents—a perfect deluge! The ground heaved; the houses and
trees shook; up sprang a tremendous hurricane; quick darted
the lightening. And with pale lips, men whispered, “An earth
quake! an earthquake!” The earthquake it was: and that night
the city of Peruvians ceased to be!
RULE 3.—Express the same sentiment in various
ways; this will enable the pupil to deliver his sentiments
with clearness and propriety.

the pupil to read some book treating on those particular
classes of persons, piaces, and things; then let him write
what he can from memory, and, after, let a comparison
be made between his own composition and the original.
THEMEs.
The import of the word Theme, is a “subject on which
one speaks or writes; the original word whence others
are derived.”
- SIMPLE THEMEs.
A Simple Theme is generally divided into
1. The definition, by which we explain the nature or
meaning of the subject. -
COMPOSITION. 209
2. The cause, by which we shew the origin of the sub
ject; that is, from what it proceeds.
3. Antiquity or novelty, under which we shew what it
was in the ancient, and what it is in modern times.
4. Universality or locality, under which we shew
whether the subject relates to the whole world, or only to
a particular part of it.
5. Effects, by which we shew whether the influence of
the subject has been injurious or beneficial.
6. The conclusion, in which we make such observations
as may be suggested by a careful investigation of the
whole subject.
EXAMPLE OF A SIMPLE THEME (from Walker.)
DEFINITION.—Education may be properly defined to be the
culture of the human mind.
CAUSE.—As every parent knows how much the happiness of his
child depends upon its proper education, it is no wonder that he
bestows so much care and attention upon this important subject.
ANTIQUITY.—The Greeks and Romans, among whom were pro
duced such prodigies of excellence in every kind of writing, and
in every department of civil and military life, were remarkably
attentive to the education of their children; so much so, that they
began their education almost at their birth.
NovELTY.—Various are the modes of education which have
been adopted among the moderns; but most, if not all of them,
seem to be greatly inferior to the strict discipline and methodical
instruction of the ancients.
UNIVERSALITY.—All nations pay attention to this essential duty
of parents; even the savage takes care to instruct his child in
hunting, fishing, and those branches of knowledge which are neces
sary for him.
LoCALITY.—But in no part of the world has education been
brought to such perfection as in civilized countries; here, its
importance is properly estimated; and in no part of science has
the human mind been more exerted than in the improvement of
education. Men of the greatest attainments have not thought it
unworthy of their attention.
ADVANTAGES.–Nothing can shew the advantages of a good
education in a stronger light, than a contrast with the disadvan
tages of a bad one. A person of good education has his mind and
body so cultivated and improved, that his natural defects are
removed, and the beauties of both placed in so fine a light, that
they strike with double force. But he who has had the misfor
tune of a bad education, has all his natural imperfections remain
ing, with the addition of artificial ones, arising from bad habits,
or from persuing improper studies. The former engages the
2] 0 ENGLISH GRAMMAR.
attention of those with whom he converses, by the good sense he
shews on every subject, and the agreeable manner in which he
conveys it. The other disgusts every company into which he
enters, either by his total silence and stupidity, or by the igno
rance and impertinence of his observations. The one raises him
self to the notice of his superiors, and advances himselfto a higher
rank in life: the other is obliged to act an inferior part among his
equals in fortune, and is sometimes forced to conceal his igno
rance by associating with the lowest orders of mankind.
Observe.—The first thing the pupil must do in theme writing,
is to know the exact meaning of the term which is the subject
of the theme. He must ask the questions—What is
2. What is its cause ? 3. What is its novelty and antiquity ? 4.
What is its extent 2 5. What is its advantages 2 Answers to these
questions will supply him with an idea of arrangement.
RULE 1.—In explaining a term avoid using the same
word as that which stands for the thing to be explained.
Most of our Lexicographers have violated this rule.
VIoLATIONs.—Abdication is the act of abdicating. Resumption
the act of resuming. Retortion the act of retorting.
The above will be sufficient to shew the pupil what I mean.
They are taken from “Walker's Dictionary,” from which hundreds
may be selected.
RULE 2.—Avoid verbiage in argument. (See Pre
cision.)
VIoIATIONs.--1. Lose this, and all is lost and forfeited. 2. That
is the woeful and solemn hour, when deceit and hypocrisy drop
their mask, and when borrowed virtues vanish and disappear. 3.
When the world was in a state of comparative barbarism, the art
of printing, like the sun, emerged from the darkened horizon of
our world, and pursued its triumphant course through the heavens:
at its approach, ignorance and barbarism fled away; its benignant
and vivifying influence dispelled the clouds of ignorance which
enveloped our sublunary world; its genial rays enlivened the
universe, whilst its beams brought to light the stores of knowledge.
RULE 3.–Give a definition, state the cause, shew the
antiquity, describe the advantages and disadvantages of
the following.
1. Writing. 2. History. 3. Printing. 4. Music. 5. War.
6. Peace. 7. Astronomy. 8. Grammar. 9. Commerce. 10.
Manufactures. 11. Christianity. 12. Redemption. 13. Agri
culture. 14. Society.
Write on the miseries of war. On eternity. On slavery. On
freedom. On your youthful days. On the orphan. On home.
On the power of God. On confidence in God. Make a contrast
between vice and virtue. Why should we be industrious? Shew
the ill consequences of irregular attendance at school. State the
nature, the cause, and effects of envy.
COMPOSITION. 21]
CoMPLEx THEMEs.
Complea. Themes express a judgment which admits of
proof and illustration. These are generally divided into—
1. The proposition, in £we define the subject of
the theme, or the extent of the affirmation or negation.
2. The reason, containing the arguments which we
employ to prove the truth of them.
3. The confirmation of the proposition by suitable
arguments. -
4. The simile is something in nature or art similar to
what is affirmed in ourtheme, andintroduced for the pur
pose of illustrating the truth.
5. The example is an instance drawn from history or
experience, to corroborate what has been advanced.
6. The testimony or quotation consists of some passage
from good authors to shew that others entertain the
same opinion of the subject.
7. In the conclusion we sum up the whole, and de
monstrate the practical use of the theme, by concluding
with some appropriate observations.
AN EXAMPLE OF A COMPLEX THEME (from R. Hiley)
The importance of checking the first approach of vice.
PROPOSITION.—Nothing is more important in the moral conduct
of life, than to watch the beginnings of evil and to check them as
soon as possible.
REASON.—Evil propensities are easily conquered at first, and
require only a small share of resolution to resist them; but if we
suffer them to become habitual, by flattering ourselves that we
can resist them when we please, we shall, in all probability, fall a
sacrifice to them.
CoNFIRMATION.—For, as it is the nature of evil habits to gather
strength, and grow stronger every day, so the power of resisting
them becomes proportionably weaker, till atlast we are completely
enslaved by them.
SIMILE.—Nothing is more inculcated by judicious physicians
than the necessity of attending to diseases in their infancy, so
nothing is more pressed upon us by moralists, than the necessity
of attending to the beginnings of vice, which may be justly styled
the diseases of the mind.
ExAMPLE.—The danger of not correcting the beginnings of evil
is finely exemplified in the character of Macbeth, who, though a
man of great virtue and honour, was, by attending to fortune
tellers, and yielding to the ambitious counsels of his wife, trans
ferred by degrees into a murderer of his king, and a tyrant to his
subjects, -
212 ENGLISH GRAMMAR.
TESTIMONY.—One of the most common observations of the an
cient moralists was, that no man became bad all at once, and that
the greatest offences against virtue have arisen from the smallest
beginnings of vice.
CoNCLUSION.—How justly, therefore, may we conclude, that we
cannot be too much on our guard against the first temptations to
evil; as every vicious inclination contains an egg, which by being
cherished, will be hatched into a serpent.
THE PROPOSITION.
RULE.—The meaning of the subject must be ac
curately fixed, and the proposition stated in the most
intelligible manner.
In general, the proposition should be placed before the argu
ment, but when it is not familiar to the audience, then let the
argument precede.
ARGUMENT.
RULE 1.—First, have a clear and accurate conception
of the subject in all its bearings. Then, consider what
are the most suitable arguments to prove the proposition
in question.
RULE 2.—Argument must never be allowed for a proof
of the question, which is in fact the question itself.
ExAMPLE.—“The human soul extends through all the parts of
the body, because it resides in every member.” The latter part of
this sentence is no proof of the former, but merely the same thing
in other words.
VIoIATIONs.—1. Prudence conduces to safety, because they who
are prudent can never be injured. 2. He that is extravagant will
quickly become poor, because extravagance begets poverty.
RULE 3.—Never wander from the proposition, into
reflections that have no intimate connexion with the real
subject.
Violations.—Necessity is the mother of invention; the truth
of this may be seen in bi which, before their young ones are
fledged carefully provide them with food, but the moment they
can fly, turn them out to provide for themselves.
RULE 4.—Never fall short of the proposition, consider
and explain it in every point of view.
ExAMPLE.—Charity, must not be confined to alms giving alone,
this is filling short ofthe proposition. Charity must be considered
in its proper acceptation, namely, universal love.
RULE 5.—Never discourse wide of the proposition,
avoid employing arguments which can be applied to other
subjects as well as to that on which you are arguing,
COMPOSITION. 213
Were I to be speaking on lying, if I use arguments equally
applicable to vice in general, I should argue wide of the proposition.
RULE 6.—Never use arguments that prove too little;
but let them be such as to warrant the conclusion.
Were I to say, “That man will suffer some great temporal
punishment, because he is cruel and oppressive;” my argument
would prove too little, for great tyrants have enjoyed great afflu
ance, and as much goodfortune and happiness, as this world is
capable of affording. f
RULE 7-Avoid making those terms general which
will apply with truth only in particular cases.
Were I to say, “Philosophy is adverse to Christianity, because
Woltaire, Diderot, and several other philosphers, were infidels,”
I should be said to prove nothing to the purpose. It is not true
that all philosophers are infidels, for philosopers are generally the
best Christians.
RULE 8.—Let your arguments be in such order,
that those which precede shall throw a light on those
which follow, and thus form such a connexion, that the
agreement or disagreement expressed in the proposition
shall be made manifest. -
GENERAL OBSERVATIONS.
1. When objections are made to your conclusions, mind
and state them fully.
2. In the refutation, give an answer to some specific
arguments advanced in favour of the opposite conclusion,
either by denying one of the premises, or by objecting to
the conclusiveness of the reasoning.
3. For directions on simile, see page 195. -
4. The whole theme may sometimes be concluded
with a recapitulation of the principal arguments that have
been advanced.
ExERCISEs.—l. Write on the immortality of the soul. 2. On
nature always beautiful. 3. On the attributes of the Almighty.
4. On the Divinity of Christ. 5. On the powers of the Deity
always active. 6. Instruction and delight from the works of God.
DIVISIONS OF A DISCOURSE.
Rhetorical disposition or arrangement, is placing of the
arguments, or the parts of a discourse, oration, or compo
sition, in the most suitable and impressive order.
214 ENGLISH GRAMMAR.
An Oration consists of six parts: 1. The exordium.
2. Narration or explication. 3. The state and division
of the points to be established. 4. The confirmation of
them by arguments. 5. The refutation. 6. The perora
tion or conclusion. - -
This method of divisions is not invariable, in every public
discourse. Sometimes there are only five divisions, and all dis
courses are not divided in the order in which I have here
placed them.
1. In the ero, dium or introduction of a discourse, the
writer or speaker gives some intimation of his subject,
and solicits favour and attention, in order that they may
forward and aid the purpose which he has in view.
In the erordium, the speaker ought to attempt to conciliate the
good will of his readers or hearers, by representing the subject
as being closely connected with their interest; to rouse their at .
tention by giving some hints of its importance, dignity, or novelty;
and to render them open to persuasion, by endeavouring to remove
prejudices or preposessions they may have entertained against it. .
In this part the speaker must be perspicious and modest; and
whatever is trivial, tedious, and prolix must be avoided.
He must be calm and dispassionate, so that the emotions of the
persons addressed may rise as the discourse advances.
The introduction must be proportioned to what is to follow. In
order to do this, it is well to meditate upon the substance of the
discourse.
2. The narration or explication of the subject, is a
brief recital of the facts connected with the case.
This part ought to be clear, distinct, complete, and succinct that
it may be understood: probable and consistent, that it may be
believed. A fact or single circumstance, omitted or left in
obscurity, may destroy the effect of all the reasoning and argu
ments afterwards employed. -
3. In the proposition is given the true state of the
whole discourse, specifying the points maintained, and
those in which the speaker differs from his adversarie's.
In this the several heads of which we treat should be distinctly
and concisely enumerated; which is commonly done in pulpit
orations. It is not recommendable for a speaker to conceal his
method of dividing a subject.
Take care, that the several parts into which the subject is di.
vided be really distinct from one another; that you follow the
order of nature, beginning with the simplest points that the
several members include all that the subject will admit; that each
member be as concise as is consistent with the rules of perspicuity;
that you avoid using too many subdivisions; these are generally
unnecessary and they fatigue the memory.
COMPOSITION. 215
4. The confirmation or argumentative part of a dis
course, assembles all the proofs and arguments which can
be adduced.
Place your arguments in that order which seems the best calcu
lated to give them the greatest effect. Avoid blending arguments
confusedly together; commence with the weakest and proceed as
in the figure of Climax. Do not extend your arguments; a few
brief and well-chosen, will carry a greater weight of conviction
than a great number of weak, extended arguments can possibly do.
5. In the refutation of objections, the speaker endea
Yours to refute anything which appears to oppose his
former arguments, or by shewing those of his oponent's
to be absurd, false, trifling, irrelevant, or inconsistent.
Care must be taken that no important argument be passed with
a slight notice, as it will not be considered to arise from inatten
tion, but from inability to reply to it.
This part of the discourse generally admits an appeal to the
passions, called the pathetic part; but this must entirely depend
# the nature of the subject. The exact time when to introduce
the pathetic must be left to good sense. The following directions
must be attended to.
l, Bring over the understanding and judgment of the hearers
On your side, before you attempt to interest the passions.
2. Never set apart a head of a discourse in form for raising any
passions; never suffer your hearers to perceive your intention of
moving their affections, as this is almost always sure to defeat
your object.
3. You must yourself feel that passion or emotion which you
attempt to awaken in others. This adds a pathos to your words,
your looks, your gestures, which exerts apower almost irresistible
over your hearers.
4. Attend to the language of the passions; it must be strong and
energetic, but not ornamental and flowery. Observe in what man
ner a person expresses himself who is under the influence of a
real and strong passion, and we shall find his language unaffected
and simple.
5. Beware of all digressions and wanderings from the subject.
Let nothing interrupt or turn aside the natural course of the pas
sion, when it begins to rise and swell.
6. Never attempt to prolong the pathetic too much. Warm
emotions are too violent to be lasting. Know where to stop: stop
at the proper point; for if you attempt to carry your hearers
farther in passion than they will follow you, this destroys your
whole design, and exposes yourself to ridicule and contempt.
6. In the peroration or conclusion, the speaker endea
vours to enforce what has preceded, and apply it to the
feelings of the hearers.
216 ENGLISH GRAMMAR.
Sometimes the pathetic part of the discourse serves for the
peroration; but when the discourse has been argumentative, the
peroration should be recapitulated, or sum up the strongest of
those arguments, that a strong impression of the truth of them
may be left on the mind of the hearers.
In all discourses, it is essentially necessary to know the pre
cise time for concluding, neither ending abruptly, nor disappoint
ing the expectation of the hearers when they look for the close.
If you continue to hover round the conclusion, your hearers will
become tired of you, and loose every favourable impression they
may before have received. Endeavour to conclude with dignity
and spirit, that you may dismiss your hearers with warm minds,
and enthusiastic impressions of the subject.
EXAMPLE OF AN ORATION DIVIDED INTO PARTS.
(From 26th chapter of Acts; translatedfrom the Latin Vulgate,
by W. J. Simmonite.)
ExoRDIUM.
King Agrippa, I think myself happy that I am pe.
mitted to defend myself this day before thee, touching all
the things of which I am accused by the Jews: above alle
because I know that thou art abounding in knowledge of
all customs and questions which are among the Jews:
therefore, I beseech thee, to hear me with patience.
NARRATION.
My manner of life from the commencement of my
youth, which was at first among my own nation in Jeru
salem, know all the Jews, which knew me from the
beginning (if they would bear testimony) that, after the
strictest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee. And
now I stand and am judged, for the hope of the promise
made by God unto our fathers: unto the accomplishment
of which promise our twelve tribes, who instantly serving
God night and day, hope to come: for this hope's sake
king Agrippa, I am accused by the Jews.
PROPOSITION.
Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you,
that God should raise the dead 2
- CoNFIRMATION.
I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do
many things contrary to Jesus of Nazareth. Which
things I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints
did I shut up in prison, having received authority from
the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave
COMPOSITION. 217
my voice against them. And I punished them often in
every synagogue, and compelled them to blaspheme; and
being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them
even unto strange cities. Whereupon as I went to
Damascus with authority and commission from the chief
priest, at mid-day, Oking! I saw in the way a light from
heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round
about me, and them that journeyed with me. And when
we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking
unto me, and saying, in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul,
why persecutest thou me? it is hard for thee to kick
against the goard. And I said, Who art thou Lord *
And he said, I am Jesus, whom thou persecutest. But
rise, and stand upon thy feet; for I have appeared
unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and
a witness both of these things which thou hast seen, and
of those things in which I will appear unto thee; deli
vering thee from the people, and from the Gentiles,
wnto whom I now send thee, to open their eyes, and to
turn theme from darkness to light, and from the power
of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of
sins, and inheritance among them who are sanctified
through that faith which is in me. Whereupon, O
King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly
vision; but shewed, first unto them of Damascus, and
afterwards to those in Jerusalem, and through all the
country of Judea, and then to the Gentiles, that they
should repent of their sins, and turn to God, performing
deeds worthy of that repentance which they profess.
REFUTATION.
For these causes, the Jews caught me in the temple,
and went about to kill me with their own hands Having
therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this day,
witnessing both to small and to great; saying none other
things than those which the prophets and Moses have
declared should be: that Christ should suffer, and that
he should be the first that should rise from the dead, and
should shew light unto the people, and to the Gentiles.
PERORATION.
I am not mad, most noble Festus; but speak forth
the words of truth and soberness. For the king knoweth
of these things, before whom also I freely speak; for
L
218 ENGLISH GRAMMAR.
I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from
him; for this thing was not done in a corner—King
Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou
believest.—I would to God that not only thou, but also
all that hear me this day, were both almost,and altogether
such as I am, except these bonds.
In the oration of the learned and eloquent Apostle is found
strict adherence to the preceding rules and directions.
1. In the Exordium he politely solicits favour from the king. “I
think myself happy.” As if he had said, “This is a peculiar for
tunate circumstance in my favour, that I am called upon to make
my defence before so intelligent a judge, so well acquainted with
the laws and customs of our country.”
2. In the Narration, he has briefly and perspicuously stated
the facts connected with his life.
3. The Proposition is a pointed and forcible appeal to the pro
fession of Agrippa.
4. His Arguments are clear, strong, and pathetic.
5. His Refutation is in accordance with rule.
6. His Conclusion is affecting; attended with both spirit and
dignity. While his heart glowed with affection for his accusers,
he expressed his wish that they might enjoy all his blessings, if
possible, without being obliged to bear any cross on the account.
His gesture, no doubt, would accord with the warmth of his pas
sion. When he uttered “except these bonds,” he would doubtless
hold up his chains, which were now detached from the arms of the
soldier, the sight of which, together with his emergetic expression,
would have a powerful impression on the minds of his audience.
Indeed, it appears they could bear the scene no longer; the king
was overwhelmed, and rose up instantly, and so did the rest of
the council, and went immediately aside; and after a very short
conference among themselves, they unanimously pronounced him
innocent; and his last word, Csaputov, Bonds ! so deeply im
pressed their hearts, that they concluded their judgment with that
identical word, Čsquov, Bosps! “This man hath done nothing
worthy of death or of BoNDs."
It would be well if every pulpit orator would follow this mode
of persuasive and argumentative arrangement.
METHOD IN LOGIC.
As the grand object of composition is to state or ascertain the
truth, it is indispensibly necessary that the pupil become acquainted
with the principal terms and distinctions which belong to the ar.
gumentative part of Logic.
I shall here introduce a few extracts from my “Manuscript of
Logic,” of some of the useful terms used in discourses.
“All arguments are termed either metaphysical,
physical, political, moral, mechanical, or theological,
according to the science or subject from which they are
drawn.”
COMPOSITION. 219
1. “The argumentum ad judicum, is an address to
the reason of man.”
Arguments from reason are either artificial or inartificial.
Artificial arguments are those invented by the ingenuity of the
orator. Inartificial arguments are such as do not arise immedi
ately from the subject, but from things of a different nature.
2. “The argumentum ad fidem, is an appeal to our
faith.”
3. “The argumentum ad hominem, is an address to
the professed principles of the adversary.”
4. “The argumentum ad populum, is an appeal to
the people.”
5. “The argumentum ad passionas, is an address to
our passions.”
“A speaker who wishes to affect the passions, should under
stand the frame of the human mind, that he may be enabled to
move those secret springs of all our actions.”
“The passion, anger, is excited by the speaker placing the
supposed offence in the strongest point of view, and describing it
in the liveliest colours imaginable; he carefully collects and
expatiates upon every circumstance which contributes to the ag
gravation of the crime; he is indignant against the spiritless
tranquility which can patiently endure such insults, and attributes
a reluctance to take revenge to mean cowardly motives.”
“The speaker endeavours to excite horror by assembling together
every circumstance which is calculated to alarm, and by present
ing to the imagination dangers in their most terrific form. He
excites compassion by expatiating on the wretched state of the
sufferer, his fears, his apprehensions, his penitence. He paliates
his faults, extols his good qualities, and thus collects, in one point
of view all his claims on commiseration.”
6. “The argumentum ex concesso, proves a proposi
tion on which itwas agreed to rest the original question.”
7. “..Argumentum a fortiori, proves a less probable
supposition upon which it depends, and, consequently,
the original proposition is true, because it is more
probable.”
DEFINITION.
1. “Definition, is such a description of things as exactly de
scribes the thing, and only that thing.”,
“There are two kinds of definitions; the definition of words,
and the definition of things.” -
2. “Definition of a word, is an explanation in what sense the
word is used, or what idea or object we mean by it;” as, “Light
is that medium by which we see the colour and shape of things.”
L 2
220 ENGLISH GRAMMAR.
3. “Definition of a thing, is the explanation of its general
nature, and those specific properties which distinguish it from
every other thing.”
CERTAINTY OR TRUTH.
1. “Certainty or truth,is of several kinds according to the sources
whence it is derived.”
2. “A mathematical certainty, which is of the highest kind and
admits demonstration.”
3 “A moral certainty, which is derived from testimony and the
obligation of the laws.”
4. “A physical certainty, is derived from the evidence of the
senses and of the course of nature.”
3. “A theological certainty, is founded on the language and
doctrines of the Holy Scriptures.”
EVIDENCE.
1. “Evidence is of different kinds; as, the evidence of sense,
founded on the perceptions of our senses.”
2. “The intuitive evidence, is founded onthe self-evident axioms,
(or truths on which others are founded) as, that the whole is
greater than a part, or, every effect is produced by some cause.”
3. “The evidence of reasoning arises when one truth is inferred
or drawn from others by natural and just methods of agreement.”
4. “The evidence of faith deduced from the testimony of
others.” -
5. “A demonstration a priori, is when the effect is proved by
referring to the cause.”
6. “A demonstration a posteriori, infers the cause from its
necessary effect.”
SoPHISMs.
1. “Sophisms are fallacious arguments by which falshood is
made to assume the appearance of truth.”
2. “Sophistry is reasoning founded on false premises, or, on
an ambiguity of terms, or on some erroneous mode of stating the
argument.” -
3. “A sophism of composition, is when we infer that anything
in an aggregate or compound sense, which is only true in a
divided sense.”
4. “A sophism of division, is when we infer anything in a divided
sense which is only true in a compounded sense.”
5. “A sophism of equivocation, is when we use words of an am
bigious or double sense, and draw inferences in one sense, of
which the proposition is capable only in the other.”
6. “A Petitio principii, or begging the question, is when the very
thing is taken for granted, or a supposed proof, by stating the
question in other words.”
7. “The Reductio ad absurdum, proves the conclusion, by de
monstrating the absurdity of the contradictory proposition.”
8. “The Fallacia accidentis, is arguing from what is merely
accidental to that which is essential.”
COMPOSITION. 221
9. “The ignorantio elenci, or a mistake of the question, is when
one thing is proved instead of another.”
10. “A false induction, is when general deductions are made from
a limited number of experiments or facts.”
11. “Arguing in a circle, is when the premises are proved by the
conclusion, and the conclusion by the premises.”
12. “A dicto secundum quid, ad dictum simpliciter, is when we
argue from that which is true in particular circumstances to prove
that the same thing is true absolutely, and in all circumstances.”
CAUSE OF ERROR.
Error in arguing and judging generally arises from some of the
following causes.
1. From wantofdiligence also from nothaving patienceorindustry
to investigate a subject, and in consequence forms a hasty or rash
judgment.
2. From the judging of things by their external appearances.
3. From not properly separating the good and bad qualities that
pervade the same thing, and basing our decision on that which
happens to make the first impression.
4. From the viewing of things relative to our own situation in
life, or to the manner in which they affect us.
5. From associating an idea, with something disagreeable, and
foreign to it or the contrary; and by prejudices formed in our
infancy, the foundation of which we have taken no pains to
investigate.
6. From the influences of custom which reconciles us to innu
merable errors, and none are more difficult against which to guard
ourselves than those which arise from the practices and habits of
the society in which we were educated. -
7. From our giving credit to the assertions or misrepresentations
of others, with whose object, motives, ignorance, or prejudices, we
are unacquainted.

BAD ARRANGEMENT.
The following errors are from the Grammar written by Mr.
W. CoBBETT, who is considered to be the most able, correct, per
spicuous, and forcible writer of the present time.
Omit those words which are placed between crotchets, for they
are violations of Rule 2nd, page 184, of this Grammar.
PAGE 13.—“For you could have thrown about seeds and stuck
in plants of some sort [or other] in some way [or other].”
PAGE 13.—“For without a [pretty] perfect knowledge relative
to [these same] nouns and verbs.”
PAGE 17.—“If in writing my lesson [down] on a [loose] sheet
of paper, I committed one [single] error.”
PAGE 34.—“The object or end of some act or of some improve
ment [of some kind or other;] Richard strikes Peter.”
PAGE 149.—[“Every part of] the letter ought to be carefully
read.
DEDICATION.—“When, in the month of August, 1817, you were
shut up,” &c. “While you were thus suffering,” &c. While
should be when. (See Rule 7, page 182.)
DEDICATION.—“If the bars of your dungeon will afford you
light.” It is not the mature of bars of iron to afford light. Better
say, “If the bars of yourdungeon will admit light.” R. 7, p. 182.
DEDICATION.—“You may perhaps, close your eyes for ever
without knowing of what I now address to you.” It should be
“Without knowing what,” &c. Rule 50, p. 142.
PAGE 7.—“The respect due to the profession of the surgeon
or physician, is, however, of an order inferior to that which is due
to the profession of the law.” It should be, “of the lawyer.”
The omission of the, before “physician” implies that surgeon and
physician are convertable appellations, which is by no means the
case. Rule 53, p. 145.
PAGE 8.—“To ignorant pretenders to surgery and medicine
we award our contempt [and scorn;] on time serving or treacher
ous counsellors, and on cruel or partial judges, we inflict our
detestation; [and abhorrence] while, on rapacious, corrupt, per
fidious, or tyrannical statesmen and legislators, the voice of
human nature, cries aloud for [execration and] vengence.” See
Rule 2, p 184; also Rule 7, p. 182.
PAGE 9.—“By which these sacred laws have, [from time to
time,] been defended.” Rule 7, p. 182.
PAGE 10.—“[Though] I have [now] said [what, 1 am sure,
will be more than] sufficient to make you,” &c."Rule 7, p. 182.
PAGE 10.—“You ought to proceed in your study, not only with
diligence, but with patience.” “Not only” require but also. Rule
47, p. 139.
BAD ARRANGEMENT. 227
PAGE 13.—“Grammar [as I observed to you before,] teaches
us how to make use of words, [that is to say, it teaches us how to
make use of them] in a proper manner.”
PAGE 18 “The spelling and employingof words is varied.” It
should be are varied. Rule 5, p. 103.
PAGE 31.—“Some words which are too irregular in [the] form
ing their plural.” Rule 50, p. 142.
PAGE 31.—“I have thought it—best to follow,” &c. Read it
the best. Rule 53, No. 2, p. 145. This rule Mr. C. frequently,
violates.
PAGE 33.—“You may be prepared well for the use of the
terms.” The “well” is improperly placed. Rule 27, p. 119.
PAGE 99.—“We, at last, hardly know whom or what the writer
is talking about.” About should be placed immediately before
“whom.” Rule 43, p. 134; also, Rule 4,p. 189.
PAGE 92.—“We have here a [pretty] good proof.” R. 7, p. 182.
PAGE 93.—“That the pronoun relate clearly,” &c. Rule 27,
page 119.
PAGE 95.—“We cannot say that we are certain whose life or
whose death he is speaking of.” The of should be placed imme
diately before “whose.” Rule 43, p. 134. Mr. Cobbett frequently
violates this rule
PAGE 174.—“The persons, who settle upon what shall be the
topic of these speeches, [the king's speeches] and who draw the
speeches up, are a Lord High Chancellor, a First Lord of the
Treasury,” &c. It should be, “The Lord High Chancellor, the
First Lord of the Treasury,” &c. There are not two Lords High
Chancellors, two First Lords of the Treasury, &c. Mr. C's,
language, however, intimates that there are. Rule 53, p. 145.
PAGE 181.—“If you should ever hear them there, stammering
and repeating, and putting forth their nonsense.” It should be
“stammering and putting forth and repeating their nonsense.”
A thing cannot be repeated before it is put forth. Rule 7, p. 182.
BAD ARRANGEMENT, FROM DR. WATTs’ LoGIC.
INTRODUCTION To THE Logic.—“It is the drawing a conclusion
which was before either unknown or dark.” It should be, the
drawing of a conclusion. Rule 48, p. 142.
INTRODUCTION.—“Reason, as to the power and principles of it,
is the common gift of God to man.” This is very ambiguous, the
it may relate to power as well as to reason. It is better to say,
“Reason as to its power and principles.” See top of page 186.
INTRODUCTION.—“All the prudence that any man exerts in his
common concerns of life.” “Any man” means men in general, and
“concerns” means the concerns common to men in general; there
fore, we should use the instead of his. Rule 53, p. 145.
INTRODUCTION.—“Reason is the glory of human nature, and
one of the chief eminences whereby we are raised above our fel
low creatures, the brutes, in this lower world.” The words “in this
lower world,” are unnecessary and they do harm; first, they im
ply that there are brutes in the higher world; second, they imply a
doubt whether we are raised above those brutes. Rule 2, p. 184.
228 ENGLISH GRAMMAR.
Logic, PART 3.—“Follow solid argument wherever it leads you.”
It should be, “lead you.” Rule 55, p. 147.
LoGIC, PART 3.- “In searching out matters of fact, in times
past or in distant places, in which case moral evidence is suffici
ent, and moral certainty is the utmost that can be attained, here
we derive a greater assurance of the truth of it by a number of
persons, or multitude of circumstances concurring to bear witness
to it.” It should be, “In the searching out of matters.” Rule 49,
page 142. The adverb “here,” is unnecessary. If “matters of
fact,” is the antecedent, the “ of it,” and the “to it,” should be,
“of them,” and “to them.” Rule 14, p. 110. If “evidence,”
is the antecedent, we have circumstances bearing witness to evi
dence. Rule 2, top of page 186. If “certainty” is the antecedent,
we have the truth of certainty. Rule 2, p. 184.
BAD ARRANGEMENT, FROM DR. JoHNsoN's RAMBLER.
FROM THE RAMBLER, No. 1.—“We are not compelled to toil
through half a folio to be convinced that the author has broke his
promise.” Broke, should be broken. Rule 51, p. 143.
No. 3. –“The muses when they sung before the throne of
Jupiter.” “Stag” should be sung. Rule 51, p. 143.
No. 4.—“To cull from the mass of mankind those individuals
npon which,” &c. “Which should be whom. Rule 5, p. 127.
No. 120.—“My purpose was, after ten months more spent in
commerce, to have withdrawn my wealth to a safer country.”
“Was” should be is; and “to have withdrawn” should be, to with
draw. Rule 56, p. 148.
No. 34.—“I invited her to spend a day in viewing a seat and
gardens.” It should be, “A seat and its gardens." Rule
53, p. 145.
No. 160.—“He will he welcomed with ardour, unless he destroys
those recommendations.” It should be, destroy. Rule 55, p. 147.
No. 1.—“I purpose to endeavour the entertainment ofmy coun
trymen.” The intransitive verb, “endeavour the entertainment"
should be, endeavour to entertain.
These specimens of bad arrangement are only a few sentences
of what may be selected from the above authors. They are intro
duced to shew the necessity of studying correct composition, as
well as to convince the reader that constant care must be exer.
cised, to prevent him from making similar errors. Notwith
standing these gentlemen's knowledge of the learned languages,
they were not exempt from writing bad English, which is one
proof that the best of writers are not without faults.
