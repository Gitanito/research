 1/1, October 1899-14/3, December 1912.

 Absorbed L.W. Rogers' American Theosophist, founded 1908, after the issue for October 1909, avowedly to further "cooperation” among American Theosophists at Annie Besant's suggestion, but more cynically to lessen competition and ensure conformity in the American Section.  At the end of 1912, in order to increase the journal's circulation and to more formally distinguish Theosophical material from matters of more general interest the journal became the American Theosophist and Theosophic Messenger, which in turn split in June 1913, becoming (1) the American Theosophist (1913-1914) and (2) the Messenger (1913-1927).  Fifty cents a year, 12-128 pp.  The journal had become the official organ of the American Section of the  Theosophical Society in 1907 under General Secretary, Weller Van Hook, and immediately placed itself in the midst of the "Leadbeater Affair” by inviting Leadbeater to contribute to the journal despite his resignation, and actively defended Leadbeater in its pages.  Walters had earlier edited Mercury (absorbed by Theosophical Review), and also edited The Golden Chain, a Theosophical paper for children.  The journal contained reports of the activities of the American Section and of Theosophy worldwide and contributions by Annie Besant, C.W. Leadbeater, Alexander Fullerton, L.W. Rogers, H.S. Olcott, Henry Hotchner, M.L. Scott-Eliot, Mary Weeks Burnett, A.P. Warrington, Jacob Bonggren, C. Jinarajadasa, Weller Van Hook, Mary K. Neff, Marie Russak, Claude Bragdon, Ella Wheeler Wilcox, et al.  Notable obituaries of the early American Theosophists.

 L.W. (Louis William) Rogers (1859-1953) was a railroad man, union organizer and socialist agitator before he turned to Theosophy and the occult.  (He once said that he had been introduced to occultism when Eugene V. Debs, of all people, gave him a book on the subject.)  He joined the Theosophical Society (Adyar) in 1903 and at the time he started this journal he held no office in the society (he became President of the American section in 1920).  Rogers's goal in establishing the journal was to spread the word on Theosophy and to give "especial attention to elementary teaching . . . designed to meet the necessities of those who know little or nothing of the philosophy."   Part of this was the recurring column called "Hints to Young Students of Occultism."  The journal was totally given over to the prevailing "Neo-Theosophy" or "psychism" of the times, concentrating on clairvoyance, self-development, unfoldment of psychic powers, etc., and never even mentioned the name of H.P. Blavatsky except to note her role in starting the Theosophical Society.  Rogers' views on the goals of what he thought of as occultism can be seen in his Self-Development and the Way to Power (Los Angeles: L.W. Rogers, 1916).  Contributions by Claude Bragdon, C. Jinarajadasa, C.W. Leadbeater, et al.  In the last issue of the journal, October 1909, Rogers announced the discontinuance of the journal, at the request of Annie Besant, to put his energies into Theosophic Messenger, which in turn became the American Theosophist (1913).  The same issue also carried an article by Leadbeater suggestively entitled "Our Relation to Children."

  This journal was the result of the split in June 1913 of what had been the merger of L.W. Rogers' American Theosophist and the Theosophic Messenger in order to better distinguish official pronouncements of the Theosophical Society from matters of more general occult interest, with this journal becoming the official organ of the American Theosophical Society.  Rogers (1959-1953) was a Theosophist and New Thought leader, the tenor of whose thought is exemplified in titles of his books: Self-Development and The Way to Power, Hints to Young Students of Occultism, etc.  Contributions by Bessie Leo, H.N. Stokes, L.W. Rogers, A.P. Warrington, Marie Russak Hotchener, Albert E.S. Smythe, et al.  Noted in William C. Hartmann's Who's Who in Occult, Psychic and Spiritual Realms (1925).
