Mindsight: Near-Death and Out-of-Body Experiences in the Blind

We  have the pleasure of announcing a new book,   Mindsight: Near-Death and     Out-of-Body Experiences in the Blind, by the noted NDE researcher    Kenneth     Ring and his colleague Sharon  Cooper.      </o:p>   </p>

&nbsp;    The book reports a pioneering  investigation of the astonishing claim that     blind persons, including those  blind from birth, can actually &quot;see&quot; during     near-death and out-of-the-body  episodes.&nbsp;  Ring and Cooper  interviewed 31 blind and sight-impaired persons who had NDEs and OBEs, and found  that the     great preponderance of them  reported &quot;visual&quot; experiences, some in detail.

In-depth  case studies are presented and carefully analyzed to evaluate     these     claims, including verification  from outside observers in some cases.&nbsp;  Ring     and Cooper contend that some  form of vision without physical senses, which     they call &quot;mindsight,&quot;  appears to have occurred during these experiences.

The  book concludes with a consideration of theoretical approaches from the     areas of consciousness  research, transpersonal psychology and     parapsychology     that together appear to  represent the most promising perspectives for     understanding the  extraordinary experiences described by the participants     in     this seminal study.

The  book includes a foreword by Dr. Charles T. Tart, and has already     garnered strong endorsements  and praise from leading researchers and     scholars and has been chosen  as the NDE book of the year on a well     regarded     NDE Web site.

Kenneth  Ring, Ph.D., is Professor Emeritus of Psychology at the University     of Connecticut and co-founder  and past president of the International     Association for Near-Death  Studies.&nbsp;  He is also the author of  several     previous books about  near-death experiences including Life at Death,     Heading     Toward Omega, The Omega  Project, and most recently, Lessons from the     Light.

Sharon  Cooper, M.A., is currently a Ph.D. candidate in counseling     psychology     at New York University.

The  book is published by the William James Center for Consciousness     Studies     of the Institute of  Transpersonal Psychology, as part of its purpose to     further the study of  transpersonal topics reflecting the interests of     William James, and we expect  it to stimulate controversy and spirited     discussion.
