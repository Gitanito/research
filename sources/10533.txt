  		              		Experience Description   

    I had a severe flu. I also had diabetes, but didn’t know it yet. This made my flu even more crippling and I was sleeping most of the time, as it was a struggle even to try to open my eyes. 

  At some point, I passed through a tunnel that was silver in color. I was moving at  a very high speed. There were many other souls there and there was a very strong light at the end of the tunnel. I reached the light, which I thought was coming from the sky. I knew I had to exit the tunnel. Meanwhile, I felt a female presence next to me. She gave me a message, but not with words. Her message was, 'Don’t worry; I am protecting you.' Suddenly, I found myself floating in the sky. It was a very beautiful scene. Below me was a very beautiful and calm sea. I saw  beautiful, white clouds in a sky that was a nice blue color. This scenery was so clear and vivid, beyond anything that I had ever experienced. The air was very fresh and nice.  I felt completely safe and was enjoying the whole experience. I was on something that was like an expensive rug or a huge butterfly. That female presence was still next to me and I was happy she was there with me. My field of view did not have dimension or limits. 

  Suddenly, I returned to my body. Immediately after waking up, I felt like I had been in the sky. I was amazed, but couldn’t understand what had happened. I convinced myself that it must have just been a dream, but it was different from any other dream I ever had. A few months later I accidentally came across the NDE of Dr. Eben Alexander, who used to be  a neurosurgeon. I saw many similarities to my experience, and realized that I must have had an NDE as well.

  Did time seem to speed up or slow down?         Everything seemed to be happening at once; or time stopped or lost all meaning.

  Did you seem to encounter a mystical being or presence, or hear an unidentifiable voice?         I encountered a definite being, or a voice clearly of mystical or unearthly origin.   She was a woman like all women, but didn’t speak with her mouth only, maybe with her eyes and heart.

What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         Large changes in my life       

  Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          Yes This earthly life is not worth hate and revenge. We need to love each other. This physical life is painful and full of suffering for every one. Here we are living in a hell that we don’t recognize.

Was the experience difficult to express in words?        No
