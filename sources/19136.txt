yeah the National Press Club event in 13
years ago and the things we&#39;ve done
since were really an accident of a
situation they&#39;re not an accident it was
it was required of a situation that was
so dysfunctional that there was no other
way out so you know okay I&#39;m a doctor
working as an emergency guy and I&#39;m
shoveling up here to DC in New York
meeting with the CIA director and this
person in this member of the Senate
Intelligence Committee with project
starlight which was the predecessor name
although it was kept very quiet before
the disclosure project and in my I mean
I&#39;m in my mid-30s in my naivete I
thought we had a constitution and a
democracy and I thought we I thought a
lot of things that were really nice
lessons from your high school civics
class but are just nonsense so when I
learned that the president the CIA
director had made inquiries into this
issue and had been denied in information
when I first got the letter from my
point of contact to the CI director
which I have right here it was described
to me and I was told I would be the
first person to brief the administration
the Clinton administration and this CIA
director on this subject now my wife and
I laughed I mean I&#39;m this 35 year old
doctor you know or 30 so I don&#39;t know at
that eighth point you know running an
emergency department I&#39;m going oh this
is absurd it cannot be so then what
happens is that I come up here and I
have the meeting in it then there was no
prevarication it was completely true and
so then I go over and I meet with
members of Congress so I meet with you
know people on Intel Appropriations what
have you same story
and they were not lying and the P is the
resistance is probably 1997 so four
years later and I&#39;m briefing the head of
intelligence for the Joint Chiefs of
Staff all right this is the guy who put
you know he&#39;s j24 joint staff head of
intelligence Admiral
and it&#39;s a stand-up briefing at the
Pentagon and I go in there with my
military advisor a few disclosure
witnesses that had not come public yet
and a man who walked on the moon
a Edgar Mitchell six men welcome to
minute and who was learning about all
this and so I invited him to come along
and I&#39;m there with this Admiral and
before I had gone to the today I had
sent a document and it&#39;s on our website
it&#39;s the NRO document National
Reconnaissance Office talked in a secret
document that I acquired and I&#39;d sent
that ahead at a time before I got there
and it had all the project code names
and numbers and what have you can look
at it&#39;s on our website for anyone to
look at if you can read nothing is none
of this a secret and but he knew how to
read a document and so he contacted one
of the compartments and he was told he
told them I want to be read into or
briefed on this project and they said
well Admiral we know who you are but you
you don&#39;t have a need to know let me
repeat the head of intelligence Joint
Chiefs of Staff of the largest military
in the world at the Pentagon I was there
now at this point he&#39;s so mad he says
well goddamn it if I don&#39;t have a need
to know who does and they said sir we
cannot discuss this with you and
basically hung up on him
it was a corporate contractor so by time
I get to this meeting he is frightened
and furious and so I do a media is
supposed to be a 45 minute stand-up
brief and it goes on for two couple
hours and he keeps canceling pointment
downstream and at the end of it I said
you know we really need your help fixing
this problem is a huge constitutional
cry
is this what am I supposed to do he says
you&#39;re telling me you briefed the CIA
director and gotten stuff with the
Rockefellers to the president they are
being sidelined and not only that but
that there are technologies that we&#39;ve
developed that our anti
gravity that have been functioning since
the 50s and 60s that can do circles
around the best thing I have that I know
about which is a b-2 stealth bomber I
said yes sir that&#39;s all true he says and
then it what can I do
it&#39;s points that match he says good luck
but he turned to me and he said as far
as I&#39;m concerned the people running this
or a criminal
rogue enterprise and you have my
permission to disclose everything you
have and any source you have and so and
I have been told that about many many
senior people and when people say who
red lighted and say green lighted the
disclosure project I said it make you
very surprised this is going to hit the
Internet
but the head of intelligence Joint Staff
the head of the Defense Intelligence
Agency members of the Senate because
they&#39;re all going we should know but we
don&#39;t I bring in dispositive documents
testimony evidence but whatever it is
they make an inquiry based on that
actionable intelligence and they&#39;re told
nothing that is proof of an illegal
rogue component within the are not our
country but multiple countries so once
we proved that in 1998 I wrote a UN OD
letter now what is that unless otherwise
directed now I learned this from my
military folks who I&#39;m not they&#39;ve ever
been in the military or government and
they said here&#39;s how you do this the way
we do something when it&#39;s controversial
we send in a letter and it&#39;s called a UN
OD letter unless otherwise directed and
we basically said this is our assessment
and here&#39;s what we&#39;re going to do unless
otherwise directed but they don&#39;t have
to reply unless otherwise directed so we
did that in late 1990 I believe is a 98
we sent this letter went to the head of
every agency FBI Department of Justice
CIA you name it return receipt requested
prove we can prove that these went to
these entities and I said that unless
otherwise directed we&#39;re going to start
disclosing the testimony of people who
have top-secret security
and oaths as well as documents and we
were exempt from the National Security
Act for prosecution and that this is a
legal action because the operation
keeping the secret is illegal Roe aa
priori is not protected under the
Constitution or the rule of law no one
to this day has contested that letter in
2014 based on that from 98 to 2000 we
put together the disclosure project and
the rest is history
so this is very different than say what
Edward Snowden did Snowden was
disclosing information of this program
prism that did have oversight from the
president and the oversight committees
even though there were members of the
Senate oversight committees who were
appalled and shocked by it and still are
but there was still oversight so even
though that&#39;s a black project it was a
legally overseen black project so let me
make a distinction between that and what
I&#39;m talking about I&#39;m talking about
unacknowledged special access projects
that are illegal and rogue and
unconstitutional and as such have no
protection from any law that Congress
has passed and a president has signed
now that we can prove and if someone
wants to take me to court I&#39;m ready to
go because boy we can prove it and the
subpoenas that would fly to the top
people that we have briefed in the
Congress at the Pentagon the head of the
Defense Intelligence Agency whom I
personally briefed this head of
intelligence Joint Staff CIA directors
they&#39;d all be called to swear under oath
and they would have to say yep and we
didn&#39;t know a thing so at a certain
point there&#39;s no way around that so we
did that due diligence between 1993 and
1998 that five-year period was all the
backstory that led to us saying we&#39;re
going to go forward now not without risk
and not without some people furious that
we were doing it I mean furious but and
who are still furious that we&#39;re doing
it but it was a correct thing to do it
was a patriotic thing to do and also
the right thing to do from the point of
view of even the legalities because you
cannot claim protection under national
security or secrecy oath while at the
same time breaking the law and lying to
the head of intelligence for the Joint
Staff or aligned to the president or
lying to the CIA director or lying to
members of the Senate Intelligence
Committee who are supposed to be
overseeing these kind of operations you
can&#39;t have it both ways but that&#39;s how
they wanted it for 50 years they wanted
it both ways and that&#39;s what Eisenhower
learned a very very very hard way and
between 1954 and 1961 when he left
office is that he actually got
outmaneuvered by the military and the
intelligence and corporate complex and
he totally lost control over these
operations he knew about him and he was
very interested in all of this but he
lost control and no president since then
has had operational access control now
let me make a distinction between
knowledge of something and control of it
you can i-i&#39;ve given documents like this
the people who then have gotten a
certain level of access and been briefed
on parts of all this information but
when they try to assert any control over
it
basically it&#39;s like the Admirals are
getting hung up on the phone you know
and that is an enormous problem for our
country and other countries like the
United Kingdom in France Australia and
it&#39;s something that is a real threat to
democracy and to the notion of what we
think we live in and so one of the myths
that the public suffers under is that we
live under an intact constitutional
republic and democracy the other myth is
that we have a free press I was at this
meeting I mentioned with all these you
know 120 elites and world leaders around
the world one of them was a publisher of
a major paper that I can&#39;t name and this
issue came up because everyone who asked
you you know who&#39;s
kind of a mid-level journalist for the
New York Times for Wall Street Journal
with CNN will say oh if any of this were
true it would it be in the news I&#39;ll go
really this guy said oh yeah
he says I would be awakened in the wee
hours of the morning or whenever as the
publisher owner and publisher though of
this big paper and they would say have
so-and-so pull that story and they would
pull it and on our website there is a
document from the CIA from 1991 that
describes this policy that the CIA has
even domestically to embed people in
these various large media outfits to
change alter stop stories that they
didn&#39;t want to get out now
John Q public going to their high school
in college civics lessons thinks we have
a free press there is another big myth
the other huge myth is that Adam Smith
is alive and well and we have a free
market economy nonsense we have a
managed market economy what do I mean
you can&#39;t have a free market economy if
the biggest technological breakthroughs
for the most important sector of the
economy is being ruthlessly suppressed
and is being held down through the
national security state on our website
there is a document from of three and a
half years ago from the Federation of
American scientists that states there
are 5,000 135 patents that have been
seized under the National Security Act
that have been sequestered and it even
talks about one that was in 1971 a
highly-efficient for back then more than
20 percent maybe it was 50 percent
efficient photovoltaic generator meaning
sunlight
going straight to electricity in a
generator that was seized under the
national security provisions well this
is not a nuclear trigger or a weapon it
was something that would have competed
with the price point of coal and gas and
so who are these bureaucrats working for
now do you think the president the Oval
Office knew of that action would
happened no or any member of Congress no
so you have this
at bureaucracy that will do these things
at the behest of those who are with an
all-access badge and they&#39;re not going
to say no so they just go and seize it
now that&#39;s not a conspiracy theory as
the mainstream scientific organization
that did a study of these seized and
sequestered patents but the patent is
only a fraction of it the man I told you
about who did this transdimensional
technology&#39;s effort in 74 he didn&#39;t even
try to go to patent he never got that
far they found out what he was working
on his showed up with a national
security order just like Stan Myers
toroidal free-energy device before there
was ever in an attempt to patent it so
on top of the 5165 patent seized there&#39;s
probably several times that number that
had been intercepted prior to it even
going to patent so how then can you
convince me that we live in a free
market economy when the most important
part of our economy and everything we
use from transportation to lights or
whatever has all been managed and
controlled by people who have special
interest so this is like your giant
people how about Washington and special
interests but this is it on to the nth
degree so that&#39;s sort of how we ended up
coming around to this because we
realized that the future of the planet
and our democracy were really being
jeopardized and that we were on the
right side of the law now if I had
jumped straight from identifying people
who knew this and documents and
testimony but had not offered it to the
president into these office I committees
into these agencies then I would have
been guilty of doing something
potentially illegal and that&#39;s why I was
actually very careful I was very much
dotting my eyes and crossing my T&#39;s
because my advisor said you&#39;ve got a
tiger by the tail you better be very
careful with this which we were I mean
it was a very big effort that nobody
knows about well till now many people to
see this but that&#39;s that&#39;s how we did it
why we did it we had to be careful but
now at this point you know I&#39;m and I
said that&#39;s that to space has been
squeezed out of the two
and not withstanding the corruption that
happens between the intelligence
community and the big corporate media
with the internet you know when we
launched the National Press Club event
some were upwards of 800 million people
heard about it so it&#39;s it&#39;s very very
very difficult and if you look at it
more than half the population believe
UFOs are real and part of the
government&#39;s hiding part of it now they
don&#39;t know the details so what more than
have more than who voted for any
president in our lifetime and 40 43
percent of Americans now think that we
are currently being visited by advanced
civilization very big number in a poll
that came out last year so I tell people
we&#39;ve really from that point of view we
but in terms of the conventional wisdom
of the hidebound
elites the inbred hidebound elites that
are running the corporate media and
academia and big government that that is
the conventional wisdom there is that
all push Aldus can&#39;t be true because if
it were true I would know about it
that&#39;s what I hear over and over and
over again there was a certain hubris
because I have a lot of family that are
tied into the Ivy League schools and and
the elite institutions and the the the
mindset is that this were true I would
know about it and and yet I have a
sister-in-law who had been at one point
that the editor of the Boston Globe and
when I was first getting involved with
this she says I don&#39;t care if you put a
dead et on my desk
the Boston Globe will never run a story
about this because that&#39;s the domain of
the tabloids and silly season and we&#39;re
a blue-chip paper in Boston and this is
a family member because it because of
the ridicule and the thing that most
people don&#39;t understand and I was told
this by an Air Force Major years ago it
most of the secrecy at this point isn&#39;t
maintained by any kind of
cloak-and-dagger threats it&#39;s because
the subject is so ridiculous it has been
portrayed as the domain of the cooks and
the tinfoil hat people and you know the
sky is falling and I&#39;ve been abducted to
another plan
what have you that people who are quote
respectable in academia government the
media don&#39;t want any association with it
where did that start
I have a document that I got after I
briefed the CIA director and I it has a
stamp date 1994 when it was finally
released and it was a document from 1953
ok 61 years ago where the CIA is talking
about using psychological warfare on the
on the UFO subject and I&#39;m quoting
engaging Disney Studios to make cartoons
about the subject so it would be
trivialized and made ridiculous yeah I
have this document I mean this is not
this is a dispositive it came from the
agency to me so with the provenance that
goes with that so we have now 61 years
of a very well orchestrated
counterintelligence defaming of the
subject campaign so when I started
trying to do this you know 20 years ago
it wasn&#39;t like we were starting at
ground level trying to go to up Mount
Everest we were starting at 20,000
Leagues Under the Sea trying to go up
Mount Everest really honestly and that&#39;s
why it&#39;s been such a heavy lift I mean
very difficult hardest thing I&#39;ve ever
done in my life but you know because
it&#39;s not a level playing field and I can
sit with people who are major puc but
they&#39;ll say oh no we can outrun with
this now many people say oh that&#39;s a
conspiracy theory I go really
yeah well it&#39;s not it&#39;s not a theory and
it&#39;s not a conspiracy it&#39;s just the way
the world works and so disclosure
happened because no one else would do it
I I never thought I would get involved
with that what I really wanted to do was
bring the concepts of higher
consciousness transdimensional physics
and communication systems to set up
ambassadors around the world to make
contact by passing the the sort of
dysfunction of the UN State Department
governmental thing as an NGO
non-governmental organization doing that
and actually because we were so
successful so quickly you know in 1992
were there on the beach in Florida and
for et craft materialized right in front
of everyone 50 people including two
Colonels and Air Force pilots it was on
the front page of the Pensacola paper
that day the video we have is I don&#39;t
operate cameras but there was a guy who
had an old high eight you know the old
high eight camera so we&#39;re not very good
but you can hear me going holy damn yo
the other thing that you probably have
seen the film footage and that&#39;s when
after that the former head of Army
Intelligence who&#39;ve been pulled into the
corporate world and a bunch of other
people pulled me aside and overtly first
tried to buy me off and then threatened
me and it&#39;s never stopped since and when
I refused to be bought off they started
a defamation of my character campaign to
the point that I&#39;m working in this er up
to my you know eyebrows and blood and
brains and everything and they put out a
thing on the internet that I&#39;m actually
not a doctor I don&#39;t have a medical
degree so I&#39;m having the facts it all
over a meat in everywhere my medical
degree and my license that really
happened to me and it has an ended sense
it&#39;s been 22 years of that kind of
psychological warfare but you know I
just in a way I&#39;m used to it now you
know nothing surprises me that these
clowns would put out there but at the
same time it really gets hard to take
just because you get so irritated you
know just like really and the public is
so gullible they don&#39;t know what to
believe so it&#39;s it&#39;s really hard I mean
it&#39;s very very hard because you know
you&#39;re going against a very big head
wind and the inventors have run into the
same thing you know they&#39;ll be ridiculed
and laughed off the stage and they&#39;ll
have people who will appear before them
who have acted when they these are
legitimate people who will then just say
pshaw you&#39;re violating the second law of
thermodynamics no you&#39;re not you know
why because it&#39;s there&#39;s complete
conservation of energy it&#39;s just that
what&#39;s not being accounted for is the
majority of energy in the cosmos but
you&#39;re not factoring into your equation
so there&#39;s complete conservation of
energy you&#39;re just pulling it out of
this other field of zero point in
quantum vacuum so when people tell you
that these technologies
just can&#39;t be done because it&#39;s
violating any of these fundamental walls
of physics you it&#39;s absolutely not true
but that&#39;s the argument in fact there
was a man from MIT at this elite
gathering I was at a few months ago who
was telling everyone oh no this is you
can&#39;t do that because you&#39;re violating
the laws of thermodynamics I&#39;m saying no
not any more than water falling over the
Hoover Dam turning a generator is
violating it it&#39;s using the force of
water which is really gravity gravity
you&#39;re turning gravity into electricity
that&#39;s all a hydroelectric dam is think
about it it&#39;s the mass of water being
pulled down because of gravity
gravitational fields turning a generator
as hole it is so is that violating the
second law of thermodynamics no you&#39;re
using a gravitational field you don&#39;t
think about these elemental aspects and
think deeply
