THE
CIRCLE OF FATE.
THE ART OF TELLING FORTUNES BY. THE
GROUNDS OF TEA· OR COFFEE.
To pourout the Tea O'I' Coffee Chottn<h.-Pour the grounds
of Cea or coffee into a white cup, shake them well about in it,
so that their particles may cover the surface of the whole cup;·
!hen reverse it into the saucer, that all the superfluous parts
may be drained, and the figures required for fortune-telling be
formed. It is not to be expected, upon taking up ,_the cup,
that the figures will be accurately represented ; but the more
fertile the fancy shall be of the peI'llOn inspecting the cup, the
more he will discover in i•.
The Roods, or superfine Jines, indicate ways ; if they are
covered with clouds and in the thick, they are marks of past or
f11ture reverses ; but if they appear clear or serene, they denote
some fortunate change near at hand.
Tlie Ring signifies marriage. I 1the ring ie in the clear, it
portends happy and lucrative friendship. Surrounded with
clouds, denotes 'hat the party is to use precaution in the friend..
thip he is about to contract.
7?ie Leaf of <Jl,over is, Bl well here as in common life, a
Jacky sign ; ita po11ition1 in the clip alone make the difference.
The Anchor, the emblem of hope aad commerce, implies
Hcceeafnl business carried on by waier and land, if on the boi-
tom of the cup ; at the top, and in a clear part, it shows con-
stant love and unshaken fidelity.
Tlie Serpent, always the emblem or falsehood and enmity, is
here a general sign of an enemy.
The Letter.-By letters we communicate to our friends either
plaeeaot or unplesant news ; such is the CB11e here : ifthis emblem
ia iJ,l the clear part, it denotes the speedy arrival of welcome
newa; 111UTounded with dots, it announce& the arrival of a con-
1iderabl1 remittance in money : but hemmed in by clouds, ic is
quite the contrary, and forebode& some melancholy tidings.

The Coffin, the emblem of death, prognosticates the same

The Star denotes f1appiness if in the clear, and at the top of

high rank.

or thick parl,
points out lasting good health. . .

tercourse with another person.

nes~, pleasant news, and recovery of lost ·things.

tef!l, a good sitution in a foreign country, OF good prospect&

tions and dispositions of every creature are understood: and <:~
beca~se some of the members are uncompounded, and entire of ··~
tbemselve8, as the tongue, the heart, &c. and some are of a ..
mixed nature, 88 the eyes, the nose, ,and others; we therefore '1;
:11
say that there are many signs which agree and live together,
that inform a wise man how to make bis judgment before hebe &~
too rash to deliver it to the world. '·

good conditioned, and willing to do any thing. He whose hair
is of a brownish colour, and curled, is a well-disposed man.
He whose hair turns grey or hoary in the time of his youth, is
generally given to women, vain, and talkative. Note. W~
ever signification the hair bas in men, it has also the same in
women.
The forehead that riseth in a round, sigilifies a man liberal·
ly minded, of a good understanding, and generally inclined IO
virtue. He whose forehead is fleshy, the bone of the brow
jetting out, and without wrinkles, is a man much inclined 10
8uits at law. He whose forehead is low and little, is of a good
unders~anding. He whose forehead seems sharp, and pointing

black, and the hair of them but thin, are bold and confident of

Great and full eyes, in either man or woman, shows the
d! peraon to be for the most part slothful, hold, envious, a bad
11 concealer of secrete, vain, aad of a bad memory.
ni He whose eyes are hollow in his head, is one that ·is sus-
1.'1 picious.
