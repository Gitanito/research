  1/1, June 1, 1863-May 1865.  16 pp, 9 1/2 x 6.  6-8 francs a year.

  The first issue published a letter of advice from Allan Kardec and placed itself under the aegis of his "spiritism"--a fact noted with satisfaction by the Revue Spirite in its June 1863 number.  Sabo claimed that the idea of the journal came from his guardian spirit, Saint Louis, and it was largely given over, in the Kardecist fashion, to short paragraphs received from the society's spirits, and longer disquisitions on morality, religion and abstract philosophical questions.  The Society's mediums were usually three unknowns: Henri Ganipel, M. Lescouzeres, and Mme Cazemajour.  The journal also carried a contribution from a "Esprit typteur."  By 1864, there were three spiritist journals in Bordeaux, and Sabo notes in the last issue (May 1865) of this journal that the work had become too much to handle.  He had become the secretary of Kardec, and Bez, who had been editing the Voix d'Outre-Tombe, had moved to Paris as well to edit Revelations d'Outre-Tombe, so the decision was made to merge the three existing journals into the new L'Union Spirite Bordelais under the direction of Bez.
