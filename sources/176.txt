 The advertisements for  the journal called it "the pioneer of Occult and Metaphysical  publications," and modestly suggested that "to be without it is to be  behind the age."  Whipple (1848-1916) was a proponent of what he  called "mental science" and the founder of the American School of  Metaphysics ("The Deepest Occult Scholars and philosophical minds  praise this system as the only complete and comprehensive system yet  offered to the public.").   The formula he employed in the journal  was obviously a successful one and it seems to have thrived  until  1913.  The journal attracted articles by Alexander Wilder (notably an  article on "The Rosicrucian Brotherhood" in June 1896), Paul Tyner,  Elliott Coues, Henry Wood, H. Stanley Redgrove, E.H. Randle, W.J.  Colville, C. Staniland Wake, John Hazelrigg (the astrologer), Maria  Corelli, Florence Huntley, et al.  Many of the articles appearing  here later appeared in translation in Neue Metaphysische Rundschau.  Regular advertisements for the works of Paul Tyner, P.B. Randolph,  F.B. Dowd, et al.
