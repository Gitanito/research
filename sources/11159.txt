  		              		Experience Description   

    I was a healthy, 28 year-old woman, giving birth to my first child. After a long labor and 2 1/2 hours of pushing, my child was stuck in the birth canal. We both went into distress. It became imperative to operate at once or they would lose us both. Everyone starting rushing and running, just like in the movies. I was given an epidural, but it didn't work to block the pain. I could feel them cutting me open and I told them so. When they put the gas mask over my face, I knew that they were going to save the baby and lose me. 

  Next, I was hovering above the operating table. They were holding my baby boy above my abdomen. He cried and they were expressing their pleasure at a safe delivery of a healthy baby. I heard a nurse say, 'Uh,oh, there goes her heart !' Then she said, ' 'Inaudible, inaudible. STAT!!' 

  I woke up several hours later, in a hospital room. No one ever told me that my heart stopped during surgery. I mentioned it to my husband years later and he was shocked that I knew about it. I told him that I was hovering above the table, when it happened.
