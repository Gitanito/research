 This was a representative example of the organized New Thought movement of the period.  It was the organ of the Church of the Truth that were started in Spokane, Washington, probably in the early 1920s, by Rev. Albert Cotton Grier (1864-1941), as Pastor.  Wells became Minister in Charge.  She was the first woman minister in Spokane and for a time had her own radio show.  She appears to history first in the Washington News Letter in 1916 and went on to become President of the International New Thought Alliance, 1938-1940.  The journal functioned as the organ of a consortium of New Thought churches, mainly in the Northwest, that worked under the name Churches of the Truth.  It contained short uplifting articles by largely unknown authors and provided a cheering thought for each day ("Every man believes that he has a greater possibility").  On a "love offering basis" the Churchesâ€™ "Silent Servitors" offered to help by prayer and thought readers who felt a "need in  your life for a deeper realization of your oneness with Infinite Good in any form."  Grier had earlier published in Spokane The Truth: A Magazine Devoted to the Truth that makes Free, with Wells as a co-editor, that lasted until 1930 at least and seems to have been a predecessor of The Fountain.  Issue for 1944 in INTA archives.  LOC.       Issues:The Fountain May 1942      </p>
