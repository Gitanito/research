*Google search ‘Yeshua ben Josef’

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     I came not   to offer you salvation but liberation.&nbsp;   I came as a revolutionary mind determined to wake up and then to help you   do the same: &nbsp; to transform the minds of   those beings who existed in that time and place—not to offer salvation that your   churches teach, but a salvation of freedom, a salvation of creativity, and a   liberation of the mind.&nbsp;  I came to   offer teachings to your world that had not been offered at that time--(simple,   basic) revolutionary teachings that cost me my life.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     I did not   come to save you but to empower and liberate you within the knowledge of love.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     Grace   births compassion, and compassion is the essence of love.&nbsp;   Furthermore, creation is the essence of joy.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     My message   is a message of unconditional love, not a message of fear.&nbsp;   And suffering is caused by you, by feeding your fears.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     Please use   your own personal, loving guidance system instead of external forces or   substances to learn to face and heal your fears and your emotions.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     The more   you accept your divinity, the less the darker force has influence in your world.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     Humans do   not need forgiveness from me.&nbsp;  They   need forgiveness among themselves.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     My purpose   was/is to spread these foundational teachings within your societies and, indeed,   within your minds.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     This is   what I did with my life.&nbsp;  I trained   my heart and mind to evolve into an enlightened state.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     I came   into this world in the ordinary fashion, and I lived a very ordinary life.&nbsp;   I knew very early on in my human incarnation that I would be transforming   consciousness within your societies.&nbsp;   My story in ‘your’ Bible has been altered, added upon, changed, and   elaborated throughout time.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     Use ‘your’   scripture as a supplement to Source within you.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     God is not   a being but a benevolent Source that unconditionally loves and creates all:&nbsp;   all-knowing, all-loving consciousness.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     There are   many paths back to Source.&nbsp;  My way   is but one way.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     Serve no   guru—not even I.&nbsp;  I am not the only   one.&nbsp;  There are many gurus or   teachers sent to specific peoples and cultures for the purpose of spreading   spiritual truths and enlightenment.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     Never   submit to another power which takes you from your direct connection to Source.&nbsp;   Separate me from your religion.&nbsp;   This was never my intent.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     I cherish   the songs of your children within your churches.&nbsp;   For in many of them are taught my simple truths.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     Baptism   and other human-made rites of passage are precious to God and honor choices of   divinity within.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     I taught   my disciples that your body is not who you are.&nbsp;   You are not your body.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     You chose   your family in the premortal existence, there in spirit form.&nbsp;   You chose your family to access the full expression of your life purpose   as an incarnated being.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     Your   sexuality is just as it should be.&nbsp;    The feminine and masculine portions of your divinity are exactly as they should   be.&nbsp;  Your sexuality is a part of you   that should not be pushed aside, unrecognized, hidden, buried, or shamed.&nbsp;   You are the way you are because God made you that way.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     Atonement   simply means your oneness, your direct connection with the Divine:&nbsp;   at-onement.&nbsp;  No mediator is   needed between you and Source.&nbsp;  For   Source is within you.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     Nothing   external is required.&nbsp;  You   are the miracle.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     It is not   your duty to alter another’s connection with the Divine or to ‘convert’ anyone.&nbsp;   Source is within them to be able to do that and find their own way back   to Source within themselves.&nbsp;  Simply   love unconditionally.&nbsp;  Simply ‘be’.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     There are   no shoulds or should nots, only alignments.&nbsp;   Your purpose is your free-will choice.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     You are a   being guided to your purpose by the compass of your feeling self.&nbsp;   Do not dismiss your feelings, your passions, and your desires as   self-indulgent.&nbsp;  And do not suffer   or sacrifice yourself upon the alter of anything.&nbsp;   Become a free being.&nbsp;  Your   mind and heart center are guided by your feelings which connect you to Source.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     Your   purpose will arise with your compass which is your heart center.&nbsp;   Let your heart be your compass to the discovery of your purpose.&nbsp;

  --Yeshua

[Please google “Jesus Historicity,” “The Formation of the Bible,” and   “Biblical Historicity” as well as “Virgin Birth Stories Throughout History.”&nbsp;   Also, please note that much of the biblical text came to us via oral   tradition which got passed down from generation to generation.&nbsp;   Moreover, please note that the New Testament texts are, in fact, oral   histories which got passed down more than an entire generation (50-70 years   after the fact) before being recorded.&nbsp;   In addition, please note that the Bible as we know it today was edited,   extensively, by the Catholic Church during the time of the Council of Nicea.&nbsp;   And, before the formation of the Catholic Church, followers of Jesus   referred to their path as “The Way” (simply a way of life), using the symbols of   the dove (the Spirit of God) and the fish (fishers of men) to symbolize their   convictions to the teachings of Jesus.&nbsp;   The symbol of the cross and the theology of Jesus dying for one’s sins   was canonized by the Catholic Church.&nbsp;   (“Take up your ‘cross’--aka, your ‘conviction’—and follow me.” Matthew   16:24)&nbsp;  In regard to the Gospel of   Mary (from the Gnostic texts of Nag Hammadi) as interpreted by scholar  Karen King,   she “considers the work to provide an intriguing glimpse into a kind of   Christianity lost for almost fifteen hundred years...[it] presents a radical   interpretation of Jesus&#39; teachings as a path to inner spiritual knowledge; it   rejects His suffering and death as the path to eternal life.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Reference Documentaries:&nbsp;    Origins of the Bible, NOVA 2016; Who Wrote the Bible, History Channel   2016; Gnostic Gospels, US Discovery Channel 2016; From Jesus to   Christ: The First Christians, PBS 2017; The Real Jesus Christ,   Timeline 2018; Buried Secrets of the Bible hosted by Albert Lin, National   Geographic 2019.

~My own ‘speculation’.&nbsp;  On that   sacred eve in the Garden of Gethsemane when Yeshua (Jesus) sweat drops of blood   (ref.: Luke 22:44), ‘perhaps’ he was experiencing at that very moment of linear   (earthbound) time, ‘H’umanity in its entirety on a cellular level--both   individually and collectively.&nbsp;    (e.g.: I ‘Knew’ Their Hearts&nbsp;    --Jeffery Olsen)]

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     I truly believe that   humanity is entering into a new age where science is merging with spirituality   and where over time and evolution, &#39;religion&#39; will be a thing of the past--a   respected part of historical antiquity.&nbsp;   --Deanna

  &nbsp;

&nbsp;

General Observations and Conclusions made from a conglomerate   of afterlife researchers and NDEers—

    v&nbsp;     God is much bigger than any one religion.

    v&nbsp;     All creation is connected.&nbsp;   Separation is an illusion.&nbsp;    (Divinity and humanity are inextricably connected.)

    v&nbsp;     There are many realms in the world-to-come.&nbsp;   Your soul will simply gravitate to where you feel most comfortable--to a   level of your own soul’s evolution, and you will gravitate to other souls with   whom you feel most comfortable.&nbsp;    And, yes, relationships are eternal--bound by unconditional love, commitment and   desire.&nbsp;  (Logistics.&nbsp;   This is not rocket science, people.)

    v&nbsp;     The condition of one’s soul will determine where   you gravitate to in the next realm—dictating your next-realm destination.

    v&nbsp;     You and you alone can put yourself into a state   of ‘hell’.&nbsp;  Also, “birds of a   feather flock together”—even in the lowest of vibrational states in the next   realm.

    v&nbsp;     Our beliefs shape our realities, and our belief   systems will affect our transitions into the next realm.&nbsp;   Spirit does not want to shock your system.

    v&nbsp;     The Divine respects just where you’re at and   persuades you in ways that you can understand.

    v&nbsp;     We each judge ourselves (in company with our   unconditionally loving spirit guides) and no one else via the life review.

    v&nbsp;     When your loved one passes, he or she can   actually be of more help to you in the next realm than in this realm--as there   your loved one can see your life’s situation, with all its intricacies, in   perfect clarity.

    v&nbsp;     A majority of NDEers report that the NDE   experience is more real, tangible, and vivid than human existence (aka,   hyper-reality).&nbsp;  Many NDEers have   said that compared to the NDE that ‘this life’ is the ‘dream’—that earth life is   a re-creation of the greater reality.

    v&nbsp;     Many NDEers report receiving an all-knowing   download upon their transitions—coming to an all-encompassing knowledge   regarding the intricacies of their lives and their connection to the universe.

    v&nbsp;     Many NDEers report that prayer (soul   communication) is very real and intrinsically important.

    v&nbsp;     Many NDEers report that after having experienced   the NDE, they have a difficult time with the usage of electronics such as   watches, cell phones and the like.

    v&nbsp;     Across the board, NDEers report that ‘the   experience’ freed them from any fear of death.

    v&nbsp;     Across the board, NDEers report that it’s not so   much what you do in this life that matters as much as it is, ‘who you are’ and   ‘who you’ve become’ from the inside out.

    v&nbsp;     In the world-to-come, time is circular rather   than linear.&nbsp;  The majority of NDEers   report that time does not exist in the afterlife.

    v&nbsp;     Spoiler alert!&nbsp;   Reincarnation happens!!&nbsp;  (I   know, mind-boggling for sure.)

    v&nbsp;     Another spoiler alert!&nbsp;   There is ‘no sin’, per se.&nbsp;    We all simply learn via the consequences of our own actions and how those   actions affect ourselves as well as our environment and those around us.&nbsp;   (In the next realm, actions are not looked upon as ‘right’ or   ‘wrong’--‘it’ simply ‘is’ … what it is.)

    v&nbsp;     ‘Sin’ and ‘evil’ are not synonymous in the next   realm, and ‘evil’ is looked upon ‘there’ as an illness.

    v&nbsp;     Masturbation (or another example, over-eating).&nbsp;   A sin?&nbsp;  In the next realm   masturbation (or over-eating) is simply looked upon as scratching an itch (or   indulgence).&nbsp;  Is scratching an itch   (or indulgence) a sin?&nbsp;  No.&nbsp;   Can permanent damage be done by excessive scratching (or indulgence)?&nbsp;   Possibly.&nbsp;  Habits (or   desires) formed here carry over with us there.&nbsp;   (Notation:&nbsp;  how do these   habits as well as other habits affect you, your partner, and those around you?)

    v&nbsp;     To the Divine, oftentimes we humans appear as a   bunch of beloved toddlers bonking each other with styrofoam bats and air guns.

    v&nbsp;     See the humor in life.&nbsp;   Be a little sac-relig from time-to-time.&nbsp;   Lighten up, and enjoy life!

    v&nbsp;     Duality is a necessary component for growth, and   “Satan” is not a being but a ‘role’ (a metaphor).

    v&nbsp;     Earthly baptism as well as other human-made rites   of passage are not necessary for one’s own spiritual growth although such   confirmations of commitment are beautiful to the Divine.

    v&nbsp;     The beggar on the street corner could, in fact,   be a powerful eternal being come down to teach ‘you’ compassion.

    v&nbsp;     Stronger souls choose tougher paths.&nbsp;   Never judge anyone.

    v&nbsp;     Every soul that exists or that will ever exist is   loved and cherished beyond human comprehension—no matter where you are at in   regard to your own spiritual evolution.

    v&nbsp;     We are all spiritual beings having a human   experience here at ‘earth school’.

    v&nbsp;     Suicide:&nbsp;   The Divine looks upon suicide like a loving parent would look upon   his/her child dropping out of school.&nbsp;   The soul who chooses this path will be met by compassionate, loving   spirit guides to offer spiritual healing and rejuvenation for the struggling   soul to prepare him/her to get back into the game of eternal life to accomplish   the schooling needed for this soul’s spiritual development and evolution.

    v&nbsp;     Earth school is indeed just that, a school—a   grand experiment, a spiritual boot camp, a play, a movie, and a game all wrapped   up into one magnificent experience.&nbsp;    And each of us are indeed its students, teachers, actors, dreamers, coaches, and   players.

    v&nbsp;     The terms, ‘God’, ‘Source’, and ‘Universe’ are   synonymous, and Jesus was/is the ultimate human expression of God.

Noted Quotations –

    v&nbsp;     Although   of manmade construct, the religions of this world are precious to the Divine and   needed within societies for the purpose of providing and promoting civility,   values, and community.&nbsp;  (There are   many folds.)&nbsp;  –Bettie Eadie, NDEer

    v&nbsp;     See the   beauty and goodness to be found in a variety of religions, ideologies, and   philosophies.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  --Deanna

    v&nbsp;     I grew up   as a Catholic, so I suppose it was natural for me to meet Jesus in Heaven.&nbsp;   Did God choose Jesus to be my guide and teacher because Jesus is an   important part of my faith?&nbsp;  I   remember Jesus saying [to me in my NDE]:&nbsp;   “Faith should not separate people, but instead should bind them together   to God.&nbsp;  Belief systems, however   diverse they may seem, are all rooted in God’s love.&nbsp;   All faiths should be respected and honored.”&nbsp;   His answer now makes sense to me.&nbsp;   Perhaps people of different faiths who experience near-death might meet a   different teacher who aligns with their belief systems.&nbsp;   They might meet Mother Mary, angels, Moses, Abraham, Buddha, Muhammad,   Krishna, or other messengers of God’s choosing.&nbsp;   This is extraordinary insight.&nbsp;   –Tommy Rosa, NDEer

    v&nbsp;     Religion:&nbsp;   a means, not an end.&nbsp;&nbsp;    –Deanna

    v&nbsp;     This is my   simple religion:&nbsp;  There is no need   for temples or complicated philosophy.&nbsp;   The brain and the heart comprise the temple and the ultimate philosophy   is, simply, kindness.&nbsp;  –The Dalai   Lama

    v&nbsp;     I looked   in temples, churches, and mosques.&nbsp;    But I found the Divine within my own heart.&nbsp;   –Rumi

    v&nbsp;     For the Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man   looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart.&nbsp;&nbsp;   –1 Samuel 16:7

    v&nbsp;     Religion   is superficial when compared to the true love of God.&nbsp;   –Howard Storm, NDEer

    v&nbsp;     Our world   views have been shaped by our communities.&nbsp;   &nbsp; –Thomas Butler, NDEer

    v&nbsp;     There are   as many pathways to God as there are people.&nbsp;   Never judge another’s path.&nbsp;    Consequently, the same spiritual path cannot be recommended for all.&nbsp;   &nbsp; –Pamela Aaralyn

    v&nbsp;     More than   teaching us what happens when we die, the NDE teaches how to live, day-to-day.   ... The study of the NDE transcends religion and culture.&nbsp;   –Kenneth Ring

    v&nbsp;     A truth   that we learn from, from the NDE is that God is not limited to any one religion   or even religion at all.&nbsp;  God cares   only about a person’s heart, not a person’s religious affiliation or church   membership.&nbsp;  The NDE reveals that   the way to heaven is through love because love is God.&nbsp;   Love is not limited to only one religion or culture because love is   universal.&nbsp;  This truth is too   immense and profound to be fully understood or embodied in any one religion. …   This world is part of a divine university of higher learning where learning to   love is what life is all about. … Love is the law of the universe.&nbsp;   –Kevin Williams, NDEer

    v&nbsp;     On the other side, there is no Christian;   there is no Muslim; there is no &#39;ism&#39;; there is no gay; there is no black; there   is no wealthy; there is no poor.&nbsp; There is only spirit and unconditional   love.&nbsp; All these categories that we&#39;ve been taught century after century   after century are not what you see on the other side.&nbsp; What you see is   spirit, and what you feel is the essence of love.&nbsp;   –Peter Anthony, NDEer

    v&nbsp;     Wisdom can   run through any age, any gender, and any race.&nbsp;   –Tricia Barker, NDEer

    v&nbsp;     In truth, I’m not my body, my race, religion   or other beliefs, and neither is anyone else.&nbsp;   The real self is infinite and much more powerful—a complete and whole   entity that is One with Universal energy.&nbsp;   In fact, I am Universal energy.&nbsp;   –Anita Moorjani, NDEer

    v&nbsp;     I have no need of creeds nor use for faiths.&nbsp;   Positive knowledge has displaced them both, and I have come to know there   is no death; there are no dead.&nbsp;    That change is one step only in life’s progression, in the unceasing march of   evolution, in which neither identity nor individuality is lost.&nbsp;   --Edward C Randall, NDEer

    v&nbsp;     Authority figures are really authority   &#39;figurines&#39;, animated by the power you have attributed to them. Just as you have   invested that power, you can withdraw it. No one and no thing has power over   your soul, and neither do they deserve it. It is tempting to complain about how   greedy corporations are taking over the world or how the corrupt government is   ruining your life. You will find plenty of people to agree with you which only   reinforces the projection and deepens the suffering it generates. Take back the   power you have given to authority figurines, and claim the authority of your   creations. Then your projections of evil and salvation will wither, and you will   not need saving because you already stand on holy ground.&quot;&nbsp;   --Alan Cohen (takeaways on A Course in Miracles)

    v&nbsp;     NDE accounts, as a whole, usurp religious   organizations’ authority.&nbsp;  –Lee   Whiting

    v&nbsp;     Once you know who you really are, ‘being’ is   enough.&nbsp;  You feel neither superior   to anyone nor inferior to anyone, and you have no need for approval because   you’ve awakened to your own infinite worth.&nbsp;   –Deepak Chopra

    v&nbsp;     Love   drives creation as a universal force.&nbsp; &nbsp; –Roy   Hill

    v&nbsp;     Love is   the creative force of the universe.&nbsp;    Love creates, and fear destroys.&nbsp;    –Cherie Aimee, NDEer

    v&nbsp;     ‘Create’   love around you.&nbsp;  This is   abundance.&nbsp; &nbsp; –Lauren Antuofermo

    v&nbsp;     To learn   to love perfectly is the essence of spiritual growth, and may all of our   motivations be driven by love.&nbsp; &nbsp; –Roberta   Grimes

    v&nbsp;     It’s not   about religion.&nbsp;  It’s about ‘be’coming   and then ‘be’ing.&nbsp;  –Amy Call, NDEer&nbsp;   (“Teach me all that I must ‘be’* to raise my vibration and dwell with the   Divine once again.”)

    v&nbsp;     When   transitioning into the next realm, one might ask, “Who have I ‘be’come?”&nbsp;   --Deanna

    v&nbsp;     Let go of   old beliefs and concepts that no longer serve you regarding your own spiritual   growth.&nbsp;  I’m not so much concerned   about one’s beliefs.&nbsp;  I’m more   concerned about how those beliefs shape one’s behavior and character.&nbsp;   –Zoe Toussaint-Winchcomb, NDEer

    v&nbsp;     Refining   one’s nature is what it’s all about.&nbsp;   --Deanna

    v&nbsp;     I could   see how I had naively accepted the beliefs handed to me as I was growing up, and   I also understood that until we actually believe in religious myth, they have no   power.&nbsp;  Our belief in them is what   makes them true for us.&nbsp;  –Anita   Moorjani, NDEer

    v&nbsp;     We must   unlearn what we have learned.&nbsp;  –Yoda

    v&nbsp;     I   comprehended the natural laws of the universe and was shown how every   individual, through his own free will, chooses a path that takes him to   circumstances of what continues.&nbsp;    Nothing happens at random as we, in a way, create our own world.&nbsp;   –Amy Call, NDEer

    v&nbsp;     When we realize that we are the creators of   this experience, we will finally accept responsibility for this experience and   with this knowledge, transform it into the reality we want it to become.&nbsp;  &nbsp; –Wade C Wilson

    v&nbsp;     Surely, a   myriad of spiritual truths are taught within the pages of our civilizations’   spiritual texts although many of these truths are taught via allegory and/or   metaphor.&nbsp;  –Deanna

    v&nbsp;     The Bible:&nbsp;   a beautiful collection of stories depicting how an ancient people made   sense of life, divinity, the cosmos, and deity.&nbsp;   –Deanna

    v&nbsp;     Most of us   were never taught that there’s no judgment, or that the most important thing we   can focus on is love, not fear of retribution.&nbsp;   All we know is what our culture or religious tenets teach--tenets written   thousands of years ago by men in a completely different era.&nbsp;   –Anita Moorjani, NDEer

    v&nbsp;     An NDE, to   a certain extent, is a co-created experience.&nbsp;   –Jeffrey Long

    v&nbsp;     Your   beliefs shape the spiritual feedback that you’re getting.&nbsp;   –Mellen-Thomas Benedict,NDEer

    v&nbsp;     It’s not   about ‘be’lief.&nbsp;  It’s simply about ‘be’ing.&nbsp;   –Deanna

    v&nbsp;     Being   spiritual has nothing to do with what you believe and everything to do with your   state of consciousness.&nbsp;  –Eckhart   Tolle

    v &nbsp;         My big wish is that you can step forth now from the doubts and fears that both   science and religion have sown in us, and enter with joy the abundant and   glorious truth that      you are a powerful, eternal being—an infinitely precious part of ‘Source’—and   that you are forever perfectly loved! &nbsp;        --Robert Grimes

    v&nbsp;         Life is a gift not a test, and you are enough. &nbsp;        –Jeffery Olsen,    NDEer

    v&nbsp;         You are in charge of ‘you’ and no one or nothing else—your body, your mind, your   thoughts. &nbsp;        And ‘to love’ is your purpose. &nbsp;   &nbsp; –Lauren   Antuofermo

    v&nbsp;     Whatever   you think, whatever you say, whatever you do—always, always come from a place of   love.&nbsp;  --Deanna

    v&nbsp;     Everything   in life--every thought, every feeling, every intention, every situation, and   every moment is a &#39;call&#39; to   Love.&nbsp;  –Pamela/Deanna

    v&nbsp;     Even   though it may not seem like it at times, life is a totally safe, purposeful, and   magnificent adventure amidst forever.&nbsp;   –Mark Pitstick

    v&nbsp;     Your   life’s path is perfect for you as imperfect as it may seem.&nbsp;   –Jeffery Olsen

    v&nbsp;     You can   better handle life’s inevitable challenges with the knowledge of your eternal   nature.

  &nbsp; –Mark Pitstick

    v&nbsp;     One of my   goals as a scientist is to make the unknown more known and the invisible more   visible.&nbsp;  Understanding more of the   greater reality is a major key to personal and planetary transformation.&nbsp;   –Gary Schwartz

    v&nbsp;     We’re not   talking about religious faith, we’re talking about empirical evidence and the   physics of reality.&nbsp;  –Peter Fenwick

    v&nbsp;       We   now have replicated university-based scientific studies that demonstrate life   does not end when the earthly body dies. &nbsp;I encourage&nbsp;you to let this great news   transform every aspect&nbsp;of your life.&nbsp;   -- Mark Pitstick&nbsp;

    v&nbsp;     Often our   greatest growth comes during the darkest hours of our lives.&nbsp;   –Sandra Champlain

    v&nbsp;     Life is an   education for one’s soul, and your life is important.&nbsp;   --Sandra Champlain

    v&nbsp;     Each of us   are an intricate, essential part of all of creation.&nbsp;   –Sharon Milliman

    v&nbsp;     Death is   merely the doorway to the next level of soul growth and evolution.&nbsp;   –Kevin Williams

    v&nbsp;     Because of   my NDE, I am closer to God and realize now that life is not a series of   consequences but of parallels and choices.&nbsp;   My choices directly affect those around me, and we are all   interconnected.&nbsp;  –Laurie L, NDEer

      v&nbsp;     Did your experience include   features consistent with your earthly beliefs?    Content that was   both consistent and not consistent with the beliefs I had at the time of my   experience. I believed in God and His Son, Jesus. That was consistent. I was   brought up to believe that there was only one true religion, and we needed to   find it. The one thing I have been allowed to remember was the answer to my   question about which is the true church on earth. He [Jesus] told me it didn&#39;t   matter, the name on the church door--the only thing that mattered was my   personal relationship with Him. That was something inconsistent with my raising.&nbsp;   –Babett W, NDEer

    v&nbsp;     It had been impressed upon   me that ‘love’ is really the only thing that matters. We shouldn&#39;t hate anyone.   God doesn&#39;t care about sexual preferences or whatever kind of sin we have done.   He truly loves us no matter what. Yes, I know Jesus loves my imperfect self and   the requirements that most people think make you a Christian (church, tithes,   perfect behavior) are not important as the human mind would think.&nbsp;   --Sarah S, NDEer

    v&nbsp;     Although I’m &#39;practicing&#39; [Chrisitianity],   I don&#39;t grant a central place to religion, as our life is dependent on our   connection with God and not on the obedience of rules and codes of practice.&nbsp;   –Frederic, NDEer

      v&nbsp;           &nbsp;    I   still try to emulate Jesus who has always been my example of how to live.&nbsp;   But now I am less concerned with the technicalities of His story.&nbsp;   I no longer care whether certain details are fact or fiction.&nbsp;   Nor do I care whether or not He is real or myth.&nbsp;   I know now that it doesn’t matter.&nbsp;   All that matters are His teachings.&nbsp;   I’ve embraced Jesus’ core teaching to ‘treat others as you’d want to be   treated.’&nbsp;  --Amy Call, NDEer

    v&nbsp;     Inasmuch as ye have done it   unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.&nbsp;   –Matthew 25:40

    v&nbsp;         I let my life unfold each day, making decisions from a place of love, not fear.&nbsp;   I feel liberated from cultural beliefs and patterns and do my own thing.  &nbsp; I, uncharacteristically, challenge   authority and the status quo and am outspoken. &nbsp; I&#39;ve   become very creative, surrounding myself with beauty--even writing poetry.  &nbsp; I am strongly drawn to help raise the   collective consciousness of the physical world.&nbsp;   –NDEer (name withheld)

    v&nbsp;       We are all connected to each other in a circle in a hoop   that never ends.&nbsp;  –Lyrics, “Colors   of the Wind”

    v&nbsp;       We are all appendages of the Divine.&nbsp;   –Anita Moorjani, NDEer

    v&nbsp;       We are each living, human expressions of   the Divine.&nbsp;  –Susanne Wilson

    v&nbsp;       We are each individual expressions of   God.&nbsp;  –Melanie Alberts, NDEer

    v&nbsp;       We are each, literally, co-creators with   God.&nbsp;  –Tony Woody, NDEer

    v&nbsp;       God is the creative force of which   everyone and everything is a part of.&nbsp;   --R Craig Hogan

    v&nbsp;       God is the unity of pure love and all   that exists—the highest vibration of unconditional love.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; –Mikey Morgan, channeled

    v&nbsp;     The image of God is the   emotion/energy of Love, and life is a constant work in progress.&nbsp;   –Ashley M, NDEer

    v&nbsp;     God is the   conscious force of all that exists.&nbsp; &nbsp; –Sharon   Milliman, NDEer

    v&nbsp;     We are all   brothers and sisters of God, within.&nbsp;   –Pamela Aaralyn

    v&nbsp;     Energy   cannot be created nor destroyed.&nbsp;  It   simply shifts form and vibration.&nbsp;    –Albert Einstein

    v&nbsp;     Treat   others as you would want to be treated.&nbsp;   It’s how it works.&nbsp;  –Kenneth   Ring&nbsp;  (Ref.:&nbsp;   the ripple or domino effect, and the law of reciprocity/karma)

    v&nbsp;     Every   action you put out creates a ripple effect, for good or for bad—like the ripple   made from a stone being tossed into a pond.&nbsp;   –Erica McKenzie/Renee Pasarow, NDEers

    v&nbsp;     The being   who led me into my life review showed me three different perspectives:&nbsp;   (1) through my own eyes, (2) through the eyes of everyone who I had ever   interacted with, and (3) was sort of an omniscient view. … With each   interaction, I got to feel what it was like to be on the receiving end of   whatever I was dishing out.&nbsp;    Whenever I gave someone pleasure, I felt it too, and whenever I caused someone   pain, I felt that too.&nbsp;  I remember   things I hadn’t thought about since my NDE had occurred when I was a very young   child. … There were things that I was profoundly ashamed of, and as I witnessed   these moments, I turned my attention to the being who I thought I was going to   get a lot of judgment from.&nbsp;  All I   got, in fact, was this huge outpouring of unconditional love.&nbsp;   The communication was that no one was going to judge me; I would judge   myself. … There was no such thing as right or wrong, only cause and effect&nbsp;   And I would determine what I had done well and what I needed to work on   and choose a course from there.&nbsp;    –David Beckman, NDEer

    v&nbsp;     The most important message I’ve learned from   the study of near-death experiences:&nbsp;   the little things in life (i.e., those small acts of kindness,   compassion, and service) are the big things.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   –David Sunfellow

    v&nbsp;     Life and   love are forever, and we are immortal.&nbsp;   Let us live accordingly.&nbsp;    --Mark Pitstick

    v&nbsp;     For   wisdom, enlightenment, and answers go within instead of without.&nbsp;   –Pamela Aaralyn

    v&nbsp;     Every   human being has the perfection of God within them.&nbsp;   –Lauren Antuofermo

    v&nbsp;     Neither   shall they say, Lo here!&nbsp;  Or, lo   there!&nbsp;  For, behold, the kingdom of   God is within you. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; –Luke 17:21

    v&nbsp;     No ye not   that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp; --1 Corinthians 3:18

    v&nbsp;     It is   entirely possible that behind the perception of our senses, worlds are hidden of   which we are unaware.&nbsp; &nbsp; –Albert   Einstein

    v&nbsp;     The day   science begins to study non-physical phenomena, it will make more progress in   one decade than in all the previous centuries of its existence.&nbsp;   To understand the true nature of the universe, one must think in terms of   energy, frequency and vibration.&nbsp;  –Niloka   Tesla

    v&nbsp;     Let us   live as if we were immortal.&nbsp;    –Aristotle

    v&nbsp;     The human   brain is not the source of consciousness but, instead, is a physical   receptor to all-encompassing consciousness.&nbsp;   –Alex Tsakiris

    v&nbsp;     Looking   for consciousness in the brain is like looking inside of a radio for an   announcer.&nbsp;  –Hassim Haramein

    v&nbsp;     If you will, think of your mind as a   television set, and your death as simply changing channels.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   --Roberta Grimes

    v&nbsp;     The   foundation of all existence is the nature of consciousness.&nbsp;   --Eben Alexander, NDEer

    v&nbsp;     The   science of consciousness talks about how the most synchronized energy possible   is love.&nbsp;  There is no incoherence in   it.&nbsp;  There is no separation in it.&nbsp;   Every wave of energy is absolutely coherent.&nbsp;   –Jane Katra, NDEer

    v&nbsp;       Consciousness is God, and we are all a part of that consciousness—each of us   being a unique lens of divine awareness.&nbsp; &nbsp; –Deanna

    v&nbsp;     If we find   the answer to why the universe exists, it would be the ultimate triumph of human   reason.&nbsp;  For then, we would know the   mind of God.&nbsp; &nbsp; –Stephen Hawking

    v&nbsp;     Your life   on earth is merely a thread in the fabric of your soul, and to “treat others as   you’d want to be treated” is written within the very fabric of the Universe.&nbsp;   –Eben Alexander, NDEer

    v&nbsp;     In my   experience, I saw that everything is almost like this fabric, this web that is   connecting us all together.&nbsp;  It was   more than just a cord; it was more like a web, like a fabric.&nbsp;   We are all interconnected with each other.&nbsp;   I am trying to describe it in our three dimensions, and it’s so much   more.&nbsp;  We don’t have such a   vocabulary, so it’s hard to describe.&nbsp;   –David Bennett, NDEer

    v&nbsp;     You do not   have a soul.&nbsp;  You are a soul.&nbsp;   You have a body.&nbsp;  –C.S. Lewis

    v&nbsp;     Mistakes   are simply lessons needed to motivate growth, and sins are merely learning   experiences--not stagnating operations in shame.&nbsp;   Like it or not, we all have to suffer through difficult growing pains   together in our winding journey toward unity.&nbsp;   Herein lies our salvation down this winding path back toward the Source.&nbsp;   –Roy Hill

    v&nbsp;     God does   not see behavior, including sin, in isolation, but rather developmentally and   holistically.&nbsp;  Evil is not viewed as   a static state but as a fluid means toward a perfectly evolving future.&nbsp;   For this reason, God’s expression of sin differs radically from the   emotionally-based judgments made by humans living in linear time.&nbsp;   –Roy Hill

    v&nbsp;     The Divine looks upon our mistakes as errors,   not sin. … Punishment is the consciousness of man (the ego); enlightenment and   correction is the consciousness of the Divine (Source) … God/Source does not   forgive because [he] never condemned. … It is not what you’re saved from but   what you’re saved for.&nbsp;  –Alan Cohen   (takeaways from A Course in Miracles)

    v&nbsp;     Adolph   Hitler:&nbsp;  a beloved soul of the   Divine, as we all are, who was so profoundly and severely spiritually retarded   (in spite of intellect) at that point of his soul’s evolution which led him to   do what he did.&nbsp;  –Kevin Williams&nbsp;   (~Oftentimes, atrocities of this magnitude ignite a profound spiritual   awakening—a wake-up call for change and growth--across the human conscious   collective.&nbsp;  –Deanna)

    v&nbsp;     Everything   is in utter chaos, yet, at the same time, everything is exactly as it should be.&nbsp;   –David Sunfellow

    v&nbsp;     I know I   am experiencing true oneness when delightful synchronicities unfold, reminding   me that what may seem random and coincidental is really part of a much larger   plan that I am being guided to follow.&nbsp;   –Anita Moorjani

    v&nbsp;     Humanity   is expanding, consciously, at ever-increasing rates with due credit given to the   development of the global internet.&nbsp;    And, this is the nature of spiritual evolution.&nbsp;   –Robert Kopecky, NDEer

    v&nbsp;     In our day   and age of the study of verifiable history, NDEs, and afterlife research—as well   as the dawning of the internet—we find humanity entering into a whole new era of   awakening.

    v&nbsp;     Life is   forever and continues on, seamlessly, no matter whether a being appears to have   a physical body or not.&nbsp;  It’s all   life—a dance of energy that is never-ending, but often changing.&nbsp;   –Mark Pitstick

    v&nbsp;     Life is   the dancer, and you are the dance.&nbsp;    –Eckhart Tolle

    v&nbsp;     We’re all   dancing in Christ-consciousness vibration.&nbsp;   &nbsp; –Brandon Beachum

    v&nbsp;     …and when   the earth has claimed our limbs, then shall we truly dance.&nbsp;   –Kahlil Gibran

    v&nbsp;     We are   slowed down sound and light waves--a walking bundle of frequencies tuned into   the cosmos.&nbsp;  We are souls dressed up   in sacred biochemical garments, and our bodies are the instruments through which   our souls play their music.&nbsp;  –Albert   Einstein

    v&nbsp;     Oh   hummingbird, mankind’s been waiting for you to come flying along.&nbsp;   Heavenly songbird, we were so wrong, we’ve harmed you.&nbsp;   Oh hummingbird, lend us your wings to let us soar through the atmosphere   of Abba. &nbsp; Lift us up to the Heaven[s] of   Holiness, oh Source of our Being, oh hummingbird…&nbsp;   –Seals and Crofts

&nbsp;

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     Whatever   your ideology or religion may be (even if ‘it’ may be a literal belief in   Tinkerbell), if that ideology or religion aids you in ‘be’coming’, then your   ideology or religion has succeeded for you. (Take into account, of course, that   one man’s medicine is another man’s poison).&nbsp;   Indeed, pure undefiled unconditional love transcends ideology.&nbsp;   For God is Love.&nbsp;&nbsp;   --Deanna

Love   is my religion, and humanity is my race.

  Kindness … has no Church.

Peace   … has no Religion.

  Compassion … has no Temple.

Love   … has no Borders.

Amy Call&nbsp;&nbsp;    (Because of her NDE, Amy felt the need to leave   Mormonism.)

Duane Crowther&nbsp;&nbsp;   Life Everlasting&nbsp;&nbsp;   (Multiple NDE stories validate, to a certain extent, Mormon theology.)

Betty Eadie&nbsp;&nbsp;   Closer to the Light&nbsp;&nbsp;   (Betty’s NDE led her to Mormonism, however, is no longer actively   practicing the religion.)

Claudia Edge&nbsp;&nbsp;   Gifts from the Edge:&nbsp;    Stories from the Other Side&nbsp;    (Because of her NDE, Claudia felt the need to leave Mormonism.)

Sarah Hinze &nbsp;&nbsp; Memories   of Heaven&nbsp;  (Sarah’s STEs led her   to Mormonism.)

Ralph Jensen&nbsp;&nbsp;   Taught by Christ&nbsp;&nbsp;   (Ralph’s NDE affirms the Mormon story.)

Jane Moe&nbsp;&nbsp;    Visions of Heaven&nbsp;&nbsp;    (Jane’s NDE led her to Mormonism.)

Jeffery Olsen&nbsp;&nbsp;   I Knew Their Hearts&nbsp;&nbsp;   (Because of his NDE, Jeff now views his Mormon faith tradition in a   metaphoric light.)

Ryan Rampton&nbsp;&nbsp;   (Ryan acknowledges the affirming metaphor of Mormonism because of his   NDE.)

Russell Ricks&nbsp;&nbsp;   Remember:&nbsp;  A Little Boy’s   NDE&nbsp;&nbsp;  (Russell’s NDE   affirms the Mormon story.)

Kim Rives&nbsp;&nbsp;    My Walk Thru Heaven&nbsp;&nbsp;    (Kim acknowledges the affirming metaphor of Mormonism because of her NDE.)

Julie Rowe&nbsp;&nbsp;    A Greater Tomorrow&nbsp;&nbsp;    (Julie’s NDE affirms both the Biblical and Mormon Story.)

Spencer (last name withheld)&nbsp;   Visions of Glory, written by John Pontius&nbsp;&nbsp;   (Spencer’s NDE parallels the Mormon Story and confirms the validity of   the evolution and authority of the LDS Church.)

    &nbsp;

In other words, a Catholic most likely might experience an   NDE with a Catholic spin, a Muslim most likely might experience an NDE with a   Muslim spin, a Mormon most likely might experience an NDE with a Mormon spin, a   Hindu most likely might experience an NDE with a Hindu spin, a Buddhist most   likely might experience an NDE with Buddhist spin, etc., etc., etc. …&nbsp;&nbsp;   And if the respective faith tradition is helping the individual *grow   spiritually, then, consequently, in the NDE, that person may be told that their   faith tradition is ‘true’ or ‘correct’.&nbsp;   Conversely, however, if the individual is being hampered, spiritually,   from their respective faith tradition (whatever it may be), they may be inspired   to leave the faith tradition from whence they’ve been following.&nbsp;   This is what I am finding, anyway, from all the research that I’ve done   thus far.

*Definition, ‘Spiritual Growth’ – the process of ‘be’coming

**I&#39;ve had the opportunity to visit, one-on-one, with both   Betty Eadie and Pamela Aaralyn and would love to share my experience with each   of them.&nbsp;  I, also, test-read one of   Roberta Grimes’ books for her as well as have collaborated with Dr. Mark   Pitstick.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    One near death experience, in particular, which especially has had a significant   impact on me would have to be that of Amy Call&#39;s NDE, posted September   2014 along with numerous others including that of Eben Alexander’s, Tricia   Barker’s, John Davis’s, Betty Eadies’, Krista Gorman’s, Alan Hugenot’s, Raymond   Kinman’s, Melinda Lyons’, Erica McKenzie’s, Sharon Milliman’s, Anita Moorjani’s,   Mary Neal’s, Jeff Olsen’s, Rajiv Parti’s, Renee Pasarow’s, Pamela Reynold’s,   George Ritchie’s, Tommy Rosa’s, Nancy Rynes’, Martha St. Claire’s, Jayne   Smith’s, and Howard Storm’s--just to name a mere few.&nbsp;
