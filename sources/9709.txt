I approached him. He looked up and said, 'Follow me.' We went into a cave. The cougar was on my left side and the man on my right. As we walked through the cave, I saw my life from birth until the present. When we got to the end of the cave, I saw a brilliant white light. The old man looked at me very sternly and said, 'Choose.' I guess I chose to live instead of going into that light.
