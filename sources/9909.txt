  		              		Experience Description   

    I've always been a fat man, weighing in at 264 pounds.  I have always struggled with my weight. I would diet, lose weight, and after a few years I would regain weight again. A few years ago, I got married and my weight was higher. So, I consulted with a family friend who is a gastroenterologist. He recommended having surgery to lose weight. I agreed to have a gastric band surgery. The doctor told my wife and parents  that the surgery would not take more than two hours, but it took five hours. When I came out, my wife said she was scared because my mouth was twisted with blood on it and there was also blood coming out of my nostrils. They asked the doctor what had happened and he told them that I almost did not make it because I went into cardiorespiratory arrest. 

  What happened to me, was that I fell asleep.  But at some point, I opened my eyes and  saw myself naked, with mud up to my knees.  I was  in front of a tunnel, but there was no light.  It was very dark, which scared me. The mud swirled around my knees  and then fell to ground level.  I saw myself as the one who was ahead or naked. There were snakes in the mud, like huge anacondas, that moved in the mud.  T hey  went up and moved  in circles in the tunnel. I was too afraid to  go in the tunnel, although   I felt the need to go in. I came back to my body  and woke up in the surgery.  

   I felt how they were doing the surgery and I started cursing until they put me back to sleep.  Afterwards, I woke up in my bed with my wife at my side. My chest was hurting me, because they were squeezing it.  I couldn't eat because it hurt when I swallowed.  I had to wash my nose because I had blood clots. 

  Much later, I had lost weight and one day I bought a motorcycle.    I was bringing some things with me and I heard a voice telling me to take off my helmet. I heard it like  there was someone behind me. He kept insisting, but I kept saying, 'No, it's dangerous.' Thanks to that decision, I am alive because I was run over a block later.  But the funny thing was that it was twelve o'clock during the day. There were no cars. But then a woman came out of a street and when she was passing, I was run over. My condition was very grave. I felt that something wanted to kill me.

Currently, I am more religious.  After these experiences, I am closer to God and all this negavity has disappeared. I wanted to tell my story because I need people to know my experience if it is of interest to them.
