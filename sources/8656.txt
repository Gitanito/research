Experience description: &nbsp;               I am not an expert on soul mates, but I     believe that I have found mine.&nbsp; When I was 17, I started having these dreams     about this wonderful person.&nbsp; They were odd dreams though.&nbsp; I would     essentially find myself in a dark room (that's the best I can describe but it     was more just like darkness) and he would be in there.&nbsp; We would have     wonderful conversations and I loved him from that moment.&nbsp; The odd thing was I     knew everything about him from these dreams including how many brothers and     sisters he had and that he was two years younger than me, but I could not make     out his face.&nbsp; It was a blur.&nbsp; In these dreams, he did always wear a striped     shirt and said he would wear a striped shirt when we met.&nbsp; 
  &nbsp;      I had these dreams about him almost     every night for a year and a half or so.&nbsp; Then when I was 18, I started     talking to this guy on the phone that I met through a friend.&nbsp; We never met,     but there was an instant connection.&nbsp; We could talk every night for hours.&nbsp;     After a few months we met.&nbsp; When I met him, I felt instantly like I will be     with him forever.&nbsp; He was wearing a striped shirt and was two years younger     than me.&nbsp;After we met, the dreams stopped.&nbsp;         
    We are each other's first love, and have been together 10 years.&nbsp; We finish     each other's sentences and know what each other wants.&nbsp; There will be times     when I am thinking of something and he knows exactly what it is.&nbsp; Also we have     never fought.&nbsp; People often look at us and tell us they can see we are in love     and admire that.&nbsp; I often wonder if he had the same dreams about me, but I     have never asked.    </body>
