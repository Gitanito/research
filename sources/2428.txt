CALCULATION oF NATIVI~IES.
HAVING, in .the former volume, given at large the rudiments ~f
the Aftral Science, I fhall now proceed to the real Calculation of
Nativities, according to the Placidian method as laid down and exempli-
aed in this work. 1 fhall begin witb that of my learned and very inge-
.Wous friend Mr. Witchell, Mafl:er of the Royal Academy at Portfmouth,
. a gentleman weU known in the literary world ; as well on account of his
valcable di'=overies in the ·longitude~ as for his very ufeful mathematical
publications.
'
· For the eafe and infl:ruaion of the reader, I fhall go through every cal-
culation of this nativity in the moll: praCtical and intelligent manner, in
order that it may affi>rd every neceffarv.e;x:ample for direatng fignificators
to promittors, in aU caf~ wbatfoever, as well as to filow the probabk .
efFects to be deduced therefrom in nativities in general. I

To GAIN THE POLE oF SATURN.
Saturn being in twenty-three degrees thirty-eight minutes of Aquarius,
enter with this degree and minute in the Tables of SeminoClurnal Arches
for the ldtitude of birth, which is in Lotidon, and it 3ives feven hours
eleven minutes; which being anfwerabJe to the fpace of three boufes, or
11inety degrees of the zodiac, J divide it by three, and one of thefe three
parts will be the difiance from the cufp of the fourth to tbe cufp of the
~fth houfe; then by the rule of proportion find the difiance of Saturn
from the fourth hnufe, as follows: Th~ third part of feven hours eleven
minutes is two hours twtnty-three minutes and forty feconds, which
time convert into degrees by the Table for that purpofe, in page I 96;
by which it is found to give thirty-five degrees fifty-five minutes for the
fpace of one houfe. The pole of the fifth, as may be found by the Table
in page 192, is twenty-three degrees twenty-feveo minutes.
The right afcention of Saturn, with latitude, is 326 21
The right afcenfion of the fourth is - - 309 14
Subtral't, and there remains I 7 7
The difiance of Saturn from the fourth houfe. Then fay, by the rule
of proportion, If thirty-five degrees fifty-five minutes, the fpace of one
houfe, give, for the pole of the fifth, twenty-three degrees twenty-feven
minutes, what will feventeen degrees feven minutes, being the dill:auce
of Saturn from the fourth, give?
To find this proportion, make ufe of the Logiftical Logarithms, as be-
fore, and {eek the logarithm belonging to the two }aft-mentioned num-
bers, which add together, and then find the logarithm of the firfi, and
fubtraa it from them, and ·the remainder is the proportion required.
Thus, feek in the uppermoft column at the head of the logarithms for
twenty-three, aud in the tide column for twenty-feven, and in the angle
of meeting is the logarithm 4080
In the fame mannei· feek feventeen on the top, and feven
on the fide, and in the angle is - 5447
Add them together, and they give 9527
Then feek. the logarithm of thirty-five degrees fifty-five
minutes by the fame rule, and it is 2129
Which is to be fubtraCted from the above 7298

THE METHOD OF OBTAINING THE POLE OF THE PART OF
FORTUNE,
Which was found to be feven degrees fix minutes.
With a view to make this work entirely complete, I have, in page 132,
given the fyftem laid down by Argol and Morinus, for findiug the an-
tifcions of the planets ; but, as that method is now obfolete, I 1hal1, ac-
- cording to a former promife, give the Placidian method of taking them;
which is the true way, and which I recommend to every ftudent to prac-

The place of Saturn in the zodiac is twenty-three degrees thirty-eight

In the fame manner is found the antifcion or zodiacal paralJel of Jupi-
ter, whofe pla-ce is twenty-nine degrees fifty-fiye minutes of Taurus, and
his declination nineteen degrees thirty-nine minutes, with thirty-five
minutes of fouth latitude. But, as there is no Table of Declination for
· Taurus, that of Scorpio, being oppofite, muft be entered under north
' latitude, which is equally ·the fame as having a Table of Declination for
Taurus, by obferving always to enter with contrary latitude; and feek in
the firft column under o for nineteen degrees thirty-nine minutes, (p. 537.)
and it will give twenty-feven degrees twenty-fix minutes of Scorpio and
Taurus for Jupiter's zodiacal parallel, and alfo two degrees thirty-four
minutes of Leo and Aquarius, as may be found by the aforenatned Table
of Antifcions.
The pofition of Mars in the heavens is in forty-four miqutes of Virgo,
and his declination fourteen degrees fifteen minutes, with three deO'rees
twelve minutes north latitude. I enter the Table of Declination in Virgo,
p. 533, under the column o; but find no fuch declination, therefore I
feek in the Table of Leo, p. 531, in the fame column under o at the top,
and find it points to twenty-two degrees two minutes of Leo and Aqua-
rius, and feven degrees fifty..:eight minutes of Scorpio and Taurus ; which
give the zodiacal parallel of Mars.
The mode offinding the Sun"s antifcion, or zodiacal paraHel, is exaclly
..the fame as given by Argol ·and Morinus; and the reafon is, becaufe the
Sun never varies, but always moves in the fame line throughout all the

figns of the zodiac. The antifcions of'the ·Sun, therefore,. faU in·twelve·
degrees feventeen minutes of Aries and Libra,. and feventeen degrees
forty-three minutes of Virgo and Pifces.
The mode of afcertaining the antifcions or zodiacal parallels of Venus
differs from that of the Sun, becaufe Venus has latitude. The place of
Venus io the zodiac is_five degrees twenty~one minutes~ her 9ecl~a~ion
is eight degrees forty-fevet'l minutes, and her latitude fifty-two minutes
fouth; and, as there is no table of d~clination for the fign Pifces, I take
the oppofite fign Virgo, as be(ore, and feek for eight deg~ees forty-fe.ven
minutes in the column with 0 on the top, and it will be found anfwer-
able to feven degrees ·thirty·min~tes of Virgo and Pifces, and twenty-two
degrees thirty min~tes of !..ibra an~ Aries ;_
thofe pl~ces being eq.ui-difta~
from the two troptcs. ·
- The antifci~n· o;·zodiacal parallel of Mercury is gaine~· in the. ~~ane
manner as theformer ; his place being in twenty-five degrees fifteen mi~
nutes of Aries, his latitude ·three degrees feventeen minutes north; apd
his declination twelve degrees fifty-two minutes in Aries; but, as there
is no table for Aries, it is to be worked by the contrary fign Libra.; but,
not finding in the column of n.
o latitude that degree of decliuation, I
enter the fign Scorpio, and find it anfwerable to tnree ·degrees fifty.;.five
minutes of thal fign, and three degrees fifty-five·minutes· of Taurus, flnd .
t\v~nty-fix degrees five minutes of Leo and Aquarius-. · · ·
· The antifcion or paralfel of the Moon cannot in·any cafe be 'direaed,,
file having twenty~fix degrees forty-two minutes of declinat~on,. an«l the
g_.r~ateft declination of the ecliptic is but twenty-three degrees thir~y-two.

Let it be remembered,. that the cufps of the afcendant,. feventli,".mid:..
heaven, and imum creli, are ·angles in the world, and are defcribed by
the fpheres to cut the globe of this earth in four equal parts, or quarters,,
each quarter containing ninety degrees of the equator. A mundane pa-

CONSIDERATIONS refulting from the FIRST HOUSE.
What this houfe imports, we have fully explained in the former part
of this work ; and, according to the maxims there laid down, we 1hall
purfue the enq~ry, occafionally adding or repeating fuch rules and apho-
rifms as are ind1fpeufably necelfary to illufrrate the fubjecl.

...._
I. Will the Native live to Ytars of Maturity ? ·
To determine this, we mufr confider what the configurations are
that early cut the thread of life, and dellroy the bloffoms of our infant
date. They are as· follow. t. If the birth be precifely on a new or
full Moon. :t. If the Moon be in conjunCtion of Saturn or Mars, in
the fixth, eighth, or twelfth, houfes of the 6gure. 3· If the Moon be
in quartile or oppofition of Saturn or Mars in the fourth houfe. . 4· If
the Moon be befieg~d by the Sun or Mars. ·S· If an eclipte impedite
the light of time in the hour of birth. 6.. If all the planets be fub..
terranean, and neither the Sun, Moon, nor lord of the afcendant,
effentially fauiGed.- ---1• If the two malefics be.conjoined in the afcen-
dant. 8. If an infortune .in the afcendant vitiate the deJroes thereof
by quartile or oppofition. 9· If the lon.l of the afcendant be combuft
of the Sun, and at the fame time cadent and retroO'tade. ro. If the
Daagon'i bend or tail, be in conjunCtion of Satllfn or Mars in ~e fourth.
Thefe configua ations~: by long and invariable experience, are found to
deftroy life in infanc1, unlefs the beitefic rays of Jupiter or Venus in-
terpofe, and, by joiJ1mg in the afpecrs, modify and remit their malignant
etfecr. B\lt let it always be remembered, that Mars hath greater power
of defrroying life, when pofited in Aries and .above th~ earth, in a
diurnal nativity; and Saturn when pofited. in ~apricorn a110 'above the
earth, in a noCturnal nativity. · ·
Thcfe being the tefiimonies of a Chort life, by comparing them with
the afpeCts of any genethliacal figure, we may .readiJy determine whe-
ther the child born under it will live to years of maturity. If we exa-
mine this geniture by the foregoirig rules; we thaiJ not lind a tingle tef-
timony of a Chort life ; but, on the contrary, that the nat'ive ibould run
the common race of man-!hould be nouri1bed up, under the influence
of more benevolent fiars, even until the Apheta, or giver of life, thall
come by a regular and unoppofed.direCl:ion, to a na_tural union with ita
Promittor, which cuts ofF life, and, by the·ei"eaa of a natural caufe, fends
us in quiet to the grave.--Let it tKere'fere be remembered, as an invaria-
ble ma"im,. that, whenever tbe A:ph~ta i$ tl}u$ unobftrutled, ~be native
will·fur"ive :aU the perils of ita iuf.aot fiate_

Thefe are afcertained by mixing the influences of the feveral figni fi-
cators together, and by allotting to each its fpecific quality, in order
to determine which fhall predominate, and affeCt the confiitution. .of
the uative with the greateft force. For, as there are four principal
elements whereof this univerfe is compounded, viz. fire, air, earth, and
water; fo are there four principal humours in the temperature of man,
which correfpond with them, viz. choler, blood, melancholy, and
phlegm ; and according as thefe are equally mixed, or predominate
confiitutionally in the body, fo fhall the temperature and complexion
of the native be. To difcover how thefe qualities are difpenfed in the
prefent infiance, we mufi confider and examine the configurations at
the time of conception, as well as at the birth. By the direCtions
given with the Table, p. 412, we fhall find the conception of this na-
tivity took place 011 the 16th of June, 7h. 30m. P. _

pt~vail in a geniture, the native wilt be phlegmatic; 'if cotd ar~d drynefs
bJve the fup~riority, he w•JI acquire a rc.tferved hauit, and be oppretfed
with ~tancholy ; if hfat gud moifiure predmninate, he will prove of a
fanguine temperature, and of an even courteous difpolition ; if he~t and
drynefs, he will be choleric, and of a furl.v temper; bur, where the quali-
ties ~f the conngurating Hars are n~arly equal, the native will be ftrongly
affeeted by their temperaturas refpettively, when under a ldire&ion of their
own uature artd quality.
The temperature bei:ng determined, we may with grea-t eak a.feertt{ln
the complexion by the rules heretofore laid down4 Libra anel Scorpio,
beittg the 6gns afcending, give a fanguine complexion .; but, rt1 this tt&-
h.Yity, not ·very fair nor clear, becaale oppofed by the oppofite effelt: of
Mars, Venus, and the Moon; a·nd becauie phlegm wa-s the fuperabandat!t
quality in the tempe-rature at birth. The mixture of thefe fevcral fign~fi..
au·or& produce a fallow complexion, grey eyes, light fandy hair, with c!ae
conformity in tbe. other members; to which defcriptien this· native
ilttclly correfpottded in every particular.
·The foregoiNg judgmeHt wiU ho1d good in ~11 cafes where firrrifai
c~utiguratioes are found. Let it be refn.embered, ·tlbat enty·four di-fiiin~
cofoun or eomplexions are produced, viz. black, \Ybtte, red, and yellow·;
an others proceed from a mi~ture of thefe, and are afcerta'i-ned by affigu~
ittg to eaeh Ggnifit:aror its: own proper colour; then colleCt the whole' into
()ne fum, and according to the quality, number, and force, of the fever•l
teft·imonies, judieiouOy incorporated with eaeh other, wiH t·he complexion
be accurately found. Regard mufi however be had 'in all cafes to t-he
climate where the nat'ive · is born ; becaufe in fuch· parliS of the eartn
where the ligns and tigflificators have from their allronomical pofitjon~
greater force and energy, they wiH more vifibly affea, and more fenfrbty'
demon.firate their influence upot!, the pedot\s born under them. ThiSi, l
believe, has been fufficiently demonftrated in the introductory pa'rt 6f
this work.
1•11. Form and Sfaturt if tht Body.
To- jud~ of t-he' form and ltature of the body, we muA: note the 1\~ti:
that oceurtes' the afcendanr, the lord thereof, and the planets pofited
therein, or in eonjunCtion with the lord of the afcendan-t. 'Thefe va-·
rio~ figntfieators are to. be regarded .in rfifoportion to their dlig·
nities,-

for in many cafes they operate much, particularly thofe of the firft mag-
nitude. This being premifed, and the rules heretofore laid down being
had in memory, we {hall demontlrate their certainty, by applying them
to our judgment in this figure. ·
Upon the afcendant we find the latter part of the degrees of Libra,
and about two thirds thereof occupied by Scorpio ; thefe figns gh·e a
ftature fomewhat above the middling. But we mull: add to thete the
tefiimony of the configurations; that Venus is poftted in the watery
fign Pifces; that Mars aud the Moon arc occidental of the Sun, each
. beholding the atcendant ; and that the Moon participates with the na-
/,4...:, .., ,d:.. ~~ turc of Capricorn, her place in the figure. Thefe are arguments of a
wt-vr~~ .._,-.- mean fiature, and of a mediocrity in the component parts, uniform,
.,~~ ~~ and duly proportioned. Libra and Scorpio declare an exact fymmetry
Z /JI'tJ__,.of features, .oval face, and elegant co~nten~nce ; bu~ Sat~•rn, ~ho pro-
7 . duces the direct contrary effeCts, hav&.ng hss exaltation m Ltbra, ·and
s--__. .-......
/~beholding the afcendant with a thong afpeCl, greatly mars the beauty
~~I . and comelinefs derived from thofe figns; yet we are not to fuppofe that
. . r the delicacy and fweetnefs contributed by the firfi: fignificators ihall be
A :!~ ? .;1 converted into a dark lowering vifage Saturnine ; but that the quality of
~~ '/ t?f -) Saturn, in proportion to his firength of afpeCt, thall be incorporated with
J1~.;. -/ /£. the oppofite qualities, leaving the impreffion firfi given by Libra, but
-' ../A. :~ abating its beauty and comeliuefs, and making the face moderately fair,
~ v~Yy-,_......... · ~ and the features not altogether unpleafing. 'I his exactly defcribes the
'f ~ -~ ~perfon of the native ; of a middle ftature, oval lively features, the ftamp
z.. -;1 ~ ~- - of the 1igns; dark eye-brows, the mark of Saturn ; with a fprightlinefs,
2 · 17 t~refulting from Mercury conjoined with the other tigoi6cators. We may
7 remark further, that in genitures where the Sun has no afpect with the
/rl..wl ../~.-J. afcendant, the native acquires th~ habit of bending forward in his g~it ;
. ~ ""- and, as he gradually advances m years, becomes round and ftoopmg
~e.- ,.,.._ "fli/ in the thoulders. This has been remarkably verified in the prefent
J( /:~ ··· nativity. ·
In drawing judgment from the premifes, let it be well confidered,
that, if two planets have equal dominion in the horofcope, the pre-
ference mufi be given to. him that beholds the afcendant mofi par-
tially ; but, if their configurations with the afcendant iliould be equally ·
dignified, regard the planet that is lord of the houfc:, in preference to
that which has only his exaltation therein. Remember likewife, in the
further progrefs of this enquiry, that when the planets are .fituate
in airy or fiery .figns, they givelarge full ftatures ; but, when in earthy
or watery, they produce much thorter and fmaller. When they have

great north latitude, they denote large corpulent bodies ; but, when
they have great fouth latitude, they induce a fpare, thiu, and low, figure;
and, according to the immortal Ptolemy, thofe natives whofe fignificators
have fouth latitude are more aClive and laborious; whiUl: thofe whofe
ruling planets have great north latitude are ufually of a heavy, Hothful,
fupiue, inaClive, difpofition.
f IV. Temper, ·Quality, and mental Endo'l.ummts, ofthe Native.
This is one of the moll: effential (peculations of the whole Science,
fince, in a general w~y, the fuccefs of all our worldly purfuits and ac...
quifitiA~lS in a great meafure depends upon our mental endowments.
And here the reader would do well to refrelh his memory with what ·
we have already premifed ou this fubjeCl, in p. 428, &c. where it .is
laid down, as an efiablilhed maxim, that our enquiry in this particular
is chiefly to be governed by the Moon and Mercury, and by the other
fignificators only as they lhall be configurated with thefe planets, or
with the Sun, or with the angles of the figure ; of which the afcendaut,
or eafiern angle, hath the greatell: power. Therefore, if feveral planets
are found in the afcendant, they will all aa in a certain degree upon
the bent and motions of the mind, and will become fignificators in
proportion to their refj>eClive pofitions and dignities. Their influence
upon the fenfitive faculties of the animal fgul, will be apportioned to their
ftrengtb of afpecr, and will operate by the fame rotation in which thofe
afpeCls come up. The time when they lhall refpeClively begin to ope-
rate, together with their duration, is kno\1\'n only by direClion, as we
filall prefently lhow ; and their etfeCl will be found to vary, as the
irradiations are transferred from one planet to another. For inll:ance,
when the M.oon is direCled to the terms or afi>eCl of the moll: potent
planet in the afcendant, then the native almofi wholly participates in
the temperature and quality of that planet, and, while it operates, wiU
vifibly manifeft them to the world in his aClions. And thus, when the
Moon varies her.term or afpea, and applies to thofe of another planet,
tbeu will the native's inclination vary, aud affume the qualities and con-
ditions of fuch other planet.
-~By. the fame force of fympathy we find, that, when the Moon comes
to the terms or afpeCl of Venus, the native is gay and cheerful; when
to the terms or aipeCl of Jupiter, fober, induftrious, and difcreet; to ·
the terms or afpeCl of Saturn, grave, melancholy, and referved ;, to the
radiations of the Sun, proud, and inclined to vanity and ofi:entation ;
to the terms or afpea of Mercury, frudious, laborious, and inquititive;..

Moon comes to her own terms, or in afpea with her radical place in the

When there are no planets to be fom1d in the afcendant, note what
configuratiom are made with the Moon and Mercury; for whatever
planet is joined with them, will become figuifica·tor, and will aa upon
the mental endowments of the native. But if no planet be in the afcend·

tion. A flrong infiance this, ·of the contrary effects of the afp~as; for,
while the firfl impreffion of ari ·even and complacent difpofition is de-
range<l by the force of a partile oppofition, the other laudable qualities
are enlarged, by the congenial influence of a trine afpetl: of the fame
planet with its dipofitor, in the exaltation ofMercury! Thefe tefiimonies
are much ftrengthened by the fefquiquadrate afpect of Mars with the
Moon, in the terms·of Jupiter ; and, as the Moon is pofited in the dig-
nities of Saturn, it fuows that the native wiU be attached to the arts and
. fciences, and inherit a truly ·honeft difpofition.
Thus far we have confidered the configurations which form the
temper,· and give the·firfi bias to the mind, in the earliefi fiate of in-
fancy : but ·What fhalJ be .the refult, as, they graduaJly ripen into
.maturity; to what (peculations they will be dire8ed, and to what
extent of petfeClion the native may arrive in mental acquirements and
abili~y.; ·is d¢termined by other confiderations. The intelle8ual fa-
~ties. in •ALL genitures, are under the afiral influence of Mercury
and ·the M0ot1.· 'Mercury governs the rational and animal fpirit in the
\)rain, but the vegetive ftrength of the brain is folely under the power
and dominion of t-~?e Moon ; therefore, whenever we infpetl: a nativity,
and find tbefe ftgnificators wen ·affeCl:ed to each other in terms and
afpea, we may fafely conclude that there is a proportionable harmony
and modulation in the rational intellect, and in the other members
which contribute· to a fertile .genius, and to ftrong natural parts. But,
when• thefe fighificators are ill affeCled, and in quartile· or oppofition to
each~ other, ·it·is altogether as fure a prefage of a dull capacity, and
a narrow contracted mind ; particularly if Mercury be combuft, flow
in motion, cadent, or peregrine, or atHi.cted of the infortunes, more
efpedally of Mars. And thus, the more Mercury ·is afHitled or im-
peded in his own proper nature, the more weak and ihallow we always
find the mental endowments of the native. In thofe genitures where
Mercury is occidental, and in no afpea with the Moon, or with any
benefic planet, it produces a deep, cunning, artful, clofe, diffembling,
perfon, with a fl:ron~ 1bare ·of penetration and fagacity, but with a mind
difp0fed to exercife 1t only in mean and felfifh purfuits, without regard
t~ ·integrity or reputation~ If this planet be found in the combufi way,
i. e.. in that fpace of the heavens extending from feventeen degrees of

Let us apply this reafouing· in our coofider~tiQJlli -of ·th4 :pr$foClt -gef!
niture; in which we find Mercury and tbe Moon, ~he grand ·.patr.oos
of mental ability, are favourably fituated with rcfpea. to each· other.'*-
Here is a remarkable reception betweell Mercury and Mars, tbe joict
rulers of the afcending flgn ; Mercury poffeffes the dignities of Mars,
aud Mars the exaltation of Mercury. Thus the 6gni6cator of the·tem-
per and fathion of: the mind, and the patron of fenfe, are mutually
conjoined in the fa~e influence ; and befpeak not ouly a difpofition to
fearcb after literary ~quirements, but prefage a fit .capacity to receive,
and an underfianding capable of digefting, them. The Moon likewifc
fends her fefquiquadrate ray to Mars, from the dignities of Saturn, and
in the terms of Jupiter, which declares the favourite purfuit q/ the
native fhall be after fcientific knowledge; and, as the pofition of Mara
is fo highly elevated, it is evident that his endeavours ihall not Oaly
prove fuccefsful, but thall be manifefted in an eminent degr-ee, _..W-e
have alfo a perfect fextile afpect of Mercury and Saturn ; which adds
a fironfu retentive memory to a folidity of mind,twhereby the .ctarJy put"fi
fuits o the native are impelled forward, and ripene.d into m~turit1~o
under the united fanClion of reputation and pro~ . .Thu$ the Ggnifi..;
cators of the temper, quality, and mental emlowments, of this uativ~
when drawn into one focus, teftify, according to the approved rul~s of
this Science, an acute penetrating wit, an enlargc:d uuderftaoding, t
retentive memory, and a thong predilection for 1cientific knowlcsd~
with a folidity of mind, and a confiftency of manners, well adapfACI ~,tQ
give vigour and fuccefs to fuch purfuita. That thefe gift$ were fev4--.,
and refpectively verified in the perfonal qualification&, purfuits, "uc:lr~
ferments, of the native, the united tcftimony of all his friends and rc•
tj.ves will not only prove, hut the faCta will hereafter be ll)Ore miJl1Jtely-.

Hence it will be feen, that Mercury, in this judgment, and io all ,e~ I

Much has been contended by the advocates For and again'£1: this [pe-
culation, on the fcore of education. For my own part, I cannot but
be furprifed, that any argument or controverfy fuould have been fo long
fupported, upon inferences fo palpable and obvious. Thofe who con-
tend, that education fets thefe afrral influences at defiance, and pro-
duces the wife man or the fool, in proportion to the extent of his aca-
demic acquirements and difcipline, might as well attempt to perfuade
us, that the barreu deferts of Arabia, by labour and cultivation, would
fooo vie with the fertile banks of the Nile, and become a land
flowing with milk and honey. Earthly fubfiances, as well animate as
inanimate, receive tb.e ilamp of their natural quality in the. hour of
formation. This quality will remain as long as thefe fubfiances endure,
in every cafe except where the laws of nature incline them to mutation
or change. All the inventions of man are far ihort of totally removing
thefe firfr qualities ; and therefore all that can be fairly deduced from
argument in fupport of the effi:Cls of educatioo, is briefly this ; that it
afroniihingly enlarges a gopd natural uuderfianding, and puts a fuper-
ficial glofs O'\!er the deformities of a naturally bad one ; but, fo far from
giving vigour to a wca.k mind, it too often leads to the oppofite ex-
treme, for w,ant of ability to digefr, and iQtellect to comprehend, the in-
firuchon it receives. · ,
Hence we frequently fee inventions of the mofi ingenious and com-
plicated extent fpring from individuals who appear as ignorant as they
are untaught; yet, when we aome to examiue their internal endow-
ments, we exprefs our admiration that fo much ingenuity and fierling
fenfe ihould be concealed under the rufi: of what is termed a Jtate of
nature. But let the reader regard with due attention the obfervations I
have laid down; let him~ within the circle of his own acquaintance, if
he can obtain a fpecuhrm of their nativities, obfe ve the nature of thefe
configurations, and I will venture to affirm, at the hazard of my life,
that be will be able to trace the true quality and tent of each man's
. mental capacity, from the caufes which give them being.
CONSIDERATIONS refulting from the SECOND HOUSE.
The principal judgment drawn from this part of the genethliacal
figure, is that which regards worldly riches and preferment; or rather,
whether the native ihall be buoyed up upon the wings of profperity, or
plunged by auverfe fiars into the depths of advedity. This fpecu-
Jation has been jufrly confidered one of the moil: important of the fcience;

boufe, in a diurnal nativity, in afpetl with Jupiter or Venus, declareS'
increafe of fubfiance by the death of relatives or friends. The fame
event will take place, in genitures where the lord of the eighth houfe~
in his elfectial diguities, is placed in the tenth ; and again, where the
difpofitor of the tenth is well configurated with the lord of the afcend-
ant. When Jupiter or Venqs are fo pofited at birth, as to behold the
cufp of the fecond houfe with a good afpecr, it is a certain prefage of
durable fubftance ; whereas the Sun, or Mars, pofited in the fecond
houfe and ill dignified, fcatter the native's wealth, induce to pro-
d~ality, and eventually make him poor. So the Moon in conjunction
ot Saturn, in l>ad places of the figure, and beheld by no benefi9 ray"
will reduce even theJon of a king to a ftate of infolvency ! The lord of
the fecond houfe combuft, antt the part of fortune in anaretic placei,
forelhows ·confifcation of property, bankruptcy, and ruin. When the
Part of Fortune is confederated with violent fixed ftars in evil places
of the figure, it prefages lofs of fubfi:ance, and great poverty. To de-
termine .the mode by which thefe events thall happen, or how fub-
ftance or profperity will be acquired, we are to regard the nature and
quality of the houfes over which the fignificators have domin~on.. Thus,
if the lord of the eleventh houfe give virtue and;intluence to the 6gnifi-
cators of fubfi:ance by propitious rays, we are to conclude, that the 113:--
tive will receive an increafe ·of wealth through the medium of relations
or friends. But, if the lord of the feventh be thus irradiated, his fub-
ftance will be increafed by marriage, partnerthip, or fome joint concern•.
' An.dt bus judgment is drawn in all cafes from the nature of the houfe$.
which the feveral fignificators govern or irradiate.
. To obtain a proper idea, not only which way r-iches and profperity
~re likely to come, but to decide alfo whether they thall be obtained by.
lawful or dithonourable means, we mull: note whether the b~nefic pia~
nets are fignificators ; and, if they are no.t affliCted by the malignant rays.
of Saturn or Mars, nor in conjunaion with any violent fixed fiar, it
1hows the native will acquire eminent profperity by fair and honourable
means. But, if a malevolent ftar be 6goificator; and ·the benefic.
planets in no afped with him, and either retrograde or combufi, it in-
duces the oppofite effeCt. If a benefic planet be .fignificator, aud placed in
the dignities of either of the male£ics, it 1hows wealth will be obtained.
both ways. To kuow whether riches, when obtained, will be durable or
uot, we mufi: confider whether the tignificators are fo pouted in the
heavens, as to . be unimpeded by the intercourfe of the .malefics; fot:
then profperity lhaLl continue during life. But, if the benefics are
~gnificatolS, and fituated in bad places of the figure, and the iofortunes_
occupy.

occupy the good, fo as to obfcure or overcome the energy of the benefic
rays, it 1hows a continual flux and reflux of wealth ; Jo that what is ob-
tained under a good direCtion iliall be loft under a bad one. But the
time when t hefe things iliall feverally come to pafs, can only be
known by equating the dire8ions of each afpea, which is the only true
and rational way of difcovering when they iliall begin to operate.
CONSIDERATIONS refulting from the THIRD HOUSE.
The third houfe difcovers, by the afpeas with which it is configu-
rated,. whether we iliall be advantaged or injured by the confanguinity
of brethren, or by inland journeys and fojournments ; which we have
fully explained in p. 290, &c. The fi~a~aficators of brethren or fillers
are taken from five degrees·prece~ing the cufp of the thit·d houfe to
within five degrees of the cufp of the fourth .houfe. And the lord of
the third houfe, or the planets accidentally· pofited therein, ilialt be
the fignificators. We are .then particularly to remark the pofition of
Mars, which is the gen~ral fignificator of brethren,-or the Moon, which
reprefents fillers. If Mars or the Moon be found in fruitful figns, or
in good afpea with the fruitful planets, which are Jupiter, Venus, or
the Dragon's Head, it is an argument that the native ·thall have brothers,
if the configurations are made with Mars ; or· fitl:ers, when made with
the Moon ; and the number 1hall be according to the irradiations and
force of the afpeas. · If a good and benevolent configuration is formed
between thf' lord of the afce11dant and the lord of the third houfe, it im-
plies mutual good offices, harmony, and concord, between brothers and
lifters; but, if bad .afpeas are found, then vice verfa, malice, hatred,
envy, and iJI-will, exift among them. · When Jupiter, Yenus, or the
Dragon's Head, are pofited in the third houfe, the native will derive ad-
vantage from travel, or by change of habitation ; and will be aided by
. the good fellowiliip of his own family. .
. To determine thefe quefrions in the prefent nativity, I obferve that
~ ~ 7 Capricorn has the principal rule in the third houfe; which being a fign

and indeed, the Moon being in an evil afpea with the Sun, and ap-
proaching to a quartile with Mercury, is no argument of durable life to
fillers.

lifters. As to brothers, we have not a fingle teftimony to produce
them.· Mars, the natural fignificator of brethren, is pofited in a barren
tigu, and in no good afpeCt with any planet, except in reception of Mer-
cury, which operates not in favour of fruitfulnefs, becaufe he alfo is po-
fited in a barren fi~n. Thefe are arguments to prove the n_ative was the
only fon, or at leatt the only one that ihould come to matunty, or engage
in the viciffitudes or concerns of this life. ·

by means of brothers or ufters, nor any difadvantage from travel or change

the native, who has uniformly changed his fituation and reftdence for
greater profit and preferment. ·
CONSIDERATIONS arifing ftom the FOURTH HOUSE.
From ,this houfe we obtain judgment ·of the bative's hereditary ac-
quifitions; the fubftance he thall derive from his father; his houfes,
lands' hereditaments, &c. in which we are particularly to obferve, 1.
the fituation· of the lord of the fourth houfe; 2. the pofition of the Sun
in. a diurilal, and of Saturn in a ·noCturnal, nativity; .·and 3· ~hat p!anet
or planets ilre contigurated in this houfe. If the major part ·of thefe fig-
nificators are ·found fl:rong ·and well dignified., .u·nder benefic influences,
it is an. argument of much good .from the_'father ; but, if otherwife,
contrary effeCts will be produced. ·so the lord ot 'the afcendant, or the
Moon, in fe.x.tile or trine with the Sun by .day;· or with Saturn by
n·igbt, forethows unity and concord between the 11ative and his father ;
and, if the afpeCt be made w'ith reception, it will continue unto death,
and lead to an inheritance of the father's fubfiance. The fame·etfea is
produced by the lord·of the afcendant and the lord of the fourth houfe
in mutual reception. And again, if the Jprd of the afcendant be in good

afpea with the lord of the fourth ; or the Moon apply by benefic rays
to the lord of the fou·rth ; thefe are thong arguments of concord be-
tween the native and his father, and of advantage by inheritance. But,
if contrary afpefls govern this houfe, .the native and his father will be
at enmity with each other; and the more ferious and affiiaing will this
enmity be, and the more injurious to the n~tive's inheritance, in pro-
portion as the fignificators fuall be in adverfe pofitions, ill configurated,
void of reception, or affliCted in the angles. This rule invariably holds
good in all genitures. ·
On the cufp of the fourth houfe of this nativity we find almofi: feven
'degrees of the fign Aquaries, and Saturn ii1 dignities poftted therein, in
fextile with Mercury. Thefe are teftimonies of longevity in the father,
;ts well as .of ftrong mental endowments, and of refpectability among
mankind. We find Saturn difpofes of the Moon ; and Mars, w~o is
lord of the afcendant, calling a fefquiquadrate to the Moon, in reception
of Mercury, declares the native thould be regulated by a firong filial
atfeflion for his father, .and that in a more eminent degree than the fa-
ther for the fon. This is confirmed by Saturn, fignificator of the father;
being the fuperior planet, in a mafculine fign ; and..the fignificators of the
native being inferior, and' in feminine figns. -
As to the father's riches, they ~ufi: be deduced from the afpeas of
the benefics to the fourth houfe and the pofition of the part of fortune,
and the planets in the fifth houfe, which is the father's houfe of Cub-
fiance. Now Jupiter being in _quartile of SatuJtn, and in no afpea-
with either of the luminaries, are arguments that the father lhould not
increafe his fubftance ; and, as the part of fortune is in oppofition to
Saturn, it declares he lhould meet . with many loffes. And, although
Saturn is eljgibly pofited in the fourth, and might thereby proinife an
inheritance of landed property at the death of his father ; yet, as the part
of fortune is iu oppofitioo with Saturn, in the terms of Jupiter, and
Jupiter configurated with violent fixed fi:ars, it is clearly dem'onftrated.
that, through the eafe .and freedom of the father's difpofitien, accom-
panied with fome heavy loffes, he lhould at his death leave but a fmall
patrimony for the fon, when it thould happen at a very advanced time
· of life ; as is pr~diCted by the pofition of Saturn in the father'a afcendant,
which invariably gives old age, particularly when pofited in his own
digtlities.-Th.~f~ circumfiance$ preci(ely happened bQth to the father

CONSIDERATIONS refulting from the FIFTH.HOUSE.
. .
The (peculations upon this houfe afford the moll: fatisfaClory informa-
tion concerning the; native's iffue-Whether he lhall have children ; to-
get~er with tb~ir conditions, qualities and _fex.. Alfo whether the
natave thall denve any fuccefs from fpeculat1ve r1fk of property, fuch
as buying and felling in the funds, adventuring in the lottery, or con-
figning goods tQ the uncertainties of an unknown foreign market.-
Thefe feveral enquiries are defin.able from tbe. figure of every geniture,
and are fought out from the configurations in, or •relating to, the fifth
boufe ; and, as they are not of the leaft importance among the various
occurrences incide~1t to human life, I thall lay down fome feJeCt rules
for the more particular information of fuch of my readers as with to re-
duce the theory thereof into practice.
To know whether the native fllall have i1fue or not, particular rega~d
mull: be bad to the configurations in the firft, fifth, and tenth, houfes ;
and alfo to the afpefls formed. by the lords of thofe houfes; as alfo the
~leventh houfe. and its lord, becaufe .it is the fifth from the feventh.
If. thefe ~gnificators .are in fru!tful figns, then it is certain the ·Dative
will have alfue ; but, 1f they are an barren figns, the contrary e.fFed will
be produced.
•
But, as it feldom happens that the planets are wholly pofited in thefc
oppofite extremes, I thall fiate the effect of thofe configurations which ,
are cafually formed, and which lead to a full explanation .of all the
others. If the Sun, Saturn, or Mars, rule the afcendant, fifth, tenth,
or eleventh, houfes, without fome fruitful afpecl of the benefics, they
deny children. So Saturn in the fifth, or the Sun in quartile· to Jupi-
ter, will be found to work the fame barren eifeCl. If the Sun be con..;.
figurated with Saturn and Mercury in the eleventh or fifth, in afpeB
· with the Moon, it fllows the native will fcarcely have children ; or if
he thould, they will die fuddenly, in their infant fiate. The fame
planets conjoined in the midhQaven, and in quartile or. oppofition of
the Moon, produce the fame. Venus pofited in the firft <:>r feventb
houfe, in conjunCtion or oppo1itioQ of SatQrn, or in communicative
dignities, i. e. he in her ter,n, and 1he in his; or if Saturn be in Taurus,
and Venus in Capricorn ; it argues barrennefs in a male geniture, and
abortion in that of a fernale; or that what is produced fllall die ere it
hath feen the light. In like manner Saturn, if pofited in the afcendant,
wiU produc;e barreQnefs.1 or deftroy the. offSpring. So Mars in op~

fition of Jupiter or Venus de{l:r~ya th~ hope of iffue in the native ; and
Jupiter in oppofition to Saturn deftroys whatever is produc~d under it,
more efpecially if Jupiter happens to be lord of the fifth. But the moft
decifive teftimony of barrennef9, is when the lord of the fifth and the lord
of the afcendant are combuft AOO retrograde, unaided by beuefic ray.s,
and the Moon iu detriment.
If, on the contrary, the Moon and Mercury are pofited in the fifth
houfe, and their difeofitors u.naftliCl:ed, it is an argument tbat the na-
tive ihall have iffue. So likewife if Mercury be occidental, and in good
afpeCl to Jupiter or Venus, it produces children ; but if oriental, and
afBicted by Saturn, it denotes barrennefs. The Moon configurated with
Venus or the Dragon's Head ·in the fifth houfe, and a prolific fign on
the cufp thereof, is a certain proof of many children, and good. And
again Jupiter in trine afpeCl of the Moon, in moift fign~, or the Moon
with J u·piter or Venua in an angle, or i11 good afpea with the angles ;
declares the fame, and that they will be born to preferment. When
thcfe fignificators ·fall wholly in mafculine figns, the Hfue thall be all
males ; but, when they fall wholly in feminine figns, the offspring thall
be all females. Again, if the major part of the(e fignificators fall in maf-
culine figns, a1id the refidue in feminine, the native tbaU have moft boys ;
but, if the majority be in feminine figns, and the reft in mafculine, then
will he have moftly girls. •
i
The number of children thtf native thall have is determined by col-
leCting ·the number of teftimonies by which they are produced; for the
more fruitful planets, thai are fouad in the fifth or ~leventh houfes, and
, in fruitful figns, give the more childrea ; whereas, the fewer ·the planets
are tbat we find pofited in thofe heufes and figns, the fewer children will
be produced; and this ia a never-failing crit~rion ~hereby to judge. Let
· it alfo be remembered, that fruitful planets in bic,orporai figns produce
double, and in fruitful figns treble, the number. ·
The readieft and moft accurate way of determining the native's iffue ·
is to colleB: all the teftimonies of ··fruitfulnefs and fterility that appear
on the face· of the genitute into one table, as in the foregoing judg-
ment on the temperature and conftitution; and according to ·the majority
of figni6cators, Jet the inquiry be decided. If the fignilicators and figns
of fterility exceed in number and energy the fignificators of fecundity,
the native cannot have iffue. If thefe teftimonies happen to be equal,
then regard muft be had to a good revolution and direClion meeting to-
gether ; and if fuch thould occur, without any malefic influence, it' may

fa-fely be pronounced that the native will hav~ ·one child. If thefe rules
are duly attended t~ the reader will find no difficulty in obtaining fatif;..
faClory information upon this important enquiry, in his own or in any
genetbliacal figure that is laid before him.

According· to the rules l have recommended, I filall invefiigate the
quefiion in this nativity, reducing the particular quality of each figni- ·
ficator into a table, and deducing from thence the -etfeCl:s they refpec-

And therefore, as the indifferent figns operate neither way, ~ I conclude
from .the above majority of fix fruitful fignificators, that the native filall
have fix children. The next thing is, to determine their fex, or how
many fhall be males or females. To do this, it only requires .to
afcertain the quality of the figns and planets with which the Moon is
configurated, whether mafculine or feminine; and · from thence judg...
ment is drawn. For example. Tlte Moon in this . geniture is the firft

therefore impregnates that quality ; the Moon, a .feminine planet, be·
holds the Dragon's. Head from a feminine f.g~ ; .all which prove the fc.,
minine hature tball form the quality; and hence it is certain that the
three laft children of this native ihaiJ be all girls.-And fo it really
prov«!d.
Thit account may appear miraculour to tbofe unacquainted with
planetary in6'\lence; but their aelion is certain, and their energy invari-.
ably the faine_. Thus the Grand ProtcClor of tbe univerfe continually
produces, by perpetual revolutions of the . celeftial bodies, .the fame
caufes and effeels, giving life and motion to ·all animated nature, and
vegetative nourifiJment to the iuanitrlate ; and, as the inanimate are fome
times found imperfe8ly wrought. or mixed or blend,Fd with their op-.
pofite qualities, or of a doubtful genus; fo we 6nd tbe animate are fub.
jea to the fame mixtures and affetlions, according as the planets 1hall be
configurated uoder which they are formed. And hence we conftantly
find, that., in the generation of the buman fpecics, if the mafcu]inc inftu-
e&ce hath greatly the majority, the perfons produced under it will be pro-
portionably {hong, mufcular, raw-boned, and mafculine; but, when it
hath barely the fuperiority of the female inftuence, the native is elfemi-
sate, weak, flender, and dimiautive. So likewife females, where the fe-
male conformation hath greatly the afcendaflcy, are moft delicately and:
charmingly fDrmed, with aU the grace and foftnefs of the fcx, and with.
due. f)·mmetry and proportion; but, where it hath but b~rely the pre..
dominancy over the mafculiue, it fails not to produce large, coarfe,
·raw-boned, mafculine,. women.. And, as we have before fully e~pJained,
if the mafculine and feminine configurations are found equally lhong at
the time of birth, if the aCtioR of· tbe on~ quality thall in no wife ob-

AN ILLUSTRA .
TION
· By the fifth houfe we .are likewife enabled to judge of the probable
event of every fpecies of: adventure, whether by lottery, dealings in the
funds, purchafe or fale of life-annuities, or·of any tranfaflion where a·
certain or definable riik is -to be futlained : for tbefe {peculations, bow-
ever varied or multifarious, are governed by the fame motions of the
/~!4-~~ .mind, and fpring from the fame etfea in our radical geniture. In·the
·~;t:. ~..t prefent figure, we find. the~ north or fortunate node of tb~ Moon j)Ofited
"' m the fifth boufe, wh1ch 1s a !hong argument of fuccefs m fuch enter-
priCes; and this (uccetS is ftrengthened by the Moon's fex"tile afpea
therewith. But we dare not, in any cafe, decide by one fpecies of avi·
dence, without confulting what may be offered on the contrary fide.
We therefore find, that, oppofed to the foregoing propitious teftimonies,
there are feveral that produce a very oppofite eff'efl. Jupiter, who is
lord .of the fifth, and fignificator of the native's adventures, being pouted
in the eighth·houfe, deftroys much of the luck promifed by the forego-
ing afpect ; and, as Mars is in direfl oppofition to Venus, and the _part
of fortune afHiCled by Saturn; at the fame .time that the Moon's un-
fortunate node, or Dragon's Tail, falls in the eleventh·, the houfe wher.e
the final end of all things is deter_miued; we may fafely conclude, .that,
though the native might occafionally derive advantage by fucb. fpecula-
tious, yet be would eventually be injured by them. _
CONSIDERATIONS refulting from the SIXTH HOUSE.
'
From the fixth houfe .we deduce thofe infirmities or conftitutional dif·
orders of the body, with which the native, from the;., particular quality
of the ruling planets at birth, iliall from time to time be affiictedt as
the feveral direaions iliall happen to come up. This houfe likewife bas
-relation to the good and ·evil occurrences that refult from our immediate
fervants oi domeftics ; and likew_ife from our cattle.
But the mofi effeutial information the inquifitive reader can with to
acquire, is that which regards the health or ftcknefs of the native, and
. '" which, fince die days of Adam, is the promifcuous lot of all God's
children. lnfi_rmity both of body and mind was unqueftionably oc-
cafioned by the fall, which hurled, as it were, the whole fyftem of na-
ture into oppofite extremes, and gave that jarring inequality to the ele-
ments which Jays the foundation of every radical diforder. For, as
thefe elements are more or lefs predominant in concept ion, and as they
are diverfely changed and modified by the forms and properties of the
planetary influence at- the time of birth, fo will the incidental oc-
currences of hcal~h and fickne{s be, according to their fpecific quality
· aud temperature; and this is definable from the tetnperament and com-
, · . · plexio.n

. .
plexion of the native; for, as his temperament is, fo ·thall be his fickneti
or his health; for ticknefs is no other than an inequal~ty of fome pre.
dominant humour offending at the time of birth ; and, of whatever
clement fuch pred~minant ·humour is compounded, of 'fuch nature and
quality will be the difeafe. Hence then the propriety of every phyfl-
cian's confuhing .the ~adical caufe of difeafes from· the geniture of the
patient, wherever it can be obtained; for, by uniting uranical and phy-
fical precepts together, there canuot be a doubt but life may oftentimes
be preferved, where it is fatally ·defiroyed through i~.?.norance or m1£lake
in the radical caufe' of the complaint. Indeed the eminent progrefs.
and unbounded fuccefs, of the learned, and ingenious Dr. Salmon in
tbe fcience of phyfJC, he confeffes to have derived from all:rological
knowledge in decumbitures, by which means he feldom or ever loft a
patient, but where nature was totally e:xhaufied, and the fprings of life
fairly worn out. A very proper example this for modern pratlitionen
to follow; unce not only fortune and fame, but the general good of
mankind, would flow from it. .
Jn the hope that many of my readers wil~ be defirous of acquirin&
the moft extenfive information in this part of the· fcience, I filall here
ftate the various configurations from whence the. caufes of ficknefs and
health may be deduced; as well thofe which were feleCled by Dr. Sal. ·
mon in the courte of his praClice, as thofe which I have added by my
own expenence. The fubjeCl is interefting, and deferves attention.
If. in the figure of birth, the Jotd of the fixt.h houfe be in good af~a
with the lord of the afcendant, it is a ll:rong argument that the native
will be healthy. So when the Moon is well dignified, and in good
configuration with the lord of the fixth boufe, or beholds the cufp of
the 6xth with a fextile or trine, it is another proof of the native's health.
When benefic fiars are in the fixth houfe, in good configuration with
tbe luminaries, or with the lord of the afcendant, it farther denionll:rates
a healthy confiitution. If the lord of the fixth, the cufp of the fixth,
or the Moon. be unatftitled by bad afpetls of Satum or Mars, or by fixed
ftars of their nature, or by the Oragon's Tail; and neither the lord of
the fixth nor the Moon be combuft or peregrine; the native will moll pro-
bably live in perfect health all his days·.
But, on the contrary, if moll: or all .the fignificators in a gene.fis. be
found weak and unfortunate, or affliCted by the malignant planets in
body or aipetl; or if moft of the fignificators po6ted· in the twelfth,
eighth, or fixth, houfe57· or the infortunes ia the feveuth, are in no good

afpeet of Jupiter, Venus, or the Sun, or Moon; the native's body will
. be very infirm, and become a perfeCl repofitum of difeafes. And ac-
cording ~o the nature of the figns in which thofe planets are pofited,
i. e. according to the tFiplicity, {o will the native be continually aftliCled
with fuch infirmities as proceed from the predominant quality of that
trigon; for, if the fignificators be in watery figns, he will. be aftlicted.
with phlegm;· if in earthy, he will be oppreffed with melancholy; if
in·fiery~ with cholic, heat, and feverith affeCliorts.; but,. if in airy figns,.
he will labour under moft or all of thofe complaints which arife from
~oo great an abundan-ce of blood.
Whenever we find in a nativity the lord of the afcendant applying to
the lord of the tixth, it declares the native will be inattentive to his
. own health, and often futfer thereby. The Sun in the fixth, feventh,
eighth, or twelfth; houfes, is an argument of 1hort life, of many and
bitter aftlictions, and of much iicknefs; particularly if in bad afpe8
with the Moon ; but, if thefe luminaries be in conjunBion of each other,
it prefages defeCl of underftanding, and afftietions of the head and
.btairt, which the phyfician can rieitber difcover nor cure. If, the M9on
be a.ffiieted by the quartile or oppofition of Saturn, or the Dragon's Tail,
in the firft or fecond houfes of the figure, i~ declares the whole life will
be infirm : and, if fixed ftars of the quality of Saturn be joined with
either of luminaries, the native will be always lean and puny, and the
food he takes will afford but little nouriiliment ; fo likewife he that hath
Ma.f elevated.above Saturn in his birth will be of a weak and fickly ha-
. bit of ~dy.
Jf Mars be in the fixth houfe, it gives fudden cafual difeafes, which
return upon the . fi.ighteft occafion ; if in the twelfth, he affiias .the
body with extreme weaknefs, and forebodes cafuat·misfortunes. So, if
an infortune be matutine, it ~ows fudden difeafes ·or falls ; if vefper-
tine, a fickly habit or durable. complaints. But, fince bodily infi·rmi-
ties-c~nnot be deduced enti·rely from the bare pofition of any one planet
when others of an oppofite nature and quality are fo fituated as to coun-
terbalance its inftuence, fo the foregoing obfervations can only hold good
in fuch nativities where they fiand implicitly as above defcribed, with-
out any other planet in configuration, and totally unimpeded by the in-
fluence of other rays; for, when thefe occur, the complaint arifes .from
a compound caufe, and every feparate quality muft be confidered,. and
compared with the fundamental figniticators of the temperature and coD~­
fiitution of the native in his· radical figure of birth; which, being duly
afcertained, and proved :by direBion, will feldom. fail to point out the
precife nature and tendency-of the difcafe..

The four triplicities, from whence the four complexions or tempe-·
rat,ures arife, and the 6gns which compofe them, mufi be fully con-
templated in this enquiry. If the .native be found to exceed in his
temperature or complexion with the choleric humour, and . Saturn
happens to be the affiiCling planet, and pofited in Aries, being the houfe
of Mars, and the exaltation of the Sun,. he then declares the native ihall
at times b~ troubled with melancholy'vapours, and impofihumes in the •
head, with colds, watchings, fioppage in the fiomacb and boweJs, difiilla-
tions of rheum, and pains in the arms and 1houlders. If Jupiter be the
aflliCling planet in Aries, he denotes fome afBiClion. in .the head, or·
quinfey in the throat, Or tUmorous (welling, with fainting or fwoon- -
ing. If Mars in Aries be the affiieling fignificator, he gives extreme ·
pain iu the head, arifiog from a hot caufe ; or elfe want of fleep, or hot
rheums in the eyes, oc gripings in the bowels. If the Sw1 be the affiict-
ing planet, and pofited in Aries. he then gives the megrim, realeffi1efs,
fore eyes, with pain or fwellings in the t.highs and hips.. If Venus be the
affiiaing planet, and in Aries, 1he produces heavinefs and dulnefS in the
head, proceeding of cold; and difpofcs to lethargy, and to complaints
of the kidneys and reins.· If Mercury be the affii.tling planet in Aries.
,be caufes the vertigo, or lightnefs of the head, with all the various_
dif..;.
orders of the womb. If the Moon be the affiiCling planet in Aries, ihc
gives deftuxions of rheum from the head, falling fickne!S, convulfions,
. dimnefs of fight by cold, fieepinefs, with pains or ]amends in the knees.
Tbefc fcveral complaints are peculiar to the fituation of each of the
planets when in the 6gn Aries; for, in each different fign ·the_,. vary
t~eir effect upon the confiitution,. by particip~ting in the nature and.qua-
hty of each of the figos refpeCltvely. It Wtll therefore be neceffary to-
trace their influence through each of the four triplicities,. before their ac-
tion can be precifely determined in ever¥ geniture.
Saturn in Leo, being the affiiaing planet, gives violent affliCtion of
the nerves, confumption, or wafting of the liver, debility in the reins,
and weakuefs in the back. If Jupiter be the afflicting fignificator in
Leo, it difpofes to-feverith complaints, pleurifj, pains in the intell:ind,
Jripings and wind-cholic; and the fciatica, or hip-gout. When Mars.

But, as it does not always happen that the afcendant, or Part of Fortune,
is the giver of life, and a fingle planet ~t the fame time promittor, in
which cafes alone the foregoing rules can invariably be admitted, it will
be oeceffary to demon~rate the other influences, with which the regular
enjoyment of health is impeded by ficknefs and difeafe. It is the more
neceffary to be copious in this [peculation, Iince we cannot, without a
perfect knowledge of all the configurations that iuduce ficknefs, either
afcertain the affiiClions to which the native thall be fubjeCl during his
life, or difcover, with any degree of accuracy or fatisfaClion, the tcm-
PQrary and curable diforders, from that taft and final malady, which
bafBes the fyftem of phyfrcal aid, and difunites the immaterial foul from
the corruptible body. In all difeafes, the Moon is more particularly to be
regarded, fince her aClion upon the body is mofi fenfibly felt, and her con- ·
tiguous pofition brings her more frequently into contaa with malig-
nant rays. I thall therefore demonfrrate the various configurations,
under which the tends to deftroy the native's health or life, if affliCted
by tbe malefic rays of Saturn or Mars, in his figure of birth.
If the Moon in. Aries be affiitled by the conjuntlion, quartile, or
oppofition, of Saturn, the native will be remarkably fubjetl to coughs~
and colds, impofthumes in the head, weaknefs in the eyes,. difiillations
of .rheum in the breafr, fwellings in the throat, loathings iu .the fiomacb,
with irregular and profufe_ perfpiration. But, if the affiitlion be by the
conjunaioo, quartile, or oppofition, of Mars, it caufea difordcrs of
the brain, violent fevers, refileffi1efs, inflammation of the liver, aod
phrenzy. If in Leo the Moon be afBiCled by the evil rays of Satum,
it· produces a violent fever, putrefatlion of the blood, heat and drynefs in
the ftomach, with laffitude and debility. But if the difcafe comes by
the atBiCtion of Mars, fiagnation of the blood, lofs of appetite,
pbrenzy, and putrid or fpotted fever, will be the confequen~. If
the Moon be thus conligurated with Saturn in Sagit~rius, it produces
a ddluxiou of thin, 1ha·rp, and fubtle, humours ; gives pain in the Jimbl
atid joints, with heat and fwelli11g iu the extremities, refulting from.
tbe advcrfe effetls of heat and cold. But, if the affiiClion comes by Mars.
it wiU produce violent ficknefs at fiomach, intermitJe~t fever, paiu m
the reins aod loins, inward and outward piles, and the 6fiula. Tbri:
dileafes are produced by the malefic afpeCls of Saturn and Mars w~
the Moon io the fiery triplicity.
If the Moon be afBitled in Taurus, by the quartile, oppofition, or
conjunClion, of Saturn, it indicates flow fevers, proceeding from burnt

choler; and obfrruflions of the arteries, with inflammation of the whold
body, and exulceration of the lungs.- But, if the diforder proceeds from
the quartile, oppofition, or conjuntlion, of Mats, it will" arife from a·
fuperabundance of foul blood, inducing various obfiructions of the body,
inflammations of the neck and throat, pains in the head and limbs, with
watchfulnefs and convulfive fpa'fms. If in Virgo the M9or1 be thus
afBicted of Saturn, it occafions crudities and indigell:ions .of the fiomach,
tough phlegm, obfi:ructious of the bowels and· intefiines, head-ach,
pleurify, and beat of urine. Bur, if the affliction be by Mars, it de-
notes an exulceration of the intefiines, bloody flux, putrid fever, Joathitlg,
retching, and violent ficknefs of the fiomacb. If in Capricorn the Moon
be.afflicted by Saturn, it ihows fubtle, cold, and thin, diftillations, 'pains
and obfiructions in the neck and breafi, inflammations of the lungs, with
difficulty of breathing. But, if the Moon in Capricorn be afflicted by
Mars, it prefages illnefs arifing from bad digefiion, o,r from fome choleric
'or acrid humour in the fiomach. h may likewife produce a fever of the
nerves, ulcerations of th~ throat, and fluxes of the fiomach and belly.
Thefe are the afflictions peculiar to the Moon in the earthy triplicity,
when impeded by the malefic rays of Saturn and Mars.
In the airy triplicity, if the Moon in Gemini be afflicted by· the con-
. junction, quartile, or oppofition, of Saturn, it inclines the native to a
confumption, to diforders of the fpleen, wearinefs, watchings, with ·
flow fevers, pains all over the body, particularly in the joints and ar-
teries. ~ut, if the affiitlion be by the malefic configurations of Mars in
Gemini, it produces violent fevers, dangerous obfiructions of the blood
and juices, irregular pulfe, with ficknefs and loathing. If in Libra the
· Moon be affiiCled by .Saturn, it gives difeafes of the breafi: and fi:omacb,
pain in the he~d, want of appetite, loathing of food, noCturnal fevers,
hoarfeaefs, coughs, and difi:illations of foul humours. But, if the evil ir-
radiations are from Mars in Libra, it occafions a fuperabundance of blood,
inclines to putrid fevers, breakings-out or inflammations of the whole
body• . Ifthe Moon in Aquaries be affiiC1ed by Saturn, it occafions languor,
depreffion of fpirits, nervous affeClions, watchfulnefs, and an univerfal
reJaxation of the nervous fyfi:em. If the affiitlion come by the coil
afpeet of Mars in Aquaries, it portends difeafes which arife f~om hot and
fharp humours engendered in the fi:omach and bowels, and even-
tually produces agues, 'intermittent fevers, ulceration of the liver, and
iometimes mortification of the bowels. Thefe are efpecially under the

from violent colds, to which the J)ative will be.remarkably fubjeet; it
will likewife occafion difiil\ations from the breait and lungs, moift ca-
.tarrhs, afihma, hoarfenefs, and obftruCtions of the bowels. B.ut, if the
.atBiClions arife from the malignant configu·rations of Mars, it gives fan-
guine complaint{, hard tough phlegm in the throat, pains in the head,
retching, ficknefs of the ftomach, and putrid fever. Jf the Moon in
Scorpio be affiieted by Saturn, it foreihows ulcerations in the legs and
thighs, fifiuala, the piles in ano, with painful fuppreffion of urine by
fi:one or gravel. · But, if the affliCtion. be of Mars in :Scorpio, it ihows
violent pains in the head, with ulcerations or imp6fiumes; as it likewife
gives the hemprrhoids, meafles, fmall-pox, fpotted fever, thruth, chicken-
pox, boils, and all bodily irruptions. If the Moori in Pifces be af-
flicted by Saturn, it produces difiillations of cold rheum, flow fevers,
pains in the back and loins, mortification of the bowels, and fpeedy death. .
But, if the evil come by the afH.iCtion of Mars in Pifces, .it thows au

Thus I have nated, in·as briefa manner as poffible, the various difeafea
produced by the Moon in .each of the twelve figns, when impregnated
with the malefic afpeCts of Saturn or Mars; and here let it be underftood
that nearly the fame effeCts are produced by the ·quartile, oppo6tion.

the lungs, diabetes, and fione in the bladder.
The Sun, direCled to his own quartile in any nativity, gives fainting-
fits, tremors, and palpitation of the heart; whatfoevC?r be his ftgnification
in the radix, he will, phyfically confidered, be the author of flow fevers,
and always incline the native to difeafe. But, if he be afflicted by the
quartile or oppofition of Venus in fiery figns, it will produce pains in the
back, bowels, and reins, fluxes of the belly, tendmg to a confirmed
djfentery. If in earthy figns, phlegmatic tumours, and cold deftuxions
of the. breaft and lungs. In airy figns, putrefaCtion of blood, running
of the reins, pains in the ,fcrotum, and incurable frigidity. In watery
figns, obftruetions of the fiomach, fmall-pox, meafles, dropfy, rheumatifm,
and gout.
If the Sun be afftitled by Mercury in fiery figns, he gives the phren~y,
iliac paffion, and impofibumes in the head. In earthy figns, melan-
choly, king's evil,' fciatica, leprofy, and gout. In airy figns, pains of the
head -and ftomach, bilious cholic, ftrangury, and gravel in the reins.

. To judge accurately of the natural force of a difeafe, great regard
muft be had to .the figns wherein the fignificators of the difeafe are
pofited,. both as to their nature and quality ; for earthy figns denote
colder difeafes than airy, .and fiery figns hotter. and drier difeafes than
watery. And hence diforders might with cafe be fought out by duly
confidering the nature of the figns, the dignity of the con6gurating
planets,.and the quality ofthe.houfes, in which they are pofued. In this
fpcculation it mufi be always remembered, that the houfes of heaven
which denote difeafes, are the fixth; twelfth, eighth,. and feventh; and
particular regard muft be had to the lords of thofe houfes, as well as to.
the planets pofited therein,. in acute difeafes; and to the Sun and lord ·
of the afcendant in chronic. But the fixth houfe, and its lord, with
the planets pofited therein, heft defcribe the difeafe, partic.ularly when .
they affiict either of the luminaries or the lord of the afcendant. The
configurations· of the Moon are in a particular manner to be noticed ; ·
for, in the c-onfiitution of difeafes, the tranfiates the nature of one pia-·
net to that.of another, the which, if well examined, with the ftate and
quality. of that planet whofe virtue 1he tranflates, cannot. fail to dif-
cover to us the true caufe of the ficknefs or difeafe with which the na•
tive is afHiCl:ed. For according to the fign the Moon is in, . to the na•·

~e .governs by th~ houfe ~e i~ in, whether he be direct or. retragrad,
iw1ft or flow., -onental .or occ1dental, combuft or free, prec1fely fo fuall
the frrength and duration of the malady be. And in this enquiry it will
become us to diftinguifu whether the affliction be effential or accidental.
The.parts of the body ejfontially afflitled, are goverued by the fign ·upon ·
the aicendant, the cutp of the fixth houfe, and the Moon ; thofe ·
accidentally affiitled, are governed by the lord of the afcendant, the
lord of the fixth, and the Moon; and by the figns in whieh they are
pofited, both according to fimple and compound tignification. The dif-
ference between the effential and. accidental affliCtion, is this : the one
demonftrates where the root of the difeafe ledges, and where .the chief
and real affiitlion is feated; whilft the other fuows the fympathetic
affliCtion of the component parts, which, though in faa really well, yet
fuffer ·an acute and fenfible pain, by reafon of the extremity of the
diftemper, which effentially or radically afll.iets fome other part. For
. example, when oue burns his hand, that is the member or part
effentialJy vitiated ; but, by reafori of the extremity of the pain, the
whole arm becomes inflamed. Thu$ the difeafe accidentally affeCts the
whole arm; but it is effentially feated only in the burned hand. The
fame reafoning holds good in all cafes generally; but particularly we fay,
that Saturn in the beginning of Cancer produces pain in the left fide, as
though pierced with an awl; in Leo he afBiets the heart and back; ii1_
Virgo, the head and bow~ls ; in Scorpio, the hips and reins, and caufeth
difficulty in making water. So Mars, lord of the fixth, with Aries or
Scorpio on the afcendant, affliCts the head; though this pofition frequently
gives pain in all parts of the human body, and produces an univerfal
breaking-out, in boils, blotches, ulcers, itch; fmall pox, meafies, or the
like. · But, if Mars.in this cafe be pofited in Leo, he produces paius iri
the back; in Virgo, inflammations of the lungs; in Libra, pains in
the back and reins ; but, if he be lord of the fixth in ·Scorpio, he gives
diforders of the womb .and bladder.
If the. lord of the fixth houfe be aftlicted in a diurnal figu, the difeafe
will appear in the fore part of the body, as in the face, breaft,:.or belly;
but, if he be aftlicted in a noCturnal fign, the feat of the difeafe will be
either in the back or internal parts of the body; and this will hold good, .
whether the fignifieator be above or under the earth. If the lord of the
fixth boule be aftlicted above the earth, and in a diurnal fign, the fick-
nefs falls in the right fide ; but if he be under the earth, and in a noClur-

tues inftilled refpeClive~y by the planets, abfirrctedly confidered, muft

anger, and goverris the attraClive quality .in man; having his power
much increaied when in Aries, Leo, or Sagittarius. The Sun engenders
ydlow choler, hot and -dry; be governs the vita] faculty, and is the be-
ginning of life ~nd motion._ His action is upon the heart ; and with
Mars he rules the attractive: quality, having his power greatly augmented
in Aries, Leo, anq Sagittarius. Venus produces thin phlegm, cold and
moift, governs and ,excites the libidinous appetite, and with Mars and
the Sun prefides over the attractive quality, having her greatefi ·energy in
Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius. Mercury engenders thin melancholy, hot
and dry, hath the virtue imaginative and cogitative, and difpofes ·the
animal virtue refting in · the brain. The Moon produces grofs, raw,
crude, phlegm, prefides over the natural virtue refting in the Jiver, and
governs the expullive facufty,. having her greateft power and in6ueuce in
Cancer, Scorpio, or Pifces.
From thefe obfervations we a;·e led to deduce, that, when the pla-
nets in their effential dignities are pofited at the fame time in ·any of the
above figns, the operation of the planet fo effentially dignified will fo
far exceed the influence of all the other ftars, as to render its tempera-
ment and quality too powerful in the conftitution of the native, and to
produce fuch diforders as are the natural confequeuce. For example, if
Jupiter be thus dignified in Gemini, the digefl:ive faculty will be ftrong;
or, if Saturn be in Cancer, the native will have the flux, and there-
fore folid food and afiringent liquors would be naturally recommended.
The fame do8rine holds in every other complaint, which muft be pro-
duced by the fuper-abundance of fome one of the four qualities; and,
when the· effential caufe of complaint is once found, ·a remedy may be

To paint aut the ufe of the above Table, let us fuppofe a native to fall
f1ek wbcn his fignmcator is in Aries, and fuppofe his fignific:ator to. ·
be
Jupiter; look ia the top column for Jupiter, and in the firft column on
the )eft hand for Aries, and in the common angle of meeting you will
find Leo and Taurus, which 1how he is affiiCled at the heart, and hatb
fome evil fenfation in his throat, &c. for every planet in his own houfe
rules the head; in the .fecond fign from his own bouk, the neck and
throat; in tbe third, the arms and thoulders; and fo on, as ftated in every
common alma.nac.
Having thus gone through the moft material obfervatious necdfary to
form a right underftanding of fickne& in any nativity, I thall now· pro-
ceed l'0 e:xam.f.no the fixth boufe, or boufe of. ficknefs in this geniture.
The fixth houfe, we nAd, is governed by the Sun, Mars., and Mercury.
Mars, in this figure, is lord of the afceodant, as well a~ lord of the flXtb
houfe, and therefore induces. in the native a perfea indifference as to the
care '>f his own health. Mars being pofited in an earth}! figu, incliftca
him to choler; while the Sun in the ti:xth, and Mercury. in fextile: of Sa-
turn; in a fixed flgn, produce chronic difeafes, eventually inclining to
palfy ; together with deprdfion of fpirits, and habitual melancholy. This
is farther declared by the oppofition of Saturn to the Part of Fortune,
who

who in this figure is hileg. or giver of life. If tberefQrc we ~amine, by
the foregoing rules, what part of ~ native's body fuall be JDQft fcmfibly
aftUB:ed .by this accidental pofition of the planets, we th~lllind them re-
markably fubjeCl to pains in tb~ bead from melaucboly, firuma$ in the
·throat, aching paioa in the joints, d,efeCl:s in the ears, with tremors and
palpitations of the heart. The figoificators being wholly in the. fiery,
earthy, and airy, triplicities,·denote likewife that the native {ball be very
fubjetl to fevers; but, to difcover when tbefe feveral maladies thall befal
him, we mufr dirtil the feveral figni6cators to their promittors, which we
lhall prefently demonftrate in tbe direCtions, and thereby prove how ex-
aCtly the fcveral diforders with which Mr. \Vitchell was, dttriog life,
aftliaed, cilrrefponded with the fignificators in hi~ nativity. •
The fi.xth houfc alfo bears relation to fervants, and points out how we
may be a~eCl:ed by them. Their fignificators ~re the planets pofited in
the fixth, with the lord thereof, and the Mool). In this figure we find
the Sun ai1d Mercury are in the fttth houfe i aud, as the Sun is lord of
the tenth, the .houfe of bao.our and preferment, and in the fign of his
exaltation, itdenotes that the native thould have very profitable fervants;
and, finding Mercury in reception of Mars, it indicates that tbofe placed
hi a fubordinate capacity under him 1hould be diligent, aClive, and vigi-
lant in his fervice. ln ihort, I find no injury likely to arife to him by
means of domeftics, except it be from females, and that no way material,
1ince it arifes only from the quartile of the Moon to the fixth houfe, in a
fe~i.nine figo. The circumffimces of the native's life fully confirmed this
opuuoo.
CPNSIDERATIONS arifing from the SEVENTH HOUSE.
From this boufe we derive all:ral information, concerning the native's
iotercourfe with women: whether he thall marry, or lead a life of celi-
bacy; whether he '1hall indulge in the delectable enjoyments of the fofter
{ex, or whether the cold and frigid conformation of his nature thall give
him an averfiou to women.
To determine the marriages of men, we muft confult their principal
fignificators, which are, Venus and the Moon, the feventh boufe, the lord
thereof, and the planets pofited therein. But, to determine the marriages
of women, we mull: particularly regard the Sun and Mars, the fe\Jettth
houfe, and the planet or planets pofited therein. To afcertain whether the
native will marry or·not, requiresa minute infpe8ion ofthe nativity; for, if
Saturn be more elevated than Veous or the Moon, than Marsor the Sun, or
ftronger in dignity than all of them, the native will have a natural averfion
to a married ftate, particularly if oo· benefic planet coJJeas his rays, and

AN ILLUSTRATION
conduces thereby to a more communicative and attive fpirit ; for Sa-
turn, being the author o( habitual folitarinefs, and, w~en fo pofited,
the producer of cold, crude, and frigid, humours, takes away that inftiuc-
tive affettion of the mind, and that ~enerous warmth of the paffions,
which nature ordained to ftir up and ft1mulate the fenfitive faculty to the
produtlion of its like. When Saturn or Mars are found in afpea with
Venus or the Moon, and in no good configuration either with the Sun,
Jupiter, or Mercury, and are at the fame time weak or peregrine, it
argues that the native thall lead a gay and lafcivious life, indulging too
freely in the ufe of women, before he will engage in ·matrimony. If
t}Jefe figuificators are in barren figns, or in cadent houfes, an~ dignified
in Leo or Taurus, or the Moon in Scorpio, in quartile or oppofition. of
Saturn; or if the Moon be in conjuntlion of the Sun in Capricorn, Aqua-
ries, or Libra, and in oppofition to Saturn ; the perfou born under fuch
configurations will never marry. And again, -the oppofition or quartile
of Venus and Saturn with the Moon, in a barren fign, or in a cadent
houfe, argues much againft a married life. But where we find the Moon.
and Venus in male nativities, or the Sun and Mars in thofe of women, or
pofited in fruitful figns, and the lord of the feventh houfe fortunate, or a
benevolent planet in that houfe, or the fignificators of marriage fituated
in good parts of the figure, or a reception between the lord ofthe feventh
and firft houfes, or a good afpeCt between any of the principal fignifica-
tors, we may then fafely declare the native will not only marry, but· is.
well qualified to render that fiate truly blifsful and happy~ . - ·:
But to know whether matrimony will be contratled with eafe, i.e.
without much trouble, anxiety, or difappointment, obferve whether
Saturn and Mars behold each other by an oppofition out of the fit.ft or
feventh houfes, or whether Venus be pofited in Leo or Scorpio, in evil
afpeCt with Mars, or whether Mars tranfits the cufp of the feventh houfe
in Capricorn, Virgo, or Taurus; for, in any. of thefe cafes, the native
will find great difficulty and embarraffment in purfitin~ the objetl of his
affeCtion, and, whenever matrimony takes place, it w1l1 be on a fudden.
If, on the contrary, we find the figoificators of marriage well behela by
benefic ftars, ftrong and in good afpea to Saturn and Mars,·a.nd the lord
of the feventh applying to the lord of the afceudaut, matrimony will be
obtained with eafe. The number of wives or hutbands the native lliall '
have, is declared by the application of the Moon in men's nativities,
and by the application of the Sun in thofe of women, either in bo.dy or
afpetl; for, if the Moon or Sun be joined with or apply to but one
planet, it denotes but one wife or hutband ; except thofe fignificators.

of marriage, as the cafe and configurations .in the ·genethliacal 6pre
fhall happen to be. The diretlions that gave marriage to this native,
were the Moon to the fextile of the afce1idant, and trine of the feventh
houfe, followed by Mars to the midheaven, the Sun to the feveutb, and
the Moon to the fextile of the Sun, all which were reafonably fufticient
to ftir up the native's mind to the completion of the marriage-contracft,
and which accordingly took place, in ·that exalt order and point of time
defcribed by the aforefaid direCtions, as will be hereafter more fully proved
. and explained.
As to the number of wives, if we examine the Moon by the rules al-
ready given, we 1hall find the native will have but one. The Moon, in
this nativity, applies but to on~ planet while the is in the fign Capricorn;
and that planet is Mercury, who is in reception of Mars, lord of the
feventh houfe ; and therefore muft have pre-eminence in the defcription
of the wife, who was a perfon of a tallith ftature, fair complexion, light-
brown hair, 1harp, witty, and ingenious, and of a fanguine choleric dif-
pofition, precifely as the fignificators imply.
The rcafon Jupiter is not admitted in teftimony of a fecond wire, is
~eaufe, accordin~ !o his latitude, he is out of Taurus, and .is verging
mto the fign Gem101; and .therefore the Moon cannot be fatd to apply
to him while ihe is pofited in the fign Capricorn ; a diftinB:ion that
every artift muft carefully make, or his labours will be often vain,
and his judgment founded in error. Modern praCtitioners have in
general paid little or no attention to the latitude of the ftars, a tbing
of the utmofi: importance; and hence the .fuppofed uncertainty anct·.
difgrace that has been brought upon this department of the fcience of
Aftronomy. As to the agreement of the native and his wife, I filall only
take notice, that Mars in oppofltion of Venus muft create occafional aoi-
mofity; but on what account, I ihall leave the attentive reader to dif._
cover by the rules and aphorifms. I have already laid. down for the illuf--
tration of this. fubjett.
We will. now examillc, according to. the pefition- of tbcfe afpeeb;
whether the native or his wife thall live the longeft. We 6Dd firft,.
chat the· Moon. is much better fortified than Mercury, the planet to.
which 1Jte applies ;. and- which is. therefore the fignificator of the wife.
Secondly, Venus is, aftli~ed .by an oppofitiou of Man. .Thirdly,. Saturn,.
a malefic plane~ is in the fourth. houfe ; which .threefold cord- tics tbe
wife of the. ~tiYe .do.wn, according to natural caufca, to cer&ain-

CONSIDERATIONS refulting from the EIGHTH HOUSE.
The eighth boufe bas fignificatio~ of death, and of preferments and'
advantages by death, as bath been fully explained in page 155. But let
it be remembeFed, that this houfe is not to.be direCled from.death unlefs
it contains the aaareta, or killing ftar, any more than the fixth or ·
twelfth houfes ; for death arifes fr.om other caufes than merely the pofi-
tion or tranfiting of the cufps of houfes, as we have abundantly 1hown·.
in page 455. But this houfe~ being under the dominion of the malefic
pa.nets, participates moftly of the quality of death, and bath therefore
been.atligncd to this particulal' eaquiry; which, indeed,. is of the laft
importance. · ·
The firfl: thing taught in, our fuheols, and tht: primary faa impretfed
upon our minds the moment we attain the maturity of rcafon, is the
inevitable deftiny 0[ our nature, that .we muft once die ; a theme
tbat fc.w men love to baa.,,. or to- dwell upon, although it is the exprcfs
term of their exiO:ence. How abfurd it is then, that we Q.ould incef-

tegether with their effential and accidental produetiou of difeafes, 6nce
we find uo violent means tball attain the .fuperior effea in tbis nativity.
V euus and Mercury arc -co-6gnificators of the eighth houfe ; and the di:£.
eafe Venus in her natur~ gi~s, is thick, :cold, tough, phlegm,.and watery;
oaufing indigeftion, with quotidian phlegmatic fevers. The difeafcs ·in-
cident to the influence of Mercury in A:rier, are yellow choler, and fub:.
tite melancholy, ·with depreffion of fpirits, perturbation of mind, and
defeS or 1ofs of fpeech. Now as Mars is.lord of the afcendant, in oppo.
Btion to Venus, and in reception with Mercury, it appears highly pro-
baWe that thefe difeafes w

Thefe confiderations being annexed to thofe rules laid down in page
451, will enable us to draw all neceffary coudufions concerning toe
material tor effeCiive journeys of the native. .In this nativity .we find
Mercury a very principal fignificatot of travelling, pofited in Aries,
and in. -reception of Mars, in the tenth boufe. This declares ,the ·.na-
tive 1hould be impelled wefiward, .firongly urged by fcieutific acquire-
ments, ·which is the true and radical implication of this planet's nature
and ihfluence. And as Mercury is elevated in the fixth hou{e, in con-
:)un8ion of the .Sun in his exalta~ion. it is an · irrefifribl~ argume~
that. the native fitould be raifed by the eveuts of this journey to an
advantageous poft, under the aufpices of princely authorjty, ~s the exaked
~peel of the Sun clearly demonfirates. And again, Mercury being-lord
of the eleventh houfe, and having his.exaltation in Virgo, decJ~res that
this journey fitould be taken through the medium of friend~, who were
kientific men ;. and, as Venus is lady of the afcendant, fituated i,1. the

thereby further declared, that this journey thall be made im .that,angl~
which is·weft from London, the place of the native's birtb; and that it
lhall be terminated:by fame great body of water, in the vicinity of which
the native fuall find a durable rdidence. This was, in every inftance,
moll remarkably verified .in the native's appointment to a fcientific office
in his Majefty's Dock-Yard at Portfmouth, upon the recommendation of
fame of the Fellows of the Royal Society; in confequeuce of which, this
important journey was taken, and all the fubordinate events were really
brought to pafs. * .,.,
We have ti~t to co·nftder the exemplary :or religious betit of.the :na-
tive's mind ; which is ufually afcertained.by the following configurations:
Jupiter, Venus, or the Dragot1's Head, piaoed in the ninth or third
houfes, ·or configurated with Spica Virginis, are certain prefages of. a
moral and religious perfon. The·Moon, Mercury, and Part of Fortnno,
in fimilar pofitions, denote the fa!Jle ; but the Sun effentially dignified in
the ninth houfe, thows a very ftrong natural propenfity to moral arid 're-
ligious praCtices ; and, if the native happens to be .bred..a clergy~an, he
becomes a moft admirable preacher, and ·hath every ·protpe£l of confider.
able preferment ih the church.· ·
. :! . I· ·;
· Whenever it happens that no planets are found ·in the ·ninth houfe of
the figure, we mufi: have particular regard to the allral pofition, of Jupi-
ter; for if he be in his own houfe, or in reception with Venus or
Mercury9 or with the ·Sun or Moon, or in conjuneti<m, f~xti1e, ;or trine,
witb Venus, in angular places, they declare the tHttive .to be in principJ~
a ftriBly moral and confcientious man, poffefied Q( more fterling .inJe-
grity·than thofe .who make large profeffions. But Saturn,. Mar~, or the
,.Dragon's Tail, pofited. in the ninth hpufe, and in moveable figns, with
Jiipiter peregrine, cadent, or in bad ·afpeCt with Saturn or Mars, pre-
ilge:great mutability in religious perfuafiop, which gene~ally terminates
~atbcifm. Saturn pofited in a common .fign, ill cJigni~ed, a•1d retro·
grade, ·befpeaks an hypocrite; and , Mar~, tQU$ config'Qratep, forethows a
mind pliable to any perfuafion that will beft ferve the purpofes of avarice

there being a moft remarkable reception between Mercury and Jupit-er in
their triplicity, Mercury being in the triplicity of J"Piter, and Jupiter by
his latitude in that of Mercury, will incHne the native not only t~ be a

Let it not be fuppofed, fmm the foregoing obfervations, that 1 would

clearly point out o\M' natufal inclinations, ·wheth¢r good or evil ; and it
will ~nerally be found that thofc inclinations carry fo .tlrong a oie
over our reafon and moral in~llc8, that, in nistety-nine inilances out of
a wndred, the natural- influence or inclillatioo impreffed by . each
mau~s fignificators will be fowad to prtvail. And yet this it oo de-.

begin to ihow its .effeas; but, if it hath an evil tendency, it will begin
to operate .when the Moon comes to the conjunction, quartile, or oppo-
fitiop, of the lord.of the hour. And here let it be remembered, that a
dream hath not always the full completion on the firft configuration of
the Moon with the lord of the hour; but oftentimes remains unfiniihcd
until the Moon comes .in contaCt with another afpea of the fame nature
and fignification..
In this na~ivity the Moon and Venus are the principal figuificators of
dreams; the one being lady of the ninth houfe, and the other beholding .)'k.; ~ ._/_?::~_
that houfe with a trine afpeet ; and they are fl:rong arguments that the ./$~ ~-7-.
native 1hould. frequently have important communications through the ~(]4..
medium of dreams.
CONSIDERATIONS refulting fro~ the TENTH HOUSE.
The tenth houfe hath fignification of honour, preferment, trade, pro-
fdlion, or of any regular and accuftomed means by which men live, and
are refpeCl:ed. In treating of which, it will be nece1fary to obferve the
following rules, in addition to thofe laid down in page 438.
If the Sun or Moon, in the figure of birth, 1hall happen to be pofited
in the very degree of the e:xaltation, and at the fame time free from the
evil afpects of the infortunes, it is a powerful indication of the moft flat:
tering acquifitions to the native, in proportion to his capacity and degree
of birth. When the light of time tranfits the cufp of the mid-heaven,
and is furrounded by benefic planets in the hour of birth, and no malefic
rays of the infortunes intervene, the native 1ha11 arrive to fome important
poft of power and authority under government; or to a public employ-
ment of dignity and honour, under fame chartered body, or princely
power, in proportion to the condition of his birth. If the Sun or Mooit
arc pofited in angles, though unaided by other configurations, yet the
native 1balllive in much refpeet and efteem all his days. In thofe figures
of birth where neith~r of the luminaries are found pofited in angles, nor
in any of their e1fential dignities, nor in mafculine figns, nor configurated
with the propitious rays of Jupiter or Venus, be affured the condition of
the native will be poor and abjeCt all his days, no matter what might be
his hereditary profpeCl:s at his hour of birth. But if the planets that
have dominion in the places of the Sun and Moon, or in the degrees
afcending, thall be orientally fixed and wel.l dignified, the native thall
raife himfelf to a high condition~ efpecially if, by a concatenation of
fortuitous eve11ts, thofe planets are afpected by either of the benefi<;s.

Jupiter pouted in the tenth houfe, in a diurnal nativity, gives a..pretty
-accurate teftimony that the native thall be employed in fome advantage.
ous public poft ; but, if either Sat\lrn or Mars be in quartile or oppofi.
tion with that pofition of Jupiter, the native will certainly be driVCD
from his preferment, with lofs of reputation. But he who· bath the
good fortune to be born juft at noon, when the Su11 entets the me.•
ridian at his place of birth, effentially dignified, and oppoU:d by no
vicious ray, will, in fpite of all the gloomy profpeCls that may attend
his infancy, certainly arrive to great fortune and preferment, and increafe
in honour and reputation all his days. If the lord of the tenth apply to
the lord of the afcendant in oriental ftations, and in their exaltation,
fuch a native filall be profperous, and well beloved. And again, he that
hath the Moon pofited in Taurus, upon the cufp of the afcendant, the
Sun being at the fame time in Leo, will arrive to great honour. The
.. Moon in the. firft houfe, oppofed to the Sun in the feventh, and in quar-
tile of Jupiter in the fourth, gives wealth and authority, by the perqui-
_
fites of magiftracy, embaffics, &c. but if the Moon be in the afcendant,
and the Sun in partite conjunCtion with Vcnus, wealth and honour will
come by ecclefiaftical p~eferments. ,,·
The fixed ftars, likewife, in this fpeculation, have, by accidental confi-
guration, a moft important influence. If tbe Moon be with Cor Leonis,
and Jupiter elevated in the tenth houfe, in trine of Mars, and in dfen-
tial dignity, the Sun being at the fame time in conjunction with th~
Dragon's Head, will produce thofe rapid and unexpcCl:ed turns of good
fortune and preferment, that equally furprife the native and aftonilh man-
kind. To confirm the certainty of this obkrvation, I could enly with the
genitures of Lord Nelfon, the Duke of Wellington, Monf. Talleyrand,
Monf. Carnot, and a hundred others in fimilar circpmftances, to be in-
fpeeted; and I will forfeit my head if the radical caufe is not founti eq~ly
the fame in them all. . ., . ,
According to this hypotbefis, thofe perfons filall likcwife prove for-
tunate and illufirious, in whofe nativities the Moon is in good afpea
with many planets, united with a princely fiar; aud be that bath in
other refpeCts but an unpromifing geniture as to riches and honour, yet
if he bath the Moon 'contigurated with any eminent fixed ftar of the tirft
magnitude, he filall, at fome part or other of his life:, be uoexpeCledly
promoted to fome poft of authority and advantage, though be may ·per•
haps be dithonourably fuperfeded, and caft do.wu to his former obkufity.

again upon the going off of its effeCt, and be reinftated in his former occu-
pation or employment.
Upon egquiry, I found this native was mechanically brought up
to the profeffion of a watchmaker and go1dfmith ; bu~ if we atten-
tively confider the import of the proper figuificators of his prefer-
ment and profeffion, we 1hall find that nature had fitted him for a
more refined and elevated line of life. .The cardinal and :equinoc9:ial
fign Libra is upon the cufp of his afcendant ; the Sun potited· in the car-
dinal fign Aries ; the Moon in the tropical fign ·Capricorn ; Mercury
and Mars, the two principal fignificators of his profeffion, in reception
of each other; Mars alfo in the exaltation of Mercury, and pofited in the
tenth boufe, the houfe of ·honour and preferment ; the Part of Fortune
alfo in the tenth, con6gurated with the two royal fixed ftars, Hydra. and
Co~ Leonis, are fo many unequ~vocal arguments, n?t only. tha~ s.d~
natave 1hould abandon every handicraft employment, 10 purfuJt•. of'tli'e
more elevated and fublime ftudy of the libera.l arts and fciences, but ~h~t ~
he 1hould eventually obtain honour, promotion, and emolument, by the'''\.ll,
purfuit. Mars, befides being the- principal fignificator of his profe(Jo\
non, is alfo lord of the afcendant, and therefore proves.that the avoca-
tion of the native 1houJd be fuch as be would make choice .of himfelf,
and that it would be in the line of fcience, as is moft aptly. declared by
the pofition of Mars in ·the dignities of Mercury ; whilft the ·Sun being·
in the houfe of his e%altation, and lord of the tenth, declares. honour.
and preferment ihould refult from it, with d.
urat1oas of fuccefs; and the
more fo, becaufe the Sun fends a triue afpect to ·the. teuth·houfe, as well
as Mercury, which proves his profperity and advancemcn~· to arife from
his own intrinfic merit. . ·: . ·
All this was in a mofi remarkable manner verified by the wonderful
fucceffes and puduits of the native, in oppofition to every .obftacle, dif-
.ficulty, and oppreffion, thrown in his way, by attempts to force upon him
an employment incompatible with his genius. His many curious and
valuable pieces, written at an early age, and publithed among other
mathematical difquifitions; his memorable improvements and difcove-
ries in the longitude, for which his fovereign promoted him to the
honourable poft of Aftronomical Mafter of his Royal Academy in Portf-
mouth, which he filled with univerfal reputation; 1how us, .that ill thefc ·
cafes the influences of the ftars are not t~, .lfe refifrec:J, nor the bright
rays of genius chained to arbitrary limit(. In my opinion, thefe arc
genitures .that afford a brilliant fcope to .aftrological enquiry; becaufe
we are not. only enabled to define this extraordinary impulfe of the
mind,

OF ASTROL . OGY~ 151
·mind, which .impelled thiS" native forward in purfuit of fame; but we
arc likewife enabled to trace this infiinetive faculty frill farther thao tho
conftitution of his own figure of birth, and to difcover fomething of
it in that of his parents, which I thall here explain. Tbe fourth boufe
reprefents the father ; and Saturn . being configurated in that ho9fe, in
e1fential dignities, in an airy and fcientific fign, proves the father to have
inherited a fcientific turn. But the tenth ho.ufe bears fignificatiou of the
native's mother, whofe fpirit of generofity·and elevation of foul arc moft
remarkably expreffed by the two royal fixed fiars con6gurated iu her aC..
ceudant or conjunCtion with the part of fortune, the giver of life 'to tbc
native; and we may obferve, that, as Mars is lord of the native's aken...
dant, and falls in his mother's afcendant, he ihould, according to natural ·
efficient caufes, inherit the 'vital principles and difpofitions of his mother.
Hence too we define the caufe why children fometimes more ftrongly
refemble the father, and fometimes the mother; an effeCt which folely
depends upon which of their tignificators is the ftrongefl: and beft dig..
nified in the aa: of generation.
Upon the whole, we. may remark, that few events can ,more illufir.i...
outly difplay the obvioufnefs of planetary information, or more vifibly de...
monftrate. the gooduefs of God in mercifully affording his creatures this .
aftonithtng mode of communication, than the fqregoing radical proofs of
this native's natural force of genius; who, at twelve years of age, was of
fufficient capacity to feud a moft elaborate piece for infertion in the Gen.. '
tleman's Diary; and at the early age of twenty-one, was admitted a
member of the mathematical fociety in London! A proof this, that af.
tral influence thould be the firft confideration to direa us .in forming the
tenda minds of youth to fuch purfuits and avocations as are heft calcu...
lated to place them in the high road to excellence and perfeCtion. And
for which purpofe I cannot recommend a more firiking example than
what iJ ·afforded in this effential part of the nativity of my good and
worthy friend Mr. Witchell. ·
CONSIDERATIONS refulting from the ELEVENTH HOUSE.
The eleventh houfe is that part of the vifible heavens from which
we draw judgment• concerning friends and friendthip; hope, confi-
dence, and trufi. 1 fhall therefore, in addition to what I have com-
municated in page 449, offer the following remarks. When Jupiter
or V euus fhall be found i11 the eleventh, fifth, tenth, feventh, firft, or
ninth, houfes of the figure, it is afure prefage of many friends; but,
if Saturu or Mars are peregrine in angles, or pofited in the twelfth houfe,
it denotes many enemies. Whoever is born with Cancer afcending

on the eaftern fineter of the heavens, fuch native will enjoy a ve1y fmaU ·
thare of friends ; an~ nearlY the fame will be the lot of t~ofe: in whofe
nativities the lord of the -eleventh houfe and the lord of the afcendant arc
found fcparating from a propitious configuration.
If it be in any cafe required to know whether mutuiH good offic~s of
friendiliip tball. long exiff between any two particular p~rfons, or be-
tween lovers or fweethearts before marriage, · ~r between hutband and
wife after, the only certain mode of obtaining· this information is by
comparing the two nativities of either of the two perfons together, and,
according to their import, judge. For, if the afcendant in the figures
of both parties have the fame fign afcending, or the fame planets in the.
firfr houfe, or beholding each other by the fame afpelt, mutual friend..;
fitip, love, and confidence, will long exift; for, ;as affinity of mann~rs
and likenefs are the effence of affetlion, fo affeClion, in this fpeculation,
mull be the author of agree~ellt, of fincerity, and of friendlhip. To de..
monftrate this, let us confider the influence and condition of the lord of
the afcendant, u~der its four different configurations: viz. firft, when
in both nativities he is bonafide the fame planet ; fecondly, when he is
received of the other nativity by houfe or exaltation; thirdlJ, when.he
is in conjuntlion with the lord of the afcendant of the other nativity;.
and, fourthly, when he is in fextile or trine of the lord of the other na-
tivity. For, in all cafes where there~ not a·concurrence ofoneor other
of thefe tefrimonies, the fricndihip or attachment of thofe two particular
perfons will not be found of long continuance.
When, in the nativities of any two given perfons, the one hath Venua
in the p~fition where the other hath the Moon, or the Sun, the para
of fortune, or the lord of the afcendant, · it is a .fubft~ntial proof that
there will be firm and lafting friendthip between them; but, whenever it
is found,. in any two nativities, that the fign upoo the a{cendant of the
one occupies the cufp of the twelfth, eighth, or ·fixth, boufes of the
other, there caunot po6ibly be any durable attachment or friendihip be-
tween the parties. It bath bee.n determined, by repeated obfervation,.
that tbofe perfons regard' each other with the purefr friendfhip where
the lord of the afcendant in one nativity a.pplies to the lord of the af-
cendan.t in the other, or where the benevolent plagcts are found in rc.e.
~CP.tion of ~ach other. By the fame parity of reafoning, they hate moll
mveterately where th~ fa~e number of malignant planets occupy the
afcendant of each other's nativity; or where, the lord of the. afcendant ir1
one nativity, being of a contrary or adverfe nature with the lord of the
afcendant of the other nativity,. the)' arc thereby configurated under a con-

The concord or enmity of tbe planets is a moft obv.ious ·fpeculation~
com'prifed in their own natural quality and aaion; viz. Saturn hath fym-
pathy with Jupiter, Mercury, and the Moon ; ·but a {hong antipathy to .
the Sun, Mars, and Venus. Jupiter hath affinity with Saturn, the Sun,
Venus, Mercury, and the Moon; and is only difco.rdant with the planet
Mars. Mars hath pacific tendency only to Ven\ls, and that by meaus
of her fuperior property in allaying his intemperate beat;.for otherwife
they are contrary in nature, Mars being hot and dry,. and Venus ·cold
and moifi. The Sun hath friendihip only to Jllpiter and Venus; and /
is inimical to Saturn, Mars, Mercury, abd the .Mo~>n. Venus is com'~"
placently beheld 'by Jupiter, Mars, the Sun, Mercury, and the Moon;;
but rigid Saturn is her mortal enemy. Mercury hath fri.endiliip to Sa-
turn, Jupiter, and Venus; but the Sun,. the Moon, and Mars, are his
enemies. The Moon· pacaically beholds Saturn, Jupiter, and Venus;.
but hath ehmity to Mars, the Sun, and Mercury. The Dragon's Head -
·hath fympathy with Jupiter an<;l Venus ; but antipathy to Saturn, Mars,
the Sun, Mercury, and the Moon. The Dragon's Tail hath ·s.aturo
and Mars in frieodfilip; but Jupiter, the Sun, Venus, Mercury, and the
Moon, are enemies : the Part of Fortune is.in this.cafe confiitute.d P,re-
cifely the fame as the Moon. .
By theie rules it will be obvious, that, where we find, in two nativi-
ties, the Suo and Moon, or Mercury and the Moon, or tlu: Sw1 and Mer-
cury, configurated in each other's places, there will exift fomc degree of.
refpea and good-will between the natives; but, if Saturn, Jupiter. Ve-
nus, or Mars, ~re thus·found, there will be fomc ditfentio~ IJI~~ witll\
a defire of friendihip. If Jupiter or Saturn are found in reception of each
other's place in the.different nativiti~~. their fr~ndthip. will exifi: mcrel1
for purpofes of emolument or avance;. but, af Mars and Vcnus arc
in each other's place, the attachment Qf th.e. parties will be formed (Q[·
illicit and difilonourable praelices,
. When, in·the Dfltivities of any two. pcrfons, we find the Sun or Mars in,
oppofition to Mercury or the Moon, the. parties will delight to injure-
and opprds each otber; but. where Saturn or Mars arc .in oppofitioo,_ th~·
.enmity wiJl be perpetual. Where the malefic frars ~ce, the parties.
will agree in the purfuit of wi~kcdnefs, though unfaithful to each other.
The Sua in the place of any friendly planet, declares unity between th.e
parties for integrity;. Jupiter, for utility ;. Venus, for p,leafare i and the-

enemies; and. to make this enquiry obvious to all my readers, I have, in
page ·44~ giveu ample rules to deteCt and to elude . their malice. l ·
iball now .apply them in my obfervations an the prefeut nativity. On
the cufp.of the twelfth houte, we &nd tb.e. ijga.a ,Libra, which is the day:-
houfc of Venus, and wholly under her govetoment9 in ··the houfe of her
exaltation ; and, as file is in direct oppofition to the lord of- the afcen-
dant, and is al{o lady of the {eventh houfc, file obvioufly declares that
foine woma1.1 ihould become an implacable enemy to the. native ; and that
this woman filooM not- be of tbe ltlean or vulgar fort, is declared ·by-
Veous being· iu hor dfential · dignjtie&..· But, as ·neither of the hami-
naries are affected, nor the lord of the afcendant vitiated by malefic rays,
it is impoffible the malignity of this .woman's. nefentment ihould ever ·
materially aifetl the weJl..being of the native. Bcfides, there are two
royal fixed flars potited .in the twelfth ·boufe, viz. Artlurus and Spi·ca
Virginis, which not only furnilh an argument that this fem?.le oppol1ent
iliould do ~him little injury, but that no ·private enemies thould· ever be
able to accompliih his ruin, ·or opprefs him by imprifonment. And, as
the luminaries are free from the aftliBioo both .of Saturn and Mars, and
as no malignant .planet o~cupies the afcendant, twelfth, or 6xtb, houfe of
the,figure,:I am free to declare .my opinion, that the native never will be
expofed even to the danger ·of imprifonment, either· by civil oi: criminal
procefs, which might arifc either from · the Mnd ·of jufiice, or through ·
his own indifcretion. · · . . · . · ·

The top column of the T.ablc, from left to right, ·difplays io regular

.ending with Pifces; under which are rcfpcClivdy placed thirty degrees
of the 'zodiac for each fign,- making: in· the ·whole three hundred and
uty degrees. The urft cotumn on the left-contains degrees· and mi-
nutes as far as completes one flgn; and, whenever minutes arc joiocd to
degrees, it iliows there is an afpea in the nativity that falls in tbat degree
and minute of the correfponding {Jgn under which the planet ftaods.
For example, under ·tbe letters D. M. at the top of the firft column,
fiand o 44· and under the fign Virgo, in the common angle of moetin&,
is found the planet Mars; whictl O.ows that Mars, in this nativity,

general approbation of his friends and teachers, but are a happy fymbol
of that early defire of learning and improvement, which was for fome

native's defire of learning. · This ·and the three former directions.. came
up progreffive.ly, and ?perated upon the mental powers of the native
by regular gradation, until he.was near twelve years of age, before the
effect of the laft direClion wholly fubfi~ed.
) fl. 1t-) P. 9 M. The Moon to the trine of Jupiter. This is a
good direction. The Moon is confiituted. lady of the ninth houfe,
the houfe of fcience; and Jupiter is lord of the fecond and fifth, co-'
operating in the force of mental endowments. Under this direction
the native made his firft effay in fcientific literature, having compiled
a fmall piece~ for the Gentleman's Magazine, which ·was highly
approved. With this direCtion he had another operating, namely, the
~oon to th~ parallel of Venus in mundo; which, being of the fame
quality, gave force and energy to the in~uenc~ of the pre~eding.
E9 M. C. . Part of Fortune to t~e medit:tm-creli. This is a w;ry re-
.markable,. and equally potent, direction, operating upon the mental
,faculties; and it came up when the native was .about thirteen. years and
four months old, as may be feen by the calculat10n p. 66x, where thefe
direCl:ions are worked up and equated by the folar motion. Under the
influence of this direCtion, the native, at that early period of his life,
compiled a moft ingenious mathematical difquifition, which was printed
iu the Gentleman's Diary, and rec~ived univerfal approbation. .
El:) 0 7J.. Part of Fortune to the quartile of Jupiter. ·This direClion
,ortends evil to the native's fiate of health, and has a malefic tendency.
Jltpiter, though in nature the moft benignant planet, in this cafe pro-
duces an evil effect, by the conftitution of the afpeCl: he forms. He is
pofited, according to his latitude in Gemini, in the eighth ·houfe, among
fixed ftars of the quality of Mars, in quartile with the Part of Fortulie,
which, in this nativity, is Hyleg, and ftrongly appertains. to the na-.
tive's health, and life ; and therefore, according to the radical effect.
of Jupiter in this pofition, which caufes beat and putrefaCtion of the.
blOC)(}, I conclude that this direCtion muft have brought with it a
violent fever, becaufe the quartile afpeCl is produffive of the greateft
evi~ and becaufe this direClion falls in the terms and face of Mars, who
is the author of choler, and uniformly productive of putrefaCtion of the
animal juices ; though here are no ~eftimonies to filow that its violence
thould be fucb as to endanger life. This direClion came up in fourteen
years from the time of birth ; and I have been affured that Mr. Witchell,
at the age of fourteen, fuffered feverely from a fever, which held him a
confiderable time, as the force of this direClion obvioufiy dcmoofi:rates.

. 0 P. 1t M. The Sun to the pa-rallel of Jupiter in Mundo. As this
parallel is m·ade to the feventh houfe, it muft relate to fome contract
·on the part of the native ; and as the Sun is lord · of the tenth, the
houfe of trade and profeffion, I conclude this afpetl governed fome
contraa in bufinefs. Upon e•?quiry, I found the native was bound
apprentice to a watchmaker and goldfmith ; which is aptly enough.
defcribed by a conjunClion of the Sun and Mercury in Aries.. This
direClion, as we have before proved, came up in fifteen years and
twenty-one days; at that precife age the native and his mafi:er, as he
hath fince informed me, executed the indenture, and he became appren-
tice to a watchmaker.
EB Sfq. ~-) Z. P. ·1t-EB d & . Thefe remarkable afpeCts imme-
diately fucceeded, . and produced, as their direClions feverally brought
them into etfetl, thefe unpleafant circumfi:ances which .are invariably
felt in al! fimilar cafes. The Part of Fortune to the fefquiquadrate afpetl
of Mercury, is a diretlion that took off the thoughts and the attention of
the native from·all mechanical employment, and fixed them upon ma-
thematical contemplation. The Moon to a zodiacal parallel of Jupiter,
ftrengthens and enlarges this fi:udious and contemplative faculty, expands
the underflanding, ·and allures the mind to a purfuit of thofe acquire-
ments, which render manual employments infupportable. The Part of
Fortune to the conjunction of Mars, could not fail, when the direCtion
came up, to produce violent contentions between the native and h~s maf-
ter, in confequence of his totalneglea of the bufinefs, and of his inatten-
tion to the orders and infiruClions given him therein. Upon inquiry,.· I
found my judgment in no refpeet erroneous; for, although the mafterwas
on the one hand continually remonfirating and complaining of negleCt
and inattention, the apprentice, on the other, was totally indifferent as to
the ill confequences threatened, and ftill addicted himfelf to the ufe of
books, to the folving and ·propounding mathematical quefi:ions, and to
the publication of anonymous ·pieces in the magazines. *- ·
0 *':>. This is unquefiionably a good direCtion. The Smi is- lord·
. of the tenth, the houfe of profeffional honour, and Saturn is lord of'theJ
fourth, the houfe of hereditary ·acquifitions; fo that the fextile afpett,
formed betwixt them, leads me to conceive, that the native, while un~
der the influence of this direction, formed a refpetlable and advantage.:.
ous· connexion with fome elderly perfons, who approved his frudious
turn, and admired the gravity of his manner, notwithftanding ifs unRt-
nefs fo.r a life of mechanical labour, and the anger and uneafinefs it'oc-:

though of a moll: dell:rutlive tendency, yet is too common to perfons

only forms a femiquartile, its effeCt, when brought up by diretlioD,

The effeCt of this direCtion was at its utmofr height when the native
was eighteen years and four months old ; about which time, as he has
fince told me, he was fo intent upon Audy, as to frame a contrivance to
blin~ up the crevices of the doors and windows, that no part of the fa-

is a no lefs remarkable than fatal direaion,. again appe_
rtaining to the

relates to the bufinds ; but it prefages the death of the mafter, and once
·more fets the apprentice at liberty; as though fate had really !hove
with him to obtain a different purfuit. But here, as l have been con-
fidently informed, th~ parent again iuterpofed his Covereign authority,
and, in fpite of every argument, and of every importunity, fo prejudiced
was he in favour of the emoluments of trade, and fo fixed in his mind up-
on that which he had before tingled out for his fon, that he loft no time in
choofing him out a new fituation. Here we perceive, in its ftrougefi:
colours, the abfurdity, as well as the evil confequence, of forcing upon
the hands of youth, ~vocations which their nature loathes, and which
are foreign both to their ability and their inclination. Let us here for
a moment paufe; and, look_which way we will, we thall find ample tef
..
timonies of the truth of this miftaken zeal for the provifion of our chil-
dren. A zeal which has, more than all other caufes put together, fur-
nithed tbe world with a race of bunglers in almoft every profeffion :
for the mind, like the temperature of the body, cannot be forced, but
will be governed by its own immediate laws; a circumfrance, which if
d\l,ly attended to, and regulated by the quality of the fignificators at birth,.
would not only prove much more highly advantageous to children, but
· infinitely more f>eneficial to mailers of every craft and occupation.

cumfiance : .
He had not been many days with his new ma.ftcr, before he was Jeft
in the ihop with tto other companion than a ycxmg lad, who had bcea
put apprentice to the fame perfon a year or two before. At the tame
time that the mafier's abfeuce furuiflled Mr. Witchell with an oppor-
lJnity of taki.ng a book from his pocket to read, which was invariably
the cafe upon all fuch occafions, it atforded the other lad fit time to go
to play. A foldier's mu1ket ftood in oue· corner of the thop, moft aptly
denoted ~y the quartile pofition of Mars, which the boy too.k up, and
began to perform the mantaal exercifc with. When he came to that

I was quite fatisfied'; it relieved me 'from my doubts; and, ·upon eq~at­
ing the dired:ion; I told him this muft have happened on or very near
the 26th of September, .1747; for, though the other afped: came up:
- foouer, yet its influence was held on by the quick fucceffion and flmilar
quality of the co-operating or fecondary afped:, which was not ripe in
its malefic tendency, until the day· Mars ·began to feparate from his
auxiliaries, which was on the day above-mentioned, at which time the
native was near twenty years of age. After endeavouring to recoiled: all
the circumftances of the faa, he acknowledged 1 was firid:ly right io
point of time, as well as in my judgment of the danger he had been ex~
pofed to by means of fire.
T.he aftrological reafon of this narrow but happy efcapc is thus de-
lined from the native's hc;>rofcopical figure of birth. In the eighth.
houfe, which is the houfe of death, we find the benevolent planet Ju-
piter, which is an irrefragable argument that the native 1hould not die a-
violml, but a natural, death. Now, bad Saturn or Mars been there, tho
evil had certainly touched his life. Another decifive teftimouy for the
prefervation 6f ·the native's life is, that the dired:ion operating comes
from a benefic planet; and, though the dired:ion be of an evil quality,
yet, as it is not governed by the auareta, nor by any crofs direelion either
from Saturn, Mars, or the Sun, to the Par~ of Fortune, it is imp'offible,
according to the radical import 6f the fignificators, that life lhould be
deftroyed, although expofed, in this remarkable manner, to the mofi:
unequivocal inftrument of death. .
· I have dwelt the longer upon thefe two direCtions, becaufe I confider: ·
th~m as the moft remarkable in the whole figure ; and I am fure theiF
eifed: is equally extraordinary; befides, it tends to lhow, that in geui-
tures where the fignificators clearly demonftrate .a long life an~ na~ural·
death, and where no crofs malefic configurattoli firongly 1rradsates
the aphetic ·p1ac;e, however the native, in his journey through life,
may be expofed to the moft imminent perils and dangers ; yet, if bene6o
fignificators, as ·in the prefent nativity, have the afcendancy in point of.
dignity and couftitution of place, be tltall fafely overcome them an, and
enjoy life until that period of time arrives, when exhauftcd nature can,
no longer exercife her proper fuoBions, and dilfolution becomes the ne-
ceffary coufequence.

to avow this? or, if he did, it could avail nothing, fince falls and fuppo- .

time at t~e native ; and 'Uiny it was not, who can define? It is enough
for me to iliow, that, by the native's figure of birth, ~e was not to re-
ceiva any fatal injury; I will now thank the mao, who, by any other·
or tfually reafooable hypothefis, ~ill point out to me why the piece was
not levelled at the native the ftcond time? or, if it had, let him prove
that .the. piece muji of neceffity have gone. off, and that the confequent

came up by direction in twenty years and five weeks from the time of
birth; at wbich period of the native's life, as be bath frequently affured

tion likewife Mrs. Witchell becomes pregnant·with a daughter.

pcrfetl fiate of human bli{s mutable and precarious. The native him.-
felf will be much affiiCled with melancholy by this direction.

Mrs. Witchell another daughter, and demonftrates a bad and frcldy la-
bour, attended with a dangerous fever .to the native, as is declared by
lhe conftitution of this paralJel with Mar~; for parallels are either good
or bad, according to the nature and quality of the planets by which th~·
are refpetlively brought up. This judgment is likewife confi,med oy
the pofition of the Dragoo's Tail in the tenth.

greater part of his thirty-fixth year difiinguifiled, at which period thefe
direClions yielded their influence; and many times, when he had reafon

or other confiantly intervened, to fet his hopes afide.

threaten great anxiety of mind and depreffion of fpitits to. the native,

and power. He will likewife fuffer fome affliction in his eyes, and.
dizzinef.Cl of the head, with melancholy and perturbation of mind, whilft
the fecond diredion is under its operation.
)* l). The Moon to the fextile of Saturn, by converfe motion.
Under this direction the _
native has another daughter born ; but its in-
fluence upon his ternporal affairs is but little better than the former;
fi.nce this afpe8 comes up very quickly after them, and participates of
their quality and temperature. The native recovers completely from
his indifpofition; but the viciffitudes of fortune, and the vexatious of his
mind, continue with little abatement, until the effetls ofthis dir.e8ion are
whoJiy taken off by the fucceffion of another.
]) * S?· This is a very promifing direCtion, replete with happinefs
and good fortune to the .tlative. The powers of fenfe, of difcernment,
and invention, are here ftrongly .combined, and the refult leads to
profperity and fame. The native's difcovcries in the longitude are here
moft aptly depiaed; and I have no doubt, but Wlder the force of this
direction they were rendered complete. The friendly rays e>f the Moon
and Mercury, in elevated places of the horofcope, are uniformly pro-
dutlive of the moll: acute . inteJleCl:ual endowments; but relate, in a
more peculiar manner, to an extcntive .knowledge in fcience, and to an
unbounded comprehenfion of the power and extent of figures. This •
direCtion came up in thirty-eight years and eight months from the hour
of birth, at which period the native .made his laft and final improve·
ments in the longitude, for which his majefty rewarded him with· a
liberal annuity during the refidue of .his life. Let it be remembered
·that this afpect falls in twenty-five degrees fifteen minutes of Aquarius;.

mental philmophy. Under this direaion we perceive the foundation of
a,joumey, which will probably be taken in confequence of fotne advan·

Afc. * f) . This direction is armed with the moft ferious affliClion
to the native of any thing that hath yet gone before it. It is the ·
harbinger of fome fudde1i difeafe that threatens life.- And, if we con..
·ftder the radical import of this .afpcct, taken colleCtively with the irra-·
diations ·of the other planets, and their refpcctive pofitions and par-
ticular places in the figure, as they ftand influenced and impregnated
with the ambient quality of the figns; we can have no reafon to hefitate
in bur judgment, that this affliction will fall as it were infiantaneoufly,
'aod that it will come by fome defeCt in the animal circulation, or in
tho functions of the brain, whereby fenfation will be dcftroyed, me-
mory obliterated, or bodily motion withheld ; but the moft probable
effeCl: of the three arifes from the fuperior dignity of Saturn, who
· ~verns this afpe8; and, as he rules the retentive faculty of man,
rt becomes pretty evident that this diforder lhould be a fit of the
palfy, falling upon the brain, whereby the native lhould fuffer a
privation of feufc and motion, particularly deftructive. to ·the ideaa
of the mind~ and to the .force of memory. Under this directio11
Mr. Witcbell really had the misfortune to fa.U down. in an apo.:
pl~ic · it, which held· him . for fome time in a fiatc of perfetl
infeufibility, deprived of fight rancl motion, and of every vifible ap-
pearance of life. When circulation was refiored, and pulfation re-
turned, the native beeamc· fenfible to pain~ and re-poiTclfed all the
f\lntlions of the body; but his memory continued for fome time wholly
arrefted, and was ever aft& greatly impaired: his whole frame felt ·tbc
.thock, and his confi:itution was vifibly firuggling with it, during the
full time of this ·direetion. Our recovery, indeed, from all complaints
iDftuenced by Saturn is ufually ftow; but particularly fo, when they arc

cites aa~orous -defires; and I have no doubt but the native, even under
an impaired conftitution, and a Confirmed nervous habit• . was more
tban ordinarily awakened to thefe. defires during the Operation of this
afpcet. It was, neverthelefs, too indelicate a quefiion for me to put,
however my curiofity might have been excited by the vilible defignation
of the planets, or however anJious I might have been to juftify the di-
reCtions of a nativity which were intended for public fcrutiuy. .
) ~ & M. This direction participates extremely of the quality of
the foregoing, and they operate in many inll:ances with a joint inftu~
ence. being both from afpeCts made in the world, au'd coming up
Qearly together. The native had certainly fl:rong predilections in fa-
vour of fome particular female; and, if his confiitution was not Come-
what impaired, and his mind pretty much eugroffed by other conccrni, 1
have no kind of doubt but he would have married again while this ...di•
r.caion operated; but though it gives radical import of fuch an
event, yet, .when we come to confider it maturely with the quality of
o~her planets, whofe horofcopical places at the birth gave them a con•
cc;rn in the completion of fuch an event, we thall find, fame fow argu- ·
m,ents wanting ta give it a complete turn in favour of a fecond matril'll.e-o
njal engagement. But t~at the native had ll:roug prepoffcfiions that way
I. have not the leafr dQUbt, and with a lady who .perhaps is no~ living; and·
~ght confirm the truth of my remark.
Afc. ~ & • This direction is naturally good, iuclinin~ the native to·
fortitude and perfeverance, and gives animation to the fpiritt, and vigoar
tQ the mind. He will, however, be fomcwhat abfolute and arbitrary
u_ndcr it, particularly in his own family, and with his more immediate.
domell:ics ·and dependents. With .rcfpect to ·bodily infirmity, he will
feel an afflictiOn of choler, and feveriih tendency, induced by the qua•·
lity ~f Mars,. who has borne ~ul~ in the three laft dir~~ions; .and, by
thus mcreafing the energy of h1s mfluence upon the fpmts, w11l leave
them fubjeCl to a flow nervous fever, defi:ruClive to the radical moifture.-
of natu.re, and.to the free circulation ofthe blood and juices.

melancholy. It is -a remark~ble circumftaoce, that Saturn -and the Sun
1hould form the laft afpect in this Iiativity, which precedes that of
. death; and that of the Sun, being anareta, no fooner feparates from Sa- .
turn, the moft malevolent planet, than he applies to and receives the
Part ·of Fortune, 'which is hyleg. Neither is it lefs curious to remark
the gradual fatality wh~ch is here brou~ht on a~d ~nnounced to the na-
tive. Mars, the fmaller mfortune, occuptes the chtef mfluence of the three·
dire(lions which operate prior to .this; and he no fooner retires, than he
is-fucceeded by the greater infortune, Saturn, who gives place to the
Sun, the anareta. And thus, operating· by a gradual yet fenfible influ-
ence, from a lefs to a fuperior ftate of itifirmity, brings on that inevita-
ble and final deftiny, which gives every good and virtuous individual "a
place amongfi: the gods."
e 8 0. In this direction, therefore, we fee the two princi"pal fig-·
ni6cators of life and death, which were conftituted in the radical figure·
of birth, form that fatal configuration, · which, in all countries, and
in all nativities, is uniformly the fame. The one, at the -moment we
enter into this world, is conftituted hyleg, that is, giver or protector:
of life, ·becaufe we are formed and nouriihed in the womb under ·th~
influence and temperature of that particular planet, and becaufe it·
guards us in ·eve-rr peril of our earthly pilgri~age.. The other is in the
{arne early period conftituted anareta, or deftroyer of Jiofe, becaufe it is
tempered by its horofcopical pofition, with qualities diametrically .op-;
pofite to th~ hyleg; and becaufe, whenever it can form an evil confi.. .
guration with the byleg, it will deprive it of all its power and efficacy
and overcome its .prefervi~g faculty, by a fuperabundant energy of op~
pofing matter, which nothmg lefs than a fupernatural caufe can either
alt~r or prevent•. And therefore, when that · ce~tain. cau!e, that vege-·
tattve faculty, wh1ch fupports nature and _fufiams hfe, IS thus over- ·
whelmed by a redundancy or fuperiority of matter.or influence, incom-
patible with, and contrary to, itfelf, its exiftence becomes annihilated
and the native dies. Thus it is in the prefeut cafe. The Sun; in th~
nativity, being conftituted of a direct oppofite quality to the Part of
Fortune:, will,· whenever they for~ -an oppo~tion ?r quartile afpeel', ·
abforb Its power, and deftroy 1ts mflueuce; m wh1ch cafe~ whatever ·
be the thing that was uouriihed or brou~ht into being under it, will be·
deftroyed likewife.
If we regard, with a. critical eye, .the prefent 6aute of birth we·
ftW.l find every proof of ·thofe oppofing qualities in thefe two fignffica.. ·

tors that confiitute the hyleg and a11ar~ta; but the number of days, i
_wedcs, mo11ths, or years, which thefe two fignificators will occupy
b~ore they meet or form this -difcordant afpeCt~ c.au only be known by
equating the arch of direCtion which brings them into contact. · This
1 have done in ·p. ~' where it appears, that thefe two fignificators
were fifty-fix years and ten months in coming to this pofition in. the
heavens, from their refpetlive places or pofitions at the time of the na-
tive•s birth; and it is a faa too well efiablithed to admit either doubt or
refutation, that_ the native died with .a ll:roke of the ·palfy, which this
afpetl defcribes, on the 29~h of January, 1785, at which time he was
~xaaly fifty·ftx years and teu months old! · · . ·
Thus it is apparent, that, however unaccountable or undefinable thefe
planetary irradiations mignt appear, they certainly are what the Su-
preme Author of all things originally intended them to be, the natural
and efficient caufcs of thoie firange and complicated mixtures and af- ,
feetions·in men, which have confounded the (peculations of the wifeft
philofophers. And I am perfuaded that no mall, unlefs it be thofe
· who are wilfully obftinate, can hefitate in forming his opinion of the
truth of thefe premifes; particularly after obferving that no remarkable
incident of this native's life ever happened, but under tbe uniform influ-
ence, and as it. were by the confent, of one or other of thefe direet.ons,
the defining of which confiitutes the only true and rational mode of
pred'itting by, or of calcul~tiug, nativities.
But, before l difmifs this fubjeCt, and in order to render every part
of the fcience as plain as poffible, it will be proper, 'in this place, to
explain what is meant by Revolutions and Tranfits.-A revolution is a
rttlirrupg or revolving ~k of ~ny one of the celeftial ·bodies to the
fame place 01' point in the heavens from whence it fi·rfi teceded; for fo
·the word radically imports. But, in our application of it to explain or
illufirate any ~rticular circumftance in a nativity, it ufually refers only
to the return of the Sun to his radical place in the zodiac, that is; to
the fame degree and minttte of the fign wherein ·he was pofited in the ·
hour of birth. For the truth is, that revolutions and tranfits more
properly appertain to the fate of empiros than to t~ circumfiances of
a nativity. It has, however, l?een found, by efiablithed obfervation
and~ praltice, <that the revolu-tions, not ouly of the Sun. but of all
the .other principal tignifiaatdrt· in a .uativity, to their radical places in
the lwr.ofcope, excite a. very powerful additional -influence in the afpeas
and dir~s ..chen oporat.i44g~ -whether- of a tood or evil nature; but

participates ftrongly of the f-.me quality and temperatur.e as the confi-
guration or direaio,n _then _
iu force. And h~nce it is ufual for ever.y
judicious proficient in this art, when he is calculating and bringing up
the direaions of a nativity, to erea revolutional figures through the
whole period of the native's life, in order to obtain the moft fatisfa8ory
information in the probable or poffible means, whereby any important
diretliou, whether .good or bad, might be increafed or diminiilied in
its natural quality and import, by the falliug-in of the revolution . of
any other fignificator, or of any particular planet. tranfiting the ,pla~e,
under the influence of which the cufiomary effea of the direCtion may.
be varied.
The ufual way of erecting a revolutionar 1igure is by adding five
hours and forty-eight minutes to the exaa time of the native's birth
for every year's r~volution ; and, when the aggregate·exceeds twenty-
four hours, the twenty-four are to be cafi away. For example, I. would
fet a revolutional figure of Mr. Witchell's birth. _Now the time of.
the day on which he was born was fevc:n hours fifty-two minutes in
the afternoon. The figure of birth, it muft be obferv-ed, ftands for-the
firll: year; coufequently the firft revolutional figure to be fet for the na-
tive exhibits the pofitions of the luminaries and planets for the fecond .
year of his age; and the feveuth alfo anfwers from the feventh to th~
eighth; and therefore, if we add five hours forty-eight min~tes fo_r every
year, cafiing away the aggrega~e of twenty.-four hours as often as they oc-
cur, we thall uniformly obtain the precife fituations and pofitions of th~
planets for the year required.

Having delineated the figure, we are to examine how it a$rees with
the _radix, or original figure, of birth, and wh~her it be m fextile,
trine, or oppofition, to it; and. alfo what planets make their return to
their own -radical plrces, or to the radical places of others; and alfo _
whether .the" luminaries be well beheld by the benefics, or afHiCled by
the rays of ·noxious planets, or by the fixth, eighth, or twelfth; houfes
of the radical figure of birth ; or w_hether .Saturn or Mars afHiel the
places o.f the Sun, Moon, or afcendant of the radix, or whether there
occur any eclipfc either upon or near the radical places of the th_reo
Hylegiacals; for, according as thefe circumftances are found, fo will the
atfairs of the native be either injured or advantaged, and his health
either imp~ired or eftablithed, as the cafe thall happen to be. For, if
unbenign occurrences in the revolution fall in with the qualities and rays
of .the .fame difcordant nature in .the radix; evil and afHielion will be
prcdiacd·in proportion to the ftrength. and :qualities of the fignifica..;

tors; and, on the contrary, if grateful and benign influences th~s con.. ·
cur, .and .. mutually aid and unite .in benevolent temperatures, .then great
and lafiing good, according ·to the different natures of the planetary
caufes and effeCts, will- undoubtedly take pl11ce. But, to make this
f(>mewhat more familiar to the reader's underfi:anding, I ihall give a few
general rules, whereby judgment may be-determined in other cafes.
\Vhenever the hyleg, or giver of life, whether it be the Sun, Moon,
Part of Fortune, or Afcendant, in the radix or genethliacaJ figure of
birth, is found to behold its place in 'the revolution~] figure,: by form-
in~ a· fextile or trine afped: with each other, it is confidered a vilible
argument that the native thall, during that year, enjoy health of body,
and that. his affairs will in a general way go well; but, if this afpeCl:.,be
made by a quartile or oppofitiot~, the contrary effects are denoted. So
if the Moon, in both the radix and revolntional figure, be free from the
malignant rays of the infortunes, and not combufi, it is Jikcwife an
arcrument of an healthful and profperous year, more efpecially if the be
co~figurated wi~h benefic fi:ars. But, if the Moon be combufi, or af-
fliCted with the rn alefic rays of Saturn or Mars, it will prove an unlucky
and fickly 7ear.
Jf, in the revolutionaJ figure, an rclipfe or comet ihould fall upon _
the afcendant, it threatens a year of great trouble and anxie.ty to the
native. But, if the eclipfe in the revolutional figure; whether of the
Sun ,or Moon, lhould fall exaClly in the fame degree as the hyleg, or
giver of life, in the radical figure of birth, and any violent configuration
of the m~lefics, thould begin to operate at the fame time. it will, in
all probability, affeCt- the native's life, by increaling the malignancy of
the afpeCt, and heightening the violence of the means, whatever it may .
be, by which life is .threatened. . So, if ap eclipfe of the Sun 1hould
·in ljke mamier .fall in the fame degree and minute of the Dragon's ·
Head, it alfo endangers life; but, if it only falls .near the fame point,
it then threatens danger or difeafe in that year, but not fach as fhould
touch life.
If in the revolution the Part of Fortune fall~ in the fame degreo
•s in the radix, it is implicative of the fame effeCts, and will tend to (a.
cilitate them i_n a more eminent and obvious manner; and, if it happens
that this pofrtion falls . in .a .good ~(pea with itA difpofitor, it will greatly
ten~ to increafe tpe .native's wealth or fubfi:ance quring that year; but,
if ~be afpeet ~ ll)ade with. ~alefic rays, and the b~rofQQpical . ·pc:Uition

or the Part of ll&none i" abjeB: places, it portendt a dirca contrar:t
elfea. If is, how~ver, always to be remembered, that any planet
fttoAg and drentia11y dignified in a tevolution, and at the fa&Dc time io
good afpea with the Par~ of Fortune, or with the . lord of the fecond
houfe, or with. Jupiter, Venus, or the Moon in reception, uniformly
prefages good fortuue. to the native during that year.
If the Sun be in the firfl: houfe, mid•heaven, or eleventh houfe of'
tbe revolutional ngure, in good afpefl with Jupiter or Venus in tb.
radix, and free from the \1nbenign radiations of the infortunes, it de..
&tOtes an increafe of honour and reputation, of refpea and. efteem,
during that year, although no direC\ion whatever Chould be then ope·..
rating to increafe its influence. So Jupiter, well configurated in the
afccndant, or in Pifces, Cancer9 or Sagittarius~ indicate& the fam~; ac-
cording to the quality and occupation of the native; but be denotcts
honour and eG-eem in a much more eminent degree when poUted in the
medium creli. Or~ if the rcvolutional afccndant be the place of the
Dragon's Head in the radix, and irradiat~d by Jupiter, it likcwife pt'C)4
motes honour, and it1creafcs '"orldly o{h:em s a1ki fo, wi&e fJerfo, if the
akendant of &he radical figure of binh be the pla~e of the Drag1Jn'•
Head in the revolution, it denotes the fame.
lf in the revoJutional figure the luminaries are conjoined in the fe-
venth or fourth houfe, it prefagts death either to tbe father or mothct
of the native; more efpecially if their places ·in the radical figure bo
likewife infortunated by malignauc rays. If Sat\lrn be found to affti&
the Sun by quart1le or oppohtiou, or by conjun8ion in ouc of the an•
gular houtes, it is an argument that tbe facbcr fuall make his exit; bu4
if the Moon be thus aftlitlcd by Saturn, •ith relative pofttions in tlac
two horofcopes, it prefages death to the mother; for in thefe cafes the
. Sun is natural 6gnificator of the father, and the Moon of the motber;
and, when, thus conng\uat~d in a ravoJutiorJaJ Ugurc, they fGrbodt
death to happen within the year. ·. . .
Whenever the lord of rhe fifth is pofated in the afccndant, ot the lorci
of the afcendant in the 6fth houfe of tbe rcvolucional igute, aad in a .
fruitful ftgn, with due affinity to the radix, it is a mofi propitiou1 U>l).o.
figuration to give the native iffue, if married; but, if finglc, .it will be.a
very dange.rous year to the native, by intercourfes with the other fex.~
If the natift be a male-, he w-m moft probably &aw u illegicirRatc otf-

efca pe . ruin7 and will -probably become the unproteCted mother of.m .
unfortunate orp~an. This afpeCl is therefore to be regar:ded witp the.
urmoft attention, and refifted wnb becoming fortitude and refolutioaby
both fexes. •
~ . ' .
If the lord of ~he fifth be pofited in the twelfth, (it being the eightb..
from the fifth,) in fimilar afpeCl to the radix, it threatens death to the
llative's children. So likew fe if Saturn or Mars, or the Dragon's Tail,
be pofited in the fifth houfe of the revolutiortal figure, in evil afpeet
with the radix, it forbodes death to the native'-s jffue in the courfe of
that year. Or if Saturn or Mars atHiCl: the fifth houfe or its lord. by,
conjunction, quartile, or oppofition, it implies the fame. .
Whe~ever the lord of the afcendant, in the rtwolutional figure, is po-
fited in.the feventh houfe, and comes by direCtion to the radical place of
Venus in the figure of birth; or if the lord of the feventh, in the revo-
lution, is brought by ~ireClion to the afcendant of the radix; they afford ·
ample proofs that the native will marry in the courfe ofthat year. Or,
if Jupiter, Venus, the Moon, or Part of Fortune, be thus irradiated, it
denotes a propenfity in the native to contraCl: matrimony, although cir..
cumftances might occur to prevent it.
Whenever Saturn is pofited in the feventh h9ute of the radix, and
found alfo in the feventh houfe of the revolution, it threatens death to
the native's 'wife before the expiration of that year. Mars and the Dra~
goo's Tail thus configurated, imports little lefs. · Mercury, if affiitled
by the malevoleuts.,· and in the feveuth houfe, declares much danger to
the native; butt if configurated with Venus, under the fame malignant
rays, it threatens mifchief both to the native and his wife. · · .
Mar~, Mercury, and Venus, being ' the proper fignificators of pro-
feffion, if they are affii8ed in the revolutiollal figure, with direct affinity;
to the fame places in the radix, prefage great forrow and embarralfment
to the native ·in his line of bulinefs during .that year. .But a comet
or eclipfe falling upon the mid-heaven of the radix and revolution,
irradiated by the good afpe& of either the.Sun or Mar~ will produce;
a very profperous year •to the n~ive, and will bring him honour an4
preferment.

er "behold the radical figure of birth. ·There ·is now anQther effeCt to
be confidered, which the erratic fiars produce by their refpe8ive motions
round the Sun, which are caUed tranjits, that is, a returning to or
re-affuming either their own place, or the place of any other planet in
the revolutional figure, fo as exactly to correfpond with their radical
places in the figure of birth. Thefe tranfits, when of a remarkable or
eminent nature, always produce an effect or influence of their own, ·
peculiar to the nature and quality of that particular fiar by which fucb
traniits are made; but whenever they faiJ in places of the figure, or in ·
configuration with other planets, where a direction is coming up, or
any difrinct afpect then operating, they never fail to co-operate with,
and give additional force and efficacy to, fuch afpects or direBions,
whether good or evil, as the cafe and quality of the 1everal fignificators ·
lhall happen to be. And for this reafon it is highly proper, whenever
the fpeculum of a nativity is projected, and the various directions
brought up, to examine what tranfits are likely to occur in the courfe
of the native's life that may poffibly vary the effect of any particular
direction; and, confequently, of the incidents or events predieled there-·
by as likely to happen to the native. For this reafon I have annexed a.
few general obfervations, calculated to direct the reader's judgment un-
der this fpeculum. ·
When Saturll' returns to or tranfits his own radical place in the revo~
lutional figure, well dignified, he indicates profperity to the native ; and;.
if he be lord of the afcendant c.itl1er iu the radical·or revolutional horo-
fcope, he will render that profperity frill more excellent and. c~mfpicu­
ous. If Saturn tranfits the radical place of Jupiter, propitioufly confi~
gurated, .it, denotes increafe of fortune by the favour of eminent men;
if he tranfits the place of Mars, it giv:es advantages from friends or bre•
thren ;· and, if thefc tranfits are made with evil configurations,.the con-
trary evils wilt be produced.
. '
When Saturn tranfits the place of the Sun, it is implicative of fome
ftrong or violent contention with magiftrates, or with men in power, in
the courfe of that year; and, if accompanied with afpecb of difeafe,
will produce bodily ficknefs and infirmity. If Saturn tranfits the place
of Venus, it demonftrates infelicity from a female caufe; if the place
of Mercury, it implies advantages from A:udy; if the place of the
Moon. it declares afflielion both of the body and mind;· if ·the place
of the Dragon's Head, it tends to promote the native's good forrune;
t.ut,.. if Saturn tranfits the place of the ·Dragon's Tail,. it has a moa
dangeroaa
.I
·,

dangerous and malignant tendency. If the place ·.of tbe Part ofFo~
tone be tranfited by Saturn, with benevolent rays, it denotes iocrcafe
of fubLl:ance and eftate; but, if by evil rays, tbc contrary ~Wcct will
be produced.
. .
Precifely the fame is the refalt of all the other figni&cators tranfit-
ing their own or other plantts' places in the radical or revolntional
horofcopes; with only this invariable difiinClion, .that the etfeas vary
according to the nature, quality, and temperature, of each refpeetive
planet, and to the radiations and afpetls formed with them, or to the
dire8ions then operating ; for revolutions or tranfits of a beuevolen.t -
and ·friendly nature, falling in with good direCtions then operating,
will vitibly increafe their propitious quality, and greatly benefit the
n·ative; whilfr, on the other hand, revolutions or trao6ts of an evil de..
fignation, falling in with noxious_ and malignant direCtions, will in..
creafe the evil, or deftroy life. But good revolutions or traufits fallilJ!
in with bad direClious mollify-their malignancy; whiJft evil one~ oppofed
to good dirc8ions, leffen the good fortune then operating, and deprive
the native of the full completion of thofe golden advantages whi4:h per•
-haps appeared almofi within his·grafp.
To difcover the precife time when any event or direCtion lhaJI take
place in a r.evolutional 6gure, we direct the nve hykgiaeals. as in the
radix; always obferving, as it is for the year enfuing, to direct tbe te~Dot
porary progrefs of the zodiac for five bours forty-eight minutes. ,For ··
)oftance, fuppofe the cufp of the medium ccrli hath one deg1·ec of Gemioi,
that point is to be directed to every afpea that falls between that one de-
gree and twenty-four degrees of Leo; and alfo, if the afeendant hath at
abe fame time eight degrees of Virgo, it muft be direCted to all promit•
tor.s between that point and nine degrees of Scorpio, becaufe that point
will be upon the cufp of the afcendant for the cufuing year, and Leo
will occupy the mid-heaven. In like manner the Sun, Moon, and
Part of Fortune, muft be diretled unto their promittors, always remem-
Mring, ·that the difiance of a planet from the afcendaRt is foand by obo
lique afcenfion, and from she mid-heaven by right aken6on. Bu~ wbera
oac planet ·is direCted to another for the purpofc of akortaioing trandits.,
their diftanc·es from each other are found, by oblique a(cenfion' or dcfeeo-
. ion, under the po!e of tbat planet which is taken· for fignificator; .and
the dillance which is thus given by degrees moft be converted into tiaw,

Whether the direaions be radical or revolutional, the Table in the .

be added to February, and there will then be three hundred and fixty-
fix days in that year.
I have now completed every remark and every inftruCtion that is or
can be neceft'ary for the perfect Calculation of Nativities; and I am
bold to 'fay, that whoever will beftow fufficient time and application to
the rules I have laid down, and that will attend properly to the colla-
teral circumftances; will find no difficulty in obtaining a foreknowledge
of all material events relating 'to himfelf, or to any other perfon, whofe
r~l nativity is laid before him. I have, in the management of the
foregoing nativity of Mr. Witchell, been particularly plain and copious,
that no underftanding might go uninformed, as well of the fimplicity
and verity of the art, as of·its moral tendency to promote the good of
mankind, and the certainty with which human cvents11:Tlight be fought-
~ut through its meaus. •
Every thing I have fiated with refpefi to Mr. \Vitcheli's nativity is
incontrovertible faa. That gentleman, when in perfea health., and
in full vigour of mind, reforted to me for no other purpofe than to
hold difputations upon the rudiments of the fcience, and- to inform
himfelf as to its hypothefis, and probability in·the fcale· of reafon and
ii::ience. The more he inquired, the JDore convinced be was of pla-
netary influence and effea. He proceeded from theory~ praCtice. He .
amufed himfelf with a variety of difquifitions upon the different branches
of the art; and had the pleafure to find, that, in all cafes·where truth
and perfpicuity were the bafis of his inquiries, there were no in- '
frances of doubt or deception in the prediCtions refulting from them.
Well grounded in all the common departments of afironomy, he obtained
an extenfive theoretical knowledge of this par.t of it with the greater
facility; and, to reduce it to regular pra€tice, he began with calcu-
lating his own nativity. In comparing the afpeas w.ith· the particular
incidents of his life, he was foon convinced they were infeparable from
each other; and hence it was that be ~ommitted the .revifton and com-
pletion of it to my care, with a firm and manly folicitat.ion to have· t,~e
anaretical direCtion brought up and afcettained, as well as thofe offmaller·
magnitude ancl importance. This waa. a. ta~ l perfor-med with the

great~r fatisfallion, becaufe it was to undergo the fcrutiny of tbe $btl:
perfea mathematician of the age; and bccau~ his conviction and ap-
probation of it would fiamp new reputation upon &!.fcience, whicb~
having few or no real advocates, has been long boruo. .down by popular
prejudice and obftinate declamation: Having performed ·every part of
the calculation with an exa8itude that highly pleafed him, he ma®.
ufe of it as a friendly monitor of the good and ev~l that awaited the ro-
fidue of his days; and, when he approached towards the £lated time of
his diffolution, be would mention it without-the fmallell: emotion, -and
confidcred the knowledge of it as oue of the greatefl: bleffings of his
life, which not only drew his attention .to his Maker, and fixed kit
thoughts upon celefl:ial defires, but raifed his mind above the contctll•·
~ plati9n of earthly enjoyments, and gave ferenity and calmnefs to hir. ·
converfatiot~ and deportment. It was on one of thefe occalions, that
.he requefl:ed me to print his nativity in my work, which I had begun
. to publith fame little time before; obferving that the evidence of fo ·
·recent and refpe8able a proof of afl:rological prediClion might .tend to
bring mankind to r~afon, and admonith them no longer to abandon this
fublime ahd interefiing branch of knowledge. · ·.
And now, what need can there be of further argument in fupport of
fo felf-ev1dent a dotlrine? or what advantage could it poffibly be to
me, or to any dilint~refl:cd mau, to preach up the advantages of a fei-
ence which hath no exifl:ence in reafon or in truth? The fa.Cl.s here
laid down are unqueftiouable; and fuch, I think, as no reafouable man
will attempt to refute. If farther proofs are required, I 1hall at
·all ,times be ready to furnith them, or to explain any matter or thiug
.herein before \pid down that might be deemed unintelligible, or that
is not thoroughly underfl:ood; at the fame time that, if any obfiinate
unbeliever, or any other defcription of men, can offer a fair and candid

~~ndefcribable occurrences in human nature, which, for want of a more
clear cQmprehenfion of the wonderful works of creation, are frequently
attributed to caufes, which call in quefiion the benign attri~utes of the
Deity, and difgrace the underfianding of the meaneft of his creatures
upon earth. .
It hath been contended by fome, in oppofition to that part of alho-
Jogical dochine which determines the bodily form and mental difpo':"
fition of the native from the feveral lignificators in his own and in
his parents' genethliacal figures, that this Iikenefs or fimilitude in body
and temper is fiamped by the energy or idea of the parents in the aa o"f
copulation. Although I am wilting to admit this obfervation in part,
yet I contend that the primary caufe, which furniihes that energy or
motion in the parents, is derived from their refpeClive fignificators in
the heavens; and that they imprefs their particular quality in propor-
tion as they happen to be in dignity and power at that precife time. If
the fignificators of the mother are then fuperior in force and dignity,
the' mother's features and difpofition will be moft vifible ; if the fa-
ther's geniture be the frrongefi, the father's temper and fimilitude will
be mo£1: predominant in the offspring then begotten; but, if both their
fignificators are equally firong, the child then equally participates in
the likenefs and difpofition of both his parents. Let it neverthelefs be
remembered, that, however fl:rong the fignificators of both or either of
the parents might be, yet thofe proper to the fretus or conceptional
matter invariably take the lead, aud fiamp that peculiar form and tem-
perature upon the native, which in a great meafure fupplant the 6rft
impreffions given by thofe. of the parent, and form a perfon and mind
effentially differing from both, though with fome vefiiges of hereditary
fimilitude. And hence the reafon why fons and daughters more or lefs
depart from the fiature, features, complexion, and temper, of their
parents; and why no two human beings, in the whole compafs of ge-
neration, were ever yet formed precifely alike! If, therefore, the man
lives, who can fairly and completely refute this argument, he 1hall
have my thanks and my applaufe. And I will add further, in the em-
phatic words of an unrivalled author, that "My heart is already with
"him. 1 am willing to be converted. I admire his morality, and
" would gladly fubfcribe to the articles of his faith. Grateful as I am
"to the good Being whofe bounty has imparted to me this 'reafoning

OBSERVATIONS on the NATIVITY of the Rev. GEORGE
WHITEFIELD, M.A.
I a-tall now, agreeably to the plan ·I have before laid down, introduce,
by way of example, a number of remarkable genitures, in order to thow
that the afpeCls of the planets, and the influence of dire8ions, are uni·
formly and invariably the fame in all cafes, and corre8Jy difiinguiih thofe
extraordinary aClions in every native's life, for which he afterwards be-
comes celebrated and famous.
The well-known life and cbaraCler of the Rev. Mr. Whitefi.eld, and
his remarkable prowefs in the line he adopted, rendea· him no unfit '
fubjetl for our prefent purpofe. He waa born at the Bell inn~ in G Joucef..
ter, on the 16th of December, 1714-t as in t.heannexed plate of his geni·
ture. At a v~ry early period of his life he loft his. fath~r, and was left
unprovided for in the world. When he arrived at the age of ten years, his
mother again contraCted matrimony, which turned out very unhappy:
this is demonftrated by the mid-heaven coming at this time to a contra-
antifcion of the Moon; and, as both are fignificators of the mother, they
prefage much trouble and anxiety as well to her as to the native., At
fourteen he was taken from fchool, and affifted his mother in the bufinefs
of the inn; at which time the mid-heaven came 'to a quartile of ti!e
Sun, which always brings difgrace and trouble. His mother quitting
the inn, it was taken by his brother; and, his fifter-in-law and himfelf
not agreeing, they frequently fell out, and he would fometimes not
fpeak t<1 her for three weeks together. This fullen aull:ere temper is
produced in the radix of his birth by the quartile of the Sun aud
Mars; and, to complete the obfiinate pcrfeverance of his mind, the
Moon is in the conjuntlion of Saturn, which invariably produces fuch a
temperature.
In fifteen years and twelve days from his birth, the Moon came co
the tri~e of Venus, who is the fignificatrix of joy and pleafure. It is a
remarkably-good direCtion, by falling in the eleventh houfe, which do•
n9tes friends; and, .as Ven~s .is in the. third, it relatei to kindred and

Start-:journeys. Under thia direelion ,it was refolved to fit the native for
the univerfity; but he went on fome vifits of pleafure before he ~on..
figned himf~lf to the difcipline of a preparatory fchool. At the age· of
feventeen years and ooe hundlled:·and etghty-eight days, the Moon came
to. a bodily afpea with Mars~ ·This.diretl:ion hath an evil lignification,
bccaufe thcfe..two planets are ,by r1ature inimical to each other, as we have
already fufficiently thown; a~d it would have had a frill more malignant
inilueuce, had·not Venus at the {arne time cafi her trine afpeCl to Mars.
Under this direClioo he contratted au intimate acq~aintance with feveral
debauched ·:young gentlemen, who led him into a variety of fcrapes, and
.into the C<?mpany of proftituted females. ·
At about eighteen years of age he was received into the u'niverfity; for
which there came up a moll fignificant direCtion of the afcendant to the
trine. of Jupiter, which hath reference to preferment under the nobility,
clergy., rj:ligious focieties, .and fuch-like. Under this direction he was
chofen fervitor to feveral gentlemen of the Univerfity, whereby he con-
dueled his pecuniary affairs fo well, that he did not fiand his friends in
twenty-four pounds in three years. At the period of eighteen years two
hundred and fifty-fix days, the Sun came to the trine of Saturn ; under
which direClion the native abandons# the ~fiablilhed doClrines of the
church, and takes up the religious tenets of Methodifm, to the utter
afronifhment -and concern of all his relations and friends. At nineteen
years two hundred and forty-four days, the Sun again came to the trine
of Saturn; under which dire8ion the native more vigoroufly purfued
his religious principles, and became intimately acquainted with the
Rev. John Wefley, by whofe friendly advice and exemplary condutl, he .
ufed frequently to fay, ·'' he had been delivered from the fnares of Sa-
" tan."
At nineteen years one hundred and twenty-fix daya from the time of
birth, the mid-heaven came to the~ oppofition of Jupiter. At this
time many infelicities arife by means of clerical men. The native's
mind is tormented and oppreffed, and he is loaded with calumny and
coutempt'. He incurs- t·he difpleafure of the heads of his college; his
relations alfo confpire againft him., and his mind becomes a prey to per-.
· turbation and defpair. This laid the foundation of a violent fit. of fick-
nefs, which lafied upwards of feven weeks, whilft this direction
operated with its utmoft force; his life was fuppofed to be ·in danger,
and his ·enemies rejoiced ·in his affiitliou. At twenty years and two days,
~ ·Mooa · came··to- the .fextile of Mercury; under which favourabl4

dire8i0n he was reftored to health, and recovered his wonted ref~lution
and fpirits. ·
At twenty years and two hundred and eighty-fix days from his birth,
the mid-heaveu came to the tri1ie of Venus, which produced .him the
fincere regard of many perfons, with health and content, and profperity
in worldly affairs. Und.
er this dire8ion the native journeyed to Glou-
cefier, and foou afterwards to Briftol; in the coutfe of which he ex-
perienced many offices of friendiliip from thofe whom he had confidered
his enemies.· Lady Selwyn, of Gloucefi:er, .recommended ·him to the pa-
tronage of the biiliop, who immediately fent for .him, and offered to or-
dain him whenever he deflred ; and at the fame time prefented him with
five guineas. And the next direction coming up at twenty years three
hundred and fixty days from the time of birth, namely, on the 12th of
December, I 735, greatly increafed the good fortune promifed by the for-
mer; for, under the influence of this direCliou, Sir John Phillips .agreed
to allow him thirty pouuds.a-year. · ·
At twenty-one years and eighty-feven days, 14th. of March, 1736, the
afcendant came to the fextile of Venus. ·While this direction was ope--
rating, it gave the native a pleafant and agreeable time, full of profpe-
rity and content, with reputation and fuccefs in .his vocation ; fo that io
May following be was ordained. What renders this direClion more re·
markably propitious is, that ·-it~ fall$ ·in a 'good part of the horofcope,
and that Venus is no way affiitled. In Augufi: following be returned to
London.
When he was twenty-one .yea~s three hundred . ~nd forty days old, .i. e.
on the 22d of November, 1736, the Moon came by dire8ion to Spica
Virgi11is, a fixed ftar of the firfi magnitude. Fixed fiars of a benevo-
lent quality, in fuch conjunCtions, ufually denote fudden. honour and
preferment, and frequently bring men into higher repute than any lingle
erratic influence; but when mixed with planets of their own nature
and quality, they give durable reputation and profperi~y, as was
the cafe in the prefent inftance. At .twenty-two years and twenty•
four days from the birth, namely, on the 10th of January, 1737, the
Sun ·came to the trine of the Moon from the tenth houfe, the heufe of
.profeffional houour; and, as the Moon is fignificatrix of the mixed mul-
titude, or common people, it declares that the native lhould experience
an uncommon lhar.e of honour and refpea .from the middle cia~ of peO.
ple, which every one knows wa$ really the cafe, This afpecl likewi~

implies fome diftant journey ; and we ·
find that Mr. Whitefield now firfi:
formed ·his determination of going to America. Under this direCtion
the.native acquired great popular applaufe, as he hath declared himfelf;
and at this time he preached in the parilh-churches. On the 30th of
OClober following, the afcendanf came to the fextile of Venus, which
promifes fpccefs; and, by- reafon that fo many benevolent direCl:ions
followed fo clofely after one another at this junCl:ure, his fuccefs became
more rapid and confpicuous. On the xoth of December, the afcendant
came to the fe:xtile of Mars; and on the 28th of tbe fame month the
native embarked for Georgia. This direCl:ion brings him into the fociety
of military men, with whom harmony and attachment is moll: amply
denoted by the fextile afpect It likewife gives the native fuitable magna-
nimity, fortitude, and courage.
The next direClion is of a very dangerous and evil import; namely,
the medium creli to the body of Mars, which, genethliacally confidered,
fuddenly expofes a native to the mifchance either of life or fortune ; it
fi:irs up the wrath of powerful men againll: him, and excites his mind
to popular tumults and commotions. This was in an extraordinary man-
ner exemplified in the perfon of Mr. Whitefield ; for under this direCtion
he returned to England, landed at Brill:ol, and behaved with great arro-
gance to the chancellor of that diocefe; and afterwards infulted and re-
buked the Vice-chancellor of Oxford, and contemned his authority, with
that of all the other dignitaries of the church. He was now prohibited
from performing divine fervice in auy of the protell:ant churches ; in con-
fequence of which he commenced field-preacher, in the neighbourhood of
Kingfwood, near Brill:ol. In February I 739, the afcendant came to the
conjuoCl:ion of Mercury, at which time he was feized with a violent fever,
and continued very ill for upwards of fix weeks.
At twenty-four years and feventy-eight days from the native's birth,
March 5, 1739, the mid-heaven:came to the body of Mercury, ruler of the
tenth-boufe; fa that, notwithll:anding the oppofition and ceQfure he met
with, he was remarkably fuccefsful, and received great encouragement
from the-.populace, as this direCl:ion obvioufiy denotes. Under its opera-
tion he preached openly in Hlington church-yard, then in Moorfie)ds,
afterwards on Kennington Common, and at feveral other places. in the
open fields round LOndon. The novelty of his doCtrine and deport~ent
excited public curiofity, and the populace flocked to hear him from all
quarters. He colle8ed large fums of money daily, in the form of a fub-
fcription for building the Orphan Haufe in Georgia; for which purpofe

the trullees had granted him five ·hundred acres of land for ever. - This
direction likewife indines the native to travel ; aud under its influe.oce
he embarked for Georgia in Auguft, but returned to England again m
March 1741. ~ .
From the thirty-fecond to the thirty-fixth year of the native's age,.
there happened four remarkably-good directions~ viz. the Part of Fortune
to the conjunction of the Moon, the Sun to the fextile of Jupitcr,. the
Sun to the conjunCtion of Venus, and the Sun to the trine of Mars. UndeC"
thefe feveral dire8ions he confiderably increafed his fubfiance,. grew daily
into higher r~pute amongft h\s difciples, and pubJithed feveral tracts that
met with very great approbation. He likewife under this iuftuence
married the widow of an apothecary in Wales, with a fmalllanded.eftate.
On the 27th of June, ·x75i, the Sun came to the trine of Mars; under
which ditection he collected large fums of money, and completed his
tabernacle in Moorfields. ·
At the age of forty-two years and fixty-eight days, March 4, 175(, the
afcendant came to the quartile of the Moon, an.evil direCtion, prcf1lging
much mifchief. The native was now publicly molefted and abufed.by the
populace. He was driven from the chapel iu Long Acre with indignant
violence; and in feveral of thefe popular tumults he narrowly efcaped with
his life. He embarked for Ireland under the evil influence of this
dir.ection, where he in vain attempted to gain. profelytes.to his doctrine.
The populace were in a fuort time irritated againft him; and after •everal
fruitlefs efforts to fubdue the paffions and fpirits of his auditors,.and after
patiently enduring a copious iliare of infult and abufe, accompanied with
fome fevere chafiifement, he re-laoded in England, and came back to
purfue his fortune in London. . .
At the age of forty-two years two-hundred and·fifty-feven days, the mid-
heaven came to the fextile of the Sun, which is an afpecSt denoting much
good. Under this direction he found himfelf well received by the
populace; he refumed his former places of public declamation, and
went round the country, preaching in the open fields, or public ftrccts,
as bell fuited his purpofe. His colletlions upon thefe occafions .were
generally pretty liberal, particularly in places where his doarioe and
manner were novel, and he gained over many difciples. He returned
to·town, and under this ·benevolent direClion he built his chapel ·in Tot-
tenham-Court Road• .

At forty-five years one hundred and ~ighteen days from the time of
birth, viz. April I 7, 1760, the Moon ca~e to the quartile_af Venus.
This direction falls in the twelfth hpufe, aud is the forer\lnner of anguifil
and affliction. At this time Foote's .comedy of the Minor:made its ap-
pearance, which fo frigmatifed the native's charaCler, that he ocver got
the better of it. He devoted himfelf to the tafk of preaching it down,
and perfevered for a long while in this fruitlefS attempt; but the infult and
fatire of the populace was fo great, that be was under the neceffity of
withdrawing himfelf from the performance of divine fervice even in his
own chapels. At this time likewife many of his principal followers do-
ferted him, particularly a diftingui1hed lady, from whom he had received
very great fupport. This direction is immediately followed up by the
Part of Fortune to the oppofition of Jupiter, a baneful afpeet, which
_
came ~p the 2oth of May, 1760, and alfo declares a lofs of reputation and
fubfiance to the native. Under this direction feveral others of his moft
opulent difciples abandoned him, and the pecuniary cmolullleuts of his
chapels' were greatly decreafed. .
In September 1 764, the Part of Fortune came by direction to the
bodily afpect of Mars, which hath figuification of many violent con-
tentions between the native and his adherents about the loaves and
fi1hes; with lofs of property and refpea in'.confe'quence. The next
afpea came up the 5th of December following, that is, in forty-nine
years three hundred and fifty-three days from the time of birth, when
the mid-heaven, which reprefents the native's honour and reputation,
comes to the quartile of Venus in the twelfth houfe. This is a malignant
direflion, calculated to blaft the native's general charaCler, and to
produce fome fudden evil from a female quarter. Thcfe fucceffive di- ,
rections, being fraught with difappointments and infurmountable per- -
plcxities to the native, prepared his mind to feek an afylum in the more
grateful climes of America.
At fifty years one hundred and eighteen days from the time of birth,
the afcendant came to the conjunction of the Sun, and is then brought
to a quartile afpect of Jupiter, in an equally maligtiant radiation of the
Moon. The union of thefe afpeCts is extremely fingular, as is the
manner in which the hyleg and anareta are here brought together, by
the united force of the three co-operating malevolent direCtions, all of
which came up in September 1770, and deprived this celebrated charac•
ter ·of life, on the 18th day ofthat month, at Newbury, near Bofton, in

imagination with inexhauftible powers of reafoning; and, if we ·add to
the foregoing teftimonies, that Mars is configurated in his own tripli- ,
city, and Veous in her exaltation, we 1hall difcover the endowments of
a .mind apt for invention, with an impetuoftty of natural ideas fcarcely
to be equalled; which is frill more confirmed by the ftrength and good
afpect cafr by Mercury to the Moon, who rules the moifture of the brain,
and thereby fructifies and firengthens the retentive faculty. This pofttion
of the fignificators likewife gives the nativ~ a frrong tafte for fcientific
knowledge, impels him to the confideration of abftrufe and occult rea-
foning, and to the invefiigation of myfi:ical divinity.
It is however much to be lamented, that, in the midfi of all thefe
propitious configurations, Mercury happens to be in his detriment ; for
thereby it is declared, that thefe fplendid endowments will profit the
native little or nothing. And, as five of the fignificators are pofited in
watery figns, it is too obvious a proof that he will be regardlefs of repu-
tation and preferment, but wiJl give himfelf.up to the pleafures of con-
viviality, and facrifice too frequently at the thrine of Bacchus. This
failing is fo ftrongly marked, that furrounding fpeClators, whilfr they
admire the ~riUiancy of his wit, and the acutenefs of his underftanding,
will be equally furprifed that he thould not apply them to au ufeful and
advantageous purfuit.
Nature has fo endowed his rational intelletl', that he is alike qualified
for law, phyfic, or divinity; three avocations that perhaps few or none
befides himfelf can claim equal pretenfions to. Thefc extraordinary
9ualities are thus defined from the horofcopical fignificators : Venus
m the uintb boufe, in trine to Jupiter lord of the ninth, infpires h.im
\fith a confcientious mind, formed for divinity; Mars ii1 conjunction
,'Vth Mercury, gives him a depth of judgment and an acutenelS of rea-
foning fitted for the law ; and as Venus is in conjunCtion with Mars
and the Moon, at the fame time that Jupiter beholds Mars and Mercury
with a trine afpect, and Mars being lord of the tenth houfe, with the
Sun exalted therein, thefe are fo many deciftve arguments to 1how, that,
had the native been profeffionally bred to the law, he would not only have
acquired an immenfe fortune, but would have increafed likewife in re-
putation and character. That he would have made an excellent phyfi-
cian, is every way obvious: Jupiter, lord of the fixth, the houfe of
pharmacy and phyfic, is in Scorpio, a phyftcal fign, and is dignified in.
the fifth, the houfe of profperity and pleafure; and, beii1~. in partile
trine of Venus, and in trine alfo with his difpofitor, as well as in r~­
ception, at the fame time that he is forming a fextile afpect with Saturn,
lord of the feventh, thefe are evident demonftratio.us-of a perfon born

with.the heavenly art of healing ; ·and who, like the good Samaritan, not
only poffeffes the ability, but the difpofition likewife, of affording relief
to his wounded or afflicted fellow-creatures. ·
This native is not only .born with an extraordinary talent for either
of the foregoing ,profeffions, but hath, in a moil: eminent degree, the gift
of acquiring univerfal knowledge; poffeffing_ from nature a ftrong re-
tentive faculty, a quick and lively perception, and a fruitful genius, apt
for every kind of fiudy, and formed for invention. In fiature he is
but 1hort, as is defcribed by the Sun in Aries; brown hair, grey eyes,
full round features, and of a mild and placid difpofition; though given
to be fatirical upon the ladies, as is demonfirated by Mars being in con-
junction with Venus and Mercury in his detriment. ·
That the native might obtain preferment iu the church, is abundantly
evident, from the pofitions of fo many planets in his ninth houfc ; and
therefore an excellent profeffion for him to follow, provided he would
fum up re(olution to fet afide the diffipating rays of Mercury. I only
fubmit this as a friendly hint to the native himfelf, who being alive,
and poffeffing _the ability of analyfing his own geniture, and of fore-
feeing the different events that arc likely to refult from the direClions,
it is ~y duty to leave the confequences thereof as a proper monitor to
his future conduct, meaning to difplay the figure of his birth as'an ex-
ample only to my readers of the extraordinary circumR:ance of many
illufirious afpeets being deprived of perfect efficacy by one difcordant
configuration. -

This is the nativity of a pcrfon well known in tbe county of Kent;
a man who has a fii'Ong.natural propenfity to acquire knowledge, as is
proved by the Moon's pofition in the ninth boufe, the houfe of fdence,
in fe.aile to Mercury, in ·ber own dignities. The.fJgn Scorpio ake~d-

ing in the eaft, and Mars and ·Leo in trine of Venus in Aries, declare
him to be of a well-formed body, and of a middling ftature; of au open
generous difpotition, and- fair and jufi in all his ·dealings, which is parti-
cularly defcribed by Jupiter being in his own dignities, and in a good.
afpea with the Sun.
With regard to the native's fubfian·ce, if we confider his birth, we
lhall find it has increafed in a true proportion with what is promifed
by the fignificators in his genethliacal horofcope. ·The Part of For-
tune is well fituated in the fecond houfe; the Moon is likewif~ pofited
in her own houfe, increafing in light and motion; Jupiter, who is
lord of the fecond, the houfe of fubfiance, and difpofitor of the Part of
Fortune, is conjoined with the Moon's fortunate node ; and, having
dignities in the fifth and fixth boufes, prenotes that the native lhould
derive advantages from fuch things as particularly relate to thofe .
houfes which are fully explained in page I 45, &c. hut, as thefe figni-
fi.cators are all of them either in fiery or watery figns, it is apparent that
fuch occupations as are more immediately under the government and
coutroul of thofe figns would be found moll: profitable for the native to
follow. ·
. We · might eafily perceive that this native is not of a clofe and fordid
difpofition, owing principally to the remarkable configurations of the
.. Moon in quartile of Venus, in fextile with Mercury, and within orbs of
an oppofition of Saturn. The force of thcfe predominant qualities,
while under the particular direCtion of each refpeClive afpea, will in-
cline the native to be profufe, and carelefs about money-matters; will
expofe him to the impofition of the crafty and defigning, and eventu-
ally to the lofs of property, and the diminution of his fubfrance, unlefs a
great degree of fpirit . and refolution be exerted, to modify and correCt
this good-natuted but fatal propenfity. . A hint to the wife is ufually
fufficient; and, as this native is frill living, and extenfively furrounded
with friends, I would by no means wilh to hurt his feelings, or draw
down upon myfelf the refentment of thofe who might have it in coutem-
, plation to take advantage of his generofity.
.
But to return. The third houfe is the houfe of journeys; and here
we find ~he malevolent planet Saturn retrograde.' This is a furc argu·
.ment, that change of refidence, and journeys in general, lhould prove un-
fuccefsful and injurious to the native, either in the pocket or by bodily
affliCtion, or both, and thould therefore be avoided as much as poffible.

The fourth houfe bears d~fignation of the prinCipal tcope -and end of
the native's life. In this angle we find the fixed fign Aquaries; and,
as Saturn is pofited in that fign, it is an argument that fome ·houfes or
land fhould devolve to the native by hereditary fucceffion; but Saturn
being retrograde fhows that this patrimony thall not be poffeffed until
the native is far advanced in years, or in the latter fiage of his life.
The fifth houfe denotes advantages to be obtained, or Jolfes to be fuf-
fered, by any fpeCies ofadventure; and, as the Moon's fortunate node faJJs
in this houfe, it is apparent that the native thould in a general way be
fortunate upon every fuch oqcafion, as cards, dice, hazard, dealing in
the lottery, or fending goods upon the chance of a market to any of our
fettlements or connetlions abroad. I have no doubt but this pofition of
the dragon's bead, conjoined with the benevolent planet JupiteJ:", who
is lord of the fecond houfe, the houfe of fubfiance, and bears rule like-
wife over the fifth, which relates to adventure, would prove extremely
favourable to the native, were he to try his fortune in the lottery; more
efpecially if he would be careful to choofe his ticket under a favourable
and correfponding revolution or direcHon, many of which are to be
found in his nativity. " ·
With regard to ficknefs or difeafe, and the accidents which are likely
to be moll fatal~ to the native, we 1ha11, if we regard the fixth houfe,
and the planets bearing con6guration therewith, eafily difcover of what
kind and quality they fha11 be. If we ;carefully confult the figure, we
1hall find that choler is the moft .predominant humour in the native's
confiitution; and that the effetls of fire and air thall be mofi: offenfive
aud injurious to him; and for thefe very fubfi:antial reafons; namely,
becaufe we find a fiery fign occupies the cufp of the fixth houfe, with
Jupiter, who governs the fiery triplicity, and he is pofited therein.
Jupiter likewife beholds the Sun with a friendly ray, and thereby
ftre~gtbens his quality, becaufe the Sun bears rule over the fame tri-
plicity, and is pofited in an airy fign in the eighth houfe. We find alfo
an airy fign upon the cufp of the twelfth houfe; and Mars, the lord
of this native's afceudant, hath his feverifh quality much increafed,
by being pofited in a fiery fign; and, as this malefic beholds -Venus
with a trine afpea in the fixth, at the fame time that the is a lady of the
twelfth, and in quartile to the Moon, it renders that otberwife-benefic
planet inimical to the native's conftitution. Thefc teftimonies all con-
fpirc to 1how, that the native fhould be more than ordinarily fubjeCl
to bot and feveri1h complaints, and to accidents from violent falls and
bruifes.

Accordiag to thefe pofit ions of the planets, and to the directions
wherewith their afpeCls are feverally brought up, will the infirm.itiC$-
and misfortunes of this native be refpectively found. At about eigh,.,
teen years of age, namely, when Venus perfeCted her mundane paraUd.
with the Sun and Mercury, he was affliCted witb a long and violc:nt in-
termittent fever. At twenty-four, years of age, he had another violent
fever, which produced the rneafies. This was brought on by the baJc-
ful configuration of Saturn in oppofition of Mars, lord of the afceod4tlt ;: '
and was fo powerful and violent, owing to Saturn being in his QW.n boule,.
and corning at the fa~e time to a mundane parallel of Mars, that no.pe~··
fon whatever expected his life; nor could he 'have furvived, fo f~v.ere au
attack, had the hylcgiacal and amu,etical ftars been united in the configu-
ration, to the want of which we can alone attribute the prefcrvatiou,and:
continuance of the native's life.
' .
At the age of thirty-four years and three months, the native i$. ~gain
attacked with a violent fcorching fever, which nearly. abforbed. all the .
humours of ·his body, aud auqihilated the blood and anim.~l juiqes.
This was produced by a joint and moll: remarkable oppofi~ion, of the.
Sun aud Jupiter to the afcendant; whereby Jupiter partakes of the con-
fuming heat and violence of th~ Sun, be.ing .in fextile af~ . ~itb him,
in the fiery fign Aries, in the fix~h houfe; at the fame time. that the Sun, .
~ing in the airy fign Gemini, in the eighth, is mofr apt to .corrupt the,.

•t is apparent 1h~ cannot afford that eminent profperity and unimpeded
fuccefs the otherwife might do. It is however pretty obvious that the .
native's advancement in life is not to be ranked amongfi the mofi inconfi-
derable; and that his fuccefs, .in the department of pbyfic and chemifiry,
1hould neither be difreputable nor unprofitable. Mars pofited in the
mid-heaven, out ofall his effential dignities, ·generally declares the riative
to be violently paffionate and raili ; but here we find his hafiy temperature
cooled by the mild trine of Venus, which meliorates the native's difpofi-
tion, and induces him to be more gentle and kind.
In the eleventh houfe we find the unfortunate node of the Moon, com-
monly called the Dragon's Tail, which implies hypocritical enerpies and
perfidious friends. Of tbefe · I make no doubt but the native has had
ample experience; and therefore, from what has already come to pafs,
I would admoniili him of the future; being convinced, fi'Om this pofition
of his geniture, that no part of his life will be exempted from the at-
tacks of thofe a1failants. This pofition of the malefic node likewife de.-
clares that the native 1hall fuffer great difappointments in his pecuniary
hopes and expeClations. (He was a bankrupt in Jan. I 78z, at which
time he refided at W althamfiow in Effex.)
· The twelfth houfe relates to p!Jblic enemies, imprifonment, and great
cattle. Venus being lady thereof, pofite_d in the fixth, in oppofition, de-
clares the native 1hall be unfuccefsful in any.dealings in cattle; at the
fame time it difcovers his profeffed enemies to be in too abject a fituatioat
to do him much injury. As to imprifonment, ~here does not appear to
be the leaft apprehenfions of; but that the native wiU live in profperity
dur~ng the remainder of .his d~ys, and yield up the gh~ft upon the bed
of l1berty, full of years, and am1dft the good ·offices of hit fraends, I am
bold to affirm, from the coufuleration of thofe celtftial intelligencers that
have never yet deceived me. .

The Part of Fortune unluckily falls in cohjuntlion with Saturn. and
Venus; and as Saturn is pofitcd in a fign out of all his. dignities, and is
the lord alfo of the eighth houfe, his influence is implicative of certain
ruin by means of wicked and debauched women, defcribed by Ven\ls,
conjoined to the worft rays of Saturn. 'This confi:ruCl:ion is ~bundantly
confirmed by the confritutiou of the hylegiacal and anaretical places of
the figure, and the difpofitiou of the tignificators by which they are
refpcttively irradiated. The afcendant, in this horofcope, mull: be
.;ontidered as hyleg, .or giver of life, fince neither the Sun, Moon, nor
Part of Fortune, is fo polited in the geniture, as to entitle eithe~ of
them to the. pte-eminence; and it is the peculiar quality o/ the afcen-
dant, otcnpied by Gemini, and governed by Mercury, tG ftamp upon
the n~tive fo early and fo extraordinary a turn for literary purfuit~ ; which
are too well eftablifhed to need any other proof, than that they were com-
municated to the· intelleClual faculty by this conftrutlion of the hyleg
and circumambient matter at the time of birth.
We are here Jikewife to remark, that Saturn is the anareta, or de-
thayer of life, and is poftted in the moll: noxious pofition that could
· have happened, and where he ufually prenotes the fatal commiffion of
fuicide, without fo much as one friendly ray to oppofe his influence, or
to rend.er the 1hocking attempt partial, or lefs deftruCl:ive than a caufe
that will certainly touch life. On the contrary, here is a concatenation
of evil: rays, which in a remark~ble man~er contribute to a premature
death. The Sun and Moon are m oppofit1on to houfes that are under the
influence of the worfr caufes of death; and, as Venu9 is in conjunction
with Saturn, who rules thefe evils, and draws them as it were within the
focus of her own orb, it is evident that his death would come by his own
hand, under the preffure ofdefpair, heightened by meagre want, through
the perfid>:" of fome abandoned female. ·
If we inquire minutely into the life of this unfortunate man, we
1hall find every atlion and prediCtion of the ffars, wh.ich .were the im-
prdfors at his birth, fully and completely verified. He was boru·of no
very difringui1hed parents, and received but a fmall thare ·of daffical
education; yet his produtlions, at a very early period, were fuch as
excited the admiration of the firfi fcholars of his day, and proved him
to inherit great natural ability and genius; infomuch that Mr. Wharton,
in his additions to his Hifrory of Poetry, vol. ii. hath taken occafion to
obferve,."' that Mr. Chatterton had given a fingular infrance of prematu-
" rity of abilities, and that he had acquired a ftore of general information

"far. exceeding his years; that he poffeffed a comprehenfion ofmind,.and
"aCtivity of underfianding, which predominated over his fituation in
"life and his opportunities of infiruetion." But notwithfianding he was
1hus gifted, and poffeffed fo eminent a 1hare of frerling fenfe, yet he com~
bined with it all the vices and irregularities of youth ; and his profligacy
was at leafi as confpicuous as his abilities.
Finding himfelf encompaffed with private enemies, furrounded with
the evils of poverty, and defiitute of every means of fubfifience, he quit-
ted Brifrol, to try his fortune in the metropolis. Having fixed himfelf
in private lodgings, he {ought for bread through the meditlf.l of. his li-
terary talent, which falling ihort of his expeCtations, as well as of his
merit, he moft unfortunately fell into the hands of the lower order of
profi:itutes, by whom he was duped, difeafed, and finally deferted! In
this deplorable lituation he continued a few months, occafionally
drudging for the bookfellers'!' who neither having the generofity to re-
ward him as he deferved, nor fpirit to advance upon the credit of his
, future produCtions, he at length, oppreffed with poverty and difeafe,
and overcome by defpair, put an end to his exifi:ence, in the month of
Augufr, 1770, by a dofe of poifon, which he prepared with his own
hand.
Jf we tonfider the quality of the dire~ion which produced his death,
we 1hall find the manner of it moll: aptly defcribed in his figure of birth.
Saturn thus configurated with Venus, in th~t particular part of the hea..
vens, and under fuch noxious irradiations, hath at all times, as well by
Ptolemy as by every other refpeCtable profeffor of thi~ fcience, been found
to occafion death by poifon; and {o many concurrent tefi:imonies in the
houfe· of ficknefs and difeafe bear the frrieteft affinity thereto; and this
fatal direCtion is much fi:rengtbened by coming up with the revolution of
Saturn. ·
Mr. Chatterton, notwithfi:anding his foibles, and his want of a more
fcholafi:ic education, was neverthelefs a benevolent man, and a good
fcholar. He certainly laboured hard, and combated many obfracles, in
his literary attainments; but his fuccefs was great; and, had he been
born to _great profperity, and under the influence of milder ftars, he
had been an ornament to the age in which be lived, and an honour to Jlis
country. I have many reafons to believe, that his knowledge of the
uranical part of All:ronomy had enabled him to forefee, by his own
geniture, the evils he bad to combat, and the fatal termination of a
· life,

life :which .his own folly bad rendered infuppprtab14 i ·but which an op-
pofite couduCl', and a more manly refolution, migh~ . confd1Cdlv have re-

in nature, which nothing but the rational means made u(e of by Heze-
kiah (2 Kings;·.chap. x:x:.) can alleviate or prevent; namely, unfeigned
prayer, and a determined fpirit to abandoD the allurements of vice, and
to walk perfeCt jg the ways of God and. Truth; which v~rifies the an-
cient proverb, that wife men n~k the flarJ, and tJone bt~t 1h1 tiddy and the

AN IL·LUS.TRATIO·N
This unfortunate man -refided in Brifi:ol. He contraCled an intimacy
wit~ a female, and lived with h~ io the cJofeft babi~s. of th.e fe-'es, uotil'
they had feverat children. _ At length difagreements S:rbfe, in ·confequence
of his refuting to marry her, and., violent quarrel feparated them. The
woman immediately attached herfelf to another man, to whom 1he was
thortly after married, totally forfaking her former conneCtion. ';rhe na-
tive, enraged at the circumfi:ance, took frequent opportunities of way-
laying and rem<?nftrating with het: ; of claiming a prior right to her
perfon, and of iufifling on having familiarity with her whenever be pleafed;
but 1he rejeaed him with contempt, and -threatened profecutiou when-
ever he attempted to force her. . ·
Hurt at this repulfe, and exafperatc;d at t~e indifference with which
he was treated, be took an opportunity of·watching tb~ huiband from
home, who, being a labouring man, went early to his wott:.; upon which
the native maae his way into the bGJafe, went up-ftairs, ari-d found the .
wife in bed. Demanding familiarity with her, he was refufed, with
fevere refteClions on the metho~ he had,takcn.tf;l,get into he_
rbed,;.cbamber.
He then drew his knife, and, with a degree of inbumaR barbarity better
conceived than expreffed, threw hi.melf upon tbe bed, and cut her
throat from ear~ ear. · · ·
The alarlll was ~oon given, and the~ -cry_of in.nocent.blood became
general. The culpr1t was feiud, ex~med, and co~tted to New-
gate for trial. He ther:e aff-oCled-:to thow marks of infanity, and for fome
confiderable time before the affifes was,·generally believed to have per-
petrated the bloody aCt in a pa~m of madrtd!, which was now be-
come vifible in all his words and a8ions. His friends availed them-
felves of this circumftance to palliate his guilt, and took every ftep to
improve the· a.dv.antage againfi: the ·day of trial, when ;it \vas generally
believed that he would be acquittol. Ditfer~t J>arties~ how~er, had
taken Up the matter 011 different grounds ; and it Wall at laft aveed, by
fome geRtleMCn of -refpeClability in:.Brifi:oJ, that I Thould be r~quefi:ed
to infpeOl his nativrty, and to give illy judgment' whether he would be
found galty -or acq_uitted. I readily accompanied the gentleman to
· Newgate, ancl obtained the eftimatecJ time of the prifoner's birt~ which
I reai6etl .by the method heretofore aid down, .and. foun<l the lignifica-
.tors of his na:rivity difpofed as. in the foregoing borofcopica1 figure, which
I thus explained. . . · ·

piter, decJares that the native 1hall be involved .in .an abyfs of troubles
and ·affliCtions, even to the hazard of his life. As to temper and pr~
penfity of the will, he. is ralh, violent, ·and arbitrary; unll:able in 'his
purfuits, and ufually difappointed in his expeCtations. This is denoted
by the oppofition of Jupiter to Mercury; but the quartile of Mercurv
with Mars, particularly when Mercury is confiituted principal fignificator,
hath implication of high crimes and mifdemeanours, and ufually produces
violent contention, affaffination, murder, rapine, robbery, and bloodthed,
as we have more particularly delineated, in p. 2 I 9, 220.
Upon a further infpeCtion of the figure, we find a baneful'quartile
afpea of Mars and Jupiter, with a mifchievous oppofition of Saturn
and Mars. To the firfi of thefe we are to attribute the dilfolute man-
ners of the native, fince it influenced his mind to thofe immoral habits,
which eventually lead to perfidioufi1efs aild treachery; whilfi the fecond
configuration not only confirms thefe vices, but thows that they will be
the means of his death. Here is unquefiionably a favourable trine
of the Sun and Saturn; but no great good can refuJt from it, becaufe
.the Sun is lord of the twelfth houte, pofited in the tenth, out of all his
effential dignities; at the fame time that Saturn is lord of the fixth, lo-
cated therein, and both the fignificators are under the dominion of the
roil genii, vitiating the mind and affeCtions of the native, ·and tending to
an ignominious and premature end. .
At the time the unhappy native was prompted to commit this bar-
barous aa, the Moon came to an oppofition of Mars by direa direClion,
while the occupied the cufp of the feventh houfe, which reprefents the
unfortunate woman; and the quiilrtile of Jupiter lord of th_
e fourth, with
Mercury lord of the afcendant, hath defignation ofthe native,· and points
out the fatal connection betwixt them.
Having confidered fo much of the horofcope, it was my next care to
afcertaiu the hylegiacal and anaretical fl:ars, and the particular influx
Bowing from them. The Sun I find to be giver of life, pofited in the
tenth houfe, the houfe of jufiice; Mercury lord of the afcendant, being
it1 Gemini, an airy fign, and the Moon likewife in an airy fign, .lhow the
manner of the native's death, that he would die fufpended in the air; while
the oppofition of four planets in the radix, and the mundane quartile of
the Sun and Mars, from the tenth, the houfe ofjufiice, ihow the quality
of it, namely, that it thould be in due courfe of law, by the hands of the
common hangman, and not by fuicide. ·

The tignificators' of juftice likewife, ·confidcred judicially from their
rcfpeClive pofttions in relation to each other, give no profpca whatever
of favour from the judge, nor~of any effetl:ual interpo6tion after convic•
tion; fo that I made no fcruple to affirm, that notwitbftaoding the hopes
that had .been formed of faving the native's life by pleading his infanity,
and the number of perfons who appeared anxious to ferve him, yet all their
endeavours would prove abortiYe, fince he would certainly be found guilty,
and fuffer the fentence of the law in confequence. ·
It would be needlefs here to relate how much this prediClion was
ridiculed by all degrees of people in Briftq}; or with what contempt
my opinion was treated by moft of the poor man's friends: and it was
with fome difficulty I could pafs without ir,if\tlt. I was determined,
however, to place my judgment in a more firiki'hg point of view. The
affifes were not fi»ed, nor could any perfon Utldertake to fay when they
would be, much lefs afcertaiu the day of the native's trial. I therefore
brought up the dire8ion of death with great nicety and precifion, and
found he would be plunged into eternity when the Sun came to the
anaretical point in the midbeaven, aud met the noxious beams of the
Moon and Mars in oppofition, which, thus conftituted, is ever produc-
tive of a violent death. Thofe, who will tak~ the pains to equate this
dircaioo, will find the content of its arch to be twenty-feven degrees
thirty-four minutes, which, turned into time, and reckoned from the
hour of birth, will be found to come up on the eighth day of April, 1785,
and gives the fpace of life twenty·fix years, nine montbs, and fome
odd days, which exaCtly anfwerc:d to the native's age. I then publicly
declared, notwitbftanding the popular clamour was fo much againfi: me,
that the prifoner would fuffer on the above day; and, as the affifes were
not fixed, no one could charge me with having drawn my couclufions from
the probable event of the day of trial.
When the folemn hour arrived, every one appeared anxioufiy intereft.
ed in the event ; and the utmofi exertions were ufcd to fave the unfor-
tunate prifoner from the fate impending over him-but in vain! . After a
long and indulgent trial, the jury pronounced him guilty, and he fuffered
the law, as thoufands can teftify, on the very day I bad predi8ed.
And here let me juft remark, that this geniture not only points out,
by the confiitution of the Moon and Mercury in airy figns. that the na·
rive would be hanged ; but Mars being in quartile to the Sun, who is
giver of life, and upon his afcendant, defcribes the circumflance of his
diffeCiion, as may be feen by the rules already laid down in the former
part of this work.

. This geniture befpeaks a female of a 1harp wit, and lively di(pofition~
Mars is lord of the afcendant, pofited in Virgo, the exaltation of Mer-
cury, but in no afpeCt with any planet in the heavens, confequently the
faihion and temperature of the native will be formed principally of Mars;
who, as we have feen before, produce~, whetl in Virgo, a middling fta-
ture, inclining to brevity, hot and fiery temper, raih and invincible in
all difputes, and ungovernably violent in hafry quarrels, yet foon ap-
peafed by good nature and fubmiffion, which at all times induce her to
Le traCtable and indufrrious, and for the moll: part fober and frugal.
Her features are defcribed to be thin and pale, occafioned by the Moon's
conjunction with Venus; yet of a pleafing and agreeable vifage, owino-
to the influx of the beams of Venus, who is the author of beauty. But~
by reafon that Venus is in her fall, the fymmetry of features will be
proportionably deranged; and, as Saturn, the author of deformity, be-
holds both the Moon and Venus with a fextile ray, it becomes evident
that the native could only be moderately handfome. The mixture of
thefe fignificators gives her brown hair, and great volubility of fpeecb,
from whicb great inconveniences arife, and fomet imes loffes and inju-
ries; as is particularly denoted by the reception of Mercury and Mars,
and the conjunction of Saturn with Mercury in the twelfth, the houfe of
private enemies.
This nativity might be clalfed amoug£1: thofe of a mean and obfcure
·defignation, fince we find no one planet through the whole horofcope
elfeutially fortified, except Mercury and Mars, and that is only by recep-
tion, which, from the conftitution of their places, declares good by evil
means, with a difpofition to low and vulgar purfuits. And here it may
not be improper to remark, that, whenever we firid the planets, in any
nativity, out of all their effential digni~ies, we might fafely conclude, that
their effeCts will in no lhape be remarkable or extraordinary, and that
the native will lead generally a mean and obfcure life. _·
That this perfon ihould live to years of maturity, is abundantly evi-
dent from the confiitution of her horofcope; as well as that the would
enter into the rnarriage-fiate. Venus and Mercury, in this figure, give
teftimony to the hufband, who is defcribed by Jupiter, in twenty de-
grees of the afcendant, under the government of Saturn; fo that it
was very improbable,- if not impoffil>le, that the native wou,ld- marry
young, .becaufe Saturn is above the earth, conjoined with the fignifica-
tor of her hufuand, and declares the would not enter iuto that ftate at
leafr' under thirty years. In fact, there is but one direCliou within that
period, that could poffibly have brought it to pafs; and that came up

when ·fbe Wll8 only about twelve yea~ .old, iO that its $fe6l pafi"ed oif in
bcr minority, without producing any fco6ble operatiotl. The diretlion -
which perfe8ed her marriage came up when 1he was thirty~oQe ye~
three months and eleven days.old, namely, on the filth of Febf:uary, 178o,
-when Venus came to tbe trine of Jupiter; as appears by the followiog
'G&lculation:

Which, added to the right .afcenfion of the Sun, and·wrned into -time,
as before pointed out, produces exaaly thirty-one year-s, three month$,
and elewn days.
Upon a further inveftigation of the horofcope, we thall find that Mars
-is not only 'lord of the afcendant, but hath fole dominion over the fifth
and twelfth houfes, which prefagcs that kind or ·fpecies of evils to tbe
native as are ufually produced in thofe- particular pofitions of the hea-
vens. The twelfth houfe being the houfe of affliction, and Mercury
and Mars in recep_
tion therein, it declar~s the native tball prove in many
refpetls her own enemy; and, as Mercury is in conjunflion with Saturn,
who likewife communicates au influx of malefic rays to Venus and the
Moon, whereby they participate of his quality and nature, in the fign
Scorpio, which rules the fecret parts, it evidently de~onftrates great
and imminent danger to the native by child-bearing. And the Sun being
in the eleventh houfe, oppofed to the fifth, which is the houfe of chil-
dren, and being likewife the anareta, or defiroyer of life, it evidently .
· proves that the native's death tball arife from child-birth; and fo it really
happened; for foon after being delivered of her fifth child, in the thirty-
ninth year of her age, the was fuddenly fei.zed, and died in a few hours,
on the I 3th ofAugufi, I 787.
The direBion under which the died, is the Moon, which is apheta, '
or giver of life, to the' conjuutlion of the Sun in the eleventh houfe;
at which exact _
time Venus came to the fame anaretical point, and Mars,
lord of the afcendant, to the twelfth houfe, where the malefic rays of
Saturn and Mercurv contribute their baneful influence; all which couti-
dered together, det;ote, in the moft remarkable and decifive mann~r, a
child-bed death to the native.

Many other confid.:rations might be adduced from this geniture ;
but, as the·only proof we with to efiablifu is to fuow, according to na-
tural caufes and effecb, the certainty with which .the time and· manaer
of death might be afcertained by the force and influx of the ambient
and elementary matter, prefcribed by the Jaws .and motions of the:hea...
venly bodies, it would be deviating from our plan, and prove deroga-
tory to the good fenfe of the reader, to dwell longer upon fubordinate
{peculations.
It may not, however, be unentertaining to the fiudent, were he to com-
pare the configurations formed by the planets in thi.s horofcope, and the
particular influx of their refpecHve beams, with thofe general rules and
obfervations heretofore laid down, for the purpofe of afcertaining the
quality of death. The wonderful harmony, order, and precifion, with
which the heavenly bodies operate upon this fublunary world ; the unifor-
mity with which the fame caufes are found to produce the fanae effects;
and the certainty with which the time and manner of human diffolution
is fought out by them, will at once infpire the mind with the mofi elevated
ideas of the omnipotence of God, and lead the .foul to tbofe divine con...
.templations, which_

cannot be unentertaining, nor uni'!l'por~ant, to illuftratc_, by his nativity,
the extraordinary endowments of hts mmd.
But, before I fpeak of the conll:itution and quality of his genitware, it will
- not be amifs to introduce the reader to a nearer acquaintance with this
celebrated author., which I thall do by quoting his own .accoutlt of him-

B~ron Sattdenborg's Anfwer to a Letterfr~m a Friend, printedin m.r Preface

I take pleafure in the friendfuip you exprefs for me in :YDUr letter,
and return you thanks for the ·rame; but, as to the pratfas!therein, I
confider them as belonging to the truths contained ·in my .w.riings, and
fi> refer them to the Lord our Saviour as his due, who is in himfelf the
Fountain of all Truth. It is the concluding part :Df your letter that
chiefly engages my attention, where you fay as follows: "As ·after your
" departure from England difputes may arife on the fubjea of your
" writings, and fo give occaflon to defend their author againft fuch falfe
" reports and afperfions as they who are no friends to truth ·may invent'
" to the prejudice of his charatter, m~y it not be ·of ufe, in order to
" refute any calumnies of that kiud, that you leave behind you fomc
"1hort account of yourfelf, as concerning, for example, your degrees
" in the univerfity, the offices you have borne, ·your family and con-
" nec9:ions, the honours which I am told have been conferred upon you,
" and fuch other particulars as . may terve .to the vindication of your
" charatter, if attacked; that fo any ill-grounded p'r.ejudices may be
" obviated or removed? For, where the ho.uour and intereft of truth are
" concen~ed, it certainly beho-.es us to employ all lawful means in its de-
" fence and fuppGrt." After reflec9:ing on the foregoing paffage, I was in-
ducea to comply wnh your friendly advice, by brieRy communicating the
following circumfiances of my life. · ·
· I was born at Stockholm, in the year .of our Lord 1'689, Jan. 29.
My father's name Jefper Swedberg, who was Biiliop of Wefirogothia,
aud of celebrated charatler in his time. He was aifo a ··Member of
the Society for the Propagation of the Gofpe1, formed on the model of
that in England, and appointed Prelident of the Swediih Churches iq

and Germany; and returned home·in 1714. In the year 1716, and after- ,
wards, 1 frequently converfed with Charles XII. King of Sweden, who
was pleafed to befiow on me a large thare of his favour; and in._lhat year.
appointed me to the office of Affdfor in the Metallic College, i,u which
effice I continued from that time till tbe year 1747, when I quitted
the office, but frill retain the falary annexed to it as an appointment for
life. The reafon of my withdrawing from the bufinefs of that employ-
ment was, that 1 might be more at liberty to apply myfelf to that
new function to which the Lord had called me. About this time .a
place of higher dignity in the ftate was offered me, which I declined to
accept, left it thould prove a fi1are to me. In I 7I 9, I was ennobled
by Queen Ulrica Eleonora, and named Swedenborg; from which time
I have taken my feat with the Nobles of the Equefirian Order, in the
Triennial Affemblies of the States. I am a Fellow, by invitation, of
the Royal Academy of Sci~nces at Stockbolm.; but ~ave never defir~d 1~1;
to be of any other commumty, as I belong to: the S~~ m..\d' ~ ·1 I{(~
which things fpiritual and heavenly are the oi1ly fubjects of difcourfe /
and entertainment~ whereas in our literary focieties the attention is
whollY_ ~_:~!te~ \JP ~'Y.itb..thiug.s-.re.J.ajjy_e~ to the body and thia wor!4. In the
year I 734 I publiihed the Regnum Minerale, at Leipfic, in three volumes
folio; and in 1738 I took a journey into Italy, and ftaid a year at Veuice
and Rome.
With refpetl to my family..connetlions; I had four filters. One of
them was married·to Eric Benzelius, afterwards promoted to the Arch..
biihopric of Upfal; and thus I became related to the two fucceeding
archbilhops of that fee, both named Benzelius, and younger brothers
of the former. Another of my fifters was married to Lars BenzeHl:ierna,
who was promoted to a provincial government; but thefe are both dead.
However, two biihops, who are related to me, are fiill living: one of
them is named Filenius, Bithop of Oftrogothia, who now officiates as
Prefident of the Ecclefiaftical Order in the General Affernbly at Stock..
holm1 in the room of the archbithop, who is infirm; he married the
daughter of my fifi:er; the other, who is named Benzelll:ierna, Biihop
of \Vefiermannia and Dalecarlia, is the fon of my fecoud fifier; not to
mention others of my family who are dignified. 1 converfe freely, and .
am in friendthip, with all the bithops of my country, which are Len in
number, and alfo with the fixteen fenators, ,and the reft of the grau-.
·dees, who love and honour me, as knowing that I am in fellowlhip with
angels. The king and queen themfelves, as .alfo the three princes
their Cons, thow me all kind countenance ; and I wa.s ouce ipvited to eat

Whatever of worldly honour and advantage may appear to be in the
things before-mentioned, 1 hold them as matters of low efiimation, ·
when compared to the honour of that facred office to which the Lord
himfelf hath called me, who was gracioufly pleafed to manifefi himfelf to
me,' his unworthy fervant, in a perfonal appearance, in the year I 743; to
open in me a fight of the fpiritual world, and to enable me to converfe
with fpirits and angels ; and this privilege has been continued to me
to this day. From that time I began to print ahd publiih various un-
known arcana, that have been either feen by me, or revealed to me, con-
cerning heaven and bell; the ftate of men after death; the true. worihip
of God; the fpiritual {enfe of the Scriptures ; and many other im-
portant truths tending to falvation and true wifdom: and that mankind
might receive benefit from thefe communications, was the only motive
which has induced me at differe1.1t times to leave my home and vifit other
countries. As to this world's wealth, I have fufficient; and more I nei-
ther feek nor wifu for.
Your letter has drawn the mention of thefe things .from me, in cafe,
as you fay, they may be a means to prevent or remove any falfe judg-
ment or wrong prejudices with regard to my perfonal circumfiances.-
Farewell; and I heartily wiih you profperity both in things fpiritual and
temporal, of which I make no doubt, if fo be you go on to pray to our

London, 1769. EMAN. SWEDENBORG.
Upon the horofcope of this eminent perfon there are four planets
effentially dignified, viz. Saturn, lord of the afcendant; the Moon, lady
of the feventh; Mercury, lord of the fifth and eighth; and Mars, lord
of the third and tenth; with Jupiter on the afcendant. Thefe are in-
fallible tefiimonies, not only of an high and exalted mind and chara8er,
but of a devout and exemplary life. Venus and the Sun appear .to
give but little of their qualities in the temperature and ~onfiitution
of the native; firfl:, becaufe the Sun is fixed in his detriment upon the
cufp of the afcendant ; and, fecondJy, becaufe' Venus is pofited out of
all her fortitudes and dignities; and hence. we find no 'trait in the life

and aClions of the native which. defcribes his having formed any con-
neCtion with the fofter fex, or his h~ving beeh at any time fiimulated with
thofe unconquerable delires for connubial eujoyments which thofe only
who have Venus firongly dignified in their genitures are qualified to
explain. '
_up01i the afcendant we find fixteen degrees of the tropical fign Ca-
pncorn, with Jupiter's benign afpect located therein. This denotes
health, and uninterrupted profperity, to the native. It is the em-
blem of dignity, an infallible argument of efieem, and a ground of
· Ja(ling reputation to the end of his days. And we need no farther evi-
derice than the foregomg well-authenticated narrative of his O\vn life, to·
convince us of the full completion of all that thefe fortunate beams had
promifed. ·
\Ve mufi not, however, forget to remark, that, as Jupiter hath his
fall in Capricorn, fc it denotes likewife that the native fuall feel fome .
occafional indignities from the oppofition of perfons difcordant to his
own opinions and doClrine, who in the very midfi of the honour and
favour he is re.
ceiving from eminent and royal perfonages, will 'infult
him with· perfoual refleClions and poignant fatire. This, I have no
doubt, was a thoufand times verified, iu almofi every fiage of his life,
by thofe who confidered Baron Swedenborg fuperior to themfelves,
either in favour or abilities, or who fuppofed him touched. with infa-
nity, among which clafs there are more to be numbered in this ifland than
in any other part of the globe.
The active planet Mercury we find likewife in the afcendant, ap-
proaching his own triplicity in the fign Aquarius. The influx of this
planet's beams, and the effect of their predominant mixture with the
qualities of the other planets, in .forming the intelleClual part of man,
have been already fufficiently explained. In the prefent cafe, it is evident,
that this pofition of Mercury gives to the native an acute and penetrat-
iug genius, a iharp and ready wit, with a mind apt for the fciences.
# And, when we add to thefe confiderations, that Saturn is lord of the at:
ceudant, in his exaltation, and beholding the afceudant with triangular
beams, at the fame time that the Sun, the prince over the planetary
fyfiem, beholds Saturn with a trine alfo, we fuall not be furprifed to
find this native poffelfed of a mofi comprehenfive and elaborate under- ·
fiandiug, fraught wi\h the firongefi and fublimeft ideas. Indeed I am
ready to .confeis, that out of all the long catalogue of nativities I have
hitherto infpeCted, 1 never fouud the planet Saturn fo properly confi-
gurated

8~6 AN ILLUST'RATION
gurated to give an enlarged mind, nor the ot~er fignificators at the fame
time fo happily correfpondent therewith, .as in the geniture now under
confideration. How far this ability has been efiablilhed aud confirmed
in the perfon of the native, let his attempts to pry into the depths ofeternal
Nature, and to folve the vifions of the Deity, determine for him.
But, as there can be no large portion of good in this world, fince
the fall, without fome intermixture of evil; fo in this nativity, notwith-
fi:anding its eminent defignation, and the high and important benefits
promifed by it in the fcale of human acquirements, frill we 1ha11 find a
certain portion of malefic influence, of imperfeCtion and misfortune,
whereby the feeds of difcontent and death arc nouriihed up, until they
become predominant over all the powers and functions of our nature. Of
this tendency .is the baneful oppofition of Saturn aa~d Mars; an afpetl
which operated with uncommon firength and duration, both upon the
mental and bodily funCtions of the native, giving him the moll extra-
ordinary euthufiaftic flights of imagination, and expofing him to the
cenfure of the learned, as well as of the illiterate, who charged him wi!h
exorcifm and madnefs. But let me here embrace the opportunity of
affurina thofe who have taken up this idea, that there are not the
f~alleft traces of infanity to be found ·in any part of this geniture. The _
native is perfeCtly found, and fingularly competent, in his underfianding;
but, like the man who purfues the longitude, or the philofopher's ftone,
beyond the beatr.n track of other adventurers, and is elated in proportion
to the new lights he receives, or the hopes he folills of furpaffing every
other·competitor, precifely by the fame ratio will the world meafure his
wits, and decide upon the competency of his underfianding and the found-
nefs of his brain.
We have before feen, that the native's mind was by no means formed
for fociety; for the beginning of all our defires for community with others
mull: be naturally founded in our love of intercourfe with the female fex.
The native (like Sir lfaac Newton) never knew a prediletlion of the kind,
~u~ felt himfe!f _happie~- i~. t_b~ ~'!interr_~£!_e_~_c__QntemJ?Ja!ion__~_f_-~s ·own
ideas; and to fucll a-patch has lie mdulged htmfelf in this particular, that
he has remained ihut up in his private chamber for two, three, and- four,
days together, without admitting any perfon to make his bed, or evc·n
t_
o r~p at his door. This uncommon difpofition can onLy be accouaited
for by the pofitio1-1 of Saturn, fo remarkably elevated, at the fame time
that both the lnminaries are under the earth, which .gives a firong and
invariable propenfity to the native to lead a ·lingle folitary life.

To this grave and folitary turn we are to attribute his early acquain-
ta~Ke and familiarity with fpirits. He had been often heard, in houfes
where he lodged during his abode in London, for whole nights together, ·
in converfation with thefe miffionary beings, who become vifible to thofe
only that have refolution to devote .the whole of their time and attention
to a commu'nity with them. How far Baron Swedenborg has benefited
fociety and himfelf, by the intercourfe he has had with them, let his fe-
veral publications, now in univerfal fale, determine for him. The quef-
tion is too delicate and abftrufe even for an ajiroioger to decide upon ; and
i(is a morfel which even the critics nibble at" with unufual precaution,
left they th~uld be found biting at a file. .
It has been a fubjea of difpute, whether the fpirits, with which -<~
.-ff'-(."'U
?
Swedenborg had familiarity, were good or evil. For my own part,
I have no difficulty in deciding, from the confritution of the planets in
• his geniture, that he had community with both; which ~ believe to
have been the .cafe with every perfon Iince the days of Adam, who has
bad familiarity with fpirits. Indeed, Swedenborg himfelf tells us, that
a certain fpecies of the infernal·fpirits would at times intrude thernfelves
upon him; but that he was always 'preferved, by the goodnefs of the
Lord, from thefe infidious deceivers of men; whofe malice and enmitv
towards us is fo .great, that, were it not for the watchful care and' pro:
teaion afforded us by the clemency of God through the medium of the
good genii, or lower order of the angelic haft, it would be utterly im-
poffible for man to deliver himfelf from the power of hell and the
craft of the devil. But I thall defer entering upon an elucidatioll of
this fubjea, until I come to treat of Spirits, in tho magical part of 'this
work, where-Baron Swedenborg's intercourfe with them will be com-
pletely invefiigated.
I thall next confider the fignificators of the temper and difpofi ion of
this native, to thow how far his general deportment correfponded with
them. As we find Jupiter, Mercury, and the Sun, in his afcendant,
and the Moon at the ,fame time beholding that important angle with
triangular rays, it is evident the temper and difpofition of the man muft

\ ( '
be formed from a due mixture of their inftuxive qualities, each of which
wpuld prove vifibly predominant, as they alternately came to act ,1
thtough the medium of their refpeaive directions. Exaaly fo we find
the. native agitated and imprelfed. At one time his exterior would be
uncommonly pious aud devout, 'exhorting all men, who came within
the reach of his voice, to humility, charity, and repentance. At ano-
ther time he would totally feclude himfelf from all company, fuut

himfelf up for whole days together, aad obferve" folemn and profound
a filence, as not even to give an anfwer wheo fpok.en to. Yet at other
times he would enter into converfation with the utmoft·vivacity and ·
fprightlinefs, and continue for a long time together in this communicative .
humour; but always in a ftile and manner remarkably elevated and
majeftic.
The reafon of a.U this is abutldantly obvious from the face of his
horofcope. The fuperior planets being pofited in hi8 afcen~nt, h1
their full dignities, and confequently in their greateft influence and
energy, a8ed upon the temperature both of his mind and body, as they
refpe8ively came up by direcHon, with uncommon force and power,_
whence the affe8ions of his mind, his words, his actions, and every
motion of his frame, were wound up to an uncommon degree, and
difiinguiihed themfeJves accordingly. ·
It will be readily feen, hy any perfons acquainted with his difpofition
and charaCter, that the fame general turn of temper and conduCt was
uniformly fupported thrcughout the whole of his life, which might
fairly be ranked amongft tbofe of remarkable longevity. And it may · -
be feeu, by any perfon who will take the pains to equate the direCtions
of thofe fuperior afpeas, that they operated by alternate fucceffion with
equal force and influence, until the diredions of death extirpated the co·
incidence of their beams.
The natural caufe of diffolution in the temperament and 4:onfiitution·
of Baron Swedenborg, was, as may be feen by the geniture,. a decay o£
vital hear, occafioned by a redundancy of colJ rheum,. accompanied with
the bloody flux. The dire8ion under which be died,. was the Sun to.
a partile c<'njun8ion with the body of the Moon, taken under the pole of
the Sun. The pole of the Sun is fifty-one degrees; the latitude of the
Moon is one degree one minute north; then,. by taking the oblique afcen-
fion of the Sun and the oblique afceufion of the Moon,. the arch of direc-.
tion will be fixed at eighty degrees feventeen minutes. ·
If we equate this arch. or track of the aphetical and anaretical aars..
by the rules heretofore laid down, we fhall find it gives the fpaee of life
to be eighty-fix years and n~;y two months, at which time the native
emerged frorg this world into a world of fpirits; namely, on the 19th day
of March, 1772. · · . ·

This child was born .precifely at the titne fpe~ified in the plate. Leo.
afcends the oriental horizon, and confequently the Sun is lord of the
afcendant; but being in 'the· eighth hoofe, the houfe of death, is an infalli-
ble argument of a fhort life. The Moon, being in ~ apbetical place,
is the giver of life ; but fllows the deftruftion of it, by forming a quartile
afpea: with the Sun in the houfe of death. No ftronger evidence of an
immediate death can well be adduced; for, fince the Sun is autOOI- of
vital heat, and the Moon of radit!al tnoifl:ure, and both of them.at onc-e
deprived, by malefic rays an.d cadent pofitions,. from atfor.ding a fit and
·due proportion of thofe nouri1hing qualities,. it is impoffible that life
Olould be longer fuftained than during the time this unfortunate afpect
was forming. · ·
It might b.e coatended, that the pontiob: :oftbe ben~voJ.¢t~t plaru:t Ju•
piter in tb.e medium cmJi•.or tenth bou(e, is'highly favourable to the pre..
fervation of the child. But, when it is confidered that this planet has no
afpea with the luminaries, that its beams are only refteaed into. itfelf, and
that all communicatioos with·the afcondaut and ugnificators of life and·
death are cut ott,. we thall fuuJ that this eligible tmfition of the benign
Jupiter, is in the prefent cafe totally without the power of communicat--
Jng the leaft aid to the funelions of lift\' or.of.mitigating or lefiening the·
EQClevoleut effects of the anaretica.l influente. ;
,· ,
A farther proof of this child's ciiffolution arifes from · the Moon'$
pofition in the terms of Mars, at the fame· time that his fiery intempe-
rate beams are conjoined·with tlhe war& irradiations of: tbc cold planet
Satur.n., and thereby. aa: upon thc<n>n~ wilh. viAlent oppofite ~--

tremes. We find alfo that both the ~un and Saturn are difpofed c;f by
Mars ; to whofe fuperior influence Mercury bends,. who, with·the Moon,
nourithes and proteCls the brain. Hence it is obvious that the child
1hould die in its inf~nt ftate, partly from the want of natural ftamioa
and firength, and p~rtly ftom the ·effe& of a cold fucceeded by a fever;
and that this cold thould be of the moiil: kind appears from· the trian...
gular ray~ of Mercury aQd· the Moon in the watery fign Pifces. The
child : lived only until the quartile afpetl of the Sun and Moon was
completely formed, when the weaknefs and debility of .its body and
lungs·gave way to the convulfive agitations of the whooping cough, fuc-
ceeded by cold chins and· fever, the immedia~e effetls of the configura-
tion of Saturn and Mars; fo that nothing lefs than a fupernatural caufe,
which we juftly call a miracle, could poffibly have fave_
d this child's life.
I thall next confider the little offspring which accompanied it; and this
was
A MALE TWIN.
This child came into the world only about two hours after the former;
and yet it is not fubjetl to the fame fate. The Moon is prorogator in
this nativity, as. well as in the other; but with this remarkable differ-
ence~ that both .the luminaries are going from afpeCls of afH.ic1ion, in-
fiead of approaching to them. The Sun is entering into the feventh
houfe, promifing vital heat and firength ; while. the Moon, jufr [epa-
rated from a noxious quartile, gives teftimony to it, by affording a due
proportion of health and nouri1hment, being located in her own houfe
in the fign Cancer. So that, confidering the newly-acquired firength of
the Moon, and the pofition of the Sun in a fign of his own exaltation,
emerging from quadrangular beams of affiictiou, we are afforded the moft
fati~faClory evidence of a found and perfeCt confiitution in ~he tempera-
ture of this native, with fufficient teftimonies to enfure health and
longevity.
The varied pofitious of the other iignificators afford us additional rea-
fons, of a very firong and decifive nat~re, why this twin 1hould live to
years of maturity, while its little companion thould fcarcely be permitted
to fee the light of this world. The conceptional arrangement defcribes
the fuperior firength of this-: child in the womb; and declares it to have
drawn to itfelf a confiderable part of that nourithment which thould have
fallen to the fuare of its flfi:er. ' · ·
As .t~erefore the -pofiticm of the ·luminaries in the other birth declared
a thort life, fo in·this· they afford equal tcftimonies of longevity ; and

confequently the caufe of death will be fought from different [peculation;
fur, though the Moon be giver of life, the caufe of death will be diffe-
rent. In this nativity Saturn is the anaretical planet; and the native
will in all probability be carried into the other world by the dropfv.
He will live until the Moon's body forms a mundane quartile afpetr
with Saturn and Mars; at which time, according to natural caufes, his
thread of life will be cut in twain-when his body will return back to
the earth, and be re-incorporated with the elements; while his ethereal
or effential part mixes with that tormented or ble!fed clafs of fpirits to
which the complexion of his conduCt here fhall recommend him hereafter.
The youth is living, and I hope will draw a friendly admonition from
thefe premif
es.
Of TWINS hom immediately together.
The genitures of thefe Twins are difplayed in the lower part of the
fame plate. The one was born on the I 9th of June, 8h. 4om·. P. M.
or afternoon, and the other at only Sb. 42m. of tlie fame day. The
difference of time is therefore only two minutes; which admits of to
little variation in the pofitions of the planets, and in the coincidence of
their beams, either in refpecr to the angles of the figure, or to the tem-
perature of the ambient matter, that each twin mufl: of neceffity fhare
the fame fate, in all the important confiderations attending the iffues of
fife and death.
To eil:ablifh this fact, we need only contemplate the horofcope, and
compare it with the circumfiances of the genitures we have jufi: dif-
miffed; whereby it will be feeu, that the difference of two hours has
moll dfentially varied the impreffions of the fignificators at the time of.
bi~th in the former horofcope; while, in the prefent cafe, no fuch dif-
tioliion -can be fow1d; and confequently, the effeCts of the elementary
matter being the fame, and the beams of the fi:ars falling in the fame
direCtion, and with equal force, cannot affliCt one infant without the
other fcdiqg the fame affeCtion; not infiantaneoufly, but in a fpace of
time precifely equal to that in which the planetary fyfiem moves in two .
ntitnttes. T his I have obferved in a variety of infiances ; and it is to
tbi-s very remarkable circumftance that the common notion of mankiud
relative to twins, that when one Is taken ill and expires, the other wi/1
fHII follow, has obtained fo much confidence in every part of the uni-
verfe; though we have feen, in the foregoing geniture, th~t this hap~
J?CDS only where twins are born immediately together, and not where .
any confidcrable time.intervenes between thei(" birth, uulef~ the confri-

tution of the ftars .1hould be fo configurated as to continue ~be fame
benefic or malefic influence during the whole of that fpace oftime;
which rarely happens, owing to the difference of velocity in ea~h refpec-
tive planet, and the accidental circumftances of their becoming retrograde
or ftatiouary. ·
To determitie the fate of thefe twins, we have only to confider the
pofitions of .the luminaries with the afpetls of the erratic ftars, and it
will be evident that their exiftence can be but of very thort duration,
and is determined by the tnotion of the primum mobile; for, when Mars
came to the oppofite point of the Moon, which in thefe genitures is
giver of life, it is a~parent they would die. This was exacUy v.erified ;
Mars came to the firft anaretical point in two hours, and to the fecond
in two hours and a half; and the children accordingly died within half
au hour of each other, and within two hours and a half of the time of
their birth. .
. But, to 1how that life could not be prolonged in either of th_efe infants,
we will take a further view of their genitures. The Moon, we find,
is in her detriment, difpofed of by the malignant planet Saturn, within
the rays of an oppofition of Jupiter and Mercury, who become fubfer-
\'ieut ,thereby to the afllitlion of that ponderous malefic. The Sun is
going down under the afBiClion of Mars, difpofed of by Mercury, in
houfes cadent and naturally evil; whereby every thing born under their
iufluence is deprived of vital heat· and nourifiunent. .The . Moon's
pofition, likewife, in th~ phafis of Mars and terms of Mercury, much.
firengthens this judgment ; befides, Mars is dignified in his own termg,
while the Sun is received in the terms of Mars as well as of Jupiter;
fo that four planets out of feven are in the dignities of his malefic influ-
ence, and partake of his temperature. Thefe arc all teftimonies of a
1hort life; and, falling fo immediately together, render the {pace of life
of a fiillle!S duration. .
But, had it been poffible for thefe twins to have out-liv~d the ele-
mentary influx of thete deftrutlivc configurations, fiill they would have
died 1hortly after they had pa·ffed t-
heir infancy, under the anaretical
affiiClion of the Sun direCled to the oppofitional rays of the Moon, who,
being giver of life, would have had her vegetive ftrength and virtue to-
taJly abforbed by him, whereby vital heat and animal pulfation mua:
have totally fubfided.

And here we deduce a caufe .moll: obvious to the fenfes, and firi8Jy
conformable to the laws of uature, \Xhy the.anaretical influence is fome-
times baffled by the fuperior ftrength of the native's ·conftitution, affified
by the rays of aphetic ftars, whereby the difeafe or accident is bafHed;
though death were pronounced inevitable, both by phyftcians and friends;
fo that, w~en the anaretic influence is . thus ove.rcome, the patient
acquires immediate ftrength and fpirits, eats and fleeps, and recovers his
health and vigour in fo furprifing a manner, that the phyfician is cried up
to the 1kies, as the finejJ man in the world, at the very moment when he
himfelf is as much at a lofs to account for the ~ufe as the moft ignora:nt
of his panegyrifis~ · . ·
Thus it happens·ln.many genitures, and requires the aid of reafon and
philofophical acquirements to decide pofitively on the effeBs ofconfigura-.
tions which involve fo much doubt, and appear equally 1:1ndecifive in point
of life or death; though obvious and cert~in_ as to the violence of the dif-
eafe or accident wb~reby the uative 1hall be afBicted. .. : ·,.._,
. ~
The fureft way offorming our judg~e,nt in thefe cafes, "is to direct the
afpeBs of the fiars which bear principal .rule in the hylegiacal and snare-
tical places of the horofcope, far beyond the ::era of fuch u·ndecifive malig-
nant influx, at leaft till another death-like configuration. is formed by
them; and, if this appears the moft ftrong and powerful-in favour of the
killing rays of the anareta, it will generally be found that abfolute death
will not happen to the native until the fecond con~refs of thefe important
fignificators is completed in the heavens, notw1thftanding the danger , ·
threatened by. them in their tjrfi configuration may make it next to a
miracle that the native efcapes with his life. ··

This nativity is of a very rare kind, a1fording an eminent example of
the effec9: of prolific configuration,, where only one fretus is produced
under the nutritive qualities nature bad intended for two. The pofition
of the luminaries here,· in figns fruitful abd obeying, with nearly all
r~e planets under the earth, give the moft demonftrable proofs of large
and high ffature,that can be well adduced; but the additional fingers and
toes refult from the fecundity of four-footed 1igns, occupying the angles
of the figure; at the fame time that the luminaries are fuperior to all the
other planets, whofe regulating influence in this nativity is totally with·
hdd. '
The Sun being in·the twelfth houfe~·and in degrees increafing fortune,
ihows that the native.thall thrive in the world by the rarity o( his parts;
and fo it bas in fome meafure already happened, and will in a much
more eminent manner hereafter, as this youth increafes in bulk and fta-
tur~. He bas now leen thown as a natural curiofity for fome years, and
a great deal of money bas been accumulated by that means.
We have, in the introduCtory part, already thown the radical caufe of
this fuper~bundance of nature in its formatory operation; and iu this
figure thofe rules are completely verified. For neither the fuperior nor
inferior planets having dignities in the afcendant or medium creli, nor
afpec9: therewith, and the principal light of 'time being in the twelfth
boufe, with the Moon in the mid-heaven, and in the figns Gemini, Sagit-
tarius, or Pifces, in azimene degrees, is a demonfirable proof that what
is then born iliall exceed the common line of nature, and be either mon-
ftroufiy mithapen, or above the common bulk of mankind. In the pre-
lent cafe we find both have happened, as well in the excefs of members
as in the mufcu)ar proportion and altitude.
According to the fame mixture and quality of the formative matter, .
we find fimilar conceptions take place, whenever Saturn afflicts th~ Moon
in an angle poffelfed by beafi-Jike or double-bodied figns, with the Sun's
iuperior beams increafed by figns of long afcenfion, and carried to the
fame point by fextile or triangular rays. Under fuch a fynod of plane- ·
taryifignificators, gigantic ftature, or inconceivable corpulency, is furc to
take place. Indeed, I have been confidently informed by a gentleman
who had for many /ears made aftrology his amufement, that this was
nearly the pofition o. the heavens in the genethliacal figure of the much-
celebrated Mr. Bright, fo famed for his corpulency and ftature.

In this nativity, Capricorn, a flgn of brevity, afcends the horofcope;

medium of Mercury, who, being in conjunflion with Saturn, difpofes
·of the Moon, and participates in ·the qualities both of Capricorn and I 1
Saturn. Mercury at befi: gives but a fmall ftature; but configurated )
with thefe rays, he contributes all his influence to check the growth and 1
nouri1hment of whatever is conceived under it.
- -
It is here likewife a moft remarkable circumfta~e, that Mars, from
a fign of brevity, beholds the Sun by a fextile ray pof!ted alfo in a fign
of brevity, fo that the figns occupying the principal angles in this ge-
uiture are precifely of an oppofite quality and influence with thofe in
the laft figure, and confequently have a tendency and effeCt diametrically
oppofite thereto. And fo indeed we nnd it ; for this native, inftead of
exceeding the common fize and ftature of man, will never grow to the
height of four feet, nor potfefs limbs or·parts larger than the common
run of boys of feven years old.
/
An additional teftimony in favour of this opinion is the quartile afpeCt
of Jupiter and the Sun from brevious figns, which ufually demonfirate
the conception of a Dwarf. But indeed it is an univerfal maxim in this
fcience, that whoever hath an earthy fign afcending the horizon of his
nativity, with two or three planets pofited therein, will certainly be but.of
low ftature, particularly if Saturn be located amongft _them; for a cold
aud dry temperature, excluded from the heat and moifture of the two
luminaries, is contrary to the natural growth of any thing, as we may fee
by the ftate of vegetation in the autumnal equinox. ·

fubjeCl of the firfi·mag11itude, in which the hands and hearts of both fexes,
of all ages and degrees, are with one confent united. I therefore confider
myfelf in fome re1peCls bound to fiate the prefeut quefiion, as au example ·
whereby to render this inquiry eafy to fuch of my readers as choofe to
employ their leifure hours in this [peculation.
The circumfiances of this marriage came under my own immed~ate
cognizance and obfervation; and they are fuch as, I trufi, will operate
as a caution to ev.ery tingle perfon,. not to enter into that holy fiate
from mere motives of advantage or convenience, when love is confef-
fedly wanting on the fide of either of the parties. But caution now-a-
days is out of date; and the admonition of friendthip is regarded
only as the fubtile declamation of hypocrify, or the bufy officioufi1efs
of a marplot. ·
The lady, who is the fubjeCl of the prefent quefiion, came to obtain
my opinion and advice how far the prefent marriage would prove advan-
tageous and happy ; confeffing, at ·the fame time, that fue had no great
regard for the old gentleman.- I ftopped her, as is always ll'lY cufiom,
h-om entering into particu)ars, and defired her only to. furniih me ·With
the exaCt time of her own nativity, and to procure me, if poffible, that of
the party to whom fue was engaged. This was complied with,- and I
drew my judgment accordingly.
Upon comparing the radical confiitution of the two genitures, I could
not find a fingle configuration in the one that bore the leafi harmony or
fimilitude with the other. The benefic fiars in the angles of one figure
were oppofe~ by the malefics in the angles of the other. The mafculine
temperature was ftrougeft in the female horofcope, with the Moon and
Mercury in good afpea iu the fifth houfe-; while, in the man's geniture, ·
the effeminacy of female influence was but too appareut, with the morti:
fying tefiimony of Satu-rn, lord of the afcendant, in oppofition' to Mars,
the lord of the fifth, and the Moon affiiCled in a cadent houfe.
The places of marriage in both figures were occupied with the leffer
infortunes, but not difcordant; neither were they tnlrmonized by a fin-
gle ray of benefic influence. I therefore faw the probability of marriage
taking place betwixt them, at the fame time that the warm paffions oC
the woman rendered it impoffible for her to be happy in the arms of a
cold, frigid, aged, harrell', and atmoft impotent, hufuand. I clearly faw
avarice had a thare in her compofition~ and that the hope of advantage
~pplied :the place of <:.onnubi.al atfeCtion. This I detected, and con-
'No. 43• 9 Z demned

demned as highly reprehenGble; .and at the fame time candidly pointed
out the natural infirmities of the man fue propoCed to call hufband, which,
added to his advanced age, made it impoffible for her to enjoy the natu-
ral felicities of a married life, or that they could long live and cohabit fo-.
gether. My advice was therefore to drop all thoug~ts whatever of fuch
a connexion, and a refolution was apparently formed for that purpofe;
but the contrary perfuafions of friends, added to the fordid temptations-of
]ucre, in a fuort time got .the better of my advice; and on the 29th of
November then next follo!Ning this couple were married.
Determined to be confirmed in my judgment of this curious m~tch, I
took down the exaCt time the ceremony was performed, which was .at
·forty minutes paft nine .in the morning, when the heavenJy intelligencers
difplayed themfelves as in the annexed plate, and the tignificators corref-
ponded with their refpective genitures in a manner aftonifuingly correct,
and fo as to prove, to the fati3fatliou ofevery reafonable mind, that the
impulfive or infiin8ive faculty within us is fiirred up and excited by the
medium or intluxive agency of the celeftial bodies.
The afcendant of this matrimonial figure is given for the bridegroom,
and·the feventh houfe for the bride. Saturn we find is fiill lord of the
afcendant, located in his own houfe; and mofi.-aptly defcribes the perfon
of the bridegroom, viz. a tall, lean, flender, perfon, advanced in years,.
with long vifage, da~k hair, meagre compleJ!ion, and peeviih difpofition ;
whilfi his imbecility is moft corre8ly denoted by the pofition of Venus,
difpofed of by the .frigid planet Saturn· in Capricorn. .
The Moon in Cancer; in the feventh boufe, reprefents the bride; and
·defcribes her to be of a middle fiature, round full face, brown hair, and
well proportioned ; and, as the Moon is approaching to a trine afpeCl with
Mars, it 1hows her to be a woman of frn:mg paffions.and fpirit; hot, fiery,
aitd impatient, though good...uatured and courteous.
Let it here be premifed, that, in all marriages where the two figuifita-
tors which reprefent the bride and bridegroom are not in good afpea with
each other, it is impotftble the parties can live in harmony; ~either do
they come together by the impulfe of pure love, but for fome Qtber mo-
tive, which may generally be known by examining what houfe tbe lord of
the afcendant. or feventh houfe applies to, and the nature of the planets by ,
which they are then occupied; for, if the lord of the eighth apply to tb,e
lord of the afcendant, or if there be no reception of the luminaries iu their
nativities, they are carried to the hymeneal altar, not by the force of lovet

but ·by motives of avarice. · ·Somttimes·i1-1deed we ·find love to ~e ou Qn.e_
fide, and interefr only <m the· other. This is wbcn the lord of the afcen-
dant is a fuperior planet, and the lord of the feventh an inferior one of a
contrary nature, and yet applying to the lord of the afcendant. Again,
we find marriages take place where there is no love at all, as is the cafe
in the above figure, where Saturn, a fuperior and ponderous planet; figni-
ficator ofthe man, is pofited in his own houfe; and the Moon, a light and
inferior one, aud fignificatrix of the woman, likewife in her own houfe ;
but both of them in oppofite ftgns; being a demonftrable proof of avari.ce·
on one fide, but of love on neither.
Upon the whole, mutual convenience may be traced out as the pri-
mary incentive in both.thefe parties. The man was rich and old; tho
woman young-but not rich. So Mars, being lord of the tenth houfe,
and pofited therein, colleas ·the·rays both of Saturn and the Moon;. and,_
bein~ fo much hi9h~t el.eva~ed, impreffesiwith a. frronger i~ftux this dif....
J>ofitton upon tbe1r mchnatJons, and. proves ·to us that thctr hands -were.
joined, but not their' hearts.
Jupiter, in all cafes where he is free from malignant beams, hath de-
fignation of perfect honefty. In ·this figure we find him juft entering
into his own houfe, in platic trine to the-Moon, and ·in fextile with Ve-
uus. But, although· he tbus fa-vourably irradiates tbefc two- prolific pla-
nets, fo as to impel-a· joint- inclination .to ·have the -marriage~cercmE)ny'
performed, yet, by being a quarlile afpeB: to the-Sun and Mercury in the·
eleventh ho~fe, which is the ·bride~si fifth, · aad·confequently her houfe of
children, pleafure, and delight, it plainly·demonftrates, that, though 1he~
1hould have no offspring by her -hufband, {he.would take .cace to acquire
i! by other means. . .
The Sun and Mercury have dignities in the:feveDth--boufe, and confe""' ·
quently have !hong fympathy with the bride ; but. being pofited in the
eleventh, they become figni6cators of onemies of the .bridegroom. The
Sun having his triplicity in the twelfth,. and -being· within five degrees
of the cufp, united at the fame time with Mercury, ihows that their
influence will be of the like nature and tendency; and, as both of them

AN ILLUSTRATION
Saturn, the fignificator of her hufuand, fhows that they will feparate, and
abandon each other, without any bodily union whatever.
The extraordinary circumfrances of the c.afe induced me to give my
opinion of the marriage very freely, in the company I was in, the fame
day it was, ifI mayfo term it, confummated. Much mirth, of courfe,
refulted from my obfervations; but very few believed the circumfrances
I mentioned would fo fuddenly" come to pafs ; particularly that a fepara-
tiou would prove the confequence of a·tingle night's embrace: and that
both parties would difllpite with fo much indifference.
The faCls quickly followed the prediClion. The new-marri~d pair
were put to _bed-where love andjoy foould take their fill: but fuch was
the fingularity of the cafe, that the bride rofe up with the fun, and, hav-
ing been refufed that participation of fortune. her friends had blazoned
out, and finding no other allurement to fupply that defe8, fhe immedi-
ately deferted her hufband, who never took the pains to retrieve her; and
fhe has fince attached herfelf to two other perfons, by both of whom fhe
has had children. ·
Whoever contemplates the horofcope given in the annexed plate, will
eafily account for this otherwife extraordinary narration. They will
likewife perceive that we have given a lively contraft of a bad marriage, .
by an emblematical reprefentation of a good one, where heart and hand,
and innocence and love, draw down the fofrering hand of heaven with
fruitfulnefs and joy. Interefr and ambition ought furely never to guide
the laws of love. The fweet intercourfe of the fexes, and the ecfratic
blending of foultmd body in the bonds of matrimony, becomes a crime,.
when not .direCled by that heavenly flame. It is the attic fire of aJJ..
powerful love, which alone teaches us to be happy here, and leads to im-
mortal happinefs hereafter ; for,
..__ ..
Well-chofen love on earth can never die,
But with our nobler part afcends the fky.

Venus. is in npneteen d·egrees forty minutes o.f Leos which reprefents the

prove the na•ive to ha.ve bee~ e~dewed wi.th a lar:ge, ~nevoleot, and
cogrageout,.heart; aU of which, in.the. ~oo.rfc of his.life aud a.dion&, were
in a thoufand infiances exemplified. Nor aJrC thefe exc«lfeut endow-

they are farther ill:uArated and llr.eu-gthened b1 the .aorth node of the

In this nativity the Moon is certainly Hyleg, and is~herefore to be ·
direeled for death. The Sun, Mars, and Mercury, are co-fignificators of
death ;. and, hence it is that the learned Gadbury attributed his death to
p:ri1bn, which misfortune befel him when the Moon came to the quartile

of Mercury in the eighth houfe. This .Prediclion of the native being
poifoned, is unquell:ionably co1~firmed by what is recorded of Olympias
his mother; who having, fix years after his death• difcovered the fact,
caufed many fufpeCted perfons to be put to death, as accetfaries in the
murder. ·

This native is ufuaUy denominated Bloody Nero; and, indeed, if we
but caft our: eye upon the horofcope of his birth, we thall find ample de-
monftrations of a cruel and vindiCtive difpofitioo. Mars is oppofite to·
. Jupiter and Venus in the twelfth houfe, an afpeCl: of noxious and direful
!:J~ /L *-~ tendency. Jupiter, we find,. is lord of the tenth, and confequentJy fio-ni-
/ ~ / ~~ ficator of the native's mother. Mercury is lord of the afcendant, in e~aCl:
~ .../~quartile of the Moon, which is· an obvious proof that the native thould
cruelly treat and abufe his mother; and, as Mercury is at the fame time
~~ in fextile of Mars, it is a probable argument that he would become a.
murderer. The quartile of the Sun and Saturn is a configuration pro-
duClive of every vicious inclination, and of every atrocious crime. Under
the influence of this malignant direCtion, which held for a confiderable
length of.time, he not only became hated by the people under his govern-
ment, but exercifed thofe bloody and u.nparalleled cruelties that darken
and difgrace the annals of his reign.
In the black catalogue of his offences it is recorded, that he not only
murdered his mother, but firfi: committed inceft upon her. He poifoned
his own brother; killed his fifi:er in law; and deftroyed his wife Poppea, ..
by kicking her to death when pregnant. He wantonly fet fire to Rome,...-
and exultingly made an entertainment in fight of the flames, while the
city was burning.; and, being afterwards proclai~ed by the R?man fenate
an enemy to the ftate,. he, the moment he heard tt, became hts own exe-
cutioner, and deftroyed himfelf in the thirty-fecond year of his age; the
diretlions for which are the Moon to the conjunCtion of Mars, and Jupiter
to the oppofition of the Sun, who, in this nativity, was Hyleg, or giver of
life. Thus the confi~rations precifely defcribe the quality of the man,
and the diretlions ilio.w the manner of his death ;. ·all of which minutely.
came to pafs.

This nativity difplays a brilliant alfemblageof benignant configurations,
calculated to promote thf! mofi exalted honour and felicity. To prefigure
the native's future greatnefs, here is a mofi remarkable conjunClion of the
Sun and Jupiter in the afcendant ; and, to prove that this fplendour iliall
arife from ecclefiaftical preferment, we perceive the lord of the ninth
houfe in conjunClion with the lord of !he tenth, a]fo in the arcendant. .x· /~--
That an extenfive flow of wealth and nches thall accompany thas prefer- ...,.«- ./ :;;<
ment, is evident from the pofition of the lord of the afcendant in the ~cL-~ · ~
fecond houfe, ftrong in dignity, and in trine afpeCl: of the Moon, which is til p. /:4- a :;;t/£
· in conjunCl:ion with the Part of Fortune. Thefe are univerfally aUo~ed :p # ft:!.Lc.

and the refult proved the certainty of the fact. At the age of fixty-four ~/~ ~~d"
he was eleCled pope; at which time the medium creli came. to the body ,4 ~ /--Vo'A ·-'
of the Sun, as may be feen by equating the direClion ; and is a moft apt z """- t//~ /.;!!
coi1figuration for producing princely honour and fovereignty. The Sun, ;-%.
in' this nativity, is Apheta, and the Moon is Anareta; fo that, when the
Sun and Moon came into contaCl: by anaretical rays, the illufrrious native
departed this life, which happened on the 24th of Auguft, 1590, at which
time the Sun came to the perfeCl quartile of the Moon, in fixty-nine years
from the day of birth, which was the exaa age of the native.

the oppofing irradiations of the beuefic fi:ars defcribe the manner in
which he was preferved.
In the year I 633, a confpiraey was fi>rmed againfi: this prince, and he
was in the utmoft danger of being fiabbed. This is declared by the direc·
tion of Mars to an appofition with the afe~nt by direB: direB:ion, and
prevented by the (uperior {e>rce of the.bendL: rays.
In 1649, when the native was nearq forty-four years old, he was at..

vented by the uaaithing beams of Jupiter direfud at the fame time to

HENRY VI. KING Qf ENGLANO..;.Born in Lat. s1• j2'.
This prince fucceeded to the crown of his ancefiors wheri he was but
-two months old, and was crowned King of Englan~ CUl the 6th of No-
vember, 14~9; the midbe;lven being t~en d~retled to1a trine afpect of the
Moon. At ten years-of:,ge he .was crowned King of France in the city
of Paris, under the influence of the afcendant directed to the body of the
Moon, which configuration participates of the fame nature and quality
with the former; and they both moll aptly denote thefe illuftrious events,
when applied to the p.rrfOtts of princes of the blood, Qt Co heirs apparent
to the throne.
At twenty-four years of age, the afcendant is irradiated by the fextiie
rays of Jupiter; under which direClion he marries the celebrated Lady
Margaret,.daughter to the Duke of Anjou, ·a princefs of mafculinc refo--
Jution and courage, which is reprefented by the fiery planet Mar~, .}ocflted
ia the feventh houfe, in his, exaltation; This violent and· ~ntrepid fpirit
of Margaret was quite oppoftte to that of her confort, who imbibed from
nature a difpotition remarkably mild and meek, as is obvioufly prefclged
by the paffive qualities of feveral fignificators in his geniture difplayed in
the foregoing plate.
In his thirty-ninth year., this native was takcu ,captive by tbe Earl of
Marc_
h ; and, by confent of the people, firipped of his royalties, and fent
prifoner to the Tower. This untoward event is.prefiiged by the-Moon's
qua_rtlle application, firfi to the midheaven, and then to a malefic quartile
of Mars, both which dire£tions came up precifely at the time thefe circum-
Ranees took place. After be had been twelve years a cloU:, prifoner,
namely, on..t]le -21~ of May, 1642, being then 6fty years of age, be ~as
inhumanly murdered by the hand of Richard, the bloody Duke of Glou- ·
cefter. Mars then came to the quartile of the Moon, which, in thi$ na-
tivity, was Giver of Life.
· If we confider the relative pofitions of the plauets in this geniturc, we
lhalluot wonder that this prince was unfortunate in war, and unfuccefs-
ful in all his enterprifes. The Moon in oppofition to Mars, fireugtbened.
by angular places, and Man, fignilieator of public ~mies, fo powerfully
1ocated in· ·his own houfe, at the ·ume time that he is confiituted the
gover·niog planet ofthe gei1iture, is anirrefragable argument that Fate and'

The lofty fpirit and arbitrary will of this prince are demonftrably
proved by· the pofition of the luminaries i~ cardinal figns, as difplayed in·
the annexed plate. His temperature and jnclinatious :are afcer~ained by
the configurations of Mercury i~ trine of the Moon, and. in fextile to
Venus; at the fame time that. he beholds.tpe afcendan~ ~ith. a fextile ray,
and forms co11cordant familiarities with:thc..otbC.r fignificators. T.his·not
only befpeaks a winning and .complacent dc~£trnent, but manif~fts a
luxuriancy in the gifts of. nature, not commonly befl:owed upon the maf-
culine conformation. _ Here are however firong marks of obftinate rcfent~
ment, and obdurate revenge, even againft females ; whom it was not in
his nature to forgive, when once ferioufly incenfed againft them; as the
houfes and.figns teftify_
, •wherein·Venus !and Merc.~uy ·are locatc;d.. . ·
The aftrological caufe of this native's defire after many women is de-
duced from the fextile irradiations of Venus and the Moon with Merc-ury~
t]le Moon being at the fame time dignified in the feventh houfe. And
the reafon of his continual difagreements and contel)tions with them, is
becaufe Jupiter, lord of the feventh, i~ 1n quartile with Mars~and. the af-
cendant, which ftir up the choleric humour, unallayed by fafcivi9\l!hetS
and luft. The feverity of his treatment. to them, is depicted by the lumi-
naries being in quartile to each other; the Moon in the weft angle,·in.
the houfe of Mars; while Venus, the fignificatrix of his concubines, is in.
conjuntlion with the Dragon's. Tail. ··

It is remarkable of this native, that he was extraCted by manual ope-
ration from his mother's womb, and his life preferved. 'At ·ten years of
age he fucceeded to the cwwn of Great Britain, namely, on the z8th of
January, I 547; at which time the aiCendant of his nativity came by direc-
tion to. the conjunaion afpeCl: of the planet Venus, lady of the tenth houfe,
or medium-creli, which is the houfe of dignity, honourL and fuprem'?
power.
This prince reigned only fix years and five months, and expired when
he was little more than fixteen years old. The afcendant, in his geniture,
mufi be taken for Hyleg, or giver of life, becaufe neither the Sun, Moon,
nor Part of Fortune, are in aphetical places. Saturn is the Anareta, or
defl:royer of life; aud confequently, when Saturn came by diredion to
the afcendant, the native expired.
, 'fo prove this to be a fatal direCtion, we find there were operating at
the fame time, the Sun to the quartile of Mars and the Moon to the op-
pofitioil of the fame malefic planet; fo that both the luminaries were
afiliaed when Saturn traverfed the afcendant, and gave freth vigour to
, the band of death. Hence it is apparent, that this native was not de-
(Jgned by nature either for a long or a happy life. ·

li1 this geniture wo 6nd Saturn lord o( tho afcendant, out of all bis own
dignities, but in the dignities o( Jupiter, and in a fiery figu. Jupiter we
find is _the difpofitor of ·
·Saturn ; ·but is poftted io a fiery fign likewife.
Thefe are infallible atrguments of an oppreffive ana rigorous government.
The Moon being in oppofition to Jupiter from angles, hath defignation
of grievou~ dilfenfions about religion. The quartile configurations of the
Sun with Mars, and Mars with Mercury, in the dignities of Jupiter, in
bicorporal figns, near Aldebaran, 1how the diihonourable and bloody
reign of this princefs, atld the perfecution of her fubjetls in matters o(
confcience and religion. Venus, being lady of the third houfe, repre-
fcnts her lifter; and, being pouted in the twelfth, moll aptly decJares ~er
fifl:er's imprifonment ; and the more fo, as Saturn is not only lord of the
afcendant, but lord likewife of the twelfth, the houfe of imprifonment
and affiiaion. ·
When tbc·a.fcondant came t1) tho fextile of the Sun, 1he fucceeded to
the crown of Great Britain, namely.. in the year 155,3, being.then n~ar

·to·Philip king of Spain; under the direCtion of the Sun to the trine of

, This native died in the fartY'"fecond year of her age, after the bad
reigned about five years and a half. . The time and manner of her death
are pointed .out by the Sun, which is giver of life, directed to 1 the
quartile of the Moon, in quartile to Saturn, lord of the afcendant; and on
the day file died the Moon came to the oppofition of Mars. Thefe direc..

death. ·

diCtive jealoufy arid refeutment .of her enemies. During thefe 'troubTes,
the had operating a moll: malefic cJireCtic:>n ofSaturn to the quartile of the
Sun, in the ninth houfe, which. exaaly defcribes the caufe for which lhe
was perfecuted, namely~ . her here.dit~ry right to the crown, and her attach-
ment to the proteftant religion. ,
When this illull:rious princefs attained her twenty-fifth year, lhe
triumphed over her domefiic e~emies, and was crowned Queen of Eng-
land. At this time the afcendant was direCl:ed to a trine afpeCt of the Sun,.
who is the patron of honour and fovereignty• .
In the fixty-ninth year of her age; this celebrated princefs made ..her
exit, under the mortal direction of the afcendant to the quartile afpeCl: of
the fun; leaving pofrerity to record the bleffings of her reign, in which
were laid the fo1id foundations of the protefiant efrablilhmeut.
Should the young frudent take the pains to fet a revolutional figure for
the year of the native's death, he will find there was a conjunction.ofthe
two infortunes in the oppofite place of the Moon in h~r radical nativity:
and the figure itfelf nearly in quartile to that of her birth. The lord .
of the afcendaut was in th~ eighth, and the Sun was faUing in the fixth
houfe; and on the day of her death, viz. the 24th of March, I 6o2, the
Sun and Mars were both in the place of the direClion, and the Moon in
quartile of them both, as if nature herfelf fympathifed with her fubjects

It was not until the tw~nty-eighth year of his age that any thing re-

At tHirty;..two years: or·a'ge-' lie was ~ deputed,. as•the principal in com-
miffio_n, to feize ·the ·s~arlilh fleet; and _foon.after he was created earl--
mat'thal by tHe queen. ·This- latter honour begat him abuttdance .of.
enemies, and:created great' jealoufies ·and : fufpicions. among the nobles~.
ana particularly among thofe who were· invefte<l· with .the feveral: dig:-
nities and offiCes of fiate. · At: this -time the: native. had'the luminaries
direCted to the fextile of Venus; and, to thow the:envy and ma1ev-
olence
of his enemies, he had the midheaven direCled to the oppofition of the Sun.
In the thirty-third year C!f his age this- native was appointed to Ire-·
land; viz. on the 27th·of March, 1599· The Dragon's Tail was then·
on the afcendant; and, the d;<~y he fet off, the Sun and Saturn were in,
oppoCition fr.om the tenth and fourth houfes; and, what was worfe, the
medium creli came· by direClion to an oppofitiou with the·.Moon. It
is hence evident.that he would not profper; and the event prov-
ed the
fa&; for, on the 28th of September following, he returned to the court
of London, ·the Sun being· then in· the place of Saturn at the time of his
fetting out.
On the 2d of OClober, I 599, he was committed to the Tower; and in
June following he was fufpended from aU his employments- and offices
in the fiate. On the' 1·9th ofl February, 16oo,. he was arraigned, tried,
and condemned; at1d on the 25th of the fame month, being Aili-Wed-
nefday, at eight o'clock in tlie morning, he was beheaded·; at which t~me
the midheaven came to a malefic oppofition with Mars. .
The arguments of a violent or premature· death, iu. this nativity, are
many. The two luminaries in conjunClion with Mars, in afpeet with a
violent fixed.fiar; the Su~ ~rmt Moon,~ and lord of the eighth' houfe, in
violent figns; and Mars in Sagittariu_
s affiiCling the luminaries; are fo
mapy arguments, in any geniture; of an ignominious and untimely end ;
and, iu the nativities of pe·rfons of quality- and diftiutlion, they are always
cot1fidered as emblems of tbe lofs of life; honour, and·reputation.
At the moment of this unfortunate nobleman'g.. death, the radical
place of tpe Dragon's Tail afcended; the Sun and Mars were in oppoCi-
tion to the afcendant of the revolutional figute, at1d Saturn was in exaa
oppofition to the Dragon's Tail; ail which circumfiances declare his.life·
to have been taken away l>y. violebce ~nd treachery, to fatiate private re-
.(entment, and to appeafe the clamours of thofe w-ho were too powef.ful to
be opp.ofetJ, and tbo fang~iuary to rife in the political hemifphere but at
the price of the blood of thofe by \vhom they had been eclipfed.

JAMES I. KIN~ of ENGLA•ND,---Bonr in Lat. sn<>•.
This geniture is· remarkable. for · gi¥ing a.great· numoer of teftimonies
ro the· honour, dignity; and pre...eminence; of the native. The Sun·be-
ing in·-exatl fextile to the afc.endant from the tenth houfe; the Moon in
part.ile fextile: of Jupiter ;• Jupiter in conjun<ftion ~ith the Part of Far-
tune in the fecond houfe; Venus, lady of the tenth, located therein,.hav-
ing familiarity with ·many eminea'lt fixed fiars, in trine to the fecond
houfe ; the two luminaries in perfeCt reception of each other; aud the
lord of t.he afcendant in the tenth houfe in coniunClion with the Sun,
and in fe:xtile to the afcendant ;-are tefiimonies of dignity, honour, mag-
nificence, and fupreme power, rarely to be found in one and the fame ge-
niture; but which were in the moll: remarkable manner verified in the ·
perfon of this illuftrious prince. ~
But, notwithfianding thefe extraordinary arguments of fplendour and ·
fover~ignty, deduced from the .influx of the fiars, yet we 1hall on the
other hand find, that this celebrated monarch was not without his thare
of anxiety and trouble; as the annals of the Briti!h page abundantly
prove. In the aftral fcience thefe perplexities are prefaged by the famili-
arity of Venus with the Dragon's Tail, in perfecr quartile of Saturn aud:
Mars; which fufficiently accounts for every evil that befel him. Added
to which, we mull: not forget to remark the difcordant rays of the Sun
and _Mercury, in quartile to J~\'iter, lord o~ the. feven~h ho~f~, and in
cardmal figns, whereby the enmttles and confptractes agamft htm are moO:
accurately forefeen. ·
The coronation of this prince took place iu London, when he was
thirty-feven years of age; at which time the Sun came to the zodiacal
parallel of Venus, lady of the tenth houfe, which hath defignation of fame,
honour, magnificence and preferment.
The memorable powder-plDt (memorable only for its diabolical malig-
nity) happened in the thirty-ninth year of the native's age, under the moO:
noxious quartile afpctl of the leff'er malefic, the infortune Mars ; the ten-.
dency of which mifchievous direClion was removed by the fuperior rays
of the benevolent Jupiter.
In this nativity the Sun is Hyleg; and we find Mars, Venus, and.
S.aturn, all of them operating in the anaretical place of the geniture..
Hence it is obvious,_that, when the Sun came to the conjunClion of Mars,,

j9intly with the quartile of Venus and conjunction of Saturn, the native
would fuffer a violent death; which really took place, when thefe direc-
tions came up, in the fixtieth year of his age. The conftitution of Venus
with the Dragon's Tail, irradiated both by Saturn and Mars, in the aua-
retic place, thows the native's death to have been occafioned by fOifon ;
for the immortal Ptolemy faith, that, whenever Venus is joined with the
malefics, in familiarity with the Dragon's Tail, in directions to the hyle-
giacal or anaretical parts of the horofcope, it portends death by poifon-
and fo it really happened in the prefent inftance.
CHARLES I. KING of ENGLAND.-Boru in Lat. 56°.
This unfortunate monarch was crowned king of this e.mpire in the
twenty-fifth year of his age; and was foon after married to the daughter
of Henry IV. of France. The medium-creli was then dire8ed to the
triangular rays of the Moon, in the houfe of dignity.
In the twenty-ninth year of his geniture he had the mediutn-c<rJi di-·
rected to the oppotition of the Sun, under which influence he diffolved
his parliament. The Scotch enthufiafiic phrenzy took place in his thirty-
eighth year, under the direction cf Saturn to a conjunCtion of the Moon.
In 1641, being in the forty-firfi year of his age, ·he fummoned a ne~ par-
liament, in which the famous contention about the militia took place.
It Jikewife fermented Eeligious jealoufies, and laid the foundation of feri-
ous machinations againfi the king's life; all which misfortuhes are pre-
figured by, and happened under the influence of, the afcendant dir~Cted
to the quartile of Venus, lady of the tenth houfe, and of the medium-
creli direCted to the quartile rays of Jupiter.
It was in the forty-fixth year of his geniture, that this monarch placed
his life in the hands of the Scotch army, expecting from them thatiafety
and protetlion they had proffered to give. But, when they had effeCted
their bargain with the- parliament, they bafely furrendered him up, in
violation of all the ties of honour, humanity, and benevolence. This
tranfaetion took place under the malevolent influence of Saturn tranfiting·
. the midheaven, a configuration in the world known to be the forerunner ·
of ingratitude, treachery, and deceit.
In his forty-eighth year, this unhappy monarch was beheaded, before
the front of his own palace, Whitehall. This memorable event was ef-
fected under the diretlion ofthe Part of Fortune to· the quartile of.the

to trifle with the remonfirances of a.free people ; nor to hold in defiance
that genuine flame of heaven-born patriotifm, which, when once {eri-

0 LIVER C R 0 M WELL, Lord High ProteCtor of ENoLA ND.
· Born in Lat. 52° 19'.
In the. nativity of this enterprifing and extraordinary charaCter, we
find fix planets effentially fortified, and four of them in friel1dly trine
to each other, with the luminaries and Jupiter in fextile. Thefe confi-
gurations prefage the moft important acquifitions to the perfon of the
native; at the fame ·time that they illufirate the intrepidity and valour
of his fpirit, with th~ capacioufnefs and fagacity of his mind. The pro-
fefiors of this. art, both ancient and modern, agree, that, where only
thre~ planets are found effe'rttially _dignitied in a nativity, it is an earneil
of fingular profperity and good fortune to the native; but, where .fix tef-
timonies of the fame nature occur, it is an evident proof that the per-

In the year 1640, this. native was .elevated to a feat in the Britith par-
liament. This was his firfi ·fiep to public fame and honour, and hap-
pened under the courfe of the inedium-c~li to the Dragon's Head, feconded
by a favourablc.revolution, it~ ' whicb Jupiter. occupied the cufp of,the tenth
houfe.
In the .year 164~, Cromw~Jl wu appointed to the command-of a regi-
ment:of horfe; arid he raifoo' one·troop at his.own :expel_lce. The Moon
was tb~xi directed ·to the Scorpion's Heart, an•eminently martial and jovial
fixed .fiat. In I:~J, he was. eletfred 'Lieutenant-general to the Earl of
Manchefter, under the: direction of the. Moon· .to the trine afpeft . of

both lides. The earl COilcei\tiug bimfe}f the better matt, and fuppoflng
his intereft in parliamellt co·'be much ·fuperior, he preferred divers infor-
mations againft hit lieutena,nt-genetal, but to little or no effeet. The
native quickly exculpated bimfelf, and triumphed over his accufer. Dur-
ing the whole of this year, Saturn occupied the afcendant of his revolu-
tional figure ; and in hia radix, or figure of birth, the afcendant w~ at
the fame time direCled to the term of Mars.
In 1645, the . native was appointed Lieutenant General under Sir
Thomas Fairfax; and now his fame began to fpread abroad. The
Moon was then direCled to the fextile afpeCt of Saturn, lord of the
mcdium-creli; and under this direCtion he eventually took the lead of
Fairfax himfelf.
In the year I 648, he remonfi:rated with the parliament, and contended
with the levellers, by which he fell into difgrace. Under the influx of
the fame directions, he formed the plan of bringing his fovereign's ·head
to the block. Thefe malignant beams proceeded from the quartile afpea
of the Sun and Saturn, accompanied by the ·Part. of FortWlc to the oppo-
fition of Venus.
'
In J 649, Cromwell attended the army in the expedition againfi: Ire-
land. He fucceeded in the undertaking, but was fenrely indifpofcd with
a flux and fever. This all happened under the fucculent beams .of the
Moon, direCted to the parallel of Jupiter in the zodiac. The years 1650
and I 65I were employed in fubduing the oppofition in Scotland. Where-
ever the native tumed his arms, he came ofF viaorious. This was the
Suo direCl:ed to his own fextile, and the furtuoate irradiations of the prin-
cipal ftgnificators in the rcvolutional figures of thofe two years to their
radical places in the geniture ; whereby all things appertaining to the oa"" .
tive profpered well, and terminated generally to his own particular inte•
reft and advantage.
The memorable zra of his aifuming tha power: of Lord Proteaor of
England, was 1653• when he boldly poffeffcd himfelfof the avenues lead-
ing to the Houfe ofCominons, ·and put an end to the fittings of·parlia-
ment. Eying the Speaker's mace, he ordered his attendants to take away
" that idolatr014s bauhle;" tho~h be afterwards thought it no vanity to
have three fuch borne before h1m. Thefe events took place when the
Sun came to the bodily afpeCl of Jupiter, and to the fextile of the Moon~
at the fame time that the Part of Fortune reeeivcd the.1extilc beams of

Venus ; f<t-tbat both the benefic planets concurred in the fu~cefs of this
daring entorprife.•
In the year 1654-t Cromwell effeCted an honourable peace with France,
through the medium of Cardinal Mazarine; and he concluded a treaty of
alliance with the King of Sweden, through the indefatigable perfever-
ance of Mr. \Vhitlock. This gentleman was rewarded for his merit, by
being dignified with a title, and appointed ambaltador to the Swediih
coun. Thefe incidents occurred under the influx of the Part of Fortune
diredcd to the trine of Mars. ·
The craft and fubtlety of the native. were never more confpicuous than
when be convened a new parliament, for the purpofe of g_etting himfelf
confirmed in the fovereignty of the empire, under the affumed t_itle of
Lord High ProteCtor. This took place in the year 1656, when the Part
of Fortune came to the fextile rays of the infidious planet Saturn, lord of
the tenth houfe, joined with a favourable revolution; whereby is moll:
aptly prefaged, the attainment of advantage and preferment under the
hypocritical maik of piety and religion. To fuch a pitch of adulation
were fome of his creatures arifen, that they not only confirmed him in
the title of Lord High ProteCtor, but intreated him to a1fume the name
and dignity of Kin_g. This, however, he had the fagacity to refufe: deem-
ing it fafcr to poffetS the power, without the pomp, of majefty.
In the year 1657, when thus invefi:ed with the fupreme jurifdietion of
the kingdom, he fent 1ix thoufand men upon an expedition into Flanders,
under the command of Sir John Reynolds. This valiant knight had
likewife confulted Mr. Lilly before his embarkation ; and he 1hortly
afterwards reduced and took poffeffion of Dunkirk, as that proficient in
the aftral fcicnce had prcviouOy aifured him would be the cafe. The Sun
was then forming a perfeCl.fc:xtilc of the planet Mercury in cardinal figns
applying to Mars.
·In the year .1658, on the third.- of September, 3b. 15m. P.M. this
phenomenon amongft mankind departed this life, in the natural way,
without alfaffination-which is perhaps the: greateft wonder of the age
• It is a circumftance wonby of remark, that, before Cromwell put tbft bold kbeme iDIDexec:~
ti!)D, he fent for the celebrated Mr. Lilly, (who at that time of 4a_y was fingularly eminent for his
aftrOJ~ical knowledge,) and confulted him upon the occafion. Mr. Lilly only ~uefted to be put
iD poOCtioa of die hour ofhis rativity, and be woald foon ioform him of tbc ~bility of tbc event.
This was complie4 with J the dircdions above (pecified were equated and confidercd, and the con(e-
qaences exaa~ foretold. Cromwen is thererore fuppofed to have entered with more confidence into

in which he lived ; and can only be attributed to the fear-not to the
love-of thofe who had aecefs to him. In the direClions which produced
his death, the Sun is the Apheta, or giver of life, and Saturn the Anareta,
or deftroying planet ; and the incidence of their beams met by quartile
.rays precifely at the time this illuftrious native gave up the ghoft, as any
one might perceive, by equating the arch of direClion.
.
Thus terminated the life and aClions of a man, who perhaps had never
:had his equal, though he has been greatly furpalfed by a conqueror of our
own days--whofe refources were within himfelf; and whofe progrefs
through life was marked with thong portions of temerity and hypocrify-
of perfeverance and good fortune. He attempted nothing but what he
accoinplilhed; and furmounted difficulties which would have plunged half
the univerfe into ruin and defpair. ·

It muft be pretty obvious to the reader, that the utmofi: of my defign
in giving thefe nativities, is merely to lhow the principal incidents of
each native's life, and diftinClly to point out the configurations or occur-
fions of the planets under which they happened; that, by comparin·g the
one with the other, in every age, occupation, or diftinClion, of human
life, we might be convinced, by the uniformity of fa&, and the evidence
of our own fenfes, that the one is, in a limited degree, fubfervient to the
other; and that the motion of the heavenly bodies, variegated and quali-
fied by a coincidence of their beams, is the real medium by which the
affairs of this world are influenced and direCled; and where~ the atten-
tive reader, from obfervatiqn alone, might be enabled to pred1Cl: the prin-
cipal occurrences of any man's life, from a bare infpeaion of his nativity.
According to this fpeculation, we find the Moon in earthy figns, apply-
ing to the terms of Mars, near the. place of the.Pleiades, at the time this
prince was nine years old. The natural inference to be drawn from this
afpea is, a broken limb, a violent bruife, or fome accidental affiiaion ;
accordingly we find the native, when this direCl:iou came up, had the mif-
fortune to break his arm. ·
Again, at ten years of age, he was affiiCled with. the jaundice, and
fuffered greatly by a fever. Thefe are the difeafes ·of Mars ; and the

. In the year 165'7; the.King ·of.Spain affifted the native with money
to the amount of one hundred thoufand pouuds. The direaion then
operating exaCtly points out the circumfiance, which was the Sun to the
trine of Jupiter. In the year 1685, the native died. The direCtion
which produced his deatb·, was Saturn, the Anareta, to the oppofition of
the Sun, the Giver of Life.
If we compare the geniture of this illuftrious prince with that of the
king his father, we ihall find the afcendant of that nativity to. be the
place of Mars in this. Secondly, the Dragon's Tail, in the geniture
of this native, is upon the place of the Sun in the other. Thirdly, the
Sun in the geniture of the father is in oppofition to himfelf in the geni-
ture of the fon. Fourthly, the Sun in this nativity is in quartile to the
place of Jupiter .in the other; arguments, which ferve abundantly to
lhow, that the father and the fon lhould both be involved in one and
the fame unfortunate quarrel; that the father lhould fall a viCtim to its
rancour, whilft the fon thould rife fuperior to the enemies of. them
both, and be reinflated in the hereditary rights of the crown, and in

of Mars in the year 1650, and the Moon to a quartile with the .Part of
Fortune,. which influx likewife produced a violent fevc:r,_and a remark-
able laffitude of the whole human frame. The native was then in his ·
feventeenth year.
In I 653, this prince headed a wing of the army in Flanders, and re-
ceived a dangerous wound. . It was in its nature not mortal; but, being
accompanied with a violent fever, the dangerous fymptoms were increafed,
and the native's life ii1 confequence defpaired of. This was produced
by the be;uns of the Sun, when lord of the afcendant, direCted to the
bofiile rays of a perfeCt quartile of Mars. Another fever was produced
by the Moon direCted to the body of Mars, and the Sun to the body of
Saturn, which attacked the native in the year i'667,. when .no perfon
expeCted he would have furvived. Thefe configurations ferve to thow,
that, fr-om the radical conftitution .of the feveral lignificators in the
figure of birth, the native was more liable to fevers than to any oth~r
complaint. From the fame fource of information.we.likewife difcover,
that this prince was fubjeCt to weak ey~s . and·_imP.erfeCl fight. This is
declared by the quartile pofition of the two·lumir1aries to each other; the
one being. placed near nebulous ftars,. and the other in familiar congrefs
with ·ftars of a violent nature.. · · ..
Anno Domini I·68s, this prince fucceeded to the crown of Great
Britain. This. is prediCted by the planet Jupiter to a.favourable coujullc-
tion of Mars in the medium·c~li, . or tenth houfe, the houfe of honour,
~lory, and·preferment. , But here the influx of Mars, who is the minor
mfortunc,_moft aptly points .out to us, that, though he is brought by the
primum mobile to. a concidence with the benefic beams of the princely
ftar Jupiter., and·bears teftimony to his coronation, yet the confequences
wouldfavour very much ofthe evils wherein.this malefic planet is obferved
to delight.
' .
So many crofs and unpropitious direCtions as we find in this.nativity
are at firft fight fufficient to convince us, that the unhappy native would
drink deep of the bitter cup of difappointmcnt and affliCtion. . To juf-
tify the remark, requires only to advert to the private and public auec-
dotes of this prince, who, though be lived to the age of fixty-feven
years, enjoyed but a very moderat~ thare of health, and ftill lefs oL
bappinefs.

This nativity is worthy the miuuteft attention of every reader. for the
fingularity of its no~le. and itlufirious configurations; and whereby a good
and profperous geniture might be readily diftinguithed from thofe of' an
unfortunate and adver(e defiguation.
. The firft dire<!\ion material .for us to examine in the ~ve ~~uiture,
ts the afcendant to the quarttfe ray& ·of, Saturn, pofited m Artes i th.c
greateft dignities of Mars. Under this malefic inftux the native was
taken with the {malt pox, and very narrowly efcaped with his life,
which we fee proteCled by the fuperior ftreng,th of the benevolent J\lpi-
ter in the afcendant, and the vivifying rays of the Sun unafffiCled in the
tenth houfe.
In the twenty..fidl: year ·of his age, be was appointed to an. ardu_
ous
,em~loyment in the Lo.w Countries; in the execution of which he in-
creafed iu reputation, honour, and fame. The Moon was then direCted
to the eminent fiar Oculus Tauri ; whieh has the mod uatural de-
flgnation of this fortunate occurrence. ln his thirty-firlt yea~, he
was made captain in the hor{e-g.uards. He had then in his aativit,-
the afceodant dired:ed to the trine afpeCl o( Venus, in the fign Taurus,
her chief dignity and exaltation., whereby thefe two e,minent promotions
are found to correfpond., and to be the refult of each other. When the
.oative was tbirtx-two l'ears or~ he was honoured with t~ ~ommancl
of a regiment.. To denote this. preferment, he bac.f the midbeaveQ
di're8ed to the fextile .a(pell of Mars; ·and this itt Capricorn~ his
exaltation ; a ver1 s_r.eat ar&ument -Qf {uccefs in mattial .hQOQUfS ami
.atchieveme.nt$. ·
At thirty-'five years of age, this native was unfortunately worfted in
:an engagement, and taken prifoner.. The Sun was then direa-ed to a
conjunCtion ofSaturn.; and the Moon had nearly formed a quartile afpeel
with Mars. The firfi direClion fell in the twelfth houfe; and Saturn,
~the promittor., w.as then lord -of t.he twelfth.

Oo the 28th of January, 1641, he was firft impeached in the boufe
of commons ; the Moon was at this time in oppofition · of Saturn's
place, and Mars poffcffed the Sun's place in the radix. On the 30th of

in the other; and the _Moon's place is precifely the fame ,in .both. Such
an harmony and fimilar coincidence of matter in the temperature .and
endowments of thefe two natives; could not but produce that remarkable
concurrence of judgment, and fa~iliarity of fentiment, which was uni-
formly difcovered in the actions and manners of thefe eminent perfons.
. '
This illufirious uati've was not without his 1hare of private enemies,
who ufed every means· to alienate the king's good opinion and f&vour
from him. But vain was the attempt; for, where the heavens form
an u~ity of fentiment, it is beyond the fubtlety of human invention to
diffolve it.
. In the year I 61.7, on the 2 ith of July, this native being then near
thirty~five years _old·,· embarked for the 'Ifie of Rhe. The fuccefs of this
undertaking by no ~~·~ans anfwered the expeCtations that had been formed:
of.it; and. which was; before-hand. but too :evident ; for, on the very day
he fet fail, ·Mars was· in exaCt quartile to his afcendant at birth, and to
the Sun~s place .alfo; the Moon was.in·quartile to the place of Mars and
Venus, andto the Sun; and in oppofition. of Jupiter; all ~-hich unfortu-
nate pofitions previoufly declared the expedition to be .~. unfuccefsful-as-
it eventually proved.· . · · · · · . . .- .
In the year I 628, on the 23d of Augufi, this native, being uear thirty-
fix years old, was bafely affaffinated and fi:abbed at the Crown Inn, in
Portfmouth, by ·a ruffian of the name of Felton. The Moon was that-
day in quartile :of the afcendaot at birth; :and the Sun .in the radical place
of Mars; and, in. the revolutional figure for that year, the .Moon was in
exaa quartile of Mars and Jupiter. And, befides this ,congrefs of male-
fic tranfits, which in themfelves were alone. fufficient.to deftroy life, there
was a fatal direction operating at the fa·me time; of the afoendant:to the
body of Mars. The grand argument of a violent death.in this nativity,
is the conjunCtion of the Sun and Mars in quartile to the lord of the:
eighth houfe, who is in conjunCtion of that violent fixed fiar, the Heart
of the Scorpion.

Libra afcends the eaftern horizon of this nativity, which is a fign of
jufiice and mercy. Mercury, the true patron of fcience and learning, is
in conjunCtion of Spica Virginis, in the afcendant; and Jupiter is in the
ninth houfe, with Oculus Taurus in trine to Mercury, and the Moon and
Venus are in.friendly trine with the cufp of the angle of honour and
dignity, and enjoy the fame benign configuration with each other, and
that from good places of the figure. To thow that the native would
be learned and pious, there are feveral ftars of the nature of Jupiter and
Mars culminating, which in many genitures have been found to raife the
native even from the loweft degree in the church to the highefi: honours·
and preferments of ecclefiaftical jurifdiClion and authority.
Another argument of the epifcopal dignity of this divine, is deduced
from the circumfiance of cardinal figns poifeffing the principal angles.of
the figure: for, as the greateft actions of the world depend on the car..;,
dina} points of the heavens, viz. Aries, Cancer, Libra, and Capricorn, fo
the moft eminent perfons, fuch as rife to honour and preferment highly
fuperior to their birth and expeCl:ancies, have thofe cardinal points upon
all the angles of their nativities. Thus it was in the geniture of Cicero,
whofe parentage, if authors may be credited, was fo obfcure as fcarcely
to be known; yet was be elevated to fuch a pitch of honour, as to be
called " the father of his country." And thus it was with Oliver Crom-
well ; and may be feen in the genitures of a thoufand others, who have
rifen highly fuperior to all their contemporaries, by having thefe cardinal
1igns thus fortunately pofited on the angles of their figure of birth, with
other concording teftimonies of dignity and tlonour.
If we carefully examine the conftitutiou of this figure, we 1hall find
the caufe of this native's imprifonment, misfortunes, and violent death,
to be very naturally pointed out. The lord of the twelfth houfe pofited
in the ·afcendant, gives many malicious private: enemies, and d_enot~s

imprifonment,.founded on .the principles of fiilfe teftimony. of-treachery,
and deceit. .Befides ·this:, the fiery planet Mars is upon the cufp of the
twelfth boufe, in oppofition to the Moqn, and in quartile to her·own dif-
pofitor; and: that he 1hould die a violent and premature death, is obvicrus·
from the pofition of Mars in oppofition to the Moon, and ·the lady of the
afcendant pofited in a violent fign in conjuntlion of Saturn, lord of the'
fourth houfe. .
The mid-heaven :direfled to the body of Mars, was the occafion of
this native•s imprifonmerit; and, according to Mr. Oadbury, frotri whom·
moft of thefe nativities are taken, Saturn direCted to the conjunCl:ion .of
the afcendant )\•as· the caufe of his death. . But, according to the tf'fle
Placidian method, the Sun muft be ·dire8ed ·for death, becaufe he is
Hyleg~ and Mars is undoubtedly the Anareta. · For a proof of this, let
the revolutional figure for the year of the native's death be examined,
wh~re we filall find Mars in conjunction with the Sun, and Saturn lo-
cated in the fixth houfe, in the fign Aries, the houfe of Mars ; fo
that the two infortunes contributed to the untimely death of this cele-
brated divine, who for learning and abilities· was equalled by few, arid
excelled by none. · . - ·. · · ·

Tb~ nativity_ of :C~rnelius ~grippa, as handed to us from :the ancients,
is difplayed in the annexed Plate. But, as this geniture has been confi-
dered, by all the profeffors of the aftral fcience, not authentic, (which
indeed appears b~t. t,oo obvious from the .difcordancy of its parts, and from
the ~mpoffibility of its admitting the 'tell: of rectification,) I decline giving

We have no· right, if we credit Ca_rdan and Lyndbolt, to quefiion the
time of this celebrated native's birth. The figure exaCl:ly correfponds
with the defcription of his perfon given us by Plutarch, which is that
of a lean, weak, and fickly, temperature and confritution ; and is aptly
enough declared by the Moon in Capricorn in the fixth houfe, the being _
lady of the afcendant, and Saturn her difpofitor in quartile of the Sun,
and Mercury approaching the afcendant from fixed figns. Now concern-
ing his mamaers and gift of fpe~cb, Cardan defcribes him to have pof-

feffed a loud and clear articulation, but that it was barth, and the le~
captivating, on account. of the deficiencies of his perfon and manner,
which wanted grace and comelinefs. This feems well prenotcd by the
conjunCtion of Venus and Mercury in the afcendant, afHiCled by the pre-
fence of the Dragon's Tail, accompanied with Saturn's quartile combuft
of the Sun.
The honour and reputation which this native acquired arc reprefcnted
in a very thiking manner, by the effential dignities of the Sun, in trine
afpetl: with Mercury, Venus, and Mars, in the angle of dignity, and fo-
vereignty ; the Sun likewife having his exaltation therein. Jupiter, who
is lord of the ninth, is in conjunClion alfo of Saturn. in the fifth houfe,
and thence emitting his benign rays to the afcendant, which is an addi-
tional argument of very important acquifitions in the fcalc of honour and
preferment.
Plutarch tells us, that Cicero's nurfe was admonithed by a vifion to
beftow the utmoft care and attention upon the child then at her b.rcaft ; .
for that he thould become the moft diftingui1hed charaClcr amongft all ·
the Romans ; and yet he was but the fon of a bond-woman, ~nd of mean
extraCt. This prediCtion, however, whether imaginary or real, was lite-
rally fulfilled ; for he was twice made conful of Rome, ~nd for the timely
difcovery and prevention of Catiline's confpiracy he was furnamed by
Cato " The father of his country." He died by affaffioation in the fixty-
fourth year of his age, having futfered the chief misfortune$ ofhis life.in

As to the manners, temperature, and confiitution, of this native, he
was melancholy and choleric, occafioned by an earthy fign occupying his
afcendant, and Saturil"s 'pofition being in ·an ea"'rthy fign alfo. The Moon
with martial fixed :fiars bf the fame nature. in the a.fcenaant, is a further
teO:imony of a choleric habit ; but the greateft proof of a fuperabund.ance
of choler in the native's conftitution, is the Sun's ·reception with Mars
from violent figns, which declares tha.t choler lhould overpower the me-
lancholy huq1our; and become predominant. . As to his underftauding
and mental acqi.iir~mtnts, Mercury, the patron of Ingenuity,' &c. is the
mofi ·potent ~lan¢t: ·iii ,-the horofcope; and, being pofited in Scorpio,
the houfe of Mars, aud.fo .near the invigorating beams of Venus, is
an evident demonftriitiop .that the qative 016uld be 'of an excellent

As to matters of eftate, he had the fixed fign Aquaries on the cufp ofthe
fecond houfe, and the Moon and Jupiter cafiing their friendly rays to the
fame point, with the fortunate node of the Moon in the houfe of Jupiter;
all which are tefiimonies of a competent fortune. Yet, oppofed to this,
we find the lord of the fecond houfe retrograde, upon the cllfp of the
fourth, in quartile to the fecond, and Venus his difpofitrix combufi, in
quartile of Mars, and in quartile to the fecond, alfo ; which are plain
demonfirations of the lofs of fubfiance, and of the decay of his paternal
patrimony. And hence we find that Mars affiicting Mercury with the
Part of Fortune in an obf<;ure part of the heavens, and the Sun lord
thereof in oppofition to Saturn, influenced him to fquander away his
efiate, both carelefsly and improvident1y, even to the {hocking extremi~y
of refiraint or imprifoument. This gave occafion to that jocular faying of
his brethren of the faculty, that poor Culpeper was forely afflicted with a
con.fumptiotl ofthe purft.
However fevere this reflection might be confidered, its application
was but too jufr. At the univerfity, he was as free with his purfe as with
his pen; and cared not how little was left for hirnfelf, fo that he could
effect the happinefs or welfare of others. And really, if he had not
had the Dragon's Head in the fecond houfe of his geniture, he would have
been perpetually poor; for the arguments of poverty in his radix are fo
uncommonly firong, through the propenfity of his will, that, bad he been
born to the moft ample efi:ate, he would in a 1bort time have fquandered
it away, and become pennylefs.
As to the native's kindred and 1bort journeys, Mars is the principal
fignificator thereof; and his pofition in the eighth is the moll: unfortunate
place in the whok heavens. He is likewife in quartile of four planets,
viz. the Sun, Venus, Saturn, and Mercury; which is a further proof
of great unhappinefs to the native from family-difputes; and promifes no
great fuccefs in his ihort and inland journeys. Again, we find Aries upon
the cufp of the third houfe, and Mars pofited in a fteril fign, which
fhows a deficiency of brothers and fifi:ers, or no harmony with them, in
cafe of any. It were needlefs to repeat the many misfortunes this na-
tive fuftained on account of his relations ; or to recount the perils and
dangers he encountered upon fome of his journeys ; it being fufficient
to confirm the verity of this art, by affirming that he never gained any ad-
vantage by either.
With regard to his parents, we find Saturn the general figni6cator '
of fathers, and Venus the reprefentative ot mothers, are in oppofition ;
and
.,__ .-... -

and Mars, lord of the tenth houfe, in quartile to them both, from fixed
figns, which clearly ihows that the parents of this native would die be-
fore he was of age; but, had they lived till he had come to years of ma-
turity, I do not fee how he would have been bettered by them, fiuce
their fignificators are every why found fquaring and oppofing his. By
the account he himfelf gives of his parents, they died while he was
young, and his mother's relations cheated him out of a good part of his
eftate. ·
As to the fignificators of wife and children, we have the Moon, lady
of the feventk houfe, in a double-bodied fign, which feems to prefage
two wives; but Venus, a general fignificatrix of wives, being combufi of
the Sun, in an evil afpect of the infortunes, oppofes this influence fo pow-
erfulJy, that, did the not cafi a prolific beam to the afcendant, and another
to the feventh houfe, the native would fcarcely have ever married at all.
Under thefe circumftances we deduce an argument for one wife only, which
happened in courfe. ·
Venus governing the fifth houfe in Scorpio, a fruitful fign, irradi-
ating both the afcendant and feventh, promifes the native many chil-
dren. But Caput Medufre being upon the cufp of the fifth, and Venus
combuft, in oppofition to Saturn, and in quartile of Mars, in the houfe
of death, declares that very few if any of tliem fuould live. It afterwards
turned out, that the native had but one wife, and by her he had feven
children, but they all died young, except a daughter, who lived to years
of maturity.
The native's public and private enemies are fignified by the Moon
and Jupiter; but principally by Jupiter himfelf, becaufe he hath great
dignities in the twelfth and feventh houfes. Mars has alfo a ihare in
the defignation of his enemies, becaufe he is ii1 trine of Jupiter, and iu
fextile of the Moon, and beholds the lord of the afcendant with a quar-
tile ray. Now it is well .known that Mars reprefents phyficians, apo-
thecaries, &c. and Jupiter divin'~s; and tbofe two defcriptions of men
were really found to be the great~ft enemies of the native, both public
and private: the faculty hated hilh _
for fimplifying the art of medicine ;
and the ·church contemned him,lor his fuperior knowledge in the aftral
fcience. Yet neither of them d.Qrft venture to difpute with him upon the
fimplicity of the one, or the .reality of the other, notwithftanding he
gave feveral public challenges to both the colleges, to enter the lifts with
them.· ·

it fomewhat probable the native may die of a confumption, or by decay
of natural firengtb and !lamina. However this may he, he died on Mon-
day the 10th of January, I 65.4-, when the Moon was in quartile to the
radical place of Mars, and the Sun in quartile to his own and to Saturn's
place in his nativity; Saturn and Jupiter at the fame time beholding each
other with an oppofition. From this pofition of the figuificators, it has
been thought by fome, that he was malicioufly poifoned; and indeed, by
the above configurations, it is not unlikely but fome of the Etculap.ian
tribe had a hand in his death. ·
The accidents or events by which this nativity is ret1i6ed are thefe. At
eighteen years old, he went to the univertity: the Sun was then direCted
to the body of Mercury, and the afcendant to the fextile of the fame pro-
mittor. At twenty-four years old, he particularly applied himfelf to the
fiudy of phyfic: the Moou was then direth:d to the trine of Mercury, her
difpofitor, in the radical figure of birth. At the age of twenty-feven
years be went into the army, and was wounded by a mufket-iliot in the
fore part of his body, of which he never recovered to the day of his death:
at the time of this accident, the afcendant came to the quartile of the Sun,
and foon afterward' to the quartile of Saturn, which prolonged and conti-
nued the malady. In the thirty-eighth year of his age, he died: the af..
cendant then came to the oppofition of Mars with latitude. Upon exa-
mining and comparing the revolution·a] figure with the radical horofcope,
we find the fi:rictefi: agreement betwixt them: Saturn paffes the radical
place of Mars, and re-occupies the afcendaut; the Sun and Jupiter behold
each other with a quartile ray; and Jupiter comes in oppofitiou to the
place of Mars, and in quartile to his own radical place Jikewife: whicb
evil revolutions, agreeing with malefic directions, necefiarily prefigure
approaching death.

We have here the geniture of a perfon of an uncommon defire for fearch-
ing into the occult myfieries, and for obtaining a knowledge of all the cu-
rious arts. This propegfity is very aptly defcribed by the great firength of
Mercury, lord of the afcendant, in his exaltation, in fextile to Jupiter, and
in trine afpeCl: of the Sun, whereby the mental endowments of the native
far excelled the common lot of mankind.
He wrote many curious books, which are now very fcarce and valua-
ble. His Temple of Wifdom, Holy Guide, Harmony of the World,
Rofie-Crucian Phyfic, and feveral other myfiical pieces equally curious,
being far above the common fcope of clafficallearning, were equally ad-
mired, envied, and abufed, as bell: fuited the purpofe of each different
reviewer. This is aptly defcribed by the quartile of the Sun and Mars,.
the Sun at the fame time beholding the afcendant with the fame afpect,
and Saturn beholding Jupiter with a quartile from cardinal figns. Mars
pofited in the afcendant, in quartile with the Sun, very aptly denotes
imprifonment, refulting from the frowns and ill-hum<>ur of great per-
fans, or men in power. This difgrace really happened to the native, in
the troublefome times of King Charles, who detefied him for the truths-
he told.
I iliall omit entering into any particulars upon his nativity, becaufe he
has publithed it himfelf in the completeft manner in his Harmony of the
World, to which I beg leave to refer the curious reader. He married
the widow of Nicholas Culpeper.

Mr. Partridge having taken great pains in the calculation ofthi~ nativity,
and worked up its feveral direttions according to the Placidian method, it
were needlefs for me to go over the fame ground, or to repeat any thing
more in this place, than a few of the principal accidents whereby the ho-
rofcope of his birth is reaified, or proved to be radically true.
At·eighteen years and ten months old, the Sun came to the parallel of
Saturn in his nativity, by the rapt motion. At this time the native was
afBitled with a furfeit, accompanied with a violent intermittent fever.
In the year 165t, when the native was twenty three years and three
months old, he was married. This happened under the dire8ion of the
Moon to the fextile of the Sun in mundo, by direCt dire8ion. ·
When the native was fifty-one years and eight months old, he was im-
prifoned. The dire8ion that brought this up was the mid-heaven to the
body of Saturn.
At the age of fifty-nine years and ten months, the native was married
the fecond time. The dire8ion producing this hymeneal contraa was
the mid-heaven to the triangular rays of Venus.
When the native was fixty-two years and eight months old, he was in-
volved in great trouble, and fuffered confinement. This was brought to
pafs under the influence of the Sun, dire8ed to the parallel of Saturn in
the.zodiac, by oblique afcenfion.
At the end of feventy-feven years and three months from the day of his
birth, viz. March 23, I 704-t the native departed this life. The direc-
tion which foretels his death, is Mars to the parallel of Saturn, by the
rapt motion, whereby the aphetical and anaretical beams, falling into one
focus, abforbed the vital fpirit, and feparated the effence from the material
body.

Jefs than four planets effentially dignified ; viz. the Sun, Jupitf1r, Venus,
and the Moon ; two of them in their exaltation,. and two in their own

which not only procure credit and fame, but conftitutc the natural and

immediately after {uch conjunCtion was formed, heightened by the beams

When this native was between nine and ten years of age, he had the
fmall pox; at which time the Moon wa-s directed to the Vii:"gin's Spike,

In the middteofAugufr, 16+41; aged ten·Jears and ten ·months, the na-
tive was afflicted with a violent fpotted fever and fore throat: this was
produced by the afcendant to the oppofition of Mars. At fourteen years
of age he had a tertian ague; this was the afcendant to the quartile of
Saturn.
When fourteen years and fix months old, the native entered into the
army: this inclination is pointed out by the Sun to the quartile of Mars
in Scorpio. At feventeen years old, he had a dangerous fall from a
horfe, and was likewife in danger of being drowned: this is defcribed
by the conjunCtion of the Moon and Mercury in the eighth houfe. In
September, 1652, the native was fettled in a regular line of bufinefs; and
then the trine afpeCt of Mars came to the mid-heaven. In April, 1654,
the native went a journey to London, and was taken ill with a fever and
furfeit: this was produced by the conjunCtion of the Sun and Moon in the
eighth houfe.
On the firft of May, in the year 1656, the native entered. into the
holy fiate of matrimony : this was occafioned by the force of the af-
cendant dire8ed :to the oppofition of Vemas; which ihows likewife, that

~uration with refpect to the life of the bride.; . This marriage, however,
produced one child, which was born in June, 1657, \Ulder the afcendant
directed to the quartile of Jupiter in a fruitful fign.
On the 24tn of April, 166o, the native was married the fecond time,
under the iqfluence of the afcendant to the Dragon's Head; which, being
a good benevolent direCtion, produced a good .wife, and a happy marriage.
On the 3d of September, 166~, the native had a fon by this lady, born
under the afcendant directed to the trine of Saturn in Sagittarius and Aries,
which are both mafculine figns. '
In the Jear 1663, the native publiihed his Ciavis Elmata, uncier the
di.reetion of the Sun in the fextile of Mercury. In May, I 672, he had a
thort but violent fever, which feemed to threaten life. This was produced
by the afcend,ult to the oppofition of the Sun. Upon his recovery, he
. greatly enlarged and improved his Ciavis Elmata; at which time the Moon
came by directiotl to the mid-heaven. In the year I 673, the native firft
wrote and. publilhed his fo much celebrated Almanac: the mid-heaven
was then in trine,of the Moon.
Thefe are the accidents given by Mr. Coley himfelf, for the purpofe of .
reClifyi~g ·ar!d difplaying his nativity; and are therefore· to· be relied on.
Had th1s emment profeffor of Aftrology undcrftood the power of mundane
afpeCls and parallels, he ·would bave avoided many abfurdir~s which ap-
pear in his works, and.giv~u lefs occaiion· fQr cavil and exultation to the
enemies of the fcie.nce. ·.
Upon the whole, this nativity promifes much on the fcore of ingenuity
and invention, ar1d has ·many teftimonies ·of confequeot reputation and
emineDce. Firfi, Mercury i$ dire~, and fwift of ~QUr{e, and in reception

arity with another cmine1ft fixed fiar: thi~ tudcbws the native wi~h a lively
imagination, and au excellent invention. Fourthly, Mercury's triangular
rays caft to the afcendant multiplies all thefe arguments, and ftrengthens
his title to pu~iic efrimation and regard.

heaven, which fcarcely ever fails to produce public fame and reputation;
and, bein~ in afpcCl: with an eminent fixed frar, thows that the native will
never live in obfcurity or difefreem. Secondly,.Jupiter, lord of the mid•
heaven, is in his exaltation, in trine of the Sun, which is a moll: iJlufrrious
configuration. Betides, the Sun being iu reception of Mars proves that
the native thall be in high efreem with the public. Yet Saturn's malefic
pofition in the mid-heaven mull: needs reduce the happy effeCl:s ofthe fore-
going indulgent fiars, and give fome caufe of vexation and di1appointment.
Saturn being lord of the twelfth, the houfe of private enemies and impri•
fonmcnt, and being pofited iu the tenth, denotes many frrong aud:pow-
erful enemies, and ihows fome refrraint of liberty, witb temporary lofs
of honour and reputation ; yet it neverthelefs demonfrrates that honour
1hall eventually court him, and the malignity of his enemies be totally
batHed.
The pofition of Mars in the feventh·h~ufe, in oppofition to the afcend..
ant, renders the native obnoxious to a particular defcription of men ;
which is alfo confirmed by the Sun's platic quartile to the afceudant, and
the Moon's pofition in the feventh houfe, in platic quartile to the mid-
heaven and to Saturn. But, fince Mars and the Sun both .befriend the
native in a far more powerful degree than they afflict him, it is apparent
that all confequent difputations will in the end turn out to the '1ative's

It is here worthy of remark, that this pofition of Mars in the feventh
houfe is to be found in the nativities of three eminent profeffors of the
afrral fcience, who were all contemporaries in the lafi age; namely, John
Gadbury, William Lilly, and this native, Henry Coley; all of whom
had frrong oppofitions to encounter with their enemies ; but they lived
to triumph over them, and to fee their extirpation from the laud of the
living.

find Mars in his exaltatiQn, and in reception of Saturn, with the Moon ir1
oppofition to one, and in quartile to the other. This configuration gave
the native a very acute and fatirical turn of mind. The flrokes of his pen,
when diretted againfr his enemies, were poignant and fevere; and, even
when drawn in behalf of his friends, he could not help expofing their in-
advertencies, and attacking their weak fide.
In the grand endowments of folid fenfe and underfianding, this native
was in no refpea deficient; as is apparent by the fituation of Mercury,
with the Sun, in the fcientific fign Aquaries; both which fignificators
being in the trine of the Moon, and in fextile of their difpofitor Sa-
turn, afford the highefi: proofs of a mind enriched with every brilliant
endowment.
That the native lhould be rich and fortunate, and arrive to the pinnacle
of honour and preferment in human life, is apparent, from the pofition of
the two fortunate planets, which behold each other in a fextile configura-
tion, whilfi: the Moon, lady of the eleventh houfe, the lord of the medium..;-·
cedi, and the vital Sun, behold each other in a benefic trine. · But this
nativity bav'11g been already mofi: completely invefi:igated, renders it un-
neceffary for me to fpeak of its direCtions.

Upon the afcendant of this nativity, we find the fign Leo impedited
by the evil and malignant planet Saturn, which exattly defcribes the
native's perfon. Mercury and Jupiter being in oppofition to each other,
yet both in their own dignities, is a remarkable proof that the native's
wit and judgment ihould be vitiated; but the Moon feuding a trine
afpea to Jupiter, and a fextile to Mercury, corretts this evil influence,
and affills the native greatly. Yet, as the is difpofed of by Mars in the
twelfth houfe, it declares his enemies would be very powerful, and but
. too fuccefsful againft him. His public enemies are defcribed by Saturn
and Mars; and the Moon perfonates his wife, and fuch as he once

In the year I 6oo, and in the twentieth of his age, he was created Maller

The nativity of this eminent divine was .found after his death in his
pocket-book, written by his own hand; and. having been fpoken of ·by
many profdfors of the·fcience, can receive but little new -light from my
pen.
This native was committed to the Tower, with eleven other bidlops,
when in the fixty-feventh year of his age. He had then operating the
Dragon's Tail to the midhcaven; and tbe continuance of his imprifon-
meot is mofr aptly denoted by the teftimony of the lord of the afceodant
in the twelfth boufe, which is the only light of time above the earth. His
death happened in the eighty.fecond year of his age, under the anareric
influence of a quartile of the Sun and Moon.

GEORGE III. KING ·o:r GREAT BRITAIN.
Were I to enter minutely into a calculation of this nativity, the .event
might be prejudicial to many, and draw upon me the contempt of fome
and the refentment of others. Therefore, fince it is my with to give
offence to no party, nor to fi:ir up the embers of firifc and diffenfion
amongfi: the different orders. of fociety, I 1hall content myfelf with
making only a few remarks, whereby the inquifitive r~~er may be led
to a contemplation of thofe ce)efiial influences, which fiir~lUlate . and
govern the aClions and purfuits of men, and form .the ~fJS:. of all fublu-
nary events.
Upon the oriental horizon of this ilJufi:rious .geniture;··we. find the
noble and princely fign Leo afcending, with Caput Algol and the ~ne­
fic Jupiter moll gloriouOy elevated in the medium..c~li, the houfe of
kingly honour, eminence, and unbounded-fovereignty; which ~re true
emblems ofthat univerfal joy, of that glory, honour, and renown, where-
with his majefty moft defervedly afcended the Britith throne. As to the
fignificators of temperature and difpofition, no geniture ill the .world ever
produced more evident proofs of that rc8itude of principle, of that bene-
volence of heart and mind, of that regard to jufi:ice, mercy, and truth,
which affimiJates the human nature to the divine image of ~he Deity,
and forms the interior of a -patriot king. That the refult uniformly
kept pace with this defignation, .lam fure·no, goo4 ~~n, .nor any loyal
fubjea, will deny. .
Th.e mofi: remarkable circumfiance in this geniture is the congrefs for-
med in .th,e eJeventh houfe; which it is my with that .every fcicntific rea•
der would .pay particular regard to; and I have no doubt but they will
readily make.out, by the rules heretofore given; ·a pretty corrca prefage
of all..the principal public occurrences that happened..during his. late
majefty's reign.
Whoever turns to page I 6o of this work, will find it laid down as a
fundamental principle in the rules of this fcier1ce,. that, by ~the con.Qitu-
tion of the eleventh houfe, that is, of the configurat~) f~~ed therein,
we deduce all enquiries concerning .friends. and ·frieRdthip,. bPpe, tp,i(f,
expeCtation, or defire; alfo whatever relates to tht fi~elity ·~ perfidiquf.

I would now with the planets in the eleventh houfe to be well confi-
dered, their tendency ~nd defign.ation aftertained., and compared with the
revolutional figures of the royal horofcope, in thofe years when any re-
markable national event Game to pa.fs. The refult would not fail to en~
lighten the underftanding of moft men, and woutd lead the m-ind to an
unalienable love and attachment to tqe p~rfon and family of our mo~
gracious fovereign.
For example~ let the radical horok:ope,. the revolutional. figure for the.:
thirty-eighth year of his majefty's life, and the fcheine of the American_
rera of independence, be projected by the fide of each oth~r: let the car-
dinal houfes be well conlidered, with the manner in which they afpect or·
irradiate each other; and give the refpeClive fignificators, as their poll-.
t·ions are found to vary, their tt·ue and genuine implication, according to
the known and efiablithed rules of the fcienc:e; and I am bold to fay,
that no one will be at a lofs to ac~ount for tho{e unhappyevents,. which:
have feldom been attributed to the right caufe.
The NATIVITY of our Bleffed LORD and SAVIOUR
JESU~ CHRIST.
Upon this nativity I £hall not veuture to give any opinion of my own•.
It was calculated above a century ago, by thilt lcatned and ingenious au-
thor, Dr. John Butler, chaplain to James d~ke of Ormond, and reClor.
of Lichborough, in the county and diocefe of Lichfield.. He publiihed.
it in an Svo. volume, with a very learned and ingenious introduCtion~
fttpported by a fet of Chronological Tables calculated to pll\_ce the d~y
and hour of our Saviour's birth at a certainty beyond difpute; and', as
that book has been many years out of print, and is now become very
fcarce and valuable, I hav~ thqught prope.r to G.opy. th~t par-t ofit wbicn
contains the immediate calcllla~ion of thi$ nativity, in the doctor's own
WOf'ds, without adding to or diminiihing from the text, or prefuming _
to·
introduce any remarks of my own. · · ·
The geniture, or figure of biRh, difplayed in the anne~d P,late, was.
alfo l?rojeCted by this learned author, whicp I have caufed to be ~arefully
engraved from ·a copy correet~d by the dOCtor's own ha.Jld ;, an4.1flatter
_myfelf, that the reputation which this traa has, acquired in.every part of
Eur:ope, added to the refpeaability alld eminence of its ~u.thor,. will not .
fail to render it highly.acceptable, to the reader. The following extraa,·

That we may fee at length how fitly the nativity of Jefus Chrit1: fuit&:
with all paffages of his life, as alfo with his qualities and complexion, we
mQfi: fir!\ elJ;amine how the accidents of his life do lead us, as the ftar did
the wife men, to the place, and to the moment of time when he was
born. That Jefus was born at Bethlehem in Judea is pall: difpute. · Here
the longitude is commonly reputed different from the meridian of London
in England (for which place our tables are framed) two hours and forty·
fix minutes : and by fo much time, it feems, it is twelve of the clock af
midnight with them fooner than it is with us. Here alfo, as is vulgarly
cfieemed,. the pole is elevated at· the ncare(t gueiS fome thirty-one degrees.
of north latitude and fifty minutes. Now the time, as it is efteemed vul-.
garly, wherein Chrift was born under this elevation, was the night be-
fore Saturday the twenty.-fifth of December, in the 4714th Julian year,.
tnding at what time the cycle of the fun was nine, and of the moon.
on~ ; and, the year. being biffextile,_,he dominicalletters were DC.
Now, that out of this night we may procure the certain. moment where·
in the blcffed birth happened, we muft firft afcertain the accidents of hiS;
life. Anti thefe are as follow : Fir-ft, his birth happened in an honour-.
able hour ; for on that very uight both angels and- men came in to adore
him. Secondly, in the fame year, and. about forty days after be was
born, perfecution followed, and he was forced,. young as.he was, to fly
for his life into Egypt. Thirdly, his return ou_t of Egypt happened at
almoft, or about;two years of age.
At twelve years of age and fome hundred days over, he had great ho-.
nour and praife by difputation with the doCtors in the temple at J~ru(a~
lem. At about twenty-five years of age, according to Suidas, he was
c.onfiit~ted a priel.l of the or<ter· of th~ four-and-twenty. At fix daya.

over twenty-nine complete years, he was baptized, and entered into his
minifiry ; and at the fame time he was forty days tempted Qf~the devil ;
and at the end of •thofc wa, very cootemptaoufly ..ca(l.out of Nazareth
by the rude rabble there. Yet, uotwithfi:anding, he was very well re-
ceived at Capernaum; and at Jerufalem he drove .the buyers and fellers
out of the t-emple. ..'\nd lafi:ly, after three years and three months fpent
in his minifiry, at thirty-two years of age and one hundred .and one days
over, he ·was crucified upon Mount Calvary, ~w~en .two thieves, and
died upon the crofs. But, although he lived unto that time, yet it was
about fix months fooner,. at what time the Jews confpir:ed againfi: him to
kill him at the feaft of tabernacles ; and about two months before the time
he was condemned by the Sanhedrim, and a. proclamation was"ilfued out
to take him. Now may we find a time, according to the experienced
rules of art,,to fuit fitly .with all tbefe accidents, and fuch a.time as ihaU.
aptly·defcribc him to:be the mao that in Holy Writ he is fet forth to.be.

Now, as Cbrifi had a real body made of a woman, fo was it no fmall
argument ofthe reality of his body, that it fubmitted unto the impreftoo
ftons of the fiars, as do thofe of other men. For, although the immea-
furab]e power of the fpirit upon him was able to fway, and did fway, all
impreffions and inclinations of nature, fo as to fubjeCl: them abfolutely to
be obedient in all things unto the command of his holy will, yet were not
only the complexion of his body, but alfo the qualities of his mind and
affettions, much of them preffed and wrought by the power of the
heavens. Only excepted, that, whereas he was born without fin,
neither evil planets, nor evil afpetts of any planet, could. pave that
advantage to work upon his manners and diipofition, fo as to incline
them with fuch command as they do by others. But, -as for the acci-
dents of his life, in refpefl of what befel him, as for matter of love or
hatred, ficknefs and health, life and death, tbe fiars had as free and full
liberty and power over him and his body as upon any the 'leaft of us,
For, though he was able, by fpecial authority of his own, to force the ut.
moft power of fiars, or heaven, yet herein lay his humility, and his
charity in that humility, that he voluntarily fubmitted his body to be
ordered according to the courfe ef nature: whereas, would he himf~lf,
he might have made it lord over all that nature co,uld do. And, though
he raifed the bodies of others from death unto life, in defpite of nature, ·
yet would he fuffer his own bddy quie.tly to be ordered even as nature
would herfelf.
Thefe things confidered, next come we to meafure the time between
the accidents of life and time of birth. It is obferved, and a continued
experieuce has verified it according to ohfervation, that, (unlefs fome
fpecial interruption intervene, either by a tranfit, or fome revolution ut-
terly croffing,) from the fignificator in a nativity unto the promittor of
the thing fignified, there are ordinarily fo many times one year and five
days and eight hours as there .:are degrees either of afcention or defcen...
fton between the one and the other. The moft remarkable accident of
Chrifl:'s life, that we can work by, was his death, and the manner of it
at the end of thirty-two years and an .huudred and one days after birth.
·
To bring this about, the Moon claims nothing as a fignificator. The
Sun feems to proffer fomething, as if his direttion to the quartile of.tbe
Moon fhould proclaim fome fuch matter. But then the Sun, being
ueither giver of life nor years, in this noCturnal geniture, .could hardly
have fuffered fo fatally by that quartile, th~t death fhouM follow upon
it. And befides, upon examination it -appears, that the d.ireetion catne
up fome years too foon for thirty-two, in what pofition foever placed
\lnder. ground. And now therefore, if neither Sun nor MQon were

aadrs in fuffering that direful fate, then it folJows, that certainly it was
'that point of the fcheme which is called the afcendant. And, if fo, thet\
it was either the diretl:ion of the afcendant to the quartile of the Sun,
{and thu1 it was a ten-o'clock birth, and Virgo afcended ;) or it was the
;oppofition of Mars a quarter of an hour afte_r the fame~ Virgo afcending ;
or it was the oppofition of the Moon., and then was it a midnight birth,
and Libra afcended.; or it was to the oppofition of Saturn, and then was
~t a birth at almoft half an hour paft eight in the morning, and Scorpio
afcended. But, of all thefe, notie .will fuit with a defcription of the
perfon, and the other accidents of his life, but that of the a1cendant
to the conjuntl:ion of the Moon. ·The Moon at midnight of the fore-
mentioned day, we find in the fign Aries, and in twenty-eight degrees
and one minute thereof, UP,on the cufp of that which is called the eighth
hotife_ of heaven, or the houfe of death ; and there is the nea·r]y in con-
juntl:ion with .a ftar called Algol's Head, which is one of the:: moft ma-
lignant fiars in the whole heavens, and difpofed of by the planet Mars.
who is the lord of the i1ative's profeffed enemies, and alfo of death. The
-Moon ofherfelf is naturally a giver oflife; but, as the fits upon the houfe
of death, and difpofed of as the is, the fignifi.es a murderer: and, as for
the perfons the thould work it by, they are the common people and rude
· rabble, ane:l efpecially women, whom the naturally reprefeuts; and the:
chief magifirate ofthe place, whom alfo the reprefents by accident, by
virtue of that dominion which 1he claims in the ·tenth houfe, or houfe
of honour and dignity ; and fome ecdefiafiica1 perfon or perfons by acci-
dent alfo, as the has dominion in the ninth boufe; and lafi1y foldiers,
a's the is difpofed by Mars, who naturalJy fignifies men of war. Now,
all thefe fignifications fo fitly meeting in the Moon, and the fo aptly re-
prefenting a murderer, bow readily fiands the to ferve our purpofe? To
proceed therefore; we find the oblique de{cenfion of her in that degree
and minute to be two hundred and twelve degrees and fifty minutes:
but, if -we confider her latitude, the oblique defcenfion will prove two
hundred and thir-teen degrees and two minutes. Next, as for the time
when the afcendant fell under this direful diretl:ion, we muft allow fome
time for the fi:rength of confiitution, which this fcheme, pofited after
this manner, feems to aifor~ the native to wrell:Je with the firokes of
death. Fot' Jupiter, .a benevolent planet, lord of the fixtb, and in the
afcendant, together w.ith his .antifcions in the fixth and a fextile of the
Sun lighting there .alfo, befpeaks an healthful body, and of a very !hong
conftitution, and lufiily able to firuggle with its defiinies, before death
iliatl get the maftery. Wherefore 'Ye mull: not Jay the afcendant under
the oppofirion of tbe Moon jull: upon the very day of death, but fome
weeks b.cfare it. And, feeing we have an qppofition, firft without lati..:

tude, and then with it ; we therefore lay the inno<loetion to this·fatat
murder firfl: 't!nder the oppofitioh with latitude, and .that 'W'as at the •ericl
of the feafl: of tabernacles, at what time the jews firft to~k up iftones to
fl:one him; but he efcaped 'a\vay -and hid himfelf; 1afld ·this was fdme-
what before the very day of his n·ativity, at the em:l :of c
thirty-two .ycars
of age, on the 17th of OCtober. Now, between the oppo~-.rion without
and the oppofition with latitude, are feventy-four days; ·a11d during this
time, Jefus was fl:ruggling 'with ctofs fates, ·and preach·ed privately in
Judea, and not openly, for fe.iir of dle Jews:. only 'at the feafr of dedica-
tion, he appeared in vindic'ation of the blind mab, unto whom he had
given fight. But at that feaft again, took they up {tones to kill him ;
and they fought to take him, but he efcaped, and went away beyond
Jordan: and this was abm.it the tw~nty-fifth of December, at thirty-
two years of age : and yet he lived three months frill after that,
but then it was as a wounded perfon, all the while debating with death:
for the Jews condemned him to die abfolutely, and laid wait to take him;
and he could not walk openly among them any more, but went away
beyond Jordan unto Ephraim o\1 the borders ·of ·the wildernefs. To
meafure therefore from the ·I 7th of OCtober, or the morrow after the
feafr of tab'ernacles, in the thirry-fecond year ·of Chrifi almoft ended,
unto the day of his nativity,'there ate thirty-one years and two hundred
and ninety-feven days; which, turned into degrees after the rate of one
year five days and eight hours to a degree, (as was ·before mentioned,)
do make thirty-one degrees a'nd twenty-on·e minutes~ and thefe again
fubtratled from the oblique afcenfion of the Moon's oppofition in Libra,
twen~y-one degrees one minute, which is two hundred and thirteen de-
grees two minutes, do maK.e·the oblique afcel1fion of the afcendant to be
an hundred and eighty-one degree-s forty-one minutes ; and that oblique
afcenfion, under the elevation of thirty-one degrees and fifty minutes,
places the -afcendant of this nativity in the fign Libra, one degree twenty-
fi?C minutes; and from the oblique afcenfion of the afcendant, one hun-
dred and eighty-one degrees forty-nine minutes, fubtratling ninety de-
grees, the.right afcenfion of the mid-lleaven mull: be ninety-one degrees
and forty-one minutes; and the right afcenfion p}ace'th th mid•'heaven
itfelf in the fign Cancer,. in o·ne degree thirty...three minutes: ·and now
again fubtratl we the right afcenfion of the Sun, Which is .rwo hun:dred
and feventy-two·degrees e1even minutes, from the tight aiCenfion of the
mid-heaven, which is ninety-one degrees forty-one minutes; 'or, be-
caufe that can·not be, from four hundred and fifty-one degrees forty-one
minutes, which is the addition of the whole ·circle of heaven to the
.~ight afcenlion of the mid-heaven; and the remainder is one :bundr.ed
and feventy-niue degrees thirty m·inutes ·of the equator; which, turned

into the hours and minutes of the day, do befpeak the equal time of
Chrifi's birth to have happened at eleven hours atid fifty-eight minutes
in the·afternoon, to which add one minute and thirty-eight feconds for
equation, and the apparent time was eleven hours, fifty-nine minutes,
and thirty-eight feconds, which comes within a fmall matter of midnight.
The time ·of birth beins thus propofed, I calculate all the· planets'
places for this time, and dtreCl: them to their prornittors, together with
the afcendant, mid-heaven, and the ninth houfe, in order to fuit all other
accidents according to this time, that by fo doing it may appear, accord-
ing to the moft experienced rules of Afirology, we have laid the time
right. And, this being done, it appears, firfr, that the angels adored
him ; but this aCl: had nothing of the fiars in it. Then, that the thep-
herds came and publithed his glory all over the city, and in thirteen days
after came the wife men from the eaft to worihip him; all thefe were
nothing elfe but the fruit of famous tranfits at the time of birth : the
Virgin's Spike and ArCl:urus (two great and noble frars) were newly gone
by, and, being within orbs, drew after them a goodly race of honour
and glory; Jupiter, who accidentally reprefeQted thepherds, as he was
lord of the fixth houfe, and naturally lignified religious perfons, or royal
priefts, being in the afcendant, and near upon the cufp, was much about
rifing, when the 1hepherds entered, and drew the priefily kings out of
the eaft to vifit him; the Sun, alfo a fignificator of honour, was in con-
junction .of Venus, who had dignity in the ninth, and, with the FJyint
Vulture, a royal fl:ar, and the famous Fomahaut, by latitude, was within
his beams, with thefe tranfits accompanying tbefe honourable directions.
Firfi, the mid-heaven was nearly coming up to the oppofition of the
Sun, and the afcendant was hafiening after to. the quartile of the fame,
and the Moon alfo was nearly in trine of the Sun and Mercury~ But
th~t which came neareft to the purpofe, was the Moon to the con-
juntlion of Algol's ·Head, at the end of twelve days and odd hours, at the
very point of time that the wife men came. Now this Algol's Head is a
ftar of Saturn and Mercury; and, though it be a mifchievous ftar, yet
it lignifies preferment, though it be with a vengeance at the heels of it.
And fo it was here. For, the wife men being gone, Herod, by means
of their coming, plotte4 Chrift's murder, and forced him to flight. The
mid-heaven alfo to the oppofition, and the afce'ndant to the qua'rtile, of
the Sun, aCl:ed much fucb ~nother part as Algol's Head did, giving
honour of kings, though not without a mifchief in it. But the
Moon in trine of the Sun and Mercury, argued an aptnefs of the native
to be honoured both of kings and priefts, and of all men in authority.

After thefe things fonowed the flight it1to Egypt within tM firft year.:
And this needed no more anger than from what direCiions gave the pre-
ceding honour, as the Moon to Algol's Head, at thirteen days of age;
for here Herod plotted his tnurdet; and the mid-heaYcn tot~ oppafi-
tion of the Sun at an hundred and eighty-five days end ; and t'b¢ afceu•

was our Lord and blefTed Savour a ftrauget in a firangc Ian~ and a.n.
exile who durft not !how his head, neither durfl: hilS patents make Jtuowt1
who, or what, or where, he was. The Sun to M-trcury, as: l0rd of the
twelfth houfe, fignifies a mifcl\ief by mea!ts of private enemies; and yet,
as Mereury was alfo tard of the ninth, it helped out of that mifchief:, by
meails of a IonC7 journey : with thefe alf() accomf>tlnied the Patt of For-
tune to a quartile ot £he Mootl at twa hut1dre<l atlld ninety-three days

(for fo long continued our Saviour's exile in Egypt.) But, when the
Moon·entered into-terms of Venus in Taurus b o~ at two years of age

Saviour feems to have tafted fOme fharp di~empers of body himfeJf, or
eJfe very great wrongs from his enemies. But fiorms )aft not for ever:
the afcendant came to Jupiter, at eight years and one hundred and Oxty•
fix days, and gave him a very halcyon time; and he then lived in mu~b
love of neighbours and kindred. At ten years and onct·~undrcd .and fifty.,
two days, he feems to have encountered fome m0te ~sfortunu, or ~lfc
his moth~r bore them for him, by means of t.he Mood faUiog int9 the
pit called the Dragon's Tail. But within threo moutbs alter, Jupiter
coming to the trine of Venus gave him great content, wlb6tber it. was by
meaus. of {ome long journey, or by reafon of the pkaforc of his fiudies,
or both: however, it was a pleafant time, and the world fcemcd to weL--
come him with fome of her favours.
But, at the end of twelve years and fome rhree months over, he began
to be taken notice of publicly for his great wifdom and parts. Venus
was lady of his afcendant, and alfo principal figuificatrix of his mind.
And, at twelve years of age and fifty-two days over, 1he catuc, by di..
retlion, to a fextile of the Moou's difpo6trefs of his honour and ad-
vancement; which is as much as to fay, 1he brought him to·bo well
accepted for his inward worth, and e:x«Uency of mind, amoogft men
of power and authority. And the virtue of this good dircaial wrought .
to purpofe at the next patfover, at the latter.en'd of Marth~ about
fome forty-one days after the dircaion happened. From this time
forward there is no queftion but he was every yeal' more awl mot'e notlcd
and admired, as. he came yearly up to the feaft at Jerufalem; for at
twelve years and one hundred and nineteen days, which was but a month
after the paffovcr, the Part of Fortune came to a trine of Jupiter with
latitude, and about feventy-four days after to the fame trine without
latitude; and at one hundred and fixty-aine days over twd~e years
came up the afcendant to a trine of Saturn out of the ninth.houfe, with
Jatitude, and eighteen days after that to the fame trine ~ithout latitude;
and thefe are dire8ions to credit a man amongft ancient and ferious
people. But that which hit neareft upon the very week,. w.ai the .di-
recHon of the n~nth houfe unto the trine of Jupiter with .latitude,.wbicb
bappen~d at the end of twelve years and one hundred and one days,. at
'he beginning of April, prefently after the paffover ~ek; and the
fame houfe c-ame to the fame trine without latitude abo\lt forty day.s ·af...
ter. But, however, the direCtions preceding and fucceeding all con-
curred to heap up the glory of his difput'atron amongft the doCtors. AUO
thefe kind of dit"eflions made him dexteroug at his c:aUing ~' in build-
ing hon~t:s, and folrowing his buftnefs feri'OutJy, aad with gra~ induftry.
After th1s, at over fixteen, came the Part of Fortune to a trure of Sa.-
turn;

~ turn ; ·and that was good, but had reiation chiefly to his trade, as if he
had gained by it in dealing with elderly people. But, half a year after,
the Moop to the contra-antifcion of Venus was ill either to himfelf or
his mother, or both. And at over feveuteen, the Sun fell under the
contra-antifcioos of Saturn; and that feems to have been grievous to his
·reputed father. At fixteen years and ninety-eight days, the ninth houfe
came up to the body of Saturn ; and then no doubt but he was fuffici-
ently unhappy in his grave counfels, and met with more derifion than at-
tention. And they, who formerly had applauded his wifdom, would be
apt enough now to betray their own weaknefs, in changing their fiory.
Yet Venus coming to the fextile of the Sun a little after, in the fame
year, would not only allay much of that difparagement, but alfo· would
be raifing friends amongft 'the more prudent fort of powerful perfons,
to reprove and bridle the licentious lips of envious and upbraiding
tongues. At eighteen years and three hundred and fixty-one days tb~
afcendant happened upon the trine of Venus, and that was an healthful
and a pleafant time, clearing off the reproaches of Saturn and envious
people. At twenty-two entering, the Part of Fortune fell int~ the lap
of Venus in the fifth boufe, and rendered a time religioufly pleafan~.
And at twenty-two years and one hundred and thirty-fix days, the nin.tb
houfe got out of the clutches of envious Saturn, and encountered a trine
of Venus in the fign Gemini. And this undoubtedly _gave him to
fee favoury fruits of his good counfels and grave admonition, to hiS
great contentment. But towards the year ending, the Moon co~ing
to the ·quartile of Venus interrupted the p1eafant progrefs of his
affairs. And, in the twenty-third year well entered, he met with
great oppofition, as well from men in power as the rabble-rout'
greatly gainfaying his facred converfation; and this by means of Jupiter
falling under the Moon's oppofition, both without and with latitude.
At twenty-four years of age and two hundred and twenty-one days'
came the Moon to the Foot of Orion, called Rigel ; at what time might
po1ftbly happen the preferment into the order of the twenty-four, fpoken'
·· of by Suidas, of which be never made either profit, ufe, or advantage;
unlefs it were by accident. At twenty-feven years and two hundred and
ninety-nine days, venus, lady of the afcendant and of the ninth houfe~
fell upon the quartile of Saturn; and this adminiftered unto him much
of ,trouble in his mind, and of difturbance in his religious courfes; and
perhaps he met with fome wrong in his journey to the feafi: of taberna-
cles, which happened about that time. At twenty-eight years of age
complete, Jupiter attained unto the fexti)e of the Sun; and that admi-
niftered unto him much favour and iefpca from perfons of ~uality.
But the Sun being at the very bottom of heaven, it feems as if all his

his reception, ~herever he came; for God Almighty makes ufe ofnatural
infiruments to ferve divine ends. About this time alfo came the ninth
houfe to the mer~urial fiar called Cafior's Head ; and the Moon en~
countered the She-Goat, a fiar of Mercury and Mars, at thirty-one years·
and two hundred and forty days. Thefe arc fl:ars furthering ingenuity,
though not without troubles, and fuch our Saviour wanted not for all
the time of his miniftration, until finally the afcendant came to the oppo~
fition ofthe Moon, firfi without latitude, at the end of thirty-one years ~ud.
a two hundred and twenty-two days, about the beginning of Auguft ; at
which time his neighbours of Capernaum began.to deride his min~ilry,
and the Pharifees, complying with the Herodians, made him fly the
country ; and, lafily, the afcendaut to the oppofition of the Moon,..W
·ith
latitude, the afcendant being in this figure Hyleg, and the l\1oon, 1Vbicb
is Anareta, being in the eighth houfe, deprived him of life, as Go~ had
appointed it from the beginning.
Thus we find the time propofed mofi fitly agreeing with all paffage~ .of
his life, as well as with his death. But yet, to make iure work, w~ utually
compare the fituation of a fcheme alfo with the complexion and qualitieS:
of the native before we determine that the time is right. . And now to
do as much by this; Firft, it is apparent, by the known rules of art, that
Jefus was boni as it were purpofely, and that fo as may be difcerncd
by the fcheme of his nativity, to die a violent death. For here we bav~
the Moon, the common fignificatrix of life, fittin~ upon the; very
brink of death, upon the cufp of the eighth houte : then we ~nd
her in conjunClion with the very worft of malignant ftars, Algol'~
Head. The Dragon's Tail a]fo is in the eighth, inlefs than ten degrees
of her: but as bad or worfe than all this is Mars in oppo6tioi1 un~o Ju-.
piter in;the afcendant, aud in quartile with Mercury, and the Sun in the
fourth. It is true indeed, that, as he came into the world ~jthout fin, fo
was be above the power of any influence of heaven to be able to hurt
him : and, had he not voluntarily fubmitted unto the infirmities of na-
ture, they had never in the leaft reached him. And,' though the frgnifi...
cator of his enemies was ftronger and better armed than. fuch ft~rs were
which fiood for his own perfon, yet was his armour of i_
unocency eafily_
able to have overturned all, would he have ufed his- mighty power to that
purpofe : but fuch was his love, that he was willing to .lay down his
life; and therefore he put himfelf under the power of nature, in order to:
lofc his life. And hen~, by measts of this fubmiffion, Mars, in the:
houfe of enmity, the lord thereof, being fl:ronger than Venus, lad1,
ofthe houfe of life, <¥' Jupiter, her aflociate, placed in that ho1,1f~, ren-

d~red. his enemies too ilrong for him, and . back~d them with bitter
choler, fpite, and malice, againft him. The .Sun. being in quartile to
Jupiter and the afceudant, made the magi(hates averfe both to his
perfon and doCtrine. Mercury alfo in the fame quartile inclined the
churchmen with the fame averfenefs to oppofe him• . Mars in oppofition.
exafper~ted the men of war. And, lafily, the Moon fiirred up the vul..
gar people to cry him down. And all this might have been as aptly fore..
1een by his nativity when he entered the worldt as it is now known by
his life paffed in it. ·
But, to purfue the refidue of his perfon, as \veil as his condition; we.
nnd, that Libra, a cardinal fign, of temper fanguine, hot, and moifi, af-
cends; and Jupiter is in the afcendant, near the point of riling, a~ birth7:
in a figu of his own nature; and Venus, lady of the afcendant, in Aqua-
ties, a fanguine fign too, do aU befpeak him to have been a perfon of a
very level temper, and of a fanguine complexion. Ven1,1~, in trine to the
afcendant in the houfe of Saturn. endued him with·;J. fo~er cheerfulnefs iq
his converfation: and Saturn, being in a fanguine ftgn too, in trine of
Jupiter in the afcendant, from. the ninth, or houfe of ingenuity and re-
Jigio~, ·and in dignities of Mercury, with a reception from him in the.
highdt=degree by houfe~ infufes melancholy into his temper, to mingle.
with his mirth, and feeds him with a· mighty ftreugth of judgment and
deep policy : alfo he difiils gravity and ferioufnefs iuto all his aClions: and
thus Jupiter, Venus, and Saturn, are moft excellently unit~d in him with
ihe heft· of afpeCls. To ·.thefe we may add the Moon, with almoft a
tnQiety of her orbs in her exaltation, and there in trine 9f the Sun and
Mercury. The Moon is the great mi~refs of life and nature, and the
trines of the Moon do gratify the native, even as ftrongly as if they fel
into the afcendaut. Hence therefore is he armed from the Sun with a
majefiic and a royal prefence, al1d princely prudence, and from Mercury·
with as great a ftock of ready wit and ingenuity; and the rather, for that
he is in Cazimi with the Suo, and info ftrong reception with Saturn. To.-
gether with all thefe we nnd Spica Virginis, a ftar of the fw~etefi influ-
ence of all the fixed ftars in heaven, fitting near upon the cufp afcend- ·
ing, and there admirably qualifying for oratory, and that. efpecially in
divinity. Artlurus is there too, a princely ftar, that adminifiers courage·
and a noble refolution. Laftly, the fign of juftice afcends; and Jupiter,
the planet of religion, joins with it, to increafe devotion ; and Sat1,1rn
and Venus are both in figQ.s humane and temperate. And, although
our Saviour was not as commoB people are, yet had u.ature wonderfully
fet him out, and adorned him.

AN ILLUSTRA.TION
But yet there are exceptions. For the Moon is ill placed on the eighth,
in an unlucky houfe, and joined with a peevilh and crabbed fiar, which
muft needs infect her to be fo too. Mars is alfo fet as if he fiood on pur-
pofe to deftroy a nativity fo oppof1te to Jupiter and the afcendant ; and,
being firong withal, he feems to threaten all good qualities with an over-
rum, infufing nothing but choler, fury, and malice, into the native's
head; and, difpoGng of the Moon, he makes her fo too. The. Sun alfo
looks upon the cufp afcending with an evil quadrature, and fuch as ufu-
ally renders a native much more proud and ambitious tpan either wife or
good-natured; and Mercury, complying with the Sun in the fame afpect,
endeavours to incline this facred perfon unto theft and lies. But what
now? Was Jefus thus? or rather does not Afirology belie him ? No,
neither. For, had thefe evil afpecrs courted an ordinary nature unto
evil manners naturally, yet would they not have forced him, but he might
have overcome all by gracious habits. But much more than this mufi
we note in our ever bleffed Lord Jefus Chrifi. For, he being born without
lin in his nature, the heavens wrought upon him in a different man-
ner of influence from what they do by us. For, feeing that the divine
nature withheld fo as no fin could enter him, the worfi of afpecrs (for
matter of qualification) became the bell unto him. For, by how much
an oppofition or a quartile is a fironger afpect than a fextile or a trine,
may they be withheld from doing harm, they muft needs afpeB: with the
greatefi force of their virtues. And thus the oppofition of Mars, falling
into his head, inlleacl of fury and choler, adminifiered the greater courage
in him ; and the quartile of the Sun, infiead of pride and ambition, gave
him the greater majefiy and wifdom ; and the quartile of Mercury, in-
fiead of lies, gave him the more prodigious wit; and the Moon with Al-
gol's Head, infiead of peevilh, made him the more foberly wife. But we
mnfi remember, that, though Chrifi could not fin, yet die he could. And
thus therefore oppofitions and trines, and evil fiars, were as evil to him,
in as high a degree, as unto tbe meanefi of us ; for in all things, faving
fin, was he as we are.
Next proceed we to his body, only fo as to compare that too witb our
fcheme. Far, though we have no proof either of his frature or his
colour, yet may we be bold to fay (by rules of art) that, Libra afcend-
ing, he was fomewhat inclined to be taU aud fair: but this was the lef~
few degrees of that fign afcending, and they in terms of Sat~un : elfe · is
there nothing to except, unlefs the Moon, with Algors.8ead, lllay be.
thought fomewhat · to abate · fro~ both. Jupiter in tbe afcen:dant

fomcwhat of.corpulency; fave that the trine of Venus from Aquaries, and
of Saturn out of Germini, forbid it. Jupiter gives a grey eye, and fo
fays Venus; and none cau hinder. . Venus would gladly beautify the
face, by virtue of her intereft in Libra; and fomethit)g lhe does to
rendc.r it rather fair than brown. And Saturn from Gemini can hinder
but very little: he would pacify, but Jupiter and Venus are refolved
to kcep.up the complexion. Jupiter adminifiers brown hair, and Venus
renders flaxen;· but Saturn would have it bl~ck; whence, between both,
Jupiter carries it. Venus gives a pleafant fmiling look, and Jupiter
denies it: not only Saturn attempts it, but prevails no farther than to
render it foberly ferious withal. The Sun and Mercury, with their trines
{o near the cufp, would fain deform ; but Mercury in the Sun has not
power to darken. The Sun would only caft fwarth; but Jupiter in the
afc;endant on one fide, and the Vjrgin's Spike upon it on the other fide,"
uuerly defeat him. Mars in oppofition wou-ld fain fcarify, but Jupiter
fo near defies him alfo. Lafily, the Moon between Aries ·and Taurus
contraries but little from .the reft; efpecially for that lhe has fo few rays
falling into her bofom. The moft the d9es in oppoGtion is only, by
means of her place in the eighth, and being with Algol's Head fo near,
to wrinkle the brows, and furrow or dent the cheeks; but the wants
ftrength. J upitcr would have a full face, and Venus a round ; and fo it
ili;Concludcd between them, faving that Saturn and lhe Moon together
prevail fo far as to render it oval.
Lafily, as for his other fortunes. Firft, we find his afcendant and
fix~h well fitted with a very {hong conftitution for health. The oppo-
Cttion of Mars and a quartile of the Sun and Mercury prevail to harm
more by unlucky outward accidents than by inward diftempers. His
houfe. of wealth is direCtly oppofed by the Moon, lady of the mid-
heaven, and is not defended by any good afpect. His mid-heaven is
alfo very low ; the lady of it is fufficiently afHiCled ; and, being incum-
bered with a croud of evil afpeCls, had no help of either of the fortunes.
No,. the Sun in the very bottom of heaven befpeaks that the native's
kingdom is not of this world. Only the Moon upon the houfe of
death, after void of courfe, is in trine of. the Sun, which thows to pro-
mife his kingdom by death, or after it. His ninth houfe has the heJp
ef both the fortunes. But Saturn bodily dwells there~ and hatcheth a
world of croffes, borh in his functions and long journeys. His boufe
Qf enmity is very {hong, with the lord thereof therein, and at home in
his _OWl) boufe, and threatens malice enough. The eighth houfe is
ev~n malignant too; and fo is the lord of the twelfth, faving his trine
to tbe . Moo••· But this lord is uuder the Sun, weakens ·hi$ force, _

and difcovers all his private fplcen. His fifth houfe, or houfe of~hil­
dren, has a ric~ jewel in it ; and the lord thereof loeks pleaftr1gly upon
the afcendant, which argues he had a body fufficiently fruicful for iffue.
The lady of the afcendant alfo in the houfe of children, in trine to the
lord of that houfe, and both in good afpeB: unto the houfe of marriage
and the lord thereof, do all agree, that it was no hindrance in nature
which rendered our Saviour wifelefs or childlefs. No, it was his great
gravity, or rather his infinite piety, which, for the kingdom of Heaven's
fake, Jed him to defpife nature's treafures. And hence came it to pafs,
that the church was his only fpoufe; and by her hath he a numberlefs
offspring of holy faints unt_
o his children. The lord of the fixth
is in the afcendant, and the great fortune; whence were his fervants
true and faithful; only one Judas {when .that fixth houfe came by di-
reaion to the quartile of Mercury, in the entrance of the houfe of en-
mity) fatally betrayed him; and the reft, more out of fear than fot
falfehood, forfook him and fled. The lord of the ninth is very low, and
in quartile of Jupiter and Mars, and ir1 conjunction of the twelfth lord;
which rendere~l his friends men of low conditi~>tl, and befriending him
more by night than by day ; as being terrified by mighty enemies, and
not encouraged by any outward promifes from himfelf. The lord of
the third is in the houfe of enmity, and thence rendered moll: of his
neighbours bitter and envious, efpecially during the times of ill direc-
tions operating. Only Jupiter, having dignities in that houfe, made
others of his neighbours and kindred as much ·his friends. Lafily, the
Sun upon the cufp of the fourth feems fitly to c::otnply with that fove-
reignty which attended upon his death, and appeared by bis refurreftioh
and afcenfion into heaven. When Adam entered, the Sun was juil:
upon fetting. When Jefus Chrift was incarnated, he was jufi upon
rifing. But at his birth he was at lowefi. For it was not the Sun of the
·Firmament, but the Sun of Righteoufi1efs, who arofe with healing in biS
wings.
Such was the fortune of our Saviour, during his progrefs through this
earthly world ; and· fuch were the qualities of his human mind, even
as the fiars defcribe them; and fuch was the complexion of his bu-
m~n body, juft as the heavens do blfpeak. And, though we never faw
his perfon, or any true portraiture of the fame, yet know we, by the
fcheme of his nativity, that he was a man fomewhat tall of ftature, of
an oval face, of a ruddy complexion between fair and brown; of a
grey eye, yet tharp and piercing, o( a bright brown hair, of an high
forehead, of much beard, of a pleafant look, fmiling, yet foberly fe-
rious, and of a body well compofed1 and indifferently fet, between .

of December the twenty-fifth dayt was 1668• years complete, tinea his

As the Sun approached the afcendant, Jefus was led before Pontius
Pilat~, the Moon in the feventh malicioudy oppofing; for fo·the judges
at his firft apprehenfion became ·uow his accufers, and, pofi"cffiug·the
natural fign of Chrift himfelf, which afcended at ;birth, aud whicb was
the fign of juftice, as the labourers in tne vineyard, under.pretence of reli-
gion, caft they him out of his own : and Mercury and Venus, one figni-
fying the traitor, and the olher the magiftrate into whofe hands he was
betrayed, were then in the tweltth, acting the part of private enemies.
But, as the .Suo drew into the eleventh, or houfe of hopes and friends,
and there infeCled by the euvious place of Mars in the radix, Pilate.alfo,
his fome-while friend, yielding at laO: to the oppotition of the Moon, or
the rabble, and turning enemy, condemned him t~· be crucified. · •
And, by that time the Sun in the radical chair of Mars came into 'the
noufe of hoJlOUr, the .Sun of righteoufnefs was lifted up upon the crofS,
as if he was hafting towards heaven, and that iu order to draw all men
after him. And here the Moon, fignifying the rabble, oppofes him with
bitter railings. Saturn upon the eleventh, and lord of enmity, complies
with the,m to dellro.J his hopes; .and Jupiter, lord of the ninth, lig-
nifying the priefts, and Mars· the foldiers, being both in the twelfth, are
private cmemic:s. Bu~ finally, as they ~ontinuc . railing and reviling, lo!
at the very ·pQIPt of btgh noou, au umverial darknefs overwhelmed all,
and the S1-1n himfe!f bluthed to,•bebold what curfed things were aCting.
T~e Sun was now where MJir& was at birth, as it were difpofed of

hands of Saturn, in his very feat of the radix, as it were in the dungeon

AN ILLUSTltATION
The antifcion ofSaturn on the uinth, with the Moon upon the afcen·
dant with the Drag01;~'s Head, as alfo the Sun, Venus, and Mercury, in
fextile of Jupiter; incline unto honefty, gravily, and good manners.
Mercury in reception with Jupiter, and in trine to the afcendant; -
alfo the Moon in trine of ·Mars, and in reception with the Sun, and
the Sun in the fextile of Jupiter; give a fufficient wit, and a found
judgment.
Nothing promifes' worldly wealth, but contrarily. Jupiter in the mid-
heaven, in fextile of the Sun and Venus, promifes honour enough.
.But Antares, a violent fixed fiar, upon the afceodant, with laritude, and
that within a degree, befpeaks a violent death. And Saturn in oppofition
of Mars, from angles, (the one being lord of the afcenda1it, and the other
of the fourth,) peremptorily threatens it. And it came to pafs, as it-
feems to be ·ulbered in by thefe direClions as follows.
Firft, he ent«ed into his minifl:ry at the age of twel}ty-nine >ears and
fome little odds ; and was immediately buoyed up with wonderful ap-
plaufe. At this time were operating, the afcendant in triue ot the ~oon,

On ELECTIONS.
WiiA'r is meant by EleCtions, is nothing more than projeaing a fcheme
of the heavens, to find the feveral pofitions and configurations of the
planets on any given day whereon we propofe to begin any bufinefs of
importance, to take a long or interefting journey, to make overtures of
marriage, or to purfue any object of our bappinef5 or advantage r for the -
purpofe of choofing, what is vulgarly called, ''a lucky time to begin,"
.that is, when the influx of the principal fignificators is fucb as thall cor-
, refpond with the defires of our own mind, and with the bufinefs, what-
ever it may be, we with to take in band.
I purpofely declined taking notice of this fpeculation in the Firfi Part,
that I might not be laughed at; which I mull: own the abfurdity and folly
of thofe, who, on every ludicrous and trivial occafion, have reforted with
religious folemnity to this cuftom, have given but too much occafion to
infpire : yet I will now take leave to hope that enough has been faid to·
fhow, that in our more important .concerns, ~nd in the real and heardelt
perturbations of our minds, upon the commencement of any arduous and
extenfivc undertaking, it may be as well to choofe thofe feafons when
the beft and moft favourable influences of the heavens concur, as
when they put forth the mofi noxious and difcordant irradiations.
To a thinking mind, there cannot be a moment's hefitation, fince
no man in his fenfes would prefer a ftormy tempeftuous day to ride out
for pleafure, to thofe difiinguithed by calmnefs and ferenity; nor would
he choofe an intenfe frofty morning for the pleafures of a cold bath,
which is luxuriant only in a milder feafon; and yet all thefe differences
in the weather are produced by the varied pofitions and changes of the
planets, by an influx and effea upon the ambient matter, which we call.
no more fee than we can the influx produced by the fame bodies upon ,·
the bent of our minds, or which determines this certain order oftimes,
fo fitly appropriated to all human concerns, that the Scriptures pioufly
recommend a due obfervation of them, and which the Pfalmift declares,
are beautiful in theirftafons! ·
Thofe therefore, who with to confult the heavens, previous to any
important undertaking, thould projeCl the horofcope for that precife
time when they feel their inclinations moft completely bent upon en-
. gaging in the bufinefs. This will thow them the particular influence of
every fignificator then operating; and, being compared with the geneth..
liacal figure of birth, and with thofe direaions in the nativity which
arc to operate both for our good and evil, will, upon a· fair and true
com-

comparifon, quickly inform us whether the bufinefs in contemplation
will generally or eventually turn out to our advantage, or not. But, ·
for the· more particular difcovery ofwhat relates to the good or ill fuc-
cefs of the l>ufinefs itfelf, with all its confequences and collateral
incidents, a figure mull be projeCled of the exaCt time when that bufmefS
is begun, and the face of the heavens then operating moft particularly
and minutely C\)nfidered. The figns, the fignificators, the angles of the
figure, and the good and evil places of the borofcope, are to be allowed
their natural and accuftomed app1ication, exacUy the fame as in all the
rules he'retofore laid down; and, if the two figures thus projected form
an harmony and concurrence with the figure of birth, and fall in with
the good directions and revolutions thereof, the undertaking will un-
doubtedly be profperous, and the bufinefs fuccefsful. But, if thefe
figures are difcordant in themfelves, and oppofc the benevolent fignifi-
cators in the geniture, it will, if purfued, prove dangerous or deftruClive
to the native, and will forward the evil events prenoted by the direCtion$
of the geniture.
A mediocrity in the pofitions and influences of the fignificators, and
of the angular houfes of tlie eleClional figures compared with the geni-
ture, will, as in all other cafes, produce a medium between the two ex-
tremes, and thow that the event of the matter in hand iliall neither
greatly ferve nor materially injure the party then about to engage in it•

PART THE THIRD
T HE Meteorological Part of Aftrology is that which enables us, by a
certain well-known influence of the planets, feconded by obferva-
tion and experience, to afcertain the caufes ?f the different qualities of
the air, the generation of meteors, thunder, hgbtning, and all the various
phenomena of the heavens ; whence the prediCtions of the weather, of
the temperature and quality of the four feafons of the year, and of the .
profpell: of a healthy and plentiful time, .or of plague, pcftilence, and
famine, are neceffarily deduced. . .
· This part of the fcience likewife comprehends the doCtrine ofeclipfes,
comets, blazing ftars, and the ~reat conjunctions of tb~ fuperior bodies ;
whence the revolution of empues, the fate of kingdoms, the renovation
Qf cuftoms, and the civil and political fluCluation of all the provinces,
ftates, principalities, and commonwealths, upon the furface of the alobe•
arc fought out and predicted. 'We fhall therefore arrange thefe t;cula-
tions uudcr their refpctlive heads, and confider them diffintlly in the or-
der they ftand. .
Of METEORS in GENERAL.
Meteors arc divided into two forts, or clafies: tlle one arifing from
vapoun·and exhalations, caltcd impeifetlly-mized bodies, becaufe they arc
eafily reduced into their firft nature, orproper element, as into hail, fnow,.
or water ; and the others arc termed peifeBiy-mized, ~ thunderbolts, and
fucb-li~e ~trificd fubftances, becaufe they cannot fo foon be converted

Thefe exhalations, having penetrated the middle region, ,aod attaiacd
_
unto tbe height of the elements, are circumvolved with a flimy matter,
ojly~ aud apt to be inflamed. Thus having aifumed, a body, it is violently
carried about with the air, until with the motion and vicinity of the fire
it is inflamed; and then, uourithed with more exhalations continually
drawn uato it, it burns and converts itfe)f into divers forms, according to
the difpofition of the matter then generated. ·
But others appear to fall, and fiide through the air; the lightefi: part
being confumed, or drawn away by fome other means, or-the levity of it
being unable to fupport the groifer part, lets it defcend obliquely through
the air; and, thus enlightened, it is termed a falling ftar. Some conceive
that this meteor afccnds not fo high, being of a grofs body, (yet hot and
ftriving to afcend,) but is repulfed by a coldnefs of the middle region, or
the moill:nefs of the clouds; and fo by reafon of its own weight, and by
the oppofition of the clement, is thrown down again. The fubll:anc:e of
it is like a jelly, tranfparent, lucid, and apt to be illuminated.
Fiery meteors are ufually moved, by the. region they are in, fr-om ealt
to weft, according to the raptile ~otion of the fpheres ; though Seneca
affirms that be perceived one which moved parallel to the horizon, from
the north by t~e weft into the fouth, and fo by the eaft into the north
again. This-is by no means improbable, ftncc many lucid meteors.move
with· the air, and arc impelled by the matter which nourifiles them; as
may .be feen by ·fire· in ftubble. Another kind of meteors are fccn to
remove fuddcnly from one place to another, cafting forth fparks like fire.
and ~ by fome termed gDats; whilft others again appear fixed and im-
moveable, both in refpeet to latitude and longitude.· Thefe are generated
in any part of the hea.vens, and at all times of the year; but rarely,
in cold countries, at any other time than autumn~ for then the
heat is fuffi.cient to raife up the matter, and the temperature of tbe air is
ap! to. fuffi:J: the .exha~ations to draw to it ~ flimy matter! which CJlnnot
ex1ft m the fpnng-ttme, the heat not bemg then fuffi.caent to elevate
them. And, in fummer, the exhalations are not fo grofs, becaufe the
Sun's beat diffipates thofe vapours, and rarefies the air; and, if it could be
drawn together, the middle region is fo cold, that it cannot afcend to the
upper; and the winter-quarter is fo cold and moift, and oppugnant to
£ucb exhalations, that it is quite uoapt for the generation ot meteors o(
this kind. ·
The middle part .or region of the air is generally conceived to &e
yebcmently cold .a~d moifi:, by antiperiftafis ~ and its dea alfo prov•

the fame, as we are affurc;:d by thofe who have afcended to a con(iderable
height in air-balloot1s. · And this we fee in all things that are oppugnant,
inclofed, and comprehended by their contraries ; for that which is in-
clofe<), not being ab)e to break forth, and at the fame time repulfed by
its oppofite quality, contracts, and, as it were, ·fortifies itfelf. This is
teen by experience in all living and fenfitive creatures; thei-r inward parts
being much hotter in winter than in fummer, and their fto~achs apter
and more able to digeft their food. The caufe is, that the heat is then
repultive to the inward parts, by·the oppofition and coldnefs of the out-
ward ·air. Befides, the fire, and all combufiil>le things, will burn more
violently in winter tha·n in fummer ; and, the colder the weather is, the
more fire will fcorch. The reafon in all thefe is the fame; unce ·the fire
is found to grow more violent by how much the more it 1s oppofed by th¢ ·
contrary quality of the fubdued·cold. The cafe is the fame in the middle
region ofthe air ; for the upper part is made hot by the violent motion of
it, and by its proximity to the element of fire; and the lower region is
made hot by reflettion of the fun-beams; whence the cold included be-
tween them becomes the more violent in proportion as the lower region is
inflamed by the fun's reflettion, and by that means is colder in fumtner
than· in winter.
· '.fhofe divifions or portions• of.the air have no determiueQ! .fi).ace; .nor
hath the water in refpeet of quality; for, by the motiob of the celeftial
bodies, both cold and moifture being drawn together, ·the element of
water will increafe, by which the air muft of neceffity diminHh: So, by
the conjunCtion of heat and . moifiure, the fpbere of water' : will be
diminilhed, and the air as much increafed. By this means the air more
abounds in fummer than in winter, and the water more in winter than in
furnmer ; and thus the middle region of the air is occafionally contraCted
atld dilated, and is confequently greater at one time thau another.
·By the heat of the fun-beams, and influence of the ftars, meteors are
elevated to the middle region of the air. Thofe which by nature are
temperately hot and moift are extracted (rom wet and watery places; yet
they retain as much heat as is fufficient to elevate them unto the height
ofthe middle region, where, by reafon of the coldnefs of that place, they
are condenfed, ·and there g~nerate feveral kinds of imperfectly-mixed
bodies. The clouds, thus incorporated, are with 'the cold 'turned into
fnow, and congealed many times before it engenders water. To prove
thi$ affcrtion, we m':ly obferve that fi1~w, if compatted or beaten together,
is·no~ fo foon diffQlwd into water by.the fun, or any other means, as·ice
will be .. which argues~ ·that, had .this (ubtbnce been water ·fir.ft~ it wo.uld

have been fooner reduced. Thefe vapours, · or thick exhalations, dra;n
up into the middle region of the air, are often digefted and turned into
water;and from thence difiilled down like mifts, or in very fmall drops;
for the greateft rain is fuppofed not tofaH far through the air, but out of
the inferior part of the lower region. . . -
It is generally conceived, that the rain which falls from the middle
region defcends in little orbs, whereby to preferve itfelf, and to refifi: the
violence of the air through which it paffes ; and it becomes fmall, by
reafon of the dill:ance and time it occupies in ·falling. For hail demon-
ftrates both the bignefs and rotundity of the drops, which, from humid
exhalations drawn up into the middle region, are there converted into
water;- and, immediately as the drops ditl:il down, they are contracted into
ice by the coldnefs of the air, in that part which is called hail; derived from
the High Dutch hageli, or from the Hebrew ege/1, which fignifies con-
gealed drops. .
. ..
In the winter-feafon it is feldom obferved to hail, becaufe the cold in
the middle region is more remifs than in warm weather; and in fumqler-
time it is feldom obferved in any very hot day, becaufe the heat of the
lower region will uot permit it .to pafs, ·without diffolving it before it
reacbes-the earth.- .Buf in the fpring, and in autumn, we .frequently 'fee,
and are fubjeCl to, hail-ftorms ; the heat being then fufficient to elevate
the matter, and yet not fo violent as to diffolve it in its fall. Sometimes,
however, it happens that very large hail-.ftones are precipitated at mid-
fummer, or in the very hotteft feafons ; and thefe hail-ftones are then the
greater, if the elevated matter be fufficient, by how much the more its
nature is 9ppofed by the lower region, made hot by the refleClion of the
Sun; for in all times of the y¢ar, and in all countries, there are ·more and
greater fiorms of hail obferved to fall in the day than in the uight.
There is unqueftionably a fiery nature included in hail-fiones, very
different from the heat of that fubtile vapour which occafions it to afcc:nd
the middle region ; for by the force of contraries it is evidently congealed,
as may be illuftrated by the fimple quality of fait, which being hot and
dry, is .made of water, whofe natural temperatures are directly oppofite;
being cold and moift in open .weathe_r, or by the fire-fide, or in the
fummer-fealon. . Take a handful of fait, aud· mix fome fnow ·with ·it ;

exhalations; and·the nights are then ufually colder, to convert them into
water. All dews are obfervcd.to·be greater at the MoonJs increafing=
;
but greateft of all at the fall•.. The feafon ofthe year is to be confidered,
and the weather,; for; the .hotter the day is, the aolder will be the night,
by rcafon of the 1hadow which the terreftrial globe .then makes; as ·is
exemplified .byithe 1hades oftrees,·or of any other interpofed body; wbich
are colder in fummer-time than in winter, in refpea of the air in gene-
ral. For in 1hadowed places, in the heat offummer, the air, as in oppo-
fition to the heat, is found to contraCt itfelf into a groffer body ; from
whence it appears that the whole clement of air is by nature cold.
There is a dew that flies in the air like fmall· untwifidd filk; ·whicb,
fallin§ upon the ground, or on plants, converts itfelf into a form like
fpider s webs. .The matter they confifi of is' an earthy and flimy vapour
or exhalation, fomcthing dry; and they arc found equally in fpring; fum-
mer, and autumn; but in chcfc northern countries they are moft frequent
when the Sun is near Libra, the days being then temperately warm, tbe
earth not exceeding dry, 11or yet overcharged with moifiure.
There is alfo another fort of dew, called honey-Jew, which confifts of
earthy exhalation~ mixed with watery vapours ; and many fuppofc ·them
to be exhalations from plants and flowers ; and this more evidently appears
from fugar-cancs, and divers kinds of Indian reeds, which have, in the
morning, dews hanging upon them, .in tafie refembling honey; and argue,
by their fweetnciS, that they .arc extraCted from the plants. · Thcfe
honey-dews afford plenty to the fiores of the indtrftriaus ·bee ; nor have
their purveyors much labour or trouble to procure ·their loading ; but,
though thefc honey-dews are good for bees, they are dcfirutlive to many
kiods of animals, as ihecp, goats, deer, and the like ; and are in general
injurious to all fruits and blooming flowers ; efpeeially to.•hops, grapes,
and corn ; and often blaft them in their prime. It was for the purpofe
of diYcrring tbefe evil effects, that Numa, one of the Roman kings,
fuperftitioufiy infiituted the fcafts called Rubigalia and F~oralia, in the
year from the building of Rome 516; which feafis were obfcrved on the
~ch of April to tbe .3d calcnd of May. This feftival, the Catholic
Church hath ftncc converted into Afce0fion Week, oaltmg;it Rogation,

The next eff'ea to be confidered is rain. Rain-water is found much
more infipid at ·one time than at another; and is very often impregnated
with a bracki~ tafie, yet comfortable to vegetation; and, by reafou of
the warmth, it nouriihes more abundantly, and is more natural for that
purpofe than fpring-water, or what is drawn out of wells, which is cold,
and too earthy; whereas, the other participates of the air, which is hot
and moifi; but, by reafon of this co-mixture of the elements, it is apt to
form divers animalcules, efpecially in calm times; which, like the air,
wanting motion, may corrupt; and fo, confequently, generates many
things, according to the undigefied matter exhaled from the earth.
The lowefi meteor in the air fomewhat refembles a buming candle;
and is by fome called Ignis Fatuus. This is a hot and moifr vapour,
which, firiving to afcend, is repulfed by the.cold, and, forced by anti-
perifiafis, moves clofe to the earth, and is carried along by the vapours
that feed it, always keeping in low moifi places. The lucid rays are of
an exceeding pale colour, and ver.y unwholefome to meet with, by reafon
of the noxious vapours it attracb, which nouriih the pallid flame. It is
frequently feen to afcend with a very rapid motion ; but it as fuddenly
falls, the moment it is repelled by the cold atmofphere; from whence
its name is derived.
T here are likewife vapours, hot and moifi, co-mixed with exhalations
that are hot and dry, involved thus within one another, and form what
is termed e/ellrical malter. They afcend, by virtue of their heat, into
the middle region of the air, where the exhalations, by antiperifiafis,
grow inflamed, and flrive to break forth from the cloud in which they
are involved. The upper part of the cloud, where the heat would paf5y
by oppofition grows more firong; and the exhalation, grown over bot
by being thus confirained, breaks forth with violence from the weakefi
place, againfi the air that is in the loweft part ; and, by reafon of the
cold above it, the heat and fubtilenefs of the exhalation, with its own
violence in breaking forth, gfances down upon the earth, without doing
any injury, if unreftfied; as a confuming fword, without hurting the
fcabbard. This is the natural generation of thunder and lightning;
which Dr. Franklin, Dr. Priefiley, and other ingenious .me~ .have
largely treated of in their eleClrical difquifitions.
The clap of thunder is firfi, but the lightning foonefi appears ; beca.de
our fenfe of feeing is much quicker than that of hearing; as may
be exemplified by a thoufaod common experiments; particularly by tbc
difcharge of the gun, or cannon, where we fee the fire before w.c hear

the report. · With· the conjuncti9n of thefe compound vapours .and
exhalations, fionc.s are generated in the air, as other minerals are in the
earth, but more fiery by nature; and tbefe are what are vulgarly called
tlnlllller-Dolts; which, in their form, are perfeCt cones, like . the flame
of fire which. generates them out of the terrene exhalations; they pervade
.the earth in prQportion to the projeCl:ile force of their velocity. The
pref~rvatives againfi: thunder and lightning are many. All . hard things
.will preferve what is foft and liquid; as iron laid upon veffels will J,teep
.tbc liquor from fourirag, by the former alleged reafons ; befides this, it is
naturally refifi:ed by a cover made of feal's ikin, which preferves any
creature by which it is covered. The like doth the laurel-tree; for
which reafon many of the Roman Emperors, in times of thunder and
lightning, were accuftomed to wear a garment made of laurel-boughs.
The pale lightning is moft unwholefome; but the red apteft to burn ;
the heft and moll: affured prefervative againft which is the protedion of
Heaven.
But l~t it be noted, that there may_
be thunder without lightning, and
lightning without thunder; for, when thefe hot and dry exhalations are
inflamed, and the cloud weak in which they are involved, the incenfed
exhalation breaks forth without violence, not being refirained; and
the coldnefs of the middle region ftrikes the ftaihes downward, but not
always to the earth, though its glittering and refleCl:ing upon the watery
clouds makes it appear clofe by; the fame as when the Sun-beams, or
any other fudden light, falling upon the water, will reverberate the
lufire, and dazzle the eye; particularly if the water be moved with any
wind. Thefe corrufcations are common in hot countries, and with us
in the beat of fummer.
Thunder without lightning alfo happens when the hot and dry exha-
lations break violently through the clouds in which they are circum-
·volved, but not inflamed; yet making a roaring noife in the burft of the
cloud which reftrained it. We alfo frequently fee little bladders filJcd
with wind give a crack or report at the fudden and violent breaking of
them. Sometimes thunder happens, and yet no lightning will appear,
by reciprocal winds ; the clouds violently' breaking themfelves in meet-
ing with one another; and this may often happen, by the infurreClion
of feveral mutinous exhalations difturbing the air with divers commo-
tions. Thefe ufually happen after much calm weather; and are very
ufeful to purify and purge the air, left with too much quictoefs it thould
~orrupt.

the north; and, when the Sun is ·in the cal\, the rainbOw ·will be~in the
w~{l; and thus in every part of the globe. The lower or nearer the.Sun
is to the horizon, the larger will the rainbow appear;, .though it never
can exceed a femicircle, and is the Iefs·in proportion totbe light of the
Sun above, 'in any fphere ; which is the reafon that at noon-day
we fo feldom fee ·any rainbow, particularly when the Sun is in the fum-
mer folftice, or near the tropic of Cancer; except in fucb places as are
far northward, or towards the antarClic pole, where, for fome weeks,
there is continual day. · _
, ·:
The Sun in winter, near Capricorn, may caufe a rainbow at noon-day
in our climate ; for they are formed by the light rays of the Sun falling
upon vapours and wateriili exhalations oppofite to him, and but little
elevated above the earth ; and, by reafon of the great diftance or remote-
nefs of the Suo, the illuminated beams defcribe his form after an obfcure
and imperfeCl manner, portraying an arc of a circle, adorned ufually with
the colours red, green, and purple, inclining to bluiili. The diftinClion
of thefe proceeds from the rays of the Sun refteCling upon the vapours;
and thofe colours are light in it which are neareft to the Sun, and thofe
· which are moll: remote always tend more to obfcurity; for a demon-
ftration, both of the coiQUrs and form·of the rainbow, it only requires to
caft water in a circular manner againft the Sun when it iliines, and the
whole is produced arti6cia1Jy. · ·
. .
Some think the red colour only is made by the Sun's rays, and (uppofc
the fecond colour is produced by refteB:ion, and third by the fccond; and
that all are contained within one condenfed hollow cloud, co-mixed with
airy ·and watery exhalations. For, if more rainbows than one appear at
a time, .it is certain·that they are produced by refteClion of one another;
but the colours in the fecond will be weaker than thofe in the firfi: ; and
the third rainbow wiU be more palid than the fecond, if there happen to
be thr~_e, which is very feldom; then the colours in the firft will be coun-
terchanged in the fecond, and the third again like the 6rft. The arches
in the clouds or rainbow ufually continue longer than the circles about
the Sun, becaufe the diftance in thefe are fo great, that his beams cannot
fo foon diffipate the exhalations which caufed them. Rainbows in the
night-time are exceeding rare, becaufe they are made .by the Moon,
wnofe beams are too weak to caufe fuch refteClions upon any cloud at 10 .
great a diftance; but, though they are rare, they fometimes happen.

The Ar~rora Borialis, or Northern Light, is an extraordinary meteor.,
or luminous appearance, 1howing itfelf in the night-time, in the northern ·
part of the heavens. It is ufualJy of a reddifu colour, inclining to yellow.,
and fends out frequent corrufcations of pale light, which feem .to rife
from the horizon in a pyramidal undulating form, and thoot, with great
velocity, up to the zenith.
The Aurora Borealis appears moll: commonly in form of an arqh;
chiefly in the fpring and autumn; after a dry year. The arch is partly
bright, partly dark; . but generally tranfparent. And the matter of
which it confifi:s is alfo found to have no effeCt on the rays of light which
pafs through it. Dr. Hamilton obferves, that he .could plainly difcern
the fmalleft fpeck in the Pleiades throu~h the denfity of thofe clouds
WQich formed part of the Aurora Borealis in I 763, without the lealt
diminution of its fplendour, or increafe of twinkling.
This kind of meteor never appears ncar the equator; and was fo rare
in England, that none are recorded in our annals fincc that remarkable
one, November 14, 1574, till the furprifing Aurora Borealis, March 6,
r71 6, which appeared for three nights fucceffively, ·and put the whole
kmgdom into the utmoft conftcrnation, t~rrifying brutes as well as m~·.
Indeed the horfes were fo frightened, that no fences could keep them in
the enclofures; it was impoffible to travel in the evenings; and the roa4-
waggons, and all other carriages, were obliged to lie by immediately as
the Sup was down. In the y.c:ars 1707 and 1708, five fmall oues were
obferved in little more than eighteen months ; but they bore no compa- ·
rifon with the above. Hence it thould feem, that the air, or earth, or
both, are not at all times difpofed to produce this phenomenon, for,
though it is poffible it may happen in the day-time in bright moon-thine,
or in cloudy weather, and fo pafs unobfervcd; yet that it thould appear
fo frequeut at fome times, and fo feldom at others, cannot well this way
be accounted for. That in March, 1716, was vifihle to the well: of 1{-e-
Jand, on the confines of Ruffia, and to the eaft of Poland; extending at
Jeaft near thirty degrees of longitude, and from about the fiftieth degree
in latitude over almoft all the north of Europe : and in all places at the
fame time it exhibited the like wondrous appearances.
Many attempts have been made to afiign the caufe of this pheno-
meaon. Dr. Halley imagines the watery vapours, or eftluvia, rarefied
exceedingly by fubterraneous fire, and tinged with fulphureous ftreams,
which many naturalifts have fuppofed to be the caufe of earthquakes,
may alfo be the caufe of this appearance ; or ·that it ·is produced by ~

fuppofe~ that the Aurora, whic_
h happens at _
the time when the mag-
uetic needle is difiurbed by the b~at of the earth, is tbe eleCtricity of tile
heated air above it ; and tbis appears chiefly in th~ northern regions; as .
the alteration in the he·
at of the air in thefe parts will be the ·greatdt:
Nor is this bypothefis improbable, when it is confidered, that the douds
being fUTcbarged with e)etlrical:matter is the caufe "f thtint1er and light-
ning; that it has been extratled ftom the air at the ti~ of an A\H'ora
Borcali&; that the 'irihaDitants of the northern ·countries obferve 'it to be
remarkably (hong when a fudden thaw fucceeds very fwere cold ~a­
tber; aod that the tourmaliu is known to -emit and abforb the el~lric
8uid only by the increafe or ~iminution of its heat. "
Pofitive and negative eleClricity in the air, with a proper quantity of
moiGure to ferve as a conduCtor, is fuppofed to account for this .and other
tncteors, fometimes ·feen in ·a ferene 1ky. .' Mr~ Canton hu finccf con-
trived to exhibit this m~eor by means of the Torricelliati vacuum, in a
glafs tube about three feet long, and fealed hermetiCally. When ·one
end of the tube is held in the band, and the other applied to the con-
duBor, the whole tube will be illuminated from end to' end; and will
continue luminous without interruption for a confiden&ble time after it
has been removed from the conduClor. If, after this, it be drawn
through the band either way, the light will be uncorrimOftly intenfe,
and without the· leaft interruption frotn one hand to the other, even to
its whole length. And, though a great part of the eleClricity is dif
...·
charged by this operation, it witt frill ftllftt at ·intervals, when held only
at one extremity, and kept quite ftiU; but, if it be grafped by the otber
band at the fame time in a different plaee, ftrong fla~s of light wi11
hardly eYer fail to dart from one end to the other, and thefe will con-
tinue twenty-four hours, and longer, without any frelh excitation. An
arched doable barometer, of a contiderable height, is an improvement of
.this contrivance, for exhibiting the appearance ofan Aurora Borealis·by
meaos of the elecb-ic fire. Sig. Beccaria, who has purfued' his obferva..
tions on atmofphericat eleBricity farther than any of his afTociates m
tbefe inquiries, conjeClures that there is a confiant and regular circu}a..
tion of the eleClric fluid from north to fouth; and he thinks, that the
Aurora Borealis may be this eletlric matter performing its circulation in
fuch a fiate of the atmofphere as renders it vifible, or approachiog nearer
die earth than ~liaal. · Dr. Franklin fuppofes, that the deBrical fir~ dif-
ciw1'gtd into the polar regioos from many lciagues of vaporifed air raifed'
f.-om the ocean betw-een the tropics, accounts· for tbe Aurora Borealif~

930 AN ILLUSTRATION
All this, however, appears to be little more than the co.njetlural (pecu-
lation of modern philofophers.: The ancients, it is plain, never faw
this phenomenon ; nor .c:Jid it ever occur in tbe.ir days, fince uo mention
whatever is made of it in their writings ; nor is any notice taken of it in
the r~cor~s of the mQderns until the year I 574-t which is the firft time,
I believe, the Aurora Borealis ever made its appearance in the world;
and, being a new phenomenon in natur~, muft undoubtedly have been
prod~ced by fome great conjunCtion, or by the violent heat of fome
invifible comet, or by .a variation in the frame and fyftem of the world,
or of the heavenly bodies, which at that particular zra muft have taken
place, and which ftill.coutinues, at times, to produce the fame luminous
and fiery appearance.
Blazing jlars are fiery luminous appearances generated in the upper
region of the air, and formed into a body, whence they take.an obl1que
direaion with aftonifiling velocity, and defcend to tbe earth. The light
they convey will fometimes exceed that of the Moon, as was the cafe a
few years fince with a very remarkable one, which paffed from north to
fouth, very .near the furface of the earth, and was fuppofed to fall into
the.fea. Their appearance:: is at once beautiful and tremendous.
· Signi~r Beccaria, in one. of his philofophical papers, makes mention of
a very remarkable one, \Vhich appeared about an hour after fun-fet, and
direaed ita courfe imd)ediately towards the fpot where he and fome
friends were walking. It grew apparently larger and larger as it ap-
proached, aod went off very near them ; when it left their faces, hands,
and· clothes, with the earth, and .aH the neigh~\\ring objeas, fuddenly
illuminated with a diffufed and lambent light, without any vifible noife.
Blazing ftars are. Jikewife underftood by fome to mean comets, on
account of their tails, or extended train of tight on fire, which is.obfervcd
to i1Tue from them. But, as the doarine of comets is au immenfe fpecu-
Jation, I filall treat of them under a diftinCl and feparate bead.
Of C 0 MET S.
A comet is now certainly defined to be a heavenly body, iu the plane-
tary region, appearing fuddenly, and again difappearing; aud, during
the time of its appearance, moving in a proper though very eccentric
orbit, like a planet. As to their nature, the unfrequency of their
appearing, together with tbe feemjug irregularities of their phenomena,

diftances of places from the Sun.· Wb.ereforc, fitlce the diftance of that·
comet in its perihelion, December the Sth, was obfcrved to be to the dif-
·tancc ofthc Earth .from the Sun nearly as 6 to tooo; the Sun's heat in
the comet, at that time, was to his beat with us at Midfummer, as
·rooooOo to 36, or ~8000 to_ 1. And again, finding by experiment that
the beat of boiling water is little more than three times the beat Qf our
dry earth, when expofed to the Midfummcr's Sun; and afiuming the heat
of red-hot iron to be about three or four times as great as that of boiling
water ; be thence concludes, that the beat of the dried earth, or body of
the comet in its perihelion, mufr be ncar ~ooo times as great as that of
red-hot iron.
Such an immenfc heat once acquired in its perihelion, the. comet muft
be a long time in cooling again. The fame author computes, that a
globe of red-bot iron, of the dimenfions of our earth, would fcarccly be
·cool in 5000 years. If then the comet be fuppofed to cool 100 times
as faft as red-hot iron, yet, fince its heat was ~000 times greater, fup-
pofing it of the bigncfs of the earth, it would not be cool in a milJion of
years.
James BernouiiJi, in his Syftema Cometarum, fuppofes fomc primary
planet revolving round the Sun in the fpace of four years and one hun-
dred and fifty-fevcn days, and at the difrancc from his body of ~583
femidiameters of the magnus orbis ; this planet, he concludes, either
from its vafi: diftance or fmallnefs, to be invifible to us ; but, however,
to have, at various diftances from him, fevcral fatcllites moving round
him, and fometimes defcending as low as the orbit of Saturn ; and that
thefe, becoming vifiblc to us when in their pcrigaeum, are what we call
comets.
Des Cartes advances another opinion ; he conjeelures that comets are
only ftars, formerly fixed, like the reft, in the heavens; but which, be-
coming by degrees covered with maculz, or fpots, and at length wholly
robbed of their light, cannot keep their place, but are carried otf by the
vortices of the circumjaccnt ftars; and, in proportion to their magnitude
and folidity' moved m ·fuch manner as to be brought nearer the orb Of
Saturn ; and thus, coming within reach of the Sun's light, rendered
vifible. ·
But the vanity of all thefe bypothcfes abundantiy appears from the
phenomena of comets ; the chief of which arc as follow : J ft. Tbofe

·Thefe are the chief phenomena of comets; which, it is evident, cannot
eafily be reconciled with the wild notions of the ancients, and the weak

tells us, among the ancients, who, "had jufter notions; who took thefc
" ftars to be perpetual, and believed they moved in their proper orbs ;
" but were never feen, unlefs when left by the Sun." Apollonius
Myudius declared, that he took comets for regular ftars; and ventured to
foretel, that one day the periods ·a.nd laws of their motion would be
difcovered. And more fully Seneca, Queft. Nat. lib. vii. cap. 25. "I

" fire, but efteem it among the eternal works of nature." Quid auum

936 AN ILL·USTRATION
The nuclei, which we occafionally call the heads and bodies of comets,
viewed through a telefcope' thow a very different face from thofc of tbe
fixed ftars, or planets. They arc liable to apparent changes, which Sit'
Ifaac Newton afcribes to changes in the atmofphere of comets ; ~nd this
opinion was confirmed by obfervations of the comet in 1744· StuFmius
tells us, that, obferving the comet of 1680 with a telefcope, it appeared
like a coal dimly glowing, or a rude mafs of matter illuminated with a
dufky fumid light, lefs fenfible at the extremes than in the middle-
; rather
than as a ftar, which appears with a round difk, and a vivid light. ·
Hevelius obferved of the comet of 1661, that its body was of a yel-
lowith colour, very bright and confpicuous, but without ~ny glittering
light: in the middle was ~ denfe ruddy nucleus, almoft equal to Jupiter,
encompaffed with a much fainter thinner matter. On February the sth,
its bead was fomewhat bigger and brighter; of a gold colour;- but its
Jight more duiky than the refi: of the ftars: here, the nucleus appeared
divided into feveral parts. February the 6th, the difk was leffened; the
nuclei ftill exified, though lefs than before; one of them, on the lower
part of the dific, on the left, much denfer and brighter than the ·reft: its
body round, and reprefenting a very lucid little ilar: the nuclei ftill cn-
compaffed with another kind of matter. February Ioth, the head Come-
what more obfcure, and the nuclei more confufed, but brighter at top
than bottom. February 13th, the head diminifued much, both in mag-
nitude and brightnefs. March 2d, its roundnefs a little impaired, its
edges lacerated, &c. March 28th, very pale and ex:eeding thi.n; its
matter much difpe_rfe~; and no difiintt nucleus at all Appearing.
Weigelius, who faw the comet of 1664, the Moon, and a little cloud
illuminated by the Sun at the fame time, obferved that the Moon,
through the telefcope, appeared of a continual luminous furface ; but the
comet very different;- being perfeClly like a little cloud in the horizon,
·illuminated by the Sun. From thefe obfervations it was, that Hevelius
concluded comets to be like maculre, or fpots, formed out of the folar
exhalations.
The eftimates that have been given by Tycho, Hevelius, and fome
others, of the magnitude of comets, are not fufficiently accurate to be
depended upon; for it does not appear, that they difiinguitbed between
the nucleus and the furrounding atmofphere. Thus Tycbo computes
that the true diameter of the comet in 1577 was in proportion to the
diameter of the eartb as 3 is to 1+ Hevelius made the diameter of the
comet of 165~ to that of the earth as 52 to 100. Tbc diameter of
the

'I
0 F A S T R 0 L 0 G Y. 937
the atmofphere ·is ·often ten or fifteen times as great as that ot" the
nucleus : the former, in the comet of 1682, when meafured by Flam-
freed, was found to be two minutes, but the diameter of the nucleus only
eleven feconds. Some comets, from the apparent magnitude and dif-
taucc compared, have been judged to be much larger than the Moon,
.and even equal to fome of the primary planets. · The diameter of that
of 1744, when at the diftance of the Sun from .us, meafured about one
minute, and therefore its diameter mufi: be about three times the diameter
of the Earth : at another time the diameter of its nucleus was nearly
equal to that of Jupiter. ·
The lengths of the tails of comets are various, and depend on a variety
of circumftances. Longomontanus mentions a comet that in 1618,
December 1o, had a tail above a hundred degrees in length ; that of
t68o, according to Sturmius, about the 20th of November, was but
fmalJ ; at mofi, not exceeding twenty degrees in length ; in a little time
.it grew to a length of i1xty degrees, after which it dwindled very fenfi;..
hly. The comet of 1744- bad a tail which at one time appeared to
extend above fixteen degrees from its body; and which, allowing the
Sun's parallax ten feconds, muft have been above twcnty...three millions
of mi'les in length.
Sir Ifaac Newton .thows, that the atmofphere. of comets will furnilh
vapour fufficient to form their tails ; this he argues from that wonderful
rarefatlion obferved in our air at a diftance from the.earth: a cubic inch
of common air, at the diftance of half the earth's diameter, or four
thoufand miles, would neceffarily expand itfelf fo far as to fill a fpace
larger than the whole region of ftars. Since then the coma or atmo-
.fphete of a comet is ten times higher than the furface of the nucleus,
counting from the centre thereof, the .tail, afcending much higher, muft
.neceffarily be immenfely rare; fo that it is no wonder the ftars thould be
.v.ifible through it.
Now, the afceut of vapours into the tail of the comet he fuppofes
occafioned by tile rarefatlion of th~ matter of the atmofpbere at tbe
·.time of the perihelion. Smoke, it is obferved, afcends the chimney by
the impulfe of the air wherein it floats; and air, rarefied by beat, afcends
.by the diminution of its fpecific gravity, taking up tbe fmoke along with
.it ; why theil 1hou)d not the tail of a comet be fuppofed to be raifed after
the fame manner by the Sun i for the fun-beams do not aCt on the
. mediums they pafs through any otherwife than by rcfteCl:ion and rarefac."-
.tiou. The refteBing particles, then, being warmed by the aCti011, w~ll

again warm the ether wherewith they arc compounded ; and this, rare-
ned by the beat, will have its·fpeci6c gravity, whereby it before tended
to defcend, diminiihed by the rarefaaion, fo as to afccnd, and .carry
along with it thofc refleBing particles whereof th~ tail of the comet is
.codlpofed. .This afcent of the vapours will be promoted by their circu-
lar motion round the ·Sun ; by means whereof, they will endeavour to
recede from the Sun, while the Sun's atmofphere, and the other m;~.ttcrs
io the celeftial fpaces, are either at reft, or nearly fo; as having .no
motion but what they receive·from the Sun's circumrotation. Thus are
the vapours raifed into the tails of comets in the neighbourhood of the
Sun, where the orbits arc moft curve ; and where the comets, being
within the denfer atmofpbcre of the Sun, have their tails of the greatcft
length.
The tails thus produced, by prefcrving that motion, and at the fame
time gravitating toward the Sun, will move round his body in cllipfes, in
like manner as their beads; and by this means, will ever accompany,
and freely adhere to, their head. In effea, the gravitation of the vapours
towards the Sun will no more occafion the tails of the comets to forfake
their beads, and fall down ~owards the Sun, than the gravitation of their
heads will occafion them to fall off from their tails; but by their com-
mon gravitation they will either fall down togedier to the Sun, or be
together fufpended or retarded. This gravitation, therefore, docs not at
.all hinder but that the b~ads and tails·of comets may receive and retain
any pofition towards each other, which either the above-mentioned
caufes or .4!ny other may occafion. The tails, therefore, thus produced
in the perihelion. of comets, will go off, along with their beads, into
remote regions ; and either return thence, together with the comets, after
a .long ieries of years ; or rather be there loft, and vanilh by little and
little,. and the comets be left bare ; till at their return, defcending towards
the Sun, fome little thort tails are gradually and flowly produced from
the heads; which, afterwards, in the perihelion, defcending into the Sun's
atmofphere, will be immeufely increafed.
The vapours, when they are thus dilated, rarefied, and diffufed through
aU the celeftial regions, the f~me author obferves, may probably, by little
and little, by -means of their own gravity, be attraaed down to the
planets, and become intermingled with their atmofphercs. He adds like-
wife, that, for the confervation of the water aud moifture of the planets,
-
comets feem abfolutely requifite; from whofe condenfed vapours and
exhalations, all that moifture, which is fpent in vegetations and putre-
faaions, and turned into dry earth, &c. may be re-fupplied and re-
cruited.

cruited. For all vegetables grow and increafe wholly from fluids; and,
again, as to their greatefi: part, turn, by putrefaClion, into earth again ;
an earthly flime being perpetually precipitated to the bottom of putrefy-
ing liquors. Hence the quantity of dry earth mufr continually increafe,
and the moifiure of the globe decreafe, and at laft be quite evapOl'ated,
if it had not a continual fi.tpply from fome part or other of the univerfe.
And I fttfpect, adds our great author, that the fpirit, which makes the
finefr, fitbtileft, and the befi, part of our air, and which is abfolutely
requifite for the life and being of aU things, comes principally from the
comets.
On this principle, there feems to be fome foundation for the popular
opinion of prefages from comets ; fince the tail of a comet, thus inter-
mingled wi~h our atmofphere, may produce changes very fenfible in ani-
mal and vegetable bodies. Another ufe which he conjectures comets may
be defigned .to ferve, is that of recruiting the Sun with frefh fuel, and re-
pairing the confumption of his light by the ftreams continuaJly fent forth
in every direCtion from that luminary. ln fupport of this conjeCture he
obferves, that comets in their perihelion may fuffer a diminution of their
projectile force by the retlllance of the fola.r atmofphere; fo that by de-
grees their gravitatio11 towards the SUJ1 may be fo far increafed as to pre-
cipitate their fall into his body.
There have been various conjeCtures about the generation of the tails
of comets. Appian, Tycbo Brahe, and fome others, apprehended that
they were produced by the Sun's rays tranfmitted through the nucleus of
the comet, which they fuppofed to be tranfparent, and there refracted as
in a lens of glafs, fo as to form a beam of light behind the CO.JDet. Des
Cartes accounted for the phenomenon of the tail by the rarefaCtion of light
from the head of the comet to the eye of the fpectator. Mairan fuppofes
that the tails are formed out of the luminous matter that compofes the
Sun's atmofphere ; M. De Ia Lande combines this ·hypothefis with that
of Newton above recited. Mr. Rowning, who is not fatisfied with Sir
Ifaac's opinion, accounts for the tails ofcomets iu the following manner:
It is well known, fays he, that, when the light of the Sun paffes
through the atmofphere of any body, as the Earth, that which paffes
on one fide is, by the rarefaCtion thereof, made to converge towards that
which paffes on the oppofite one; and the convergency is not wholJy ef-
feCled either at the entrance of the light into the atmofphere, or at its go-
ing out ; but, beginning at its entrance, it increafes in every point of its
progrefs. It is alfo agreed, that the atmofpheres of the comets are very
large and denfe, He therefore fuppofes that? by fi1ch time as the light

of the Sun has paffed through a totilidet'able patt of the atmofphere'of-a
comet, the rays thereof ai·e fo fat r~fraCled to·watds mch other, that they
then begin fenfibly to illuminate it, or rather the vapouri floatlrig therein•
and fo render that part they have yet to pafs through vifible to us : and
tha.t this portion of the ~tt_nofphere ~f a comet th\ls illuminated appear.s to
us m form of a beam of tb~ Sun's ltght, and ·paffea under the denomsila...
tion of a comet's tail. ·
We have an enquiry into the caufe of the tails of con\et6, by Mr. Eu..
ler. He thinks there is a great affinity between thefe tails, the zodiacal
Ji~t, and the Aurora Borealis ; and that the. common caufe of them all
is the action of the Sun's light on the atmofphere of the comets, of the
Sun, and of the Earth. He fuppofes, that the i1Dpulfe of the rays of
light on the atmofpbere of comets may drive fome of the finer particles
of that atmofphere far beyond its limits ; and that this force of impulfe,
combined witn that of gravity towards the comet, would produce a tail,
which would always be in oppoution to the Sun, if the comet did not
move. But the motion of the comet in its orbit, and about its axis, mull:
vary the pofition and figure of the tail, giving it a curvature, and devia-
tion from a line drawn from the centre of the Sun to that of the comet ;
and that this deviation will be greater, as the orbit of the comet has the
greater curvature, and the motion of the comet more rapid. It may
even happe~, ~hat the velocity of the comet, in its perihelion, may be fo
great, that th.e force 9f.the Sun's rays may produce a new tail before the
old one. can .folto~ ; in which cafe the comet might have two or mote
tailB. 1'be partibility o( this is confirmed by the ~omet of 1744, which
was obferved to have fcweral tails while it was in its perihelion.
Dr. HamHton urges teveral objetlions aga1n£l the Newtonian hypGthe..
fis ; and concludes that the tail of acomet is formed of lhatte& which hath
not the po~r of refrafling or refletling the rays of light : but that it is
a lucid or felf-thining fubfiance, and, from its fnniJa·rity to the Aarora
13orealis, p~oduced by the famt ~aufe, ·and is a .ptopet :electrical phenome-
non. Dr. Halley feemed inclined to this hypothefis, when he faid, tbat
the 1l:reams of light in the Aurota Borealis fo much ·tefemMe<l the Jorrg
_ tails of comets, that at firft fight they might well be takeh for fuch : this
light feems to have a great affinity to that which ele&ric bodies ·emit in
the dark. ·
M. Fatio has foggefted, that fome of the comets have their nodes fo
very near the annual orbit of the earth, that, if.the earth lhmdd ·hap-.
·pen to be found in that par\ next the node, 'at the timeofa comet's palling

by~ the mofl: dteadtUl c:onfequenc~ might be apprehended; as the appa-
rent motion of the comet will be incredibly fwift, fo its parallax will be-
come very fenfible ; and the proportion ·thereof to that of the·Sun will be
given: whence fuch tranfits of comets will afford the befl: means of de-
termining the difiance of the Earth and Sun.
The comet of I 47l had a parallax· above twenty times greater than
that of the Sun; and, if that of I 618 had come down in the beginning
of March to its defceoding node, it would have been much nearer to
the Earth, and its parallax much more notable. But, hitherto, none has
threatened the Earth with a nearer appulfe than that of I 68o: for, by cal- ..
culation, Dr. Halley finds, that November I 1 th, I h. 6 min. P.M. that
comet was not above one femidiameter of the Earth to the northward of
the way of the Earth; at which time, had the Earth been in that part of
its orbit, the comet would have had a pa·rallax equaJ to that of the Moon.
What might have been the confequence of fo near au appulfe, a contaCt,
or, lafily, a !hock, of the celefl:ial bodies? Whifl:on fays, a deluge!
If the· paths of comets be fuppofed direclly parabolical, as fome have
imagined, it would follow, that, being impelled towards the SuD by a·
centripetal force, they defcend as from fpaces infinitely difi:ant; and by
their falls acquire fuch a velocity, as that they may again run ~ff into the
remotell: regions, _frill moving upwards with.fuch a perpetual tendency
as never to return. But the freqaem::y ot1tb.e1r appearance, and. their de-
grc~ of velocity, which does not exceed what tbey might acquire by their
gravity towards the Sun, feems to put it pall: doubt that they Olove, planet-
like, in elliptic orbits, though exceedingly eccentric; and fo return
again, after very long periods. The apparent velocity of the comet of
I 4-7'l, as obferved by Regiomontanus, was fuch as to carry it through
forty degrees of a great circle in twenty-four hours: and that of 1770
was obferved to move through more than forty-five degrees in the lafi:
twe?ty-five hours.
.
Newton, Ftamlleed, Halley, and the Englilb aGronomcrs. fecm fatif-
ned of the return of comets : Caffitti, and others .of the French, think it
~ifibly .probable ; ·but De la Hire, ·and others, oppofe it. Thofe ou the '
rmative fide fuppofe the comets to &fcribe orbits prodigio\Jlly ec:ce.ntric,
iofomuch that we can only fee them in a very fulall part of their revo.:-
lution; out of this, they are loft in 'the immcnfe fpaces; hid not Qnly
from our eyes, but from oar telefcopes. That little part of their orbit
near as, M. Caffini, &c. have found to ·pafs between the orbits of Venus
and Mars. 'For the reafons of ;the return of comets, M. Caffini gives
thefe
941 AN ILLUSTRATION
thefe which follow : I. In confidering the courfe of the comets, with
regard to the fixed fiars, they are found to keep a confiderable time in
the arch of a great c:irc1e, i. e. ·a circle whofe plane-paffes through the
centre of the earth; indeed, they deviate a little from it, chiefly towards.
the_ end of their appearance ; but this deviation is common to them with
the planets. 2. Comets, as well as planets, appear to move fo much the
fafier as they are nearer the earth ; and, when they are at equal diftances
from ·their perigee, their velocities ar~ nearly the fame.
By fubtracring from their motion the apparent inequality of velocity
occafioned by their different difiances from the earth, their equal motion·
might be· found ; hut we thould riot be certain this motion were their true
one i becaufe they might have confiderable inequalities, not diftiuguilh-
able in that fmall part of their orbit vifible to us. It is indeed probable,
that their real motion, as well as that of the planets, is unequal in itfelf:
and hence we have a reafon why the obfervations made during the ap-.
pearance of a comet cannot give:the jufi:._period of irs revolution. .
There are no two different planets whofe orbits cut the ecliptic in the
fame angle, whofe nodes are in the fame points of the ecliptic, and whofe
apparent' velocity in their perigee is the fame: confequently, twocomets
feen at different times, yet agreeing with all thofe thr~e circumftances1
can only be one and the iame comet. And this were the comets of 1577
aud I68o obferved to do, and thofe of I652. and I698 ; not that this ex-
aCt agreement, in thcfe circumfiances, is abfolutely ileceffary to deter-
mine them the fame comet. M. Caffini finds the Moon herfelf irregular
in them all : accordingly, he is of opinion, there arc fev~r~l which difa-
grec herein, and yet mar be ac~ount~d the fame. .
The great objeClion againfi the return of. comets, is, the rarity of their
appearance, with regard to the number of revolutions affigned to them.
In I 702, there was a comet, or rather the tail of one, teen at Rome~
which M. Caffini takes to be the fame with that obfervcd by Ariftotle,
and that fince feen in I 668, which would imply its period to be thirty-
four years. Now it may feem firange, that a fl:ar which h~s fo·(hort are.

feen.-Agaitt, in April ofthe fame year, 1702, a comet w~s obferved by
Melf. Bianchini and MaraJdi, fuppofed by the latter to be the fame with
that of x664, by reafon of its motion, velocity, and direction. M. de
la Hire took it to ·have fome.relation to anpther h~ had obfcrved·in I 698,

"There are many things in the comet of I 532, obferved by Peter Appian.
·which intimate its being the fame with that of 1607, obferv.ed by Kepler

but a little increafed, would change its elliptic orb into a parabolic one?
What farther confirms the ~dentity. is the- appearance~ -aoother. 8QJJ1et
in the fummer of 1456, which, though obferved by none with accuracy,.
yet, by its period and the manner of its tranfi.t, he concludes to be the.
fame ; a11d thence ventured to foretel its return in-the ~r t~ or the
beginning of the next year: and time has verified the _prediClion. It ap-
peared in March 1759· Halley alfo thought that the comet of ~68o il\'U-
tbe fame that was obferved in I 106, 531, and in the forty-4'6~b~ ~r­
before Chnfi, when Julius C~far was murdered,; and that ita:pc:C'iocl-<wu.
five hundred and feventy-five years. Mr. Dunthorne, in. the llbifOfo-
phical Tranfatlions, vol. xlvii. has endeavoured to lhow,. from~ IJS;.: in.
Pembroke-ball Library, that the comet of 1 1 o6 could not·1
bc ~{atfoe;
with that of 168o. But M. de la Lande adopts the opinion~ d(!Dr•.
Halley.
To determine the place and- courfe of a comet, ob(crve the difta.ricc of·
the comet from two fi:ud ftars whofe longitudes and latitudes are known:~ -
from the diftances thus found, calculate the place of the comet by trigo--
nometry ; and, by repeating the obfervatious and operatiom £or· .fever~t
days fucceffively, the courfe of the comet will be had. We might alfo.
d~termine the courfe of a comet mechanically, without any apparatus of
in{huments, by the following ingenious method, with a thread, which.
we owe to Longomontanus. Obferve four ftars round the comet, fuch.
as that the--comet may be in the interfeCliou of the right lines that join:,
the two oppofite fiars; which is eafily found hy means of a thread placed.
before the eye, and extended over-againft the ftars and comets. Find thefe.-
four ftars upon a globe,_ and extend. two threads crofsways, from one
corner to the other of the fquare fpace defcribed by the four fiars; and the·
central point,. where the threads interfc.Ct each other, will give the place-
of the comet. This praClice being repeated for feveral days, the comet's.
courfe will be had on the globe; which covrfe will be found to be a great-
circle, from any two points whereof it will be eafy to find its inclioatioo.

thread, ftz:etched through the two po1Ut&, cuts the eclaptlc. . .....
Such is the doCl:rine of comets, as laid down from time to.time both byt.
the ancient and modern philofophers ;... but which,_ like moll: other abfirufe ·
phenomena, is founded pretty much upon conjeClure and arbitrary concep-
tion. Should the comets of I 2.64 and I ss6 {which are fuppofed t~ be the.·
fame) appear in or about the year I 8-48, it will confirm a. great deal of
the foregoing fpeculation, as to their- poffeffing_a determinate place in the·

fyfiem; and will convince us that their revolutions, though extremely
eccentric, are neverthelefs 4efinable, and fuch as ma.y hereafter throw
great light upon philofophical difquifitions. ·
Dr. Halley conjeCtured, that the comet obferved by Apian in 1532
was the fame as that. obferved by Hevelius in I 66I ; if fo, it ought to have
returned in I 790, but it has never been obferved. But M. Mechain, hav-
ing colleCted all the obfervations in I 532, and calculated the orbit again,
found it to be fenfibly different from that determined by Dr. Halley, which
renders it very doubtful whether this was the comet which appeared in
1661; and this doubt is increafed by its not appearing in 1790. The
comet in 1770, whofe periodic time M. Lexell computed to be five years ·
and feven months, has not beeq obferved fince.
Of E C L I P S E S.
An EcLIPSR, from .x>...,J,,;, of IJtAmro, tofail, fignifies a failure or priva-
tion of the light of one of the luminaries, by the iqterpofiti0n of fome
dark or opaque body falling between it and the eye, or between it and
the Sun. The Moon, being a dark and opaque body, receives her light
from the Sun by- refleCtion; which is proved by her increafing and de-'
creating in light as Ole is uearer or farther off from her conjunCtions with
the Sun. At the ecliptical conjunCtion, or New Moon, the dark body of
the Moon paffes direCtly between the Sun and us, which hides that lumi-
nary from our fight, and this confiitutes an eclipfe of the Sun ; but at
an ecliptical oppofition, or Full Moon, the Sun, the Earth, and the
Moon, are in one direct and diametrical ·line ; the dark globe of the
Earth, being then between the Sun atld Moon, deprives the Moon of
t~c Sun's light, whereby ~:he becomes dark~ned and eclipfed, having no
light of her own. Ths:: lme or way whercm the Moon makes her con-
fiant periodical revolutions croffes the ecliptic wherein the Sun moves
at an.angle of about 1ive degrees ; the difiance of thefe lines conftitutes
the .Moon's latitude; and the places in the ecliptic which tbefe lines in-
terfea are called the Moon's nodes, or the Dragon's Head and Dragon's
Tail. Thefe interfeetions do not always happen in one place of the
ecliptic, but move once through the fame, contrary to' the feque] or fuc-
ceffion of the .tigns, in eighteen years arid two hundred and twentv-6ve
days.
If the Moon at full be diftant from the .Dragon's Head or Tail more
than fifteen degrees, there can be no eclipfe of the Moon; and, when at
No. 49· 11 C the

the time of the chat.tgt> the·Moon is more than nineteen·d~grees diftant'
from the Dragon's Head, according to the fucceffion of the figns, there·
can be no eclipfe of the Sun ; neither can there be any eclipfc of the Sun
when the Moon at the change is above feven degrees from the Dragon's
Tail .according to the fucceffion of the figus, or more tban fevcn degrees
from the Dragon's Head contrary to the fucceffion of the figus.
Eclipfes of the Sun are various both in quantity aod quality, being·
beheld from different parts of the Earth; for he will appear partially
_
eclipfed to a fpe&tor on the north fide of his body, and totally to a
fpeClato~ on his fouth fide ; whilft to others he will appear at the fame
in.tlant not at all eclipfed. The reafoo is, the SWl in his eclipfes is uot ·
darkened, but only hidden from our fight by the ioterpofition of the Moon,·
whofe various parallaxes produce this diverfity in the Sun's eclipfe.
The eclipfe of the Moon, on the contrary, appears the fame to all parts
of the Earth, and to 1111 people above wbofe horizon ate is at that time
elevated ; for, when 1he is deprived of the light of the Sun, lhe becomes .
really darkened. To eftimate the quantities of the eclipfes of either lu-
minary, their diameters are fuppofedly divided into twelve equal parts,
called digits, becaufe their diameters appear to fight about a foot in
length; fo that, when the Moon obfcures half tbe Sun's diameter, be is ·
faid to be iix digits eclipfcd•
.Amongel: the orelefi:ial phenomena, the t'loClrine of eolipfes takes pre-
cedency ; becaufe from their obfervatioD the primary .fOundation · of·
the whole body of afrronQmy is danonftrued and oollbrmed. Hence the
folar eclipfes manifeft the.Moon to be lower and lefs than ·the Sun; the
lunar eclipfes prove that the Earth .is not founded infinitely beJow us, but
that the heavens under \tS arc dibat from the Earth as far upwards, in
refpca of our antipodes, as they are here:; and con~uemty tflat the
Earth is .aot cubical. pyramidal, nor cyliadrica1, but oo -eYCf'y fule per-
fectly r0111nd, or terminated by a globukr figu~; not only becaufe the
iliadow of the Earth in the Moon's body is always and on every part ob-
ferved to be .round, but alfo bccaufe tfaofe who live ea.ftwaro number
more hours from their meridian, for the beginning or·ending ofany eclipfe,
than fuch as live w~ftward, proportioaa~ly to tl)eir 4iiance.
Lunar eclipfes demonftrate the 1hadow of the Earth to be conical, ter-
minating in a .1harp point ; and the fame place of the Moon~ tt-anfits to
be fometimes thicker, ·and at other times mOl'e flen4er, notwithftanding
a certain rule and refpea had to the Sun's motion ; and confequen.tly that
the

the Sun is moved, Qr fo .feems to be, iq an eccentrical oro. By eclipfes
of the ·Moon ·we alf<:> know tl\at the Earth is moved or placed in the
middle of the zodiac, beca~fe ille' is eclipfed·in the oppofite places thereof.
The lunar eclipfes betl difcover to us the longitude of places upon the
Earth, and affure us that the Earth and Water make but one globe ; and
the oriental and occidental eclipfes of the Moon inform us, that one half
of the world is always vifible, and that one half of the zodiac rifes above
the horizon. ·
The true and certain place of the Mo~n cannot be had by any inftr\1-
ment w'hatfoever, becaufe of her parallaxes. Nature, or rather the God
of Nature, hath therefore fupplied this defeCt by her eclipfes; for the
Moon pofited in mediis tenebris is then underftood to be oppofite to the Sun,
by which means :the motions and mutations of the Moon are found out
and rationally demonftrated. And, as by lunar eclipfes we gather, that
the Sun is far greater than the Earth, and the Moon lefs, ·fo by folar

together with the ~agnitqdes of the feve.ral celeftial J>o4ies, .

fhad9w, then falling on the Moon, is confiderably greater than her di!k.
There may likewife,be total eclipfes within a little diftance of the nodes;
but, the farther, the lefs their duration; farther off frill, there are only
partial ones, and at length none at all, as the latitude and the femi-dia-
meter of the Moon, together, are either )efs, equal to, or greater, than
the femi-diameter of the ihadow. A lunar eclipfe, that is both total and
central, lafis three hours fifty-_feven minutes.6x feconds from the begin-
ning to the end when the Moon is in her apogee, and three hours thirty-
feven minutes twenty-fix fecouds when in perigee; her horary motion
being floweft in the .former cafe, and quickefr in.the latter. In all lunar
eclipfes, the eafiern fide is what firft immerges, and alfo emerges; fo that,
though at firfi the Moon be more wefierly than the Earth's thadow, yet,
her proper motion being fwifter than. the fame, fhe overtakes al1d outgoes
it. The Moon, .even iu the middle of an eclip(e, has ufually a faint ap-
pearance of light ref~mbling tarnifhed copper; which Gaffendus, Ricci- .
olus, Kepler, &c. attribute to the light of 'the Sun, refratled .by the
Earth's atmofphere, aud tranfmitted.thither: and, Ia.llly, ihe grows fen-
fibly paler, and dimmer, before the enters within the Earth's thadow;
whic~ is attributed to:the Earth's penumbra. ·
Solar ecliptes, being an occultation of the Sun's body occafione_
d .hy
ar. interpofition of the ·Moon between the Sun aud the Earth, are difiin-
guithed, like thofc: of the Moon, into total and partial, &c. to which muft
be added a third fpecies, called annular. As the Moon is found to have a
parallax of latitude, e~lipfes of the Sun.only happen when the. latitude of
the Moo~,. viewed_from the Earth, is lefs than the.ag~r.eg~te -o~ t.he ~ppa­
rent fem1d1ameters of the Sun and Moon. Solar ecllpf~s tb~~forc onl.Y
happen when the Moon is in conjunCtion· with the Sun~ -iu··~r. n~ar the·
nodes, i. e. at the new moons. Confequently, the memorable ecli.pfe

total; and·with fome continuance, when the difk of the Moon in periga:o
appears greater than that of the Sun in apogreo, an<J its thadow is extended
beyond the furface of the Ea~th ; and without continuallce, at mod~rate
. difiances, when the cufp 9r point of the Moon's thadow barely touches
the Earth: lafrly, out of the 11odes, but near them, the eclipfes arc
.partial. The folar eclipfcs, though total, can never be uuiverfal or
vifiblc throughout the whole hemifphere which the Sun is then above,
becaufe the Moon's dark thadow covers ·only a fpot on the Earth's fur-
face about one hundred and eighty Englith miles broad, when the Sun..s
-
difiancc is greateft, and the Moon's leafi.; and thus far only can the to-
tal darknefs ext~nd; which explains the reafon why a folar eclipfe don
not appear the fame in all parts of the earth where it is feen; but, whei1
in one place it is total, in another it is only partial. And farther, that
the Moon, when, in her aposee, appears much lefs than the Sun, as hap.:.
pens moft fenfibly when he ts in perigreo; the cufp of the lunar thadow
not then reaching the Earth, 1he becomes in a central conjuntlion
with the Sun, yet not able to cover his dific, but lets his whole limb
appear like a lucid ring or bracelet ; this is hence called an annular eclipfe;
which doei not happen at the fame time in all places where it is feen ;
but appears more early to the weftern parts, and later to the eaftern, as
will hereafter be farther explained. ' ·
In mo£1: folar eclipf~s, the Moon•s dilk is covered with a faint dawning
light; which is attributed to the reflection of the light from the illumi-
nated part of the Earth. In total eclipfes of the Sun, the Moon's limb
is feen furrounded by a pale circle of light; which fome aftronomers take
for a manifeft indication of a lunar atmofphere ; but which is probably
the atmofphere of the Sun ; becaufe it has been obferved to move equally
with the Sun, and not with the Moon; and befides, the Moon is now
generally believed to have no atmofphere. · The foregoing obfervations
will be farther illuftrated by what follows. . .

C, to touch it, much lefs to hide or eclipfe·any part thereof. But, at-a
certain point M in the Moon's orbit~ the Moon wm have a latitude only
equal to the fum of the femi-diameters·of the Sun and Moon ;- and there. ·
fore, when the Moon is new in that point, the will appear .to a fpedator
in the point Z, to touch the Sun only; whence this point M is called the
ecliptic limit, inafmuch as it is impoffible there. Lhauld pappen a New
Moen in any part between it and the node B on each fide, without eclip..;
ling the Sun lefs or more: thus, in the figure,- may be feen a partial
cclipfe at K, and a total one in the node itielf B, at .which poillt only
total eclipfes can happen.
What has hitherto been faid regards the phenomena of an .cclipfe of
the Sun, as they appear to a fpeClator on the Earth's furface, in whofe
zenith the Moon then is, and when there is no refraClion to alter the.true
latitude of the Moon: but, whe~ the Moon has any latitude, there the
procefs of calculating the appearances of a folar cclipfe wilL be.fomewhat
more complex, on account of the variation of the Moon's latitude and
·longitude'for every different altitude, and confequently for every moineu.l
f>f the eclipfe. · · .
The befi: way of reprefcnting a folar eclipfe, is by a proje8ion:of the.
Earth's dilk, and of the feClion of the dark and penumbral Lhadows as
they appe;tr, or would ·appear, to a fpechitor at, a diftance of the M()on
jn a right line joining the centres of the Sun and the Earth. Iat order to
this, we are to find the dimenftons of the apparent femi-diarneters of the
·Earth, dark iliadow, and penumbra, at the difiance of the Moors. As .to
the 1irft, viz. the Earth's femi-diameter, it is equal to the Moon's bori,.
~o.ntal parallax. That of the dark thadow is th~ efiima~cd ; Let C, ·iu
fig. J' be the centre of the _Moon, DB its dia~cter, D.H B its dark
~adow~ _ and. KAL the penumbral cone. Then let EF bc .thC_dia..
.meter of the penumbra at the E;Jrth, and I G that of tbe.dark thadow.,
•nd draw C G and C E ; then is the angle C G B==B H C+G C H.
~md fo G C H~B G C-B H C ; that is, the apparent f~i-diam•cr
of the da.-k 1hadow is equal to the ditfer.e~cc between. -the app.lfel\t
femi-diameters of the Sqn a.nd Moon. And in ·tike m•,~~r tbe angle
E C H==-D E C+D A C; that is the apparent femi...d~~tc:r of tb~
penumbra, at the Earth, i$ equal to the fum of the appar~nt kQli•

and greatefi eccentricity of the Juuar orbit, in the afironomical tables. -
Therefore, let 1£, lE, lE, lE, fig. J, reprefent a fmall portion of the an-
nual orbit, aud F H the vifible path ofthe centreofthe Junadhadows, which
will exacHy correfponc.l to the pofition of the Moon's orbit with refpeCl to
the ecliptic in the heaveus; fo that the point of interfection Q will be the
node, and the angle H Q E the angle of inclination of the lunar orbit to
the plane of the ecliptic, which is about 5°· Hence, if ~PQS repre-
fen~ the difk of the Earth, according to the ·orthographic projeCtion, in
the feveral places '?>, B, C, D, whofe femidiameter is made equal to the
_ number of minutes 1n the Moon's horizoutal parallax at the time of the
cclipfe; and if, in the path of the thadows in the points Q, R, N, G, ·
we defcribe a fmall circle whofe femidiameter is equal to the difference '
of the femidiameters of the Sun and Moon, that will be the circular fec-
tion of the Moon's dark thadow at the difiauce of the Earth. Again, if a
circle is defcribed on the fame centre, with a femidiameter equal to the
fum of the femidiameters of the Sun and Moon, it will reprefent the pe-
numbral thadow exprelfed by the thaded area. Here then it is evident,
that if the Moon, when new, be at the difiance Q G from the node, the
penumbral thadow will not fall near the Earth's difk, and fo there cannot
poffibly happen an eclipfe. Again, if the Moon~s difiance from the node
be equal to Q N, the penumbral thadow will jufi touch the difk, and
confequently Q C is the ecliptic limit, which may be found by the fol-
lowing analogy, viz. As ~he fine of the angle N ~ C=so 30' (the angle
of inclination of the lunar orbit to the plane of the ecliptic) is to the ra-
dius =90°, fo is the logarithm of the fide N C=T C +NT=62' 1o"
+ I 6' 52"+ 16' 23"=95' 25'' to the logarithm of the fide Q C, equal to
_the ecliptic limit, which is found to be 16° 36', beyond which difiance
from the node Q there can be no eclipfe; and within that difiance, if the
Moon be new, the thadow will fall on fome part of the Earth's diik, as-
at B; where all thofe places over· which the fl1adows pafs will 1ee the
Sun eclipfed, in part only, by the dotted penumbral thac.low; but the Sun
will be centrally eclipfed in all places over which the centre of the fha-
dows pafs; and, if the Moon be new in the node, then will the centre of
the thadows pafs over the centre of the ditk, as reprefented at' Q. In this
cafe, if the apparent diameter of the Moon be greater than that of the
fun, the face ofthe Sun will be wholly eclipfed to all places over which the
centre of the thadow paffes; but, if not, the Sun will ouly be centrally
edipfed, his circumference appearing in the form of a bright annulus,
or luminous riuio-, the width whereof wilJ be equal to the difference of the
diameter of the uminaries. The difk of the Earth, here projected, re- .

tic, JE Q the equator, X Y the axis of the ecliptic, P S the axis of the
equator, P and S the north and fouth poles, &c. By this projeClion the
paffage of iliadows over the Earth's difk may be exhibited for any place
of the Sun, or declination of the Moon.
To find the digits eclipfed, add the apparent femidiameters of the
luminaries into one fum ; from which fubtraa the Moon's apparent la-
titude; the remainder are the fcruples, or parts of the diameter, eclipfed.
Then fay, As the femidiameter of the Sun is to the fcruples eclipfed, fo
are 6 digits reduced into fcruples (or 360 fcruples) to the digits ecJipfed.
To determine the duration of a folar eclipfe, find the horary motion of
the ~loon from the Sun for one hour before the conjunClion and another
hour after: then fay, As the former horary motion is to the feconds in au
hour, fo are the fcruples of half-duration to the time of immerfion; and,
as the latter horary motion is to the fame feconds, fo are the fame fcru-
ples of half-duration to the time of immerfion. Laftly, adding the time
of immerfion to that emerfion, the aggregate is the total duration.
As ·different authors folJow very different bypothefes, with regard to
the apparent diameters of the luminaries, and the greateft parallax of la-
titude, they differ much in affigning the bounds at which folar eclipfes
happen. Ptolomy makes the utmoft bounds of eclipfes at 19° 25' dillaoce
from the node ; Copernicus, at I 9° I 1.'; Tycho, at I So 1.5'; Kepler at
17° I 6'; Ricciolus, at I So 49'. Though Ptolo,my in other places judges
I6° 41.' difiance from the node neceffary; Copernicus, 16v ·25'; Tycho,
17° 9'; Kepler, IS0 ss'; and Ricciolus, IS0 s8'. Aftronomers have ge-
nerally affigned ·It as the limit of folar ecliptes; but this admits of fome
variation; for, in apogeal eclipfes, the folar limit is but 16!' degrees, and
in perigeal eclipfes it is I St.
, The Moon's apparent diameter, when largeft, exceeds the Sun's, when
leafl, only one minute and thirty-eight feconds of a degree; and, in the
greatefi folar eclipfe that can happen at any time and place, the total
darknefs can continue no longer than whilft the Moon is moving through
x' 38'' from the Sun in her orbit, which is about three minutes thirteen
feconds of au hour; for the motion of the thadow on the Earth's difk is
equal to the Moon's motion from the Sun, which, on account of the
Earth's revolution on its axis towards the fame way, or eaftward, is about
30~ minutes of a degree every hour, at a mean rate ; but fo much of the
Moon's orbit is equal to JO!" deg. of a great circle on the Earth, becaufe the
- circumference

circumference ot the Moon's orbit is 6o times that of the Earth; and
·therefore the Moon's fitadow goes 3~ degrees, or 1830 geographical
·miles, in an hour, or JO!" miles in a minute.
To find the Moon's apparent latitude at the beginning and end of an
eclipfe, it requires only to fubtraet, from the argument of the Moon's
latitude computed for the time of the apparent conjunCtion, the fcruples
of half-duration, together with the motion of the Sun anfwering to the
time of incident; the remainder is the argument of latitude at the be-
ginning of the eclipfe. To the fame fum add the fame fcruples, together
with the Sun's motion anfwering to the time of emergence; the aggre-
gate is the argument of latitude at the end of the eclipfe. The argument
of the latitude given, the Moon's true latitude is found after the common
manner.
To calculate eclipfes of the Sun, the following data are requifite: 1.
Find the mean New Moon, and thence the true one; together with the
place of the luminaries for the apparent time of the true one. ~. For the
apparent time of the true New Moon, compute the latitude feen. 3· For
the apparent time of the New Moon feen, compute the latitude feen. 4·
Thence determine the digits eclipfed. S· Find the times of the greatefr
darknefs, immerfien, and emerfion. 6. Thence determine the beginning
and ending of the eclipfe. From the preceding problems it is evident,
that all the trouble and fatigue of the calculus arife from the parallaxes
of longitude and latitude; without which the calculation of folar eclipfes
would be the fame with that of lunar ones. But eclipfes, both of the
Sun and Moon, might be calculated with much more eafe and expedition
by the help of a book of Tables, publilhed for that purpofe by Mr. Fer-
gufon, to which I beg leave to refer the reader, to fave him the trouble
of fuch calculations.
To PROJECT ECLIPSES oF THB MOON.
Thefe being occafioned by the immerfion of the Moon into the Earth's
lhadow, all that we have to do, in order to delineate a lunar ·edipfe, is
to calculate the apparent femidiameter of the Earth's ihadow at the. ·Moon.
Thus, let A B, fig. 6, reprefent the Earth, T its centre, A E B its conical
ihadow, DC the diameter of a feetion thereof at the Moon; and, draw-
ing DT, we have the outward angle AD:T=DTE+DET; fo that
D T E=A D T-D E T ; that is, the angle D T E, under which the·
femidiameter of the .Earth's 1hadow appears at the diftance oi the
Moon,
oigili'"d by Gool
-
AN ILLUSTRATION
Moon, is equal to the difference between the Moon's horizoQtal parallax
AD T and the femidiameter ~f the Sun DE T. If, therefore, A E,
1ig. ~' reprefc:nt the path of the Earth's fuadow at the diftance of the
Moon near the node e, and F H, a part of the lunar orbit, and the fec-
tion of the Earth's fuadow be delineated at e, B, C, D; and the full
Moon at e, I, N, G; then it is evident there c~n be no eclipfe of the
Moou where the leaft difiance of the centres of tbe Moon and fuadow
exceeds the fum of their femidiameters, as at D. But, where this dif-
tance is lefs, the Moon muft be eclipfed either iri part or wholly, as at B
and e; in which latter cafe the Moon paffes over the diameter of the
1hadow. But.in a certain pofition of the fuadow, as at C, the lea£1: dif-
tance of the centres, N C, is equal to.the fum of the femidiameters; and
confequently e C is the ecliptic limit for lunar eclip(es: to 1ind whic~,
we have this analogy, As the fine of the angle N e C=so (the inclina-
tion of the Moon's orbit to the plane of the ecliptic) is to the radius, fo is
tbe logarithm ofthe fide N C=6J1
I 1." to the logarithm ofthe fide e C=I 2°
51
== the ecliptic limit. Hence, if the Moon be at a lefs difiance from
·the node e than I '1.0 51
, there will be an eclipfe; otherwife none can
happen. .
If 'the Earth had no atmofphere, the fuadow would be abfolutely dark,
and the Moon involved in it quite invifible; but, by Qleans of the atmof-
phere, many ofthe folar rays are refraCted into and mixed with the ihadow,
whereby the Moon is rendered vifible in the midft of it, and of a dufky
red colour.
/
For calculating eclipfes of the Moon, the following data are necelfary:
1. Her true difl:ance from the node, at the mean conjunCtion. 1.. The
true time of the oppofition, together with the true place of the Sun and
Moon, reduced to the ecliptic. 3· The Moon's true latitude at the time
of the true conjunCtion, and the diftance ofthe luminaries from the Earth :
alfo their horizontal parallaxes, and apparent femidiameters. 4· The
true borary motions ofthe Moon and Sun, and the apparent femidiameter
·of the Earth's ihadow. With thefe data it is eafy to find tbe duration
beginning, middle, and quantity, of eclipfes.
The number of eclipfes, of both luminaries, in any year, cannot be
lefs than two nor more than feven; the moft ufual number is four, and
it is rare to have more than fix. The reafon is obvious; becaufe the
Sun palfes by both the nodes hut once a-year, unlefs he paffes b.y one of
them in the beginning of the year; in which cafe he will pafs by the

node, and begin to come in at the fouth pole of the Earth, wilt go a lit-
tle northerly at each .return, ·till·~t )aft t~ey quite leave the -Earth at the·
north pole. · · :
To exemplify this matter, it' may not here be amifs ·to examine fome
of the moll remarkable circumftances of the return of ail echpfe men-
tioned in Mr. Smith's ingenious Differtation, which happened July 14,
J 748, about noon. This eclipfe, after traverling the voids of fpace from
the creation, at laft began to enter the Terra Aujlralis I~~eognita about
eighty-eight years after the Conqueft, which was the ·laft of K.ing Ste-
phen's reign; every Chaldean period, namely, 18 years 11 days 7 hours
43 minutes 20 feconds, as above-mentioned'· it has conftantly crept' more
northerly, but was ftill invifible in Britain before the year 1·62~, when
on the 30th of April it began to touch.the fouth parts of England about
two in the afternoon ; its central appearance rifing iri the American South
Seas, and traverfing Peru and the Amazons country, through the Atlantic
Ocean into Africa, and fetting in the Ethiopian continent, not far from
the beginning of the Red·Sea. · · · ·
Its next vifible· period was after·three Chaldean revolutions, in 1676,
on the firft of June, rifing central iti the Atlantic ocean, paffing us about
nin~ in.the morning, with. four. di~its eclipfed on. the under limb; and
fettmg m the gulf of Cochm Chma m the Eaft ·Iudtes. · · ·
. . .
It being now near the folftice, this- eclipfe was vifible the very next
return in 1694, in th¢ evening ; and in two periods more, which was in
1730, on the 4th of Jul~, was fee~ above half eclipfed j~ft .after_fun-rife,
and obferved both at Wirtcmberg Itl Germany and at Pekm m Chma, fooo
after which it went off. Eighteen years more afforded us this ~clipfe
again, which happened the 14th of July, 1748. The next vifibJe retutn
happened on t~e 25th of July, 1761., in the evening, about four digits
eclipfed; and, after two periods more, it was vifible again,· on the 16tb
of ~uguft, 18o2, early in the morning, about five digits, the centre com-
ing from the north frozen continent, by the capes of Norway, through
Tartary, China, and Japan, to the Ladrone lflands, where it went otf. ·
Again, in r8zo, Auguft 26, betwixt one and two, there will be ana-'
tber return of this ecfipfe .at London about :IQ digits; but, happening fo
near the equinox, the centre will leave every part of Britain to the welt,
' .· aeater
Digitized by GoogIe
0 F A S T R. 0 L 0 G ·Y. ~I
.enter Germany at. Embden, paffing by Venice, Naples, and Grand Cairo,
and fet in the Gulf of Balfora near that city. It will be no more vifiblc
till 187~ when.five digits will be obfcured (the centre being now about
to leave the Earth) on September 38. In 1 89~ the Sun will go down
eclipfed at London, and again in 1928 the paffage of the centre will be in
the ezptmf~~~~~y though there will be two digits eclipfed at London, OCtober
the 31ft of that year; aud about the year 2090 the whole penumbra will
be worn off; whence no more returns of this eclipfe can happen till after
a revolution of ten thoufand years.
From thefe remarks 011 the entire revolution of this eclipfe, we may
gather, that a thoufand years, more or lefs, (for there are fome irregulari-
ties that may protraCt or lengthen this period too years,) complete the
whole terreftrial phenomena of any fingle eclipfe; and fince 20 periods of
·s+ years each, and about 33 days, comprehend the entire extent of their
revolution, it is evident that the times of the returns will pafs through a
circuit of one year and ten months, every Chaldean period being ten or
eleven days hater, and of the equable appearances about 32 or 33 days~
Thus, though this eclipfe happens about the middle of July, no other
fubfequent eclipfe of this period will return to the middle of the fame
month again; but wear conftantly each period ten or eleven days for-
ward, and at laft appear in winter; but then it begins to ceafe from af-
feBing us•.
Another conclufion from this revolution may be drawn, that there will
feldom be any more than two great eclipfes of the Sun in the interval of
this period, and thefe follow fometimcs next return, and oft.en at greater
diftances. That of 17I 5 returned again in 1733 very great; but this
prefent eclipfe will not be great till the arriva of 1820, which is a re-
volution of four Chaldean periods: fo that the regulations of their cir-
cuits mull undergo new computations to affign them exactly.
I
Nor do all cclipfes come in at the fouth pole: that depends altogether
on the pofition of the lunar nodes, which will bring in as many from the
expanfum one way as the other: and fuch edipfes will wear more foutherly
by degrees, contrary to ~hat hal>pens in the prefent cafe. . .
The eclipfe, for example, of 1736, in September, had its ccotre in the
e~panfom, and fet about the middle ofits obfcurity in Britain; it will wear
iD at ~he north pole, and in the year 2600, or thereabouts, go Qff' in the
t~panJum on the fouth fide of the Earth. 1 < ,; •

letus in Afia, where Thales then rclided. That year ooc-refpond& to the
s8sth year before Chrift; when accordingly there happened ayery fignal
eclipfe of the Sun, on the 28th of May, anfwering to the pretent IOth of
that month,• central through North America, 'the fouth parts of France,
Italy, &c. as far as Athens, or the Ifles in the ..tEgean Sea; which is the
fartheft that even the Caroline Tables carry it ; and confequently make
it invifible to any part of Afia, in the total character; though I bave good
reafous to believe that it ¢xtended to Babylon, and vteot down central
over that city. We are not however to imagine, that it was fet before it
patTed Sardis and the Afiatic towns, where the predictor lived; becaufe
an invifible eclipfe could have been of nofervice to demonftrue his ability
in aftronomical fciences to his countrymen, as it could give no proof of
its reality.
For a farther illuftration, Thucydides relates, tbat a fUar eclipfe hap..
pened, on a fummer's day in the afternoon, in the firil year of the Pelo-
ponneftan war, fo great that the ftars appeared. Rhodus was via:or in
the Olympic games the fourtb year of the faid war, being alfo the foorth
of the 87th Olympiad, on the 428th year before Chrid. So that the
eclipfe muft have happened in the 431ft year before Cbrift; and by com-
putation it appears, that on the 3d of Augufi there was a fignal eclipfe
which would have patTed over Athens central about fix in the evening,
but which our prefent Tables bring oo farther than the ancient Syrteson the
African coaft, above 400 miles from Athens; which, fuffering in that cafe
but 9 digits, could by no means exhibit the remarkable dayrknefs recited by
this hifiorian; the centre therefore feems to have paffed Athens about fix itt
the evening, and probably might go down about Jerufalem, or near it, con-
trary to the conll:rua:ion of the prefent Tables. I have only mentioned
thefe things by way of cautiOI& to the aftronomers of the prcfent day in
re-computing ancient eclipfes; and refer them to examine the eclipfe
• The reader may probably find it diflicult to underftand why Mr. Smith.filould reckon this
edipfe to have been in the 4th year of the 48th Olympiad, as it was onJ.y in the end of she third
year; and alfo why the z8th of May, in the sSsth year before Chrift, lhould anfwer to the pre(eat
J1ttb of that month. But we hope the followrng explanation will remove thefe diflicoltirs. The
l')l()fltb fJf May (whtn the Suo was eelip{cd) in the sBsth year before the firft year of Chrift, which
was a leap-year, fell in the latter end of the third year of the .of.Sth Olympaid; and the fourth year
of that Olympiad began at the fummer folftice following; but perhaps Mr. Smi1h begins the
y~a111 of the Olympiad fram January, in order to make thnn correfpond more readily with JuliM
years; and fo reckons the month of May, when the eclipfe happened, to be in the fourth year
of that Olympiad. The place or longitude of the Sun at that time was in :&9 cfeses -+3 minutes

In Aftronony, eclipfes of the Moon are of great ufe for afcertaining
the periods of her motions, efpecially fuch eclipfes~as are obferved to be
alike in all circumftances, and have long intervals of time between them.
In Geography, the longitudes of places are found by eclipfes, as already
1hown; but for this purpofe eclipfes of the Moon are more ufeful than
thofe of th' Sun, becaufe they are more frequently vifible, and the fame
lunar eclipte is of equal largenefs and duration at all places where it is feen.

in every eclipfe with refpea to its quantity, the places where it is vifible
(if of the Suo), and th~ tim~ of the day or night; that it ~s impoffi~le
there can be two folar echpfes m the courfe of many·ages wh1ch are ahke
in all circumftances. ·
Of the FIGURE and MOTION of the EARTH, the CHANGE of
SEASONS, the CAUSE of EARTHQUAKES, &c.
The Earth, among Aftronomets', is confide~ed as one of the primary
planets; and its figu·re was accounted by fome of the ancients to be like
that of an oblong cylinder; by others, of the form of a drum, and by
others to be flat. But the moderns have demonll:rated it to be nearly
fphericaJ, or rather an oblate fperoid, flatted towards the poles.
Before we enter more minutely· into thefe (peculations, it will be pro-..
per to defcribe the various circles of the globe, and to explai11 its feverat
divifions and boundar.ies, as well i~aginary as real, in· order. to give aU
my readers a perfea 1dea of the fubJect before them. For thts· purpofe I
have fubjoined a plal:e of the Armillary Sphere-, which "is an artifiCial con-
trivance, reprefenting the feveral circles proper to the theory of the
mundane world, put together in their natural order, to eafe and affill
the imagination in conceiving the conftitution of the fpheres, and the va-
rious phenomena of the celefl:ial bodies. For this purpofe the E'arth is
placed in the centre, pierced by a line fuppofed· to be its axis, the
upper point of which is fixed in the arClic, or north, pole, aud the lower
extremity in the antar8ic, or-fouth, pole; whence the two fmall circles
defcribed near thefe points are called the araic and antar8ic circles..
The outer circle, in which the axis cw- poles of the world are fixed,
reprefents the meridian, or fuppofed line over any given place, to which
when the Sun'comes, it is then mid-da1, or noon. The broad circle, .
which croffes the whole, and divides the fphere into two equal pa-rts, is
called the horizon; becaufe it divides the heavens and the earth into two
equal parts or hemifpheres,. called the upper and the lower, the one light
and the other dark. It likewife determines the rifing and fetting of the
Sun, ~oon, or fl:ar, in any particular latitude; for, when any of thefe
appear juft at the eaftern part of the hori2jon, we fay, it rifes; and, when
it does fo at the wefiern part, we fay, it fets. .From hence alfo the lati..;
tude of the Sun and fl:ars is reckoned, which is their heigbt·above· the
horizon. The poles of the horizo.11 are the zenith and the nadir, or the
points immediately over our heads and· under our feet, diametrically

Having premifed fo much by way of explaining the fphere, l thall now
proceed with the fubjeet immediately before us.
That the Earth is a fpherical body, may be demonftrated from the
following among other confiderations. I. All the appearances of the
heavens, both at land and at fea, are the fame as\they would be if the Earth
were a globe. 2. In eclipfes of the Moon whtch are caufed by the ilia-
dow of the Earth falling upon the Moon; this thadow is always circular,
and a body can be no other than a globe, which in all fituations cafts a
circular iliadow. 3· Several navigators have failed quite round the globe,
fteering their courfe direClly fouth and weft, till they came to the Ma-
gellanic Sea, and from thence to the north and weft, till they returned
to their port from the eaft; and all the phenomena which thould natu-
rally arife from the Earth's rotundity happened to them. Befides, their
method of failing was .alfo founded upon this hypothefis, which could
never have fucceeded fo happily, if the Earth had been ofany other figure~
It is true, the furface of the Earth is not an exact geometrical globe, but
then the inequalities are fo inconfiderable, that the higheft mountain
bears JlO greater proportion to the bulk of the Earth than a grain of duft
ctoes to a common globe. The figure of the Earth then was reckoned by
mathematicians and geographers as perfeclly fpherical, excepting the fmall
inequalities on its furface of ·mountains and valleys, till an accident en-
gaged the attention of Sir lfaac Newton and Mr. Huygens, who de.-
monftrated, from tbe laws of hydroftatics, and the revolution of the Earth
about its axis, that its figure was not a true fphere, but an oblate fphe:- .
roid flatted towards the poles. Monfieur Richer, when at the· ifland of
Cayenne, about five degrees diftant from the equator, found that his clock,
which at Paris kept true time, now ·loft two minutes and twenty-eight
feconds every day. Now, though heat will lengthen pendulums, and
coofequently retard their motion, it is certain the heats of Cayenne were
JJot fufficient to folve this phznomenon, which cau flow only frem a di-
minution in the preffure of gravity. For, as the Earth revolves about
its axis, all its parts will endeavour to recede from the axis of motion; and
thereby the equatoreal parts where the motion is quickeft will tend Jefs
·towards the centre than the reft; their endeavour to fly off from the axis
about which they revolve taking otf part of their tendency that way;
fo that thofe parts will become li~ter than fuch as are nearer the poles.
The polar parts, therefore, wilfprefs in towards the centre, and· raifc
the equatoreal. parts, till the quantity of matter in the latter is fo far in-
creafed as to compenfate for ita lightnefs, and an equilibrium b~ reftored:
On which account, the form which the Earth atrumes will be that of an

ohlate tphetoid, whofe thorter axis palfes through the poles. By virtue
oaly .of the l"otation of the earth about its axis, the weight of bodies at
the equator is lefs than at the poles, in the proportion of 288 to ~9·
From hence arifes, as before obferved, a fpheroidical form of the Earth,
and from that fpberoidical form arifes another diminution of gravity at
the eq;uator. by which, if the Earth were homogeneous throughout, bo-
dies at the equator would lofe oue pound in 1121; and fo, on both ac-
counts taken together, the gravity of bodies at the poles would be to the
fame at the equator as 230 to 229. From whence, if we fuppofe the
gravity of bodies within the Earth to be direCtly as their difiance from
tpe centre,.thofe numbers will alfo exprefs the relation between its polar
aQd equatoreal diameter. This is upon a fuppofition that the Earth was
at 6rft fluid, or a chaos, having its folid :and fluid parts confufedly mixed
together; but if we fuppofe it at firfi partly fluid and partly dry, as it
ROW is. (fince we find that the land is very nearly of the fame figure witb
the fea, except taifed a little to prevent its being overflowed,) tbe Earth
muft am be of the fame form; for otherwife the major part of the water
would .flow towards the equator, and fpread itfelf like an inund.at~ · ove.: .
~1 dae land in thofe parts. This theory met with great oppofition from
Montieur Caffini, who, having meafured the meridian of France, declared.
(~ith great reafon likewife, if the obfervations had been correct) that the·
!4rtb, infi:ead -of being flattened, was lengthened towards the poles ; that
is. inQead of .being an oblate it was an oblong fpheriod, higher at the.
p~les- by about ninety-five miles.. So wide a difference, between pbilo-
fOpbers of fo high rank, determined at length the king of Fr~nce, at a~
u:pe11fe becoming a monarch, to employ two companies of mathemati-.
ciafts, the one to meafure tbe length of a degree of the meridian at the·
equator, and the otber the length of a degree at the polar circle, that, by.
comparing them together; and with the len.gth of the degree of France, it.
might be known whether tbc Earth were obion~ .or flat towards the poles~..: .
- )
It is certain, if the lengths of the degrees of latitude decreafe as we
so-from tbe equator towacds the poles, tbeo the axis is greater' and the
figure an oblong fpberoid ; but, on th~ ~ontrary, if thefe lengths ipcreafe ·
as you remove towards the poles, the a¥:is is lefs than a diao;1eter at.th~
equator,. and confequently the figure an oblate {pheriocl. This .lafr ap-

In the nrfi: place, the Earth is·found to have a diurnal motion round
its own axis, from well: to eaft, which it performs in twenty-four hours,
and thereby occafions th.e perpetual fucceffion of days and nights. It is
every way agreeable to reafon, that the Earth lhould revolve about its own
axis, t0 account for the appearance of fucb a vaft number of ftars, which
fecm to perform their revolutions round the Earth in twenty-four hours;
for the ·motion of thefe ftars, were it.real, would be incredibly fwift, and
beyond all imagination, becaufe ~heir diftance in refpetl of us is almoft
innuite, and the orbit they have to run round fo prodigioufly great, that~
they mufi: move at leaft IO-:>,ooo miles in a minute.
Tbe Earth has, fecondly, an annual motion round the Sun, which it
performs every year., whereby it produces tbe different feafons, and the
lengthening and thortening of the days. · It being now an eftablithed
doCtrine that the Sun is the centre of our fyftem, and that the Earth
moves round it, we thall avoid entering into any difquifitions upon that
head, fince it is only nec~ffary we .th<>uld explain the phenomena which ,
arife from the Earth's annual motion, in conjunction with the rotatioa
round its axis; having 6rt1 premifed, that the Earth, in its annual mo- ·
tioo, hath its axis always in the fame direction, or parallel to itfelf.
Suppofe Vj y 20 ::e: (in the annexed ngure of the Earth's motion) bo·
the Earth's orbit, and S the Sun. Through the centre of the Sun draw
the right line y S :e: parallel to the common feetion of the equat-or and
the ecliptic, which will meet with the ecliptic in two points y ::e:. And, .
when the Earth feen from the Sun is in either of the points y or :a:. a
right line S y or S ::e:, joining the centre of the Earth and Sun, will coin-
cide with the common ietlion of the equator and ecliptic, and will then .
be ·perpendicular to A B, the axis of the Earth, or of the equator, becaufe .
it is in the plane of the equator. But the fame liae is alfo perpendicular
to the circle which bounds the light and darkuefs, and therefore the axis .
of·the Earth will be in the plane of that ·circle, which will therefore pafs.
through the poles of the Earth, and will cut th~ ~ator and all it$ pa-
rallels into equal parts. When the-Earth, therefore, is in .tpe beginl}ing
of :a:, the Sun will .be feen in y; in the co~moo fettion of the eq.Uat~
and ecliptic, in which pofition, tbe ~rcle of illumination touches both .

Sun; but, in Yj, it makes a right angle. with the l~oe S P, which joins
the centre of the Sun and Earth. And, becaufe the -line S P is not in the
plane of the equator, but in that of the ecliptic, the angle BPS, which
the axis of the Earth BA makes with it, will not now be a right angle,
but an oblique one of 66; degrees, which is the fame with the inclina-
tion of the axis to the plane of the ecliptic. Let the angle S P L be a
right angle, and the circle, bounding light and darknefs, will pafs through
the point L, and then the arch B D, or the angle B P L, will be 2J} de-
grees, that is, equal to the co~plement of the angle B P S to a right angle.
Let the angle B P E be a right angle, and then the line P E will be in the
plane ofthe ~quator. Therefore, becaufe the arches B E and L T are equal,
each of them being quadrants, if the common arch B T he taken away,
there will remain T E equal to L B, equal to 23} degrees. Take EM equal
toE T, and through the points MandT defcribe two parallel circles, T C;
M N; the one reprefents the tropic of Cancer, and the other the tropic of
Capricorn. And, the Earth being in this fituation, the Sun will approach
. the neareft that it can come to the North Pole: he will iliine perpendi-
eularly on the point T, and confequently will be vertical to aU the in-
habitants under the tropic of Cancer, when he comes to their meri-
dians. It is manifeft that the circle which bounds light and darkne{s
reaches beyond the North Pole B to L: but towards the fouth _it falls
thort of the South Pole A, and reaches no further than F. Through
L and F, let two parallels to the equator be defcribed. Thefe will rc·
prefent the polar circles, and, while the Earth is in P, all that tratt of
1t which is included within the polar circle K L continues in the light,
notwithftanding the conftant revolution round the axis. On the contrary,
thofe that lie within the antarCtic circle remain in continual darknefs.
It is alfo manifeft, that all the parallels between the equator and the
arBic circle are cut by the circle bounding light and darknefs into un-
equal portions, the largeft portions of thefe circles remaining in the light,
and the fmalleft in darknefs; but thefe parallels which are towards the
antarCtic circle have their greateft portions in darknefs, and their Jeaft in
light; and the difference of thefe portions will be greater or lefs, accord·
ing as the circles are nearer to the pole or to the equator. Therefore
wllen the Sun is feen in Cancer e, the inhabitants of the northern he-
mifphere will have their days a~ the longeft, and their nights at the
ihorteft, and the feafon of the year will }?e fummer. The contrary of
this will happen to the inhabitants of the foutbern hemifpbere.

diurnal arches begin gradually to deereafe, and the noCturnal to increa{e,

and of confequence the Sun's rays will faU more and more obliquely,
and his,heat proportionably diminilh, till the Earth comes to r, when
the Sun will appear in :::!:::, at which time, the days will again be equal
to the nights to all the inhabitants of the earth, the circle bounding light
and darknefs paffing in this pofition through the poles. This will be the
feafon called autumn. ·
The Earth moving on·through r, tl, and IT, the Sun will be fee·n to
go in the ecliptic through :::!:::, TJt, and 1, and wiJl appear to decline from
the equator towards the fouth;--fo that, when the Earth is realJy in 20,
the Su:n will appear-in Vj. And, whereas the axis A B always retains its
pata1Jelifm, the Earth will have the fatne pofition and afpett in refpett
to the Sun that it had when it was in VJ ; but with this difference, that,
whereas the traCl within the polar circle K L was in continual light while
the Earth was in -VJ, now, the Earth arriving at !5, the fame traa will be
altogether in darknefs; but the oppofite fpace, within the circle FG,
will be in a continual illumination, and at the pole A there wiJl be no
night for the fpace of fix months. Here Iikewife, of the parallels be.
tween the equator and the north pole, the illuminated portions are much
lefs than the portions which remain in darknefs, the contrary of which
happened in the former pofition; fo likewife the Sun at mid-day will .
appear vertical to all the inhabitants that live in the tropic M N ; fo that
it will 'appear to have defcended towards the fouth from the parallel T C
to the parallel MN, through the arch CQN, which is forty-feven de-
grees. This will be the feafon called winter. ·
Lafi.Jy, as the Earth journeys on from 2D through $l and ~ to :::!:::, the
Sun appears to pafs through ::: and *to r, and the northern climes
begin to returu, and receive more diretHy the enlivening beams of the
Sun, whofe meridian height does now each day increafe; the days now
lengthen, and the tedious nights contraa: their refpeB:ive arches; and
every thing confpires to advance the delightful feafon of the fpring, with
the equality of days and nights, as was iliown when the Earth was in :::!:::,
from which point we began to trace its motion.
The third motion of the Earth is that motion by which the ·poles of
the world revolve about the poles of the ecliptic, and occafion what is
commonly called the precelfion of the equinoxes, which is a flow-motion
of the equinoB:ial points towards the weft, that is, in antecedentia, or
contrary to the order of the figns. This retrogade motion, by carrying
the equinoClial points to meet the Sun in his apparent annual motion,
1nakes him arrive at them fooner .every year than be would do if thofe

points continued immoveable; and this arch of regreffion being fifty
feconds a-year, or one degree in feventy-two years, makes the equinoxes
happen twenty minutes in time fooner each year than they would other-
wile do. And, though this change be not fenfible in a few years, yet
thefe points are found to have a very different fituation from what they
had two thoufand years ago.
By reafon of this preceffion of the equinoCtial points, the fixed fiars
feem to move towards the eaft, and thereby to have their longitude,
which is always reckoned upon the ecliptic, from the vernal equinotlial
point, increafed. And hence the Confiellations feem -to have deferted
the places aUotted them by the ancient aftronomers; for infiance, the
beginning of the fign Aries, which in Hipparchus's time was near the
vernal equinoctial point, and gave name to that point of the ecliptic, is
now removed near a whole fign, or thirty degrees, eafiward; fo that
Aries is now where Taurus ufed to be, Taurus where Gemini ufed to be,
&c. and thus all the confiellations of the zodiac have changed their
ancient places. But, to avoid confufion, aftronomers have thought fit
to let the feveral portions of the ecliptic, where thefe conftellations were
at firft obferved to be, retain their old names; fo that the vernal equi-
noClial point is frill reckoned the firfi degree of Aries. However, thefe
portions of the ecliptic, where the conftellations were at 6rft, are called
tmafira, to difiinguiih them from the places where they now are, which
are termed jlellata.
-
The orbit, in which the Earth moves round the Sun, common ex-
perience proves to be elliptical; for, were it circular, the Sun's apparent
diameter would always be the fame; but we find it is not; for, if it be
meafured with a micrometer in winter-time, it will be found confidera-
bly larger than in fummer, and it will be greatefi of all when the Sun
is in the eighth degree of Capricorn, which ihows that is the place of
the aphelium, it being then thirty-two minutes forty-feven fecouds;;
whereas, when the Sun is in the eighth degree of Cancer, his- diameter
is but thirty-one minutes forty fcconds. Hence it is evident, that the
Sun is really nearer to us in the midft of winter than it is in the midft of
lummer: but this feems a paradox to many, who think the Suu muft
needs be hottell: when it is the uearefi to us. and .that the Sun is apparently
more diftant from us in December than in J-une. As to the Sun:ts being
hotter, it is true, it is fo to all thofe places which receive his rays direClly
~r perpendicularly; but we find his heat abated on account of the obli-
ttuity of the rays, ~nd .his fhor~ c?ntinuanc~ above the horizon a~ that
tlme. And, as to htS d1fiance, 1t 1s only w1th refpea to the zemtb of

the place, not the centre of the earth; fince it is plain the Sun may ap-
proach tbe centre of the earth at the fame time that it recedes from the
zenith of any pla~e. And, agreeably to the Sun's nearer difiance in the
winter, we obferve his apparent motion is then quicker than in the fum-
mer; for in the eighth degree of Capricorn it is about fixty-one mmutes
per day, but in the eighth degree of Cancer his motion is but fifty-teven
minutes per day. Accordingly, we find the fummer half-year eight days
longer than the winter half-year, as appears by the following computa-
tion, according to the new ftyle. ·

For, the Sun's attracting force being one part of the caufe of the planet's
motion, and this force always increafin~ and decreafing in_the inverfe
ratio of the fquares of the diftances, 1t is evident the velocity of the
planet will always be greater the nearer it is to the Sun, and vice verfo.
Ju this manuer the Earth's motion round the Sun is inYariably continued,

The Earth, in its natural and original £late, Des Cartes, Burnet, Wood-
ward, and Whifion, fuppofe to have been perfectly round, fmooth, and .
equable; and they account for its prefent rude and irregular form prin-
cipally from the waters of the great deluge, which inundated and over-
flowed the whole furface of the globe, to the height of fifteen cubits
above the higbeft hills; for to that hei~ht Mofes exprefsly faith, Gen. vii_

were any mountains at all before the flood, though Mofes exprefsly men-
tions them as a ftandard for the height of the water. Others have denied
the univerfality of the deluge, though the words of the text be, " That all
the hills over the whole earth were covered.'' Others have had recourfe

to the thifting of the earth's centre of gravity, and therefore will have
all parts drowned fucccffively; and our famous theorift, Dr. Burnet,
fancies an earth made on purpofe to be drowned at that time, which,
being in form of an orbicular cruft on the face of the fea, as we now call
it, (for he fays there was none before the deluge,) fell down into the
water, and fo drowned its inhabitants. This is the moft abfurd theory
of all.
But the Holy Scriptures tell us, that the waters of the deluge came
from two funds," the great deep below,'' and the" rains above.'' Again,
·when we look to the internal parts of the earth, even to the greatefr depth
men have ever reached, we find that the body of the terrefirial globe is
compofed of firata, or layers, lying over one another, which appear to
be fediments of a flood ; befitles, in the bodies of thefe ftrata, though never
fo folid, nay, even inclofed within the folidity of the firmeft flints, mar-
'ble, fione, &c. we find· a prodigious variety of the exuvi~, or remains
·of fillies, fuch as their 0\ells, teeth, &c. as welt marine ones as thofe
which Jive in lakes and rivers; and from a due obfervation of thefe, and
Tepeated confiderations upon them, it was, that the·1earned Dr. Wood-
ward founded what he delivers upon this fubjea, which therefore is not
fo much a theory of the earth, as neceffary deduaions, and unavoidable
confequences, drawn from the matters of fatl, as they are laid down in
. the feooud part of bis Natural Hiftory of U1e Ea..-th. 1. That thefe marine
bodies, and the.other fpoils gf freth-wat-er 61hes, were borne forth-out of the
fea by the univerfal deluge, and, on return of the water back again from ofF
the earth, they were left behind on land. 2. That, during the time of the
·deluge, all the ftone and marble of the antediluvian earth, all the metals
iu it, all the mineral ·concretions, and in a word, all foffils whatever,
that had before attained an} folidity, were totally diffolved; their confii-
tuent.corpuicles disjoined, and their cohefion perfeelJy ceafcd; and that
the faid corpufCles, together with the-corpufcles ofthofe which were not
before folid, fuch as (imd, earth, and the like; as alfo, all animal bodies,
teeth, thells, vegetables, in ihort, all bodic:s whatever they were, either
upon the earth, .or that confiituted the mafs, if uot quite down to the·
abyfs, yet to the greatefi depths we ever dig, were alfumed up promif-
cuoufiy into the water, and fufiained therein; fo that the water and thefe
bodies made up one common mafs. 3· That at length all the mafs that·
was thus borne up in the water was again precipitated, and fubfided to-
ward the bottom, and that this ful>fidence h1ppened gener~Uy according
.to the ·laws of gravity. That the matter, fubfiding thus, foi'IJled the
firata of fione, earth, marble, coal, &c. of which fir.ata the terreftrial

thefe tl:rata were originally parallel, plane, ai1d regular, and confequeatly
rendered the furface of the earth even and fpberical; that they were
eontipus, and not broken and interrupted as we .find them now ; and
that the water lay then upon them, conftituting a fluid fpher.e, envi-
roning all the globe round. 6. That after fome time, by the force of an
agent feated within the earth, thofe firata were broken on all fides of the
sfobe; that they were difiocated, and their fituation varied; from whence
thefe elcYations and depreffions on the furfacc of the globe, as tho moun-
tains. vaJleys, and other inequalities.

From thefe obfervations, he concludes, that Noah's del"~e was quite 1:(; f.'.../~ 1 .- J. i,..
univerfal, covering the whole earth, even the bigheft mountains quite / .
round the globe. That, at the time of the deluge, tiM water of the ocean
was firft brought out on the earth, and immediately fucceeded by that of
the abyC•. Tbat, upon the difruption of the ftrata, or the elevation of
kmle, and the depre4fion of others, towards tbe end of the deluge, this
mafs of water fell back towards the loweR parts of the earth, into lakes
aftd other cavities, into the channel of the ocean, and-through the fiffJlres.
by which this communicates with the ocean, in the abyfs which is filled,
rill it came to an equilibrium with the Ocean. That the deluge com-

Mr. Whifton, on the contrary, in his New Theory of the Earth, fup-

the Julian period, that is, 2349 yean before the ChriR:ian era; that a

All that was found within the fphere of attraction of the globe, muft
have fallen upon the earth, and that in form of rain, fince this tail partly
confifi:ed of aqueous vapours. This tail being " the cataracts of heaven
that w~re opened,'' the rain may be made as plentiful as one pleafes, even
to occafion an univerfal deluge, the waters of which would eafuy cover
the highefi: mountains. However, Mr. Whifi:on does not -attribute the.
whole deluge to thefe waters only; for, agreeably to Scrit>~ure, he affirms
that the earth, upon the approach of the comet, wo~ld no doubt feel the;
force of its attraction ; fo that the fluid, contained in the great abyfs.
woufd be agitated by fo violent a flux and reflux, that the fuperficial cruft
of the earth could not r<!fifi: it, but be broken in feveral pla~es, and the
internal waters diffufed over the furface, " and the fountains of the great
deep broken up." Mr. vVhiO:on, to difpofe of all this water, fuppofes,
that as foon as the earth, in contiuuing its courfe, had got fome way from
the comet, the effeCts of its attraB:ion, the flux and reflux, ceafed in th~
great abyfs, and then the fuperior waters were violently precipitated
through the fame paffages by which they came out; the great abyfs
[wallowed up all the fuperfluous waters, and its cavity was found capable·
enough to receive, not only the waters which it had already contained.
but alfo of thofe which the tail of the comet had left behind it; fincc
during the time of its agitation and the burfi:ing of its crufi:, it had en-
larged the fpace by breaking down, on all hands, the earth that environed
itr It was, in like manner, at this time, that the earth, which till then.
was fpherical, became elliptic, occafioned not only by the effect of the.
centrifugal force caufed by its diurnal revolution, but likewife by the
(ltl:ion of the comet; and that becaufe the earth, in. pafiing through the
tail of the comet,. was fituated in fuch. a manner,. that it prefentcd its.
equatorial parts to tbis body; and becaufe the force of the comet's att&·ac-.
tion, concurring with the centrifllgal force of the earth, took away thofe
p.arts of the equator with fo much the mgre facility, as the crufr was
broken and disjoined in a vall; many places.; and becaufe the aCtion of.

of fulphur that naturally takes fire of itfelf. i , By a fermentation of va-

combuftible matter,. which, being a kind of natural gunpowder, at the
appulfe of the fire goes off with a tudden blaft or violent explofion, rum-
bling in the bowels of the earth, and lifting up the ground above it, fo
as fometimes to make a miferable havock and devafiation , till it gets
vet~t or a difcharge. Burning mountains and volcanoes are only fo many
fpiracles ferving for the difcharge of this fubterranean fire, when it is
thus preternaturally affembled. And where there happens to be (uch
a firucrure and conformation of the interior parts of the earth, that the
fire may pafs freely and without impediment from the caverns therein,
it affembles into thefe fpirals, and then readily and eafily gets out from
time to time without fhaking or difrurbing the earth. But, where a
communication is wanting, or the paffages are not fofficiently large and
open, fo that it cannot come at the faid fpiracles without fidl: forcing and
removing all obflacles, it heaves up and ihocks the earth, till it hath
made ·its way to the mouth of the volcano; where it rulhes forth;
fometimes in mighty·flames, with great velocity, and a·terrible b'ellow•

1s·properly the effeCt- of the te-aaion of the fire, a:nd they lhake the earth
juft as the eleplofion o( a powder-magazine caufes a fe'nfible concufiion at

caufe ~n earthquake over all the ifland of Sicfly; bt1t it never will extend
to the diftance of three or four hundred leagues. In like manner, when
forne new vents of fjre have been formed in Mount Vefuvius, there are
f~lt at the fatne time eartpquakes at Naples, and in the neighbourhood
of the volcano; but thefe concuffions have never 1haken th~ ·Alp-, nor
·hec:h communicated to France, or other countries remote from Vefuvius.
Some.times they are felt at confiderable diftances, and 1hake a long tratt
.of ·g.round without any eruption or volcano appearing• . W e have in-
ftans·es of earthquakes which were felt at the fame time in ·Englan·d,
France, Germany; and even in Hun~ary, and thefe extend always a great
deal more in length than in breadth; they tbake a traa 'Of ground with
more or lefs violence iti different piaces., in proportion as it is remote from

diforders, and at the fame time making the like effort on the earth; which
being e~panded ·upon the face of the abyfs, occafions- the agitation and.
concQillon whic~ we call an earthquake.
But Dr. Stukelev has introduced a new notion in the theory of eartb-
qua,kes., ~ud bas endeavoured to prove that they are caufcd by" eleClricity.
He urges a variety of objections againft the foregoing hypotheiis, which
afcribes earthquakes to fubterraneous wi-nds, fires, vapours, or any thin-
g
that occafioms an explofion, and thus heaves up the ground. He thinks.
~r-e is no evidence of the caveru.ous thucture of the earth, which this
hy.podl¢US requires; but that, on the contrary, there is reafon to believe
tbat it is in a gfeat mea.fure folid. . Earthquakes have alfo frequently
~appened without any eruption of fire, vapouar, fiuoke, or fmell, which
he think~ it utterly incou6llent witb- the fupp.ofition of their being oc-
c.-fiOiled by any fubterraneous ·vapours; efpcciaJly in ~s where tho
1h~k is of confiderable extent; betides, this is. a cwre altogether inade-

nicatc motion of a much·greater velocity than any heaving of the earth
under the fea by the elafiicity of generated vapours, which would only
produce a gradual fwell, and not an impulfe of the water, refembling .a
thump againfi the bottom of a ihip, or firiking againfi a rock. Dr.
Stukeley, finding the common hypothefis infufficient, was led to con-
clude that earthquakes were proper electrical ihocks; and a parricular
furvey of the phenomena, that either precede or attend them, confirmed
this opinion:· he obferved that the weather was ufually dry and warm
for fame time before an earthquake happened, and that the furface of
the.ground is thus previoufiy difpofed for that kind of electrical vibration
in which it confifis; whilfi at the fame time, in fame places where earth-
quakes have happened, the internal parts, at a fmall depth below the fur-
face, are moifi and boggy; and thence he infers, that they reach very
little below the furface. He .adds, .that the fouthern regions are more
fubject to earthquakes than the northern, on account of the greater
warmth and drynefs of the earth and air, which are qualities fo nece.lfary
to eleB:ricity. It was alfo obferved, that, before the earthquakes at Lon-
don in 1749~ all vegetables were remarkably forward; and electricity is
well known to. quicken vegetation. They were likewife preceded by
frequent and fingular appearances of the aurora borealis and aufrralis,
and by a variety of other meteors which indicate an eletl:rical fiate of the
atmofphere. Dr. Stukeley apprehends, that, in this fiate of the earth and
air, nothing more is neceffary" to produce an earthquake than the ap.
proach of a non-eleB:ric cloud to any part of the earth, when in an
highly-eleClrifie.d ftate, and the difcharge of its contents upon it; ·
and
that, as the difcbarge from an excited tube occafions a commotion in the
human body, fO the ihock, produced by the difcharge between the cloud
aad many miles in compafs of folid earth, muft be an earthquake, and
the fnap from the contaCt be the noife attending it. He fuppofes that a
large black cloud, which fuddenly covered the hemifphere a little before
the earthquake of 1749, ·might . have occafioned the ihock, by the dif-.
charge of a ihower. The noife, it has been obferved, ufually precedes
the thock; whereas,. if the concuffion depended upon a fubter-raneous
er:uption, it muft have been quite the contrary. The flames and ful-
phureous fmells which fometimes attend earthquakes are more eafily ac-
counted fOf', as Dr. Stukeley thinks, from the fuppofition of their being
eleClrical phenomena than on any other hypothefis. The fudden extco-
five agitatioA, both of land and water, occafioned by earthquakes,·caa
only be effeCled by eleClricity. The nature ·of the impulfe which they
give to thips, already taken notice of, fuggefts an argument, that they are
owing·uot to any convulfion in the bowels of the earth, but toan uniform
vibration along its furface, occafroned by an eleCl:rical fnap; and that they
ere

are etearical phenomena, Dr. Stukeley farther infers, from their chiefly
affecting the fea-coaft, or places near rivers; we may add alfo, eminences;
and finally from the effeCts which they produce on weak conftitutions, ·
fuch ·as pains in the back, head-achs, cholics, &c. fimilar to tbofe oc-
cafioned fometimes by eleCtrification. After all, he does not. prefume to
fay how the earth and atmofphere are put into that electrical· and vibra-
tory fiate which prepares them to give or receive that fnap, and lhock,
which is called an earthquake; but this he thinks as difficult to account
for as magnetifm, gravitation, mufcular motion, and many o'her fecrets
in nature.
Several circumftances ·have been remarked by other writers, which
confirm the theory that fuppofes earthquakes to be ele8rical phenomena.
Signior Beccaria, wbofe name often occun in the hiftory of electricity,
agrees with Dr. Stukely, in fuppofing, that earthquakes are eleClrical
phenomena; but he imagines that the electric matter which occafions
them is lodged deep in the bowels of the earth; and, if in thi.s fituation
its equilibrium ihould by any means be deftroyed, fo that the beft method
of rell:oring it ihall be by the fluid's burfting its way into the air, and tra-
verfing feveral miles of the atmofphere to come to the place where it is ·
wanted, it may eafily be conceived, that violent concuffions may be g_
iven ·
to tb~ ea~h ~y the ~udden paffage ~f this powerful agent; an~ that.the
elc:Ctnc ftutd 1s fometames colleCted 10 the bowels of the earth, be dunks
probable from the appearance of ignes fattli in mines, which fomQtimes
bar,pens, and is very probably an eleelrical phenomenon. This ingenious
phdofopher obferves, that, if two pieces of glafs, inclofed in a thin piece
of metal, be held in the hand, white a large fhock is fent through them, a
thong concuffion or vibration will be felt, which fometimes breaks them
to pieces. Mr. Henley, another excellent eleCtrician, has difcovered a me..-.
thod ofincreafing the etreCl: of the explofion upon glafs, fo as to afford a ·
very natural idea of an earthquake. Between the ends of two wires, laid
on a piece of glafs, with their extremities pointing to each other, and
· about an incn diftant, through which the difcharge is to be made, be
places a thick piece of ivory upon the glafs, and on the ivory a weight
at pleafure, from one-fourth of an ounce to fix pounds; the glafs is
broken by an explofion i11to in11umerable fragments, and fome of it is
reduced into an impalpable powder; the weight is iliaken by the explofion,
and fometimes thrown off from the ivory. In this experiment, if the
glafs is very thick, fo that the force of the explofion is not fufficient to
break it, it will be found marked with the moft lively prifmatic colours.
The appearance of an earthquake may be alfo reprefented by caufing the
explofton ofa battery to pafs over the tUrfllc:e of any fubftance on which
. fmall

fmall fi:icks or cards are placed, which will never fail to be ihaken, and
often be thrown down, by the explolion; or, by making a difcharge over
the furface of water, in which cafe the report will be much louder than
when the difcharge is made through the air; and a hand plunged deep
into the water will feel the concuilion; and we may add, that the fpark
which paffes over the furface of the water in this experiment bears a
great refemblance of thofe balls of fire that have fometimes been feen over
the furface of the fea or land in the time of an earthquake. Dr. Priefiley
contrived various methods of exhibiting the phenomena of earthquakes.
He made the eleCtric flaih to pafs over wet boards fwimming in water,
over either of thefe feparately, or over both at once, on which pillars,
&c. were ereCted; and thus, while the board reprefented the earth, and
the water the fea, the phenomena of both during an earthquake were
exhibited at the fame time. Dr. Priefiley, the ingenious hifi:orian of
eleet.ricity, after having largely recited the obfervations of Dr. Stukeley
and Signior Beccaria, does not abfolutely decide which of thefe two phi-
lofophers has advanced the more probable opinion concerning the feat
of the electric matter which occafions earthquakes; but he thinks a more
probable general hypothefis than either of them may be formed out of
them both. Suppofe, fays he, the electric matter to be fome way or
other accumulated on one part of the furface of the earth, and, on ac..
count of the drynefs of the feafon, not eafily to diffufe Itfelf; it may:,
as Signor Beccari fuppofes, force itfelf away into the higher regions of
the air, forming clouds in its palfage out of the vapours which float in
the atmofphere, and occafion a fudden fhower, which may farther pro·
mote the paffage of the fluid. The whole furface, thus unloaded, will
receive a concuffion, like any other conducting fubfiance, on parting
with, or receiving, a quantity of the electric fluid; the rulhing noiie
willlikewife fweep over the whole extent of the country; and, upon
this fuppofition alfo, the fll1id, in its difcharge from the country, will
naturally follow the courfe of the rivers, and alfo take the advantage of
any eminences to facilitate its afcent into the higher regions of the air.

. The earthquake which happened in Sicily in the year 1692-J, as re-
lated by Mr. Hartop, F. Burgos, and Vin. Bonajutus, is one of the
mofi: fatal, and exhibits the moft lamentable cataftropbe of the kind
recorded in hitl:ory. It extended over the whole ifland; and even Naples
and Malta were affected by the1hock. It was one of the fecond kind men..:.
tioned by Arifi:otle and Pliny, viz. a perpendicular pulfation or fuccuffion•.
The motion was fo rapid and violent, that nobody could tl:and upon
their legs; thofe who lay on the ground were toiled from fide to fide as.
on a rolling billo.w, and high walls leaped from th~ir foundations many
7ards ditl:ant. The mifchief it did is amazing; almoft all the buildings
m the country ~ere thro.wn down. Fifty-four cities and towns, befides.
· an incredible number of villages, were either detl:royed or greatly da-
mag-edp We fllall only inftance the fate of Catania, one of the moft
·famous, ancient, and ftouri1hing, cities in the kingdom, the refidence of
feveral monarchs, and au univerfity. This once famous, now unhappy,.
Catania, to ufe the words of F. Burgos, had the greateft iliare in the:
tragedy. F. Anton. Serrovita, being on his way thither, and at the dif-
tance of a few miles, obferved a black cloud, like night, hovering over
the city; and there arofe from the mouth of Mont Gibello great fpires of
flame, which fpread all around. The fea,. all of a fudden, began to.
roar, and rife in billows; and there was a noife as if all the artiUery -in
the world had been at once difcharged. The birds flew about afi:oni1hed ~
the cattle in the fields ran crying, &c. His and his companions' bortes.
jlopped 1hort, trembling; fo that they :were forced to alight. They
were no fooner off, but they were lifted from the ground above two palms;
when, cafting their eyes towards Catania, they with amazement faw no-
thing but a thick cloud of duft in the air. This was the fcene of theic
calamjty; for of the magnificent Catania there was·not the leaft foottl:ep
to be teen.. S. Bonajutus alfures us, that, of 18,9I 4 inhabitants, 1 8,00()
.peri1hed thereiu. The fame author, from a. computation of the inhabi-
.tants, before and after the earthquake, in the feveral cities and towns,.
finds that near 6o,ooo periihed out of ~54,900.
Jamaica is remarkable for earthquakes. The inhabitants, Sir Hans .

AN ILLUS.T 'R.ATI·ON
One Hopkins bad his plantation removed half a miie from its .place.
Of all wells, fcom one fathom to fix or feven, the water flew out.a-t the
top with a vehement motion. While ·the ·houfes.on one fide of the fireet
were (wallowed up~ ,on tbe other they. were thrown on heaps; and tho
fand i11 the fireet rofe like waves in the fea, lifting up every body that
ftood on it., and immediately dropping down into pits; and at the fame
infiant a flood of water, breaking in, rolled them over and over; fome
catching hold of beams an·d rafters, &c. Ship-s and fioops in the har-
bour' were overfet and loft; the Swan frigate, particularly, was thrown
over by the motion of the fea and finking of the wharf, and was driven
over the tops of many houfes. The calamity was attended with a hollow
rumbling noife like thunder. In letS than a minute, three quarters of the ,
houfes ·and the ground they fi:ood on, with the inhabitants, were all .
funk quite under water; and the little part' ·left behind was no better
than a heap of rubbilh. The lhake ·was fo violent, that it threw people
on their knees or their faces as they were running about for lhelter.
The ground heaved and fwelled like a rolling fea-; and feveral houfes, fiill
ftanding, were lhuffied and m0ved forne yards O\Jt of .t heir places. A
whole _
ftreet is faid to be twice as bro~d now .as before; and, in many
places, the earth would crack, and open and lhut quick and faft; of
which openings, two or three hundred might be feen at a time; in fome
whereof, the people were [wallowed up; others, the earth cloliog, were
caught by the middle, an·d preffed to death; as to others, the heads only
appeared. The larger openings (wallowed up houfes; and out of fpJnc
would ilfoe floods of water, fpouting up a great height into the air, and
threatening a deluge to that part the 'earthquake fpared. The whole
Was attended with fienches and offenlive f~ells, the noife of .falling
mountains at a difiance, &c. and the fky in a min,ute's time was turned
duU and.redditb like a glo\IVing oven, I Yet; as great a futferer as- Port
Royal was, more houfes were left fiandillg therein thar'l oa the wholQ
iOand befide. Scarcely a planting-houfe or fugar-work was left ftaoding
in all Jarnaica. A great part of them w~rc fwallowed up, houfes, peo-
ple, trees, and all at once; in lieu of which, afterwards appeared great
pools of water:, which, when d,ied up, left nothing but fand, without
any mark that ever tree or plant had been thet~on. About twelve mtl~a
from the fea the earth gaped, and fpouted out with a pr<?digious force
vafi: qllantities of water into the air. Yet the greatefi: violence( w~s

this deferves a more particular account than many others o much leu

The three preceding years had been remarkably dry; .infomuch that
fome fprings of water were totally loft; and the_ predominant winds were

rainy and wet; the weather on the day preceding the -earthquake, which
bappaned on the 1ft ofNovember,.was clear" and. uncommonly warm for
the feafon, and had continued clear and rather warmer than ufual for fe·
vcral days before. The day of the earthquake broke with a fe.renc fky,

and crofi"es, were thrown down, and fome buildings opened at top ; and:
the fwelling in the river was fo confiderable,.that two large fbips,. whica

-was before covered with water became dry land. Whole flocks of theep
and nerds of cattle were fwallowed up as they were grazing; the earth
opened and flmt, exhibiting chafms of the moll: horrible depth, vomiting
forth fulphureous flame and vapour. Upwards of twenty-fix thoufand
fouls were either precipitated into the bowels of the earth, or mangled by
the fall of buildings, and buried in the ruins! By this no lefs fatal than
recent example of the phenomena of earthquakes, i't Chould feem that
the. caufe or feat of them lies far below the furface of the earth, and even
beneath the depths of the ocean.
Of the T I D E S.
The Tides are two periodical motions of the waters of the fea, called
alfo the flux and reflux, or the .ebb and flow. When the Moon is in
the firft and third quarter, i.e. when file is new and full, the tides are
high and twift, and are called Jpring-tides; when file is in the fecond and
laft quarter, the tides are lower and flower, and are called tJeap-tidts.
In the phenomena of the tides, the fea is obferved to flow, for certain
hourS', from fouth towards north; in which motion, or flux, which Jafts
about fix hours, the fea gradually fwells; fo that, entering the mouths
of rivers, it drives back the river-waters toward their heads, or fprings.
After a continual flux of fix hours, the fea feems to refi for about a
quarter of an hour; after which it begins to ebb~ or retire ba~k ·again,
from north to fouth, for fix hours more; in which time, the water
finking, the rivers refume their natural courfe. Then, after a feeming
paufe of a quarter of an hour, the fea again begins to flow. as before;
and thus alternately. Thus does the fea ebb twice a-day, and flow as
often ; but not in the fame hours thereof. The period of a flux and
reflux is twelve hours forty-eight minutes; fo that the tides return later

.•.J /'- 1 o,_t
palfes the two meridians of the world, namely, that above and that " {
.below the horizon ; and ebbs as often as the paffes the horizon, both
-the eaftern and wefieru points thereof. This farther agreement we
.likewife obferve between the Moon and the fea, that . th~ ti~es, though
conA:ant, are not equal; but are greateft when the Mooq ss m conjunc-
tion or oppofit ion, and leafr when in quartile thereto. But thofe tides
are the greateft which happen in· the new and full Moon, at tb~ time

of the equinoxes. And thefe fame effeCts arc obfervecl tbroasboot maS:
of the ~oafis of Europe ; only that the tides aR: fo much tbe le&, and hap-
pen later, as the ·coafts are the more northerly•
. ;
Thcfe phenomena of the tides are admirably accounted for from the
principles of/ravitation. All that.is requifite to their folu~ion is, that
the Earth an Moon, and every parttcJc thereof, mutually gravitate towards ·
each other; the reafonablenefs of which affumption is every way apparent.
Indeed, the fagacious Kepler, Jogg ago, conjeCtured this to be the caufe of
the tides. " If (fays he) the Earth ceafes to attraa its waters towards
itfelf, all the water in the ocean would rife and flow into the Moon : the
fphere of the Moon's attra8ion extends to our Earth, and draws up the
water.'' Thus thought Kepler, in his Introd. ad. Theor. Mart. This
J ...:~furmife, for it was then no more, is now abundantly verified in the theory
"\,<.~firft amply deduced by Dr. Halley from the Newtonian principles. How-
l'\' .'ever, we may obferve, with M. de la Lande, (Aftronomie, vol. iv. Paris,.
. \' 'r7fk .) that feveral of the ancients, and, among others, Pliny, Ptolemy,
and· Macrobius, were acquainted with the influence of the Sun and Moon
upon the tides. And Pliny fays exprefsly, that the caufe of the ebb and
fiow is in the Sun, which attra8a the waters of the ocean ; and adds, that
tbe waters rife in proportion to the prmtimity of ·the Mooo .to the
E•th.. .
To ilhdhate the foregoing obfervations, let N E S Q, in the SGnexed
Plate, fig. 1. reprefent the Earth, covered with water A B D F; N S the
axis of the Earth, E Q. the equator, T R the tropic of Cancer., 1r dae
tropic of Capricorn, M the Moon in her orbit, S the Sua ia his. Now,
fmce all bodies are endued with an attra8ing virtue, the Moon will attra&
all the ·water in the neareft hemifphere F A B, with degrees of force which
.are inverfely as the fquares of the diftances from all parts; and therefore
with the ftrongeft force where the diftance is leaft, viz. in the point A,
di«aly under ber : and, this attraaion being in this hemifphere coutrary
tv :that of the Earth, .tle water in all parts from B to F, towards A, will
have its gravity decreafing, ai1d be bigheft of all at the part A ; and -coo-
fequently muft there fiand higher than at the point F, where, being more
attracted by the Earth, it muft be heavier and nearer to the centre, as is
evident from the laws of hydroftatics. Again, in the hemifphere F DB~,
the attraction of the Moon confpires with that of the Earth; but, :de-
creafing as the fquares of the diftances increafe, the joint force of at~
tion will every-where decreafe from F and B towards D, the poiat
~ofite to the Moon ; where again the waters will be lighteft, and there-
.fore ftand higheft to preferve the equilibrium. Whence it appean, that

-attraCled, fo they will be hea-viefr, and -conkquently rife to the leaft
heigbt from the Earth's fu1'face, whence they are called tides of ebb,
or the ebbing of the water. If to -the power of the Moon we add that
of the Sun, we 'ihaH have the tides cottfiderably.a.ugmontcd at the coo-
junCtion in S,·or oppofition i-n H, that is, at the new and foil Mooos,
which are called the fpring-tides: as tbo1e which happen when the Sun
is at 0 or P are called neap-tides, the waters at A and D being then
Ioweft, becaufe the attraClion of the Moon is then .counterbalanced .by
that of the Sun. It is farther to be obferved, that of the two tides of
flood, at A and D, that at A is greatefl: to any place T in the northern
latitude, when the Moon is in the northern figns, and above tbe horizon;
for the point A is then nearer the zenith af the place G than the .oppo-
·fite point D is to the fame place at R twelve bours afterwards ; and con-
fequently, the height of the tide T G is greater than that of tbe oppofite
tide R g. The contrary ofthis happens when the Moo11 is in the fouthem
figns. · · · · ·
That there are ·two :tides of flood, attd two of ebb, focceeding .eadl ·

and B ; and the elevation A L or B I is double the depreffion C M or
D K. That, if S be the Sun, then A P-0 K=A LxK D=25. inches;
or ut feet, if S be the Moon. That at the points E, F, G, H, (which
are caUed the ollans,) the wat~r is neither elevated nor depreffed. ·That /
jf any other body be placed at 0, as the Moon, in the fame right line
. T S; then, by the joint influence of bo~h S and 0, the e)eyation at A and
B wiJl be increafed, and the depreffion at C ~nd D likewife. Laftly, if
S be in the fituation S, or vertical to the point D, it i~ plain its aClioo to
raife the water D will be direCtly contrary to that of the Moon in depre1f-
ing it there; wherefore the depreffion will not be fogreat as before ;f9r
the fame reafon the elevation at A and B will be diminithed, being now
only as the difference of the two forces, whereas before. they 'Yere as
the fum.
. We.1ha1l now confider the phenomena of the tides wh~ch remain. And
6r~, it is evident, that if P N be the axis of the Earth, and Q 0 the
·diameter . of the equator, then the Moon fituated at 0,. over one of
the poles, would accumulate the water over each pole, and the fpheroid
would be fo .pofited.as to have its longefl: axis A B coinciding with the
axis of the earth P N. In this pofition of the fpheroid, it is pJaii1, there
could be no fuch thing as a tide in any part ofthe ocean over all the earth;
for every feClion of the fphcroid, parallel to the equator, would be a circle;
confequentJy, in any parallel of latitude, the water would be at an equal
diftaoce from the:Earth's furface every moment of the diurnal revolution,
·or natural .day. · Supp~e. th~, Moon were removed from the direCtion of
the: Earth's :axis, .and po(tted ,at S, fig. 3· ~hen will the axis of the
aqueous fpheroid· AB be turn,ec:l tQw~rds S, and make an angle with the
Earth's axis, as AT P or·BT N. Then we obferve, that tincc C, D, are
the places. of loweft wat~r, that parallel I K. whi~h. pa1fes through the
point I an one fide of the ~quator, and LM which pa1fes through M on the
other, will divide the Earth into three zones, into two of which, vi~. E N K
and L PM, there will be but one tide.each day, of the fame kind; for
infiance, in the parallel E F, a pcrfon at F will have high water, ami at
E low water, for twelve hours after. Again, in all the zone I K M L
there will be two tides ofthe fame kind eaCh day, as is evident from the
figure. Thefe limits, or the arch Q I or 0 M, is the complement of
the Moon's declinatic>n fro1n the equator. If the Moon· at S. fig. 4· be
over the equator, the longer axis of the fpheroid AB will now coinCide
with the plane of the equator Q 0, and the 1horter axis C D with the
axis of the Earth N P·
. Here it is obvious, that, in this fituation of the
fpheroid, the waters in the parts A B, with refpeCl to thofe at C 0, will
give .the greatefi difference of high ;ltld low water poffible to all parts ~f

For a very flow and imperceptible motion of tbe \Vho~ bady of ~ter,

Normandy, where the tide runs like a fiuice; and would be yet more
between Dover and Calais, if the tide com-ing round the ifland ·did
not check it. This force, being once impreifed upon the water, con-
tinues to carry it above the level of the ordinary height in the ocean,
particularly where the water meets a direct obftacle, as it does in St.
Maloes; and where it enters into a long channel, which running far into
the land, grows very ftrait at its extremity, as it does into the Severn Sea:
at C~epfiow and Brifiol. This thoalnefs of the fea, and the intercur-
rent continents, are the reafons that in the open ocean the tides rife but
to very fmall heights in proportion to what they do in wide-mouthed
rivers, opening in the direCtion of the ftream of the tide, as it is obferved
upon all the wefiern coafis of Europe and Africa, from Ireland to the
Cape of Good H0pe; in all which a fouth-wefi Moon makes high water;
and the fame is reported to hold in the weft of America. So that tides
happen to different places at all diftances of the Moon from the meridian,
and confequently at aJl hours of the lunar day. .
It is to be confidered that, in order to allow the tides their full motion,
the ocean, in which they are produced, ought to be extended from eaft
to weft ninety degrees at leaft ; becaufe the places, where the Moon
raifes mofi and mofi depreifes the water, are at that diftance from each
other. Hence it appears, that it is only in the great oceans that fucb.
tides can be produced, and why in the larger Pacific Ocean they exceed
thofe in the Atlantic Ocean. Hence alfo it is obvious, why the tides are
uot fo great in the torrid zone, betweeti Africa aod America, where the
ocean is narrower, as in the temperate zo·nes on either fide; and we may
hence alfo underftand, why the tides are fo fmall in iflands that are very
far diftaut from the thores. It is manifeft that, in the Atlantic Ocean,
the water cannot rife on one thore but by defcending on the other; fo
that, at the intermediate diftant iflands, it muft continue at a mean
height betwixt its elevation ou one and on the other 1bore. But, when
tides pafs over ihoals, aud through fireights, into bays of the fea, their
motion becomes more various and complicated, and their height depends
on many circumftances.
The tide that is produced on the wetl:ern coafts of &rope, in the At-
lantic, correfponds to the fituation of the Moon already defcribed. Thus
it is high-water on the coafts of Spain, Portugal, and the weft of Ireland,
about the third hour after the Moon has paifed the meridian; and thence
it flows into the adjacent channels, as it finds the eafieft paifage. One
current from it, for example, runs up by the fouth of England, another
comes in by the north of Scotland ; they take a confiderable time to
move

going on to others that are farther in their courfe. As they return, they
are not able to raife the tide, becaufe the water runs faller off than it
returns, till, by a new tide propagated from the open ocean, the return
of the current is ftopped, and the water begins to rife again. The tide.
propagated by the MooLl in the German Ocean, when 1he is three hours
paft the meridian, takes twelv~ hours to co.me from thence to London-
bridge; fo that, when it is high-water there, a new tide is already come.
to its height in the ocean ; and, in fome intermediate place, it mull: be
low-water at the fame time. Confequently, when the Moon has north
declination, and we 1hould expeCt the tide at London to be the greateft
when the Moon is above the horizon, we find it is leafi; and the con-
trary when Che has fouth declination. At feveral places it is high-water
three hours before the Moon comes to the meridian; .but that tide which
the Moon pu1hes, as it were, before her, is only the tide oppofire to that
which was raifed by her when 1he was nine hours pafi the meridian~
· It would be endlefs to recount all particular folutions which are eafy
corollaries from this doCtrine; as, why the lakes and feas, fuch as the
Cafpian Sea and the Mediterranean, the Black Sea and the Baltic, have
no fenftble tides: for lakes are generally fo tinall, that when the Moon
is vertical the attraCls every part of them alike, and therefore no part of
the water can be raifed higher than the other; and, having no communi-
cation with the Ocean, it can neither increafe nor dimini!h their water in
order to rife or fall ; and feas that communicate by fuch narrow inlets,
and are of fo immenfe an extent, cannot, in a few hours time, receive
and empty water enough to raife or fink their furface any thing fenfibly.
To demonftrate the truth of this doCtrine, the example of the ti.des in
the port of Cat1ha, ·in the kingdom of Tonquin in the Eafr-lndies, in 20
degrees 50 minutes north latitude, which are fo extraordinary and diffe-
rent from all others we have yet heard of, may fuffice. The day iu
which the Moon paffes the equiuoClial, the water fiagnates there without f
any motion: as the Moon removes from the equinotlial, the water
begins to rife and fall once a-day; and it is high-water at the fetting of
the Moon, and low-water at her riung. This daily tide increafes for
about feven or eight days, and then decreafes for as many days by the
fame degrees, till this motion ceafes, when the Moou has returned to
the equinoClial. When 1he has paffed the equinoctial, and de~lioes
toward the fouth pole, the water rifes and falls again as before ; but it ~·
bigh-water now at the riftng, and low-water at the fetting, of the Moon.

the equator with Cattha, it has been filown that the diurnal tide muft:
exceed the noCturnal, fo that two greater and two lefs tides muft arrive·
at Cat1ha by turns. The difference of thefe will produce an agitation of
the water, which will rife to its greateft height at the mean time betwixt
the two greateft tides, and fall loweft at a mean time betwixt the two
leaft tides; fo that it will be high-water about the 6xth hour at the fet.-
ting of the Moon, and low-water at her rifing. When the Moou.bas got
to the other fide of the equinoCtial, the noCturnal tide will exceed- tbe
diurnal; and, therefore, the high-w~ter will bt: at the rifing, and low..
water at the fetting, of the Moon. The fame pr.inciples will ierve to
account for other extraordinary tides, which, we are told, are o1tfei"YY6

the ~1oonfoutbs, or comes to the meridian of the'fame places, every tirft
and fixteenth day, i. e. at every firft and third qttarter, when fhe is new
and full, and confequently the tides muft return at the fame intervals of
. time; therefore, to know the time of high-water on any ~iven day, find
the time of the ?vioon!s fouthing, and then add the ti~e which the 1t'Ioon
has paifed the meridian at the full and change days, to make high-water
at that place; and the fum will be the time·of high-water on the given
day. F~r example, at what time was it high-water at Portfmoutb,
on the 21ft of Od.ober, 178{)? Moon fouths at 2h. agm. to which add
3 ; and the fum sh. agm. fhows that it was high-wa_ter ·at thirty-nine
minutes paft five o'clock in the afternoon.. And fo for any other place .in
the Table. •
This theory of tides has·been extended fo far, as to eftimate the tides,·
or elevation of the waters of the Moon, produced by the attrad.ion of
the Earth; thus, let us fuppofe the quantity of matter ( Q) in the Earth
to be to that in the Moori. (9) as forty to one/ that is, Q..=. 'l : : 40 : 1 ;
and let·us fidi: fuppofe the Earth and :Moon of equal bulk, and reprefented
by A I K, jig. 0. and B D E, and the force (F) of the Earth, at the fur-
face of the Moon B, will be to the force (f) of the Moon at the fur-
, face of the Earth A, direCtly as the rnaffes of matter in each (l>ecaufe of
the equal diftances T B and LA); that is, F : f:: Q...: 'l:: 40: 1.
Again, let L B be to L Cas the diameter of the .Earth to that of the
1tioon, which is as 365 to IOO, then will the force at B be to the force at C
as L l3 to L C, which let be as F tof, then F :f:: 365 : 100, whence
F=;~!'; and above we have F=40f, therefore 4000£: 36sf; and fo-
f :f:: 365 : 4000:: 1 : 1 I nearly; that is, the power of the Earth·to
raife the water at the Moon C is to that of the Moon at the. Earth A as-
eleven to one, very nearl.v. If the Moon can raife the water here 1o
· feet, the Earth can raife the water there to the height of 1 I o feet ; but,.
becaufe the Moon always turns about her axis in the fame time as 1he
revolves about the Earth, the waters (if any there be) will be raifed on
this and the oppofite fide, and always continue over the fame part of the·
Moon"~ furface, fo that there can be no different heights of water there~
.and confequently no tides, except what fmall ones may happen on account
of' the Sun's attrad:ion, and her various inequalities of motion, and d.it:
tance from the Earth.

Of the · W I N D S..
· The Wind, wntu.r, is a fentible agitation of the air, whereby a large
quantity thereof flows in a current or fiream out of one place, or region,
into another. The winds are divided into perenni,zl; flared, and variable.
They are alfo divided 'into general and particular. \Vinds perenniai, or
conjl:znt, are fuch as always blow the fame way: of thefe we have a
very notable one between the two tropics; blowing conftantly from eafi to-
. weft, ·called the generaltrade-u·ind. Windsjlated,. or periodical, are fucb
as conftantly return at certain times : fuch are the fea and land breezes,
blowing from fea to land in the evening, and from land to fea in the
morning; . fuch alfo are the Jhifting or particular trade-tz£•ind.r, which,
for .certain months of the year blow one way, and the reft of the year
the contrary way. Winds variable, or trratic, are fuch as blow now this
now that way; and are now up, now huihed, without any rule or regu-
larity either as to time or place: fuch are all the winds obferved in the
inland parts of England, &c. though feveral of thefe claim their certain
titpes of the day; thus, the weft wind is moft frequent ~bout noon;
the fouth wind in the night; the north in the morning, &c. \Vind gt-
neral, is fuch aone, as at the fame time blows the fa~e way, ov.er a very
large tract of ground, aimoft all the year: fuch only 15 the general trade-
wind. But even this has its interruption; for at land it is fcarcely fenfible
at all, as being broken by the interpofition of mountains, valleys, &c.
at fea, near the fuore, it is difturbed by vapours, exhalations, and parti-
cular' winds blowing from landward; fo that it is chiefly confidered as
general only at mid-fea; and even there it is liable to be difturbed
by· clouds driving from other quarters. Winds panicu!ar, include all
others, excepting the general trade..winds. Thofe peculiar to one little
.canton, or part, are called topical or provincial winds: fuch is the north.
wind on the weftern fide of the Alps, which does not blow above orie
or two leagues lengthwife~ and much leiS in breadth: fuch alfo is the
pontias in France, &c.
Some 'philofophers, as Des Cartes,. Rohault, &c. account for the.·
general wjnd from the diurnal rotation C?f the earth; and from this ge-
neral wind derive -all the particular ones. The atmofphere, fay they~.
invefting ~he earth, and moving round it, that part will perform its cir-
cuit fooneft which has the fmalleft circle to defcribe; the air, therefore,.
near the equator, will require a fomewhat longer time to perform its courfe· .
in, from weft to eaft, than that nearer the poles. Thus, as the earth
turns eaftward, the particles of the air near the equinoctial., being ex-

.ceedingly light; are left behind; fo ,that, in refpeCl: of the Earth's furface,
-they move eaftward, ami become a conitant eafterly wind. This opi-
nioil feems confirmed by this, that thefe winds are found only between
the tropics, i.n thofe parallels .of latitude where the diurnal motion is
1\viftctt. But the confiant calms in the Atlantic fca near the equator,
the wetler1y winds near the coaft of Guinea~ and the periodical wefterly
moni?ons under the eq.uatw in tl!e In~ian feas, declare the infufficiency
of tlus.l~'pothefis. Bchde&fthe a1r, bemg kept clofe to the ~arth by the
principle of gravity, would, in time, acquire the fame degree of velocity
.that the earth's furface moves with, as well in rdi)e8: of the diurnal
rotation as .of the annual about the Sun, which is about thirty times
.fwift€r. Dr. Halley, therefore fubilitutes another cauie, capable of
producing a like confiant efle~, not liable to the fame obJectio~s, but
agreeable to the known properties of the elements of water and air, and
the laws of the motion of fluid bodies. Such a one is .the action of the
Sun's beams upon ~he air and water, as he pafies every day over the ocean,
,confidered together with the quality of the foil and the fituation of the
~djoining continents. ·
Accor.diog to the laws of ftatid, the air which is lefs rarefied, or ex.:.
,panded by heat, and contequently is more ponderous, muil have a motion
towards thofe parts thereof which.arc more rarefied, and lefs ponderous,
to bring it to an equilibrium; alfo, the pre(euce of the Sun continually
fhit-ting to the wetlward, that part to which the air tends, by reafon of
the rarefaCtion made by his greateil meridian heat, is, with him, carried
wetlward; and, confequently, the tendency of the whole body of the
]owet· air is that way. Thus a g~neral eafi:erly wiod is formed, which, ·
being impreffed on the air of a vati: ocean, the parts impel ot;te the other,
and io keep moving till the next return of the Sun, whereby fo much of
the motion as was loft is again reftored ; and thus the ealterly wind is
made perpetual. From the fame principle it follows, that this eatierJy
wind iliould, on the north fide of the equator; be to the northward of the
eaft, and in fouth latitudes to the iouthward thereof; for ne~r the line
the air is much more rarefied than at a greatec diftance fro1p it, becaufe
the Sun is twice in a year vertical there, and at no time difi:ant above
twenty-three degrees and a half; at which diftance the heat, being as
the fine of the angle of incidence, is but little ihort of that of' the per-
pendicular ray; whereas, under the tropics, t~ough the Sun fiays longer

Thit motit>~ coQlpoun~ed with the .former eafterly w!nd, accounts .
for ·all the. phenome~a of the general trade-winds, which, 1f the whole
furfa~e of the globe were fea, would uudoubtedly blow qui~e round the
, world, as they are found to· do in the Atlantic and Ethiopic oceans.
But !eeirag that fo great continctnts Jo interpofe, and break the continuity
of the ocean, regard mufi: be bad to the nature of the foil, and the pofi-
tion of the high mountains, which are the t\W) principal caufes of the
variations of ~he wind from the former gen~al rule; for, if a country
lying near the Sun prove to be flat, fandy, and low land, fuch as the
deferts of Lybia are ufually reported to be, the heat occafioned by the
_reflexion of the Sun's beams. atld the retention. thereof in the fand, is
Incredible to thofe who have not felt it ; whereby the air being extre~ely
rarefied, it is lieceffary that the cooler and more denfe air thould run
thitherwards to reftore the equilibriYm. This is. fuppofed to be the caufe
why near the coaft of Guinea the wind always fets in upon the land,.
blowing wefierly inftead of eafrerly; there being fufficient r~afon to be-
lieve that the inland part.q of Africa are prodigioufly hot, Iince thcr
northern borders thereof were fo very intemperate, as to give the ancients
caufe to conclude, that all beyoncl the tropics was uninhabitable by ex-
ce!S of heat.
Mr. Clare, in his Motion of Fluids, p. JOl. mentions a familiar ·ex-
periment, that fervcs to illuftrate this- matter, as well as the alternate
cour!e of 'land and fea breezes. Fill a large dith with cold water, and
iu the middle of it place a wa~er-plat.e tilled with.warm water : the firft
will reprefent tbe ocean, the other an ifiand, rarefying the air above it.
Then, holding a wax•candle over the cold water, blow it out, and the
fmok.e will b~ feen, in a frill place, to move toward the warm plate, and,
rifing <Wer, it win point tbe courfe of the air1 and alfo of vapour, from
fea to land. And, if the water in the dith be warmed, and the plate filled
with cold water.1 and the fmokilig .wick Qfa candle be held over the plate,
the contrary will happen.
From the fame caufe it happeos, that t~ere are fucb cgnftant calms in
that part of the ocean called .the.RaiiU ; for this tract being placed in
the middle•.between tbe wefierly winds blo~ing on the coaft of G,uinea,
and the eafterly trade-winds blowing to the wefiward thereof, the ten-
dency of the air here is indifferent to either, and fo fiands in equilibria
betweem botb ;· and the weight of tho incumbent atmofphere being
diminithed by the continual contrary wiuds blowing from hence, is the
reafon that the air here hokls not the copious vapour it receives, but lets
it fall in fuchfrequcnt rains. .Bat, as tbc cold and denie air, gy reafon

of its greater gravity, preffes upon the hot and rarefied, it is demonftrable,
that this latter muft afcend in acontinued ftream, as faft as it rarefies; and
that, being afcended, it mull: difperfe itfelf, to preferve the equilibnum;
that is, by a contrary current, the upper air mull: move from thofe parts
where the greateft heat is; fo, by a kind of ci~culation, the north-eaft
trade-wind below will be attended with a fouth-wefterly wind above; and
the fouth-eaft, with a north-weft wind above.
That this is more than a bare conjeCture, the almoft infiantaneous
chauge of the wind to the oppofite poiut, which is frequently found in
paffing the limits of the trade-winds, feems fl:rongly to affure us; but
that which above all confirms this hypothefis, is the phenomenon of the
monfoons, by this means moft eafily folved, and without it hardly expli.-
cable. Suppofing, therefore, fuch a circulation as above, it is to be con-
fidered that to the northward of the Indian ocean there is every-where
land, within the ufual limits of the latitude of JOo; viz. Arabia, Perfia,
India, &c. which, for the fame rea{on as the mediterranean parts of
Africa, are fubjeCt to infufferable heats when the Sun is to the north,
paffing nearly vertical ; but yet are temperate enough when the Sun is
removed towards the other tropic, becaufe of a ridge of mountains at fome
difiance within the land, faid to be frequently, in winter, covered with
fnow, over which the air, as it paffes, mull: needs be much chilled.
Hence it happens, that the air coming, according to the general rule,
out of the north-eaft, to the Indian Sea, is fometimes hotter, fometimes
colder, than that which, by this circulatior), is returned out of the fouth--
weft; and, by confequence, fometimes the under current, or wind; is
from the north-eaft, fometimes from the fouth-weft. That this has no
other caufe, is clear from the times wherein thefe winds fet, viz. in
April: when the Sun begins to warm thefe countries to the north, the
fouth-weft monfoons begin, and blow, .during the heats, till OCtober,
when, the Sun being retired, and all things growing cooler northward,
and the heat increafing to the fouth, the north-eaft winds enter, and
blow all the winter, till April again. And it is, undoubtedly, from the
fame principle, that to the fouthward of the equator, in part of the Indian
ocean, the north-weft winds fucceed the fouth-eafl:, when the Sun draws
near the tropic of Capricorn. Phil. Tranf. No. I 83. or Abridg. vol. ii.

Some philofophers, dilfatisfied wit~ · Dr. Halley's theory above recited,
or not thinking it fufficient for explaining the various phenomena of the

.and its atmofphere towards the Sun and Moon. They aKege that, though

we cannot difcover aerial tides, of ebb or flow; · by means of the baro-
meter, (becaufe columns of air of unequal height, but different denfity,
may have the fame preffure or weight;) yet the protuberance in the at-
mofphere, which is continually following the Moon, mull:, they fay, of
courfe produce a motion in aU parts, and fo bring a wind more or lefs
to every place, which, confpiring with, or counteraCted by, the winds
arifing from other caufes, makes them greater or lefs. Several differta-
tions to this purpofe were publiihed, on occafion of the fubjeel propofed
by the Academy of Sciences at Berlin for the year 1746. M. MuC..
• chenbroek, however, will not allow that the attraCtion of the Moon is
the caufe of the general wind ; becaufe the eafi wind does not follow the
motion of the Moon ~bout the · Earth ; for in that cafe there would be
more than twenty-four changes to which it would be fubje8 in the
courfe of a year, infiead of two. Mr. Henry Eeles, apprehending that
the Sun's .rarefying of the air cannot fimply be the caufe of all the regular
and irregular motions which we fiud iu the atmofphere, afcribes them to
another caufe, viz. the afcent and defcent of vapour and exhalation, at-
tended by the eleCtrical lire or fiuid.; and on this principle he has endea-
voured to explain at large the general phenomena of the weather and of
the barometer.
The induftry of the above-mentioned, and that of fome later writers,
have brought the theory of the produCtion and motion of winds to fome~ ·
· what of a mathematical demonll:ration, which is thus defined: If the
fpring of the air be weakened in any place more than in the adjoining
places, a wind will blow through the place where the diminution is.
For, fince the air endeavours, by its elafiic force, to expand itfelf every
way; if that force be lefs in one place than in another, the etfort o~ the
more againfi the letS elafiic will be greater than the effort of the latter -
againft the former. The lefs elafiic air, therefore, will refill: with leiS
force than it is urged by the more elafiic; confequently, the lefs elafiic
will be driven out ef its place, aud the more elall:ic will fucc.eed. If, now,
the excefs of the fpring of the more elafiic above that of the lefs elafiic
air, be fuch as to occalion a little alteration in the barofcope; the motion
both of the air expelled, and that which {ucceeds it, will bc:come fenfible,
i.e. there will be a wind. Hence, fince the fpring of the air increafes as
the compreffing weight increafes, and comprelfed air is denfer than air
Jefs comprelfcd; all wit:ds blow into rarer air, out of a place filled with a
denfer. Wherefore. fince a denfer air is fpecifically heavier than a rarer,.
an extraordinary lightuefs of the air in any place mull: be attended with
extraordinary winds, or fiorms.

Now, ·an extw.ordinhrf· fall of the mer.cury in:the ·barometer fhowia~
an extraordinary lightnefs of the·atm.ofpbere, it is no .wonder if.that fore...
tels fi:orms. For;;if the air be fuddenly condenfed in any place, its fp~
will be fuddenly dimioifhed; hence, if this diminution be great enou!h
to affeet the barometer, there will a wind blow through the coodeoW
air. But, fince the air cantlot be fuddenly condenfed unlefs it have
before been much rarefied,- there will a wind blow through the air; as it
cools, after having been violently heated. In like manner, if air be
fuddenly rarefied, its fpring is fudd~nly increafed: wherefore, it will flow
through the contiguous air, not aCted on by the rarefying force. A
wind, therefore, will blow out of a place, in which. the air is fuddenly
rarefied ; and on this principle, in all probability,- it is, that, fince the
Sun's power in rarefying the air is·notorious, it mull neceffarily ha"VCI -a
great influence on the generation of winds; which lik.ewife ·penetrate
the very bowels of the earth, fince mofi: caves and chafms are foUDd
to emit wind, either more or lefs. M. Mufchenbroek has enumecated
a variety of caufes that produce winds, exifting iu the bowels of :the:
earth, on its furface, in the atmofphere, and above it. See his lntr. ad.
Phil. Nat. vol. ii. ·.'
The rifing and changing of the winds are determined experimentally,
.by means of weather-cocks, placed on the tops- of houfes, &c. But thefe
only indicate what paffes about their owu height, or near the furface of
the earth: Wol.fius affures us, from obfervations of fcveral J
ycata, 1tlmt
the higher winds, which drive the clouds, are different from. the 10'\~Rr
ones, which move the weather-cocks ; and Dr. Derham obferves f~
thing not unlike this, Phyf. Theol. lib. i. cap. 2. This author aUo re~

The force of ~e wind ~is as the fquatti ·ofit~..-e~ooity; as Mr. Fergufon
has 1bown by .experiments on tho whirling~table; -and in moderate velo-
cities this will ·hold very n~rly. It is· ·obferved, · with regard · to this
Table, that the evidence for ·thofe numbers, where the velocity of the
wind exceeds fifty miles an hour, does not feom of equal authority with
that of thofe of fifty :miles 'or under. ·Phil.· Tranf. vol. li. page 165.
Dr. Hales found (Statical Eff. voL ii. ) that the air rufhed·out ofa pair of
fmith's beJlows at the rate of 68·73 feet in a· fecond' of time, when ·com-
preffed with a force equal to the weight·of one inch perpendicular.depth
of mercury, lying on the whole upper furface of the bellows. · The-velo-
city of tbe air~ as it paffed out of the trunk of his ventilators, was found
to be at the rate of three thoufand feet in a minute; which is at the rate of
thirty-four miles in an hour; Dr. Hales fays, that the velocity with which
impelled air paffes out at any orifice, may ·he determined by banging a
light valve over the nofe of a bellows, by pliant leather hinges, ·which
will be much agitated and lifted up from a perpendicular to a more than
horizontal pofition by the force of the rtifhing air. There is another
more accurate. way, he fays, of eftimating tbe velocity of air; viz. by
holding:the orifice of an inverted gJafs liphon, .£ull of water, oppofite to
the fueam of.air,- whereby the water will be deprcffed in one leg, and
raifed in the other, in proportion to the force with whi~h the w~er is
impelled by t~ ·~ir.•_

As to the qualities and efFects of the wind, it is to be obferved~ that
a wind blowil)g from the fea is always moifr~ in fummer it is cold; and
in winter warm, unlefs the fea be froien-up. This is demonftrated thus:
ther~ is a vapour cqotin~aUy rifing-out -of all water,: (as appears even
hence, that a ·quantity of water, being left a. little while in an open
veffel, is found fellUbly diminifhed,) but -efpecially if it be expofed to the
Sun's rays, in which cafe the evaporatiot1 is beyond.all expectation. By
this means, the air incumbent on the fea becomes impregnated with a
quantity of vapours. But the winds, blowing from ofF the fea, fweep
thefe vapours aloDg with them; and ·confequently they are always moift.
Again, water in fummer, &c. receives lens heat than terreftrial bodies,
expofed to the fame rays of the Sun, do;- but, in wit1ter, fea-water is
warmer than the earth covered with froft and fr1ow~ &c. Wherefore,
as the air contiguous to any body is fOund to partake of its heat and cold,
the air contiguous to fea7water will be 'armer in winter, and colde~ in
fummer, than that c~mnguous to the ·earth. Or thus; vapours raifed
froni water by the 'Sun's warmth in winter, are 't&l1ller tJ!an the air they
rife in, (as appears from th~ yapours condcnfing, and becoming vifible~
almoft as foonJas they are got' out into :air~) .;. Frefil quantities of vapours.

therefore, continually warming the atmo1phere over the fea, will taife its
·heat beyond that of air over the land. Again, the Sun's rays refleCted
from the earth iuto the air, in fummer, are ·much more than thofe from
the water into air; the air, therefore, over the earth, warmed by the
refleCtion of more rays than that over water, is warmer. Hence, fea-
winds make thick, cloudy; hazy, weather. ·
Winds blowing from the continent are always dry; in fummer, warm;
and cold in winter. For there is much lefs vapour arifing from the earth
than from water; and therefore the air over the continent will be im·
pregnated with much fewer vapours. Add, that the vapours, or exha-
lations, raifed by a great degree .of heat out of the earth, are much
finer, and lefs fenfible, than thofe from water. The wind, therefore,
blowing over the continent, carries but little vapour with it, and is there-
fore dry. ·Farther, the earth in fummer is warme::r than water expofed
to the fame rays of the Sun. Hence, as the air partakes of the heat of
contiguous bodies, that over the earth in fummer will be warmer than
that over the water. After the lik~ manner it is 1hown, that the land-
winds are cold in winter. Hence1 we fee why land-winds make clear,
cold, weather. Our northerly and foutherly winds, however, which are
commonly efteemed the caufts of cold and warm weather, Dr. Derham
obferves,·are really rather the ejfofl of the cold or warmth of the atmof-
phere. Hence it is, that we frequently fee a warm foutherly wind, on a
fudden changed to the north,· by the fall of fnow or hail ; and that, in a '
cold frofty morning, we fee the wind north, which afterwards wheels
·about toward the foutherly quarter, when the Sun has weJl warmed the
air; and again, in the cold evening, turns northerly or eafterly.
The utility of winds has been univerfally acknowledged. The ancient
Perfians, Phreniciana, Greeks, and Romans, facrificed and erected tern-
'ples ~o the winds; as we ~earn ~rom ~ofiius, Theol~g. Gentil. lib. iii.

chines, applied in various ways to the fervice of mankind, and the benefits
refulting from them to navigation and trade, they ferve to purify and
refre1h the air, to convey the heat or cold of one region to another, to
produce a regular circulation of vapours from the ocean to countries re-
mote from it, and to fupply, by wafting them in their progrefs againft

by the feafons of .the year ; ·for, when the SuQ is far northward, the Bra._
fil S. £. wind gets to the foutb, atid the N. E. wind ·to the eaft·; and,
when the Sun is far fouth, the S. E. wind gets to the eafr, 'and the ·N. E.
winds on this fide of the equator veer more to the north. ·
Alo11g the coaft of Guinea, from Sierra Leone to the ifl~md of St. Tho-
mas, unde;C the equator~ which is above five hundred leagues, 'the fouth-
erly and fouth-weft winds blow perpetually; for, the S. E. trade-wind,
havtng paffed the equator, and approaching the Guinea coaft within eighty
or a hundred leagues, inclines toward the 111ore, and becomes fouth, then
S. E. and by degrees, as it comes near the land, it veers about to fouth,
S. S. W. and in with the.Iand it isS. W. and fometimes W. S. W. This
trad: is troubled with frequent calms, aud violent fudden gufts of wind,
called tornadoes, blowing from all points of the horizon.
Betw~en the fourth and tenth degrees of north latitude, and between
the longitudes of Cape Verd and the eafternmofr of the Cape-Verd ifies,
there is a tract of fea fubjeB: to perpetual calms, attended with frequent
thunder and lightning, and rains ; ·lhips, in failing thefe fiX degrees, are
faid to have been fometimes detained whole months. See·p. rooJ. ·
The three lafr obfervations account for two circumfrances which ma-
riners experience in failing from Europe to India, and in the Guinea trade.
The firft is, the difficulty which tbips, in going to the .fouthward, efpe-
cially in the months of July :and Auguft, find in paffing between the
coafts of Guinea and Brafil, although the breadth of.the fea is more·than
five hundred leagues. This happens, becaufe the S. E. winds at that
time of the year commonly extend fome ·degrees beyond the ordinary
limits of four degrees N. latitude; and, befides, coming fo much foutherly
as to be fometimes fouth, fometi~es a point or two to the weft ; it theil
only remains to ply to windward: and if, on the one fide, they fteer
W. S. W. they get a wind more and more eafrerly ; but then there is a.
. danger of falling ~n with the _Brafilian coaft, or 1hoals ; and, if they fteer
E. S. E. they fall mto the neighbourhood of the coaft of Gumea, from
whence they cannot depart without running eafrerly as far as the iflaod of
St. Thomas ; and this is the conftant praB:ice of all the Guinea-iliips.
Secondly, alllhips departing from Guinea fot· Europe, their direB: co~
is northward ; but on this courfe they cannot go, becaufe, the coafr bend-
ing nearly eaft and weft, the laud is to the ., northward : therefore, as
the wi~ds on' this coafi: are generally between the s. and w.·s. w. they
are obhged to fieer S. S. E. or fouth, and w~th thefe courfes they run otf
the 1hore ; but, in fo doing, they always find the winds more and· more con-

The winds are divided, with ·refpetl to the points of the. horizon fr9m
which they blow, into cardinal and collateral.-Winds cardi~:~aJ are tbofe
blowing from the four cardinal points ; Eaft, Weft, Nortb, and South.
Winds. co/lateral are the intermediate wind~ between.any· tV/9 cardinal
winds; the number of thefe is infinite, as the points from which they
blow are ; but only a few of them arc confider-ed in praCtice, i. e. only a
few of them have their diftmguiOUng names. The ancient Greek~, at
firfi:, only ufed the four cardinal· Qnes ; at length they took in four ltlore;
Vitruvius gives.us a table of twenty, befides the cardinals, which·were in
ufe among the Romans. The moderns, ~ their navigation is much
more perfeCl.than that of the anci~ts, hav.e .g~ven names totw~t_y-ejght
collateral winds, which they range into prima? and ftcondary; and the
fecondary they fi1bdivide into thofe of the firjt and ftcond order. The
Englith names of the primary collateral winds and point~ are compounded
of the nam~s of the cardinal ones, North an9 .South being ftillprefi~d.
The.names of: the fecondary collateral winds of tbe firft order are com~
pounded of tbe names of the cardinals and the adjacent primary one.
Thofe of the fecond order are compounded of the names of the cardinal
or the next adjacent primary and the next cardinal, with the addition of
the word by. The Latins have··diftinet names fQr each; a111 which are
exprelfed in the following Table. . . . · ~ . ·

and MRTJtOiloL·oozcAL ASTROLOGY.
Having defcribed the nature and properties of meteprolic appearances,
.and c~pl~ined the phenomena of eclipfes, cQmets, &c•.with the motions
.and attraCtions of the Earth, Moon, and Sun, as they affeCt the tides,
wind~, .atld atmofphere, we tball ·now confider their influence, jointly
.with tllat of the other planets and ftars, in producing the qontinual
changes and mutations. in the general affairs of ftates and _
empires; ;and
in the variations and changes of the weather, whereby plagues. ~nd
peftilences, droughts and inundations, and the confequent calamities of
fickly and diftrefsful times, are fought out and predicted; for, all ha\jing
_
the fame primitive caufe, namely, the attraClive power and influence of
_
the: plarie~ary fyfiem upon the elementa~y and. terrefrrial matter, they ar~
a•ike defi~~ble from a contemplation of the.occult properties ofthat celefiial
infl,ux, which this department of the afirologic fcience has, in all ages, been
found to teach. . . .
-· From what_has been premifed concerning the 'foregoing phenomena~
it .becomes:evident, that whatever affe4ts. the ftate of the air or atmof-
·phere mutl neceffarily, in an adequate: pr:9portion, alter the ftate of the
.)\feather ; and that, by how much .the mot:e the elements are impregnated
or charged with elearical matter, or that the motions of the 'Yiuds are
.iucreafed or. diminilhed, or that, the clouds are furcharged with moifr
and difcordant vapours, by fo much the more will fiormy, tempeftuous,
and unfettled,- weather, be produced. : So~ likewife, it is equally demon-
ftrable, that, as the temperature of the air, and the ftate of the ~mbient
and elementary matter, is from time to time varied and changed, Ol'
furcharged to a greater or lefs excefs with any particular quality, fo in a
proportionate de~ree ~ill the.animal fu.nClio!1s aqd fpiri!s of~en, be raifed
or depre1fed, their mmds agttated, .and theu-: paffions mflamed ; whence
arife putrid and malignant complaints thro~ghout whole provinces, and
difcord and malevolence among t~ different governme.nts and orders of
fociety. And, feeing thefe things are fo, that their c'aufes are brought
about by the attraaions and mutJLtiom of the Sun, Moon, and, Stars, in
their difFerent motions and pofitions, and in their conjunctions and op-
pofitions, and various configurations among themfelvC$ and with the
Earth ; and· fince we have feen that thefe motions and pofitions of the
planets, and all their different afpeCls, can be afcertaiued f~r any feries
of years to come ; fo it ·is mauifcrft, that, by knowing their influences
alld effi:as upon the air, earth, ·winds, _

This fpceulation is therefore deftiaed to b&, the art ol prosnolOeatioa by
the rules of aflron""'!· It is divided into tw& principal or diain& parts;
the one whereof is called- gmeral, or 1111iwr{al, beca'ltfe it rebates to whole

which, from the forer>ing theory ofeelipfes, tides~ and winds, it is JDaa.i-

In thd"e conuderations, two things ~re to b~ n!garded·, as th& priacipel

the1r qualttaes, w11l be lefs dtfiurbed ; Jakes and nvers 'fwell only to a
moderate height, fo as to increafe fertility and vegetation. The relllefs
ocean, now unaffailed by turbid fiorms and winds, affords fafe paffage to
the richly-freighted ihips from every quarter of the globe. In ihort, un-
der the unimpeded influence of this benign fiar, the produ8ions of the
earth will be poured furth in abundance, and all things contribute their

· ·Mars, having altme the dominion of the year, produces thofe evils re-
fulting fpontaneoufly from hi.s nature, which are intemperate heat and
drought. Mankind will hence be feized with violent corruptions of the
blood, apoplexies and fudden deaths. Spotted and fcarlet fevers will
abound principally in thofe countries over which he prdides, and where
.his mundane afpeCts moft forcibly pervade the earth; for, there will his
no:xious influence prove moft fatal. Political affairs, uuder this influx.,
are marked with violence and oppreffion. Wars .break out between con-
tending princes, and fire and fword defolate the country, and level all
before them. Jnteftine broils, infurretlions, treafon, and murder, ftain
the land with innocent blood, and complete the fad catalogue of human
misfortunes. The brute creation, and particularly thofe appropriated for·
the food and fervice of man, will be grievoufly affiitled; epidemic difor-
ders will break out amongfr them, and the heat and drought will prove
extremely fatal to horfes. The fruits of the earth will be burnt up, fod-
der and grafs for cattle every-where deftroyed, and all vegetation in a
manner iufpended. Rivers, lakes, and ponds, will be dried up, the fprings
of the earth cxhaufted; and, at the -
rifing of the dog-fiar, Nature as it
were will ficken, and refpir;~tion be difficult and faint; dogs will run
mad, and epidemic contagion fpread throughout whole empires. The
fea, in a manner, ftagnated with calms, will put navigation and com-
merce almoft to a ftand, whereby a dearth of corn, and other neceffaries
of life, will be felt in many countries, and pave the way to the fevcreft

: Seeing, therefore, that this fpeculation comprifes two different and
dillina fubjeCl:s; na~ely, the general fiate ofthe weather; and feeondly,
the mutations and revolutions of countries and empires ; it will be proper
to confider them upon the bafis already laid down, under their refpecnve
and particular beads ; and firft,
Of the WE AT H E R.
As it is in the air or atmofphere that all plants and animals tive and
breathe, .and as that appears to be the great principle of moll: animal and
vegetable produCtions, alterations, &c. there does not feem any thing,
in air philofophy, of more immediate concernment to us, than the fiate
of the :wtathl!r. In effect, all living things are only affemblages OJ'
btmdfca- of veffels, whofe juices are kept moving by the prdfure of the
a.tmofphere; and which, by that motion, maintain life. So that any at.:.
terations in the rarity or denfity, the heat, · purity,. &c. of that, muft
aeoeffarily be attended with proportionable ones in thefe. What great,
yet .regular, .alterations, a little change of weather makes in a tube filled
with.mercury, ()r fpirit of wine, or jn a piece of firing, &c. every body
knows, in the .common infiance of barometers, thermometers, hygrome-
ters, &c. and it is owing partly to our inattention, and partly to our une-
qual in•
temperate courfe ofliving, that we do not feel as great and as regular
ones mthe tubes, chords, and fibres, of our own bodies. . It is certain a
great part of:the ·brute-creation have a fenfibi1ity and fagacity, this way,
beyond mankind; and yet, without any means or difpofit;on thereto, more
than w:e ; except that their veffels, fibres, &c. being in other refpeCts in
ene eqtaable habitude, the fame or a proportionable~a'llie from w1thout has
alw,ays a -like or proportionable effeCt: on them ; that is, their ve{fels are
Rgular barometers, &c. affetted only from one external principle, viz. the
dnpolttion .of the atmofphere; whereas ours are aCted on ·by divers from
within;, :as well as without; fome of :which check, impe<Je, and prevent,
the aCtion of·others. But to atcertain the limits of thefe va·rious afFe8ions
requ~s a theory of the weather founded on aftrological and mechanical
principles. ·

tion or oppofition, happen in a moift, dry, or cold, manfion; and of what
planets they are afpected, and likewife if the ruling planets be conjoined
in fuch a manfion with the lord of the fign of that conjunCtion or opp~
fition, and the lord of the afcendant; as alfo the almuten, or general lord ·
of the figure, not neglecting the fixed ftars of the firft, fecond, and third,
magnitude, their rifing, fetting, and culminating, with planets of the
fame nature, or having conveniency of afpeCl or radiation. Alfo, dili-
gently confider the lord of the eclipfe, or ruling planet, of the great con-
junCtion next preceding, if any do immediately precede ; which being
truly noted, obferve carefully what planet or fixed ftar he ihall-be corpo-
rally coujoined with, or apply to, next after the conjuneti_on or oppofition
of the Sun and Moon ; for according to the nature thereof will the·fc::afon
generally be inclined. 1f Saturn therefore be well difpofed in an angle,
and in a moift afterifm, without impediment, or applying to another .
planet at the time of the Sun's ingrefs, it prefages temperate and fea-
fonable lhowers, and filleth the heaven with obfcure clouds, efpecially in
that lunation wherein he hath the chief dominion. But if, on the con-
trary, he be impedited, or eviJly difpofed, it portends turbulent ftorms of
wind and rain, and cold, denfe, and thick, clouds ; efpecially if Venus or ·
Mercury be in moift figns, and behold him from an angle; for, in that
cafe, there will be much rain. Jupiter, in fuch a pofition, produceth
winds and rain, with reddiih clouds; Mars engenders yellow clouds,
thunder, corrufcations, and rain, efpecially in thofe times and places proper
and convenient, and the rather if Jupiter and Mercury give any teftimony
thereto. The Sun, irradiated in that manner, produces red clouds and a
great deal of wet. The Moon applying to VetlUs, and a/fuming the
above prerogatives, brings gentle rain : but, if the Moon applies to Mer-
cury, or if Mercury be lord and ruler o{ the figure with Jupiter, it
portends ihowers and violent winds, and cloudy air; yet fometimes more·
violent, and fometimes more remifs, according to the figns, afterifm.-
manfions of the Moon, and the conjuClions of the other ftars, either fixed.
or erratic. And here note, that, if the ruling planet be oriental, his:
effeCts will appear in the end ; if occidental, in the beginning, whether
it. be in a revolution, a folar ingrefs, or a lunation.
A fcheme of the heavens, ereCted for the Sl:ln's entrance into the 6rft
fcruple of Aries, will, with the help of the Moon's principal afpeas
and configurations with the Sun and other planets at her feveral changes, ·
determine the general ftate of the weather for that quarter. But,.in this.
fpecies of prediCtion, we muft never lofe fight of the influence and at-
traction of the Earth, nor of the force and peculiarity of each climate
refp~Clively, as heretofore laid down in our confideration of tides, winds,

lar fituation of.difFereut climates or c;ouatr.ics with·refpetl to the Sun, and
would have taeir weather fixed and .certain, the fame as their' increafe or
decreafe of day or night, were it not for the attractive and expulfive force
of the other celeftial bodies, which are inceffantly varying that of the Sun
and of one ·other, ·according to their different pofitions and afpects.
Hence it is necetfary, before we attempt to give ju.dgment of the wea-
ther in any particular country or climate, to be well informed of its ·
particular fituation with refpect to land and fea, mountains and valleys,
iflands and contineots, caverns and lakes; as well as of its geographical
pofition, with refpect to the tropics, equinoctial, ecliptic, &c. for, as
every different climate is differently affected by the Sun's influence upoa
it, as well as by the quality of its own proper foil or componeut parts,
fo .will the action of ~he other celeftial bodies thereupon be more power-
.ful or remifs, as their nature and quality ihall be found to agree . with
or.oppofe the ·ftate aud temperature of thofe climates, and the Sun's influ-
ence at thofe times upon them. Hence we fee clearly the extreme diffi-
culty of calculating the weather for-England, Ireland, or any of the iflands,
which, being furrounded by the fea, are fubject to much greater varia-
tions of weather than any of the continents or great oceans. The
caufe is apparent. In England, we find almoft every flight configura-
tion .of the Sun and Moon, and the rifing and fetting of particular ftars,
will change the ftate of the atmofphere almoft inftantaneoufly; and, from
the proximity of the fea every-w·ay rouud us, and the confequent moift
vapours ·incetfandy drawn up into the air by the attraCtion of thefe bodies,
we become fubject to wet, cloudy, corrufcuous, weather, which extends
not. to any.of the furrounding coafts, but is peculiar only to the ifland ·
over which thefc vapours are engendered. And hence it is we often fee
1howers, which, though accompanied with violent thunder, lightning,
wind, and hail, are frequently not heard of at a few miles diftance; and
that, when in one county there has been a drought, and the land and corn
almoft dried and parched up, in the ne:xt adjoining county t~ey thall be
vifited with frequent 1h~wers, ~nd the fruits of the earth be luxuriant and
fiouri1hing. This fact muft be within every man's obfervation who
r.efides in England; and.the caufe is entirely peculiar tothe country. The
Qloifi: vapours of the contiguous ocean are drawn up into the clouds one
hour; and, by the oppofing influence of fome planet or ftar then rifing
or.culminating, are driven down the next; whence it is obvious, that all
attempts to·foretel fuch mutations and changes as thefe are abfurd and
futile. . TheobjeCl of this part of Aftrology means only to afcertain t-hofe
great and powerful operations of the ftars, which thall be .felt 'generally

The r..e.xt thing to be .confidcred ~b relation to the weather, is the oon..
jum~ions and afpeCts of the planets. The conjunCtion of Safum aDd Ju-
piter, which ought accurately to be obfe.rved., prodltt:eS its ·dfcCts ·in tfte

the ·etfe& produced by this conjunaion will be fDf tbe..oaturc.of the rul..

conjunction, and is elevated, above Jupiter in refpetlof latitude, it denotes
many difea.fes, and muah evil 1in general ; but the. CODtrary., f.f Jupiter
prevails. So likewife thefe two ponderous planets beit•g in oppofttion;

cold air and dryuefs; particularly in the fpring, it produces wind and
rain; in fummer, wind and thowers; ·in autumn, wind and clouds;
and, in winter, wind and fi1ow. Saturn and the Moon, in conjunction;
quartile, or oppofition, affeCl: the air according to that part of the afterifm
wherein they are conjoined or afpetl:ed. In the moift figns, it portends
clouds and coldnefs; in the airy, aud in Sagittarius and Capricorn, it in-
creafeth cold, efpecially when ·the Moon is of full light; and, when the
is void of courfe, it brings forth drynefs ; but, in dry figns, it begetteth
1harp air, and a frofry feafon, if it be in winter. GeneraJly, the Moon and
Saturn ftir up thick clouds and gentle thowers. In the fpring, it is a 6gn
of a turbid and moifr air; in fummer, moifture, with remiffion of heat,
and fometimes hail, if there be any afpetl: of Mars or Mercury ; in autumn,
it prefages a cloudy air; in winter, clouds and fnow, with vehement
cold.
· Jupiter and Mars, in conjunCl:ion, quartile, or oppofition, change the
quality of the air, according to the nature of the 6gns and frars to which
they are conjoined or otherwife.afpected. In hot and dry manfions, it
~aufeth great heat; in the moift figns, thunder and rain ; but, particularly
in the fpring-time, it produceth winds and turbulent air ; in fummer,.
heat, and thunder and lightning; in autumn, tempefruous and windy
air; and in winter, remiffion of cold and temperature of air. But, in
thia conjunCl:iou, we muft obferve the ruling planet; for, if Jupiter 1hall
rule and be elevated above Mars, it lignifies much good and felicity, plenty
of fruit, and fuch things as ferve for the fufienance:of mankind, accord-
ing to his benevolent nature ; but, Mars ruling, produceth many difeafes,
drynefs, houfe-burnings, and th~ like. Alfo, Jupiter and Mars, with tem-
peftuous ftars, as Arcturus, the Eagle, Tail of the Dolphin, light ftar of
the Crown, &c. frir up wind and hail, and in fummer alfo thunder;
in winter, he inclineth the air to warmth, efpecially if Jupiter be then
ftationary. Jupiter and the Sun, in COiijuntl:ion, quartile, or oppofi-

In tbe revolution of the year, if Mars fuall be in his own fign, it por-
tends much rain; if be be in the houfe of Saturn, it 1hows but little; in
others, but .a mediocrity. In the revolution of the year, when Venus,
Mercury, and the Moon, are found iu moifi manfious, it portends much
rain. At the ingrefs of the Suu in tropical figus, if Venus 1hall afpect the
Moon from a moifi place, it is a token of much rain ; or, if Mars from
Scorpio thall afpect Venus, it portends likewife rain. When the Sun
is in Aries or Taurus. if Venu$ be then retrograde, the fpring will be
moifi. The Sun in the terms of Mars increafeth the heat in fummer,
and drynef~ of the fprings in wimer. In the conjunctiou or oppofitiou
pr-eceding the entrance ()f the Sun into Aries; and alfo in the ingrefs it..
felf, if tbe Moon behold Satqro, and both be in moifi figns, it is the
prcfage of thick clouds, or foft and gentle ihowers continuing long;
but, if Venus or Mercury behold Saturn, theu the rain will b~ more
vehement, aud of long continuance.
If, in the autumnal quarter, mQre retrograde planet:s be with the Sun
than-in the other feafon~, which in the winter following will become di-
reCl, it is· a fign of great drynefs. When the Sun ertter$ the eigbteentl) de-
gtee of Scorpio, if Mercury be in a moift place, it is a ligu of rain ; and
obferve alfo ·the planet that is then almuten of the figure erefled for that
D!lOment, and pronounce judgment according to his nature and pofition.
Veoua in winter. dire¢1 and oriental of the Sun, Ggnifies but little rain
in the beginning of wiqter~ and more fiore towards. the en-d. When
Venus applies .to Mars in Scorpio, it brings rain im·mcdiately. When
the Sun, ~oon, Venus, and Merc~ry, are aU conjoined together,. it ar-
gues contmual thowers that day, 1f the Moon beholds them from -fome
other place, or if the be in oppofitiorl to them. When at the time of

of a moift nature, and the Moon after feparation thaJl conjoin or have af-

if all incline to drynefs, it will be dry ; if to warmth, pronounce hot
weather; if to cold, cold weather. The nature of the' time will then
chiefly be moved, when the Moon, after conju.nCtion, quartile, or oppo-

And, when the Moon comes to the fign afceuding of the conjunCtion,
quartile, or oppofition, ·the time will be changed according to the quality
and nature of the figu and afierifm.
Daily experience thows, that the weather is much· varied by the fitua-
tion of the winds; for, according to their different bearing is the fcafon
much inclined, fometimes to bail, rain, and fnow, and again to fair wea~
ther; wherefore I thall frate thofe afpeCts which arc found to attraCt, raife,_
vary, or alter, the potition of the winds, as they alternately rife or fet in ·
parallels to the different bearings of the Earth. Befides thefe, there are
the lateral and collateral winds blowing between thefe points, which'
partake more or lefs of the quality of the fore~oing, ~s they approach or_
recede from them. In the figure of the ·Sun's mgrefs mto any of the car-·
dinal figns, or conjunCtion or oppofition of the luminaries preceding, oi

The rifing and fetting of thefe ftar8 and conftellations might be known,
and their effeCts in fome degree pre-determined, by the fudden alterations
and changes we perceive in the atmofphere ; from which, by diligent
obfervation, and repeated experience, we may derive pretty accurate rules·
how to judge of the weather, fo as to regulate our conduct in the profe-
cution of journeys, or the management of bufinefs, particularly fuch as
relates to gardening and huibandry.
The air, in which we breathe, being co-m_
ixt with inflammable va-
pours, at which time it is hotter ·than ordinary, and unapt for refpira-
tion, 1bows the approach of thunder and lightning.--When the ringing
of bells, or other founds, are heard loud and faint, with difcordant parti-
cles, and by intervals, it thows the air to be dilated and difturbed, pre-
fages either wind or rai'n, and fometimes both.-A tharp and cold wind
after rain fore1hows more to come, the exhalation or vapour not be-
ing fpenf in the former 1hower.-Winds, that continue long in any one
of the cardinal points, will caufe the weather to continue the fame, ·
whether it be fair or foul ; but, if it 1hifta often in changing its place, it
prefageth rain quickly after to enfue ; but, in times of frofi, it is a fign
that the weather is about to break.-Whirlwinds predict approaching
ftorms of rain and hail; thefe winds.are known by raifing the duft or
any light materials, and they are oftentimes forerunners of great tem-
pefts, for it is a windy exhalation driven obliquely upon the horizontal
plane, and forced down by the coldnefs or moifture of the lower region;
this repercuffio~ of the air caufeth chimneys. to fmoke which do not at
other times, and fore1hows great ·winds.-Sometimes whirlwinds are
caufed by the meeting of one another; and fo, raifing light particles of
matter, as it were in contention with each other, hurls them.to and fro at
the pleafure of the prevailing power ; and fuch as thefe ufuaUy prefagc
tempefts, and may be known by the clouds moving feveral ways at once,
from the fame caufe above as below.-When the air is dilated or rarefied,
it is a fign of m~h heat, or elfe produces rain, which might be known
by the french of fewers, foul places, or things. corrupted,. whicq are
more offenftve than at ·other times.-When.the clouds. are dark, deep,
and lowering, it is a fign of rain, and fometimes of tt:mpeftuous weather,
ot of violent ftorms of thunder and lightning. If there be more thunder
than lightning, it ~rgues a firers o_f wind from that part whence it thunder-
ed, aud alfo of ram.-When 1t hghtens and no Clap of thunder fucceeds,
it is a fign in fummcr of much heat, and fometimes of rain.-When it light-
ens only from the north-weft, it betokens rain the next day.-Lightning

THE
SUN's INGRESS
Into the EquinoB:ial SIGN
A R I E s,

.i'o
1]89.
Such was the pofition of the heavens at the time of the Sun,s en-
trance into the firfi: point of Aries, being the commencement of the fpring
or vernal quarter of I 789,. which happened that year on the 19th of
March, at 15 h. 52 m. or, according to civil time, at fifty-two minutes
paft three o'clock in the morning of the 20th day, for which the above
fcheme is accurately calculated,
In drawing judgment of the fl:ate and temperature of the weather from
this figure, we mull: not only confider the afpeCis and configurations of
the luminaries and planets, but note the quality of the figns and tripli-
cities wherein they are pofited, and what will be the chief or predomi-
nant influence of the fuperiors. After which, the afpetrs muft be regu-
larly fet down in fucceffion till the com.mencement of the next enfuing
quarter, when a figure of that ingrefs muft alfo be calculated, and con-
fidered in the fame manner as the preceding, together with the place of
the Sun and quality of the feafon; by which means we ihall find the

weather wiJI be pretty accurately afcertained, for any length of time that·
-
the calculation is made,
.T
At the commencement of the fpring-quarter, we find the cold ponder-
ous planet Saturn juA: departed from au almofi abfolute rule and govern-
ment in the watery lign Pifces, and in no afpect either with Jupit~r or
the Sun. This is a demonftrable proofof the intenfe coldnefs ofthe pre-
ceding quarter; for, fince Saturn is of a hardening afiringent nature, the
waters mull: be congealed; and a cold durable froft evidently diftinguithed
the Commencement of the year I 789. But the cafe was r:naterially dif-
ferent towards the approach of the vernal equinox, when the Sun entered
into the tign Aries ; at which time the cold influence of Saturn was mi-
tigated by a trine afpett of Jupiter, and by the increafing firength of
the beams of Sol. Nevertbelefs, fince there are five planets configurated
in watery figns, and the influx of Saturn not entirely abated, and alfo
Iince we find the preceding provential Full Moon in a watery fign, we
fafely concluded that the fpring-quarter mull: for the firft part be cold
and wet ; the wind, leaning mofily to the north and eafi, occafioned fleet,
and fnow or hail intermingled with rain ; towards the middle, wefterly
gales of wind, and ftorms of rain and hail ; but moderate towards the
end, with the wind mofily down to·the fouthern point of the compafs.
The followin~ afpecb, particularly of the Sun and Moon, will fhow the
precife variations and general inclinations of the weather on each of thofe
days. • .

Of the REVOLUTIONS of KINGDOMS and_STATES.
The fignificators which take precedence in this department of thct
occult fc·ience, and the governing afpeCl:s, havin-g already been amply
explained, it will in this place be only necellary to lay down the general
ground of its theory, and to offer fome recent examples in jufiification of
its practice, and in proof of its utility.
After the impreffive influx of the planetary configurations. tha .uni..
~er~ll and par:ticular effeCts of comets, eclipfes, aqd great conjunctipna;.
'lS:t;c· no~t to pe confideretl in this [peculation. Cornets, indeed, rarely ·
appc:f!r ; but, whenever they do, fome great and figual event has alway..s · .
been ,remarked to follow, and , of the nature and quality of thofe ligna·
and n~C\nfions of the heavens where they form perfea afpeCl:s with the,
.Earth; but which is moll: fenfibly felt in thofe countries or fiates to.
whiq_h the nuoleus or tail of the comet is at thofe times apparently di- ,

The influence of Eclipfes upon mundane affairs has been much que(:.
rioned by fome modern authors of no fmall weight in the ~it.erar.y .fcate ;
but I beg leave to remark, that the tJl(j)fi _
per.fect of human-.be.ings are at.
heft but. imperfect, and contequcntly fubjeCt to: be fwayed by prejudice.,
aud to adopt faUe notions of w-hatever ·doCtrines they oppofe.-Tbat
fuch is the cafe with.thofe authors who deny .the force of eclipfes, re-
quires nothing more than unprejudiced enquiry and experimental .obfer-

take ·off from their exterual. awfulnefa and grandeur; but their .effeCt.
upoa1 the ambient, and confeq_ueotly upon the atfairs of the.world, wilL
be ever fouud to remain the fame.
The etfeas of eclipfc:s ar.ife. not mer.ely from the ob(cur•tiqn. of light,..
bu~ from their pofition, the quality of the figns wherein they fall,. and.of
the .6gni6cators with whicb . they arc conjoined. Hence their ,cor~C.­

countries eclipfes will. happen, and the ftations of the impulfive planets.

feized by tho accident; and with greater or Jefs :'viulence, in proportion.
to the fJUantity of digits eclipfed over each place refpeaively. . For eclip-
fcs have no inftuence where they are':invifible, and aa with :the.greatcft
force where they are central and total; and therefore fubtcrrancari eclipfes
ha~e no effeCt · or in6ut:nce .whatever, uotwithfianding what -
.barb been
wntten to the contrary by common afirologers,'almanac-makers, and the-
like. ·
The fecond confideration is temporal, by which we know the time
when the events ihall happen, and how long·they will continue. . This
we furvey after the following manner. ln ..eclipfes ·which are made at
the fame time, feeing they do not fall every-where. alike, nor fufiain uni-
verfally the fame degrees of obfcuration, nor continue alike in point of
time at any two given places, it is neceffary to ereCt a figure \.Jnder the ele-
-vation of the pole of that particular ·place for which its efF.eCl is to be cal..
culated. -
By.means of this,.we exaCtly fee the beginning, middle, and end,
of the eclivfe, and the content of its duration ; by which the time it·
known when ·the portended event will begin to happen. lf the eclipfe
be of the Sun, fo many years are allowed:for the. event as -the obfcuration
apeafured hours; b\_lt, if an eclipfe of the Moon, infiead of years fo
many months are to be accounted ; becaufe of her proximity to the.Earth,
and'quicker influenc-e. The beginning of ·the event and the general in-·
teution are known from the fituation of the edipfe with refpeB: to the
eclipticalline, and the angles of the figure. If the middle time .of a folar
eclipfe fa-lls in or near the afcending horizon, its efFett will. begin to appear
in that :eoilntry OYer which it is elevated, in the firfi four months. after its
appearance; but its greatell: effeCt will happen in the firfi third-part of that
given time. Should the middle time of the Sun's eclipfe fall in or near
the midheaven, the e~ent will not begin till the fecond four-months ;
and the intention or grand efFeCt will not take place till the fecond .third-
part of the time given. And fo likewife, if the middle of the eclipfe-
happens in or near the wefiern horizon, the efFeCl: will take place in the'
third four-months after, and its intention or greater forc-e in the Jall
thir,d-part. thereof. But, in eclipfes of tbe Moou, the time is equated
differently ; for, if they happen in or uear the eafiern horizon, their ctt-
feCl: will fall upon the place over which they are elevated aImoll: imme-
diately; and, if ~n or near the meridian, .within a week or ten days; ·or,.
if in or near the wefiern -horizon, then their inflUence will be felt within-
a fortnight or twenty days after;.and~ the general intention or moll ·vifible
iuftucnce will in each cafe almoft inftantaneoufiy fucceed. . . . .

· tho~ which are fubfervient to man's ufe; it ar~s the evil will arife
;thrOligh them, as a'murrain, rot, or epidemic difeafe. Moreover, if the
:rulirig·phices fall in or near the Eagle, or fimilar conftellations, the evil
·-will' fall on volatiles, and fuch chiefly as are apt for the food and fufte-.
· nance of man ; but if they fall in or near the Dolphin, the effeCts will
hap-pen at fea, and deftruCl:ion is portended to the fleets and navies of that
country over which the influence bears the greateft rule. If they happen
in tropical or equinoxial figns, the evil comes by intemperate feafons, and
·by inundations of many waters. If in the midheaven, they threaten
evil to the reigning powers of that country over which they prefide;
·and a vifible alteration either in·its government or laws commonly hap..
: pens. But the quantity or importance of the event is known from tbe-
greatnefs of the obfcuration, confidered with regard to ..the fignificators
· or ruling planets which have dominion of the eclipfe. For occidental
configurations made to folar eclipfes, or, oriental to lunar, -diminiih the
etfetts; whereas, on the contrary, oriental afpects made with folar.
cclipfes, and occidental with lunar, greatly augment them.
The fourth and Iaft confideration is, the knowledge and prefciencb ·o~­
·the effect, whether good or evil; and this we know, from the virtue of
the fiars ruling or claiming dominion over the principal places of the
·figure, and from the mixture which they have with each other, and
with the influences of the eclipfes over which they have dominion. For
the Sun and Moon, as it were, rule and govern the ftars; becaufe they have
·a certain power and dominion over ·them. And the (peculation ofthe
·anixturc of the ·~ars, as they are fubordinate to each other, manifefts the
quality of their effeCt; and hence it isthat the effeaive power is deduced,
whether good or bad, from the temperature of thofe fignificators which .
hold the dominion and produce the effeCt, agreeable to their own proper
·nature and quality, as hath been heretofore abundantly lhown.
To reduce what ·has been faid into praaical obfervation, we wiiJ rc.- .
vert back·to the foregoing fcbeme or figure of the heavens, ereCted for·
·the Sun~s entrance into Aries in the fpring of the year I 789.· The- figns,

princely fignificator·of .George the Third, thows that amity and concord
will ffill exift between .the ·two powers, notwithftanding their domeftic
broils, and the endeavours .of reftlefs fpirits to ftir up the minds of the
people to rapine and war. Hence will probably follow great difturbances
amongft the heads of the church, and lead to new difcoveries in the annals
of popiili fuperftition and religious perfecution, which the people of that
unhappy country feem inclined to fhake off, with the thackles of flavery,
mifery, and want. In fine, here is every profpe&, from the difpofition
of the figni6cators in this fcheme, that fome very important events will
happen in the politics of France, fuch as may dethrone, or very nearly
touch the life of, the king, and make viClims of many great and illuf-
trious men in church and ftate, preparatory to a revolution or change in
the affairs of that empire, which will at once aftonith and furprife the
furrounding nations.
England, I am happy to fay, has every profpeet of harmony and peace;
and, from the fuperior fttength and elevation of her fignificators, will give
laws to her enemies, and peace and profperity to·her allies. She will
be looked up .to from the belligerent powers in the north, to interpofe her
potent arm to bring about a reftoration of peace amongft them, and to
awe, with her thunder, thofe who afpire to extend their dominion by the
ravages of war. ltl the internal management of her affairs, the prefent
epoch will be glorious ; and, fave a few anxieties amongft party-men, and
a temporary alarm for the fcarcity of corn, which will be augmented by
the uncommon continuance of wet. weather, occafioned by the long
fiations of the Moon and! ~her fignificators in the watery trigon, I do
not fee any probability of the peace and harmony of Great Britain being
difturbed by the prefent contentions between other ftates, but, on the con-
.trary,·the will aCl as a mediator between them, and will advance in glory
and renown over every part of the.habitable globe.•
Having fait) thus much upon the vernal fcheme, or fi$Ure of the heavens,

his place call the attentaon of my reader to
that remarkable rera in the Britith biftory, which gave independence to

racy and prccifion for this purpo~. · ·
In the vernal equinox, we find Jupiter is lord of tbc,Bfeendaat, aod in
his detriment. Mars we find in Aries, wbich is the afcendaot of England,
thong and powerful in his own hou:fe, bot under the Earth. The Moon,
who reprefents the common people, we fincl under aftliClioo, ·being com-
bull of tbe San ; and Mara, being comb~ alfo~ fordbcnn that En~d,
though her internal drength is great aDd permanmt, yet ihe will thi;
year be accidentally affiiaed and depreffed; more efpecially as•we ftnd
Mars going to an oppofition of Saturn, and Saturn uncommonly firon~ in
the midbcavcn, in his exaltation~ aod beheld by die two fortunes Jupter

In this figure the planet Saturn ~ tbe fignifieator of America, and Man
reprefents the people of Great·Britain; as may very eafily be feen by takiog
down the dignities of Saturn and Murs, a<:coming to the Table in page

the fuperiority of power, and that
Mars and Satum are inimical in their nature: to each other, are fafls too
·evident to be denied; and, as the -
afpea which is aboot to be formed be-
tween them is a malevolent one, natnely, a partile oppofitiQn, it declares
the ev~nt.fhall be fuch as to caufe a tutal and eternal kparation CJf the two
countries from each other ; and that the congrefs, which is rcprefented by
Saturn, will efi.abliih an independent and complete revolution, which thall
·

At this time Jupiter ~a Y.emus ~in k:onjunetion, and appeared to
meet a.9 cotinfcl with the Sun:and·Mercury in thc.celcftial Crab, in that
part of .the heavens appropriated .to :the manfions of: the .Moon. The
~<JOn was then alfo .arrived ·at:the oppofite·point.of that{particular place
in the heavens: where ihe was .pofited at the time.oLthe:ingrefs, and dif-
pofcd ·of by ;Satqrri, :the··ugnmcator. of America~ ·' · :Hence .it: will .appear,

tention .the:various tranfaetions of thofe·:who weic tbe .princ.ip,al aCtors in
the 1
bufinefs, and'comparc the ·rcfult;with what is :prenoted by the fore-
go_ing figures, according to the rules heretofore laid .down to :determine
planetary influx, we thall find no difficulty in tracing every important
event, with afioniihing cxaetnefs and precifion, that can in any thape re-
late to this department of the aft~al fcience.
I could here add a variety of other examples, in fupport of atlral influ-
ence upon fynods and ftates, and in promoting, as fecond caufes under
heaven, the rife and fall of empires, and the revolutions of the world.
But enough has furely been faid to illufirate this enquiry' to the fulleft
extent, and to render it obvious to the meaneft capacity, particularly as
the nature of .th~ p~ane~s an~ ,fign~, and. tpe ~oufe~ a~?. manfions of t~e
heavens, contmu6 umUtorably -the ·fame Hrall•caff~, wttb refpea to theJr
influence and tendency; and require only to be applied to the nature of
the queftion, nativity, or revolution, whichever it may chance to be~
agreeable to the rules fo amply given for that purpofe; and I will be
bold to fay, that the utmoft fatisfaetion will refult to every fober enquirer,
the more be purfues, and the deeper he contemplates, this incomparable
fiudy.
I am not, however, to expect that all men will be converts to my
opinion, or fubfcribe to the evidence I have fo abundantly brought in
defence of my doll:rine. The felf-willed, and the claffically obftinate,.
are not to be moved by any fpecies of reafoning, incompatible with their
own way of thinking; and it would be the extreme of folly, after tfte
arguments I have adduced, to attempt to r~move that mi11: from before
their eyes, which ·blinds their reafon, and contaminates their fenfe. If
proofs of all denominations, and the experience of every day and hour we
live, arc incapable of impreffing the mind with the truths Q( elementary
influx and fidereal affeCtions, it is not all my faint ideas can furnith
through the medium of my pen that will either penetrate the heart or
operate to convince on this occafion. Others there are, who moll: cordi-
ally believe whatever their own eyes and their own ears can demon-
ftrate; but who are infidels to every occult property,. aud to the fecret

Of the CELESTIAL SCIENCE of
A s T R 0·· L 0 G Y.
PAR ·
T the FO.URTH.
FROM what has been premifed in the foregoing parts of this w-ork,
it will now become manifeft to every unprejudiced reader, that
Afl:rology and Magic, how much foever they have: been confounded with
each other, and confidered by the vulgar as one and the fame doCtrine,
are neverthelefs two very oppofite and difiinet purfuits. T(le one not
only fuppofes, but in ~ruth is, an attainment of the contingencies and
events of futurity from a natural caufe implanted in the motion and in-
fluence: of the fpheres, .which it is at once honourable and praifeworthy
to ftudy ;· the other, an .acquirement of particular events to come, or m.~f­
chiefs to be performed, by means of occult fpells, diabolical incantations,
the agency of fpirits, or c.onfederacy with the devil. This confiitutes
what is termed Magic, Exorcifm, \Vitchcrafr, and Divination, very aptly
termed " The Black Art,~~ which it ihall be the principal objeCt -of the
following pages to illuftrate ; as well to give the reader fome rational idea
of that. very ancient but mifchievou$ pratlice, as to clear the fublimc con-
templation and fiudy of the fiars from the grotS imputations ,it hath on
that account fufiained. . -
I have no doubt but the greater part of my r-eaders, and perh*'ps the
b1,1lk of mankind at this day, totally .difuelieve the poffibility of witch-
craft, magic, or divination ; b~ca,ufe, they deny the very eKifience of
fpirits, the agency of the devil, and the appearance of ghofis or fpirits of
deceafed men, upon w.hich belief the praCl:ice of the black art entirely
depends. But, however incredulous ·the wifeft man may 8e, as to what
has been r~Jated 0•1 this ful}jetl, certain it is, that fuch fpirits really do

no uncem~~ th~ng. ~ Blac~ftone feems to have eftabliQted this faCl: in a
very fansfati6ry mann~r, where he fpeaks of the Jaws foro:tetly provided
in this country againft witches, -and thofe who held confederacy with
fpirits; which to pifuelieve, would. not only be found to militate againft
numerous im'portan't pa'lrages of Scripture, but W'ou1d call ir\ ·quefiion the
exprefs words of our Saviour himfelf, and give the lie to authors and at-
teftators of the firft reputation and charaCl:er. Indeed, the force of reve-
la~ion, add fhe doelri'ne of Cbrifi, dipends very much upon o4r 'Opinion·of
~tne exiftlr·ice of fplrits ; for t'nat, being confeffed or dou'bted, either atlirms
or denies the eternity of the foul.
'
Thofe perfons, who have taK.en paii1s ·to contemplate the nature and
ftruCl:ure of man, will ~ve no ·c:HlHculty 'to believ-e,, ftom the principles
of reafon and common fenfe, that a foul, effence, or fpirit, abfolutely
exifts within his body, totally independ.ent of all material funCl:ions or
·defires; that flies in his face upon the commiffion of every unjuft or im-
·proper aCt, arid :rhat leads 'the human ideas to a ·ftate of ·being infinitdy
'b¢yond the ·hounds of·the 'te~reftrial:globe, and unconftrained by the limits
. of time. This applies to th-e ·effence, ·foul, or fpirit, of·man; wheteats
the ·body, being compounded of the elerileots of tHis world, ·is 'fwayed,.
·ruled, .and eventually overcome, ·
.by them, ·in proportion'as the elements
~perate upon one another, fo ·as to produce difeafes, imbecility,-and death.
·As it 'is agreed by'all authors, and aatnitted in the creed ·of 'all fe8s
and p~rfuafions of people, that, before.the fall, tho feaforl'S·and·elem~n~s
were m ·one unalterable ll:ate of perfeCl:ton ·and harmony; fo the·cond1._
tion of man was not then under the power of the elements, but be was
clothed with purity and ·immortality as with a ·garment. The external
grofs elements had then n·o ·fway ; · and the afi:ral. powers, ·inftead of 'in-
flaming h~s de.fires, ·contributed unto him the influences .of. like ·unt:-o
like, fonnmg'Bn union,of deleCtable ideas between foul and·bod1, 'wbith
ted to the ·utiabatee:l ·praife and·adotation of his beneficent ·Creator. Th¢
pure elements were then congeneal to his ftate of ·immortality,- and 1 th~

real fiatt ·into till the pe~ils of mortality and death. Having .no louger
all powers undet his fubje8ion, he became fubjeet to :fidereal and elemen-
tary influx, with · his undedbnding darkened., and his mental faculties
abridged; which I have exhibited by the four figures in the annexed
Plate. The ·firft reprefents the primeval ftate of man, with his hand
lifted up to his bead, deu()ting the feat of compr('henfive fenfibility, to
which the light of reafon and fenfe flowed from the mirror of the Deity,
in whofe image he was formed. The fecond figure thows the elemen-
. tary and ·afirai inftuen:ce in the ·primeval frate of man·
, as having no a8ion
'Whatever internaJiy, but faJiing on his exterior or back parts; wbiHl: his
faee,.turned· to the light, received the beatific vifion of immortality and
r}ife from the gate 'of heaven. 'I!he third figure 1hows the internal action
ofthe elementary and planetary influx after the faJJ, upon the vital parts .
of man, whence difeafes and death follow in a direct and regular conrfe.
·For, as 'the aCtion of the ftars on man are agents, and the elemeuts of ·
which he is ·compofed patients, the (arne as in the outward world; fo we ·
find, as 'they are fituated in the outward world at the time of birth, either
as to·thength or imbecility, fo thall be the inward weaknefs or vigour of
t&e vital pa..ts of ·matl born under them ; and of 'fu·ch ,flmll be the inbred .
quality'Offhe difeafe thus implanted in our fallen nature 'to bring on cor-
ruptibility and dea.th. The fourth figure. is intended to thow a faint re-
femblance of an -abandoned and more degenerated fiate of fallen human
nature, when the will and p~ffions of man are given up to vice~ and con-.
laminated <with 'the grofs or beftial quality of deadly .fin and wickednefs•.
He is Jed captive by an evil fpirit, the agent -of Lucifer, having his will .
darkened, and every fpark of light extinguiihed, that could ,flow from :the -
intelleCtual faculties of the foul, or from the collifion of:virtue and fenfe.

1062 AN ILLUSTRATION
To illufirate this extraordinary praaice of the ancients, I iliall here
confider the nature of the World of Spirits, their quality and office, and
the affinity which they bear to this world, agreeably to the dotlrines laid
down by thofe ancient authors whofe works are now rarely to be
ieeu, though fanClioned by the moll: remarkable experiments, ·and
confirmed by the ftrongeft evidence that can be coUetlcd at fo dillant
a period.
The noble and learned Swedenborg, whofe nat1v1ty we have confi-
dered in the foregoing part of this work, .bas with great ingenuity
explained the nature and fituation of the d~partcd fpirits of men, after
their recefs from this life. " The world of fpirits,'' fays this author, "is
neither heaven nor hell, but aplace ·or ftate betwixt both, into which
man immediately enters after ·death ; and, after fraying there a certain
tim~ longer or fhorter., according to what his pafi life had been in this
world, he is either recei-ved up into heaven, or call: down into bell. It
mufi be noted here, that this intermediate ftate has nothing in it of the
probatiouary .kind; for that is all over with the life of this world; but
.is a fiate ·of feparation, or reducing every one to his own proper pre-
;vailing principle, and as fuch finally preparatory for an eternal happinefs
or miiery. ·
''"' In the world of fpirits·is al\Vays a very great number of them, as be-
.ing the firfi fort of all, in order to their examination and preparation;
but there is no fixed time for their fray; for fome are tranflated to
heaven, and others configned to hell, foon after their arrival; whilft fome
continue there for weeks, and others for feveral years, though none more
than thirty, this depending on the correfpondence or non-correfpondeuce
between the interior and exterior of men. As foon as they arrive in
the world of fpirits, they are claffed according to their feveral qualities,
~nclinations, and difpofitions: the ~vi)~ with fuch infernal focietiea as
they had communication with in this world, in the ruling paffion ;-and
the good, with fuch h&avenly focieties as they had communicated witb,
in love, charity, and faith. But, however they are diverfely claffed,
·they all meet and converfe together in that world, when they have a de-
lire fo to do, who have been friends and acquaintances in this life; more
efpecially hufuands and wives, brothers and 1ifiers, &c. But if they are,
according to their different ·ways of life, of different inclinations and
habits of min~ they are foon parted.; and it may be obferved, both con-
cerning thofe who finally go to heaven, and thofe that go to hell, that,
after their arrival in thofe two different kingdoms, they 110 more fee or
.koow one another, unlefs they are of like minds and affeCtions. The

cient to ferve them to think, reafon, and talk of beavenl:Y things; but
the gate of.heaven ·fiands open in thofe who are good and in truth. There
arc alfo two waY.s leading to the.ratioual mind in man ; the fuperior or
internal, by which .good and truth are communicated from the Lord; and
the inferior or external way, by which evil and falfehood are communi- .
cated from hell: and the rational mind is in the midtl of thefe two ways;
hence it is, that as much of the heavenly light as any man .recciveth. into
his mind, fo far is be truly rational ; and fo much as be admits not of it,_
in fuch proportion he is not rational,· however he may think himfelf fo..
Thefe things here offered, 1how the correfpondence that fubfifts between
man and heaven and hell; for his rational mind, during the formation
of it, correfpoods .to the world of fpirits, things above .it·being in heaven,.
and things beneath it in:hell; the former are opened,. and the latter (as
to all iuftux of evil and the falfe) are 1hut, with refpeel: to thofe who
are in their preparation for heaven ; but; on the other· hand, the things
from beneath are opened, and the things abpve are thut (as to all.influx
ofgood and truth) with refpect to thofe who are in their preparatioa for
hell ; confequently the latter can only look down to the things beneath.
them, or to hell, and the former only to things above them, or to heaven.
Now to look up.is :.by·.correfpondenc:e, to l90k to the .Lord; who is the
common centre to which all heavenly things point their·afpea and, ten-.
dency; but to look downwards is to turn from the· Lord to ~he- oppofJte.
centre of attraClion,.and confequently to all thiBgs. of a heUith nature.
" Thefe con6derations are applied only to the.immediate after...ftate of:
the foul and fpirit of man., as the confequenc.e .of the· mortality of this.
world. Many there are, however, who entirely :ditbclieve the faculty of
the foul, or the exiftence of the fpirit; ·but whoever rightly confiders the.
matter, cannot but know, that it is not d~e· body, or material. part, but:
the foul, or fpiritual part, that thinks within him.... Now the foul is his.
fpirit, immortal in all its properties, and receptive of what is fpiritual,
as having a fpirituallife, which conftfts in thi~1king and willing.; conk-.
quently, the whole of the rational life appertains thereto, and Rot to.
tbe body, though manifefred therein: for the body .is only thougbtle1S.
matter, aad an adjunCt or infrrument to ·the fpirit of man, whereby
it may manifefr its vital powers and functions in this natural world;...
where all thin~ are material, and as fuch void of life; it is indeed cuf
..
tomary to afcnbe aCl:ion, motion, and power, to the body, in.the, com-
mon forms of fpeaking ; but to. fuppofe that the properties belong to the-
infirument, and not folcly to the principle that aCluates it, is erroneous
and abfur.d.. -

~·As all vital power, both of aCting a·nd t~!ll~lng, appertai~s folely to ._
the fpirit, and in no wife to the ~y, ·i~ fo.llows, that the fp1ri.t is truly
aiid p·roe_er!r~Jle man, ~nd that Without 1ts mfluence and operation there
is ne1tber tliought Dor hfe from the crown of the head to tbct fole of the

oot: confequently, that the feparation of the body from the fpirit,. ·
which we call death, takes nothing from that which in reality confii-
utes thct man. For man would not be capable of thinking and williog, ·
nlefs there were in him a fubfiance to ferve as the fubject of thefe opera-
tions; and to fuppofe otberwife would be afcr.ibing exifience to non-
entity, as may appear from man's not being able to fee without that organ
which is the fubjeCl ofvifion,. or to hear without the organ of hearing;.
thefe fenfes being nothing without fuch fubjeCls of their operations.
Now thought is iaternal vifion, or the fight of the .mind, as perception
is the internal bearing ; and thefe without internal organized fubfiances,
as their proper fubje&, cannot exift : fo that the fpirit of a. man has
equally a form, and that a human one, as alfo i,ts. fen{ory and fenfes, when.
divefted of its material body, as it had before;· for all the perceptive life
of tbe eye and the ear, and of every other fenfe that appertaius to man,
is not from his material body, but from his fpirit and the vital powers.
thereof, in all and fingular the· organs-.and parts of his body :. bene~ it is.
that {pirits fee, bear, and feel, as well as men,. in the fpiritual worJd,•
though not in this naturaL world. after their feparation from this mortal·
body. That ~e fpirit hac! natural fenfations in. this world, was owing
to its unio~ with a- natur.al or material body ; but then. alfo.it bad its.
fpiritual fenfes. in various modes of thinking and willing.''
The foregoing dOClrine is here ofFered to.coanr.ince the rational reader,.
that man, confidered in bimfelf, is a fpirit, and that the corporeal part of
his. compofition annexed to him in this natural and: material world is.·in
order.to his relation thereto, and what he bas to do therein,..but is not·
the man bimfelf, but only defigned to be inftrumental to the operations.
of bia fpirif: but. as few: are capable of rc:ceiving abtl!raa. reafonings,.

There is a very near communication and correfpondence betwixt the
fpirit and refpiration, and the motion of the heart (fyjlole), betwixt
thinking and refpiration, and betwixt the affection of love and the heart;
fo that, when thefe two motions ceafe in the body, a feparation prefently
enfues; for thefe two motions, viz. that which is refpiratory in the
lungs, and that which is called the fyfrole or contraCtile power of the
heart, are the two bonds of union, which when broken, the fpirit is
left to itfelf, and the ·body, being defiitute of life from the fpirit, be-
comes cold and putrifies. That fo intimate a communication fubfifis
between the human fpirit and refpiration, and t-he heart, is, becaufe all
the vital motions in this world depend thereon, not only.in common,
but alfoiin every particular part of the body.
The fpirit of a man remains fome little time in tho body after all figns
of life difappear, but not longer than till a total ceffation of aU power in
the heart enfues-, which varies according to the nature of the difeafe he
.dies of; for the motion of the heart continues long after in fome, but
not fo in others; but, as foon as the total ceffation of it happens:, the re-
fufcitation of man commences, and this by the fole power of the Lord.
By reftifcitation here is meant ·t·he liberation of the fpirit of a man from
his body, and the introduaion of it into the world of fpirits, and com-
monly called refurrecrion. That the fpirit of a man is not feparat~d
from his body before all motion and power in the heart entirely ceafes,
is becaufe the heart correfponds to the affection of love, which is the
very life of mau, for it is fi:~e. t~~~ every one: ~.eriv.e$. his vital h_
eat;
therefore, fo long as this conjunction lafis, fo long the correfpondence
continues, and it is from correfpondence that the fpirit aetuates and com-
municates life to the body.
That the form of the fpirit of a man is a human form, or, in other
words, that the fpirit is the true-formed man, may be evinced from many
arguments; particularly from thefe; viz. That every angel is in a perfect
human form ; that every mati is a fpirit as to his inner man ; and
that angels in heaven. are from the human race. T'his alfo more evidently
appears from man's being denominated man from his fpirit,.and not from
his body, and becaufe.the corporeal form is an adjunct to the fpirit aft~r
its form, amd not contrariwife, the former being but the dothing.of the
latter. Moreover, the fpirit is the fole moving power in man, a8ing
upon and a8uating every the moft minute. part·of the body, infomuch
that, when any part no longer derives vital influence therefrom, it pre-
fently dies. Now, the ruling powers, which govern·the body as·their fub-·
jeer, are the thought. and the will; but thefe are from the fpirit only,
nay conftitute its vety effence. The reafon why we do not fee any fc-

parate fpirir, nor yet that of another man whilfi in his body,. in its hu-
man form, with our prefent organs of fight, is becaufe thefe organs of vi-
fion are material, and therefore only capable of difcerning objeCts of a ma-
terial nature, whereas fpiritual things mull: be feen by a fpiritual eye ;•
but, when the corporeal fight is extinguifhed by the death of the body,
and the fpirit's eye is opened, then fpirits appear to one another in their
human form, not only in the fpiritual world, but they alfo fee the fpirits
___
_____ ___ __of thofe who yet live here in the body. ·
That a human form is proper to a human fpirit, follows from man's
being created in the form of heaven, and alfo receptive of all things of a
heavenly nature and order, confequently with the faculty of receiving
underfianding and wifdom; for, whether we exprefs it by the words," fa-
culty of receiving underfianding and wifdom,'' or " the faculty of receiving
heaven," it comes to one and the fame thing. So that wpat has hitherto
been faid on this iubjeCt, may be uuderftood by the rational man, from
his view of caufes and their effeCts, of premifes and their confequences;
but not fo by the obll:inately irrational. and that for many affiguable rea-
fans; but principally, becaufe he is averfe to all doCtrines which are con-
trary to the falfe principlc::s that he has adopted in the room of truths;
and he that has thus fhut up his mind hath fhut the gate of heaven
againft himfelf, fo that no light from thence can illuminate his rational
faculties ; and yet that gate might be opened, if his will did not refift.
This makes it evident, that they,. who are in falfe thinking from an evil
principle, might be poffdfed of a rational underll:anding, if they were in
a willing difpofition for it; and that the reafon why they are not fo, is
becaufe they love the falfe above the true, as more agreeing with the evil
they have adopted, and which they choofe to follow. It is to be obferved,
that to love and to will a thing is the fame; for, what a man wills he
loves, a_
nd what he loves he aHo wills.
When the fpirit of a man enters into the world of fpirits, which
is foon after his refufcitation, (of which mention has been made before,)
he as yet retains the fame face and voice that he had in this world, as be·
ing hitherto in his exterior fiate, that of his intedor being yet unmani-
fefred ; and this is his firft frate after death ; b.u_t (orne _ti~ after, b~
___fa_c.~- b~c.Q..mes_~lltirely changed, fo as to correfpond with the particular
affeCtion or love that poffeffed his fpirit when in the body; for the face
of a man's fptrit differs greatly from that of his body, the latter being
• It is to be noted here, that, when fpirits are feen by any one in the body, they are not feen with
the corporeal organs of vifion, but by the fpirit of the beholder abftraCI:edly from the body, though the
appearance is exaCtly the fame in both cafes, as implied in thofe words of the apoftle, where, fpeaking
of bis vifious, he fays, Wbtther in thelmiy or out ofthe b1d1, I tantUt tel/. 2 Cor. xii. z.

derived from his parents, but the·fonnet a correfpondent to his predo-
minant affection, of which it is the fignature or image, and which be-
comes appropriated to man.in the other world, upon the manifeftation of
his interior ftate; for the fpirit of a man, rightly confidered, is the fame
with his predominant affection or love, and his face is the external form
of it. This change refpectiug faces, in thok who pafs from hence into
the other world, is founded on this law, that no diffimulation or coun-
terfeiting is there allowed,.but all mufl: appear to be what they really are,
and·confequently exprefs their thoughts in their words, and their affec-
tions and defu·es in their looks and actions, fo that the, faces of all there
reprefeut their minds· refpectively. Hence .it is, ·that, though all who
know one another in this world are alike mutually acquainted in the world
of fpirits, yet it is otherwife in heav.J!n.and hell.
The faces of hypocrites .undergo not ·their proper change fo foon a~ the
faces of others, and that becaufe,they ;have by cuftom couttacted a habit
of forming·.their minds to a kind of imitation of good feotiment$ and af-
fections, and therefore they appear not uncomely for .fome time ; but, as
the difguife gradually :wears off, agd their inmqft. thoughts and affections
mauifeft tb.emfelves, ·they ap.pear more ugly than otluufl. · The hypocrites
here fpokeri of, are fuch 1
as know. bow to talk like angels upon divine
fubjects, and yet iri their .hcart!U!¥alt Nat~re on God's_throne, and diib~
lieve all heavenly truths acknowledged in the Chritlian·church.
It is to be obferved, that the.· human form of every man after death is
beautiful iu proportion to the love he had for divine truths, and a life ac-
cording to the fame, for by this fiandarcl things within receive their out-
ward manifefiation and form; fo that, the deeper grounded the affection for
what is good, the more conformable it is to the divine order in heaven,
and confequently the more beauty the face derives from its influx. Hence
it is, that. the angels of the third or inmoft heaven, whofe love is of the

from a fmaller degree of divine virtue within them, is comparatively dim;

man, and poffeffes every fenfe, both external and internal, that h~ poffeffed
before. Thus, for infiance, all in heaven have their light, their hearing,
and all their fenfes, in far greater perfe6tion than when in this world,
and alfo their minds more abundantly replete with wifdom: for they fee
by the light of heaven, which greatly exceeds that of this·world, and they
hear through the medium of a fpiritual atm~fphere, to which that of our
earth is not comparable. The comparative difference between thefe two
fenfes there and here·, is as that of a bright tky to a thick fog, or as the
rufire of the meridian fun to the dutk of the evening. Now the light of
heaven, which is the divine truth, makes man)feft the minu.teft things to
the perception of angels; and~ as their external correfponds to their inter-
nal or intelleCtual fight, fo by mutual influx they co-operate in forming
the high perfeClion of an-gelic ptrfpicuity. In like manner their fenfe of
h~aring correfponds to their .percep~ion, bot.h in the underfianding and
wtll; fo that, 111 the found of the vot~e, and ~:n the words of the fpeaker,
they can trace the minut-e partie-ulars of ·his. affettions. and thoughts; in
the found what Pelat-es .to his affeClions, and it.a the words what concerns
· hts mind· or thoughts ! bUt· it is to be obfer.ved, that the othel' fenfes of
the angels are not in the fame high degree oi perfection.with tbofe of
fight and hearing, and that becaufe the latter are fubferv.ient inftruments
to their underfianding and wifdom, and noc fo.the others, which, if equal
in power, would l~n· 'the-ir preference tO · intoll(tClUal delights over and
above thofe of their fpiritual bodies, as we find to be th~ cafe with men
in this world, who, according to their greater reliih and indulgence as to
their gtoirer fenfes, have the lefs appetite and fentibility with refpeCl to
fj>iritutd things. -
Jli:few words fhaU here be fpokeA concerning the· cultivation of t!ne ra-
tional faculry in man. Genuine rationality conf.ifts it~> truths, not in falfe-
hoods. Nbw truths are of three-kinds; civil, moral, and fpiritual. Civil
troths relate to judicial matteFs, and·f'llch a5 refpe8 public~governmenr,
and, in a general confideration, juftice and equirv : mol'a-1 truths have
relation to the conduct of Jife with refpe<fr ro focieties and inferior con-
netlions; in genera), to fincerity and ~etlitude; and: in particular, tQ
virtues of every clafs ; but fpiritual truths relate to• the things of heaven~
and'of the church on· ctarth; and in general to the good of Jove, and.the
truths of faith. There are three de~rees of li~ in every man:: the ~
tional part in man is op.ened to the firft degree by civil;truths ; to the fe~
cond hy mora) truths; and to the ·third by fpiritual ·rru~hs~ But let· it
here be obferved, that man's rational part is not opened and formed mere-
ly by his know.ing, fuch truths, but l>y living according to them when

know ll ; that- is, by loving them With a fpiritual affeCtion, or the affeCliOI)
of his fpirit, or, ·in ~~her · wordst by loving jufiice and equity as fuch,
ftncerit'y' and reClitlide of manners as fuch, and good and truth as fuch;
whereas, to love them only from external regards, is loving them for the
fake of felf, for one's own charaCter, honour, or profit; and therefore fuch
a love, as it terminates in felf, gives not a man any right to the charac-
ter of· rational, as (uch a one ufes truths as a lordly mafier ufes his fer-
varits, viz. for his pleafure or interefi : and \vhere this is the cafe, they
make no part of the man, nor open fo much as the firfi degre~ of life in
him, but only have a place in his memory, like other fcientific ide~
under amaterial form, where they unite with the love of felf in mere ani-
mal nature. Hence it may appear how man becomes tmly and.properly
rational, viz. iw the third or higheft degree, by the fpiritual love of
good·and truth, or the things of heaven, and its reprefentative the church;
iil the fecond degree, by 'the love- of fincerity atld rectitude; and in the
iirfi degree, by the -love of jufl:ice and equity; which two lall: loves be..
come fpiritual by influx of the fpiritual love of good and truth from.the
highefi degree, by joining itfelf to the inferior loves, and forming in them
its own .likenefs. Th~re are three degrees in man correfponding to the
three heavens ;·and,_ as the third or higheft heaven does, as it were, fanc-
tify the tw~ 'inferior heavens by the ·defcending influx·of its celefrial fu-
perior virtue, fothe fpidtuallove of all that is good and true in man (cor-
·refponding to the third heaven) fpiritualizes or fanClifies ·his virtues,
though of an inferior clafs; thus, to give a cup of cold water to another
is a little thing; but when it is the mofi we can do,. and love is in the
doing of it,'the aa has in it the effence of Chrifiian chari~y. Matth. X. 42·

walking in the fear of God, and in the· love.·of divine..truths, applying
the fame to praClical ufe, feem to themfelves as men awaked out offleep,
and as having paff'ed from darknefs to light, when they firft entei· upon
their fecond or interior ftate; for they think upon the light of pure wif-
dom, and they do all things from the love of goodoefs; heaven influ-
ences their thoughts and affeClions, and they are in communication with
angels. But the condition of the evil in this ftate is according to his par-
ticular concupifcence. They who had be~n abforbed in felf-love~ fo as
not to attend to the good ufes of their refpeClive offices and funCtions, but
difcharged them only with a view to their own eftimation and honour,
appear more ftupid than others; for, in proportion to th~ degree of fe)f...
love. in any one is his diftance from heaven, aud confequently from wifdom;
but they,. who to the evil of felf-love had added crafty devices; and by
means thereof advanced themfelves to worldly honours, aff'Qciate: them-.
felves to the worft of fpirits, ahd addiCt themfelv.es to tbe. .magical

they moleft and vex all that pay them not honour. Th.e· pr:aetifing of
infidious wiles, and to kindle ftrife and hatred; yield theQ'l the highefr.

tyrannife over all that fubmit not to their will; and all :the(e wicked paf-.
fions they gratify as far as their evil aff'ociates give them affifiance; nay,
fo far does madnefs hurry tllem on, as to make them wilh·to fcale heaven,
either to fubvert the government of the holy kingdom, or to caufe them-.
felves to be worlhipped for gods therein. As to thofe who in this w.orld:
afcribed all creation to nature, and fo in effeCt denied a God, and confe-,
quently all divine truths, fuch herd together in this ftate,. calling every ·
one a god who excelled. in fubtlety of reafouing, and·giving him. divine~
honour. Such in the wodd of fpir.its are feen in their conveuticJe wor-:
thipping a magician, holding conferences concerning nature,. and be-,
having more like brute beafl:s than human creatures ; and among them
fome who were dignitaries in this world, and had the reputation of being·
learned and wife, and others of a different charaCter. From this. much·
we may gather what they are, the interior of whofe minds is. thut againft
divine things, as theirs. is, who receive no. influx from.heaven through:
looking up to God and a life of faith•.
The third fiate of man, or of his fpirit-, after death, is the ftate of in-.
ftruClion, which is appointed for thofe that go to heaven, and become ·
angels; but not for: thok: that go tp hell, as fuch are not in a capacity of::

which operates, according to the heat and cold therein, on the fubjelti of
the vegetable kingdom; for, that light and darknefs have no fuch operation
in themfelves alone, but only through the beat in them, may appear from
the fimilarity there is betwixt the light and darknefs in winter and in
fpring. The comparifon of truth and falfehood with light and darknefs
is from correfpondency ; for truth correfponds to light, and falfehood to
darknefs, and heat to the good of Jove. Spiritual light alfo is the fame
with truth ; and fpiritual darknefs is the fame with falfehood.
There is a perpetual equilibrium betwixt heaven and heJl; from the
latter continually exhales and afcends a couatus of doing evil; and from
the former continually emanes and defcends a conatus (te[ldency to or
will) of doing good. In this equilibrium is the world o( fpirits, which
is fituated in the midft betwixt heaven and heH ; and this may appear
from hence, that every mau immediately after death enters into the world
of fpirits, and there continues in the fame ftate in which he died; is ex-
amined and proved thereby, as a toucbftone of his principles; and re..
mains under the fame free will, which all indicate an equilibrium ; for,
fuch a fpiritual equilibrium there is in every man and fpirit, as obferved
before. The particular kind and tendency of this liberty or free will is
well known by the angels in heaven, by the communication of tbo\lghts
and affections; and it appears vifibly to the evangelical fpirits, by the·
paths and ways which they choofe to walk in, as the good fpirits take
thofe which lead to heaven, and the evil fpirits thofe which lead to hell;
for fuch ways and walks have actually a vifible appearance in that world;
and this is the reafon that the word way or Wtl!JS in Sc,ripture figni6es
t.hofe truths which lead to good, and, in an oppofite fenfe, thofe faJfe-
hoods whi~h lead to evil; and hence alfo it is, that "to go, walk, or jour-
ney," ftgnify the progreffions of life in the fame facred writings.
That evil continually inhales anf] afcend.; from hell, and that good con-
tinually flows and dc:fcendg from heaven, is bec~ufe every one is furrouftti-
ed by a fpiritual fphere, flowing or tranfpiring from .his vital affections.
and thoughts, and con{equeutly the fame from every fociety celellial or
it)fernal, and collectively from the whole heaven and the whole hell.
This univerfal effiux of good from heaven originates in the Lord, .and;
paffes through the angels without any mixture of their property or felf-
hood; for this is fuppreffed in them by the Lord, who grants them
to live i~1 his own divine property; whereas the infernal fpirit!l. are in ·thcjr
property of fel6lh nature, or what only belongs to themfeJves:, ·'Vhich, as.
unble{fed. with divine communications from the fole fount~in qf.all good,

What has been delivered concerning heaven, the world of fpirits, and
bell, will appear obfcure to thofe who have no relith for fpiritual truths,
but clear to fuch as take delight therein, more efpecialty to all who are
in the love of truth for its own fake. \..Vhat we love, we readily receive
and underfiand; and, where truth is the objeB: of our affeCtions, it re-
commends itfelf to the mind by the evidence it brings with it; for truth
i~ the light, by which all things are kt:own and difiinguithed.
Such are the doCtrines of Baron Emanuel Swedenborg, with refpeCt to
the fpirits and departed fouls of men. But tht: Magi, or wife mt!n of the
Eafi, have defined fpi.rits, good and bad, of a great variety of kinds and
orders, whereof fome are fuited to the purpofes of witchcraft and exor-
cifm, and others not. The form and i1ature of fpirits., fay they, are to
be confidered according to the fource to which each caterva doth belong;
for fome, being altogether of a divine and celefiial nature, are not fuQjecl
to the abominable conjurations and enchantments of vicious men; whiUl
others, of a diabolical and infernal nature, are not only ready upon all
occafions to become fubfervient to exorcifis and magicians, but are ever
watching opportunities of exciting evil affc:B:ions in the mind, and of fiir-
ring up the wickedly-inclined to the commim.:>n of every fpecies of ini-
quity and vice. As to the thapes and various likenelfes of thele wicked
fpirits or devils, it is generally b~lieved, that, according .to their different
capacities in wickedneis, fo their thapes are anfwe.rable after a magical
manner, refembling fpiritually fome horrid and ugly monfters, as their
confpiracies againfi the power of God were high and monfirous when
they fdl from heaven. For the condition of fome of them is nothing
but continual horror and defpair, wbiHl: others triumph in fiery might
and pomp, attempting to pluck the Almighty from his throne; but the
quality of heaven is Chut from them, and they can never reach it, which
a8s upon them as an eternal iource of torment and mifery. But th~t
they are materially vexed and fcorched in flames of fire, is only a figura-
tive idea, adapted to our external fenfe, and by no means to be literally
underfiood; for their fubfiance is fp.iritual, anJ thejr effence too fubtile
for any external torment. Their mifery is ur.quefiiouably great and in-
finite; but not through the e.ffetl of outward flames; for their bodies
are capable of piercing through wood and iron, fi:oue and all terrefirial
things. Neither is a11 the nre or fuel of this world able to torment
them; for in a moment they can pierce it throHgh and through. The
eodlets fource of their mifery is in themfelves, and fiands continually
hefore them, fo that they can never enjoy any refr, being abfent from
the prefence of God; which torment is greater to them than all the tor-
tures of this world combined together. ·

AN ILLUSTRATION
The wicked fouls. that are departed this life, are alfo capable of ap-
pearin~ again, and of anfwering the conjurations and magical quellion' of
exorcitts, becaufe the quality of their minds, and the bent of tl~eir incli-
nation.-, being fimilar to thofe of the fallen angels or devils, it cannot be
con~eived that their torment and purfuits hereafte·r. ar.e much different;
for the Scripture faith, that every one is retvardfd according to his works;
and; that which a man fows, that hefoal/ reap. Hence it follows, that, as
the damned fpirits of departed men, while they lived on earth, heaped up
vanity, and loaded their fouls with it1iquity aud vice; fo, when they en-
ter the next world, the fame abominations which here they commatted
ferve them to ruminate and feed upon, and, the greater thefe offences have
been, the greater is the torment arifing.from them e·very moment. But
very contrary to this is the ftate of the righteous fouls, departed, who
are entered into eternal rdl; and of the different degrees and orders
of the angelic hofi, which appertaiu 'to heaven, and have places in tbe
manfioilS of the bleffed. Nor is it poffil>le for any one, how expert {()_
ever in magical ·expe~iments, to compel thefe bleffed fpirit·s, of ahy de-
gree, order, or quality, of cre.ation, to be exorcifed, ·or called up, or made
apP.ear, at the •wr'/1 ofihe magician, by a~y (orms of convocat:on or com-
inuni~ation, or ~y the power of magical rites and ~eremoni~s of any clafs
or defcription whatfoever. It may indeed be believed, and it is by mofi:
authors admitted, that infinite numbers of the angelic hofi: are employed
for the glory of God, in watching over and protecting the puduits of
good men; but they are not fubject to fpells or conjurations of any kind
fet on foot by the impious profeffors of the Black Art.
O( a different opmton, however, are fome of tbofe who attempt to
jufiify the magic art under (auction of the holy Scriptur'e~, atid for this
purpofe iufiance the fupplication of Saul to the wit<:hof Endor. This
paffage un~oubtedly ferves to ihow how greatly the' practice of exorcitin
reigned amoi1gfl the Jews, ~nd proves the poffibility of railing up fpitits.
in tho_{~ at~cient. times; ·but that .the exorci£1:. never meant t? brin~ .·up
the fpmt orghofi: of Samuel,but that of an eval diemon to repref~nt tum,
is ·apparent from her exclamations to Saul, when ihe accufes him of hav-
ing deceived her; and is a convincing proof, that this particular infiance,
of the fimilitude o( a bldfed fpirit being called up by a profellor of fpells
and incantations,. was·.owing to the. immediate periniffion of the Deity~
for the purpofes of forwarding the Jew'i{h difpeufation, and manifell:ing
his pec!Jiiar regard to the perfcn of David·, through whofe loins the

provoke melancholy people to fuicide ; tempt drunkards and incendiaries
to fet houfes on fire, to burn thofe who are in them, and allure carelefs
fervants and others to found and incautious fleep, that fuch unlucky
accidents might happen ; befides innumerable other ways they have of
executing the devices of iniquitous fpirits through malicious inll:igations,
or fecret ftratagems, projetled for the overthrow and dell:ruaion of mortal
men; efpecially when the work to be e£fe8ed by the devil is too hard for
his fubtle and fpiritual nature to effea, becaufe the fame belongs to the..
outward fource or principle to which thefe dubious .fpirits more imme-
diately belong. For, being compounded of the fiery element, they are
moft officious in this kind- of fervice, being fuch as the antecedent mat•
ter hath fufficiently demonftrated ; h\lt according to their different ranks
and orders fome of them are much more inveterate and malicious in their
agency than the reft. Thefe, as well as every other kind of aftral fpirits,
are more or lefs obfequious to the kingdom of darknefs ; and the devit,
it feems, can effea little or nothing without their affill:ance in this out-·
ward or elementary world, upon the paffions of mankind ; becaufe their
bodies are too crude for the direa conveyance of their influence, either
in dreams, charms, vifions, raptures, or other foft and alluring means.
Thefe fiery fpirits are likewife apt for conjuration, and are always ready
at the call of the magician, for the execution of any cruel or diabolical
purpofe. ' . ·
Diftiua from fiery fpirits, are a fpecies which properly belong to the
metallic kingdom, abiding in mountains, caves, dens, deeps, hiatas or
chafms of the earth, hovering over hidden gold, tombs, vaults, and fe-
pultures of the dead. Thefe fpirits are termed by the ancient philofo-
phers " protetlors of hidden treafure," from a principle or quality. ~ll

• thofe places where money is concealed, and retaining malevolent and
poifonous influences to blaft the lives and limbs of thofe who attempt to
make fuch difcoveries ; and therefore extremely dangerous for magicians
to exorcife or call them up. It is recorded in feveral of the ancient Bri-
tith authors, that Peters, the celebrated magician of Devonthire, together
with his affociates, having exorcifed one of thefe malicious fpirits to con-
duct: them to a fubterranean vault, where i confiderable quantity oftreafure
was known to be hid, they had no fooner quitted the magic circle, than

upon record, of the fudden deftrudion of thofe.wh9 by magical fpells had
called up this defcription of fpirits, for the purpofe ofdifc,overing hidden
gold; which examplesfeem toprove,that thefe fpirits have moreaffinity with
the infernal than with the afiral hierarc,hy; and that they are.the diabo-
lical agents ofMammon, bringing about all the evils of this world, which
fpring from an .infatiable luft after gold; whence the faying in fcripture,
that We cannot ftrve God and Mammon; and that It is et!fterfor a camel
to pafs through the eye ofa needle, thanfor a rich man to enter into the king-
dom of heaven; hyperbolically fpoken, in reference to .the ·innumerable
fins and wickedneffes committed by mankind, for the fake of temporary
wealth and riches ! Hence too a reafons offers, why of all other fubordi-
nate fpirits, t~fe. are the moft pernicious to mortal men. The nature of
them is fo violent~: . t~t,. in the hiftories of the gold and filver mines
abroad, it is recorded that whole companies of labourers have been de-
ftroyed by them at once; and that their delight is in tormenting, kilJing,
·and cru1hing to death, thofe who moft greedily luft after and feek for fuch
treafures. The richeft and largeft filver-mine in Germany was haunted
by one of thefe fpirits, who fometimes ufed to appear in the 1hape of a
he-goat, with golden- horns, pu1h.ing down the workmen with uncommon
violence; and at others in the 1hape of a horfe, breathing fiery flames
and peftilential vapours at his nofirils, till by continual deftruCtion, fear,
and ~larm, !hey were oblig~d to defift from working that mine any longer;
and 1t contmues 1hut to th1s day.
Thus far we have confidered fpirits fubordinate, or fuch as properly
belong to the elementary or outward world. We will now take a view
of the infernal fpirits or devils, and damned fouls; which are to be
claffed according to their refpeClive ranks and ord~rs, exaCtly correfpon-
dent . or appofite to the choirs and hierarchies of the.angels, or bleffed
fpirits in heaven. . ·
The origin of devils and inferm!I fpirits, as Scripture-revelation hath
confirmed and eftabli1hed, proceeded. from confpiracy and rebellion in •
heaven, under the arch-fiend Lucifer, who was originally of ~be bigheft
order of the angelic hoft ; becaufe it is written of him, [, Cherubim
-e~t~ntus protegeus pofuite monte fanflo Dei; " Extended upon a Che-
rubim and proteCling, I have put thee in the holy mountain ofGod." And
further, becaufe it is alfo written, Quomodo enim tnane oriebaris, Luci-
fer; ".~or .then didft thou rife in the morning, 0 Lucifer." Various are
the o~mtons as to the cxprefs occafion of his fall. Some fay, it was for
fpeakmg thefe words: Ponemftdem meam in a'Juilone,jimilis ero Altilfimo;

The caufc of·the· paucity of .appearances of :evil fpirits ·in thefe day~
is the fulnefs of time, and the .brightnefs of Chrift&anity, difpelJing. the
mifts of herefy and idolatry, as the. S.un doth the fogs, which v•nifu on
its appearance; not by any violence or compulfion, but from a caufe im-
planted in the nature of things and their.oppofites. Even· fo ,the king-
~om of light, as it overfpreads the foul in power:and dominion; cl*a up
-the centre of darkuefs, .and fcattcrs :the .influences of .the devil before it,
who becomes as it were mtirely~paffivt ·as , to the works and \~illj;)f ID8Jl;
In ·the ·time of. the Iaw, when die.wrath and jealoufy of the :Father ;had
the dominion in the kingdom of 8ature,-.infernal fpirits :had :snore. eafy
accefs to mankind than they now haw; ,for; .before the it1carnatioo of
Chrifr, the anger of God.was unappeafc:d~ ailq bad·more dQmillioli over
the foul of man, which was then.at:grcatcr.diftance)from.,tbe:diV.ine good•
nefs; confequcntly the devils could. with mooe facility fpring up in'the.ielc+
.ment of wrath, and manifeft .themftJves in.this out~ard principie; becaufe
the very idea and bafis of hell is founded on the wrath of God,,wbich...is
the only channel by which the devil is conveyed into this world. So,
when the miracles of Chrift .began.to: manifeft themfel,ves itl the world,
tqe multiplicity of diabolical ·_appea-rances;. andn poffcfi"ed wid~ thle.'d~vit,
began infenfibly to ·decay and vanith.:·It is.true; that t~greateft inftaDCCS

of Mofes, and the wrath of God, were removed, there. wa~t a ·fenfible and
vifible decay of Satan's power in the world ; fo that,_ though it be pof-
fible, even in thefe days, by a renunciation of the Jalvation of Chriil,
and by becoming a difciple of the.devil, .to . bold e<m:efpondenc;e. with,

~retended fo to be, there is great ro~m to doubt the truth of fuch affer-
.t,ous,:though apparmtl!J _well·autbentJcated.
But, notwithftanding that the coming of Chrift has thus curtailed
·the power of the devil over all Chriftian countries, yet fuch nations a.s
have never embraced the Chr~ftian faith, but purfue the ancient fuperftition
and idolatry9 are ftill 'deluded and bewitched by him, becaufe the centre
of truth and light never having been awakened in them, the power of
Satan eafily: prevails to feduce them to worihip things vifible, infiead of
-the ·true God: for where mofi darknefs and fuperfiition is found, whe-
ther in r-eligion or perfonal underfianding, there his power is always moft
predominant. Thus it is now with the miferable inhabitants of the
greateft part of Afia, and the uncultivated and ferocious parts of Africa
aod America ; yet we have hopes that the goodnefs of providence, in his
own·fit and appointed ·feafon, will, through fome favourable channel,
communicate the light of the Gofpel to thofe miferable beings, whereby
the thocking idea of·feeding on human fleih, of devoting one another
'to·defiruaion and flavery, and of purfuing the infinuations and .works
of the devil, may be totally abolifued, and every part of the habitable
globe be united in the acknowledgement of one God, of one Saviour, and
-of~ne liberal, candid, and impartial, Chrifiian perfuafion.
As to the different thapes and forms of the devils, it is fuggefied by
.Scripture, and admitted by all writers upon the fubjea, that they were
anfwerable iu monfirofity and hideoufnefS to the fuperior rank they held
in heaven, and to the enormity of the offence which·was the caufe of their
.fall. Thus, in ·Revelation, Lucifer, as the leader and prime apofiate,. is
termed the great dragon, and king of the devils. And hence it is con-
-ceived, that thofe who belonged. to .the fupreme hierarchies in heaven,
and ·were the foremoft to rebel, were, immediately on their expulfion
from the realms of blifs, transformed from aiigels of fplendour and glory
to devils in the thape of dragons, crocodiles, ferpents, tigers, and the
like ; fo that the moft perverfe and potent among the devils poffefs the
moft ugly and frightful of the beftial thapes, but a thoufand times more
~errific and frightful than can poffibly be conceived from the moft fero-
cious of thofe auimals. In this confideration, however, there is a mate-
rial diftinaion to be made between the apofiate angels and the damned
fouls, which have deferted God in this world, and become iuhabitallts of
the infernal regions in the other. For the moft part, thefe unhappy crea-
tures retain the human 1hape, but with afpeas difmal and melancholy,
and expreffive of the unfpeakable torments they are doomed to fuffer; f<?"

and wickednefs they committed in this life is the fourceoftheir continual .
torment, w~ich gnaws and corrodesthem, rifing ·and boiling up con-
tinually in their minds, without reft or intermiffion. All the refri-
geration they have, is by intercourfe with the devils, when the height of
wickeduefs ftirs them up to blafphemies againft God, and towering up
above heaven and omnipotence in their adulterated and delu~d imagina..
t.ions, which, figurativdy fpeaking, ferves as fport and pafl:ime amonga:

fmalleft advantage, or the leafl: miti~tion of their torments ; for pain dif-
continued returns the gre~ter; neither would vexation be vexation, if
it had no refpite nor forbearance, that the contrary might be alfo manifeft,
nam co1Jtraria juxtafepojita majus elucefcunt. Yet is their torment exceed-
ingly different; fo that the fuffering of one in refpeet to that of another
is but a mere dream or pbantafy. I mean, amongfr the damned fouls,
and not the devils ; for the pain and torment of the devils,is .greater than

endure. Such fouls, iu whom the boiling fource of anger and revenge
hath had a dwelling or receptacle here, if they depart this life in their
fins, do likewife endure a moft dreadful kind of torment, which arifes
continually as a biting worm and hungry fire, to double and accumulate
an excefs of defpair upon them. Thofe alfo who reigned in pride and
oftentat~on upon earth, treading under foot the meek and humble in
heart, are tortured with the utmofl: reverfe of fheir defires, which are ever
uppermoft in 'their infatuated i(llaginations. They are ever feeking to
pull the Almighty from his throne, and towering up in the pride of their
hearts, hoping to gain tho kingdom of heaven to infult and boaft in~
But the quality of the beatific fource is utterly occult and efiranged from
them, fo that they can never find, tatle, hear, nor fee, it, though it be
wrapt round and round with their own peculiar fource and principle.
This adds eternally to their mifery, and rifes upon their fenfes with hor-
rible pangs and bitter gnawings, like the ·irkfome and vexatious pains
aud aches of man's body, only a thoufand times more acute and infupport-
able. The nature aHo of their habitation is fuch, that their puniih-
ment is ·exceedingly aggravated that way; becaufe the extremity of the
four elements is there converted into a whole principle of wrath aud tor-
ment. The excefs of oold and heat, drought and moifture, are alternately
raging amongfl: them by int.ercourfe ·; nor is there any light or luftre
within their courts, but that which is emitted from their tiery eyes, or
fiaming nofirils, as a deadly glance or glimmering, which ferves only to
render the mome-ntary fight of their miferable habitation ten rimes more
ditgufiing and intolerable. And, as every kind of being feeds upon fome-
thiog prOJ'tt' to his own nature or element, whether it be plant, animal,
or · metallic produ8oon, fo the devils are neither defiitute of meat nor
drink, . according to their owu king<lom and quatity, having fruits

like their own. And fo likewife thefe infernal fpirits, confidered in rc-
ipcet ofthe four elements, have a tone or language peculiar to themfelves,
which they exercife and fpeak one amongft another, ·as mortals do; but
they have utterly loft the dignity of their founds according to the eterual
nature, and are totally corrupted in their pronunciation or dialeCt, fiuce
they fell from their firft celeftial glory ; fo that their articulation is barth,
doleful, fierce, and terrible, like the fruits they feed upon, and place
they dwell in. This deprivation is very apparent in the kingdom of
this world, in the divided languages of every region, according to the coo-
ftellation under which they are fituated ; the true and magical language
of nature, notwithftanding the indufirious lexicographers, fiill rem~ining
hidden from the knowledge of every country in the habitable world.
Thus far I have endeavoured to illutlrate the caufes, natures, and pu-
uiihments, of infernal ft>irits; which, notwithftanding, is a fubjeCl fo
intricate and copious in itfelf, by reafon of the variety of their qualities
in the fource of darknefs, wherein they live, mov..e, eat, breathe, and
inhabit, having qualities, aCtions, and paffions, innumerable, and which
are to mankind almoft utterly unknown and incomprehenfible,-that
to attempt an ample demouftration of the matter, would require deeper
fpeculation than the {ubjetl deferves, or than I am mafter of; particu-
larly as the inhabitants of that gloomy kingdom are never in one regular
fiay, continuance, or property; but from one hour to another are conti-
nually floating and changing, like the fwiftnetS of the winds, or the gliding
along of running waters, which pafs away as a thought, and are no
more remembered. So it is with the devils and damned fp.irits in that
lachrymabJe ftate of darknefs, where their exiftence is a continual
anguiih and torment, thifting from the pangs of one forrow to the bit-.
ternefs of another, unto all eternity!
Now according to the fpirit of Chriftian Revelation, there hath been
always oppofed to the machinations of the devil and his imps upon earth.
who go about like ,·oaring lions feeling whom they may de-vour, a certain ··
defcriptiou of good and holy fpirits; whofe province it is to watch over

fon born into the world. Their office is principally that of forewarning
the perfons they attend of any imminent impending danger, fometimes
by inward inftin&, or by outward appearances; and fometimes by dreams
in the night. Thefe Genii change their quality and office as the per{on
or party change their's; if from good·we degenerate to evil, then by de-
grees the good genius is efirauged from us, and an evil demon naturally
fucceeds, according to that fympathy 'of things, wherein each draws af-
ter it that which is its ·like. There have been likewife defined, by the
learned doCtors and rabbis, who have written on this intricate fubjeCt:,
flven good Angels, who watch over and fuperintend the general affairs of
mankind, and who are ever ready to forward, by intelleCtual alfociation,.
mental inftigation, or thong noCturnal vifionary manifeftation, the gene-
ral profperity and fuccefs of all men's affairs who are goverued by the Jaws
of integrity and religion, and who are, by fome one or other of thefe
means, allured or prompted to fuch particular conduCl: or determination
as filall tend ultimately to their honour and preferment, to the good of
fociety, and to the glory of God and true religion, which is the grand
Qffice of thefe feven good fpirits to promote. And oppofed to thefe are
ft'1Jen roil Spirits, or Demont, proper to the infernal world, whofe office is.
to infufe evil into thofe men's minds who are naturally io addiCted, and
who never fail to join in affociation, though invifibly, with depraved
· perfons of ev~ry defcription, whofc paffions they inftuence, and whofe
defires they lead to the commiffion of all the abominations of this world.
The names of the feven good angels orfprits are, 1. Juhanladace, diftinguilh-
ed in the dominion of thrones, as the appointed guardian of all public and
national enterprifes, where the good offociety, and the honour ofGod, are
unitedly concerned. He is delineated in all the brightne{s of a celeftial
meifenger, bearing a flaming fword, ~irded about the loins, with an hel-
met on his head; and this is tbe mag1cal charaCl:er by which he is diftin-
guifiled, and which is worn by many, as a lamin round the neck, for a
prefervative againft putrid infection and fudden death.
The fecond is Pah-li-Pan, one of the celeRial powers whofe peculiar
office it is to guard and forewarn fuch as are virgins and uncontaminated
youth againfi all the evils of debauchery and proftitution ; and to elevate
the mind to a love of virtue, honour, and revealed religion. He perfoni-
fies the charatler of an illufuious ang~l, o( a bright but moft compJa..

cent countenance; and is known by the following magical fymbol,
which is worn about the neck of virgins as a prote8ioB from all the af-
faults of evil demons, and it is faid to be infallible again£l: the powers of
fedutlion.
The third is Nal-gah, devoted to the proteCtion of thofe who are at:.
faulted by evil fprits or witches, and whofe minds are {uuk by fearful
and melancholy apprehenfions of the alfaults of the devil, and the power
of death. His proper office is to fortify the mind, and to lead the feufes
to a coutemplation of the attributes of God, and the joys of heaven, the
reward of all good works.. His appearance is reprefented as perfeCtly ce~
leil:ial, having a crown of gold upon his head, with a fhield and {pear in
his hands, for the proteCtion of thofe over whom he prefides. The fol-
lowing is his magical charaCter, which is worn round the neck as a pre-
1ervation againil: witchcraft and fuicide.
The fomth is Maynom, one of the powers \l ho hnfh the ability of fubfer-
vieut adminiil:ration atld proteCtion; that is, at one and the fame time to
be prefent with many. His prefence muil: be fought by humility and
prayer. The fifth good Genius is Gaonim, an angel of celeftial brightnefs., .
who hath the peculiar ability of rendering his pupil invifible to any -evil
fpirits whatfoever, as often as attacked by them. The fixth is Halanu.,
the guardian and promoter of all good and great ideas, by whom Bezeliah
ancJ Aholiab were divinely infpired for the il:rueture of the tabernacle.
The fev~nth is Ramah-umi, the genius of geometrical proportion, and the
power of numbers ; the fecrets and extent of which are not yet half
known, even to the s:noft favou.red of thofe whofe capacities are enlight-
ened by his fuperior aid. '- · · ·
Now the office of the feven evil demons or {pirits is to coouteraa ·and
deftroy the effeCl of the good; for, as ·the power and capacity of the
good proceeds from tbe omnipotence of God in tbe quality of heaven, fo
is tbe force of the evil Gmii, ir) the infernal quality, made oorn:fpondent
thereto, from a principle of contraries ; for it is to be noted that thefe
.feYen roil angels, before their falJ, enjoyed the fame places and degrees of
~lory, that now belong to the feven _good angels or Genii; fo that, as

their office_ is to iriftrua and ·auure mankind to the purfuit of every thing
that is good, great, virtuous, and honourable, it is the bufinefs of the
others to tempt and feduce the mind to a purfuit of whatever is vile,
vicious, and abominable, and that may be infirumental in extending the
kingdom of darkne{s and the power of the devil. The names of thefe
feven evil fpirits or Genii fiand upon record as follow: 1. Pana!carp, io
the likenefs of a crocodile with two heads. 2. Baratron, appearing like
a magician in a folemn priefi:Jy habit. 3· Sondennah, in the caparifon and
fimiJitude of an Indian huntfman. 4· Greit.modal, in the fawning fhape
of a large fpaniel d(>g. S· Ballifargon, in 'the fimilitude of a covetous
mifer, tufting after gold; be is the grand enticer to thieving and robbery,
and ufually brings his followers to an ignominious and deftruClive end. 6.
Mor/Jorgran, who, under various likeneffes of a friendly ferving-man; in-
duces the worft examples of hypocrify and deceit. This dremon, it is
faid, was the conftant attendant of Judas lfcariot. The 7th is Barman,
ready to enter into league with any conjurer, witch, or wizard; but who
moll: commonly poffdfes the foul of whomfoever he is in league with.
Thefe good and evil fpirits, it feems, are the moft eafy to be invoked or
called up, agreeably to the defires and tituation of the magician's mind
and inclination, becaufe they are moll: near and familiar to the aClions
and purfuits of men, and officially attendant upon them.
Different from every fpecies of all the foregoing orders of fpirits, are
the ghofts and apparitions of deceafed.perfons, which have been known
for many years to furvive and continue; particularly where the deceafed
perfon hath departed this life in difcoutent, melancholy, or unquiet mind;
for in thefe cafes they have beeu often known to return again, and, with-
out a defire of cau6ng terror and alarm to boufes and families, feek only
for an opportunity of difuurtbening themfelves, that at length they may
come into their defired reft. Such perfons as are fecretly murdered, or
that fccretly murder themfelves, are moft apt to appear again, wandering
near the place where the cataftrophe happened, till the radical moifture
of the body be totaJJy confumed. After which, according to the opini~n
of Parace)fus, and many other learned writers, they can appear no more,
but are refolved into their firft being or ajlum, after a certain term of
years, when the humidum radicale becomes exficcate and dried up, accord..
ing to the vigour or force of that firft attraClion,· which was the only
caufe of their returning. And hence was derived the cull:om of urns and
funeral piles amongft the Romans, who ufed to reduce the corpfes of their
deceafed friends to aihes, left their ghofts ihould return and wander;
which it was fujfpofed they could not do when the body was burnt, and
all moifture totally exterminated and confumed thereby,

But, to give a reafon why _apparitions are fo feldom feen, and why thofe
which do appear cannol without manfs affillance accomplilh their defign,
it may eafily be conceived, that all {pirits, Qr fpiritual {ubllances, of wnat

AN ILL'UST ·R ·A.TIO· N
aU ages of the world, in all countries, and in the facred as well as the
profane hillory, of the various appearances of ghofts and apparitions of
departed men, as well as of fpirits of ·other kinds and properties, afford
a fironger iu'ducement to our belief of their exiftence and agency in
this fublunary world, than we thould, in this more learned ·and enlight-
ened age, be otherwife willing to admit as an article of our belief.
But, feeing thcfe things are abfolutely.fo, we will now give fome particu-
lars of the mode and manner in which magicians.and other profelfors of
the Black Art obtain an intercourfe with them; from which it will ap-
pear, that the Science of Aftrology is an art founded on philofophy a:nd
mathematical ·demonllration, and totally unconneCted with any agency
but what proceed,; from fecond caufes under God and Nature; whereas
....the other is a wicked confederation with evil fpirits, which ought to be
'difcouraged and fuppreffed by the utmoft exertions of the iron arm of'the
bw. ·
To the honour of the prefent century, we have had but·few infiances·
of perfons openly and publicly entering into compaCt with fpirits, or of
profeffing to refolve quellions in futurity by means of their agency; but,
prior to that cera, it was no uncommon thina; and thofe who had an op-
portunity of blending claffical learning and fcientific [peculation with it
were efieemed the moll elevated charaCters of their day, and were fre-
quently honoured with the proteCtion and confidence of princes and other
inen of rank an·d fortune. I !hall here mention a few of thofe charaaers
who were efieemed the mofi confiderable magicians of their time.
· Apollonius Tyanttls, iri the time of the Emperor Domitiim, from: the:
wonderful and miraculous things he did through the agency of fpirits~
added to the great appearance of fauCl:ity and fimplicity with which· his
exterior was endowed' by nature, occafioned all ranks of people to regard
him with a mixture of reverential awe and refpeCl:. Even the Chriftian~·
who lived within the circle of his fame, thought him fomething more
than human, and looked up to him with confidence and efieem. From
a variety of circumfiances, and accounts in different authors, it appears
that this fingular charaCter had not only the faculty of knowing what was
tranfaCliug at many hundred miles diftance, but had the means alfo of
being conveyed ~lmoft infiantaneoufly from one place to anQther, where
he · was feen, known, and converted with many of his acquaintance•.
It is alfo recorded of him, that, at the inftant the Emperor Domitian
was affaffinated at Rome~ he f}>oke of it in a public affembly at Ephefus,
and declared the mode and manner of his death; which, upon enquiry,
was found to happen at the precife moment of time he fpoke of it, 'and''
in the exaCl manner he had defcribed. See p. 40·

Do8or Dee was another very extraordinary charaCter of the fame clafs,
and a uative of this ifland. He was not only a famous magician, but a
great author, having written upwards of for-ty-eight different volumes,
the 6rft of which was publithed in I 594· A full account of his con-
verfation and intercourfe with fj>irits is now extant, written with his
own hand, and efieemed a very curious and fingular performance. His
company ami acquaintance were much fought by the Emperor Charles V.
and by Ferdinand his brother; and, during his travels over the conti-
nent, he had not on1y every refpect and attention paid him, but his com-
pany was courted by all the learned and religious people wherever he
went. He was certainly one of the moft learned men of the age in
which he lived; and had collected a library of upwards of 4000 volumes
of curious and valuable writings, mofily upon phyfical, theological, and
occult, fubjects, which he ha~ the misfortune to fee burnt by the fury of
a mob, who affailed his houfe, and confpired againft his life, under an
idea that by magical fpelfs and incantations he had altered the natural
courfe of the weather, and brought on fiorms, hurricanes, tempefis, and
continual rain, in order to ruin the harveft; and deftroy the fruits of the
earth. Yet he bore the torrent and fury of this infatuated multitude with
the greatefi compofure, faying, "They would fee their error foon enough
to treat him with greater kindnefs hereafter, than their perfecution was
now cruel." A11d fo it happened; for, having by means of his confeder-
acy with fpirits, foretold and detected a fatal confpiracy againfi his country,
he was then as much hououred and careffed as be had before been fiig..;.
matized and abufed by the bafiy multitude. He wrote the mathematical
preface to Euclid's Elements, and has left tables of the harmouy and ex-
tent of numbers infinitely beyond the capacity-of the prefent times, though
fo much more learned and refined.
Edward Kelly was alfo a famous magician, and the companion and
atfociate of Dr. Dee in mofi of his magical operations and exploits ;
having been brought in unifon with him (as the doCtor himfelf declares,
in the preface to his work upon the minifiratiotl' of fpirits) by mediation
of the angel Uriel. But Dr. Dee was undoubtedly deceived in his opi-
uion, that the fpirits which minifiered to him were executing the divine
will, and were the meffengers and fervants of the Deity. Throughout
his writings on the fubjeel, be evidently confiders them in this light, which
is fi:ill more indifputably confirmed by the piety and devotion invariably
obferved at all times whe~1 thefe fpirits had intercourfe with him. And
further, when he found his coadjutor Kelly was degener-ating into t}le
lowetl: and worfi fpecies of the magic art, for the purpofes of fraud
and avaricious gain, he broke off all manner of coonexion with him, and

would -ne\rer after -be feen in his company. But it .is·believed, tbat·the
doCtor, a little before ,his death, became feulible that he had beet~ jm-
pofed upon by thefe invifible agents, and that all their pretences of aCling
under the aufpices of the angel UricI, and for tbe honour and glory.:of
God, were but mere hypocrify, and the delufions. of the devil. Kelly,
being thus rejeCted and difcountenanced by the doCtor, betook himfdf .to
the meanefi and moft vile praCtices of the magic-art ; in all which pur.-
fuits money, and the works of the devil; appear to have·been his chief
aim. Many wicked and abominable tranfaetions·are recorded of bi.o,
which were performed by witchcraft, .and the mediation of .infernal fpi-
rits ;, but nothing more curious, or more apropos to the prefetU fqbjea,
than what is mentioned· by·Weaver, in ·hi~ F1.meral Monuments. - He
there records, that Edward Kelly the·magician, with ·one Paul .Waring,
who aCted in capacity of companion and aCfociate in all his. conjur~tions,
went together to the church-yard of Walton Ledale, in the county of
Lancafier, where they had information of a perfon being interred,: w.ho
was fuppofed to have hidden or buried a confiderable fum ·of money, and
to have died without difclofing to any perfon where it was depofued.
They entered the :church-yard exatlly at twelve o'clock at night; aQd
having had the grave pointed·out to them the preceding day, they exor-
cifed. the fpirit of the deceafed hy magical fpells and incantations, ·till it
appeared before them, and not only fatisfied their wicked defires, and en-
quiries, but delivered feveral firange prediCtions concerning· perfons ··in
that neighbourhood, which were litually and exaCtly fulfil-led. It was
vulgarly reported of Kelly. that he outlived the time of his compa&.·with
the devil, and:was feized at midnight by fome infernal fpirits, who..e•r-
ried him off in fight of his own wife and childrcd, at the inianl·he w.as
meditating a mifchievous fcheme againfi: tbe ·mtnificr·of-his--pariO:l; ·with

Magicians and conjurors who have written upon and followed the Black
Art. contend, that it is pofliblcHo raife up and .bold an iutercourfe with
fpirits, aud make ·them fubfervient to their commands, without any abfo-
lute c:ompaa or bargain .with· .tbe devil, either for body, foul, or works;
though they are ready to admit, that fuch a fi1are is· eventually intended
for them, by their officioufi1efs upon every occafion, and they are as
williug to believe that it bas induced many of its praClitioners to form
fucb a league. Mauy inftancca indeed have been adducc:d in proof of
this, where, at the expiration of a certain term, the devoted wretch bas
been carried off in the height of his fin and wickednefs, by fome of the
infernal meffengers. Such is recorded to have been the cafe with feveral
in this iilaud; fuch alfo wa~ the cafe with Lewis Gaufridi, a French prieft,.

the extent of his ambition, compacted with the devil for fourteen years.

centuries back overran this country, was at length publicly taken off in.
fire and ftam~, before the eyc:s of a vafr multitude, having covenanted for
bOdy, foul, and works. It is to be noted, that, where a compaa is formed,
the devil, or familiar fpirit, is ever at hand, and ready to obey the magi-
dan's will, without ceremony or trouble; but where no fuch league or
compaa exifts, and the magician is defirous of bringing up or conjJraining
lOme particular fi>irit or gholl to appear before him, there are many rites:
and·ceremonies to be performed. ln the ~rft place they are to fix upon
a fp(>t proper for fuch a purpofe; which muft be either in a fubterraneous
nult bung round with black, and lighted with a magical torch; or elfe
in·tbe centre of fome thick wood or defert, or upon fome extenfive unfre-
quented plain, where feveral roads meet ; or amidll the ruins of ancient
Caftles, abbeys, monafreries, &c. or amongft the rocks on the fea-thore;
in fome private detached church-yard, or any other folemn melancholy
place, between the: hours of twelve and one in the night, either when the
moon fuines.·very bright, or elfe when the elements are difiurbed with
ftorms of thunder, lightning, wind. and rain; for in thefe places, times,
and feafons, it is contended, that fpirits can with lefs difficulty manifeft
thcmfelves to mortal eyes, and continue vifible with the leaft pain, io. this
elemental exterual world.

After thefe forms of conjuration, and jufi: before appearances are ex-
pe8ed, the infernal fpirits make ftrange and frightful noifes; howlings,
crembliQgs, ftafhes, and moft dreadful ~rieks and yells, as foreruunen of

their prefently becoming vifible. Their firft appearance is generally in
the form of fierce and terrible lions or tigers, vomiting forth fire, and
roaring hideoufly about the circle; all which time the Exorcift muft not
fuffer any tremor or difmay; for in that cafe they will gain the afcen-
dency, and the confequences may touch his life. On the contrary, he
muft fummon up a filare of refolution, and continue .repeating all the
forms of conftritlion and confinement, until they are drawn nearer to the
influence of the triangle, when their forms will change to appearances lefs
ferocious and frightful, and become more fubmiffive and traCtable. When
·the forms of conjuration have in this manner been fufficiently repeated,
the fpirits forfake their befiial filapes, and endow the human form, ap-
pearing like naked men of gentle countenance and behaviour. Yet is the
magician to be warily on his guard that they deceive him not by fuch
mild .geftures ; for they are exceedingly fraudulent and deceitful in their
.dealings with thofe who confirain them to appear without compaCt; hav-
.iug nothing in view but to fuborn his mind, or accomplith his deftruc-
tion. But with fuch as they have entered into agreement with, they are
frequent and officious; yet they more or lefs require certain oblations,
which are frequently made to them, fuch as fumigations, odours, of-
ferings or facrifices of blood, fire, wine, ointments, incenfe, fruits, ex-
crements, herbs, gums, minerals, and other ingredients; by which, from
a magical caufe, they have more influence and authority <?Ver the de-
generated fouls of men, and can infinuate into their inmoft fource and
:affetlion, piercing even through their bones and marrow, till they bave
fo 'habituated them to their fervice, that it becomes their daily and (ole
-delight to accomplifil every villany and abomination which the malicious
and fubtle infiigations of Satan might purpofe to lead them to. So that
the Exorcift muft be greatly upon his guard; and, when he has com-
pleted the exorcifm, and made fuch enquiries as he wifhed to obtain from
the fpirit, he muft carefully difcharge him· by fome form or ceremony
like the following :
Btcauft thou haft diligently anfwtred my dtmands, a11d been t-eady to come
-11t my fi11 call; I do krt licenfe thtt to dtpart unto thy properplace, witno11t

'!'ithdraw with fJUiet andpeace; andpeact be continued betwixt tlzte a~Jd me,
m the name ofthe Father, Pon, and Holy Ghofl. Amen.
After this ceremony is finifiled, the fpirit will begin to depart, refum-
lng again the ihrieks and noifes, with ftaihes offire, fulphur, and fmoke,
whicli the magician is to endure with patience, until it is entirely gone oif,

and no figns whatever of fuch a procedure left. Then be may venture to
withdraw from the circle, repeating the Lord's Prayer; after which be
may take up the various utenfils, and, having defiroyed all traces of the
circle, may return in fafety to his proper home.
But if, infiead of infernal or familiar fpirits, the gboft or apparition of
a departed perfon is to be exorcifed, the procefs is. materially different.
The perfon being fixed ou, whofe apparition· is to be brought up, the
magician, with his affifi:ant, mufi repair to the church-yard or tomb
where the deceafeu was buried, exaaly at midnight; as the ceremony
can only be performed in the night, between the hours of twelve and
oue. The grave is firfi to be opened, or an aperture made, hJ which
accefs may be had to the naked body. The magician having defcribed
the circle, and holding a magic wand in his right hand, while his com-
panion or affifiant beareth a confecrated torch, he turns himfelf to all the
four winds, and, touching the dead body three times with the magical
wand, repeats as follows:
By the virtue if the holy refurret/ion, and she torments if the damned, I
conjure and exorcife thee, JPirit if N. deceafcd, to anfwer my liege demands,
being obedient unto theje facred ceremonies, on paitt if everlafling tormmt and
diflrefs. Then let him fay, Berald, Beroald, Balbin gab ga/;or aga/;a ,·
Arije, arije, I charge and command thee.
After which forms and ceremonies, the ghofr or apparition will become
vifible, and anfwer to any quefiions put to it by the Exorcift.
But if it be defired to put interrogatories to the fpirit of any corpfc that
hath hanged, drowned, or otherwife made away with, itfelf, the conjura-
tion muft be performed while the body hangs, or on the fpot where it is
firft found after the fuicide hath been committed, and before it is touched
or removed by the coroner's jury. The ceremony is as follows : The
Exorcift binds upon the top of his wand a bundle of St. John's wort-, or
miiiteJ perforatum, with the head of an owl; and having repaired to the
fpot where the corpfe lies, at twelve o'clock at night, he dr~ws the eire!~.
and folcmnly repeats the following words:
By the myfteries iftlze deep, by theflames ifBanal, hy thepower oftlu ~

ins the carcafe nine times with the rod, fays, I conjure tlue, thou fpirit of
thu N. deceafed. to anfwer my demand; that I am to propound unto. ther,
as thou ever hoptjl for the rejl of the holy ones, and eafe of all tlry miftry : •
by the blood ofJefu which he Jhed for thy foul, I conjure and bind thet! to
utter unto me what I foal/ afk thee. .
Then, cutting down the carcafe from the tree, they lay his head to:.
wards the eafi; and in the fpace that this following conjuration is _repeat-
ing, they fet achaffing-dilh of fire at his right hand, into which they pour
a little wine, fome maLlie, and gum aromatic, anp lafily a vial full of the
fweetefi oil, having alfo a pair of bellows, and fome unkindled charcoal
to make the fire burn bright at the infiant of the careafe's riling. The
conjuration is thus : ·
I conjure thee, thou .fpirit of.N. that ·thou do immediately enter into thy
ancient body again, and anfwer to my demands, bg virtue of the holg refur-
reEJion, and by the poflure of the body of the Saviour of the ·world, I charge
thee, I conjure thee, I commantf thee on paitJ of the torments and wandering
ofthrice feven ,years, which I, by theforce offacred magic rites, have power
to injliEJ upon tlice; b-!J thyjighs andgroans, I conjure thee to utlt'r thy voice;
fo help thee God and the pray~rs of the holy church. Ameu.
Which ceremouy being thrice· repeated, while the fire is burning with
maLlie and gum aromatic, the ·body will begin to rife, and at lafl will
fiand uprigqt before the Exorcift, anfwering, with a faint and ho1Jow
voice, the quefiions propounded ·unto it : Why it defiroyed itfelf, where
its dwelling is, what its food and life.are, how long it will be ere it enter
iuto refi, and by what means the magician may affifi it to come to refi:
Alfo, of the treafures of this world, where they are hid: Moreover, it can
anfwer very punttually of the places where ghofis refide, and how to com-
municate with them; teaching the nature of aftral fpirits and hellilh be-
ings, fo far ·~sits capacity reacheth. All which when the ghoft hath fully
anfwered, the magician ought, out of commiferation and reverence to
the deceafed, to ufe what means can poffibly be ufed for the procuring
refi unto the fpirit. , To which effeCt he muft dig a grave, and filling the
fame half full of quick-lime, and a little fait and common fulphur, put
the carcafe naked into it; which experiment, next to the burning of
the body into aihes, is of great force to quiet and end the difiurbance of
the aftral fpirit.
·But in this,. and ·in all cafes where the ghofis or apparitions of deceafed
perfons are.ra1fed up and confulted, great caution is to be obferved by the

magician to keep clofe within the circle; for if the magician, by the
confiellation and pofition of the fiars at his nativity, be in the predica-
ment of thofe who follow the Black Art for iniquitous purpofes, and are
fo difiinguithed by the pofitions of their radical figure of birth, it is very
dangerous for fuch men to conjure any fpirits without de{cribing the
circle after the form already given, and wearing upon their breafi, or hold-
ing in their hand, the Pentacle of Solomon. For the ghofts of men de-
ceafcd can eafily effeCt fuddeu death to the magician born under fuch a
conformation of the planets, even whilft in the act of be.ing exorcifed;
and,it is yet more remarkable, that the genethJiacal figures of all perfons
who are naturally addiCted to the purfuit of magical incantations and fami-
liarity with fpirits, do almoft without exception porteud fudden death, or
an infamous termination of their exiftence.
Such are the rites, ceremonies, and modes, by which Exorcifis and
Magicians obtain familiarity with fpirits, and carry on a vifible and pal-
pable correfpondence with the devil. But, befides thefe means of work-
ing wonders, they have others, of an invifible or occult property, as
charms, fpells, periapts, and the like, which operate both on the body
and mi1~d, by the agency of fome fecret power which the patient can
neither feel nor comprehend. They are of various names, forms, and
qualities, according to the ufe for which they are intended. Firft, Amu-
lets, which are moulded and engraved in the form of money or coin, un-
der certain forms of coufecration ; and are hung about the neck in cer-
tain planetary hours, for the purpofe of provoking to love and familiarity
with fome certain perfon defired~ Secondly, Spells or Charms, confifting
of various forms of words, and magical characters, written on virgin
parchment, either with human blood, or ink of a particular quality, and
confecrated under certain magical forms and ceremonies, to be worn ac;
Periapts to cure difeafes, to drive away evil fpirits, to preferve from pef~
tilence and infeCtion, to make the party valiant and intrepid, an·d for a
thoufand other purpofes. Thirdly, Corfelets, which are the ancient
Danijll charm, being a kind· of necklaces compofed of thunder-ftones,
\lpon which are engraven certain magical charaaers, which refift all
noxious influences, and all danger from thunder and lightning. Pentacles
are a fo~rth fort of appendix, whi~h conjurors and ma9icians ufe, bei_ng
made With five corners, correfpondmg to the five fentes of man, wtth
their virtue and operation infcribed upon the five corners refpeaively.
They are compofed of fine linen doubled up, and done ·with cerecloth
between. This figure the magician holds in his band, lifting it up from
the fkirt of his garment, to which it is annexed, whenever fpirits that are
raifed become fiubborn and rebellious, refuting to conform to the. rites

and requifitions of exo~cifm, and oiferi~g menacing looks and aCtions to
the magician; but when thefe Pentacles are held out to the fpirits, with
the words 0/auron, Amor, Amorula, Beot·, Beorka, Beroald, Anepheraton,
infcribed upon them, they become exceedingly tortured and ama~ed, and
are more mild and tractable. There is likewife another fort of charm
called Telifms, which is ufed by magicians when they perform any con-
juration or exorcifm by moon-light in the mountains or valleys; upon
which occa{ions they ufually bury them towards the north, eafi, weft, and
fouth, within a hundred yards of the place where the circle is defcribed;
for thefe Telefms have the occult power of preventing any Jiving crea-
ture coming near them until the incantation be performed, except the
fpirit itfelf whofe prefence they ardently defire, and are preparing to fum·
mon before them.
But to make fiery and infernal fpirits more familiar, magicians have
claffed them into feven difiinCl orders, aufwerable to the nature and qua-
lities of the feven planets; under which thay refpetlively make offerings
to them of aromatic fumigations, previous to invoking or calling them
up; whereby they conceive the information or affiftance required from
them will be more eafily and expeditioufly obtained. Thus the "fumiga-
tions for fpirits under Saturn are made of frankincenfe-tree, pepper-wort
roots, fiorax, and gatbanum ; by thefe the fpirits Marbas, Corban, Stil-
kon, ldas, &c. and all of the firft order in the aftringency, are appeafed
and provoked, when the fumes are put upon a tripod in the hour of Sa-
turn according to the planetary divifion. },or fpirits under Jupiter, they
take lignum aloes, afiltree-keys, benjamin, fiorax, peacocks-feathers, and
lapis lazuli, mixiug the fame with the blood of a ftork, a fwallow, or a
hart ; the brains being alfo added ; the fumes are kindled in Jupiter's
hour, and in a place appropriate to his nature. They make fumigations
unto fuch {pirits of the order of powers as are under.Mars, in the plane-
tary divifion, with aromatic gum, bdellium, euphorbium, Joadftone, helle-
bore white and black, and an addition of fulpbur to make them into an
amalgama, with man's blood, and the blood of a black cat; which mix-
tures are faid to be fo exceeding magical, that, without any other addi-
tion, this fumigation is able of itfelf to make fpirits under Mars appear
before the Exorcift. To the fpirits under Sol, being of the order of
thrones, they likewife fuffumigate faifron, mu1k, laurel, cinnamon, am-
bergrife, cloves, myrrh, atld frankincenfe, mu$k, and the· balfamic tree,
mixed up together with the brains of an eagle and the blood of a white:
eock, being made· up like .pills, or little balls, and put upon the tripoci.
Tbe fumigations appropriate to {pirits under Venus, are rofes,. coral;
lignum aloes, and fpermaccti, made up with fparrows brains., and blood

of pigeons. To thofe under Mercury, they fumigate frankincenfe,.
mallie, cinquefoil, incorporated with the brains of a fox, and the blood of
a magpye. To 1pirits under Luna, fumigations are offered of fro(J's dried.
white poppy-feed, hull's eyes, camphire, and frankincenfe, inc~porated
with gooie's blood, and Jluxus mulicbris. Thefe are the divifions of fpirits
under the feven planets, with their fumigations; neither can it be denied.
but that in many ceremonies of this kind, there is great inherent virtue,
according to the doarine of iympathy and antipathy, whereby every
thing is drawn by its like in the idea, whether by words. or aaions, ac-
cording to the faying, In verbis, herbis, & lapididus, latet virlus; fo rh,t
the ceremonies and charms, with other circumftances ufed by magicians,
are.doubtlefs prevalent to the accompliihment of that work which they
undertake; to wit, The calling up and exorcifing of iufernal fpirits by
conjuralions.
And as by natural rcafon every magical charm or receipt had its firft
inftitution ; in like manner have magicians difpofed the matter and manner
together with the times of their utenfils and iuftruments according to the
principles of nature; as, the hour wherein they compofe their garments
mufi either be in the hour of Luna, or elfe of Saturn, in the Moon's iu-
creafe. Their garments they compofe of white linen, black cloth, black
cat-ikins, wolves, bears, or iwine's, ikins. The linen, becaufe of its ab-
firaCled quality for magic, delights not to have any utenfils that are put to
common ufes. The ikins of the aforefaid animals are by reafon of the
Saturnine and magical qualities in the particles of thefe beafts. Their
fewing-thread is of filk, cat's-gut, man's nerves, affes hair, thongs offk.ins
.from men, cats, bats, owls, and moles; all which are enjoined from the
like magical caufe. Their needles are made of hedge-hog prickles, or
bones of any of the above-mentioned animals ; their writing-pens are of
owls or ravens, their ink ofman's blood: their ointment is man's fat, blood~
ufi1ea, hog's greafe, or oil of whales. Their charaflers are ancient Hebrew
or Samaritau: their fpeecb is Hebrew or Latin. Their paper muft be of
the membranes of infants, which they call virgin parchment, or of the
fkins of cats, or kids. They compofe their fires of {weet wood, oil, or
rofin : and their candles of the fat or marrow of men or children : their
veffels are cartbern, their candlefticks with three feet, of dead mens bones:
Their fwords are fieel, without guards, the points being reverfed. Thefe
are their materials, which they particularly choofe from the magical qua-
lities whereof they are compofed. Neither are the peculiar fhapes with-
out a natural caufe. Their caps are oval, or like pyramids, with lappets
on each fide, and fur within : their gowns reach to the ground, being
furred with white fox-fkins; under which t.hey have.a linen garment rea~b-;

ing to their knees. Tbeir girdles are three inches broad ; and have, ac-
cording to its ufe, many cabaUifiical names, with crolfes, trines, and cir-
cles, infcribed thereon. Thejr knives are dagger-faihion; and the circles
by which they defend themfelves are commonly nine feet in breadth,
tbough the eafiern magicians allow but feven; for both of which a natu-
.ral caufe is pretencded, in the force and fympathy of uumbers.
Such fpells or charms as are compounded of fome edible matter, with
magical c'baracters ·engraveu upon them, are fuccefsfully given for agues,
:bead-achs, epilepfy, fits ofthe mother, and the like; aud it is remarkable
that they operate with mofi effeCt <>n thofe patients who are ignorant of
the charm, <>r its properties. There are alfo particular magical charac-
ters attributed to the planets, whereof Telifms, Peria11s, Amulets, and
.Philr-re.s., .are compofed by buryings under ground, writings, bindings, en-
gtav.i(Jgs, ;allegations, &c. which, done in certain afirological hours, are
.to-conquer enemies, cure difeafes, rem0ve obfiruelions, provoke love, and
preferve from ev·il both the body .and the foul, which they -contend are
dfected by mediums of this kiud, affifted by the force of imagination.
But as for philtres, potiotl'S, love-cups, and the like, they unquefiionably
proceed from a ~atural cau-k, and Ot~<ght not to be claffed wit-h the occult
properties of ·cbBt'ms. TheTe .are many natural compofitions of herbs
and minera~ whicb ha\'e a furpritirrg ed'ect in themfelves, without the
lcafi aajfiance f.rcm fupedl-itious im}>'"effioos, or the affifiance <>f fwper-
-natural agency. For, in the >Commixture of bodies of a flmilar nature,
there is a two-fold power and virttle ; nrfi, when the celefiial properties
are d-uly difpofed in any nat~ral fubfiance, then under one form divers
influences of fuperior powers are combined; and fecondiy, when, from
a11ificial.mixtures and ·compotitions of natural things combined amongft
t8emfelves in a due and harmonical proportion, they agree with the
quality and force of the heavens, under certain correfpondent ·confiel-
la:tions. T-his proceeds from the occult affinity of natural things amongfi
themfe1ves, by the foroe and fympathy of which many aftonithing effects
.are produced.
In the writings Q{ Paracelfus w-e fi.nd many furprifmg examples·of the
power ·of fym,pathy and antipathy, by means of images, telefms, and
amulets, compounded of nothing more than natural ingredients. And
·he particular-ly -defcribes an infallible method, by the image of any bird
·or beafi, to deftroy it, or to ·effect its death, though at a difiance. So like-
wife, by the hair, fat, blood, excrements, or excrefcences, of any animal,
the difeaies of that·animal might be cured, and .its life preferved or de-
firoyed. This is fecn in the ·armary unguent, and fympathetical powder; aud

notorious, both in praCtice and effeCt, throughout England, France, Spain,
Italy, ar11d' the eafiern countries, that laws were enaCted by the legiflature

informed is now frequently done in the more remote and: unpolilhed.parts
of this ifiand. The methoct is, by giving certain baits or preparations to
any domeftic animal, they remove fevers, agues; t:oughs, confumpf'ious,.
afthmas, &e. from any perfon applying to them for that pur·pefe; or they-
can tranfplant or remove· rhem frort1 one perfon to another, by b1.1rying

came out of the vein, which, being chemically prepared with fpirits of
wine and other ingredients, is at lafi made up into a can91e, which, being
once kindled, never goes out till the death of the party whofe blood it is
compofed of; for when he is fick, or in danger, it burAS .dim and troubled;
and when he is dead, it js quite extinguiihed; of which compofition a
learned philofopher hath written an entire traa; viz. De Bio!Jchnio; or,
The Lamp of Life. ·
~ Jn the fimple operations of nature many wonderful t-hings are \vrought,
which upon a fuperficial ·view appear impoffible, or elfe to be the work of
the devil. The1e certaiul7 ought to be confidered in a far different light
from magical perforrr...ances, :and .thould be claffed among the furprifing
ph~nomen.a ·of .Aature. Thus lamps or torches made of ierpents' ikins,
and com.pounded .of :the fat and fpirit of vipers, when lighted in a dark
room, v.-,~U .br-ing the fimj.Jit.ude of f.nakes or ferpents writhing and twifi-
ing upon the wa.lls.. So t>il compouuded of grapes, being put into a lamp
and lighted., will -make the ;room appear to be full of grapes, though iu
reality it is nothing more than the i.dea or fim1litude. The fame thing
is to .be done with all the plants aud -flowers throughout the vegetable
(vfrem, by means of a chemical analr{js, whereby a fimple fpirit is pro-
duced, which will reprefcnt the herb or flower from which it is extratled,
('
. in full bloom. And as the procefs is eafy, fim:ple, pleating., and curious,
I will here fr~te it in fuch a manner as mi.ght.enable any pcdoo to put if
in pratlice at pleafure.
-'Take any whole herb, or flower, with its root, make it very cleag, and
bruife it in a frone mortar quite fmall ; then put it into a glafs veffel her..
metically fealed; but ~ fure the veffel be two par~s in three empty.
Then place it for putrefaaion in a gentle ,heat in balneo, not more than
blood warm, for fix moytbs, by which it will be all refolved into water,
Take this water, and pour it into a glafs retort, and place a receiver there-
unto, the joints of. whi~h ~uft be well clofed ;~ifril it into a fand7heat

er and an oil; and in the upper part of the
veffel will hang a yql~tH~ fait. Separate the oil fJ:om t~e water, and
keep it by .i~fel{,~ but witA.the water purify the volatile fait by diffolving~
filteri~g, .a'nd coagulating. When the fait is_
thus ·purified, imbibe with
it the fai~ ;oil, until it :is well compined. Then digeft them well to-
gether for a month in .a veffel hermetically fealed; and by this means
will be obtained a moll: fubtile effence, which being held over a gentle
heat of a caudl~, the fpir~t .will -fly up into the glafs w.here it is confined,
.and reprefent the _pc:rfea idea or ~1imilitude of that vegetable whereof ~t

is the effence: and in this manner will that thin fubftance, which is like
impalpable athes or fait, fend forth from the bottom of the glafs the
manifeft form of whatever herb it i~ the menjiruum, .in perfeet_ vegetation,
growing ~y little a?d ;little, and putting on fo fully the form of fialks, .
leaves, and flowers, in full and perfeCl: .appearance, that any one would
believe the fame to be natural and corporeal ; though at the fame time it
is-nothing more than-the {p-iritual idea endued with ~ fpiritual elfence.
This 1hadQwed figure, as foon as the veffel is ta~en from the heat or candle,
returns to its caput mortuu~, or. ath~s, again, and vanilhes away like an
apparition, becoming a chaos, or confufed matter. . For more on the me·

To ~ake -a vegetabt'e more quickly yield its fpirit, -take of what vege- ·

cut or bruife them iinall,. put them into warm water, put upon them
yeafi: or harm, and cover them up warm; and let them work three days,
in the fame manner as beer; then. difiil them, aud they will yield their
fpirit very eaftly. -Or elfe take of what herbs, flowers, feed;s,· &c. you
pleafe, fill th~ head of a 1lill therewith, then cover the mouth with
coarfe canvas, and fet on the ftill, having firft put into it a proportionable
quantity of fack or low wine ; then giye it fire, and.it will quickly yield
its fpirit ; but obferve, that, if tW: colour of the vegetable is wanted, you
muft take fome of its dried flowers, and filf the nofe of the frill ther~with,
and you will have the exaa colour. of the he-:b.

AN ILLUSTRATION
Under the veil of Natural Magic, it hath pleafed the Almighty to con.
ceal many valuable and exceU~nt gifts, which c9mmon people either
think miraculous or next to impoffible. And yet in truth, natural ma-
gic is uothing more than the workmaniliip of nature, tn~de manifefi: by
art; for in tillage, as nature produceth corn and herbs, fo art, being
nature's handmaid, prepareth and helpeth it forward ; in which times
and feafons are materially to be coufidered; for annus, non arvus,producit
izriflas. And, th()ugh thcfe things, while they lie hid in nature, do many
of them· feem impoffible and miraculous, yet,- when they are known
and their fimplicity revealed, our difficulty of apprehenfion ceafes, and t~e
wonder is at an end; for that o11ly is wonderful to the beholder whereof
he can conceive no caufe nor reafon, ~ccording to the faying of Ephefius,
?Jiraculum fo(vitur unde videtur e/Te miraculum; yet we ofte~1 fee perfons
'take great pams, and put themfefves to vafi: expence, to d1fcover thefe
impalpable tracks of nature, from whence pecuniary advantages feldom
refult; fo that a man mulJ .no.Ll.~~Jn p_
hilofophy to g!:Qw rich; but muft
} get riches -~~.J~~r~p.ofophy. _
-There is u.nquefiionab y- much praife
due, and great induury required, for obtaining a competent knowledge of
t1atural magic; for to fluggards, niggards, and narrow-minded men, the
fecrets of nature are never opened, though the fiudy of them is certainly
conducive to the glory of God, and to the good of fociety, by more vifi.
bly mauifefiing the omnipotency of his works,. and by fkilfuJJy appJyiug
them to man's ufe and beuefit. Many philofophe~s of the firfi eminence,
as Plato, Pythagoras, Empedocles, Democritus, &c. travelled through
every region of the known world for the accompliilim~nt of this kind of
knowledge; and at their r-eturn, they publicly ~reac_hed and taught it. f /'
But, above all, we learn from 1acred and profane h1fiory, that Splomon was ;fc-::t;1~ -'1,
__
____----- ---~e grc:ateft proficient in th_i~ _
art of any ejth~~ ~~(Qre or fi!lCe_ bis__!lme;
as fie bimfelfbath declared in Ec:clefiaftea and the book ofWifdom, where
he faith, "God hath given me the true fcience of things, fo as to know
., how the world was made, and the power of the elements, the begin-

. " ginations of the mind ; the diverfities of .plants, the virtues of roots,
'~ and all things whatfoever, whether fecret or known, manifefi: or in-
" vifible." And hence it was that the magi, or followers of natural
magic, were accounted wife, and the ftudy honourable ; becaufe it coo-
fills in nothing more than the moft profound and perfeel. part of natural
p~~fophy, which defines the nature, caufes, and~ifeas, of things. _

How far fuch 'inventions as are called charms, amul~s; periapts,
and the like, have any foundation in natural magic, may be wotth our
enquiry; becaufe, if cures are to be effeCted thmugh their tnedium, and
that without any thing derogatory to tbe attributes of the Deity, or the
principles of religion, I fee no reafon why they ihould be rejetled · with
that inexorable contempt, which .leve1s the works of God with the
folly and weakuefs of men. Not that I would enc()urage fuperll:ition,
or become an advocate for a farrago of abfurdities; but when tbe fimpli-
city of natural things, arid their etfetls, are rejeCted merely to encourage
profeffional artifice and emolument. it is prudent for us to dillinguith
between the extremes of bigotted fuperftition and total unbelief.
It was the opinion of many eminent phyucians. of the 6dl ability and
learning, that fuch kind of charms or periapts as confifted of certain odo-
riferous herbs, balfamic roots, mineral concretions, and metallic fubo-
fiances, might have, and mofr probably polrdlkl, by ~ans of their
1lrong medicinal properties, tbe virtue of curing or removing fuch co.m...
plaints as external applications might -eifett, and wbicb -esc often ufcd
.with fuccefs, though without the lealt furprife or admiration; bc;caufe
the one.appears iu a great meafure to he the confequ-ence of manu3l opt>-
ration, which is perceptible and 'l.'flib!e to the fenfes, whil£1: the other
atls by an innate or occult ·power, whith the e1e cannot fee; uor the
mind fo readily comprehend; yet, in both cafes, perhaps, the .effect ~
produced by a fimilar caufe ; and conftqu<=ntly all fuch remedies,. let them
be applied under what form· or fiyle they may, are worthy of our r-egard,
and ought to excite in us not only a veneration for the fimple pratlice of
the ancients in their medi<::al experiments, but a due feofe of gratitude
to the wife Author of our being, who enables us, by fuch eafy means, ttl
remove the infirmities incident to mankind. Many reputable authors,
particularly A. Ferrarius, Alexander Tralliauus, Aetius', O&vianus, Mar-
cellus, Philodotus, Archigines, Philofiratus, Pliny, and Diofcotides, cou...
tend that not only fuch phyfical alligations, appet'lfions, periapts, amulets,.
charms, &c. which from their materials appear to imbibe and to diffufe
the medical properties above defcribed, ought in certaitl obfiinate and
equivocal diforders to be applied; but thofe Jikewife, which· from theic
external form and compofition have no fuch inherent vil'tues to recom-
mend them ; for harm they can do none, and good they might do ~
either by accident, or through the force of imagination. And it is af
..
ferted, with very great truth, that througb the medium of hope and;
fear, fufficiently impreffed upon the mitld or imagination, whether by
charms, or any other lmmerical contrivance or device, the mo!t wonder-
ful and infrantaoeous cures arc fometimes .wro\ltht. They ve called;

the force of imagination; and that difeafes were to be removed · or ter-
minated thereby. Of the truth of this' we have the ftrongeft and moil
infaJlible evidence in the hiccough, which is infiantaneoufly cured by
any fudden etfea of fear or furprife; fo Jikewife agues and many other ma-
ladies are removed ; and to the fame caufe we might ·attribute the only
certain cure kuown for the bite of a mad dog, which is the etfeCl of fear
·and fiagnation wrought upon the mafs of blood by immerging the body
in the fea. Nor are the infiances few, where perfons lying bed-ridden,
and unable to move either band or foot, have, through the ii.tdden fright
of fire, or the houfe falling in upon them, forgot their infirmity, and run
away with as much atlivity as though no fucb malady had exified. See-
ing, therefore, that fuch virtues lie hid in the occult properties of na-
'- ture,- united with the fenfe or imagination of man, ,,.,,here one is the
agent, and the other the patient; where the one is atlive, and the other
paffive, without any compaa with fpirits, or dealings with the devil ; we
furely ought to receive them into our pratlicf', and to adopt them as
often as occafion ferioufiy requires, although profeffional emolument, and
pecuniary advantage, might m (orne infiances be narrowed by it.
But, though I might be an advocate for fuch charms .or occult reme-
dies as are in themfelves perfeClly innocent and fimple, I by no means
with it to be undcrftood, th;1t I either approve or recommend any thing
bordering upon fuch inventio(ls as are obviouOy founded in magical
confederacy, and aa by the medium of aerial or infernal fpirits. To that
·mind, which has but flightly contemplated the works of nature, it muft
·be abundantly evident, that the great and good God which fufiains and
governs the univerfe, bath. in the works.of creation mercifully afforded
us a natural remedy for all our infirmities; anJ it is.repugnant to common
·fenfe, and incompatible with religion atid morality; nay, it would im-
ply a deficie11cy either in the goodnefs or power of the Deity, were we
for a moment to admit the neceffity of charms, amulets, or any other
inventive cures or benefits to men, refuhing from a compact with fpi-
·rits, in which all the powers and performances of witchcraft had their
·beginning; and therefore we may with6ut 'the fmalleft hefitation con-
clude, that whatever hath its foundation in fuch confederacy, Jet
the external objeCt or pretence be what it may, it i~ not only con-
trary to natur~, but highly otfenfh·e to the Deity; and nearly allied
to the thocking 6n of idolatry, by applying the. wor.ks of God to
the power of the devil. For this reafon, it.is impoffible to be too ·cau-
tious how the..ufe of fuch defcriptions .of charms or lamins .is adopted,

wh.ere, infiead of natural·medicaments, magical charaaers, incantations,
and nocturnal ceremonies, confiitute the component parts. A very wife
and learned author, who has written largely upon this fubjetl:, aflerts,
that in thofe very charms and fignatures compacts themfelves are virtually
contained, which evil fpirits at tirfi fubtilly devifed or invented to blind
men's eyes, that thereby they might ·Jead them lefs fcrupuloufly into the
fnares of the devil. And hence we have good ground to believe, that
none are. able abfolutely, and bona fide, to call up any fpirits, without
fome fuch compaa firft formed ; and that whofoever has fo far ventured
·in the art of magic or conjuration, hath, though to himfelf perhaps
unknown, compaaed with and worthipped .the devil, under fome· fuch
form of myfiical words and characters wherewith infernal charms and
amulets are compofed; neither is it to be thought a matter of furprife,
that fuch a compact thould unw'ittingly be made through the medium of
thofe myfiical characters, which, with the devil's aid, have in themfelve3
a power to enchant, infect, allure, prefer:ve, or defl:roy. And to thow,
in firiking coloun, the danger of being drawn away by fuch allurements,
I thall inil:ance the extraordinary cafe of a very harmlefs and well-mean-
ing young man, which was publifhed to the world at the commencement
of the prefent century, by the Bithop of Gloucefier, in the following
well-authenticated letter to that prelate.
AuTHENTIC CoPY of a LETTER ftnt to the Bfjlzop of G/oucejler, by the
. Rwerend Mr. Arthur Be4ford, Minijler of Temple Church, in Brijlol.
MY LoRD, Brijlo!, Auguj/2, I jOJ.
Being informed by Mr. Shute of your lordthip':; defire that 1 thould
communicate to you what I had known concerning a certain perfon, who
was acquainted with fpirits to his own defiruaion, I have made bold to
give you the trouble of this letter, hoping my defire to gratify your
lordfl1ip in· every particular may be an apology for tpe length thereof. I
had formerly given an account to the late Bithop of Hereford, in which
there are probably fome things contained, which I do not now remember,
which, if your lordthip could procure from his lady,- (who now lives near
Gloucefl:er,) would be more autheutic.
About thirteen years ago, whiHl I was curat~ to Dr. Read, ret1or of
St. Nicholas in this city, 1 began to be acquainted with one Thomas
Perks, a man about twenty years of age, who lived with his father at
Mongats6eld, a gunfmitb; and contracted an intimacy with him, he
being not only a very good-natured man, but extremely fk1lled in mathe-
. matical fiudies, which were his contl:a.nt delight, viz. arithmetic, geo-
metry,

metry, ganging, furveying, afirouomy, and algebra; he had a notion
of the perpetual motion, much like that wheel in Archimedes's Mathe-
matical Magic, in which he had made feme improvements, and which
he bas held was demonfirab)e from mathematical principles, though I
could never believe it. I have feeu an iron wheel, to which he intended
to add feveral things of his own invention, in order to finifh the fame ;
but, thiukiug it of no ufe, and being otherwife unfortuuatety engaged,
it was never perfected. He gave himfelf fo much to aftronony, that be
could pot only calculate the motions of the planets, but an eclipfe alfo,
and demonftrate any problem in fpherical trigonometry from mathema-
tical principles, in wbich he difcovered a clear force of reafon. When
one Mr. Bailey, minifter of St. James's in this city, endeavoured to fet
up a mathematical fchool, I advifed him .to this Thomas Perks, for an
acquaintance, in whom, as he told me, he found a greater proficiency
in tbofe ftudies tha11 he expe8ed or could have imagined. After this he
applied bimfelf to afirology, and would fometimea calculate nativities and
refolve horary quefi:ions. When by the providence of God 1 was fettJed
in Tcmplc-parilh, and had not feen him for feme time, he came to
roe., .and, we being in private, he aiked my opinion very ferioufly con- t
cerniug the lawfuluefs of couver6ng with fi>irits ; aud, after I had given
my thoughts in the negative, and confirmed them with the beft reafons
I could, he told me he had confidered all thefe arguments, and believed
they only related to conjurations, but there was a11 innocent fociety with
· them \vhich a man might ufe, if he made no compaels with them, did
no harm by their means, and were not curious in prying into hidden
things; and that he himfelf had difcourfed with them, and heard them
fing to his great fatisfaction; and gave an offer to me and Mr. Bayley at
another time, that, if we would go with him one night to Kingfwood,
we ihould fee them, and hear them both talk and fing, and talk with them
whenever we had a mind, and· we lhould return very fafe; but neither
of us had the courage to venture. 1 told him the fubtilty of the devil
to delude mankind, and to transform himfelf into an angel of light; but
be would not believe it was the devil. I had feveral conferences with
him upon this fubject, but could never convince him, in all which I
could never obferve the leaft diforder of mind, his difcourfe being very
rational; and I propofed (to try him) a quefiion in aftronomy relating
to the projection of the fphcre, which be projeCted and refolved, and
did afterwards demonftrate from the mathematics, fo as to fltow at
the fame time that his brain was free from the leaft tintture of madnefs
and diftraction.-Having this opportunity of afk.ing him feveral particu-
lars, concerning t~e m~thods he ufed, and the difcourfes he. had with
them, be told me be had a book whofe directions h.e followed, ·and ac-

cordingly, in the dead:time :of the night, he went out to a crofs way, with
a :Janthorn and candle cotife~rated for this purpofe with feveral incanta-
tions. He had alfo confe~rated chalk, confifiing of feveral mixtures, wit.h
which he made a circle at what difi:ance he thought fit, within which no
fpirit had power to enter;· Afteri this he invoked the fpirit by fevera~ ­
fonns :Of words, (fome of\vhich he told me were taken out of the holy ·
Scriptures, and therefore he thought them lawful, without confidering
how they might be wrefted to his deilruetion ;) accordingly the fpirits ap-
peared to him which he .called for, in the ihape of little maidens, about
a foot and half high, and played about a circle. At firfi he was fome~ -
what affrighted; but, after fome fmall acquaintance, this antipathy in
nature wore off, and he became pleafed with their company. He· told
me they fpoke with a very thrill voice, like an ancient woman·; He·afked
them if there- was a heaven or hell? they faid there was. He afked th~ ,
what place heaven was? .which they defcribed as a place of great glory:
and bappinef~; ana ·he afked them what hell was? and they bade him ~fk.

He was to have a book made of virgin parchment confecrated with feveral
incantations; likewife a particular ink-horn, ink, &c. for his purpofe;
with theie be w:1s to go out as ufual to a crofs way, and call up a fpirit,
and aik him his name, which he was to put in the firfi page of his book,
and this was to be his familiar. Thus he was to do by as many as he
pleafeJ, writing their names in difrinCl pages, only one in a leaf; and
then, w benever he took the book and opened it, the fpirit whofe name
appeared fhould appear alfo; and, putting this in praclice, the familiar
he had ~~s~ll<:_~ _.Malchi, a word in Hebrew of an unknown iig-
uification. After this they appeared fafrer than he deiired, and in moll:
difrnallhapes, like fcrpents, lions, bears, &c. hilling at him, and attempt-
ing to throw fpears and balls of fire, which did very much affright him,
and the more when he found it not in his power to fray them, infomuch
that his hair (as he told me) fiood upright, and he expeCted every moment
to be torn in pieces ; this happened in December about midnight, when he
continued there in a fweat till break of day, and then they left him, and
from that time he was never well as long as he lived. In his ficknefs he
carne frequently to Brifrol, to confult with Mr. Jacob, an apothecary in
Broad-frreet, concerning a cure, but I know not whether he told him
the origin of his ficknefs or not; he alfo carne to me at the fame time,
and owned every matter of faCt until the lafr, and iufified that, when he
did any thing of this nature, he was deluded in his confcience to think it
lawful, but he was fince convinced to the contrary. He declared he made
no compaCts with any of thofe fpirits, aud never did any harm by their
means, nor ever pryed into the future fortune of himfelf or others, and
exprdfed a hearty repentance and detefiation of his fins ~ fo that, though
thofe methods cofl: him his life in this world, yet I have great reafon to
believe him happy in the other. I am not certain that he gave this account
to any other perfon but rnyfelf, though he communicated fomething of it
to Mr. Bayley, minifier of St. James's, in this city; perhaps your lord-
iliip may be further informed by his relations and neighbours of Man-
gotsfield, which lies in Glouc7frerlhire, not above a mile out of the road
to Bath.

This poor delqded young man, it is very apparent, had no evil delign,
but entered into this infernal alfociation for no other motive than to gra-
tify an idle curiofity; the confequence of which was that he underwent
the mofr indefcribab)e terror and fright, which at firfr deprived him-
of his hulth, and eventually of his life. I have no doubt but the cir-
cum.fiance of difoe/ieving the exijlence of Jpirits (which I apprehend
is more or lefs the caie with mofr people) was the firfi, if not the
only, inducement that urged him to make the experiment. There are .
many infiances of a fimi)ar kind, equally well founded, and as fatal
in their confequences, which might be here adduced, to ihow the dread-
ful effeCls of being Jed away by a prefumptuous or a hardene.d mind, to

felves into our very appetites, enticing our inclinations, and depraving
the moral faculties of the mind ; until they become, as it were, incorpo-
rated with our nature, leading us infenfibly from folly to vice, until a
depravity of heart and an obftinate will betray us into a corporal as well

effetlually accompliihed, were the grand inducements that led me to ex-
plore the fpiritual and infernal kingdoms, and to expofe the iniquity, as
well as to explain the the9ry, of familiarity or compaCt with them. And
in doing this, I have fcrupuloufly avoided giving the effential forms and
