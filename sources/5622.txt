ANSWERS TO THE QUERIES.
QUERY I. answered by Mr. Wm. Makinson, Manchester.
All oxides are heavier than the metal which produces them, be
cause oxygen, by whose union with the metal the oxid is effected, is .
heavier than atmospheric air. The increase of weight is so great in
some bodies, that, in the instance of the formation of red lead, 26
cwt. of lead will give 22 cwt. of that oxide: so that 2 cwt. of oxygen
are absorbed from the atmosphere during the process. By making
iron red hot, and passing over it a continued stream of aqueous
vapour, the metal receives an increase of weight of near 30 per
cent. arising from its decomposing the water and imbibing its oxy
... geſis - *
... ge The same answered, by Mr. W. D. Snooke, Woulbridge,
Metals become oxides by their combination with oxygen, and are,
of course, as much heavier as the weight of the oxygen inabibed.
Af
*
24 ºf The Ladies Diary." İşi
Thus, 101b; of lead, in its oxidation, imbibes 11b. of oxygen, and
consequently the whole oxide weighs 111b.; but, though the oxide is
thus absolutely, it is not specifically, heavier than the metal. º
Guery II. answered by Mr. John Baines, jun, mathematical master in
º the Mathematical School, Reuding. º:
It appears, by the hygrometer, that substances dilate or contract
when the atmosphere becomies humid or dry, and that these dilata
tions and contractions take place alternately as the weather changes
from one to the other. The hairs and sinews of animals exhibit this
as well as corns, which thus expand with the imbibed humidity of
the atmosphere, even before indication by the other senses.
The same, by Mr. W. D. Snooke. ** -
Any change in the atmosphere produces also a change in the ani
mal frame: hence, corns, wounds, sprains, &c. being affected by
tham, usually occasion pain; consequently the shooting of corns, as
well as the variations in the barometer and thermometer, are the
effects of an alteration which has taken place in the atmosphere: so
that, these being perceived before any obvious change in the wea
ther, they are considered as indications of such a change.
QUERY III. answered by Mr. Wm. Mackinson.
- As it respects the formation of butter; milk is divided into two
substances, one consisting of butter, the other of whey ; and churn
ing is only a violent motion, by which the former is coagulated and
separated from the latter. This process is facilitated by an admix
ture of warm water, for its caloric unites with the hydrogen of the
milk, and carries part of it off in hydrogen gas; while the oxygen,
the other component part of water, unites with the remaining milk,
and by its acidity separates the butyrous matter from the serous. º
Mr. D. T. Snooke says, -
. . The application of heat to the water tends towards its decompo
º sition; whence the oxygen of the water readily combines with the
- oil of the cream, and thus the formation of butter is facilitated.
... If, instead of warm water, a moderate heat be communicated to the
* cream, in the open air, a like result would take place, and the butter
obtained by this method be preferable to the other: and hence the
propriety in the practice of placing the churn near the fire during
the operation.
Query IV. answered by Mr. F. Martin, Birmingham.
My opinion on the subject of this query, however erroneous it
may be, is, that it proceeds from appearance more than from reality.
The same, by Mr. Paul Ninnis, St. Agnes, Cornwall.
White hairs appear more conspicuous among black than any other
colour; so that, according to my motion of the word grey, it cannot
possibly be composed of any other colours than black and white.
Thus ingenious answers to the queries were given hy. Afessrs. John

IV. ENIGMA (985), by Forrester, Chorley.
saynot, fair maids, when Winter's midnight gloom
Obscures the shining lamps of heaven's high dome,
Or beauteous bright, in mazy orbits flow,
I)iffuse mild radiance on this world below,
Should I, afar, your wand'ring eye detain,
Near upland mountain or the lowland plain,
Where restless ghosts from haunted shades advance,
Or blue-eyed fairies to the might-bird dance,
"That I’m by fate charg’d with vindictive ire
When my fair womb glows with devouring fire;
From fifty mouths volcanic smoke ascends,
Quick lightning darts far as the eye extends,
And the last renumants of the dead consume,
Of such as may receive the dreadful doom.
But should, perchance, at moon-day I be seen,
Remote, alone, meand'ring o'er the green,
Then might youjudge, with more prophetic skill,
That I'm the herald of some baleful ill;-

Some earthquake dire or deluge near at hand,
Omniscient vengeance on some guilty land;
Or fierce Bellona, in her blood stain’d car, .
Rushing with frenzy to fresh scomes of war,
With crimson hand to lash th'ensanguin'd steed,...
While harpies fell and furies unge her speed;
Some mighty monarch tumbled from his throne,
Or “gasping nature's last tremendous groan.'”

Of age coeval with the wheels of time; -

And darker limb in dungeons under ground:
Still to enlighten the enlighten’d race,
Launch'd by my maker into aerial space;
Guide the lone trav’ller down the mountain's steep,
Point the glad mariner on the “vasty deep ;”
Above, below, around, both wide and far,
I vie with Luna and the polar star.
I have a younger brother on the earth,
Who from couspiring elements took his birth,
Aud, while I range the hills and vallies wide,
Takes his fix’d station as some servile guide,
Who oft befriends the foes of social weal,
And sure directs the vile assassin's steel !
Such deeds avaunt! such kindred I disown, -

V. ENIGMA (986), by Mr. Henry Lee,formerly of Bingham,
Let others seek a surreptitious name,
Prop a weak cause, or bolster up their fame
I need it not: when statesmen justly deal,
They rest on me—the constitution's weal!
The crown—the monarch—on this basis placed,
I form the body-guard, with trappings grac'd,
. . . Let History, with lier thousand tongues relate
Fastern magnificence, its pomp, and state,
Where bloated despots, on a gore-dy'd throne,
Proudly conceit the subject world their own;
Thro' deluges of blood they reckless haste,
And lay whole provinces in desert waste;
Nor would their profligacy end een here,
But nature stops them in their mad career:
Man's strength is finite, and this truth they gain,
Exhausted power relies on me in vain. -
Not so the monarch, where the people's voice
On him reverberates the nation's choice;
Who, only proud when proudly great he reigns,
And every subject's happiness maintains,
On me reposing, his best comfort finds,
Tranquillity unknown to guilty minds.
In times of danger men court me the less,
Tho', seamen-like, I'm subject to the press.
When beat, I shrunk, and never fled the coast; ,
J rose again—was ready at my post.
Let naturalists my name and species trace,
By some affix’d on quadrupedal base:

Unto the fair one's fascinating face, " : * *
I add the charms of elegance and grace; - ".
The easy motion and the graceful mien,
That to be lov’d needs only to be seen. . . . . .
Those invenile sensations I impart, , , ºf
That cheer the mind and elevate the heart;
Confer amusement, appetite, and health;
And various meeds superior to wealth: ... f.
Yet Esculapius, anxious for his fee, *
In his prescriptions never mentions me!
The Lunar motions, 'mid the stellar host,
- More regularity than mine can boast:
In central and eccentric orbs I glide,
Describe Hyperbolas, and Euclid's pride; ".
In horizental lines perform my part,
And please all eyes with my surprising art.
Around my orb see secondaries move,
Like sparkling planets in the realms above,
Partake my motions, imitate my ways,
And gain the plaudits of maternal praise.
Some virtuosos say they heard me speak.
Italian, English, Arabic, and Greek:
And some aver that they have heard me sing,
Sweet as the sylvan songsters of the spring 1–
That I produce harmonious sounds, is true,
And, like Amphion, built a mansion too;
But as to emulate the blackbird's strain,
Were an attempt impertiment as vain :
Kings, queens, fair princesses, and lords likewise,
And smirking countiers, in their dark disguise,
At various seasons grac'd my throng'd levee,
And owe their easy elegance to me.
Among the ancients, as some sage indites,
1 taught th' initiated sacred rites: . . .
Though all the pious brethren of this isle
Conceive my precepts would their race defile?
And gravely tell you, from the sacred word,
That I'm a detestation to the Lord!
But from such partial judges I appeal,
To well-bred belles, who my importance feel.
On Gaul's gay viny hills, and vernal vales,
Where mirth and music swell the balmy gales,
I most abound;—congenial to my mind
Is that sweet rural bliss which there we find. * *
Among the gay, the gayest I appear, *.
And crown the blessings of the smiling year.

When your soft,bosom heaves th' impressive sigh, ,
And the big tear hangs pendant in the eye; ,
'Tis not myself—my emblem ’tis you see;
As much alike as any two can be. -
Wide is my empire, boundless my domain;
I kiss the uplands, and embrace the plain.
What time the cock awakes th’ labouring swain,
And warns the milk-maid to the fields again,
With laugh and song they pass my beauties by,
Nor note my virtues, nor my worth descry.
Thus, heedless youth the path of science flies,
To catch at bubbles as the vapours rise.
The violet, lily, pink, and blushing rose, º
Perfume my bed,—on these I take repose.
The wanton zephyr often woos my charms;
But his rude touch my chastity alarms:-
. I fly th’ embrace,—to earth my form consign;
Then, phoenix-like, I rise again and shine.
A pow'r there is, that mortal strength defies,
That works unseen, and takes me by surprise:
'Twere vain to plead, where Mercy has no ear
Though I, like Niobe, dissolve in tears. ... " -
When the gay morn awakes the lark to sing,
Love swells his breast and flutters on his wing;
The smiling hills rejoice in humid show’rs,
And the rich glebe its grateful incense pours :

A splendid scene;—but short, all ! short's my stay :
A little hour, perchance, and I'm no more;
But time will soon my wonted charms restore.
The morning breaks, and I again appear,
With countless numbers in my front and reas:

I nurse your hopes, alleviate your fears;
Like the pale moon, I shine in borrow'd light,
For: I’m the offspring of the shades of might.

The angles are easily found to be as follows, viz. z. A- 4 of 180°
=25°3, z_B=% of190–51°3, Z.C= 1029%. Then, from Hutton's .

N.B. This is ex. 14, Analyt. Plane Trig. Hutton's Course, vol. 3.
Schol. Let s = siue of the smallest Z.A.; then the sine of the largest :
4A, will be (4s-8 s ) v 1.--s , and that of its supplement 3A is .
3 s—4sº. These must be equal, and, by making them so, we arrive at
the equation sº—#sº-H sº-ºr=0, the thee positive roots ofwińch

Let AC be the given line, and CE another, making a given angle
with it; also B the given point in AC. Then, by prop. 48 Simps.
Algeb, describe the circle ADB, touching CEin D; and from the point
of contact D, draw the lines DA, DB; them will the z AlbH be the
greatest possible.—For, from any other point F, in the line CD, draw
the lines FA, FB; as also from the point G where FA cuts the circle,
draw GB. Then the z AGB, being external with regard to the
triangle BGF, will be greater than the Z.AFB. Theref. ADB, on the

Lastly,6° x 12./3×2618 = 195'89 is the solid,tyof the cone.

Draw the horizontal line AD, and the inclined plane AE elevated
30°; set off AB = C, the cone's base, which bisect in F; erect FC
perp. AB and AG perp. AD meeting FC in G, make FC-4FG,
join AC, BC; then will G be the centre of gravity, and ABC a.
vertical section of the come (see prop. 38, vol. 2, Hatton's Course.)—
Now the z AGF= BAD = 30°, theref. AG = 2AF = 6, and FG.

**7854 - 195'89.-Also, if AG be produced to meet the slant side in
H, it is obvious that H will be the highest point where a weight can
be placed without overturning the cone. -
The same, by Mr.A. Glendenning, North Yarmouth.
Let AB be the inclined plane, making with the horizon the Z. BAT)
* = 30°; having made AB = 6 feet, let CF be perp. to and bisect AB
in F, and intersect A H, drawn perp. to AD in G ; make GC = 3GF,
. . and FC is the altitude of the equired come.—For G is the centre of
gravity of the cone by constr. and Dr. Hutton's Dictionary under
Centre: and, since AH is perp. to the horizon, and passes through
that centre, the body is supported (Machan. prop. 38 course, vol. 2):
and, because the base AB and inclimation BAD are constaut, and the
• cone is merely supported, it is consequently the greatest which can
be constituted on that base under those limitations.—It is further
obvious that the point H, at which AG produced meets BC, is the
- highest point at which a weight may be placed without overturning
, the cone. For, were the weight placed higher than H, the common
centre of gravity of that and the come would not be supported. . .

VIII. QUes. ans. by Messrs. J. R. Ambler, JWm. Burdon, and W. S.
Let x3 + 2 and x3–2 denote the numbers. Then the dif of
their squales, 83%, is evidently a cube. It remains then to make
the dif. of their cubes 12a:* + 16, or 3r" + 4 a square. For its:
root put 2a:3 — 2 ; then 33:94- 4 = 4a:9 – 84.3 + 4; this gives ar"-
trº, or arº – 8; hence r= 2; and the required numbers are 10 and 6.
The same, by Mr. John Buins, Math. Master, Reading School.
Let a 4-y,and ac-—y denote the two numbers; and put the dif. of
their squarés (x + y)*— (a — y)* = 8 y?, which gives a = zy”;,
then the dif. of their cubes (a + y)3 — (a —y)3 becomes (ºy” + y)*

. Let ACBD be the elliptic section of

CD the conjugate, and F, f, the two
foci. Then, by the ques, a sound emitted
at F, after arriving at f, will pass on to
B, and by striking the curve there, A. B
reverberate from B to f again, in the

theory ofsound, 2fl = 1142+8=142%
feet, which put = a ; also put 12 millions .D
= b, .5236 = e, and EfEa. Then by the nature of the ellipse (see

the solid content = CD* x AB. × C=ac (2++ 3 air-Ha)=b by

XIV. Question, answered by Omicron, the proposer.
Let P be the given point in a line GPN perp. to the Ji
horizon, PMN the required locus in a vertical plane,
Many point in it, and suppose the ball to be thrown
in the direction MP, so as to strike the point P with a
given velocity. Let p- 4 times the space due to the M/{
given velocity, and let PE be the line of direction
after impact at P: then the body will describe the
parabola PAM, and p will be the parameter to the
diameter PN. Draw MC parallel to PE, which will
be an ordinate to the diameter PN. Then, since the
2 EPC = EPG = MCP, theref. MC = MP, and - -
drawing MD perp. to PN, PD = DC, and MC*= PC x p- PD
x 2 p; theref, the locus is a circle of which the diameter is 2p–PN,
Note. The principle of this solution, by the author of the question,
is, that the ball is thrown or passes in a direct line to the given point,
or, at least, that it strikes the given point in that direction. And on
this supposition the solution was given, similar to the above, by
Messrs. S. Jones, James Wood, and Wm. Wright. But most of our
other contributors have contemplated the question on the supposition
that the ball thrown from the hand describes a parabolic curve in
its approach to the given point, where it strikes that point in the
vertex of the parabola, perpendicular to the given plane, and from
whence, being elastic, the ball must necessarily return again in the
same curve, and consequently arrive at the hand again. And in this
way the solution is given scientifically by Messrs. Abram, Atkinson,

particularly when they describe a circle through the given point and
cutting the curve of the cycloid, whether that circle be equal, or
greater, or less than the generating circle of that curve. And
though those solutions are not incorrect which only direct to describe
a eircle through the given point and touching the curve of the cy
cloid, yet they are not to be considered as complete, since such a.
tangent circle cannot be described geometrically, or by the ruler
and compasses only. - a

IV. QUEST. (1302), by Mr. John Baines, jun. Matl.e.t.atical Sehool,
Iteading.
There are two dials, both made for the same latitude, one a hori
zontal, and the other a vertical, dial : the arc included between the
hour-lines of 12 and 1 on the horizontal dial, is equal to that between .
2 and 3 on the vertical dial. Required the latitude of the place for
which they were made.
V. Quest. (1303), by Mr. Sam. Treeby, Schoolmaster, Plymouth.
AB is the diameter of a given-semicircle, AD a given chord; it is
required to draw geometrically another chord, BC, to intersect the
former in E, so that the triangle ACE may be a maximum. º

20° north: it is required to find the time in the morning when the
sun's altitude will be the same at each place, and also the altitude
and azimuth at the same time.
VII. QUEST. (1805), by Mr. John Collins, Mathematical Master,
- - Hatton Garden. -
If any two sides of a spherical triangle be produced till the contia
nuation of each side be half the supplement of that side, the arc of a
great circle joining the extremities of the sides thus produced will be
the measure of the angle contained by the chords of those two sides:
required the demonstration. - -
VIII. Quest. (1306), by Mr. Wm. Burdon, Acaster Mallis. l
Find an arc such, thatthe sum ofthe natural sines, to every minute
of it, may be equal to 1000, the radius being 1. -
IX. QUEst. (1307), by Mr. W. G. Horner, of Bath. -
A young surveyor has engaged, for a high wager, to lay out an
equilateral triangle of 6 chains in each side, with no instrument but
a chain and some pickets, and without using his chain for any other
purpose than to measure: he now doubts, with Montacla (Recrea
tions, vol. 1, Geom. Prob. 3), the possibility of performing the con
struction, and applies to the Diarian mathematicians concerning his
chance of success.
X. Quest. (1308), by Mr. A. Glendenning, North Yarmouth.
Theorem. When the distance of the centres of the circumscribing
circle, and the circle touching the base and the continuation of the
sides of a triangle, are given; those sides are given in magnitude and
position: required the demonstration.
XI. QUEST. (1309), by Mr. Geo. Ducket, Northwich.
If a ball of lead, 4 inches diameter, be dropt from the top of a
salt pit, 100 yards deep, 20 yards of which is filled with brine, of 1.4
specific gravity : quere, the last velocity of the ball, and the whole
time of descent?
XII. QUEST. (1310), by Mr. John Whitley, Rotherham.
A circle and a right line without it being given in positionſ: if
from any point in that line, as a centre, a circle be described with a
radius equal to a tangent drawn from the same point to the given
circle, its circumference will always pass through a certain giveir
point, and which point is also to be found.
XIII. QUEST. (1311), by Omicron, of Penrith.
Three circles, none of which are included within the others, being
given in magnitude and position: to determine geometrically a
point in a line of any kind, given also in position, so that tangents
being drawn from thence to those circles, the figures described on
them, given in specie, may be equal to a given quantity. . . .

XIV. Guest. (1312), by Llerien.
A string, without weight, is attached to a
point E, in the horizontal table ABCB; with *—.
the other end of the string a body G, collected º
in its centre of gravity, is connected: the string
being at full stretch, the body is brought to the
edge of the table, as in the figure, and suffered - Gº;
to descend by its weight; required the curve it D ... . . . -
describes in its descent.—N. B. This question has been proposed in
a periodical publication; but is now reproposed for a geometrical
solution. - . . . . . . * * * *
XV. or PRIze Quest. (1313), by Mr. Henry Atkinson, Newcastle.
[Whoever answers it before Feb. 1, has two chances for ten Diaries.]
It is now, generally admitted by philosophers, that stones have
sometimes fallen from the atmosphere, but they are still much di
vided in their opinious respecting their origin. Some suppose them
to be projected from the moon. If this be admitted, with what
velocity willa ball, whose specific gravity is 3500, and weight 1 ounce,
strike the surface of the earth, supposing its velocity at the point of
equal attraction to be 1000 feet per second, taking in the resistance
of the air Also, with what velocity must it have been projected
from the moon, supposing her to have no atmosphere.

The Prizes for the several Solutions have been determined by lot
as follows: 1st. For the Prize Enigma, to Miss A. Collins, and to Mr.
D. T. Sheridan, each 8 Diaries.—2nd. For the General Answer to the
Enigmas, to Mr. Rd. Claye, and to Mr. Wm. Oats, each 8 Diaries.—
3rd. For the Rebuses and Queries, &c. to Mr. J. Baines, and to
Mr. John Herdson, each 6 Diaries.—4th. For the Prize Question,
to Mr. John Abram, and to Mr. Henry Atkinson, each 10 Diaries.
All of whom will please to send for their prizes to Mr. Greenhill, at'
Stationers' Hall, London.--It is again requested, that all letters be sent
within the limited time, so as to come to hand before the 1st of May, ,
otherwise they cannot be used; and post-paid or franked, otherwise
they will not be received; and that the several compositions be made º
as short as they can, with propriety; but the solutions for the Prize
Enigma and PrizeQuestion must come to hand before Feb. 1, toentitle
them to a chance for the Prizes. And, along with all new Questions
Iºniginas, Rebuses, and Charades, their answers must be sent.
Our ingenious correspondents should recollect that new questions -
are not inserted that have not been accompanied with their solutions.
And we are sorry that the new question of our ingenious young
female correspondent, S.J., came not to hand till after the Diary
eopy had been completed and sent to the printer.—The contributors
will also learn with pleasure that Dr. Hutton's new Dictionary and
Mr. Leybourn's new edition of the Diaries have both been pub
fished; particulars of which to be had of Mr. Laybourn, at the Royal
Military College, Bagshot.
