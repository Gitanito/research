PREFACE.
Cairo, 1835.
DURING a former visit to this country, undertaken
chieflyfor the purpose of studying the Arabiclanguage
in its most famous school, I devoted much of my atten-
tion to the manners and customs of the Arab inhabi-
tants; and in an intercourse of two years and a half with
thispeople, soon found thatall the information which I
had previouslybeen able to obtain respecting them was
insuflicient to be of much use to the student of Arabic
literature, or to satisfy the curiosity of the general
reader. Hence I was induced to cover some quires of
paper with notes on the most remarkable of their
usages, partly for my own benefit‘, and partly in the
hope thatI might have it in my power to make some of
my countrymen better acquainted with the domiciliated
classes of one of the: most interesting ‘nations of the
world-, by drawing a detailed picture of the inhabitants
of the largest Arab city. The period of my first. visit
to this country did not, however, suffice for the accom-

sesses an excellent and ample description of Arab mau-
ners and customs, in Dr. Russell’s account of the people
of Aleppo. I will not forfeit my own claim to the
reputation of an honest writer,by attempting to detract
from the just-v merits of that valuable and interesting
work; but must assert, that it is, upon the whole, rather
an account of Turkishthan of Arab manners; and that
neither the original Author, nor his brother to whom
we are indebted for the enlarged and much improved
edition, was suflicientlyacquainted with theArabic lan-
guage to scrutinize some of the most interestingsubjects
of intruiry which the plan of the work required them to
treat: nor would their well-known station in Aleppo, or
perhaps their national feelings, allow them to assume
those disguises which were necessary to enable them to
become familiar with many of the most remarkable
religious ceremonies, opinions, and superstitions, of the
people whom theyhave described, Deficienciesin their
remarks on these subjects are the only faults of any
importance that I can discover in their excellent and
learned work*.
"
Among the memoirs in “ the great French work" on Egypt
is one entitled “Essai sur les mmura des hahitaus modernel do
l’Egypte;” but its author appears to me to have fallen into an
error of considerablemagnitude, in applying,to the Egyptian: in
V1 PREFACE.
I ‘have been ditferently -circumstanced. Previously
to my first visit to this country,"I acquired some know-
ledge of‘thelanguage and -literature of the Arabs; and
general,observations which are, in truth,for the most part descrip-
tive of -the manners and customs of their naturalised rulers, the
Memloo’ks. It is probable that the Egyptians in some degree
imitatxd, when theywere able to do so, the habits and customs of
this-clans: I mayrhowever,venture to ufiirm,‘that'the'essay‘here
alluded to does not convey a true notion of theirpresent moral
and social state. Its author, moreover, shows himself to have
been "often extremely careless both in his observations and in-
quiries: this is particularlyevident in his singular misstatement
of the correspondence of French and Mohhammadan hours, and
in thefirsttwo pages (in the Svo. edition) of the section on public
fétes. He has given many just philosophicalobservations; but
these occupy too large a proportion of a memoir scarcely exceed-
ing one third of the extent of the present work. To show that
these remarksare not made in an invidionsspirit, I most willingly
express my high admiration of other parts of “ the great work”
(especially the contributions of M. Jomard), relating to subjects
which have alike employed my mind and pen, and upon which I
shall probably publish my observations.—-Burckhardt’s“Arabic
Proverbs” and their illustrationsconvey many notions of remark-
able customs and traits of character of the modern Egyptians;
but are veryfar from composing a completeexposition,or,in every
case, a true one; for national provcrhs are bad tests of the mo-
rality of a peop1e.—There is one work, however, which presents
most admirable pictures of the manners and customs of the
Arabs, and particularly of those of the Egyptians: it is “the
Thousand and One Nights," or Arabian‘Nights’ Entertainments:
if the English reader possessed a close translation of it with suf-
ficient illustrativenotes, I might almost have spared myself the
tabour of the present undertaking.

with M_oos’lims, of various ranks in society: I have
livedes theylive, conforming with theirgeneral habits;
and, in order to make‘them familiarand unreserved to-

agreement with them in opinion whenever my con-
science would allow me, and in most other cases, re-
frained from the expression of my dissent. as well as
from every action which might give them disgust;
abstaining from eating food forbidden by their religion,
and drinkingwine, &c. ; and even from habits merely
disagreeable to them; such as the use of knives and
forks at meals. Having made myself acquainted with
all their common religious ceremonies,I have been able
to escape exciting, in strangers, any suspicion of my
being a person who had no right to intrude among
them,whenever it was necessary for me to witness any
Mohhammadan rite or festival. While, from the dress
which I have found most convenient to wear, I am
generallymistaken, in public, for a Turk,my acquaint-
ances, of course, know me to be an Englishman; but

“it,,is. no sin in me to put into your hands the noble

will take it in unclean hands, and even sit upon it! I
b_egGod’s forgiveness for talking of such a thing: far
he it-from you to do so: you, praise be to God, know_
and observe the command, ‘None shall touch it but
those who are clean“ ”.—-He once sold a copy of the
Ckoor-a’n,on my application,to a. countryman of mine,
Who, beingdisturbed,just as the bargain was concluded,
bysome person entering the room, hastilyput the sacred
hook upon the seat, and under a part of his dress, to
conceal :it. The bookseller was much scandaiized by
this action; thinkingthat my friend was sitting upon
the book, and that he was doing so to show his con-
tempt of it: he declares his belief that he has been
heavily punished by God for this unlawful sa.le.—There
was onlyone thing that I had much diflicultyin per-
suading‘ him to do during my former visit to this
-
country; which was, to go with me, at a particular
period, into the mosque of the Hhasu.ney’n,the reputed
burial-place of the head of El-Hhosey’n, and the most
sacred of the mosques in the Egyptian metropolis. On

Afterrelating these anecdotes, I should mention, that
the characters of my other acquaintances here are not
marked by similareccentricities. My attentions to my
visitors have been generally confined to the common’
usages of Eastern hospitality; supplying‘ them with
pipes and coffee, and welcoming them to a share of my
dinner or supper. Many of their communications I

I have principallyaimed at, .in this work, is cnrnect~

matter that I have related by the slightest sacrifice of
truth.
Since writing the above, it has occurred to me, thatI
should offer some apologyfor the-unusual mode in which
I have written Arabic words in the following pages.
Had I found it necessary only to insert a few of such
words, already found in the works of ‘many of my
countrymen, I might have expressed them in thevsame
manner as most of those authors have done; writing
“Mahomet” or “Mohammed" for “Mohkam’mad,”
“ Koran ”
for “
Ckoor-a’n,”"‘
Caliph"
for “
Khalee’feh,”
“ Sultan” for “

“Bedouin "
for “

for “

“Harem ”
for “

INTRODUCTION.
TEX COUNTRY AND CLIMATE-—flETl.0P0LIS1H0USI9<"
POPULATION.
IT is generallyobserved, thatmany of the most remark-
able peculiaritiesin the manners,customs, and character
of a nation, are attributable to the physical peculiarities
of the country. Such causes, in an especial manner,
affect the moral and social state of the modern Egyp-
tians,and thereforehere require some preliminarynotice :
but it will not as yet be necessary to explain their par-
-ticular influences: these will be evinced in many subse-
quent parts of the present work.
The Nile,in its course throughthe narrow and wind-
ing valley of Upper Egypt, which is confined on each
side by mountainous and sandy deserts, as well as
through the plain of Lower Egypt, is everywhere bor-
dered, excepting in a very few places,bycultivated fields
of its own formation. These cultivated tracts are not
perfectlylevel, beingsomewhatlower towards the deserts
thanin the neighbourhood of the river. They are in-
terspersed withpalm-groves and villages,and intersected
by numerous canals. ‘The copious summer rains which
prevail "in Abyssinia and the neighbouring countries

beginto show their effects in Egypt,by the rising of the
Nile, about the period of the summer solstice. By the
autumnal equinox, the river attains its greatest height,
which is always sufiicient to fillthe canals by which the
fields are inigated, and, generally, to inundate_large
portions ‘of the cultivable land: it then gradually falls
until theperiod when it again begins to rise. Being
impregnated,particularlyduring its rise, with rich soil
washed down from the mountainous countries whence it
flows, a copious deposit is annually spread, eitherby the
natural inundation or by artificial irrigation, over the
fields which border it; while its bed, from the ‘same
cause, rises in an equal degree. The Egyptians depend
entirely upon their river for the-fertilizationof the soil;
rain being a very rare phenomenon in their country,
excepting in the neighbourhood of the Mediterraneani
and as the seasons are perfectly regular, the peasant
may make his arrangementswith the utmost precision
respecting the labour he will have to perform. Some-
times his labour is light; but when it consists in raising
water for irrigation,it is excessively severe.
The climate of Egypt, during the greater part of the
year, is remarkablysalubrious. The exhalations from
the soil afier the period of the inundation render the
latter part of the autumn less healthythanthe summer
and winter; and cause ophthalmia and dysentery, and
some other diseases, to be more prevalent then than at
other seasons; and during a period of somewhat more
or less than fifiy days (called el-lclmm’a’sce’n), com-'
mencing in April, and lasting throughout May, hot
southerlywinds occasionallyprevailfor about three days
together. These winds, though theyseldom cause the
thermometer of Fahrenheit to rise above 95° in Lower.
.4
oousmv AND CLIMATE. 3
Egypt, or, in Upper Egypt, 105°’,are dreadfullyoppres-
sive, even to the natives. When theplague visits Egypt,
it is generallyin the spring; and this disease is most
severe in the period ofthe khum’a’see’n. Egypt is also
subject, particularly during the spring and summer, to
the hot wind called the cemoo'1n, which is still more
oppressive than the khum’a‘see’n winds, but of much
shorter duration; seldom lastinglonger than a quarter of
an hour, or twentyminutes. It generallyproceeds from
the south-east,or south-south-east,and carries with it
clouds of dust and sand. The general height of the
thermometerin the depthof winter in Lower Egypt, in
the aflernoon and in the shade, is from 50° to 60°: in
the hottest season it is from 90°to 100°; and aboutlten
degrees higher in the southem parts of Upper Egypt.
But thoughthe summer heat is so great, it is seldom
very oppressive; being generally accompanied by a:re-
freshing nmtherlybreeze, and the air beingextremely
dry. '111ere is, however, one great source of discomfort
arisingfrom this dryness, namely, an excessive quantity
of dust-; and there are other plagues which very much
detract from the comfort which thenatives of Egypt, and
visiters to their country, otherwise derive from its genial
climate. In spring, summer, and autumn, flies are so
abundant as to be extremelyannoyingduring the day-

The climate of Upper Egypt is more healthy,though
hotter, than that of Lower Egypt. The plague seldom
ascends far above Cairo, the metropolis. It is most:
common in the marshy parts of the country, near the
Mediterranean. During the last ten years, the country:
having been better drained, and quarantine regulations
adopted to prevent or guard against the introduction of
this disease from other countries, very few plague-cases
have occurred, excepting in the parts above-mentioned,
and in those parts the pestilencehas not been severe ‘L’
Ophthalmiais also more common in Lower Egypt than
in the southernparts. It generally arises from checked
perspiration; but is aggravatedby the dust ‘and many
other causes. When remedies are promptly employed,
thisdisease is seldom alarmingin its progrew; but vast
numbers of the natives of Egypt, not knowinghow to
treat it, or obstinately resigning themselves to fate, are
deprived of the sight of one or bothof their eyes. ~
.
When questioned respecting the salubrityof Egypt, I
have often been asked whether many aged persons are
seen among the inhabitants : few, certainly, attain ‘a
great age in this country ; but how few do, in our own
land, without more than once suffering from an illness
* This remark was written before the terrible plague of the
presentyesr (1835),which was certainly introduced fromTurkey,
and extended throughoutthe whole ofEgypt, thoughits ravages-
wers not great in the southern parts. It has destroyed not less
than eighty thousandpersons in Cairo: that is, one-thirdof the
population; and far more, I_believe,thantwohundred thousandin
all Egypt.
HETROPOLIS. 5
that would prove fatal without medical aid, which is
obtained by a very small numberin Egypt! The heat
of the summer monthsis sufficientlyoppressive to occa-
sion considerable lassitude, while, at the same time, it
excites the Egyptian to intemperance in sensual enjoy-
meats; and the exuberantfertilityof the soil engenders
indolence; little nourishment sufiicing for the natives,
and the sufficiency being procurable without much
exertion..
The modern Egyptian metropolis, to the inhabitants
of which most of the contents of the following pages
relate, is now called Musr ; but was formerly named
El-Cka’In'reb; whence Europeans have formed the name
of Cairo. It is situated at the entrance of the valleyof
Upper Egypt, midway betweenthe Nile and the eastern
mountain range of Moockut’tum. Between it and the»
river there intervenes a tract of land, for the most part
cultivated, which, in the northern parts (where the port
of-Boo’la'ck is situated),is more than a mile in width,
and, at the southern part, less than half a mile wide.
The metropolis occupies a. space equal to about three
square miles; and its population is about two hundred
and forty thousand. It is surroundedbya wall, the gates
ofwhich are shut at night, and is commanded bya large
citadel, situated at an angle of the town, near a point
of the mountain. The streets are unpaved; and most
of them are narrow and irregular: theymight more pro-
perlybe called lanes.
By a stranger who merelypassed throughthe streets,’
Cairo would be regarded as a very close and crowded
city; but thatthis is not the case, is evident to a person
who overlooks the town from the top of a lofty house,
or from the minaret of a mosque. The great thorough-

fine-streets have generally a row of shops along each
side "‘. Above the shops are apartments which do not
communicatewith them,and which are seldom occupied,
by the persons who rent the shops. To the right and
left of the great thoroughfaresare by~streets and quar-
ters. Most of the by-sheets are thoroughfares, and
have a large wooden gate at each end, closed at night,
and kept by a porter within,who opens to any persons
requiringto be admitted. The quarters mostly consist
of several narrow lanes,having but one generalentrance,
with-a gate, which is also closed at night; but several»
have a by-street passing throughthem.
Of the private houses of the metropolis, it is particu-
larly necessary that I should give a description. The
accompanyingengraving will serve to give a general
notion of their exterior. The foundation-walls, to the
height of the first floor,are cased, externallyand often
internally,with the soft calcareous stone of the neigh-
bouring mountain. The surface of the stone, when,
newlycut, is of a lightyellowish hue ; but its colour soon
darkens. The alternate courses of the front are some-
times coloured red and white, particularly in large.
houses ; as is thecase with most mosques-1-. The super-
structure, the front of which generally projects about
two feet,and is supported’ by corbels or piers, is of brick;
and often plastered. «The bricks are ‘burnt, and of a
dull red colour. The mortar is generallycomposed of

general, in consequence of an order of the government,whereby
the inhabitants were required thus. to honour the arrival of

mud, in the proportion of one-half,with'a fourthpart
of lime, and the remaining part of the ashes of straw
and rubbish. Hence the unplrstered walls of brick are
of a dirty colour; as if the bricks were unburnt. The
roofis flat,and covered witha coat of plaster.
The most usual architectural style of the entrance of
a. private house in Cairo, is shown by the sketch here
inserted; The door is often ornamented in the manner
here represented: the compartment in which is. the in-
scription, and the other similarly-shaped compartments,
are painted red, bordered with white; the rest of the
surface of the door is painted green. The inscription,
“ He (i. e. God) is the Creator, the Everlasting”(the
object of which will be explained when I treat of the
superstitions of the Egyptians), is seen on many doors;
but is far from being general: it is usually painted in
black or white characters. Few doors but those of
large.houses are painted. They generallyhave an iron
knocker, and a wooden lock ; and there is usually a
mounting-stoneby the side.
The g'round—floor apartments next the street have
small wooden grated windows, placed sutficientlyhigh
to render it impossible for a person passing by in the
street, even on horseback,to see through them. The
windows of theupper apartments generallyproject a foot
and a half, or more, and are mostly formed of turned
wooden lattice-work,which is so close that it shuts out
much of the light and sun, and screens the inmates of
the house from the view of persons without,while at the
same time it admits the air. They are generally of
unpainted wood; but some few are partiallypainted red
and green, and some are entirely painted. A window
of this kind is called a ro’sItan, or, more commonly,a

mealtrebedyelz,which letter word has anotherapplica-
tion thatwill be mentioned below. Several windows of
ditlhrent descriptions are represented in some of the
illustrationsof this-work;and sketches of the most com-
mon patterns of the lattice-work,on a larger scale, are
here inserted ". Sometimesa window of thekind above
described has a little meshrebee’yeh, which somewhat
resembles a ro’shan in miniature, projecting from the
front, or from each side. In this,in order to be exposed
to a current of air, are placed porous earthen bottles,
which are used for coolingwater byevaporation. Hence
thename of “
meshrebee"yeh,”which signifies “
a place
for drink,” or “—for drinking.” The projectingwindow
has a flat one of lattice-work,or of gratingof wood, or
of coloured glass,immediatelyabove it. Some projeett
ing windows are wholly constructed of boards; and I
few have frames of glass in the sides. In the better
houses, also, the windows of lattice-workare now gene-
rally furnished with frames of glassin theinside, which
in the winter are wholly closed ;, for a penetratingcold
is feltin Egypt when the thermometer of Fahrenheit
is below 60°. The windows of inferior houses are

The houses in general are two or three stories high;
and almost every house thatis suflicientlylarge encloses
an open, unpaved court, called a hJm’slz, which is entered
by a passage that is constructed with one or two tum-
ings, for the purpose of preventing passengers in the
street from seeing into it. In this passage, just within
the door, there is a long stone seat, called mu,s’tub’ah,
built against the back or side wall, for the porter and
other servants. In the court is a well of slightly
brackishwater, which filters through the soil from the
Nile; and on its most shaded side‘ are, commonly, two
water-jars, which are dailyreplenished withwater of the
Nile, brought from the river in skins-r. The principal
apartments look int!) the court; and their exterior walls
(those which are of brick) are plastered and white-
washed. There are several doors which are entered
from the court. One of these is called ba'b cl-hluu-ee’m
(the‘door of the hha1ec’m)‘: it is the enhance of the
stairs which lead to the apartments appropriated exclu-
sively to the women and their master and his children1.
In general, there is, on the ground‘-fioor,an apart-
ment called a mu-n’dar’ah, in which male visitess
are received. This has a wide, wooden, grated window;

and cushions placedagainst each of its three walls, com-
posing what is called a deewa’n. or divan. The mattress,
which is generally about three feet wide, and three or
four inches thick,is placed eitheron the ground or on a
raised frame; and the cushions, which are usually of a
length equal to the width of the mattress, and of a
height equal to half thatmeasure, lean against the wall.
Both mattresses and cushions are stuffed with cotton,
and are covered with printed calico, cloth,or some more
expensive stuff. The walls are plastered and white-
washed. There are generally,in the walls, two or three
shallow cupboards, the doors of which are composed of
very small panels, on account of the heat and dryness
of the climate, which cause wood to warp and shrink as
ifit were placed in an oven ; for which reason the doors
of the apartments also are constructed in the same
manner. We observe great varietyand much ingenuity
displayed in the different modes in which these small
panels are formed and disposed. A few specimens are
here introduced. The ceiling over the leewa’n is of
wood, with carved beams, generally about a foot apart,
partiallypainted, and sometimes gilt. But that part of
the ceilingwhich is over the doorcka”ah, in a handsome
house is usually more richlydecorated: here, instead of
beams, numerous thin strips of wood are nailed upon
the planks,forming patterns curiously complicated, yet
perfectly regular, andhavinga highlyornamental effect‘.
I give a sketch of the half of a ceiling thus decorated,
but not in thevmost complicated style. The strips are
painted yellow, or gilt; and the spaces m'thin, painted
green, red, and blue*. In the example which I have

inserted, the colours are as indicated in a sketch of a
portion of the same on a larger scale, which is prefixed,
excepting in the square in the centre of the ceiling,
where thestrips are black,upon a yellowground. From
the centre ofthissquare a chandelier is often suspended.
There are many patterns of a similar kind; and the
colours generallyoccupy similar places with regard to
each other; but in some houses these ceilings are not
painted. The ceiling of a projecting window is ofien
ornamented in the same manner. A sketch of one is
here added. Good taste is evinced by only decorating
in this manner parts which are not always before the
eyes; for to look long at so many lines intersecting each
other in various directions would be painful.
In some houses (as in thatwhich is the subject of
the engraving opposite page 11) there is another room,
called a Muck”ad, for the same use as the mun’dar’ah,
having an open front, with two or more arches, and a
low railing; and also, on the ground-floor, a square
recess, called a Tukhtabo’sh, with an open front, and
generallya pillarto support the wall above: its floor is
a paved leewa’n; and there is a long wooden sofa
placed along one, or two, or each, of its three walls.
The court, during the summer, is frequentlysprinkled
with water, which renders the surrounding apartments
agreeably cool—or at least those on the ground-floor.
All the rooms are furnished in the same manner as that
first described.
Arming the upper apartments, or those of the Hha-
1'¢9'm, there is generallyone called a CIca”ah, which is
particularly lofiy. It has two leewa’ns—one.on each
hand of a person entering: one of these is generally
largerthan thenthegandisthe-morehononrablepart.

A portion of the roof of this saloon, the part which is
over the doorcka"ah thatdivides the two leewa’ns, is a
little elevated above the rest; and has, in the centre, a
small lantern, called mem’1-uclc, the sides of which are
composed of lattice-work, like the windows before de-
scribed.and support a cupola. The doorcka”ah is com-
monly without a fountain; but is often paved in a
similar manner to that of the mun’dar’ah; which the
cka”ah also resembles in having a handsome soof’feh,
and cupboards of curious panel-work. There is besides,
in this and some other apartments, a narrow shelf of
wood, extending along two or each of the three walls
which bound the leewa'n, about seven feet or more from
the floor, just above the cupboards; but interrupted
'
in some parts—at least in those parts where the win-
dows are placed: upon thisare arranged several vessels
of china, not so much for general use as for ornament".
All the apartments are lofiy,generallyfourteen feet or
more in height; but the cka”ah is the largest and most
loflyroom, and in a large house it is a noble saloon. ‘
In several of the upper rooms, in the houses of the
‘wealthy,there are, besides the windows of lattice-work,
othersof coloured glass,representing bunches of flowers,
peacocks,and other gay and gaudy objects, or merely
fanciful patterns, which have a pleasing effect. These
coloured glass windows, which are termed cImm’aree’-
yells, are mostly from a foot and a half to two feet and
a halfin height, and from one to two feet in width; and

most persons wear a soodeg/ree, which is a short vest of
cloth, or of striped coloured silk and cotton, without
sleeves. Over the shirt and the soodey’ree, or ~

divided from a point a little above the wrist, or about
the middle of the fore-arm ; so that the hand is gene-
rally exposed, thoughit may be concealed by the sleeve
when necessary ; for it is customary to cover the hands
in the presence of a person of high rank. Round this
vest is wound the girdle (hheza’m),which is a coloured
shawl,or along piece of white figured muslin. The
ordinary outer robe is a long cloth coat, of any colour

gib’beh), the sleeves of which reach not quite to.the

wearer’s name: the name is accompaniedby the words
“his servant” (signifying “the servant, or worshipper
of God"),and often by other words expressive of the
person's' trust in God, &c.* The Prophetdisapproved
of gold; therefore few Moos’lims wear gold rings; but
the women have various ornaments (rings, bracelets,
&c.) of thatprecious metal. The seal-ring is used for
signing letters and other writings; and its impression is
considered more valid thanthesign-manual1-. A little
ink is dabbed upon it with one of the fingers. and it is
pressed upon the paper—the person who uses it having

more full than the ’abba’yeh, of black or deep-blue ’

Several different forms of turhans are represented in
some of the engravingswhich illustrate thiswork. The
Moos’lims are distinguished by the colours of their
turbans from the Copts and the Jews, who (as well as
other subjects of the Turkish Soolta’n who are not V’
Moos’lims) wear black,blue, grey, or light-brown tur-
bans,and generallydull-coloured dresses. The distinc- -
tion ofsects,families,dynasties,&c.,amongtheMoos’lim
Arabs, by the colour of the turban and other articles of
dress, is of very early origin. When the Ima'm Ibra-
hee’m lb’n Mohham’mad, asserting his pretensions to
the dignity of Khalee’feh1-, was put to death by the
Oom’awee Khalee’feh Murwa’n, many persons of the
familyof El-'Abba’s assumed black clothing,in testi-
mony of their sorrow for his fate ; and hence the black
dress and turban (which latter is now characteristic,
almost solely,of Christian and Jewish tributariesto the
’0sma'nlee, or Turkish, Soolta’n) became the distin-‘
guishing costume of the ’Abba’see Khalee'fehs, and of
their officers. When an oflicer under this dynasty was
disgraced,he was made to wear a white dress. White
was adopted. by the false prophet Moocka.n’na',to dis-

hy some men, but more commonlyby women, in the account of
whose dress it will be further described: the men throw it our

chair (calledkoor’sea el-’eraa’meh) on whichit is placed
at night. This is often sent with the furniture of a
bride. It is common fbr a lady to have one upon
which to phce her head-dress. This kind of chair is
never used for any other purpose. As an instance of

was formerly used for painting the edges of the eye-

however,seen thisancient mode practisedin thepresent
day in the neighbourhood of Cairo; though I only
remember to have noticed it in two instances. The
same custom existed among the ancient Greek ladies
and among the Jewish women in early times‘. The
eyes of the Egyptian women are generally the most
beautiful of their features. Countenances altogether
handsome are far less common among this race than
handsome figures; but I have seen among them faces
distinguished by a styleof beautypossessing such sweet-
ness of expression, thattheyhave struck me as exhi-
bitingtheperfection of female loveliness, and impressed

me with the idea (perhaps not false) that their equals
could not be found in any other country: with such
eyes as many of them have, the face must be hand-
some, if its other features be but moderately well
formed *. The nose is generallystraight: the lips are
mostly rather fuller than those of the men, but not in
the least degree partaking of the negro character. The
hair is of that deep, glossyblack,which best suits all’
but fair complexions: in some instances it is rather
coarse and crisp, but never woolly.
The females of the higher and middle classes, and
many of the poorer women, stain certain parts of their
hands and feet (which are, with very few exceptions,
(
use or HEEN'NA. '45
beautifullyformed) with the leaves of the hhen'na-
l:ree*, which impart a yellowish red, or deep orange
‘colour. Many thus dye only the nails of the fingers
-and toes; others extend the dye as high as the first
joint of each finger and toe ; some also make a stripe
along the next row of joints; and there are several
otherfanciful modes of applyingthe hhen’na ; but the
most common practice is to dye the tips of the fingers
and toes as high as the first joint, and the whole of the
inside of the hand and the sole of the foot-1-; adding,
-though not always, the stripe above~mentioned along
the middle joints of the fingers, and a similar stripe a
iittie above thetoes. The hhen’na is prepared for this
use merely by being powdered and mixed with a little
water, so as to form a paste. Some of this paste being
spread in the palm of the hand, and on other parts of
it which are to be dyed, and the fingers beingdoubled,
,
and their extremities inserted into ‘the paste in the
palm, the whole hand is tightlybound with linen, and
remains thus during a whole night. In a similar
‘manner it is applied to the feet. The colour does not
disappearuntilafier many days: it is generallyrenewed
after about a fortnight or three weeks. This custom
prevails not only in Egypt, but in several other coun-
'tries of the East, which are supplied with hhen’na from
the banks of the Nile. To the nails, the hhen’na
imparts a more bright, clear, and permanent colour
than to the skin. When this dye alone is appliedto
the nails,or to a larger portion of the ‘lingers and toes,

it may, with some reason, be regarded as an embellish-
ment ; for it makes the general complexion of thehand
and foot appear more delicate; but many ladies stain
their hands in a manner much less agreeable to our
taste: by applying,immediately after the removal of
the paste of hhen’na, anotherpaste composed of quick-
lime, common smoke-black,and linseed-oil, theycon-
vert the tint of the hhen’na to a black,or to a blackish
'
olive hue. Ladies in Egypt are often seen with their
nails stained with this colour, or with their fingers of
the same dark hue from the extremity to the first joint,
red from the first to the second joint, and of the former
colour from the second to the thirdjoint; withthe palm
also stained in a similar manner, having a broad, dark
stripe across the middle, and the rest left red; the
thumb dark from the extremity to the first joint, and
red from the first to the second joint. Some, after a.
more simple fashion, blacken the ends of the fingers
and the whole of the inside of the hand.
Among the females of the lower orders, in the coun-
try-towns and villagesof Egypt, and among the same
classes in the metropolis. but in a less degree, prevails
a. custom somewhat similarto that above described: it
consists in makingindelible marks of a blue or greenish
hue upon the face and other parts, or, at least, upon
the front of the chin, and upon the back of the right
hand, and often also upon the left hand, the right arm.
or both arms, the feet, the middle of the bosom, and
the forehead: the most common of these marks made
upon the chin and hands are here represented. The
operation is performed with several needles (generally
seven) tied together: with these the skin is pricked in

the desired pattern: some smoke-black (of wood or
oil), mixed with milk from the breast of a woman, is
thenrubbed in; and about a week after, before the skin
has healed, a paste of the pounded fresh leaves of white
beet or clover is applied, and gives a blue or greenish
colour to the marks. It is generallyperformed at the
age of about five or six years, and by gipsy-women.
The term applied to it is duck’ck. Most of the females
of the higher parts of Upper Egypt, who are of a very
dark complexion, tattoo their lips instead of the parts
above-mentioned; thus convertingtheir natural colour
to a dull, bluish hue, which, to the eye of a stranger, is
extremely displeasing“‘.
Another characteristic of the Egyptian women that
should be here mentioned,is their upright carriage and
gait. This is most remarkablein thefemale peasantry,
owing, doubtless, in a great measure, to their habit of
bearing a heavy earthen water-veed, and other bur-
thens,upon the head.
The dress of the women of the middle and higher
orders is handsome and elegant. Their shirt is very
full, likethat of the men ; but rathershorter; reaching
not quite to the knees: it is also, generally, of the
same kind of material as the men's shirt, or of coloured
crape; sometimes black. A pair of very wide trousers

and cotton, or of printed, or worked, or plain white
muslin, is tied round the hips, under the shirt, witha.
dik’keh: its lower extremities are drawn up and tied
just below the knee with running strings; but it is sulfi-
ciently long to hang down to the feet, or almost to the
ground, when attached in this manner. .Over the shirt
and shintiya/nis worn a_ long vest (called yel'ek),of the
same material as the latter: it nearly resembles the
ckoofta’n of the men; but is more tight to the body
and arms: the sleeves also are longer; and it is made
to button down the front, from the bosom to a little
below the girdle, instead of lapping over: it is open,
likewise, on each side, from the height of the hip,
downwards. In general, the yel’ek is cut in such a.
manner as to leave half of thebosom uncovered, except
by the shirt; but many ladies have it made more ample
at that part; and, according to the most approved
fashion, it should be of a suflicient lengthto reach to
the ground, or should exceed that length by two or
three inches, or more. A short vest (called ’an’ter’ee),
reachingonly a little below the waist, and exactly re-
sembling a yel’ek of which the lower part has been cut
off, is sometimes worn instead of the latter. A square
shawl, or an embroidered kerchief, doubled diagonally,
is put loosely round the waist as a girdle; the two cor-
ners that are folded together hanging down behind.
Over the yel’ek is worn a gib’heh of cloth,or velvet, or
silk, usually embroidered with gold or with coloured
silk: it differs in form from the gib’beh of the men
chiefly in being not so wide; particularly in the fore
part’. Instead of this,ajacket(called .s'al’tah), gene-

rally of clothor velvet, and embroidered in the same
manner as the gib’beh,is often worn. The head-dress
consists of a ta’ckee’yeh and turboo'sh, with a square
kerchief (called far’oo’dee’yeh) of printed or painted
muslin, or one of crape, wound tightly round, com-
posing what is called a rub’tah. Two or more such
kerchiefs were commonlyused, a short time since, and
are still sometimes, to form the ladies’ turban, but
alwayswound in a high, flat shape, very dilfereut from
thatof the turban of the men. A kind of crown, called
ckoor’a, and other ornaments, are attached to theladies’
head-dress: descriptions and engravingsof these and
otherornaments of the women of Egypt will be found
in the Appendix to this work. A long piece of white
muslin embroidered at each end with coloured silks
and gold, or of coloured crape ornamented with gold _
thread,lama, and spangles, rests upon the head, and
hangs down behind, nearly or quite to the ground : this
is called ta1’hhah—it is the head-veil: the face-veil I
shall presently describe. The hair, excepting over the
forehead and temples, is divided into numerous braids
or plaits, generally from eleven to twenty—five in
number,but alway of an uneven number: these hang
down the back. To each braid of hair are usually
added three black silk cords, with little ornaments of
gold, &c., attached to them. For a description of these,
which are called :uf’a, I refer to the Appendix. Over
the forehead,the hair is cut rather short; but two full
locks (called muck'a’see’s) hang down on each side of
the face: these are often curled in ring-lets, and some-
times plaited‘. Few of the ladies of Egypt wear

-generallyfrom four to nine inches in height,and usually
ornamentedwith mother-of-pearl,or silver, &c. These
are always used in the bath by men and women; but

the whole of the face except the eyes, and reaching

covers herself with a hhalflarah,which, for a married
lady, is composed of two breadths of glossy, black
silk, each ell-wide, and three yards long: these are
sewed togetherat or near the selvages (accordingto the
height of the person); the seam running horizontally,
withrespect to the manner in which it is worn : a piece
of narrow,black riband is sewed inside the upper part,
about six inches from the edge, to tie round the head.
This covering is always worn in the manner shown by
the accompanyingsketch. The unmarried ladies wear
a hhab’arah of white silk, or a shawl. Some females
of the middle classes, who cannot aflbrd to purchase
a hhab’arah, wear instead of it an eeza’r ; which
is a piece of white calico, of the same form and size
as the former, and is worn in the same manner. On
the feet are worn short boots or socks (called khoofi),
of yellow morocco, and over those,the ba’boo’g.
This dress, though chieflydesigned for females of
the higher classes, who are seldom seen in public on
foot, is worn by many women who cannot often afford
so far to imitate their superiors as to hire an ass to

deficient in grace: we must remark, however, that, in
one respect, it fails in accomplishingits main purpose;
displayingthe eyes, which are almost alwaysbeautiful;
making them to appear still more so by concealingthe
other features, which are seldom of equal beauty; and
often causing the stranger to imagine a defective face
perfectly charming. The veil is of very remote anti-

ancient Egyptians, it seems not to have been worn by
the females of thatnation.
The dress of a large proportion of those women of
the lower orders who are not of thepoorest class con-
sists of a pair of trousers or drawers (similar in form
to the shintiya’n of the ladies, but generally of plain
white cotton or linen), a blue linen or cotton shirt (not
quite so full as that of the men), a boor’cko’ of a kind
of coarse black crape, and a. dark blue tsr’hhah of
muslin or linen. Some wear, over the shirt, or instead
of the latter, a linen to’b, of the same form as thatof
the ladiesf. The sleeves of this are often turned up
over the head; either to prevent their being incomme-
dious, or to supply the place of a tar’hhaht. In addi-
tion to these articles of dress, many women who are not
of the very poor classes, wear, as a covering, a kind of
plaid, similar in form to the hhab’arah, composed of
two pieces of cotton, woven in small chequers of blue
and white, or cross stripes. with a mixture of red at
eachend. It is called 1m'la’yeh: in general it is worn
in the same manner as the hhab’arah; but sometimes
like the .tar’lihah §. The upper part of the black
boor’cko’ is often ornamented with false pearls, small
gold coins, and other little flat ornaments of the same

The best kind of shoes worn by the females of the

lower orders are of red morocco, turned up, but round,
at the toes. The boor’cko’ and shoes are most common
in Cairo, and are also worn by many of the women
throughout Lower Egypt; but in Upper Egypt, the
boor’cko’ is very seldom seen, and shoes are scarcely
less uncommon. To Supply the place of the former,
when necessary, a portion of the tar’hhah is drawn
before the face, so as to conceal nearlyall the counte-
nance excepting one eye. Many of the women of
the lower orders, even in the metropolis, never conceal
their faces. Throughout the greater part of Egypt the
most common dress of the women merely consists of
the blue shirt or to’b and tar-’hhah. In the southern
parts of Upper Egypt, chiefly above Akhmee’m, most
of the women envelop themselves in a large piece of
dark brown woollen stuff (called a hhoolalee’_1/eh);
wrapping it round the body, and attachingthe upper
parts togetherover each shoulder; and a piece of the
same theyuse as a tar’hhah. This dull dress, though
picturesque, is almost as disguising as the blue tinge
which, as I have before mentioned, the women in these

parts of Egypt impart to their lips. Most of the
women of the lower orders wear a variety of trnmpery
ornaments, such as ear-rings, necklaces.bracelets,&c.,
and sometimes a nose-ring‘. Descriptions and engrav-
ings of some of these ornaments will be given in the
Appendix.
The women of Egypt deem it more incumbentupon
them to cover the upper and back part of the head
than the face; and more requisite to conceal the face
than most other parts of the person. I have often seen
in this country women but half covered with miserable
rags; and several times, females in the prime of wo-
manhood, and others in more advanced age, with only
a narrow strip of rag bound round the hips.

Ir was a custom very common in Egypt, as in other
Moos’lim countries, to consult an astrologer previously
to giving a name to a child, and to be guided by his
choice; but very few persons now conform with this
old usage: the father makes choice of a name, and
confers it without any ceremony. Boys are ofien
named after the Prophet (Mohham’mad,Ahh'mad, or
Moos’tuf’a), or some of the members of his family
(’Al’ee, Hhas’an, I-Ihosey’n, &c.), or his eminent
companions (‘0m’ar, Ab’ooBekr. ’Osma'n,’Amr, &c.),

orders is similar to that of the parents, but generally
slovenly. The children of the poor are either clad in a
shirt and a cotton skull-cap or a turboo’sh, or (as is
mostly the case in the villages) are left quite naked
until the age of six or seven years or more, unless a
bit of rag can be easily obtained to serve them as
a partial covering. Those little girls who have only a
piece of ragged stuff not large enough to cover both
the head and body, generally prefer wearing it upon
the head, and sometimes have the coquetry to draw_ a
part of it before the face, as a veil, while the whole
body is exposed. Little ladies, four or five years of
age, mostly wear the white face-veil,like their mothers.
When a boy is two or three years old, or often earlier,
his head is shaved ; a tuft of hair only beinglet! on the
crown, and another over the forehead‘: the heads of
female infants are seldom shaven. The young children,
of both sexes, are usually carried by their mothers and
nurses, not in the arms, but on the shoulder, seated
astride-|-, and sometimes,for a short distance, on thehip.
In the treatment of their children, the women of the
Ammoo’neh, Futoot’meh, Zennoo’beh,and Nefi‘oo’seh; and some
other names are changed to the same measure as these; which
measure implies,in thesecases, a superior degree of dignity.
” It is customary among the peasants throughouta great part
of Egypt, on the first occasion of shaving a child'shead, to slay
a victim, generallya goat, at the tomb of some saint in or near
theirvillage, and to make a feast with the meat, of which their
friends, and any other persons who please, partake. This is
most common in Upper Egypt, and among the tribes not very long
established on the banks of the Nile. Their Pagan ancestors in
Arabia observed this custom, and usually gave, as alias to the
"poor, the weight of the hair in silver. The victim was called
’gci¢e'clala.

from weaning her child before the expiration of two

it beingthe custom of all thewomen to sit astride. But
it is seldom that the children of the rich. enjoy this
slight diversion; their health suffers from confinement
and pampering,and they are often rendered capricious,
proud, and selfish. The women of the middle classes
are scarcely less indulgent mothers. The estimation in
which the wife is held by her husband, and even by her
ncquaintance, depends, in a great degree, upon her
fruitfulness, and upon the preservation ofsher children;
for by men and women, rich and poor, barrenness is
still considered, in the East, a curse and a reproach;
and it is regarded as disgraceful in a man to divorce,
without some cogent reason, a wife who has borne him
a child, especiallywhile her child is living. If, therea-

With theexception of those of the wealthier classes,
the children in Egypt, though objects of so much
solicitude, are generally very dirty, and shabbilyclad.

The stranger here is disgusted by the sight of them,
and at once condemns the modern Egyptians as a very

forming such an opinion of them; but it is often the
case that those children who are most petted and be
loved are the dirtiest, and worst clad. It is not uncom-
mon to see, in the city in which I am writing, a lady
shuiflingalong in her ample to’b and hhah’arah of new
and rich and glistening silks, and one who scents the
whole street with the odour of musk or civet as she
passes along, with all that appears ot' her person

dered with kohhl applied in the most careful manner,
and the tip of a finger or two showing the fresh dye of
the hhen’na, and by her side a littleboy or girl, her own
child,witha face besmearedwithdirt, and with clothes
appearing as thoughthey had been worn for months
without beingwashed. Few things surprised me so
much as sights of this kind on my first arrival in this
country. I naturallyinquired the cause of what struck

thatthe affectionate mothers thus neglected the appear-
ance of their children, and purposely left them un.
washed, and clothed them so shabbily,particularlywhen
they had to take them out in public, from fear of the
evileye, which is excessively dreaded, and especially in
the case of children, since they are generally esteemed
the greatest of blessings, and therefore most likely to
be coveted.
The children of the poor have a yet more neglected
appearance: besides beingvery scantily clad, or quite
naked, they are, in general, excessively dirty; their
eyes are frequently extremelyfilthy;it is common to
see half-a-dozen or more flies in each eye unheeded and
unmolested. The parents consider it extremely inju-
rious to wash, or even touch, the eyes, when they dis-
charge thatacrid humour which attracts the flies : they
even aflirm that the loss of sight would result from
frequently touching or washing them when thus
alfected; though washing is really one of the best
means of alleviatingthe complaint.
At the age of about five or six years, or sometimes
later, the boy is circumcised‘. Previouslyto the per-
formance of this rite in the metropolis and other towns
of Egypt, the parents of the youth, if not in indigent
circumstances, generally cause him to be paraded
through several streets in the neighbourhood of their
dwelling. They mostly avail themselves’ of the occur-
rence of abridal procession to lessen the expenses of
the parade: and, in this case, the boy and his attend-
ants lead the procession. He generally wears a red

and other female ornaments". These articles of dress
are of therichest description that can be procured: they
are usually borrowed ‘from some lady, and much too
large to fit the boy. A horse, handsomely caparisoned,
is also borrowed to convey him; and in his hand is
placed a folded embroidered handkerchief, which he
constantly holdsbefore his mouth in his right hand.
He is preceded by a servant of the barber,who is the
operator, and by three or more musicians, whose instru-
ments are commonly a hautboyand drums. The fore-
most person in the procession is generally the harber’s
servant, bearinghis hheml, which is a case of wood, of
a semi-cylindricalform, with four short legs; its front
(the flat surface) covered with pieces of looking-glass
and embossed brass; and its back,with a curtain. This
is merely -the barber’s sign: the servant carries it in
the manner represented in the engravinghere inserted.
The musicians follow next (or some of them precede
the hheml), and then follows the boy; his horse led by
a groom. Behind him walk several of his‘ femalerela-
tions and friends. Two boys are often paraded toge-
ther, and sometimes borne by one horse. Of the bridal
processions, with which thatabove described is so often

The parents seldom devote much‘ of their time «I
attention to the education of their children; generally
contenting themselves with instilling into their young
minds a few principles of religion, and then submitting
them,if theycan afford to do so, to the instruction of
a schoolmaster. As earlyasposeible,the child is taught
to say, “ I testify thatthere is no deity but God; and I
testify that l(ohham’mad is God's Apostle.” He re-
ceives also lessons of religious pride, and learns to hate
the Christians, and all other sects but his own, as tho~
roughly as does the Moos’lim in advanced age. Most
of the childrenof the higher and middle classes, and
some of those of the lower orders, are taught by the
schoolmaster to read, and to recite the whole or certain
portions of the Ckoor-a'n by memory. They ailer-
wards learn the most common rules of arithmetic.
Schools are very numerous, not only in the metro-
polis, but in every large town; and there is one, at
least, in every considerable village. Almost every
mosque, sebee’l (or public fountain),_aud hho’d (or
drinking-placefor cattle) in the metropolis has a hoot-
ta’b (or school) attached to it, in which children are
instructed for a very trifling expense; the rheylzh or

receives yearly a turboo’sh, a piece.of white muslin for
a turban, a piece of linen, and a pair of shoes; and
each boy receives, at the same time, a. linen skull-cap,
four or five cubits1- of cotton cloth, and perhaps halfa
piece (ten or twelve cubits) of linen, and a pair of
shoes, and, in some cases, half a piaster or a piaster.
These presents are supplied by funds bequeathedto the
school, and are given in the monthof Rum’ada’n. The
boys attend only during the hours of instruction, and
then return to their homes. The lessons are generally
written upon tablets of wood, painted white; and when

one lesson is learnt, the tablet is washed and another is
written. They also practise writing upon the same
tablet. The schoolmaster and his pupils sit upon the
ground,and each boy has his tablet in his hands, or a
copy of the Ckoor-a’n, or of one of its thirty sections,
on a little kind of desk of palm-sticks. All who are
learningto read recite their lessons aloud, at the same
time, rocking their heads and bodies incessantlyback-
wards and forwards; which practice is observed by
almost all persons in reading the Ckoor-a’n; being
thought to assist the memory. The noise may be
imagined*.
The boys first learn the letters of the alphabet; next,
thevowel points and other orthographical marks; and
then, the numericalvalue of each letter of thealphabet-1-.
Previouslyto this third stage of the pupil’sprogress, it
is customary for the master to ornament the tablet with
blackand red ink, and green paint, and to write upon
it the letters of the alphabet in the order of their
respective numerical values, and convey it to -the father,
who returns it with a piaster or two placed upon it.
The like is also done at several subsequent stages of
the boy's progress, as when he begins to learn the
Ckoor-a’n, and six or seven times as he proceeds in
learning the sacred book; each time the next lesson
being written on the tablet. When he has become
acquainted with the numerical values of the letters, the
master writes for him some simple words, as the names
of men; then the ninety-nine names or epithets of

mory. He then proceeds to learn the.otherchapters of
the Ckoor-a’n: afler thefirst chapter he learns the last;-
then the last but one; next the last but two, and soon,
in inverted order, ending withthe second; as the chap-
ters in general successively decrease in lengthfrom the
second to the last inclusively. It is seldom that the
master of a school teaches writing; and few boyslearn
to write unless destined for some employment which
absolutely requires that they should do so; in which
latter case theyare generallytaught the art of writing,
and likewise arithmetic, by a clzabba’nee, who is a.
person employed to weigh goods in a marketor be/za’r,
with the steelyard; Those who are to devote themselves
to religion; or to any of the learned professions, mostly
pursue a regular course of study in the great mosque

The schoolmasters in Egypt are mostly persons of
very little learning: few of them are -acquainted with
any writings except the Ckoor-a’n, and certain prayers,
which, as well as the contents of the sacred volume,
theyare hired to recite on particular occasions. I was
lately told of a man who could neitherread not write
succeeding to the office of a schoolmaster in my neigh-
bourhood. Being able to recite the whole of the
Ckoor-a’n, he could hear the boys repeat their lessons :
to write them, he employed the ’aree’f(or head boy in-
theschool), pretending that his eyes were weak. A few
days alter he had taken upon himself this office, a poor
woman brought a letter for him to read to her from her
EARLY EDUCATION. 57
son, who had gone on pilgrimage. The fick’ee pre-
tended to read it, but said nothing; and the woman,
inferringfrom his silence that the letter contained bad
news, said to him, “Shall ‘I shriek?” He answered
'9 Yes.” “ Shall I tear my clothes?” she asked; he re-
plied “ Yes.” So the poor woman returned to her
house, and with her assembled friends performed the
lamentation and otherceremonies usual on the occasion
of a death. Not many days after thisher son arrived,
and she asked him what he could mean by causing a
letter to bewritten stating that he was dead. He ex-
plained the contents of the letter, and she went to the
schoolmaster and begged him to inform her why he had
told her to shriek and to tear her clothes, since the
letter was to inform her that her son was well, and he
was now arrived at home. Not at all abashed, he said,
“ God knows futurity! How could I know that your
son would arrive in safety? It was better that you
should thinkhim dead than be led to expect to see him
and perhaps be disappointed.” Some persons who
were sitting with him praised his wisdom, exclaiming,
“
Truly, our new fick’ee is a man of unusual judg-
ment!” and, for a little while, he found that he had
raised his reputation by this blunder.
Some parents employ a sheykh or fick'ee to teach
their boys at home. The father usually teaches his
son to perform the woodoo’ and other ablutions, and to
say his prayers, and instructs him in otherreligious and
moral duties to the best of his ability. The Prophet
directed his followers to order their childrento say their
prayers when seven years of age, and to beat them if
theydid not do so when ten years old; and at the latter

age to make them sleep in separate beds: in Egypt,
however. very few persons pray before they have
attained to manhood.
The female children a1-every seldom taught to read
or write; and not many of them,even among the higher
orders, learn to say their prayers. Some of the
rich engage a she_1/khah (or learned woman) to visit
the hharee’m daily, to teach their daughters and female
slaves to say their prayers, and to recite a few chapters
of the Ckoor~a’n. and sometimes to instruct them in
reading and -writing; but these are very rare accom-
plishments for females even of the highest class in
Egypt‘. There are many schools in which girls are
taught plain needle-work,embroidery, &c. In families
in easy circumstances a m’al’l2'm’eh-I-, or female teacher
of such kinds of work, is often engaged to attend the
girls at their own home.
However much the son is caressed and fondled, in
general he feels and manifests a most profound and
praiseworthyrespect for his parents. Disobedience to
parents is considered by the Moos’lims as one of the
greatest of sins, and classed, in point of heinonsness,
with six other sins, which are idolatry, murder, falsely
accusing modest women of adultery, wasting the pro-
perty of orphans, taking usury, and desertion in an
expedition against intidels. Au uudutiful child is very
seldom heard of among the Egyptians or the Arabs in

general. Sons scarcely ever sit, or eat, or smoke, in
the presence of the father, unless bidden to do so;
and they often even wait upon him and upon his guests
at meals and on other occasions: theydo not cease to
act thus when theyhave become men. I once break-
fasted with an Egyptian merchant, before the door of
his house, in the month of Rum’ada’n (and therefore a
little after sunset) ; and thoughevery person who passed
by. however poor, was invited to partake of the meal,
we were waited upon by two of my host's sons; the
elder about forty years of age. As they had been
fasting during the whole of the day, and had as yet
only taken adraughtof water, I begged the father to
allow them to sit down and eat with us: he imme-
diately told them that they might do so; but they de-
clined. The mothers generally enjoy, in a greater
degree than the fathers, the affection of their children;
but do not receive from them the same outward marks
of respect. I have often known servants to hoard
their wages for their mothers, though seldom for their
fathers.

CHAPTER III.
RELIGION AND LAWS.
As the most important branch of their education, and
the main foundation of their manners and customs,
the religion and laws of the people who‘ are the subject
of these pages must be well understood,—not only in
their general principles, but in many minor points,-
before we can proceed to consider their social condi-
tion and habits in the state of manhood.
A difference of opinion among Moos’lims,respecting
some points of religion and law, has given rise to four
sects, which consider each other orthodox as to funda-
mental matters. These sects are the I-Ihan/afees,
Sha’fe’ees, Ma'likees"‘, and Hham’bel’ees,——so called
from the names of the respective doctors whose tenets
they have adopted. The Turks are of the first sect,
which is the most reasonable: the inhabitantsof Cairo,
a small proportion excepted (who are Hhan’a.fees),are
either Sha’fe’ees or Ma’likees; and it is generallysaid
theyare mostly of the former of these sects, as are also
the people of Arabia: those of the Shurckee’yeh, on the
east of the Delta, Sha’fe’ees : those of theGhurbee'yeh,
or Delta, Sha’fe’ees,with a few Ma’likees: those of the
Bohhey’reh, on thewest of the Delta, Ma'likees: the in-
" Commonlypronounced Ma’l’fiee.
RELIGION. 71
habitants of the Sa’ee’d, or thevalley of Upper Egypt,
are likewise, with few exceptions, Mb/likees: so also
are the Nubians, and the Western Arabs. To the
fourth sect,very few persons in the present day belong.
The Mohhammadan religion is generallycalled by
the Arabs, el-I.rla.'m. Eema’n and Deen are the parti-
cular terms applied, respectively,to faithand practical
religion.
’
The grand principles of the faith are expressed in
two articles; the first of which is this-—
“ There is no deity but God.”
God, who created all thingsin heaven and in earth,
who preserveth all things,and decreeth all things,who
is without beginning, and without end, omnipotent,
omniscient, and omnipresent, is (me. His unity is thus
declared in a short chapter of the Ckoor-a’n“: “
Say,
He is one God; God the Eternal: He neither begets,
nor is He begotten; and thereis none equal unto Him."
He hath no partner, nor any otfspring,in the creed of
the Moos’lim. Though Jesus Christ (whose name
should not be mentioned without adding—“on whom
be peace") is believed to have been born of a pure
virgin, by the miraculous operation of God f, without

of God, which He imparted unto Mary, and a Spirit
proceedingfrom Him”*—yet he is not called theSon of
God ; and no higher titles are given to him than those ‘
of a Prophet. and Apostle : he is even considered as of
inferior dignity to Mohham’mad, inasmuch as the Gos-
pel is held to be superseded by the Ckoor-a’n. The
Moos’lim believes that Seyyid’na. ’Ee’sa1- (or “
our
Lord Jesus”), after he had fulfilledthe object of his
mission, was taken up unto God from the Jews, who
sought to slayhim ; and that another person, on whom
God had stamped the likeness of Christ, was crucified
in his stead 1. He also believes thatChrist is to come
again upon the earth, to establish the Mohhammadan
religion, and perfect peace and security, after having
killed Antichrist, and to be a sign of the approach of
the last day.
The other grand article of the faith,which cannot
bebelievedwithout the former, is this-
“ Mohham’mad is God’: Apostle."
Mohham'mad is believed, by his followers, to have
been the last and greatest of Prophets and Apostles§.
Six of these—namely,Adam, Noah, Abraham,Moses,
Jesus, and Mohham'mad—are believed each to have
received a revealed law, or system of religion and
morality. That,however,which was revealed to Adam
was abrogated by the next; and each succeeding law,

or code of laws, abrogated the preceding: therefore,
those who professed the Jewish religion from the time
of Moses to that of Jesus were true believers; and
those who professed the Christian religion (uncor-
rupted, as the Moos’lims say, by the tenet thatChrist
was the son of God) until the time of Mohham’mad
are held, in like manner, to have been true believers.
But the copies of the Pentateuch, the Psalms of David
(which the Moos’lims also hold to be of divine origin),
and the Gospels now existing, the Mohhamrnadans
believe to have been so much altered as to contain
very little of the true word of God. The Ckoor—a'n,
theybelieve to have suffered no alteration whatever.
It is further necessary, that the Moos’lim should
believe in the existence of angels, and of the devil,
and likewise genii (an intermediate race of beings
between angels and men): also, in the immortality of
the soul, the general resurrection and judgment, in
future rewards and punishments in Paradise‘ and
Hell 1-, in the balance in which good and evil works
shall be weighed, and in the bridge E:-Sim’! (which
extends over the midst of Hell, finer than a hair, and
sharper than the edge of a sword), over which all
must pass, and from which the wicked shall fall into
Hell. He believes,also, that theywho have acknow-
ledged thefaithof Mohham’madand yet actedwickedly
will not remain in Hell for ever; but that all of other
religions must: that there are, however, degrees of
punishments, as well as of rewards,—the former con-
sisting in severe torture by excessive heat and cold,
and the latter, in the indulgence of the appetites by

most delicious meats and drinks, and, above all, by the
company of the girls of Paradise, whose eyes will be
very large and entirely black‘, and whose stature will
be proportioned to thatof the men, which will be the
height of a tall palm-tree, or about sixty feet. Such,
the Moos’lims generallybelieve,was the height of our
first parents. It is said that the souls of martyrs
reside, until the judgment,in the crops of green birds,
which eat of the fruits of Paradise. Women are
not to be excluded from Paradise, according to the
Mohhammadanfaith; thoughit has been asserted, by
many Christians, that the Moos’lims believewomen to
have no souls. In several places in the Ckoor-a'n,
Paradise is promised to all true believers, whether
males or females. It is the doctrine of the Ckoor-a’n
that no person will be admitted into Paradise by his
own merits; but that admission will be granted to the
believers merely by the mercy of God; yet that the
felicity of each person will be proportioned to his
merits. The very meanest in Paradise is promised
“eighty thousand servants” (beautiful youths, called
welee’ds, or -un'lda’n),“seventy-two wives of the girls
of Paradise” (hhoo'ree’_1/ehs, or hhoo’r el-'03/oo'n),
“ besidesthewives he had in thisworld,” if he desire to
have the latter (and the good will doubtless desire the
good), “ and a tent erected for him of pearls, jacinths,
and emeralds, of a very large extent ;" “

in this life, will yet be freely allowed to be drunk in
the next, and without danger, since the wine of Para-
dise will not inebriate'.” We are further told, that all
superfluitiesfrom the bodies of the inhabitantsof Para-
dise will be carried of by perspiration, which will
diffuse an odour like thatof musk; and that theywill
be clothed in the richest silks,chieflyof green. They
are also promised perpetual youth, and children as
many as theymay desire. These pleasures,together
with the songs of the angel Isra’fee’l, and many other
gratifications of the senses, will charm even the
meanest inhabitant of Paradise. But all these enjoy-
ments will be lightlyesteemed by those more blessed
persons who are to be admitted to the highest of all
honours—thatspiritual pleasure ofbeholding,morning
and evening, the face of Godf. The Moos’lim must
also believe in the examination of the dead in -the
sepulchre, by two angels, called Moon’kir and Nekee’r1,
of terrible aspect, who will cause the body (to which
the soul shall, fur the time, be re-united) to sit upright
in the g'rs.ve§, and will question thedeceased respecting
his faith. The wicked theywill severely torture; but
the good they will not hurt. Lastly,he should believe

in God's absolute decree of every event, both good and
evil. This doctrine has given rise to as much con-
troversy among the Moos’lims as among Christians;
but the former, generally,believein predestinationas,
in some respects, conditional.
In religious practice,the most important duties are
prayer, aims-giving,fasting,and pilgrimage.
The religious puréfications,which are of two kinds,
first, the ordinary ahlution preparatory to prayer, and
secondly,the washingof the whole body,togetherwith
the performance of the former ahlution, are of primary
importance: for prayer, which is a duty so important
that it is called “the Key of Paradise," will not be
acceptedfrom a person in a state of uncleanness. It is
therefore also necessary to avoid impurity by clipping
the nails, shaving the head, and other similar prac-
tices*.
There are partial washings, or purifications,which
all Moos’lims perform on certain occasions, even if
theyneglecttheir prayers, and which are considered as
-religious acts1-. The ahlution called el-woodoo’, which
is preparatory to prayer, I shall now describe. The
zpurifications just before alluded to are a -part of the
voodoo’: the other washings are not, of necessity, to
be performed immediately after, but only when the
person is about to say his prayers; and these are per-
formed in the mosque or in the house, in public or in
private. There is in every mosque a tank (called
meg/da-ah), or a hhanafee’yeh,which is a raised re-
" Alluded to in the first chapter.

which require their performance, thereader may consult Reland,

servoir, with spouts round it, from which the water
falls. In some mosques there are both these. The
Moos’lims of the Hhan’afee sect (of which are the
Turks) perform the ablution at the latter (which has
received its name from that cause); for theymust. do
it with runningwater, or from a tank or pool at least
ten cubits in breadth,and the same in depth; and I
believe that there is only one ‘mey’da-ah in Cairo of
that depth,which is in the great mosque E1-Az’har.
A small hhanafee’yeh of tinned copper, placed on a
low shelf, and a large basin, or a small ewer and basin
of the same metal, are generally used in the house for
the performance of the woodoo’.

The person, having tucked up his sleeves a little
higher than his elbows, says, in a low voice, or in-
audibly, “I purpose performing the woodoo/, for
prayer"‘." He then washes his hands three times;
saying, in the same manner as before, “
In the name
of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful ! Praise be
to God, who hath given water for purification, and
made el-Isla/m to be a light and a direction, and a
.
guide to thygardens, the gardens of delight, and to
thymansion, the mansion of peace.” Then he rinses
his month three times, throwingthe water into it with
his right hand 1; and in doing this he says, “
0 God,
assist me in the reading of thybook, and in commemo-
ratingThee, and in thankingThee, and in thebeautyof
thyworship.” Next, with his right hand, he throws
water up his nostrils (snufiingit up at the same time),
and then blows it out, compressing his nostrils with
the thumband finger of the leflhand; and this also
is done three times. While doing it, he says, "
0 God,
make me- to smell the odours of Paradise, and bless
me withits delights; and make me not to smell the
smell of the fires [of Hell]." He then washes his
face three times, throwing up the water with both
hands, and saying, “ 0 God, whiten my face with thy
light, on theday when Thou shalt whiten the faces of
thy favourites; and do not blacken my face, on the
day when Thou shalt blacken the faces of thine ene-
mies.” His right hand and arm, as high as the elbow,

he next washes three times, and as many times causes
some water to run along his arm, from the palm of the
hand to the elbow, saying, as he does this, “

give me my book in my right hand’; and reckon with
me with a slight reckoning.” In the some manner
he washes the left hand and arm, saying, “0 God,
do not give me my book in my left hand, nor behind
my back; and do not reckon with me with a diflicult
reckoning; nor make me to be one of the people of
the fire.” He next draws his wetted right hand over
the upper part of his head, raising his turban or cap
with his left: thishe does but once; and accompanies
the action with this supplication,“ 0 God, cover me
with thy mercy, and pour down thyblessing upon me;
and shade me under the shadow of thycanopy,on the
day when there shall be no shade but its shade." If
he have a heard, he then combs it with the wetted
fingers of his right hand ; holding his hand with the
palm forwards, and passing the fingers through his
heard from the throatupwards. He thenputs the tips
of his fore-fingers into his ears, and twists them round,
passing his thumbsat the same time round the back
of the ears, from the bottom upwards; and saying,
“O God, make me to be of those who hear what is
_
said, and obey what is best ;” or, “
O God, make me
to hear good." Next he wipes his neck with the back
of the fingers of both hands, making the ends of his
fingers meet behind his neck, and then drawing them
forward ; and in doing so, he says, “ 0 Goth free my
neck from the.tire; and keep me from the chains, and

the collars, and the fetters.” Lastly, he-washes his
feet, as high as the ankles, and passes his fingers
betweenthe toes: he washes the right foot first, saying,
at the same time, “ O God, make firm my foot upon
the Sira’t, on the day when feet shall slip upon it :" on
washing the left foot, he says, “O God, make my
walkingto be approved, and my sin forgiven, and my
works accepted, merchandise that shall not perish, by
thy pardon, 0 Mighty! O Forgiver! by thy ‘mercy,
0 most Merciful of those who show mercy!” After
having thus completed the ablation, he says, looking
towards heaven, “ Thine absolute glory, O God!
[I assert] with thy praise: I testify that there is no
deity but Thee alone: Thou hast no companion: I
implore thyforgiveness, and turn to Thee with repent-
ance.” -
Then, looking towards the earth, he adds, “ I
testify that there is no deity but God: and I testify
that Mohham'mad is his servant and his apostle.”
Having uttered these words, he should recite, once, -
twice, or three times, the Soo’ra.t el-Ckudr, or 97th
chapter of the Ckoor-a’n.
The woodoo’ is generallyperformed in less than two
minutes; most persons hurrying through the act, as
well as omitting almost all the prayers, &c., which
should accompany and follow the actions. It is not
required before each of the five dailyprayers, when the
person is conscious of having avoided every kind of
impurity since the last performance of this ablution.
When water cannot be easily procured, or would be
injurious to the health of the individual,he may per-
form the ablation with dust or sand. This ceremony
is called ieyem’moom. The person, in this case,
strikes the palms of his hands upon any dry dust or
sand (it will suflice to do so upon his cloth robe, as it
RELIGION. 8I
must contain some dust), and, with both hands, wipes
his face: then,havingstruck his hands again upon the
dust, he wipes his right hand and arm as high as the
elbow ; and then, the left hand and arm, in the same
manner. This completes the ceremony. The washing
of the whole body is often performed merely for
the sake of cleanliness; but not as a religious act,
excepting on particular occasions—as on the morning
of Friday,and on the two grand festivals, &c.", when
it is called ghoos’l.
Cleanliness is required not only in the worshipper,
but also in the ground, mat, carpet, robe, or whatever
else it be, upon which he prays. Persons of the lower
orders ofien pray upon the bare ground, which is con-
sidered clean if it be dry; and theyseldom wipe off
immediately the dust which adheres to the nose and
forehead in prostration, for it is regarded as oma-
mental to the believer's face; but when a person has
a cloak or any other garment that he can take off
withoutexposing his person in an unbecomingmanner,
he spreads it upon the ground to serve_ as a prayer-
carpet. The rich use a prayer-carpet(called segga’deh)
about the size of our hearth-rugs, havinga niche repre-
sented upon it, the point of which is turned towards
Mek’keh-f. It is reckoned sinful to pass near before
a person engaged in prayer.
Prayer is called sal’ah. Five times in the course of

every day is its performance required of the Moos’1im;
but there are comparativelyfew persons in Egypt who
do not sometimes, or often, neglect this duty; and
many who scarcely ever pray. Certain portions of the
ordinary prayers are called find, which are appointed
by the Ckoor-a’n ; and others, soon’neh, which are
appointed by the Prophet, without allegation of a
divine order.
The first time of prayer is the mugh’n'b, or sunset",
or rather, about four minutes later; the second, the
’e.rh’é, or when the eveninghas closed, and it is quite
dark-r; the third, is the soobhli, or fegr; 2'. e., day-

at such times.

tillthey have finished their meal. The prayers should
be said as nearly as possible at the times above men-
tioned: they may be said after, but not before. The
several times of prayer are announced by the moo-
ed’din of each mosque. Having ascended to the
gallery of the ma’d’neI:,or men’a’ret’,he chants the
ada’n, or call to prayer, which is as follows: “
God is
most Great!” (thisis said four times.) “ I testify that
there is no deity but God!" (twice.) “I testify that
Mohham’mad is God's Apostle!” (twice.) “Come
to prayer!" (twice.) “ Come to security!” (twice.)*
“God is most Great !” (twice.) “ There is no deity
but God !”—Most of the moo-ed’dins of Cairo have
harmonious and sonorous voices, which they strain to
the utmost pitch; yet there is a simple and solemn
melody in their chants which is very striking,particu-
larlyin the stillnessof nightt.
Twoother calls to prayer are made during thenight,
to rouse those persons who desire to perform superero-
gatory acts of devotion1. A little after midnight, the
moo-ed'dins of the great royal mosques in Cairo (i. e.,
of each of the great mosques founded by a Soolta’n,
which is called Ga’mé’ Soolta’nee),and of some other
large mosques, ascend the ma’d’nehs, and chant the
following call ; which, beingone of the two night-calls
not at the regular periods of obligatory prayers, is
called the 0o'1a, a term signifying merely “
theFirst.”
’ Here is added, in the morning call, “Prayeris better than
sleep!” (twice.) '

Having commenced by chanting the common ada’n,
with those words which are introduced in the call to
morning-prayer (“Prayer is better than sleep”),he
adds, “There is no deity but God” (three times)
“alone: He hathvno companion: to Him belongeth
the dominion; and to Him belongeth praise. He

hath no companion in his great dominion. His abso-
lute glory [I assert]: exalted be'his name : [I assert]
the absolute glory of God.”
About an hour before daybreak, the moo-ed’dins of
most mosques chant the second call, named the Eb’ed
(which signifies “ the Eternal”),and so called from
that word occurring near the commencement. This
call is as follows: “
[I assert] the absolute glory of
God, the Eternal One, the Eternal” (three times):
“ the absolute glory of God, the Desired, the Existing,
the Single, the Supreme: the absolute glory of God,

The Ckoor-a'n is usually recited, in the furd prayers, in a voice
slightly audible, excepting at noon and the’aer,when it is recited
inaudihly. By Ima’ms, when praying at the head of others, and
sometimes by persms praying alone, it is chanted. In the
sooa’neh prayers it is rechd inaudihly.

Great!” and this he repeats as he bends his head a
second‘ time to the ground. During this second pros-
tratiou he repeats the same words as in the first, and in
raising his head again, he utters the tekbee’ras before.
Thus are completed the prayers of one relt’‘ah. In all
the changes of posture, the toes of the right foot must
not be moved from the spot where they were first
placed, and the left foot should be moved as little as
possible.
Having finished the prayers of one rek”ah, the wor-
shipper rises upon his feet (but withoutmoving his toes
from the spot where they were, particularlythose of the
right foot),and repeats thesame ; onlyhe should recite
some other chapter, or portion, after the Fa’t’hhah,
than that which he repeated befhre, as, for instance, the
108thchapter‘.
After every second rek”ah (and after the last, though
there be an odd number, as in the evening furd), he
does not immediatelyraise his knees from the ground,
but bends his left foot under him, and sits upon it, and
places his hands upon his thighs,with thefingersa little
apart. In this posture, he says, “Praises are to God,

After the last rek”ah of each of the prayers (thatis,
after the soon’neh prayers and the furd alike), after
saying, “
Praises are to God,” &c., the worshipper,
looking upon his right shoulder, says, “Peace be on
you, and the mercy of God!” then, looking upon
"the left, he repeats the same. These salutations are
considered by some as addressed only to the guardian
angels who watch over the believer, and note all hi
actions-|-; but others say that theyare addressed both
to angels and men (i. e. believers only), who may be
present; no person, however,returns them. Before the
salutations in the last prayer, the worshipper may ofi'er
up any short petition _(in Scriptural language rather
than his own); whilehe does so looking at the palms
of his two hands, which he holds like an open book
before him, and then draws over his face, from the
forehead downwards.
Having finished both the soon’neh and furd prayers,
the worshipper, if he would acquithimself completely,
or rather,perform supererogatory acts, remains sitting
(but may then sit more at his case), and recites the

of the 2d chapter of the Ckoor-a’n‘*; and adds, “O
High ! 0 Great! Thine absolute glory [I assert.]”
He then repeats, “The absolutegloryof God!” (thirty-
three times.) “ The absolute glory of God, the Great,
withhis praise forever!” (once.) “
Praise beto God !”
(thirty-threetimes.) “ Extolled behis dignity! There is
no deity but Him,” (once.) “ God is most Great!”
(thirty-threetimes.) “
God is most Great in greatness.
and praise beto God in abundance!”(once.) He counts
these repetitions with a string of beads called seb’hhah
(more properlysoob’hhah). The beads are ninety-nine,
and have a mark between each thirty-three. They are
of aloes, or other odoriferous or precious wood, or of
coral, or of certain fruit-stones, or seeds, &c.
Any wanderingof the eyes, or of the mind, a cough-
ing, or the like, answeringa question, or any action not
prescribed to be performed, must be strictly avoided
(unless it be between the soon’neh prayers and thefurd
or be difficult to avoid, for it is held allowable to make
three slight irregular motions or deviations from correc
department) ; otherwise the worshipper must begin
again, and repeat his prayers with due reverence. It
is considered extremelysinful to interrupt a man when
engaged in his devotions. The time usually occupied
in repeating the prayers of four rel-r”ahs, without the
supererogatory additions, is less than four, or even
three minutes. The Moos’lim says the five daily
prayers in his house or shop or in the mosque, accord-
ing as may be most convenient to him: it is seldom
that a person goes from his house to the mosque to

pray, excepting to join the congregation on Friday.
Men of the lower orders oflener pray in the mosques
than those who have a comfortable home, and a mat or
carpet upon which to pray.
The same prayers are said by the congregation in
the mosque on the noon of Friday, but there are addi-
tional rites performed by the Ima'm and other ministers
on this occasion. The chief reasons for fixing upon
Friday,as the Mohhammadan Sabbath,were, it is said,
becauseAdamwas created on thatday, and died on the
same day of the week, and because the general resur-
rection was prophesied to happen on thatday; whence,
particularly,Friday was named the day of El-Goom”ah
(or the assembly). The Moos’lim does not abstain
from worldly business on Fridayexcepting during the
time of prayer, accordingto theprecept of theCkoor-a’n,
ch. lxii., vv. 9 and 10.
To form a proper conception of the ceremoninls of
the Friday-prayers, it is necessary to have some idea
of the interior of ‘a mosque. A mosque in which a
congregation assembles to perform the Friday-prayers
is called ga/mé’. The mosques of Cairo are so nume-
rous, that none of them is inconvenientlycrowded on
the Friday; and some of them are so large as to occupy
spaces three or four hundred feet square. They are
mostly built of stone, the alternate courses of which
are generallycoloured externally red and white. Most
commonly a large mosque consists of porticoes sur-
roundinga square open court, in the centre of which is
a tank or a fountain for ablution. One side of the
buildingfaces the direction of Mek’keb, and theportico
on thisside, beingthe principal placeof prayer, is more
spacious than those on the three other sides of the
94 MODERN EGYPTIANS.
court: it generallyhas two or more rows of columns,
forming so many aisles, parallel with the exterior wall.
In some cases, this portico, like the other three, is open
to the court; in other cases, it is separated from the
court by partitions of wood, connectingthe front row of
columns. In the centre of its exterior wall is the
mehhra’b (or niche) which marksthe direction of Mela’-
keh; and to theright of this is the mim’ba.r (or pulpit).
Opposite the mehhra’b, in the fore part of the portico,
or in its central part, there is generally a platform
(called dt'k'lceh), surrounded by a parapet, and sup-
ported by small columns; and by it, or before it, are
one or two seats, having a kind of desk to bear a
volume of the Ckoor-a’n, from which a chapter is read
‘
to the congregation. The walls are generally quite°
plain, beingsimplywhite-washed; but in some mosques
the lower part of the wall of the place of prayer is’
lined with coloured marbles, and the other part orna-'
mented with various devices executed in stucco, but
mostly with texts of the Ckoor-a’n (which form long
friezes, having a pleasing effect), and never with the"
representation of anything.that has life. The pave"-'
ment is covered with matting, and the rich and poor’
pray side by side ; the man of rank or wealth enjoying_
no peculiar distinction or comfort, unless (which is
sometimes the case) he have a prayer-carpetbrought by
‘
his servant, and spread for him’.
The Prophet did not forbid women to attend public
prayers in a mosque,‘ but pronounced it better for them
‘
to pray in private; but in Cairo neither females nor_
young boys are allowed to pray with the congregation
9 Adjoiningeach mosque are several latrina,in eachof which _
is a receptaclewithwater, for ablution.
REIJGION. 95
in the mosque, nor even to be present in the mosque at
anytime ofprayer: formerlywomen were permitted (and
perhaps are still in some countries),but were obliged to
placethemselves apart from the men, and behind the
latter; because, as Sale has remarked, the Moos’lims
are of opinion that the presence of females inspires a
different kind of devotion from thatwhich is requisite in
a place dedicated to the worship of God. Very few
women in Egypt even pray at home.
Over each of the mosques of Cairo presides a Na’zir
(orwarden),who is the trustee of the funds which arise
from lands, houses, &c. bequeathedto the mosque by
the founder and others, and "who appoints the religious
ministers and the inferior servants. Two Ima'm: are
employed to ofiiciate in each of the larger mosques: one
of them,called the Kha.te’eb, preaches and prays before
the congregation on the Friday: the other is an Ima'm
Ra’tz'b, 'or ordinary Ima’m, who recites the five prayers
of every, day in the mosque, at the head of those persons
who may be there at the exact times of those prayers:
but in most of the smaller mosques both these offices
are performed by one Ima’m. There are also to each
mosque one or more moo-ed'dins (to chant the call to
prayer), and bowwa'bs (or door-keepers), according as
there are one or more ma’d’nehs (or menarets) and
entrances; and several other servants are employed to
sweep the mosque, spread the mats, light the lamps, and
attend to the sa’ckiyeh (or water-wheel), by which the
tank or fountain, and other receptaclesfor water, neces-
sary to the performance of ablutions, are supplied. The
Ima’ms, and those persons who perform the lower,
oflices,are all paid from the funds of the mosque, and
not by any contributions exacted from the people.
a
96 MODERN EGYPTIANS.
The condition of the Ima’ms is very differart, in
most respects, fromthatof Christian priests. They have
no authorityabove otherpersons, and do not enjoy any
respect but what their reputed piety or learning may
obtain them : nor are they a distinct order of men set
apart for religious oflices,like our clergy,and composing
an indissolublefraternity; for a man who has acted as
the Ima’m of a mosque may be displacedby the warden
of that mosque, and, with his employment and salary,
loses the title of Ima’m, and has no better chance of
being again chose‘for a religious minister than any
'
other person competent to perform the oifice. The
Ima'ms obtain their livelihood chiefly by other means
than the service of the mosque, as their salaries are
very small: thatof a Khatee'b beinggenerally about a
piaster (21d. of our money) per month; and that of
an ordinary Ima’m, about five piasters. Some of them
engage in trade; several of them are ’atta’r: (or drug-
gists and perfumers), and many of them are school-
masters: thosewho have no regular occupations of these
kinds ofien recite the Ckoor-a’n for hire in private
houses. They are mostly chosen from among the poor
students of the great mosque El—Az'har.
The large mosques are open from day—break till a
little after the ’esh'é, or tillnearlytwo hours after sunset.
The others are closed between the hours of morning
and noon prayeis ; and most mosques are also closed in
rainy weather (excepting at the times of prayer), hat
persons who have no shoes should enter and dirt the
pavement and matting. Such persons always enter by
the door nearest the tank or fountain, (if there be more
than one door,) that they may wash before they pus
into the place of prayer; and generally this door alone‘
RELIGION. 97
is lefl. open in dirty weather. The great mosque El-
Az’har remains open all night, withthe exception of the
principal place of prayer, which is called the much-
.soo'rah, beingpartitioned at? from the rest of the build-
ing. In many of the larger mosques, particularly in
the aflernoon, persons are seen lounging, chatting
together, eating, sleeping, and sometimes spinning or
sewing, or engaged in some other simple craft; but,
notwithstanding such practices, the Moos’lims very
highly respect their mosques. There are several
mosques in Cairo (as the Az'har, Hha.saney’n, &c.),
beforewhicl11§o_Frank, nor any other Christian, nor a
Jew, were allowed to pass, till of late years since the
French invasion.
On the Friday, half an hour before the doohr (or
noon), the nijoo-ed’dins of the mosques ascend to the
galleries of‘
the ma’ ‘nehs, and chant the Sela’m, which
is a salutationgtothe Prophet, not always expressed in
the same N-rords, but generallyin words to the following
effect:-1-“ Blessingand peace beon thee,0 thou of great
dignity! 0 Apostle of God! Blessing and peace be on
thee,to whom the Truthsaid, I am God ! Blessingand
peace be on thee, thou first of the creatures of God, and
seal of the Apostles of God! From me be peace on
thee, and on thy Family and all thy Companions!”
Persons then begin to assemble in the mosques.
The utmost aolemnity and decorum are observed in
the public worship of the Moos’1ims. Their looks and
behaviour in the, mosque are not those of enthusiastic
devotion, but of calm and modest piety. Never are they
guiltyof a designedly irregular word or action during
their prayers. The pride and fanaticism which they
a 2
98 MODERN EGY PTIANS.
exhibit in common life, in intercourse withpersons of.
theirown, or of a different faith,seem to be dropped on
their. entering the mosque, and they appear wholly
absorbed in the adoration of their Creator; humble and
downcast, yet without affected humility, or a forced
expression of countenance. The Moos’lim takes off his
shoes at the door of the mosque, carries them in his
left hand, sole to sole, and puts his right foot first over
the threshold. If he have not previously performed
the preparatory ablution, he repairs at once to the tank
or fountain to acquit himself of that duty,l Before he
commences his prayers he places his shoes (and his
sword and pistols, if he have such arms,) upon the
matting, a little before the spot where his head will
touch the ground in prostration: his shoes are put one
upon the other, sole to sole.
The peoplewho assemble to perform the noon-prayers
of Fridayarrange themselves in rows parallel to that
side of the mosque in which is the niche, and facing
that side. Many do not go until the ada'n of noon, or
just before. When a person goes at, or a little after, the
Sela’m, as soon as he has taken his place in one of the
ranks, he performs two rek”ahs, and then remains
sitting, on his knees or cross-legged, while a reader,
having seated himself on the ‘reading-chairimmediately
after the Sela’m, is occupied in reciting (usuallywithout
book) the Soo’rat el-Kahf (the 18th chapter of the
Ckoor-a’n), or a part of it; for, generally,he has not
finished it before the ada'n of noon, when he stops.
All the congregation, as soon as they hear the ada’n
(which is the same as on other days),sit on their knees
and feet. When the ads/n is finished,they stand up,

and perform, each separately, two’ rek”ahs, soon’net

which they conclude, like the ordinary prayers. withthe
two salutations§ A servant of the mosque, called a
moo1'uck'cIzee, then opens the folding-doors at the foot
of the pulpit-stairs, takes from behindthem a straight,
wooden sword, and, standing a little to the right of the
door-way,withhis right side towards the ckilJ’leh,holds
this sword in his right hand, resting the point on the
ground: in thisposition he says, “
VerilyGod favoureth,
and his angels bless, the Prophet. 0 ye who believe,
bless him, and greet him with a salutation !” Then, one
or more persons, called Mooba1’1ighs, stationed on the
dildkeh,chant_the following. or similar words ‘r. “ 0

and whom the dubbi saluted, and before whom the
moon was cloven in twain, our lord Mohham'mad, and
his Familyand Companions !" The Mooruck’ckee then
recites the ada’n (which the Moo-ed’dins have already
chanted): after every few words he pauses, and the
Moobal’lighs, on the dik’keh, repeat the same words in
a sonorous chant §. Before the ada’n is finished, the

Khatee'b, or Ima'm, comes to the foot of the pulpit,
takes the wooden sword from the Mooruck’ckee’s hand,
ascends the pulpit, and sits on the top step or platform.
The pulpit of a large mosque, on this day, is decorated
with two flags, with the profession of the faith, or the
names of God and Mohham’mad, worked upon them:
these are fixed at the top of the stairs, slanting forward.
The Mooruck’ckee and Moobal'lighshaving finished the
ada’n, the former repeats a tradition of the Prophet,
saying. “ The Prophet, upon whom he blessing and
peace, hath said, ‘
If thou hast said unto thycompanion
while the Ima’m is preachingon Friday,Be thou silent,
thou hast spoken rashly.’ Be ye silent: ye shall be
rewarded: God shall recompense you.” He then sits
down. The Khatec-.'b now rises, and, holding the
wooden sword‘ in the same manner as the Mooruck’ckee
did, delivers an exhortation. called khoofbet el-waaz.
As the reader may be curious to see a translation of a
Mohhammadan sermon, I insert one. The following
is a sermon preached on the first Friday of the Arab

afterwards procured his sermon-book (dcnuluflsoflab),contain-
ing sermons for every Fridayin the year, and for the two ‘ads, or

in the curtailment of time by indolence and sleep there
is very great trouble? Know ye not that in the cutting
short of lives by the termination of years is a very
great warning? Know ye not that the night and day
divide the lives of numerous souls? Know ye not that
health and capacity are two blessings coveted by many
men? But thetruth hathbecomemanifestto thosewho

hath passed away, and come to an end, with its evils;
and ye have entered upon anotheryear, in which, if it
please God, mankind shall be relieved. Is any of_you

to come? or repenting of his failings in the times that
are passed? The happy is he who makes amends for
the time passed in the time to come ; and the miserable
is he whose days pass away and he is careless of his
time. This new year hath arrived, and the sacred month
of God hath come withblessings to you,—thefirst of the
months of the year, and of the four sacred months, as
hathbeen said, and the most worthyof preference and
honour and reverence: its fast is the most excellent of
fasts after that which is incumbent', and the doing of
good in it is among the most excellent of the objects of
desire. Whosoever desires to reap advantage from it,
let him fast the ninth and tenth days, looking for aid.
Abstain not from this fast through indolence, and
esteeming it a hardship; but comply with it in the best
manner, and honour it with the best of honours, and
improve your time by the worship of God, morning and
evening. Tum unto God with repentance, before the

The Khatee’b, having concluded his exhortation, says
to the congregation, “
Supplicate God.” He then sits
down, and prays privately; and each member of the
congregation at the same time offers up some private
petition, as afler theordinary prayers, holding his hands
before him (looking at the palms), and then drawing
them down his face. This done, the Moobal’lighssay

prayed for in this Khoot.’beh. The Khatee’h, or Ima’m,
having ended it, descends from the pulpit, and the
Moobal'lighschant theicka'meh(describedin page 90):
the Ima'm, stationed before the niche, then recites the
furd prayers of Friday, which consist of two rek”ahs,
and are similarto the ordinary prayers. The people do
the same, but silently,and keeping time exactlywith
the Ima’m in the various postures. Those who are of
the Ma’likee sect then leave the mosque; and so also
do many persons of the other sects: but some of the
Sha’fe’ees and Hhan’afees (there are scarcely any
Hham'bel’eesin Cairo) remain, and recite the ordinary
furd prayers of noon; forming a number of separate
groups. in each of which one acts as Ima’m. The rich,
on going out of the mosque, often give alms to the
poor outside the door.
I have spoken thus fully of Mohhammadan worship,
because my countrymen in general have very imperfect
and erroneous notions on this subject; many of them
even imagining that the Moos’lims ordinarily pray to
their Prophet as well as to God. Invocations to the
Prophet, for his intercession, are, indeed, frequently
made, particularly at his tomb, where pious visiters
generallysay, “ We ask thyintercession, 0 Apostle of
God!” The Moos’lims, also, even implore the inter-
cession of their numerous saints.
The duty next in importance to prayer is that of
giving alms. Certain aims are prescribedby law, and
are called zek’a/1: others, called sud’a.ckah, are volun-
tary. The former, or obligatory alms,,were, in ‘the
earlier ages of El-Isla’m, collected by officers appointed
by the sovereign, for pious uses, such as building
mosques, &c.; but now it is left to the Moos’1im’s con-‘

seieneetogive them, andtoapplythetninwhatmanner
he tlfinks fit; that is, to bestow them upon whatever
needy persons he may choose. They are to be given
once in every year, of cattle and sheep, generallyin the
proportion of one in forty, two in a hundred and
'
twenty; of cameh, for every five, a ewe; or for twenty-
five, a pregnant camel; and likewise of money, and,
among‘ the Hhan’afees, of merchandize, &c. He who
has money to the amount of two hundred dir’hems (or
drums) of silver, or twenty mitckalls (i. e. thirtydrama)
of gold (or, among the Hhan’afees, the value of the
above in gold or silver ornaments, utensils, &c.), must
annually give the fortieth part (roobii el-’oshr), or the
value of. thatpart.
Fasting is the next duty. The Moos’lim is com-
manded to fast during the whole monthof Rum’ada’n"
every day, from the first appearance of day-break, or
ratherfrom the hour when there is snflicient light for a
person to distinguish plainly a white thread from 3
black thresdf (about two hours before sunrise in
Egypt), until sunset. He must abstain from eating,
drinking,smoking,mellingperfumes, and every unne-
eessaryind meneeor pleasure ofa. worldly nature;
even from intentionally swallowinghis spittle. When-
R|un’eda'n falls in summer: the fast is very severe;

Rum’ada’ri; but if theydo not keep it in this month
they should fast an equal numberof days at a future
time. Fastingisalsotobedispensedwithinthecases
of a nurse and pregnant woman. The Prophet even
disapproved of any person's keeping the fast of Rum’-
ada’n if not perfectly able; and desired no man to
fast so much as to injure his health, or disqualify him-
self for necessary labour. The modern Moos’lims seem
to regard the fast of Rum’ada’n as of more impor-
tance than any other religious act, for many of them
keep thisfastwho neglect their dailyprayers; and even
those who break the fast, with very few exception,
pretend to keep it. Many Moos’lims of the wealthy
classes eat and drink in secret during Rum'ada’n; but
the greater number strictly keep the fast, which is fatal
to numerous persons in a weak state of health. There
are some other days on which it is considered merito-
rious to fast, but not absolutely necessary. On the two
grand festivals, namely, thatfollowing Rum’ada’n, and
thatwhich succeeds the pilgrimage,it is unlawful to
fast, beingexpressly forbiddenby the Prophet.
The last of the four most important duties, that of
pilgrimage,remains to be noticed. It is incumbenton
every Moos’lim to perform, once in his fife, thepilgrim-
age to Mek’keh and Mount ’Arat'a’t, unless poverty or
ill healthprevent him ; or, if 8. HhaIt’afee, he may send

ofthe ceremonies of circuiting the Kn‘/abeh seven times
and kissing the “blackstone” in each round, and other
rites in the Holy City, that the Moos’lim acquires the
title of el-hha’gg“ (or the pilgrim); the final object of
the pilgrimage is Mount ’Arafa’t, _six hours’ journey
distant from Mek'keh. During his performance of the
required ceremonies in Mek’keh, and also during his
journey to ’Arafa’t, and until his completion of the
pilgrimage, the Moos’lim wears a peculiar dress,
called ehhra’m (vulgarly hhera'm), generally consisting
of two simple pieces of cotton, or linen, or woollen cloth,
without seam or ornament, one of which is wrapped
round the loins, and theother thrownover theshoulders :
the instep and heel of each foot, and the head, must be
bare; but umbrellas are now used by many of the pil-
grims. It is necessary that the pilgrim be present on
the occasion of a Khoot’behwhich is recited on Mount
’Arafa’t in the afternoon of the 9th of the month of
Zoo-1-Hheggeh. In theensuing evening, after sunset,
the pilgrimscommence their return to Mek'keh. Halt-
ing the following day in the valley of Min’a (or, as it is
more commonly called, Moon’a), they complete the
ceremonies of the pilgrimage by a sacrifice (of one or
more male sheep, he-goats, cows, or she-camels, part of
the flesh of which they eat, and part give to the poor),
and by shaving the head and clipping the nails. Every
one, after this,resumes his usual dress, or puts on a new
one, if provided with such. The sacrifice is called
el-_fid’a (or the ransom), as it is performed in comme-
moration_of the ransom of Isma’ee’l_(or Ishmael) by

paragraphof Chapter V. '

the sacrificeof the ram, when he was himself about to
have been offered up by his father: for it is the general
opinion of the Moos’lims that it was this son, not Isaac,
who was to have been sacrificedby his father.
There are other ordinances, more or less connected
~
with thosewhich have been already explained.
The two festivals, called el-’Eed es-Sooghei'yz'r“, or
the Lesser Festival, and el-’Eed el-Kebee’r, or the
Great Festival, the occasions of which have been men-
tioned above, are observed with public prayer and
general rejoicing. Each of these lasts three days.
The festivities with which they are celebrated will be
described in a subsequent chapter. On the first day of
the latter festival (being that on which the pilgrims
perform their sacrifice), every other Moos’lim should
slay_a victim if he can afford to purchase one. The
wealthy slay several sheep, or a sheep or two and a
buffalo, and distribute the greater portion of the meat
to the poor. The slaughter may be performed by a
deputy.
The duty ‘of waging war against intidels is strongly
and repeatedly urged in the Ckoor-a’n; and he who
dies fighting for thedefence or propagationof El-Isla’m
is promised the rewards of a martyr. As the Jews were
ordered to exterminate heathen nations, so the Moos’-
lims are commanded to put to death every idolater who
refuses to embrace the Mohhammadan faith, and to
exact an annual tribute from Jews and Christians who
show the like resolution. The Moos’lims are even for-
bidden to contract friendshipwith any unbelievers.
There are certain prohibitory laws in the Qkoor-a’n

which must be mentioned here, as remarkablyaffecting
the moral and social condition of its disciples.
Wine and all inebriating liquors are forbidden, as
beingthe cause of “
more evil than profit.”*
Many of
the Moos'lims, however, in the present day-, drink wine, '
brandy,&c., in secret; and some, thinkingit no sin to
indulge thus in moderation, scruple not to do so openly;
but among the Egyptians there are few who transgress
in this flagrantmanner. Boo'zeh,which is an intoxicat-
ing liquor made with barley-bread, crumbled, mixed
with water, strained, and lefi to ferment, is commonly
drunk by the boatmen of the Nile, and by otherpersons
of the lower orders 1'. Opium, and other drugs which
produce a similar effect, are considered unlawful, though
not mentioned in the Ckoor-a’n; and persons who are
addicted to taking these drugs are regarded as immoral
characters; but, in Egypt, such persons are not very
numerous. Some sectarians have pronounced tobacco,
and even coffee, to be unlawful.
The eatingof swine's flesh is strictlyforbidden. The
unwholesomeefi'ects of that meat in a hot climate would
be a snflicientreason for the prohibition; but the pig is
held in abhorrence by the Moos’lim chiefly on account
of its extremelyfilthyhabits1. Most animals prohibited
for food by the Mosaic law are alike forbidden to the
Moos’lim; the camel is an exception. The Moos'limis

the ancient Egyptians. (Herodotus, lib. ii., cap. 77.) The
modern inhabitantsof Egypt also prepare bodzeh from wheat and
from milletin the same manner, but less commonly.
I The swine was universally deemed impure by the ancient
Egyptians. (Herodotus, lib. ii., cap. 47.)

“ forbidden [to eat] thatwhich diethof itself, and blood,
and swine’s flesh, and that on which the name of any
beside God hath been invoked; and that which hath
been strangled, or killed by a blow, or by a fall, or by
the horns [of another beast]; and thatwhich hathbeen
eaten by -a wild beast, except what he shall [himself]
kill; and that which hath been sacrificedunto idols '."
An animal that is killedfor the food of man must be
slaughtered in a particular manner: the person who is
about to perform the operation must say, “ In the name
of God! God is most great ‘.” and then cut its throat,
taking care to divide the windpipe, gullet, and carotid
arteries. It is forbidden to employ, in this case, the
phrasewhich is so often made use of on otheroccasions,
“In the name of God, the Compassionate, the Mer-
ciful!” because the mention of the most benevolent
epithets of the Deity on such an occasion would seem
like a mockery of the sufferings which the animal is
about to endure. Some persons in Egypt, but mostly
women, when about to kill an animal for food, say, “ In
the name of God ! God is most great! God give the
patience to endure the afilictionwhich he hath allotted
thee1-!” If the sentiment which first dictated this
prayer were always felt, it would present a beautiful
trait in the character of the people who use it. In
cases of necessity, when in danger of starving, the
Moos’lim is allowed to eat any food which is prohibited
under other circumstances. The mode of slaughter
above described is, of course, only required to be prac-
tised in the cases of domestic animals. Most kinds of

fish are lawful food’; so also are many birds, the tame
kinds of which must be killed in the same manner as
cattle; but the wild may be shot. The hare, rabbit,
gazelle, &c. are lawful, and may either be shot or killed
by a dog, provided the name of God was uttered at the
time of slipping the dog, and he have not eaten any
part of the prey. This animal, however, is considered
very unclean : the Sha’fe’ees hold themselves to be pol-
luted by the touch of its nose if it be wet, and if any
part of theirclothesbe so touched, they must wash'that
part with seven waters, and once with clean earth:
some others are only careful not to let the animal lick,
or defile in a worse manner, their persons or their
dress, &c.
'
Gambling and usury are also prohibited, and all
games of chance; and likewise the making of images
or pictures of anything that has life1'. The Prophet
declared that every representation of this kind would be
placed before its author on the day of judgment, and
thathe would he commanded to put life into it; which
not beingable to do, he would be cast, for a time, into
Hell.
The principal civil laws of the Ckoor-a'n and the
Traditions,&c., remain to be stated. These laws are
partly founded upon the customs of the Pagan Arabs,
but mostly upon the Jewish Scriptures and traditions.
" In some respects, the Moos’lim code does not appear to be
so strictly founded upon exigencies of a sanatory natureas the
Mosaic. See Leviticus, xi., 9-12. In Egypt, fish which have
not scales are generallyfound to be unwholesomefood.
1' Many of the Moos’lims hold that onlysculptures which cast
a shadow, representing living creatures, are unlawful; but the
Prophet certainly condemned pictures also.
LAWS. 115
Thecivil laws are chieflyderived from theCkoor—a’n';
but, in many important cases, this highest authority
aflbrds no precept. In most of thesecases theTraditions
of the Prophetdirect thedecisions of thejudgef. There
are, however, some important cases, and _many of an
inferior kind, respecting which both the Ckoor-a’n and
the Traditionsare silent. These are decided on the au-
thorityof one of thefour greatIm-a’ms,or founders of the
four orthodox sects of El~Isla’m; on the authority of
the lma’m of that sect to which the ruling power
belongs, which sect, in Egypt, and throughout the
Turkishempire, is thatof the Hhan'afees; or, if,
none
of the decisions of the Ima’m relate to a case in dispute
(which not unfrequently happens), judgmentis given,
in that case, on the authorityof some other eminent
doctor. In general, onlythe principal laws, as laid down
in the Ckoor-a'n, will be here stated.
It seems to be well ascertained that polygamy is as
unfavourable to population as it is injurious to domestic
happiness, to morality, and to the exercise and im-
provement of the nobler powers of the mind; and, in
justice to the legislator of the Moos’lims, we should
remark, that, instead of introducing or encouraging,
he limited this licence: it is true that he assumed to
himself the privilege of having a greater number of
wives than he allowed to others, but, in doing so, he
may have been actuated by the want of male offspring
rather than impelled by voluptuousness. ‘The law
respecting marriage and concubinage, though express
as to the number of wives whom the Moos’lim may

have at the same time, namely four, is not considered
by the less strict as perfectly explicit with regard to the
number of concnbines he may keep. It is written,
“Take in marriage, of the women who please you,
two, three, or four; but if ye fear that ye cannot act
equitably [to so many, take] one; or [take] those whom
your righthandshaveacquired*,” thatis,slaves. Many
of the wealthy Moodlims, interpreting this text accord-
ing to their desires, marry two, three, or four wives,
and keep, besides, several concubine slaves. When
a female slave becomes a mother by her master, the
child which she bears to him is free; and she herself
cannot afterwards be sold by her master (though she
must. continue to serve him and be his concubine), and
is entitled to emancipationat his death. Her bearinga
child to him is called the cause of her emancipation or
liberty, but does not oblige him to emancipate her tn
long as-he lives, thoughit is commendable if he do so,
and make her his wife, provided he have not already
four wives, or if he marry her to another man, should
it be her wish. It is held lawful for a Moos’lim to
marry a Christian, or a Jewish woman, if induced to do
so by excessive love of her, or if he cannot obtain a
wife of his own faith. In this case the offspring must
follow the fat.her’s faith, and the wife does not inherit
when the husband dies. A Mohhammadan woman
cannot, however, under any circumstances but by force,
marry a man of another faith. The degrees of rela-
tionship in which marriage is prohibited are stated in
the 26th and 27th verses of the 4th chapter of the
Ckoor-8/n, where it is said, “
Marry not women whom
your fathers have had to wife.” “
Ye are forbidden to
’ Ckoor-a’n, chap. iv., v. 3.
LAWS. 117
marry your mothers, and your daughters, and your
abters, and your aunts bothon the fa.ther’s and on the
mother’s side, and your brot.her’s daughters, and your
sister's daughters, and your foster-mothers, and your
fostersisters, and your wives’ mothers, and your step-
daughters which are under your tuition, born of your
wives,” “and the wives of your sons ;” “
and ye are
forbiddentotake to you two sisters, as your wives.” It is
lawful for the Moos’lim to see the faces of these women
whom he is forbidden to marry, but of no others, ex-
cepting his own wives and female slaves. The marriage
of a. man and woman, or of a man and a girl who has
arrived at puberty,is lawfullyefl"ected by their declaring
(which the latter generallydoes by a welzee’l, or deputy)
their consent to marry each other, in the presence of ,
two witnesses (ifwitnesses can be procured), and by'the
payment, or part-payment, of a dowry. But the consent
of a girl under age is not required; her father, or
paternal grandfather,or her mother,uncle, or any other
person appointed by will, or by the Cka’dee, acting for
her as he pleases‘. The giving a dowry is indispen-
sable, and the least sum that is allowed by law is ten
dz'r’hems (or drama of silver),which is equal to about
five shillingsof our money. A man may legallymarry
a woman without mentioning a dowry; but after the
consummation of the marriage, she can, in this case,
compel him to pay the sum of ten dir’hems1-.

to be mentioned below ; but if he divorce her the third
time, or put her away by a triple divorce conveyed in one
sentence, he cannot receive her again until she has been
married and divorced by another husband, who must
have consummated his marriage with her.‘ When a
man divorces his wife (which he does by merely saying,
" Thou art divorced," or
“
I divorce thee"),he pays her
a portion of her dowry (generally one-third),which he
had kept back from the first, to be paid on thisoccasion,
or at hisdeath; and she takes away with her the furni-
ture, &c., which she brought at her marriage. He may
thus put her away from mere dislike T, and without
assigning any reason, but a woman cannot separate
herself from her husband against his will, unless it be_
for some 'considerab_1e fault on his part, as cruel treat-
ment, or neglect; and even then, application to the
Cka'dee's court is generallynecessarytocompel the man
to divorce her, and she forfeits the above-mentioned
remnant of the dowry.
The first and second divorce, if made without any
mutual agreement for a compensation from the woman,
or a pecuniary sacrifice on her part, is termed tala/ck
reg”ee (a divorce which admits of return) ; becausethe
husband may take back his wife, without her consent,
during the period of her ’ed’deh (whichwill bepresently
explained), but not after, unless with her consent, and
by a new contract. If he divorce her thefirst or second
time for a compensation, she perhaps requesting, “

vorce me for what thouowest me," or “ — hast of mine,”

tional sum, he cannot take her again but by her own
consent, and by a new contract. This is a tala’cIz ba'in
(or separatingdivorce), and is termed “
the lesser sepa-
ration,” to distinguish it from the third divorce, which
.
is called “the greater separation.” The ’ed’deh is the
period during which a divorced woman, or a widow,
must wait before marrying aga.in,—in either case, if
pregnant, until delivery: otherwise, the former must
wait three lunar periods, or three months; and the
latter, four months and ten days. A woman who is
divorced when in a state of pregnancy,though she may
make a new contract of marriage immediatelyafter her
delivery, must wait forty days longer before she can
complete her marriage by receiving her husband. The
man who divorces his wife must maintain her in his own
house, or in that of her parents, or elsewhere, during
the period of her ’ed’deh; but must cease to live with
her as her husband from the commencement of that
period. A divorced woman who has a son under two
years of age may retain him until he has attained that
age, and may be compelled to do so by the law of the
Sha'fe’ees; and, by the law of the Ma’likees, until he
has arrived at puberty; but the Hhan’afee law limits
the period during which the boy should remain under
her care to seven years: her daughter she should retain
until nine years of age, or the period of puberty. If a
man divorce his wife before the consummationof mar-
riage, he must pay her half the sum which he has pro-
mised to give her as a dowry; or, if he have promised
no dowry, he must pay her the half of the smallest
dowry allowed by law, which hasbeen above mentioned;
and she may marry again immediately.

two witnesses‘ against her, to the Cka'dee’s court. to
prefer a complaint against her; and, if the case be
1:-oved, a certificate is written declaring the woman
1ra’sIu'zeIr, or rebellious against her husband. This
process is termed “
writing a woman na’shi1.eh.” It
exempts her husband from the obligation to lodge,
clothe, and maintain her. He is not obliged to divorce
her; and, by refusing to do this, he may prevent ha
marrying another man as long as he lives; but, if she
promise to be obedient afierwards, he must take ha-
back, and maintain her, or divorce her. It is more
common, however, for a wife whose husband refuse to
divorce her, if she have parents or other relations able
and willingto support her comfortably, to make a can-
plaint at the Cka’dee's court, stating her husband’s enn-
dnct to be of such a nature towards her-.thatshe willnot
live with him, and thus cause herself to be registered
“
na’shizeh,”and separated from him. In thiscase, the
husband generallypersists, from mere spite, in

Furtherlaws on this subject, and still more favourable
to the women, are given in the Ckoor-a’n*, in the fol-
lowingwords:-—“ But [as to] those who accuse women
of reputation [of fornication or adultery]: and produce
not four witnesses [of the fact], scourge them with
eighty stripes, and receive not their testimony for ever;
for such are infamous prevaricators; excepting those
who shall afterwards repent; for God is gracious and
merciful. They who shall accuse their wives [of adul-
my]. and shall have no witnesses [thereof] besides
themselves, the testimony [which shall be required] of
one of them [shall be], that he swear four times by
God thathe speakeththe truth, and the fifth[time that
he imprecate] the curse of God on him if he be a liar;
and it shall avert the punishment [of the wife] if she
swear four times by God that he is a liar, and if the
fifih [time she imprecate] the wrath of God on her if
he speak the truth.” The commentators and lawyers
have agreed that, under these circumstances, the mar-
riage must be dissolved. In the chapter from which
the above quotation is made (v. 2),it is ordained that
unmarried persons convicted of fornication shall be
punished by scourging-, with a hundred stripes; and a
Soon’neh law renders them obnoxious to the further
punishment of banishment for a whole yearf. Of the

trary actof the government, not founded on the laws of
theCkoor-a'n or Traditions’. No distinction is made
between the children of wives and those of concubine
slaves: theyinherit equally.
The most remarkablegeneral principles of the laws
of inheritance are the denial of any privileges to pri-
rnogenituref,and awarding to a female a share equal to
half thatof a male of the same degree of relationship to

only one-sixth,and the said brothers have one-sixth. If
there be brothers and sisters of the deceased, but no

and there be neitherparents, nor brothers, nor children,

The law is remarkablylenient towards debtors. “ If
there be any [debtor]”, says the Ckoor-a’n"’, “
under a
difliculty[of paying his debt], let [his creditor] wait till
it be easy [for him to do it]; but if ye remit it as alms,
it will be better for you, if ye knew it.” The Moos'lim
is commanded (in the chapter from which the above
extract is taken), when he contracts a debt, to cause a
statement of it to be written, and attested by two men,
or a man and two women, of his own faith. The
debtor is imprisoned for non-payment of his debt; but,
if he establish his insolvency, he is liberated. He may
be compelled to work for the discharge of his debt, if
able.
It is ordained that murder shall be punished with
death,or that the perpetrator shall pay, to the heirs of
the person whom he has killed, a fine, which is to be
divided accordingto the laws of inheritance; and it is
optional withthe said heirs to decree whether the mur-
derer shall be put to death or the fine acceptedf. By
the Hhan’afee code, the free may be put to death for
the murder of a slave; but not the parent for the
offspring‘. In the present day, however, murder is
generallypunished with death; the government seldom
allowing a composition in money to be made. The
Bed’awees have made the law of the avengingof blood
terribly severe and unjust, transgressing the limits
assigned by the Ckoor—a’n: for, with them, any single
person descended from the homidde, or from the
homicide’s father, grandfather, great-grandfather, or
great-g1'andfather’s father, may be killed by any of
such relations of the person murdered or killed in

fight; but, among most tribes, the fine is generally
accepted instead of the blood. Cases of blood-revenge
are very common among the peasantry of Egypt, who,
as I have before remarked,retain many customs of their
Bed'awee ancestors. The relations of a person who has
been killed, in an Egyptian village, generally retaliate
with their own hands ratherthan apply to the govern-
ment, and often do so with disgusting cruelty, and even
mangleand insult the corpse of their victim. The rela-
tiom of a homicide usually fly from their own to
anothervillage, for protection. Even when retaliation
has been made, animosity frequentlycontinues between
the two parties for many years; and ofien a case of
blood-revenge involves the inhabitants of two or more
viliages in hostilities,which are renewed, at intervals,
during the period of several generations. A woman,
convicted of a capital crime, is generallyput to death by
drowningin the Nile.
Ihefi, according to the Ckoor-a’n“,is to be punished
by cutting of!‘ the ofl'ender’s right hand for the first
ofienee; but a Soon’neh law ordains thatthis punish-
ment shall not be inflictedif thevalue of thestolen pro-
perty be less than a quarter of a deena’r1'; and it is also
held necessary, to render the thief obnoxious to this
punishment, that the property stolen should have been
deposimedin a place to whichhe had not ordinaryor easy
nous: whence it follows, that a man who steals in the
house of a near relation is not subjectto thispunishment;

nor is a slave who robs the house of his master. For
the second offence, the left foot is to be cut off; for the"
third, the left hand; for the fourth,the right foot; and,
for furtheroffences of the same kind, the culprit is to be
flogged or beaten. A man may steal a free-born infant
withoutoffendingagainst the law, because it‘ is not pro-
perty; but not a slave: and the hand is not to be cut
off for stealing any article of‘ food that is quicklyperish-
able; becauseit may have been taken to supplythe im-
mediate demands of hunger. There are also some other
cases in which the thiefis exemptfrom the punishments
above mentioned. In Egypt,of late years, these punish-
ments have not been inflicted. Beating and hard labour
have been substituted for the first, second, or third
offence, andfrequentlydeath for the fourth. Most petty
offences are usuallypunished by beating with the hoor-

into a round form), or with a stick, generallyon the
soles of thefeet“‘.

led to her detection by one of her former friends in a
bath. She was mounted upon a high-saddled ass, such
as ladies in Egypt usually ride, and very respectably
dressed, attended by soldiers, andsurroundedbya rabble,
who, instead of commiserating,uttered loud impreeations
against her. The Cka’dee, who passed sentence upon
her, exhorted her, in vain, to return to her former faith.
Her own fatherwas her accuser! She was taken in a
boat into the midst of theriver, stripped nearly naked,
strangled, and then throwninto the stream‘. The Eu-
ropeans residing in Cairo regretted thatthe Ba/sha was
then at Alexandria, as theymight have prevailedupon
him to pardon her. Once before theyinterceded with
him for a woman who had been condemned for apos-
tacy. The Ba’sha ordered that she should be brought
before him: he exhorted her to recant ; but, findingher
resolute, reproved her_ for her folly,and sent her home,
commandingthat no injury should be done to her.
A few words may here be added respectingthesect of
the Wah’ha’bees,which was founded,less than a century
ago, by Mohham’mad Ibn ’Abd E1-Wa.h’ha'b, a pious
and learned sheykh of the province of Nejd, in central
Arabia. About the middle of the last century, he had
the good fortune to convert to his creed a powerful chief
of Ed-Dir’ee’yeh, the capital of the Nejd. This chief,
Mohham’mad Ib’n So’oo’d,became the sovereign of the
'
new sect-—their religious and political head—and under
him and his successors the Wah’ha’beedoctrines were
spread throughout the greater part of Arabia._

first succeeded by his son, ’Abd El-’Azee’z; next, by
So’oo'd, the son of the latter, and the greatest of the
Wah’ha'beeleaders; and, lastly,by ’Abd Al’lah, the son"
of this So’oo’d, who, after an arduous warfare with the
armies of Mohham’mad ’Al’ee, surrendered himself to
his victorious enemies, was sent to Egypt, thence to
Constantinople, and there beheaded. The wars which
Mohham’mad ’Al’ee carried on against theWah’ha'bees
had for their chief object the destruction of the political
power of the new sect: their religious tenets are still
professed by many of the Arabs, and allowed to be
orthodoxby the most learned of the ’Ool’ama of Egypt.
The Wah’ha’bees are merely reformers, who believeall
thefimdamentalpointsof E1-Isla’m, and all theaccessory
doctrinesof theCkoor-a’n and theTraditionsof the Pro-
phet: in short, their tenets are those of the primitive
Moos'lims. They disapprove of gorgeous sepulchres,
and domes erected over tombs: such theyinvariablyde-
stroy when in their power. They also condemn, as
idohters, these who pay peculiar veneration to deceased
saints; and even declare all ‘other Moos’lims to be
heretics, for the extravagant respect which theypay to
theProphet. They forbid the wearing of silk,and gold
ornaments, and all costly apparel; and also the practice
of smoking tobacco. For the want of this last luxury,
they console themselves in some degree by an immo-
derate use of coffee‘. There are many learned men
among them, and they have collected many valuable
books (chiefly historical) from various parts of Arabia,
and from Egypt.

Among many other erroneous statements respecting the
Wah'ha’bees it has been asserted thattheyprohibitthe drinking

In theCitadel of the Metropolisis a court ofjudicature,
called Deewa’n el-Khz'dee’wee, where, in the Ba’sha’s
absence, presides his Kz'kh’ya', or deputy, Hhabee’b
Efen'dee. In cases which do not fall within the pro-
vince of theCka’dee, or which are sufficientlyclear to be
decided without referring them to the court of that
oflicer, or to another council, the president of the
Deewa’n el-Khidee’wee passes judgment. Numerous
guard-houses have been established throughoutthe me-
tropolis, at each of which is stationed a body of Niza’m,
or regular troops. The guard is called Ckool’looch1', or,
more commonly, at present, Cka1’a-cIzo’l1. Persons
accused of thefts, assaults, &c.. in Cairo, are given in-
charge to a soldier of the guard, who takes them to the
chief guard-house, in theMoo’skee, astreetin thatpart of

When a person denies the offence with which he is
charged, and there is not sufiicient evidence to convict
him, but some ground of suspicion, he is generallybas-
tinadoed, in order to induce him to confess; and then,
if not before, when the crime is not of a nature that
renders him obnoxious to a very heavy punishment, he,
if guilty,admits it. A thief,afler this discipline, gene-
rally confesses, “The devil seduced me, and I took it.”
The punishment of the convicts is regulated by a system
of arbitrary, but lenient and wise, policy: it usually con-
sists in their beingcompelledto labour, for a scantysus-
tenance, in some of the public works ; such as the
removal of rubbish, digging canals, &c.; and some-
times the army is recruited with able-bodiedyoung men
convicted of petty offences. In employing malefactors
in labours for the improvement of the country, Mo-
hham’mad ’Al’ee merits the praises bestowed upon
Sabacon, the Ethiopianconqueror and king of Egypt,
who is said to have introduced this policy. The Ba’sha
is, however, very severe in punishing thefts, &c., com-
mitted against himself:—death is the usual penalty in
such cases.
There are several inferior councils for conductingthe
affairs of difl'erent departments of the administration.
The principal of theseare thefollowing: 1. The Meg’lis
el-Mesh’wa1’ah(theCouncilof Deliberation);also called
Meg’lis el-Mesh'war'ah el-1lIel’ekee'yeh (theCouncil of
Deliberationon the affairs of the State),to distinguish it
from other councils. The members of thisand of the

tions, &c.,addressed to theBa'sha, or to his Deewa’n,ne-
latingto private interestsor the affairs of thegovernment,
are generally submitted to their consideration and judg-
ment, unless they more properly come under the cog-
nizance of other councils hereafier to be mentioned.
2. The Meylis el-Gih’a’dee’yeh (the Council of the
Army); also called Megflis el-Me:h’war’ah el-'A.rIta-
ree’_|/eh (the Councilof Deliberationon MilitaryAffairs).
The province of this court is sufficientlyshown by its
name. 3. The Council of the Turslzha/neh, or Navy.
4. The Deewa’n el-Toogga’r (or Court of the Mer-
chants). This court, the members of which are mer-
chants of various countries and religions, presided over

Egypt only a. year, at the expiration of which term, a
new Cka'dee having arrived from Constantinople, the
former returns. It was customary for this ofiicer to
proceed from Cairo, with the great caravan of pilgrims,
to Mek’keh, perform the ceremonies of the pilgrimage,
and remain one year as Cka’dee of the holy city. and
one year at El-Medee’neh“. He purchases his place

of some knowledge, an ’0sma’nlee (that is, a Turk),
and of the sect of the Hhan’afees. His tribunal is
called the Mahh’ke1n’eh, or Place of Judgment. Few
Cka/dees are very well acquainted with the Arabic lan-
guage; nor is it necessary for them to have such know-
ledge. In Cairo, the Cka’dee hm little or nothing to
do but to confirm the sentence of his Na’:'b (or deputy),
who heals and decides the more ordinary cases, and
whom he chooses from among the ’Ool’ama of Istan-
boo/I, or the decision of the Moof’tee (or chiefdoctor of
the law) of his own sect, who constantly resides in
Cairo, and givesjudgmentin all cases of difiiculty; but in
generalthe Na’ib.is, at thebest,but little conversantwith
the popular dialect of Egypt; therefore, in Cairo, where
the chief proportion of the litigants at the Mahh’kem’eh
are Arabs, the judge must place the utmost confidence
in the Ba’sh Toorgooma’n(or Chief Interpreter), whose
place is permanent, and who is consequently well ac-
quainted withall the customs of the court, particularly
with the system of bribery; and this knowledge he is
generally very ready to communicate to every new
Ckaldee and Na’ib. A man may be grossly ignorant
of the law, and yet hold the ofiice of Cka’dee of Cairo:
several instances of this kind have occurred: but the
Na’ib must be a lawyer of learning and experience.
When a person has a suit to prefer at the Mahh’-
kem’eh against another individual or party, he goes
thither,and applies to theBa’sh Roos’ool (or chiefof the
sergeants who execute arrests) for a. Rama’! to arrest
the accused. The R.asoo’l receives a piaster or two‘,

and generally gives half of this fee privately to his
chief. The plaintiff and defendant then present them-
selves in the great hall of the Mahh’kem’eh; which is a
large saloon, facing a spacious court, and having an
open front, formed by a row of columns and arches.
Here are seated several officers called S/la'hids, whose
business is to write the statements of the cases to be
submitted to judgment, and who are under the authority
of the Ba'sh Ka’tib (or ChiefSecretary). The plaintiff,
addressing any one of the Sha’hids whom he finds un-
occupied, states his case, and the Sha’hid commits it to
writing, and receives a fee of a piaster or more; after
which, if the case be of a trifling nature, and the
defendant acknowledge the justice of the suit, he (the
Sha’hid) passes sentence; but otherwise he conducts
the two parties before the Na’ib, who holds his court in
an inner apartment. The Na’ib, having heard the case,
desires the plaintiffto procure a fet’wa (or judicial deci-
sion) from the Moof’tee of the sect of the Hhan’afees,
who receives a fee, seldom less than ten piasters, and
often more than a hundred, or two hundred. This is
the course pursued in all cases but those of a very
triflingnature, which are settled with less trouble, and
those of great importance or intricacy. A case of the
latter kind is tried in the private apartment of the
Cka’dee, before the Cka’dee himself, the Na’ib, and the
Moof’tee of the Hhan’afees, who is summoned to hear
it, and to give his decision; and sometimes, in cases of
very great difficulty or moment, several of the ’Ool’ama
of Cairo are, in like manner, summoned. The Moof’tee
hears thecase, and writes his sentence; and the Cka’dee
confirms his judgment, and stamps the paper with his
seal, which is all that he has_to do in any case. The

accused rflay clear himself by his oath,when the plain-
tiff has not witnesses to produce: placing his right
hand on a copy of the Ckoor-a’n, which is held out
to him, he says “
By God, the Great!” three times;
adding “
By what is contained in this of the word of
God I” The witnesses must be men of good repute, or
asserted to be such, and not interested in the cause: in
every case, at least two witnesses are requisite *
(or one
man and two women); and each of these must be
attested to be a person of probityby two others. An
infidel cannot bear witness against a Moos’lim in a case
involving capital or other heavy punishment, and evi-
dence in favour of a son or grandson, or of a fatheror
grandfather, is not received; nor is the testimony of
slaves; neither can a master testify in favour of his
slave.
Thefees, until lately,used to bepaid bythesuccessful
party; but now theyare paid by the other party. The
Cl<a'dee’s fees for decisions in cases respecting the sale
of property are two per cent. on the amount of the pro-
perty: in cases of legacies, four per cent., excepting
when the heir is an orphan not of age, who pays only
two per cent.: for decisions respecting property in
houses or land, when the cost of the property in ques-
tion is known, his fees are two per cent.; but, when the
cost is not known, one year’s rent. These are the legi-
timate fees; but more than the due amount is often
exacted. In cases which do not concern property, the
Cka’dee’s Na/ib fixes the amount of the fees. There
are also other fees than those of the Cka'dee to be paid
" This law is borrowed from the Jews. See Deut. xix., 15. A
man may refuse to give his testimony.
I36 MODERN EGYPTIANS.
afier the decision of the case : for instance, if the
Cka’dee’s fees be two or three hundred piasters, a fee f
about two piasters must be paid to the Ba’sh Toorgoo-
ma’n; about the same to the Ba’sh Roos’ool; and one
piaster to the Rasoo’l,or to each Rasoo’l employed.
The rank of a plaintiffor defendant, or a bribe from
either, often influences the decision of the judge. In
general the Na’ib and Moof’tee take bribes, and the
Cka’dee receives from his Na'ib. On some occasions,
particularly in long litigalions, bribes are given by each
party, and the decision is awarded in favour of him who
pays highest. This frequentlyhappens in difficult law-
suits ; and, even in cases respectingwhich the law is per-
fectly clear, strict justice is not always administered;
bribesand false testimony beingemployedby one of the
parties. The shocking extent to which the practicesof
bribery and suborning false witnesses are carried in
Moos’lim courts of law, and among them in the tribunal
of the Cka’dee of Cairo, may be scarcely credited an the
bare assertion of the fact: some strong proof, resting
on indubitableauthority,may be demanded; and here I
shall give such proof, in a summary of a case which was
tried not long since, and which was related to me by
the Secretaryeand Ima’m of the Sheykh E1-Mah’dee,
who was then supreme Moof’tee of Cairo (being the
chief Moof’tee of the Hhan’afees), and to whom this
case was referred after judgmentin theCka’dee's court.
A Turkishmerchant, residing in Cairo, died, leaving
property to the amount of six thousand purses ", and

no relation to inherit but one daughter. The Seyd
Mohha.1n'madEl-Mahhroo'ckee, the Sha’h-ben’dar(chief
of the merchants of Cairo), hearing of this event,
suborned a common fel’la'hh,who was the how’wa’b (or
door-keeper)of a respected sheykh, and whose parents
(bothof them Arabs) were known to many persons, to
assert himself 9. son of a brotherof the deceased. The
case was brought before the Cka’dee, and, as it was one
of considerable importance. several of the principal
'0ol’amaof the city were summoned to decide it. They
were all bribed or influenced by El-Mahhroo’ckee, as
will presently be shown; false witnesses were brought
forward to swear to the truth of the bow’wa'b's preten-
sions, and others to give testimony to the good cha-
racter of these witnesses. Three thousand purses were .
adjudgedto thedaughter of the deceased, and the other
half of the property to the bow’wa'b. El-Mahhrodckee
received the share of the latter, deducting only three
hundred piasters, which he presented to the bow’wa’b.
The chief Moof’tee, El-Mah’dee,was absent from Cairo
when the case was tried. On his return to the metro-
polis, a few days after, the daughter of the deceased
merchant repaired to his house, stated her case to him,
and earnestly solicited redress. The Moof’tee, though
convinced of the injustice which she had suffered, and
not doubting the truth of what she related respecting
thepart which El-Mahhroo'ckee had taken in this afihir,
told her that he feared it was impossible for him to
annul thejudgment unless there were some irregularity
in the proceedings of the court, but that he would look
at the record of the case in the register of the Mahh’-
kem'eh. Having done this, he betook himself to the
Ba’sha, with whom he was in great favour for his

knowledge and inflexibleintegrity, and complainedto
him that the tribunal of the Cka’dee was disgraced by
the administration of the most flagrant injustice; that
false witness was admitted by the ’Ool’ama, however
evident and glaring it might be; and that ajudgment
which theyhad given in a late case, during his absence,
was the general talk and wonder of the town. The
Ba’sha summoned the Cka’dee, and all the 'Ool’ama
who had tried this case, to meet the Moof’tee in the
Citadel; and,when theyhad assembled there, addressed
them, as from himself, with the Moof'tee’s complaint.
The Cka’dee, appearing,like the ’0ol’ama,highly indig-
nant at this charge, demanded to know upon what it
was grounded. The Ba’sha replied thatit was a general
charge, but particularlygrotmded upon the case in which
the court had admitted the claim of a bow’wa’b to a
relationship and inheritance which theycould not believe
to be his right. The Cka’dee here urged that he had
passed sentence in accordance with the unanimous deci-
sion of the ’Ool’ama then present. “ Let the record of
the case be read,” said the Ba'sha. The journal being
sent for, this was done; and when the secretary had
finished reading the minutes, the Cka’dee, in a loud
tone of proud authority,said, “And I judged so." The
Moof’tee, in a louder and more authoritativetone, ex-
claimed, “
And thyjudgment is false !” All eyes were
fixed in astonishment, now at the Moof’tee, now at the
Ba’sha, now at the other ’Ool'ama. The Cka’dee and
the ’Ool’ama rolled their heads and stroked their
beards. The former exclaimed, tapping his breast, “
I,
the Cka’dee of Musr, pass a false sentence!” “And
we,” said the 'Ool'ama, “we, Sheykh Mah’dee! we,
’Ool’ama el-Isla’m, give a false decision!” “ O Sheykh

mercial transactions with the Ba'sha, could generally
obtain a place in his councils),“
respect the ’0ol’ama.as
theyrespect thee!" “ O Mahhroo’ckee!” exclaimed the
Moof’tee, “
art thouconcerned in this affair? Declare
what part thou hast in it, or else hold thy peace: go,
speak in the assembliesof the merchants, but presume
not again to open thy mouth in the council of the
'Ool’ama!" El-Mahhroo'ckee immediately left the pa-
lace, for he saw how the affair would terminate, and
had to make his arrangements accordingly. The Moof’-
tee was now desired, by the other'Ool’ama, to adduce a
proofof the invalidityof theirdecision. Drawingfrom
his bosom a smallbook on the laws of inheritance, he
read from it, “ To establish a claim to relationshipand
inheritance, the names of the fatherand mother of the
claimant, and those of his father’s father and mother,
and of his mother’s fatherand mother, must be ascer-
tained." The names of the father and mother of the
pretended father of the bow’wa’b, the false witnesses
had not been prepared to give; and this deficiencyin
the testimony (which the ’0ol’ama, in trying the case,
purposely overlooked) now caused the sentence to be
annulled. The bow’wa’bwas brought before the council,
and, denying the imposition of which he had been made
the principal instrument, was, by order of the Ba'sha,
very severely bastinaded; but the only confession that
could be drawn from him by the torture which he eu-
dured was, that he had received nothing more of the
three thousand purses than three hundred piasters.
Meanwhile,El-Mahhroo’ckee had repaired to the bow’-
wa’b’s master: he told _the latter what had happened at
the Citadel, and what he had foreseen would be the

result, put into his hand three thousand purses, and
begged him immediatelyto go to the council. give this
sum of money, and say that it had been placed in his
hands in trust by his servant. This was done, and the
money was paid to the daughterof the deceased.
In another case, when the Cka'dee and the councilof
the 'Ool'ama were influenced in their decision by a
Ba’sha (not Mohham’mad ’Al’ee), and passed a sen-
tence contrary to law, theywere thwarted in the same
manner by El—Mah’dee. This Moof’tee was a rare
example of integrity. It is said that he never took a
fee for a fet’wa. He died shortly after my first visit to
this country. I could mention several other glaring
cases of bribery in the court of the Cka’dee of Cairo;
but the above is sutlicient.
There are five minor Mahh’kem’ehs in Cairo; and
likewise one at its principal port, Boo’la’ck; and one at
its southern port, Musr El-’Atee’ckah. _A Sha’hid from
the great Mahh’kem’eh presides at each of them, as
deputy of the chief Cka/dee, who confirms their acts.
The matters submitted to these minor tribunals are
chiefly respecting the sales of property, and legacies,
marriages,and divorces; for the Cka’dee marries female
orphans under age who have no relations of age to act
as their guardians; and wives often have recourse to
law to compel theirhusbands to divorce them. In every
country-town there is also a Cka’dee, generallya native
of the place, and never a Turk,who decides all cases,
sometimes from his own knowledge of the law, but
commonlyon the authorityof a Mootltee. One Cka'dee
generallyserves for two or three or more villages.
Each of the four orthodox sects of Moos’lims (the

has its Sheykh, or religious chief,who is chosen from
among the most learned of the body, and resides in the
metropolis. The Sheykh of the great mosque ‘El-
Az’har (who is always of the sect of the Sha’fe’ees, and
sometimes Sheykh of thatsect), togetherwiththe other
Sheykhs above mentioned, and the Cka’dee, the Na-
ckee’b el-Ashra’f (thechief oftheSheree'f's, or descend-
ants of theProphet). and several otherpersons, constitute
the council of the ’0ol’ama' (or learned men),by whom
the Turkish Ba’shas and Memloo'k chiefs have often
been kept in awe, and by whom their tyranny has fre-
quently been restricted: but now this learned body has
lost almost all its influenceover the government. Petty
disputes are often, by mutual consent of the parties at
variance, submitted to the judgment of one of the four
Sheykhs first mentioned, as theyare the chief Moof’tees
of their respective sects; and the utmost deference is
alwayspaid to them. Ditficult and delicate causes,which
concern the laws of the Ckoor-a’n or the Traditions,are
also frequently referred by theBa/sha to these Sheykhs;
but their opinion is not always followed by him: for
instance, after consulting them respecting the legalityof
dissecting human bodies, for the sake of acquiring
anatomical knowledge, and receiving their declaration
that it was repugnant to the laws of the religion, he,
nevertheless, has caused it to be practised by Moos’lim
students of anatomy.
The police of the metropolis is more under the direc-
tion of the military than of the civil power. A few
years ago it wasundertheauthorityof the Wa’lee and the

Za'bit,' but since my first visit to this country the office
of the former has been abolished. He was charged
with the apprehension of thieves and other criminals;
and under his jurisdiction were the public women, of
whom he kept a list, and from each of whom he exacted
a tax. He also took cognizance of the conduct of the
women in general; and,when he found a female to have
been guiltyof a single act of incontinence,he added her
name to the list of the public women, and demanded
from her the tax, unless she preferred, or could afford,
to escape that ignominy, by giving to him, or to his
oflicers, a considerable bribe. This course was always
pursued, and is still, by a person who farms the tax of
the public women ', in the case of unmarried females,
and generally in the case of the married also; but the
'
latter are sometimes privatelyput to death,if theycannot,
by bribery or some other artifice, save themselves.
Such proceedings are, however, in two points, contrary
to the law, which ordains that a person who accuses a
woman of adultery or fornication, without producing
four witnesses of the crime, shall be scourged with
eighty stripes, and decrees other punishments than
those of degradation and tribute against women con-
victed of such ofl'ences.
The office of the Za'bit has before been mentioned.
He is now the chief of the police. His ofiicers, who
have no distinguishing mark to render them known as
such, are interspersed through the metropolis: they
often visit the coffee-shops, and observe the conduct,
and listen to the conversation, of the citizens. Many of
them are pardoned thieves. They accompanythe mili-

tary guards in their nightly rounds throughthe streets
of the metropolis. Here, none but the blind are
allowed to go out at night later than about an hour and
a half after sunset, withouta lantern or a light of some
kind. Fewpersons are seen in the streets later thantwo
or three hours after sunset. At the fifthor sixth hour,
one might pass through the whole lengthof the metro-
polis and scarcely meet more than a dozen or twenty
persons, excepting the watchmen and guards, and the
porters at the gates of the by-streets and quarters. The
sentinel, or guard, calls out to the approaching pas-
senger, in Turkish, “ Who is that' ?” and is answered,
in Arabic,“
A citizen-f.” The private watchman, in the
same case, exclairns, “Attest the unity of God:!” or
merely, “Attest the unity§!" The answer given to
this is, “There is no deity but Godll !" which Chris-
tians, as well as Moos’lims, object not to say; theformer
understanding these words in a different sense from the
latter. It is supposed that a thief,or a person bound
on any unlawful undertaking, would not dare to utter
these words. Some persons loudly exclaim, in reply to
the summons of the watchman, “ There is no deity but
God: Mohham'mad is God's Apostle.”
The Za’bit,or A’gha of the police, used frequentlyto
go about the metropolis by night, often accompanied
only by the executioner and the she’alegee, or bearer of
a kind of torch called she’aleh, which is still in use.

This torch burns, soon after it is lighted, without a
flame, excepting when it is waved throughthe air, when
it suddenly blazes forth : it therefore answers the same
purpose as our dark lantern. The burningend is some-
times concealed in a small pot or jar, or covered with
somethingelse, when not required to give light; but it
is said thatthievesoften smell it in time to escape meet-
ing the bearer. When a person without a light is met
by the police at night, he seldom attempts resistance or
flight; the punishment to which he is liable is beating.
The chief of the police had an arbitrary power to put
any criminal or offender to death, without trial, and
when not obnoxious, by law, to capital punishment ;
and so also had many inferior officers, as will be seen in
subsequent pages of this work: but within the last two
or three years, instances of the exercise of such power
have been very rare, and I believe theywould not now
be permitted. The officers of the Z9.’bit perform their
nightly rounds with the military guards merely as being
better acquainted than the latter with the haunts and
practices of thieves and other bad characters; and the
Za'bit himself scarcely ever exercises any penal autho-
rity beyondthatof heatingor flogging.
Very curious measures, such as we read of in some of
the “ Tales of a Thousand and One Nights,” were often
adopted by the police magistrates of Cairo, to discover
an offender, before the late innovations. I may mention
an instance. The authenticityof the following case,
and of several others of a similar nature, is well known.
I shall relate it in the manner in which I have heard it
told. A poor man applied one day to the A’gha of the
police, and said, “
Sir, there came to me, to-day, a

woman, and she said to me, ‘Take this clzoors", and
let it remain in your possession for a time, and lend me
five hundred piasters:’ and I took it from her, Sir, and
gave her the five hundred piasters, and she went away:
andwhen she was gone away, I said to myself, ‘
Let me
look at this ckoors ;’ and I looked at it, and behold,it
was yellow brass: and I slapped my face, and said, ‘ I
will go to the A’gha{ and relate my story to him; per-
haps he will investigate the affair, and clear it up ;’ for
there is none thatcan help me in this matter but thee.”
The A’gha said to him, “
Hear what I tell the, man.
Take whatever is in thyshop; leave nothing; and lock
itup ; and to-morrowmorning go early; and when thou
hast opened the shop, cry out, ‘
Alas for my property!’
then take in thyhands two clods, and beatthyselfwith
them, and cry, ‘
Alas for the property of others!’ and
whoever says to thee, ‘
What is the matter with thee?'
do thou answer, ‘ The property of others is lost: a
pledge that I had, belongingto a woman, is lost; if it
were my own, I should not thus lament it;’ and this
will clear up the aflia.ir.” The man promised to do as he
was desired. He removed everything from his shop,
and early the next morning he went and opened it, and
began to cry out, “
Alas for the propertyof others !” and
he took two clods, and beat himself with them, and went
about every district of the city, crying, “ Alas for the
property of others! a pledge thatI had, belongingto a
woman, is lost; if it were my own, I should not thus
lament it.” The woman who had given him the ckoors
in pledge heard of this, and discovered that it was the
man whom she had cheated; so she said to herself, “ Go

and bring an action against him.” She we11t to his
shop, riding on an ass, to give herself consequence, and
said to him, “
Man, give me my property thatis in thy

Thytongue

dost thou lose my property?
By Al’la.h! I willgo to theA’gha, and inform him of it.”
“
Go," said he ; and she went, and told her case. The
A’gha sent for theman; and when he had come, said to
his accuser, “
What is thy property in his possession?”
She answered. “
A ckoors of red Venetian gold.”
“
Woman,” said the A’gha, “
I have a gold ckoors
here : I should like to show it thee.”. She said, “
Show
it me, Sir, for I shall know my ckoors." The A'gha
then untied a handkerchief, and, taking out of it the
ckoors which she had given in pledge, said “
Look.”
She looked at it and knew it, and hung down her head.
The A’gha said, “
Raise thy head, and say where are
the five hundred piasters of thisman.” She answered,
“
Sir, they are in my house.” The executioner was sent
with her to her house, but withouthis sword; and the
woman, having gone into the house,brought out a purse
containing the money, and went back withhim. The
money was given to the man from whom it had been
obtained, and the executioner was then ordered to take
the woman to the Roomey’leh(a large open placebelow
the Citadel),and there to hehead her, which he did.

GOVERNMENT. 14 7
to produce his‘ scales, weights, and measures, and tries
whether they be correct. He also inquires the prices
of provisions at the shops where such articles are sold.
Often, too, he stops a servant, or otherpassenger, in the
street, whom he may chance to meet carrying any article
of food thathehas just bought, and asks him for what
sum, or at what weight, he purchased it. When he
finds that a shopkeeper has incorrect scales, weights, or
measures, or thathe has sold a thingdeficient in weight,
or above the regular market-price,he punishes him on
the spot. The general punishment is beatingor flog-
ging. Once I saw a man-tormented in a different way,
for selling bread deficient in weight. A hole was bored
through his nose, and a cake of bread, about a span
wide and a fing'er's breadthin thickness,was suspended
to it by a piece of string. He was stripped naked, with
the exception of having a piece of linen about his loins,
and tied, withhis arms bound behindhim,to the bars of
a window of a. mosque called the Ashrafee'yeh, in the
principal street of the metropolis, his feet resting upon
the sill. He remained thus about three hours, exposed
to the gaze of the multitude which thronged the street,
and to the scorching rays of thesun.
A person who was appointed Mohh’tes’ib shortly after
my former visit to this country (Moos’tuf'a Ka’shif, a
Koord) exercised his power in a most brutal manner,
clipping men’s ears (thatis, cuttingofi' the lobe, or ear-
lap), not only for the most trifling transgression, but
often for no offence whatever. He once met an old
man driving alongseveral assesladen withwater-melons,
and, pointing to one of the largest of these fruits, asked
its price. The old man put his finger and thumbto his
ear-lap, and said, “ Cut it, Sir.” He was asked again
143 MODERN EGYPT!ANS.
and again, and gave the same answer. The Mohh'tes’ih,
angry,but unableto refrainfromlaughing,said,“
Fellow,
are you mad or deaf?” “
No,” replied the oldman,“
I
am neither mad nor deaf; but I know that,if I were to
say the price of the melon is ten fild’dahs,you would
say ‘
Clip his ear;’ and if I saidfive fud’dahs, or one
fud’dah,you would say ‘
Clip his ear :’ therefore clip it at
once, and let me pass on.” His humour saved him.
Clipping ears was theusual punishment inflictedby this
Mohh’tes'ib; but sometimes he tortured in a dilferent
manner. A butcher, who had sold some meat wanting
two ounces of its due weight,he punished by cutting off
two ounces of flesh from his back. A seller of Izoondfeh
(a kind of paste resembling vermiceili) having made
his customers pay a trifle more than was just, he caused
him to be stripped, and seated upon the round copper
tray on which the koona’feh was baked, and kept so
until he was dreadfullyburnt. He generallypunished
dishonest butchers byputting a book through their nose,
and hanging a piece of meat to it. Meeting,one day,a
man carrying a large crate full of earthen water-bottles
frvm Semennoo’d, which he ofi‘ered for sale as made at
Ckin’ié, he caused his attendants to break each bottle
separately against the vender's head. Moos’tut"a Ka’shif
also exercised his tyranny in other cases than those.
which properly fell under his jurisdiction. He once took
a fancy to send one of his horses to a bath,and desired
the keeper of a bath in his neighbourhood to prepare
for, receiving it, and to wash it well, and make its coat
very smooth. The bath-keeper, annoyed at so extra-
ordinary a command, ventured to suggest that. as the
pavements of the bath were of marble, the horse might
slip, and fall; and also, thatit might take cold on going
aovnsnunzrr. 149
out; and that it would, therefore,be better for him to
convey to the stable the contents of the cistern o ithe
bath in buckets, and there to perform the operation.
Moos’tuf’a Ks/shif said, “
I see how it is; youdo not
like that my horse should go into your bath.” He
desired some of his servants to throw him down, and
beat him with staves until he should tell them to stop.
They did so; and beat the poor man tillhe died.
A few years ago there used to be carried before the
Mohh’tes’ib, when going his rounds to examine the
weights and measures, &c., a pair of scales larger than
thatused at present. Its beamfitis said, was a hollow
tube, containing some quicksilver; by means of which,
the bearer, knowing those persons who had bribedhis
master, and those who had not, easilymade either scale
preponderate.
As the Mohh’tes’ib is the overseer of the public mar-
kets, so there are oflicers who have a similarcharge in
superintending each branch of the Ba’sha’s trade and
manufactures; and some of these persons have been
allowed to perpetrate most abominable acts of tyranny
and cruelty. One of this class, who was named ’Al'ee
Bey, Na'zir cl-Ckoomaflrh (or Overseer of the Linen),
when he found a person in possession of a private loom,
or selling the produce of such a loom, generally bound
him up in a piece of his linen, soaked in oil and tar;
then suspended him, thus enveloped, to a branch of a
tree, and set light to the wrapper. After having de-
stroyed a number of men in this horrible manner, he
was himself, among many others,burnt to death,by the
explosion of a powdermagazineon the northern slope
of the Citadel of Cairo, in 1824, the year before my
first arrival in Egypt. A friend of mine, who spoke to
150 MODERN EGYPTIANS.
me of the atrocities of thismonster, added, “
When
his corpse was taken to be buried, the SheykhEl-’Aroo’-
see (who was Sheykh of the great mosque El-Az’har)
recited the funeral prayers over it, in the mosque of the
Hhas’aney’n; and I acted as moobal’li_qh (to repeat the
words of the Ima'm): when the Sheykh uttered the
words, ‘
Give your testimony respecting him,’ and when
I had repeated them, no one of all the persons present,
and they were many, presumed to give the answer,
‘ He was of the virtuous :’ all were silent: to make the
circumstance more glaring, I said again, ‘Give your
testimony respecting him :' but not an answer was
heard; and the Sheykh, in confusion, said, but in a very
low voice, ‘
May God have mercy upon him.’ Now we
may certainly say of this cursed man,” continued my
friend, “ that he is gone to hell: yet his wife is con-
stantly having khut"meh.r (recitals of the Ckoor-a’n)
performed in her house for him; and lights two wax
candles, for his sake, every evening, at the niche of the
mosque of the Hhas’aney”n."
Every quarter in the metropolishas its sheykh, called
Sheykh el-Hha’rah,whose influenceis exerted to main-
tain order, to settle any trifling disputes among the
inhabitants,and to expel those who disturb the peace of
their neighbours. The whole of the metropolis is also
divided into eight districts, over each of which is a
sheykh, called Sheykh el-Toomn.
The membersof various trades and manufacturesin
the metropolis and other large towns have also their
respective sheykhs, to whom all disputes respecting
matters connected with those trades or crafts are sub-
mitted for arbitration; and whose sanction is required
for the admission of new members.
GOVERNMENT. 151
The servants in the metropolis are likewise under the
authorityof particular sheykhs. Any person in want of
a servant may procure one by applying to one of these
officers, who, for a small fee (two or three piasters),
becomes responsible for the conduct of the man whom
he recommends. Should a servant so engaged rob his
master, the latter gives informationto the Sheykh, who,
whether he can recover the stolen property or not, must
indemnify the master.
Even the common thieves used, not many years
since, to respect a superior, who was called their sheykh.
He was often required to search for stolen goods, and
to bringoffenders to justice ; which he generallyaccom-
plished. It is very remarkable that the same strange
system prevailedamong the ancient Egyptians‘.
The Coptic Patriarch, who is the head of his church,
judges petty causes among his people in the metropolis;
and the inferior clergy do the same in other places;
but an appeal maybemade to the Cka’dee. A Moos’lim
aggrieved by a Copt may demand justice from the
Patriarch or the Cka’dee: a Copt who seeks redress
from a Moos’lim must apply to theCka'dee. The Jews
are similarlycircumstanced. The Franks,or Europeans.
in general, are not answerable to any other authority
than that of their respective consuls, excepting when
they are aggressors against a Moos’lim : theyare then
surrendered to the Turkish authorities, who, on the
other hand, will render justice to the Frank who is
aggrievedby a Moos’lim.

theirown countrymen. The whole of Egypt is divided
ihto several large provinces, each of which is governed
by an ’Osma’nlee(or a Turk); and these provinces are
-subdivided into districts, which are governed by native
oflicers, with the titles of Ma-moo’r and Na’zz'r. Every
village, as well as town, hm also its Sheykh, called
Sheykh el-Bel’ed; who is one of the native Moos’lim
inhabitants. All the oflicers above mentioned, except-
ing the last, were formerlyTurks; and there were other
Turkish governors of small districts, who were ‘called
Ka'shzfs', and Clza/z'm-macka’ms:the change was made
very shortly before my present visit to this country; and
the Fella’hhee’n complain that their condition is worse
than it was before ; but it is generallyfrom the tyranny
of their great Turkish governors that they suffer most
severely.
The following case will convey some idea of the con-
dition of Egyptian peasants in some provinces. A
Turk*, infamous for many barbarous acts, presidingat
the town of Tun’ta, in the Delta, went one night to the
government granary of that town, and findingtwo pea-
sants sleeping there, asked them who they were, and
what was their business in that place. One of them
said that he had brought 130 ardeb’bs of corn from a
village of the district ; and the other, that he had
brought 60 ardeb’bs from the land belonging to the
town. “You rascal!” said the governor to the latter;
“thisman brings 130 ardeb’bs from the lands of a small
village; and you, but 60 from the lands of the town.”
“
This man,” answered the peasant of Tun’ta, “

corn but once a week ; and I am now bringingit every
day.” “
Be silent !” said the governor; and, pointing
to a neighbouring tree, ordered one of the servants of
the granary to hang the peasant to one of its branches.
The order was obeyed, and the governor returned to
his house. The next morning he went again to the
granary, and saw a man bringing in a large quantity of
corn. Heasked who he was, and what quantity he
had brought; and was answered, by the hangmanof the
preceding night, “
This is the man, Sir, whom I
banged by your orders, last night; and he has brought
160 ardeb’bs.” “'What !” exclaimed the governor:
"has he risen from thedead i”’ He was answered “No,
Sir: I hanged him so that his toes touched the ground;
and when you were gone, I untied the rope: you did
not order me to killhim.” The 'I\1rk muttered, “Aha!
hanging and killing are different things2 Arabic is
copious: next time I will say kill. Take ‘care of Ab’oo
Da’-oo’d*.” This is his nick-name.~
Another occurrence may here be aptly related, as a
further illustration of the nature of the government to
whichthepeople of Egypt are subjected. A fella/hh,who
was appointed Na’zir (or governor) of the district of El-
Men’oo’fee’yeh (thesouthernmostdistrict of the Delta),
9. short time before my present visit to Egypt, in col-
lecting the taxes at a village, demanded, of a poor pea-
sant, the sum of sixty riya’ls (ninety fud’dahs each,
making a sum total of ahundred and thirty-five pias-
ters, which was then equivalent to about thirtyshillings).,
The poor mam urged that he possessed nothingbut a

cow, which barely ulforded sustenance to himself and his
family. Instead of pursuing the method usually fol-
lowed when a fella'hh declares himself unable to pay the
tax demanded of him, which is to give him a severe
bastinading, the Na’zir, in this case, sent the Sheykh
el-Bel’ed to bring the poor peasant’s cow, and desired
some of the fella’hhee'n to buy it. They saying that
they had not suflicient money, he sent for a butcher,
and desired him to kill the cow; which was done: he
thentold him to divide it into sixty pieces. Theibutcher
asked for his pay ; and was given the head of- the cow.
Sixty fella’hhee’n were then called together; and each
of them was compelled to purchase, for a riya’l, a piece
of the cow. The owner of the cow went, weeping and
complaining, to the Na’zir’s superior, thelate Mohham’-

am oppressed and in misery: I had no property but
one cow, a milch cow: I and my family lived upon her
milk; and she ploughed for me, and threshedmy corn;
and my whole subsistence was derived from her: the
Na/zirhas taken her, and killed her, and cut her up into
sixty pieces, and sold the pieces to my neighbours; to
each a piece, for one riya’l; so that he obtained but
sixty riya’ls for the whole, while the value of the cow
was a hundred and twenty riya’ls, or more. I am
oppressed and in misery, and a stranger in the place,
for I came from another village; but the Na.'zir had no
pity on me. I and my familyare become beggars, and
have nothingleft. Have mercy upon me, and give me
justice: I implore it by thyhharee’m." :1‘he Defturda’r,
having caused the Na’zir to be brought before him,
asked him, “ Where is the cow of this fella’hh?" “
I
have sold it,” said the Na/zir. “ For how much?”
“For sixty riya’ls." “
Why did you kill it and sell it?”
GOVERNIIENT. 155
“ He owed sixty riya’lsfor land: so I took his cow, and
killed it, and sold it for the amount.” “ Where is the
butcher that killed it?” “ In Menoo’£" ’.[‘he butcher
was sent for, and brought. The Defiurda’r said to him,
“Why did you kill this man’s cow?” “The Na’zir
desired me,” he answered, “ and I could not oppose
him: if I had attempted to do so, he would have beaten
me, and destroyed my house : I killed it; and the
Na’zir gave me the head as my reward." “
Man,” said
the Deiturda’r, “ do you know the persons who bought
the" meat?" The butcher replied that he did. The
Defturda’r then desired his secretary to write the names
of the sixty men, and an order to the sheykh of their
village,to bring them to Menoo'f,where thiscomplaint
was made. The Na/zir and butcher were placed in
confinementtillthe next morning; when the sheykh of
the village came, with the sixty fella’hhee’n. The two
prisoners were then brought again before the Deftur-
da’r, who said to the sheykh and the sixty peasants,
~
“
Was the value of this man's cow sixty riya'ls?” “
0
our master,” theyanswered, “ her value was greater.”
The Defturda’r sent for the Cka’dee of Menoo’f, and
said to him, “
O Cka’dee, here is a man oppressed by
this Na’zir, who has taken his cow, and killed it; and
sold its flesh for sixty riya’ls: what is thy judgmenti”’
The Cka’dee replied, “ He is a cruel tyrant, who op-
presses every one under his authority. Is not a cow
worth a hundred and twenty riya’ls,or more? and he
has sold this ‘one for sixty riya’ls: this is tyranny
towards the owner.” The Delturda’r then said to some
of his oldiers, “Take the Na/zir, and strip him, and
bindhim.” Thisdone, he said to thebutcher, “
Butcher,
dost thou not fear God? Thou hast killed the cow
unjustly.” The butcher again urged that he was

obliged to obey the Na’zir. “
Then,” said the Def-
turda’r, “ if I order theeto do a thing,wiltthoudo it i”’
“ I will do it,” answered the butcher. “Kill the
Na’zir,” said the Defturda’r. Immediately,several of
the soldiers present seized the Na’zir, and threwhim
down; and the butcher cut his throat, in the regular
orthodox manner of killinganimals for food. “
Now,
cut him up,” said the Defturda’r, “into sixty pieces.”
This was done : the people concerned in the affair, and
many others, looking on; but none daring to speak.
The sixty peasants who had bought the meat of the
cow were then called forward, one after another, and
each was made to take a piece of the"flesh of theNa’zir,
and to pay for it two riya’ls; so that a hundred and
twenty riya’lswere obtained from them: they were then
dismissed; but the butcher remained. The Cka'dee
was asked what should be the reward of the butcher;
and answered that he should be paid as he had been
paid by the Na'zir. The Dei‘turda’r therefore ordered
that the head of the Na’zir should be given to him;
and the butcher went away with his worse thanvalueless
burden, thanking God that he had not been more
unfortunate, and scarcely believing himself to have so
easily escaped until he arrived at his village. The
money paid for the flesh of the Na’zir was given to the
owner of the cow.
Most of the governors of provinces and districts
carry their oppression far beyond the limits to which
theyare authorizedto proceed by the Ba’sha; and even
the sheykh of a village, in executing the commands of
his superiors, abuses his lawful power: bribes, and the
ties of relationship and marriage, influence him and
them; and by lessening the oppression of some, who
are more able to bear it, greatly increase that of others.
GOVEINKENT. .

But the office of a sheykh of a villageis far from being
a sinecure : at the period when the taxes are demanded
of him, he frequently receives a more severe hastinad-
ing than any of his inferiors; for when the population
of a village does not yield the sum required, their
sheykh is often beaten for their default ; and not
always does he produce his own proportion until he has
been well thrashed. All the fella’hhee’n are proud of
the stripes they receive for withholdingtheir contribu-
tions; and are often heard to boast of the number of
blows which were inflicted upon them before theywould
give up their money. Ammianus Marcellinus gives
precisely the same character to the Egyptians of his
time‘.
The revenue of the Ba’sl1a of Egypt is generallysaid
to amount to about three millions of pounds sterlingf.
Nearly half arises from the direct taxes on land, and
from indirect emotions from the fella’hhee’n : the
remainder, principally from the custom-taxes, the tax
on palm-trees, a kind of income-tax, and the sale of
various productions of the land; by which sale, the
government, in most instances, obtains a -profit of more
than fifty per cent.
The present Ba’sha has increased his revenue to this
amount by most oppressive measures. He -has dispos-
sessed of theirlands all theprivatepgoprietorsthroughout
his dominions, allotting to each, as a partial compen-
sation, a pension for life, proportioned to the extent and
qualityof the land which belonged to him. The farmer

I58 MODERN EGYPTIANS.
has, therefore, nothingto leave to his children but his
but, and perhaps a few cattle and some small savings.
The direct taxes on land are proportioned to the
natural advantages of the soil. Their average amount
is about 8:. per fedda'n, which is nearlyequal to an
Englishacre’. But the cultivator can never calculate
exactlythe full amount of what the government will
require of him: he suffers from indirect exactions of
quantities, differing in different years, but always levied
per fedda’n, of butter, honey, wax, wool, baskets of
palm-leaves,ropes of the fibres of the palm-tree, and
other commodities: he is also obliged to pay the hire of
the camels which convey his grain to the government
shoo’neh (or granary), and to defray various other
expenses. A portion of theproduce of his land is taken
bythe government1‘, and sometimes the whole produce,
at a fixed and fair price, which, however, in many parts
of Egypt,is retained to make up for the debts of the
insolvent peasants 1. The fella’hh, to supply the bare
necessaries of life, is often obliged to steal, and convey
secretlyto his hut, as much as he can of the produce of
his land. He may either himself supply the seed for
his land, or obtain it ‘as a loan from the government;
but in the latter case he seldom obtains a suflicient
quantity; a considerable portion being generally stolen
’ The fedda’n has latelybeen reduced: it was equal to about
an English acre and one-tenth a few years ago; and somewhat
more at an earlier period.

by the persons throughwhose hands it passes before he
receives it. To relate all the oppressions which the
peasantry of Egypt endure, would require too much
space in the present work. It would be scarcely pos-
sible for them to sutfer more, and live. It may be
hardly necessary, therefore, to add, that few of them
engage, with assiduity, in the labours of agriculture,
unless compelled to do so by their superiors.
The Ba’sha has not only taken possession of the
lands of the private proprietors, but he has also thrown
into his treasury a considerable proportion of the in-
comes of religious and charitable institutions, deeming-
their accumulated wealth superfluous. He first vim-
posed a tax (of nearlyhalf the amount of the regular
land-tax) upon all land which had become a wuckf
(or legacyunalienableby law) to any mosque, fountain,
publicschool, &c.; and afterwards took absolute posses-
sion of such lands, granting certain annuities in lieu of
them, for keeping in repair the respective buildings,and
for the maintenance of those persons attached to them,
as Na/zirs (or wardens), religious ministers, inferior
servants, students, and other pensioners. He has thus
rendered himself extremely odious ‘to most ‘persons of
the religious and learned professions, and especially to
the Na’zirs of themosques, who too generallyenriched
themselves from the funds intrusted to their care, which
were, in most cases, superabundant. The household
property of the mosques and other public institutions
(thewnckfs of numerous individuals of various ranks)
the Ba’sha has hitherto left inviolate.
The tax upon the palm-trees has been calculated to
amount to about a hundred thousand pounds sterling.
I60 MODERN EGYPTIANS.
The trees are rated accordingto theirqualities;generally
at a. piaster and a halfeach.
The income-tax,which is called_/ir'deh, is generally
a twelfih or more of a man's annual income or salary,
when thatcan be ascertained. The maximum,hawever,
is fixed at five hundred piasters. In the large towns
it is levied upon individuals; in the villages, upon
houses. The income-tax of all the inhabitants of the
metropolis amounts to eight thousandpurses, or about
forty thousandpounds sterling. '
The inhabitants of the metropolis and»of other large
towns pay a. heavy tax on grain, Szc. The tax on each
kind of grain isveighteen piasters per ardeb’b (or about
five bushels) ; which sum is equal to the price of wheat
in the country after a good harvest.

HAVING sufiiciently considered the foundations of the
moral and social state of the Moos’lims of Egypt, we
may now take a view of theirdomestic life and ordinary
habits; and, first, let us confine our attention to the
higher and middle orders.
A master of a family,or any person who has arrived
at manhood, and is not in a menial situation, or of very
low condition, is commonlyhonoured withthe appella-
tion of “ the sheykh,” prefixed to his -name. The word
“
sheykh” literally signifies “
an elder,” or “
an aged‘
person ;” but it is used as synonymous withour appel-
lation of “ Mister*:” a sheree’f, or descendant of the
Prophet, is called “ theseg/d,” or“ theseg/'3/id” (master,
or lord), whatever be his station. Many sheree’fs are
employedin thelowest oflices: there are servants, dust-
men, andbeggars,ofthehonouredraceofMohham’mad;
but all of them are entitled to the distinctive appellation
above mentioned, and privileged to wear the green
turban 1*; many of them, however, not only among
* Though more particularlyapplied to a learned man, or a
reputed saint.
+ Men and women of this caste ofien contract marriage:with
persons who are not members of the same; and as the title of
sheree’f is inherited from either of the parents, the number of
persons who enjoy thisdistinction has becomevery considerable-
162 MODERN EGYPTIANS.
those of humble station, but also among the wealthy,
and particularly the learned, assume neither of these
prerogatives; preferring the title of “
sheykh,” and the
white turban. A man who has performed the pilgrim-
age is generally called “thehha’gg*,-” and a woman
who has alike distinguished herself, “the hha’ggeh:”
yet there are many pilgrims who, like those sheree’fs
just before alluded to, preferthe title of “
sheykh.” The
general appellation of a lady is “the silt,” which signi-
fies “the mistress," or
“
the lady.”
Before I describe the ordinary habits of the master of
a family,I must mention the various classes of persons
of whom the family may consist. The hharee’m, or
the females of the house, have distinct apartments
allotted to them; and into these apartments (which, as
well as the persons to whom they are appropriated, are
called “
the hharee’m”) no males are allowed to enter,
excepting the master of the family,and certain other
near relations, and children. The hharee’m may~con-
sist, first, of a wife, or wives (to the number of four) ;
secondly, of female slaves, some of whom, namely,
white and Abyssinianslaves, are generallyconcubines,
and others (the black slaves) kept merely for servile
oflices,as cooking,waiting upon the ladies, &c.; thirdly,
of femalefree servants, who are, in no case, concubines,
or not legitimatelyso. The male dependants may con-
sist of white and of black slaves,and free servants; but
are mostlyof the last-mentionedclass. Very few of the
Egyptians avail themselves of the licence which their

DOMESTIC LIFE. 163
religion allows them,of having four wives; and still
smaller is the number of those who have two or more
wives, and concubines besides. Even most of those
men who have but one wife are content, for the sake of
domestic peace, if for no other reason, to remain without
a concuhine slave: but some prefer the possession of an
Abyssinianslave to the more expensive maintenance of
a wife; and keep a black slave girl, or an Egyptian
female servant, to wait upon her, to clean and keep in
order the apartments of the hharee’m, and to cook. It
is seldom that two or more wives are kept in the same
house: if theybe, they generally have distinct apart-
ments. Of male servants, the master of a familykeeps,
if he can afford to do so, one or more to wait upon him
and his male guests ; another,who is called a .rack’cka,
or water-carrier,but who is particularly a servant of the
hharee'm,and attends the ladies when theygo out‘; a
bou/wa’b, or door-keeper, who constantly sits at the
door of the house; and a sa’is, or groom, for the horse,
mule, or ass. Few of the Egyptians have memloo’lz.r,
or male white slaves; most of these beingin the passes-
sion of rich ’0sma’nlees(or Turks); and scarcely any
but Turks of high rank keep eunuchs: but a wealthy
Egyptian merchant is proud of having a black slave to
ride or walk behindhim, and to carry his pipe.
The Egyptian is a. very early riser; as he retires to
sleepat an earlyhour : it is his duty to be up and dressed
before daybreak, when he should say the ,'moming-
prayers. In general, while the master of a familyis
performing the religious ablution, and saying his pray-

ers, his wife or slave is preparing for him a cup of
cofi'ee, and fillinghis pipe, which she presents to him as
soon as he has acquitted himselfof his religious duties.
Many of the Egyptianstake nothingbeforenoon but
thecup of coffee and the pipe: others take a light meal
at an early hour. The meal of breakfast (el-faloo’r)
generally consists of bread, with eggs, butter, cheese,
clouted cream, or curdled milk,&c.; or of afateéreh,
which is a kind of pastry. saturated with butter, made
very thin,and folded over and over like a napkin: it is
eaten alone, or with a little honey poured over it, or
sugar. A very common dish for breakfast is foo’!
moodenlmes,or beans,similarto our horse-beans,slowly
boiled, during a whole night, in an earthen vessel,
buried, all but the neck, in the hot ashes of an oven or
a bath,and having the mouth closely stopped: theyare
eaten with linseed-oil, or butter, and generally with a
little lime-juice: thus prepared, they are sold in the
morning in the soo’cks (or markets) of Cairo and other
towns. A meal is often made (by those who cannot
afford luxuries) of bread and a mixture called doock’-
ckah, which is commonly composed of salt and pepper,
with za’atar (or wild marjoram)or mint or cumin-seed,
and withone. or more, or all, ofthefollowingingredients;
namely, coriander-seed, cinnamon, sesame, and hhom’-
moo: (or chick-peas): each mouthful of bread is dipped
in this mixture. Thebread is always made in the form
of a round flat cake, generally about a span in width,
and a finger’sbreadthin thickness.
The pipe and the cup of coffee are enjoyed by almost
allpersons who can afford such luxuries, very early in
the morning, and oftentimes during the day. There
are many men who are scarcely ever seen without a

pipe either in their hand or carried behind them by a
servant. The smoker keeps his tobacco for dailyuse in
a purse or bag made of shawl-stulf, or silk,or velvet,
which is often accompaniedwith a small pouch contain-
ing a flint and steel, and some agnric tinder, and is
usually crammed into his bosom.
The pipe (which is called by many names, as shib'-
ook“‘, ’oo’d, &c.) is generallybetween four and five feet
long: some pipes are shorter, and some are of greater
length. Themost common kind used in Egypt is made
of a kind of wood called gu1’mush'ucIz1‘. The greater
part of the stick (from the. mouth-piece to about three
quarters of its length) is covered with silk, which is
confined at each extremity by gold thread,often inter-
twined with coloured silks,or by a tube of gilt silver;
and at the lower extremity of the covering is a tassel of
silk. The covering was originally designed to be
moistened with water, in order to cool the pipe, and,
consequently, the smoke, by evaporation: but this is
only done when the pipe is old, or not handsome.
Cherry-stick pipes, which are never covered, are also
used by many persons, particularly in the winter. In
summer, the smoke is not so cool from the cherry-stick
pipe as from the kind before mentioned. The bowl
(called hhag’ar) is of baked earth, coloured red or
brown 1. The mouth-piece (fi)om’, or turkee'beh) is
composed of two or more piecesof opaque, light-coloured
amber, interjoined by ornaments of enamelled gold,
agate, jasper, éornelian, or some other precious sub-

stance. It is the most costlypart of thepipe: the price
of one of the kind most generallyused by persons of
the middle order, is from about one to three pounds
sterling. A wooden tube passes through it. This is
ofien changed, as it soon becomes foul from the oil of
the tobacco. The pipe also requires to be cleaned very
often, which is done with low, by means of a long wire.
Many poor men in Cairo gain their livelihood by going
about to clean pipes.
The tobacco smoked by persons of the higher orders,
and some others, in Egypt, is of a very mild and de-
licious flavour. It is mostly from the neighbourhood of
E1-La’dickee'yeh, in Syria. The best kind is the
“
mountain tobacco" (doolzh’kha’ngeb’elee). A stronger
kind, which takes its name from the town of'
Sodr
(dookh’kha’nSoo’ree), sometimes mixed with geb/elee, is
used by most persons of the middle orders. In smok-
ing, the people of Egypt and of other countries of the
East draw in their breathfreely; so that much of the
smoke descends into the lungs; and the terms which
theyuse to express “
smokingtobacco" signify “ drink-
ing smoke,” or “
drinkingtobacco:” for the same word
signifies both “
smoke" and “tobacco.” Few of them
spit while smoking: I have very seldom seen any do so.
Some of the Egyptians use the Persian pipe, in which
the smoke passes through water. The pipe of this kind
most commonly used by persons of the higher classes
is called na'r_qee’leh,becausethe vessel that contains the
water is a cocoa-nut, of which “
na’rgee'leh” is an
Arabicname. Another kind, which has a glass vase,
is called shedsheh "‘. Each has a very long, flexible

from Persia, is used in the water-pipe: it is first
washed several times, and put into the pipe-bowl while
damp; and two or three pieces of live charcoal are
placed on the top. Its flavour is mild, and very agree-
able ; but the strong inhalation necessary in this mode
of smoking is injurious to persons of delicate lungs‘.
In usingthePersian pipe, the person as freely draws the
smoke into his lungs as he would inhale pure air. The
great prevalence of liver-complaintsin Arabia is attri-
buted to the general use of the na’rgee’leh; and many
persons in Egypt suffer severely from the same cause.
A kind of pipe, called gq'zeh1', which is similar to the
na’rgee'leh,excepting thatit. has a short cane tube, in-
stead of the snake (or flexible one), and no stand, is
used by men of the lowest class, for smokingboth the
toomb_a’kand the intoxicatinghhashce’sh, or hemp.
The cofi'ee (ckah’wehI) is made very strong, and
withoutsugar or milk. The coffee-cup (which is called
_/inga’n) is small; generally holding not quite an ounce
and a half of liquid. It is of porcelain, or Dutch-ware,
and, beingwithout a handle, is placed within another
cup (called zurf), of silver or brass, according to the
circumstances of the owner, and, both in‘shape and size,
nearly resembling our egg-cup §. In preparing the

coffee, the water is first made to boil: the coffee
(freshly roasted, and pounded) is then put in, and
stirred; after which the pot is again placed on the fire,
once or twice, until the coffee begins to simmer; when
it is taken off ; and its contents are poured out into the
cups while the surface is yet creamy. The Egyptians
are excessively fond of pure and strong coffee, thus pre-
pared; and very seldom add sugar to it (thoughsome
do so when they are unwell), and never, milk or cream;
but a little cardamom-seed’ is often added to it. It is a
common custom, also, to fumigate the cup with the
smoke of miastic; and the wealthysometimes impreg-
nate the coffee with the delicious fragrance of amber-
gris1'. The most general mode of doing this is, to put

about a. carat-weight of ambergris in a coffee-pot, and
melt it over a fire ; then make thecotfee in anotherpot,
in the manner before described, and, when it has settled
a little, pour it into the pot which contains the amber-
gris. Some persons make use of the ambergris,for the‘
same purpose, in a different way; stickinga piece of it,
of the weight of about two carats, in the bottom of the
cup, and then pouring in the coffee: a piece of the
weight above-mentioned will serve for two or three
weeks. This mode is often adopted by persons who
like always to have the cotfee which they themselves
drink flavoured with this perfume, and do not give all
theirvisiters the same luxury. The coffee-pot is some-
times brought in a vessel of silver or brass (called
’a'z’clcee),containing burning charcoal. This vessel is
suspended by three chains. In presenting the coffee,

use of both hands, placingthe left beneathand the right

In cold weather, a brasier, or chafing~dish (called
mun’clmd),of tinned copper, full of burning charcoal, is
placedon the floor; and sometimesperfumeis burnt in
it. The Egyptians take great delight in perfumes “'3
and often fumigate their apartments. The substance
most commonlyused for this purpose is frankincenseof
an inferior quality,called bakhoo’r el-burr. Benzoinf
and aloes-wood1 are also used for the same purpose.
If he can convenientlyafford to keep a horse, mule,
or ass, or to hire an ass, the Egyptian is seldom seen
walkingfar beyondthe threshold of his own house; but
very few‘ of the people of Cairo, or of the other towns,
venture to expose themselves to the suspicion of pos-
sessing superfluous wealth,and, consequently,to greater
exactionsof the government than theywould otherwise
suffer, by keeping horses §. The modern saddle of the
horse is generally padded. and covered with cloth or
velvet, embroidered,or otherwise ornamented ; and the
head-stall and breast-leather are adorned with silk
tassels, and coins, or other ornaments, of silver.
Wealthymerchants, and the great ’ool'ama,usually ride
mules. The saddle of the mule is, generally, nearly
the same as that of the ass; of which a sketch is in-
serted: when the rider is one of the ’ool'ama, it is
covered with a segga/deh (or prayer-carpet): so, also,

the former differs considerably; as will be shown here-
after. Asses are most generallyused for riding through
the narrow and crowded streets of Cairo 3 and there are
many for hire: theirusual pace is an easy amble. The
ass is furnished with a stuffed saddle; the forepart of
which is covered with red leather, and the seat, most
commonly,with a kind of soft woollenlace,similarto our
coach-lace, of red, yellow, and other colours. The
stirrup-leathers are, in every case, very short. The
horseman is preceded by a servant, or by two servants,
to clear the way; and, for the same purpose, a servant
generally runs beside or behind the ass, or sometimes
before; calling out to the passengers to move out of the
way to the right or left, or to take care of their backs,
faces, sides, feet or heelsf. The rider, however, must

be vigilant,and not trust merely to his servant, or he
may be thrown down by the wide load of a camel;
which accident,indeed, is sometimes unavoidable in the
more narrow and crowded streets. His pipe is generally
carried by the servant; and filled and lighted if he dis-
mount at a house or shop.
If he have no regular business to employ him, the
Egyptian spends the greater part of the day in riding‘,
paying visits, or makingpurchases ; or in smokingand
sipping coffee and chatting with a friend at home; or
he passes an hour or more in the morning enjoyingthe
luxuries of a public bath. At noon, he has again to say
prayers, if he fulfil the duties imposed on him by his
religion: but, as I have remarkedon a former occasion,
there are comparativelyfew persons among the Egyp-
tians who do not sometimes neglect these duties; and
there are many who scarcely ever pray. Directly after
mid-day, he dines; then takes a pipe and a cup of
coffee, and, in hot weather, usually indulges himself
with a nap. Often he retires to recline in the hharee’m§

where a wife or female slave watches over his repose, or
rubs the soles of his feet with her hands. On such
occasions, and at other times when he wishes to enjoy
privacy,every person who comes to pay him a visit is
told, by the servant, that he is in the hharee'm; and no
friend expects him to be called thence,unless on very
urgent busines. From thetimeof theaftemoon-prayers,
until sunset (the next time of prayer),he generallyexi-
joys, again, his pipe and a cup of coffee in the society of
some one or more of his friends at home or abroad.
Shortly after sunset. he sups.
I mut now describe the meals of dinner (el-_qhud’a)
and supper (el-'ash’a),and the manner and etiquette of
eating. The same remarkswill apply to both these re-
pasts; excepting that supper is always the principal
meal. It is thegeneralcustom to cook in the afternoon;
and what remains of the supper is eaten thenext dayfor
dinner, when there are no guests in the house. The
master of a family generallydines and sups with his
wife or wives and children; but there are many men,
particularlyin the higher classes, who are too proud to
do this, or too much engaged in society to be able to do
so, unless on some few occasions; and there are men
even in the lowest class who scarcely ever eat withtheir
wives or children. When a person is paying a visit to
a friend,and the hour of dinner or supper arrives, it is
incumbenton the master of the house to order the meal
to be brought; and the same is generallyconsidered
necessary if the visiter be a stranger.
Every person, before he sits down to the table, or
ratherto the tray, washes his hands‘, and sometimes
his mouth also, with soap and water; or, at least, has

floor: but if the party be numerous, the tray is placed
in the middle of the room, and theysit round it with
one knee on theground, and theother(theright) raised ;
and, in this manner, as many as twelve persons may sit
round a tray three feet wide. Each person bares his
right arm to the elbow, or tucks up the hanging end of
his sleeve. Before he beginsto eat, he says “
B1.'-sm¢'-
‘
l'lah” (In the name of God)‘. This is generallysaid
in a low, but audiblevoice; and by the master of the
house first. It is considered both as a grace and as an
invitation to any person to partake of the meal; and
when any one is addressed with “Bi-smi-l'lah," or
“
Tafud’dal”
(which latter signifies,in this case, “Do
me the favour to partake of the repast”),hemust reply,

if he do not accept the invitation, “Henee’-an” (or
“May it benefit"),or use some similar expression:
else it will be feared that an evil eye has been cast upon
the food; and they say that, “in the food that is
coveted" (or upon which an envious eye has fallen),
“there is no blessing." But the manner in which the
Egyptian often presses a stranger to eat withhim shows
that feelings of hospitality most forcibly dictate the
“ Bi-smi-l’lah." The master of thehouse first beginsto

ample. Neither knives nor forksareused: the thumb
and two fingers of theright hand serve instead of those
’
instruments; but the spoons are used for soup or rice
or other thingsthatcannot be easilyeaten without; and
both hands may be used in particular cases, as will be
presently explained. When there are several dishes
upon the tray, each person takes of any thathe likes,
or of every one in succession: when only one dish is
placedupon the tray at a time, each takes from it a few
mouthfuls,and it is quicklyremoved, to give place to
another‘. To pick out a delicate morsel, and hand it
to a friend,is esteemed polite. The manner of eating
withthe fingers,as practisedin Egypt and otherEastern
countries, is more delicate than may be imagined by
Europeans who have not witnessed it, nor heard it cor-
rectly described. Each person breaks off a small piece
of bread, dips it in the dish, and then conveys it to his
mouth, together with a small portion of the meat or
other contents of the dish 1-. The piece of bread is
generallydoubled together,so as to enclose the morsel
of meat, &c.; and only the thumband first and second
fingers are commonly used. When a person takes a
piece of meat too large for a single mouthful,he usually
placesit upon his bread.
The food is dressed in such a manner thatit may be
easilyeaten in the mode above-described. It generally
consists, for the most part, of 3/uhh'nee,or stewed meat,
withchopped onions, or with a quantity of ba/miyehsI,

of lettuce-leaf or cabbage-leaf,with a mixture of rice
and minced meat (delicatelyseasoned with salt, pepper,

cucumber,which are all mahh’shee, or stuffed, withthe
same composition as the leaves above-mentioned; and
keba'b, or small morsels of mutton or lamb, roasted on
skewers. Many dishes consist wholly,or for the most
part, of vegetables; such as cabbage, purslain, spinach,
beans, lupins, chick-peas,gourd cut into small pieces,
colocasia, lentils,&c. Fish, dressed with oil, is also a
common dish. Most of the meats are cooked with
clarified butter; on account of the deficiency of fat;
and are made very rich : the butter, in _the hot season,
is perfectlyliquid. When a fowl is placedwhole on the
tray, bothhandsare generallyrequired to separate .the
joints ; or two persons, eachusing theright hand alone,
perform this operation together: but some will do it
very cleverlywithout assistance, and witha single band.
Many of the Arabs will not allow the left hand to
touch food in any case-r, excepting when the rightis
maimed. A boned fowl, stuffed with raisins, pistachio-.
nuts, crumbled bread, and parsley,is not an uncommon

dish; and‘ even a whole lamb, stuffed with pistachio-
nuts, &c., is sometimes served up; but the meat is.
easily separated with one hand. Sweets are often
mixed with stewed meat, &c.; as, for instance, ’anua’b
(orjujubes) and sugar with yukh’nee. Various kinds
of sweets are also served up, and often in no particular
order with respect to other meats. A favourite sweet
dish is koona’feh,which is made of wheat-flour, and re-
sembles vermicelli,but is finer; it is boiled,and sweet-
ened with sugar or honey. A dish of water-melon
(buttee’l¢h),ifin season, generallyforms part of themeaL
This is cut up about a quarter of an hour before, and
left to cool in the external air, or in a current ofair, by
the evaporation of thejuice on the surfaces of the slices;
but it is always watched during this time, lest a serpent
should come to it, and poison it by its breathor bite;
for this reptileis said to be extremelyfond of the water-
melon, and to smell it at a great distance. Water-
melons are very abundant in Egypt, and mostly very-
delicious and wholesome. A dish of boiled rice (called
rooz'z moofel’fel,the pz'la'vof the Turks),mixed witha
little butter, and seasoned with salt and pepper, is gene-
rally thatfrom which the last morsels are taken; but, in,
the houses of the wealthy,this is often followed by a
bowl of khoosha’ "‘, a sweet drink, commonlyconsisting
of water withraisins boiled in it, and then sugar: when
cool, a little rose-water is dropped into M‘. The water-_
melon frequently supplies the placeof thist.

The Egyptians eat very moderately; thoughquickly.
Each person. as soon as he has finished, says “El-
hham’doo Ii-l'Ia’h” (Praise be to God)‘, and gets up,
without waiting till the others have done-1-: he then
washes his hands and mouth with soap and water; the
basin and ewer beingheld by a servant, as before.
The onlybeverageat meals is water of the Nile, or,
sometimes,at the tables of the rich, sherbet, which will
presentlybe described. The water of the Nile is re-
markablygood; but thatof all the wells in Cairo and
in other parts of Egypt is slightly brackish. In general,
water is drunk either from an earthen bottle or from a
brass cupi. The water-bottles are of two kinds; one
called do’ruclz, and the other ckool’leh: the former has
a narrow, and the latter a wide, mouth. Theyare made
of a greyish. porous earth,which cools the water deli-
ciously,by evaporation; and they are, therefore, gene-
rallyplaced in a current of air. The interior is often
blackenedwiththe smoke of some resinous wood, and
then perfumed with the smoke of ckuf’a.l§ wood and
mastic; the latter used last. A small earthen vessel
(called mib’ltha1’aIz) is employed in performing these
operations, to contain the burning charcoal, which is
melons. From this enumeration it appears that there are not
many good fruits in this country.

tied round the neck of the do’ruck, at the distance of
about an inch from the mouth, to prevent the smoke-
black from extendingtoo far upon the exterior of the

water"‘ into the bottles. This gives a very agreeable
flavour to their contents. The bottles have stoppers
of silver, brass, tin, wood, or palm-leaves; and are
generally placed in a tray of tinned copper, which
receives the water that exudes from them. In cold
weather, china bottles are used in many houses in-
stead of those above-described, which then render the
water too cold. The two most common forms of drink-

Though we read, in some of the delightful “ Talesof
aThousand and One Nights,” of removing “the tabla
of viands”1 and bringing “thetable of wine"§,thispro-
hibited beverageis not often introduced in general so-
ciety, either during or after the meal, or at other times,
by the Moos’limsof Egypt in the present day. Many
of- them,however, habitually indulge in drinkingwine
with select parties of their acquaintance. The servants
of a man who is addicted to this habit know such of his
friends as may be admitted, if theyhappen to call When
he is engaged in this unlawful pleasure; and to all
others theysay that he is not at home, or thathe is in
the hharee’m. Drinkingwine is indulged in by such
persons before and after supper, and during thatmeal ;
but it is most approved before supper; as they say that
it quickens the appetite. The “ table of wine” is
usuallythus prepared, according to a penitent Moos’lim_
wine-bibber,who is one of my friends (I cannot speak‘
on this subject from my own experience; for, as I never

more bottles besides: several small glasses are placed
with these ; and glass saucers of dried and fresh fruits,
and, perhaps, pickles: lastly,two candles, and, often, a
bunch of flowersstuck in a candlestick,are put upon the
tray.
The Egyptians have various kinds of sherbets, or
sweet drinks. The most common kind * is merely
sugar and water; but very sweet: lemonade? is another:
a third kind, the most esteemed}, is prepared from a
hard conserve of violets, made by pounding violet-
flowers, and then boiling them with sugar: thisviolet-
sherbet is of a green colour: a. fourth kind § is prepared
from mulberries: a fifth||, from sorrel. There is also a
kind of sherbet sold in thestreets 1[, which is made with
raisins, as its name implies; another kind, which is a.
strong infusion of licorice-root. and called by the name
of thatroot*"‘; and a thirdkind, which is prepared from
the fruit of thelocust-tree, and called, in like manner, by
the name of the fruit1-1'. Thesherbet is served in covered
glass cups containing about half a pint measure, or
rather more; some of which (the more common kind)
are ornamented withgiltflowers,&c. The sherbet-cups
are placed on a round tray, and covered with a round
piece of embroideredsilk,or clothof gold. On the right
arm of the person who presents the sherbet is hung a
large oblong napkin witha wide embroidered border of

The interval between supper and the ’e.sh'E, or time
of the night-prayers, is generallypassed in smokinga
pipe, and sipping a cup of coffee. The enjoymentof
the pipe may be interrupted by prayer, but is continued
afterwards; and sometimes draughts or chess, or some
other game, or at least conversation, contributes to
make the time glide away more agreeably. The mem-
bers of an Egyptian familyin easy circumstances may
pass their time very pleasantly; but they do so in a
quiet way. The men often pay evening visits to their
friends at, or after, supper-time. They commonly use,
on these and similar occasions, a folding lantern
(fa’noo’.v),composed of waxed cloth strained over rings
of wire, and a top and bottom of tinned copper. This
kind of lantern is here represented, together with the
common lamp (ckandedl), and its usual receptacle of
wood, which serves to protect the flame from the wind.
The lamp is a small vessel of glass, having a little tube
in the bottom, in which is stuck a wick formed of cotton
twisted round a piece of straw. Some water is poured in
first,and thentheoil. A lamp of this kindis often hung

over the entrance of a house. By night, theinteriors of
the houses present a more dull appearance than in the
day: thelight of one or two candles (placedon the floor
or on a stool, and sometimes surrounded by a large
glass shade, or enclosed in a glasslantern, on accountof
the windows being merely of lattice-work)is generally
thoughtsufficient for a. large and lofty saloon. Few of
the Egyptians sit up later,in summer, than three or four
o’clock,which is three or four hours after sunset; for
their reckoning of time is from sunset at every season
of theyear: in winter theyoften sit up five or six hours.
Thus the day is usually spent by men of moderate
wealth who have no regular business to attend to, or
none that requires their own active superintendence.
But it is the habit of the tradesman to repair,soon after
breakfast,to his shop or warehouse, and to remain there
until near sunset ". He has leisure‘to smoke as much
' A delcription of the shops, and a further account of the
tradesmen ofCairo, willbe given in anotherchapter, on Industry.
DOMESTIC LIFE. 189
as he likes; and his customers often smoke with him.
To some of these he offers his own pipe (unless they
have theirs with them),and a cup of coffee, which is
obtained from the nearest coffee-shop. A great portion
of the day he sometimes passes in agreeable chat with
customers, or with the tradesmen of thenext or opposite
shops. He generallysays his prayers without moving
from his shop. Shortlyafter the noon-prayers,or some-
times earlier or later, he eats a light meal, such as a.
plate of keba’b and a cake ofbread (which a boy or maid
dailybrings from his house, or procures in the market),
or some bread and cheese or pickles, &c., which are
carried about the streets for sale; and if a customer be
present, he is always invited, and often pressed, to par-
take of this meal. A large earthen bottle of water is‘
kept in the shop, and replenished, whenever necessary,
by a passing sack’cka,or water-carrier. In the even-
ing, the tradesmenreturns to his house, eats his supper,
and, soon after, retires to bed.
It is the general custom in Egypt for the husband
and wife to sleep in the same bed, excepting among the
wealthyclasses, who mostly prefer separate beds. The
bed is usually thus_prepared in the houses of persons of
moderate wealth: a mattress*, stuffed with cotton,
about six feet long,and three or four feet in width, is
placedupon a low framefz apillow is placed for the
head, and a sheet spread over this and the mattress:
theonlycoveringin summer is generallya thinblanket1 ;
and in winter, a thick quilt§, stuffed with cotton. If
there be no frame,the mattress is placedupon the floor;
or two mattresses are laid one upon the other,with the
sheet, pillow,&c. ;-and often, a cushion of the deewa'n

is placed on each side. Amusquito-curtain‘ is sus-
pended over the bed by means of four strings, which
are attached to nails in the wall. The dress is seldom
changed on going to bed; and in winter, many people
sleep with all their ordinary clothes on, excepting the
g'ib’beh,or clothcoat; but in summer, theysleep almost,
or entirely,unclad. In winter, the bed is prepared in a
small closet (called khuz’neh) : in summer, in a large
room. All the bed-clothes are rolled up, in the day-
time, and placed on one side, or in the closet above-
mentioned. During the hottest weather, many people
sleep upon the house-top, or in a fes’hhah, which is an
uncovered apartment; but ophthalmia and other _dis-
eases often result from their thus exposing themselves to
the external air at night. The most common kind of
frame for the bed is made of palm—sticks; but this
harbours bugs, which are very abundant in Egypt in the
summer, as fleas are in the winter. These and other
plagues to which the people of Egypt are exposed by
night and day, have been before mentioned1-. With
regard to the most disgusting of them,the lice, it may
here be added, that theyare not always to be avoided
even by the most scrupulous cleanliness: but a person
who changes his linen after two or three days’ wear is
very seldom annoyed by these vermin ; and when he is,
theyare easilyremoved, not attachingthemselves to the
skin: theyare generallyfound in the linen. A house
may be kept almost clear of fleas by frequent washing
and sweeping; and the flies may be kept out by placing
nets at the doors and windows: but it is impossible to

purify an Egyptian house from bugs, if it contain much
wood-work,which is generallythe case.
The male servants’ lead a. very easy life, with the
xception of the sa’i._c, or groom, who, whenever his
master takes a ride, runs before or beside him ; and this
he will do in the hottest weather for hours together,
without appearing fatigued. Almost every wealthyper-
son in Cairo has a bow’wa’b, or door-keeper, always at
the door of his house, and several other male servants.
Most of these are natives of Egypt; but many Nubians
are also employed as servants in Cairo and other Egyp-
tian towns. The latter are mostly bow'wa’bs, and are
generally esteemed more honest than the Egyptian
servants; but I_am inclined to think,from the opinion
of several of my friends, and from my own experience,
thattheyhave acquired this reputation only by superior
cunning. The wages of the male servants are very
small,usually from one to two dollars (or from four to
eight shillings)per month: but theyreceive many pre-
sents. On the ’eed (or festival) after Rum’ada'n, the
master generallygives, to each of his servants, part or
the whole of a new suit of clothes,consisting of an ’er’ee
(a blue shirt, which is their outer dress), a turboo'ah,
and a turban. Other articles of dress which theyre-
quire during the year (excepting,sometimes, shoes) the
servants are obliged to provide for themselves. Besides
what their master gives them, theyalso receive small
presents of moneyfrom his visiters, and from the trades-
people with whom he deals; particularlywhenever he
has ‘made any considerable purchase. They sleep in
the clothes which theywear during the day, each upon
a small mat; and in winter theycover themselves with

familiarin their manners to their master, even laughing
and jokingwith him: in others, they are very submis-
sive; paying him the utmost honour, and bearingcor-
poral chastisementfrom hishandwithchild-likepatience.
The male black slave 1- is treated with more consider-
ation thanthe free servant ; and leads a life well suited
to his lazy disposition. If discontented with his situa-
tion, he can legally oompel his master to sell him.
Many of the slaves in Egypt wear the Turkishmilitary
dress. They are generallythe greatest fanatics in the
East; and more accustomed than any other class to
insult the Christians and every people who are not of
the faithwhich they have themselves adopted without
knowing more of its doctrines than Arab childrenwho
have been but a week at school.
An acquaintance with the modern inhabitants of
Egypt leads us often to compare their domestic habits
with those of Europeans in the middle ages; and, per-
haps, in this comparison, the points of resemblance
which we observe, with regard to the men, are more
striking than the contrasts; but the reverse will be
found to be the case when we consider the state of the
females.

to Egypt,having occasion to remove from a house which
I had occupied for some monthsina great thoroughfare-
street in Cairo, I engaged another house, in a neigh-
bouring qnarter: the leasewas written, and some money
paid in advance; but a. day or two afier, the agent of
the owner came to inform me that the inhabitantsof
the quarter, who were mostly ahereéfa (or descendants
of the Prophet),objected to my living among them,
becauseI was not married. He added, however, that
theywould gladlyadmit me if’I would even purchase a
female slave,which would exempt me from the appro-
briurn castupon me bythe want;of awife. I replied,
that,beingmerelyasojournerinEgypt,

either to take a wife or female slave, whom I must soon
abandon: the money that I had paid was, therefore,
refnrned to me. In another quarter, I was less unfor-
tunate; such heavy objections on account of my being
unmarried were not raised: I was only required to
promise thatno persons wearing hats should come into
the quarter to visit me; yet, after I had established my-
self in my new residence, the sheylrh (or chief) of the
quarter often endeavoured to persuade me to marry.
All my arguments against doing so he deemed of no
weight. “ You tell me,” said he, “that in a year or
two you mean to leave this country: now, there is a
young widow, who, I am told, is handsome,livingwithin
a few doors of you, who will be glad to become your
wife, even with the express understandingthatyou shall
divorce her when you quit thisplace; though,of course,
you may do so before, if she should not please you."
This young damsel had several times contrived to let
me catch a glimpse of a pretty face, as I passed the
house in which she and her parents lived. What answer
could I return ? I replied, thatI had actually,by acci-
dent, seen her face, and that she was the last woman I
should wish to marry,under such circumstances; for I
was sure that I could never make up my mind to part
with her. But I found it ratherdiflicult to silence my
oflicious friend.—It has been mentioned before, in the
Introduction, that an unmarried man, or one who has
not a female slave,’ is usually obliged to dwell in ‘a
weka’leh, unless he have some near relation with whom
to reside; but that Franks are now exempted from this
restriction. '
The Egyptian females arrive at puberty much earlier
than the 'natives of colder climates. Many marry at
MARRIAGE. 195
theage of twelve or thirteen years; and some remark-
ably precocious girls are married at the age of ten 'l‘_:
but such occurrences are not common. Few remain
unmarried afler sixteen years of age. An Egyptian
girl at the age of thirteen, or even earlier, may be a
mother. The women of Egypt are generallyvery pro-
lific; but females of other countries residing here are
often childless; and the children of foreigners, born in
Egypt, seldom live to a mature age, even when the
mother is a native. It was on this account that the
emancipated Memlodks (or military slaves) usually
adopted Memloo'ks.
It is very common among the Arabs of Egypt and of
othercountries, but less so in Cairo than in other parts
of Egypt, for a man to marry his first cousin. In this
«case, the husband and wife continue to call each other
“
cousin ;” becausethe tie of blood is indissoluble; but
that of matrimony, very precarious. A union of this
kind is generallylasting,on account of thistie of blood;
and because mutual intercourse may have formed an
attachmentbetween the parties in tender age; though,
if theybe of the higher ,
or middle classes, the young
man is seldom allowed to see the face of his female
cousin, or even to meet and converse with her, after she
_has arrived at or near the age of puberty,until she has
becomehis wife.
Marriages in Cairo are generally conducted, in the
case of a virgin, in the following manner; but in that
of a widow, or a divorced woman, with little ceremony.
Most commonly,the mother,or some other near female
relation, of the youth or man who is desirous of obtain-
ing a wife describes to him the personal and other

qualifications of the ytmng women with whom she is
acquainted,and directs his choice‘: or he employs a
Izha’t’beh,or khdtibeh; a woman whose regular busi-
ness is to assist men in such cases. Sometimes two or
more women of this profession are employed. A
kha’t’beh gives her report confidentially,describing one
girl as being like a gazelle, pretty and elegant and
young; and another, as not pretty, but rich, and so
forth. If the man have a motherand other near female
relations, two or three of these usually go with a
kha’t’behto pay visitsto several hharee’ms, to whichshe
has access in her professional character of a match-
maker; 101' she is employed as much by the women as
by the men. She sometimes also exercises the trade of
a della’leh (or broker) for the sale of ornaments, cloth-
ing,&c.,whichprocures her admission into almost every
hharee’m. The women who accompanyher in search
of a wife for their relation are introduced to the different
hharee’ms merely as ordinary visiters; and as such, if
disappointed, they soon take their leave, though the
object of their visit is of course understood by the other
party: but if they find among the females of a family
(and theyare sure to see all who are marriageable) 8
girl or young woman having the necessary personal
qualifications,theystate the motive of their visit, and
ask, if the proposed match be not at once disapproved
of, what property, ornaments, &c., the object of their
wishes may possess. If the fatherof the intended bride
be dead, she may perhaps possess one or more houses,

shops, &.c.; and in almost every case, a marriageabls
girl of themiddle or higher rankshas a set of ornaments
of gold and jewels. The women-visiters, having asked
these and other questions, bring their report to the ex-
pectant youthor man. If satisfied with their report, he
gives a present to the kha't’beh,and sends her again to
the familyof his intended wife, to make known to them
his wishes. She generallygives an exaggerated descrip-
tion of his personal attractions, wealth, &c. For in-
stance, she will say, of a very ordinary young man, of
scarcely any property, and of whose disposition she
knows nothing,“
My daughter, the youth who wishes
to marry you is young, graceful,elegant, beardless,has
plenty of money,dresses handsomely,is fond of delica-
cies, but cannot enjoy his luxuries alone; he wants you
as his companion; he will give you everything that
money can procure; he is a stayer—at—home, and will
spend his whole time with you, caressing and fondling
you.”
The parents may betroth their daughter to whom
theyplease, and marry her to him withouther consent,
if she be not arrived at the age of puberty; but after
she has attained that age, she may choose a husband
for herself, and appoint any man to arrange and effect
her marriage. In the former case, however,the khat'beh
and the relations of a girl sought in marriageusually
endeavour to obtain her consent to the proposed union.
Very often, a father objects to giving a daughter in
marriageto a man who is not of the same profession or
trade as himself; and to marrying a younger daughter
before an elder*. The bridegroom can scarcely ever
obtain even a surreptitious glance at the features of his

bride, until he finds her in his absolute possession, un-
less she belongto the lower classes of society; in which
case, it is easy enough for him to see her face.
When a female is about to marry, she should have a
wekee’l (or deputy) to settle the compact, and conclude
the contract, for her, with her proposed husband. If
she be under the age of puberty,thisis absolutelyneces-
sary; and in this case, her father,if living,or (if he be
dead) her paternal grandfather,or a guardian appointed
by will,or bythe Cka’dee,performs the ofliceof wekee’l:
but if she be of age, she appoints her own wekee’l, or
may even make the contract herself; though this is
seldom done.
After a youthor man has made choice of a female to
demand in marriage,on the report of his female rela-
tions, or that of the kha’t’beh,and, by proxy, made the
preliminary arrangementsbefore described withher and
her relations in the hharee’m, he repairs with two or
three of his friends to her wekee’l. Having obtained
thewel<ee'l’sconsent to the union, if the intended bride
be under age, he asks what is the amount of the re-
quired mahr (or dowry).
The giving of a dowry is indispensable, as I have
mentioned in a former chapter. It is generallycalcu-
lated in riya'lc,of ninety fud'dahs (now equivalent to
five pence and two fifths)each. The riya’lis an ima-
ginary money; not a coin. The usual amount of the
dowry, if the parties be in possession of a moderately
-
good income, is about a thousandriya’ls(or twenty-two
pounds ten shillings); or, sometimes, not more than
half that sum. The wealthy calculate the dowry in
purses, of five hundred piasters (or, now, five pounds
sterling) each; and fix its amount at ten purses, or
MARRIAGE. 199
more. It must be borne in mind that we are consider-
ing the case of a‘ virgin-bride; the dowry of a. widow or
a divorced woman is much less. In settling thea.mount
of the dowry, as in other pecuniary transactions, a little
haggling frequently takes place: if a thousand riya’ls
be demanded through the wekee’l, the party of the in-
tended bridegroom will probably make an offer of six
hundred: the former party then graduallylowering the
demand, and the other increasing the offer, they at
lengthagree to fix it at eight hundred. It is generally
stipulated that two thirds of the dowry shall be paid
immediatelybefore the marriage-contractis made; and
the remaining third held in reserve, to be paid to the
wife in case of divorcing her againsther own consent,
or in case of the husband's death.
Thisaflhirbeingsettled, and confirmedby all persons
present reciting the opening chapter of the Ckoor-a’n
(theFa’t'hhah), an early day (perhaps the day next
following) is appointed for paying the money, and per-
forming the ceremony of the marriage-contract,which-
is properly called ’aclcd en-nikdhh‘. The making this
contract is commonlycalled Icetb el-Icita’b (or the writing‘
of the writ); but it is very seldom the case that any-
document is written to confirm the marriage, unless the
bridegroomis about to travel to anotherplace, and fears
thathe may have occasion to prove his marriage where
witnesses of the contract cannot be procured. Some-
times the marriage-contract is concluded immediately
after the arrangement respecting the dowry,but more
generally a day or two after. On the day appointed

bride’s welree’l; and two or more friends of the latter
are usually present. It is necessary that therebetwo
witnemes (and those must be Moos’lims) to the mar-
riage-enntnct, unless in a situation where wimesses
cannot be procured. All persons present recite the
Fa’t’hhah; and the bridegroom then pays the money.
After this, the marriage-contract is performed. It is
very simple. The bridegroom and the bride’s wekee’l
sit upon the ground, face to face,with one knee upon
the ground. and grasp each other's right hand, raising
the thumbs,and pressing them against each other. A
fick’ee* is generally employed to instruct them what
they are to say. Having placed a handkerchief over
theirjoined hands, he usuallyprefaces the words of the
contract witha khoofbeh, consisting of a few words of
exhortation and prayer,withquotations from the Ckoor-
a’n and Traditions,on the excellency and advantages of
marriage. He then desires the bride's wekee’l to say
“
I betroth [or marrils to thee, my daughter [or the
female who has appointed me her wekee’l], such a.one
[naming the bride], the virgin 1' [or the adult virgin],
for a dowry of such an amount.” (The words “ for a
dowry,” &c., are sometimes omitted.) The bride’s
wekee’l having said this,the bridegroom,prompted in
the same manner by the fick’ee, says “I acceptfrom

her under my care, and bind myself to afford her my
protection; and ye who are present bearwitnessof this.”
The weliedl addresses thebridegroom in thesome man-
ner a second and a third time; andeachtinmtheletter
replies as before. They than generally add, “ And
blessingbe on the Apostles, and praise be to God, the
Lord of all creatures, amen :” after which, all present

times (but seldom unless he be a person of the lower
orders) kisses the hands of his friends and othersthere
present; and they then remain to dinner. Each of
them receives an embroidered handkerchief,providedby
the family of thebride; excepting the fick’ee, who re-
ceives a similar handkerchief,with a small gold coin
tied up in it, from the bridegroom. Before thepersons
assembled on this occssion disperse, theysettle when

eight or ten days after the conclusion of the contract.

by the bridegroom, and generally a much larger sum
(the additional money,which is often more than the
dowry itself, being supplied by the bride’s family),is
expended in purchasing the articles of furniture, dress,
and ornaments, for the bride. These articles, which are
called gaha’z, are the property of the bride; and if she
‘I be divorced, she takes themawaywithher. She cannot,
therefore, with truth be said to be purchased "’. The
furniture is sent, commonly borne by a train of camels,
to the bridegroom’s house. Often, among the'articles
of the gaha’z, is a chair for the turban or head-dress
(Icoo'/see el-’ema’meh),alluded to in a former page. It
is of a large size, but slight make; the bottom and back
generally of cane-work; sometimes with a canopy. It
is never used to sit upon. The turban, when placed
upon it, is covered with a napkin of thick silk stuff,
usually ornamented with gold thread. There are some-
times sent two of these chairs ; one for the husband,and
the otherfor the wife.
The bridegroom should receive his bride on the eve
of Friday, or that of Monday1-; but the former is

relation of the bride, receives the dowry, and gives nothing in
return but thegirl, and sometimes a little corn, &c. The bride-

are the days on which the ceremonies immediatelypreviousto the
marriage-night are performed: he should have said Sunday and
Thursday. He has also fallen into some other errors in the
accountwhich he has given of the marriageceremonies qfthe
Egyptians, in the illustrationsof his “ ArabicProverbs" (pp. 112

for all intimate friends,to send pnsents to his house,
a day or two before the feast which they purpose or
expect to attend: they generally send sugar, coffee,
rice, wax candles, or a lamb: the former articles are
usuallyplacedupon a tray of copper or wood,and covered
with a silk or embroidered kerchief. The guests are

of a IcImt’meh or a zikr-1-.

carry the utensils and linen used in the bath,upon two
round trays, each of which is covered with an em-
broidered or a plain silk kerchief: also, a sack’cka,who
gives water to any of the passengers, if asked; and two
otherpersons, one of whom bears a ckoom’cIzoom, or
bottle, of plain or gilt silver,or ofchina,containingrose-
water, or orange-flower-water, which he occasionally
sprinkleson the passengers; andtheother,amib/khar'ah
(or perfuming-vessel) of silver, with aloes-wood, or some
other odoriferous substance burning in it: but it is
seldom thatthe procession is thus attended. In gene-
ral, the first persons among the hride’s party are several
of her married female relations and friends, walkingin
pairs; and next, a number of young virgins. The
former are dressed in the usual manner, covered with
the black silk hhah/arah: the latter have white silk
hhabfarahs,or shawls. Then follows the bride,walking
under a canopy of silk,of some gay colour, as pink,
rose-colour, or yellow; or of two colours, composing
wide stripes, often rose-colour and yellow. It is carried
by four men, by means of a pole at each comer, and is
open onlyin front; and at the top of each of the four
poles is attached an embroidered handkerchief. The
dress of the bride, during thisprocession, entirely con-
ceals her person. She is generallycovered, from head
to foot, witha red Kashmee’r shawl; or with a white or
yellow shawl, though rarely. Upon her head is placed
a small pastehoard cap, or crown. The shawl is placed
over this, and conceals from the view of the public the
richer articles of her dress, her face, and her jewels, &c.,
excepting one or two ckoo.s’sah:"‘ (and sometimesother
ornaments), generally of diamonds and emeralds, at-

tached to that part of the shawl which covers her fore-
head. She is accompaniedby two or threeofher female
relations within the canopy; and often, when in hot
weather, a woman, walking backwards before her, is
constantlyemployed in fanning her, with a large fan of
black ostrich—feathers, the lower part of the front of
which is usually ornamented with a piece of looking-
glass. Sometimes one zef’feh, with a single canopy,
serves for two brides, who walk side by side. The pro-
cession moves very slowly: it is closed by a second
party of musicians,similarto thefirst, or by two or three
drummers.
In the bridal processions of the lower orders, which
are oflen conducted in the same manner as thatabove
described, the women of the party frequently utter, at
intervals, those shrill cries of joy called zug'h’a’ree’t,
which I have before had occasion to mention ; and
females ofthe poorer classes, when merely spectators of
a zet’feh, often do the same.
The whole bathis sometimes hired for the bride and
her party exclusively. Theypass several hours, or sel~
dom less than two, occupied in washing, sporting, and
feasting; and frequently ’A'l’melu(or female singers)
are hired to amuse them in the bath: theythen return
in the same order in which theycame. The expense
of the ze-.f’feh falls on the relations of the bride; but the
feast is supplied by the bridegroom.
Having returned from the bath to the houseof her
family,the bride and her companions sup together. If
’A’l’mehshave contributed to the festivity in the bath,
they,also, return with the bride, to renew their concert.
Their songs are always on the subject of love, and of
thejoyous event which occasions their presence. Afler

the company have been thus entertained, a large quan-
tity of hhen’na having been prepared, mixed into a
paste, the bride takes a lump of it in her hand, and re-
ceives contributions (called noochoo’t) from her guests:
each of them sticks a coin (usually of gold) in the
_hhen’nawhich she holds upon her hand; and when the
lump is closely stuck with these coins, she scrapes it of
her hand upon the edge of a basin of water. Having
collected in this manner from all her guests, some more
hhen’na is applied to her hands and feet, which are
then bound withpieces of linen; and in thisstate they
remain until the next morning, when theyare found to
be sufiidentlydyed with its deep orange-red tint. Her
guests make use of the remainder of the dye for their
own hands. This night is called Leg/let el-Hhen'na,or
“ the Night of the Hhen’ns.”
It is on this night, and sometimes also during the
latter half of the preceding day, that the bridegroom
gives his chiefentertainment. Mohhabbazedn (or low
farce-players) ofien perform on this occasion before the
house, or, if it be large enough, in the court. The other
and more common performances by which the guests
are amused have been before mentioned.
On the followingday,the bride goes in procession to
the house of the bridegroom. The procession before
described is called “the zetlfeh of the bath" to dis-
tinguish it from this,which is the more important, and
which is therefore particularlycalled zef’fet el-’aroo’seh,
or “the zef’feh of the bride.” In some cases,to dimi-
nish theexpenses of the marriage-ceremonies,the bride
is conducted privately to the bath,and only honoured
witha zef’feh to the bridegroom’s house. This pro-
cession is exactlysimilarto theformer. The bride and
usnnuon. 209
her party,afler breakfasting together,generallyset out
a little aflaermidday. Theyproceed in the same order,
and at the same slow pace,as in the zef’feh of the bath;
and, ifthe house of the bridegroom be near, they follow
a circuitous route, through several principal streets, for
the sake of display. The ceremony usually occupies
three or more hours.
Sometimes,beforebridal processions of this kind,:two
swordsmen,clad in nothingbut their drawers, engage
each otherin a mock combat; or two fella’hhee’n cudgel
each-other with nebboo/ts,or long staves. In the pro-
cession of a bride of a wealthyfamily,any person who
has the art of performing some extraordinary feat to
amuse the spectators is almost sure of beinga welcome
assistant, and of receivinga handsome present'. When
theseyd ’Om'ar, the Nackee’bel-Ashra’f(or chiefof the
descendants of the Prophet),who was the main instru-
ment of advancingMohham’mad ’Al’ee to the dignity of
Ba’sha of Egypt, married a daughter, about twenty-
seven years since, there walked before the procemion a
young man who had made an incision in his abdomen,
and drawn out a large portion of his intestines, which
' One of the most common of the feats witnessed on such
an occasion is the performance of a laborious task by a water-
carrier, termed a cle:"g:'m,who,for the sake of a present, and this
empty title, carries a water-skin filled with sand and water, of
greater weight, and for a longer period, than any of his brethren
will venture to do; and this he must accomplish without ever
sitting down, except in a crouching position, to rest. In the case

he carried before him on a silver tray. After the pro-
cession, be restored them to their proper place, and re-
mained in bed many days before he recovered from the
effects ofthis foolishand disgusting act. Anotherman,
on the same occasion, ran a sword through his arm,
before the crowding spectators, and then bound, over
the wound, without withdrawing the sword, several
handkerchiefs, which were soaked with the blood.
These facts were described to me by an eyewitness. A
spectacleof a more singular and more disgusting nature
used to be not uncommon on similar occasions, but
is now very seldom witnessed“‘. Sometimes, also,
hha'wees (or conjurers and sleight-of-handperformers)

most common of all the performances here mentioned
are the mock fights. Similar exhibitions are also
sometimes witnessed on the occasion of a circumcision 1-.
The bride and her party, having arrived at the bride-'
g'room’s house, sit down to a repast. Her friends,
shortly after, take their departure; leaving, with her,
only her mother and sister, or other near female rela-
tions, and one or two other women; usually the bel-
la’neh. The ensuing night is called Leg,/let ed-DookI:.’-

does the latter at home, and, after having supped with a
party of his friends, waits till a little before the ’esh’é (or
time of the night-prayer),or until the third or fourth
hour of the night, when, according to general custom,
he should repair to some celebrated mosque, such as
thatof the Hhasaney’n, and there say his prayers. If
young, he is generally honoured with a zef’feh on this
occasion : he goes to the mosque preceded by musicians
with drums and one or more hautboys, and accom-
panied by a numberof friends,and by several men bear-
ing mesh’’als. The mesh’’al is a staff with a cylindri-
cal frame of iron at the top filled with flaming wood, or
having two, three, four, or live of these receptacles for

fire. The party usually proceeds to the mosque with a
quick pace, and without much order. A second group
of musicians, with the same instruments, or with drums
only,closes the procession. The bridegroom is generally
dressed in a ckufta’n with red stripes, and a red gibfbeh,
with a Kashmee’r shawl of the same colour for his tur-
ban; and walks between two friends similarly dressed.
The prayers are commonlyperformed merely as a mat-
ter of ceremony; and it is frequently the case that the
bridegroom does not pray at all, or prays withouthaving
previouslyperformed the woodoo’, like memloo’ks who
say their prayers only because theyfear their master*.
The procession returns from the mosque with more
order and display,and very slowly; perhaps because it
would be considered unbecomingin the bridegroom to
hasten home to take possession of his bride. It is
headed, as before, by musicians,and two or more bearers
of mesh’’als. These are generallyfollowed by two men,
bearing, by means of a pole resting horizontallyupon
their shoulders, a hanging frame, to which are attached
about sixty or more small lamps, in four circles, one
above another; the uppermost of which circles is made
to revolve; being turned round occasionallyby one of
the two bearers. These numerous lamps, and several
mesh’’als beside those before-mentioned, brilliantly
illuminethe streets throughwhich the procession passes,
and produce a remarkably picturesque effect. The
bridegroom and his friends and other attendants follow,
advancing in the form of an oblong ring, all facingthe
interior of the ring, and each bearingin his hand one or
more wax candles, and sometimes a sprig of hhen'na or

or “theprayer ofmemloo’ks.”
MARRIAGE. 213
some other flower, excepting the bridegroom and the
friend on either side of him. These three form the
latter part of the ring,which generallyconsists of twenty
or more persons. At frequent intervals, the party stops
for a few minutes; and during each of these pauses, a
boy or man, one of the persons who compose the ring,
sings a few words of an epithalamium. The sounds of
the drums, and the shrill notes of the hautboy(which
the bride hears half an hour or more. before theproces-
sion arrives at the house), cease during these songs.
The train is closed, as in the former case, by a second
group of musicians.
In the manner above described, the bridegroom’s
zef'feh is most commonly conducted; but there is
another mode, that is more respectable, called zeffih
salda’tee, which signifies “thegentlemen’szef'feh.” In
this, the bridegroom is accompanied by his friendsin
the same manner as before related, and attended and
preceded by men bearing mesh”als,but not by musi-
cians: in the place of these are about six or eight men,
who, from theirbeing employed as singers on occasions
ofthis kind, are called wila’del-Hiya’lee, or “
sons of the
nights." Thus attended, _he goes to the mosque; and
while he returns slowlythence to his house, the singers
above mentioned chant, or rather sing,moowesh’shahhs
(or lyric odes) in praise of the Prophet. Having re-
turned to the house, these some persons chant portions
of theCkoor-a’n, one after another,for the amusement
of the guests; then, altogether,recite the opening chap-
ter (the Fa’t’hhah); after which, one of them singsa
clcaseedeh (or short poem) in praise of the Prophet:
lastly,all of them again sing moowesh’shahhs. After
having thus performed, theyreceive nooclroo/t(or con-

tributions of money) from the bridegroom and his
friends.
Soon after his return from the mosque, the bride-
groom leaves his friends in a lower apartment, enjoy-
ing their pipes and coffee and sherbet. The bride’s
mother and sister, or whatever other female relations
were left with her, are above; and the bride herself, and
the bella’neh,in a separate apartment. If the bride-
groombea youth or young man, it is considered proper
thathe, as well as the bride,should exhibitsome degree
of bashfulness: one of his friends,therefore,carries him
a part of the way up to the hharee’m. On entering the
bride's apartment, he gives a present to the bella'neh,
and she retires. The bride has a shawl thrown over
her head; and the bridegroom must give her a. present
of money,which is calle “ the price of the uncovering
of the face“‘,” before he attempts to remove this,which
she does not allow him to do without some apparent re-
luctance, if not violent resistance, in order to show her
maiden modesty. On removing the covering,he says
“ In the name of God, the Compassionate,theMerciful,”
and thengreets her with thiscompliment: “ The night
be blessed,” or “—is blessed :” to which she replies,
if timidity do not choke her utterance, “God bless
thee." The bridegroom now sees the face of his bride
for the first time, and generallyfinds her nearlywhat
he has been led to expect. Often, but not always, a
curious ceremony is then performed. The bridegroom
takes off every article of the bride’s clothingexcept-
ing her shirt; seats her upon a mattress or bed, the
head of which is turned towards the direction of

MARRIAGE. 215
Mek'keh,placing her so that her back is also turned
in that direction; and draws forward, and spreads upon
the bed,the lower part of the front of her shirt: having
done this,he stands at thedistance of ratherless thana
yard beforeher,and performs theprayers of two rek”ahs;
laying his head and hands, in prostration, upon the part
of her shirt that is extended before her lap. He re-
mains with her but a. few minutes longer’: having
satisfied his curiosityrespecting her personal charms, he
calls to the women (who generally collect at the door,
where theywait in anxious suspense) to raise their cries
of joy,or zugh’a’ree’t; and the shrill sounds acquaint
the persons below and in the neighbourhood, and often,
respondedby otherwomen,spread stillfurther the news,
that he has acknowledged himself satisfied with his
bride : he soon after descends to rejoin his friends, and
remains with them an hour, or more, before he returns
to his wife. It very seldom happens that the husband,
ifdisappointed in his bride, immediately disgraces and
divorces her: in general,he retains her, in thiscase, a
week or more.
_
Having now described the most usual manner in
which the marriages of virgin-brides are conducted in
Cairo, I may add a few words on some of the ceremonies
observed in other cases of matrimony,both of virgins
and of widows or divorced women.
The daughters of the great, generallyhaving baths in
their own houses, seldom go to the public bath pre-
viously to marriage. A bride of a wealthyfamily,and
" I beg to refer the reader, if he desire further details on this
subject, to page 117 of Burckhsrdt's “Arabic Proverbs.” His
account might have been more complete ; but he seems to have

her female relations and friends. if there be not a. bath
in her house, go to the public bath,which is hired for
them exclusively,and to thebridegroom'shouse, without
music or canopy,mounted on asses: the bride herself
generallywearing‘ a Kashmee’r shawl, in themannerof
a hhab’arah. If the bridegroom or the bride’s family
have eunuchs, these ride before the bride; and some-
times a. man runs at the head of the procession,crying
“ Bless ye the Prophet‘ !” This man, on entering the
house, throwsdown, upon the threshold,some leaves of
the white bete (sulck),over which the ladies ride. The
object of this act is to propitiate fortune. The same
man then exclaims “Assistance from God, and a
speedy victory 1- ! ”
Marriages,among the Egyptians, are sometimes con-
ducted without any pomp or ceremony even in the case
of virgins,by mutual consent of the bridegroom and the
bride’s family, or the bride herself; and widows and
divorced women are never honoured with a zef'feh on
marrying again. The mere sentence “I give myselfup
to thee 1 ”
uttered by a female_to a man who proposes
to become her husband (even without the presence of
witnesses, if none can be easilyprocured) render her his
legal wife, if arrived at puberty; and marriages with
widows and divorced women, among the Moos’lims of
Egypt, and other Arabs, are sometimes concluded in
this simple manner. The dowry of such women is
generallyone quarter or third or half the amount of that
of a virgin.

MARRIAGE. 217
thoughin very humble life,the marriage-ceremoniesare
conducted in the same manner as among the middle
orders. But when the expenses of such zef’fehs as I
have described cannot by any means be paid, the bride
is paraded in a very simple manner, coveredwitha shawl
(generallyred), and surrounded by a group of her fe-
male relations and friends, dressed in their best, or in
borrowed clothes,and enlivened by no other sounds of
joy than their zugh’a’ree’t, which theyrepeat at frequent
intervals.
The general mode.of zef’feh among the inhabitants
of the villages is different from those above-described.
The bride, usually covered with a shawl, is seated on a
camel; and so conveyed to the bridegroom’s dwelling.
Sometimes four or five women or girls sit with her, on
the same camel; one on either side of her, and two or
three others behind: the seat being made very wide,
and usually covered withcarpets or other drapery. She
is followed by a. group of women singing. In the
evening of the wedding,and ofien during several pre-
vious evenings, in a village,the male and female friends
of the two parties meet at the bridegroom’shouse, and
pass several hours of thenight, in the open air, amusing
themselves with songs and a. rude kind of dance, accom-
panied by the sounds of a tambourine or some kind of
drum: both sexes sing; but only the women dance. I
have introduced here these few words on the marriage-
ceremonies of the peasantry to avoid scattering notes on
subjectsof the same nature. I now revert to the cus-
toms of the peopleof Cairo.
On the morning after the marriage, khow'als* or
"‘ A khow’al is also called gha’ish, pluralglceeyufih.
‘2l8 MODERN EGYFTIANS.
gha’zee'3/eh:(dancingmen or girls) perform in the street
before the brideg-room’s house, or in the court ‘. On
the same morning also, if the bridegroombe a young
man, the person who carried him up-stairs generally
takes him and several friends to an entertainment in the
country. where theyspend the whole day. This cere-
mony is called el—hooroo’beh,or the flight. Sometimes
the bridegroom himself makes the arrangements for it;
and pays part of the expenses. if theyexceed the amount
of the contributions of his friends; for they giv
noocIroo’t on this occa.sion. Musicians and dancing-
girls are often hired to attend the entertainment. If
the bridegroom be a person of the lower orders, he is
conducted back in procession, preceded by three or four
musicians with drums and hautboys; his friends and
other attendants carrying each a nosegay, as in the
zef'feh of the preceding night; and if their return be
after sunset, they are accompanied by men bearing
mesh”als, lamps, &c.; andthe friendsof the bridegroom
carry lightedwax candles,besides the nosegaysf. Sub-
‘ This performance is called the bride’s sub’a’IzI:ee’yeIa.
1- Among the peasants of Upper Egypt, the relations and ac-
quaintances ofthebridegroom and bride meet togetheron the day
after the marriage; and while a number of the men clap their
hands, as an accompaniment to a tambourine, or two, and any
other instruments that can be procured, the bride dances before
themfor a short time. She has a head-veil reachingto her heels,
and a printed cotton handkerchief completelycovering her face,
and wears, externally,the most remarkableof her bridal garments
(mentioned by Burckhnrdt, in the place before referred to, and,
in some parts of Egypt, hung over the door of a peasant’s house
after marriage). Otherwomen,similarlyveiled,anddressed in their
best, or borrowed, clothes,continue the dance about two hours, or
more.

sequent festivities occasioned by marriage will be de-
scribed in a later chapter.
- The husband, if he can conveniently so arrange,
generallyprefers thathis mother should reside withhim
and his wife; that she may protect his wife’s honour,
and consequently his own also. It is said that the
-mother-in—law is, for this reason, called hham’ah“.
The women of Egypt are said to be generallyprone to
criminal intrigues; and I fear that, in this respect, they
are not unjustly accused. Sometimes a husband keeps
his wife in the house of her mother,and pays the daily
expenses of both. This ought to make the mother very-
careful with regard to expenditure, and strict as to her
daughter’s conduct, lest the latter should be divorced;
but it is‘ said, that,in this case, she often acts as her
daughter’s procuress, and teaches her innumerabletricks,
by which to gain the upper hand over her husband, and
to drain his purse. The influenceof the wife’s mother
is also scarcely less feared when she only enjoys occa-
sional opportunities of seeing her daughter: hence it is
held more prudent for a man to marry a female who-
has neithermother nor any near relations of her own
sex; and some wives are even prohibitedreceiving any’
female friends but those who are relations of the hus-
band: theyare very few, however, upon whom such
severe restrictions are imposed.
For a person who has become familiar with male
Moos’lim society in Cairo, without marrying,it is not
so diflicult as might beimaginedby a stranger to obtain,
directly and indirectly, correct and ample information
respecting the condition and habits of the women.

Manly husbands of the middle classes, and some of the
higher orders, freely talk of the affairs of the hhareefm
with one who professes to agree with them in their
general moral sentiments, if theyhave not to converse
through the medium of an interpreter.
Though the women have a particular portion of the
house allotted to them,the wives, in general, are not to
be regarded as prisoners; for theyare usually at liberty
to go out and pay visits, as well as to receive female
visiters, almost as often as they please. The slaves,
indeed, beingsubservient to the wives, as well as to their
master, or, if subject to the master only,beingunder
an authorityalmost unlimited, have not that liberty.
One of the chief objects of the master in appropriating
a distinct suite of apartments to his women, is to pre-
vent their being seen by the male domestics and other
men withoutbeingcovered in the manner prescribedby
their religion. The following words of the Ckoor-a’n
show the necessity under which a Mohhammadan wo-
man is placed of concealing whatever is attractivein her
person or attire from all men,excepting certain relations
and some other persons. “
And speak unto thebeliev-
ing women, that theyrestrain their eyes, and preserve
their modesty, and discover not their ornaments, except
what [necessarily] appeareth thereof: and let them
throw their veils over their bosoms, and not show their
ornaments, unless to their husbands, or theirfathers, or
their husbands’ fathers,or their sons, or theirhusbands’
sons, or their brothers,or their brothers’ sons, or their
sisters’ sons, or their women, or those [captives] which
their right hands shall possess, or unto such men as
attend [them] and have no need [of women], or unto
children:” “
and let them not make a noise with their
THE nnAREE'u. 22!
feet, thattheir ornaments which theyhide may [thereby]
be discovered*.’’
The last passage alludes to the prac-
tice of knocking together the anklets which the Arab
women in the time of the Prophet used to wear; and
which are stillworn by many women in Egypt.
I must here transcribe two notes of an eminent
Egyptian commentator on the Ckoor-a'n, in illustration
of the above extract,and inserted in Sale’s translation.
This I do. becausetheywould convey an erroneous idea
of modern customs with regard to the admission,or
non-admission, of certain persons into the hharee’m.
The first is on the above words “or their women,”
/which it thusexplains-1-“That is, such as are of the
Mohhammadan religion: it being reckoned by some
unlawful, or, at least, indecent, for a woman who is a
true believer,to uncover herself before one who is an
infidel; because the latter will hardly refrain from de-
scribingher to the men: but others suppose all women
in general are here excepted; for, in this particular,
doctors differ.” In Egypt, and I believein every other
Mohhammadan country, it is not now considered im-
proper for any woman, whether independent, or a
servant, or a slave, a Christian, a Jewess,a Moos’lim’eh,
or a pagan, to enter a Moos’lim’s hharee’m.—The second
of the notes above alluded to is on the words “
or those
captives;” and is as follows. “
Slaves ofeither sex are
included in thisexception, and, as some think,domestic
servants who are not slaves,as thoseof a different nation.
It is related that Mohham’mad once made a present of
a man-slave to his daughter Fa’timeh; and when he
brought him to her, she had on a garmentwhich was so

222 MODERN EGYPT!ANS.
scanty, that she was obliged to leave either her head or
her feet uncovered: and that the Prophet, seeing her in
great confusion on that account, told her, she need be
under no concern, for that there was none present but
her father and her slave.” Among the Arabs of the
Desert this may still be the case; but in Egyptl have
never heard of an instance of an adult male slave being
allowed to see the hharee’m of a respectable man, whe-
ther he belonged to that hharee’m or not; and am
assured that it is never permitted. Perhaps the reason
why the man-slave of a woman is allowed this privilege
by the Ckoor-a’n is, becauseshe cannot become his law-
,ful wife as long as he continues her slave :‘ but this is a
poor reason for granting him access to the hharee’m, in
such a state of society. It is remarkable that, in the
verse of the Ckoor-a’n above quoted, uncles are not
mentioned as privileged to see their nieces unveiled:
some think that they are not admissible, and for this
reason, lest they should describe the persons of their
nieces to their sons; for it is regarded as highly impro-
per for a man to describe the features or person of a
female (as to say, that she has large eyes, a straight
nose, small mouth,&c.) to one of his own sex by whom
it is unlawful ;for her to be seen, though it is not con-
sidered indecorous to describe her in general terms, as,
for instance, to say “
she is a sweet girl, and set olf with
kohhl and hhen'na."
It may be mentioned here, as a general rule, that a
man is allowed to see unveiledonly his own wives and
female slaves, and those females whom he is prohibited,
by law,ifrommarrying,on account of theirbeing within
certain degrees of consanguinity or familyconnexion,or
having given him suck, or having been suckled hy the
‘ma HHARI-'.I::'M. 223
same nurse as himself'. The high antiquity of the
veil has been alluded to in the first chapter of this work.
It has also been mentioned. that it is considered_mnre
necessary, in Egypt, for a woman to cover the upper
and back part of her head than her face; and more
requisite for her to conceal her face than most other
parts of her person : for instance. a female who cannot
be persuaded to unveil her face in the presence of men,
will thinkit but little shame to display the whole of her
bosom, or the greater part of her leg. There are, it is
true, many women among the lower classes in this
country who constantly appear in public with unveiled
face; but they are almost constrained to do so by the
want of a boor’cko’ (or face-veil),and the difficultyof
adjustingthe tar’hhah (or head-veil),of which scarcely
any woman is destitute, so as to supply the place of the
former; particularlywhen both their hands are occupied
in holding some burden which theyare carrying upon
thehead. When a respectablewoman is, byany chance,
seen withlherhead or face uncovered, by a. man who is
not entitled to enjoy that privilege,she quickly assumes
or adjustsher tar'hhah, and often exclaims “ O my mis-
fortune 1- !” or “ O my sorrow 1!” Motives of coquetry,
V
however, frequently induce an Egyptian woman to ex-
pose her face before a man when she thinks that she
may appear to do so unintentionally,or that she may be
supposed not to see him. A man may also occasionally
enjoy opportunities of seeing the face of an Egyptian
lady when she really thinks herself unobserved ; some-
‘ See the chapter on Religion and Laws. Eunuchs are allowed
to see the face of any woman: so, also, are young boys.

times at an open lattice, and sometimes on a house-top.
Many small houses in Cairo have no apartment on
the ground-floor for the reception of male visiters,
who therefore ascend to an upper room; but as they
go up stairs, they exclaim, several times, “ de:too’r!”
(“permission!”), or “
ya.’ Sdtir I” (“ O Protec-
tor!” that is “O protecting God!”), or use some
similar ejaculation, in order to warn any woman who
may hannen to be in the way, to retire, or to veil
herself; which she does by drawing a part of her tar’-
hhah before her face, so as to leave, at most, only one
eye visible. To such an absurd pitch do the Moos’lims
carry their feeling of the sacredness of women, that
entrance into the tombs of some females is denied to
men; as, for instance, the tombs of the Prophet’swives
and other females of his family,in the burial-groundof
El-Medee’neh; into which women are freely admitted:
and a man and woman they never bury in the same
vault,unless a wall separate the bodies. Yetthere are,
among the Egyptians, a. few persons who are much less
particularin this respect: such is one of my Moos’lim
friends here, who generallyallows me to see his mother
when I call upon him. She is a widow, of about fifty
years of age; but, being very fat, and not looking so
old, she calls herself forty. She usually comes to the
-door of the apartment of the hharee’m in which I am
received (therebeing no lower apartment in the house
for male visiters), and sits thereupon the floor, but will
-never enter the room. Occasionally,and as if by acci-
dent, she shows me the whole of her face, with plenty
of kohhl round her eyes; and does not attempt to con-
ceal her diamonds, emeralds, and other ornaments; but
rather the reverse. The wife, however, I am never
THE Hnani:-zafu. no
permitted to see; though once I was allowed to talk to
her, in thepresence of her husband, round the corner of
a passage at the top of the stairs.
I believe that, in Egypt, the women are generally
under less restraint than in any othercountry of the
Turkish Empire; so that it is not uncommon to see
females of the lower orders flirting and jestingwithmen
in public, and men laying their hands upon them very
freely. Still it might be imagined, that the women of
the higher and middle classes feel themselves severely
oppressed, and are much discontented with the state of
seclusion to which theyare subjected: but this is not
commonly the case; on the contrary,an Egyptian wife
who is attached to her husband is apt to think, if he
allow her unusual liberty,thathe neglects her, and does
not suflicientlylove her; and to envy those wives who
are kept and watched with greater strictness.
It is not very common for an Egyptian to have more
than one "wife, or a concubine slave; though the law
allows him four wives (as I have before stated), and,
according to the opinion of some, as many concubine
slaves as he may choose. But, though a man restrict
himselfto a single wife, he may change as oficn as he
desires; and there are certainly not many persons in
Cairo who have not divorced one wife, if theyhave been
long married. The husband may, whenever he pleases,
say to his wife “Thou art divorced‘ :” if it be his wish,
whetherreasonableor not, she must return to her parents
or friends. This liabilityto an unmerited divorcement
is the source of more uneasiness to many wives than all
the other troubles to which theyare exposed; as they
may therebybe reduced to a state of great destitution :
* En’!ee ta’!icbuI:.
226 MODERN EGYPTIANS.
but to others,who hope to better their condition, it is,
of course, exactlythe reverse. I have mentioned; in a.
former chapter "", that a man maydivorce his wife twice,
and each time receive her again without any ceremony-;
but thathe cannot legallytake her again after a third
divorce until she has been married and divorced by
another man. The consequences of a triple divorce
conveyed in one sentence-r are the same,-unless the
man and his wife agree to infringe the law, or the for-'
mer deny his having pronounced the sentence; -in
which latter case, the woman may have much dillicnlty
to enforce his compliancewiththelaw, if she beinclined
to do so. -
In illustration of this subject, I may mention a case
in which an acquaintance of mine was concerned as‘ a
witness of the sentence of divorce. He was sitting in
a. coffee-shop with two other men, one of whom had just
been irritated by something that his'wife had said or
done. After a short conversation upon this alfair, the
angry husband sent for his wife, and, as soon as she
came, said to her “Thou art trebly divorced :’-’ then,
addressing his two companions, he added “You. my
brothers, are witnesses." Shortly after, however, he
repented of this act, and wished to take back his
divorced wife; but she refused to return to him, and
appealed to the Shar'd AWall. (or Law of God). The
case was tried at the Mahh’kem’eh. The woman, who
was the plaintiff, stated that the defendant was her
husband; that he had pronounced against her the
sentence of a triple divorce; and that he now wished
her to return to him, and live with him as his wife, con-
trary to the law,and consequentlyin a state of sin. The
‘ On theReligion and Laws. 1- Er/tee !a'Iickala bi-t-!ela’teh.
THE HHAREE'M. 227
defendant denied that he had divorced her. “
Have
you witnesses?” said_ the judge to the plaintiff. She
answered, “ I have here two witnesses.” These were
the men who were present in the coffee-shop when the
sentence of divorce was pronounced. They were desired
to give their evidence; and stated that the defendant
divorced his wife, by a triple sentence, in theirpresence.
The defendant averred that she whom he divorced in
the coffee-shop was another wife of his. The plaintiff
declared that he had no other wife; but thejudge ob-
served to her that it was impossible she could know
that; and asked the witnesses what was the name of the
woman whom the defendant divorced in theirpresence?
They answered that they were ignorant of her name.
They were then asked if theycould swear thatthe plain-
tiff was the woman who was divorced before them ?
Their reply was, that they could not swear to a woman
whom they had never seen unveiled. Under these cir-
cumstances, the judge thought it right to dismiss the
case; and the woman was obliged to return to her
husband. She might have demanded that he should
produce the woman whom he professed to have divorced
in the coffee-shop; but he would easily have found a
woman to play the part he required; as it would not
have been necessary for her to show a ma.rriage~certifi-
cute; marriagesbeingalmost always performed in Egypt
withoutany written contract, and sometimes even with-
out witnesses.
It not unfrequentlyhappens, that, when a man who
has divorced his wife the third time wishes to take her
again (she herself consenting to theirreunion, and there
beingno witnesses to the sentence of divorce), he does
so without conforming with the oifensive law before-

mentioned. It is also a common custom for a man
under similar circumstances to employ a person to marry
the divorced woman on the condition of his resigning
her, the day afier their union, to him, her former hus-
band, whose wife she again becomes,by a second con-
tract; thoughthisis plainly contrary to the spirit of the
law. A poor man (generallya very uglyperson, and
often one who is blind) is usually chosen to perform
this oflice. He is termed a Moostahhil’l,or Mohhallil.
It is ofien the case that the man thus employed is so
pleased with the beautyof the woman to whom he is
introduced on these terms, or with her riches, thathe
refuses to give her up; and the law cannot compel him
to divorce her, unless he act unjustlytowards her as her
husband; whichof course he takes good care not to do.
But a person may employ a moostahhil’lwithout run-
ning this risk. It is the custom of many wealthyTurks,
and of some of the people of Egypt, to make use of a
slave, generallya black,their own property, to ofliciate
in this character. Sometimes, a slave is purchased for
thispurpose; or if the person who requires him for such
a service be acquaintedwith a slave-dealer,he asks from
the latter a present of a slave; signifying that he will
give him back again. The uglier the slave, the better.
The Turksgenerally choose one not arrived at puberty;
which the tenets of their sect allow. As soon as the
woman has accomplished her 'ed'deh (or the period
during which she is obliged to wait before she can
marry again), the husband who divorced her, having
previouslyobtained her consent to what he is about to
do, introduces the slave to her, and asks her if she will
he married to him. She replies that she will. She is
accordinglywedded to the slave, in the presence of wit-
THE HHAREE/M. 229
nesses; and a dowry is given to her, to make the mar-
riage perfectly legal. The slave consummates the mar-
riage; and thus becomes the woman's legitimate hus-
band. Immediatelyafter, or on the followingmorning,
her former husband presents thisslave to her as her own
property, and the moment that she accepts him, her
marriage with him becomes dissolved; for it is unlaw-
fizlfor a woman to be the wife ofher own slave; though
she may emancipate a slave, and then marry him. As
soon as her marriage is dissolved by her accepting the
gift of the slave, she may give back this slave to her
husband: but it seldom happens that the latter will
allow a person who has been a moostahhil’lfor him to
remain in his house. The wife, afier this proceeding,
may,as soon as she has again accomplishedher ’ed'deh,
become ‘reunited to her former husband, after having
been separated from him, by the necessity of her ful-
fillingtwo ’ed’dehs, about half a year, or perhaps more.
The depraving effects of this facilityof divorce upon
both sexes may be easilyimagined. There are many
men in this country who, in the course of ten years,
have married as many as twenty,thirty,or more wives;
and women not far advanced in age who have been
wives to a dozen or more men successively. I have
heard of men who have been in the habitof marryinga
new wife almost every month. A person may do this
thoughpossessed of very little property: he may choose,
from among the females of the lower orders in the
streets of Cairo, a handsome young widow or divorced
woman who will consent to become his wife for a dowry
of about ten shillings; and when he divorces her, he
need not give her more than double that sum to main-
tain her during her ensuing ’ed’deh. It is but just,
230 MODERN EGYPTIANS.
however, to add, that such conduct is generallyregarded
as very disgraceful; and that few parents in the middle
or higher classes will give a daughter in marriage to a
man who has divorced many wives.
Polygamy,which is also attended with very injurious
effects upon the morals of the husband and the wives, is
more rare among the higher and middle classes than
it is among the lower orders; and it is not very com-
mon among the latter. A poor man may indulge him-
self with two or more wives, each of whom may be able,
by some art or occupation, nearly to provide her own
subsistence; but most persons of the middle and higher
orders are deterred from doing so by the consideration
of the expense and discomfort which theywould incur.
A man having a wife who has the misfortune to be
barren, and beingtoo much attached to her to divorce
her, is sometimes induced to take a second wife, merely
in the hope of obtaining offspring ; and from the same
motive, he may take a third, and afourth; but fickle
passion is the most evident and common motive both to
polygamy and repeated divorces. They are compara-
tively very few who gratify this passion by the former
practice. I believenot more than one husband among
twenty has two wives.
When there are two or more wives belongingto one
Vman,thefirst (thatis, the one first married)generallyen-
joys the highest rank ; and is called “
the great lady*.”_
Henceit often happensthat,when a man who has already
one wife wishes to marry anothergirlor woman,thefather
of the latter, or the female herself who is sought in
marriage, will not consent to the union unless the first
wife he previouslydivorced. The women, of course, do
‘ Emil!cl-kebee’reIi.
THE HnARE1«;’M. 231
not approve of a man’s marrying more than one wife.
Most men of wealth, or of moderate circumstances, and
even many men of the lower orders, if they have two or
more wives, have, for each, a separate house. The wife
has, or ‘can oblige her husband to give her, a particular
description of lodging"‘, which is either a separate
house, or a suite of apartments (consistingof a room in
which to sleep and pass theday, a kitchen, and a latrina)
thatare, or may be made, separate and shut out from
any other apartments in the same house. A fellow-wife
is called door’rah1'. The quarrels of door’rahs are
often talked of: for it may be naturally inferred, that,
when two wives share the affection and. attentions of
the same man, they are not alwayson terms of amity
with each other; and the same is generally the case
with a wife and a concubine slave living in the same
house, and under similar circumstances I. If the chief
lady be barren, and an inferior, either wife or slave,
beara child to her husband or master, it commonlyre-
sults that the latter woman becomes a favourite of the
man, and that the chief wife or mistress is “despised in
her eyes,” as Abraham’swife was in the eyes of Hagar
on the same account§. It therefore not very unfra-
quently happens that the first wife loses her rank and
privileges; anotherbecomes the chief lady, and, being
the favourite of her husband, is treated by her rival or
rivals, and by all the members and visiters of the

hharee’m,withthe same degree of outward respectwhich
the first wife previously enjoyed: but sometimes the
poisoned cup is employed to remove her. A preference
given to a second wife is often the cause of the first's
beingregistered as ndshizeh“, either on her husband's
or her own application at the Mahh’kem’eh. Yet many
instances are known of neglectedwives behavingwith
exemplary and unfeigned submission to their husband,
in such cases, andwithamiable good nature towards the
favourite1-.
Some wives have female slaves who are their own
property, generallypurchased for them,or presented to
them,before marriage. These cannot be the husband’s
eoncubineswithout their mistress’s permission, which is
sometimes granted (as it was in the case of Hagar,
Sarah's bondwoman); but very seldom. Often, the
wife will not even allow her female slave or slaves to
appear unveiledin the presence of her husband. Should
such a slave, without the permission of her mistress, be-
come the concubinepofthe husband, and hear him a
child, the child is a slave, unless, prior to its birth,the
motherbe sold, or presented, to the father.
The white female slaves are mostly in the possession
of wealthyTurks. The coucubine slaves in the houses
of Egyptians of the higher and middle classes are, gene-

rally, Abyssinians, of a deep brown or bronze com-
plexion. In theirfeatures as well as their complexions
they appear an intermediate race between the negroes
and white people: but the difference between them and
either of the above-mentioned races is considerable.
They themselves,_however,think thatthey differ so little
from the white people, thattheycannot be persuaded to
act as servants, with due obedience, to their master’s
wives; and the black (or negro) slave-girl feels exactly
in the same manner towards the Abyssinian; but is
perfectly willing to serve the white ladies. I should
here mention, that the slaves who are termed Abys-
sinians are not from the country properly called Abys-
sinia,but from the neighbouringterritories of theGallas.
Most of them are handsome. The average price of one
of these girls is from ten to fifteen pounds sterling, if
moderately handsome; but this is only about half the
sum that used to be given for one a few years ago.
They are much esteemed by the volnptuariesof Egypt;
but are of delicate constitution: many of them die, in
this country, of consumption. The price of a white
slave-girl is usually from treble to tenfold that of an
Abyssinian; and the price of a black girl, about half or
two thirds,or considerably more if well instructed in the
art of cookery. The black slaves are generally em-
ployed as menials*.
Almost all of the slaves become converts to the Mo-
hhammadan faith; but, in general, they are little in-
structed in the rites of their new religion; and still less
in its doctrines. Most of the white female slaves who

were in Egypt during my former visit to this country
were Greeks; vast numbers of that unfortunate people
having been made prisonersby theTurkishand Egyptian
army under Ibrahee’m Ba’sha; and many of them,
males and females,including even infants scarcely able
to walk, sent to Egypt to be sold. Latterly,from the
impoverishment of the higher classes in this country,
the demand for white slaves has been small. A few,
some of whom undergo a kind of preparatory education
(beinginstructed in music or other accomplishments,at
Constantinople), are brought from Chercassia and
Georgia. The white slaves,beingoften the only female
companions, and sometimes the wives, of the Turkish
grandees, and beinggenerallypreferred by them before
the free ladies of Egypt, hold a higher rank than the
latter in common opinion. They are richly dressed,
presented with valuable ornaments,indulged, frequently,
with almost every luxury that can be procured, and,
when it is not their lot to wait upon others, may, in
some cases, be happy; as lately has been proved, since
the termination of the war in Greece, by many females
of thatcountry, captives in Egyptian hharee’ms, refusing
theiroffered liberty,which all of these cannot be sup-
posed to have done from ignorance of the state of their
parents and other relations, or the fear of exposing
themselves to poverty. But, though some of them are
undoubtedlyhappy, at least for a time, their numberis
comparativelysmall: most are fated to wait upon more
favoured fellow-prisoners, or upon Turkish ladies, or to
receive the unwelcome caresses of a wealthydotard, or
of a man who has impaired his body and mind by ex-
cesses of every kind ; and,when their master or mistress
becomes tired of them,or dies, are sold again (if they
Til! HllARlI’l. 235
have not borne children),or emancipated, and married
to some person in humble life, who can alford them but
few of the comforts to which theyhave been accustomed.
The female slavesin the houses of persons of the middle
classes in Egypt are generallymore comfortablycircum-
stanced than those in the hharee’ms of the wealthy: if
concubines, they are, in most cases, without rivals to
disturb theirpeace; and if menials,theirservice is light,
and they are under less restraint. Often, indeed, if
mutual attachmentsubsist between her and her master,
the situation ofa coticubineslave is more fortunate than
that of a wife ; for the latter may be cast off by her
husbandin a momentof anger, hyan irrevocablesentence
of divorce, and reduced to a state of poverty; whereas a
man very seldom dismisses a female slave without pro-
viding for her in such a manner that, if she have not
been used to luxuries, she suffers but little, if at all, by
the change: this he generallydoes by emancipatingher,
giving her a dowry, and marrying her to some person
of honest reputation ; or by presenting her to a friend.
I have already"mentioned,that a master cannot sell a
slave who has borne him a child; and thatshe is entitled
to her freedom on his death. It often happens that
such a slave, immediatelyafter the birthof her child,is
emancipated,and becomes her master's wife: when she
has become free, she can no longer lawfully supply the
place of a wife unless he marry her. Many persons
consider it disgraceful even to sell a female slave who
has been long in their service. Most of the Abyssinian
and black slave-girls are abominablycorrupted by the
Gella/bs, or slave-traders, of Upper Egypt and Nubia,

these children,particularly the Abyminians,and boys as
well as girls, feel the treatment which theyendure from
the Gella’bs, thatmany instances occur of their drown-
ing themselvesduring the voyagedown theNile‘. The
female slaves of every class are somewhat dearer than
themales ofthe same age. Thosewho have nothad
the small-pox are usually sold for less than the others.
Three days’ trial is generallyallowed to the purchaser;
during which time, the girl remains in his, or some
fi'iend’s,hhai-ee’m; and thewomen mflre their report to
him. Snoring, grinding the teeth, or talking during
sleep, are commonly considered sufficient reasons for
returningher to the dealer.—The dresses of thefemale
slaves are similar to those of the Egyptian women.
The female servants, wlm are Egyptian girls or wo-
men, are those to whom the lowest occupations are
allotted. They generallyveil their iiiees in the presence
of their masters, with the head—veil; drawing a part of
thisbefore the face,so thatthey leave onlyone eye and
one hand at liberty to see and perform what theyhave
to do. When a male visiter is received by the master
of a house in an apartment of thehha.ree’m (thefemales
of the familyhaving been sent into anotherapartment
on the occasion),he is usually,or ofien, waited upon by
a female servant, who is always veiled.
Such are the relative conditions of the various classe
in thehharee’m. A short account of theirmual habits
and employmentsmust be added.

might judgefrom my own experience, I should say that
most of them are excellent cooks; for, when a dish has
beenreoommended to me becausemarkbrythewifeof

wives of men of the higher and middle classes make a
great study of pleasing and fascinating their husbands
by unremitued attentions, and by various arts. Their
coquetry is exhibited,even in their ordinary gait, when
they go abroad, by a peculiar twisting of the body '.
In the presence of the husband, theyare usually under
moreorlessrestraint; audheneetheyarebetler

when his visits, during the day, are not very frequent or
long: in his absence, theyoften indulge in noisy merri-
ment.
The diet of the women is similarto thatof the men,
but more frugal; and their manner of eating is the
same. Manyof them are allowed to enjoy the luxury
of smoking; for thishabit is not considered unbecom-
ing in a female,however high her rank; the odour of
thetobacco which they use beingvery delicate. Their
pipes are generallymore slender than those of the men,
and more ornamented; and the mouth-piece is some-
times partly composed of coral, in the place of amber.
They generallymake use of perfumes, such as musk,
civet, &c.; and often, also, of cosmetics,and particularly
of several preparationswhich they eat or drink withthe
view of acquiringwhat theyesteem a proper degree of
plnmpness-|*: one of these preparatmns. is extremely

'
Many of them also have a habit of chewing frank-
incense1*,and labdanumI,which impart a perfume to the
breath. The habit of frequent ablutions renders them
cleanlyin person. They spend but little time in the
operations of the toilet; and, afier having dressed them-
selves in the morning, seldom change their clothes dur-
ing the day. Their hair is generally braided in the
bath; and not undone afterwards for several days.
The care of their children is the primary occupation
of the ladies of Egypt: they are also charged withthe
superintendenceofdomesticaffairs ; but,in most families,
the husband alone attends to the household expenses.
Their leisure-hours are mostlyspent in workingwith the
needle; particularly in embroidering handkerchiefs,
head-veils, &c., upon a frame called men’ceg, with
coloured silks and gold. Many women, even in the
houses of the wealthy,replenish their private purses by
ornamenting handkerchiefs and other things in this
manner, and employing a delldleh (or female broker)
to take them to the market,or to other hharee’ms, for
sale. The visit of one hharee’m to another often ‘occu-
pies nearly a whole day. Eating, smoking, drinking
cofl‘ee and sherbet,gossiping,anddisplayingtheir finery,
are sufiicient "amusements to the company. On such
occasions, the master of the house is never allowed to
enter the hharee’m, unless on some particular and un-

fat women. In his love-songs,the Egyptian commonlydescribes

seldom admitted into a hharee’m; but on such occasions
as thoseabove-mentioned,theyoflen perform in front of

theyseem very insecurely seated; but I believe this is
not really the case: the ass is well girthed, and sure-
footed; and proceeds with a slow, ambling pace, and
very easy motion. The ladies of the highest rank, as
well as those of the middling classes, ride asses, thus
equipped: they are very seldom seen upon mules or
horses. The asses are generally hired. When alady
cannot procure ‘a hhoma’r ’a'lee, she rides one of the
asses equipped for the use of the men; but has a
aeggddeh (or prayer-carpet) placed over its saddle; and
the inferior members of the hharee’m, and females of
the middle orders, often do the same. Ladies never
walk abrow,unless they have to go but a very short
distance. They have a slow and shutllinggait, owing
to the ditiicultyof retaining the slippers upon their feet;

rule to return from paying a visit before sunset. The
ladies of the higher orders never go to a shop, but send

kinds of ornaments, articles of female apparel, &c.,:for

The lower orders in Egypt, with the exception of a

small; barely sufficient, in general, and sometimes in-

cheapest necessaries of life.

surprising to observe how simple and poor is the diet of
the Egyptianpessantry,andyethowrobustandhealtlry
most of them are, and how severe is the labour which
theycan undergo.
The women of the lower orders seldom pus a life of

and then use for heating theirovens, and for other pur-
poses. They are in a state of much greater subjection
to their husbands than is the case among the superior
classes. Not always is a poor woman allowed to eat

generallywalks behindhim; and if there be anything
for either of them to carry, it is usually borne by the
wife; unless it be merely apipe orastick. Some wo-

tables, &c.; and thus contribute as much as theirhus-
bands, or even more than the latter, to the support of
their families. When a poor Egyptian is desirous of
marrying, the chief object of his consideration is the
dowry, which is usually from about twenty rig/a'ls (or
nine shillings)to four times that amount, if consisting
onlyof money; and ratherless if,asis the case through-
out a great part of Egypt, it comprise certain articles of
clothing: if he can alford to give the dowry,he seldom
hesitates to marry; for a little additional exertion will
enable him to support a wife and two or three children.
At the age of five or six years, the children become of
use to tend the flocks and herds; and at 'a more ad-
vanced age, until theymarry, theyassist their fathersin
the operations of agriculture. The poor in Egypt have
ofien to depend entirelyupon their sons for support in
their old age; but many parents are deprived of these
aids, and consequentlyreduced to beggary,or almost to
starvation. A few months ago, the Ba’sha, during his
voyage from Alexandriato this city (Cairo), happening
to land at a villageon the bank of the Nile, a poor man
of the place ran up to him, and grasped his sleeve so
tightly,‘thatthe surrounding attendants could not make
him quit his hold : he complainedthat, althoughhe had
been once in very comfortable circumstances, he had
been reduced to utter destitution by having his sons
taken from him in his old age as recruits for the army.
The Ba’sha (who generally pays attention to personal
applications) relieved him; but it was by ordering that
the richest man in the villageshould give him a cow.
A young family,however, is sometimes an insupport-
able burden to poor parents. Hence, it is not a very
rare occurrence, in Egypt, for children to be publicly

canied about for sale, by their mothers or by women
employed by the fathers: but thisvery seldom happens
except in cases of great distress. When a mother dies,
leavingone or more children unweaned, and the father
and othersurviving relations are so poor as not to be
able to procure a nurse, this singular mode of disposing
of the child or children is often resorted to; or some-
times an infantis laid at the door of a mosque, generally
when the congregationis assembledto perform the noon-
players of Friday; and in this case it usually happens
thatsome member of the congregation,on coming out
of the mosque, and seeing the poor foundling,is moved
withpity,and takes it home to rear in his family,not as
a slave, but as an adopted child; or, if not. it is taken
under the care of some person until an adoptive father
or motherbe found for it. A short time ago, a woman
offered for sale, to the mistress of a familywithwhom a
friend of mine is acquainted in this city, a child a few
days old, which she professed to have found at the door
of a mosque. The lady said that she would take the
child,to rear it for the sake of God, and in the hope
thather own child,an only one, might be spared to her
as a reward for her charity; and handed, to the woman
who brought the infant, ten piasters (then equiva-
lent to a little more than two shillings): but the otfered
remuneration was rejected. This shows that infants
are sometimes made mere objects of trafiic; and some
persons who purchase them may make themtheirslaves,
and sell them again. I have been informed,by a slave
dealer (and his assertion has been confirmed to me by
otherpersons), thatyoung Egyptian girls are sometimes
sold as slaves from other countries, eitherby a parent or
by some other relation. The slave-dealer here alluded

inferior tribe,theykilltwo, three, or even four, in blood;
revenge. The prevalence of the barbarous Bed’awee-
law of blood-revenge among the inhabitants of the
villages of Egypt has been mentioned in a former
chapter: the homicide, or any person descended from
him, or from his great-grandfather’sfather,is killed by
any of such relations of the person whom he has slain;
and when the homicide happens to be of one tribe, and
the person killed of another,often a petty war breaks
forth between these two tribes,and is sometimes con-
tinued.or occasionallyrenewed,during a period ofseveral
years. The same is also frequently the result, of a
triflinginjury committed bya memberof one tribeupon
a person of another. In many instances, the blood-
revenge is taken a century or more after the commission
of the act which has occasioned it; when the feud, for
i
thattime, has lain dormant, and perhaps is remembered
by scarcely more than one individual. Two tribes in
Lower Egypt,which are called Sa’ad and HImra’m,are
most notorious for them petty wars and feuds; and
hence their names are commonly applied to any two
persons or parties at enmity with each other., It is
astonishing that, in the present day, such acts (which, '
if committed in a town or city in Egypt, would be
punished by the death of, perhaps, more than one of
the persons concerned) should be allowed. Some other
particulars respecting blood-revenge, and its conse-
quenees, have been stated in the chapter above alluded
to. The avenging of blood is allowed by the Ckoor-a'n;
but moderation and justice are enjoined in its execu-
tion; and the ‘petty wars which it so ofien occasions
in the present age are in opposition to a precept of the
Prophet,who said “ If two Moos’limscontend with their

swords, the slayer and the slain will be in the fire [of
Hell].” ’
The Fella’hhee’n of Egypt resemble the Bed’awees in
other respects. When a Fella/hhah is found to have
been unfaithful to her husband, in general, he, or her
brother, throws her into the Nile,with a. stone tied to
her neck; or cuts her in pieces, and then throws her
remains into thedriver. In most instances, also, afather
or brotherpunishes in the same manner an unmarried
daughter or sister who has been guiltyofincontinence.
These relations are considered as more disgracedthan
the husband by thecrimeof the woman; and are often
“despised iftheydo not thus punish her.

their social manners; though generally very easy in
theirdemeanoar, and free in their conversation. Scu-
ral oftheirmost common usages are founded upon pre-

from all otherpeople. Among these is their custom of
greeting eachother with the salutation of “ Peace be on

you be peace,and themercy ofGod, and his blessings1'!”
This salutation is never to be addressed by a Moos’lim

nor vice versa. The giving it, by one Moos’lim to
another,is a duty‘; but one thatmaybeomitted without
sin: the returning it is absolutely obligatory: the
former is a soo1L’neh ordinance; and the latter, furd.
Should a. Moos’lim, however, thus salute, by mistake,

generallyrevokes his salutation: so also he sometimes

saying “Peaeebeon us, and on [all] the right worship-

The chief rules respecting salutation,as dictated by
the Prophet,and generallyobserved by modern Moos’-
lims, are as f'ol|ow.—The person riding should firs:

also, for one only to return, the salutetion. It is re
quired, too, that a Moos’lim,when he enters a house,
should salute the people of that house; and that he
should do he same when he leaves it. He should
always salute first, and ‘then talk.—Bnt,to the above‘
rules, there are some exceptions. For instance, in is
crowded city,it is not necessary (indeed it is hardly‘
possible) to salute many of those whom one may pas;

teymecinch. Thelatter mode ofteymee’neh,whichis the
more respectful,is often performed to a person ofsuperior
rank, not only at first, with the sela’m (or salutation of
“Peacebe on you "),but also. frequentlyduring a con-
versation, and in the latter case, withoutthe sela’m.
A person of the lower orders, on approaching a
superior, particularlyif the latter be a'l‘urk,does not
always’ give the sela'm, but only performs this tey—
mee’neh; and he shows his respect to a man of high
rankby bendingdown his hand to the ground, and then
putting it to his lips and forehead, withoutpronouncing
the sels’m. It is acommon custom, also, for a man to
kiss the hand of a superior (generallyon the back only,
but sometimeson the back and front),and thento put it
to his forehead, in order to pay him particular respect;
but in most cases, the latter does not allowthis; and
onlytouches the hand that is extended towards his: the
otherperson, then,merelyputs his own hand ‘to his lips
and forehead. To testify abject submission, in craving
pardon for an olfenee, or interceding for another per-
son, or begging any favour of a superior, not unfra-
quentlythe feet are kissed instead of the hand. The
son kisses the hand of the father; the wife, thatof her
husband; and the slave, and ofien the free servant, that
of the master. The slaves and servants of a grandee
kiss theirlord’s sleeve, or the skirt ofhis clothing.
When particular friends salute each other, theyjoin
their right hands, and then,eachkisses his own hand,
‘and puts it to his lips and forehead, or his forehead
only,or his breast; or merely places it on his breast.
withoutkissing it: ifafter a long absence, and on some
otheroccasions, theyembrace each other; each falling

of the face or neck. and then upon the left. Another
mode of salutation is very commonly practised among
the lower orders, when two friends or acquaintances
meet after a journey: joining their right hands, each of
them complimentsthe other on his safety,andexpresses
his wishes for his welfare, by repeating, alternately,
many times, the words sel'a'ma’t and teiyibedn‘:in
commencing this ceremony,which is often continued
for nearlya minute before theyproceed to make any
particular inquiries, theyjoin their hands in the same
manner as is usually practised by us; and at each
alternation of the two expressions above-mentioned.they
change the position of the hands: in repeating the
second word, each of the two persons turns his fingers
over the thumbof the other; and in repeating the tint
word again, the former position is resumed. . .. 1 :

In polite society,various other formal aalutationsand
complimentsfollow the sela’m. To most of these, these
are particular replies; or two or more dilferentfonns of

room is called the sudr; and the whole of the seat
which extends along it is .more honourable than those
which extend along the sides; each of which is called
gcmb. Visiters inferior in rank to the master of the
house never seat themselves at the upper end unless in-
vited to do so by him ; and when so invited, theyoften
decline the offered honour. His equals sit at their ease,
cross-legged, or with one knee raised; and recline
against the cushions: his inferiors (first,at least) often
sit upon their heels; or take their place upon the edge
of the deewa’n; or, if very much beneathhim in grade,
seat themselves upon the mat or carpet. In strict
etiquette, the visiter should not, at first, suffer his hands
to appear, when entering the room, or when seated;
but should let the sleeves fall over them; and when he
has taken his place on the deewa’n,- he should not
stretdi out his legs, nor even allow his feet to be seen:
but these rules are not often attended to, excepting in
the houses of the great. Various formal compliments
and salutations are given and returned after the sela'm;
and some of them, particularly the expressions of
“_tei'yibee’n" and “
eysh hha'l’koom,” are repeated
several times during the same interview.
Sometimes the visiter’s own servant attends him with
his pipe: the former takes his tobaectrpnrse out of his
bosom, and gives it to the servant, who folds it up and
returns it after having filled the pipe, or after the ter-
mination ofthevisit: ot.herwise,a servant of the host

without salt.” On receiving the pipe, and the coffee,
the visiter salutes the master of the house with the
teymedneh, which the latter returns; and the same is
done on returning the cup to the servant. 'Ihe master
of the house also salutes his guest in the same manner,
if the latter be not much beneathhim in rank,on receiv-
ing and returning his own cup of coffee. The sub-
jects of conversation are generallythe news of the day,
the state of trade, the prices of provisions, and some-
times religion and science. Facetious stories are often
related ; and, very frequently,persons in the best society
tell tales, and quote proverbs, of the most indecent na-
ture. In good society, people seldom talk of each
other’s hharee’ms; but intimate friends,and many per-
sons who do not strictlyobserve therules of good breed-
ing,very often do so, and in a manner not alwaysdeli-
cate. Genteel people inquire respecting each other’s
“houses,” to ascertain whether their wives and families
are welI.—Visits not nnfrequentlyoccupy several hours;
and sometimes (especiallythose of hharee’ms),nearlya
whole day. The pipes are replenished, or replaced by
others, as often as is necessary; for however long a
visiter may stay, be generallycontinues smokingduring
thewhole time; and sometimes cofl'ee is brought again,
or sherbet. The manner in which the coffee and sher-
bet are served has been before described. A person re-
ceives the same compliment after drinking a glass of
sherbet as after taking a draught of water‘; and re-
pliesto it in the same manner.
In the houses of the rich, it used to be a common
_custom to sprinkle the guest, before he rose to take his
leave,with rose or orange-flowerwater; and to perfume

him withthe smoke of some odoriferous substance; but
of late years, thispracticehas becomeunfrequent. The
scent-bottle, which is called ckaom'cIcoom, is of plain
or giltsilver, or fine brass, or china, or glass; and has a
cover pierced witha small hole. ~The perfuIning'-vessel,

ing charcoal is lined, or half filled,with gypsum-plas-
ter; and its cover is pierced with apertures for the
-emission of the smoke. The miUkhar’ah is used last:
it is presented by a servant to the visiter or master,
who wafts the smoke towards his face, beard, &c., with
his right hand. Sometimes it is opened; to emit the
smoke more freely. The substance most commonly
used in the mib’khar'ah is aloes-wood*,or benzoin1, or

cascarilla-bark'. The wood is moistened before it is
phced upon the burning coals. Ambergrisf is also
used for the same purpose; but very rarely,and only
in the houses of persons of great wealth; as it is ex-
tremely costly. As soon as the visiter has been per-
fumed, he takes his leave ; giving the sela'm, which is
returned to him, and payingand receivingother set com-
pliments. If he be a person of much higher rank than
the master of the house. the latter not only rises. but
also accompanieshim to the top of the stairs, and then
commends him to the care of God.
It is usual for a person, after paying a visit of cere-
mony, and on some other occasions, previously to his
leavingthe house, to give a small present (two or three
piasters, or more, accordingto circumstances) to one,
orto several, of the servants ; and if his horse or mule
or ass be waiting for him at the door, one of the ser-
vants goes out with him, to adjust h's dress when he
mounts: this oflicionsperson particularly expects a pre-
sent. When money is thus given to a man's servants,
it is considered incumbent upon their master to do
exactlythe same when he returns the visit.
Friends very ofien send presents to each other,merely
for the sake ofcomplyingwith common custom. When
a person celebrates any private festivity, he gnerally
receives presents from most of his friends; and it is a
universal rule thathe should repay the donor by a simi-
lar gift, or one of the same value, on a similaroccasion.
It is common for the receiver of a present, on such an
event, even to express to the giver his hope that he
may have to repay it on the occasion of a like festivity. .

to the acquitmentof the obligation imposed by the gift,
which would be offensive to a generous European,i,in
this country, esteemed polite. The present is generally
wrapped in an embroidered handkerchief,which is re-
turned, with a trifling pecuniary gratification, to the
bearer. Fruit, laid upon leaves, and sweetmeats and
other dainties,placed in a dish or on a tray,and covered
with a rich handkerchief or napkin, are common pre-
sents. Very frequently,a present is given by a person
to a superior with the view of obtaining something
more valuable in return. This is often done by a ser-
vant to his master; and the gifi; is seldom refused; but
often paid for immediatelyin money, more than equi-
valent. It is generally with the expectation above
mentioned that an Oriental gives a present to a Euro-
pean. The custom of giving money to the servants of
a friend,after paying him a visit, is not now so com-
mon as it was a few years since; but it is stillobserved
by most persons on the occasion of a visit of ceremony;
and particularlyon the two ’eeds, or religious festivals,
and by the guests at private festivities. Othercustoms
of a similar nature, which are observed at these festi-
vities, will be described.in a subsequent chapter“‘. To
decline the»
acceptance of a present generally gives
oflience; and is considered as reflecting disgraceupon
the person who has offered it.
There are many forma.l usages which are observed
in Egypt not merely on the occasions of ceremonious
visits, or in the company of strangers, or at the casual
meetings of friends,but also in the ordinary intercourse
of familiar acquaintances. When a man happens to
sneeze, he says “ Praise be to God 1-!” Each person

present (servants generallyexcepted) then says to him
“God have mercy on you*!” to which the former
generally replies “God guide us and guide you?! ”
or
he returns the compliment in words of a similar pur-
port. Should he yawn, he puts the back of his left
hand to his mouth, and then says “I seek refuge with
God from Satan the accursedi!”
but he is not compli-
mented on this act; as it is one which should rather
be avoided; for it is believed that the devil is in the
habit of leaping into a gaping month. For a breach
of good manners, it is more common to ask the pardon
of God, than that of the present company; by saying
“I beg pardon of God, the Great§!” When a man
has just been shaved. or been to the bath,when he has
just performed the ablution preparatory to prayer,when
he has been saying his prayers, or doing any other
meritorious act, when he has just risen from sleep,
when he has purchased or put on any new article of 7
dress, and on many other occasions, there are particular
compliments to be paid to him, and particularreplies for
him to make.’
It is a rule with the Moos’lims to honour the right
hand and foot above the left: to use the right hand for
all honourable purposes; and the left, for actionswhich,
though necessary, are unclean: to put on and take off
the right shoe before the left; and to put the right foot
first over the thresholdof a door.
The Egyptians are extremelycourteous to each other,
and have a peculiar grace and dignity in their manner

of salutation and their general demeanour, combined
with easiness of address, which seem natural to them;
being observable even in the peasants. The middle
and higher classes of townspeople pride themselves
upon theirpoliteness and elegance of manners, and their
wit, and fluencyof speech; and with some justice: but
theyare not less free in their conversation than their
less accomplished fellow-countrymen. Alfabilityis a
general characteristic of the Egyptians of all-classes.
It is common for strangers, even in a shop. after mu-
tual salutation,to enter into conversation with each other
with as much freedom as if they were old acquaint-
ances; and for one who has a pipe to offer it to another
who has none; and it is not unusual, nor is it generally
considered unpolite, for persons in a first, casual meet-
ing, to ask each other’s names, professions or trades,
and places of abode. Lasting acquaintances are often
formed on such occasions. In the middle and higher
ranks of Egyptian society, it is very seldom thata man
is heard to say anything offensive to the feelings of
another in his company; and the most profligate never
venture to utter an expression meant to cast ridicule
upon sincere religion: most persons, however, in every
class, are otherwise more or less licentious in theircon-
versation, and extremely fond of joldng. They are
generally very lively and dramatic in their talk; but
scarcely ever noisy in their mirth. They seldom in-
dulge in loud laughter; expressing their enjoyment of
anythingludicrous by a smileor an exclamation.

LANGUAGE, IJTERATURE,AND Scu:-Nos.
THE metropolis of Egypt maintains the reputation by
which it has been distinguished for many centuries, of
being the best school of Arabic literature, and of Mo-
hhammadan theologyand jurisprudence. Polite know-
ledge has much declined among the Arabs universally;
but least in Cairo: consequently,the fame of the pro-
fessors of this citystill remains unrivalled; and its great
mosque, the Az'ha.r, continues to attract innumerable
students from every quarter of the Moos’lim world.
The Arabicspoken by the middle and higher classes
in Cairo is generally inferior, in point of grammatical
correctness and pronunciation, to the dialects of the
Bed’awees of Arabia, and of the inhabitants of the
towns in their immediate vicinity; but much to be pre-
ferred to those of Syria ; and still more, to those of the
Western Arabs. The most remarkable peculiaritiesin
the pronunciationof the people of Egypt are the follow
ing:—'l‘hefifthletter of the alphabetis pronounced by
the natives of Cairo, and throughoutthe greater part of
Egypt, as g in give; while,in most parts of Arabia,
and in Syria and other countries, it receives the sound
of in joy: but it is worthyof remark,that,in a part
of southern Arabia, where, it is said, Arabicwas first
spoken, the former sound is given to this letter. In
those parts of Egypt where this pronunciation of the
LANGUAGE. 263
fifthletter prevails,the sound of hem'zeh (which is pro-
duced by a sudden emission of the voice after a total
suppression) is given to the twenty-first letter, excepting
by the better instructed, who give to this letter its true
sound, which I represent by ck. In other parts of
Egypt, the pronunciationof the fifth letter is the same‘
as that of j in joy,or nearlyso; and the twenty-first
letter is pronounced as g in give. By all the Egyptians,
in common with most other people who speak the
Arabic language, the third and fourth letters of the
alphabetare pronounced alike, as our t; and the eighth
and ninth,as our d.-—Of the peculiarities in the struc-
ture of the Egyptian dialect of Arabic,the most remark-
able are, the annexation of the letter sheen in negative
phrases,in the same manner as the word “
pas” is used
in French; as ma’ yerda’sh, for ma’ yer'da, “he will
not consent”; ma’ hoo’:h tezlyib,fbr ma’ hot/a tdyib,
“it is not good”; the placing the demonstrative pro-
noun after the word to which it relates; as el-beytdc’,
“this house”; and a frequent unnecessary use of the
diminutiveform in adjectives;as sooghdyir,for aagheér,
“small”;cIcoorei'yib, for ckaredb, “near.”
There is not so much difference between the literaiy
and popular dialects of Arabicas some European Ori-
entalists have supposed. The latter maybedescribed
as the literary dialect simplified, principally by the
omission of the final vowels and other terminations
which distinguish the different cases of nouns and some
of the persons of verbs. Nor is there so great a differ-
ence between the dialects of Arabicspoken in different
countries as some persons, who have not held intercourse
withthe inhabitants of such countries, have imagined:
theyresemble each othermore than the dialects of some

of the different counties in England. The Arabiclan-
guage abounds with synonymes; and, of a number of
words which are synonymous, one is in common use in
one country, and another elsewhere. Thus, the Egyp-
tian calls milk lel/m ; the Syrian calls it hha.’ee'b : the
word lzb/en is used in Syria to denote a particular pre-
paration of sour milk. Again, bread is called in Egypt
’e_1/sh; and in other Arab countries,k/1oob’2; and many
examples of a similar kind might be adduced.—The
pronunciationof Egypt has more softness than thatof
Syria and most other countries in which Arabic is
spoken.
The literature of the Arabs is very comprehensive;
but the number of their books is more remarkablethan
the variety. The relative number of the books which
treat of religion and jurisprudence may be stated to be
about one-fourth: next in numberare works on gram-
mar, rhetoric, and various branches of philology: the
third in the scale of proportion are those on history
(chieflythat of theArab nation),and on geography: the
fourth, poetical compositions. Works on medicine,
chymistry,the mathematics,algebra, and various other
sciences, &c.,are comparativelyvery few.
There are, in Cairo, many large libraries; most of
which are attached to mosques, and consist, for the
greater part, of works on theologyand jurisprudence, and
philology. Several rich merchants, and others, have
also good libraries. The booksellers ofCairo are, I am
informed,only eight in number‘; and their shops are
but illstocked. Whenever avaluable book comes into
the possession of one of these persons, he goes round
with it to his regular customers; and is almost sure of

findinga purchaser. The leaves of the books are seldom
sewed together; but theyare usually enclosed in a cover

(called zurf) of pasteboard and leather. Five sheets,
or double leaves, are commonly placed together, one
withinanother; composingwhat is called a Iuzrra's. The
leaves are thus arranged, in small parcels, withoutbeing
sewed, in order thatone book maybe of use to a number
of persons at the same time; eachtaking a karra's. The

this court, the side towards Mek’keh, is the chief place
of prayer; a spaciousportico: on each of theotherthree
sides are smaller porticoes, divided into a number of
apartments, called riwdcks,each of which is destined
for the use of natives of a particular country, or of a
particular province of Egypt. This buildingis situated
in the heart of the metropolis. It is not remarkablein
point of architecture, and is so surrounded by houses
thatvery little of it is seen externally. The students are
called mooga'wiree’n'. Each riwa'ck has a libraryfor
the use ofits members; and from these books, and the
lectures of the professors, the students acquire their
learning. Theregularsubjects of study are grammatical
inflexion and syntax ‘I’, rhetoric I,versification§, logicI],
theologyfil,the exposition of the Ckoor-a’n", the Tra-
ditions of the Prophet1-13 the complete science of juris-

students, being natives of Cairo, are of the Sha'fe’ee
sect; and always the Sheykh, or head of the mosque,-is
of this sect. None of the students pay for the instruc-
tion they reoeive; being mostly of the poorer classes.
Most of those who are strangers, having riwa’cks_appro-
priated to them, receive a dailyallowance of food, pro-
vided from funds chieflyarisingfrom therents of houses
bequeathedfor theirmaintenance. Those of Cairo and its
neighbourhood used to receive a similar allowance; but
this they no longer enjoy,exceptingduringthe month of
Rum’ada’n: for the present Ba’sha of Egypt has taken
possession of all the cultivable land which belonged to
the mosques; and thus the Az'har has lost the greater
portion of the property which it possessed: nothingbut
the expenses of necessary repairs, and the salaries of its
principal oflicers, are provided for by the government.
The professors, also, receive no salaries. Unless they
inherit property,or have relations to maintain them,they
have no regular means of subsistence but teaching in
private houses, copying books, &c.; but theysometimes
receive presents from thewealthy. Any person who is
competent to the task may become a professor by leave
of the Sheykh of the mosque. The students mostly
obtain their livelihood by the same means as the pro-
fessors; or by reciting the Ckoor-a'n in private houses,
and at the tombs and other places. When sufiiciently
advanced in theirstudies, some of thembecomecka'dees,
moolltees, ima'ms of mosques, or schoolmasters,in their
native villages or _towns, or in Cairo: others enter into
trade: some remain all their lifetime studying in the
Az'har; and aspire to be ranked among the higher
’Ool’ama. Since the confiscation of the lands which
belonged to the Az’har, the number of that class of
BLIND STUDENTS. 269
students to whom no endowed riwa’ck is appropriated
has very much decreased. The number of students,
including all classes excepting the blind, is (as I am
informed by one of the professors) about one thousand
five hundred“'.
There is a chapel (called Za'wi_1/et el-’Omya'n,'or the
Chapel of the Blind),adjacent to the eastern angle of
the Az'har,and one‘of the dependencies of thatmosque,
where at present about three hundred poor blind men,
most of whom are students, are maintained, from funds
bequeathed for that purpose. These blind men often
conduct themselves in a most rebellious and violent
manner: they are notorious for such conduct, and for
their fanaticism. A short time ago, a European traveller
entering theA7/har,and his presence there beingbuzzed
about, the blind men eagerlyinquired “ Where is the
infidel?” adding “We willkill him ;” and gropingabout
at the same time to feel and lay hold of him’: theywere
the only persons who seemed desirous of showing any
violence to the intruder. Before the accession of the
present Ba'sha, they often behavedin a very outrageous
manner whenever theyconsidered themselves oppressed,
or scanted in their allowance of food: theywould, on
these occasions, take a few guides, go about with staves,
seize the turbans of passengers in thestreets, and plunder
the shops. The most celebrated ofthe presentprofessors

The Moos’lim ’ool’ama are certainly much flatteredin
the pursuit of some of the paths of learning by the’:-
religion; and superstition sometimes decides a point
which has been oontroverted for centuries. There is one
s‘ r means of settling a contention on any point of
faith,science, or fact, of which I ‘must give an instance.
The following anecdote was -related to me by the Ima’|a
of the late Moof'tee (thesheykh El-Mah’dee): I wrote
it in Arabic,at his dictation, and shall here translate hi
words. The sheykh Mohham’madEl-Bahei’ (rlearnetl
man, whom the vulgar regard as a weflee, orespeeial
favourite of heaven) was attending the lectures of the
sheykh El-Emee’r El-Kebee’r(sheykhof the sect of the
Me/likees), when the professor read, from the Ga’mi'
es-Saghee’r"’ of Es-Sooyoo’tee,this saying of the Pro-
phet “
VerilyEl-Hhas’an and E1-Hhoeey’n are the two
lords of the youthsof the people of Paradise, in Para-
dise,” and proceeded to remark, in his lecture, afier
having given a summary of the history of El-Hhas’an
and El-Hhosey’n, that,as to the common opinion of the
people of Mnsr (or Cairo)' respecting the head of El-
Hhosey’n,holding it to be in the famous Mesh'hed in
this city (themosque of the Hhas’aney’n),it was with-
outfonndation; not being established by any credible
authority. “I was affected,” says Mohha.m’msd El-
Bahei’, “with excessive grief,by this remark; since I
believedwhat is believed by people, of integrity and of
intuition, that the noble head was in this Mesh’hed,;
and I entertained no doubt of it: but I would not op-
pose the sheyklr El-Emee’r, on account of his high

reputation and extensive knowledge. The lecture ter-
minated, and I went away, weeping; and when night
overshaded the earth, I rose upon my feet, praying, and
humblysupplicating my Lord, and betaking myself to
his most noble apostle (God favour and preserve him !),
beggingthat I might see him in my sleep, and that he
would inform me_in my sleep of the truth of the matter
ooncemingthe placeof thenoble head. And I dreamed
that I was walking on the way to visit the celebrated
Mesh'hed El-Hhosey'nee in Musr, and that I approached
the ckoobfbeh“‘, and saw in it a spreading light, which
filled it: and I entered its door, and found 9. sheree’f
standing by the door; and I saluted him, and he re-
turned my salutation, and said to, me ‘
Salute the
Apostle of God (God favour and preserve him!) ;‘ and
I looked towards the ckib’leh+, and saw the Prophet
I
‘(God favour and preserve him!) sitting upon a throne,
and a man standing on his right, and another man
standing on his left: and I raised my voice, saying
‘
Blessing and peace be on thee, 0 Apostle of God!’
and I repeated this several times, weeping as I did it:
and I heard the Apostle of God ,(God favour and pre-
serve him!) say to me ‘Approach, 0 my son! 0 Mo-
~hham'mad!’ Then the first man took me, and con-
ducted me towards the Prophet (God favour and pre-
serve him!) and placed me before his noble hands; and
I saluted him, and he returned my salutation, and said
to me ‘God recompense thee for thyvisit to the head
of El Hhosey’n my son.’ I said ‘O Apostle of God, is
the head of El-Hhosey’n here?’ He answered ‘Yesr,
‘ The saloon of the tomb.
f That is, towards the niche which marks the direction of

t is here.’ And I became cheerful: grief fled from
me; and my heart was strengthened. Then I said ‘ O
Apostle of God, I will relate to thee what my sheykh
and my preceptor El-Emee’r hath afiirmed in his lec-
ture : and I repeated to him the words of the sheykh:
and he (God favour and preserve him!) looked down,
and then raised his head, and said ‘The copyists are
excused.’ I awoke from my sleep joyful and happy:
but I found that much remained of the night; and I
became impatient of its length; longing for the morn
to shine, that I might go to the sheykh, and relate to
him the dream, in the‘hope that he might believeme.
When the morn arose, I prayed, and went to the house
of the sheykh; but found the door shut: I knocked it
violently; and the porter came in alarm, asking‘ Who
is that?’
but when he knew me, for he had known my
abode from the sheykh, he opened the door to me: if it
had been anotherperson, he would have beaten him.
I entered the court of the house, and began to call out
‘My Master! My master!’ The sheykh awoke, and
asked ‘Who is that?’ I answered ‘It is I,thypupil,
Mohham’mad E1-Bahei’ 1’ The sheykh was in wonder
at my coming at this time, and exclaimed ‘God’s abso-
lute glory! What is this? What is the news?’ think-
ing that some great event had happened among the
people. He then said to me ‘Wait while I pray.’ I
did not sit down until the sheykh came down to the
hall; when he said to me ‘ Come up :' and I went up,
and neither saluted him, nor kissed his hand, from the
effect of the dream which I had seen; but said ‘The
head of El- Hhosey’n is in thiswell-known mesh’hed in
Musr: there is no doubt of it.’ The sheykh said ‘ What
proof have you of that? If it be a true record, adduce
274 MODERN sorrruus.
it.’ I said ‘From a book, I have none.’ The sheylch
said ‘ Hastthouseen a vision?’ I replied ‘Yes;' and
I related it to him; and informed him thatthe Apostle
of God (God favour and preserve him !) had acquainted
me that the man who was standing by the doorwas
’Al’eetheson of Ab’ooTa’lib,and thathe who wason the
right _of the Prophet, by the throne,was Ab’ooBelrr,
and that he on his left was '0m’ar the son of El-
Khatta’b; and that theyhad come to visit the head of
the Ima’m El-Hhosey’n. The sheykh rose, and took
me by the hand, and said ‘Let us go and visit the
Mesh’hed El-Hhosey’nee’; and when he entered the
cltoob’beh, he said ‘Peace be on thee, 0 son of the
daughter of the Apostle of God! I believe that the
noble head is here, by reason of the vision which this
person has seen; for the vision of the Prophet is true;
since he hath said ‘
Whoso seeth me in his sleep seeth
me truly; for Satan cannot assume the similitude of
my form.’ Then the sheykh said to me ‘Thou hast be-
lieved, and I have believed: for these lights are not
illusive.”’—The above-quoted tradition of the Prophet
has oflenoccasioned otherpoints of dispute to he settled
in the same manner, by a dream; and when the
dreamer is a person of reputation, no one ventures to
contend against him.
The remarkmade at the commencementof this chap-
ter implies that there are, in the present day, many
learned men in the metropolis of Egypt; and there are
some also in other towns of this country. One of the
most celebrated of the modern ‘Ool’ama of Cairo is the
sheykh Hhas’an El-'Atta'r, who is the present sheykh of
the A2/bar‘. In theologyand jurisprudence,he is not

so deeply versed as some of his contemporaries,particu-
larlythe sheykh El-Ckoowey'sinee,whom I have before
mentioned; but he is eminently accomplishedin polite
literature "’. He is the author of an “ln's ”
or an
excellent collection of Arabicletters,on various subjects,
which are intended as models of epistolary style. This
work has been printed at Boo'la’ck. In mentioningits
author,I fulfila promise which he condescendedto ask
of me : supposing that I should publish, in my own
country, some account of the people of Cairo, he desired
me to state that I was acquainted with him, and to give
my opinion of his acquirements.—The sheykh Mo-
hham'mad Shiha’b is also deservedly celebrated as an
accomplishedArabicscholar,and elegantpoet. His afi'a~
bilityand wit attract to his house, every evening,a few
friends, whose pleasures, on these occasions, I some-
times participate. We are received in a small,but very
comfortable room: each of us takes his own pipe; and
coffee alone is presented to us: the sheykh's conversa-
tion is the most delightful banquet thathe can offer us.
—There are also several other persons in Cairo who
enjoy considerable reputation as philologistsand poets.
-—The sheykh ’Abd Er-R,ahhma’n El-Gebux’tee, an-
other modern author,and a native of Cairo, particularly
deserves to be mentioned. as having written a very ex-
cellent history of the events which have taken placein
Egypt since the commencementof the twelfih century
of the Flight‘!-. He died in 1825, or l826,soonafier my
first arrival in Cairo. His family was of El-Gebur’t

ing on the‘ocean. The Gebui’tees (or natives of that
country) are Moos’lims. They have a riwa’ck (or
apartment appropriated to such of them as wish to
study) in the Az'har; and there is a similar provision
for them at Mek'keh, and also at El-Medee'neh.
The works of the ancient Arab poets were but im-
perfectly understood (in consequence of many words
contained in them having become obsolete) between
two and three centuries, only, after the introduction of
the Mohhammadan faith: it must not ‘thereforebe in-
ferred, from what has been said in the preceding para-
graph, that persons able to explain the most difficult
passages of the early Arab authorsare now to be found
in Cairo, or elsewhere. There are, however, many in
Egypt who are deeply versed in Arabicgrammar, rhe-
toric, and polite literature; though the sciences mostly
pursued in this country are theologyand jurisprudence.
Few of the ’ool’ama of Egypt are well acquainted with
the history of their own nation ; much less with thatof
other people.
The literary acquirementsof those who do not belong
to theclasses who make literature their profession are of
a very inferior kind. Many of the wealthy trades-
people are well instructed in the arts of reading and
writing; but few of them devote much time to the pur-
suit of literature. Those who have committed to memory
the whole, or considerableportions, of the Ckoor-a'n,and
can recite two or three celebrated ckaseddehs (or short
poems),or introduce, now and then, an apposite quota-
tion in conversation, are considered accomplished per-
sons. Many of the tradesmen of Cairo can neither read
nor write, or can only read; and are obliged to have
recourse to a friend to write their accounts, letters, &c. :
scuznca. 277
but these persons generallycast accounts, and make in-
tricate calculations, mentally, with surprising rapidity
and correctness.
It is a‘very prevalentnotion among the Christians of
Europe, that the Moos’lims are enemies to almost every
branch of knowledge. This is an erroneous idea; but
it is true thattheir studies, in the present age, are con-
fined within very narrow limits. Very few of them
study medicine, chymistry (for our first knowledge of
which we are indebted to the Arabs),the mathematics,
or astronomy. The Egyptian medical and surgical
practitioners are mostly barbers, miserably ignorant of
the sciences which they profess, and unskilful in their
practice; partly in consequence of theirbeingprohibited
by their religion from availing themselvesof the advan-
tage of dissecting human bodies. But a number of
young men, natives of Egypt, are now receiving Euro-
pean instruction in medicine, anatomy, surgery, and
other sciences, for the service of the government. Many
of the Egyptians, in illness,neglectmedical aid; placing
their whole reliance on Providenceor charms. Alchymy
is more studied in this country than pure chymistry;
and astrology, more than astronomy. The astrolabe
and quadrant are almost the only astronomical instru-
ments used in Egypt. Telescopes are rarely seen here;
and the magnetic needle is seldom employed, excepting
to discover the direction of Mek’keh; forwhich purpose,
convenient little compasses (called ckiblea/yehx),showing
the direction of the ckibfleh at various large towns ‘in
different countries, are constructed, mostly at Dimya’t:
many of these have a dial, which shows the time of the
’asr at different places and different seasons. Those

they make chieflysubservient to their computations of

The Mohhammadan year consists of twelve lunar
months; the names of which are pronounced by the
Egyptians in the following manner :—
1- Mohhar'ram.
2. Suf'ar.
3. Rabee'5 el-Ow'wal.

about thirty-threeyears and a half: consequently,they
are only used for fixing the anniversariesof most reli-

when our next ensuing year is a leap-year; and, conse-
quently,after the following February,the corresponding
days of the Coptic and our months will be the same as
in other years. The Copts begin their reckoning from

twelve o'clock: an hour after sunset, one o’clock: two
hours, two o'clock; and so on to twelve: after twelve

ifnecessary, set theirwatches at sunset; or rathera few
minutes after; generallywhen theyhear thecall to even-

A pocket almanac is annuallyprinted at the govern-
ment-press at Bodla’ck*. It comprises the period of a
solar year, commencingand terminatingwith the vernal
equinox; and gives, for every day, the day of the week,
and of the Mohhammadan, Coptic, Syrian, and Euro-
pean months; together with the sun's place in the
zodiac,and the time of sunrise, noon, and the ’asr. It
is prefacedwith a summary of the principal eras and
feast-days of the Moos’lims, Copts, and others; and re-
marksand notices relating to the seasons. Subjoined
to it is a calendar_containing physical,agricultural, and
other notices for every day ‘in the year; mentioning
eclipses, &c; and comprising much matter suited to the
superstitions of the people. It is thework of Yahh’ya
Efen’dee, originallya Christian priest of Syria; but now
a Moos’lim.
Of geography, the Egyptians in general, and, with
very few exceptions, the best instructed among them,
have scarcely any knowledge: having no good maps,
theyare almost wholly ignorant of the relative situations
of the several great countries of Europe. Some few of
the learned venture to assert thatthe earth is a globe;
but theyare opposed by a great majorityof the’Ool’ama.
The common opinion of all classes of Moos’lims is, that
the earth is an almost plane expanse, surrounded by the
ocean, which, they say, is encompassed by a chain of
mountains called Cka’f.
Such being the state of science among the modern
Egyptians. the reader will not be surprised at finding

due allowances for many of its faults. We may hope
for, and, indeed, reasonably expect, a very great im-
provement in the intellectual and moral state of this
people, in consequence of the introduction of European
sciences, by which their present ruler has, in some de-
gree, made amends for his oppressive sway; but it is
not probable that this hope will be soon realized to any
considerable extent.

Trra Arabs are a very superstitious people; and none
of them are more so than those of Egypt. Many of
their superstitions form a part of their religion; being
sanctioned by the Ckoor-a’n; and the most prominent
of these is the beliefin Ginn, or Genii—in thesingular,
Givlnee.
The Ginn are said to be of prreadamite origin, an in-
termediate class of beings between angels and men,
created of tire, and capable of assuming the forms and
material fabric of men, brutes, and monsters, and of be-
coming invisible at pleasure. They eat and drink,pro-
pagate theirspecies (like, or in conjunctionwith, human
beings),and are subject to death; thoughtheygenerally
live many cenmriea. Their principal abode is in the
chain of mormtains called C’lra_'f, which are believedto
encompass the whole earth; as mentioned at the close
of the preceding chapter. Some are believers in El-
Isla’m: others are infidels. Of both these classes, the
Arabs stand in great awe ; and for the former,theyen-
tertain a high degree of respect. It is a common cus-
tom of this people, on pouring water, &c. on the ground,
to exclaim, or mutter, destoo’r.' that is, to ask the per-
mission, or crave the pardon, of any gin’nee that may
chance to be there: for the ginn are supposed to per-
vade both the solid matter of the earth and the firmn-

ment. They are also believed to inhabitrivers, mined
houses, wells, baths,ovens, and even thelatrina: hence,
persons, when theyenter the latter place,and when they
let down a bucket into a well, or light a fire, and on
other occasions, say, “ Permission!" or “ Permission ye
blessed‘!"; which words, in the case of entering the
latrina, theysometimes prefacewith a prayer for God's
protection against all evil spirits; but in doing this,
some persons are careful not to mention the name of
God after they have entered (deeming it improper in
such a place),and only say, “ I seek refuge with Thee
from the evil (thatis Satan) and the evil ones." These
customs present a commentary on the story in “the
Thousand and one Nights," in which a merchant is de-
scribed as having killed a gin’nee by throwingaside the
stone of a date which he had just eaten. In the same
story, and in others of the same collection, a gin’nee is
represented as approaching in a whirlwind of sand or
dust; and it is the general beliefof theArabs of Egypt,
thatthe zdbiah,or whirlwindwhich raises the sand or
dust in the form of a pillar of prodigious height, and
which is so often seen sweeping ncrom the fields and
deserts of this country, is caused by the flightof one of
these beings; or, in other words, that the gin’nee
“rides in the whirlwind.” A charm is usually uttered
by the Egyptians to avert the zdba’ah,when it seems
to be approachingthem: some of them exclaim, “
Iron,
thouunluckyf! ”
; as genii are supposed to have a great
dread ofthatmetal: others endeavour to drive away the
monster byrexclaiming, “ God is most great1 ! ". What

shihdb)is commonlybelieved to be a dart thrown by
God at an evil gin’nee; and the Egyptians, when they
see it, exclaim, “May God transfix the enemy of the
faith‘!”. The evil gin'nees are commonly termed
’Efree’l.v. The existence of ’efree’ts must be believed by
the Moos’lim on account of the occurrence, in the
Ckoor-a’n,of these words, “ An 'efree’t from among the
gin answered”
(chap. nvii. ver. 39) ; which words Sale
translates “A terrible genius answered." They are ge-
nerallybelieved to differ from the other g-inn in being
very powerful, and always malicious; but to be, in other
respects, of a similar nature.
Connected with the history of the ginn are many
fables not acknowledgedby theCkoor~a’n, and therefore
not credited by the sober Moos’lims, but only bythe less
instructed. The latter believe that the earth was in-
habited,before the time of Adam,by a race of beings
differingfrom ourselves in form, and much more power-
ful ; and thatforty (or, according‘to some, seventy—two)
prxeadamite kings, each of whom bore the name of
. Sooleyma’n (or Solomon), successively governed this
people. The last of these Sooleyma’nswas named Ga’n
Ib’n Ga'n; and from him, it is said, the ginn (who are
also called ga’n) derive their name. Hence, some be-
lieve the ginn to be the same with the pneadamite race
here mentioned: but ‘others assert that they (the gin)
were a distinct class’ of beings,and brought into subjec-
tion by theother race.
Ginnees are believedoften to assume, or perpetually
to wear, the shapes of cats, dogs, and other brute ani-
mals. The sheykh Khalee'l El-Meda’bighee, one of
the most celebrated of the ’ool’amaof Egypt, and author

of several works on various sciences, who died, at a very
advanced agc,dm-ing the periodofmy formervisit to

had, said he, a favourite black cat, which always slept
at the foot of his musquito-curtain. Once, at midnight,

and called, “Who is there?” A voice replied,“ I am

“
has had the name [of God] pronoimced upon it '.”——
“Then throw me down," said the other, “two cakes
of bread."—“The bread—basket,” answered the cat at
the window, “has had the name pronounced upon it.”
“
Well,” said the stranger, “
at least give me a drink of
water." But. he was answered that the water-jar had
been secured in the same manner; and asked what he
was to do, seeing that he was likelytodie of hunger
and thirst: thesheykh’s cat told him to go to the door
of the next house; and went there also himself, and
opened the door, and soon after returned: Next mom-
ing, the sheykh deviated from a habit which he had
constantly observed: he gave, to the cat, half of the
fatee’reh upon which he breakfasted,instead of a little
morsel, which he was wont to give; and afterwards said,

mediatelydisappeared, and he saw it no more.—B.idi-
culous as stories of this kind really are, it is impossible,
withoutrelatingone or more, to convey a just notion of
the opinions of the people whom I am attempting to
describe.
It is commonlyaflirmed,that malicious or disturbed
genii very often station themselves on the roofs, or at
the windows, of houses in Cairo, and other towns of
Egypt, and throw bricks and stones down into the
streets and courts. A few days ago, I was told of a case
of thiskind, which had alarmed the people in the prin-
cipal street of the metropolis for a whole week; many
brickshavingbeenthrowndownfrom some of thehouses
every day during this period; but nobody killed or
wounded. I went to the scene of these pretended
pranks of the genii,to witness them,and to make in-
quiries on the subject; but on my arrival there I was
told thattheregm (thatis, the throwing)had ceased. I
found no one who denied the throwing down of the
bricks, or doubted that it was the work of genii; and
the general remark, on mentioning the subject, was
“God avert from us theirevil doings!”
One of my friends observed to me, on thisoccasion,
thathe had met withsome Englishmenwho disbelieved
in the existence of genii; but he concluded thatthey
had never witnessed a public performance, thoughcom-
mon in their country, of which he had since heard,
called koomed’3/eh (or comedy); by which term he
meant to include all theatricalperformances. Addressing
one of his countrymen, and appealing to me for the
confirmationof his words, he then said—“ An Algerine,
a short time ago, gave me an account of a spectacle of
288 MODERN EGYPTIANS.
this kind which he had seen in London."—Here his
countryman interrupted him, by asking, “Is not Eng-
land in London? or is London a town in England?”
—My friend,with diflidence, and looking to me, an-
swered that London was the metropolis of England;
and then resumed the subject of the that-rt-' “"1136
house,“ sard he, "
in which the spectacle was exhibited
cannot be described: it was of a round form, withmany
benches on thefloor, and closets all round, in rows, one
above another, in which people of the higher classes
sat; and there was a large square aperture, closed with
a curtain. When the house was full of people, who
paid large sums of money to be admitted, it suddenly
became very dark: it was at night; and the house had
been lighted up with a great many lamps; but these
became almost entirely extinguished, all at the same
time, without being touched by any body. Then, the
great curtain was drawn up: theyheard the roaring of
the sea and wind; and indistinctlyperceived, through
the gloom, the waves rising and foaming, and lashing
the shore. Presently,a tremendous pearl ofthunderwas
heard; after a flash of lightning had clearlyshown to
the spectators the agitated sea: and then there fell a
heavy shower of real rain. Soon after, the day broke;
the sea became more plainly visible; and two ships
were seen in the distance: they approached,and fought
each other,firing their cannons; and a varietyof other
extraordinary scenes were afterwards exhibited. “ Now
it is evident,” added my friend,“
thatsuch wonders must
have been the works of genii, or at least performed by
their assistance."—He could not be convinced of his
error by my explanationsof these phenomena.
During the month of Rum'ada’n, the genii, it is said,
GBNIL 289
are confined in prison; and hence, on the eve of the
festival which follows that month,some of the women
of Egypt, with the view of preventing these objects of
dread from entering their houses, prinkle salt upon the
floors of the apartments; saying,as theydo it, “
In the
name of God, the Compassionate,the Merciful.”
A curious relic of ancient Egyptian superstition must
here be mentioned. It is believedthateach quarter in
Cairo has its peculiar guardian-genius, or Ag'atl1odaa-
mon, which has the form of a serpent. _
The ancient tombs of Egypt, and the dark recesses of
the temples, are commonly believed, by the people of
this country,to be inhabited by ’efree’ts. I found it im-
possible to persuade one of my servants to enter the
Great Pyramid with me, from his having this idea.
Many of the Arabs ascribe the erection of the Pyramids,
and all the most stupendous remains of antiquity in
Egypt, to Ga’n Ib’n Ga’n. and his servants, the g-inn;
conceivingit impossible thattheycould have been raised
by human hands.
The term ’efree’t is commonly applied ratherto an
evilgin’nee than any otherbeing; but theghosts of dead
persons are also called by this name; and many absurd
stories are related of them; and great are the fears
which theyinspire. There are some persons, however,
who hold them in no degree of dread.—I had once a
humorous cook, who was somewhat addicted to the in-
toxicating hhashee’sh: soon after he had entered my
service, I heard him. one evening,muttering and ex-
claiming, on the stairs, as if in surprise at some event;
and then politely saying,“ But why are you sitting here
in the draught?—Do me the favour to come up into
the kitchen, and amuse me with your conversation a

little:” the civil address, not being answered, was re-
peated and varied several times; till I called out to the
man, and asked him to whom he was speaking. “
The
’efree’t of a Turkishsoldier," he replied, “is sitting on
the stairs, smokinghis pipe, and refuses to move: he
'
came up from the well below: pray step and see him."
On my going to the stairs, and telling the servant that I
could see nothing,he only remarkedthatit was because
I had a clear conscience. He was told, afterwards, that
the house had long been haunted; but asserted thathe
had not been previouslyinformed ofthesupposed cause;
which was the fact of a Turkish soldier having been
murdered there. My cook professed to see this ’efree’t
frequently after.
The existence of Ghodls likewise obtains almost uni-
versal credence among themodern Egyptians, in com-
mon with several other Eastern nations. These beings
are said to appear in the forms of various animals, and
in manymonstrous shapes; to haunt burial~grounds,and
other sequestered spots; to feedupondead bodies; and to
kill and devour every human creature who has the mis-
fortune to fall in theirway. Hence, the term “
ghoo’l"
is applied, in general, to any cannibal.
That fancies such as these should exist in the minds
of a people so ignorant as those who are the subject of
these pages cannot reasonablyexcite our surprise. But
the Egyptians pay a superstitious reverence not to ima-
ginary beings alone: theyextend it to certain indivi-
duals of their own species ; and often to those who are
justly the least entitled to such respect*. An idiot or a
fool is vulgarly regarded by them as a being whose
mind is in heaven, while his grosser part mingles

among ordinary mortals; consequently, he is consi-
dered an especial favourite of heaven. Whatever enor

such acts do not affect his fame for sanctity; for they
are considered as the results of his soul, or reasoning
faculties, being wholly absorbed in devotion; so that
his passions are left without cont.rol. Lunatics who
are dangerous to society are kept in confinement; but
thosewho are harmless are generallyregarded as saints.
Most of the reputed saints of Egypt are either lunatics
or idiots or impostors. Some of them go about per-
fectly naked, and are so highly venerated, that the wo-
men, instead of avoiding them, sometimes suffer these
wretches to take any liberty with them in a public
street; and, by the lower orders, are not considered as
disgraced by such actions, which, however, are of very
rare occurrence. Others are seen clad in a cloak or
long _coat composed of patches of various coloured
cloths,which is called a dilclz,adorned with numerous
strings of beads, wearing a ragged turban, and bearing
a stall‘ with shreds of cloth of various colours attached
to the top. Some of them eat straw, or a mixture of
chopped straw and broken glass; and attract observa-
tion by a varietyof absurd actions. During my first
visit to thiscountry, I often met, in the streets of Cairo,
a deformed man, almost naked, with long matted hair,
and riding upon an ass, led by another man. On
these occasions. he always stopped his beast directly
before me, so as to intercept my way, recited the
Fa’t’hhah (or opening chapter of the Ckoor-a’n),and
then held out his hand for an aims. The first time
thathe thus crossed me, I endeavoured to avoid him;
292 MODERN RGYPTIANS.
but a person passing by remonstratedwith me, observ-
ing that the man before me was a saint, and that I
ought to respect him, and complywith his demand, lest
some misfortune should befal me. Men of this class
are supported by alms, which they often receive without
askingfor them. A reputed saint is commonlycalled
sheykh, moora’bit, or wel’ee. If affected with lunacy
or idiotcy,or of weak intellect, he is also, and more
properly,termed megzoo/b, or mesloa/b. Wel'ee is an
appellation correctlygiven only to an eminent and very
devout saint; and signifies “a favourite of heaven ;”
but it is so commonly applied to real or pretended
idiots, thatsome wit has given it a new interpretation,
as equivalent to belee'd, which means “a fool” or
“simpleton;” remarking that these two terms are
_equivalent bothin sense and in the numerical value of
the letters composing them: for welee is written with
the letters wa/oo, him. and ye’, of which the numerical
valuesare 6, 30, and 10, or, together,46 ; and belee'd
is written with be’, la’m, ye’. and da’l, which are 2, 30,
10, and 4, or, added together,46. A simpleton is
often jestinglycalled a wel’ee.
The Moos’lims of Egypt, in common with those of
other countries, entertain very curious superstitions re-
specting the persons whom they call wel’ees. I have
often endeavoured to obtain information on the most
mysterious of these superstitions; and have generally
been answered,“ You are meddlingwith the matters of
the taree'cl:a ,” or the religious course of the dur-
wee'shes; but I have been freely acquaintedwith the
general opinions on these subjects; and such are per-
haps all that might be required to be stated in a work
like the present: I shall, however, also relate what I
SAINTS. 293
have been told by karned persons, and by durwedshes,
in elucidation of the popularbelief. '
In the first place,if a person were to express a doubt
‘as to the existence of true wel’ees, he would be branded
with infidelity; and the following passage of the
Ckoor-a’n would be adduced to condemn him: “ Are
not thefavourites‘ of God those upon'_'whom no fear
shall come, and who shall not be grieved1-?" This is
considered as sufficient to prove thatthere is a class of
persons distinguished above ordinary human beings.
The question then suggests itself, “
Who, or of what
description, are these persons?” and we are answered,
“
They are persons wholly devoted to God, and pos-
sessed of extraordinary faith; and, according to their
degree of faith,endowed with the power of performing
miraclesI.”
The most holy of the wel’ees is termed the Ckootb ,-
or, accordingto some persons, there are two who have
this title; and again, according to others, four. The
term ckootb signifiesan axis ; and hence is applied to a
wel’ee who rules over others: theydependingupon him,
and being subservient to him. For the same reason it
is applied to temporal rulers, or any person of high au-
thority. The opinion thatthere are four ckootbs, I am
told, is a yidgar error, originating from the frequent
mention of “the four ckootbs,” by which expression
are meant the founders of the four most celebrated
orders of durwee’shes (the Rif'a”ee'yeh, Cka'diree’yeh,
Ahhmededyeh,and Bara'himeh); each of whom is be-
‘ In the original, ou/I¢e’a, or owliya’,plural of wel’ee.

294 MODERN EGYPTIANS.
lieved to have been the ckootb of his time. I have also
generallybeen told, thatthe opinion of there beingtwo
ckootbs is a vulgar error, founded upon two names,
Clzootb cl-Hhackedckah (or the Ckootb of Truth),and
Ckootb el-Glw/A (or the Ckootb of Invocation for help),
which properly belongto but one person. The term el-
Ckootb el-Mootawcl’lee is applied, by those who believe
in but one ckootb, to the one ruling at thepresenttime;
and by those who believein two, to the acting ckootb.
The Ckootb who exercises a superintendence over all
other wel’ees (whether or not there be another ckootb
—-for if there be, he is inferior to theformer) has,under
his authority,wel’ees of ditferent ranks, to perform dif-
ferent otlices; Negedbs, NacIzee’bs,Bedells ", &c.; who
are known only to each other,and perhaps to the rest
of the wel’ees, as holdingsuch offices.
The Ckootb,it is said, is often seen, but not known as
such: and the same is said of all who hold authority
under him. He always has a humble demeanour, and
mean dress; and mildlyreproves those whom he finds
actingimpiously; particularlythose who have a false re-
putation for sanctity. Though he is unknown to the
world, his favourite stations are well known; yet at these
placeshe is seldom visible. It is asserted thathe is almost
constantly seated at Mek’keh, on the roof of the
Kalabeh; and,though never seen there, is alwaysheard
at midnight to call twice, “ 0 thou most merciful of
thosewho show mercy1-!” which cry is then repeated
from the ma’d’nehs of the temple, by the moo-ed’dins:
but a respectable pilgrim,whom I have just questioned

upon this matter. has confessed to me that he himself
has witnessed thatthiscry is made by a regular minister
of the mosque; yet thatfew pilgrimsknow this: he be-
lieves, however, that the roof of the Ka'abeh is the
chief mur’Izaz (or station) of the Ckootb. Another
favourite station of this revered and unknown person is
the gate of Cairo called Ba’b Zoowey’leh,which is at
the southern extremity of that part of the metropolis
which constituted the old city; thoughnow in the heart
of the town; for the capital has greatlyincreased to-
wards thesouth, as it has also towards thewest. From
its being a supposed station of this mysterious being,
the Ba’b Zoowey'leh is commonly called “El-Mootm
wellee"‘.” One leaf of its great wooden door (which
is never shut), turned back against the eastern side of
the interior of the gateway, conceals a small vacant
space, which is said to be the place of the Ckootb.
Many persons, on pasing by it, recite the Fa't’hhah;
and some give aims to a beggarwho is generallyseated
there, and who is regarded by the vulgar as one of the
servants of the Ckootb. Numbers of persons afflicted
with head-ache drive a nailinto thedoor, to charm away
the pain; and many sufferers from the tooth-ache ex-
tract a tooth,and insert it in a crevice of thedoor, or fix
it in some other way, to insure their not beingattacked
again by the same malady. Some curious individuals
often try to peep behind the door, in the vain hope of
catching a glimpse of the Ckootb, should he happen to
be there, and not at the moment invisible. He has also
many other stations, but of inferior celebrity,in Cairo;
as well as one at the tomb of the seyd Ahh’mad El-
Bed'awee, at Tun’ta; another at El-Mahhal’leh (which,
" For Ba/6 El-Moo!awel’1¢¢.

as well as'l'un’ta,is in the Delta); and others in other
places. He is believed to transport himself from
Mek’keh to Cairo in an instant; and so also from any
one place to mother. Though he has a number of
favourite stations, he does not abidesolelyat these; but
wanders throughout the whole world, among persons of
every religion, whose appearance, dress, and language
he assumes; anddistributes to mankind,chieflythrough
the agency of the subordinate wel’ees, evils and bless-
ings, the awards of destiny. When a Ckootb dies, he
is immediatelysucceeded in his ofiice by another.
Many of the Moos’lims say that Elijah, or Elias,
whom they generallycall El-Khidr, was the Ckootb of
his time; and that he invests the successive ckootbs:
for theyacknowledgethat he has never died. This par-
ticular in their superstitious notions respecting the
ckootbs,combined with some others which I have be-
fore mentioned, is very curious when compared with
what we are told, in the Bible, of Elijah, of his being
transported from place to placeby the spirit of God;
of his investing Elisha withhis miraculous powers, and
his ofiiees; and of the subjection of the other prophets
to him and to his immediate successor‘. Some wel_'ees
renounce the pleasures of the world, and the society of
mankind; and, in a desert place.give themselvesup to
meditation upon heaven, and prayer; depending upon
divine providence for their support: but their retreat
becomes known; and the Arabs dailybring them food.
This, again, reminds us of the history of Elijah: for, in
theopinion of some critics, we should read, for theword
“
ravens,” in the fourth and sixthverses of the seven-
teenthchapter of the second book of Kings, “ Arabs:”
' See 1 Kings, xviii. 12, and 2 Kings,ii. 9-16.
SAINTS. 297
“ I have commanded:theArabs to feed thee”——“ And
the Arabs brought him bread." &c.
Certain wel'ees are said to be commissioned by the
Ckootb to perform offices which, according to the ac-
counts of my informants here, are far from beingeasy.
These are termed As-hha’b ed-Da1'ak,which is inter-
preted as signifying “
watchmen,” or “ overseers." In
illustrationof their employments,the followinganecdote
was related to me a few days ag'o.—A devout tradesman
in this city, who was ardently desirous of becominga
wel’ee, applied to a person who was generallybelieved
to belongto this holy class, and implored the latter to
assist him to obtain the honour of an interview with the
Ckootb. The applicant, after havingundergone a strict
examination as to his motives, was desired to perform
the ordinary ablution (el-woodoo') very early the next
morning; then to repairto the mosque of El-Moo-ei’yad
(at an angle of which is the Ba’b Zoowey’leh,or E1-
Mootawel’lee, before mentioned),and -to lay hold of
the first person whom he should see coming out of
the great door of this mosque. He did so. The first
person who came out was an old, venerable-looking
man °
but meanly clad; wearing a brown woollen
gown,(orzaaboo/t); and this proved to be the Ckootb.
The candidate kissed his hand, and entreated to
be admitted among the As-hha’b ed-Dar’ak. After
much hesitation, the prayer was granted: the Ckootb
said, “ Take charge of the district which consists of the
Durb el-Ahh’mar"‘ and its immediate neighbourhood;”
and immediatelythe person thus addressed found him-
self to be a wel'ee; andperceived thathe was acquainted
with things concealed from ordinary mortals: for a
" A street on the south of the Ba’b Zoowey’leh.

we|'ee is said to be acqnaintedvbyGod with all secrets-
necessary for him to know.—It is commonly said of a
wel’ee, that he knows what is secret‘, or not discover-
able by the" senses; which seems plainlycontradictory
to what we read in several placesin the Ckoor-a’n; that
none knowethwhat is secret (or hidden from the senses)
but God: the Moos’lims, however, who are seldom at
a. loss in a discussion, argue that the pamages above
alluded to, in the Ckoor-a’n, imply the knowledge of
secrets in an unrestricted sense; and that God, imparts
to wel’ees such secrets only as He thinkslit.
The wel’ee above mentioned, as soon as he had en-
tered upon his ofiice, walked throughhis district; and
seeing a man at a shop, with a jar full of boiledbeans
before him, from which he was about to serve his cus-
tomers as usual, took up a large piece ofstone, and, with
it, broke thejar. The bean»se1ler immediatelyjumped
up; seized hold of a palm-stick that lay by his side;
and gave the wel’ee a severe beating: but the holy man
complained not; nor did he utter a cry: as soon as he
was allowed, he walked away. When he was gone, the
bean-seller began to try if he could gatherup some of
thescattered contents of the jar. A portion of thejar
remained in its place; and on looking into this, he saw
a venomous serpent in it, coiled round, and dead. In
horror at what he had done,he exclaimed,“There is no
strength nor power but in God! I implore forgiveness
of God, the Great! What have I done ! This man is

his forgiveness ; but he saw 'him not; for he was too
much bruised to be able to walk. On the followingday,
however, with his limbs still swollen from the blows he
had received, the wel’ee limped throughhis district, and
broke a great jar of milkat a shop not far from thatof
the bean-seller; and its owner treated him as thebean-
seller haddone theday before; but whilehe was beating
him, some persons ran up, and stopped his hand, in-
forming him that the person whom he was thus pu-
nishing was a‘wel’ee, and relating to him the affair of
the serpent thatwas found in thejar of beans. “
Go,
and look,” said they, “
in your jar of milk,and you will
find, at the bottom of it, somethingeither poisonous or
unclean.” He looked; and found, in the remains of
thejar, a dead dog.—0n the third day, the wel’ee, with
the help of a statf, hobbled painfully up the Durb el-
Ahh’mar, and saw a servant carrying,upon his head,
a supper-tray covered with dishes of meat, vegetables,
and fruit, for a party who were going to take a repast in
the country. He put his staff‘ between the servant's
legs, and overthrew him ; and thecontents of the dishes
were scattered in the street. With a mouth full of
curses, the servant immediatelybegan to give the saint
as severe a thrashingas he himself expected to receive
from his disappointed master for this accident : but
several persons soon collected around him; and one of
these bystanders observed a dog eat part of the con-
tents ofone of the dishes, and,amomentafter, fall down
dead: be instantly seized the hand of the servant, and
informed him of this circumstance, which proved that
the man whom he had been beating was a wel’ee.
Every apology was made to the injured saint, withmany
prayers for his forgiveness;but he was so disgusted with

his new oflice,thathe implored God and the Ckootb to
release him from it; and, in answer to his solicitations,
his supernatural powers were withdrawn,and he returned
to his shop, more contented than before.—'I'hisstory is
received as true by the people of Cairo; and thereforeI
have inserted it; for, in treating of superstitions, we
have more to do withopinions than with facts. I am
not sure, indeed, that it is altogether false: the sup-
posed saint might have employed persons to introduce
the dead serpent and dog into the vessels which he
broke. I am told thatmany a person has obtained the
reputation of beinga wel’ee by artifices of the kind just
mentioned.
There have been many instances,in Egypt,of wel’ees
afllictingthemselves by austeritiessimilarto thosewhich
are oflen practisedby devotees in India. At thepresent
time there is living, in Cairo, a wel’ee who has placedan
iron collar round his neck, and chained himself to a wall
of his chamber; and it is said that he has been in this
state more than thirty years: but some persons asert.
thathe has often been seen to cover himselfover witha
blanket, as if to sleep, and that the blanket has been
removed immediately after, and nobody found beneath
it! Stories of this kind are related and believed by
persons who, in many respects, are endowed with good
sense; and to laugh, or express discredit, on hearing
them, would give great olfence. I was lately told,
that, a certain wel’ee being beheaded,for a crime of
which he was not guilty, his head spoke after it was
cut off‘ ; and, of another decapitated under similar
circumstances, that his blood traced upon the ground,

“ the Thousand and one Nights.”

in Arabic characters, the following declaration of his
innocence-—“ I am a wel’ee of God; and have died a
martyr.”
It is a very remarkable trait in thecharacter of the
people of Egypt and other countries of the East, that
Moos’lims,Christians,andJews adopteachother’ssuper-
stitions, while theyabhor the more rational doctrines of
each other’s faiths. In sickness, the Moos’lim sometimes
employs Christian and Jewish priests to pray for him :
theChristians and Jews, in the same predicament,often
call in Moos’lim saints, for the like purpose. Many
Christians are in the frequent habit of visiting certain
Moos’lim saints here; kissing their hands; begging
their prayers, counsels, or prophecies; and giving them
money and otherpresents.
Though their prophet disclaimed the power of per-
forming miracles, the Moos’lims attribute to him many;
and several miracles are still, they say, constantly,or
occasionally, performed for his sake, as marks of the
divine favour and honour. The pilgrims who have
visited El-Medee’neh relate that there is seen, every
night, a ray or column of faint light, rising from the
cupola over the grave of the Prophetto a considerable
height, apparently to the clouds, or, as some say, to
Paradise; but thattheobserver loses sight of it when he
approaches very near the tomb"‘. This is one of the
most remarkable of the miracles which are related as
beingstill witnessed. On my askingone of the most
grave and sensible of all my Moos’lim friends here, who
had been on a pilgrimage, and visited El-Medee’neh,
whether thisassertion were true, he averred that it was;
‘ It is also said, that similarphenomena,but not so brilliant
distinguishsome othertombs at El-Medee’nsh and elsewhere.
302 MODERN BGYPTIANS.
thathe had seen it every night of his stay in thatcity;
and he remarked that it was a most striking and im-
pressive proof of God's favour and honour for “
our
lord Mohham’mad." I did not presume to question the
truth of what he asserted himselfto have seen ; nor to
suggest that the great number of lights kept burning
every night in the mosque might produce thiseffect;
but, to judge whether this might be the case, I asked
my friend to describe to me the construction of the
apartment of the tomb, its cupola, &c. He replied, that
he did not enter it, nor the Ka’abehat Mek'keh, partly
from hisbeingin a state ofexcessive nervous excitement
(from his veneration for those holybuildings,butpar-
ticularlyfor the former, which almost aflected him with
a kind of hysteric lit),and partlybecause,beingof the
sect of the I-lhan'afees, he held it improper, after he
should have stepped upon such sacred grormd, ever
again to nm the risk of defilinghis feet, by walking
barefooted: consequently,he would have been obliged
always to wear leather socks or mezz withinhis outer
shoes; which, he said, he could not alford to do.—The
pilgrimsalso assert, that,in approachingEl-Medee’neh,
from the distance of three days’ journey,or more, they
always see a flickeringlightning,in the direction of the
sacred city,which theybelieveto proceed fiom the Pro-
phet's tomb. They say, that, however theyturn, they
always see thislightning in the direction of El-Medee’-
neh. There is somethingstrikinglypoetical in thisand
in the former statement.
A superstitious veneration,and honours unauthorized
by the Ckoor-a'n or any of theTraditions,are paid, by
all sects of Moos’lims, excepting the Wah’ha’bees, to
deceased saints, even more thanto thosewho are living;
SAINTS. 303
and more particularly by the Moos’lims of Egypt‘.
Over the graves of most of the more celebrated saints
are erected large and handsome mosques: over thatof a
saint of less note (one who, bya life of sanctityor hypo-
crisy, has acquired the reputation of beinga wel’ee, or
devout sheykh) is constructed a small, square, white-
washed building,crownedwitha cupola. There is gene-
’
rally,directly over the vaultin which the corpse is depo-
sited, an oblong monument of stone or brick (called
turIcee’beh) or wood (in which case it is called ta’boo’t) ;
and this is usuallycovered with silkor linen, withsome
words from the Ckoor-a’n worked upon it, and sur-
rounded by a railingor screen, of wood or bronze, called
muckaodrah. Most of the sanctuaries of saints in
Egypt are tombs; but there are several which only con-
'
tain some inconsidernble relic of the person to whom
they are dedicated; and there are a few which are mere
cenotaphs. The most sacred of all these sanctuariesis
the mosque of the Hhas’aney'n, in which the head of
the martyr El-Hhosey’n, the son of the Ima’m ’Al’ee,
and grandson of the Prophet, is said to be buried.
Among others but little inferior in sanctity, are the
mosques of the sey’yideh Zey’neb (daughter of the
* Several superstitious customs, observed in the performance
of many ordinary actions, result from their extravagant respect
for their prophet, and their saints in general. For instance, on
lightingthe lamp in the evening,more particularlyat a shop, it
is customary to say,“ Commemorats Mohhamfinad, and forget
not theexcellenciesof ’Al’ee: the Fa’t'hhah for theProphet,and
for every wel’ee :” and then,to repeat the Fa’t'hhah. It is usual
to say, on first seeing the new moon, “O God favour our lord
Mohham’msd! God make thee a blessed moon (or month):"
on looking at one’s face in a glass, “O God favour our lord
Mohham’mad!”

Ima’m 'Al’ee, and granddaughterof the Prophet),the
sey'yideh Sekedneh (daughter of the Ima’m El-Hho-
sey'n),the sey’yideh Nefee'seh (great-grand-daughterof
the Ima’m El-Hhas’an), and the Ima’m Esh-Sha’fe’ee,
already mentioned as the author of one of the four
great Moos’lim sects, that to which most of the people
of Cairo belong. The buildingsabove mentioned, with
the exception of the last two, are within the metropolis:
the last but one is in a southern suburb of Cairo; and
the last, in the great southern cemetery.
The Egyptiansoccasionallyvisit these and other sanc-
tuaries oftheirsaints,eithermerelywith theview of pay-
ing honour to the deceased, and performing meritorious
acts for the sake of these venerated persons, which they
believe will call down a bleing on themselves,or for
the purpose of urging some special petition, as for the’
restoration of health,or for the gift of offspring,&c.; in
the persuuion thatthemerits of the deceased will insure
a favourable reception of the prayers which theyoffer
up in such consecrated places. The generality of the
Moos’lims regard their deceased saints as intercessors
withtheDeity; and makevotive offerings to them. The
visitor walks round the mucksoo’rah or the monument
from left to right; and recites the Fa’t’hhah, inaudibly,
or in a very low voice, before its door, or before each of
its four sides. Sometimes a longer chapter of the
Ckoor-a’n than the first (or Fa't’hhah) is recited after-
wards; and sometimes a khulnwh (or recitation of the
whole of the Ckoor-a’n) is performed on such an occa-
sion. These acts of devotion are generallyperformed
for the sake of the saint; though merit is likewise be-
lieved to reflect upon the visitor who makes a recitation.
He usually says at the close of this,“
[Assert] theabso-
s.uz\"rs. 305
lute glory of thy Lord, the Lord of Might, exempting
Him from that which they [that is, the unbelievers]
ascribe to Him” (namely, the having a son, or a par-
taker of his godhead); and adds, “ and peace be on the
Apostles; and praise be to God, the Lord of all crea-
tures. O God, I have transferred the merit of what I
have recited from the excellent Ckoor-a'n to the person
to whom this place is dedicated,” or——-“ to the soul of
thiswel’ee;” Without such a declaration,or an intention
to the same effect, the merit of therecital belongssolely
to the person who performs it. After this recital, the
visitor, if it be his desire, offers up any prayer, for tem-
poral or spiritual blessings; generallyusing some such
form as this—-“ 0 God, I conjure thee by the Prophet,
and by him to whom thisplace is dedicated, to grant me
such and such blessings:" or “
My burdens be on God
and on thee, O thou to whom thisplaceis dedicated.”
In doing this, some persons face any side of the muck-
sot/rah: but it is more proper to face the mucksoo’rah
and the ckib’leh. During the prayer, the hands are held
as in the private supplications after the ordinary prayers
of every day; and afterwards they are drawn down the
face.—Many of the visitors kiss the threshold of the
building, and the walls, windows, mucksoo'rah, &c.
The rich, and persons in easy circumstances, when they
visit the tomb of a saint, distribute money or bread to
the poor; and often give money to one or more water-
carriers to distribute water to the poor and thirsty,for the
sake of the saint. There are particular days of the week
on which certain tombs are more generallyvisited: thus,
the mosque of the Hhas’aney’nismostlyvisited, bymen,
on Tuesday, and by women, on Saturday: thatof the
sey’yideh Zey’neb, on Wednesday: thatof‘ the Ima’m
Q
306 MODERN norrrums.
Esh-Sha’fe’ee, on Friday. On these occasions, it is a
common custom for the‘male visitors to take with them
sprigs of myrtle : they place some of these on the
monument,oron thefloor within the mucksodrah; and
take back the remainder, which theydistribute to their
friends. The poor sometimes place khoa/3 (or palm-
leaves);m-Jmostpersonsdouponthetomhsoftheir
friends and relations. The women of Cairo, instead of
the myrtle or palm-leaves, often place roses, flowers of
the hhen’na-tree,jasmine,&c.
At almost every village in Egypt is thetomb of some
favourite or patron saint,’whichis generallyvisited, on a
particular day of the week, by many of the inhabitants;
chiefly women; some of whom bring thither bread,
which they leave there for poor travellers, or any other
persons. Some also place small pieces of money in
these tombs. These gifts are olferings to the sheykh;
or given for his sake. Anothercustom common among
the peasants is, to make votive sacrificesat the tombs of
their sheykhs. Forinstance, aman makes avow (nedr)
that,ifhe recover from a sickness,orobtaina son or any
other specific object of desire, he will give, to a certain
aheykh (deceased),a goat, or a lamb, or a sheep, &c. : if
he attain his object, he sacrifices the animal which he
has vowed at thetomb of the sheykh, and makes a feast
with its meat for any persons who maychoose to attend.
Having given the animal to the saint, he thus gives to
the latter the merit of feeding the poor. Little kids are
often vowed as future sacrifices; and have the right ear
alit; or are marked in some other way. It is not un-
eommon, too,withoutany definite view but thatof obtain-
ing generalblessings, to make these vows: and some-
times, a peasant vows that he will sacrifice,for the sake
SAINTS. 307
ofa saint, a calf which he ‘possesses, as soon as it is full-
grown and thtted: it is let loose, by consent of all his
neighbours, to pasture where it will, even in fields of
young wheat; and at last, afier it has been sacrificed,a
publicfeastismadewithits meat. Manyalargehull is
thus given away.
Almost every celebrated saint, deceased, is honoured‘
by an anniversary birth-day festival, which is called
moo’lz'd, or, more properly, mdlid. On the occasions
of such festivals, many persons visit thetomb,bothas a
duty and as a supposed means of obtaininga special
blessing; liclrees are hired to recite the Ckoor-a’n, for
the sake of the saint; foock’ara often perform zikrs;
and the people living in the neighbourhood of the tomb
hang lamps before their doors, and devote half the
night to such pleasures as those of smoking, sipping
eolfee, and listening to story-tellers at the coffee-shops,
or to the recitals of theCkoor-a’n, and thezikrs. I have
now a cluster of lamps hanging before my door, in ho-
nour of the modlid of a sheykh who is buried near the
house in which I am living. Even the native Christians
often hang up lamps on these occasions. The festivities
often continue several days. The most famous modlids
celebrated in Cairo,’next to thatof the Prophet,are those
ofthe Hhas’aney'nand the sey’yidehZey’neb; accounts
of which will be found in a subsequent chapter, on the
periodical public festivals, &c.'of the people of Egypt.
Most of the Egyptians not only expect a blessing to
follow their visiting the tomb of a celebrated saint, but
theyalso dread that some misfortune will befal them if
they neglect’ this act. Thus, while I am writingthese
lines, an acquaintance of mine is suffering from an ill-
ness which he attrihutes to his having neglected, for the

last two years, to attend the festivals of the sey’d
Ahh'mad El-Bed’awee, at Tnn’ta; thisbeingthe period
of one of these festivals. The tomb of thissaint attracts
almost as many visitors, at the periods of the great an-
nual festivals, from the metropolis, and from various
parts of Lower Egypt, as Mek’keh does pilgrimsfrom
the whole of the Moos’lim world. Three moo’lids are
celebrated in honour of him every year; one, about the
tenthof the Coptic month of Too’beh (17th or 18th of
January) ; thesecond,at, or about,theVernalEquinox*;
and the third, or great modlid, about a monthafter the
Summer Solstice (or about the middle of the Coptic
month of Ebee’b),when the Nile has risen consider-
ably,but the dams of the canals are not yet cut. Each
lasts one week and a day; beginningon a Friday,and
ending on the afternoon of the next Friday; and, on
each night, there is a display of fireworks. One week
after each of these, is celebrated the modlid of the seyd
Ibrahee’m Ed-Desoolckee,at the town of Desoo’ck, on
the east bank of the western branch ofitheNile. The
seyd Ibrahee’m was a very famous saint; next in rank
to the seyd El-Bed’awee. These modlids,both of the
seyd El-Bed’awee and of the seyd Ibrahee'm, are great
fairs, as well as religious festivals. At the latter, most
of. the visitors remain in theirboats; and some of the
Saadee’yeh durwee’shes of Rashee’d exhibit theirifeats
withserpents: some carryingserpents withsilver rings ’
in their mouths, to prevent their biting: others partly

at both are merely zikrs1', and recitals of the Ckoor-a’n.

—It is customary among the Moos’lims, as it was
among the Jews, to rebuild, whitewash, and decorate,
the tombs of their saints, and occasionallyto put a new
covering over the turkee’beh or ta’boo’t; and many of
them do this from the same pharisaic motives which
actuated the Jews“‘.
Dm-wee’shes are very numerous in Egypt; and some
of them who confine themselves to religious exercises,
and subsist by aims, are much respected in this country;
particularly by the lower orders. Various artitices are
employed by persons of this class to obtain the reputa-
tion of superior sanctity,and of beingendowed withthe
power of performing miracles. Many of them are re-
garded as wel'ees.
A direct descendantofAb’ooBckr,the first Kha.lee’feh,
having the title of Esh-Sheykh el-Beh’<rce, and regarded
as the representative‘of that prince, holds authorityover
all orders ofdurwee'shes in Egypt. The present Sheykh
el-Bek’ree, who is also descended from the Prophet,
is Nackee’b el-Ashra’f,or chiefof theSheree’fs.—I may
here add that the second Khalee’feh, 'Om’ar, has like-
wise his representative, who is the sheykh of the
’En’a’nee’yeh,or 0wla’d’Ena’n, an order of durwee'shes
so named from one of their celebrated sheykhs, Ibn
’Eua’n. ’0sma’nhas no representative; having left no
issue. The representative of ’Al’ee is called Sheykh es—
Sa’da’t,or Sheykh of the Sey'yids,or Sheree’fs; a title
of less importance thanthatof Nackee’b of the Sheree’fs.
Each of these three sheykhs is termed the possessor of
the seg_qa’deh (or prayer carpet) of his great ancestor.
So also the sheykh of an order of durwee'shes is called
the possessor of the segga’deh of the founder of the

order‘. The segga'deh is considered as the spiritual
throne. There are four great segga‘dehs of durwee’shes
in Egypt; which are those of four great orders about to
be mentioned.
The most celebrated orders of durwedshes in Egypt
are the following-.—1. The Rzf’a"ee’_t/eh(in the singu-
lar Rzfa”ee). This order was founded by the seyd
.Ahh’mad Rit'a”ah El-Kebee’r. Its banners, and the
turbans of its members,are black; or the latter are of a
very deep blue woollen stuff, or muslin of a very dark
greenish hue. The Rifa”ee durwedshes are celebrated
for the performance of many wonderful feats The
’Ilwa’nee’yeh,or 0wla'd ’Ilwa'n,who are a sect of the
Rifa"ees, pretend to thrust iron spikes into theireyes
and bodies without sustaining any injury; and in ap-
pearance theydo this,in such a manner as to deceive
any person who can believeit possible for a man to do
such thingsin reality. They also break large masses
of stone on their chests; eat live ooals, glass, &c.; and
are said to pass swords completelythroughtheir bodies,
and packing-needlesthroughboth their cheeks, without
suffering any pain, or leaving any wound: but such
performances are now seldom witnessed. I am told
thatit was a common practice for a durwee’sh of this
order to hollow out a piece of the trunk of a palm-tree,
till it with rags soaked with oil and tar, then set fire to
these contents, and carry the burning mass under his
arm, in a religious procession (wearingonlydrawers);
the flamescurling over his bare chest, back, and head,
and apparently doing him no injury.—TheSaadedyeh,
" The title is aa’hlieb ugga’delI.
‘I’ In most of theirjugglingperformances,the durwee’shes of
Egypt are inferiorto the most expert of the Indians.
DURWEE’sHES. 811
an order founded by the sheykh Sa’ad ed-Deen El-
Giba'wee, are another and more celebrated sect of the
Rif'a”ees. Their banners are green; and their tur-
halls, of the same colour, or of the dark hue of the
llifa”ees in general. There are many durwee’shes of
this order who handle, with impunity, live, venomous
serpents, and scorpions; and partly devour them. The
serpents, however, they render incapable of doing any
injury,by extractingtheir venomous fangs; and doubt-
leu theyalso deprive thescorpions of their poison. On
certain occasions (as, for instance, on that of thefestival
ofthebirthof theProphet),theSheykhof theSaadedyeh
rides, on horseback,over the bodies of a numberof his
durwee’shes, and other persons, who throw themselves
on the ground for the purpose; and all assert that they
are not injured by the tread of the horse *. This cere-
mony is called the dz/och. Many Rifa”ee and Ssladee
durwedshes obtain their livelihood by going about to
charm away serpents from houses. Of the feats of these
modern Psylli, an account will be given in another
chapter.—2. The Clca'd:'ree’yeh; an order founded by
thefamous seyd ’Abd El-Cka’dir El-Geela’nee. Their
banners and tnrbans are white. Most of theCka’diree'-
yeh of Egypt are fishermen: these,in religious proces-
sions, carry, upon poles, nets of various colours (green,
yellow, red, white, &c.),as the banners of their order.—
3. The Ahhmededgeb, or order of the seyd Ahh'mad
El-Bed’awee, whom I have lately mentioned. This is
a very numerous and highly respected order. Their
banners and turbans are red.—The Bei’yoo’mee!3ph

(foundedby the seyd 'Al’ee El-Beiyodmee),theSha’a-
ra’wee’yeh (founded by the sheykh Esh-Shaara'wee),
the Shirlna/wee'ych (founded by the seyd ’Al’ee Esh-
Shinna’wee), and many other orders, are sects of the
Ahhmedee’yeh. The Shin’na'wee’yeh train an an to
perform a strange part in the ceremonies of the last day
of the moo’lid of their great patron saint, the seyd
Ahh'mad El-Bed’awee, at Tun’ta: the ass, of its own
accord, enters the mosque of the seyd, proceeds to the
tomb, and there stands while multitudes crowd around
it, and each person who can approach near enough to it
plucksofsome of its hair, to use as a charm, until the
skin of the poor beastis as bare as the palm of a man’s
hand. There is another sect of the Ahhmededyeh,
called 0wla’d Noo/hh, all young men; who wear tur-
loo’rs (or high caps), with a tuft of pieces of various-
coloured cloth on the top, wooden swords, and numer-
ous strings ofbeads; and carry a l<ind‘of whip (called
_firckil'leh),a thicktwist of cords.—-4. The Bardhimdz,
or Boorha’mce’yeh: the order of the seyd Ibrahee'm
Ed-Desodckee; whose moo’lid has been mentioned
above. Their banners and turbans are green.-—There
are many other classes of durwee’shes; some of whom
are sects of one or other of the above orders. Among
the more celebrated of them are the Hhef’na’wee’yeh,
the ’Af’ee’fee’geh, the Dimurda’shee’yeIz, the NucIcsha-
ben’dee!yeh, the Bekreéyeh, and the Leysee’_1/eh.
It is impossible to become acquainted with all the
tenets, rules, and ceremonies of the durwee’shes, as
many of them,like those of the freemasons,are not to
be divulged to the uninitiated. A durwee’sh withwhom
I am acquainted thus described to me his taking the
’ahd, or initiatory covenant; which is nearly the same
DURWEI-:’SHES. 313
in all the orders. He was admitted by the sheykh of
the Dimurda'shee’yeh. Having first performed the
ablution preparatory to prayer (thewoodoo/),he seated
himself upon the ‘ground before the sheykh, who was
seated in like manner. The sheykh and he (the
mooree’d, or candidate) then clasped their right hands
togetherin the manner which I have described as prac-
tised in makingthe marriage-contract;in this attitude,
and withtheirhands covered by thesleeve of the sheykh,
the candidate took the covenant; repeating, after the
sheykh, the following words, commencing with the
form of a common oath of repentance. “ I beg for-
giveness of God,theGreat" (threetimes); “thanwhom
there is no other deity; the Living,the Everlasting: I
turn to Him with repentance, and beg his grace, and
forgiveness, and exemptionfrom the fire." The sheykh
then said to him, “Dost thou turn to God with repen-
tance ?" He replied,“I do turn to God withrepentance;
and I return unto God; and I am grieved for what I
have done [amiss], and I determine not to relapse”—
and then repeated, after the sheykh, “I beg for the
favour of God, the Great, and the noble Prophet; and
I take as my sheykh and my guide unto God (whose
name be exalted), my master ’AbdEr-Rahhee’m Ed-
Dimurda’shee El-Khal’wet’eeEr-Rifa”eeEn-Neb’awee;
not to change, nor to separate; and God is our witness:
by God, the Great!” (this oath was repeated three
times): “there is no deity but God" (this also was
repeated three times). The sheykh and the mooree’d
then recited the Fa’t’hhah together; and the latter con-
cluded the ceremony by kissing the sheykh’s hand.

sist in the repetition of zikrc. Sometimes standingin

again, until their strengthis almost exhausted; accom-
panying their ejaculationsor chants witha. motion ofthe
head, or of the whole body, or of the arms. From long
habit,theyare able to continue these exercises for a sur-
prising length of time without intermission. They are
often accompanied,at intervals, by one or more players
upon a kind of flute, called na’;y,or a double reed-pipe,
called arghoo’l,and by persons singing religious oda;
and some durwee’shes use a little drum, called bdz "‘, or
a tambourine, during their zikrs: some, also, perform a
peculiardance; the description of which, as well of
several different zikrs, I reserve for a future chapter.
Some of the rites of durwee’shes (as forms of prayer,
modes of zikr, &c.) are observed only by particular
orders: others,by membersof various orders. Among
the latter may be mentioned the rites of the Kha!’-
u'et'ees and Shdzilees; two great classes; eachof which
has its sheykh. The chiefdifferencebetween these is
that each has its particular form of prayer to repeat
every morning; and that the former distinguish them-
selves by occasional seclusion; whence their appellation
of “
Khal’wet’ees1-:” the prayer of this class is repeated
before day-break; and is called w2'1’d saIz'ar : thatof
the:Sha'zilees,which is called hhez’b esh—-Sh‘a’zilee,afier
day-break. Sometimes, a Khal’wet’ee enters a solitary

cell, and remains in it for forty days and nights, fasting
from day-break till sunset the whole of this period-
Soinetimes also a number of the same class confine
themselves, each in a separate cell, in the sepulchral
mosque of the sheykh Ed-Dimur’da’shee, on the north
of Cairo, and remain there three days and nights, on
the occasion of the moo’lid of that saint, and only eat a
little rice, and drink a cup of sherbet,in theevening:
they employ themselves in repeating certain forms of
prayer, &c. not imparted to the uninitiated; onlycoming‘
out of their cells to unite in the five dailyprayers in the
mosque; and never answering any one who speaks to
them but by saying “
There is no deitybut God.” Those
whoobserve the forty days’ fast, and seclude themselves
during thatlong period, practicenearlythe same rules;
and employtheir time in repeating the testimony of the
faith, imploring forgiveness, praising God, &c.
Almost all the durwee’shes of Egypt are tradesmen
or artisans or agricnltnrists; and only occasionallyassist
in the rites and ceremonies of their respective orders;
— but there are some who have no other occupations than
those of performing zikrsat the festivals of saints and at
private entertainments, and of chanting in funeral pro-
cessions. ‘These are termed foocllara, or faclc-ee’rs,-
which is an appellation given also to the poor in general,‘
but especiallyto poor devotees. Some obtain their live-
lihood as water-carriers,by supplying the passengers in
the streets of Cairo, and the visitors at religiousfestivals,
withwater, which they carry in an earthen vessel, or a
goat's skin, on theback. ,

saints before mentioned,by the dilck,or coat of patches,
and the stafl‘ with shreds of cloth of different colours
attached to the top: others wear fantastic dresses of
various descriptions. ’
Some Rifa”ee durwedshes (besidesthose who follow
the occupation of charming away serpents from houses)
pursue a wandering life; travelling about Egypt, and
profitingby a ridiculous superstition which I must here
mention. A venerated saint, called See Da-oo’d El-
'Az'ab (or Mmter David the Bachelor), who lived at
Tefa'hineh,avillagein Lower Egypt, had a calf, which
always attended him, broughthim water, &c. Since his
death,some R.ifa"ee durwee’shes have been in the habit
of rearing a number of calves at his native place, or
burial place, above named; teaching them to walk up
stairs, to lie down at command, &c.; and then going
about the country, each with his calf, to obtain aims.
The calf is called ’Egl El-’Az’ab (theCalf of El-'Az’ab,
or of the Bachelor). I once called into my house one
of these durwee’shes, withhis call‘; the only one I have
seen: it was a buffalo calf; and had two bells suspended
to it; one attached to a collar round its neck, and the
other, to a girth round its body. It walked up thestairs
very well; but showed that it had not been very well
trained in every respect. The ’Egl El-’Az'ab is vul-
garly believed to bring into the house a blessing from
the saint after whom it is called.
There are numerous wanderingTurkishand Persian
durwee’shes in Egypt; and to these, more than to the
few Egyptian durwee'shes who lead a similar life, must
the character for impudence and importnnacy be as-
cribed. Very often, particularlyin Rnm’ada’n, a foreign
durwee'sh goes to the mosque of the Hhas’aney’n,
DURWBWSHES. 317
whichis thatmost frequentedby theTurksand Persians,
at the time of the Friday-prayers; and, when the Kha-
tee’h is reciting the first khoot’beh, passes between the
ranks of persons who are sitting upon the floor, and
places before each a little slip of paper upon which are
written a few words, generallyexhortative to charity (as
“ He who givethalms willbeprovidedfor"—“ Thepoor
durwee’sh asketh an alms,” &c.); by which proceeding
he usually obtains from each, or almost every person, a
piece of five or ten fud’dahs, or more. Many of the
Persian durwee’shes in Egypt carry an oblong bowl
of cocoa-nut or wood or metal, in which theyreceive
their alms, and put their food; and a wooden spoon;
and most of the foreign durwee’shes wear dresses pecu-
liar to their respective orders: they are chieflydistin-
guished by the cap: the most common description of
cap is of a sugar-loaf, or conical, shape, and made of
felt: the other articles of dress are generallya vest and
full drawers,or trowsers,or a shirt and belt,and a coarse
cloak, or long coat. The Persians here all afl'ect to be

ONE of the most remarkabletraits in modern Egyptian
superstition is:the belief in written charms. The com-
position of most of these amulets is founded upon magic;
and occasionallyemploys the pen ofalmost every village
schoolmaster in Egypt. A person of thisprofession,
however, seldom pursues the studyof magic further than
to acquire the formula of a few charms,most. commonly
consisting, for the greater part, of certain passages of
the Ckoor—a’n, and names of God, togetherwiththose
of spirits, genii, prophets, or eminent saints, intermixed
withcombinationsof numerals, and withdiagrams, all
of which are supposed to have great secret virtues.
The mostesteemed of all hhega’bs (or charms) is a
moos’hhaf (or copy of the Ckoor-a’n). It used to be
the general custom of the Turks of the middle and
higher orders, and of many other Moos’lims, to wear a
small moos’hhaf in an embroidered leather or velvet
case hung upon the right side by a silkstring which
passed over the lefi shoulder: but this custom is not
now very common. During my former visit to this
country, a respectable Turk, in the military dress, was
seldom seen without a case of this description upon his
side ; though it often contained no hheg-a’b. The
moos’hhaf and other hhega'bs are still worn by many
women; generallyenclosed in cases of gold,or of giltor
CHARMS. 319
plain silver. To the former, and to many othercharms,
most extensive efiicacy is attributed: theyare esteemed
preservatives against disease, enchantment, the evil eye,
and a varietyof other evils. The charm next in point
of estimation to the moos’hhaf is a book or scroll contain-
ing certain chapters of the Ckoor-a’n ; as the 6th, 18th,
36th,44th,55th,
67th,and 78th; or some others; gene-
rally seven. —Another charm, which is believed to
protect the wearer (who usually places it withinhis cap)
from the devil, genii, and many other objects of fear, is
a piece of paper inscribed with the followingpassages
from the Ckoor-a’n*, “
And the preservation of both
[heaven and earth] is no burden unto Him. He is the
High,the Great" (chap. ii., ver. 256). “
But God is the
bestprotector ; and He is themost merciful of thosewho
show mercy
”
(chap. xii., ver. 64). “
They watch him
by the commandof God ”
(chap. xiii.,ver. 12). “ And
we guardthemfrom every devildriven awaywithstones”
(chap. xv., ver. 17). “
And a guard against every
rebellious devil" (chap. xxxvii, ver. 7). “And a guard.
Thisis the decree of the Mighty,the Wise ”
(chap. 1xi.,
ver. 11). “ And God encompasseththem behind. Verily
it is a glorious Ckoor-a'n, [written] on a preserved
tablet" (chap. lxxxv., ver. 20, 21,22).—Theninety-nine
names, or epithets, of God, comprising all the divine
attributes, iffrequentlyrepeated, and written on a paper,
and worn on the person, are supposed to make the
wearer a particular object for the exercise of all the
heneficent attributes.—In like manner it is believedthat
the ninety-nine names, or titles, &c., of the Prophet,
written upon anything,compose acharm which (accord-

ing to his own assertion, as recorded by his son-in-law
the Ima’m ’Al’ee) will, if placed in a house, and fre-
quently read from beginning to end, keep away every
misfortune, pestilence and all diseases, infirmity, the
envious eye, enchantment. burning,ruin, anxiety,grief,
and trouble. After repeating each of these names, the
Moos'lim adds, “ God favour and preserve him I ”—
Similarvirtues are ascribedto a charm composed of the
names of the As-h/m’b cl-Kahf (or Companions of the
Cave, also called the Seven Sleepers), togetherwith the
name of their dog". These names are sometimes en-
graved on theround tray of tinned copper which, placed
on a stool, forms the table for dinner, supper, &c.—
Another charm, supposed to have similar efficacy, is
composed of the names of those paltry articles of pro-
perty which the Prophet left at his decease. These
relics 1 were two seb’lthahs(or rosaries),his moo.-z’hhaf
(in unarranged fragments),his mooli-hhoolah(or the
vessel in which he kept the black powder withwhichhe
painted the edges of his eyelids), two seggddehs (or
prayer-carpets),a hand—miIl,a stall‘, a tooth-stick,a suit

three mats, a coat of mail,a long woollencoat, hiswhite

the Ckoor-a’n are also written upon slips of paper, and
worn upon the person as safeguards against various
evils, and to procure restoration to health, love and
friendship,food, &c. These andothercharms, enclosed
in cases of gold, silver,tin,leather,or silk,&c., are worn
by many of the modern Egyptians,men, women, and
children.
It is very common to see children,in this country,
witha charm against the evil eye, enclosed in a case,
generallyof a triangular form, attached to the top of
the cap; and horses oflen have similar appendages.
The Egyptians take many precautions against the evil
eye; and anxiously endeavour to avert its imagined
consequences. When a person expresses what is con-
sidered improper or envious admiration of anything,he
is generally reproved by the individual whom he has
thus alarmed,who says to him, “ BlesstheProphet‘I ”;
and if the envier obeys, saying, “O God, favour
him-|-!", no ill effects are apprehended. It is consi-
dered very improper for a person to express his admira-
tion of another, or of any object which is not his own

The Prophet’: is described as about seven feet and a half in
length,and four and a half in width. It was used by him, as
boor’dehs are at present, both to envelopthe body by day and II
3 night-covering. I may be excused for remarking here (as it
seems to be unknown to some Arabic scholars) that the terms
aklfldarand alch’mar,which are appliedby different historians to
the Prophet's boor’deh, are used to signify respectively grey and
brown, as well as green and red.

property. by -ring “God preserve -I"-” “How
pretty!” or, “Very pretty!”: the most appoved ex-
pression in such cases is “Md aha-lldhl”(or “God's
will!”); which implies both adniation,and submis-
sionto,orapprovalof,thewillof God. Apersonwho
has esehined “ How pretty! ", or used similar words,
isotten desired to say,rather,“ Ma’ aha-lh’h!” as well
as to bless the Prophet. In the second chapter of this
work,a remarkable illustration has been given of the
fear which mothers in Egypt entertain of the effect of
the evil eye upon their children. It is the custom in
thiscountry, when a person takes the child of another
intohisarms,to say, “Inthenameof God,the Com-
passionate, the Merciful!” and, “O God, favour our
lu1lMohham’mad! ”; and then toadd, “Md sha-lla’h! "
It is also a common custom of the people ofEgypt,
when admiring a child, to say, “
I seek refuge withthe
Lord of the Day-break for thee!” alluding to the
Chapter of the Day-break (the 113th chapter of the
Ckoor-a’n); in the end of which, protection is im-
plored agaiust the mischief of the envious. The
parents, when they see a person stare at, or seem to
envy, their young offspring’,sometimes cut ot? a piece
of the skirts of his blothes,burn it with a little salt
(to which some add coriander-seed, alumn, &c.), and
fumig-ate with the smoke, and sprinkle with the ashes,
the child or children. This, it is said, should be
done a little before sunset; when the sun becomes

ner, by the people of Egypt, to counteract the effects of »
the evil eye. A piece of about the size of a walnut is
placedupon burning coals, and lefi until it has ceased
to bubble. This should be done a short time before
sunset; and the person who performs the operation
should repeat three times, while the alumn is burning,
the first chapter of the Ckoor-a’n, and the last three
chapters of the same; all of which are very short. On
taking the alumn off the fire, it will be found (we are
told) to have assumed the form of the person whose
envy or malice has given occasion for this process : it is
thento be pounded; put into some food; and given to
a black dog, to be eaten. I have once seen thisdone,
by a man who suspected his wife of having looked
upon him with an evileye; and in thiscase, the alumn
did assume a form much resembling that of a woman,
in what the man declared was a peculiar posture in
which his wife was accustomed to sit. But the shape
which the alumn takes depends almost entirely upon the
disposition of the coals; and can hardlybe such that
the imaginationmay not see in it some resemblance to
a human being.—Anothersupposed mode of obviating
the effects of the envious eye is, to prick a paper with a
needle, saying, at the same time, “This is the eye of
such a one, the envier;” and then to burn the paper.-
Alnmn is esteemed a very valuable charm against the
evil eye: sometimes, a small,flat piece of it, ornamented
with tassels, is hung to the top of a child’s cap. A
tassel of little shells and heads is also used in the same
manner, and for the same purpose. The small shells
called cowries are considered preservatives against the
evil eye; and hence, as well as for the sake of orna-
ment, theyare often attached to the trappings of camels,
324 MODERN EGYPTIANS.
horses, and otheranimals, and sometimes to the caps of
children‘.
To counteract the efl'ects of the evil eye, many per-
sons in Egypt, but mostly women, make use of what is
called meg/‘alt mooba’raltaII (orblessed storax),which is
a mixture of various ingredients thatwill be mentioned
below,prepared and sold onlyduringthefirst ten days of
the monthof Mohhar’ram. During this period,we often
see, in the streets of Cairo,men carryingabout this mix-
ture of mey”ah,&c. for sale; and generallycrying some
such words as the following—“Mey"ah moobakakah !
A new year and blessed ’A’shoo’ra-f! The most
blessed of years [may this be] to the believers! Ya’
mey”ah mooba'rakah!"—The man who sells it bears
upon his head a round tray, covered with different-cw
loured sheets of paper, red, yellow, &c. ; upon which is
placed the valuable mixture. In the middle is a large
heap of lg‘/2 (or refuse) of a dark reddish material for
dying,mixed with a littlemeg/’ah(or storax), coriander-
seed 1, and seed of the fennel~flower§: round thislarge
heap are smaller heaps; one consisting of salt dyed
blue with indigo ; another, of salt dyed red; a third, of
salt dyed yellow ; a fourth, of sheehh (akind of worm-
wood); a fifth, of dust of liba/n (or frankincense).
These are all the ingredients of the “Mey”ah mooba’-
rakah." The seller is generallycalled into the house of
the purchaser. Having placedhis tray before him, and
received a plate, or a piece of paper, in which to put the
" Such appendages are evidentlymeant to attract the eye to
themselves,and so to prevent observation and envy of the object
which theyare designed to protect.

quantity to be purchased, he takes a little from one
heap, then from another, then from a third, and so on,
until he has taken some from each heap; after which,
again and again, he takes an additional quantity from
each kind. While he does this,he chants a long spell,
generally commencing thus-—-“In the name of God!
and by God! There is no conqueror that conquereth
God, the Lord of the East and theWest: we are all his
servants: we must acknowledge his unity: his unity is
an illustriousattribute.” After some words on the vir-
tues of salt, he proceeds to say—“ I charm thee from
the eye of girl, sharper than a spike; and from the eye
ofwoman, sharper than a pruning-knife; and from the
eye of boy,more painful thana whip ; and from theeye
of man, sharper than a chopping-knife;" and so on.
Then he relates how Solomon deprived the evil eye of
its influence; and afterwards enumerates every article
of property thatthe house is likelyto contain, and that
the person who purchases his wonderful mixture may
be conjectured to possess; all of which he charms
against the influence of the eye. Many of the ex-
pressions which he employs in this spell are very ridi-
culous: words beingintroduced merely for the sake of
rhyme.—Themey”ah mooba’ralrah, a handful of which
may be purchased for five fud’dahs*, is treasured up by
the purchaser during the ensuing year; and whenever
it is feared thata child or otherperson is affected by the
evil eye, a little of it is thrownupon some burningcoals
in a chafing-dish; and the smoke which results is gene-
rally made to ascend upon the supposed sutferer.

deliers in the street before thebridegroom’shouse; and
itofien happens theta crowdiscollected toseeavery
large and handsome chandelier suspended: in this
case, it is a common practice to divert the attention of
thespectators by throwingclown and breaking a large
jar, or by some other artifice,lest an envious eye should
cause the chandelier to fall. Accidents which confirm
theEgyptians in their superstitions respecting the evil
eye often occur: for instance, a friend of mine has just
relatedto me, that,a shorttime ago,he saw a camel
carrying two very large jars of oil: a woman stopped
before it, and exclaimed “ God preserve us! What
largejars!”—the conductor of the camel did not tell
her to bless the Prophet; and the camel, a few minutes
alter, fell, and broke both the jars, and one of its own
legs.
Whilewriting thesenotes on modern Egyptian super-
stitions, I have been amused by a complaint of one of
my Mus’ree * friends, which will serve to illustrate
what I have just stated.——“ The Ba’sha,” he said,
“
having,a few days ago, given up his monopolyof the
meat, the butchers now slaughterfor their own shops;
and it is quite shocking to see fine sheep hung up in ,
the streets, quite whole, tail1' and all, before the public
eye; so thatevery beggarwho passes by envies them;
and one might, therefore, as well eat poison as such
rneat.”—Mycook has made the same complaint to me;
and, rather than purchase from one of the shops near at
hand, takes the trouble of going to one in a distant
quarter, kept by a man who conceals his meat from the
view of the passengers in the street.

Many of the tradesmen of the metropolis and oflla
towns of Egypt, place over their shops (generallyupon
thehanging shutter which is turned up in front) a paper
inscribedwiththe name of God, or thatof the Prophet,
or both, or the profession of the faith(“Thereis no
deity but God: Mohham’mad is God's Apostle”),the
bismillah(“In the name of God, the Compassionde,
the Merciful"), or some maxim of the Prophet, or a
verse ofthe Ckoor-a’n (as, “

[ch. xlviii., ver. 1], and “

tidings to the true believers" [ch. lxi.,ver. l3]),or an
invocation to the deity, such as, “Oh thouopener [of
the doors of prosperity,or subsistence] ! 0 thou wise!

This invocation is oflen pronounced by the tradesman
when he first opens his shop in the morning,and by
thepedestrianrender of small commodities,bread,vege-
tables, &c., when he sets out on his dailyrounds. It
is a custom among the lower orders to put the first
piece of money that they receive in the day to the lips
and forehead before putting it in the pocket.
Besides the inscriptions over shops, we ofien see; in
Cairo, the invocation “O God-fl” sculptured over the
door of a private house; and thewords “The Creator

lasting," painted in large characters upon the door,

The most approved mode of charming away sickness
or disease is to write certain passages of the Ckoor-a'n '
(m the inner surface of an earthenware cup or bowl;
then to pour in some water, and stir it until the writing
is quite washed off; when the water, with the sacred
words thus infused in it, is to be drunk by the patient.
These words are as follow: “ And he will heal the
breasts of the people who believe" (chap. ix., ver. 14).
“ 0 men, now hath an admonition come unto you from
your Lord; and a remedy for what is in your breasts"
(chap. x., ver. 58). “ Wherein is a remedy for men”
(chap.xvi., ver. 71). “ We send down,oftheCkoor-a.'n,
that which is a remedy and mercy to the believers”
(chap. xvii., ver. 84). “
And when I am sick he healeth
me" (chap. xxii.,ver. 80). “
Say, it is, to thosewho be-
lieve, a guide and a remedy" (chap. xli., ver. 44). Four

I silenced his scruples on the

-we had an English translation of the whole of the

he broke in halves one of the threecakes; and we each
ate our share. I agreed with him (thoughI had read
the inscription) that it was delicious; and I gladly
accepted his presents.—I was afierwards enabled to
make several additions V
to my Mek’keh curiosities;
comprising a piece of the covering of the Ka’abeh,
brought from Mek’keh bythesheykh Ibrahee’m(Burck-
hardt), and given to me by his legatee 'Osma’n.—-A
cake composed of dust from the Prophet’s tomb is
sometimes sewed up in a leather case, and worn as an
amulet. It is also formed into lumps of the shape of a
pear, and of the size of a small pear; and hung to the
railing or screen which surrounds the monument over
the grave of a saint, or to the monument itself, or to
the windows or door of the apartment which contains it.
So numerous are the charms which the Egyptians
employ to insure good fortune, or to prevent or remove
evils of every kind, and so various are the superstitious
practices to which they have recourse with‘these views,
that a large volume would scarcely suflice to describe
themin detail. These modes of endeavouringto obtain
good, andto avoid or dispel evil, when they are not
founded upon religion or magic or astrology,are termed
matters of ’ilm er-rook’IceIz, or the science of the distafl’
(thatis, of the women); which designation is given to
imply their absurdity,and becausewomen are the per-
sons who most confide in them. This term is con-
sidered, by some, as a vulgar corruption of “’ilm er-
roock’yeh,” or “
the science of enchautmentz” by
others,it is supposed to be substituted for the latter term
by way of a pun. Some practices of the nature just

described have already been incidentallymentioned: I
shall only give a few other specimens.
It is a very common custom in Cairo to hang an
aloe-plant over the door of a house; particularly over
that of a new house, or over a door newlybuilt: and
this is regarded as a charm to insure long and flourish-
ing lives to the inmates. and long continuance to the
house itself‘L The women also believe that the Pro-
phet visits the house where this plant is suspended.
The aloe, thus hung, withoutearth or water, will live for
several years; and even blossom.
When any evil is apprehended from a person, it is
customary to break a piece of pottery behindhis back.
This is also done with the view of preventing further
intercourse withsuch a person.
As ophthalmia is very prevalent in Egypt. the igno-
rant people of this country resort to many ridiculous
practicesof a supersitious nature for its cure. Some, for
this purpose, take a piece of dried mud, from the bank
of the Nile at or near Boo'la’ck,the principal port of
Cairo, and, crossing the river, deposit it on the opposite
bank, at Imba’beh. This is considered sufficient to
insure a cnre.—0thers,with the same view, hang to
the head-dress, over the forehead, or over the diseased
eye, a Venetian sequin 3?; but it must be one of a par~
ticular description, in which the figures on each side
correspond. head to head, and feet to feet 1. Yet if a

a
pocket, enter the room of one who is suffering from‘
ophthalmia or fever, his presence is thoughtto aggra-
vate the complaint. It also is a general belief,here,
that,if an individual in a state of religious uncleanness
enter a room in which is a person afflictedwith ophthal-
mia, the patient's disease will consequently be aggra-
vated, and that a speck will appear in one or each of his
eyes. A man withwhom I am acquainted has, at the
time I write this,just come out of a room in which he
had confined himself, while snlfering from ophthulmia,
for about three months,from this fear; never allowing
any person to enter; his servant always placing his
food outside his door: he has, however, come out with
a speck in one ofhis eyes.
Anotherpractice.which is often adopted in similar
cases, but mostly by women, and frequently with the
view of preventing barrenness, is very singular and dis-
gusting. The large open place called the Roomey’leh,
on the west of the Citadel of Cairo, is a common scene
of the execution of criminals; and the decapitation of
persons convicted of capital offences in the metropolis
was formerlyalmost alwaysperformed there, rather than
in any other part of the town. On the south of this
place is a building called Mugh'sile.r-Soolla.'n, or the
Soolta’n's washing-place for the dead; where is a table
of stone, upon which the body of every person who is
decapitated is washed,previouslyto its burial; and there
is a trough to receive the water, which is never poured
out, but remains tainted with the blood, and fetid.
Many a woman goes thither, and, for the cure of
ophthalmia, or to obtain offspring, or to expedite de-
livery in the case of a protracted pregnancy, without
speaking (for __silence is deemed absolutely necessary),
384 MODERN IGYPTIANS.
pmses under the stone table above mentioned,with the
left foot foremost,and thenover it; and does thisseven
times; afierwhich,she washesher facewith the polluted
water that is in the trough, and gives five or ten find’-
dnhs to an old man and his wife, who keep the place;
then goes away, still without speaking. Men, in the
case of ophthalmic,ofien do the same. The Mug-h’sil
is said to have been built by thefamous Beybur’s,before
he became Soolts’n; in consequence of his observing
that the remains of persons decapitated in Cairo were
often kicked about, and buried withoutbeingpreviously
washed. '
Some women step over the body of a decapitated
man seven times, without speaking, to become preg-
nant; and some, with the same desire, dip, in tlie
blood, a piece of cotton wool, of which they atterwards
make use in a manner I must decline mentioning.
A ridiculous ceremony is practised for the cure of s
pimpleon the edge of theeye-lid,or what we commonly
call a “sty,” and which is termed in Egypt shah]!-
khdtch; a word which literally signifies “a female
beggar." The person stfected withit goes to any seven
women of the name of Fa’t’meh, in seven dilferent
houses, and begs, from each of them,a morsel of bread:
these seven morsels constitute the remedy.—SometiInes,
in a. similar cnse,and for the same purpose, aperson
goes out before sunrise, and, without speaking, walks
round several tombs, from right to lefi, which is the
reverse of the regular course made in visiting tombs.—
Anothersupposed mode of cure in a case of the same
kind is, to binda bit of cotton on theend of a stick;
then to dip it in one of the troughs out of which the
dogs drink in the streets of Cairo, and to wipe the eye
CHARMS. 335
with it. The patient is thus careful to preserve his
hand from the polluted water, when he is about to
apply this to anotherpart of his person.
‘
As an imaginarycure for ague, some of the women
of Egypt (I mean those of the Moos’lirn,faith)hang to
their necks the finger of a. Christian or Jew, cut oil‘a
corpse, and dried. This and otherpracticesmentioned
before are striking proofs of the degrading effects of
superstition,and of its powerfulinfluenceover the mind:
for, in general, the Moos’lims are scrupulously careful
to conform with that precept ot' their religion which
requires them to abstain from everything polluting or
unclean.
When a child is unable to walk. afier having obtained
the age when it is usual to begin to do so, it is a com-
mon custom for the mother to bind its feet together
with apalrn-leaf tied in three knots, and to place it at
thedoor of a mosque duringthe periodwhen the congre-
gation are engaged in performing the Friday~prayers:
when the prayers are ended, she asks the first, second,
and third persons who come out of the mosque to untie
each a knot of the palm-leaf; and then carries the child
home, confident that this ceremony will soon have the
effect of enablingthe little-one to walk.
There are several pretended antidotes for poison, and
remedies for certain diseases, to which the Egyptians
often have recourse, and which may perhaps have some
etlicacy: but superstition attributes to them incredible
virtues. The bezoar-stone‘ is used as an antidote for
poison, by rubbing it in a cup witha little water: the
cup is then filledwith water, which the patient drinks.
In the same manner, and for the same purpose, a cup

made of the horn ofthe rhinoceros‘ is used: a piece of
the same material (the horn) is rubbed in it.—As a
cure for thejaundice,many persons in Cairo drink the
water of a well in this city, called beer cl-yarackdn,or
“
the well of thejaundice.” It is the property of an old
woman, who reaps considerable advantage from it :
for it has two mouths, under one of which is a dry
receptaclefor anythingthatmay be thrown down; and
the old woman desires thepersons who come to use the
medicinal water to drop through this month whatever
‘
she happens to be in need of; as sugar, coffee, &c.
The Moos’lims have recourse to many superstitious
practicesto determine them when theyare in doubt as
to any action which they contemplate, whether they
shall do it or not. Some apply, for an answer, to a
table called a za’i:’gch. There is a table of this kind
ascribed to Idree’s, or Enoch. It is divided into a
hundred little squares; in each of which is written some
Arabic letter. The person who consults it repeats,
three times, the opening chapter of the Ckoor-a'n, and-
the 58thverse of theSoo’rat el-An’a’m (or 6th chapter)
-—“ With Him are the keys of the secret things: none
knoweth them but Him: He knowethwhatever is on
the dry ground or in the sea: there fallethno leaf but
He knoweth it; neither is there a single grain in the
dark parts of the earth, nor a green thing nor a dry
thing,but it is [written] in a perspicuous book.”—Hav-
ing done this,without looking directly at the table, he
places his finger upon it: he then looks to see upon
what letter his finger is placed; writes that letter; the
fifth following it; the fifth following this; and so on,
until he comes again to the first which he wrote; and
" Ckur’n Mmr!e:’!.

theseletterstogethercomposetheanswer. Theconstruc-
tion of the table may be shown by translatingit, thus—-
For an example, suppose the finger to be placed on the
letter e in the sixth line: we take, from the table, the
letters e nj 0 y p e a c e abstaz'nand,which
compose this sentence “
Abstain, and enjoy peace :” the’
sentence always commencingwith the first of the letters
taken from the uppermost line. It will be seen that
the table gives only five answers; and that, if we pro-
ceed as above directed, we must obtain one of these
answers, with whatever letter of the table we com-
mence. It will also be observed, that the framer of the
table, knowingthatmen very frequentlywish to do what
is wrong, and seldom to do what is right, and that it is
generally safer for them to abstain when in doubt, has
given but one affirmative answer, and four negative'.
"' The more approved za"i'r’gehs are extremely complicated;
and the process of consulting theminvolves intricate astrological
calculations.

Some persons have recourse to the Ckoor-a’n for an
answer to their doubts. This they call making an
ictikhdrah, or application for the favour of heaven.
Repeating,three times, the opening chapter, the 112th
chapter, and the verse above quoted, theylet the book
fall open, or open it at random, and, from the seventh
line of the right-hand page, draw their answer. The
words often will not convey adirect answer; but are
taken as atiirmative or negative according as their
general tenor is good or bad; promising a blessing,
or denouncing a threat, &c. Instead of reading the
seventhline of this page, some count the numberofthe
letters kha and sheen which occur in the whole page;
and if thekhaa predominate,theinference is favourable:
kha represents lcheyr, or good : sheen, shurr, or evil.
There is another mode of istikha’r:ah; which is, to
take hold of any twopoints of a seb'hhah (or rosary),
after reciting the Fa’t’hhah three times, and then to
count the beads between these two points, saying, in
passing the first head through the fingers, “
[I assert]
the absolute glory of God ;” in passing the second,
“ Praise be to God ;” in passing the third, “There is
no deity but God;” and repeating these expressions in
the same order, to the last head : if the first expression
fall to the last bead,theanswer is afiirmativeand favour-
able: if the second. indifferent: if the last, negative.
This is practisedby many persons.
Some, again, in similarcases, on lyingdown to sleep,
at night, beg of God to direct them by a dream; by
causingthem to see somethingwhite or green, or water,
if the action which they contemplate be approved, or if
they are to expect approaching good fortune; and if
not, by causing them to see somethingblackor red, or
AUGURATION. 339
lire: they then recite the Fa’t’hhah ten times; and
continue to repeat these words—“ 0 God, favour our
lord Mohham’mad!”—-untiltheyfall asleep.
The Egyptians place great faith in dreams, which
often direct them in some of the most important actions
of life. They have two large and celebrated works on
the interpretation of dreams, by Ib/n Sha’hee’n and Ib’n
Seeree’n ; thelatter of whom was thepupilof theformer.
These books are consulted, even by the learned, with
implicit confidence. When one person says to another,
“'I have seen a dream,” the latter usually answers,
“ Good“” (i. e. may it be of good omen). or, “
Good,
please God 1.” When a person has had an evildream,
it is customary for him to say, “ O God favour our lord
Mohham’mad!” and to spit over his left shoulder three
times, to prevent an evil result.
In Egypt, as in most other countries, superstitions
are entertained respectingdays of theweek; some being
considered fortunate; and others, unfortunate.-The
Egyptians regard Sunday as an u/nfortmmte day, on
account of the night which follows it.—This night,
which (according to the system already mentioned) is
called the night of Monday,the learned Moos’lims, and
many of the inferior classes, consider unfbrtunate, be-
cause it was that of the death of their Prophet; but
some regard it as fortunate, particularlyfor the con-
summation of marriage; though not so auspicious for
this affair as the eve of Friday. The day following it is
also considered, by some, as fortunate ; and by others,
as unfortunate.—Tuesday is generally thought unfor-
tunate, and called “ the day of blood ;" as it is said that
several eminent martyrs were put to death on this day:
' K/It r. 1* Kine rin aha-l’la’lz.
.'I .7
340 MODERN sorrruxs.
and hence, also, it is commonlyesteemed a proper day
for beingbled.—Wedne:dayis regarded as indgferent.
—Thuraday is called cl-mooba'raIc (or the blessed);
and is consideredfortunate; particularlyderivinga bles-
sing from the following night and day.-—The eve, or
night, of Friday is veryfortunate; especially for the
consummationof marriage. Fridayis blessed above all
other days‘ as being the sabbathof the Moos’lims: it is
called cl-fadedleh (or the excellent).—Saturday is the
moat unfortunateof days. It is considered very wrong
to commence a journey,and, by most people in Egypt,
to shave,or cut the nails,on thisday.—Afriend of mine
here was doubting whether he should bring an action.
against two persons on so unfortunate a day as Satur-
day: he decided, at last, thatit was the best day of the
week for him to do this,as the ill fortune must fall upon
one of the two parties only, and doubtless upon his
adversaries, because they were two to one.—There are
some days of the year which are esteemed very fortu-
nate; as those of the two grand festivals, &c.; and
some which are regarded as unfortunate; as, for in-
stance, the last Wednesday in the month of Suf'ar;
when many persons make a point of not going out of
their houses, from the‘beliefthat numerous afllictions
fall upon mankind on that day.—Some persons draw
lucky or unluckyomens from the first object theysee
on going out of the house in the morning: according
as that object is pleasant or the reverse, theysay, “
our
morning is good” or “— bad.”

CHAPTER XII.
MAGIC, ASTROLOGY, AND ALCHYIIY.
III we might believesome stories which are‘ commonly
related in Egypt, it would appear that,in modern days,
there have been, in this country, magicians not less
skilful than Pharoah’s “wise men and sorcerers” of
whom we read in the Bible.
The more intelligentof theMoos'limsdistinguish two
kinds of magic,which theyterm Er-Rodhha/nee(vulgo.
Row’/IJza’nee) and Es-Sedmiya: the former is spiritual
magic, which is believed to effect its wonders by the
agency of angels and genii, and by the mysterious
virtues of certain names of God, and other supernatural
means: the latter is natural and deceptive magic; and
its chief agents, the less credulous Moos'limsbelieve to
be certain perfumes and drugs, which affect the vision
and imagination in a manner somewhat similar to
opium: this drug, indeed, is supposed, by some per-
sons, to be employed. in the operations of the latter
branch of magic.
Er-Roo’hha’nee, which is universally considered,
among the Egyptians, as true magic, is of two kinds,
’il'wee (or high) and soof’lee (or low) ; which are also
called rahhmdnee (or divine, or, literally, relating to
“the Compassionate,”which is an epithetof God) and
sheytdnee (or satanic). The ’il’wee, or rahhma’nee, is
said to be a science founded on the agency of God, and
342 MODERN EGYPT!ANS.
of his angels, and good genii, and on other lawful mys-
teries; to be always employed for good purposes, and
only attained and practisedby men of probity,who, by
tradition, or from books,learn the names of those super-
human agents,and invomtions which insure compliance
with their desires. The writing of charms for good
purposes belongsto thisbranch of magic, and to astro-
logy, and to the science of the mysteries of numbers.
The highest attainment in divine magic consists in the
knowledge of the Iam cl-A’azavn. This is “
the most.
great name” of God, which is generallybelieved,by the
learned, to be known to none but prophets and apostles
of God. A person acquainted with it an, it is said, by
merelyuttering it, raise the dead to life, kill theliving,
transport himselfinstantlywherever he pleases, and per-
form any other miracle. Some suppose it to be known
to eminent wel’ees.—The soof'leeis believedto depend
on the agency of the devil,and evil spirits, and unbe-
lievinggenii; and to be used for bad purposes, and by
bad men. To thisbranch belong the science called,
by the Arabs, es—sehhr ; which is a term theygive only
to wicked enchantrnent.—Those who perform what is
called durb el-men’dd (of which I purpose to relate
some examples) profess to do it by the agency of genii;
thatis, by the science called er-roo/hha’nee: but there
is another opinion on thissubjectwhichwillbe presently
mentioned.
E:-Se:/miyais generallypronounced,by the learned,
to be a false science, and deceptive art, which produces
surprising etfects by those natural means which have
been above mentioned ; and the durb el~men’del, as
perfumes are emplyed in the performance of it, is con-
sidered, by such persons, as pertaining to es-see’miya.
MAGIC, &c. 348
’Ilmen-Noogodm, or Astrology,is studied by many
persons in Egypt. It is chiefly employed in casting
nativities, in determining fortunate periods, &c.; and
very commonly,to divine by what sign of the zodiaca
person is influenced; which is usually done by a calm-
lation founded upon the numerical values of the letters
composing his or her name, and that of the mother:
this is often done in the case of two persons who con-
template becoming man and wife, with the view of
mcertaining whether they will agree.—The science
called durb er-reml, or geomancy,by which, from cer-
tain marks made at random on paper, or on sand
(whence its name),the professors pretend to discover
past, passing, and future events, is, I am informed,
mainlyfounded on astrology.
El-Kedmiya,or Alchymy, is also studied by many
persons in Egypt, and by some possessed of talents by
which they might obtain a better reputation than this
pursuit procures them, and who, in spite of the derision
which theyexperiencefrom a few men of sounder minds,
and the reproachesof those whom theyunintentionally
make their dupes, continue, to old age, their fruitless
labours. Considerable knowledge of Chymistry is,
however, sometimes acquired in -the study of this false
science; and in the present degraded state of physical
knowledge in this country, it rather evinces a superior
mind when a person gives his attention to alchymy.
There is, or was (forI am informed thathe died a few
weeks ago), a native of Egypt very highly celebrated
for his performances in the higher kind of thatbranch
of magic called er-roo/hhsfnee; the sheykh Isma’ee'l
Ab’oo Roo-oo's, of the town of Desoo/ck. Even the
more learned and sober of the people of this country

handwritingwhich, he said, he could have sworn to be
that of his father, a complete answer to what he had
written, and an account of the state of his familywhich.
he proved, on his return to Cairo, a few days afu-.r,_.to
be perfectly true. _
A curious case of magic fell under the cognizanceof
the governmentduring my former visit to this country;
and became a subject of general talk and wonder
throughout the metropolis. I shall give the story of
this occurrence, precisely as it was related to me by
several persons in Cairo ; withoutcurtailing it of any of
the exaggerationswithwhich they embellished it; not
onlybecauseI am ignorant how far it is true, but be-
cause I would show how great a degree of faith the
Egyptians in general place in magic, or enchantrnent.
Moos'tuf’a Ed-Dig’wee, chief secretary in the Clan’-
dee’s court, in this city, was dismissed from his oflice,
and succeeded by anotherperson of the name of Moos’-
tuf’a, who had been a. sey’refee, or money-changer.
The former sent a petition to the Ba’sha, begging to be
reinstated; but before he received an answer, he was
attackedby a severe illness,which he believedto be the
etfect of enchantment: he persuaded himself that
Moos’tuf’a the sey’rel'ee had employed a magician to
write a spell which should cause him to die; and there.-
fore sent a second time to the Ba’sha, charging thenew
secretary with this crime. The accused was hrought
beforethe Ba’sha; confessed that he had done so; and.
named the magician whom he had employed. The
latter was arrested; and, not being able to deny the
charge brought against him, was thrown into prison,
there to remain until it should be seen whether or not
346 MODERN BGYPTIANS.
Ed-Dig’wee would die. He was locked up in a. small
cell; and two soldiers were placed at the door; that
one of them might keep watch wfile the otherslept.
Now ibr the marvellous part of the story. At night,
aflerone of theguards had fallen uleep, the otherheard
a strange, murmuring noise, and, looking through a.
crackof the door of the cell, saw the magiciansitting
in the middleof the floor, muttering some words which
he (theguard) could not understand. Presently, the
candle which was before him became extinguished;
and, at the same instant, four other candles appeared ;
one in each corner of the cell. The magician then
rose, and, standingon one side of thecell, knocked his
forehead three times against the wall; and each time
thathe did so, the wall opened.and a man appeared to
come forth from it. After the magician had conversed
for some minutes with the three personages whom he
thus produced, they disappeared; as did, also, the four
candles; and the candle that was in the midstof the
cell became lighted again, as at first: the magicianthen
resumed his position on the floor; and all was quiet.
Thus thespell that was to have killed Ed-Digwee wu
dissolved. Early the next morning,the invalid felt him-
self so much better, thathe called for a basin and ewer,
performed the ablation, and said his prayers; and from
that time he rapidly recovered. He was restored to
his former oflice; and the magician was banished from
Egypt.—Another enchanter (or .rahh'hlza’r) was
banished a few days afier, for writing a charm which
caused a Mohhammsdan girl to be affected with an
irresistible love for a Copt Christian.
A few days after my first arrival in this country, my
curiosity was excited on the subject of magic by a cir-
MAGIC. 347
cumstance related to me by Mr. Salt, our consul-gene-
val. Havinghad reason to believethat one of his ur-
vants was a thief, from the fact of several articlesaf
property havingbeen stolen from his house, he sent for
a celebrated Mugh’reHee magician, with the View of in-
timidating them,and causingthe guiltyone (if any of
them were guilty)to confess his crime. The magician
came; and said thathe would cause the exact image of
the person who had committed the thefts to appear to
any youth not arrived at the age of puberty; and de-
sired the master of the house to call in any boy whom
he might choose. As several boys were then employed
in a garden adjacent to the house, one of them was
called for this purpose. In the pa.lm of thisboy’sright
hand, the magician drew, with a pen, a certain diagram,
in the centre of which he poured a little ink. Into this
ink, he desired the boy stedfastly to look. He then
burned some incense and several bitsof paper inscribed
with charms; and, at the same time, called for various
objects to appear in the ink. The boy declared thathe
saw all these objects, and, last of all, the image of the
guilty person: he described his stature, countenance,
and dress; said that he knew him; and directly ran
down into the garden, and apprehended one of the
labourers, who, when brought before the master, imme-
diately confessed that he was the thief.
The above relation made me desirous of witnessing as
similar performance during my first visit to thiscoun-
try; but not being acquainted with the name of the
magician here alluded to, or his place of abode, I was
unable to obtain any tidings of him. I learned, how-
ever, soon after my return to England,that he had be-
come known to later travellers in Egypt; was residing
343 MODERN EGYPTIANS.
in Cairo; and thathe was called the sheykh ’AbdEl-
Cka'dir El-Mugh’reh/fee. A few weeks after my second
arrival in Egypt, my neighbour ’Osma’n,interpreter of
the British consulate, broughthim to me; and I fixed
a day for his visiting me, to give me a proof of the skill
for which he is so much famed. He came at the time
appointed, about two hours before noon; but seemed
uneasy; frequently looked up at the sky, through the
window; and remarked that the weather was unpro-
pitious: it was dull and cloudy; and the wind was
boisterous. The experimentwas performed with three
boys; one after another. With the first, it was partly
successful; but with the others, it completely failed.
The magiciansaid that he could do nothingmore that
day; and that he would come in the evening of a sub»-
sequent day. He kept his appointment; and admitted
that the time was favourable. While waiting for my
neighbour, before mentioned, to come and witness the
performances, we took pipes and coffee; and the magi-
cian chatted withme on indifferent subjects. He is a.
fine, tall, and stout man, of a. ratherfair complexion,
with a dark bmwn beard; is shabbily dressed; and
generallywears a large green turban; beinga descend-
ant of the prophet. In his conversation, he is afi‘able
and unaffected. He professed to me that his wonders
were effected by the agency of good spirits; but to
others,he has said the reverse: thathis magicis satanic.
In preparing for the experimentof the magic mirror
of ink, which, with some otherperformancesof a similar
nature, are here termed durb el-men’del, the magician
first asked me for a reed-pen and ink, a piece of paper,
and a pair of scissors; and, having cut off a narrow
strip of paper, wrote upon it certain forms of invocation,
MAGIC. 849
together with anothercharm, by which he professes to
accomplish the object of the experiment. He did not
attempt to conceal these; and on my asking him to
give me copies of them, he readilyconsented, and im-
mediatelywrote themfor me; explaining to me, at the
same time, that the object he had in view was accom-
plished through the influenceof the two first words,
'
“Tm’shoon" and “
Turyoo’shoon,” which, he said,
were the names of two genii, his “ familiarspirits.” I
compared the copies with the originals; and found that
they exactly agreed. Fac~similes of them are here
inserted, with a translation.

“ And this is the removal. ‘ And we have removed
from thee ’
thyveil; and thysight to-day
is piercing.’ Correct. correct.”
Having written these, the magician cut oil‘ the paper
containing the forms of invocation from that upon
which the other charm was written; and cut the former
into six strips. He then explained to me that the ob-
ject of the latter charm (which contains part of the21st
verse of the Soo’rat Cka’f, or 50th chapter of the
Ckoor—a'n) was to open the boy's eyes in a supernatural
manner; to make his sight pierce into what is to us the
invisible world.
I had prepared, by the magician’s direction, some
frankincense and coriander-seed*, and a chafing-dish
withsome live charcoal in it. These were now brought
into the room, togetherwith the boy who was to be em-
ployed: he had been called in, by my desire, from
among some boys in thestreet, returning from a manu-
factory; and was about eight or nine years of age. In
reply to my inquiry respecting the descriptionof persons
who could see in the magic minor of ink, the magician
said thattheywere a boynot arrived at puberty,avirgin,
a black female slave, and a pregnant woman. The
chafing-dish was placedbefore him and the boy; and
the latter was placedon a seat. The magician now de-
sired my servant to put some frankincense and cori-

ander-seed into the chafing‘-dish; then, taking holdof
the boy’sright hand, he drew, in thepalm of it, a magic
square, of which a copy is here given. The figures

he poured a. little ink, and desired the boy to look into
it, and to tell him if he could see his face reflected in
it; the boy replied that he saw his face clearly. The
magician,holdingthe boy’s hand all the while*, told
him to continue looking intentlyinto the ink; and not
to raise his head.
He then took one of the little strips of paper in-
scribed with the forms of invocation, and dropped it
into the chafing-dish,upon the burning coals and per-
fumes, which had already filled the room with their‘

-smoke; and as he did this,he commencedan indistinct
muttering of "words, which he continued during the
whole process, excepting when he had to ask the boy a
question, or to tell him what he was to say. The piece
of paper containing the words from the Ckoor-a’n, he
placedinside the fore part of the boy's ta’ckee'yeh, or
scull-cap. He then asked him if he saw anythingin
the ink; and was answered “No:” but about a mi-
nute after, the boy, trembling, and seeming much
frightened, said, “
I see a man sweeping the ground.”
“When he has’done sweeping,”said the magician, “tell
me." Presently,the boy said, "
He has done." The
magician then again interrupted his muttering to ask
the boy if he knew what a beg/ruck (or flag) was; and,
beinganswered, “
Yes,” desired him to say, “
Bring a.
flag." The boydid so; andsoon said, “ He has brought
a flag.” “
What colour is it?" askedthe magician: the
boy replied, “ Red.” He was told to call for another
flag; which he did; and soon after he said that he
saw another brought; and thatit was black. In like
manner, he was told to call for athird, fourth, fifth,
sixth, and seventh; which he described as beingsuc-
cessively brought before him; specifying their colours,
as white, green, black,red, and blue. The magician
then asked him (as he did, also, each time that a new
flagwas described as beingbrought),“ How many flags
have you now before you i”’ “
Seven," answered the
boy. While this was going on, the magician put the
second and third of the small strips of paper upon
which the forms of invocation were written, into the
chafing-dish; and, fresh frankinoense and coriander-
seed having been repeatedly added, the fumes became
painful to the eyes. When the boy had described the
MAGIC. 353
seven flags as appearing to him. he was desired to say,
“
Bring the Soolta’n’s tent; and pitch it.” This he
did; and in about a minute after, he said, “ Some men
have brought the tent; a large, green tent: they are
pitching it;" and presently he added, “they have set
it up.” “
Now," said the magician,“ order the soldiers
to come, and to pitch their camp around the tent of the
Soolta’n.” The boy did as he was desired; and imme-
diately said, “I see a great many soldiers, with their
tents: theyhave pitched the tents.” He was then told
to order thatthe soldiers should be drawn up in ranks;
and, having done so, he presently said, thathe saw them
thus arranged. The magician had put the fourth of
the little strips of paper into the chafing-dish; and soon
after, he did the same with the fifth. He now said,
“Tell some of the people to bring a bull." The boy
gave the order required, and said, “ I see a bull: it is
red: four men are dragging it along; and three are
heating it." He was told to desire them to kill it, and
cut it up, and to put the meat in saucepans, and cook
it. He did as he was directed; and described these
operations as apparently performed before his eyes.
“ Tell the soldiers,” said the magician, “
to eat it.”
The boy did so; and said, “They are eating it. They
have done; and are washing their hands." The magi-
cian then told him to call for the Soolta'n; and the boy,
having done this,said, “ I see the Soolta’n riding to his
tent, on a bay horse; and he has, on his head. a high
red cap: he has ulighted at his tent, and sat down
withinit." “
Desire them to bringcoffee to theSoolta’n,"
said the magician,“and to form the court." These
orders were given by the boy; and he said thathe saw
them performed. The magician had put the last of the

six little strips of paper into the chafing-dish. In his
nutterings I distinguished nothing but the words of
the written invocation, frequently repeated, excepting
on two or three oecasions, when I heard him say, “ If
they demand information,inform them; and be ye ve-
racions.”
He now addressed himself to me; and asked me if I
wished the boy to see any person who was absent or
dead. I named Lord Nelson ;. of whom the boy had
evidently never heard ; for it was with much difficulty
thatbe pronounced the name, afier several trials. The
magician desired the boy to say to theSooltdn—“ My
master salutes thee, and desires thee to bring Lord
Nelson: bringhim before my eyes, that I may see him,
speedily.” The boy then said so; and almost imme-
diately added, “
A messenger is gone, and has returned;
and brought a man, dressed in a black‘suit of Euro-
pean clothes: the man has lost his left
MAGIC. 355
The next person I called for was a native of Egypt,
who has been for many years resident in England,
where he has adopted our dress; and who had been
long‘ confined to his bed by illness before I embarked
fbrthis country: I thought thathis name, one not very
uncommon in Egypt, might make the boy describe him
incorrectly; though another boy, .on the former visit
of the magician, had described this same person as
wearing a European dress, like that in which I last saw
him. In. the present case the boy said, “ Here is a
man brought on a kind of bier, and wrapped up in a
sheet.” This description would suit, supposing the
person in question to be still confined to his bed, or if
he be dead *. The boy described his face as covered;
and was told to order thatit should be uncovered. This
he did; and then said, “
His face is pale; and he has
mustaches, but no beard :” which is correct.
Several‘ other persons were successively called for;
but the boy"s descriptions of them were imperfect;
though not altogether-incorrect. He represented each
object as appearing less distinct than. the preceding
one-; as if his sight were gradually becomingdim: he
was a minute, or-more, before he could give any account
of thepersons he professed to see towards the close of
the performance; and the magician said: it was useless.
to proceed with.hi'm. Another boy was then brought
in; and the magic square, &c. made in his hand; but
he‘ could‘ see nothing. '1'he magician said that he was-

s 2

Though completely puzzled, I was somewhat disap-
pointed with his performances, for they fell short of
what he had accomplished, in many instances, in pre-
sence of certain of my friends and countrymen. On
one of these occasions, an Englishmanpresent ridiculed
the performance, and said that nothing would satisfy
him but a correct description of the appearance of his
own father,of whom, he was sure, no one of the com-
pany had any knowledge. The boy, accordingly,hav-
ing called by name for the person alluded to, described
a man in a Frank dress, of course, with his hand placed
to his head, wearing spectacles,and with one foot on the
ground, and the other raised behindhim, as if he were
stepping down from a seat. The description was ex-
actlytrue in every respect: the peculiar position of the
hand was occasioned by an almost constant head-ache;
and that of the foot or leg, by a stiff knee, caused by a
fall from a horse, in hunting. I am assured that, on
this occasion, the boy accuratelydescribed each person
and thing thatwas called for. On another occasion,
Shakspeare was described with the most minute correct-
ness, both as to person and dress; and I might add
several other cases in which the same magician has ex-
cited astonishment in the sober minds of Englishmen
of my acquaintance. A short time since, after perform-
ing in the usual manner, by means of aboy,he prepared
the magic mirror in the hand of a young English lady,
who, on looking into it for a litttle while, said that she
saw a broom sweeping the ground without anybody
holdingit, and was so much frightened that she would
look no longer.
I have stated these facts partly from my own expe-
rience, and partly as theycame to my knowledge on the

authority of respectable persons. The reader may be
tempted to think, that, in _each instance, the boy saw
images produced by some reflection in theink; but this
was evidentlynot thecase; or thathe was a confederate,
or guidedby leadingquestions. That therewas no con- \
federacy,I satisfactorilyascertained, by selecting the boy
who performed the part above described in my presence
from a numberof others passing by in the street, and
by his rejecting a present which I afterwards offered
him with the view of inducing him to confess that he
did not really see what he had professed to have seen. I
tried the veracity of anotherboy on a subsequent occa-
sion in the same manner ; and the result was the same.
The experimentoften entirely fails; but when the boy
employed is right in one case, he generallyis so in all:
when he gives, at first, an account altogetherwrong, the
magicianusually dismisses him at once, saying that he
is too old. The perfumes, or excited imagination, or
fear, may be supposed to affect the vision of the boy
who describes objects as appearing to him in the ink ;
but, if so, why does he see exactlywhat is required, and
objects of which he can have had no previous particular
notion? Neither I nor others have been able to dis-
cover any clue by which to penetrate the mystery; and
if the reader be alike unable to give the solution, I hope
thathe will not allow the above account to induce in his
mind any degree of scepticism with respect to other
portions of this work.

CHARACTER.
~
THE natural or innate character of the modern Egyp-
tians is altered, in a remarkabledegree, by theirreligion,
laws, and government, as well as by the climate and
other causes; and to form a just opinion of it is, there-
fore, very difficult. We may, however, confidentlystate,
that they are endowed, in a higher degree than most
other people, with some of the moreimportant mental
qualities,particularly,quickness of apprehension, a ready
wit, and a retentive memory. In youth,theygenerally
possess these and other intelrectual powers; but the
causes above alluded to gradually lessen their mental
energy.
Of the leadingfeatures of theircharacter,none is more
remarkable than their religious pride. They regard
persons of every other faith as the children ofperdition;
and such, the Moos’lim is early taughtto despise "‘. It
is written in the Ckoor-a’n, “
0 ye who have become
believers, take not the Jews or Christians for your.
friends: they are friends, one to another; but who-
soever of you taketh them for his friends, he, surely,
is one of them+.’’ From motives of politeness, or
* I am credibly informed that children in Egypt are often
taught,at school, a regular set of curses to denounce upon the
persons and property of Christians, Jews, and all other unbe-
lievers in the religion of Mohham’rnad.

selfish interest, these people will sometimes talk with
apparent liberality of sentiment, and even make pro-
fessions of vfrienlship, to a Christian (puticularly to
a European), whom, in their hear-ts,theycontemn : but
as the Moos’lims of Egypt judge of the Franks in ge-
neral from the majority of thosein their towns, some of
whom are outcasts fromtheirnative countries,and others,
men under no moral restraint, they are hardly to be
blamed for despising them. The Christians are, how-
ever, generally treated with civility by the people of
Egypt: the Moos’lims being as remarkable for their
toleration-as for their‘contemptof unbelievers.
It is considered the highest -honorn-. among the
Moos’lims, to be religious; but the desire to appear so
leads many into hypocrisy and pharisaicalostentation.
.When a Moos’lim is unoccupied by bhsiness or amuse-
ment or conversation, he is often heard to utter some
pious ejaculation. If a wicked thought,or theTEIBCIII-v
brance of a wicked action that‘he hascommittal,trouble
him, he sighs forth, “ I begforgiveness of God, the
Great*!" The shop-keeper, when not engaged with
customers, nor enjoying his pipe, oflienemployshimself,
in the sight and hearing of the passengers in the street,
in reciting a chapter of the Clroor-a’n, or in repeatingto
himself those expressions in praise of God which often
follow the ordinary prayers, and are counted withthe
beads; and in the same public manner he prays.—The
Moos’lims frequently swear by God (but not irrever-
ently); andalso, by the Prophet, and by the head, or
beard, of the person they address. When one is told
anythingthat excites his surprise and disbelief,he gene-
rally exclaims, “ ma-l'lah?” or,
“
wa-lla’hi?” (by
“
Ashtghfflr Alla’II el-‘Aztlan.
360 MODERN E‘GYPTlANS.
God C’); and the other replies, “ wa«-lla'hi!”—-As on
ordinary occasions before eating and drinking, so, also,
on taking medicine, commencinga waiting or any im-
portant undertaking, and before many a triflingact, it
is their habit to say,“
In the name of God, theCompas-
sionate,the Merciful ;” and after the act, “ Praise be to
God.”—When two persons make any considerable bar-
gain, they recite together the first chapter of the
Ckoor-a’n (theFa’t’hhah). In case of a debate on any
matter of business or of opinion, it is common for one of
the parties, or a third person who may wish to settle the
dispute. or to cool the disputants, to exclaim, “
Blessing
on the Prophet*!”—“O God, favour him1-‘." is said,
in a low voice, by the other or others; and they then
continue the argument; but generally with moderation.
Religious ejaculations ofien interrupt conversation
upon trivial and even licentious subjects, in Egyptian
society ; sometimes, in such a manner that a person not
well acquainted with thecharacter of this people would
perhaps imagine that they intended to make religion a
jest. In many of their most indecent songs, the name
of God is frequently introduced; and this is certainly
done without any profane motive, but from the habit of
often mentioning the name of the Deity in vain, and of
praising Him on every triflingoccasion of surprise, or in
testimony of admiration of anythinguncommon. Thus,
a. libertine, describing his impressions on the first sight
of a charming girl (in one of the grossest songs I have
ever seen or heard even in the Arabic language),ex-
claims, “ Extolled be He who formed thee, 0 full
" Ea-ml’ah’a-n-ne6’r¢ (for—
’a1'a-n.aeb’¢e),- or “ Bless ye (or
bless thou)theProphet1"-Sal’loo(or ml’le¢) ’a-n-ueb’¢¢.

moon !"-—and this and many similar expressions are
common in many other songs and odes: but what is
most remarkable in the song particularly alluded to
above is a profane comparison with which it terminates.
I shall adduce, as an example of the strange manner in
which lioentiousness and religion are often blended toge~
ther in vulgar Egyptian poetry and rhyming prose, a
translation of the last three stanzas of an ode on love
and wine :-
“
She granted me a reception, the graceful of form,
after her distance and coyness. I kissed her teeth and
her cheek; and the cup rang in her hand. The odours
of musk and ambergriswere diffused by a person whose
form surpassed the elegance of a straight and slender
branch. She spread a bed of brocade; and I passed
the time in uninterrupted happiness. A Turkishfawn
enslaved me. .
“
Nowl begforgiveness of God, my Lord, for all my
faults and sins; and for all that my heart hath said.
My members testify against me. Whenever grief
oppresses me, O Lord, Thou art my hope from what-
ever afilicts me. Thou knowest what I say, and what
I think. Thou art the Bountiful, the Forgiving! I
implore thyprotection: then pardon me.
“ And I praise thatbenignantbeing* whom a cloud
was wont to shade; the comely: how great was his
comeliness! He will intercede for us on theday ofjudg-
ment, when his haters, the vile,the polytheists,shall be
repentant. Would thatI might always,as long as I live,
accompanythe pilgrims,to perform the circuits andwor-
ship and courses, and live in uninterrupted happiness!"
In translatingthe first of the above stanzas, I have

substituted thefeminine for the masculinepronoun: for;
in the original, the former is meant, thoughthe latter is
used; as is commonly the‘case in similarcompositions
nftheEgyptians.-—-Oneof my Moos"lim friends having
§ust calledpn me, after my writingthe above remarks,I
send to him the last.four.slanzasof this ode; and asked
-‘him if he considered it proper thus to mix up religion
with debauchery. He answered, “
Perfectly‘proper: a
man relates his having committed sins; and then prays
to God for forgiveness, and blesses -the Prophet.”-—
“
But,” said I, “
this is an ode written to be chanted for
the amusement of persons who take pleasurein unlawful
-indulgences: and see here, when I closethe leaves,
‘the page which celebrates a debauch comes in contact,
face to face, with thatupon which are written thenames
of the Deity: the commemoration of the pleasuresof
sin is placed upon -the prayer for forgiveness." “
That
is nonsense," replied my friend: “

‘He is the Forgiving; theMerciful*.’ "-—-His answer re-
.-minds me of what Ihave ofien observed, that;the gene-
rality of Moos’lims,a most inconsistent people, are every
day breaking their law in some -pointor other, trusting

(chap. xx., ver. 15).
There are often met with,in Egyptian society,persons
who will introduce an apposite quotation from the
Clnoor-a’n or the Traditionsof the Prophet in common
conversation, whatever. bethetopic;_ andan -interruption
of this kind is not considered, as it would be in general
society in -our own-country,eitherhypocriticalor annoy-
ing‘; but rather occasions expmssions, if not feelings,
of admiration,' and often divers the hearers from a
trivial subject to matters of a more serious nature. The
Moos’lims of Egy.pt,:and, I believe,«those of other coun-
tries, are generally-fond of conversing on religion; and
themostprevalentmode of entertainingat partyof guests
among the higher and middleranksin lhisplace(Cairo)
is the-recital ofa Iahut’-mob (or-the whole of the-Ckomh

to say, thattheypreferhearings concert of music to the
performance of a khut'meh or zikr; and theycertainly
do take great pleasure in the latter performances. The
manner in which the Ckoor-a'n is sometimes chanted
is, indeed.very pleasing; though I must say, that a
complete lthut’mehis, to me, extremelytiresome. With
the religious zeal of the Moos’lims, I am dailystruck:
yet I have often wondered that theyso seldom attempt
to make converts to their faith. On my expressing my
surprise, as I have frequently done, at theirindifference
with respect to the propagation of their religion, con-
trasting it with the conduct of their ancestors of the
early ages of El-Isla’m, I have generallybeen answered
—“ Of what use would it be if I could convert a thou-
sand infidels? Would it increase the number of the
faithful? By no means: the numberof the faithful is
decreed by God; and no act of man can increase or
diminish it.” The contendingagainst such an answer
would have led to an interminable dispute: so I never
ventured a reply. I have heard quoted, by way of apo-
logy for their neglectingto make proselytes, the follow-
ingwords of the Ckoor-a’n: “
Dispute not againstthose
who have received the Scriptures” (namely,the Chris-
tians and Jews), without the words immediatelyfollow-
ing—“ unless in the mildest manner; except against
such of them as behave injuriously [towards you] : and
say [unto them] we believein [the revelation] thathath
been sent down unto us, and [also in that] which hath
been sent down unto you: and our God and your God
is one." This precept is, however, generally considered
as abrogated by thatof the sword: if it were actedupon
by the Moodlims, it might perhaps lead to disputes
'
‘ Chap. xxix., ver. 45.
CHAEACTIII. 365
which would make themmore liberal-minded,and much
better informed. _
The respectwhich most modern Moos’lims pay to their
Prophet is almost idolatrous. They very frequently
swear by him ; and many of the most learged, as well
as the ignorant, often implore his intercession. Pil-
grims are generally much more affected on visiting his
tomb than in performing any other religious rite. There
are some Moos’lims who will not do anythingthat the
Prophet is not recorded to have done; and who parti-
cularly abstain from eating anythingthathe did not eat,
thoughits lawfulnessbe undoubted. The Ima'm Ahh’-
mad Ib'n_Hham’bal would not even eat water-melons,
because, although he knew that the Prophet ate them,
he could not learn whetherhe ate them withor without
the rind, or whether he broke, bit,or cut them : and he
forbad a woman, who questioned him as to thepropriety
of the act, to spin by the light of torches passing in the
street by night, which were not her own property, be-
cause the Prophet had not mentioned whether it was
lawful to do so, and was not known to have ever availed
himself of a light belongingto anotherperson, without
that person's leave. I once, admiringsome very pretty
pipe-bowls, asked the maker whyhe did not stamp them
with his name. He answered “
God forbid! Mylname
is Ahh’mad"
(oneofthenames of theProphet): “
would
you have me put it in the fire ?"-—I have heard adduced
as one of the subjects of complaint against the present
Ba’sha, his causing the camels and horses of the govern-
ment to be branded with his names of “
Mohham’mad
’.Al’ee.” “ In the first place,” said a friend of mine,
who mentioned this fact to me, “ the iron upon which

A similarfeelingis thechief-reason whythe Moos’Jims
object to printing their books. They have scarcelyn

contain the name of God: it is a rule among themto
commence every book with the words “ In the name of

Thehonour which the Moos’lime show to the Ckoorv
a'n is very striking. They generallytake care never to
hold it, or suspend it, ‘in such a manner as thatit shall
be below the girdle; and they deposit it upon a high

inconsistenciesand superstitions: such, at least, is gene-
rally the case. There are, I believe,very few professed
Moos’lims who are really unbelievers; and these dare ‘
not openly declare their unbelief. I have heard of two
or three such, who have been rendered so by long and
intimate intercourse with Europeans; and have met with
one materialist, who has often had long discussions with
me. In preceding chapters of this work,several prac-
tices indicative of the religious feeling which prevails
among the Moos’lims of Egypt ‘have been inciden-
tally mentioned. Religious appeals are generallyused
by the beggars in this country: some examples of these
will be given hereafter. Of a similar nature, also, are
the cries of many of the persons who sell vegetables,
&c. The cry of the nightlywatchman in the quarter in
which I lived in Cairo during my first visit struck me as
remarkable for its beauty and sublimity—-“I proclaim
the absolute glory of the living King,who sleepeth not
nor dieth'." The present watchman, in the same
quarter, exclaims, “
O Lord! 0 Everlasting?!” Many
other illustrationsof the religious characterof the people
whom I am endeavouring to portray might be added.
I must, however, here acknowledge, that religion has
much declined among them and most othersof the same
faith. Whoever has been in the habit of conversing
familiarlywith the modem Moos’lims, must often have
heard them remark, with a sigh, “It is the end of
time!”—“The world has fallen into infidelity."—They
are convinced that the present state of their religion is
a proofthat the end of the world is near. The mention
which I have made, in a former chapter, of some of the

tenets of theWa.h’ha’bees,as beingthose of theprimitive
Moos’lims,shows how much the generality of the modern
professors of the faith of the Ckoor-a’n have deviated
from theprecepts originallydelivered to its disciples.
Influencedby their belief in predestination, the men
display,intimes of distressing uncertainty,an exemplary
patience, and after any afllicting event, a remarkable
degree of resignation and fortitude, approaching nearly
to apathy’; generallyexhibitingtheir sorrow onlyby a
sigh, and the exclamation of Allah lceree’m! (God is
bountiful l): but the women, on the contrary, give vent
to their griefby the most extravagant cries and shrieks.
While the Christian blames himself for every untoward
event which he thinks he has brought upon himself,or
might have avoided, the Moos’lim enjoys a remarkable
serenity of mind in all the vicissitudes of life. When he
sees his end approaching, his resignation is still con-
spicuous: he exclaims, “
Verilyto God we belong; and
verily to Him we return!" and to those who inquire
respecting his state, in general his reply is, “Praise be
to God! Our Lord is bountiful !”-—His belief in pre-
destination does not, however, prevent his taking any
step to attain an object that he may have in view; not
being perfectly absolute, or unconditional: nor does it
in general make him careless of avoiding danger; for
he thinkshimself forbidden to do so by these words of
the Ckoor-a’n1', “Throw not [yourselves] with your

They are not, however, so apathetic as some travellers have
supposed; for it is not uncommon to see them weep; and such a
demonstration of feeling is not considered by themas unmanly:
even heroes are frequently represented, in their romances and
histories, as weeping under heavy afliction.

thelatter class have been put in the placesof the former
theyhave exceeded their predecessors in tyranny; and
it is a common remark,that theyare “

Though I now frequently see the houseless dogs
beaten in the streets of Cairo, and that when quite in-
offensive and quiet, I still oflen observe men feeding
them with bread, &c.; and the persons who do so are
mostly poor men. In every district of this city are
many small troughs, which are dailyreplenished with
water for the dogs. In each street where there are
shops, a sack’cka receives a small monthlysum from
each shopman for sprinklingthe street: and fillingthe
trough or troughs for the dogs in that street. There
is also a dogs’-trough under almost every shop of a
shurbet’lee,or seller of sherbets.——It may here be men-
tioned, that the dogs of Cairo, few of which have
masters, compose regular and distinct tribes; and the
dogs of each tribeconfine themselves to a certain dis-
trict or quarter, from which they invariablychase away
any strange dog that may venture to intrude. These
animals are very numerous in Cairo. They are gene-

if they knew thatthe majority of the people of the city
regarded them as unclean: but theyoften bark at per-
sons in the Frank dress; and at night, theyannoyevery

out from the butchers’ shops, and from houses. Many
dogs also prowl about the mounds of rubbish around
the metropolis; and these, with the vultures, feed upon
the carcases of the camels, asses, &c., that die in the
town. They are mostlyof a sandy colour; and seem to
partake of the form and disposition of thejackal.
The general opinion of the Moodlims, which holds
the dog to be unclean, does not prevent their keeping
this animal as a house-guard, and sometimes even as a
pet. A curious case of this kind occurred a short time
ago. A woman in this city, who had neither husband
nor child nor friend to solace her, made a dog her com-
paniou. Deathtook this only associate from her; and,
in her griefand her affection for it, she determined to
bury it; and not merely to commit it to the earth with-
out ceremony, but to inter it as a Moos’lim,in a respect-
able tomb, in the cemetery of the Ima'm Esh-Sha’fe'ee,
which is regarded as especiallysacred. She washed the
dog according to the rules prescribed to be observed in
the case of a deceased Moos’Iim, wrapped it in hand.

hired severalwailing-women;and,with them,performed
a regular lamentation. This done (but not withoutex-
citing the wonder of her neighbours, who could not con-
jecture what person in her house was dead, yet would
not intrude, because she never associated with them),
she hired a. number of chanters, to head the funeral-
procession, and school-boys, to sing, and carry the
Ckoor-a’n before the bier; and the train went forth in
respectable order; herself and the hired wailing-women
following the bier, and rending the air with their
shrieks: but the procession had not advanced many
steps, when one of the female neighbours ventured to

ask the afiicted lady who theperson was thatwas dead ;
and was answered, ‘‘It is my poor child.” The en-
quirer charged her withuttering a falsehood; and the
bereaved lady confessed that it was her dog; begging,
at the same time, thather inquisitive neighbour would
not divulge the secret; but, for an Egyptian woman to
keep a secret, and such a secret, was impossible: it. was
immediately made known to the by-standers; and an
mob, in no good humour, soon collected, and put a. stop
to the funeral. The chanters and the singing-boysand A
wailing-womenvented their rage against their employer'-
(as soon as they had secured their money) for having.
made fools of them; and if "the police had not inter-

It is a curious fact, that, in Cairo, houseless cats are
fed at the ‘expense of the Cka’dee; or, rather, almost
wholly at his expense. Every afternoon, a quantity of
olfal is brought into the great court before the Mshh'-
kem’eh; and the cats are called’ togetherto eat. The

sold it, on. pretence of its being too much out of order
to be rendered productive, excepting at a considerable
expense; and it now produces only a hhekr (or quit-
mnt) of fifteen piasters a year, to beapplied to themain-
tenance of the destitute cats. Almost the whole expense
of their support has, in consequence,.fallen upon the
Cl£a’dee, who, by reason of his office, is the guardian of
thisand all othercharitableiandpious legacies,and must’
suffer for the neglect of his predecessors. Latterly,
however, the duty of feeding the cats has been very ina-
dequately performed. Many persons in Cairo, when
theywish to get rid of a cat, send or take it to the Cka’-
dee’s house, and let it loose in the great court.
The affiibilityof the Egyptians towards each other
'
has been mentioned in a preceding chapter. Towards
foreigners who do not conform withtheir manners and
customs, and profess the same way of thinking,theyare
polite in their address, but cold and reserved, or para-
sitical, in conversation. With such persons, and even
among themselves, theyoften betraymuch impertinent
curiosity. Theyare generallyextremelyafraid of making
tn themselves enemies; and this fear frequently induces
them to upholdeach other, even when it is criminal to
doso.
Cheerfulness is another remarkable characteristic of
this people. Some of them profess a great contempt
for frivolous amusements; but most take pleasure in
such pastimes; and it is surprising to see how easily
theyare amused: wherever‘ there are crowds, noise; and
bustle, they are delighted. In their public fistivals;
there is little to amuse a person of good education; but
the Egyptiansenjoy them as much aswe do thebest of
our entertainments. Those of thelower-orders seem tn

be extremelyhappy with their pipes and coffee, after the
occupations of the day, in the society of the cofi‘ee-
shop.
Hospitality is a virtue for which the natives of the
East in general are highly and deservedly admired;
and the people of Egypt are well entitled to commenda-
tion on this account. A word which signifies literally
“a person on a journey” (moom’_/ir) is the term most
commonlyemployed in this country in the sense of a
visitor or guest. There are very few persons here who
would thinkof sitting down to a‘ meal, if there were a
stranger in thehouse, withoutinvitinghim to partake of
it, unless the latter were a menial; in which case, he
would be invited to eat with the servants. It would be
considered a shameful violation of good manners if a.
Moos’lim abstained from ordering the table to be pre-
pared at the usual time becausea visitor happened to be
present. Persons of the middle classes in this country,
if living in a retired situation, sometimes take their
supper before the door of their house, and invite every
passenger of respectable appearance to eat with them.
This is very commonlydone among the lower orders.
In cities and large towns, claims on hospitality are un-
frequent; as there are many weka'lehs,or kha'ns,where
strangers may obtain lodging; and food is very easily
procured: but in the villages,travellers are often lodged
and entertained by the Sheykh or some other inhabi-
tant; and if the guest be a person of the middle‘ or
higher classes, or even not very poor, he gives a present
to his host’s servants, or to the host himself. In the
desert, however, a present is seldom received from a
guest.—-—The account of Abraham’s entertaining the
three angels, related in the Bible, presents a perfect pics
cnumcran. 377
ture of the manner in which a modern Bed’awee sheykh
receives travellers arriving at his encampment. He im-
mediately orders his wife or women to make bread;
slaughters a sheep or some other animal, and dresses it
in haste; and bringing milk and any other provisions
thathe may have ready at hand,withthe bread, and the
meat which he has dressed, sets them before his guests.
If these be persons of high rank, he stands by them
wbiletheyeat; as Abraham did in the case above
alluded to. Most Bed'a\vees will suffer almost any in-
jury to themselves or their families rather than allow
theirguests to be ill~treatedwhileunder their protection.
There are Arabs who even regard the chastity of their
wives as not too precious to be sacrificedfor the gratifi-
cation of their guests*; and at an encampment of the
Bish’a'ree’n, I ascertained that there are many persons
in this great tribe,which inhabits a large portion of the
desert between the Nile and the Red Sea, who offer
their unmarried daughters to their guests, merely from .
motives of hospitality,and not for hire.
There used to be, in Cairo, a numerous class of per-
sons called Toqf’cy’lee’yeh, or Too_fi2y'lces (that is,
Spungers), who, taking advantage of the hospitality of
their countrymen, subsisted entirely by spunging: but
this class has, of late, very much decreased in number.
Wherever there was an entertainment, some of these
worthieswere almost sure to be found; and it was only
by a present of money that theycould be induced to re-
tire from the company. They even travelled about the
country, without the smallest coin in their pockets, in-
truding themselves into private houses whenever they

wanted a meal. or practisingvarious tricks for this pur-
pose. Two of them, I was told, a little while since, de-
termined to go to the festival of the seyd El—Bed’awee,
at Tun’ta; an easy journey of two days and a half from
Cairo. Walking at their leisure, they arrived at the
small town of Ckalyoo'bat the end of their first day's
journey; and there found themselves at a loss for a
supper. One of them went to the Cka'dee', and, after
saluting him, sa.id—-“ O Cka’dee, I am a traveler from
the Shurclree'yeh, going to Must; and I have a com-
panion who owes me fiftypurses, which he haswithhim
atpresent, and refuses to give me; and I am actuallyin
want of them.” “
Where is he?” said the Cka’dee.
“
Here, in this town,” answered the complainant. The
Cka’dee sent arasoo'ltobringthe accused; and in the
meantime, expectingconsiderable fees for a judgment in
such a case, ordered a good supper to be prepared;
which Cka'dees of country towns or villagesgenerallydo
under similar circumstances. The two men were in-
vited to sup and sleep before the case was tried. Next
morning, the parties were examined: the accused ad-
mitted that he had in his possession the fiftypurses of
his companion; and said thathe was ready to give them
up; for theywere an encumbranceto him; being only
the paper purses in which coffee was sold. “ We are
Toofey’lees"—he added; and the Cka’dee, in anger,
dismissed them.
The nativesof Egypt in general,in common withthe
Arabs of other countries, are justly chargeable with a
faultwhich is regarded by us as one of great magni-
tude: it is want of gratitude- This I am inclined to
consider a relic of the Bed’awee character; and as
arising from thevery common practiceof hospitality and
cusaacrmr. 379
generosity,and from the prevailing opinion that these
virtues are absolute duties which it would be disgraceful
to neglect. .
The temperance and moderation of the Egyptians,
with regard to diet, are very exemplary. Since my first
arrival in Egypt, I have scarcely ever seen a native of
this country in a state of intoxication; unless it were a
musician at an entertainment, or a dancing girl, or low
prostitute. It hardly need be added that theyare ex-
tremelyfrugal. They show a great respect for bread, as
the stefi‘ of life*, and on no account suffer the smallest
portion of it to be wasted, if they can avoid it. I have
often observed an Egyptian take up a small piece of
bread, which had, by accident, fallen in the street or
road, and, after putting it before his lips and forehead
three times, place it on one side, in order that a dog
might eat it, rather than let it remain to be trodden
under foot. The following instance of the excessive and
unreasonable respect of the Egyptians for bread has
been related to me by several persons; but I must say-
that I thinkit hardly credible.—Two servants were sit~
ting at the door of their master’s house, eating their
dinner, when they observed a Memloo’k Bey, with
several of his ofiicers, riding along the street towards
them. One of these servants rose, from respect to the
grandee, who, regarding him with indignation, ex-
claimed, “Which is the more worthy of respect, the
.
bread that is before you, or myselfP”—Without wait-
ing for a reply,he made, it is said, a well-understood
signal with his hand; and the unintendingoifenderwas
beheaded on the spot.

380 MODERN EGYPTIANS.
The higher and middle orders of Moos’lims in Egypt
are scrupulously cleanly; and the lower orders are more
so than in most othercountries: but were not cleanliness
a point of their religion, perhaps it would not be so
much regarded by them. From what has been said in
a former chapter of thiswork, it appears that we must
not judge of them, with respect to thisquality,from the
dirty state in which theygenerallyleave their children.
Their religious ablutions were, certainly, very wisely
ordained; personal cleanliness being so conducive to
health in a hot climate. The Egyptians in general are
particularlycareful to avoid whatever their religion has
pronounced unclean and polluting. One of their objec-
tions against wine is, that it is unclean ; and I believe
thatvery few of them, if any, could be induced by any
means, unless by a considerable bribe,to eat thesmallest
piece of pig's flesh; excepting the peasants of the B0-
hhey’reh (the province on the west of the western
branch of the Nile),many of whom eat the flesh of the
wild boar, and rats “. I was once amused with the re-
mark of a Moos’lim, on the subject of pork: he ob-
served that the Eanks were certainly a much ca1um-
niated people: that it was well known they were in the
habit of eating swine’s flesh; but that some slanderous
persons here asserted thatit was not only the flesh of
the unclean beast thatwas eaten by theFranks,but also
its skin, and its entrails, and its very blood: on being
answered that the accusationwas too true, he burst forth
witha most hearty curse upon theinfidels,devotingthem
to the lowest placein hell.
'
Dogs, too, are eaten by many Mugh’reb’ees settled at Alex-
andria, and by delcendantl of the same people; of whom there
are also a few in Cairo, in the quarter of Teyloo’n.
CHARACTER. 381
Many of the butchers who supply the Moos’lim inha-
bitants of the metropolis with meat are Jews. A few
years ago, one of the principal ’oo1’ama here complained
of this factto the Ba’sha; and beggedhim to put a stop
to it. Anotherof the ’ool’ama, hearing thatthisperson
had gone to make the complaint above mentioned, fol-
lowed him, and urged, before the Ba'sha, that the prac-
tice wasnot unlawful. “ Adduce your proof” said the
former. “
Here,” answered the other, “
is my proof,
from the word of God—‘ Eat of thatwhereon the name
of God hathbeen commemorated*.’ "
The chief of the
Jewish butchers was then summoned,and asked whether
he said anythingpreviously to slaughteringan animal:
he answered, “
Yes: we always say, as the Moos’lims,
‘ In the name of God! God is most great !’ and we
never kill an animal in any other way than by cutting
its throat.”——The complaint was consequently dis-
missed.
A few days ago, a man, purchasing a fatee’reh of a
baker in this city, saw him take out of his oven a dish
of pork which he had been baking for a Frank; and,
supposing that the other thingsin the oven might have
been in contact with the unclean meat, and thus con-
taminated, immediately brought a soldier from the
nearest g'uard~house, and caused thebaker (who was in
no slight alarm, and protested that he was ignorant of
therebeingany pig's flesh in his oven) to be conducted
before the Za’bit. This magistrate considered the case
of sufficient importance to be referred to the Ba’sha’s
deewa’n; and the president of this council regarded it
as of too serious and difliculta nature for him to decide,
and accordingly sent the accused to be judged at the

Mahh'kem’eh. The Cka’dee desired the opinion of the
Monftee, who gave the following sentence :—That all
kinds of food not essentially or radically impure were
purified, of any pollution which they might have con-
tracted,by fine; and consequently, thatwhatever thing
of this description was in the oven, even if it had been
"in contact with the pork,was clean as soon as it had
been baked.
A short time since, the Ba’sha received, from Europe,
a set of mattresses and cushions stuffed with horse-hair,
to form a deewa'n for his hharee’m. The ladies opened
one of the cushions, to ascertain what was the substance
which rendered them so agreeably elastic; and, dis-
gusted in the highest degree at seeing what they sup-
posed to be hog's-hair, insisted upon throwingaway the
whole deewa’n.
A Frenchman who was employed here, a few years
ago, to refine sugar, by the present Ba’sha, made use of
blood for this purpose; and since that, very few of the
people of this country have ventured to eat any sugar
made by the Franks: the Ba’sha was also obliged to
prohibitthe use of blood in his own sugar~bakeries; and
the white of eggs has been employed in its stead.
Some of the Egyptians, seeing the European sugar to
be very superior to that made here, use it; holdingthe
doctrine that what is originallyclean may become clean
again after pollution; but I am obliged to keep the
coarse Egyptian sugar for the purpose of making sher-
betfor my visitors; some of whom hold longdiscussions
with me on this subject.
It is a general custom among the Egyptians, after
washing clothes,to pour clean water upon them,and to
say, in doing so, “ I testify that there is no deity but
CHARACTER. 383
God; and I testifythatMohharn’madis God's Apostle'.”
In speaking of their religion, I have mentioned several
other practices instituted for the sake of cleanliness;
most of which are universally observed. But, notwith-
standing these cleanlypracticesand principles,and their
custom of frequently going to the bath,the Egyptians
do not change their linen so often as some people of
more northern climates, who need not so much to do
this frequently: they ofien go to the bath in a dirty
shirt; and, after a thoroughwashing,put on the same
again.
Filialpiety is one of the more remarkablevirtues of
this people. The outward respect which they pay to
theirparents, I have already had occasion to mention.
Great respect is also shown by theyoung to those far
advanced in aged‘; particularlyto such as are reputed
men of great piety or learning.
Love of their country is anotherpredominant charac-
teristic of the modern Egyptians. In general, theyhave
a great dread of quitting their native land. I have
heard of several determining to visit a foreigncountry,
‘
for the sake of considerable advantages in prospect;
but when the time of their intended departure drew
near, their resolution failed them. Severe oppression
has lately lessened this feeling; which is doubtless
owing, in a great degree, to ignorance of foreign lands
and their inhabitants. It was probably from the same
feeling prevailing among the Arabs of his time that
Mohham'mad was induced to promise such high re-
wards in a future world to those who tied their country

for the sake of his religion. I have heard it remarked
as a proofof the extraordinary love which the Egyptians
have for their native place, thata woman or girl in this
country will seldom consent, or her parents allow her,
to marry a man who will not promise to reside with her
in her native town or village; but I rather think that
the reluctance to change the place of abode in this case
arises from the risk which the female incurs of wanting
the protection of her relations. The Bed’awees are so
attached to theirdeserts, and have so great a contempt
for people who reside in towns, and for agriculturists,
thatit is a matter of surprise thatso many of themwere
induced to settle even upon thefertilebanks of the Nile.
The modern Egyptians, thoughmostly descended from
Bed’awees, while they resemble their ancestors in love
of their native country, have a horror of the desert.
One journey in the desert furnishes them with tales of
exaggerated hardships, perils, and wonders, which they
are extremely fond of relating to their less experienced
countrymen.
Indolence pervades all classes of the Egyptians, ex-
cepting those who are obliged to earn their livelihood by
severe manual labour. It is the result of the climate,
and of the fecundity of the soil. Even the mechanics,
who are extremely greedy of gain, will generallyspend
'
two days in a work which theymight easilyaccomplish
in one; and will leave the most lucrative employment
to idle away their time with the pipe: but the porter,
the groom, who runs before his master’s horse, and the
boatmen, who are often employed in towing the vessels
up the river during calm and very hot weather,as well
as many otherlabourers, endure extreme fatigue.
The Egyptians are also excessively obstinate. I have
CHARACTER. 385
mentioned, in a former chapter, that they have been
notorious, from ancient times, that is, from the period
of the Roman domination, for refiising to pay their
taxes until theyhave been severely beaten; and that
theyoften boast of the number of stripes which they
have received before they would part with their money.
Such conduct is very common among them. I was once
told, that a fella’hh, from whom the value of abo'ut four
shillings was demanded by his governor, endured so
severe a bastinading rather than pay this paltry sum,
which he declared he did not possess, that the governor
ordered him to be dismissed; but, striking him on his
face as he limped away, there fell out of his mouth a
gold coin of the exact value of the sum demanded of
him; so thathis beating, terrible as it was, fell short of
what was necessary to make him pay. This disposition
seems a strange peculiarity in their character; but it is
easilyaccounted for by the fact thattheyknow very well
the more readilythey pay, themore willbe exactedfrom
them. In other respects, however, they are extremely
obstinate and difficult to govern; thoughvery obsequious
in their manners and professions. It is seldom that an
Egyptian workman can be induced to make a thing
exactlyto order: he will generally follow his_ own opi-
nion in preference to that of his employer; and will
scarcely ever finish his work by the time he has pro-
mised.
Though very submissive to their governors, the fella’-
hhee’n of Egypt are not deficient in courage when ex-
cited by feuds among each other; and they become
excellent soldiers.
In sensuality,as far as it relates to the indulgence of
libidinous passions, the Egyptians, as well as other

natives of hot climates, certainly exceed more northern
nations; yet thisexeeu is not to be attributedmerelyto
the climate, but more especially to the institution of
polygamy, to the facilitywith which divorcements are
accomplishedwhenever a man may wish to marry a new
wife,and to thecustom of concubinage. It is evensaid,
and, I believe, with truth, that, in this respect, they
exceed the neighbouring nations, whose religion and
civil institutions are similar; and thattheir country still
deserves the appellation o
“ the abode of the wicked,"
which, in the Ckoor-a'n *, is, accordingto the best com-
mentators, applied to ancient Egypt, if we take the
word here translated “ wicked”in its more usual modern
sense of “ debauchees.”—Avice for whichthe Memloo’ks
who governed Egypt were infamous was so spread by
them in this countryas to become not less rare here than
in almost any othercountry of theEast; but of late years,
it is said to have much decreased. .
The most immodest freedom of conversation is
indulged in by persons of both sexes, and of every sta-
tion of life, in Egypt; even by the most virtuous and
respectable women, with the exception of a very few,
who often make use of coarse language, but not un-
chaste. From persons of the best education, expres-
sions are often heard so obscene as only to be fit for a.
low brothel; and thingsare named, and subjects talked
of, by the most genteel women, withoutany idea oftheir
being indecorous, in the hearing of men, that many
prostitutes in our country would abstain from men-
tioning.
The women of Egypt have the character of beingthe
most licentious in their feelings of all females who lay

any claim to be considered as members of a civilized
nation ; and thischaracter is freely bestowed upon them
by theircountrymen, even in conversation with foreign-
ers. What libertytheyhave, many of them, it is said,
abuse; and most of them are not considered safe, unless
under lock and key; to which restraint, few are sub-'
jected. It is believed that they possess a degree of
cunning in the managementof their intrigues thatthe
most pmdent and careful husband cannot guard against;
and, consequently,that theirplots are seldom frustrated,
however great may be the apparent risk of the under-
takings in which they engage. Sometimes, the hus-
band himself is made the unconscious means of gratify-
ing his wife’s criminal propensities. Some of the stories
of the intrigues of women in the “Talesof9. Thousand
and one Nights ”
present faithfulpictures of occurrences
not unfiequent in the modern metropolis of Egypt.
Many of the men of thiscity are of opinion thatalmost
all the women would intrigue if they could do so with-
out danger; and that the greater proportion of them
do. I should be sorry to thinkthatthe former opinion
was just; and I am almost persuaded that it is over-
severe, becauseit appears, from the customs with regard
to women generally prevailing here, that the latter
must be false. The diflicultyof carrying on an intrigue
with a female in thisplacecan hardly be conceived by a
person who is not moderately well acquainted with
Eastern customs and habits. It. is not only diflicultfor
awoman of the middle or higher classes to admit her
par-amour into the house in which she resides, but it is
almost impossible for her to have a private interview
with n man whohas a hharee’m,in his own house; or to
enter the house of an unmarried man, or one who has

not a concubine slave, without attracting the notice of
the neighbours, and causing their immediate inter-
ference. But as it cannot be denied that many of the
women of Egypt engage in intrigues notwithstanding
such rislts, it may be supposed that the difficulties which
lie in the way are the chief bar to most others: for it is
certain that the women of this country are, withvery
few exceptions, of highlylibidinousdispositions. Among
thefemales of the lower orders, intrigues are more easily
accomplished,and frequent.
The libidinouscharacter of the women of Egypt, and
the licentious conduct of a great numberof them, may
be attributed to many causes; partly, to the climate;
partly,to their want of proper instruction, and of inno-
cent pastimes and employments; partly, to the degree
of restraint imposed upon them,andtheirseclusion from
open intercourse with the other sex, which undoubtedly
has a tendency rather to make women vicious than to
secure themfrom vice : but it is more to beattributed to the
conduct of the husbands themselves; and to conduct far
more disgracefulto them than the utmost severity that
any of them is known to exercise in the regulations of
his hharee’m. The generality of husbands in Egypt
endeavour to increase the libidinous feelings of their
wives by every means in their power; though, at the
same time, they assiduously study to prevent their in-
dulging those feelings unlawfully. The women are per-
mitted to listen, screened behind their windows of
wooden lattice-work,to immoral songs and tales sung or
related in the streets by men whom theypay for this
entertainment; and to viewthevoluptuous dances of the
ghawa’zee, and of the effiminate khow’als. The
ghawa’zee,' who are professed prostitutes, are not unfra-
CHARACTER. 389
quently introduced into the hharee'ms of the wealthy,
not merely to entertain the ladies withtheir dances, but
to teach them their voluptuous arts; and even indecent
puppets are sometimes brought into such hharee’ms for
the amusement of the inmates.—Innumerablestories of
the artitices and intrigues of the women of Egypt have
been related to me. The following narratives of late
occurrences will serve as specimens.
A slave—dealer, who had been possessed of property
which enabled him to live in comfort, but had lost. the
greater part of it, married a young and handsome
woman in this city,who had suflicientwealth to make
up for his losses. He soon, however, neglected her;
and as he was past the prime of life, she became in-
dilferentto him, and placedher alfections upon another
man,a dust-man, who had been in the habit of coming-
to her house. She purchased, for this person, a shop
close by her house ; gave him a sum of money to enable
him to pursue a less degraded occupation, as a seller of
grain and fodder; and informed him that she had con-
trived aplanforhis visiting her in perfect security. Her
hharee'm had a window with hanging shutters; and
almost close before this windowrose a palm-tree, out-
topping the house: this tree, she observed, would afford
her lover a means of access to her, and of egress from
her apartment, in case of danger. She had only one
servant, a female, who engaged to assist her in the ac-
complishment of her desires. Previouslyto her 1over’s
first visit to her, she desired the servant to inform her
husband of what was about to take place in the ensuing
night. He determined to keep watch; and, having
told his wife that he was going out, and should not re-
turn that night, concealed himself in a lower apart-

visitor wasin the hharedm. He went up; but found
thehharee’m-dam-shut. On his tryingto open it,his
wife screamed; her lover,at the same time, escaping
from thewindow,lJymeansofthepalm-tree. She
called to her neighhonrs—“Come to my assistanee!

room, and her husband outside the door, told her there
was nohodyin the house but her husband and maid.

mended by his neighbours, and abused by his wife, for
uttering a slander. The next day,his wife, taking with
her, as witnemes ofhis having accused her of a criminal
intrigue, two of the neighbours who had come in on
hearing her screams for assistance, arraigned her hus-
band at the Mahh’kem’eh m the slanderer of a virtuous
woman without the evidence of his own sight or of
otherwitnesa. Being convictedof thisoffence,he was
punished with eighty stripes, in accordance with the
ordinance of the Ckoor-a’n '. His wife now asked him
if he would divorce her; but he refused. For three
days after this event, they lived peaceablytogether. On
the third night, the wife, having invited her lover to
visit her, bound her husband, hand and foot, while he
was asleep,and tied him down to the mattress. Shortly
after, her lover came up, and, waking the husband,
threatened him with instant death if he should call, and

remainedwiththewife for several hours, in his presence.
As soon as the intruder had gone, the husband was un-
bound by his wife, and called out to his neighbours,
beatingher at thesame timewithsuch violence thatshe,
also, began to call for assistance. The neighbours
coming in,-and seeing him in a fury, easilybelievedher
assertion that -he had become raving mad, and, trying
to soothe him "with kind words, andprayers that God
would restore him to sanity,liberatedher from his grasp.
She procured, as soon as possible, a rasoo’l from the
Cka’dee; and went with him and her husband and
several of her neighbours who had witnessed the beating
that she had received,beforethejudge. The neighbours
unanimously declared their opinion that her husband
was mad; and the Cka'dee ordered that he should be
conveyed to the Ma'rista’n "
(or common mad-house) :
but the wife, affecting to pity him, begged that she
might be allowed to chain him in an apartment in her
house, thatshe might alleviate his sufferings by waiting
upon him. The Cka’dee assented; praising the bene-
volence of the woman, and praying that -God might re-
ward her. She accordinglyprocured an iron collarand
a chain from the Ma’rista’n, and chained him in a lower
apartment of her house. Every night, in his presence,
her lover visited her: after which she importuned him
in vain to divorce her; and when the neighbours came
in dailyto ask how he was, the only answer he received
to his complaints and accusations against his wife was
—“God restore thee! God restore thee!” Thus he
continued about a month; and his wife, findingthat he
still persisted in refusing to divorce her, sent for akeeper
of the Ma'rista'n to take him. The neighbours came

round as he left the house: one exclaimed—“There is
no strengthnor power but in God! God restore thee!"
—another said—-‘‘ How sad! He was really a worthy
man :"—a third remarlred—“Ba’dinga’ns" are very
abundant just now.”—While he was confined in the
Ma'rista'n, his wife came dailyto him, and asked him if
he would divorce her: on his answering, “No,” she
said—“ Then chained you may lie untilyou die; and my
lover shall come to me constantly.” At length. after
seven months’confinement,he consented to divorce her.
She procured his liberation; and he fulfilled his pro-
mise. Her lover was of too low a grade to become her
husband; soshe remainedunmarried; and received him
whenever she pleased: but the maid revealed the true
history of this affair; and it soon became a subject of
common talk.
When the wife of a man of wealth or rank engages
in a criminal intrigue, both she and her paramour
generallyincur great danger‘f.--Lastyear, the wife of
an oflicer of high rank in the army took advantage of
the absence of her husband from the metropolis (where
he always resided with her when not on military duty)
to invite a Christian merchant, of whom she had been
in the habit of buying silks, to pay her a visit. He
went to her house at the time appointed, and found a

eunuch at the door, who took him to another house,
disguised him in the loose outer garments and veil of a .
lady, and then brought him back, and introduced him
to his mistress. He passed nearly the whole of the
night with her; and, rising before she awoke, put into
his pocket a purse which he had given her, and went
down to the eunuch, who conducted him again to the
house where he had put on his disguise: having here
resumed his own outer clothes, he repaired to his shop.
Soon after, the lady, who had missed the purse, came,
and taxed him with having taken it: she told him that
she did not want money,but onlydesired his company;
and begged him to come to her again in the ensuing
evening; which he promised to do: but in the after-
noon, a female servant from the‘houseof this lady came
to his shop, and told him that her mistress had mixed
some poison in a bottle of water which she had ordered
to be given him to drink.—This mode of revenge is
said to have been often adopted when the woman's
paramour has given her even a slight offence.
It is seldom that the wife ofa Moos’lim is guilty of a
criminal intrigue without being punished with death
if there be four witnesses to the fact, and they or the
husband prosecute her; and not always does she escape
this punishment if she be detected by any of the oflicers
of justice : in the latter case, four witnesses are not
required, and often the woman, if of a respectable
family,is put to death,generallyin private, on the mere
arbitrary authorityof the government: but a bribe will
sometimes save her; for it will always be accepted if it
can with safety. Drowning is the punishment now
almost always inflicted,publicly,upon women convicted
of adultery in Cairo and other large towns of Egypt,

instead ofthatordained by the law, which is stoning'.—
A few months ago, a poor woman of this city married
a man whose trade was selling fowls, and, while livilg
with him and her mother, took three other lodgings,
and married three other husbands; all of whom were
generally absent from the metropolis; so she calculated
thatwhen any of these three persons came to town for
a few days she might easilyfind an excuse to go to him.
They happened, unfortunatelyfor her, to come to town’
on the same day; and all of them went, the same
evening, to inquire for her at her mother’s house.
Being much embarrassed by their presence, and her
first husband beingalso withher, she feigned to be BI,
and soon to become insensible; and was taken, by her
mother, to an inner room. One of the husbands pro-
posed to give her something to restore her: another
wished to try a different remedy: theybeganto contend
which was the best medicine; and one of them said,
“
I shall give her what I please: is not she my wife?”
“
Your wife!” exclaimed each of the three otherhus-
bands at the same time: “she is my wife.”-—-Each

proved his marriage: the woman was taken to the
Mahh’kem’eh; tried; condemnedto death; and thrown
into the Nile,.—Some time ago, when'I was before in
this country, a similarcase occurred: a woman married
three soldiers, of the niza’m, or regular troops. She
was buriexl in a hole breast-deep; and then shot.
A woman maysometimes,butvery rarely,trust in pal-
liatingcircumstances, or the support of powerful friends,
to save her from the penalty of death, in case of her
detection in a criminal intercourse; as in the following
.
lnstance.—The'Ba’sha, last year, gave one of the slaves
in his hharee’m in marriage to a rich slave-merchant,
CHARACTER. 395
from whom he had purchased many of his memloo’ks
and female slaves. This man was not only unfaithful
to her; but utterly neglected her; and she, in conse-
quence, formed an improper intimacywith a merchant
of whom she was a frequent customer. One day, when
her husband was out, a black slave belonging to him
happened to see a man’s head at a small aperture in a
window of the hharee’m. He immediatelywent up -to
search the room of the wife ; who, hearinghim coming,
locked her paramour in an adjoiningcloset. The slave
broke open the door of the closet; and the man within
rushed at him with a dagger which he wore in his
girdle; but the former siezed the blade in his hand;
and the woman held him until her lover had escaped:
she then kissed the slave’s hand, and implored him not
to cause her death by informingher husband of what
‘had passed: she, however, found him inexorable: he
‘immediatelywent to his master, showing‘his bleeding
hand, and telling him the cause of the wound. The
woman, meanwhile, fled to the Ba'sha’s hharee’m, for
protection. Her husband demanded of the Ba’sha that
she should be given up, and put to death; and, the re-
quest being deemed a proper one, she was brought
before her former master to answer for her crime. She
"threw herself at his feet; kissed the skirt of his cloth-
ing; and acquainted him with her husband’s vicious
conduct, and his utter neglect of her. The Ba’sha,
feeling himsegfinsulted by the husband’s conduct, spat
in his face; and sent back thewife to his own hharee’m.
Her paramour did not live long afier this: he was,amo-
thered in the house of some courtesans; but none of
‘these women was punished; as it could not be proved
which of them committed the act.
398 MODERN EGYPTIANS.
For their sentimena with regard to women, and their
general conduct towards the fair sex, the Egyptians, in
common with other Moos’|ims, have been reprehended
with too great severity. It is true thattheydo not con-
‘
sider it necessary, or even delicate, to consult the choice
of a girl under age previously to giving her away in
matrimony; but it is not less true thata man of the
middleor higher classes,almost always, makes his choice
of a wife from hearsay,or as a person blindfold; hav-
ing no means of seeing her until the contract is made,
and she is broughtto hishouse. It is impossible, there-
fore, thatthere should be any mutual attachmentbefore
marriage. Bothsexes, in truth, are oppressed by tyran-
nical laws and customs; but, happily,they regard their
chains as becoming and honourable: they would feel
themselves disgraced by shaking them off. As to the
restraint which is exercised towards the women, I have
before remarkedthatit is in a great degree voluntary on
their part, and thatI believeit to be less strict in Egypt
than in any other country of the Turkish empire: it is
certainly far less so than it has been represented to be
by many persons. They generally look upon this re-
straint witha degree of pride, as evincingthe husband's
care for them; and value themselvesupon their being
hidden as treasures‘. In good society, it is considered
highly indecorous to inquire, in direct terms, respecting
the health of a friend's wife, or of any female in his
house, unles she be a relation of the person who makes
the inquiry.—One of my Egyptian acquaintancesasking
another native of this country, who had been in Paris,

“ the guarded lady, and concealed jewel” (ca-Jill cl-muoo'neh
nu~I~go'Mwala el-uel>noo’neh).

what was the most remarkablethingthathe had seen in
the land of the infidels, the latter, thinkinglightly of
all that he had observed really worthy of exciting the
admiration of an unprejudiced and a sensible man, gave
the followinganswer.
“
I witnessed nothingso remark-
able as thisfact. It is a custom of every person among
the rich and great, in Paris and other cities of France,
frequently to invite his friends and acquaintances, both
men and women, to an entertainment in his house. The
rooms in which the company are received are lighted
with a great number of candles and lamps. There,
the men and women assemble promiscuously ; the
women, as you well know, unveiled; and a man may
sit next to another's wife, whom he has never seen
before, and may walk, talk, and even dance with her, in
the very presence of her own husband, who is neither
angry nor jealous at such disgracefulconduct.”
The Egyptians are equally remarkablefor generosity
andcupidity. That two such opposite qualitiesshould be
united in the same mind is not a little surprising; but
such is generally the case with this people. An over-
reaching and deceitful disposition in commercial trans-
actions, which is too common among all nations, is one
of the most notorious faults of the Egyptian: in such
cases, he seldom scruples to frame a falsehood which
may better his bargain. Among people who groan be-
neaththe yoke of a tyrannicaland rapaciousgovernment
(and such, indeed, is the government of Egypt), a dis-
position to avarice invariably predominates: for a man
is naturally most tenacious of that which is most liable
to be taken from him; and hence the oppressed Egyp-
tian, when he has a sum of money which he does not
require for necessary expenses, and cannot profitably

employ, generally lays it out in the purchase of orna-
ments for his wife or wives; which ornaments he can.
easily convert again into money. Hence, also, it is a
common practice in this country (asit is, or has been,
in almost every country under similar political circum-
stances) fora man to hide treasure in his house, under
.
the paved floor, or in some other part; and as many a
person who does so dies suddenly, withoutbeing able to
inform his familywhere is his mulch/ba, or hiding-place,
mohey is not unfrequently discovered on pulling down
houses. A vice near akin to cupidity,namely envy, I.
believeto be equallyprevalent among the modern Egyp-
tians, in common with the whole Arab race; for many
of them are candid enough to confess their own opinion
thatthishateful dispositionis almost whollyconcentrated
in the minds of their nation.
The Egyptians are generally honest in the payment
of debts. Their Prophet asserted that even martyrdom
would not atone for a debt undischarged. Few of them
ever accept interest for a loan of money; as it is strictly
forbidden by their law.
Constant veracity is a virtue extremelyrare in modern,
Egypt. Falsehood was commended by the Prophet
when it tended to reconcile persons at variancewitheach
other: also, when practised in order to please one’s wife ;.
and to obtain any advantage in a war with the enemies
of the faith: though highly reprobated in other cases.
This olfers some little palliation of the general practice
of lying which prevails among the modern. Moos'lims',
for, if people are allowed to lie in certain cases, they in-
sensiblycontract a habit of doing so iniothers. Though
most of the Egyptians often lie designedly, they are
seldom heard to retract an unintentional misstatement
cnuucrsn. 399
without expressing themselves thus——“ No, I begfor-
giveness of God*: it was so and so;” as, in stating
anythingof which they are not quite certain, theysay,
“ God is all-knowing1'.”—Imay here mention (and I
do it with some feeling of national pride) that, some
years ago, there was an Armenianjewellerin this city
(Cairo) so noted for his veracity that his acquaintances
determined to give him some appellation significant of
his possessing a virtue so rare among them; and the
name theygave him was El-Ingilee’zee,or TheEnglish-
man, which has become his familyname. It is common
to hear tradesmen in this place, when demandinga price
which theydo not mean to abate, say,
“
One word; the
word of the English: :” theyalso often say, “
the word
of the Franks," in this sense: but I have never heard
any particular nation thus honourably distinguished
excepting the Englishand theMugh’reb’ees, or Western
Arabs, which latter people have acquired this reputa-
tion by being rather more veracious than most other
Moos’lims.
I have before mentioned the practiceof swearing by
God which prevails among the Egyptians : I must here
add, that many of them scruple not to make use of an
oathwith the view of obtaining credit to a falsehood.
In this case, they sometimes ay, “ We-lla’hi1" (“ By
God!”); but more commonly, “Wu-l’lah!": for,‘
though the latter expression has the same meaning as
the former. theypretend that it may also beused as an
ejaculation in praise of God; whereas “ We-lla’hi” is
a decided oath,and, if uttered to a falsehood, or vio-
lated, must be expiated by feeding or clothingten poor

men, liberating a captive Moos’lim, or fasting three
days‘. This, however, is the expiation allowed by the
Ckoor-a’n only for an inconsiderate oath: yet the
modern Moos’lims sometimes observe it in order to free
themselvesfrom the guilt of a deliberatefalse oath; and
they generally prefer the fast to either of the other
modes of expiation. There are some oaths which,_I
believe, few Moos’lims would falsely take; such as
saying, three times, “
By God, the Great‘!-!", and the
oath upon the moos’hhaf (or copy of the Ckoor-a’n)—
saying, “
By what this contains of the word of God!"-
but a form of oath that is still more to be depended
upon is that of saying, “ I impose upon myself divorce-
ment 1" (that is, the divorce of my wife, if what I say
be false); or, “ I impose upon myself interdiction§!”,
which has a similar meaning (“ My wife be unlawful to
me !"); or, “
I imposeupon myselfa triple divorcementll!”,
which binds him by the irrevocable divorce of his wife.
If aman use any one of thesethree forms of oath falsely,
his wife, if he have but one, is divorced by the, oath
itself, if proved to be false, without further ceremony;
and if he have two or more wives, he must, under such
circumstances, choose one of them to put away. There
are, however, abandoned liars who will swear falsely by
the oath that is generallyheld most binding. A poet,
speaking of a character of this description, says,
“ But Ab’oo-l-Mo’a1’1ais most false
,
When he swears by the oath of divorce."

such occasions, curse each othefis fathers, mothers,
beards, &c.; and lavish upon each other a variety of
opprobrious epithets; such as “son of the dog, pimp,
pig," and an appellation whichtheythinkstill‘worse than
any of these, namely, “Jew.” When one curses the
father of the other,the latter generallyretorts by curs-
ing the father and mother; and sometimes the whole
household, of his adversary. They menace each other‘;
but seldom proceed to blows. In a few instances, how-
ever. I have seen low persons in thiscountry so enraged
as to bite, and grasp each other by the throat. I have
also witnessed many instances of forbearance on the
part of individuals of the middle and lower classes, when
grossly insulted: I}have often heard an Egyptian say,
on receiving a blow from an equal, “
God bless thee!”
“ God requite thee good!” “ Beat me again.” In ge-
neral, a quarrel terminates by one or both parties saying
“
Justice is against me*:” often, after this,theyrecite
the Fa’t’hhah together; and then,sometimes, embrace
and kiss one another.
The Egyptians are particularlyprone to satire; and
often display considerablewit in their jeers and jests.
Their language affords them great facilitiesfor punning,
and for ambiguous conversation, in which they very
frequently indulge. The lower orders _sometimes lain-
poon their rulers in songs, and ridicule those enact-
ments of the government by which they themselves
most suffer. I was once much amused with a song
which I found to be very popular in the town and dis-
trict of Aswa’n, on the southern frontier of Egypt: its
burden was a plain invocation to the plague to take
their tyrannical governor and his Copt clerk. Another
