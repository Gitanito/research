It was like passing out except I went somewhere rather than just going to nothingness. I saw the white light. I saw a figure standing there waiting for me. The figure was of monochromatic shades of brown. I moved toward the figure as if flying slowly or floating. I moved just by willing it. And then I woke up. I really wasn't out long enough to stay and find out or see much. It annoyed me that I had been brought back. My chest burned like it was on fire.

Background Information:

Gender:	 Male

Date NDE Occurred:	  12/23/1998

  NDE Elements:

At the time of your experience, was there an associated life-threatening event?       Yes         I was having a heart attack. My heart stopped and the doctors told me they had to use the defibrillators on me four times before it restarted.

Did you feel separated from your body?    Yes  I didn't see my body remotely if that's what you are asking.

At what time during the experience were you at your highest level of consciousness and alertness?       I was very alert and in pain up until my heart stopped then I went unconscious.

Did time seem to speed up or slow down?       No

Did you pass into or through a tunnel?       No

Did you encounter or become aware of any deceased (or alive) beings?       Yes     Only from a very long distance. I could see a figure dressed completely in all browns. I could make out a human figure and I moved toward it by floating. But before I had gone very far I woke up (was no longer unconscious)

Did you see an unearthly light?       Yes   As soon as I passed out I instantly saw a white light. At first, it had streaks flashing across it like interference on a television screen. Then it settled down and became a very brilliant pure white. Except there was a figure standing there in the lower left hand corner of my field of vision. So it was pure white except for the figure. The figure was distant, so it was a very small part of the scene I saw. Mostly it was just pure total whiteness.

Did you seem to enter some other, unearthly world?       A clearly mystical or unearthly realm     The pure white light I saw was very beautiful in itself. It was comforting to know I was experiencing what so many others have done when they passed on. I felt that it was the next progression to my future existence. It felt very natural and like the logical place to be since I was dying. Don't ask me why I felt this way or how I knew these things. I just did and am at a loss to explain it.

What emotions did you feel during the experience?       Not many. I knew this was a safe place and that I was supposed to be there. I knew I was dead or dying. I was totally unafraid. Everything was very matter-of-fact.

Did you suddenly seem to understand everything?       Everything about the universe     Only slightly. See above answers. Again, I wasn't there very long.

Did scenes from your past come back to you?       My past flashed before me, out of my control     I wasn't there long enough.

Did scenes from the future come to you?       No

Did you come to a border or point of no return?       No   I just opened my eyes and saw the doctor coming at me with the defibrillators.  

God, Spiritual and Religion:

Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?       Yes     I feel very fortunate to have been there and enjoy sharing the experience with others. It proves to me that all this NDE stuff you hear about is not all bullshit. This stuff really happens. I know, because I saw it myself. Many of the problems of this world now seem trivial to me. I now know there is a better place for us all after we die. What happens here on Earth is really not that important. Humans are overly concerned about what happens here on Earth. Death no longer frightens me at all. When it is time, I will just move on. It's the most natural thing in the world.  

     After the NDE:

Was the experience difficult to express in words?      No

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?       No

Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?        There really was no best part. Again, it just seemed like a natural thing to be happening. Leaving the light and waking up was the worst part.

Have you ever shared this experience with others?     Yes    They, for the most part, listened without comment. They know I would never lie about such things and so I think they believed or at least were interested in what I had to say.

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?     No   In the early 1970s I smoked a lot of pot, I drank a lot, and I experimented with LSD. The NDE was nothing like any of those experiences. The NDE was not at all like being high. It was like being somewhere else entirely. Nothing was freaky or unnatural. There was no euphoria, although I was flying. But even that seemed natural and normal.

Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?       Only that my trip into the light was very brief and so it was very simple.
