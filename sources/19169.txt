my name is ally Franklin Carter and in
September of 1955 I joined the US Navy
under their electronics training program
I wanted to become a radar technician
and so I went to basic training in Great
Lakes Illinois and went to et School in
Great Lakes Illinois graduating in the
fall of 1957 I think it was around
October and I chose as my duty station
radar picket ship called the USS
Kretchmer the ER 329 it was a converted
destroyer escort and it was destined to
have the latest radar equipment that the
Navy had for air search and surface
search and we were stationed in the
North Atlantic between our agencia
Newfoundland and the Azore islands we
were stationed across that and we
tracked everything that we could see
both on the surface and in the air and
we reported it to NORAD in Colorado
Springs Colorado and if it was an
unknown they would scramble fighters out
of whence Westover masks to come out and
investigate if we had an unknown target
had a very unusual experience I was a
radar specialist and my job was to
maintain the radars aboard the ship in
nineteen in the let&#39;s see it would have
been this early summer of 1957
I was a little I also because the ship
was undermanned I also served as a radar
operator so I served for own and eight
off-duty watches as an operator if there
was nothing wrong with the radar and I
got off duty one night at midnight and
went to bed and I was a called and told
to come fix the radar there was
something wrong with it and so when I
got up to CIC and I asked him what the
problem was
he said well we&#39;re tracking an aircraft
here at 3,400 miles an hour and I said
well there is something wrong so I took
that radar offline put the standby radar
on line and went to work and I started
running all the tests and everything was
normal and I completed all of the
preliminary tests that you would run to
check out a radar and everything checked
out absolutely normal so I went back in
the CIC and I said what did the the
target just before this what did they do
and as well ever perfectly normal it was
an airliner and it was the right course
in speed and by this time an hour it
gone by and I said well what do you
track it now and they says well on the
other radar everything&#39;s tracking fine
so I said well let&#39;s put this back on we
put it back online and they were
tracking normally everything&#39;s normal
so as a result of talking with I said I
can&#39;t find anything wrong with the radar
but there was clearly they had clear
plots and they told me it was an
absolute stellar contact because you
usually get the size of the blips
usually do with either the size of the
contact or the shape something and this
was a blip that was better than a half
inch across which indicated a really
large target or something very close and
so he said it tracked every sweep we got
a blip and if you get anomalies usually
what will happen is every sweep or every
other sweep you&#39;ll get a blank or maybe
every ten sweeps but it&#39;ll blank out but
this one was solid on every sweep and
that indicates a solid target so I asked
the king of the duty officer if he was
going to report it and he said no and I
said why not and he said well he says
you&#39;ve just told me there&#39;s nothing
wrong with the radar you&#39;ve run all the
checks you can run there&#39;s nothing wrong
with the radar we know we tracked the
thing if we report it and Colorado
Springs is going to ask us what&#39;s wrong
with our equipment and you&#39;ve already
said there&#39;s nothing wrong so you and I
then have a problem we both are in
trouble we got to come up with a story
and he says I&#39;m not going reporting it
was one contact that was it
that&#39;s fine with me so I went back to
bed so one night I was on the plot board
this was maybe three or four months
later
and here comes this contact and the
second blip yeah you could see that this
thing was moving it was moving like
three or four inches on a 360 mile scale
and so sure enough I plotted it and it
was three hundred thirty four hundred
miles an hour and again we didn&#39;t report
it but they said you know there&#39;s
nothing wrong this is our friend back
and the way we went and nobody thought
anything about it it was interesting we
didn&#39;t make a big deal out of it but as
we sure like to know what there was
thirty four hundred miles an hour in
1957 and the closest thing that we had
was about eleven hundred miles an hour
that had ever been told to us that we
might have or might encounter it
happened during the year the last part
of 57 and up until May of 58 it happened
at least three more times that I had
radar operator friends that would tell
me well we had another one of those fast
ones last night and it always was at
night that&#39;s the only other anomaly I
couldn&#39;t tell you what time of night I
doubt very seriously that in 1956 and 57
that the u.s. had craft even in the
experimental stage that could fly 3,400
miles an hour repeatedly I think that in
particular where this was if this would
have been a test range or we&#39;d have been
sitting down and somewhere in the Utah
and you know they could have been coming
over from Nevada or something like that
that&#39;s that&#39;s different we&#39;re sitting in
the middle of the North Atlantic with it
at least 1,200 miles to any lands so
they were flying around the top of the
globe with those kinds of speeds for
those lengths of time to get from land
point the land point I don&#39;t believe we
had anything because I was kept abreast
and we were told of all of the latest
missiles all of the latest aircraft that
any of the foreign countries had I was
on a secret on a need-to-know basis but
I was shown radar systems and other
stuff that was from Russia and I&#39;m quite
sure that
the people were concerned about the fact
that they didn&#39;t know what it was we
didn&#39;t have anything that would fly that
fast and that they decided to limit that
information not to let the Russians know
what we didn&#39;t have or didn&#39;t know and
they didn&#39;t want anybody to know
anything about what we were seeing and I
think that started it and then it got
out of hand but I know that the only
people that they&#39;re keeping it secret
from the day are the Americans everybody
else knows about it and accepts it and
all the other governments in the world
except England and the u.s. primarily
are accepting it it&#39;s very irritating to
me personally to see that go on because
I have thought a lot about how your life
would change if the government came out
tomorrow and said that we&#39;ve been lying
to you well we all know now that that
would be nothing new they&#39;ve lied to us
by almost anything but I think people
are at the point where they could accept
the fact that they&#39;re going to have to
make their car payments and their house
payments next week the same way they did
before this announcement
when people talk to me about the fact
that they may be the figment of my
imagination I was a damn good et I knew
I knew my radar it was my love at the
time and I know the systems and I knew
that there was nothing wrong with those
systems and I knew that we were tracking
real contacts I knew the difference
between what they call running rabbits
and chaff all of the other stuff that
they would give us a psychologist was
from the University of Missouri Medical
School was making the presentation and
as a part of his presentation he was
explaining how much grief he was taking
from the faculty and wanting to know why
he was involved in something like UFOs
and he said I&#39;ll tell you why I have
this guy as an example as a client he
was in the Air Force he was in the
Alaska and he was on the dew line he
tracked things at 3,400 miles an hour
and they told him he was crazy and he
still now all these years later this was
in the late 50s and he&#39;s now having
psychological problems and I&#39;m trying to
help people like him and I figured
that&#39;s what I was trained for and that&#39;s
why I&#39;m doing it and he said
surprisingly they kind of leave me alone
but when he said thirty four hundred
miles an hour I made the effort to track
him down after his talk and got the name
of the client and actually talked to
this client who was a sergeant in the
arm I mean the Air Force his name was
Dave Wallace and he had been on the dew
line with the big stationary ballistic
missile radars that they had to beam
used system and he said yes we tracked
him at 3,400 miles an hour and he says
the interesting part of it was we
tracked them three and four hundred
miles out in space and he says we
complain to the radar people that was a
General Electric had built the system so
we kept reporting this stuff and they
kept telling us we couldn&#39;t report that
stuff out there so we said well we are
doing it and it is real and so they came
in and actually made movies
the scope and when they took him back
and analyzed what they were seeing they
came back and put a fix into the radar
so their distance into space was like 12
or 15 miles they said that&#39;s all the
ballistic missiles will ever go you
don&#39;t need to see any further so they
just limited the receivers to where they
would I mean the the scope where it
would only expand to where they could
see 12 15 miles out in space
I talked to a lady came forward about
two years ago that was an army radar
operator stationed in California during
the 50s and she also reported that she
had taught had tracked craft at 3,400
miles an hour which seemed to be a kind
of a common speed at that point but she
said that she had done that with the
army and it they too would refuse to
report
never met the ma&#39;am I talked to him on
the phone and he had been in the Navy
and he had tracked on a destroyer in the
Gulf of Mexico they had tracked an
underwater craft and there were a
squadron of ships on maneuvers in the
Gulf and they said that they had a solid
target from two or three of these ships
and that they tried to yeah that we call
it Hindman and in you try to get over it
and around it where it can&#39;t get away
from you and they said they will it
escaped every time they tried to do that
and then it would stop and they&#39;d go
back and get and it was kind of like it
was playing with them and they did that
for two or three hours one day and it
finally took off I investigated a
military sighting that was a friend of
mine that we knew each other in business
for about seven or eight years and he
did not know that I had any interest in
UFOs and I did not know that he knew
what a UFO was until I had seen him make
a report of a sighting one day so I
called him up and talked to him about it
and he says well that was nothing to
what I saw when I was in the Air Force
and he says I&#39;ll tell you about it
sometime
so I made arrangements to go down and
spend the day with him and he told me
about his sighting when he was a
lieutenant he was a navigator on an RB
36 which had the big cameras and they
did all of the secret photographing back
in the 50s and he was a the navigator on
one of these and with 22 people aboard
this craft and it was up over North
Dakota and somebody called he said it
was the tail guy from the tail gunner
section called and says you know look
out over the left wing and out about
they estimated a hundred yards from the
left wing was this hundred foot disc and
this was a clear day he says they talked
to the radar control tower and they had
it on radar and that they got all the
guys got up and went and took pictures
of it they had been given cameras now
this is another part that the secrecy
thing they had been given 35 millimeter
cameras and told how to fill out a
report if they saw a you
follow in there but they were
reconnaissance bomber group and so he
said all 22 guys got up and looked out
the window and saw this thing for about
five or six minutes and then it just
took off I&#39;ve talked to him about it
many times we&#39;ve had a number of
discussions about the secrecy issue and
it was interesting when he landed when
when this ship when this plane landed
off of their mission they were met by he
called it a recce tech it was a and I
don&#39;t know what that means it was an Air
Force group and they debriefed all of
these people told them that they could
not discuss it for 12 years
that they were under secrecy oh and then
a week later a group from Washington
came out and debriefed him and reminded
them of their secrecy oaths they
confiscated all the camera and the films
and everything took all the feelings oh
yeah they had pictures of it and he said
they took all the film and then when he
was discharged from the Air Force he was
a colonel in the reserves and when he
was discharged finally from the reserves
in the retirement they reminded him
again that he had signed the secrecy
oath about this there&#39;s just no real
reason for it except that it got to be a
policy and everybody&#39;s afraid to change
that policy but then I look at it the
Chinese have all our Russian secret all
of our atomic secrets and all of our
missile secrets and yet the American
people can&#39;t be told that there&#39;s
possibly craft out here from another era
and another another part of the solar
system or the universe and that they
can&#39;t handle it which is a ridiculous
argument but I think it&#39;s important that
we recognize that there are
civilizations that we need to
communicate with and I think we&#39;ve
reached that point in our evolution as a
human race that we need to recognize
that and the thing that disturbs me is
that the u.s. is going to be a third
world nation in in that field if we&#39;re
not careful by having all of the secrecy
and refusing to set up any kind of
diplomatic protocols as I know that you
have called for and I believe in very
strongly because they&#39;re out there other
nations recognize them and they&#39;re going
to talk to the people that are willing
to talk to them on a peaceful basis and
we can do what we want to but that&#39;s the
reality of it and so I&#39;m hoping that
people will come to their senses and
stop hiding this stuff from the US
citizens I mean it&#39;s appalling to me to
know that we can have the kind of
sightings that they&#39;ve had in Mexico
City
and you never hear one single word in
the national press of the u.s. that&#39;s
appalling that that&#39;s that&#39;s an
indictment of our system that you can&#39;t
believe it I mean they&#39;re reporting this
stuff and you know in China they&#39;re
reporting it in Cuba they&#39;re reporting
it everywhere except the US
you
