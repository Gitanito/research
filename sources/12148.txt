I sank to the bottom and remained there, undetected for a while, until a man saw me. My experience included a journey and a purpose. I clearly remember a tunnel and a vacuum sucking me back when it was time to return. I wanted to fight it and continue the journey, but was unable to do so. I spiraled and was sucked back into my body; back to the discomfort, pain and fear, which had been non-existent for quite a while. I was later told that I had no pulse for ‘some time’ and the man who found me spent a while with me, refusing to give up. I was badly bruised and damaged as he had beaten my chest with some force to revive me. I experienced anger and sadness at having to return to this life. 

My mother became over-protective of me and I turned into a very nervous child. I returned from my near death experience (NDE) with heightened sensitivity on many levels. I was able to remote view and had acquired extra-sensory perception (ESP). My IQ soared and I was tested at school frequently, to the point where I began to wonder if there was something seriously wrong with me. I was especially nervous when some men in suits came to our home to try to convince my parents to allow me to go to their academy. I was worried about being taken away. My parents would not allow it.

As the years went by, I came to accept my extra sensory abilities with the help of some psychics and clairvoyants. They were the only ones I could comfortably turn to without judgment or apprehension. They tried to convince me to ‘develop’ the gifts I had to help others. I decided I could not deal with that kind of thing emotionally and chose not to pursue it. I wanted to have as much of a ‘normal’ life as I could with my family and friends.

Did you pass into or through a tunnel?       Yes     It was like a huge vacuum cleaner. A feeling of spiraling and swirling in slow motion until I realized I had to return.

Extreme joy in the experience of the journey, and purpose (whatever it was to be), but nothing when I returned to witness the event from another place.

Did you come to a border or point of no return?       I came to a barrier that I was not permitted to cross; or was sent back against my will     

God, Spiritual and Religion:

What was your religion prior to your experience?    Conservative/fundamentalist   None

Have your religious practices changed since your experience?       Yes     I am unable to answer this specifically. I would say I am more ‘spiritual’. I also believe there is a reason and purpose for everything.

What is your religion now?       Conservative/fundamentalist   'Not sure...spiritual I suppose. I do believe in God, a higher power that has ultimate control over everything.'

Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?       Yes     I am unable to answer this specifically. I would say I am more ‘spiritual’. I also believe there is a reason and purpose for everything.

Did you seem to encounter a mystical being or presence, or hear an unidentifiable voice?       I encountered a definite being, or a voice clearly of mystical or unearthly origin

Did you see deceased or religious spirits?       I actually saw them  

Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:

During your experience, did you gain special knowledge or information about your purpose?    Yes   I cannot explain.

Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?        No I have a loving and understanding family.  

After the NDE:

Was the experience difficult to express in words?      Uncertain   It depends on who I choose to talk to about it.

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?       No

Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?        I did not want to return and was angry when I could feel the pain and I could not complete the journey. I will never fear physical death.

Have you ever shared this experience with others?     Yes    My parents who were very worried. My wife and children learned to accept my strange abilities. I have always been careful with whom I share anything and have kept it mostly to myself. People cannot deal with it.

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?     No

What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?       Experience was definitely real     Even at a young age, I realized the significance of the experience and was changed as a person forever by it.

What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?       Experience was definitely real     It was not until later in life when I came to a realization that the NDE was responsible for all the other strange things I have experienced and endured throughout my life. I truly believe it is all connected. I returned with heightened sensitivity and purpose.

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?     No

Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?       I have a complete understanding of a few aspects of life and the afterlife. But many other questions which I am sure will not be answered in this life. I try not to dwell on it all too much. But there are phases when certain events become a little overwhelming, so I seek the advice and company of a psychic / clairvoyant, and talk with my wife.    

    Experience Description 4075  					</p>  					Seven years after this happened; at around age 11, I developed an extremely and abnormally high IQ. I was 'tested' many times by the school and other organizations that were called in. Men came to our home two times to try to convince my parents to take me to an 'academy' in Baltimore for research. My mother had told me later in life that it had something to do with remote viewing. My parents would not allow it and wanted nothing to do with it, although they enrolled me in accelerated classes at the school, but it created a serious worry to me that I was going to be taken away. I developed a nervous condition due to this. I began to move objects without touching them. This went on for about four months until I shared this with a friend who stayed overnight. I scared him so bad that his mother had to come and take him home. I then shared it with my mother and totally disturbed her. Against my wishes, she told my father.  Shortly thereafter, I was enrolled in many social activities. They were advised to create activities and distractions for me. Then the telekinesis activities ceased, and I was never able to do it again. 

I had quite a few experiences throughout my life regarding seeing spirits, and also 'psychically' connecting with people. I consulted two psychics during my late 20s in an attempt to find an understanding. It was not until the past couple of years that I came to understand, on my own, that it was emotional energy, which was responsible for all this. It was not until recently that I am realizing a possible connection with all the lifelong experiences and my near death experience. I have spent my entire life searching for some kind of explanation.

I believe that after a while there was an abrupt feeling of being sucked back. And the pain and misery set in as I was being jumped on and slapped by a man who was trying to revive me.

What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?       Experience was probably real     I was too young to seriously think about it. It came clear to me later in life. But it seriously affected my entire life and I now realize this.

Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?       ?        Not being able to completely open up to anyone about the experience for many years is the most difficult aspect of it.

Perhaps I am now by finding this site.
