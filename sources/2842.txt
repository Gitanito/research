DOCTRINE OF KABALISM
HE word Kabala signifies tradition a1
knowledge. It thus refers to the Oral Law,
as handed down from antiquity; and em-
braces the occult traditions of all lands
and all peoples.
Often it is used merely as ref erring to the
esoteric doctrines of the Jews; but in its broader
sense it includes also the secn'!t doctrine of other
races. This secret doctrine, common to many lands,
was jealously guarded from the profane, and was
never permitted to pass into writing except in such
ambiguous terms as to baffle the uninitiated as to its
true purport.
In this sense the sacred books of the world, in-
cluding the Avesta, the Vedas and the Bible are
largely kabalistical; for they set forth traditions that
are capable of an inner, or esoteric, interpretation.
In fact, there are usually several interpretations pos-
sible, each more inner version revealing a deeper
truth to those who have advanced along the path far
enough to comprehend it.
The Kabala has two divisions; the Written Ka-
bala and the Unwritten Kabala.
Of the unwritten Kabala, S. L. MacGregor
Mathers, in his "Kabbala Ui;iveiled" says: "The
term 'Unwritten Qbalah' is applied to certain knowl-
edge which i.s never entrusted to writing, but com-
municated orally. I may say no more on this point,
not even whether I myself have or have not re-
ceived it." 5

DOCTRINE OF KABALISM 7
The author of these lessons is not so modest about
his acquaintance with the unwritten kabala. ·He has
received it fully, and has also investigated the writ-
ten traditions of the Jews and of all other peoples
having had much influence in shaping the world's
thought. And this seems the proper place to point
out tha't the unwritten kabala, like the written ka-
bala, is set forth in symbolical language, with pur-
poseful blinds and subterfuges to confuse the
uninitiated; so that of the few who undoubtedly exist
at the present day who have received it, most remain
in as much ignorance of its true interpretation as the
majority of students do after studying the more
accessible written kabala.
This unwritten kabala has been transmitted only
through certain secret schools. Those receiving it
well merit what is given to them. They are left to
their own devices in the matter of interpretation.
And because the real keys to its interpretation-
astrology and the tarot-have been largely ignored,
or distorted, they have floundered sadly in arriving
at its meaning. Whether written or unwritten, the
kabala is a philosophy correlated to esoteric astrol-
ogy as exemplified by the tarot; and it can only be
comprehended fully by those who perceive the true
relation between astrological energies and their pic-
tured tarot exemplification.
The Kabala of The Jews.-Because the Jewish
kabala has been the source of inspiration to so many
alchemists, metaphysicians, occultists and mystics, it
deserves special attention, and the remainder of the
lesson will largely be devoted to it. It has three
8 THE SACRED TAROT
main divisions: A. The Practical Kabala. B. The
Literal Kabala. C. The Dogmatic Kabala.
A. The practical kabala treats of ceremonial
magic, and includes the making of magic circles,
wands, swords and pentacles, and the use of inscrip-
tions and symbols for performing wonders. It deals
with necromancy, sorcery, exorcisms, sigils, enchant-
ments and communications with angels and devils.
Accessible books treating of this subject are: The
Sixth and Seventh Book of Moses, The Greater
Keys of Solpmon the King, and The Lesser Keys of
Solomon. Needless to say, as set forth in detail in
Lesson No. 185, these books and all such practices
are highly dangerous, and innocence is no protection
to those who dabble in such matters.
B. The literal kabala is so written that the let-
ters and numbers and words must be transposed to
perceive the meaning. It is a work really written in
code, and must be systematically decoded to have
any value. And the code in which it is written, and
which must be used to decipher it, takes three differ-
ent forms as follows:
1. GEMATRIA.-ln this system, words of the
same numerical value are used as symbols of each
other, and phrases of the same numerical value are
employed to explain each other. And as each Hebrew
letter is a number, this number is also obtained and
used, by adding the numerical value of the letters of
a word or phrase.
2. TEMURA.-This is a code in which, accord-
ing to prescribed rules, certain letters are substituted
for other letters. In addition to this permutation,
DOCTRINE OF KABALlSM 9
. the form of the letters occasionally used, and the
variations in spelling, all have a hidden meaning, and
for important matters anagrams are employed.
3. NOTARIQUON.-In the 2_ractice of this,
abbreviations are extensively used. Every letter, for
instance, may be taken as the abbreviation of a
word, and a single word expanded into a sentence.
Or the first letters, or the medials, of every word in
a sentence may be used to construct one word that
conveys the mystical import it is desired to impart.
But even after, though determining just what
code has been used, having translated the literal
kabala into ordinary language, it still presents the
matter in the form of universal symbols, which,
while quite pregnant with meaning to those who un-
derstand this universal language, is merely a collec-
tion of babbling allegories to one ignorant of the
tarot and astrology.
C. DOGMATIC KABALA.-This division of
the Jewish secret doctrine has four chief headings;
each embracing more or less numerous commentaries
which were written at different times by different
writers:. 1. Sephir Yetzirah. 2. Sephir Sephiroth.
3. Asch Metzareph. 4. The Zohar. Yet none of
what is now called the Jewish Kabala was placed in
writing before the beginning of the Christian Era.
We are seriously informed by commentators that
it wa.s first taught by God to his select angels who
formed a school in Paradise. Then, after the fall,
the doctrine was communicated to man that by its
means he might regain his lost estate. From Adam
10 THE SACRED TAROT
it passed to Noah, then to Abraham, on to the Egyp-
tians, from whom it reached Moses.
Moses was further instructed regarding it by an
angel, during his forty years in the wilderness. Then
Moses injected its doctrines covertly into the first
four books of the Pentateuch, and ir1itiated Aaron
and the Seventy Elders into its secrets. From them,
according to this tradition, it was handed down
through an unbroken line of priesthood succession
which included David and Solomon, to the time of
the destruction of the second temple; when, for the
first time, it was committed to writing.
This account, due allowance being granted to its
symbolism, conforms rather closely to the traditions
regarding the line of descent of the secret doctrine as
recorded by initi1
ates of other than the Jewish race.
It is held by this tradition that once the earth had
a very different climate, warm and mild, and that
the people of the Golden Age, like those in Jewish
Paradise, were free from strife, and needed to take
no thought as to what they should eat or what they
should wear. So pure were they that they had con-
stant communion with the angels.
But gradually changing climatic conditions, in
which life became increasingly severe, coarsened the
bodies and the minds of the people of the earth. And
finally, so terrible was the struggle for survival with
the advent of the Age of Iron, when a glacial sheet
covered most of the northern hemisphere, that man
was forced to eat the flesh of animals to avoid star-
vation. And thus descending to the plane of a carniv-
orous creature, the increasing activity of his animal
DOCTRINE OF KABALISM 11
soul cut off his .ability to communicate with still
higher entities. He no longer could get his informa-
tion direct from the angels, because he had become
too selfish and coarse to be able to tune in on their
vibratory rates, and he must, perforce, get whatever
he wished of the secret doctrine from those of his
race who had preserved the tradition from an earlier
time.
This kabalistic knowledge was a teaching concern-
ing the origin of the universe, man's proper relation
to God and all other entities, why man entered ma-
terial conditions, and how he might through partak-
ing of the Tree of Good and Evil ultimately regain
his spiritual estate and also partake of the Tree of
Life, and so attain Self-Conscious-Immortality.
From the children of the Golden Age, the tradi-
tion relates, this information was handed down by
word of mou.th, as allegorical stories, to more mate-
rial times: And thus it came to be an essential part
of the wisdom for which the ancient lands of Atlan-
tis and Mu are renowned.
Before the last cataclysm, in the Bible referred to
as the flood of Noah, when the last of these two
older continents sank, the Priests of Stellar Wisdom,
perceiving through astrological cycles the approach
of such a disaster, had encouraged the establishment
of colonies in what later were to become the seven
ancient centers of civilization-Egypt, India, Crete,
Peru, Mexico, China and Chaldea. And to these
colonies then established, that the ancient spiritual
wisdom might not perish from the earth, they sent
those to reside who were familiar with it.
12 THE SACR.ED TAROT
Just when the colonists from Atlantis or M u
reached their various outposts is not clearly defined.
But in Egypt, Moses, educated by the priesthood,
came directly in contact with their teachings, and in
his wilderness wanderings received further com-
munications from higher intelligences; all of which
became a part of the doctrine held by the Jewish
priests, and handed down to later times in the form
of abstruse allegories.
It seems certain that none of what now is known
as the Jewish Kabala was written until after the
commencement of the Christian era. The first to
place any Of this traditional knowledge in writing is
reputed to have been Ben-Ha-Kanah, about 70 A.D.
Rabbi Ismael be Elisha wrote about 121 A.D. And
Simon be J ochai, another Talmudist, the supposed
writer of the Zohar, appeared about 150 A.D.
However as a matter of historical research, it is
found that the Kabala first put in an external ap-
pearance in the seventh century, apparently through
N ea-Platonist and N ea-Pythagorean channels. The
main body of the Zahar seems to have been un-
known, except in the secret schools, until the thir-
teenth century of our era.
The early writings on the Kabala include a work
called Palaces, describing God's throne and His
angelic household, a work of The Dimensions of
Deity, and the Alphabet of Rabbi Akiba. In this
letter each Hebrew letter is taken to represent a
primordial spiritual idea.
The Sephir Yetzirah.-In the eighth century the
Sephir Yetzirah put in an external appearance. It is
DOCTRINE OF KABALISM 13
a complete philosophical system, divided into 33
brief sections, each in reality based upon one of the
1.2 zodiacal signs, one of the 10 planets, one of the
10 numerals, or the seal of the earth.
The work opens with the statement that there are
32 paths of secret wisdom. These are further elab-
orated in a commentary, called the 32 Paths of
Wisdom, written in 32 brief sections.
Sephir Yetzirah signifies The Book of Formation,
and is supposed to have been dictated by Abraham.
The key to its meaning is the manner in which it is
divided into chapters. As in all there are 6 chap-
ters, the formation of the universe is to be explained
through a study of the number 6. This number, as
reference to Arcanum VI indicates, has for divina-
tory significance the word Temptation, and in num-
b.ers indicates the oscillation of un,equilibriated
forces in their action and reaction. Astrologically, it
corresponds to Venus, the planet of love. Therefore,
according to the system upon which the Sephir Yet-
zirah is to be interpreted, the idea is conveyed that
the Infinite was Tempted into expression through
the desire to love. The Supernal Mind, that it might
enjoy love, brought forth the manifested universe.
Of these 6 chapters, the first C<ilntains 12 sections,
which, of course, correspond to 12 zodiacal signs.
The second chapter has 5 sections and the third
chapter has 5 sections. Thus these two chapters rep-
resent the universal man divided as male and female;
the number of man being 5 and the number of
woman being 5; and together these numbers em-
bracing the 10 numerals of the decade.
14 THE SACRED TAROT
The fourth chapter has 4 sections, each represent-
ing one of the formative attributes of the septenary,
corresponding to the 4 negative planets: Saturn,
Venus, Moon and Mercury.
The fifth chapter has 3 sections, each representing
one of the 3 active principles of the septenary, cor-
responding to Sun, Mars and Jupiter.
The sixth chapter contains the remaining four
sections each representing one of the three remain-
ing planets of the chain, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto,
and the seal of the earth which synthesizes these 32
numbers and astrological forces into a single grand
unity.
Masonry and the tarot are both founded upon 33
universal principles. These are rather unsatisfac-
torily set forth in kabalistical code in the Sephir
Yetzirah. They bear a correspondence in human
anatomy to the 24 vertebrae plus the 9 ankylosed
bones that form the base of the spine. In the widest
sense Deity is the 33, or unifying principle. Thus
we have the doctrine set forth kabalistically that
Deity, all-potential and alone, was Tempted into an
expression of his Love, and this formative power
became diversified into the 32 principles through
which His love is Realized.
TheLetters.-In the kabalistical system each
Hebrew letter is not only a number but in addition
represents an idea. Just what the idea is which is
thus associated with each letter it is a function of
the Tarot to reveal.
The Hebrew alphabet as a whole contains 22 let-
ters. These are divided by kabalists into three
DOCTRINE OF KABALISM 15
grouRs· The first group contains the three mother
letters, representing certain general principles, from
which the other letters and their corresponding prin-
ciples were formed. Then there are seven double
letters, and finally twelve single letters.
The three mother letters are Aleph, Mem, and
Shin. Aleph represents the plane of spirit, Mem re-
lates to the astral world, and Shin to the physical
where all is given form. Thus do the three mother
letters correspond to ego, Soul and Body of the
Universal Man.
Certain other letters are sometimes aspirated and
sometimes not, and are thus called double letters. As
there are seven plaqets and seven .active attributes
in nature so are there seven double letters; Beth,
Gimel, Daleth, Caph, Pe, Resh, and Tau. And as
there are 12 zodiacal signs, so there are 12 single
letters, although in detail they do not correspond to
them: He, Vau, Zain, Cheth, Teth, Jod, Lamed,
N un, Sameck, Ayin, Tzaddi, and Quoph.
And now we arrive at a point which may easily
prove somewhat confusing to the student. It is the
numerical equivalence of the Hebrew letters, and of
the 'corresponding English letters.
The Hebrew and the Chalde<Jn square-formed let-
ters are identical, and the square-formed Egyptian
letters are very similar. These letters were origi-
nally hieroglyphics for the spiritual ideas repre-
sented by the corresponding Major Arcanum of the
tarot, these, in turn, being correlated spiritually to
astrology. Each letter, thus, expressed a number-
some number from 1 to 22-which had the same
16 THE SACRED TAROT
thought-vibratory rate as one of the 22 astrological
influences.
But these letters coming into use by those uniniti-
ated in this spiritual and vibrat6ry relation naturally
were subject to conventionalizing influences. And
furthermore, those who sought to make translations
from Hebrew into the English language had no
· knowledge of the vibratory rate of a letter, and no
care for its spiritual correspondence. Consequently,
translators have made use of equivalents which, al-
though convenient for them, are not of the same
vibratory rate.
Therefore, to preserve the true numerical value
of each square-formed letter, occult students have
continued to use their original numerical significance
rather than those established by later conventional
use. And in deriving the English equivalent of a
square-formed ancient letter, in those cases where
translators have substituted an English letter with
a different thought-vibratory rate, occult students
use a true vibratory equivalent. Thus the Hebrew
Tau, •vhich means the sign of the cross, is translated
conventionally as Th ; and Teth, which means ser-
pent, is translated conventionally as T. But not only
is Tin the form of the Tau cross used in many lands,
but with its point down thus represents the creative
energy diverted to earthly ends, and as such it has
the significance of 22 and not 9; and 9 has the vibra-
tion of Th, the serpent, the spiral of life, being the
Deific number.
This translation of T and Th is the outstanding
difference between conventional translators and oc-
DOCTRINE OF KABALISM 17
.cult students. But it should be understood by those
who study the kabala and the tarot, that in such
studies the real vibratory rate of a letter is the im-
portant thing in determining its correspondence in
another language; and that the English equivalent
of each square-formed letter has been tested out on
this basis.
The correct numerical and English equivalent of
each square-formed ancient letter will be found in a
table at the front of this booklet. And that the stu-
dent may also have the conventional, and therefore
exoteric, significance, a list here follows :
1. Aleph, A, means ox. 2. Beth, B, means house.
3. Gimel, G, means camel. 4. Daleth, D, means
door. 5. He, H, means window. 6 Vau, V, means
nail. 7. Zain, Z, means weapon. 8. Cheth, Ch,
means fence. 9. Teth, T, m~ans serpent. 10. Jod,
J, means hand. 20. Caph, K, means palm of hand.
30. Lamed, L, means ox-goad. 40. Mem, M, means
water. 50. Nun, N, means fish. 60. Samek, S, means
support. 70. Ayin, 0, means eye. 80. Pe, P, means
mouth. 90. Tzaddi, Tz, means fishing-hook. 100.
Quoph,-0, means back of head. 200. Resh, R, means
head. 300. Shin, Sh, means tooth. 400. Tau, Th,
means sign of the cross.
Sephir Sephiroth:-The Sephir Sephiroth is also
called the Book of Emanations. It treats of the
numerical expansion of the undifferentiated state of
evolution. That is, it explains that creation, as it
later came into existence, was first in the Divine
Mind. Then to give this mental conception a more
external form it was projected into an evolutionary
18 THE SACRED TAROT
system, by means of definite impulses, each of which
bears arelation to a certain number. The universe
is thus shown to have been created according to a
definite plan, the parts of this plan bearing numeri-
cal relations to each other. This plan calls for a con-
tinuous expansion of possibilities, whereby an in-
finitely diverse number of forms move perpetually
forward toward greater perfection.
The work, as written, is highly mystical; for it
considers these impulses from the Divine Mind, by
which the universe is brought into existence, as bear-
ing the same relation to each other as do certain
numbers. These numbers are thus the representa-
tives of universal principles.
The student, therefore, who would read the
Sephir Sephiroth understandingly must be well
versed both in the Hermetic System of Numbers,
and the Doctrine of Signatures; for the Doctrine
of Signatures reveals in full concrete details the
action of those principles which are but abstractions
when merely considered as numerical relations.
Asch Metzareph.-Asch Metzareph, or Purify-
ing Fire, treats of alchemy. To comprehend the alle-
gories in which it is written the student must have a
thorough knowledge of chemistry, of astrology, and
of the tarot. The action of substance upon substance,
as set forth in this treatise in the language of uni-
versal symbolism, depends upon the inner nature of
each; upon that quality which we now recognize as
its vibratory rate.
The Zohar.-The most studied of the Jewish
kabalistical works is the Zohar, or Book of Splen-
DOCTRINE OF KABALISM 19
dor. It is generally supposed to have been written
by Simon be Jochai, about 150 A.D. Moses de Leon
made it accessible to the public in the thirteenth
century.
It embraces The Book of Concealed Mystery,
The Greater Holy Assembly, The Lesser Holy
Assembly, The Aged Man, The Book of Clear
Light, The Faithful Shepherd, The Palaces, The
Secret of The Law, The Concealed Treatise, Mys-
teries of Mysteries, Song of Songs, Come and See,
The Youth, Illustra.ti.ons of The Law, The Early
Work, and certain fragments.
The aim is to reveal to the worthy the nature of
the Supreme Being, the equilibrium of contrarities,
cosmogony, the symbolism of numerals, the nature
of man and angels, the law as revealed, the nature
and destiny of the soul, and much about angels, ele-
mentals, demons and other occult intelligences.
The most essential and most emphasized of all
kabalistical doctrines is expressed in translations of
the Jewish work as "Quod Superius, Quod ln-
ferius," which means, that which is above is as that
which is below, the Macroposopus, the universal
man, is to be understood by a study of Micropos-
opus, the finite man. God is thus related to the
natural universe as the ego is related to the body of
man. Consequently, we find Deity commonly re-
ferred to as The Ancient One, The Yast Counte-
nance, Illimitable One, The Concealed of the Con-
cealed, Adam Kadmon (the Archetypal Mari), etc.
Next in kabalistical importance comes the doc-
trine of the Ten Emanations of the Sephiroth, by
20 THE SACRED TAROT
which the universe was created. Sephiroth means
numerical emanation, and the kabala teaches that all
manifestation is accomplished in definite numerical
proportions through actions and reactions in the One
Primeval undifferentiated substance.
Prior to creation there was Ain Soph Aur, mean-
ing limitless light, or non-differentiated substance.
The first emanation, or numerical impulse is known
as Kether, meaning Crown, and symbolizing Motion
or Life.
Instantly, upon motion being transmitted to the
non-polarized, universal, all-diffusive spirit, it be-
comes polarized into two attributes, positive and
negative, masculine and feminine, action and reac-
tion; for life or motion is impossible apart from sex,
or polarity. It is impossible to have action without
reaction, positive polarity without negative polarity,
motion without something moving, something mov-
ing without form. Consequently, springing into
existence simultaneously with Kether, or Life, are
two other emanations called Chocmah and .Binah.
These usually are translated as Wisdom and Intelli-
gence by theological kabalists who try to dethrone
anything feminine from the Deific Trinity. But all
initiates are aware that they mean Love and Light;
for Love is the highest and truest Wisdom.
However large the orbit of the student's investi-
gations, or however recondite the plane of its action,
he will find that it must start with, and finally end in,
this kabalistical trinity of Life, Light and Love.
From this primitive trinity of positive, negative and
union the universe became differentiated into Seven
DOCTRINE OF KABALISM 21
specific, attributes through seven additional ema-
nations.
The Ten Emanations of the Sephiroth ~re, there-
- fore, the Seven Active Principles of Nature spring-
ing from a central source of Life, Light and Love-
from a triune God-head, or Spiritual Sun-just as
we receive magnetism, light and heat from the phys-
ical sun.
Although it has been well known that there is a
strict correspondence between astrological principles
and the 10 Emanations of the Sephiroth, the Ema-
nations really manifesting as astrological forces, this
correspondence has hetetofore been carefully con-
cealed as part of the Greater Mysteries. Also, as
the universe is divided into positive,· negative and
union, kabalists have divided the 10 Emanations
into three pillars, or Trees. The tree on the right is
the Biblical tree of Good, the Masonic pillar Jachin,
kabalistically known as the Father, or Pillar of
Mercy. The tree on the left is the biblical tree of
Evil, the Masonic pillar Boaz, kabalistically known
as the Mother, or Pillar of Justice. Centrally be-
tween these two trees of the knowledge of good and
evil stands the tree of Life; conferring Immortality.
It is the place of union of Jachin and Boaz, kabalis-
tically known as the Shekinah.
But early kabalists, to conceal their knowledge
from the profane, in illustrating the trees in the
form of a diagram, gave it incorrectly, knowing the
spiritually enlightened in· the course of their initia-
tion would discover the error. It would thus point
to the truth without actually revealing it, which by
22 THE SACRED TAROT
their oath they were bound not to do. In all current
works upon the kabala, therefore, being copied from
older works, we find emanation 2-4-7 constituting
the Tree -of Good, 3~5-8 the Tree of Evil, and
1-6-9-10 the Tree of Life, the Shekinah, or Pillar of
Mildness. The correct diagram is given in Lesson
No. 27, where it will be seen that as should be, the
even, or esoteric, numbers 2-4-8 constitute the right-
hand Pillar of Goodness, and the exoteric numbers
3-5-7 constitute the left-hand Pillar of Evil. Also it
will be seen that the necessary planetary correspond-
ences to each of the emanations when arranged in the
latter manner will place benefic planets on the Tree
of Good and malefic planets on the Tree of Evil.
The First emanation is called Kether, meaning
Crown, and symbolizing Life or Motion. It corre-
sponds to the planet Pluto. It belongs at the head
of the Tree of Life, containing latent within itself
both male and female potencies.
The Second emanation is Chocmah, meaning Wis-
dom, and symbolizing Love. It corresponds to the
planet Neptune, the head of the Tree of Good, in a
spiritual sense being positive to Uranus, though not
so from the material plane.
The Third emanation is Binah, meaning Intelli-
gence, and symbolizing Light. It corresponds to the
planet Uranus, being the head of the Tree of Evil,
being external to, and therefore more gross and
spiritually negative than Neptune, and also com-
monly much more malefic.
The Fourth emanation is Chesed, meaning Mercy,
and symbolizing Beneficence. It corresponds to the
DOCTRINE OF KABALISM 23
planet Jupiter, being the middle of the Tree of
Good, and positive to the Saturn principle of Evil.
The Fifth emanation is Geburah, meaning Sever-
ity, and symbolizing Affliction. It corresponds to the
planet Saturn, the middle of the Tree of Evil, and is
negative to the principle of Good.
The Sixth emanation is Tippereth, meanin_g
Beauty, symbolizing Attraction. It corresponds to
the planet Venus, the middle of the Tree of Life,
where all influences join in a common harmonious
Union.
The Seventh emanation is Netzach, meaning
Victory and symbolizing Conflict. It corresponds to
the planet Mars, the foot of the Tree of Evil, and
is negative to Mercury even as blind force is ever
subject to intelligence.
The Eighth emanation is l'fod, meaning Splendor,
and symbolizing Knowledge. It corresponds to the
planet Mercury, the foot of the Tree of Good, and
is positive to the instincts and impulses of Mars.
The N inth emanation is Yesod, meaning Founda-
tion and symbolizing Formation. It corresponds to
the Moon, next to the foot of the Tree of Life, the
enfolding, formative power that gives external ex-
pression to Tippereth.
The Tenth emanation is Malkuth, symbolizing
Vitality. It corresponds to the Sun, at the foot of
the Tre.e of Life, wherein the Spiritual Ideals of
Kether, having been attracted by Tippereth, and
having undergone formative gestation of Yesod, are
brought forth in full Virility of expression, becoming
in man Self-Conscious-Immortality.
24 THE SACRED TAROT
These three trees have been the great mystery of
the kabala, and volumes of abstruse reasoning and
mystical allegories have been written in the attempt
to throw light upon it; for kabalists have all per-
ceived that the Tree of Life, or the four emana-
tions 1-6-9-10, constitutes the secret of Immortality.
Bll.t just what this signifies in human life only a few
have discovered, and others have blundered along
blindly for want of proper keys, which astrology and
the tarot alone afford. But the moment any·kabalist
is shown that Venus is Tippereth ·he immediately
perceives the truth.
The head of the Tree of Life is the planet Pluto,
symbolizing the separation of the sexes, the place
where soul-mates part on their downward journey
and the place where they must again unite on_their
upward path. But the Tree of Life itself is formed
by the union of the Tree of Good with the Tree of
Evil-three positive forces and three negative forces
meeting at a common point called Tippereth. Thus
what Venus is to the human body, by the law of
correspondence, Tippereth must be to the Tree of
Life.
Now Venus rules the seed and union, and kabalists
are well aw<i:re that the Shekinah, or Tree of Life, is
some kind of union. But what they usually fail to
recognize is that in man there is a spiritual seed as
well as one physical, and that union, as indicated by
the four vibratory levels, or stations, represented by
the four emanations within the Tree of Life, can
take place on the plane of degeneration, on the
level of generation, in the realm of regeneration,
DOCTRINE OF KABALISM 25
or in the exalted state of the reunion of soul-mates. ·
Yet Venus, the planet of love, is the key to this
revelation. For those who recognize that Tippereth
is a seed endowed with life during union, giving
formative expression in the womb of Yesod, and
brought forth into life and action by Malkuth, even
as daily this is known to happen in the generation
and birth of children, should easily recognize that
the same principle applies to the evoltuion of Im-
mortality. But, of course,. as in bringing forth life
in the domain of Malkuth, at the foot of the tree,
the energies are directed toward the earth, and as
immortality is not of earth but of the highe~t spheres,
the energies must be directed toward the highest
level of union, toward the exalted and permanent
exchange of spiritual energies which corresponds
to Pluto when that planet is represented by the
letter T with its point up, instead of down toward
Malkuth, as commonly written.
A few kabalists have perceived the truth of this
matter. One, for instance, who was also a great
alchemist, states in his writings that he was acquaint-
ed wth the mystery of transmutation but had never
proceeded to the practice because he had not found
a woman who could help him in the work.
Also Mr. A. E. Waite, the eminent kabalist, in
speaking of the Shekinah says: "I have said there
are intimations of this state in eastern teachings, by
which, I mean India, but that-so far as I am aware
-they have not passed into writing." And he fur-
ther concludes, after an exhaustive study of kabalis-
tical literature: "We shall come to recognize only
26 THE SACRED TAROT
one secret doctrine of Jewry, which is the secret
. "
concerning sex.
Reincarnation.-This seems to be the place to
mention that the Jewish Kabala teaches reincarna-
tion, but only for those who fail to finish their work,
and never more than three times. And ev.en in these
instances, more often than not, more than one squl
occupies the same body to gain strength. Thus the
teachings of the Zohar contradict the teachings of
reincarnation as commonly taught in the East. It
sets forth the impossibility of numerous reincarna-
tions, and really seems to be a confused notion re-
garding the attachment of a discarnate soul to one
in the flesh for some definite gaining of experience
or the performance of some unusual purpose.
Soul-Mates.- The doctrine of soul-mates is quite
distinctly taught in the Zohar, it being stated that
those who abide by the laws of the Lord will meet
and marry their true soul-mates; but that those who
pervert the law will be denied such union. Impurity
keeps soul-mates apart, but purity and a moral life
bring them together, and when so united there also
will be a permanent heavenly union after death.
God, Himself, is both Father and Mother. The
word Elohim, translated in Genesis as God, is Fem-
inine plural; but the translators of the Bible, not
wishing women to share in anything Divine, have
rendered it throughout in the Masculine singular.
There is, however, an inadvertent admission of the
Father-Mother principle when Adam is said to have
been made in the .image of "Elohim, Male and
Female made He them." Hebrew scholars say that
DOCTRINE OF KABALISM 27
"Eloh" is feminine singular, and that the ending
"im," is a termination of the masculine plural, tpe
two being used together to indicate a feminine po-
tency united to a masculine idea.
Throughout the Kabala "The Ancient of Days"
is considered both Male and Female, and the Ten
Emanations are divided into 5 positive and 5 nega-
tive attributes.
The Four Realms.-The Ten Emanations ·of the
Sephiroth are divided into groups having affinity
with the four worlds; but at the same time the ten
emanations also each manifest in these four realms.
The four kabalistical worlds are: 1. Atziluth, mean-
ing Emanation and symbolizing the celestial realm
and the element fire. 2. Briah, meaning Creation
and symbolizing the spiritual realm and the element
air. 3. Yetzirah, meaning Formation and symboliz-
ing the astral -realm and the element water. 4.
Assiah, meaning Action and symbolizing the physical
realm and the element earth. The first 3 emanations
relate particularly to Celestial realms, the place of
ideals, even as Pluto, Neptune and Uranus have an
influence over the highest ideals of man.
The second 3 emanations pertain specifically to
Spiritual realms, to the creative regions, even as
Jupiter, Saturn and Venus have an influence over
man's moral nature, his reflective powers and his
affections. ·
The third 3 emanations relate more closely to the
formative regions, to the Astral realms, even as
Mer..cury, Mars and the Moon image, construct and
mold the products of man's genius.
THE SACRED TAROT
And the final emanation belongs to the Physical
world, to the realm of practical action, even as the
Sun vitalizes and brings forth from the soil innumer-
able forms of life.
lnterpretinp; the Kabala.- The great kabalistical
student, Eliph~s Levi, asserts that the kabala is a
sealed book to anyone unfamiliar with the tarot.
Not only is this true, but the tarot, as here ,presented,
will be found a key to unlock all other sacred books
~s well. To the discriminating student the most diffi-
cult kabalistical phrases will yield their inner mean-
ing when the tarot methods are applied.
Very briefly to illustrate, we find The Book of
Concealed Mystery opens thus:
"1. The Book of Concealed Mystery is the Book
of the equilibrium of balance." The balance here
referred to is Polarity, as exemplified by the Second
Major Arcanum of the tarot.
•:2. For before there was equilibrium, counte-
nance beheld not countenance." That is, conscious-
ness was not possible before this duality.
"3. And the Kings of- ancient times were dead,
and their crowns were found no more: and the earth
was desolate." These kings of ·the tarot being in
ancient times, indicates a previous round of evolu-
tion; being dead refers to the cosmic sleep of nirvana.
Kether, or Crown, means activity; therefore, intelli-
gence of the Divine Mind was inactive, and there was
no differenti'ation in progress.
"4. Until that head, desired by all desires, ap-
peared and communicated the vestments of honor."
Arcanum I, Deific Intelligence, awakens and sends
DOCTRINE OF KABALISM 29
the first Divine thought-wave throbbing throughout
the unmanifested void of Ain Soph Aur.
"5. This equilibrium hangeth in that region which
is negatively existent in The Ancient One." Arcanum
II, Isis, where polarity first manifests, is negative, or
feminine.
Such explanations might be carried out in regard
to every Kabalistical statement.
Summary.- As the Jewish Kabala is mostly writ-
ten in code, and all of it in the form of allegories, it
takes much effort for the student to form a clear
idea of its chief tenets. I will, therefore, here sum
them up in 'unequivocal language:
1. God and the Universe are the Ego and Body
of the Grand Man, or Macrocosm; and finite man,
or the microcosm, is a miniature copy of the Grand
Man, corresponding to Him in all details.
2. The universe sprang into differentiated exist-
ence in conformity to the law of numbers. These
ten emanations from Deity manifest on every plane
as 3 general and 7 specific attributes. In their inter-
action with one another they form, by a principle
similar to that giving musical overtones, 22 less ab-
stract and more specialized influences, or astrologi-
cal qualities. These, manifesting as the 12 zodiacal
signs and 10 planets of the chain, together with the
10 original numbers, form the 32 paths of evolution,
which really are the 32 factors of all manifested
existence. Yet at any given time all these 32 influ-
ences converge at every point in the universe. That
is, in some Quantity they are everywhere present.
And the specific point where they thus manifest-
30 THE SACRED TAROT
the earth, for instance-being a synthesis of their
influence, constitutes a 33d factor.
3. Great importance is attached to sex, it being
taught that man can reach the feminine principle
above only through union. The Shekinah is perfect
union; and it is taught that mankind approaches
God only through Shekinah. Those of impure mind
and gross passions can not partake of Shekinah, for
Shekinah is the Tree of Life, partaki
1
ng of the fruits
of which mankind i"s brought face to face with
Adonai; entering thus into Divine Consciousness.
4. Souls are differentiated in pairs, have an exist-
ence before material birth, are separated before in-
carnati.on; and it is this separation which constitutes
the original transgression. But through living a pure
and spiritual life on earth they ultimately are at-
tracted to each other and may even meet on earth.
This meeting is the Shekinah, and in time perma-
nently reunites them in heaven.
· 5. As exemplifying these four doctrines and their
numerous offshoots, there is the mystery of the pro-
nunciation of the name of Deity, which in the Bible
is translated Jehovah, and in Hebrew is a word of
four letters, IEVE, or J od-He-Vau-He.
Jewish tradition holds that, "He who can rightly
pronounce it, causeth heaven and earth to tremble,
for it is the name which rusheth through the
. ))
umverse. .
The real significance of this venerated word is
that it stands as representing the four universal
principles; and therefore he who understands these
four letters is also able to comprehend all power and
DOCTRINE OF KABALISM 31
all manifestation; and he who is able to pronounce
it-or utilize his knowledge-is able to live in com-
plete harmony with the Divine Law and thus par-
takes also of Divine power. It really signifies that
nothing is impossible to one who unites himself to the
Cosmic Will.
Because it is composed of four letters the name is
called the Tetragrammaton. These four letters,
which are symbols of positive, negative, union and
vibration, can be transposed in 12 different ways, all
conveying the same meaning, just as nature mani-
fests through the 12 zodiacal signs, yet in essence
remains the same.
These twelve ways of expressing the Deific name
are called the 12 banners. These banners are spelled
thus: IEVE - IEEV - IVEE - EVEI - EVIE
-EEIV - VEEI - VIEE - VEIE - EIEV -
EIVE - EEVI.
The Tarot Cards Utilize Both Extra-Sensory
Perception and Extra-Physical Powers.-A v a s t
amount of experimentation by universities in Amer-
ica and in England since the discovery of Pluto in
1930 not only proves that man possesses the power
to gain, through extra-sensory perception, informa-
tion not accessible to reason and the physical senses,
but that this perception extends into both the past
and the future.
On the inner plane consciousness can be extended.
unhindered by physical distance, and extended back-
wards and forwards in physical time. Even as to
gain knowledge on the physical plane, so on the
inner plane the attention must be focused on the
32 THE SACRED TAROT
information desired. The tarot cards, through their
universal symbols, are designed, among other things,
to assist in extending the inner-plane consciousness
and focusing it on the information desired.
All mental processes are governed by the LAW
OF ASSOCIATION. What has been perceived on
the inner plane through extra-sensory perception re-
sides in the unconscious mind as a memory. To
remember it-to bring it up into objective conscious-
ness-there ·must be a line of association between
what is in objective consciousness and this memory.
The symbols on the tarot cards are the most effec-
tive means known of forming the assoCiations that
enable what was perceived through extra-sensory
perception to be recognized by objective conscious-
ness.
The university experimenters have also demon-
strated that physical objects can be influenced with-
out the aid of any physical contact with them. This
result of using extra-physical power they call the
PK (Psychokinetic) Effect. The unconscious mind,
or soul, uses this power to cause the tarot cards in
a spread to become so placed as to reveal informa-
tion obtained through extra-sensory perception.

FOUNDATION OF THE SCIENCE
T HAS BEEN said by that eminent kabal-
ist, Eliphas Levi, that four signs express
the absolute, and in turn are explained by
a fifth. And we find this very true, both
as applied to astrology and to the tarot.
In each, the fifth term, by which the four funda-
mental elements are explained, is the language of
universal symbolism. Therefore, the student may
expect, in his study of the wide range of symbols
employed in the tarot, to be made thoroughly con-
versant with a language which has been employed
by learned men in all ages and all climes to impart
the most profound truths, a language which, because
of its wide appeal does not essentially vary with
the passage of time, which is imperishable, and
can be read by the intelligent members of any race.
The tarot is the ONE standard text-book on the
meaning of universal symbols.
Now these four signs, which are explained by uni-
versal symbolism, as applied to the Grand Man of
the universe, are represented by the four quadrants
of the heavens. These, in turn, of course, corre-
spond in function to the four letters of the Deific
Word, Jod-He-Vau-He. And because the sacred
tarot pictures and explains this Grand Man from the
feminine, or esoteric standpoint, it also has, in addi-

FOUNDATION OF THE SCIENCE 39
tion to being a text-book of the most ancient of
languages, four distinct functions to perform.
Therefore, even before explaining the source from
which the sacred tarot is derived, I feel that these
four distinct and important functions should be set
forth, and that those who teach this Hermetic Sys-
tem should insist that their students should at all
times .keep these four functions in separate compart-
ments of their minds, without confusing one with
another; for each is a distinct and clear-cut system
in itself.
Two of these systems-as must be true if they
correspond to the Divine Jod-He-Vau-He-are posi-
tive. They are really sciences. And the other two
are feminine and negative. They are systems of
divination, each accurately corresponding to one of
the four corners of the universe.
Corresponding to the Leo quarter of the zodiac
there is a Science of Vibration, to which numbers
furnish the key. Corresponding to the Scorpio sec-
tion of the firmament there is a system of Divination
by means of Cards. Corresponding to the Taurus
quadrant of the sky there is a system of Numerol-
ogy, or Divination by means of Numbers. And Cor-
responding to the Aquarius region of the heavens
there is a Spiritual Science, which forms the basis of
a complete philosophy of life.
The Science of Vibration.-Right here it should
be emphasized, so that later no confusion may arise,
that the Hermetic System of Vibration as deter-
mined through using numbers is quite unrelated to
THE SACRED TAROT
any system of numerology. Numerology, new _sys-
tems of which are being devised each year, is a
method of divination. And as divination by numbers
is one of the four functions of the tarot, nothing
here is said in disparagement of numerology. In fact,
I set forth such a system in Lesson No. 28 of this
course.
But the vibratory science here explained, although
dependent upon numbers for the determination of
effects, is not numerology. It is a positive science, as
precise in its results, and as independent of psychic
matters, as any physical science. Through it, as the
physicist determines by means of numbers the vibra-
tory frequency of different colors, or as by means of
numbers he determines the vibratory frequency of
any selected musical tone, so also by means of num-
bers, can the vibratory key of any thought be deter-
mined.
The great Caruso, in demonstrating the power of
his voice, also well illustrated the importance of the
vibratory key. When he went into a cafe, at times
he would call for a wine glass. Tapping the glass to
get the key, he would request the waiter to place the
glass on a table in a distant part of the room. And
then, by singing the tone to which he had found the
glass keyed, by the powerful vibrations of his voice
reaching it across the room, the glass would be
shattered.
Thoughts, like vocal tones, are vibratory rates;
but they are definite vibrations in astral substance.
Nevertheless, like Caruso's voice, they have the
FOUNDATION OF THE SCIENCE 41
power to travel across space and bring·about physi-
cal changes. And like his voice, also, it is their
vibratory key, as well as their volume which deter-
mines their effect.
The key to which thoughts are tuned often can
be determined by their subject matter. But other
thoughts, which also have powerful vibratory rates,
are abstract in quality. That is, they merely desig-
nate some thing or quality. Such are names, and
such are numbers. ·
It is not the physical sound of a name or a num-
ber that is its potent influenc~; it is the thought-
vibration of the one thinking it, which radiates out-
ward from his mind to the person or thing thought
about. This vibration reaching a person thought
about influences him according to the key of the
thought. Different names and different numbers vi-
brate in different keys. Different vibratory keys pro-
duce different effects upon the objects or persons they
contact, even as do different .sounds. And, wholly
apart from any process of divination, it is the object
of the Science of Vibration as set forth in these
studies to determine the key to which names and
numbers vibrate, and how they affect the things and
people with which they become associated.
Divination by Numbers.-Because, as I have al-
ready pointed out, there are an increasing number
of methods of using numbers in divination, little
need be said about this phase of the subject here
other than to point out that all these systems of
Numerology, as well as the Hermetic System of
42 THE SACRED TAROT
Divination by Numbers, are really methods of divi-
nation. As such they possess a legitimate function.
Many of them other than the Hermetic System give
quite accurate results. But in no case should they be
considered as a Science of Vibration; for such a sci-
ence is based upon the observed effect of thought
vibratory-rates, and is something entirely apart from
any kind of divination.
Divination by Cards.-Nor is any system of lay-
ing out the cards strictly a scientific and positive
process. Like numerology, the methods of card read-
ing set forth in this Hermetic System, as well as
all other card-reading methods, are useful; but they
essentially are systems of divination.
Spiritual Science.-Now, however, when we come
to that function which sets forth a spiritual science
as a basis for a complete philosophy of life, we are
again back on positive and scientific footing.
It is true that in perfecting this science there is
recourse to the law of correspondences. Neverthe-
less, the philosophy of life derived from this science
is based upon the strict observation, by those through-
out the past ages who were most competent to ascer-
tain them by experimental methods, of spiritual facts.
Every noteworthy spiritual fact that has been uncov-
ered by the researches of the most exalted minds since
the world began, and checked as to accuracy by sub-
sequent illuminated ones, is set forth in the language
of universal symbolism in the sacred tarot. That is
why we who delve deeply into it call it Sacred. But
while the spiritual facts are thus clearly set forth,
FOUNDATION OF THE SCIENCE 43
except for certain guiding lines each is left free to
draw from them such conclusions as his state of
evolvement will permit. The facts are there, but to
us is given the task of giving them an adequate de-
tailed interpretation.
But after all, of what particular use is a spiritual
philosophy?
Because the vibrations of people thinking our
name, or our telephone number, reach us and con-
duce, through stimulating harmonious or inharmoni•
ous conditions within ourselves, to our health and
happiness, or to our failure and misery, it is easy to
see that a science of vibration which enables us to
regulate such matters is important. And, in so far
as divination gives us valuable and reliable informa-
tion, it is not difficult to understand the prevalent
interest in numerology and in card reading. But of
what value is a spiritual science, or the philosophy
derived from it?
Well, to give a proper perspective to this one of
the four chief functions of the tarot, we must make
a brief examination of life in general, and of man
in particular.
Man, for instance, like all other living entities,
possesses a strong desire to live. But the life of any
organism continues only so long as it makes success-
ful adaptation to its environment. Part of man's
environment consists of countless other forms of
life, toward which it is essential he should observe a
proper code of conduct. He must obey the impulse
of the moment seldom, but instead, consider the
44 THE SACRED TAROT
effect of his action as influencing his future welfare.
Especially is it important that he shall conduct
himself properly toward others of his kind, other-
wise conflict, or wanton depletion of food supplies,
may cause all to perish. His chances of survival are
greatly heightened when he can obtain, not the an-
tagonism, but the cooperation, of some of his fellows.
Such cooperation, however, is only made possible
by an understanding as. to mutual aims. \Vhen such
mutual aims have been established a single tribe be-
comes better equipped to attain them than any indi-
vidual, and a nation becomes superior to a tribe. Yet
members of any cooperative group who have variant
aims weaken the effectiveness of the whole. Thus
for mutual advantages, and to prevent disaster be-
falling, there must come to be a recognized standard
of conduct.
Such a code has for purpose those actions which
will confer the greatest advantages on the whole
group, and thus also confer them upon the individual
members. And the advantages striven for are deter-
mined by the knowledge of the people. But whether
those prescribed in the standard of conduct actually
contribute to the welfare of the group or not, and
to what extent, depends entirely upon how correctly
they have interpreted the true relation of one life.
form to another, and the true relation of the individ-
ual to the group. This interpretation, because actions
are based upon it, is the most dominant factor in
shaping the lives of a people. It is called their ethi-
cal standard.
FOUNDATION OF THE SCIENCE 45
Now in national life those things are advocated
which are believed to add to the richness of people's
lives, and those things considered destructive are
prohibited. Yet people have not found a means by
which physical dissolution can be postponed more
that a few short years.
After~Death Survival.-Not being able to make
the continuous adaptation to a physical environment
which would enable them to continue living upon
earth, it was quite natural that some should investi-
gate the possibility of a life in a region after physical
death. And our foremost scientific men, by means
of careful experiments, have confirmed their findings
that man does live beyond the tomb.
Yet wherever life is found, its survival and the
fullness of its existence depend upon !!Uccessful adap-
tation to environment. This same law must apply to
the after-life of man. That is, to the extent he is
able to make perfect and continuous adaptations in
that future realm, will his life there prove satisfac-
tory. Furthermore, as he has found knowledge to be
the most essential factor in his adaptation on earth,
he has a right to assume that the more knowledge he
has concerning the conditions to be encountered, and
about how difficulties are to be met and overcome,
the better he will get along in the life after .physical
death.
Many as yet are content with mere surmise as to
the conditions that there obtain. And all through
the dark ages man was content merely to surmise
how matter behaved under different circumstances.
THE SACRED TAROT
Yet the progress man has made in material ways,
the attainment of numerous comforts, and all of
what we call modern civilization, was brought about
by those who were not content with surmise, but who
set about gathering accurate knowledge about physi-
cal things.
Furthermore, ancient ruins give testimony of con-
siderable scientific achievement even before history
began. We have surpassed the ancients in these mat-
ters, it is true, and we may be able to surpass them
in that other field to which tradition and ruins alike
bear testimony, that is, in the field of spiritual sci-
ence. But if we are able to do so we must discard
surmise and substitute accurately observed phe-
nomena.
Upon the accuracy of the Chaldeans in calculating
certain celestial phenomena, modern astronomers are
forced to place considerable reliance, and to base
some of their own findings. And as to the knowledge
of astrology these same Chaldeans possessed, any-
one who will take the pains to learn to erect a birth-
chart can soon prove to himself that they had accu-
rate knowledge which is scoffod at by the abysmal
ignorance of parrot-taught scholars.
Instead of taking the rules laid down by the
ancients, and testing them by the approved methods
of experimental science, conventional intolerance does
battle with them by appealing to prejudice. And the
same dogmatic assertions are used to discredit and
block the path of anyone who makes a candid in-
vestigation of spiritual science.
FOUNDATION OF THE SCIENCE 47
It is true that mystical folly runs rampant under
the guise of occultism; but for that matter less than
three centuries ago material science was no less a
medley of confused notions and dogmatic opinions.
And it became necessary, in order to build a sound
structure for material science, to discard all that had
gone before, and build on the solid foundation of
observed facts. Upon such an unyielding foundation
the framework of scientific thought has been reared,
each timber being fitted to its proper place by the
methods of deductive thought. And so erected, it
constitutes a shelter which protects man from a
thousand and one dangers which threaten his physi-
cal survival.
But it has been unable to prolong the physical life
indefinitely, and man as of yore, looks beyond the
earth-plane to another existence after the tomb.
About this after-life much is said, but little. is com-
monly known. Yet all seem to agree that some kind
of preparation for the new condition is necessary, or
at least desirable. That is, they feel that as effort is
necessary to enable one to adapt himself to physical
life, some kind of effort must be necessary to make
successful adaptation to any life in the future. But
men do not- agree of what this preparation should
consist.
The very yearning of the human soul, therefore;
demands that there shall come into existence a spir-
itual !!Cience, a science which shall inform man defi-
nitely about the life he will be called upon to live
after he leaves the physical plane; and that will di-
THE SACRED TAROT
rect him as to the preparations which should be
made, while still on the physical plane, that will en-
able him the more successfully to adapt himself in the
realms of the future. Thus do the necessities of
man demand a spiritual science. But such a spiritual
science can be soundly constructed only on the plan
which so successfully has been used in the construc-
tion of material science. Notions must be cleared
away, surmise must be swept to one side, and a foun-
dation laid of indisputable facts quarried from the
lode of critically observed phenomena. Then upon
this foundation a framework should be erected ac-
cording to the strictest methods of logic. And if the
work thus done has been thorough there should re-
sult a shelter which is effective in protecting us from
the inclemencies encountered in any life on any plane.
In gathering this information for the foundation,
we can use the reports of the physical senses some-
what; because they have been found to give rather
accurate information as checked by practical affairs.
But they also, at times, have been found unreliable;
and thus they should be checked by those other senses,
the senses of the astral, the psychic senses. These
psychic senses also, in so far as practical experience
proves them to be accurate, should be used to gather
information. But because they also sometimes report
falsely, their findings should be checked as to accu-
racy by the physical senses. Information should be
quarried wherever it can be found, and by whatever
method can be used; but before entering into the
foundation of a spiritual science it should be tested
by every known means.
FOUNDATION OF THE SCIENCE 49
Now as to these psychic senses, about which some
people may be skeptical, bear in mind that because a
man can not track a hare by scent does not imply
that a hound can not do so. And because many
hounds fail to follow some particularly cold trail
does not prove that some other hound may not be
able to do so. The limits of one hound.'s ability is
not the measure of the ability of another hound, and
whether a particular man can do something that an-
other man can not should not be made a matter of
surmise, but subjected to experimental proof.
And thus in the application of the psychic senses;
just how reliable their reports are must be experi-
mentally determined for each individual, by subject-
ing their reports to subsequent proof. Yet when used
judiciously, and in conjunction with his physical
senses and common sense, they are found to be extra-
ordinarily valuable aids to spiritual knowledge.
In using the physical senses to gather material to
be included in the foundation of a spiritual science,
we find that there is a sympathetic relation between
objects and events upon the earth and the heavenly
bodies and their movements. No psychic faculties
are needed to prove this, as it comes directly under
the methods of physical experiment. Yet the science
of astrology, which sets forth in mathematical terms,
the relation of the heavenly bodies to things on
earth, has mostly been handed down to us from the
ancient magi. Not that we merely accept what they
have stated; but, using statistical methods upon ob-
served results, we have found their statements and
interpretations amazingly accurate.
50 THE SACRED TAROT
The same magi specialized, generation after gen-
eration, for thousands of years, in just two things:
they specialized in astrology, and they specialized in
gaining information concerning the soul of man.
In the acquisition of information on these two sub-
jects they developed their psychic senses, to a high
degree, and they kept laborious records of experi-
ments, day after day, year after year, generation
after generation.
And, in so much as the vast amount of informa-
tion which has come down to us from them concern-
ing astrology has been proved by experimental meth-
ods and modern research to be highly accurate, we
are justified, I think, in placing some confidence in
their findings where their other specialty is con-
cerned. All the more so, because they linked their
spiritual findings to astrology. Astrology, to them,
was not merely character-reading, and a means of
predicting events. It was also the science of the soul
and the key to all spiritual possibilities. It had an
exoteric side, which was applicable to the physical
affairs of life; but it also had a more important
esoteric side, which revealed the nature of the soul
and to what conditions it would be subjected in the
future.
Thus these men of all olden day formulated just
such a spiritual science as that for which we search.
They scanned the universe with highly trained psy-
chic vision, they checked the information gained in
one manner by information gained in another man-
ner; and when, as time went by, they became con-
FOUNDATION OF THE SCIENCE 51
vinced they had some spiritual treasure, by means of
correspondence, which they understood so well, they
traced this spiritual fact as a constellation in the sky.
Still further applying this principle of correspond-
ences, they attached each to a number, so that spir-
itual ideas might be combined and handled math-
ematically, even as by means of numbers we solve
the more humble problem of the family budget. And
that they might thus be handled with facility, even
as in algebra we use x, y, z, to represent more com-
plex things, they used symbols to represent the spir-
itual verities that were being considered.
For convenience in handling, these symbols, which
stood for definite spiritual ideas, were engraved on
plates. And thus it came about that each plate con-
tained, in the language of universal symbolism, the
explanation of some important spiritual fact. It ex-
plained in more detail than the pictured constellation
or the symbol of the planet, just what these men of
old had discovered. It w~s an esoteric interpretation
of the spiritual truths associated with some planet or
zodiacal sign. And attached to the plate was its cor-
responding number, so that through combining num-
bers having the same value as definite spiritual ideas,
spiritual ideas could be handled mathematically. By
combining their numerical equivalents a number could
be thus obtained which would represent the correct
resulting spiritual idea.
Now, of course, we should not accept the spiritual
findings of these ancients until they have been sub-
jected to rigorous tests. We should not accept the
52 THE SACRED TAROT
findings of either moderns or ancients as conclusive.
But because in those things where rigid tests have
been applied these men of old have proved to have
had such amazingly accurate and comprehensive
knowledge, if we were to overlook their work it
would, no doubt; make our own research far more
laborious. Let us approach the spiritual ideas they
have left us, not as conclusively proved, but in the
same manner as we approached exoteric astrology.
Let us take them, one at a time, and subject them
to proof. And if the knowledge they left us concern-
ing spiritual things compares in accurac;y with the
knowledge they left us concerning astrology, our
labors in establishing a true spiritual science will
surely be lightened.
Origin of the Tarot Cards.-Those plates upon
which, in the language of universal symbolism, the
ancients inscribed their knowledge of spiritual things
and the attainments possible to the human soul, were
called by the Egyptians, The Royal Path of Life.
In Egyptian, Tar means path, and Ro means royal,
and thus, even at this day, the plates are known
to us as the tarot.
As a part of the mysteries divulged to candidates
only after passing hazardous trials and hardships,
they have largely remained the property of secret
schools of occultism and jealously guarded by them.
What has filtered through to the public has been
rather unsatisfactory and vague, although occult stu-
dents the world over have recognized their im-
portance.
FOUNDATION OF THE SCIENCE 53
The magical wheel discovered in the thirteenth
century by Raymond Lully, which was to solve all
problems, was the tarot. In the sixteenth century,
William Postel wrote concerning it as, The Genesis
of Enoch, in a book entitled, The Key of Things
Kept Secret From the Foundation of the World.
He believed it antedated the Bible. Count de Gebe-
lin wrote concerning it, and St. Martin studied it.
Eliphas Levi wrote his masterpiece, The Dogma
and Ritual of Transcendental Magic, from studies
of it, and S. L. MacGregor Mathers, Papus, and
A. E. Waite have contributed works about it.
From this it might be conclµded that little is left
to be said about the tarot. But unfortunately for
the general public the secret schools have had no in-
tention of permitting real knowledge concerning it to
escape from their midst. Consequently, much that
has been written about the tarot has been, not for
the purpose of making clear its real significance, but
to reveil what had clandestinely escaped from the
secret schools. Even so fearless a writer as Eliphas
Levi admits this, and the few mistakes he makes in
his own writings are so glaring, and yet so near the
truth, that they can be ascribed neither to careless-
ness nor ignorance.
One of the most conscientious of mystical writers,
Mr. A. E. Waite, ..explains the matter thus:
"There is no extant ritual, as there can be no doc-
trine, which contains, or. can possibly contain, the
secret of mystical procedure or the essence of mys-
tical doctrine. The reason is not because there is, or
54 THE SACRED TAROT
can reasonably be, any indictable secret, but because
the knowledge in question is in the custody of those
who have taken effectual measures for its protection;
and though from time to time, some secrets of initia-
tion have filtered through printed books into the
world at large, the real mysteries have never
escaped."
In the Pictori?l Key to The Tarot, he further
comments: "There is a secret tradition concerning
the tarot, as well as a Secret Doctrine contained
therein; I have followed some part of it without ex-
ceeding the limits which are drawn about matters of
this kind and belong to the Laws of Honor. This
tradition has two parts, and as one of them has
passed into writing it seems to follow that it may be
betrayed at any moment, which will not signify, be-
cause the second, as I have intimated has not passed
at present and is held by very few indeed. The pur-
veyors of spurious copy and traffickers in stolen
goods may take notice of this point, if they please."
Men who follow science as a profession have a
very different code of honor. The truly scientific man
does not hold what he discovers, or what others have
discovered, merely to benefit a chosen few. It is the
code of science to give whatever information is dis-
covered to the public that not one select clique may
have an advantage, but that the whole human race
may be the gainer. And it has always seemed to me
a colossal piece of selfishness for any group of men,
if they really possessed information that might be
beneficial to all mankind, to hoard it for themselves
alone.
FOUND.A.TION OF THE SCIENCE 55
I hold, therefore, that secrecy in any matter that
will aid the soul in gaining knowledge of its true re-
lations to the universe, or that will assist in making
life happier, or the attainment of spirituality easier,
is not a virtue. Consequently, departing from the
custom of many other writers on this subject, I am
introducing no blinds and no subterfuges into these
lessons. As to traffickers in stolen goods, what I
present, in its essentials, has been in the custody of
The Brotherhood of Light for ages. But even were
it otherwise, I would not hesitate to present any in-
formation that I deem might in some manner assist
human progress and happiness, from whatever source
it might be gleaned.
The time has ceased, I trust, when a few shall
possess a monopoly on the truths regarding spiritual
things. The reader will find here all that is neces-
sary for him to know about the tarot and its Secret
Doctrine to put him on the right path, and he could
hope for no more even within the most exclusive
circles; for attainment is not vicarious.
I
As to the methods of mystical procedure so care-
fully guarded, supposed never to have been com-
mitted to writing, possessed by so very few, whose
mysteries have never escaped to the world at large;
I take pleasure in pointing out that it is the method
by whicn man reaches God directly. It ma'y be men-
tioned also that it is not the exclusive possession of
the Occident, but is known as well to initiates of the
Orient. To give the western version might be deemed
trafficking in stolen goods. Therefore, as the eastern
56 THE SACRED TAROT
interpretation is fully as valuable and accurate I will
state where it may be found:
The original work is exceedingly ancient and rare,
is inscribed on palm leaves, and found only in the
remotest parts of India and{Tartary. It is called,
The Atma Bodha, or Book o Soul Knowledge. It is
divided into three books, the second being a com-
mentary on the first. The third book contains but
seven statements which form a brief summary of the
whole subject. The work, translated into English
was possessed by members of The Hermetic Brother-
hood of Luxor (long since closed), and is fully as
lucid in explaining mystical atonement as are the
teachings on this subject of any western order. Lack
of space prevents the giving of more than the sum-
mary, the key to the whole matter ; but this medi-
tated upon in connection with the tarot will prove
quite sufficient for anyone whose spirituality is such
as to permit illumination; which is all that any out-
side help can give, although the whole work is of
utmost value.
"BOOK III"
"The Aphoresmata of The Logos"
"I. Whatever exists, exists as a Whole, as God,
or is a part, or emanation from God.
"II. In the Whole as an angel, unconscious of
the Whole, is an undescended spirit.
"HI. Parted from the Whole, yet a portion of
the Whole, and unconscious of the Whole, is the

FOUNDATION OF THE SCIENCE 57
"IV. Parted from the Whole, with the Whole,
yet external to the Whole, is a descended or fallen

"V. Parted from the Whole, with the Whole,

"VII. That which was parted from the Whole,
and has again returned to the Whole, is a part of

Tarot Correspondences.-Of the plates on which
the ancients pictured the facts they ascertained re-
garding spiritual science and universal law, which
have been handed down to us in the form of the
tarot cards, 22 are more important than the rest.
They correspon.d to the I 2 zodiacal signs and the
1o planets in the chain. And the ideas thus pictori-
ally expressed in universal symbolism later came
further to be condensed as conventional and easily
written hieroglyphics, and this is the origin of the
square-formed letter of the Hebrew and Egyptian
alphabets. And, because there were no separate char-
acters for numbers, each such s.quare-formed letter
also became the number expressing the spiritual idea
embodied in the pictured plate.
Then to still further express the numerical inter-
action of forces and ideas between the four king-
58 THE SACRED TAROT
doms of fire, earth, air and water ; a scale of ten
numerals was added, and repeated in association
with the emblem of a kingdom, giving a total of 40
additional plates, or suitcards. Each according to
its number, of course, corresponds to some astrologi-
cal subdivision of the original 22 conceptions.
All these forces, however, have an influence upon
man. He is the point where they come to a focus.
But men are not all the same, and this difference in
type is best expressed by the sign of the zodiac under
which each is born. So we have I 2 plates, or cards,
picturing people born under each of the zodiacal
signs. To express the family relation they are rep-
resented as Father, Mother and Son, pictured more
commonly as King, Queen and Youth (Jack). The
temperaments of these people are further shown by
the suits; for the fiery signs of the z~diac represent
the sanguine temperament, the watery signs the lym-
phatic temperament, the earthly signs the bilious
temperament, and the airy signs the ·nervous tem-
perament. Thus the suit denotes the temperament.
In addition to cosmic and other influences there is
another thing of importance. People have thoughts.
They are probably the most potent of all forces.
Consequently, it was essential to have them repre-
sented. .And to show their source of origm they
should be associated with people. Therefore, to de-
pict them, the ancients had recourse to a horseman ;
for the Twins, ruling the nouse of pnvate thoughts
in a natural birth-chart, were often represented on
horses; and Sagittarius, ruling the house of pub-
FOUNDATION OF THE SCIENCE 59
lically expressed thought in a natural birth-chart;
is a horseman. ·
The complete set of the tarot plates, or cards,
therefore consists of 22 Major Arcana, 40 Minor
Arcana, and I 6 Court Cards; a total of 78.
Just why each Major Arcanum is a pictorial rep-
resentation of the spiritual associations of the planet
or zodiacal sign with which it is given will be made
plain as we make a study of each.
The four members of each suit of court cards rep-
resent, in their wider application, the Hebrew name
of Deity-Jod-He-Vau-He; signifying masculine,
feminine, union, and the product. And they also
throw light upon the origin of the Holy Trinity wor-
shiped by Christianity.
In Egypt, Osiris the Father, Isis the Mother, and
Horus the Issue; were popularly worshiped; and in
addition there was a fourth deity which included the
three others, and overshadowed them, as do the
thoughts of a family, called the Holy Ghost.
So when Athenas1s came from Egypt to the Holy
Council of Nice to assist in settling of what the
orthodox Trinity consisted, he introduced the Holy
Ghost. Most contempor aneous nations, other than
the Egyptians, held merely to the Trinity of Father,
Mother and Issue. But the Holy Ghost came to
Christianity at an opportune time; for due to the
teachings of Paul, and the fanatic asceticism that
was developing, it was becoming quite certain that
woman could have no part in· anything divine.
The monks who retired to monastic life looked
upon woman as an instrument of evil, a tempting
60 THE SACRED TAROT
agent of the devil, strictly to be avoided. They
characteristically shifted the blame for all the ills of
humanity to her shoulders by teaching that the fall
of Adam was due to the guile of Eve. So, while the
Church still retained the Virgin Isis-which as the
sign Vir·go, has from time immemorial been pictured
as a virgin with a crescent Moon in her arms to
symbolize the iinmacula te conception - as the
Mother Mary, and venerated her accordingly; they
felt compelled to cut her from the Holy Trinity. In
her stead they substituted the Holy Ghost.
Yet while cutting woman from the Holy Trinity,
they were powerless to efface her from nature; and
in the common playing cards as in the tarot, she
holds her rightful place as Queen, joint ruler with
the King. But the fourth court card, still retained
in the tarot, even as the spirit of rectitude and jus-
tice which in its wider application it represents, has
departed from our midst.
Origin of the Suits.-As to the emblems by which
the four suits are recognized, they were derived as
universal symbols from the most important of natu-
ral phenomena, the passing of the seasons.
Even as.heralded in the verses of Omar, the spring
is signaled by the r.ose. In certain older cards the
rose is sometimes found. The spring.is the period of
renewed life, and thus the rose, as representing it,
in some mystical orders, is the symbol of a renewed
life. Spring brought a new food supply, which nour-
ished life. But this food supply, by which life might
be sustained also might be purchased. And thus we
have the pieces of money, the coins of the tarot. But
FOUNDATION OF THE SCIENCE 61
in later days a more commercial age decided that for
sustaining life through trade, diamonds were even
more precious than money. So in modern cards we
have the suit of diamonds.
The summer· brought the trefoil, or three-leaf
clover, which was important for forage to the flocks
of a pastoral people. So the clover became associ-
ated with the heat of summer. A similar heat could
be produced with wood. And thus scepters came to
be the symbol of summer heat, and are so repre-
sented in the tarot. Moderns, however, continue to
picture the clover, but refer to the wood still, calling
it the suit of clubs.
The autumn, when the wine was pressed from the
grape, came to be the season of festivities, of danc-
ing and of marriage. To represent the emotions
then engendered, the cup, from which the wine was
quaffed, came to be used, and thus is still one of the
suits of the tarot. But moderns, associating the emo-
tions of joy, and those that result in marriage, with
the heart, have preferred to use them in picturing
the corresponding suit of playing cards.
The winter was a time of dearth and want. To
provide for this period when no food could be gar-
nered, it was customary to work hard to gather and
hoard a supply sufficient to last through until spring.
And it was observed that the oak also thus provided
a food supply which was similarly stored by the
squirrels. Thus the acorn came to be used as the
symbol of winter. But, in time, the afflictions of
winter, and the struggle to sustain life, especially as
THE SACRED TAROT
it often led to strife among peoples, came to be de-
picted by the emblem of strife, the sword. Yet a still
later people looked upon the unfruitful season as the
cause of their unceasing toil; and to depict this, used
the modern emblem of toil, the shovel, or spade as
it is called in modern playing cards.
Thus the balmy air of spring is represented by
coins, the fire of summer by scepters, the bibulous
festivities of autumn by cups, and the hardships of
winter by swords. Therefore, we must consider that
coins correspond to the airy signs, scepters to the
fiery signs, cups to the watery signs, and swords to
the earthy signs, of the zodiac.
Making the Spread. - W h e n the unconscious
mind has its attention focused on obtaining certain
information, the psychic senses are active to obtain
that information. And because of the vastly wider
scope of their power, due to the properties of inner-
plane existence where they function, they are able
to acquire information quite inaccessible without
their aid. This information then resides in the astral
brain as a memory. T hat is, it is a meII).ory of what
has been gathered astrally.
The tarot cards afford both a means by which
the attention of the soul is directed to acquiring such
information, and a means by which this information,
which then exists as a memory in the astral brain, can
be raised into the region of objective consciousness.
One who has experience with the tarot cards will
become .convinced that there is some power present,
not merely that directs how they shall be read, but
FOUNDATION OF THE SCIENCE 63
that actually directs their distribution so that they
will give a correct reading. Extra-sensory perception
is able to observe their positions in the pack as shuf-
fled. And extra-physical power (now demonstrated
in our universities as the Psychokinetic Effect) in co-
operation with the unconscious muscular activities
of the shuffler, tends to arrange the cards in shuffling,
and so to cut the pack, that when dealt they shall
fall in positions to give the information desired. Full
details of this process are set forth in lessons No.
I I 8, No. 119, and No. I 20, in the course on di-
vination (Course XI) .
The first essential of a _
reading is that there shall
be a strong and unprejudiced desire to know some-
thing. If other strong desires or preconceived opin-
ions intrude during the shuffling and reading of the
cards, they will warp the reading· from the truth.
The mind should be concentrated on obtaining a cor-
rect answer.
While the mind is so occupied, the cards should
be shuffled in such a manner as not merely to re-
arrange them in the deck, hut to reverse the ends of
some. They should then be cut into three piles and
gathered again into a pack. This shuffling and cut-
ting should be repeated three times; and then the
cards dealt, face downward. They are turned over
from top to bottom, but turned over only one at a
time, as read.
Yes or No? -To answer a question Yes or No,
five cards are dealt in a single row, from right to
left. The middle card counts 2 and the other cards
THE SACRED TAROT
each count I. A majority of the counts right end up
is an affirmative answer. A majority of the counts
wrong way up is a negative answer. If the right way
up and the wrong way up are evenly divided, it is a
draw, and the answer is undecided.
Seven cards dealt in a row in this manner, from
right to left, will answer a question briefly, and nine
so arranged will give greater detail. The present of
the matter is revealed by the middle card. The con-
ditions or events leading up to it are signified by the
cards commencing at the right. The cards commenc-
ing at the left of the middle and moving to the last
one on the left, show the conditions and events per-
taining to the matter in the future.

SCOPE AND USE OF TAROT
AMBLICHUS, a Neo-platonist of the
fourth century and an initiate of The
Brotherhood of Light, has left us an im-
portant document entitled, An Egyptian
Initiation.
It contains an account of the trials of initiation,
and of certain information given to the neophyte
while passing these tests, in the Mysteries of Ancient
Egypt. The different steps in this initiation as thus
described, and what each step signifies, are set forth
in full detail in lesson No. 1.
At one point in his journey the candidate is stopped
before 22 frescoed paintings which picture the 22
Major Arcana of the tarot, and it becomes his duty
to commit to memory these pictures, as well as their
symbolism, which is then explained to him. As these
pictures1 together with such of their symbolism as is
then explained to the neophyte, are fully described
by Iamblichus, his work affords an accurate descrip-
tion of the Egyptian Tarot.
An Egyptian Initiation was translated from the
original MS. into French by P. Christian, and those
who have written much of value concerning the tarot
have drawn heavily upon his translation. In 1901 it
was translated into English, for private circulation,
by my friend Genevieve Stebbins. And I am indebted
to her for permission to use her translation of the
description of the Egyptian Tarot.

SCOPE AND USE OF TAROT 71
In these lessons I have faithfully followed the
description of the plates, the meaning of the symbols
found upon the Major Arcana, and the interpreta-
tion of the Arcana in each of the three worlds, just
as given· in the translation of Genevieve Stebbins;
and also the admonition after each Arcanum which
runs, "Remember, then, son of earth," etc.
The Admonition. -As to this admonition, al-
though it probably will be used seldom by tarot stu-
dents, I have thought it better not merely to include
it, but to preserve it without change. It is a part of
the old initiation ceremony, and may serve a more
important function in the future than can now be
discerned.
Mod er n translators of the old square-formed
alphabet have changed the numerical value of some
letters, and have transposed some letters. And mod-
ern astronomers, thinking to be more scientific, have
sought to abolish the pictured constellations in the
sky, using areas not identical in space and bounded
by straight lines. Yet the original connotation of
each letter revealed its vibratory significance and
astrological relationship; and the original picture
which each constellation presented revealed, as fully
set forth in Course VII on Spiritual Astrology, the
spiritual teaching it was designed to convey to later
gener.ations. Obeying an old Masonic command to
"Alter not the ancient landmarks," The Brother-
hood of Light has preserved the original vibratory
significance of the letters, and here faithfully repro-
duces the Egyptian Tarot, including the admonition
associated with each Major Arcanum.
THE SACRED TAROT
This admonition has a practical application both
in card-reading and in astrology. Usually in a tarot
spread, there is one card which is the key to the
situation, or which indicates the individual for whom
the reading is being given, or, perhaps, what this
individual should do. And in a birth-chart, or in a
horary figure, some sign or planet usually indicates
the person for whom the reading is being given.
When, therefore, it is desired to give an admonition
to this person, the admonition given below the Ar-
canum which is the key influence in the spread, or
indicates the person, may be used. And the admoni-
tion given below the Arcanum which corresponds
to the dominant sign or planet in an astrological
chart may be used in a like manner.
Correspondences. -The corresponding letter and
number are a part of the translation of An Egyptian
Initiation. But in order to handle the cards in the
solution of any conceivable problem, as wide a range
of accurate correspondences to the principles depicted
by the Major Arcana as possible should be at hand.
I have, therefore, given the astrological correspond-
ence of each Major Arcanum. In the past this has
been attempted in a·desultory manner by one or two
others, but those who attempted this were quite ig-
norant of astrology. My own familiarity with astrol-
ogy dates from the year I 900, and by virtue ·of teach-
ing it for years in class-work and writing courses of
lessons on its various branches, which have become
standard works upon the subject, I feel that I can
speak in this matter with some authority. In these
lessons the astrological correspondences of the tarot
SCOPE AND USE OF TAROT 73
cards are given correctly in writing for the first time.
In addition, I have added the corresponding color,
corresponding musical tone, corresponding occult
science, corresponding human function, correspond-
ing natural remedy and corresponding mineral, to
each Arcanum.
The System of Presentation. -In order that the
student shall have at hand concrete explanations of
the application of the tarot, examples which he can
use as models to follow in his own researches, after
each Major Arcanum I have given some application
of the principle which the arcanum represents in ten
different domains as follows:
I. Number: The numerical significance of the prin-
ciple is stated.
2. Astrology: It is shown why the principle pic-
tured by the arcanum inevitably corresponds to a cer-
tain planet or ·zodiacal sign.
3. Human Function: It is poi~ted out which one
of man's various forms and activities are expressions
of the principle.
4. Alchemy: How this principle, indicated by the
arcanum, operates in alchemical procedure.
5. Bible: As an aid to Bible studies, and the inter-
pretation of allegories by means of the tarot, Bible
passages are quoted which are exemplifications of the
principle pictured in the arcanum.
6. Masonry: To aid the Masonic student to use
the tarot to gain the esoteric meaning of his rituals,
it is shown what Masonic teaching is conveyed by the
arcanum.
74 THE SACRED TAROT
7. Magic: In magic, also, the tarot is a valuable
aid; and some magical principle corresponding to the
arcanum being considered is set forth.
8. Initiation: If I were to omit examples of the use
of the tarot in pointing out the steps in the soul's
pilgrimage, it would be sadly remiss. This most valu-
able application is illustrated in connection with each
arcanum.
9. Occult Science: For those who desire to use the
tarot in special occult studies, the correspondence to
some occult science is given under each arcanum.
10. Minor Arcana and Court Arcana: As a transi-
tion function, it is shown why the exoteric divinatory
significance of the Minor Arcana are derived from
their numerical relation to the Major r\rcana, and
how their esoteric and more spiritual significance de-
rives from a corresponding decanate-division of the
zodiac; also how the Court Arcana acquire their sig-
nificance from the zodiacal signs.
And in addition to these examples of the use of
the tarot, the lessons give instructions in the science
of vibration, in divination by numbers, and after each
second Major Arcanum there is given a different
method of spreading and reading the cards.
If, however, the student goes no further than what
is explained in these lessons, he has merely learned
the fundamentals of the use of the tarot; for -in the
treatment here the attempt is to give accurate infor-
mation, and to set forth examples, to the end of
establishing proper methods of procedure which the
student can apply at greater length in his own re-
searches.
SCOPE AND USE OF TAROT 75
Different Tarot Packs.-The Egyptian Tarot pic-
tures illustrated and described in these lessons, teach
in still greater detail the same spiritual ideas that are
taught by the constellations. .Both constellations in
the sky-the stars of which usually offer not the
slightest suggestion of the design pictured-and the
Tarot pictures adorning the walls of the ancient
Egyptian initiation chamber, make use of primitive
symbolical pictograph writing to convey the most
important things the ancient wise ones had found out
about the human soul. The Egyptian Tarot, then,
portrays the spiritual conceptions of the Egyptian
initiates, as derived from a still more remote past.
Tb,ere is a peculiar sympathy, however, between the
thoughts of man and actions for which he finds no
rational motive. That is, the same sympathy that
exists between the happenings on earth and the posi-
tions of the planets in the sky also manifests through
the unconscious mind.
If we but analyze our dreams we shall find that
symbolism is the common language of the unconscious
mind. And the successful use of the tarot cards as
instruments of divination depends upon their sympa-
thetic response to invisible factors of intelligence. So
it would be indeed strange if they responded merely
in the transitory laying of the spread, and not also in
their symbolism to the minds of those who handle
them.
When, therefore, the Tarot cards came into the
hands of a people with a different conception of life,
it would be remarkable if, at least in those tenets
wherein they felt most strongly, the pictures on the
THE SACRED TAROT
cards were not changed sufficiently to portray these
intense convictions.
Gypsy fortune-telling cards differ markedly from
the Egyptian Tarot pack, but I am sure their sym-
bolism is more correct in portraying the Gypsy phi-
losophy and the Gypsy mode of life.
English, German, Italian and French packs differ
from each other, because of national characteristics,
and from the Egyptian and Gypsy cards because
Christianity has made its impress upon them. But
each pack, ·through that sympathetic response to the
minds of those who use it, more correctly than the
others, portrays in symbolical pictograph the deeper
convictions of those who have thus somewhat altered
its designs. _
Even the playing cards, which .are derived from
the Tarot, show variations from the Tarot quite
characteristic of their constant use as instruments of
gambling.
To indicate more clearly what I mean, consider
that in one of the best English packs the knight
(horseman) of swords is an armored crusader, dash-
ing across the frontier into another's domain in the
well-known effort to spread enlightenment by means
of the sword. The picture suggests instantly the con-
quest of far-flung empires and the forceful dissemina-
tion of Christian creeds among the benighted heath-
ens thus conquered.
Variations of quite as important significance are to
be found on almost every card in the different tarot
packs; but I shall be content with indicating one more,
which is, perhaps; the most striking of all.
SCOPE AND USE OF TAROT 77
The Egyptian In.itiates believed justice to be the
operation of an undeviating natural law. The num·
her 8, by its two loops, is a symbolical pictograph of
the two pans of the scales. The number 8 also rep-
resents an equal division; two realizations (4's) in
equilibrium. In the Egyptian pack, the number 8 is
attached to the Major Arcanum picturing the God-
dess of Justice holding the balances in her hand, and,
even as in the picture adorning the front of our court
houses, Justice is pictured blindfolded, to signify that
she is unprejudiced and not subject to bribery.
The Jews, however, believed that they were a
chosen people; that Jehovah was a God of favoritism
who could be cajoled into granting unmerited re-
wards to those who gained His good graces. Chris-
tianity inherited the same idea. In many Christian
packs, therefore, we find Justice, although holding
the balances, not associated with 8, but with Ir. Be-
cause the scale of digits is complete with 9; and ro,
by adding the circle of spirit, commences a new
gamut on a higher plane, we have no difficulty in
conceiving I I as a force operating from the spiritual
plane. But as the digits of I 1 can never be equally
divided, rewards, according to this Christian concep-
tion, are never exactly according to merit. They are
meted out from above, not according to the Egyptian
belief in an undeviating and blind law, but according
to the whim of some higher power.
To make this conception of Divine Justice even
more obvious, which seems to be patterned after the
kind prevalent in some courts of earth, in these vari-
THE SACRED TAROT
ous Christian packs the eyes of Justice are riot blind-
folded, but wide open to prejudice.
It is not that one pack is better or worse than
another, but that each pack of tarot cards has been
unconsciously modified by the philosophy of life of
those who designed it.
THE MAGUS. -Arcanum I. Letter: Egyptian,
Athoim; Hebrew, Aleph; English, A. Number 1.
Astrologica,lly, the planet Mercury. Color, violet.
Tone, B. Occult science, esoteric psychology. Human
function, the spiritual body. Natural remedy, men-
tal treatments. Mineral, the metal mercury.
A-1 expresses in the spiritual world, Absolute
Being, which contains, and from which emanates, the
infinity of pqssibilities.
In the intellectual world, unity, principle and syn-
thesis of numbers, and the will principle of acts.
In the physical world, man the highest placed of
relative being, who is called upon to raise himself
by a perpetual expansion of his faculties in the con-
centric spheres of the Absolute.
Remember, then, son of earth, that man should,
like God, act without ceasing. To will nothing and
do nothing is more fatal than to will and do ill. If
the Magus should appear in the prophetic signs of
thy horoscope, it announces that a firm will and
faith in yourself, guided by reason and a love of jus-
tice will conduct you to the end that you wish to at-
tain and will preserve you from the peri_
ls of the way.
In Divination, Arcanum I may be read briefly as
\Vill or Dexterity.
SCOPE AND USE OF TAROT 79
Arcanum I is pictured by a Magus, type of the
perfect man, that is to say, in full possession of his
moral and physical faculties. He is represented
standing; it is the attitude of will which precedes
action. His robe is white, image of purity, original
or regained. A serpent biting its own tail serves
him for a girdle; it is the symbol of eternity which
alone circumscribes his endeavors. His forehead is
girt with a circle of gold. Gold signifies light, and
the circle expresses the universal circumference in
which gravitate all created things.
The right hand of the Magus holds a scepter of
gold, surmounted by a circle representing spirit;
symbol of the authority conferred by spiritual at-
tainment. He raises it toward heaven in the sign
of aspiration to science, wisdom and force.
Above is a four-pointed star, its rays extending
heavenward; it is the over-shadowing genius of his
spiritual master directing his efforts and counseling
him in his upward struggles. The left hand extends
the index finger to the earth to show that the mis-
sion of the perfect man is to reign over the material
world. This double gesture also expresses that the
human will should reflect the Divine Will in order
to procure good and prevent evil.
Before the l\1agus, upon a cubic stone, are placed
a cup, a sword, and a piece of gold money in the
center of which is engraved a cross. The cup sig-
nifies the mixture of the passions which contribute
to happiness and unhappiness according as we are
their masters or their slaves. The sword signifies
So THE SACRED TAROT
the work, the struggle which traverses obstacles, and
the trials which sorrow submits us to. The coin,
sign of determined value, is the symbol of realized
aspirations, of work accomplished; and shows the
sun of power conquered by the perseverance and
efficacy of the will. The cross, seal of the infinite,
by which the coin is marked, announces the ascension
of that power in the spheres of the future. The cube
upon which these symbols rest typifies the physical
world; and has graven on its side an ibis, to indicate
that eternal vigilance is a necessity if physical limi-
tations are to be surmounted.
Number.-Numerically, 1 expresses the absolute.
It is also the starting point of all measurements, and
suggests infinite possibilities. All that is proceeds
from one cosmos, which contains all, and to which
all ultimately must return.
One is a synthesis, for nothing can be thought of
without parts. It is the universal principle of exist-
ence, the creative intelligence of Deity, the motive
force of the u11.iverse, which in man becomes will.
In the macrocosm it stands for unlimited potential-
ity, and in man for relative potency. It_ expresses
the law of the conservation of energy and the inde-
structibility of matter.
Astrology.-The commencement of all work is
its formulation, and this is a mental activity. Before
the universe became manifest it was conceived within
the spaces of the Divine Mind, from whence it was
launched into objective evolution by the power of
SCOPE AND USE OF TAROT 81
creative thought. Thus does mental activity corre-
spond to number I .
A Magus is one skilled in magic. And magic is
performed chiefly through the creation and vitaliza-
tion of mental images. The Magus, therefore, is
one in whom the power of the mind has been highly
developed, and as in astrology mental ability comes
under the rulership of the planet Mercury, this
planet must correspond to both 1 and the Magus of
Arcanum I.
Thus does Arcanum I represent the creative en-
ergy being directed intelligently, in distinction to the
2nd decave of I, which is pictured by Arcanum X,
the planet Uranus, representing the one universal
force unrestrained. It also differs markedly from
the 3rd decave of I, pictured by Arcanum XIX,
correspor:iding to the zodiacal sign Leo, represent-
ing the application of this energy to the attainment
of happiness and the elaboration of domestic bliss.
In these three Arcana, each picturing the one uni-
versal virile force being used on a different plane, we
have a complete commentary on the necessity of us·-
ing the creative energies properly if any high de-
gree of spirituality is to be attained. Without viril-
ity, without an abundance of creative power, nothing
of importance caa be accomplished in any field. Yet
if this creative energy is generated in abundance and
is permitted to act without proper guidance, it brings
many abrupt changes in fortune, and through insta-
bility prevents little worth while being accomplished.
If it is directed into mental channels alone it yields
82 THE SACRED TAROT
intellectual power. But when diverted into refined
emotions such as true love and holy aspirations, it
furnishes a power which attracts to the soul the
highest spiritual bliss.
Human Function.-The spiritual body of man is
constructed by states of consciousness having in-
tensity enough to affect spiritual substance. Man does
not possess a spiritual body merely by virtue of being
man. He possesses it when, through the rnfinement
of his thoughts and aspirations he has provided en-
ergy of a proper quality to build it. And only when
the creative energies are active is there generated
enough power, if it can be directed by ecstatic emo-
tions, quickly to build anything on any plane. By a
proper mental attitude toward them, all experiences
may be made to contribute to this finer form. But
to build anything on any plane quickly, there must
be an abundance of the proper kind of energy, and
this applies to the building of a spiritual body as
well as to more material things.
Alchemy.-In alchemy, Arcanum I represents the
most important of all discoveries, the philosopher's
stone. Tradition informs us that any object touched
with this stone is converted into gold.
This touchstone of alchemy is Truth; for ,....-hen
truth is pressed against anyt-hing its eternal prin-
ciples are revealed, and these all-enduring qualities
thus obtained constitute the gold of their underlying
nature. Truth is correct knowledge, and this correct
knowledge, if comprehensive, embraces the proper
relation of souls and things to all other entities and
SCOPE AND USE OF TAROT 83
forces. Thus truth is a freeing and transmuting
power, a feeling as well as an intellectual perception.
And when fully realized it results in deep aspiration,
and in an unutterable longing and determination for
a more perfect life.
Bible. -Even as Arcanum I is the opening page of
The Book of Thoth, as the Egyptians sometimes
called the tarot, so the Bible also opens with the prin-
ciple of creative activity: Gen. I :I; "In the begin-
ning God created the heaven and the earth."
It is a principle especially revered by the Jews,
constantly referred to throughout the Bible. Nor
has it been entirely ignored in the New Testament,
for the last chapter of the last book contains a
clear, even if brief, exposition of Arcanum I.
Rev. 22 :13; "I am the Alpha and Omega, the
beginning and the end, the first and the last."
Masonry.-The E.A. degree of Masonry is found-
ed upon Arcanum I. This Arcanum repr!!sents the
candidate who has been admitted into the Lodge,
presented with the Masonic implements, and pre-
pared to undergo initiation.
Magic.-Arcanum I indicates the importance of
thorough preparation before any feat of magic is
attempted. Every principle involved, and every im-
plement used, should also be fully understood. The
chief implements, including the magic wand, are de-
picted. The scepter indicates that the virility of
some intelligence, either on this plane or another, is
back of all magical phenomena. The star indicates
THE SACRED TAROT
the participation of an intelligence from another
plane in the work.
In magic there are four opera,tions, which are here
symbolized by the four implements; the first opera-
tion, that of formulation, which means building the
thing clearly in the mind, is also represented by the
arcanum as a whole.
Initiation.-In the soul's pilgrimage Arcanum I
represents the stage . in which manhood has been
attained and self-consciousness realized. He has
learned the transitory and illusive nature of physical
possessions, and has placed his· feet once for all
upon the road leading ultimately to adeptship. He
realizes that success depends entirely upon his own
efforts. In his aspirations he has raised his vibra-
tions so that he tunes in on an intelligence of the
spiritual plane, as signified by the star, and at criti-
cal times asks and receives guidance from this source.
He moves forward· henceforth with supreme confi-
dence and sustained by an unwavering determination.
Occult Science. -The science of esoteric psychol-
ogy embraces the complete field of mental activity;
not merely on the physical plane, but on all planes
where intelligence has expression.
The ancients placed so great importance upon the
development of will power that they formulated a
science of the will, the various phases of which each
have a correspondence to one of the Major Arcana
of the tarot. In expressing this, the name of each
major card is taken as the emblem of some special
principle involved. This science of the will, as given
in An Egyptian Initiation, is as follows:
SCOPE AND USE OF TAROT 85
"In uniting successfully the twenty-two significa-
tions which emanate from these symbols, their en-
semble is summed up in the term, The Synthesis of
Magic."
"The human Will ( 1), enlightened by Science ( 2) ,
and manifested by Action (3), creates the Realiza-
tion (4), of a power which it uses or abuses accord-
ing to good or bad Inspiration ( 5), in the circle
which has been traced for it by the laws of universal
order. After having surmounted the Trial ( 6),
which has been imposed by Divine Wisdom, he will
enter by his Victory (7), into possession of the work
it has created, and establishing his Equilibrium ( 8),
upon the axis of Prudence ( 9) , he will rule the oscil-
lations of Fortune ( 10).
"The Force ( 1I), of man, sanctified by Sacri-
fice ( 12) , which is the voluntary offer of himself
upon the altar of devotion or expiation, triumphs
over death. This divine Transformation ( 13), raises
him beyond the tomb into the serene region of in-
finite progress and opposes the reality of Initiative
( 14), to the eternal falsehood of Fatality (I 5).
The course of time is marked by Ruins ( I 6), but
beyond every ruin one sees reappear the dawn of
Hope ( I 7), or the twilight of Deception ( 18).
"Unceasingly, man aspires to that which ever
flees from him, and the Sun of Happiness (I 9), will
only rise for him beyond the Tomb ( 20), after the
renewal of his being by death, which opens to him
a higher sphere of \Vill, Intelligence and Action.
"Every will that lets itself be governed by the in-
86 THE SACRED TAROT
stincts of the flesh abdicates its liberty and is bound
to the Expiation ( 22), of its errors. On the con-
trary, every will which unites itself to Deity in order
to manifest truth and work justice, enters even in this
life, into a participation of divine power over beings
and things, Recompence ( 2I), eternal of Freed
Spirits (o)."
I not only earnestly recommend to all students that
they commit the above summary of the Major Ar-
cana to memory and meditate upon it frequently, but
that they use it as a mantram. It contains vastly
more of truth and power than appears upon the sur-
face, and used as a mantram has been singularly
potent in establishing self-confidence and in building
up positiveness ,and constructive power of will.
The Relation of Minor Arcana to Major Arcana.
-As previously indicated, the suit of Scepters, which
in common playing cards is the suit of Clubs, symbol-
izes the element fire. This in human life becomes en-
thusiasm, ambition and enterprise. Consequently,
this suit belongs to the department of life having to
do with business, occupation, station, honor and pro-
fession. In astrology, it is represented by the M.C.,
where the sun appears at noon.
The suit of Cups, which in common playing cards
becomes the suit of Hearts, represents the element
water, symbol of the emotions and typical of domes-
tic and affectional relations. It thus broadly corre-
sponds to the western angle of a birth-chart, where
the sun sinks below the horizon.
The suit of Swords, which in common playing
SCOPE AND USE OF TAROT 87
cards becomes the suit of Spades, represents the ele-
ment earth, symbol of struggle, allied to affliction and
death. It thus corresponds to the Nadir, where the
sun is in its grave, or lowest point in the diurnal cycle.
The suit of Coins, which in common playing cards
becomes the suit of Diamonds, represents the ele-
ment air, the breath of life. Air is merely one form
of food, although the most essential of all. The other
foods may be purchased with money, and thus money
has become the symbol of life itself. It therefore
corresponds to the Ascendant of a birth-chart, where
the new-born sun each day rises above the eastern
horizon.
The Aces.-In astrology, Mercury is general sig-
nificator of study, writing, correspondence and travel.
As the Aces correspond numerically to Mercury, in
their more common divinatory significance they re-
late to one of these things, according to the particular
department of life signified by the suit. But in their
application to higher planes, they reveal the influence
of, and. can be interpreted by, the first dycanate of
each zodiacal triplicity, starting, of course, with the
movable signs.
The divinatory significance of the Ace of Scepters
is news of a business opportunity; its inner interpre-
tation is ACTIVITY.
The divinatory significance of the Ace of Cups is
a letter from a loved one; its inner interpretation is
MOODS.
The divinatory significance of the Ace of Coins is
a short journey; its inner significance is POLICY.
88 THE SACRED TAROT
The"divinatory significance of the Ace of Swords
is news of sickness or death; its inner interpretation
is ORGANIZATION.
VEILED ISIS. -Arcanum II. Letter: Egyptian,
Beinthin; Hebrew, Beth; English, B. Number 2.
Astrologically, the zodiacal sign Virgo. Color, the
d11rker shades of violet. Tone, low B. Occult science,
the· doctrine of signatures. Human function, clair-
voyance. Natural remedy, such herbs as barley, oats,
rye, wheat, privet, succory, skullcap, woodbine,
valerian, millet and endive. Mineral, the talismanic
gem Jasper, and among stones the flints.
B-2 expresses in the spiritual world, the con-
sciousness of Absolute Being, which embraces the
three terms of all manifestation; the past, the pres-
ent, and the future. ,
In the intellectual world, the binary, reflection of
unity; and the perception of things visible and in-
visible.
In the physical world, woman the mold of man,
uniting herself with him in order to accomplish an
equal destiny.
Remember, then, son of earth, that the mind is
enlightened in seeking God with the eyes of the will.
God has said, "Let there be Light," and light inun-
dated space. Man should say, "Let truth show itself
and good come to me." And if man possesses a
healthy will, he will see the truth shine, and guided
by it will attain all to which he aspires. If Veiled
Isis should appear in the prophetic signs of thy horo-
scope, strike resolutely at the door of the future and
SCOPE AND USE OF TAROT 89
it will open to you; but study for a long time the door
you should enter. Turn your face toward the sun of
justice, and the knowledge of the true will be given
you. Keep silent in regard to your intentioi:s, so as
not to be influenced by the contradictions of men.
In Divination, Arcanum II may briefly be read as
Science.
Arcanum lI is figured by a woman seated at the
threshold of the Temple of Isis. She is seated be-
tween two columns, the one on her right being red
to signify pure spirit and its lumi110us ascension over
matter, and the one on her left being black to repre-
sent the bondage of matter over the impure.
The woman is crowned by a tiara of three stories
surmounted by a lunar crescent. From the tiara a
veil falls over her face. She wears upon her bosom
the symbol of the .planet Mercury, and carries upon
her knees an open book which she half covers with
lier mantle. This symbolic ensemble personifies oc-
cult science, which awaits the initiate at the thresh-
old of the sanctuary of Isis in order to tell him the
secrets of universal nature. The symbol of l\tiercury
(Hermes) upon the bosom of the Virgin, signifies
that matter is fecundated by spirit in order to evolve
mind, or soul. The cross below is matter, the circle
is spirit. Together they figure the lingam of the
Hindus, representing the union of the sexes; and
the crescent above the union of spirit and matter
represents the soul which is the evolved product of
their union.
The seal on the breast of Nature also expresses
THE SACRED TAROT
the thought that knowledge comes from God and
is as limitless as its source. The veil falling over
the face announces that Nature· reveals her truths
only to the pure in heart, and hides them from the
curious and profane. The book half hidden under
the mantle signifies that but half of the truth can
be discerned by the physical senses, the exoteric side.
The esoteric, or other half, must be apprehended
through the application of the psychic senses. Rea-
son, divorced from intuition, can discern only in the
realm of effects; but re-wed to intuition, can remove
the obscuring mantle from Nature's most secret page
and pursue her mysteries at leisure.
These mysteries are revealed only in solitude, to
the sage who meditates in silence in the full and calm
possession of himself. The tiara represents the pow-
er of the intellect to penetrate the three realms of
existence-physical, astral and spiritual-which are
signified by its stories. The lunar crescent, symboliz-
ing the feminine attribute, is above the tiara to indi-
cate t-hat in occult science the intellect should be
guided by the intuitional, or psychic powers. That is
to say, in the occult sciences the feminine qualities of
the mind are often of superior value to the mascu-
line, or rational.
The woman is seated to show that Will united to
Science is Immovable.
Number.-Numerically, 2 expresses polarity. It
suggests night and day, inhalation and exhalaticn,
heat and cold. In fact, the most evident thing in
existence is duality, truth itself being dual, esoteric
SCOPE AND USE OF TAROT 91
and exoteric, the truth of the real and the·truth of
appearances.
Astrology.-Veiled Isis is none other than the
immaculate Virgin who becomes a mother through
union with the Holy Spirit. She sits in the doorway
of the temple of Nature, veiling the knowledge that
can only be gained through union, as depicted in
Arcanum III. Arcanum II represents science. This
is the harvest of experiences which have become
assimilated as knowledge. Virgo is a scientific zodi-
acal sign, and it rules both the harvest and the proc-
esses of assimilation.
Human Function.-Mind implies perception, and
chief among the perceptive faculties is the sense of
sight. Both the mind and sight are ruled by the
planet Mercury, and l\1ercury also rules two zodi-
acal signs. When the sun is shining physical sight
becomes available, but in the darkness of night the
inner sight may be more effective. And as the night
sign of Mercury is Virgo, it indicates that both this
sign and Arcanum II correspond to the inner sense of
sight, to clairvoyance.
Alchemy.-Alchemically, Arcanum II is the uni-
versal solvent which, when properly used! can be
made to reduce any metal to its first matter. Ray-
mond Lully says in regard to this:
"Metals can not be transmuted ... in the minerals,
unless they be reduced into their first matter ...
Therefore I counsel you, 0 my friends, that you do
not work but about Sol and Luna, reducing them
into their first matter, our Sulphur and Argent Vive."
92 THE SACRED TAROT
This means, in plain English, that in smelting ores
the lowest melting point is obtained by mixing them
so that the amount of acid is exactly equal to the
amount of alkali; and that in fluxing experiences,
when the polar opposites are exactly equal their
vibratory rate is raised to a point in which transmu-
tation is more readily accomplished.
Bible.-The most notable mention of Arcanum II
in the Bible is the story of the Virgin Mary.
Many nations of antiquity were familiar with the
tradition of the immaculate conception; and the
Christian aceount was borrowed directly from Egypt,
where the Jews at one time were held captive and
became familiar with traditional lore. For thousands
of years in Egypt it was taught that Isis, conceiving
immaculately, gave birth to Horus, the Sun God.
The Egyptian Virgin is often depicted with a New
Moon in her arms, instead of the baby Jesus, which
was substituted when Isis became an object of Chris-
tian adoration.
The inner meaning of the immaculate conception
is that matter, or the feminine principle in nature, is
impregnated by spirit, or the positive principle. The
gestation which follows is evolution, which finally
results in the birth of man, who possesses an im-
mortal soul and the potentiality of becoming a god.
Masonry. - The F. C. degree of 1\1 as on r y is
founded upon Arcanum II. The two Masonic pil-
lars, Jachin and Boaz, are prominently pictured at
the entrance to Solomon's Temple.
Magic.-In magic, Arcanum II depicts the prin-
SCOPE AND USE OF TAROT 93
ciple of reception, which is the polar opposite of the
principle indicated in Arcanum I. It is the feminine
reaction of the magical agent, and teaches us the
·androgyne nature of the astral light.
It is further exemplified in the production of physi-
cal phenomena by mental means; for in order thus to
move physical objects-a process now recognized by
university scientists as the PK (Psychokinetic) Ef-
fect-there must be organic electromagnetism pres-
ent of sufficient volume to make the contact and do
the work. Organic electromagnetism tends to take
whatever form, and to do whatever work, it is direct-
ed to do by the mental energy associated with it.
The ectoplasm of a materializing medium is an
impressive example of this. The electromagnetism
present is employed by the directing intelligence to
convert some of the material of the medium's body
temporarily into a plastic fluid outside the medium's
form. This plastic substance can then be molded into
whatever image the directing intelligence holds in
mind. Electromagnetism is the magical agent which
forms the connecting link between mind and matter.
And it must always be present in suffident volume
whenever material conditions are affected by the
action of mind.
Initiation.-In the pilgrimage of the soul Ar-
canum II represents a definite point in both the de-
scending and the ascending arc of the cycle. In in-
volution it represents the differentiation of the twin
souls of one ego into opposite polarities. This takes
place in the paradisiacal realm (highest spiritual
94 THE SACRED TAROT
state), just preceding their fall, as Adam and Eve,
into material conditions.
In the upward cycle it signifies that point in initia-
tion where it is realized that man or woman alone
are not complete, but require another soul of oppo-
site sex; and that reason alone is not sufficient with
the aid of the physical senses to solve the problems
of life, but that intuition and the psychic senses must
be developed before adeptship is reached.
Occult Science.-Astrological Signatures is the
science of the correspondences between celestial in-
fluences and other things. The soul of each life-form
had a point of differentiation from which it departed
on its cyclic journey, and this point of departure is
within the spiritual vortex of one of the seven plan-
etary families. Thus the soul of any living thing
responds more strongly to the vibrations of one par-
ticular planet, which is its ruler. And even things
possessing no life, such as environments, also trans-
mit the influence of one planet or zodiacal sign
stronger than they transmit that of others, and thus
the planet or zodiacal sign becomes their signature.
The Deuces.-The sign Virgo is general signifi-
cator of science and labor, therefore the Deuces, cor-
responding numerically to Virgo, in their more com-
mon divinatory significance must relate to these
things as applied to the department of life indicated
by the suit. But in their higher application they
reveal the influence of, and can be interpreted by,
the second decanate of each zodiacal triplicity, start-
ing with the pioneer, or movable, signs.

ters is a business depending upon scientific methods;
its inner interpretation is EXALTATION.
The divinatory significance of the Deuce of Cups
is a work of love; its inner interpretation is REVE-
LATION.
The divinatory significance of the Deuce of Coins
is money acquired by hard labor; its inner interpreta-
tion is INDEPENDENCE.
The divinatory significance of the Deuce of Swords
is sickness through over-work; -its inner interpreta-
tion is MARTYRDOM.
The Pyramid Spread.- In using the pyramid
spread, the cards are first shuffled and cut, and this
repeated three times, in the method employed for all
the spreads.
Then they are dealt from the top of the deck, one
by one, and laid face downward from right to left in
pyramid form as illustrated on page 68, 2 1 cards in
all being thus dealt.
The spread may be used to answer a question, to
solve a problem, or merely to give the general run of
events as they may be expected in some person's life.
But before shuffling, what is desired from them
should be clearly formulated, and held in the mind
until the spread has been completed.
Starting at the lower right hand corner, and count-
ing to the left, every fifth card is a Key, and this key
is counted as the first card in the next five, as shown
in the illustration. When a Major Arcanum falls
THE SACRED TAROT
upon one of the keys, it makes this key particularly
important.
To read, first turn over, from top to bottom, key
I, which shows the present. The four cards to the
right indicate the past, the one farthest to the right
as the more distant past, and the cards nearer the
key as more closely approaching the present.
Then key II represents the next turn in the wheel
of circumstances, and the cards between key I and
key II represent the factors leading up to it.
Key III is read as the next circumstance of im-
portance following this, and the cards between as
the lesser factors; key IV is still further in the future;
and key V, which crowns the pyramid, shows the
ultimate of the thing, or the distant future.

INVOLUTION AND EVOLUTION
OF NUMBERS
CCORDING to Hermetic Science there are
10 planets in the chain. But because it is a
chain, the tenth planet (Pluto) not only
closes the previous sphere of influence, but
· also commences a new gamut. That is,
Pluto is a repetition, on a higher scale of existence,
of the same influence as that exerted by the Moon; ,
but in addition to being a higher expression of the
influence of the Moon it serves an additional func-
tion as an influence of transiti.on to an entirely new
phase of existence. Neglecting this cycle-closing func-
tion represented by Pluto, there are 9 root planets.
These 9 root planets, however, express themselves
also by virtue of overtone qualities, in keys that are
denoted by the 12 zodiacal signs, in addition to the
transition function of Pluto. Thus the principle ex-
pressed by Mars, expresses also in a distinctive man-
ner through two other key influences, the sign Aries
and the sign Scorpio; and the principle expressed by
the Sun expresses in another key influence, through
the sign Leo. But the number of such key influences
is not unlimited, as shown by the fact that all things
which we are able to discern can readily be correlated
to one of 22 distinctive keys. That is, everything
we contact corresponds to one of the ten planets or
twelve Zodiacal signs. This we can prove by observ-
ing how a thing is influenced by astrological forces.
The system of numbers in common use is likewise
based upon ten fun_
damental principles, the tenth in-

fluence closing the cycle, and starting a new gamut
of existence. The 0 shows the completion of the
cycle, or circle, and the l indicates that the first in-
fluence has been carried to a new plane, or phase of
being. Thus either with planetary influences or with
numbers, we work with 10 separate .characters, but
there are only 9 root influences.
Any number above 9 is merely one of the root
numbers, to which 9 has been added a given number
of times. This adding multiples of 9 to some num-
ber is called Theosophical Evolution, not because it
derives from any particular group of people, but
because Theosophy means Divine Wisdom, and be-
cause in its particular function, the number 9 is the
key to Divine Wisdom in so far as numbers and
cycles are concerned.
Due to this peculiar function of the number 9,
when a number higher than 9 is given, instead of
dividing it by 9 repeatedly until a remainder less
than 10 results and thus obtaining its root, the same
result may ·be obtained merely by repeatedly adding
the digits of the number until there is but a single
digit. That is, the adding of the digits is but a
short-cut method of dividing the number by 9. Be-
cause this use of the key of Divine Wisdom, 9, to
find the root of the number, is the reverse of Theo-
sophical Evolution, it is called Theosophical Invo-
lution.
Dealing thus with numbers, we are considering
mere abstractions. But when man thinks of a num-
ber, a name, or anything else, his thought is not an
abstraction, but a definite astral vibration radiating
104 The Sacred Tarot
outward. The astral counterparts of objects also
radiate defini.te astral vibrations. .And astral vibra-
tions, as well as physical vibrations, and those electro-
magnetic vibrations known as light and radiant heat,
have an influence upon the things they contact.
The tones of musical instruments are other vibra-
tions with which we are even more familiar, and
which have many parallels to the astral vibrations of
thought. For even as a musical composition has· a
key, so every train of thought has its key, and in-
fluences its surroundings according to this key vibra-
tion. And each simple thought is a definite vibratory
rate of astral substance, just as each musical tone is
a definite vibratory rate .of physical substance.
Now with physical tones, if the vibration is in-
creased to a certain degree, the same sound repeats
itself on a higher level. Raising the vibration still
more causes the tone to be produced on each of
many higher levels. We commonly call each of
these higher levels an octave expression of the tone,
because it was customary to use the diatonic scale in
which the interval between one tone level and the
next was divided into seven divisions, so that the
eighth (octave meaning eight) repeated the tone on
a higher level.
In the chromatic scale, however, the interval is
divided into twelve tones, illustrated by the 7 white
keys and the 5 black keys of a piano, the 13th ex-
pressing the octave. The Chinese have a reed in-
strument in which the interval is divided into 5
equal parts, certain Indians ·use a scale of 6 equal
Involution and Evolution of Numbers 105
parts, the Siamese use a tone scale of 9, and certain'
Moravians use a scale of 24. Thus it will be seen
that the interval between a tone on one level and the
same tone (commonly referred to as an octave) on
another level .is variously divided by different people.
Now a thought has a vibratory quality very simi-
lar to a tone, except that it expresses in high-velocity
substance, that is, in astral substance, and a thought
can be sounded on different levels, just as a tone can
thus be sounded. But it has been found convenient,
and more in conformity to natural principles, to
divide the interval between one thought-tone level
and the next, not into 7, but into 9 divisions, so that
the 10th sha:ll express the same tone on the next
higher level. Therefore, instead of calling the in-
terval between a fundamental thought and its ex-
pressions on the next higher level an octave, we call
it a decave (decave meaning ten). The word
DECAVE has been coined, and will hereafter be
used, to express the vibratory levels of thought and
astral substance.
In the notation, analysis, and charting of thoughts
as vibratory tones, therefore, we have 9 root tones.
But even as in music .overtones play an important
part both in composition and in the effect produced,
so with thought-tones, there are peculiar overtone
effects that make it necessary to employ not merely
9 fundamental characters to express accurately all
thought-effects; hut to consider as distinct factors
certain dominant overtone effects that observation
shows to occur in the levels just above the 9 root
tones. Thus to chart a train of thoughts it may be
106 The Sacred Tarot
necessary to employ as many as 22 different char-
acters.
When the string of a musical instrument is sounded
the string not merely vibrates as a whole, giving rise
to the tone, but it also divides itself into two equal
segments, each of which tends to give forth a sound;
into three equal segments, each of which tends to
give forth another tone; into four equal segments,
each of which tends to give forth still another tone,
and so on. These tones produced by the smaller
string divisions are called overtones, and are utilized
in musical composition.
Certain musical instruments encourage certain
overtones and discourage others, and thought-vibra-
tions, likewise, produce specific overtone effects.
But because thought-tones are vibratory rates in
high-velocity substance, we cannot follow the com-
parison with physical vibrations into too great de-
tail. University scientists, through innumerable ex-
periments conducted under strict test conditions, have
demonstrated conclusively that on the inner plane,
distance and gravitation each are of a different order
than they are on the outer plane. And astrology indi-
cates that inner-plane weather affects the individual,
not merely according to his inner-plane constitution,
but through certain time-space relationships. Astro-
logical energies, in their various combinations, con-
stitute the inner-plane weather.
There are inner-plane weather conditions that
affect groups, cities, nations and world affairs, -and
through these influence each individual in the group,
city, nation or world. But the chief weather condi-
Involution and Evolution of Numbers 107
tions affecting an individual are restricted to him.
In addition to the more general astrological weather
conditions, each has his own individual inner-plane
weather. Such personal weather is mapped by major
prog~essions, minor progressions and transit pro-
gressions.
Also it has been found that with a thought-vibra-
tion the overtone quality is dominant from tone 1 up
to tone 22, and not only any one of the 9 root-tones,
but any one of the 22 types of thought-vibration, can
express its individuality on a higher vibratory level
or DECAVE.
Thus, in considering not merely thought-vibrations,
but character-vi.brations and astrological-vibrations,
because these are all inner-plane vibrations, we can
not confine ourselves merely to 9 root tones, but, due
to the peculiar overtone properties of astral vibra-
tory rates, we must give full tone value to 22 differ-
ent qualities, which we shall, for convenience, call
KEYS.
Every thought, every train of thought, every in-
dividual, every influence from the firmament and
every force in nature, therefore, because its astral
nature is thus tuned, vibrates to one of these 22 Keys.
And because each of the 22 key-tones may sound
on various higher vibratory levels, or Decaves, in
order to find the key to which the thought of a num-
ber, for instance, vibrates, it is necessary to reduce
or involve it, by subtracting multiples of 9.
To thus apply the number of Divine Wisdom
properly to obtain the Key of the number, the digits
of the number are added together, and the digits of
108 . The Sacred Tarot
the number so obtained are added together again,
and so on, until a number is obtained which is less
than 23. This number is the Key of the number
considered.
Thus to find the Key, or vibratory thought-rate,
of the number 1932 we simply add 1 plus 9 plus 3
plus 2, which gives 15 as its thought-tone quality.
Now the Key itself is the first Decave of a num-
ber. The second decave is obtained by adding 9. In
this case the second decave is 15 plus 9 which equals
24. The third decave of a number is obtained by
adding two times 9, in this case giving 33. But due
to the peculiar overtone properties of astral vibra-
tory rates, the Key of 24 and 33 is not 15,' but 6. Yet
when we add six times 9 to 15 we get 69, the Key of
which is 15, because in this number the overtone
effect again becomes dominant.
From the above it will be seen that the way to find
the decave in which the key is sounded is to subtract
the key from the number and divide by 9; and then
because the key itself is the first decave, to add 1 to
the number thus found.
Thus 1932 minus 15 gives 1917. 1917 divided by
9 gives 213. That is, 9 has been added to 15 just
213 times to get 1932. But as 15 itself is the first
decave, to get the number of the decave we must add
l to 213, which gives us 214. This means that the
thought-vibration is 15 sounded on the 214th vibra-
tory level. ·
Now if we desire to get the Key of the Decave,
which we use only for divinatory purposes, we merely
add 2 plus 1 plus 4, which gives 7.
Involution and Evolution of Numbers 109
15 itself has a root, obtained through adding its
digits-1 plus 5 gives 6 as the root. But from a
.vibratory-tone standpoint the Key is the important
ili~ .
The ROOT is a number below 10.
The KEY may be any number below 23.
The DECAVE is the number of times 9 has been
added to the Key phis 1, this 1 being the first Decave,
which is occupied by the Key.
The Key of the Decave is found by using the De-
cave as a number and finding its key in the ordinary.
way.
When, therefore, we add the digits of ·a number
together, let us not believe this is some arbitrary
method of finding its significance; but understand
that we are proceeding according to correct mathe-
matical principles to find what number, as a Key num-
ber, has been raised to a higher level by adding to it
multiples of 9.
And when we find the Decave of the number let us
bear in mind that the number itself is on the first
de~ave, and that to it has been added 9 a certain
number of times. The number thus expresses ·a cer-
tain decave of a Key number, just as a musical tone
sounded on a higher octave expresses itself as a tone
which has been raised by multiples of 7.

G-3, expresses in the spiritual world, supreme
power balanced by eternally active intelligence and
absolute wisdom.
In the intellectual world, the universal fecundity
of being.
In the physical world, nature in labor, the ger-
mination of acts, which must hatch from the will.
Remember, then, son of earth, that to affirm what
is true and will what is just, is already to create it;
to affirm and will the contrary is to vow oneself to
destruction. If Arcanum III should appear in the
prophetic signs of thy horoscope, hope for success in
thy enterprises provided thou knowest how to unite
the activity which fecundates, to that rectitude of
mind which will make thv works bear fruit.
In Divination, Arcanu~ III may be read briefly
as Marriage or Action.
Arcanum III is figured by a woman seated within
a radiant sun. The rays from this sun number thirty,
the number of degrees in one zodiacal sign. The
woman is crowned with twelve stars, to represent the
twelve signs through which the sun passes each year.
Her feet rest upon the moon, symbol of the feminine
in nature. And the cube upon which she sits repre-
sents the cross of matter, where rays. of sun and
moon meet, and so signifies the union of male and
female forces.
Involution and Evolution of Numbers U1
. From her brow the sacred serpent thrusts its head
as a symbol of enlightenment. In her right hand she
carries a scepter surmounted by a globe. This is
essentially a phallus, and indicates the perpetual ac-
tion of- creative energy upon all things born_or to be
horn. In her left hand she carries an eagle, the sym-
bol of fruitfulness and of the heights to which the
flights of the spirit can raise itself through the
emotions engendered in union. The seat upon which
she rests is covered with eyes, indicating that through
union the eyes of the soul have been opened to a
knowledge of good and evil.
This ensemble pictures, in terms of universal
symbolism, generation, gestation, and universal
fecundity.
Number.-Numerically, 3 expresses the union of
polar opposites, the relation between such forces as
cause vibration and change. It thus represents the
universal agent, action, or word, and is typical of
fecundity. It is the union of forces of different polar-
ity that is back of all action, all life and all intelli-
gence.
As applied to human evolution it represents the
ego joined to the body by the soul. The soul de-
velops and makes progress because the ego is polar-
ized to positive spirit and the body is polarized to
negative matter. The interaction between these two
' generates the force that impells the soul forward in
its journey.
On the physical plane, 3 represents man and
woman in marriage. In science it stands for the
112 The Sacred Tarot
dynamic laws; for the laws that govern the produc-
tion and directing of energy. It is because of differ-
ence in polarity that nothing is free from change,
that all nature is in constant motion.
Astrology.-Having been tempted by the serpent
of desire for material experience, the desire for off-
spring-astrologically the fifth house, presided over
by the sign Leo-·-Eve falls into union. This union is
astrologically the union of summer and winter,
which, with the conception resulting, is represented
by the natural ruler of all partnerships, the zodiacal
sign Libra.
Arcanum II I not merely pictures the union, but
also the resulting enlightenment; for Adam and Eve
after union discerned they- needed ~lothing, and the
serpent of desire, through desire's fulfillment, be-
came the serpent of wisdom. This serpent, symbol
of creative energy released by desire, is shown raised
to the brow to indicate the power that union pos-
sesses to increase the range of mental activity.
Isis Unveiled should be distinguished from the
second decave of 3, which is Arcanum XII and the
sign Pisces ; for this pictures negative union resulting
in wasted vitality. Also from the third decave of 3,
\\·hich is A rcanum XXI, ruled by the Sun, which re-
n als the use of union in making the highest spiritual
attainment.
Human Function.-U nion is prompted by feel-
ing. Also, the contact with objects which gives rise
to feeling is a form of union. Thus the human func-
Involution and Evolution of Numbers 113
tion known as the sense of feeling quite naturally
attaches itself to the arcanum which represents union.
Alchemy.-Arcanum III represents the union of
the various ingredients. Not only must all the proper
ingredients be present before transmutation is pos-
sible, but they must enter into union. The reverbera-
tory furnace imparts some energy to them, but not
enough to complete the transmutation process. It is
not, therefore, merely a matter of assembling suit- -
able metals in proper proportions. But they must be
joined in such a manner as.mutually to increase their
vibratory rates; adding the energy they thus mutually
generate to the process. Physical proximity is not
sufficient for this purpose. They must be intimately
joined in their essential qualities.
Bible.-The fall of Eve and the consequent ex-
pulsion of the human race from the Garden of Eden
is pictured by Arcanum III.
The ark of Noah is another reference to the same
arcanum. Its three stories correspond to the three
realms of the arcanum which are represented by the
Sun, typical of spirit, the Moon, typical of the astral,
and the cube, typical of the physical world. The cube,
or physical world, or square cabin of the ark, is
where the soul undergoes its period of gestation.
Masonry.-The Master Mason degree is based
upon Arcanum III; and the meaning of the whole
story of the assassination, the burial, the finding and
the raising of Hiram Abiff is made plain by compar-
ing it with the pictured symbols of this arcanum. It
114 The Sacred Tarot
thus, in reality, is the key to the Master's Word
which was lost at that time.
The G of Masonry, found traced upon the breast
of the murdered Hiram, is the letter of this arcanum.
High twelve, the time the master was attacked, is
represented by the noon-day position of the Sun.
Low twelve, the time he was buried, is indicated by
· the position of the moon at the nadir.
The grave, which is six feet due east and west, and
six feet perpendicular, is represented by the six-sided
cube upon which Isis sits. The sprig of cassia mark-
ing the grave is presented in the tarot as a phallic
scepter. The twelve Masons sent out to hunt for
Hiram Abiff are symbolized by the twelve stars
above the head of Isis. The five points of fellowship
upon which Hiram was raised by means of the Lion's
paw grip are indicated by the five eyes traced upon
the cube; and the final transcendent result of so being
raised is pictured by the eagle on the left hand of Isis.
Magic,.-In Magic, Arcanum III reveals the prin-
ciple of vitalization. This principle springs into ex-
istence as the result of that polarity represented in
Arcanum II. That is, it is the vibratory ~ffect of the
interaction of polar opposites.
One of the first things we learn in the study of
physics is that every action is accompanied by an
opposite and equal reaction. Therefore, for every
positive force in the universe there must be an ex-
actly similar force of negative attributes.
It is impossible, for instance, to make a magnet
possessing only a positive pole. For by the most
Involution and Evolution of Numbers 115
fundamental law of nature, when a positive force of
any kind is brought into existence it must be accom-
panied by an equal, but negative force. This is the
principle upon which rests that great law of physics
called the conservation of energy. For if one mem-
ber of this duality were to be absent, and the energy
spent in one direction were not always accounted for
by an equivalent reaction, it would be possible not
merely to transform energy, but to create new ener-
gies, or actually to lose energy already in existence.
That such creation and such loss never take place
constitutes the well known law of the conservation of
energy.
The law of the conservation of energy does not
apply merely to one plane of existence, but to all
planes and states. Consequently, for every soul of
positive, or male, polarity, which comes into exist-
ence through differentiation, there simultaneously
springs into existence another soul of negative, or
female, polarity. A soul is a definite force, and it has
polarity, and it is as impossible to conceive of a male
soul being launched upon the tide of involution and
evolution :without a similar female soul also being
launched at the same time, as it is to conceive of a
magnet with only one pole. Furthermore, because
action and reaction are exactly equivalent, the female
soul must be the exact replica of the male soul, ex-
cept in the matter of sex, or polarity.
Other than sex, the only possible difference be-
tween souls which thus have been differentiated at
the same time is due to the diversity of experiences
which they have had since differentiation. Ultimately
116 The Sacred Tarot
they are both born upon the ea,rth, and sometimes
they even meet in physical life as man and woman.
But whether they meet upon earth, or in some higher
state of existence, by virtue of their simultaneous
differentiations and being otigin,ally exact counter-
parts, they are true soul-mates.
The ability of .soul-mates spiritually to vitalize
each other, although this may not be acquired until
planes far above earth are reached, makes their joint
immortality possible. But descending from such re-
condite considerations, in reality there is no action,
no life and no consciousness that is not traceable
to sex.
Chemical affinity, for instance, is due to the mar-
riage of atoms. They are impelled to divorce less
compatible partners and enter into union with those
which have a greater attraction for them. And we
use the power generated in such marriages to drive
locomotives and to. carry us about the country in
automobiles.
Electricity and magnetism are due to positive
energies endeavoring to unite with negative ener-
gies; and analysis could show that every force in the
universe which has come under observation is the
result of some similar sexual attraction.
Breathing, likewise, is dual, inhalation and exhala-
tion, positive and negative. And in the process, in
addition to the oxygenation of the blood, electro-
magnetic energies are picked up and lend their power
to nerve, brain and electromagnetic body.
Initiation.- ln the soul's pilgrimage Arcanum III
represents its descent into. material conditions and
Involution and Evolution of Numbers 117
then, having climbed the ascending arc of the cycle
to the human state, finding a suitable companion to
assist in developing the spiritual attributes. Spiritual-
ity implies an exalted emotional development.
Occult Science.-Spiritual alchemy is the science
which uses each and every event of life as a meahs of
creating spiritual values. They are purified by sepa-
rating the external appearance from their real sig-
nificance,_anq fluxed in proper combination. Should
some ingredients be lacking to perfect the transmu-
tation, these events are sought out and added to
life's collection.
The Treys.-The sign Libra is the common sig-
nificator of partnership, open enemies, lawsuits and
dealing with the public; therefore _
the Treys, cor-
responding numerically to Libra, in their more com-
mon divinatory significance must relate to these
things as applied to the department of life indicated
by the suit. But in their higher application they re-
veal the influence of, and can be interpreted by, the
third decanate of each zodiacal triplicity, starting
with the active, or movable signs. ·
The divinatory significance of the Trey of Scepters
is a business partnership; its inner interpretation is
PROPAGANDA.
The divinatory significance of the Trey of Cups
is a marriage for love; its inner interpretation is

In the intellectual world, the realization of the
ideas of contingent being by the four-fold labors of
the mind: affirmation, negation, discussion, and solu-

In the physical world, the realization of acts,

justice, the force of the will, and the works of the
organs.
Remember, then, son of earth, that nothing can
resist a firm will which has for a lever the knowledge
of the true and just. To combat in order to secure its
realization is more than right; it is a duty. The man
who triumphs in that struggle only accomplishes his
earthly mission; he who succumbs in devoting him-
self to it, gains immortal:~y. If the Sovereign should
Involution and Evolution of Numbers 119
appear in the prophetic signs of thy horoscope, it
signifies tha't the realization of thy hopes depends
upon a being more powerful than thyself. Seek to
know him and thou shalt have his support.
In Divination, Arcanum IV may be read as Real-
ization. ·
Arcanum IV is figured by a man; on his head a
sovereign's helmet. He is seated upon a cubic stone;
his right hand raises a scepter surmounted by a circle,
and his right leg bent, rests upon.the other, forming
with it a cross.
The cubic stone, image of the perfect solid, signi-
.fies labor which has reached completion. The cat,
pictured on the side of the stone, indicates that ·the
vision of the soul penetrates the illusions of matter.
The sovereign's helmet is an emblem of force con-
quered by _
power. The ruler is in possession of the
scepter of Isis, indicating that he has knowledge of
the spiritual use of the creative energies; and he
points downward with his left hand to indicate that
he uses these energies in the subjugation of the
physical.
The sacred serpent at his brow indicates enlight-
enment; and the hawk, sacred to the sun, indicates
his ambition to attain spiritual supremacy.
The cross, formed by his legs, symbolizes the four
elemental kingdoms he has mastered, and the expan-
sion of human power through understanding.
The apron above the legs, together with them, fig-

120 The Sacred Tarot
Number.-Numerically, 4 expresses the result of
action, the fruit of the toil typified by 3. It is. the
realization from effort, and it is life springing into
manifestation as the result of the union of polar
opposites. It thus represents the practical, the con-
crete, and consequently that which has form.
It becomes, therefore, the type of the universal
trutll of reality, indicating that each realm is actual
when viewed from its own plane. It is also the prac-
tical as applied to everyday affairs.
In the macrocosm it signifies the result of motion;
in man it is the knowledge which comes through ex-
perience. In science it relates to all those laws which
govern the effective use of energy; to those which
govern what is produced by motion.
Astrology.~The Sov~reign by his helmet and his
attitude of dominating through force, expresses
martial energy; and the prominence of the phallic
symbol relates him to the sex sign of Mars rather
than to the head sign, Aries. Furthermore, the fruit-
fulness and silent type of strength are attributes of
Scorpio. .
Scorpio is the zodiacal sign of sex, the magnetic
forces of which conserved as indicated in Arcanum
IV become a most potent power to dominate the ele-
mental realms of life. The negative aspect of this
principle is indicated by the second decave of 4,
Arcanum XIII, which pictures the natural course of
events when, the force is undirected, life and death
in different types of forms following each other in
rhythmic cycles.
,
Involution and Evolution of Numbers 121
The inversive and degenerative use of the same
principle is pictured in Arcanum XXII, representing
the third decave of 4. Here the T is represented
with its point down; but the other side of Pluto's
influence is the T with its ppint skyward; which is the
highest aspect of sex, the transcendent powers aris-
ing from a union of soul-mates.
Human Function.-Magnetically, Scorpio is the
most potent sign of the zodiac. Sex is back of all
energy, and in man generates electromagnetic cur-
rents. Sexual vigor tunes the organism in on electro-
magnetic energies, which are all about us, and these
give force to the personal magnetism, and vitalize
the emotions and the procreative fluids. Scorpio, be-
cause of its rulership of sex, more readily than any
other sign, is capable of receiving and transmitting
these magnetic energies, and thus Arcanum IV, cor-
responding to Scorpio, is correlated to the faculty of
electromagnetic absorption.
Alchemy.-When the ingredients are brought fo-
gether their union generates a force, or heat. The
energy, thus liberated through the fluxing of polar
opposites, when properly controlled, is an essential
factor in proper transmutation. The control of it,
however, is not accomplished by suppressing, or con-
fining it, but by directing it into proper channels. In
fact, the directing·of this energy into those channels
which prevent it from causing an explosion, or burn-
ing the various ingredients, is one of the most impor-
tant secrets of the alchemical art. Diverting it to the
end desired corresponds to Arcanum IV.
I
122 The Sacred Tarot
Bible.-As Arcanum IV is the emblem of fruit-
fulness, there are numerous passages in the Bible
which refer to it; for throughout, fruitfulness is con-
sidered a virtue and barrenness a crime. This applies
more forcefully to the mental than to the physical
plane; for when man is barren of thought his prog-
ress ceases and the body falls into decay.
Gen. 1:28. "And God blessed them, and God said
unto them, Be fruitful and multiply, and replenish
the earth, and subdue it; and have dominion over the
fish of the sea, and the fowl of the air, and over
every living thing that moveth upon the earth."
Rev. 12 :5. "And she brought forth a man child,
who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron; and
her child was caught up unto God and His throne."
Thus is mentioned the fruitfulness of the sign
Scorpio; its rulership, as belonging to Mars, of iron;
the rod held in the hand of the Sovereign, its domi-
nating character, and its possibilities of spiritual real-
ization as symbolized by the hawk; for the child was
caught up to the throne of God.
Masonry.-The Mark Master's degree is founded
upon Arcanum IV. As a whole the degree and the
arcanum teach that, "To him that overcometh will I
give to eat of the hidden manna, and I will give him
a white stone, and in the stone a new name written,
which no man knoweth, saving him that receiveth it."
The sovereign of Arcanum IV sits upon such a
stone, and the symbol of a new name is engraved
upon it, and he represents one who has overcome.
The hawk pictured on his breast is reputed, in legend,
Involution and Evolution of Numbers 123
to fly to the sun. It therefore carries the same pur-
port as the. eight Masonic letters which are inter-
preted either, "Hiram Tyrian, Widow's Son, Sent
To King Solomon," or, "He That Was Slain Soars
To Kindred Spirit." Thus does Arcanum IV depict
the key-stone which the builders rejected.
Magic.-ln Magic, Arcanum IV reveals the prin-
ciple of realization. This implies the expectant atti-
tude, and the preparation after the energy has been
released to provide for that which is to be fulfilled.
There must be confidence that the work is being.
properly performed, and that gestation will result in
proper fruition. Worry, or anxiety as to results, is
fatal to proper development of that which is desired.
Initiation.~ln the soul's pilgrimage, Arcanum IV
indicates the result of marriage after the state of
manhood has been reached.
Both Christian monks and Hindu ascetics were
under the impression that to be holy one must be
miserable. But modern psychology proves indisput-
ably that happiness leads to efficiency, and that
misery tends toward disintegration without neces-
sarily adding anything to the spirituality.
Of all the avenues to spiritual development, the
affections are the most potent. The union prompted
by lust and selfishness is one of the most destructive
forces. Through the emotions we raise or lower our
vibratory rates, and thus tend to elevate -Ourselves to
a higher condition or lower and degrade ourselves.
The creative energies, in union, customarily arouse
intense emotional states. If these emotional states
124 The Sacred Tarot
are such as inspire tenderness, kindness and the desire
to be helpful to o~hers, they tend vigorously to build
up the spirituality; for they cultivate a higher basic
vibratory rate. But if they engender brutal thoughts
and encourage grossness, through cultivating a lower
basic vibratory rate, they destroy the spirituality.
Furthermore, there is no power which can lift the
soul to such exalted states of ecstasy as can love, and
thus only through love can we of earth contact the
higher spiritual states.
Occult Science.- Imponderable forces is the sci-
ence which deals with all the invisible energies not
recognized by material science. In particular, it deals
with the principles of ceremonial magic, in which
there is a more or less definite ritual and often there
is used specially prepared equipment such as wands,
circles, seals, pentacles, inscriptions, etc.
The Fours.-The sign Scorpio is the general sig-
nificator of fruitfulness, legacies, spirit communion,
the dead, and the partner's money. Consequently,
each of the fours, in its more common divinatory
significance must relate to one of these things accord-
ing to its suit. But in their higher application these
cards reveal the influence ofl and can be interpreted
by, the fourth decanate of each zodiacal triplicity,
starting the count with the movable signs. '
The divinatory significance of the Four of Scepters
is a legacy; its iqner interpretation is RULERSHIP.
The divinatory significance of the Four of Cups is
an increase in the family; its inner interpretation is
RESOURCEFULNESS.
Involution and Evolution of Numbers 125
The divinatory significance of the Four of Coins
is money received through a partner; its inner sig-
nificance is ORIGINALITY.
The divinatory significance of the Four of Swords
is remorse for past action; its inner interpretation is
DETERMINATION.
Reversed Cards.-In all methods of reading the
cards are dealt face downward; and they are turned
over from top to bottom, one at a time, as read.
This prevents the mind from wandering to other
parts of the spread.
Any card right end up is considered slightly more
fortunate than its common significance. It then be-
comes like a planet receiving a good,aspect. Any card
wrong end up is slightly more unfortunate than its
common meaning. It then becomes like a planet re-
ceiving a bad aspect. But reversal never makes a
good card bad, nor a bad card good.' As Saturn and
Mars are less evil when well aspected, and as Jupiter
and Venus are more potent for good when well
aspected,. in the same manner any card is improved
by being right end up.
Method of the Sephiroth.-ln this method only
the 22 Major Arcana and the 4 Aces are used.
The Aces are shuffled separately. They are the
most potent of all; for they represent the four astral
kingdoms symbolized by their suits. They are called
the Astral Keys, and outrank any of the other cards.
The 4 Aces after being shuffled and cut are then
dealt as illustrated on the frontispiece, the first on
126 The Sacred Tarot
the kingdom marked Ase., the second on the M.C.,
the third on the Desc., and the fourth on the N.C.
Then the 22 Major Arcana are shuffled, cut, and
dealt one at a time around the ten thrones, from I to
X. This completed, the others are dealt back from
throne X to throne I. This leaves two cards, which
are placed face downward at the side. These are
called the st.aff, and are only consulted when the fig-
ure proves contradictory. In such instances the staff
indicates why there was failure to give a plain
answer, and thus supports the devout student in
his disappointment.
The first Astr4l Kingdom, marked Ase., is that of
Life, and if the Ace of Coins falls there it shows
strength, vigor and vitality; if the Ace of Scepters,
it is fav.orable but denotes work and responsibility;
if the Ace of Cups, that love of pleasure may deplete
the vitality; and if the Ace of Swords, that there will
·be sickness or death.
The second Astral Kingdom, marked·M.C., is that
of Honor and Business. The Ace of Scepters falling
there gives it great power; the Ace of Coins is favor-
able, but indicates much effort required; the honor is
blemished through the pursuit of pleasure if the Ace
of Cups falls there; and the Ace of Swords there
presages failure.
The Astral Kingdom of Love is marked Desc. The
Ace of Cups falling there indicates joy and happi-
ness; the Ace of Swords there marks disputes; the
Ace of Scepters· there brings difficulties through dif-
ference in station; and the Ace of Coins signifies
abundant strength.
Involution and Evolution of Numbers 127
The Astral Kingdom of Results is marked N.C.
The Ace of Swords falling there indicates a favor-
able ending; the Ace of Cups there brings pleasant
results; the Ace of Coins there is most unfortunate;
and the Ace of Scepters there denotes a hard struggle
which yields inadequate returns.
If the question relates to life begin with the Ase.,
if to love or war with the Desc., if to honor or busi-
ness with the M .C., and if to secret things with
the N.C.
First turn over, from top to bottom, the Ace, or
astral key, of the question. Every question possible
belongs to one of the four kingdoms, and the Ace
indicating the general fortune of the matter is located
as explained. After the significance of this Ace is
noted, turn over the cards belonging to its thrones.
You will note that the Ase. and Desc. have three
thrones of two cards each, and that the M.C. and
N.C. have but two thrones of two cards each. In
considering the Ase. or Desc. the two cards on the
center thrones, either I or VI, as the case may be,
indicate the most important factors, and the other
four cards signify modifying influences. The cards
on the thrones of the question will indicate why the
conditions signified by the Ace shown there exist and
give some details.
Then turn over the opposite Ace, which indicates
the opposition to the matter. The cards of its throne
show the details of this opposition. Now if good
cards occupy the kingdom and thrones of the ques-
tion, and also the opposition to the question, it is
128 The Sacred Tarot
most favorable. But if both the question and its
opposition are held by evil cards, it is a bad omen.
If the opposition holds more evil than the question
holds good, the .matter will fail after a· struggle. If
the question holds more evil than the opposition
holds good, the matter lacks merit and will fail of its
own accord. If the opposition is good enough, it will
be carried to success in spite of its unworth. If the
good in the question is stronger than the opposition
it will succeed in spite of opposition.
The kingdom next in order always, indicates the
culmination of the matter, and the thrones -opposite
within their kingdom its end. Thus in a question of
love, war, marriage, e~c. , the Desc. becomes the ques-
tion and the Ase. its opposition. The N .C. then
becomes its progr~ss, and the M.C. its end. In a
question of business, however, the M.C. becomes the
question and the N.C. its opposition, with the Desc.
its progress and the Ase. its end. If the question con-
cerns psychic matters or hidden things the N .C.
becomes the question and the M. C. its opposition;
with the Ase. its culmination and the Desc. its end.
And in all cases the cards on the thrones will indi-
cate the various factors, indicating how and why.
The four cards on the thrones of the M.C. or N.C.
are of equal importance.

READING THE MEANING OF NUMBERS
Y MEANS of numbers we estimate the in-
fluence both of things and forces. The
value of a material object, for instance,
such as a house, is commonly expressed
numerically in dollars and cents. The
power of an engine is expressed numerically as so
many horsepower. The speed of light is mentioned
as so many thousand miles a second. And the pres-
sure in an electric system as so many volts. In fact,
the measure of quantity and quality would be very
difficult to,express except through the use of numbers.
When, therefore, we approach the study of the
influence exerted by invisible energies, we quite natu-
rally expect that they also should be expressed, in
their power to cause changes, by means of numbers.
A vast amount of experimental and statistical evi-
dence has been accumulated proving that man lives
in, and is influenced by, two environments. And a
vast amount of observation indicates that the inner-
plane environment and its forces are as effective in
determining his thoughts, emotions, behavior, health
and the events which enter his life as are the outer-
plane environment and its forces.
Man is influenced from the outer plane by what
people say orally, over the radio, through the press
and on the screen. And he is influenced from
the inner plane by people's thoughts. He is influ-
enced from the outer plane by objects. And he is
influenced from the inner plane by the character
vibrations of objects. He is influenced from the outer

plane by the weather. And he .is equally or more
influenced from · the inner plane by the astrological
energies which constitute the inner-plane weather.
An individual ignorant of inner-plane energies is
able to live up to only one-half his possibilities.
Through knowledge of the inner-plane energies an
individual who will apply such knowledge should be
able to increase his spirituality, success, happiness
and health 100% . Whatever his objectives may be,
he stands a far greater chance of reaching them if he
understands how the ,inner-plane env.ironment influ-
ences' his life, and how to take advantage of its
energies.
As indicated, such energies may all be classified
under these three categories: 1. Character-vibra-
tions; which are the radiations of a thing or an in-
telligence due to its organization. 2. Thought-vibra-
tions; which are the radiations of an intelligence due
to thought processes. 3. Astrological-vibrations;
which are the radiations from the heavenly bodies
and the zodiacal signs.
The vibrations of physical substance within a cer-
tain range of frequencies give rise to tones or sounds.
And electromagnetic vibrations within · a . certain
range of frequencies give rise to colors. Likewis.e the
range of frequencies of astral substance which has an
influence upon human life gives rise to similar types
of energy, producing effects comparable to physical
tones or electromagnetic colors. Because we are more
familiar with physical vibrations, it is convenient to
refer to astral vibrations as tones.
There are thus astral tones arising from the signs
136 The Sacred Tarot
and planets, astral tones arising from character radi-
ations, and astral tones arising from thoughts. Tones
may be isolated or in combination; and in either case
there is ofteq a dominant influence, or key. A char-
acter, for instance, is not just a single tone, but a
combination of them. Yet there is usually a key note
to the character. Likewise, a single thought radiates
but a single astral tone. But a train of thoughts radi-
ates a series of tones like a musical selection. Yet a
musical composition commonly has a key tone. And
a train of thoughts also has a key which can be deter-
mined from the nature of the thinking. In its influ-
ence the key tone is the most important vibratory
rate.
We have all heard-the story of how a building or
a bridge can be demolished by a fiddler playing near
it the tone to which it is keyed. And as already men-
tioned in Lesson No. 22, the great Caruso, when he
dined, would ask for a wine glass, tap it to find its
tone, and have the waiter place it at the far side of
the room. Then singing this tone in his powerful
voice he would shatter the glass.
Now thoughts also have each a given tone quality.
And just as Caruso's voice sounding a certain tone
called forth that response in the tone of the wine
glass, so a thought having the same tone as some
particularly prominent vibratory center within our-
selves, when it reaches us repeatedly, may set up a
terrific vibratory intensity in that section of our astral
body. That is, a specific thought reaching us from
others, constantly being radiated to us by everyone
who thinks about us, if it has the same tone as some
Reading The Meaning of Numbers 137
section of our astral body, stimulates the thought-
cells of that section of the astral body into unusual
activity.
Of such thoughts sent to us regularly and with
great frequency the name we use as signatul'.e may be
the one from which we receive the greatest thought
bombardment. However, the nickname by which our
friends think of us, the given name by which rela-
tives think of us, and the house number or telephone
number which is used often by people while they
visualize us, all have an influence. The amount of
energy from each such name or number, of course,
depends upon the frequency with which it is thought
and the thought-power of those who thus think of us
in such association.
Either a name or a number, as such, is merely an
abstraction, and has no energy to do anything. But·
when a name or a number is thought, that thought is
a definite energy radiated toward the one then
thought about. As such it has also a specific vibra-
tory key. Its influence, thus, is not to be measured
by the sound produced in speaking; for the influence
is quite as pronounced if it is only thought and not
spoken. It is measured by the voltage, so to speak,
of the thought; that is, by the energy supplied the
thought by the thinker; and by the key to which it
vibrates.
As to how much power to ·project their thoughts
the various individuals who think our name have,
and how often they think our name, we can only esti-
mate in a very general manner. But as to the key to
which any name or number vibrates we have a posi-
138 The Sacred Tarot
tive method of determination. Just as positive a
method as we have of determining in which key a
musical composition is written.
The Hebr~w, Chaldean and Coptic square-formed
letters served not merely as letters, but also as num-
bers. That is, there were no separate characters for
numbers, each letter being a number. We thus have
the numerical value of the letters of these ancient
alphabets; that is, the vibratory quality ascribed to
each by the early masters of occult science. And these
values, as tested out today, prove correct.
And in tabulating the correspondence between the
English alphabet and the ancient square-formed let-
ters, the effort has been made, not merely to follow
the precedent of translators of languages, but accu-
rate~y to select the English equivalent in its thought-
vibration quality of each of the ancient 22 letters.
Thus we · are able, by substituting the numerical
vibratory equivalent of each English letter, to find
the number which has the same astral vibratory rate
as any name.
When the numerical equivalent of the name is thus
found, the Key to which the name vibrates can be
determined by finding the Key of the number. This
Key is found by Theosophical Involution, as ex-
plained in lesson No. 24. That is, the digits of the
number are added together, and this repeated, until
a number results which is below 23. This gives the
vibratory key of the number, and thus the vibratory
key of the name.
By this method the vibratory rate of any name,
whether it is associated with an individual or not,
Reading The Meaning of Numbers 139
may be determined in a positive manner. And with
this information at our disposal for determining the
key of any name or any number, we have at hand a
rather complete measure of all the astral forces that
can have an influence over human life.
Character-vibrations are determined by finding the
astrological signature. That is, the key to which a
town, a person, a locality, an occupation, or what
not, vibrates is made known when its astrological
rulership is discovered. And astrologers have deter-
mined the rulership of most important things. In
this connection, in subsequent lessons of this course,
there will be some discussion of the influence of musi-
cal notes, of colors, of talismanic gems, and such
things. The astrological vibration~, of course, are
made known by astrological science. This leaves only
the influence of thought-vibrations to be considered.
Thoughts are either abstract or concrete. Con-
crete thoughts are those that concern doing some-
thing, or which revolve about ·some definite object or
action. We do not possess as yet any method of de-
termining the tone of each separate thought in a
thought-train. If we did we could ~hart any thought-
train on a musical staff of 11 lines and 11 spaces. But
we do possess a method of determining each sepa-
rate tone in any name or any number; for each lettei:,
ur number, is one of 22 numbered thought-tones.
Thus we can chart a number or name on such a staff
as mentioned; the name C. C. Zain thus being
.charted on the frontispiece of lesson No. 184.
But the really important thing about a thought-
train, or about a name or number, is the key to which
140 The Sacred Tarot
it vibrat~s as a whole. This key to which a thought-
train sounds can be determined by an analysis of it.
Such analysis of a thought-train, or an emotion, re-
veals it to vibrate chiefly to the Domestic Urges
(Key 20), to the Power Ur~es (Key 21), to the
Safety Urges (Key 15) , to the Intellectual Urges
(Key 1), or to some of the other keys. From this
the influence of the thought-train or emotion is made
known. And in. Course IX (Mental Alchemy) the
practical application of such knowledge is discussed
in all its details.
Here, however, we are interested in abstract
thoughts, such as names and numbers. The name
FRED, for instance, when not associated in the mind
with some particular person, is a mere abstraction.
Yet when you, or anyone else, thinks the name
FRED, there is radiated from the mind four
thought-tones - 17-20-5-4. No matter who
thinks this name, the same thought-tones are radi-
ated. And each of these four separate tones has a
certain amount of influence.
But in thinking this name, or any other name, the
various tones composing it are blended, just as the
tones of a musical chord are blended, and the whole
name as thought vibrates to a dominant key tone.
And this key tone, the vibratory key of the name,
has a far greater power than any tone embraced in
it; in fact, it seems to have as much power as all the
combined separate tones of the name.
Thus 17 plus 20 plus 5 plus 4 gives 46 as the
number of the name FRED. Then as 46 is above
23, we add 4 plus 6 which gives us 10 as the astral
Reading The Meaning of Numbers 141
vibratory Key of the name. No matter who thinks
the word Fred, his thoughts send out a: key-tone
which vibrates to 10.
The meaning of this 10 tone1 standing by itself,
and unrelated to any individual, can he had by refer-
ring to the 10th Major Arcanum of the tarot. Its
divinatory significance is there given as Change of
Fortune. Its meaning is also there indicated in the
spiritual world, in the intellectual world, and in the
physical world. And still further information about
it can be had from the detailed explanation of the
number 10 tarot.
But as affecting human life things do not stand
alone. Instead they exert an impact upon character.
How the character is affected, depends not merely
upon the vibration reaching it from without, but also
upon the nature of the character thus reached. One
individual is affected one way by a certain force and
another individual is affected in quite a different way
by this same force.
Therefore, if we are to have a positive science-
as distinct from a divinatory method-of invisible
vibrations as affecting human life and destiny, we
must have a chart of the influencing vibrations, and
also a chart of the character influenced. By a com-
parison of the two sets of vibratory rates we can
determine, in the manner advocated by exact science,
what response will he brought forth from the char-
acter by the vibratory tone reaching it. ·
And so far as human beings are concerned, I know
of no method of accurately determining the various
vibratory rates - their power, their harmony and
142 The Sacred Tarot
discord, the department of life they affect, and the
lines of energy exchange between them- that reside
in the character, other than through the use of an
astrological birth-chart.
The astrological birth-chart is a complete map of
the astral body, revealing the strength and nature of
all its dynamic thought structures, and how they are
organized in relation to each other.1
It is a reliable
map of the character.
Any invisible energy, whether character radiation,
astrological radiation, or thought radiation, reaching
the astral body of the individual stimulates into addi-
tional activity the same tone to which it vibrates as
this tone exists already ·in the astral body. That is,
it gives the thought cells of the astral body new
energy. How this affects the individual then can be
determined by the map of the astral body which is
the astrological birth-chart.

Remember, then, son of earth, that before saying
of a man that he is fortunate or unfortunate, thou
must know the use to which he has put his will; for
every man creates his life in the image of his works.
The genius of good is at thy right and the genius
of evil at thy left. Their voice can be heard only by
the conscience. If the hierophant should appear in
the prophetic signs of thy horoscope, retire into the
sanctuary of thy heart, listen to the voice of the
silence, and guided by it thou wilt reach the goal of
thy aspirations.
In Divination, Arcanum V may briefly be read
either as Religion or Law.
Arc.anum Vis pictured by a hierophant, master of
the sacred mysteries. This prince of the occult doc-
trine is seated between two columns of the sanctuary;
he leans upon a cross of three bars, and with his right
hand makes the sign of the pentagram. From his
brow the sacred serpent thrusts its head; and at his
feet kneel two men, one dressed in red and the other
dressed in black.
The hierophant, supreme organ of sacred science,
represents the genius of good inspiration, of mind,
and of conscience.
The column at the right symbolizes divine law,
that on the left symbolizes the liberty to obey or to
disobey.
The triple tau, or cross of three bars, is emblem
of divine fire penetrating the three worlds, spiritual,
144 The Sacred Tarot
astral, physical, in order that all manifestations of
universal life may have their birth.
The left hand of the hierophant on the triple tau
indicates his receptivity to the divine force; and the
gesture of his right hand-making the pentagram-
indicates his use of this divine energy to command
the obedience of all sub-mundane atoms of life, and
to hear the voice of heaven in the silence of the pas-
sions and the instincts of the flesh.
The sacred serpent at his brow signifies enlighten-
ment; and the two kneeling men, the one red and
the other black, denote the intelligences of light and
shadow, both of wbom obey the force of the penta-
gram.
Number.-Numerically, 5 unites the first four
digits into a harmonious unity, and thus explains all
the apparent contradictions of nature. That is, the
One Principle, the One Law, the One Agent and the
One Truth are not independent factors, but imply
and mutually sustain one another.
These four ideas, as represented by the four ani-
mals standing at the four gates of heaven, each
quadrant of the sky having one, are brought together
in the fourfold form of the sphinx. And the zodiac,
so expressed, finds its counterpart in the constitution
of one man.
Thus man or woman alone is symbolized by the
number five. The hands, feet and head form five
positive points from which the electromagnetic fluid
is projected, health depending largely upon the equal
distribution of the energies to these five points. Also,
man. having passed through the four elemental
Reading The Meaning of Numbers 145
realms of being, becomes their rightful sovereign by
reason of his higher accomplishment.
In this sense, as 4 and 1, 5 signifies Realization
which comes from the use of Intelligence and Will.
For having attained true manhood, by virtue of
wider experience, man directs the various entities,
physical and astral, which have their orbits within
his domain, and these become his willing and obe-
dient servitors in proportion as they recognize his
spiritual supremacy.
Astrology.-Jupiter is the ruler both of law and
religion. He has dominion over good inspiration,
over the church and state, and over the authority of
established institutions. He governs popes, hiero-
phants and religious potentates of all kinds. The
correspondence, therefore, between Arcanum 5 and
the planet Jupiter iJ> so obvious as to need no further
comment.
Human Function.-The carrying power of the
will upon the physical plane depends upon the
strength of the electromagnetic forces. These, in
turn, depend upon the extent of vitalization-Arca-
num III. In other words, the power of the electro-
magnetic body, .and the carrying power of the will
on the physical plane depend upon the ability to
receive and transmit electromagnetic energies. These
energies circulate through the body and build up the
electromagnetic form even as the blood, ruled by
Jupiter, carries nourishment to the physical body.
Such receiving and transmitting are depicted by
Arcanu!TI V.
146 The Sacred Tarot
Alchemy.-The various metals used in alchemy
as they are collected are commonly found to contain
other ingredients which would prevent them from
properly combining in transmutation. Therefore, no
matter upon what plane the hermetic art is carried
out, there must be a tho.rough purification of the
metals used. In this process of purification the dross
is removed and cast aside and the true metal re-
tained.
In spiritual alchemy, for instance, the dross is the
apparent effect, while the real metal is the effect upon
the soul. The spiritual metals, therefore, are puri-
fied by considering them not in the light of events
influencing the material fortune, but as events which
each can be made to yield spiritual values by taking
the proper attitude toward them. In mental alchemy,
the metals are purified, not by considering their effect
upon the soul, but by casting aside the dross of dis-
cord and retaining the elements of harmony. Like-
wise, in other branches of the art, putification of the
metals, which corresponds to Arcanum V, is always
an essential step.
Bible.-The most significant thing about the hier-
ophant in Arcanum V is the sign of the pentagram,
or five-pointed st~r, which he makes with his right
hand. This is the symbol of man, the symbol of the
intellectual power which dominates the four ele-
mental kingdoms, and the symbol of the magical
force of the human will. It' gains its force by the
gesture which bears token that the user is obedient
to the laws of Deity, and thus participates in the
divine power over all things.
Reading The Meaning of Numbers 147
Arcanum V, an ensemble expressing the idea of
the pentagram in great detail, explains also the
blazing star that led the wise men of the East to the
place where the new sun-god was born that they
might worship him. Their gifts of gold, frankin-
cense and myrrh stand representative of the three
worlds; spiritual, astral and physical; symbolized in
Arcanum V by the triple tau.
These wise men, having been led by the star of
religious dev;otion, into a knowledge of the three
worlds and the laws governing them, departed into
their own country by another way. That is, having
gained illumination, their route to self-conscious-
immortality-the return to the realm of spirit-was
direct and certain, and not the devious path of the
yet unenlightened neophyte.
This five-pointed star which theyJollowed, has the
same import as Arcanum V, signifying the Divine
Law and Religion. Therefore, when it is inverted,
the point of the star representing the head of man
down, and the two points denotinJ?: his feet up, it
signifies the opposite of the Divine Law, the opposite
also of man governed by intelligence. Instead, it
then denotes chaos, the devil, evil inspiration and the
principle of destruction. Thus the Lamb of God is
transformed into the Goat of Mendes; and to ex-
press this, in black magic the symbol is made by clos-
ing the hand so that two fingers are up-the horns
of the goat, or feet of ma~-instead of three.
By such inversion Jupiter, or Jove, becomes Sat-
urn, or Satan, and as such is represented by Arcanum
XV. This is expressed in Rev. 8 :10; "And the third
148 The Sacred Tarot
angel sounded, and there fell a great star from
heaven, burning as it were a lamp, and it fell upon
a third part of the rivers, and upon the fountain of
waters, and the name of the star is called worm-
wood.''
The waters and fountains refer to the emotions
and to love, which in magical practices of any kind
are the chief sources of energy. They are turned
bitter, like wormwood, when thus utilized for pur-
poses of black magic and evil, for they are then
converted into forces of destruction. In Arcanum
XV, not only the lamp may be seen, but also the
s~rvants of evil in the art of making the inversive
sign.
The tarot itself expounds a complete religious doc-
trine based upon a spiritual science. And not only
do the Major Arcana set forth a system which is
synthesized as a mantram, for strengthening the will,
as explained in lesson No. 23, but they also synthe-.
size the Religion of the Stars.
Eliphas Levi, the great French magus, expressed
his conception of this religion in verse, setting at the
head of each line the number of the Major Arcanum
whose significance is revealed by it, each Arcanum
thus representing one tenet of this ancient Wisdom
Religion:
" 1. All things announce a conscious active cause,
2. Vivific Oneness, based on number's laws;
3. Who all containing is by naught confined,
4. And all preceding, hath no bound assigned.
5. This only Lord should man adore alone,
Reading The Meaning of Numbers 149
6. Who doth true doctrine to pure hearts make
known;
7. But acts of faith require a single chief,
8. Hence we proclaim one altar, law, belief.
9. The changeless God will never change their
base, ·
10. He rules our days and rules through every
phase,
11. His mercy's wealth, which vice to naught will
bring,
12. His people promises a future King.
13. The tomb's a path which to new worlds
ascends,
And life through all subsists, death only ends.
Pure, sacred, steadfast truth we here repeat
The venerated numbers thus complete.
14. The angel blest doth calm and moderate.
15. The evil is the friend of pride and hate.
16. God doth the lightning and the fire subdue;
17. He rules the dewy eve' and the evening's dew.
18. The watchful moon he sets to guard our
heights,
19. His sun's the source of life's renewed delights,
20. His breath revivifies the dust of graves
22. Where crowds descend who are of lust the
slaves;
0 Or, the mercy seat he covers with his crown,
21. And on the cherubs pours his glory down."
150 The Sacred Tarot
These impressive words are foll of mystic signifi-
cance, and when repeated in earnestness and with the
soul lifted to the Author of All Being, they form a
powerful inspirational mantram. The mantram of
the will, given in lesson No. 23, is especially potent
to increase the force, the power, and the accomplish-
ment of the will. But this religious mantram serves
another purpose.; for it adds Faith, unites the human
soul to its Maker, and thus lifts the will and its works
to a higher plane where their force is expended in
cooperation with the Divine Plan, and solely through
constructive channels.
These two mantrams, therefore, stand as the mas-
culine and the feminine of a complete system, the
best results following the use of both. Although
other methods may be used to advantage, one of the
best systems of training commences the day,, on ris-
ing, and while standing erect, with the mantram of
the will; and closes the day, while reclining in bed,
after retiring, with the mantram devoted to faith.
Thus used together they form natural complements,
and are important aids to soul growth.
Masonry.-The Past Master's degree of Masonry
is founded upon Arcanum V. It represents the Past
Master who having passed the degree of this initia-
tion is capable of presiding over a Master Mason's
lodge. The lodge, of course, represents the human
temple, over which the master must exercise constant
dominion. Therefore, to indicate the rebellion of
submundane atoms of life within the human domain,
in this degree a riot is started.
Unless the one who would be master can use the
Reading The Meaning of Numbers 151
force represented by the pentragram successfully to
quell the elemental forces, as is done in Arcanum V,
he is overpowered and made the slave of the very
forces he sought to control, as indicated in the fifth
degree of Masonry and illustrated by Arcanum XV.
Arcanum V also explains the Blazing Star of the
Masonic Lodge. The compass joined to the square
typifies both higher and lower union. Union is de-
picted by Arcanum Ill, and the Book of the Law, or
polarity, is depicted in Arcanum II. Adding the 3
and the 2 we get Arcanum V, picturing obedience to
that law, having thus the same symbolical import as
the open Bible on which is laid the compass and
square, as it is used in the fifth degree of Masonry.
Diamonds, the same suit in common playing cards
as Coins in the tarot, are nothing more nor less than
the united compass and square conventionalized, the
G being removed from the center to show that the
higher has superseded the lower.
Magic.--In Magic, Arcanum V expresses the im-
portance of using the proper symbols in all invoca-
tions and in ceremonial magic. It reveals the potency
of rituals and such symbols as are used by secret
societies and by the church.
The pentagram is the symbol of white magic, and
thus constitutes the most powerful of all magical
tokens; for it expresses the power of a mind which
has devoted itself to assisting the progressive evolu-
tion of creation, and which knows, and is obedient
to, the Divine Law. It is a symbol of constructive
purpose.
The use of signs, rituals and symbols either in re-
152 The Sacred Tarot
ligion or in magic is a means of contacting invisible
entities and other planes of being. The innocent use
of an evil symbol in the course of a rite does not
prevent the intelligence to which the symbol actually
belongs being contacted. No more so than if one
innocently calls the telephone number of a gangster,
thinking it is the telephone number of a parson, one
will fail to contact the gangster. Symbols and rituals
tune the individual in on the intelligence correspond-
ing to them just as a telephone number calls the in-
dividual to whom it belongs, regardless of his moral
worth, or the intention of the one calling the number.
lnitiation.-Arcanum V represents the point in
the ascending arc of the cycle of life where the voice
of the conscience calls upon man to turn from the
flesh-pots and devote himself to cosmic welfare. He
decides henceforth to live, not for self alone, but to
guide his every action in the direction of aiding cos-
mic progression. He determines that the good of
cosmic society shall be his constant aim.
Occult Science.-Masonry is that one of the seven
branches of magic which treats in particular of the
use of the emotions engendered by sex; and of the
evolution of the human·soul and its manifestations
on the three planes of being, as set forth by means of
signs, symbols and rituals.
In regard to such signs Eliphas Levi truly says,
"Four signs always express the absolute and are ex-
plained by the fifth. Thus the solution of all magical
questions is that of the pentagram, and all contradic-
tions are explained by harmonious unity."
As a single illustration of this method of solving
Reading The Meaning of Numbers 153
occult problems, and because astrology and the tarot
are the two keys to all mysteries, I will apply this
formula to denoting the true correspondence between
each tarot card and its astrological counterpart.
To begin with, the four suit cards of any num-
bered Minor Arcanum arrange themselves about the
Major Arcanum bearing the same number in the
form of a diamond; scepters being above, cups at
the right, swords at the bottom and coins at the left.
Thus arranged the four Minor Arcana express Jod-
He-Vau-He, and the Major Arcanum in the center
explains the pentagram as a whole as an expression
of some planet or zodiacal sign.
The rulership of each Major Arcanum can be
found in a similar manner by forming a Grand :fen-
tagram of the whole 22 cards, as illustrated at the
front of this booklet.
This diagram shows the grand pentagram as com-
posed of five lesser pentagrams, each perfect in
itself. And, of course, to be correct, the outer circle
of tarots must represent the twelve signs of the
zodiac in their natural position and sequence. The
planets, in nature, may occur in any of the signs
thus located; but their proper place here should bear
some significance in relation to life.
Thus the first quadrant, the quadrant of life, is
rightly explained by the selfish planet Saturn, show-
ing that self-preservation, among lower forms of
life, is nature's first law. But in the same quadrant,
and more interior to it, is to be seen Neptune, the
planet of universal brotherhood. And thus is also
explained that when life has evolve~ to a spiritual
154 The Sacred Tarot
conception, the law of self-preservation gives place
to that of unselfish idealism.
The top qu'adrant, the quadrant of honor, is occu-
pied by Uranus, indicating the struggle to make
attainment through the overthrow of existing condi-
tions and the dowr:ifall of opponents. But more in-
terior to this is· another principle which eventually
supersedes. The planet Venus sets forth the idea
that "Love lieth at the foundation," of any worth-
while attainment.
The third quadrant, that of companionship, is
occupied by Jupiter, indicating that leniency and gen-
erosity are attractive to others. But more interior
is to be seen Mercury, the planet of intelligence, in-
dicating that a lavish purse does not compensate for
lack of understanding, and that intelligence is neces-
sary to make union spiritually advantageous.
The lower quadrant, the home and the end of life,
is occupied by the Moon, indicating that physical life
ends in the tomb. Yet there is an inner force, a
lightning of the soul, typified by the planet Mars,
which defies death, rends asunder the tomb, or pyra-
mid, and liberates the soul to a new life in the
beyond.
And as explaining all, the pentagram in the cen-
ter holds the Sun, the source of all vitality, repre-
senting the ego which has sent its souls through the
cycle of necessity. And the result of this pilgrimage,
after the tomb has opened and liberated the souls, is
explained b)1 one of two symbols, that of the Earth,
or that of Pluto. The soul, even after death, may
be earth-bound, or held to the lower regions by its
Reading The Meaning of Numbers 155
viciousness; or it may move rapidly above the astral
into the spiritual realm to be reunited to its missing
mate. This latter is the higher aspect-represented
by the T with the point upward-of the planet Pluto.
The Fives.'-Jupiter, in astrology, is the general
significator of good fortune; therefore the fives in
their more common divinatory significance must re-
late to good luck in the·particular department of life
signified by the suit. But in their application to
higher planes, they reveal the influence of, and can
be interpreted by, the fjfth decanate of each zodiacal
triplicity, starting with the movable signs.
Th'e divinatory significance of the Five of Scepters
is good fortune in business; its inner interpretation
is REFORMATION.
The divinatory significance of the Five of Cups is
good fortune in love; its inner interpretation is RE-
SPONSIBILITY.
The divinatory significance of the Five of Coins is ,
abundant wealth; its inner interpretation is INSPI-
RATION.
The divinatory significance of the Five of Swords
is escape from a danger; its inner interpretation is
STRUGGLE.
THE TWO PATHS.-Arcanum VI. Letter:
Egyptian, Ur; Hebrew, Yau; English V-U-W.
Number, 6. Astrologically, the planet Venus. Color,
yellow. Tone, E. Ocq1lt science, kabalism. Human
function, the astral body. Natural remedy, rest and
recreation. Mineral. the metal copper.
156 The Sacred Tarot
U-6, expresses in the spiritual world, the knowl-
edge of good and evil.
In the intellectual world, the balance between lib-
erty and necessity. .
In the physical world, the antagonism of natural
forces, the linking of cause and effect.
Remember, then, son of earth, that for the com-
mon man, the allurement of vice has a greater fasci-
nation than the austere beauty of virtue. If The
Two Paths should appear in the prophetic signs of
thy horoscope, take care of thy resolutions. Obsta-
cles bar before thee the path thou wouldst pursue,
contrary chances hover over thee, and thy will
wavers between two resolutions. Indecision is, above
all else, worse than a bad choice. Advance or recede,
but do not hesitate; and know that a chain of flowers
is more difficult to break than a chain of iron.
In Divination, Arcanum VI may be briefly inter-
preted as Temptation.
Arcanum VI is figured by a man standing motion-
less at the angle formed by the conjunction of two
roads. His looks are fixed upon the ground; his
arms are crossed upon his chest. Two women, one
at his right and the other at his left, each place a
hand on his shoulder, showing him one of two roads.
The woman at his right is modestly clothed, and has
the sacred serpent, indicating enlightenment, at her
brow. She thus personifies virtue. The one at the
left wears less clothing, and is crowned with the
leaves and vine of the grape. She represents vice,
the temptress.
Reading The Meaning of Numbers 157
Above and back of this group the genie of justice,
hovering in a flashing aureole of twelve rays, draws
his bow and directs toward vice the arrow of punish-
ment. The genie is crowned with a flame to show he
is a spirit; and is represented in an aureole of twelve
rays to indicate that justice will be meted out in due
time to all as the sun passes through the zodiacal
signs.
This ensemble typifies the struggle between con-
science and the passions, between the divine soul and
the animal soul, and that .the result of this struggle
commences a new epoch in the life.
Number.-Six signifies two actions, or twice three.
It does not represent forces in equilibrium, but a
constant oscillation between action and reaction. It
thus indicates a wavering, a vacillation, forces so un-
controlled and ill-directed that they tend to destroy
one another.
Astrology.-Venus governs the affections and the
social relations. It gives love of ease, comfort, luxury
and pleasure. It is not essentially evil, but in seeking
the line of least resistance it may be led into vice.
When it thus fails to resist the importunities of the
wicked, it comes under the negativeness of Arcanum
II, and is then under the dominion of'Arcanum XV,
or Saturn, which is the second decave of VI.
Human Function.-Because the astral body is so
responsive to every thought and emotion it is often
called the desire body. The affections not only shape
it, but give it nourishment; for it is organized by
states of consciousness. Because it is so receptive
158 The Sacred Tarot
and yielding, and the emotions play so important a
p:ut in its makeup, this astral body corresponds to
Venus, and to.Arcanum VI.
Alchemy.-After the metals have been purified,
before they are finally joined in transmutation they
are first tested to be sure that no dross or impurities
remain. This process of testing the purity of the
metals, of applying the test of love, corresponds to
Arcanum VI.
Bible.-Of the sons of Isaac, Esau, who sold his
birthright (spiritual heritage) for a mess of pottage
(material things), listened to the voice of vice.
Jacob, however, who once successfully wrestled with
the spirit of temptation, and though affiicted was not
conquered, in this story listened to the voice of
virtue.
Math. 4 :8, "Again the devil taketh him up into
an exceedingly high mountain, and sheweth him all
the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them;
And said unto him, All these things will I give thee
if thou wilt fall down and worship me."
Maso'-ry.-The Most Excellent Master degree of
Masonry is founded upon Arcanum VI. "When the
Temple of Jerusalem was finished, those who had
proved themselves worthy by their virtue, skill and
fidelity, were installed as Most Excellent Masters."
Magic.-Arcanum VI represents the temptations
that always come to those who attain power. Espe-
cially is this temptation great among those who
attain to the use of invisible energies. Should they
yield to such insidious promptings, their lot is ter-
Reading The Meaning of Numbers 159
rible; for they become the slaves of the very forces
they imagined they had controlled. This Arcanum
also represents the use of privation, hardships and
obstacles to strengthen and test the will.
Initiation.-The evolving soul, passing through
the lower kingdoms, where strife and self-preserva-
tion are dominant factors, develops the animal pro-
pensities and instincts to a high degree. This is a
necessary phase of its progression. But when self-
consciousness has been reached, in order that the
animal may partake of the Divine quality which
makes self-conscious-immortality possible, these ani-
mal energies and instincts must be diverted into a
higher than animal channel. They must be directed,
or transmuted, into an organization of energy hav-
ing for object the welfare of society as a whole. This
higher-type organization, largely drawing its ener-
gies from the animal soul, or lower-type organiza-
tion, yet containing many higher vibration rates, is
called the divine soul.
Occult Science.- Kabalism, corresponding to Ar-
canum VI, and therefore the feminine, embraces the
written scriptures and the oral traditions of every
land. It is really the science of traditional knowl-
e~ge, the tarot being a condensation of the whole
science.
The Sixes.-Venus, in astrology, is natural sig-
nificator of love, art, music and drama, as well as of
social functions; therefore the sixes, corresponding
numerically to Venus, in their more common divina-
tory significance must relate to these things as
160 The Sacred Tarot
applied to the department of life indicated by the
suit. But in their higher application they reveal the
influence of, and can be interpreted by, the sixth deca-
nate of each zodiacal triplicity, starting with the
movable signs.
The divinatory significance of the Six of Scepters
is music, art 9r the drama; its inner interpretation is
AMBITION.
The divinatory significance of the Six of Cups is
a love affair; its inner interpretation is ATTAIN-
MENT.
The divinatory significance of the Six of Coins is
a social event; its inner interpretation is REPRES-
SION.
The divinatory significance of the Six of Swords
is dissipation; its inner interpretation is MASTER-
SHIP.
Method of Three Sevens.-After shuffling and cut-
ting, the cards are dealt from the top, one by one,
from right to left, starting with the bottom row, in
three rows of seven cards each.
The bottom row represents the past, the middle
row the present, and the top row the future. In each
row the central card, marked with ·an asterisk, is the
most important, being the key to which the others
merely contribute. In reading, the adjoining cards
modify each other, and all should be blended as parts
of a complete whole.

MAKING AN ASTROLOGICAL CHART
OF A NAME
HERE is just one way, in so far as I know,
of determining in a positive, reliable and
scientific manner how any invisible vibra-
tory torte, or combination of such tones,
will affect a certain person. That is by
comparing the tone, or tones, with the astrological
birth-chart of the person.
The planets and signs in a birth-chart each map
thought-cells of specific tones, as revealed by their
correspondences, which are .set forth in these lessons.
Any thought-vibration, character-vibration, or astro-
logical-vibration reaching the individual adds its
energy to the thought-cells having the same vibra-
tory rate in the astral body of the person. The chief
influence of a name, or number, as affecting a person
is to give added energy to the thought-cells of that
section of the astral body of the person which
vibrates to the Same rate as the Key-tone of the
name or number.
That is, to determine how a name or number or
other invisible influence will affect a person, first get
the Key of the name or number, or other influence.
This key is expressed by some number below 23.
Thus the Mars dynamic structure vibrates to the
tone 16, and the Virgo zone vibrates to tone 2.
Now if the Mars structure in a person's astral
body is very discordant, as shown by inharmonious

aspects to Mars in the birth-chart, any energy added
to its thought-cells by objects, by thoughts, ~r. other
influences vibrating to tone 16 merely increases the
power of these thoughts to attract such Catastrophe
as is pictured by Arcanum 16. But it 'the Mars struc-
ture in a person's astral body is harmoniously organ-
ized, as shown by Mars having strong beneficial
aspects in the birth-chart, this added energy will in-
. crease the power of its thought-cells to attract events
which are constructive and beneficial.
The pictured arcanum c9rresponding to each of
the signs and planets thus represents the moi:e com-
mon influence of the tone apart ·from lines of force
which, like aspects, conduce to harmony or discord.
But in the astral body of man these dynamic struc-
tures and zones, which vibrate to the tones so de-
picted, are usually strongly modified and influenced
by the manner in which they have been associated
with Qther thought structures. Therefo,re, w~ile
tone 15 may in general be considered as Fatality; in
a person's chart who has the plar;iet Saturn exceed-
ingly well aspected it might be the, most for.tunate
influence in the life, and the one which, when given
added energy, would bring the mast benefit.
Therefore, in determining how a.name, number,
environment, or other invisible influeilae will affect
an individual, the tone of the influence should first he
determined, and then a study should be made of this
tone as mapped in the astrological chart of birth. If
the tone.in the chart of birth is essentially beneficial,
the same tone received from a name, number, other
person, locality, birth-stone or anything else will be
168 The Sacred Tarot
beneficial; because it will increase the power of bene-
ficial thought-cells in the astral body. But if the tone
as mapped in the birth-chart is detrimental, the same
tone received from without, from any of the sources
mentioned, will tend, through giving discordant
thought-cells more energy, to attract misfortune.
Fortune or misfortune does not come equally
through all departments of life. And a particular
vibratory tone often stimulates one or two depart-
ments of life, and has little or no influence upon
other departments. It thus may have an influence
over finances and yet have no influence whatever
over health or companionship.
The department of life influenced by a vibratory
key is denoted by the compartment in the astral body
ruled by the sign or planet in the birth-chart whose
thought-structure is stimulated into activity by the
key. Thus, disregarding whether the influence will
attract or disperse it, if the key-tone is the same as a
planet in the house of money (2nd house), or the
same as the sign on the cusp of the house of money
(2nd), its chief effect, for good or ill, will be upon
money. But if the key-tone is the same as a planet in
the house of partnership (7th), or the same as the
sign on the cusp of the house of partnership (7th),
the chief influence will be upon the relation with
partners.
Now if on a pond of water there are several little
sticks floating, and someone throws a rock into the
pool, this disturbance of the water also disturbs the
little sticks and they go bobbing about. Likewise, if
there is one or several planets in a zodiacal sign in
Making an Astrological Chart of a Name 169
the birth-chart, because these planets represent or-
.ganized groups of thought-cells in that zone of the
astral body indicated by the sign, if the sign is given
increased activity, the groups of thought-cells in it
are set in motion.
The precise power of a dynamic thought structure
mapped by a planet or the common thought-cells
mapped by an unoccupied sign to attract good for-
tune when thus given increased activity is directly
proportional to its haqnodynes, and the precise
power of a dynamic thought structure mapped by a
planet or of the common thought-cells mapped by
an unoccupied sign to attract misfortune when thus
given increased activity is directly proportional to
its discordynes. How to calculate the astrodynes,
harmodynes and discordynes of each birth-chart
planet, sign and house is explained in lessons No.
197.and No. 198.
An unoccupied sign occupying one house cusp has
one-half the harmodynes or discordynes of its ruling
planet. An unoccupied intercepted sign has one-
fourth the harmodynes or discordynes of its ruling
planet. An unoccupied sign occupying the cusp of two
houses has the same number of harmodynes or dis-
cordynes as its ruling planet. Thus on an average
the influence of a planet is twice as important as that
of an unoccupied sign.
Thus it is that when we have before us that com-
plete map of the astral body of any individual, which
is a birth-chart, we can determine in a positive, scien-
tific and detailed manner how any invisible vibratory
rate of which we know the key will affect him. We
170 ' The Sacred Tarot
can determine if the particular key will tend to at-
tract to him fortune or misfortune. We can deter-
mine in what department of life that fortune or
misfortune will be attracted. And we can determine,
by calculating the astrodynes of the planet or sign
mapping the thought-cells within his astral body re-
sponding to this key and the probable volume of
energy added to them by the invisible influence, some-
what of.the magnitude of the events that will thus
be attracted into his life.
Now any name or any number can be converted
into an astrological chart by the simple expedient of
substituting the corresponding Major Arcanum for
each of the letters or numbers. Each Major Arca-
num also, of course, signifies a definite astrological
influence. '
These various letters of a name, or the astrolog-
ical influences substituted for them, each represent
one tone. Each letter of the name, therefore, as a
tone, has some influence in stimulating into activity
the corresponding tone in the astral body of the per-
son wearing the name. Sometimes in a person's
name certain letters are repeated several times.
Sometimes there will be several A's, for instance, or
the letter 1 may occur twice in each member of the
name. In such cases, naturally, the influence of the
particular tone so repeated is intensified, and may
be taken into consideration in its relation to affecting
the individual. But in all cases the Key of the name
as a whole is by far the most important vibratory
rate, and ·even letters that occur repeatedly in the
name are of subsidiary influence.
Making an Astrological Chart of a Name 171
To chart a name, therefore, we find the Key of
the number of the name, and set it at the head of the
chart as the dominant influence. In relation to the
name itself,, it represents the birth-chart. Then ,if
we desire to do so we find the Key of the Decave and
place it at the foot of the chart. It indicates the end
of things, that which the fourth house in an astro-
logical chart represents. Then the letters of the
name may be placed between the Key of the name
. and the Key of the Decave as transitory influences.
Reading a Name Alone Does Not Give a Reading
for the Individual Wearing It.-
. By using such a
chart we can give .a reading of any name. But be-
cause people wearing the same name are different
individuals, we must not assume .that a. reading of
the name alone gives a reading applicable to- the
individual wearing it. On. the contrary, to give a
reading of the individual wearing a name, even by
the process of divination by numbers, we must add
an individual element. This individual element
which is most suitable for such use is the Birth Path.
And the method of 'using it and giving such a
divinatory reading by means of numbers is set forth
in lesson No. 28.
Apart from any individual, however, and not in-
dicative of any person's fortune, we can make an
astrological chart of any name or any number which
will be scientifically correct; and to one delving in
spiritual research such a chart often will yield infor-
mation of value.
. Let us take the name Jesus, for instance. , J-10,
E-5, S-21, U-6, S-21. 10 plus 5 plus 21 plus 6 plus
172 The Sacred Tarot
21 equals 63. 6 plus 3 gives 9 as the Key of the
name. 63 minus 9 gives 54. 54. divided by 9 gives
6. 6 plus 1 gives 7 as the Key of the Decave. Then
the astrological chart may be stated thus:
Aquarius (9), Uranus (10), Jupiter (5), Sun
(21 ) , Venus ( 6) , Sun ( 21 ) , Sagittarius (7) .
As the birth date of Jesus is unknown we will
attempt no reading of his life. But the motive actu-
ating those who follow his doctrines is very appar-
ent. The Key of the influence is Aquarius, or Major
Arcanum IX, signifying Prudence and Circumspec-
tion. The prudence of the followers of Jesus causes
them to accept Him in the expectation of finding
heaven and escaping hell. And the end for which
they hope, both here and hereafter, is Sagittarius, or
Major Arcanum VII, signifying Victory. "Onward,
Christian Soldiers," as sung in thousands of Sunday
schools, might well be inspired by the pictured Arca-
num VII with its conqueror riding forward to over-
come opposition.
Aside from astrology let us consider the vibratory
significance of some other holy names: The Jews
called their stem and unyielding God, Jehovah,
spelled in Hebrew, Jod-He-Vau-He (I-E-V-E): 10
plus 5 plus 6 plus 5 equals 26. 26 being more than
22 must be involved. 2 plus 6 gives 8 as the Key
of the name. 26 minus 8 gives 18. 18 divided by
9, plus 1, gives 3 as the Decave. Thus the Key and
the Decave, 8 and 3, indicate the moral code of
Jehovah to have been inflexible Justice in Action.
To proceed with other deific names, the chief
deity of Christianity is spelled G-0-D: 3 plus 16
Making an Astrological Chart of a Name 173
plus 4 equals 23. 2 plus 3 gives 5 as the Key of the
name. 23 minus 5 gives 18. 18 divided by 9, plus
1, gives 3 as the Decave. The Key and the Decave,
5 and 3, thus indicate that.the idea behind the Chris-
tian God is beneficent (Jupiter) Law in Action.
Now turn to the deity of Egyptian initiates, Ra.
R-A: 20 plus 1 gives 21, which needs no involving
because it is already a Key, pictured by Arcanum
XXL Ra is thus, according to its Key and its astro-
logical ruler, the spiritual Sun of our universe; the
highest spiritual and intellectual entity; and those
who worship Him strive to become the most spiritual
and intelligent men on earth; · they strive to be
adepts. Astrologica.lly, Ra is the Sun. The religion
of His devotees is expressed still more in detail by
the two arcana picturing the two letters of the word,
20 and 1, signifying Will and Intelligence ( 1), Res-
urrecting (20), the soul beyond the tomb.
What is the vibratory import of the Hindu deific
word used so frequently as a mantram, and rendered
into English as A-U-M? 1 plus 6 plus 13 equals
20. The Key (20) reveals that the object sought
is to Awaken (20), the soul to its latent possibilities.
The method employed to do this is indicated by the
three letters: The Will ( 1), brought to bear upon
Temptation (6), to induce a Transformation ( 13).
And this rendering of a foreign name brings up a
point of some importance; that of the different ways
of spelling a name.
Again I would call your attention to the principle
that it is not the sound of a name, nor its phonetics,
with which we are dealing, but its astral vibratory-
174 The Sacred Tarot
rates. These astral vibratory-rates are set in motion
by the person thinking the name, and they are set up
irrespective of vocal action. Nor do people of dif-
ferent countries, who spell a name differently, have
the same conception of its significance.
Because with most people, according to psycho-
logical experiments, sight registers its impressions
more quickly and more strongly than sound, the
spelling of a name commonly determines its thought-
vibration when it is thought about. The English
spelling, therefore, only indicates the vibratory sig-
nificance of the name to those who use the English
spelling. Any alteration of the spelling of a name,
even though the ·phonetic value is unchanged, thus
changes the vibratory-rate and .the inner meaning of
the name. The native spelling of a name gives its
significance to such natives.
Buddha: 2 plus 6 plus 4 plus 4 plus 8 plus 1
gives 25. 2 plus 5 gives 7 as the Key. 25 minus 7
gives 18. 18 divided by 9, plus 1, gives 3 as the
Decave. Thus our conception of the life and teach-
ings of this great reformer is Victory (7), of mind
in Action (3) .
Brahma: 2 plus 20 plus 1 plus 8 plus 13. plus 1
gives 45. 4 plus 5 gives 9 as the Key. 45 minus 9
gives 36. 36 divided by 9, plus 1, gives 5 as the
Decave. This deity, therefore, to us signifies Wis-
dom (9)'acting through Law, (5).
· Vishnu : 6 plus 10 plus 18 plus 14 plus 6 equals
54. 5 plus 4 gives 9 as the Key. 54 minus 9 gives
45. 45 divided by 9, plus· 1 gives 6 as the Decave.
This god of preservation therefore exemplifies the
\
Making an Astrological Chart of a Name 175
thought that Wisdom .(9) overcomes Temptation
(6).
Siva: 21 plus 10 plus 6 plus 1 equals 38. 3 plus
8 gives 11 as the Key.. 38 minus 11 gives 27. 27
divided by 9, plus 1 gives 4 as the Decave. The
Hindu trinity, Brahma, Vishnu and Siva are usually
translated as Creator, Preserver and Destroyer. But
while Siva does represent destruction, it is a destruc-
tion which implies a restoration, or reproduction,
and thus the linga is used as his emblem. And this
significance is conveyed by Force ( 11), undergoing
Realization (4) .
Devil : 4 plus 5 plus 6 plus 10 plus 12 equals 37.
3 plus 7 gives 10 as the Key. 37 minus 10 gives 27.
27 divided by 9, plus 1 gives 4 as the Decave. The
Devil thus is the agent for a Change of Fortune
(10), Realized (4).
Hell: 8 plus 5 plus 12 plus 12 equals 37. 3 plus
7 gives 10 as the Key. 37 minus 10 gives 27. 27
divided by 9, plus 1 gives 4.as the Decave. Hell,
therefore, is a Change of Fortune ( 10), Realized
(4).
The early Magi erected a tower to Bel: . 2 plus
5 plus 12 gives 19 as the Key. As it is already below
23 no Decave ·influence need be considered. We
chart this name in detail thus-19 (Key)-2-5-12,.
and read it as Happiness and Prosperity ( 19) de-
voted to Science ( 2), Religion ( 5), and Sacrifice
( 12).
Later generations forsook the worship of Bel for
Baal: 2 plus 1 plus 1 plus 12 gives 16 as the Key. ·
176 The Sacred Tarot
In detail it indicates that the desire for violence ( 16)
prompted the energies to be turned to Science (2),
Will ( 1), Intelligence ( 1), and Sacrifice ( 12).
Babylon: 2 plus 1 plus 2 plus 10 plus 12 plus 16
plus 14 equals 57. 5 plus 7 gives 12 as the Key. 57
minus 12 gives 45. 45 divided by 9, plus 1 gives 6
as the Decave. Babylon is mentioned in Revela-
tions as the great prostitute; which is borne out by
its vibratory significance which reads Sacrifice ( 12),
to T empta.tion (6) .
The above examples, I b~lieve, are quite ample to
denote how names may be handled as factors in
themselves, apart from their influence upon any par-
ticular individual. But I must repeat, because it is
so frequently overlooked by those who practice
numerology, that when the influence upon an indi-
vidual is to be revealed, or a reading is to be given
an individual based on his name, that there is always
an additional individual factor which must be in-
cluded.
THE CONQUEROR.-Arcanum VII. Letter:
Egyptian, Zain; Hebrew, Zayin; English, Z. N um-
ber, 7. Astrologically, the zodiacal sign Sagittarius.
Color, the lighter shades of purple. Tone, high A.
Occult science, spiritual astrology. Human function,
the sense of smell. Natural remedy, such herbs as
mallow, wood betony, featherfew, and agrimony.
Mineral, the talismanic gem red garnet (often called
carbuncle), and such stones as are mixed with red
and green, including turquoise.
Z-7 expresses in the spiritual world, the sep-
tenary dominion of spirit over matter.
Making an Astrological Chart of a Name 177
In the intellectual world, the sacerdocy and the
empire.
In the physical world, submission of the elements
and forces of matter to the intelligences and forces
of man.
Remember, then, son of earth, that the empire of
the world belongs to them who possess the sover-
eignty of spirit,, that i~ to say, the light which makes
clear the mysteries of life. If the Conqueror should ap-
pear in the prophetic signs of thy horoscope, it signifie1i
that in breaking through obstacles thou wilt crush
thy enemies; and all thy wishes will be realized if
thou attack the future with audacity, armed in the
consciousness of thy right. ,
In Divination, Arcanum VII may briefly be read
as Victory.
Arcanum VII is figured by a war chariot of square
form, surmounted by a starry ·canopy sustained by
four columns. Upon this chariot advances a con-
queror armed with a cuirass and carrying both sword
and scepter. He wears a crown from which rises
three pentagrams, or golden stars with five points.
The square car symbolizes the material world
vanquished by the work of the will. The four col-
umns supporting the canopy represent the fc;mr quad-
rants of heaven which surround the conqueror. They
also repre~ent the four elemental kingdoms that
have submitted to the master of the scepter and the
sword.
Upon the square front of the chariot is pictured
a sphere sustained by two outspread wings; symbol
of the immortal flight of the soul through the infini-
178 The Sacred Tarot
tude of space and time. The sacred serpent at the
conqueror's brow signifies the possession of that in-
tellectual light which makes clear all the arcana of
fortune. The three golden stars rising from the
crown symbolize the dominion of man in all three
worlds; physical, astral and spiritual.
A T-square and two try-squares are traced upon
the cuirass. The T-square, or Tau, symbolizes virile
force, and the two try-squares indicate the rectitude
of judgment that enables the conqueror to direct this
force either to right or left, into mental or physical
power as occasion demands.
The cuirass signifies resistance; the high held
sword is the emblem of physical victory; and the
scepter indicates mental conquest. This scepter is
surmounted by a square, a circle, and a triangle.
The square is the emblem of matter, the circle indi-
cates the realm of spirit, and the triangle is the
emblem of mind; together denoting the perpetual
dominion of intelligence ov.er all r-ealms and forces
of natur:e.
Two sphinxes, one white and the other black, are
harnessed to the car. A sphinx, as composed of the
four emblems of the zodiacal quadrants, indicates
the passage of time. The white sphinx signifies for-
tunate periods, and the black one signifies periods of
adversity; both of which serve the soul victorious
over the ordeals met in its pilgrimage of eternal
progression.
Number.-Numerically, 7, as composed of the
numbers 3 and 4, expresses action and completion.
It is the number of perfect form on the physical
Making an Astrological Chart of a Name 179
plane. It is thus the septenary, which is the com-
plete and perfect three-dimensional gamut; even as
9 is the complete and perfect four-dimensional
gamut. A scale of 7 is better, therefore, to indicate
physical tones and electromagnetic vibrations; but a
scale of 9 is more convenient to indicate astral tones
and thought-vibrations. Thus in three-dimensional
existence where perfection of form exists it will be
found that the number 7 expresses it as 3 and 4.
The 3 are active principles. The 4 are reactions, or
forms.
In human life 7, as composed of 3 and 4, express
the concrete 4 dominated by action, or 3; the realiza-
tion of physical perfection through active effort. As
composed of 5 and 2, it indicates man in full posses-
sion of the law of polarity, realizing the potency of
sex force. As composed of twice 3 plus 1, it signifies
body, soul and spirit united to body, soul and spirit,
guided by intelligence and under control of will; thus
representing the perfect nuptial union. It is do-
minion of intelligence over all actions, hence com-
plete Victory over all Temptations.
Astrology.-Astrologically, Sagittarius is pictured
as the starry Centaur, with bow full drawn, indicat-
ing its combative qualities and its locomotion. Sagit-
tarius is a dual sign, adapting itself to both scepter
and sword. It is natural ruler of philosophy and
travel; its chief mental characteristics being obedi-
ence to ruling authority, discipline, prompt decision,
self-control and the power to command others. The
conservative attributes are well represented by the
cuirass; and the other qualities are all symbolized
180 The Sacred Tarot
in detail by the various pictured emblems of Arca-
num VII.
Human Function.-It has been explained that the
planet Jupiter corresponds to the electromagnetic
body. This body is nourished by the electromagnetic
energy liberated from protein molecules, as explained
in lesson No. 64. The electromagnetic energy of the
nervous system enables it both to broadcast and re-
ceive short-wave radiations. As an aid to tuning in on
the desired wave-length incense has been found help-
ful. Through stimulating the sense of smell in the
proper way the mind is directed to a certain state of
consciousness, which raises or lowers the individual's
vibrations, tuning him in on the grade of energy it
is desired to contact. Thus does the sense of smell
correspond to Arcanum VII.
Alchemy.-The various ores from which the
metals to be used in the process of transmutation are
obtained are not of equal richness,, and are not of
equal suitability as furnishing the required metals.
And when the metals are extracted from these ores,
or are otherwise obtained, they are not of equal
purity, or of equal value. Thus it is that every in-
gredient used in the process should be assayed to de-
termine its refinement, to determine its value,. and to
determine how best it may be treated to purify it to
the extent required if it is to be used in the alchem-
ical work.
In spiritual alchemy, for instance, each experience
needs to be appraised as to its possibilities of pro-
viding spiritual values, and to determine exactly
Making an Astrological Chart of a Name 181
what attitude will recover the highest percentage of
these spiritual values. In mental alchemy, a still
different appraisal is made to determine the value in
terms of harmony, and the treatment necessary to
gain these values in highest measure. Such determi-
nations are secured through assaying, which corre-
sponds to Arcanum VII.
Bible.-}oseph, sold into Egypt, representing the
soul born into matter and fettered by carnal desires,
represents Arcanum VII.
But Joseph overcame all obstacles and i:ose to
great power, as indicated by the sword. And in ad-
dition to having at his command the material forces
thus indicated, he also became an interpreter of the
Divine will, as symbolized by the scepter.
He was tempted by Potiphar's wife, Arcanum VI,
but he Triumphed (Arcanum VII) over the tempta-
tion, even though it meant certain affliction. The
dream of Pharoah which pe interpreted, of the 7
fat kine and the 7 lean kine, and the 7 good ears
and the 7 bad ears, related to periods of good and
evil, such as the white sphinx and-the black sphinx
of Arcanum VII signify. The result of his triumph
through periods of good and periods of evil, and of
his not yielding to temptation, is set forth in Gen.
41 :41, and is symbolical of what may be expected
by others who triumph over temptation; for they
also shall be made rulers over the physical plane,
which is the land of Egypt.
"And Pharaoh said unto Joseph: See, I have set
thee over all the land of Egypt. And Pharaoh took
off his ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph's
182 The Sacred Tarot
hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and
put a gold chain about his neck: and made him to
ride in the second CHARIOT which he had: and
they cried before him: Bow the knee: and he made
him ruler over all the land of Egypt."
Masonry.-The Royal Arch degree of Masonry
is based upon Arcanum VII. The chariot, like the
tabernacle, is an oblong square; but instead of being
divided into four veils the canopy is supported by
four columns.
The captivity iI1 Babylon is denoted by the square-
formed chariot; a11d the release from bondage by the
scepter. The return journey to Jerusalem ·~s denoted
by the two sphinxes hitched to the wheeled car. The
arcanum also symbolizes the vault into which the
candidate is lowered; where he finds the Ark of the
Covenant containing the four emblems which are
the suits of the tarot cards. Of these the scepter
represents the rod of Aaron; the sword is the symbol
of the tablets of the law, the gomer is representeu
by the cuirass, and the sacred .serpent indicates the
manna, or intellectual food.
The three jewels, or trying squares of the three
ancient Masters, are to be seen on the cuirass, and
the wonderful scroll, which is the key to the ineffable
characters of the degree, is present as the starry
canopy overhead. The long lost Master Mason' s
Word, which is recovered in the Royal Arch, is fully
exemplified by the four symbols mentioned, and is
written in three languages as indicated by the golden
stars. All of which, plainly stated, signifies harmo-
nious union of positive an.d negative forces, such as
Making an Astrological Chart of a Name 183
the Masortic trowel suggests, on all three planes of
existence.
Magic.-ln magic, Arcanum VII represents the
power of projection, of sending the astral form to a
distance; and the power of attraction, of compelling
the astral of another to appear and obey_whatever
commands may be given. And it is also of the same
symbolical import as the Seal of Solomon, the two
interlaced equilateral trines.
Next to the pentagram, Solomon's Seal is the most
important magical diagram; for it represents the
macrocosm and its laws, thus indicating its user to.be
familiar with nature, and to be endowed with in-
telligence.
lnitiation.-ln the soul's pilgrimage, Arcanum
VII indicates physical initiation completed. It shows
proficiency in both science and magic. The tempta-
tions of the material world have been surmounted
and the .neophyte has gained complete mastery of
self. The body is under the control of a disciplined
will, and whatever knowledge concerning spiritual
things is ()btainable in the external world has been
gained.
The scepter · and the sword balance each other,
positive and negative, indicating that the neophyte
has a partner whose physical temperament, mental
polarity, and spiritual aspirations are in complete
harmony with his own. And as shown by the Tau
and squares on the cuirass, they both ,implicitly obey
the divine laws governing physical union, having
mastered which they become candidates for regener-
184 The Sacred Tarot
ate union as signified by Arcanum XIV, and later
for true soul-union represented by Arcanum XXL
Neither 7 nor 14 are decaves of 3, the number of
union; but 7, composed of 3 and 4, expresses union
and its issue, which is perfection of form. And the
multiples of 7, though not decaves of 7, relate to
some octave of the perfect form.
Occult Science.-Spiritual astrology reveals the
facts which the wisest men of all time have learned
regarding the nature of the soul, its destiny, and how
it may best make progress. Such facts have been
recorded still more specifically in the pictured con-
stellations. These pictured constellations thus form
a positive key to the sacred books of the world, and
give detailed instructions on how the soul may best
proceed to scale the spiritual heights.
The Sevens.-The sign Sagittarius is general sig-
nificator of philosophy, long journeys, publishing,
teaching and out-of-doors sports; therefore the Sev-
ens, corresponding numerically to Sagittarius, in
their more common divinatory significance must re-
late to these things as applied to the department of
life indicated by the suit. But in their higher appli-
cation they reveal the influence of, and can be inter-
preted by, the . seventh decanate of each zodiacal
triplicity, starting with the movable signs.
The divinatory significance of the Seven of Scep-
ters is success in teaching or publishing; its inner
interpretation is DEVOTION.
The divinatory significance of the Seven of Cups
is a successful change of home; its,inner interpreta-
tion is VERITY.
Making an Astrological Chart of a Name 185
The divinatory significante of the Seven of Coins
is money earned through a journ1:y; its inner inter-
pretation is INTUITION.
The divinatory significance of the Seven of Swords
is danger through travel or sport; its inner interpre-
tation is ACHIEVEMENT.
THE BALANCE.-Arcanum VI11. Letter: Egyp-
tian, Helitha ; Hebrew, Cheth; English, H ;. Ch.
Number, 8. .Astrologically, the zodiacal sign Capri-
corn. Color, the darker shades of blue. Tone, low
G. Occult science, horary astrology. Human func:-
tion, the sense of hearing. Natural remedy, such
herbs as henbane, nightshade and black poppy. Min-
eral, the talismanic gem sardonyx1 and ash-colored
or black minerals such as coal.
H-8 expresses in the spiritual world, absolute
justice.
In the intellectual world, attraction and repulsion.
In the physical world, relative justice, fallible and
limited, which comes from man.
Remember, then, son of earth, that to be victori-
ous over thyself and dominate obstacles is but a part
of the human task. To accomplish it entirely thou
must establish equilibrium between the forces that
thou. hast brought into play. All action produces
reaction. The will should foresee the shock of oppo-
site forces in order to temper or annul them. If the
Balance should appear in the prophetic signs of thy
horoscope, it signifies that the future is balanced be-
tween good and evil, and warns that an unbalanced
mind is like an abortive sun.
186 The Sacred Tarot
In Divination, Arcanum VIII may be read as
Justice or Equilibrium.
Arcanum VIII is figured by a woman, blindfolded
and seated upon a throne. She wears a crown of
lance-heads, holds in her right hand a raised sword,
in her left hand a balance, and from her brow the
sacred serpent thrusts its head.
This is the ancient symbol of justice, which weighs
all acts and opposes to evil as a counterweight the
sword of expiation. Justice, emanating from God,
as symbolized by the overshadowing protection, is
the equilibrium between right and duty.
Justice is crowned with lances to indicate inflexi-
bility, ad.orned with the sacred serpent to signify she
acts with enlightenment, and her throne is placed on
a platform of three steps to represent her action in
all three worlds. At her side is a lion, symbol of the
force over which she rules; and a sphinx, symbol of
the passage of time which enables her to manifest.
Above is a winged turtle, symbol of the repentance
which may bring forgiveness. At the back is a divine
messenger, signifying that the justice of God will be
the final judge of the justice of men. The sword is
here a sign of protection to the good and a menace
to the wicked.
The eyes of Justice are covered with a bandage to
show that she weighs and strikes without taking into
account the conventional differences that men estab-
lish for themselves.
Number.-·Numerically, 8 expresses complete bal-
ance and equilibrium, hence stagnation and death.
As composed of two fours it indicates two realiza-
Making an Astrological Chart of a Name 187
tions of an opposite nature, and is thus the antithesis
of progress. In nature it signifies the polarization
of the forces that bind together, or that produce
motion; hence dissolution of matter and inactivity
of energy. It is the number of annihilation, uncon-
sciousness and mortality. ·
Astrology. - Perfect equilibrium of forces pro-
duces crystallization. A solid is the result of an
equilibrium established between at least eight forces.
First, two forces converge. And about this point of
equilibrium two forces meet from above and below,
two from right and left, and two from behind and in
front; eight forces in all, well represented by a cube
with its six faces and a center. Verily, matter is
nothing but spirit in a state of equilibrium. · The
most earthy sign of the zodiac, the sign which the
sun enters when life's forces are lowest ·and . the
waters and vapors of earth crystallize into ice and
snow, is Capricorn. Capricorn well expresses that
equilibrium which results in crystallization, and thus
corresponds to Arcanum VIII.
Human Function.-·Capricorn is receptive, and is
also a reflective zodiacal sign which pertaUis · to
earthly endeavor. These qualities which express as
receiving and not giving, of utilizing all to its own
advantage, are well typified by the sense of hearing.
It is often quoted that where speech is silver silence
is gold; and Arcanum VIII pictures this stable atti-
tude of listening.
Alchemy.-ln all branches of alchemy different in-
gredients are brought together. And it is of utmost
188 The Sacred Tarot
importance that they shall be present in just the right
amounts. In order that they shall form the proper
fluxes for each other, and in order that some essen-
tials shall not be too small in quantity, the ingre-
dients are weighed. If there is not sufficient of some
substance, as indicated by such weighing, it must be
sought out and added to the mixture. Both the
weighing and the seeking of ingredients thus found
lacking, correspond to Arcanum VIII.
Bible.-The descent of the spirit into matter, and
the result of the equilibrium so established is set ·
forth in Gen. 3 :19: "In the sweat of thy face shalt
thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground: for
out of it wast thou taken, and unto dust shalt thou
return."
Surely the wages of sin is death; but the only real
death is the polarization of the spiritual forces by
the animal propensities as indicated in Rev. 3:16:
"So, then, because thou art lukewarm, and neither
cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of ~y mouth."
Still more explicit, as indicating the reaction upon
those who once see the truth and later turn to evil
ways, turning .back from a higher vibratory level to
selfish motives, is the account of Lot's wife, Gen.
19 :26: "But his wife looked back from behind him,
and she became a pillar of salt."
Masonry - The Royal M aster degree is founded
upon Arcanum VIII. As a Just reward for the most
skillful and faithful Masons in building the Temple,
it was decided to impart to them the Omnific Word
as soon as the Temple was completed. "And behold
Making an Astrological Chart of a Name 189
I come quickly: and my reward is with me, to give
every man according as his work shall be," etc. It
also represents the judgment which ultimately was
passed upon the assassins of Hiram Abiff, and the
state of disintegration in which the body of Hiram
was found.
Magic.-Nothing is more sure than that in magic
any thought or desire projected to another will in
time return to influence the sender. The magical
forces of the soul traverse the spaces almost in-
stantly and fasten upon the object of its ceremony,
and may act with terrible force: But if such a force
launched toward another has not the power to pene-
trate his aura it at once reacts upon the sender and
affects the other not at all.
In repelling any evil influence there should be no
thought either of vengeance or of mercy, but instead
an attitude of unbending justice. Efforts at retalia-
tion attract fearful dangers. To launch a destructive
thought is to attract denizens who are destructive by
nature, and who may linger long afterwards.
Initiation.-In the soul's pilgrimage a time comes
when the individual accepts some definite work to
perform for the benefit of humanity. In carrying out
this spiritual work, his body must have sustenance.
Thus he can not entirely ignore the physical, nor
can he devote his energies exclusively to financial
ends. He also has certain 0bligations to his family
which he should not ignore. Too much energy spent
in gaining wealth and caring for the physical body
prevents the accomplishment of the spiritual work;
190 The Sacred Tarot
and upon his faithfulness to it depends his further
progress. Thus he must learn to "Render, there-
fore, unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and
unto God the things that are God's."
Occult Science.-Horary astrology depends upon
the relation between the mental factors and the
positions of the 1 heavenly bodies. A question re-
ceives additional stimulation when the factors corre-
sponding to it in the sky reach such a situation as to
represent the facts concerning it. This equilibrium be-
tween the mind of man and the astrological influences
at the time he is stimulated to ask a question, per-
mits the astrologer to give a correct answer to the
question.
The Eights.- The sign Capricorn is general sig-
nificator of station, honor, business, and govern..
ment affairs; therefore the Eights, corresponding
numerically to Capricorn, in their more common di-
vinatory significance must r~late to these things as
applied to the department of life indicated by the
suit. But in their higher application they reveal the
influence of, and can be interpreted by, the eighth
decanate of each zodiacal triplicity1 starting with the
movable signs.
The divinatory significance of the Eight of Scep-
ters is a p9litical appointment; its inner interpreta-
tion is EXPLORATION.
The divinatory significance of the Eight of Cups
is extravagance; its inner interpretation is SELF-
SACRIFICE. .
The divinatory significance of the Eight of Coins
Making an Astrological Chart of a Name 191
is a costly law suit; its inner interpretation is
FIDELITY.
The divinatory significance of the Eight of Swords
is loss of honor, or business failure; its inner inter-
pretation is EXPERIENCE.
The Magic Seven Spread.- Ten completes a cycle,
but seven completes a form. Common divination is
concerned with external life, hence with form, the
problems of which are readily solved by the applica-
tion of the Seal of Seven, or Solomon's Seal, as.it is
commonly called.
This Seal is an astrological chart in abstract;
for the sum of the angles of the two triangles equals
360 degrees, measuring exactly, but in a more con-
crete form, the number of degrees in a circle. The
six external points of the star, together with the point
in the center, express the planetary septenary in
terms of Jod-He-Vau-He, both above and below, the
final He, or product, being common to both and
occupying the center of the star.
To use this magical figure as a tarot spread, first,
as usual, clearly formulate the information sought
and keep it constantly in mind while shuffling and
cutting the cards. Then deal them face downward,
one by one, on the points of an imaginary six-point
star, in the order shown in diagram on frontispiece,
the seventh card taking the center.
Turn the cards over one at a time, and read as
turned.
The first card dealt, the upper Jod, signifies the
past of the matter inquired about. It is the Cause
of the present condition.
192 The Sacred Tarot
The second card dealt, the upper H e, represents
the present of the thing inquired about. It is the
effect of past causes already indicated.
The third card dealt, the upper Vau, signifies the
past and present united. It represents the immediate
future of the matter.
The fourth card dealt, the lower Jod, represents
the power of the individual to control the matter.
It is also the influence of those favorable to it to
control the matter through initiative and effort.
The fifth card dealt, the lower He, designates
the part that fate and environment will play in the
matter.
The sixth card dealt, the lower .Vau, shows the
combination of fate and individuals in the future tak-
ing the form of opposition to the venture.
The seventh card dealt, the final He, correspond-
ing to the seventh seal of the Apocalypse, reveals all
the factors of past and future after they have under-
gone gestation and given birth to the final issue. It,
therefore, represents the result of the thing asked
about.
At the front of this booklet both Hebrew charac-
ters and planetary symbols are added to the figure to
assist those studiously inclined to discern the astral
and kabalistical meaning of the seal, and the method
used in divination. These additional characters need
not be considered by those interested in divination
only. The question asked may embrace any phase
or activity of life, .and thus the ·application of this
method in divination is universal.

INFLUENCE OF
CHANGING THE NAME
-.lf.~1\.... HE USE of the name as a divinatory in-
strument is the use to which it is put in the
various systems of numerology. And be-
because divination may be approached from
so many angles and yet give good results
it does not follow that any of the different
systems of numerology in use are valueless.
The method we have found to give the best results
is set forth in the next lesson.
But the use of the name as a vibratory influence
that affects the individual wearing it in a particular
way is not related to divination. Nor can there be
more than one interpretation which is correct, of the
vibratory force exerted by a particular name as
affecting a given individual. The vibration of a
name, or of a number, is a positive thought-force of
a definite quality; as much so as that light-vibrations
of a certain frequency give rise to the color blue.
You can not correctly call blue red, yellow, green or
some other color. Such is the difference between the
systel,11 I am now explaining and numerology.
A name has a definite thought-vibration quality
which is radiated to the individual by everyone who
thinks of him by that name. If different people think
of him by different names, they thus bombard him

with different types of thought-vibration. But be-
cause an individual usually thinks of himself by the
name he customarily uses as his signature, and be-
cause the thought-vibrations of the person wearing
the name probably have more influence upon him
than the combined thought-vibration of all others
who think about him, the way an individual signs his
name becomes very important as a vibratory in-
fluence in his life.
If such a signature were something unalterable
this would be an interesting but not very useful fact.
But as a matter of observation, it is quite common
for people in all walks of life to use a different sig-
nature at different periods in the life: using an initial
instead of a given name, dropping the use of a middle
name or initial, or even changing the spelling of the
name. A woman when she marries, and therefore
coincident with a marked change in her fortune, com-
monly changes her name. Others, also, who change
the spelling of their name, or alter the signature, are
discerned to change in fortune coincidentally. A
change in name is nearly always accompanied by a
change in the life.
Writers quite commonly use a pen name, and
actors, more frequently than not, use a stage or
screen name. And these names by which they are
known to the public not only influences them accord-
ing to the key of the name, but also from a divina-
tory standpoint often markedly differentiates their
public life from the private life in which they are
known by another name.
The practical application of the knowledge of
200 The Sacred Tarot
thought-vibrations, character-vibrations and astro-
logical-vibrations is in selecting those invisible in-
fluences which assist to bring into the life the things
which are desired, and which prevent attracting
events and conditions which are undesirable.
The Positive, Scientific Metbod.-Yet one can not
know, by a positive method, what types of astral
vibrations will prove beneficial and what types detri-
mental, and in what way this benefit or detriment
will manifest, without a map of the astral body,
such as is furnished by the astrological birth-chart.
But with the astrological birth-ch.art at hand, it can
at once be seen just what the effect will be upon the
life of stimulating into unusual activity any particu-
lar section of the astral body, or any particular cen-
ter of energy in the astral body. Even the connecting
aerials, or aspects, between such centers of energy
are there clearly shown, so that the effect upon other
departments of life through secondary influences can
also be determined in advance.
A scrutiny of an astrological birth-chart will re-
veal to anyone who has even a slight acquaintance
with astrology just what zone of the astral body, or
what thought structure, it is advisable to give added
force. If the individual wishes to attract favorable
conditions in some special line, a glance at the birth-
chart will reveal what influence there shown most
pronouncedly is beneficial to it. Then by stimulating
this influence, by using a name having the same key-
tone, and by having things in the environment which
radiate the same key-tone, the activities of this favor-
able influence can be built up in a manner that will
Influence of Changing a Name 201
markedly attract the condition desired into the life.
The changing of the name, it will thus be seen, if
the change causes the name to vibrate to a different
key, adds the thought-energy of all those who think
of this name in connection with the individual, to
some different section or center in the astral body,
and this causes a change in the fortune commensu-
rate to the transfer of energy thus effected.
Unless the individual wishes especially to ~timu­
late some one thing in his life in a favorable manner.
the best plan in selecting a name or the objects and
people of the environment, is first to find what in-
fluences in the birth-chart are more fortunate. This
can be determined in a general way by inspecting
the house positions and aspects of the planets. But
by calculating the harmoqynes and discordynes of
the chart the relative harmony and discord of each
planet and sign can be precisely determined.
It may be desirable to give the added intensity
to a section of the astral body not occupied by a
planet because the department of life it rules may
be deemed more important. When this is the case,
the favor or disfavor that may be expected from
such stimulation is determined by the harmony of
the planet ruling the sign governing the zone thus
selected. The common thought-cells of the astral
body are mapped by the signs, and the dynamic
thought-cells by the planets. The power and har-
mony or discord of an unoccupied sign is one-half
that of the planet ruling the sign.
In seeking the influence that will conduce most to
the general good fortune the best planet and the
202 The Sacred Tarot
best sign in the chart should be located. Then, if
possible, the name should be spelled, abbreviated, or
otherwise altered, so as to have the same key as
the best planet or best zodiacal sign. If a sign is
occupied by a planet, or planets, accentuating the
sign also accentuates the planet, or planets, in the
sign. As a planet has twice as much influence as the
unoccupied sign it rules, the harmony or discord of
a planet, or planets, in a sign may be more important
than the harmony or discord of the planet ruling the
sign elsewhere located. Thus in selecting the best
zodiacal sign, the harmony' or discord of any planet,
or planets, in it must be given due consideration.
Usually without much alteration a name may be
given such spelling or abbreviation as to cause it to
vibrate to the key which has been selected as most
desirable. A long name, however, can not vibrate to
_Key 1, and thus accentuate the influence of Mercury
in the astral body; for to get this key the number
of the name must be either 1 or 100. A name vibrat-
ing either to the number 99 or the number 198 gives
key 18 ; but to get key 19 the number of the name
must be either 19, which is low, or not less than 199,
which is quite high for the ordinary run of names.
Yet when it is desired to get a special type of
vibratory key in the name-for there is no number
above 21 which gives key 21 until 399 is reached,
and thus it is impractical to accentuate the Sun
thought-cells in the astral body through using key
21-often almost the same result may be had by
accentuating the sign the Sun occupies in the birth-
chart. Thus if the Sun were the only planet in Virgo,
Influence of Changing a Name 203
the number 101-1 plus 0 plus 1 gives 2 (Virgo)-
would accenuate key 2, and because the Sun thought-
cells are in Virgo, it would be the influence chiefly
accentuated. Of course, Mercury, as the ruler of
Virgo, would be somewhat stimulated, wherever lo-
cated; but the most pronounced influence would be
the energy thus added to the Sun structure.
To illustrate by a personal example: When the
author was selected to write the various lessons and
other publications issued by The Brotherhood of
Light, he felt it advisable to use a distinct name for
these publications that would indicate that whatever
appeared under this name had the sanction of The
Brotherhood of Light, and was, therefore, in this
respect authoritative.
In addition to his occult interests he is also a
naturalist, writing and lecturing on natural history
subjects. He also has, as does everyone, a private
life. And while it is unlikely that any of his
private opinions would differ from those of The
Brotherhood of Light, he did not wish to carry the
responsibility of having any chance utterance he
might make in an unguarded moment quoted as a
Brotherhood of Light doctrine. So he decided he
would select a pen name, that whatever appeared
under that name should have the weight and careful
thought of a Brotherhood of Light teaching; and
that he would retain the name Elbert Benjamine for·
business purposes and for such writings as he did on
other than occult subjects.
Now as he had entered into an agreement with
The Brotherhood of Light to write a series of
204 The Sacred Tarot
courses of lessons, each of the 21 occult sciences to
be treated in a separate course, and ultimately to be
published as a separate book, he felt that the chief
requisite of the name should be to stimulate the tend-
ency and ability to study and write about occult sub-
jects. The announcement of the titles of these 21
courses to be written was made in the Declaration of
Principles.published early in May, 1915.
ln his birth-chart the author has the sign Aquarius
on the cusp of the third house, the house of writing.
Its ruler, Uranus, is the most elevated planet in the
chart. The aspects it receives are not all beneficial;
but some of them are strongly harmonious, and
those that are not, tend to attract just such discords
as any person must attract who ventures to write
and publish ideas that are as yet unaccepted by the
vast majority of the race. So to give an impetus
both to writing and to the acquisition of occult
knowledge (for Uranus as ruler of Aquarius gov-
erns occultism) he decided that the chief thing to
add energy to was the zone of his astral body ruled
by Aquarius. The name, therefore, must vibrate to
key 9.
Because the ability to gain information from the
inner planes is chiefly ruled by the planet Neptune,
and because it is the best planet in his birth-chart,
it was thought advisable also to accentuate key 11.
This could be done, although only in a minor de-
gree, by using the initial C. ·
There were other considerations also of a sym-
bolic nature. Zain (or Z) is the seventh letter of
the Egyptian alphabet, and not only means victory,
Influence of Changing a Name 205
but corresponds to the sign Sagittarius, which is the
natural ruler of the house of religion. And the writ-
ing and work to be accomplished was of a religious
character; the re-establishment of The Religion of
The Stars. Z also is a very peculiar letter, represent-
ing two 7's, one above and one below. Also 7 is an
open trine, indicating giving out rather than receiv-
ing; and it was the author's purpose in issuing The
Brotherhood of Light lessons to give as wide dis-
semination, both to material facts and to spiritual
doctrines, as possible.
Furthermore, the author is a double Sagittarian;
that is, he has Sagittarius both for a rising sign
and for a Sun sign. So that not only were th.e vibra-
tory ends sought gained by the use of C. C. Zain as
a pen name-C-11, C-11, Z-7, A-1, 1-10, N-14: 11
plus 11 plus 7 plus 1 plus 10 plus 14 gives 54; 5
plus 4 gives key 9 adding energy to the section of
the astral body ruled by Aquarius-but it is an ac-
curate translation of the strongest influences in his
birth-chart into letters combined in a name. Who-
ever, therefore can read this name aright, can know
the source from which these writings come, the
motives prompting their expression, the method by
which the information they contain was gained, and
much about the inner life of the author.
The name in full, given as a tarot chart is-IX-
XI-XI-VIl-1-X-XIV-VI. This may be
read as Wisdom (9), and early Spiritual Power
( 11 ) , followed by Psychic Strength ( 11 ) , leading to
Victory ( 7) over obstacles. Will and Intelligence
( 1), after a time dictate a Change of Fortune ( 10)
206 The Sacred Tarot
and this brings Regeneration ( 14) and still other
Trials ( 6).
Changing a Name.-At first thought it may seem
that using a name in business other than that con-
ferred at birth is exceptional other than in a few
professions. But a little reflection will indicate that
most 'people in business abbreviate, or otherwise
alter the name, in usir,g it as a signature.
And because people become familiar with this
signature, it becomes more strongly associated in
their minds with the person using it than any other
name. The person signing himself in a given way,
because he writes.his name thus, and both makes and
sees the signature, comes tu think of himself accord-
ing to the signature as written. And the name by
which an individual thinks of himself, because his
own thoughts are more powerful to influence his life
than the thoughts of others, is commonly the most
important name of all.
Therefore, because the business signature deter-
mines the thought-vibrations sent him by those who
see this signature, and the thought-vibrations which
he generates when he thinks c;>f himself by name, it
should be selected with an end in view of stimulating
some department of life as desired, in a favorable
manner. This is done by selecting for a business
signature a name the vibratory key of which corre-
sponds to the sign or planet in the birth-chart most
favorable to the department of life it is wished to
strengthen.

The Sage. - Arcanum IX. Letter : Egyptian,
Thela; Hebrew, Teth; English, Th. Number, 9.
Astrologically, the zodiacal sign Aquarius. Color,
the lighter shades of blue. Tone, high G. Occult
science, mental alchemy. Human function, clair-
audience. Natural remedy, such herbs as myrrh,
frankincense and spikenard. Mineral, the talismanic
gem, sky-blue sapphire, and such stones as obsidian
and black pearl.
Th-9, expresses in the spiritual world, absolute
wisdom.
In the intellectual world, prudence, director of the
will.
In the physical world, circumspection, guide of
actions.
Remember, then, son of earth, prudence is the
armor of the wise. Circumspection enables one to
avoid snares and abysses and to foresee treason.
Take it for thy guide in all thy actions, even in the
least. Nothing is indifferent here below. A pebble
can overturn the chariot of the master of the world.
If Arcanum IX should appear in the prophetic signs
of thy horoscope, keep in mind that speech is silver
and silence is gold.
In Divination, Arcanum IX may briefly be read
as Wisdom or Prudence.
Arcanum IX is figured by an old wanderer lean-
ing on a staff and carrying before him a lighted
lamp which he half conceals behind his mantle. This
sage personifies experience gained in the journey of
!ife. The cloak is of square form, symbolizing the
physical world in which man may acquire knowledge
208 The Sacred Tarot'
of good and evil. That this knowledge has been
gained is signified by the man having partially re-
moved the cloak of material limitations, and by the
lamp, emblem of intelligence, shedding its rays over
the past, present and future. The lamp being con-
cealed by the mantle symbolizes discretion, and also
expresses the truth that if we are ever to know the
real nature of anything we must delve deep beneath
the cloak of external appearances.
The staff, which in form is the sixth letter of the
Egyptian and Hebrew alphabets, indicates that man
progresses through struggle, alternately overcoming
obstacles and being vanquished by them, and that
when finally he realizes he only develops his abili-
ties through recurrent efforts to triumph over diffi-
culties, this knowledge becomes his staff of prudence
supporting him in all his endeavors.
Number.-Nine is the Deific number, the highest
digit, which possesses the unique property that it
may be multiplied by any number and the digits so
obtained when added together always resolve into
9. On the inner-plane, where thought - vibrations
and astral-vibrations of all kinds become effective,
9 is the perfect scale, even as 7 is the perfect scale
of physical form. Such vibratory rates, consequently,
are measured by decaves instead of by octaves.
As the multiples of 9 resolve, when their digits
are added, into 9, it is the symbol of manifested
Deity whose different manifestations may all be re-
duced to the one primal source. It is the figure un-
locking the cycles of the ancients, and as composed
of 3 times 3 indicates action on all three planes.
Influence of Changing a Name 209
As composed of 4 plus 5 it represents man realizing
all earth can teach, and thus is the number of wis-
dom. As consisting of 7 and 2 it adds polarity, intui-
tion and wisdom, to the union of man and woman,
giving knowledge of good and evil, or wisdom gained
through union. As 8 and 1 it is death, mortality and
stagnation overcome by will and intelligence; hence
new action, life, immortality.
Astrology.-The zodiacal sign of the Sun, Leo,
is represented by the symbol of a serpent. This
serpent, natural ruler of the fifth house of a birth-
chart, and thus of pleasures and love affairs, is the
symbol of desire.
And while the Man of the zodiac, Aquarius, is
represented commonly by the two wavy lines repre-
senting water from the urn, these wavy lines were
also depicted in ancient times as two serpents, or
two desires, one traveling in either direction. De-
sires thus kept in equilibrium through knowledge
gained in experience with good and evil are true wis-
dom. Hence the serpent is sometimes referred to
as the tempter. and sometimes as the essence of wis-
dom. Math. 10 :16; "Be ye therefore wise as ser-
pents and harmless as doves."
This is a clear statement of the import of Arca-
num IX. The love nature is signified by doves, which
are sacred to Venus; and the power of Aquarius to
properly direct the love nature is indicated by the
reference to wisdom. Aquarius astrologically repre-
sents the highest form of intelligence, expressing
progressively in scientific and occult interests, such
as are depicted in the arcanum of the Sage.
210 The Sacred Tarot
Human Function.-The highest wisdom, such as
symbolized by the Sage, comes both from within
and from without. Experience with good and evil
is garnered in the external world and stored to-
gether with the experiences garnered in the interior
realms. The two sources of knowledge are thus
symbolized by the two wavy lines, anciently also
depicted as two serpents. The Sage thus not only
has listened to the teachers in the external world,
but he has also been guided by those speaking from
the inner plane; and to hear them he has developed
the faculty of clairaudience, which thus corresponds
to Arcanum IX.
Alchemy.-In alchemical processes of any kind,
danger is sure to be present if the conditions ate
forced. Transmutations, for instance, can not be
made to take place instantly. They require time.
To try to alter a condition too quickly is apt to
result in an explosion. Whatever energies are pres-
ent must be taken care of through gradually divert-
ing them into those channels which will promote the
object sought. More failure in alchemical work re-
sults from undue haste and impatience for ·results
than from any other ca.use. The prudence which
alone enables the alchemist to be successful in his
endeavors is depicted by Arcanum IX.
Bible.-In the Bible we find that the tempting
serpent of desire denied the word of God that man
would die when he should eat of the forbidden fruit.
"For God doth know that in the day ye eat there-
of, then your eyes shall be opened; and ye shall be
as gods, knowing good and evil." (Gen. 3 :4) .
Influence of Changing a Name 211
But it is true that when spirit descended into mat-
ter it died to its celestial nature and was no longer
pure and innocent. Yet through yielding to Temp-
tation (Arcanum VI) and entering into material
mcarnation, the words of the serpent also were veri-
fied: Gen. 3 :7 ; "And the eyes of them both were
opened, and they knew that they were naked, and
they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves
aprons."
That is, after partaking of the Tree of Good and
Evil they gained knowledge and immediately put
forth an effort to overcome matter and Triumph
over circumstances, as indicated by Arcanum VII.
After the Judgment (Arcanum VIII) of the
transgression - 8 expressing crystallization - we
learn: "Unto Adam, also, and to his wife, did the
Lord God ·make coats of skins and clothed them."
In other words, they had spiritual bodies while liv-
ing in the realm of spirit, but upon descending to the
material plane they were clothed with physical bod-
ies. The result of incarnation through the various
lower life-forms is symbolized by coats of skins,
verifying the wisdom of the serpent, and in the final
result being depicted by Arcanum IX. Gen. 3 :22;
"And the Lord God said, behold, the man is become
as one of us·, to know good and evil."
Still another reference to Arcanum IX is Solo-
mon's choice of Wisdom instead of worldly goods.
Masonry.-The Select Master degree of Masonry
is founded upon Arcam..im IX. It signifies the ninth
arch of the secret vault of Solomon's Temple, where
are stored exact copies of all that is contained in
212 The Sacred Tarot
the sanctum sanctorum above. It is what might be
called the lowest degree of adeptship on the physical
plane, being the Intellectual degree in which man has
recognized the correspondence between the heaven
above and his soul. Arcanum IX corresponds also
to the three triangular tables arranged in a row with
a triangular plate of gold in the center of each and
a lighted candle at each corner. It corresponds like-
wise to the three times three of the ritual.
Magic.-ln Magic, Arcanum IX corresponds to
the various magical methods of obtaining informa-
tion about occult subjects.
In such endeavors there are two chief methods
which are followed. One is to leave the physical
body and travel in the astral form. Through this
process it is possible to visit the homes of the dead,
to sit at the feet of the wise in the Halls of Learn-
ing on the astral pla~e, and to gather information
through personal contact and observation, while the
physical body slumbers on earth.
The other method, which is beset with far fewer
dangers, is to tune in on the plane from which it is
thus desired to gain information. In this tuning in
process the proper astrological conditions are usually
observed, and often it is assisted by an appropriate
ceremony.
lnitiation.-In the soul's pilgrimage, Arcanum IX
indicates the attainment of cosmic consciousness.
Upon arriving at this state of his upward ascent
the neophyte is able to discern the proper relations
of the various entities in the universe, both to him-
self, and to each other. This is not merely an intel-
Influence of Changing a Name 213
lectual conception, but is borne home to him also
through tuning in on the universal organism. He
recognizes that each soul is being trained to perform
a work which the expansion of the cosmic organiza-
tion makes needful.
As a result of this higher state of consciousness
he comes to recognize quite clearly the nature of his
own function in universal work, and thus sets about
his task with the knowledge that he is a valuable
factor in the scheme of things, with ·a certain and
definite mission to perform. And upon his faithful-
ness in performing what he comes to recognize as
his present task in contributing to cosmic welfare,
depends his future opportunities for progression.
Quite important in arriving at this higher state of
consciousness, wherein he perceives his cosmic work,
is the development of his affectional relations. That
is, the power to tune in on either higher or lower
states is chiefly regulated by the emotions. Passion
and gross expression, therefore, must be supplanted
by more exalted expressions of love. That which is
gross and degrading tends to tune the mind in on
lower states. But acts which engender strong emo-
tions of tenderness, and kindly feelings that are so
expansive as to embrace all, and which uplift the
energies in intense desire for noble work, are the most
effective agents known to tune the ,individual in on
higher realms and to develop cosmic consciousness.
Cosmic elementals-sylphs, salamanders, undines
and gnomes-as well as magnetic elementals such
as fauns, elves, nymphs and fairies, have relation to
man; but they are not dependent upon him for in-
214 The Sacred Tarot
tellectual and spiritual force, as are the so-called de-
grees of life. Yet his thoughts and desires do arouse
them into activity, and may enlist them in the per-
formance of such work as is within their special
province. His proper relation to all such. life-forms,
and the work he should do aiding ~osmic progres-
sion, are revealed to him when he attains cosmic
consciousness.
Occult Science.-Mental alchemy treats of the
mental factors and how they may be made most
effective to attract into the life just the conditions
required. The process consists largely in transmut-
ing discord into harmony and in providing the proper
flux to annul undesirable conditions.
Under Arcanum V we found that four signs ex-
press the absolute and are in turn explained by a
fifth. And now, rather paradoxically, we find that
9 symbolizes the absolute in expression. But if we
use the lamp of the Sage to look beneath the sur-
face of this apparent contradiction, we find that 5,
or intelligent man must have a medium through
which to express ; a place in which to move and work,
as signified by the square mantle of the Sage. This
universal medium, of course, is symbolized by the
number 4. Thus Arcanum IX sheds much light
upon how mantrams, suggestions and the processes
of mental alchemy bring about their results.
For those with a penchant for symbolism to add
further light upon their researches, this whole sub-
ject will be given clarity through a study of the dia-
gram, page 34 of lesson No. 22. The square marked
1 should be colored yellow; 3 should be colored
Influence of Changing a Name 215
green; 5 should be colored purple; 7 should be col-
ored red, and 9 should be colored violet. These are
the five odd, or active, numbers. The colors yellow
and red signify power (love) and motion (life).
However, activity must take place in a medium,
which is represented by the four squares marked
with even numbers, which should be colored the
other primary, blue. Then the squares 5 and 3 rep-
resent the reaction of yellow and red on blue, and as
stated are purple and green. And the central square,
representing the highest vibration, the evolution of
all below, should be colored violet.
Finally, the border around the whole figure, the
solar combination of power and activity, should be
colored orange.
The Nines.-The sign Aquarius is general signifi-
cator of friends, associates, hopes and wishes; there-
fore the nines in their more common divinatory
significance must relate to one of these things, ac-
cording to the particular department of life signified
by the suit. But in their higher application they re-
veal the influence of, and can be interpreted by, the
ninth decanate of each zodiacal triplicity, starting
the count from the movable signs.
The divinatory significance of the Nine of Scep-
ters is a wise and profitable friendship; its inner
interpretation is ILLUMINATION.
The divinatory significance of the Nine of Cups is
that the hopes will be realized; it is fhe WISH-
CARD; its inner interpretation is VICISSITUDES.
The divinatory significance of the Nine of Coins
216 The Sacred Tarot
is money spent on associates; its inner interpretation
is REASON.
The divinatory significance of the Nine of Swords
is a quarrel resulting in enmity; its inner interpreta-
tion is RENUNCIATION.
The Wheel. - Arcanum X. Letter: Egyptian,
Ioothi; Hebrew, Jod; English, I-J-Y. Number,
10. Astrologically, the planet Uranus. Color, daz-
zling white, like snow in the sunshine. Tone, the
astral chimes. Occult science, natal astrology. Hu-
man _
function, intuition. Natural remedy, electricity
and mesmerism. Mineral, uranium.
1-10, expresses in the spiritual world, the active
principle which vivifies all being.
In the intellectual world, the governing authority.
In the physical world, good and evil fortune.
Remember, then, son of earth, that for power
thou must will, that is, will strongly; thou must
dare, and to dare with success thou shouldst know
how to be silent until the moment of action. If the
Wheel should appear in the prophetic signs of thy
horoscope, know that to possess the Key of Power
you must learn to will persistently only for what is
goo_
d and true. And in order to maintain thyself
upon the heights of life, shouldst thou reach them,
thou must have learned how to sound with a look,
and without dizziness, the vastest depths.
In Divination, Arcanum X may be read as Change
of Fortune.
Arcanum X is figured by a wheel of eight spokes
suspended by its axis upon a dual column. At the
right Hernanubis, genius of good, strives to mount
Influence of Changing a Name 217
to the summit of the circumference. At the left,
Typhon, genius of evil, is precipitated. On a circular
platform in equilibrium on the Wheel, is poised a
sphinx, holding in its claws a javelin. At the foot
of the dual column two serpents raise their heads.
This is the wheel of destiny. The circular plat-
form upon which the sphinx stands represents the
zodiac; and the sphinx, as a composite of the four
constellations marking the zodiacal quadrants-
Eagle, Lion, Man and Bull-signifies the passage
of time.
It holds a javelin in its claws to indicate that time
is always fructifying events and ever ready to strike
to right or left as the wheel turns under its impul-
sion, raising the humble and lowering the proud.
The eight spokes of the wheel, eight being the
number of justice, symbolize that time and oppor-
tunity, in the course of divine providence, are justly
meted out to all. The dual column supporting the
wheel indicates that all nature is polarized into posi-
tive and negative. The serpents signify that the
law of all action is that of sex.
Number.-The number 10 represents the com-
pleted cycle, and therefore the starting point of an-
other. It thus indicates transition to a new phase,
or plane, of existence.
The absolute having expressed itself through all
the various manifestations up to and including 9,
which signifies perfection of consciousness in addi-
tion to perfection of form, commences a new gamut.
1 is the absolute unmanifest, and 9 is the perfection
of its manifestation.
218 The Sacred Tarot
In humanity, as composed of two 5s, 10 indicates
the whole man to consist of both man and woman,
and that their union commences a new and higher
phase of existence; that is, that it enables them to
contact a higher plane of endeavor. 1 symbolizes
will and intelligence, and 10 shows that they are
now used by both in a new and higher field of en-
deavor.
Astrology.-Uranus is the octave expression of
Mercury, even as Arcanum X is the second decave
of Arcanum I, ruled by Mercury. The unsexed
quality of Uranus is depicted in Arcanum X by the
two serpents in equilibrium.
Uranus transits one sign of the zodiac in about 7
years, and the whole zodiac, completing the circle
through the 12 houses of a horoscope, in about 84
years. That is, it corresponds to perfection of form
in each department of life, its complete cycle coin-
ciding with the present natural life of man. More
than any other planet it gives sudden changes of
fortune, either for good or for evil, and sudden
change of the mental viewpoint.
Human Function.-ln natal astrology it is found
that those individuals who have Uranus prominent
in their birth-charts have the ability to short-cut
their reasoning. Instead of the ordinary slow mental
process of the objective mind, the processes are car-
ried out by the unconscious mind which has more
complete data at its disposal, and which acts almost
instantly in drawing conclusions from them. These
conclusions thus arrived at then rise into the ob-
jective consciousness as intuition.
Influence of Changing a Name 219
Alchemy.-No matter what the plane of alchemi-
cal procedure, it is a decided aid to observe the astro-
logical conditions which are operative at the time.
The energies of the planets have an influence upon
all processes, and it is easier to perform a given type
of work when the astrological influences favor it.
Of course, alchemical work of many kinds can not
await favorable conditions. But the knowledge that
astrological influences are hindering at certain times,
both incites to more careful and energetic effort and
prevents discouragement when it is observed that
small progress is being made.
Bible.-Arc.anum X depicts the Wheel of Ezekiel.
Ezek. 1:15 ; "Now, as I beheld the living creatures,
behold, one wheel upon the earth by the living crea-
tures, with his four faces." These faces were the com-
posite symbols embraced in the sphinx; the Lion, the
Eagle, the Man and the Bull.
The genii on the wheel of Arcanum X are men-
tioned thus: Ezek. 1 :13 ; "As for the likeness of
the living creatures, their appear~nce was like burn-
ing coals of fire, and like the appearance of lamps: it
went up and down amid the living creatures: and the
fire was bright and out of the fire went lightning."
The change in the fortune of Solomon also has to
do with Arcanum X. I Kings, 2 :3; "And he had
seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred
concubines; and his wives turned away his heart."
Masonry.--The Super Excellent Master degree
of Masonry is based upon Arcanum X. Its ritual
depicts the fate of Zedekiah, who did evil in the
220 The Sacred Tarot
sight of the Lord, and underwent a sudden and ex-
treme change of fortune.
Magic.-In magic, Arcanum X represents the orbit
of action of the blessing and cursing energy of the
human soul. This orbit is elliptical, with a peri-
odic action of its own, sure to react upon the indi-
vidual; for to cause a condition in another one must
create within himself the matrix of that condition.
It is quite useless to fight a discordant emotion or
a discordant thought sent to one by another. To
fight it merely draws the attention to it and thus
tunes in on its vibrations and enables them to gain
a still greater potency. Thinking about either a har-
mony or a discord adds enei:_gy to it and gives it
more force·.
Wheth.er it be events, the thoughts and emana-
tions of people who think discordantly but without
malice, or the actual malicious attempt to in;ure one
by black magic; in all cases anxious attention feeds
the undesirable condition. And except to recognize
that it has an existence and should be thwarted, the
discord and its source should be ignored. And in
addition to this judicious indifference, the attention
should be given as enthusiastically as possible to
something harmohious. A discordant vibration can
not live in the same place as a harmonious vibration.
Initiation.-As the soul progresses up the spiral
a
1
scending way of attainment, it gradually refines its
organism to the end of living a richer life. On both
planes, however, there is always the impact of en-
vironment; and some of the conditions contacted are
sure to be discordant.
Influence of Changing a Name 221
If, therefore, the life-form occupied by the soul
becomes sensitive without at the same time develop-
ing the power of control there may be actual danger.
No matter how sensitive it becomes, so long as the
soul has the power to direct the thoughts and atten-
tion, no other entity can gain control of the organ-
ism or do it injury from the inner plane. But if
sensiti~ness becomes greater than the power of con-
trol, other entities or discordant conditions are able
to hold the attention and can cause the individual to
suffer.
Yet as abilities are developed only through the
effort to overcome such obstacles as are shown by
progressed afflictions in the birth-chart, at the state
of progress here considered, astrological afflictions
are viewed as opportunities to develop ability, and
astrological harmonies are viewed as opportunities
to use the abilities thus developed in assisting uni-
versal progression.
Occult Science.~Natal astrology is the science of
discerning the character from a map of the men-
tal factors within the astral body as pictured by the
birth-chart; and of determining when certain events
will have a tendency to be attracted due to the stimu-
lation of these mental factors by energies from the
planets.
Here also should be mentioned the doctrine of
the Ten Emanations of the Sephiroth. The kahalis-
tical scheme of three pillars is given in most works
on the kabala, hut someone a hundred or more years
ago inserted a blind by placing Hod on the left and
Netzach on the ri~ht, knowing that real intimates
222 The Sacred Tarot
would discern that Netzach is the victory of woman.
Yet t~is error has been copied by kabalistical writers
ever smce.
The correct astrological correspondences of each
emanation has not been placed in writing before, but
the chart at front of this booklet gives the emana-
tions in proper sequence and relations. Above all is
the Limitless Light, Ain-Soph-Aur ( 1) . Pluto, is
Kether, or Crown, the point of differentiation, where
soul-mates separate and where ultimately they must
again rejoin.
(2) Neptune is Chocmah, or Wisdom. (3) Ura-
nus is Binah; or Intelligence. (4) Jupiter is Chesed,
or Merer.. (5). Saturn is Geburah, or Justice. (6)
Venus is Tippereth, or Beauty. (7) Mars is Netzach,
or Victory. (8) Mercury is Hod, or Splendor. (9)
Moon is Yesod, or Foundation. ( 10) Sun is Mal-
kuth, or Kingdom. And below all is the region of
Adonai-Shekinah.
Benefic planets, of course, are on the tree of good,
and malefic planets on the tree of evil, while Pluto,
Venus, Moon and Sun form the Shekinah, or Tree
of Life.
The upper story of the diagram is Atziluth, or
Emanation; the next lower is Briah, or Creation;
below this is Yetzirah, or Formation; and the low-
est of all is Assiah, the realm of Action.
Of course, the river that waters the garden of
Eden and parts into four heads is the planet Venus
in the diagram and the four lines radiating from it.
Each of the 10 emanations manifests in all four
kingdoms, and the 12 triangles of the circumference
Influence of Changing a Name 223
are the 12 houses of a birth-chart; the 32 lines in the
circumference representing t:he paths of wisdom.
The ten emanations operating through the four
kingdoms, or suit cards _of the tarot, are expressed
in verse by Mr. A.-E. Waite admirably, thus:
"Four signs present the Name of every name.
Four brilliant beams adorn his Crown of flame.
Four rivers from his Wisdom flow.
Four proofs from his Intelligence we know.
Four benefactions from his Mercy come.
Four times four sins avenged his justice sum.
Four rays unclouded make his Beauty known.
Four times his Conquest shall in song be shown.
Four times he Triumphs on the timeless plane.
Foundations four his great white throne maintain.
One fourfold Kingdom owns his endless sway.
As from his crown there streams a fourfold ray."
The Tens.-The planet Uranus is general signifi-
cator of uncommon pursuits, of sudden changes of
fortune, of inventions, discoveries, and of unconven-
tional relations and actions; therefore the tens in
their more common divinatory significance must re-
late, according to their suit, to one of these things.
But in their higher application they reveal the in-
ftuence of, and can be interpreted by, the zodiacal
triplicities.
The divinatory significance of the Ten of Scepters
is an invention or discovery; its inner interpretation
is ENTHUSIASM.
The divinatory significance of the Ten of Cups is
a decidedly unconventional affectional interest; its
inner interpretation is EMOTION.
224 The Sacred Tarot
The divinatory significance of the Ten of Coins
is alternate financial loss and gain; its inner interpre-
tation is ASPIRATION.
The divinatory significance of the Ten of Swords
is sudden loss of employment; its inner interpreta-
tion is PRACTICALITY.
Spread of the Kabala.-·When the influence and
outcome of anything is sought, the cards may be
dealt on a diagram similar to the one at the front of
this booklet, one after the other, until 10 cards are
laid out according to the sequence there indicated.
The cards of the Tree of Good are on the right,
and indicate favorable events. The cards of the Tree
of Evil are on the left, and indicate unfavorable
events. The four cards in the middle are on the Tree
of Life, and represent the outcome.
Card 1 signifies the spiritual result, and card 10
the material result. 6 is the result concerning life
and love, and 9 the result as affecting the home.
The cause of the influence exerted by each card is
signified by its kabalistical name. Thus if on 2, Wis-
dom is the cause; if on 3, Intelligence is behind it; if
on 4, Mercy has an influence; if on 5, there is a de-
sire for Ju'stice. 6 indicates love of Beauty, 7 desire
for Victory, 8 Splendor and show, 9 home condi-
tions, and 10 physical power as distinct from spir-
itual aspirations signified by 1.

ECAUSE the name John Brown when pres-
ent in any person's mind always radiates
the same component thought vibrations,
and always reverberates to the same vibra-
\:'2l~~ tory key, it is easy to map the influences of
this name in a positive and scientific manner. And
by substituting the divinatory significance of each
numerical factor, it is possible to give a divinatory
reading of the name, as such, without reference to
any particular person.
But such a divinatory reading is a delineation of
the name only, and should not be expected to reveal
much concerning the life of any particular John
Brown. Quite certain it is that of the thousands and
thousands of John Browns throughout the world,
their fortunes are markedly varied, and have no such
uniformity as would be necessary if all their lives
were to be represented by a single set of divinatory
symbols.
When we have the astrological birth-chart of an
individual we possess a positive map of his various
important vibratory rates and how they are related
to each other. When we have a name and find its
key we po11sess a map of the vibratory qualities of
that name. By comparing the two maps we can de-
termine with all the exactitude of positive science
how the name will influence the individual.
From the astrological birth-chart and the pro-
gressed aspects we can plot the invisible influences

operative in the life of the individual at any given
time, and thus have a positive way of mapping the
probable events and the time they will happen, in the
individual's life.
But when we do not have the birth-chart of the
individual by which to determine his various vibra-
tory rates, we have no positive method of determin-
ing how a name will affect him, and we possess no
positive method of determining either the events of
his life or the time they will happen.
But man is not dependent exclusively upon posi-
tive methods in the acquisition of knowledge. Rea-
son is positive, but often intuition, which is not
positive, yields information even more valuable. The
physical senses are positive, but the psychic senses,
under certain circumstances, are even more reliable.
And while the positive method of gaining informa-
tion by means of numbers is very valuable, it is not
the only method of using numbers to acquire knowl-
edge. Numbers may also be used as divinatory in-
struments. All systems of numerology are purely
mehods of divination; and the one now to be pre-
sented is no exception. But it is the best system we
have been able to find.
In order to have a constantly varying factor which
provides a proper basis. for the exercise of divina-
tion, it is customary to use the name of the individ-
ual, but to this name add another distinctive factor
which is unique to the individual. This distinctive
factor, which has come to be known as the number
232 The Sacred Tarot
of the Birth Path, is merely the number which is
obtained by adding crosswise the factors of the birth
date as commonly expressed numerically.
Thus the number of the Birth Path of Jan. 13,
J872, is 1 (January is 1st month) plus 1plus3 plus
1 plus 8 plus 7 plus. 2, which gives 23.
The number of the Birth Path of May 8, 1932, is
5 (May is the 5th month) plus 8 plus 1 plus 9 plus
3 plus 2, which gives 28.
The number of the Birth Path of July 4, 1776, is
7 (July is 7th month) plus 4 plus 1 plus 7 plus 7
plus 6, which gives 32.
The number of the Birth Path of December 7,
1941, is 1 plus 2 (December is 12th month) plus 7
plus 1 plus 9 plus 4 plus 1, which gives 25.
The number of the Birth Path of November 2,
1948, is 1 plus· 1 (November is 11th month) plus 2
plus 1 plus 9 plus 4 plus 8, which gives 26.
The Birth Path is really the birth date, and there-
fore it is true that the number of the Birth P ath does
belong specifically to the individual; for it is a num-
ber obtained from the record of his birth ; yet it must
not be lost sight of that using it thus is not a method
depending upon the vibratory influence of thought,
but is merely a divinatory method of using the Birth
Path, or date of birth, in a particular way.
Then having found the number of the Birth Path,
this number is added to the number of the name, the
sum giving a Divinatory N umber, which affords a
Reading Names in Detail 233
chart which should reveal to one whose intuitions
are active, the character, the chief events of the life
and the conditions surrounding the individual when
life ends.
To obtain this chart the Key of the Divinatory
Number is found and placed at the beginning of the
chart as signifying the chief influence in the char-
acter. The Major Arcanum corresponding to this
Key of the Divinatory Number is considered in the
nature of symbolically representing the birth-chart
of the person.
Then in the chart this is followed by a Major
Arcanum substituted for each letter of the name.
That is, each letter of the name, commencing with
the first, is considered as a separate influence in the
life. It is considered in the nature of an astrological
major progression. And the nature of the event
which it brings into the life is symbolized by the
Major Arcanum corresponding to the letter. The
first letter of the name thus represents the influence
in the life immediately following birth, the next
letter an influence somewhat later, the third letter a
period following this, and so on up to the end of
the name.
Then the Key of the Decave of the Divinatory
Number is found and placed at the end of the chart,
after the Major Arcanum representing the last let-
ter of the name. The Major Arcanum corresponding
to the Key of the Decave does not so much represent
a specific event, as the conditions which surround the
234 The Sacred Tarot
person at the close of life. That is, it represents in
a divinatory way, that which is signified by the fourth
house of a birth-chart.

The num~rical chart as given in the line above
shows that Abraham Lincoln's character was based
upon 14, or Temperance. A much more detailed
description of it can be had by substituting the
astrological correspondence, Taurus, which shows
clearly the deep sympathy and the intense practi-
cality of his nature.
Very early in life he began to develop himself
through the application of ·will in the expansion of
his Intelligence ( 1).
Readin,e; Names in Detail 235
Science (2) next comes under his scrutiny as a
child, and exerted its full influence in his life as he
ciphered on the back of a wooden shovel by the
firelight.
But there was an Awakening (20) also in his early
years, by which his thoughts were turned into higher
channels.
And some travel (Mercury influence) which gave
full material for his developing Intelligence ( 1).
This was followed by gaining for himself a rep-
utation for Justice ( 8) ; for he came 1'o be known as
honest Abe.
Then further application to study and the develop-
ment of his Intelligence ( 1) ; for he began to prepare
himself to practice law.
And a Transformation in his affairs due to taking
part in a military expedition (Aries) ( 13)
Then came the first great Sacrifice and sor-
row ( 12) of his life through the loss of his beloved
Ann Rutledge.
Followed by a Change of Fortune ( 10) as he ;was
thrust forward into the political arena.
In which capacity his fairness and Temperance
( 14) in handling the issues of the day;
Lent to him a Spiritual Force ( 11) which swept
him into the highest office in the land.
And brought to him the responsibility of that
great Catastrophe ( 16), the Civil War.
This was an Expiation ( 12) of the sin of human
slavery; and enabled him to set free these slaves at
the Sacrifice of his own and other lives.
236 The Sacred Tarot
Then the war was ended, and he embarked upon a
full program of Regeneration ( 14) for the country,
when his own end came.
And while this end came suddenly, and violently,
nevertheless, he had accomplished his work. The
surroundings of his life at its end (Key of the Decave
of the Divinatory Number) is well shown by 17.
Truth had prevailed, Faith had been vindicated, and
he left behind him a message of Hope that has con-
tinued unabated to this day.

Reading Names in Detail 237
cally a pioneer destined to bring about a Transfor-
mation by the use of the sword. A more detailed
reading of the character may be had from the sign
Aries.
His early life was spent in Action (3) rather than
in study.
Then the influence of Law and Religion(S)
played their part.
At an early age a commission as midshipman was
offered to him, but his mother blocked this, which
was a Catastrophe ( 16) to his ambitions.
The death of his brother brought him an inheri-
tance and an Awakening (20) to new responsibilities.
Then he married (3) Mrs. Curtis, and settled at
Mt. Vernon.
His life as a planter brought him into contact with
the Law (5) in that he was elected repeatedly to the
legislature of Virginia.
Then came a time of Trial and Temptation(6)
in regard to Governor Dunmore, in which his posi-
tion was always that of a radical.
His appointment to Congress in 1774 gave him
opportunity for the exercise of his Will, Intelligence
and Dexterity ( 1) for which later he became famous.
In this period, just prior to the Revolutionary
\Var, Deception ( 18), subterfuge, and secret enemies
were encountered on every hand.
And then, with the war, came a decided Change of
Fortune ( 10) .
238 The Sacred Tarot S
When named commander-in-chiet of the armed
forces of the United Colonies his Temperance ( 14)
caused him to refuse a salary, and to announce that
he .felt himself unfit for the command.
Then came the Action(3) of War.
But the stupidity, Foolishness(22) and impatience
of his supporters during 1775 almost wrecked the
enterprise. .
It was a Catastrophe ( 16) when Benedict Arnold
and his sympathizers turned against him.
But his persistence and Temperance ( 14) brought
him through, established his fame, and placed him
uncontested in the presidential chair.
From this position he later retired to his home at
Mt. Vernon, to find the rural life he enjoyed so
much, surrounded by his family and friends. Away
from the conflicts of political quarrels, with the high-
est honors his country could bestow, with wealth and
the affection of many, his closing years are well rep-
resented by the Key of the Decave of the Divinatory
Number ( 19), the number of Happiness.
I believe these two illustrations will quite suffice to
indicate the manner in which divination by numbers
can be used to give a detailed reading of a name.
The number representing the Key of the Divinatory
Number should always be taken to represent the
character. Then each letter of the name, in its
proper sequence, should be taken to represent a
period of the life, and the influence of this period
can be expanded by using the astrological corre-
spondence of the number.
Reading Names in Detail 239
There is no way, by this system, to know just how
long any period lasts. The duration of time is the
most difficult thing to determine by any method of
divination. The general rule here, however, is to
divide the total life-·-whether short or long-into as
many periods as there are letters in the name. Each
letter repre§ents one of these periods. If the life is
long, it represents a longer period than if the life
is short.
Then the Key of the Decave of the Divinatory
Number is taken to represent the condition at the
end of life, whether this end comes early or late.
And it must not be forgotten that in su'ch divina-
tion rigid interpretations are to be avoided. The
numbers in such a chart are to be used merely as
guides to the intuition; not to limit it. All impres-
sions and intuitions, therefore, should be expressed
freely, even when they somewhat contradict the rigid
interpretation of the numerical chart.
The Enchantress.-Arcanum XI. Letter: Egyp-
tian, Caitha; Hebiew, Caph; English, C-K. Num-
ber 11. Astrologically, the planet Neptune. Color,
changing i'ridescence. Tone, the music of the spheres.
Occult science, divination. Human function, thought-
transference. Natural remedy, spiritual healing.
Element, neptunium. ·
C-11, expresses in the spiritual world, the prin-
ciple of all force, spiritual and material.
In the intellectual world, moral force.
In the physical world, organic force.
240 The Sacred Tarot
Remember, then, son of earth, that for power one
must believe in one's ability. Advance with faith. To
become strong, impose silence upon the weakness of
the heart. If Arcanum XI should appear in the pro-
phetic signs of thy horoscope thou shouldst study
duty, which is the rule of right, and practice justice
as if you loved .it.
In Divination, Arcanum XI is Force, Spiritual
Power, or Fortitude.
Arcanum XI is figured by the image of a young
girl who opens and closes without effort, with her
hands, the jaws of an angry lion. The maiden wears
a crown surmounted by a vase and crowned eagles,
and at her brow the sacred serpent.
The vase is symbol of the affections, and the
crowned eagles represent force spiritualized. The
sacred serpent signifies that she acts in full knowl-
edge of her power, and not blindly. The lion sym-
bolizes force, also the animal desires in man which
are subdued by the spiritual nature.
The whole ensemble symbolizes the power over
violent forces of nature that faith in oneself and an
innocent life will give; also the spiritual power that
is the natural result of unsullied affections which
dominate and rule the animal instincts. It signifies
that purity is the touchstone, and that goodness
alone is power.
Number.-Numerically, 11 indicates the extreme
magnetic and feminine forces of nature. It exempli-
fies the doctrine that evil should not be resisted, but
be overcome with good. The finer forces of woman,
Reading Names in Detail 241
while not giving the physical strength of man, enable
her to govern him by appealing to him interiorly,
and thus she molds his efforts through his affectional
nature. She enters occultly into his life; and liberat-
ing the powers which lie latent in the structure of his
_ genius, enables him to realize the ideals she in her
love has formed of him;
As composed of 7 and 4, the number 11 symbol-
izes the power that is realized as a result ·of the
perfect union denoted by 7. As 9 and 2, it represents
Wisdom carried into the realms of Occult Science,
giving control of the magnetic currents of the astral
world. As 6 and 5, it signifies Temptation banished
through devotion to Religion. As 10 and 1, it de-
notes Fortune dominated by Will.
Astrology.-Neptune is the octave expression of
the planet Venus, signifying spiritual love as distinct
from the material love ruled by Venus. Neptune is
the planet of psychic manifestation, its prommence
in a birth-chart being an indication of psychic ability.
It exerts little power upon the physical world di-
rectly, but by its action upon the imagination of
people it becomes singularly potent. Its influence is
to spiritualize, and it usually is a prominent planet
in the birth-chart of all types of genius, denoting
that peculiar power so well expressed by Arcanum XI.
Human Function.-The p ecu1ia rly high-strung
and sensitive organism given by the planet Neptune
enables its nati ves to receive mental messages from
others. It is capable of great negativeness, giving it
capacity for reception, and is sensitive enough to
242 The Sacred Tarot
perceive the import of thought vibration. At the
same time it has an inward power by which it can
send potent thought-forms to do its will, or through
the faculty of imagination impress its messages upon
the minds of others. It is like the strings of a cello,
sensitive to impinging sounds and readily s.et vibrat-
ing by them, and at the same time powerful to cause
vibrations in other instruments. These qualities req-
uisite for thought-transference are ind i·cate d by
Arcanum XI.
Alchemy.-Arcanum XI represents the energy
liberated during the process of transmutation. "When
the metals join, and the heat of the reverberatory
furnace is applied, they flux and reduce to the first
matter before the alchemical transformation takes
place. And in this process heat, electricity, magne-
tism, and still finer forces are set free. These forces,
so generated, are not violent, and are so subtle that
they would go entirely unnoticed by the care.less.
Nevertheless, they are of great importance in the
alchemical process, and especially essential in the
completion of the Great Work.
Bible.-The most notable reference to the prin-
ciple pictured by Arcanum XI which occurs in the
Bible is the story of Samson. His strength lay in his
purity and his virility; for his mother was com-
manded while carrying him; Ju. 13 : 14; "She may
not eat anything that cometh of the vine, neither let
her drink wine nor strong drink, nor eat any unclean
thing."
Reading Names in Detail 243
Samson slew the lion of Arcanum XI with his
hands, and later took honey from its carcass; honey
being symbolically the nourishment the spiritual body
receives from that creative purity represented by the
highest work of the bee. In other wor.ds, Samson
overcame his animal nature; and the bees, or ci:e-
ative attributes, utilized his virile powers to build up
spiritual strength.
So long as Samson was pure his strength was
boundless, but when he fell into sin his strength de-
parted. Ju. 16 :5 ; "And the lords of the Philistines
came up unto her, and said unto her, Entice him, and
see wherein his great strength lieth, and by what
means we may prevail against him, that we may bind
him to afflict him, and we will give thee, every one
of us, ELEVEN hundred pieces of s_ilver."
The three times Samson was bound and easily
broke his bondage signifies that the power of purity
prevails in physical, astral and spiritual realms. Hair
is coincident with the age when sexual virility is
attained, and Samson having been unshaved since his
birth, indicates his natural ability, due to purity of
life, to use his virile forces in a constructive manner.
But Delilah was an harlot, and robbed him of his
purity, shaved him of his constructive powers, and
delivered him into the hands of his enemies, who put
out his eyes, or spiritual sight, and the spirit of the
Law departed from him.
Masonry.-The l\1asonic degree known as the
Heroine of Jerico is founded upon Arcanum XI. The
scarlet line let down by the heroine, and the red
244 The Sacred Tarot
handkerchief used in making the sign of the degree,
denote feminine power.
The story is that by means of this cord two spies
from Israel made their escape from their enemies in
Jerico. It is symbolic of woman's creative periods,
and signifies the spiritual escape from physical limi-
tations that the higher use of their creative powers
will bring to man and woman. They are here alluded
to as spies in a foreign land because the physical
plane which they occupy is a domain foreign to their
spiritual estate.
Magic.-ln magic, Arcanum XI corresponds to
thought-diffusion.
This process, sometimes used maliciously, and
sometimes used unconsciously, is a dominant factor
in our political life, and is the means by which the
so-many occult absurdities and religious imbecilities
are kept alive and gain a following.
Some strong, self-willed individual elects himself
leader, and formulates some doctrine-political, oc-
cult, religious, or what-not. This doctrine may, or
may not, contain much of truth; and it may be an
earnest conviction, or merely the means by which the
leader hop es to further his own unscrupulous
ambitions.
But in any case he attracts to himself other men-
talities less dominant than his own, who unite with
him in promulgating this doctrine. The combined
thought-force radiates the thought-form of the doc-
trine outward with much force, and it reaches and
dominates a number of receptive minds. These, in
Reading Names in Detail 245
turn, convinced the doctrine is true, even though they
have never subjected it to keen analysis, add their
thoughts to the thought-form group. And in this
manner, the dominant power of the thought-form
overpowering reason through emotional energy, a
chain is formed extending from the leader as the
positive pole, through various links, to the masses as
the negative pole.
Every additional person who accepts the doctrine
and becomes its proponent makes its power stronger.
As a snowball gains in size as it rolls down hill; so
the thought-power of such a group of thoughts gains
strength with each new adherent.
The viciousness of this thought-diffusion process is
that it works so subtly. It attacks the unconscious
minds of people quite unknown to themselves. The
vast thought-power gives an emotional trend to the
unconscious minds of the people it reaches, and this
emotional element is often sufficiently strong to over-
ride any tendency to use_reason or to bring to bear
the critical faculties.
Though-diffusion, minus the chain effect, is the
kind of power used by a high-pressure salesman to
sell a customer something for which the customer
has no earthly use. But as employed by statecraft
or by priestcraft, with the chain effect, it is used to
sell the populace whatever ideas those in authority
wish people to accept. And these ideas, all too often,
are those that support decaying theological dogmas,
those that keep people subservient to their exploiting
rulers, or which cause Occidental students to accept,
246 The Sacred Tarot
in spite of their logical absurdities, certain mystical
follies from the Orient as a part of the real Secret
Doctrine.
The real adept never utilizes such methods; and
the only image he radiates systematically is his own
ideal of himself in greater perfection than he has yet
attained; and this ideal he receives through reflec-
tion, from his mate. ·
Initiation.-·In the soul's initiation Arcanum XI
represents the spiritual and psychic powers that are
the outcome of the neophyte's occult training.
His training, as well as the general trend of his
life, has been to give greater refinement to his body,
his thoughts, and his feelings. And as this change,
denoted by Arcanum XI takes place, he becomes in-
creasingly more potent to use his spiritual and astral
powers; for the power of a force depends upon the
plane from which it emanates, and the finer the or-
ganism the finer the force which it is capable of
receiving and transmitting. ·
This refinement and training also increase the sen-
sitivity of the psychic senses, enabling him to register
and interpret vibrations quite outside the range of
perception of the less developed man.
As shown by Arcanum XI, the animal nature must
be entirely subdued; but it certainly must not be
killed. Man is dependent for energy upon the attri-
butes developed while in the lower kingdoms; but
these energies, to be spiritual, must be diverted from
animal expression into purely constructive channels.
Reading Names in Detail 247
Not the suppression of the animal nature is re~l
purity, but the use of all energy, sexual energy in-
cluded, in channels which are constructive and aid
others instead of merely benefiting self.
This Arcanum does not represent the repression,
or destruction of sex; for every energy in existence
is dependent for its potency upon polarity, or sex.
The power of an electric current depends upon the
difference in potential; that is, the difference between
the positive pole and the negative pole. And a man
or woman to be able to exert any real power must
be strongly sexed. The more feminine a woman is,
and the more masculine a man is, the more power
they possess. The mistake here must not be made,
however, of concluding that intellect and will are
strictly masculine qualities. Mercury is convertible,
and not the exclusive property of either sex. A
woman may be an intellectual genius and still be
strongly feminine, and a man may have strong ten-
der emotions and still be masculine. But to have
great power, as amply demonstrated by the outstand-
ing people of the world's history, the individual must
be strongly sexed.
Things have been accomplished by hermaphro-
dites; that is-, by those of dual sex; but an investiga-
tion of such accomplishment discloses that these
hermaphrodites were merely the mediumistic and
negative instruments through which some other
strongly sexed intelligence was able to manifest. The
lack of individuality, the lack of character, and the
lack of sex, alike give easy access to some dominant
force, and encourage the expression of a multiple
248 The Sacred Tarot
personality. But it hinders the development of in-
dividuality, makes for the disintegrative phases of
mediumship, and precludes real soul development.
Real power depends upon an energy controlled by
the individual, and this energy has great dependence
upon sex; but if it is a real power it must be pro-
jected from a high plane and only into constructive
channels.
Occult Science.-By divination the attention of
the unconscious mind is directed to obtaining infor-
mation which is not readily accessible to the objective
consciousness through external channels. The psychic
senses, thus directed ,- perceive the information
sought. This information then resides in the astral
brain like a memory. Then, through the divinatory
process, whatever it may be, this memory residing
now in the unconscious mind, is brought up into ob-
jective consciousness to be utilized in every-day
affairs.
King Court Cards.--Strictly spe.ak.ing the king,
queen and youth of each suit hav
e a numerical value
of 10 each; for they represent all of humanity, both
men and women, as born under the twelve zodiacal
signs.
Man alone, or woman alone, is represented by the
number 5 ; but each king not merely signifies a man
of given temperament, but also, when reversed, a
woman of that temperament, thus giving two Ss, or
10 for the whole card. Either the king, the queen,
or the youth, is numerically 10.
Reading Names in Detail 249
The kings represent the first degree of emanation
of each zodiacal triplicity; the queens represent the
reaction, or second degree of emanation of each
triplicity; and the youths or product of action and
reaction, represent the third degree of emanation of
each triplicity.
The horsemen, however, do not represent people,
but the thoughts of people. Thoughts are ruled by
Arcanum I; therefore, each horseman has a numeri-
cal value of 1.
The King of Scepters signifies a person ruled by
the sign Aries: fiery, headstrong, .ambitious, coura-
geous and energetic. Right way up it denotes an
Aries man; reversed it indicates an Aries woman.
The dominant idea is I AM.
The King of Swords signifies a person ruled by the
sign Taurus: reserved, sullen and practical. Right
way up it denotes a Taurus man; reversed it indi-
cates a Taurus woman. The dominant idea is I
HAVE.
The King of Coins signifies a person ruled by the
sign Gemini: intelligent, restless, volatile and fickle.
Right way up it denotes a Gemini man; reversed it
indicates a Gemini woman. The dominant idea is
I THINK.
The King of Cups signifies a person ruled by the
sign Cancer: mild, reserved, home-loving and pleas-
ant. Right way up it denotes a Cancer man; reversed
it indicates a Cancer woman. The dominant idea is
I FEEL.
250 The Sacred Tarot
The Martyr.-Arcanum XII. Letter: Egyptian,
Luzain; Hebrew, Lamed; English, L. Number, 12.
Astrologically, the zodiacal sign Pisces. Color, the
darker shades of purple. Tone, low A. Occult sci-
ence, natural alchemy. Human function, sensing the
spiritual aromas. Natural remedy, such ,herbs as
mosses which grow in the water, ferns and seaweed.
Mineral, the talismanic gem peridot; and such stones
as sand, gravel, pumice and coral.
L- 12 expresses in the spiritual world the re-
vealed law.
In the intellectual world, the precept of duty.
In the physical world, sacrifice.
Remember, then, son of earth, that sacrifice is a
divine law from which none is exempt; but expect
any ingratitude from men. Always hold thy soul in
readiness to render its account to the eternal. If
Arcanum XII should appear in the prophetic signs
of thy horoscope, a violent death will spread its
snares upon the way. But if the world attempts thy
earthly life do not die without accepting with resig-
nation this decree of God, and pardon thy cruelest
enemies; for whosoever does not forgive here below
will be conde.mned in the next life to eternal solitude.
In Divination, Arcanum XII may be read as Sac-
rifice or Expiation.
Arcanum XII is figured by a man suspended by
one foot from a gallows which is supported by two
trees, each having six cut branches. His hands are
tied together, forming a down-pointing triangle,
above which one leg crosses the other in the form of
a cross. From the hands gold pieces drop to the earth.
Reading Names in Detail 251
It is the sign of a violent death, coming unexpect-
edly by accident, or in the expiation of a crime, or
accepted voluntarily through heroic .devotion to
truth and justice. ·
The twelve cut branches indicate the destruction
of the twelve houses of the horoscope, signifying the
extinction of life.
The cross above the triangle, a symbol the reverse
of that on Arcanum IV, indicates that material forces
have gained the ascendency and subdued the mind.
The coins dropping upon the earth signify wasted
effort and the ebbing of the life forces. They also
indicate that the efforts of the martyr who loses his
life in furthering truth and justice are never lost, but
remain on earth after he has passed. Ideals as yet
unrealized persist in the astral about the earth until
they contact some other person through whom they
find suitable and more complete expression:
Number.-Numerically, 12 being the second
decave of 3, may be represented by Arcanum III
expressing on the vibratory level indicated by Ar-
canum II. That is, union expressing on the negative
pl~ne, the result of which is depicted by Arcanum XII.
But it also has another aspect; for union may also
be on the plane of science, as denoted by Arcanum
IL And thus considered, Arcanum XII indicates
that the science of union rests upon sacrifice and
devotion; for selfishness is the antithesis of higher
union. This thought, however, is perhaps better ex-
pressed by adding 3 and 9 to indicate union guided
by wisdom; while the adverse significance is more
252 The Sacred Tarot
completely denoted by 6 plus 6, indicating trials
upon trials. The 8 plus 4 aspect is better; for it
reads, justice realized.
Astrology.-As the sign Pisces is the last sign of
the zodiac, and rules the house of self-undoing, of
expiation and crime, as well as sacrifice and dis-
appointment, the astrological correspondence with
Arcanum XII is obvious.
Human Function.-As a symbol of religious de-
votion, or for the expiation of sin, it was anciently
the custom to offer a sacrifice unto the Lord, or uni-
versal law. This taking of life and offering it upon
the altar of expiation was to be a sweet savor unto
the Lord. But its higher import was the implication
of the sacrifice of the animal part of one's nature
upon the altar of devotion to cosmic welfare, and
that such sacrifice, through the aspirations which
prompt it, nourishes the spiritual nature. SuC'h ex-
alted emotions, in addition to building a spiritual
body, cause radiations to emanate from a man simi-
lar to those spiritual aromas which can alone be
apprehended by the psychic senses.
Alchemy.-Because life is short and the proc-
esses of the alchemical art take time, the variety of
the ingredients which enter into transmutation be-
comes limited". Some such ingredients, therefore,
which, had we more time, might be used successfully
must be Sacrificed to the need of other ingredients.
Thus are we compelled to exercise choice in their
selection. This clloice should be made only after
careful analysis has revealed the quality of each, the
effort at all times being made to retain that which
Reading Names in Detail 253
already is far advanced and truly useful. When such
a choosing becomes imperative the grosser metal
must be Sacrificed that we may re.fain the more
refined.
Bible.-Arcanum XII pictures Judas after he re-
pented. Math. 27 :5; "And he cast down the pieces
0f silver in the temple, and he went and hanged
himself." ·
It also symbolizes the fig tree that was cursed
for not being fruitful. Mark 11 :20; "And in the
morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig tree
dried up from the roots."
The other aspect of this symbol is that of voltm-
tary sacrifice instead of expiation; This is exempli-
fied in the persecution and violent death of the
apostles, and also in the conversion of the rich publi-
can, Zacchaeus. In mythology it is Prometheus un-
dergoing perpetual torment ·for his immortal theft
of the divine fire from heaven with which to benefit
humanity.
Masonry.-Arcanum XII is represented by the
ritual in the Christian Mark degree where the Grand
Ministers execute the Judgment of the Lord and the
candidate bewails his fate because his lips are un-
clean. Before conferring the mark, in some obedi-
ences, a live coal is taken from the altar and pressed
to the candidate's lips to signify expiation.
Magic.-Arcanum XII symbolizes the certain fate
that ever follows those who use magical powers
without discrimination. The cross above the triangle
signifies that the magician has become the servant of
254 The Sacred Tarot
the very elemental forces he sought to master. The
practice of magic, unless with wisdom and unselfish-
ness, inevitably leads to tragedy. And those who at-
tempt to use sex in magic to attain selfish power
merely fasten upon themselves evil elementaries that
often force them to follow the example of Judas
Iscariot and commit suicide in their attempt to get
free from them.
The benefic side of the arcanum is this exposition
uf magical law: "Give all thou hast of breath, of
power, or life, in just duty and lawful motive; expire
honestly the corrupted or contaminated matter; and
you shall instantly be fil(ed with the celestial fire and
become refined." ·
Initiation.-Arcanum XII indicates the neophyte's
absolute devotion to the cause of truth and prog-
ress. It exemplifies the summons of the N az,~rene:
"Go thy way, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give
to the poor, and thou shalt have treasures in heaven;
and come, take up thy cross, and follow me." Hence-
forth the struggling soul takes no thought what it
shall gain personally by its efforts, but devotes its
energy to assisting in the progressive evolution of
creation; sacrificing life itself if necessary in the cause
of truth and 1ustice.
Occult Science.-N atural alchemy embraces those
processes which take place slowly in nature, but
which man can hasten and utilize for himself if he
possesses sufficient knowledge. To this end, there-
fore, he studies all the transformations that have
taken place in the world-; physical biological, mental
Reading Names in Detail 255
and religious, that he rnay perceive just what nature
has thus accomplished. Having arrived at a compre-
hensive knowledge thus of relations of things to
each other and to himself, he utilizes this informa-
tion to bring those transmutations to pass which, in
this new wisdom, he now most desires.
The Horoscope Spread.-The frontispiece of Les-
son No. 25 illustrates the principle that four signs
always express the absolute and are explained by the
fifth. The diagram, page 3'4 of Lesson No. 22 shows
how the five must move in a medium expressed by
four signs, thus completing the number of deific
manifestation, 9. But when we consider man, we
find him the medium through which stellar forces
act. So considered, the signs reverse and he is repre-
sented by cells 2, 4, 6, 8, and 9 in the diagram of
Lesson No. 22.
Furthermore, we know that everything possessing
life is a trinity of positive, negative, and union, so
that each of the active cells, 7, 1, 3, 5, shown in
Lesson No. 22 expands into a trine as indicated by
the diagram at the front of this booklet. These are
the twelve houses of life constituting a horoscope.
To use the diagram as a tarot spread the cards
are dealt one by one upon the houses of the horo-
scope in the order indicated by the numbers in the
diagram. The reading is·used to foretell the near
future of every department of life of the one making
the consultation. The card falling upon any house of
the chart will reveal the fortune of those things
ruled by that house astrologically. The cards should
256 The Sacred Tarot
be turned over only as read.
Trine 1-6-11 is the trine of life. 1 relates to
personal things and health. 6 is the life of the mind,
governing philosophy, publishing, and travel. 11 is
the life of posterity, ruling children, love affairs,
pleasures, and speculation.
Trine 2-7-12 is the trine of. .power. . 2.is .the
power to attract honor and authority, ruling busi-
ness, credit, and reputation. 7 is the power given .by
environment, governi~g sickness, se.rvants, and labor.
12 is the power of wealth, ruling cash and personal
property.
Trine 3-8-
. 9 is the social trme. 3 is the society
of partners, and rules the husband or wife, open
enemies, and law suits. 8 is the society of kindred
and thoughts, governing brethren, studies, writing,
and short journeys. 9 is the society of associates,
ruling friends and hopes.
Trine 4-10-5 is the trine of ~oncealed things.
4 is the. environment more or less concealed, ruling
the home, real estate, and the .end of .life. 10 is the
concealed things of death and fatality, ruling lega-
cies and the partner's money. 5 is the concealed
affiictions, governing disappointments, restrictions,
and secret enemies.
A good card falling on any house signifies good
luck in that department of life, and an evil card on a
house signifies evil luck will come from the things it
rules, the nature being shown by the card.
"Everything that has been, is, or will be, has its
foundation and is built up, in four trines."

ARACELSUS, one of the greatest physi-
cians, and one of the most learned of
occult students, several hundred years ago
set forth the principle upon which depends
the influence of a name, a number, a color,
a musical tone, a locality, or other invisible vibra-
tory rate.
He said: "If I have manna in my constitution I
can attract manna from heaven. Saturn is not only
in the sky, hut also deep in the ocean and earth.
What is Venus-hut the artemisia that grows in your
garden, and what is iron but the planet Mars? That
is to say, Venus and artemisia are both products of
the same essence, while Mars and iron are manifes-
tations of the same cause."
What you have in your constitution is mapped by
your birth-chart. If you have the dynamic stellar
structure in your astral body mapped by the position
of the planet Mars powerful, you will, of necessity,
attract events into your life of the nature of Mars;
events of violence, either constructive or destructive
in character. If you do not ·have much iron, or
Mars, in your constitution, as shown by Mars occu-
pying a weak house and having almost no aspects,
you will not have aggressiveness nor much courage,
and you will not attract violent events.
And what has been said of the Mars structure is
also true of the other nine thought structures mapped

The Color of a Name 263
by the various planets, and of the twelve zones of
the astral body mapped by the zodiacal signs. If
the section of your astral form mapped by a particu-
lar zodiacal sign is shown to have much activity, as
indicated by planets in the sign having many astro-
dynes, or by the ruler of the sign having many astro-
dynes, the department of life indicated by the house
position of that zodiacal sign will come into unusual
prominence all through your life. And thus it is that
the type of events attracted to the individual depends
exclusively upon the activity of the thought-cells
within himself that-have the same vibratory rates as
these events. If the money structures and money
zone of the astral body have considerable activity,
money will enter the life as of considerable impor-
tance; but if the money structures and zone are weak,
there will be neither large gains nor large losses, and
money will not be as important a factor as some other
of life's activities. If the structures and zone ruling
marriage are unusually active, this phase of the life
may dominate in importance all th¢ other matters
entering the life; but if they are passh~e, this depart-
ment of life may prove of negligible importance.
Now any of these structures or zones mapped in
the birth-chart can be given additional energy, and
thus made more active than it normally is1 through
associating with things or thoughts of a similar vibra-
tion. Whether we will or no, some of them are thus
given additional activity through the progressed posi-
tions of the planets.
There are three sources of invisible energies that
have the power to stimulate the thought structures
264 The Sacred Tarot
and thought-cells of our astral body into exceptional
activity: astrological influences, the influence of
thoughts, and the influence of objects. And when a
planet by progression reaches a zone of the astral
body, it gives its thought-cells new activity, and this
attracts events corresponding to the department of
life ruled by the zone into the life. In particular,
when a planet by progression also forms an aspect
to a dynamic thought structure in the astral body
mapped by a planet in the' hirth-chart, the additional
energy thus gained by the thought-cells enables them
to attract some pronounced event into the life. And
thus, from such progressed positions of the planets,
and the dates when they make aspects with struc-
tures in the astral form, the astrologer is able to
predict what events will transpire and when they
will come to pass.
But progressed planets are not the only source of
such additional energy that may he made available
to thought structures and zones within the astral
form. Both thoughts and objects have a similar
power, though varying in the amount of energy
contributed. In Course IX I have considered the
deliberate use of certain types of thought, and in this
course considerable attention has been paid to the
use of abstract thoughts, such as names and num-
bers. And right here I wish to indicate how the char-
acter vibrations of colors may be employed in a
similar manner.
Sound is caused by vibrations ranging from the
4th to the 12th octave of vibration, or from 16 to
32,768 vibrations per second.
The Color of a Name 265
Vibrations either slower or faster than these must
be apprehended by other means than the ear. Elec-
tricity, for instance, which is not perceptible to either
eye or ear, includes the 25th to the 35th octave, or
from 33,354,432 to 34,359,738,368 vibrations per
second.
Radiant heat, such as that coming to us from the
sun, ranges from the 46th to the 48th octave, or
from 70,368,744,644 to 281,474,976,710,656 vibra-
tions per second.
The effect of these vibratory rates, as producing
physical changes in our organism, is readily appar-
ent. But there are other vibrations which have quite
as pronounced an effect in producing physical results
that are less easily discerned in their action. Thus,
the chemical ray, used in photography and producing
sunburn when we stroll the beach in scanty attire,
belongs to the 50th octave of vibrations; and the
X-ray, which without sensation burns tissue within
the human body, belongs to the vibratory rates
within the 59th to 61st octave.
Within the range of the 49th octave of vibration,
around 562,949,853,421,312 vibrations per second,
the rates of motion are perceived by the eye as light.
This white light when refracted divides itself into
vibratory rates slightly faster and slightly slower
than the average, and these different rates give rise
to the seven colors of the solar spectrum.
These seven colors, as ascertained by the effects
they produce when associated with, each tend to
stimulate, or add energy to, the structure within the
266 The Sacred Tarot
astral form mapped by one of the planets of the
septenary. And the various shades of these colors,
produced by slightly higher or lower vibrations than
the type color, are found to add activity to the zone
of the astral body ruled by a zodiacal sign. _Thus
any color, or combination of colors, has an effect
upon the astral body which can be determined from
the correspondence of the color, or combination, to
the zones and structures mapped in the birth-chart.
These color correspondences, from which the struc-
ture or zone of the astral body stimulated can be
ascertained, are given in the treatment of each major
arcanum, and also in the table at the front of Lesson
No. 48.
Now as each letter, and each number below 23,
has the same astral vibratory rate as the astral vibra-
tory rate of some color, or its shade (the astral
vibratory rate of a color must not be confused with
the electromagnetic vibratory rate which affects the
sense of sight), it is easy to find the color corre-
spondence of any number or any name by first find-
ing the vibratory key of the number or name, and
then discerning to which color this key corresponds.
In applying such correspondences it will be noted
that the night signs of a planet correspond to the
darker shades of the color ruled by the planet, and
the day signs of a planet correspond to the light
shades of the same type color.
Thus to find the color of the name, "Teddy":
T-22, E-5, D-4, D-4, Y-10 added gives the number
45. 4 plus 5 gives 9 as the Key of the number, and
The Color of a Name 267
by referring to Arcanum IX we find the color 'of this
key to be light blue.
· To find the color number 1918 we add 1 plus 9
plus 1 plus 8, which gives 19 as the Key to which it
vibrates, and referring to Arcanum XIX we find the
color to be light orange.
Thus by associating with the name Teddy there is
the same kind of influence, but probably of different
intensity, as that obtained by associating with the
color light blue, such as wearing a light blue dress, or
even a light blue necktie.
But the most important factor is yet to be men-
tioned. For while the type of event attracted is
determined by the structure or zone of the astral
form to which energy is thus added; whether the
event will be favorable or unfavorable must be de-
termined by how that structure is organized as
shown in the birth·chart.
If the structure or zone as mapped in the birth-
chart is shown to be decidedly discordant, adding
energy to it (except as a mental antidote as ex-
plained in Course IX) gives it additional power to
attract misfortune. Therefore, by names, by num-
bers, by colors, or by other means, pains should be
taken not to associate with those astral vibrations
that have the same rate as discordant conditions
mapped in the birth-chart. Instead, those should be
associated with which will add energy in large vol-
ume and intensity to such structures and zones of
the astral body as the birth-map shows to be espe-
cially harmonious: Thus will more favorable con-
ditions be attracted from without.
268 The Sacred Tarot
The Reapel'.-Arcanum XIII. Letter: Egyptian,
Mataloth; Hebrew, Mem; English, M. Number,
13. Astrologically, the zodiacal sign Aries. Color,
the lighter shades of red. Tone, high C. Occult
science, mundane astrology. Human function, the
sense of taste. Natural remedy, such herbs as hemp,
mustard, broom, holly, dock, thistle, fern, garlic,
onions, nettles, radishes, poppies, peppers and rhu-
barb. Mineral, the talismanic gem, amethyst, and
such stones as ochre, brimstone and red stones of
various kinds.
M-13 expresses in the spiritual world, the per-
petual movement of creation; destruction and re-
newal.
In the intellectual world, the ascension of the spirit
into divine spheres.
In the physical world, natural death; that is to
say, the transition through which the soul leaves its
physical for,-n henceforth to function in an astral
form in the astral world.
Remember, then, son of earth, that terrestrial
things are of short duration and that the highest
powers are reaped as the grass of the field. If
Arcanum XIII should appear in the prophetic signs
of thy horoscope, the dissolution of thy organs will
come sooner than thou expectest. But do not dread
it; for death is but the parturition of another life.
The universe reabsorbs without ceasing all which
springs from her bosom that has not spiritualized
itself. But the releasing of ourselves from material
instincts by a free and voluntary adhesion of our
The Color of a Name 269
souls to the laws of universal movement constitutes
in us the creation of a second man, a celestial man,
and begins our immortality.
In Divination, Arcanum XIII may be read as
Death or Transformation.
Arcanum XIII is figured by a skeleton reaping
human heads, hands and feet. On the blade of the
scythe wielded by Time is a serpent and a scarabeus,
and back of all is seen a rainbow.
The progression of the scythe in its work is the
emblem of the perpetual destruction and rebirth of
all forms of being in the domain of time.
The serpent on the scythe represents the virile
energy that has carried the soul, symbolized by the
scarab, in its pilgrimage of births and deaths through
the mineral kingdom, the vegetable kingdom and the
animal kingdom up to the estate of man.
The skeleton mowing human heads, hands and
feet signifies that the thoughts, works and under-
standing of man eventually pass from the earth. But
the rainbow promises a new life of thought, effort
and knowledge in a superior realm.
Number.-Numerically, 13 is the 2nd decave of
4, indicating Arcanum IV, or realization, operating
on the negative plane of frequency of Arcanum II.
It is what is Realized from the efforts of life when
Polarizing forces disintegrate the physical body.
What this new plane of realization, to which the
efforts have now been transferred, will offer, de-
pends entirely upon how the energies have been used
on the plane left behind. If this use can be repre-
270 The Sacred Tarot
sented by 9 and 4, the Realization o1f Wisdom, self-
conscious progression gains momentum. But if the
transition is only 10 and 3, Chang,_e of Action, 5 and
8, the operation of the Law of justice, or even of
6 and 7, Victory over Temptation, the activities of
life are merely transferred, without: much gain or
loss, t.o the inner plane.
Such transition is possible, howeve:r, as 1 and 12,
Will directed to the Sacrifice of all selfishness, or as
2 and 11, under the Science of Spiritual Power. And
when such is the case, the new life witnesses a great
gain in freedom, in consciousness, in ability, and in
enjoyment.
Astrology.-Aries is the beginnin!t of the zodiac,
where the circle is completed and the cycle of one
life ends in the start of another. When the Sun
crosses the first point of Aries the astronomical year
commences, and when it again crosses into Aries,
that year is ended, cut off, destroyed. And thus is
Aries. as indicated bv Arcanum XIII, Brahma as well
as Siva, both creator and destroyer.
Human Function.-Life subsists upon life. The
energy and substance of each physical organism is
largely gained through the Death of others. To sus-
tain the life of man there is a constant sacrifice of
the lives either of plants or of animals. This life of
the lower kingdoms, when taken into the body of
man undergoes a Transformation lby which it is
made available for his use.
The cosmos depends upon the innumerable con-
scious entities embraced in it for 1expression and
The Color of a Name 271
progression. And likewise man depends upon the
innumerable cells of his body for expression upon
the physical plane. Each of these cells is as inde-
pendent of man as man is independent of the earth
on which he lives. That is, each cell has its own
individual consciousness, nor do the sum total of the
cells comprise the man; for the man has a conscious-
ness independent of these cells. Yet while these cells
are a portion of man's anatomy they should each
obey the dictates of man, just as man should obey
the mandates of the Supreme Intelligence.
Even as man is undergoing a progressive cycle on
the earth, so each cell in his body is undergoing its
progressive cycle in association with him. Therefore,
while the Death of the organism that serves as food
liberates the soul that has polarized the protoplasm
and energy contained in the form, this transition to
the body of man is not without compensation to the
life of the individual cells. For their substance and
energy is now Transformed into cells occupying the
body of man, and thus in association with an intelli-
gence which affords them greater opportunity by far
for evolutionary progress.
To the cell-life, at least, the serving as food for a
higher form of life than that previously occupied is
not without its advantages. And the human function
by which man selects what shall thus be Transformed
to his own use is the sense of taste, which corre-
sponds to Arcanum XIII.
Alchemy.-Arcanum XIII represents that Trans-
formation which occurs in the substance and form
272 The Sacred Tarot
due to transmutation. The fluxing of polar opposites
or natural antidotes produces not merely a blend of
the substances, but the Death of the old properties
in the production of a new and more highly refined
substa~ce with entirely different properties. There is
thus a Transformation of both the substance and
the form.
Bible.-As related in the 49th chapter of Genesis,
Jacob, being about to die, called together his sons,
who are the fathers of the 12 tribes of Israel. To
each he gives his blessing, together with a prophecy;
and this death-bed pronouncement reveals without
error to any competent astrologer just which tribe is
ruled by each zodiacal sign.
It should be evident, for instance, that when he
speaks of Reuben being as unstable as water, that
he refers, to the Waterbearer, Aquarius, and the
abrupt changes made by those in whose chart
Uranus, its ruler, is prominent. Likewise, when he
speaks of Simon and Levi as being brethren, he can
be referring to no other sign than the Twins, Gemini.
That Judah is a lion's whelp must mean Leo, the
Lion; and when he says that Zebulon shall dwe~l at
the haven of the sea, he certainly refers to the home
of the Crab, Cancer. Isaachar mentioned as a strong
ass, is the sign Taurus; because Taurus rules donkeys
as well as the Bull. And because justice is weighed
in the scales of Libra, Dan, who shall judge his peo-
ple, must belong to this sign.
Speaking of Gad, he says that a troup shall over-
come him, but he will overcome at the last; because
The Color of a Name 273
Scorpio has a multitude of desires, but has the power
to divert them to a high purpose as symbolized by
the Eagle, which also is a token of this sign.
That Asher shall yield royal dainties and his
bread shall be fat, of course, indicates the food sign,
Virgo; and Naphtali being a hind, or deer, or Goat,
signifies Capricorn. So, too, when we read that in
Joseph's bow abode his strength, we look for a bow
among the signs, and find the Archer, Sagittarius.
Now Aries has a constructive and a destructive, or
warlike, aspect; the latter being signified by the wolf,
as when there is a wolf in sheep's clothing. So
when we learn that Benjamin shall rave as a wolf,
we know he belongs to Aries. And then when we
come to Ephraim and Manassah, we find that
Ephraim, who was the younger, was blessed first,
contrary to customary usage, and that Manassah,
who was older, was blessed later, thus indicating
that at the end, or last sign, the dual sign Pisces, that
the last shall be first and the first shall be last. This
not merely signifies the sign of disappointments, but
also indicates that the priesthood, who belong to this
sign of Universal Brotherhood, should be willing,
when necessary, to renounce worldly advantages for
the good of mankind.
At the death of Jacob the twelve signs were thus
represented, and Jacob himself, ·after delivering his
blessings, was straightway gathered to his fathers, a
Transformation such as is represented by Arcanum
XIII.
The twelve disciples who were called by Jesus also
274 The Sacred Tarot
represent the 12 zodiacal signs ; Jesus making the
13th member, the lamb of God, or transitional influ-
ence of Aries.
He said on that occasion, Math. 26 :23 ; "He that
dippeth his hand with me in the dish, the same shall
betray me." .
Now of the four zodiacal quadrants the Scorpio,
or Eagle, is represented by the suit of cups. Jesus is
crucified on the autumnal cross of Libra, and was
betrayed for 30 pieces of silver. And from the point
where the sun is slain on the cross of Libra, the
nights, or powers of darkness prevailing over the
days, to the sign Scorpio, is just 30 degrees. Judas,
therefore, is the sign of death, Scorpio, the realiza-
tion of material forces, indicated by Arcanum IV,
who betrays the sun into the winter signs; delivers
the spiritual influence into the power of matter.
Judas later repents and hangs himself, as shown
by Arcanum XII. This, however, hut depicts the
expiation of the sin; for Judas himself belongs essen-
tially to Scorpio and not to Pisces.
The bread of the Lord's supper is the symbol of
the physical nourishment that sustains the material
body. The wine is token of the emotional nourish-
ment which alone builds up the spiritual body and
makes immortality possible. Man requires both
forms of sustenance.
Because thirteen were gathered at the Lord's·sup-
per, and one passed on, even today some persons
will not sit at a table where thirteen are present. To
some it is an omen that one of them shortly will die.
The Color of a Name 275
But 13 is not merely the symbol of death and dis-
solution. It is the number of the vernal cross, of
spring-time, of the sign Aries in which the sun com-
mences a new cycle of life. It is thus also the promise
of immortality; for the Sun-God then arises from
the tomb of winter. So while 13 means physical
death to the vulgar, to the initiate it signifies more
frequently the Death of Selfishness and Crystalliza-
tion through the Sacrifice and Devotion signified by
Arcanum XII; and the commencement of a new life
through the Transformation of material desires into
spiritual aspirations.
Masonry.-ln modern Masonry there are some-
thing like six degrees of the <:;ross, all dealing with
some aspect of Arcanum XIII. But because in the
zodiac there are two crosses, the vernal cross of
Aries and the autumnal cross of Libra, these degrees
of the cross have reference to both of them.
The Christian cross of crucifixion is Arcanum III,
astrologically Libra. But there is also a militant
cross of resurrection, Arcanum XIII', or Aries, sym-
bolized by a sword, which in form is but an inverted
cross, even as Libra and Aries are polar opposites in
the zodiac.
The meaning of these degrees of the cross is that
man is born upon the earth through generation, or
Arcanum III, and is born into the next life through
physical death; yet his real birth into a spiritual life
is brought about through the Transformation of his
animal tendencies into those that have for their chief
object the welfare of the whole of cosmic society.
276 The Sacred Tarot
Magic.-In magic, Arcanum XIII represents the
ability to separate the astral body from the physical
at will and use it as a vehicle to visit other parts of
the earth, to visit the homes of the dead, or to ex-
plore the tremendous regions of space. It is that
process which is referred to in Masonry as "travel-
ling in foreign countries."
Various methods are employed to bring about this
separation of the astral body from the physical with-
out a break in consciousness. One of the safest ways
is to go out during sleep, passing out through the
pineal gland, retaining the consciousness by a real-
ization all the while that one is dreaming, and hold-
ing to the recognition of things seen as a true astral
experience. Full details of this method are set forth
in the 11th Award MS.
Others quite successfully bring about this condi-
tion by gradually incapacitating the physical body
and voluntarily slowing down the heart action. While
lying in a relaxed state, and after thus slowing down
the heart action, they induce a tremendous desire to
move to some particular spot; and this, under such
training, takes them out of the physical and permits
them to maintain consciousness while moving about
in the astral form.
Orientals commonly use mantrams, rhythmic
breathing and a spiral swaying motion of the body
to loosen the astral from the physical. The astral
body by means of this method passes upward out the
top of the head.
Mediums also leave the physical body during
The Color of a Name 277
trance, and may bring back accounts of what has
been seen on such journeys. But this method, be-
cause it is done under the influence of some control-
ling entity, is disintegrative and highly dangerous.
Such experiments are not to be undertaken lightly;
and considerable precaution should be taken to pro-
tect the physical body from shock; as the too sudden
awakening, or bringing back to the physical, is a
great jolt to the nervous system, and might be s·o
great as to sever the astral cord binding the finer to
the grosser body, and thus result in death. Also
some precaution should be taken that in case there
is difficulty getting back into the physical that rela-
tives do not conclude hastily that death has ensued
and cause an untimely burial.
Initiation.-The soul has its birth into the next
life, just as it has its birth into this one. This new
birth does not always coincide with the moment of
physical death, for there is commonly a short or
longer period of unconsciousness in transition.
If one is too strongly attached to the things of
earth, and unable to relinquish the strong desires
for them, he may be bound, for a time, close to the
earth, and not awaken into the consciousness of the
new life. Or one may have become so dominated by
some idea that one lives in the image of this idea and
for a time shuts out the reality by which he is sur-
rounded. That is, until something or someone
awakens him to a realization of his true condition,
he may live in an imaginary world of his own
thought-creation.
278 The Sacred Tarot
But whether one passes through the doorway to
astral existence quickly or slowly, ultimately the time
arrives when he awakens into full consciousness of
his surroundings. This is the moment of his birth
into the next life, and it coincides with his new astro-
logical birth-chart.
Then comes the period of judgment, in which he
is both judge and the one on trial. He perceives the
actions of his life and the motives which prompted
them. He finds, perhaps, that his progress now de-
pends first upon rectifying certain mistakes made
while on earth. And this he does either through con-
tact again with those he injured, or at least through
rendering some constructive service to others.
After a period of adjustment to next-life condi-
tions he gravitates, or levitates, to the particular
plane which corresponds to his own dominant vibra-
tory rate. And on the plane where he now finds
himself, whether high or low, depending upon his
spirituality, he moves into the environment which
corresponds to the harmonies a·nd discords within his
finer form.
But whether high or low, there is always oppor-
tunity for progress. There are works to be per-
formed, joys to be experienced, and an even greater
variety of ipteresting events than is possible on earth.
But in this new realm money has no value. There is
but one currency which is legal tender, and his prog-
ress and any assistance rendered him by others de-
pends upon it. This currency of the next life is
constructive service such as in some manner brings
benefit fo others.
The Color of a Name 279
Occult Science.-The events which happen to
nations, to cities, ·to communities, and to the world
in general are chiefly shown astrologically in Cycle
charts. These charts, by which the events that thus
affect groups of people are predicted and explained,
are chiefly those erected for the moment some planet
has circled the zodiac and crossed from south to
north declination.
The point of the zodiac where the sun thus crosses
from south to north declination is always the first
point of Aries, and thus the first point of Aries be-
comes the accepted symbol for the commencement
of a new cycle. And as Mundane Astrology largely
depends upon such cycles, it corresponds to Arcanum
XIII, which pictures the sign Aries.
Queen Court Cards.-The Queen of Scepters
signifies a person ruled by the sign Leo: haughty,
high spirited, ambitious and resolute. Right way up
it denotes a Leo woman; reversed it indicates a Leo
man. The dominant idea is I WILL.
The Queen of Swords signifies a person ruled by
the sign Virgo: studious, rather even tempered, in-
genious and witty. Right way up it denotes a Virgo
woman; reversed it indicates a Virgo man. The
· dominant idea is I ANALYZE.
The Queen of Coins signifies a person ruled by
the sign Libra ; good, high minded, noble and ami-
able. Right way up it denotes a Libra woman; re-
versed it indicates a Libra man. The dominant idea
is I BALANCE.
The Queen of Cups signifies a person ruled by the
sign Scorpio: active, selfish, proud, resentful, re-
280 The Sacred Tarot
served and thoughtful. Right way up it denotes a
Scorpio woman; reversed it indicates a Scorpio man.
The dominant idea is I DESIRE.
The Alchemist.-Arcanum XIV. Letter: Egyp-
tian, Nain; Hebrew, Nun; English, N. Number, 14.
Astrologically, the zodiacal sign Taurus. Color, the
darker shades of yellow. Tone, low E. Occult
Science, Practical Occultism Applied to Daily Life.
Human function, psychometry. Natural remedy,
such herbs as daisies, dandelion, myrtle, gourds, flax,
lilies, larkspur, spinach and moss. Mineral, the talis-
manic gem, moss agate; such stones as alabaster,
white opaque stones and white coral.
N-14 expresses in the spiritual world, the per-
petual movement of life.
In the intellectual world, the combination of ideas
which create the moral life.
In the physical world, the combination of the
forces of nature.
Remember, then, son of earth, to conserve thy
forces, not to recoil at thy works, but in order to
wear out obstacles, as water, falling drop by drop,
wears away the hardest stone. If Arcanum XIV
should appear in the prophetic signs of thy horo-
scope, a well formulated plan of action followed
perseveringly will raise thee by degrees to the heights
thou wouldst attain.
In Divination, Arcanum XIV is Regeneration or
Temperance.
Arcanum XIV is figured by the genie of the sun
holding a golden urn and a silver urn, and pouring
from one to the other the conducting fluid of life.
The Color of a Name 281
The genie is crowned with flame to indicate that it
is a spirit; and its feet are winged to signify its rapid
movements. The fluid transferred from one urn to
another is the symbol of transmutation; and the
eight rays of the sun which show behind the genie's
head signify that the positive, or masculine, forces
of the universe are exactly equilibrated by the nega-
tive, or feminine, forces. The cloak over the shoul-
der of the spirit indicates the perpetual fecundation
of matter, as symbolized by the cloak, by spirit.
This ensemble pictures the combination and inter-
change of masculine and feminine forces throughout
nature, working ceaselessly ·in all kingdoms, as the
instigators and cause of all movements and life.
Number.-Numerically, 14 is the second decave
of 5, and thus represents the Law, Arcanum V,
operating upon the next interior plane as signified by
Arcanum II. As 5 is the dominion of man's intelli-
gence over the physical plane, so 14 must be the
dominion of man's intelHgence over the astral plane.
Now 7 signifies the perfect nuptial union on the
physical plane, the union of body, soul and spirit
with body, soul and spirit. Therefore, the double 7,
or 14, must signify the perfect union on the inner
plane, the perfect regenerate union, in which the
finer forces, as shown in Arcanum XIV, completely
blend and fuse. And herein lies the secret of rejuve-
nation; for, in the exchange of these finer energies,
controlled and directed by love, there is a power to
restore and maintain youth and vigor.
Astrology.-When, in the spring of the year, the
sun crosses the vernal equinox and enters Aries, rep-
282 The Sacred Tarot
resented by Arcanum XIII, the forces of nature
commence to move and new processes are set in
motion within the laboratories of Isis.
But the solar force in Aries is not alone capable of
regenerating the world; for such regeneration, or
any other regeneration, requires also that the femi-
nine forces shall be mixed with the masculine. This
transmutation, therefore, is not celebrated at the
vernal equinox, but on Easter, which can not occur
until after the full-moon has brought a partnership
and c:xchange with the sun, from the natural sign of
marriage.
This process, started at Easter, is carried forward
as the Sun enters Taurus, the exchange of the finer
forces fecundating the earth (Taurus) to bring forth
the grass and Bowers. For while Aries is the exalta-
tion of the Sun, Taurus is the exaltation of the
Moon, and the Sun moving thus into the exaltation
of the Moon after the partnership has been formed
carries forward the process of fructification. This
process by which fecundity is assured is pictured in
Arcanum XIV; and is thus associated with the sign
Taurus; for the bull also is a symbol of fecundity.
Human Function.-Already it has been shown
that Libra, and Arcanum III, correspond to feeling
in its external aspect. Libra is the sign of genera-
tion. The other Venus sign, Taurus, is the sign of
regeneration, and rules the inner sense of feeling
known as psychometry. Psychometery, therefore, is
the human function corresponding to Arcanum XIV,
which esoterically depicts the sign Taurus.
The Color of a Name 283
Alchemy.-Arcanum XIV represents the fluxing
of polar opposites, or mental antidotes. When the
minerals are predominantly acid, or positive, just
enough of the alkaline, or negative, minerals should
be added to balance the mixture; and when the min-
erals are predominantly alkaline, just enough acid
minerals should he added to balance the mixture.
When positive and negative, acid and alkaline, male
and female, energies are of like volume and intensity
the ingredients readily fuse and undergo transmuta-
tion into a different and far more valuable product.
But when either positive or negative elements are
not thus balanced by their polar opposite, it takes
more energy than can be generated to affect the
transmutation.
Bible.-The mystery of union as a spiritual force.
is set forth symbolically in the story of J acoh. First
he wrestled with Temptation, as shown by Arcanum
VI, and was Victorious, Arcanum VII. Then fall-
ing in love with Rachel, a~ symbolical of proper
physical union he served for her 7 years. Gen.
29 :30; "And Jacob served seven years for Rachel;
and they seemed unto him but a few days, for the
love he had of her." ·
But this perfect physical union signified by 7 did
not suffice; for it relates that he was deceived into
marrying Leah of the tender eyes. That is, his
spiritual sight was not thus opened. Therefore, he
served another 7 years for Rachel, the 14, as shown
by Arcanum XIV, indicating regenerate union.
And so much more satisfactory was this higher
fusion that in his great love for her he served volun-
284 The Sacred Tarot
tarily another 7 years. This 21, as shown by Arca-
num XXI, designates the true spiritual fusion, the
union of twin souls, the attainment of the Great
Work.
In Math. 28 :2, we have mention of the Transfor-
mation to a new life indicated by Arcanum XIII;
"And, behold, there was a great ~arthquake; for the
angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came
and rolled back the stone from the door and sat
upon it." And following this, in Math. 28 :18; this
new life entered into, or Regeneration accomplished,
Arcanum XIV, is indicated thus: "And Jesus came
and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto
me in heaven and in earth."
Masonry.-The Rosy Cross is but another method
of expressing the process portrayed by Arcanum
XIV. And the .same principle is more_briefly indi-
cated by the compass. 14 is the second decaYe of
5; and when wine, symbolical of spirit, is added to
the 5, as in the fifth libation of pure wine which is
drunk from a skull-the skull represents Arcanum
XIII-we again have the principle of regenerate
fusion expounded, this time in ritualistic form. And
as of universal application, instead of merely per-
sonal, Arcanum XIV is well rendered by the mystical
letters, INRI, which more correctly stand as the
initials of Igne Natura Renovature Integra, mean-
ing, All Nature is Renewed by Fire.
Magic~Love manifests on all planes and in vari-
ous degrees of grossness and refinements; for it is
convertible as passion, enthusiasm, heat, affection,
fire, deific solicitude. In truth, in some form of ex-
The Color of a Name 285
pression, it lies at the foundation of all activity, all
intelligen(:e, and all feeling.
As to man, there are three planes upon which his
love-life can express while he is still embodied. And
when we consider that the power of an energy to
benefit or to destroy depends upon the volume liber-
ated and the intensity of feeling which accompanies
it, it should be apparent that grossness, lust and
viciousness in sexual matters is one of the most de-
structive forces upon earth.
Yet as life depends upon harmony, and death fol-
lows in the footsteps of discord, when sex is actuated
by mutual esteem, and mutual harmony results, it
has even as great a building power. The harmonious
exchange of energies between husband and wife
tends to build health, to prolong youth, and to in-
crease the vitality.
Then as to the offspring, the intensity of the
father furnishes the vital force, and the intensity of
the mother the magnetic constitution.
The general health is thus usually more dependent
upon the mother than the father, but the length of
life more dependent upon those vital energies fur-
nished by the father. And upon a balance between
these two, as shown by the Sun and Moon in the
birth-chart, depends in great measure the discords
and harmonies, the fortunes and misfortunes, of its
life.
But Arcanum XIV treats of a plane above that
indicated by Arcanum VII. It reveals the mysteries
of regenerate love.
Regenerate love does not consist of any physical
286 The Sacred Tarot
act, nor does it consist of refraining from any fhysi-
cal act. Instead, it is a blend and exchange o finer
forces. This blend and exchange can take place be-
tween husband and wife even while they are far
distant in space from each other. In fact, when prop-
erly established, there is a continuous consciousness
of each other on the _part of both and the fusion
is more or less continuous. It is the beautiful ecstatic
union between two who are devoted to each other,
and who feel the most tender emotions toward each
other.
It is a pure and holy relation, and has nothing in
common with the practices of certain mediumistic in-
dividuals who leave their body to dissipate them-
selves and express unrestrained passion while thus
on the astral plane. All such practices are destruc-
tive, and once were features of the witch's sabbat.
They are much more destructive, because mote in-
tense and less subject to control, than physical dissi-
pation; and are harder to break off because of the
magnetic bondage established.
Nor is the regenerate union a matter of forced
celibacy; for this often stimulates to unnatural de-
sires, and always leads to an unbalanced magnetic
condition which is undesirable.
Instead, it is merely the complete fusion of the
finer forces of two purified souls who are working
together in loving harmony, and in tender sympathy,
for the advancement of the race. This fusion may
be broken at times through intruding discords from
without, but is again established at the first oppor-
tunity, and is maintained as completely as possible.
The Color of a Name 287
lnitiation.-ln the soul's initiation, Arcanum XIV
indicates that state of advancement in which there
is spir.ituality enough so that the animal desires and
passions are transmuted into tender expressions of
love which establish and maintain, with the matri-
monial partner, a constant exchange of the finer
energies. At this state of the soul's pilgrimage there
still may be occasional physical expressions; but the
chief and most satisfactory avenues for manifesting
love are now purely in the ecstatic and devoted ex-
change of invisible forces~
Occult Science.-Practical Occultism is the appli-
cation of the knowledge concerning astrology, con-
cerning psychology, concerning alchemy, and all
other invisible properties and energies to the affairs
of everyday life. As such it corresponds to Arca-
num XIV.
The Solar Spread.-The Solar Spread is based
upon the 50 .posts, or gates, of initiation. It thus
depends upon correspondences to the seven active
principles of nature which penetrate the seven de-
partments of human endeavor, for its revelations.
The spread as a whole constitutes the jubilee, or
fiftieth factor.
The cards are shuffled and cut as usual, and then
they are dealt from right to left in 7 rows of 7 cards
each as illustrated at the front of this booklet.
The cards should be turned over as read, starting
at the bottom row and reading from right to left.
When the birth-chart of the consultant is known,
each row of 7 cards reveals ~hose things that the
planet ruling the row governs in his birth-chart. And
288 The Sacred Tarot
in all cases the three cards to the right of the middle
card in any row govern the past of the department
of life, the middle card represents the present condi-
tion, and the three cards to the left of the middle
card reveal the future developments concerning this
department of life.
When the birth-chart is not at hand, or, if .the
reader is unfamiliar with astrology, each row is read
as referring to the department of life generally sig-
nified by the planet in front of the row.
Thus the bottom row, as ruled by the Moon, gov-
erns the home, the domestic life, the public, and if
the querent is a man, his wife. .
The second row from the bottom is ruled by Mer-
cury, and has rule over studies, travels, writing,
papers, brethren and the fruits of intelligence.
The third row from the bottom is ruled by Venus,
and relates to love, society, friends, partners, cash
and art.
The fourth row from the bottom-the middle
row-is ruled by the Sun and signifies the honor,
health and vitality, and if the querent is a woman,
indicates her husband.
The fifth row from the bottom is ruled by Mars
and relates to accidents, antagonisms and enemies.
The sixth row from the bottom is ruled by Jupiter
and refers to business, occupation, employment and
religion.
The seventh row from the bottom-the top row
-is ruled by Saturn and relates to elderly people,
real estate, sickness, losses, sorrows and secret
things.

THE WISH SPREAD
NATURAL TALISMANS AND
ARTIFICIAL CHARMS
F THE three types of invisible energies
which have a power to influence human
life and destiny, I have already given con-
sideration to those thought-vibrations
emanating from names and numbers.
Trains of thought are more specifically treated, in
their effect of changing the organization of the astral
form and thus attracting certain types of events into
the life, in Cqurse IX. Thus, in this and other
courses, I have quite fully explained the use and
effects of thought-vibrations. And in Course X I
have gone into the subject of astrological-vibrations.
There remains yet to consider, therefore, -only char-
acter vibrations.
The character-vibrations of localities, climates,
and types of environment are set forth in Lessons
No. 90 and No. 142; the character-vibrations of
plants and minerals are stated in connectio,n with the
various Arcana in this course; and the character-
vibrations of colors are explained more specifically in
Lesson No. 29.
Now, of course, the subject of character-vibrations
is as wide as the universe itself; for every object and
condition has its vibratory rate, which may influence
those associated closely with it. We, therefore, can
not hope to exhaust this subject; but I feel that some
mention, at least, should be made of the vibratory

TALISMANS AND CHARMS 295
quality of musical tones; and that, because of their
unusual potency, both artificial charms and talismanic
gems should receive special consideration.
Musical Tones.- Music has two influences. l'he
first is that which influences the mind through its
suggestive power, reaching it through the physical
sense of hearing. The rhythm, harmony and melody
thus reaching the consciousness stir up emotional
states and physical responses. Whether certain
music is beneficial or not depends upon the individual.
If it stimulates gross and selfish, or destructive,
thoughts and feelings, it is detrimental to the indi-
vidual. But if it engenders feelings of tenderness,
the desire for helpful service, .and aspirations to a
noble life, it is beneficial.
But the tones of a musical composition have an
astral vibratory rate as well as a physical one. The
chief vibratory rate, and the oqe that thus has most
inffuence directly upon the astral body, is that of the
Key in which the composition is played'. This key is
itself a musical tone; for instance, the Key of C.
The Key of C has an astral vibratory rate which is
the same as that radiated by the planet Mars, or by
the letter 0. The direct astral effect of a tone, or of
a musical composition played in the Key of that tone,
may be known by referring to the tone associated
with each Major Arcanum.
Talismanic Gems.-Talismanic gems differ from
artificial charms in that the inffuence of a ,talismanic
gem is that of its character-vibration, while the inffu-
ence of a charm is almost wholly due to the thought
vibration imparted to it.
296 THE SACRED TAROT
Gems are particularly active crystals which have
been attracted about lively and energetic souls occu-
pying the evolutionary plane of the mineral kingdom.
The active life of the astral form of the soul occupy-
ing a gem reflects itself somewhat in the brilliancy
of the gem. And due to the high degree of astral
intelligence possessed by certain kinds of gems, and
due to the powerful character-vibrations which they
radiate, they become among the most important of
all character influences with w.hich we can associate,
in their power to impart energy to the structure or
zone of the astral body of a person closely associ-
ated with them.
Now a birth-stone is merely a gem ruled by the
zodiacal sign occupied by the Sun on the day of
birth. And because the dynamic thought structure in
the astral body mapped by the place of the Sun in
the birth-chart is a very powerful thought group, a
gem ruled by this sign, when worn, through adding
energy to the structure mentioned, undoubtedly is
rather powerful to influence the life.
But, as pointed out when discussing other things
which add astral energy to structures and zones of
the astral body, whether this rather powerful influ-
ence will increase the power to attract good fortune
or will increase the power to attract misfortune, de-
pends upon whether or not, as shown by its aspects,
the Sun structure thus given power is harmoniously
or discordantly organized.
The rising sign, also, corresponds to very strong
thought-cells within the astral body. Consequently,
a gem ruled by the rising sign in the birth-chart has
TALISMANS AND CHARMS 297
a powerful influence upon the person. The intensify-
ing of these thought-cells lends itself to a more
energetic personality. This may have its advantages.
But whether such a gem will attract harmonious or
inharmonious events through the greater energy of
the personality depends on whether or not the rising
sign in the birth-chart is harmonious or discordant.
Furthermore, because certain stellar structures and
zones of the astral body, as shown by the house posi-
tions of the birth-chart, tend more to influence cer-
tain departments of life, and other structures and
zones to influence other departmerits of life, either a
gem or a person taken into close association adds
energy to the thought-cells of the astral body in that
zone which accentuates a given department of life.
That is, either a gem or a person adds energy to the
astral body of the one associated with it chiefly in
that compartment ruled by the dominant astrological
influence of the gem or person. Therefore, in select-
ing a talismanic gem, or any associate, this should be
kept in mind, and such should be chosen as will add
energy to the particular department of life where
help is most desired.
If the gem is desired, for instance, as an aid to
business success, it should have the same character-
vibration as the sign or planet in the birth-chart
most harmonious to business. If the gem is desired
as an aid to matrimonial harmony, one should be
worn having the same character-vibration as the sign
or planet in the birth-chart most harmonious to
matrimony. But for general purposes, a gem may be
selected that has the same character-vibration as the
298 THE SACRED TAROT
best planet or sign in the birth-chart.
A word of caution should be inserted here ; for
jewelers who are not occult students, and have only
a desire to push the sale of whatever gems they may
have in stock, sometimes get up a list of birth-stones
according to their fancy and their particular need
for sales. That is, having heard of birth-stones, but
having no actual knowledge of astrology, they gi'le
certain stones to certain months with no real infor-
mation on the subject.
The gem given to each zodiacal sign, in associa-
tion with the Major Arcana, is the one which, ac-
cording to the ancients and according to competent
occult students who have checked as to accuracy, has
been found most potent as having the character-
vibration of that sign. To these gems listed under
the Major Arcana should be added these other avail-
able gems which most powerfully have the character-
vibrations of the planets:
Sun-Sunstone.
Moon-Moonstone.
Jupiter-Chinese Jade.
Mars-Hematite.
Venus-Red Coral; also Amber.
Artificial Charms.- Charms do not owe their
potency to their character-vibrations, but to the
thought-vibrations imparted to them in their prep-
aration. Therefore, the substance used in the mak-
ing of charms should be mediumistic, in the sense of
receiving and retaining thought-inftuences.
We all know that a piece of iron, a knife~blade or
a nail, for instance, if rubbed repeatedly with a mag-
TALISMANS AND CHARMS 299
net, takes on the magnetic condition and itself be-
comes capable of attracting and holding other
objects. In like manner certain other metals-chiefty
gold, silver, copper and tin-have the ability to take
on, retain, and exert the influence of, a thought-
vibration imparted to them. That is, whatever
thought-influence is imparted to them with proper
ceremony and at proper time, becomes a part of the
charm, and the charm henceforth radiates this
thought-influence, whatever it may be.
Metals, unlike gems and stones, are very negative,
and radiate almost no character-vibrations; but they
readily, for this reason, absorb thought-vibrations
that may be imparted to them. Organic substances,
also, may be used in the manufacture of charms, if
pains be taken to select only those which, like the
young sprouts of peach, willow and witchhazel, are
negative in quality.
The black magician usually makes his charms of
organic substances of revolting c;haracter and in
grotesque form, the·symbolism thus tuning him in on
the type of invisible force he wishes to attract and
use. To this inversive image-as in voodoo rites-
he attaches a diabolical thought-form by means of
ceremonies and invocations to the spirits of evil; the
hideousness of the rite exciting the mind to fever
pitch and releasing emotional energy of sufficient
volume and intensity to impregnate the charm with
the sinister thought and attach to it elemental forces.
The fate of those who make such charms as this is
well depicted in Arcanum XVI. .
, Evil charms, however, are not always the outcome
300 THE SACRED TAROT
of design; for mediumistic substances often absorb
the mental images unconsciously impressed upon
them. Houses in which there has been great mental
anguish, or terrifying emotions associated with trag-
edy, sometimes become so permeated with these
thought-forms as decidedly to be uncomfortable, and
even unlucky, for subsequent occupants. For this rea-
son rooms in which there has been much sickness and
suffering should not be occupied, without special
purification and ceremony, by sensitive persons.
Certain famous jewels, though not in themselves
especially mediumistic, and therefore not particu-
larly suited to becoming charms, nevertheless,
through tragedies associated with them, have come
to exercise such an evil function. The emotional ac-
tivities accompanying the tragedy have attached to
the gem a vicious elemental, which is not the astral
counterpart of the gem, but an added intelligence of
malignant potency which guards it and brings mis-
fortune to all who possess it. Such is the Hope dia-
mond. And as probably bearing a more deliberate
curse, are the treasures t~ken from the tomb of the
Egyptian, Tut-Ank-Amen.
For ordinary purposes of making a fortunate
charm, 14k gold or sterling silver is excellent. For
special purposes a charm for a man may be made of
21k gold, lk silver, lk copper and lk tin; and a
charm for a woman may be made of 21k silver, lk
gold, lk copper and lk tin. The silver in the gold
charm and the gold in the silver charm are respon-
sive to the feminine element in man and the mascu-
line element in woman; while copper and tin exercise
TALISMANS AND CHARMS 301
the functions denoted by the planets Venus and
Jupiter, the love element a'nd the devotional.
Such a charm should be made only for some con-
structive purpose which can injure no one. The
thought ·the charm should carry should be imparted
to it with due ceremony and with as much high emo-
tional intensity as possible, at ·midnight (completing
the ceremony just before that time) of the full
moon (the midnight that occurs just previous to the
Moon making its opposition to the Sun). If the
Moon is in a negative sign, so much the better.
Whatever thought is thus imparted to the charm,
it will carry, and impart to the wearer. And it is
potent to bring good luck, or any certain type of
event into the life of the wearer, in proportion to the
clearness and the intensity of the thought thus im-
parted to it.

Remember, then, son of earth, that the most un-
profitable thing in the world is selfishness. Pride and
rebellion but enchain the soul to lower spheres; but
all trials and misfortunes accepted with resignation
to the supreme Will are an accomplished progress
302 THE SACRED TAROT
bringing an eternal reward. If Arcanum XV should
appear in the prophetic signs of thy horoscope, cease
to rely upon thy own power and wisdom and labor to
disengage thyself from pride and selfishness, which
but bind thee to matter, mortality and evil Fate.
In Divination, Arcanum XV may be read as Fatal-
ity or Black Magic. Arcanum XV is figured by
Typhon, genius of evil, standing triumphantly over
the ruins of a temple. In his right hand he holds a
scepter surmounted by a circle resting between two
divergent bars: These spreading bars signify the in-
versive forces that hem in and hamper the influence
of spirit, represented by the circle. It is the emblem
of hatred and division.
In the other hand this creature holds the torch of
destruction, whose blaze has been applied to the
ruins of the temple. He is crowned with flame to in-
dicate he is not of this world, and he has the wings
of a bat, to indicate he is a denizen of the realm of
darkness. The horn on his nose signifies stubborn
rebellion.
He has the breasts of a woman and the organs of
a man, and is thus hermaphrodite, emblem of self-
centeredness and a being devoid of love. The body
is that of a hog, to denote greed.. The feet are those
of a goat, to indicate the sign Capricorn, the home
sign of Saturn, or Satan; the sign most devoted to
material ambitions. And the beings chained at the
feet of this master of chaos als.o have goat heads,
indicating that their intelligence has been used exclu-
sively to further material and selfish ambitions.
This malignant entity has the head of a crocodile,
TALISMANS AND CHARMS 303
symbol of cruelty. The snake emerging from his
body, instead of from his brow, indicates the use of
the creative energy, not for enlightenment, but for
physical gratification. It also represents medium-
ship, rather than conscious control; for the chief
center of power in disintegrative mediumship is t~c
solar plexus. .
The two men with goat heads chained by the neck
at the monster's feet represent the certain fate that
awaits all who use magical powers to attain selfish or
purely material ends. Sooner or later they become
slaves of the very forces they have used, and are
finally completely destroyed in body and mind; and
even after passing to the next life, are chained by
their evil deeds in the underworld.
All such evil entities, of this plane and the next,
survive by preying on the ignorance and credulity of
others, as shown by the sign of sorcery they make
with their hands. They are -racketeers and gangsters
of both planes; and the ensemble, taken as a whole,
indicates both the bondage and the fate of those who
follow the inversive path and become dominated by
the spirit of selfishness.
Number.-Numerically, 15 is the second decave
of 6. Arcanum VI represents Trial and Temptation,
and Arcanum II, being negative, may bring a yield-
ing to such temptation to use invisible energies to
gain personal ambitions at the expense of others.
15, therefore, in this sense, is the number of black
magic. 5 is the religious hierophant, indicating the
intellect dominating the elemental world. But adding
10 brings a change in fortune; and if this change of
304 THE SACRED TAROT
fortune precipitates the master from his height, the
5 is reversed, and the elemental world dominates the
intellect. Thus the higher the station the farther the
fall, and when such fall occurs, the exalted priest
becomes a prince of evil, and is then represented not
by 5, but by 15.
Astrology.-! suppose, from a very extensive
study of birth-charts and the influence of progressed
planets in the lives of people, that the influence of
the planet Saturn coincides with at least one-half of
the total of all human suffering and misfortune. He
is the planet of crafty selfishness, and, more than any
other planet, seems to represent inexorable fate. He
well corresponds to Arcanum XV.
Human Function.-The physical body is man's
universe of matter. It is the external vehicle through
which the soul gains experience and manifests its
developing attributes. It should always be governed
by consideration of what actions, thoughts and feel-
ings contribute most to universal progression. But,
alas; all too often it is made merely the seat of ani-
mal gratification and the organ by which to gain
purely selfish ends. As the most external of man's
forms, and thus the least spiritual, the physical body
corresponds to the planet ~aturn, and to Arcanum XV.
Alchemy.-Arcanum XV is the impure ingredi-
ents which must be eliminated in any type of alchemy.
In mental alchemy they are the discords which are
annulled. In spiritual alchemy they are the material
effects as distinct from the influence on the character.
And in general this Arcanum represents the dross
which rises to the surface of the fluxed mixture as a
TALISMANS AND CHARMS 305
skum, or excess slag, which must be skimmed off and
cast aside.
Bible.--All the various references to Satan give
us the picture of Arcanum XV. Thus, Math. 8 :31;
"So the devils besought him, saying. If thou cast
us out, suffer us to go away into the herd of swine."
So the forces obsessing these men passed into swine,
or were symbolized by swine, because of their greed.
And their dashing down a steep place to perish in
the sea well depicts the condition and the end of
those who are ruled by selfishness; their affinity for
evil forces precipitating them into frightful practices
that are supported by abandoned emotions, and
w~ich, sooner or later engulf them in an ocean of
misery.
Arcanum XV is also the star of religion inverted:
Rev. 8 :10; "And a third part of the waters became
wormwood; and many men died of the waters, be-
cause they were made bitter." That 'is, the emotions
of men became corroded by selfishness.
Rev. 9:1; "And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw '
a star fall from heaven unto the earth; and to him
was given the key of the bottomless pit, as the smoke
of a great furnace; and the sun and air were dark-
ened by reason of the smoke of the pit." Thus is
described in accurate symbolism the slums and hells
of the astral region, and the works that emanate
from these regions.
Some maintain that the inversive brethren can
have no organization, but they are certainly misin-
formed. These entities are, in truth, the racketeers
and gangsters of the life after death. Even on earth
306 THE SACRED TAROT
bandits and gangs have their organizations and their
leaders. And such parasites on society when they
pass to the other side retain all their evil propensi-
ties and their cunning. They are human beasts
of prey, that hunt down and try to destroy the
defenseless.
Their chief method of getting victims is through
having ideas widely accepted that are untrue and
which place people in their power. To get these
ideas thus widely accepted, they have recourse to
thought-dissemination, to the suggestive power of
:epeti~ion , to insinuations, to platitudes, and to
mvers1ons.
Inversion is a method of presenting some idea in
a manner that the lie is deeply and inconspicuously
concealed amid much truth. The more real the facts,
and the more widely they are recognized as facts,
the better they afford cover for some cunning lie.
The inversive twist, by which the whole matter is
made to appear to have a meaning exactly the op-
posite of its true purport, is made. to occupy so small
a portion of the whole presentation, and is so cun-
ningly concealed by sophistical handling, that it es-
capes the notice of all but the most .acute. And this
inversive twist-the misinformation or misinterpre-
tation-is so worded as to be subject to no direct and
simple test of accuracy. It is left as full of loopholes
as possible, so that when one presentation of the
matter is proved to be a lie, it can be said that, after
all, something else was meant.
These inversions, having their origin in the astral
hells by those who would prey upon the credulity of
TALISMANS AND CHARMS 307
the human race, are well symbolized by smoke aris-
ing from the pit to darken the sun and air. And St.
Paul recognized this invisible influence when he says,
Eph. 6 :12; ~ 'For we wrestle not against flesh and
blood, .but against principalities, against powers,
against the rulers of the darkness of this world,
against spiritual wickedness in high places."
Masonry.-ln the Past Master's degree, the
power of th-e forces indicated by Arcanum XV are
represented by a riot when the candidate attempts to
preside over the lodge and is dethroned. The Secret
Master's degree is represented by Arcanum XIV.
But the Master's Elect of Fifteen degree is indicated
by Arcanum XV, in which the ruffians who assassi-
nated Hiram Abiff are overtaken and captured.
They attempted to take passage to Ethiopia, the
dark underworld region, but were overtaken and
paid the penalty.
Magic. - In Magic, Arcanum XV indicates all
those methods by which the selfish and evil strive to
gain control of others, to exploit them, and to make
them their slaves. This subject is elaborated in detail
in Lesson No. 188.
But here it is convenient only to point out that as
soon as some religion, some political doctrine, or
some philosophy gains a goodly following, that the
common course is for it to fall into the hands of those
who use it for their own selfish interests.
There are those on both planes who have power-
ful intellects, but no spirituality. They are intelligent
beasts of prey, having no sympathy, and no kindly
feelings for others. They are dominated by a greed
308 THE SACRED TAROT
for power, and permit nothing in heaven or earth to
stand in the way of their ambition.
By means of thought-diffusion-by sending out
powerfully charged thoughts, they dominate weaker
thoughts, and thus collect them as a snowball gathers
in size as it rolls down hill-they gain acceptance of
certain ideas, which are utterly false, but which are
advantageous to themselves. They worm themselves
into the highest positions of authority by showing
power of leadership. And as soon as they reach a
position where they can do so they begin to betray
their trust by warping ideas and twisting truths, so
that doctrines which were once spiritual and pure
become the very reverse of this.
Christianity at start boldly set out to renounce the
sword, and to be purely socialistic in its regard for
money and property. But as .soon as it gained suf-
ficient following those came into control who made
it a religion whose followers are noted for seeking
power and worldly goods, and who carried, by
means of torch and sword, their religion into every
land. With rifle bullets to back them they thrust the
Christian religion down the throats of weaker and
less organized people the world over, and made them
trade for their merchandise, greatly to Christian
profit. The missionaries have been pioneers of trade,
backed by soldiers, and later have been instruments
for keeping the doors of trade open.
The bloody crusades were for the purpose of es-
tablishing the religion of peace and good will by
means of the sword. And Christianity, as witnessed
by the world wars, continues to tolerate the murder
TALISMANS AND CHARMS 309
of one nation by another. I am not commenting on
whether war is necessary, or whether the preachers
did right in praying that God would help their sol-
diers kill the enemy. I am merely pointing out, that
right or wrong, the original teachings of Christi-
anity, as soon as the religion grew strong, were
twisted to mean just the opposite of their original
intent.
Confucianism was originally merely an interpreta-
tion of the Tao, but it degenerated into a political
lever used to persecute those who followed other
doctrines. Mohammedanism was to abolish priests
and rituals, but in after times these returned. Bud-
dhism now, having been practically driven from
India, teaches many things diametrically opposite to
its early doctrines, and like Brahmanism in India, is
a great political power.
Perhaps no doctrine was ever concocted and
forced on a people quite so successful in keeping
them servile and in despoiling them as Brahmanism
and its caste system, based on the doctrine of human
reincarnation. Through investing the priesthood
with the authority to say what acts give good karma
and what acts bad karma, and the belief in its fol-
lowers that bad karma is responsible for all the ills
of life, and that doing anything the priests forbid
condemns the individual to suffer in the next human
incarnation, it places an absolute power in the hands
of the priests which they use to enslave the people
while themselves living in luxury.
The effort is made also, in certain quarters, to dis-
courage a belief in a self-conscious, progressive, en-
310 THE SACRED TAROT
joyable life after death. It is taught we must return
to earth to gain experience, over and over again. But
the evidence of this inversion is too strong. Thou-
sands are proving for themselves that their loved
ones still live in full consciousness, and can, under
specific conditions, yet communicate with those on
earth.
But behind all these inversions, stands the cun-
ning, destructiveness and selfishness of those on both
planes, who, in some manner, profit by confusing and
deluding men.
lnitiation.-In the soul's pilgrimage Arcanum XV
represents the meeting with the Dweller on the
Thr~~~ I
This threshold dweller is Selfishness, and can only
be overcome by a.rigid determination to live for the
good of the whole and its progress, rather than for
self. When the individual decides, no matter where
the path leads, to step only in the direction of uni-
versal progress, to work only constructively, he meets
the grim dweller of the threshold.
You may be sure that racketeers and gangsters on
either plane resent with tremendous venom the res-
cue of victims from their clutches. Those who at-
tempt to enlighten their brethren, consequently, often
suffer vile persecution.
Savanarola and other noble martyrs, were libera-
tors of mankind from dark ignorance, and paid for
it with suffering. Martin Luther was not dreaming
when he threw his ink-well at the devil; and he
meant vastly more than appears on the surface when
he announced he married to please himself, to vex
TALISMANS AND CHARMS 311
the Pope and spite the devil. For where love is not,
selfishness rushes in to fill the void; and ascetism,
through extinguishing the finer emotions, prevents
the building up of spiritual strength. Intellect alone
can not build a spiritual body. It is feeling that
creates. And the ascetic crushes out the very emo-
tions of sympathy and kindness, of love and devo-
tion, which otherwise would build an immortal
vehicle for his soul.
Occult Sdence.-·Weather-predicting is the science
of forecasting, chiefly by means of astrological
charts and positions, what weather will prevail on a
given date. As influencing weather, especially
weather of severe character, the planet Saturn seems
most important. Therefore, this science corresponds
to Arcanum XV.
Youth Court Cards. - The Youth of Scepters
signifies a person ruled by the sign Sagittarius: benev-
olent, free, jovial, quick .tempered, energetic and
fond of outdoor sports. Right way up it denotes a
Sagittarius man; reversed it indicates a Sagittarius
woman. The dominant idea is I SEE.
The Youth of Swords signifies a person ruled by
the sign Capricorn: crafty, subtle, reserved and
avaricious. Right way up it denotes a Capricorn
man; reversed it indicates a Capricorn woman. The
dominant idea is I USE.
The Youth of Coins signifies a person ruled by the
sign Aquarius: witty, argumentative yet amiable,
artistic, humanitarian and fond of refined society.
Right way up it denotes an Aquarian man; reversed

tisement of pride.
In the intellectual world, the exhaustion of the
mind which attempts to penetrate the mystery of
God.
In the physical world, the ruin of fortune.
Remember, then, son of earth, that only God is
absolute. If Arcanum XVI should appear in the
prophetic signs of_
thy horoscope, reflect on the old
oaks that have defied the ravages of time and have
finally been brought down after a century of immu-
nity; and think that thou too mayst be brought low
at the very moment of thy great arrogance by some
unexpected blow.
In Divination, Arcanum XVI may be read as Acci-
dent or Catastrophe.
Arcanum :X:VI is figured by a pyramid decapitated
by a thunderbolt. A crowned and uncrowned man are
precipitated from a platform built of seven stages,
TALISMANS AND CHARMS 313
falling down with the rest of the debris.
A pyramid is the most stable of solids, is the sym-
bol of the earth, and also represents the climax of
earthly security. As composed of four trines, which
are its sides, corresponding to the houses of a birth-
chart, it symbolizes the horoscope of physical life.
From mineral up to man there are seven degrees of
mundane life, the seventh, or last stage of incarna-
tion, being that of man. After one incarnation of
man, and thus gaining self-consciousness, the soul
continu·es its progress in higher-than-physical spheres.
Thus the platform on which the men were standing
represents the last incarnation in matter.
That the pyramid has been struck by lightning to
the disaster of both a crowned and an uncrowned
man, symbolizes that Nature is no respecter of per-
sons, and that she strikes down both the high and
the low, kings as well as subjects, who transgress her
law. It is also the symbol of those rivalries which
are so common among men, which divert energies
into channels that result in ruin for all. It signifies
sterile projects, ill-considered enterprises which are
doomed to failure, ambitions which are frustrated,
and death by catastrophe. And it represents the false
security which results from material success and the
reliance upon purely material science, as well as the
sure punishment which is attracted ultimately by all
those who use magical forces in the attainment of
selfish ends.
Number.-Numerically, 16 is the second decave
of 7, and thus represented by Arcanum VII, or com-
plete physical union, used on the negative plane of
314 THE SACRED TAROT
Arcanum II. In this aspect it indicates the power of
sex to destroy, when actuated by any motive other
than love. Lust, selfish gratification with no care for
the feelings of the other, union actuated by desire
for gain, and union in the practice of magic, all gen-
erate a force, but this force is destructive in quality.
Sex magic, in particular, generates a frightful force,
but, as indicated by 8 plus 8, in the end reacts on the
user and brings to him a violent punishment.
Astrology.-Astrologically, Mars is the planet of
passion, of war, of violence, of accident, of sud-
den destruction. As such it is well portrayed by
Arcanum XVI.
Human Function.-A great deal is said in con-
demnation of the animal propensities that so fre-
quently crop out in the actions of men. But these
animal propensities are merely men's most valuable
assets in a state of undevelopment. They should not
be encouraged,to express their animal activities, it is
true, yet without them to furnish energy, still higher
functions would have no power.
Nature has been at great pains to develop those
qualities which lead to self-preservation and race-
preservation. These qualities are selfish, having been
developed through the struggle with other forms of
life, for survival. But even though they are, on the
animal plane, self-centered, and dedicated largely
to the destruction of enemies and the gaining of sus-
tenance with no thought as to the consequence to
others, nevertheless, in order thus to preserve and
provide for self and family, creatures have developed
initiative and an energy supply. This energy supply
TALISMANS AND CHARMS 315
and aggressiveness is the force behind the animal soul
of man, to which Arcanum XVI corresponds.
Yet without this animal energy man would have
no force, would be able to accomplish nothing. The
animal propensities are the sole source of his energy,
they are the reservoir from which he must draw for
any spiritual ·accomplishment. Intellectual force may
be on the plane of the animal, seeking selfish ends,
or on the plane of the spiritual, seeking good for all.
But while man is still in the flesh, even spiritual en-
ergy must draw its force from the volume of energy
developed by the animal; transmuting it merely, that
is, diverting it from a selfish to an unselfish, purpose.
Therefore, before there can be a vigorous divine
soul, or a vigorous spirituality, there is usually pres-
ent a vigorous and active animal soul.
Alchemy.-In Alchemy, Arcanum XVI represents
the heat of the reverberatory furnace. This, on the
mental plane, is supplied by feeling, the feeling
of pleasure or pain. On the spiritual plane it is
supplied by a -still higher type of feeling, by aspira-
tion and inspiration; and in its highest manifestation
it arises from an insatiable longing to assist to the
highest possible degree in .the advancement of the
universe and the happiness and joy of all forms
of life.
Bible.-Elijah built an altar of twelve stones,
represented by the four triangular sides of the pyra-
mid of life shown in Arcanum XVI. Kings, 18 :38 ;
"Then the fire of the Lord fell, and consumed the
burnt sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the
dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench."
316 THE SACRED TAROT
The fire is seen thus falling in the Arcanum under
consideration.
Sex magic also is mentioned in Revelations, and
the destruction of all those who follow such prac-
tices: "Mystery, Babylon the Great, the mother of
harlots and abominations of the earth." And, Rev.
16 :18, "And there were voices and thunders, and
lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, such
as was not since men were upon the earth, so mighty
an earthquake, and so great."
The great pyramids of Mexico, and those of the
Mound Builders of the Mississippi Valley, had a
flat place on top, where a fire was built by a priest.
Atlantis is reputed to have been sunk in a single
night by volcanic action and earthquake. Sodom and
Gomorrah perished by fire and brimstone, and the
Tower of Babel, according to Bible tradition, was
never completed. And to still further clarify Ar-
canum XVI, it may be repeated that those who take
up the sword perish by the sword, that those who
seek to destroy others, themselves meet destruction.
Masonry.-·ln Masonry, the Master's Elect of
Nine degree is based upon Arcanum XVI. We find
that Joabert steals ahead of the other pursuers, and
discovering one of the assassins of Hiram Abiff
asleep, stabs him in the head and in the heart, then
cuts off his head and carries it home.
The 15 craftsmen who conspire to murder Hiram
are represented by Arcanum XII. Tubalcain repre-
sents the constructive attributes of the planet Mars,
while Cain represents the destructive side. Thus the
three assassins of Hiram, and their punishment, as
TALISMANS AND CHARMS 317
well as the act of Cain, are symbolized by Ar-
canum XVI.
Magic.-Arcanum XVI illustrates one of the most
certain principles of magic, that any destructive force
sent against another, when the period of its orbit
has been completed, will return to inflict punishment
upon the sender.
To send out an evil, or destructive, thought or
force, a corresponding center, or point of projection
must be formed in the astral body. This nucleus of
evil, or discord, itself attracts influences of like qual-
ity, and thus ultimately brings misfortune upon the
· one who projects such a force.
To fight an invisible force is but to increase its
power, unless the source of it is completely de-
stroyed; for thinking about it in the act of fighting
it keeps the person tuned in on its vibratory rates.
One can, of course, build a protection of cold de-
flective armour about oneself, which will prevent the
entry of such a force. Still better, one can tune in on
some entirely different interest so strongly that the
invisible energy is cut off, the receiver hung up. This
is the safest of all methods.
But to start in to fight any individual, on any
plane, by means of mental force, is dangerous, and
nearly always brings punishment. I do not mean that
injustices should be permitted. But that thought-
force, or magical energies, sent against another,
usually do as much damage in the long run to the one
sending them, as to the one against whom they .are
sent. Truth must be upheld, and the weak protected.
But not by using mental magic as a weapon.
318 THE SACRED TAROT
Evil influences can not exist in an atmosphere of
love and constructive effort, nor can they penetrate
into such a region. Therefore instead of sending out
other discordant vibrations in combat, evil forces
should be ignored, and only constructive thoughts
built up and sent out. Such constructive efforts, to-
gether with the high ·energy supplied by love, para-
lyze any force of evil; for it can accomplish nothing
in such an environment.
lnitiation.-In the soul's pilgrimage, Arcanum
XVI indicates that stage of development where the
neophyte finds himself called upon to protect those
weaker than himself from the influence of destruc-
tive psychic forces. But whether these forces are
such as arise from the practice of disintegrative
forms of mediumship, or are those directly from the
inversive magi, either on earth or in the astral, he
should obey 'the admonition of the Bible to overcome
evil with good. If he builds the things he desires, if
he constructs love and harmony, destructive forces
can find no point of contact or influence.
Occult Science.- Stellar Diagnosis and Stellar
Healing is the science of diagnosing from the birth-
chart and progressed positions of the planets the
nature of the disease, and of applying the appropri-
ate energies to the physical and astral bodies which
will restore harmony; for all disease is caused by
discord. Such a discord is depicted by Arcanum XVI.
The Wish Spread.~The wish spread is used to
determine if some wish will be realized. (Picture of
this spread on frontispiece.)
TALISMANS AND CHARMS 319
First a card to represent the one making the wish
is selected and placed face up in the center of the
spread.
The cards of the deck are then spread out, face
down, and fifteen of them to be used in this spread
are selected at random. The other cards are then
discarded.
The fifteen are shufHed and cut in the common
routine manner, and dealt, one at a time, face down-
ward. Three go to the left of the central card, three
above it, three to the right of it, three below it, and
three in the center on it.
To read, turn those over to the left-1-2-3,
saying, "This is what surrounds you."
Then turn over and read those above-4-5-6,
saying, "This is your wish."
Next turn over and read those at the right-7-
8-9, saying, "This is what opposes you."
Following which turn over and read those below-
10-11-12, saying, "This is what comes to your
home."
And finally turn over and read those in the center
-13-14-15, saying, "This is what you will
realize."
If the wish-card-the 9 of cups-appears any-
where in the reading except in "This is what opposes
you," it is a sure sign that the wish, at least in part,
will be realized. The place where it falls will deter-
mine how soon it will come, the closer it is to card 1
the sooner the matter will come to pass. But if the
320 THE SACRED TAROT
wish-card-the 9 of cups-falls on 7, 8, or 9, the
desire will not be gratified, and the cards will show
why.
When the wish-card-the 9 of cups-fails to ap-
pear, if the cards are very favorable the wish will
come true, but if unfavorable, it will be denied. In
either case the cards by their different stations will
indicate the details and show why the result is as
denoted.

CHRONOLOGY OF THE TAROT
S the tarot is a pictorial synthesis of the
universe, not only must it correspond to
astrological influences, but also to the va-
rious divisions of time which are measured
by these influences.
Already I have pointed out in some detail the
strict correspondence between the 22 Major Arcana
and the 10 planets and 12 zodiacal signs, that the 12
common Court Arcana describe people born under
each of the 12 signs of the zodiac, and that the 4
horseman Court Arcana signify thoughts that relate
to the 4 departments of life.
Now, as fully explained -in lessons No. 103 and
No. 104, each zodiacal sign is divided into three
equal sections, called decanates. Each of these dec-
anates embraces 10 degrees of the zodiac and has an
influence distinctly its own. Thus in each quadrant
of the zodiac there are 9 decanates. These decanates
of the zodiac, however, each belong to one of the
four elements; that is, to the triplicity of fire, of
water, of air or of earth. The 10th, or transitional
influence, therefore, represents the element to which
the 9 decanates belong; for the 9 decanates are dis-
tributed among the three signs which make up one of
the zodiacal triplicities. Thus the Minor Arcana of
325
326 THE SACRED TAROT
.. ) y
. '
CHRONOLOGY OF THE TAROT 327
any one suit do not belong to one quadrant of the
zodiac, hut to signs in three quadrants; the triplicity
to which they belong being designated by the suit,
and the 10th Minor Arcanum of each suit, represent-
ing the completion of the cycle of that element and a
transition to some other, more conveniently being
placed adjoining the fixed sign of the element to
which its suit belongs.
The astrological relationship of each card of the
tarot is given in the key at the front of lesson No.
22. This key contains vastly more than is apparent
at first glance, and is well worth careful study fol-
lowed by deep meditation. The ring of the key
shows the rulership of each decanate and each tri-
plicity of the zodiacal circle in relation to each of
the 40 Minor Arcana of the tarot. The stem of the
key shows the relation between each planet and sign
to one of the 22 Major Arcana. The wards of the
key turn in the three worlds; physical, astral and
spiritual. And the people who exert an influence in
these three worlds, and the four types of their
thoughts, are shown on these wards as the 16 Court
Arcana.
Here, however, we are more interested in·chro-
nology. The 12 common Court Arcana which repre-
sent people born during each of the 12 months, of
course, correspond to the 12 months of the year.
The 4 Horsemen, who represent the type of influ-
ence each person exerts through his thoughts, cor-
respond to the distinctive influence exerted by each
of the four seasons. If we include the 40 Minor Ar-
328 THE SACRED TAROT
cana, giving to each suit 13 cards in addition to the
Horsemen, they then correspond t~ the influence of
the 4 seasons, which contain 13 X 4, or 52 weeks.
And the 22 Major Arcana then represent the 22
astrological influences that cause the weeks and sea-
sons.
The numerical value of the Minor Arcana of each
suit, obtained by adding their numbers, is 55; or
220 for all 40 cards. The value of the 12 Common
Court Arcana is 10 each, or 120. The value of the
Horsemen is one each, or 4 for all; and as each Ma-
jor Arcanum represents a single principle, if we
omit the no-numbered tarot for the present, it gives
us for the value of the whole tarot pack, Z20 plus
120 plus 4 plus 21, or 365.
Yet the no-numbered tarot does not represent
exactly zero, but any indeterminate quantity, which
in this case may be taken as a trifle more than 34.
This no-numbered tarot, which here is given an ar-
bitrary value of slightly more than 34, represents
both the unknown factors of astronomical calcula-
tions and of human endeavors. It recognizes that
both people and stellar bodies have the power to
deviate slightly through the use of their own volition
from any orbit defined for them by environmental
influences. It thus signifies the inherent power of
action known as Free Will. But in the Chronology
we are considering it becomes something more than
34 day in excess of 365, such as is found in a year.
The Birth-Chart.-Turning now to a more prac-
tical application, it is found that the Major Ar-
cana can give the astrologer additional information,
when it is required, about a birth-chart or a pro-
CHRONOLOGY OF THE TAROT 329
gressed chart. The chart may be completely read,
if desired, by placing each of the Major Arcana on
the place occupied in the chart by its corresponding
astrological sign or planet. Then it should be noted
what might he expected, in the houses where the in-
fluences fall, from such combinatio11s of forces as are
shown by the tarot cards when united, either discord-
antly or harmoniously, as indicated by the astrologi-
cal aspects.
The chief value of the tarots to the astrologer,
however, is their use in this mannet: when he is in
doubt, or needs additional information. When, in
natal astrology, horary astrology, mundane astrology,
stellar diagnosis, or in any other branch, he finds
some difficult problem, such as determining what will
transpire under a certain progressed aspect; if he
will combine the cards according to the aspects and
conditions in the chart, they often will shed an illu-
minating light that makes the answer clear.
Talismans Other Than Gems....:_Although stones
and gems are more durable than others, they are
not the only substances that can he used as talis-
mans. Plants, for instance, have a temporary talis-
manic value when worn by those in whose hirth-
charts the sign ruling-the plant is harmonious. And
because some plants may be quite antagonistic to an
individual, it is much better to select plants for the
home and garden, not indiscriminately, but with the
end in view of obtaining such as have a strengthen-
ing quality of astral vibration, and the aromas of
which furnish subtle essences harmonious to the soul.
330 THE SACRED TAROT
For talismanic purposes the young growing shoots
or the parts bearing the flowers and seeds should be
used. A good time to gather plants, either for talis-
manic or medicinal purposes, is during the hour just
before the Moon rises in the sign ruling the plant,
the best time being just at moonrise while the moon
is in the sign ruling the plant.
Animals also sometimes have an influence similar
to talismans, this being particularly true of domes-
tic pets, such as cats, dogs and horses. When the
attachment between the pet and its master is pro-
nounced there is a keen desire on the part of the
animal to afford protection and benefit. This desire
stimulates its unconscious mind. And the uncon
scious mind, even of a creature much lower in the
scale than man, through its psychic senses, has a very
wide scope of perception. Not being inhibited by
reason, the things that it thus senses psychically may
make quite a strong impression upon it, and cause it
to behave in such a way that it warns its master of
approaching evil.
Even after the animal dies, its strong attachment
to its master may cause it to linger in the astral
realm quite close to him. Its unconscious mind, thus
free from physical limitations, has a scope of intel-
ligence far beyond what we expect of such an animal
on earth. It perceives, from the astral plane, the
events that affect its master. And it keenly senses his
wishes, and desires that these wishes shall be granted.
It may thus, from time to time, be able to convey
to him, through dreams and impressions, a knowl-
edge of such conditions as are about to affect him.
CHRONOLOGY OF THE TAROT 331
Or it may follow him to the seance room, and if this
be of a certain low order, assist in manifestations
there.
I am not assuming that an animal, just because it
passes to the next plane, acquires human intelligence.
But an animal which has had much human associa-
tion while on earth, has little difficulty in sensmg JUSt
what its former master wants. Just as, while on
earth, a dog will fetch a stick that its master throws,
so on the next plane will it try to do that which will
please. It has not acquired human intelligence, but
because it is free from the body its unconscious mind
has a wide scope of perception, and it is more re-
sponsive than ever to its master's thought. And it
sometimes finds opportunity to manifest an intelli-
gence of a not very high order in the seance room.
But aside from talismans and exceptional types of
influences, the various objects of our environment
each radiate a characteristic energy. If an object vi-
brates to the frequency of an astrological influence
which is beneficial in our birth-chart, through increas-
ing the strength of the .harmonious vibration in us it
renders us assistance. But the association with either
objects or people which stirs up in ·us consciously or
unconsciously, a feeling of discard, should be avoided
as much as is practicable; for we attract events into
our lives that correspond to the discords or har-
monies we harbor within.
Response to Healing.-This same principle ex-
plains why some people respond readily to one type
of healing and some to another. By inspecting the
332 THE SACRED TAROT
birthcchart and the progressed chart the astrologer
quickly can determine which planet's vibrations are
chiefly responsible for the trouble. Then by referring
to the Arcanum ruled by the planet he can find the
Natural Method of treatment which is commonly
most efficacious in correcting the discords caused by
the planet.
Thus if Mercury causes the affliction, mental heal-
ing is particularly applicable. If Neptune is the chief
disturber, the disease is more susceptible to spiritual
healing. Jupiter brings ailments that need a correc-
tive diet. Venus tends to depletion that may be
treated with rest and recreation. Uranus produces
peculiar distu_
rbances in the electromagnetic body
that often yield readily to electricity and mesmerism.
The discords of Pluto yield quickly to stellar healing.
Water is the natural remedy for the afflictions caused
by the Moon, and light for those caused by the Sun.
If Mars is the disturber there is usually a tempera-
ture to be reduced, and if Saturn is back of the dis-
cord you may be sure that the vitality is low and needs
earth-baths and outdoor life to build it up.
The affliction shown by a planet, due to the sign
it is in, may manifest its discord· in any one of the
twelve zones of the body. In this course certain
herbs ruled by each sign are given under the Ar-
canum corresponding· to the sign. This will enable
you to select those suitable for temporary talismans,
or those that, through a corresponding vibratory
rate, most readily affect the part of the.body ruled
by the 'same sign. For more details of the rulership

of specific diseases you are referred to Course XVI
on Stellar Diagnosis and Stellar Healing.
Herbal remedies are administered according to
two different schools of thought. The homeopathic
system is that like cures like. From the occult point
of view this means that an herb belonging to a cer-
tain sign, if taken into a healthy organism in exces-
sive amounts, tends to cause a diseased condition of
the corresponding part of the body. But if that part
of the body is already diseased, the taking of the herb
corresponding to this part of the body in very small
amounts, builds up and strengthens this part of the
body with its similar vibratory rate. In other words,
the remedy is applied in such quantity as will give
the diseased part the vigor to overcome the disease.
But this system can not be successfully applied to
all diseases. Hence we have the allopathic system,
which works on the principle that contrary cures con-
trary. From the occult point of view this means that
the disease itself is attacked and an attempt made to
annihilate it by means of something violently antag-
onistic to it. Instead of building up the vigor of the
diseased part of the body, the attempt is made to
destroy the disease and eliminate it from the body.
Fire is thus fought with water, earth with air, and
Mars with Saturn. This method seemingly is neces-
sary to combat certain virulent diseases, but, through
the violence of the remedies used, is much more apt
to impair the constitution.
Here, of course, no attempt is made to discuss the
relative value of medicines, or to give instructions in
334 THE SACRED TAROT
the specific cure of diseases through the administra-
tion of herbs. Instead, I merely give such hints as
to the relative principles of underlying cures as I hope
will prove of value to those who specialize in heal-
ing. From these hints they should be able to work
out, in connection with their experience, the applica-
tion in detail. And when the nature of the disease is
obscure and the method of treatment in doubt, the
use of the tarot as a divinatory instrument, by one
who has some skill, can be used both in diagnosis
and in determining the most effective treatment to
secure a speedy recovery.

key will be given thee; then a ray of divine light will
break from the occult sanctuary in order to dissipate
the shadows of thy future and show thee the way of
CHRONOLOGY OF THE TAROT 335
happiness. If Arcanum XVII should appear in the
prophetic signs of thy horoscope, whatever may hap-
pen in life, never injure the flower of hope and thou
wilt gather the fruits of faith.
In Divination, Arcanum XVII may be read as
Truth, Hope or Faith.
Arcanum XVII is figured by a blazing star of
eight rays in the center of which is a white trine with
point upward joined at its.base to a black trine with
its point downward. This star is surrounded by seven
other stars. It hovers over a nude young girl who
has one foot upon the sea and one foot upon the
land, and who pours the fluid of universal life from
two cups, one of gold, the other of silver. Near the
girl is a flower of three blossoms, and above the upper
one a butterfly opens its wings.
This young girl is the emblem of truth. She is
nude, signifying that truth can be perceived only
when stripped of the preconceived ideas and dog-
matic opinions with which it has been clothed by the
artificialities of civilization.
She rests partly upon the land and partly upon the
sea to denote that truth is dual, the truth of reality
and the truth of appearances, the truth of the prac-
tical and the truth of the ideal. The fluid is poured
from a silver cup into the sea to indicate that the
loving, emotional side of man's nature must be nour-
ished if he is to grasp the inner truth. And it is
poured from a golden cup upon the land to denote
the necessity of cultivating the positive, reasoning
intellect if he is to possess the external truth.
336 THE SACRED TAROT
The fluid flowing_ from the golden cup represents
the forces of man, and that from the silver cup the
forces of woman; together revealing the truth of
soul-mate-hood, and indicating how the finer energies
of man rejuvenate woman and how the finer energies
of woman rejuvenate man; their forces mutually sus-
taining each other and making a joint immortality
possible. .
The eight-point star symbolizes the Law of Equi-
librium, the balance between spirit and matter, male
and female, the inner and the outer. It is the book
of the apocalypse sealed with seven seals, and thus
represents the inner realization and the outer real-
ization, the birth of the soul and the birth of the
body, under the influence of the planets, represented
by the 7 surrounding stars, or seals.
Each of these smaller stars, or seals, has four
points, to signify that man should recognize the na-
ture of its intluence and realize how to direct it into
channels of his own choosing.
The two trines of the larger star symbolize the
Hermetic Axiom, "As it is below, so it is above," and
reveal that evolution implies a preceding involution.
It also indicates the necessity of experiences with both
good and evil for soul progression.
The flower of three blossoms represents the three
planes of existence from which the soul sips the nec-
tar of wisdom, gaining thereby the strength to attain
immortality, symbolized by the butterfly.
Number.-Numerically, 17 is the 2nd decave of
8, denoting the crystallized condition of Arcanum
CHRONOLOGY OF THE TAROT 337
VIII polarized to the frequency-level denoted by
Arcanum IL It is involution followed by evolution,
for, after all, matter is but polarized spirit. In the
universe there is but one Principle, which manifests
under two modes of metion as force and will. There
is but one LAW, and this is sex, manifesting as male
and female. There is but one Agent, which manifests
as spirit and matter. And there is but one Truth,
which manifests as appearance and reality. This is
the truth represented by the star of Arcanum XVII.
Astrology.-The most pronounced symbolism of
Arcanum XVII pertains to its duality, and the most
dual sign of the zodiac is Gemini. This sign, pic-
tured among the constellations as the Twins, repre-
senting Reason and Intuition, belongs to the first
degree of emanation of the airy triplicity, and there-
fore represents the most interior and free use of the
intellect. It corresponds to the day house of Mer-
cury, the planet of mental expression, and thus is a
fitting symbol of Truth. Better than any other sign,
Gemini typifies the duality that sustains all worlds
and alone makes life and consciousness possible
Human Function.-The first step toward truth is
perception. This perception should embrace both
sides of the situation. And while knowledge requires
also an inner comprehension of the meaning of things
seen, the necessity for correct sight is implied in the
vernacular expression, "I see," used to signify com-
prehension. Mercury rules both Gemini and the eyes,
and as Gemini corresponds to the day house of Mer-
cury, it is more closely allied with the external vision.
338 THE SACRED TAROT
And if additional testimony were required to show
the correspondence of the sense of sight with Ar-
canum XVII, it could be found in the restless activity
of the eyes, and of the ~a_tives of Gemini, in their
unceasing search for new information and new
experiences.
Alchemy.-Arcanum XVII pictures the finding of
the fountain of eternal youth. Gold and silver have
been completely purified and the dross removed.
Each, united ,to a proper flux, has been reduced to
the first matter in the reverberatory furnace. And
as a result of their transmuted union they are no
longer merely gold and silver, but a delectable fluid,
the coveted elixir of life.
Many have sought, but few have found, this pre-
cious draught. Some who have had it ready to their
hand, have failed to recognize it. Others have dis-
covered it accidentally, and while deeply awed by its
wonderful properties have never perceived its real
use and partaken of its life-giving properties. More
have been poisoned by drinking that which they
hoped would prove to be the elixir, a fluid somewhat
resembling it, but in reality quite destructive. Yet
Arcanum XVII pictures its preparation in unmistak-
able terms to those who do not discard the simple
and plain in search for the intricate and complex.
Bible.-The first pointed reference in the Bible to
Arcanum XVII is Gen. 1:27; "So God created man
in his own image, in the image of God created he
him; male and female created he them."
CHRONOLOGY OF THE TAROT 339
Thus is revealed the great truth exemplified in still
more detail by the duality shown in Arcanum XVII.
For not only does it point out that man is formed in
the image of God, that the microcosm is a miniature
copy of the macrocosm, but that both are, when com-
plete, male and female. Whatever exists in the starry
firmament above, according to both the Bible and
this Arcanum, must have its correspondence in the
constitution of man. But in addition thus, to formu-
lating the relation of the soul to the stars, it states
positively that the macrocosm is both male and fe-
male; and implies that souls to persist must retain
their sex; for when this attribute is destroyed man
ceases to be an image of God, and no longer partakes
of the divine nature.
John 8 :32 reads; "And ye shall know the truth
and the truth shall make you free." Now freedom
implies a previous bondage. Th6- bondage here con-
sidered is that imposed by the restrictions of the
physical. But these restrictions are removed when
the truth is perceived of man's relations to the uni-
verse, and that the soul, educated for a definite mis-
sion in the cosmic scheme, survives physical death.
Rev. 5:1 mentions Arcanum XVII: "And I saw
in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a
book written within and on the back side, sealed with
seven seals:" This, of course, is the book of nature,
under the dominion of the 7 planets; and through a
knowledge of it immortality is gained, for it enables
the soul to partake of the tree of life mentioned in
Gen. 3 :22.
340 THE SACRED TAROT
Just how this book of nature is to be opened and
its contents made plain is quite distinctly stated;
"Behold, the Lion of the tribe of Juda, the Root of
David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose
the seven seals thereof." As the lion is the zodiacal
sign Leo, which rules the house of love, it is clear
that the affections are used. But this is not the only
factor; for next we read that the Lamb took the
book. This is the zodiacal sign Aries, ruling the
head. And this explains to us, in the language of
universal symbolism, that neither love nor reason
alone is sufficient, but that truth can be grasped com-
pletely only when there is a union of head and heart.
And thus does the Lamb here typify the soul which
has triumphed over Arcanum XIII, or death, through
the combined activity of its intellect and its affections.
Masonry.-The degree of Provost and.Judge is
based upon Arcanum XVII. The duality of truth is
symbolized in this degree by two keys. One is the
key to the small ebony box contaiRing the plans for
building the temple, that is, the key to understanding
the Divine Plan. The other is the key to the ivory
box containing the temple keys, that is, the laws
which govern the universe and the progress of the
soul. The ivory box and the ebony box clearly indi-
cate that both positive keys and negative keys are
required, and that man and woman complement and
complete each other.
Magic.-ln Magic, Arcanum XVII is the percep-
tion of both the external and the internal truth. Such
perception is made possible through the cultivation
CHRONOLOGY OF THE TAROT 341
of the soul senses. But, because, through the principle
that like attracts like, even a slight desire to deceive
others attracts deceiving influences, care should be
exercised here. The desires of the unconscious mind,
also, have a tendency to warp such information to
coincide with them, as it is raised from the astral
brain to the physical consciousness. When one be-
comes unusually sensitive an idea through its senti-
ment may exert so strong an appeal that the emotion
may easily be mistaken for soul-response. Then,
again, the thought images projected by other power-
ful minds are sensed by the psychic faculties, and
those not fully initiated are apt to respond to these
as if they were soul-responses to truth, when they, in
fact, are merely being dominated by thought-forms.
Therefore, while the pure intuitions of the soul,
when sufficiently freed from various other influences,
are reliable guides to truth; for those who have not
attained a very high degree of spiritual initiation,
they can not be relied upon too implicitly. Conse-
quently, in the search for truth, and in its apprehen-
sion, one set of faculties is used to test the accuracy
of the other; intuition is used to check the reports of
reason, and reason is applied to determine the relia-
bility of intuition. Thus the initiate grasps both the
exoteric ~nd the esoteric aspects of truth.
He perceives that every atom of physical life is
but the symbolic .expression on the external plane of
an indwelling spirit-atom. With his psychic vision he
notes that every living form is a collection of these
indwelling spirit-atoms controlled by a central soul-
342 THE SACRED TAROT
monad. This monad furnishes the conditions for
their progress, as they do for it, dominating them by
virtue of its labors in past incarnations.
That is, every plant and animal, as well as gem
and stone, is but the material vehicle through which
some soul is evolving and elaborating its powers.
These astral entities that mold the form of crystals,
plants and animals, causing them to assume the
shapes they do, are the realities; for they continue to
occupy new and higher forms, while the material
forms they inhabit are transitory and unenduring,
and consequently but an appearance.
The initiate recognizes the truth of appearance at
its true value. He does not deny the existence of
matter and its properties; for to those occupying the
physical plane misery, disease and sin are as real as
are spiritual verities to those occupying interior
realms. It is as great a mistake to deny the qualities
expressed by material form as to deny the reality of
the spiritual ideals causing their expression. To one
living entirely upon the physical plane the mere
denial that a substance is a poison will not prevent it
causing the death of the body. But to suppose that
the material particles are the real cause of the fatal-
ity is to observe but one side ot the truth; for these
particles are but the material vehicles of spirit-atoms
that have a violent antipathy toward human life.
They are really the physical expression of a spiritual
ideal, or idea, and this idea can be sensed psychically.
If the spiritual development of the person is such
that he realizes his own source and destiny, that he
CHRONOLOGY OF THE TAROT 343
belongs to a higher spiritual state than the destruc-
tive forces of the poison, and that by virtue of his
function in the cosmic scheme he should and can
dominate all submundane atoms of life; in other
words, if his spiritual nature is active, he can partake
of the most violent poisons, or pass through fire as
did Shadrack and his companions, unharmed, because
his spirituality enables him to compel the obedience
of the spirit-atoms of the poison or the elementals of
fire, preventing them from acting as usual.
Again, let us glance about us. The initiated see in
all our great cities, slums and hotbeds of vice. It is
useless to deny their existence, or the many contrib-
uting factors in external life that supply them with
victims, the chief of which, perhaps, is the mental
and magnetic inharmony of the parents at their con-
ception. But even this is only a portion of the truth;
for the clairvoyant vision reveals the existence of
cities within cities, the lower astral world permeating
the physical. The inhabitants of these astral slums
'are usually as unconscious of the people of the physi-
cal world as the latter are of them; yet the desires of
the inhabitants of each realm react, through uncon-
scious thought impression, upon the other, and the
slums of the astral world stimulate the evil of exter-
nal life. In fact, it might be said that the external
slums are imitations of the inner hells to which they
correspond.
Initiation.-ln the soul's initiation Arcanum XVII
represents the attainment of divine illumination
through the perfect rapport of the soul and the
ego. The ego is not some mighty angelic power, but
344 THE SACRED TAROT
an eternal, scintillating atom of Deity, pure and in-
nocent, depending on the soul-monads which are the
positive and negative attributes of itself for knowl-
edge of external life. The soul-monad becomes closely
associated with the brain of man, and when the spir-
ituality is sufficiently active a conscious rapport is
established between this monad and its ego. This
brings the brain directly in touch with the soul's cen-
ter of deific life, enabling it to grasp the cosmic idea
and realize what portion of that idea it is progress-
ing to express. What God is the soul can never know,
but it does grasp its own relation to God, and this
truth leads it to freedom. This freedom is not that
of annihilation, or a dreamy nirvana, but the ability
through increased knowledge consciously to direct its
own progression in harmony with the laws of cosmic
evolution. Instead of being subject to the stars, it
rules them. This illumination brings the conscious
knowledge of its missing soul-mate.
Occult Sci$!nce.-Cosmic alchemy is the science of
transforming the energies of society as a whole into
those types of action that are most beneficial to it,
that most effectively assist the highest development
of its members, and that most completely cooperate
in the fulfillment of the divine plan.
Horseman Court Cards.-The Horsemen do not
represent people, but thoughts or unseen intelli-
gences. As thoughts are ruled by Arcanum I, each
Horseman has a numerical value of 1.
In divination they ·are read as thoughts or intelli-
gences that have an influence upon the life of the
CHRONOLOGY OF THE TAROT 345
client. The one who thinks the thoughts is indicated
by the Court Card nearest whom the Horseman is
found in the spread.
The Horseman of Scepters denotes thoughts con-
cerning business. Right way up, it indicates thoughts
advantageous to the client; reversed it signifies
thoughts opposed to his business interests.
The Horseman of Cups denotes thoughts of love
or affection. Right way up they are sincere and to
the client's advantage; reversed they indicate deceit
or opposition to the true affectional desires.
The Horseman of Coins denotes thoughts relating
to health or money. Right way up, they tend to the
prosperity of the client; reversed they are plots to
unfairly obtain money from him.
The Horseman of Swords denotes thoughts of en-
mity, strife or sickness. Right way up, it indicates
thoughts devoted to the defense and protection of
the client; reversed they are plans and desires for
his ruin.

Sh- 18 expresses in the spiritual world, the abyss
of the infinite.
In the intellectual world, the shadows which en-
velop the spirit when it has submitted itself to the
rule of the instincts.
In the physical world, deception and hidden
enemies.
Remember, then, son of eafth, that whosoever
braves the unknown, does so at his peril. Hostile
minds, figured by the black dog, will surround him
with ambushes; friendly, servile minds will offer him
flatteries; and treacherous minds, like unto the scor-
pion, will plan to attain their ends through his ruin.
If Arcanum XVIII should appear in the prophetic
signs of thy horoscope, observe and listen, but know
how to be silent.
In Divination, Arcanum XVIII is Deception, False
Friends, or Secret Foes.
Arcanum XVIII is figured by two pyramids at the
edge of a road. The Moon above, half obscured by
clouds, sheds a pale twilight. One of the pyramids,
symbol of the twelve houses of the horoscope, is
black, representing an ignorant and unspiritual life.
The other pyramid is white, symbolizing a life en-
lightened by science and spiritual wisdom. In front
of it is shown a door, or exit, indicating that those
thus enlightened are not earth-bound, but pass freely,
when their earthly life is completed, to a life in the
higher spheres.
In the road before the pyramids are two dogs, one
white and the other black; while between them, in a
CHRONOLOGY OF THE TAROT 347
circle of white, crawls a scorpion. This dim, moon-
light scene represents a seance room, the hidden
perils of which are more redoubtable than those to
be seen. The false radiance of the moon indicates
the glamor that surrounds such an occasion. The
good and the bad, the ignorant and the learned, sym-
bolized by the pyramids, are gathered there at the
edge of the road into the beyond. To such a place
there may be attracted lying spirits, as signified by
the black dog; friendly spirits, as denoted by the
white dog; or treacherous and dominating spirits
who have much knowledge, as indicated by the white
circle in which the scorpion moves, but who use it to
deceive arid attain their selfish ends.
Number.-Numerically, 18 is the 2nd decave of 9,
or wisdom polarized. Arcanum IX operating on the
plane-frequency of Arcanum II implies the explora-
tion of secret realms. Such exploration is not with-
out its perils, and should be attempted only by one
who has made marked spiritual advancement, or
under the guidance.of a competent master. Under
these conditions the negative and disintegrative
states are not permitted, and then 18 becomes True
Wisdom regarding the Science of Occultism.
Astrology.-Cancer is ruled by the Moon, and is
the zodiacal sign most susceptible to influences from
other planes, and most pronouncedly affected by its
associates and its environment. The mediumistic
quality correlates it to.Arcanum XVIII.
Human Function.-Cancer is the most interior
degree of emanation of the watery triplicity, and
348 THE SACRED TAROT
most readily receives and interprets the thoughts of
entities occupying the interior worlds. What appears
to be intuition often, with people born under this
sign, is in reality the prompting of a discarnate
entity. This ease of spirit communion corresponds
to Arcanum XVIII.
Alchemy.-The true elixir of life has the peculiar
power,of absorbing and transmitting the energies of
the surrounding magnetic atmosphere. If the elixir
is pure it absorbs and transmits only the finer, higher,
life-giving energies. But if impure, it attracts grosser
energies. Arcanum XVIII may represent either the
true elixir or the false elixir.
The majority who seek this fluid of eternal youth
fail to recognize the need for purity, or are unable to
discern whether or not the elixir is truly pure. They
thus prepare the draught by dissolving in the Water
of Pythia whatever metals may be at hand, without
precaution as to their purity and proper proportions.
They deceive themselves, and drinking the false
elixir thus prepared, are drugged into a semi-con-
scious state in which they are unable to perceive even
the approach of their own ruin.
Bible.-Saul, in his extremity, consulted a medium
at Endor. Sam. 28 :8; "And he said, I pray thee
divine unto me by the familiar spirit, and bring up
whom I shall name unto thee."
The power of spirits to obsess is mentioned as a
matter of course in Math. 10:1; "And when he had
called unto him his twelve · disciples he gave them
power against unclean spirits, to cast them out."
CHRONOLOGY OF THE TAROT 349
Paul speaks of deceiving spirits, I Tim. 4:1; "Now
the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times
some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to
seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils; speaking
lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with
a hot iron: Forbidding to-marry, and commanding to
abstain from meats."
Masonry.- The degree of Initiate Secretary is .
based upon Arcanum XVIII. Its lower aspect is the
spy who listens at the veil and is captured, con-
demned by Hiram King of Tyre, and finally freed
through the intercession of King Solomon. Its higher
aspect represents that eminent saint, John the Bap-
tist, to whom modern Masons dedicate their lodge;
for the sun is baptised in the Holy Ghost when it
enters the watery sign Cancer and reaches the high-
est, and symbolically the most spiritual, point in its
annual journey.
Magic.-Arcanum XVIII explains the process of
mediumship. The passive ever becomes the medium
of the active, hence matter is the medium for the ex-
pression of mind. Broadly speaking, in the sense
that it receives and transmits force, everything is
mediumistic. Because the energies of the interior
planes are more active than those external, the physi-
cal is mediumistic to the astral, and thus astrological
forces influence the life of the material world.
Carrying the same thought further, the astral
world must be passive to, and the medium of, ener-
gies from the spiritual world. Thus may we consider
God as the great central controlling spiritual force
350 THE SACRED TAROT
of the universe, and that from Him down to the
densest mineral atom there is a complete, graded
scale of mediumship; each higher plane transmitting
the One Universal Force to the plane next below,
until finally it reaches and energizes the lowest realm.
Even the adept is but the medium for the expres-
sion of spiritual ideas upon the physical plane. The
spiritual truths externalizing in his life are taught by
schools on the interior planes and subsequently veri-
fied by his own experiences. The true adept never
claims to originate the teachings he gives out; for he
recognizes the fact that whatever truth man grasps
on the physical plane is due to his reception of it
from exalted souls whose interior plane of life en-
ables them to dispel illusion. The truth these exalted
beings realize is transmitted to them from still more
interior worlds, and so on, to the very throne of
God, Who is the absolute source of all truth. But
there is a great difference between such conscious and
controllable mediumship and that of the person who
trusts to some controlling spirit guide, or permits a
discarnate entity to use his body as a means of
communication.
In the first place it should be understood that un-
der proper conditions it is possible, and frequently
happens, that people who have crossed the boundary
of physical life do return and talk with their loved
ones through the organism of some medium. But the
soul-world closest to earth is the lower astral, in
which dwell earth-bound souls, vicious elementals,
depraved elementaries, and a host of other entities,
some of which are harmlessly mischievous, some of
CHRONOLOGY OF THE TAROT 351
which are inimical to man, and some of whom desire
to use him for their own ends. To abdicate the ruler-
ship of the body in favor of whatever unseen entity
happens to be present, and that may claim to be any-
thing that suits its purpose, is to court the domina-
tion of the soul by entities which may use their
advantage to deceive, demoralize, obsess; and which
always weaken the will.
Of all places, the public seance room seems to be
one least likely to furnish anything of value, for the
mixture of the thoughts and magnetisms attracts all
sorts of questionable entities. Such conditions favor
physical manifestations; for the beings responsible
for them belong to the realm of force. Where the
electromagnetic energy is present, phenomena can be
furnished through an irresponsible medium as readily
and as genuinely as can he produced by an adept.
But the mediums can not control them.
Much psychical phenomena is faked, because the
genuine is so great a drain on the medium that he can
not generate the force to produce it often. Yet he
feels that he must keep his patronage at any cost.
Irresponsible mediumship is fraught with great peril.
lnitiation.-ln the soul's pilgrimage Arcanum
XVIII denotes the neophyte's work in the astral,
freeing earth-bound souls from their fetters, assist-
ing those deceived to realize their errors, and en-
couraging them to strive for a new and better life.
Occult Science.-Mediumship is the science of re-
ception and transmission, embracing the law of
affinity and its application in the production of
phenomena.

Spread of 36.-This spread is used to give a gen-
eral reading of conditions and events. After the cus-
tomary preparatory shuffling and cutting, the cards
are dealt one at a time face downward in a square
of 36, starting at the bottom right-hand corner.
To read this spread, turn the cards over, from top
to bottom, one at a time, in the order of their se-
quence as given in the diagram on the frontispiece.
Read each card as it is turned either as something
conditioning the card just preceding it, or as a subse-
quent event, as the case may be.
The bottom row represents the past, the next row

THE MAGIC SEVEN SPREAD
THE SOLUTION OF ANCIENT CYCLES
HAVE designated under Arcanum VII
that completion and perfection of form,
in so far as the three-dimensional plane is
concerned, is expressed by the number 7,
and under Arcanum IX that the number
of astral manifestation is exemplified by the number
9. We are now ready, therefore, to apply these two
numbers to the law of cycles.
The cycles man can understand pertain to the
physical plane and to the astral plane. He should
first, of course, have some knowledge of the com-
pletion pf form as seen on the physical plane, such
as is to be found, for instance, in the septenary
grouping of chemical elements. And for this pur-
pose the number 7 is a valuable tool. But behind all
such physical expression is the realm of ideas, the
realm of astrological vibration$, the realm of the
character-vibrations of things. And for the purpose
of investigating this inner-plane region, the number
9 should be employed to aid the understanding.
Man, formatively considered, for instance, pos-
sesses a sevenfold constitution. Yet viewed from a
higher scale, his interior potencies are not properly
manifested until he has developed two additional
factors, which we call reason and intuition. This

tor to the outer-plane 7 gives us the inner-plane view-
point, in which 9 aids the proper explanation.
Or, let us say, the 7 colors of the spectrum give
formative expression to light on the earth-plane. But
to understand the more essential nature of light, its
inner-plane relations must be included. Black and
white, the polar opposites, must be added to the
physical 7, to get the necessary inner-plane compre-
hension.
The chemical properties of an element, to con-
sider matter, are subject to the same law, being a
periodic function of its atomic weight. But to reveal
the thought-quality of the element it must be con-
sidered also as possessing a positive and negative,
bringing the factors up to 9.
Yet as 10 is the cyclic number, the orbit of the
cycles based either on 7 or 9, or both, expand and
contract in this manner: Ideal. cydes, those which
measure intellectual and spiritual force, are solved
by applying number 9. Practical cycles, which mea-
sure magnetic and vital force and the planes of mani-
festation, are unlocked by number 7. 10 closes the
cycle. And by using 7 and 9 in connection with the
cyclic number, 10, it is possible to solve every cycle
in nature below the spiritual plane, from the intra-
atomic cycle of the electron up to the orbital move-
ment of a universe.
Why are there 360 degrees in a circle? We can
not say it is merely chance. A circle is obviously a
cycle, therefore embraces the number 10. It is also
in nature the measure of intellectual and spiritual
360 THE SACRED TAROT
force, as can be observed in the study of orbital mo-
tions either of planets or of atoms.
Such orbits always express through four phases,
which are well recognized in the moon's orbit as its
four quarters, and in the earth's orbit as the four
seasons, bu~ are none the less present in all orbital
motion. Therefore an orbit, or circle, is the cyclic
number 10 multiplied by 4, or Realization (Arcanum
IV), giving 40, which indicates any cycle as measur-
.ing the Realization of effort.
This number 40, which is the number of Minor
Arcana of the tarot, explains all reference to 40 in
the Bible as periods in which Realization was accom-
plished.
But an orbit, as a measure of ideals, or intellec-
tuality and spirituality, is a function of the inner-
plane number 9. 9 evolved to the 40th decave is 360,
meaning Wisdom (9) Realized (4) in a cycle ( 10).
Thus it is that any point on the earth's surface pass-
ing through 360 degrees, or a day and night, is a
measure of intellectual and spiritual force as applied
to those born at different hours. It causes them to
express, not merely the mental activity and repose
which humanity at large does each 24 hours, but
different Personalities.
In expressing cycles in terms of time, round num-
bers are used because often there are variable fac-
tors, such as are spoken of in connection with the
no-numbered Arcanum of the tarot. The most ap-
parent of these variations is that the relation of the
Day to the Year is not exactly 1 to 360, but 1 to
365 74.
SOLUTION OF ANCIENT CYCLES 361
There is a good reason for this, but suffice it here
to point out that the ancients overcame this discrep-
ancy by making their year mea$ure 360 days, and
then at the winter solstice cutting out 5 days. Those
five "Dies Non" were given over to festivity and
were not counted in their calendar. The year, or
orbital motion of the earth through 360 (3 plus 6
plus 0 equal 9) degrees, measures to humanity at
large not only the variation in light and heat, but the
quality of mental and spiritual influx. People born
at different times of the year thus express different
Individualities.
Furthermore, the yearly return of the Sun by tran-
sit over its place in the birth-chart is the measure of
spiritual energy received by individual man.
Now if we wish to find the operation of the prac-
tical forces in life, we divide the number of days in
the year by 7. This gives us 52 weeks. As 5 plus 2
equals 7, we know these weeks relate to practical
affairs rather than to spiritual influences. And as
a matter of fact, man regulates his physical existence
by a week of 7 days.
The Moon, as it passes through the zodiac, by its
phases, or relations to the Sun, measures out to man
the magnetic expansion and contraction which govern
intellectual activity. This cycle is a little more than
29 days. 2 plus 9 equals 11, therefore the 4 quarters
of the Moon measure the Realization of Magnetic
Force (Arcanum XI), the practical operation of
which depends upon each phase of the Moon of a
little more than 7 days. People born with the Moon
362 THE SACRED TAROT
in different parts of its orbit have different kinds of
capacities.
But there is another cycle of the Moon of greater
import to the Soul of man. It is the cycle of a little
over 27 days during which the Moon traverses 360
degrees of the zodiac. 2 plus 7 equals 9, therefore
this cycle relates to intellectual and spiritual forces,
and we find actually that this cycle of the Moon
from one transit of the Sun to another such transit
in the birth-chart, measures the germination of spir-
itual powers and psychic possibilities.
By virtue of the function of 9, the movements in
the heavens during the earth's diurnal motion
through 360 degrees measures out the Major events
of life to man while the earth moves in its orbit 360
degrees. And the Moon's orbital motion of 360
degrees measures out to man the Minor Events oc-
curring during the earth's orbital motion of 360 de-
grees. In other words, in natal astrology, whose
influences come from the inner plane, the chief events
of life are measured to man at the rate of a day for
a year, and the minor events of life at the rate of a
month for a year; both measures being functions of
the number 9.
The Equinox is observed to move at the rate of 1
degree in 72 years (7 plus 2 equal 9). This makes
the place of the Sun at the beginning of the· astro-
nomical year appear to retrograde through the zo-
diac 1 degree in 72 years, or through 360 degrees,
completing the circle in about 72 x 360 equal 25,920
years. 25,868 to be exact. This period measures
SOLUTION OF ANCIENT CYCLES 363
unto man all the different mental and spiritual forces
possible during one Precessional Cycle.
This cycle of 360 degrees is .divided by 12 into
sections corresponding to the zodiacal signs, each
section containing 30 degrees. Divide 25,868 by 12,
and we get 2,156 years as the duration of one sub-
cycle, or Age, as it is called. The equinox passes
through the 30 degrees corresponding to each zo-
diacal sign, and this gives rise to the Age of that
sign. It is the measure of the intellectual and spir-
itual force received by humanity, and determines its
general trend.
The equinox, or place of the Sun at the beginning
of the astronomical year, retrograded by "Preces-
sion" back from the first of constellated ·Aries, which
is the beginning of the circle of stars, 30 degrees,
and therefore into the space corresponding to the
sign Aquarius, in 1881. The exact date is January
19, 1881. The chart for the hour and minute as well
as the date, and a discussion of it, are given in Astro-
logical Lore of All Ages. This is the time of the
commencement of the Aquarian Age, and because the
mental and spiritual force received by humanity is
different when the Sun's place among the stars at the
beginning of the year corresponds to the place of
different zodiacal signs, the student can get some idea
of the type of civilization that, past or future, exis~s
while the equinox is in any sign by multiplying 2,156
years by the number of signs removed from Aquarius,
and adding to or subtracting from, the year 1881.
History thus records that during the time the
Equinox moves by Precession through each sign there
364 THE SACRED TAROT
is also a change in the practical trend of the mental
force and dominant interest about every 308 years.
That is, the movement of the equinox through one
sign is divided into seven equal periods, the number
7 signifying this formative trend. The duration of
this period within the Sub-Precessional Cycle is ob-
tained by dividing 2,156 years by 7, the result being
308 years.
Each of these formative periods is apparently
under dominion of one of the seven planets.
The Equinox always backs into a sign, entering the
end of the 30th degree and moving back to 29, 28
and so on. And by reference to historical events we
find that the first period after the Equinox enters a
sign precessionally is ruled by the Sun, that the next
period is ruled by Venus, the next by Mercury, then
the Moon, Saturn, Jupiter and finally Mars as the
last period in any sign. Anyone conversant with his-
tory can verify the influence of these periods.
From this information, which was first given out
by Abbot Trithemius, it is possible to determine in a
general way the trend of the intellectual forces as
practically -
applied during any period of 308 years,
past or future. If the period was ruled by the Sun
the energies were applied to the aggrandizement of
State or Empire; if by Mars, they were devoted to
mechanics and war; if by the Moon, it was a period
of intellectual slumber; if by Venus, the energies
were given over to art and luxury; if by Mercury, to
intellectual culture; if by Saturn, to subtlety and
superstition; if by Jupiter, to expansion and benev-
olence. The Sun started his rule of 308 years on
SOLUTION OF ANCIENT CYCLES 365
December 23, 1880. Mars ceased to rule Dec. 21,
1880. Or, to be more precise, the solstice of 1880
in December is the point of reckoning from which
the student can trace the influence of these periods
either forward or backward.
Now we come to a very interesting theory which
probably has no valuable practical application. That
the obliquity of the ecliptic is constantly changing
was observed by ancients as well as by moderns.
That is, the Pole of the earth is moving in an orbit
at right angles to the earth's diurnal rotation at the
rate of about 1 second every 2 years, or 1 degree in
7,200 years. If, therefore, the earth should continue
this motion it would turn completely polarwise in
7,200 x 360 equal 2,592,000 years. And as turning
around completely equatorwise is called one common
day, so turning completely around polarwise is called
one polar day.
According to modern astronomers, however, the
earth does not thus turn completely over polarwise,
but after moving through 3 or 4 degrees starts to
swing back, according to known laws, which cause it
thus to wabble. But because the time involved to
observe this swinging back was so great some an-
cient concluded this polarwise motion continued uni-
formly on around the circle, and he based his larger
periods of duration on this false Polar Day of
2,592,000 years. The days of creation mentioned in
Genesis refer to these Polar Days of immense du-
ration.
The Polar Day was known in Egypt, and its dura-
tion is incorporated in the Great Pyramid; although
366 THE SACRED TAROT
just because the amount of average movement of the
earth Polarwise is included in this monument does
not warrant us to conclude that they believed the
earth thus completely to tum over, as this movement
over a few degrees, even though it swings back, is
really one of the most important astronomical move-
ments, having profound effects upon the climate and
other matters on the earth. And it is this average
movement of 1 degree in 7,200 years which the pyra-
mid records.
It should be understood that there is both geo-
logical evidence and arch~ological evidence as well
as modem knowledge of astronomical movements
which all indicate that the earth does not turn over
Polarwise and that the races which have been as-
sumed to exist never have existed on the earth in
physical forms. But because the theory was devel-
oped to a fine degree in India, and is the basis of the
various sacred cycles there recorded, as well as be-
ing linked up with their accounts of races which once
inhabited the globe, it is valuable to know it, even as
a theory which modern science seems completely to
have refuted.
The theory is that the Polar Day is the exact dura-
tion of the life-wave on the earth, and that this is the
average time of the life on each planet. Therefore
for the life-wave to travel once around the chain of
7 planets, and thus give formative expression to and
develop 1 Round of Humanity, containing 7 Root-
Races, takes 7 x 2,592,000 equal 18,144,000 years.
Then to produce 7 Rounds of humanity requires 7 x
18,144,000 equal 127,008,000 years or 49 Polar
SOLUTION OF ANCIENT CYCLES 367
Days. Then comes the Jubilee of Nirvana during
which Nature sleeps for 7 Polar Days while the
life-wave goes once around the septenary chain.
Then, according to this Eastern theory which
archreology quickly disproves, commences the Sec-
ond Series, and the 7 Families, or Rounds of 7 Root-
Races, each ascending to Angelic Spheres to become
the parents and Guardians of the new series of
humanity.
The number 360 was used by the ancients of the
East to veil their sacred cycles, 360 Common Years
being called One Divine Year. The Hindus, in their
studies, also made use of the cyclic number 10. Thus
we are informed that the Divine Maha Yug is com-
posed of 10 Great Ages or Cali Yugs. A Cali Yug
is 1,200 Divine Years, or 360 x 1,200 equal 432,000
common years, during which the earth's pole, accord-
ing to their theory of polar motion, was supposed to
pass over 1/6 of its orbit of 2,592,000 years, mak-
ing the sextile aspect to its own place.
A Dwaper Yug is two Cali Yugs, or 2,400 Divine
Years, or 8,64,000 common years, during which the
pole is supposed to pass over 1/ 3 of its orbit, making
the trine aspect to its original place. A Treta Yug
is 3 Cali Yugs, or 3,600 Divine Years, or 1,296,000
common years, during which the earth's pole was
supposed to pass over 0 of its orbit, making the
opposition to its original place. A Satya Yug, ac-
cording to these Hindu cycles, is 4 Cali Yugs, or
4,800 Divine Years, or 1,728,000 common years,
during which the earth's pole is supposed to pass
368 THE SACRED TAROT
over 2/ 3 of its orbit, making the second trine to its
original place.
Furthermore, a Maha Yug is composed of 1 Cali
Yug plus 1 Dwaper Yug plus 1 Treta Yug plus 1
Satya Yug, or the equivalent of 10 Cali Yugs, 12,000
Divine Years, or 4,320,000 years, during which, ac-
cording to the Hindu theory, the earth's pole is sup-
posed to pass 1 2/3 times around its orbit. A Maha
Yug is thus composed of 4 aspects bearing the rela-
tion 1-2-3-4 to each other, completing the numbe·r 10.
And a Man wantares is 1,000 times 1 Maha Yug,
during which portion of the Great Kalpa the plan-
etary chain has been disintegrated and reorganized
several times.
In some sense, for tradition so wide spread is sel-
dom without adequate foundation, there doubtless
was a Golden, Silver, Copper and Iron age. Astro-
logical influx combined with climatic conditions at
some time in the dim past of the world. We are not
justified, however, in believing these ages were de-
pendent in the strict sense upon the hypothetical
Polar Day. Yet an account of this theoretical link-
ing up, as derived from Hindu sources, is not devoid
of interest.
It was supposed that these ages referred only to
the first Round of humanity, and as a matter of
scientific fact, the evidence all points that humanity
has not been upon the earth longer than the periods
embraced within one or two Polar Days. But it is
supposed, according to the theory, that these ages
recur again as the life-wave leaves the planet, <level-
SOLUTION OF ANCIENT CYCLES 369
oping the highest states of the round, although they
are not strictly called by the same names.
It was supposed that with the pole at right angles
to the ecliptic, or sun's path, there was an ideal cli-
mate in the temperate zones, and that the climate
does not become excessively severe until the pole
moves through 4 x 9 equal 36 degrees. As the pole
moves through 1 degree in 7,200 years, this period
of the Golden Age was supposed to have lasted 36 x
7,200 equals 259,200 years. Then while the pole
passed through 3 x 9 equal 27 degrees, giving the
Sun a maximum declination of from 36 to 63 de-
grees, there were hot long days in summer and cold
long nights in winter. This Silver Age lasted 27 x
7,200 equal 194,400 years. While the pole passed
through 2 x 9 equal 18 degrees, the Tropics reached
an angle of from 63 to 81 degrees, and there were
tropical summers and arctic winters on all portions
of the globe. This Copper Age is supposed thus to
have lasted 18 x 7,200 equal 129,600 years.
Then while the pole was passing through 1 x 9
equal 9 degrees, the Sun was approaching its vertical
position once a year to both North and South Poles,
and the climatic conditions were frightful. This Iron
Age was supposed to have lasted 9 x 7,200 years or
64,800 years. These 4 Ages, related to each other by
this theory as 1-2-3-4, are embraced in the time the
Pole passed over one quadrant of 10 x 9 degrees, or
90 x 7,200 equal 648,000 years. And according to
this Eastern theory the place in evolution of our
present Great Western Race is that of one branch of
the Fifth Root-Race of the 4th Round of Evolution.
370 THE SACRED TAROT
Not ·the slightest evidence has been found to date
that man existed on the earth so long ago as is thus
implied. The records in the rocks indicate that one
round of 18,144,000 years ago takes back to the end
of the Oligocene Period of Geology, in which horses
were the size of coyotes with three toes in front and
three behind, camels were the size of sheep, bison,
deer and the ox were small hoofed mammals, dogs
were soon to develop to the size of bears, and the
claws were developing on what later became lions,
tigers and cats. And if we go back 4 such rounds,
geology indicates there were no mammals, that it
was a time when reptiles dominated the earth, and
the first primitive birds, and the marsupials, fore-
runners of the mammals, were just developing. Or,
if we wish to call the little rat-size marsupials mam-
mals, which later they developed into, we can say
they were beginning to develop along the lines we
now recognize as mammals, about 4 such rounds ago.
But if we consider the length of time covered by
the Golden, Silver, Copper and Iron Age, that is,
648,000 years, there is plenty of evidence that man
was on earth that long ago. Also that the earth once
had, but not due to polar motion, a mild and fruit-
ful climate, followed by increasing cold, which about
a million years ago ushered in an ice age, with inter-
vals of warmth for thousands of years, followed by
more glaciers. Racial memory undoubtedly preserves
a consciousness of times which were mild and bounti-
ful, followed by times in which there was tremendous
cold and hardship. Eden on earth, and the Age of
Horrors are dreams which record actual conditions
SOLUTION OF ANCIENT CYCLES 371
that transpired since men are known to have in-
habited the earth.
The Sun.-Arcanum XIX. Letter: Egyptian,
Quitolath; Hebrew, Quoph; English, Q. Number,

John's wort, mistletoe, pimpernel, parsley and gar-
den mint. Mineral, the talismanic gem ruby, and
such stones as the chrysolite, hyacinth and soft yel-
low minerals.
Q-19 expresses in the spiritual world, the su-
preme heaven.
In the intellectual world, true happiness.
In the physical world, sacred union.
Remember, then, son of earth, that the light of
the mysteries is a redoubtable fluid, put by nature at
the service of the will. She lights those who know
how to direct her; she strikes down with a thunder-
bolt those who ignore her power or who abuse it. If
Arcanum XIX should appear in the prophetic signs
of th/ horoscope, happiness awaits thee in domestic
life i thou knowest how to strengthen the conjugal
circle and guard its sacredness in the sanctuary of
the heart.
In divination, Arcanum XIX may be read as Hap-
piness and Joy.
372 THE SACRED TAROT
Arcanum XIX is figured by a young man and a
young w~man holding each othe~ by the hand. About
them a circle of 20 flowers sprmgs from the earth.
Above is a radiant Sun of 21 rays, in the center of
which is the symbol of conjugal union. This sun is
the symbol of perfect union expressed on all three
, planes; perfect harmony of physical desires, intellec-
tual interests, and spiritual aspirations.
The young man and woman are plainly dressed,
indicating simplicity of life, moderation of desires
and purity of thought. The flowers springing up
about them symbolize the joy and happiness of the
domestic circle which more than compensate them
for material hardships. The 20 flowers signify the
potency of domestic harmony to Awaken and Resur-
rect the spiritual flora of the soul.
This ensemble personifies the fact that when the
sexes are truly wed, and the triple laws of harmony
are obeyed, that their lives are a constant round of
happiness and joy, even amid adversities and priva-
tion.
Number.-Numerically, 19 is the third decave of
1; or Arcanum I, Creative Energy, operating on
the plane of Arcanum III, or Marriage. Conse-
qqently, Arcanum XIX is the application of the
Divine Fire, controlled by Will and Intelligence, to
the elaboration of domestic bliss. It is not only the
perfect nuptial union of 7, but denotes added Sacrifice
and Devotion (7 plus 12 equal 19) .
It may, or may not, indicate the union of soul-
mates. But it certainly indicates the union of souls
harmonious on all planes, not merely for the purpose
SOLUTION OF ANCIENT CYCLES 373
of spiritual advancement, but also for the production
and rearing of children and to experience the joy of
a home. Yet in fact, the harmonious vibrations set
in motion, and the sacrifices necessary in the rearing
of offspring, are most potent factors in developing
the spiritual nature.
Astrology.-Astrologically, the house governing
pleasure, joy, happiness, children and love affairs,
is ruled by the zodiacal sign Leo. Leo governs the
heart and its sympathies. It is the significator of
such love as springs unselfishly into existence as the
result of natural harmony, rather than the artificial
marriages that today are all too common, which are
prompted by material advantages. This "Lion of
the house of Juda," as it is called in Revelation, cor-
responds to Arcanum XIX.
Human Function.-Inspiration ~eans the indraw-
ing of the spirit. The source of all life and energy
and spiritual power is the Sun, and He is the true
source of inspiration. Leo is the home of the Sun,
the heart center of man through which the Sun
exerts its strongest inspirational power. Leo, there-
fore, corresponds to the capacity to receive inspira-
tion. Love, which is ruled by Leo, is acknowledged
to be the power which opens the inspirational gates.
This is symbolized by the Sun overshadowing the
lovers in Arcanum XIX.
Alchemy.-ln alchemy, Arcanum XIX represents
the quaffing of the true Elixir of Life. This does
not bring instantaneous perpetual youth, for per-
petual youth is the result of the gradual changes
which the Elixir sets up in the finer forms.
374 THE SACRED TAROT
This Elixir is really a love potion, and the result
of quaffing it is a general and complete harmonizing
of all the internal vibratory rates, so that they sound
a sweet and powerful chord, the pitch of which
gradually rises as the body and desires are refined,
and in time thus results in youthful vigor added to
perpetual life.
Bible.-In the Bible, Arcanum XIX represents the
increase of oil by Elisha: 2 Kings, 4 :6. "And it
came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she
said unto her son, Bring me yet a vessel." Again in
Kings 2nd, 4:17; '"And the woman conceived, and
bare a son at that season that Elisha had said unto
her, according to the time of life."
In tpe New Testament we find, Math. 5:9, "Bles-
sed are the peacemakers; for they shall be called the
children of God." And Rev. 22 :17, "And the Spirit
and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth
say, Come. And let him that is athirst, Come: and
whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely."
Masonry.-ln Masonry, Arcanum XIX is the
basis of the Intendant of the Building degree in
which the vacancy left by Hiram, the lost soul-mate,
is filled. As the third decave, or marriage function
of the creative 1, it is mentioned in the first Masonic
degree: "Behold how good and how pleasant it is
for the brethren to dwell together in unity I etc."
Furthermore, Arcanum XIX is the Lion's paw grip
by which Hiram Abiff is finally raised.
Magic.-ln Magic, Arcanum XIX represents the
sanctity of the home circle, within the protection of
SOLUTION OF ANCIENT CYCLES 375
which, when it is harmonious and pure,· there is ut-
most safety from any and all forces of evil.
Where there is complete harmony, the forces of
discord, and all evil trends to discord, can not intrude.
The harmony between two who love devoutly is re-
pellant to pernicious thoughts and pernicious entities.
It is a hallowed circle of invisible influence which
they can not penet.rate.
For this reason, and because the unselfish feelings
developed in the rearing and care of children tend
powerfully to raise the dominant vibratory-rates far
above any which can be reached or influenced by
pernicious entities, these do their utmost to discour-
age domestic life and the rearing of children.
It is even taught in some quarters that a woman
who bears children forfeits her chance of spiritual
attainment in this life; and not until she reincarnates
again and lives a non-child-bearing life can she ex-
pect to make much spiritual progress.
This is patently an inversion of the real truth;
because spiritual progress depends upon love, unsel-
fishness, and the refinement of the thoughts and
emotions, and nothing develops these soul qualities
faster than the love and care of a parent for children.
The love of parents for their offspring is often the
saving grace of their lives, keeping the inward affec-
tional fires burning, whose warmth transmitted to
the soul, keeps it from sinking into the icy death of
self-centeredness.
The bearing of children on earth corresponds to
sacred functions in the spiritual world. And while it
376 THE SACRED TAROT
is true that economic conditions, as well as pro-
nounced discords in the fifth house of the birth-chart,
may be severe enough that it is the wiser course not
to bring children into the world, as they could not be
given proper support and proper vigorous bodies,
yet such conditions contravene nature, and occasion
the loss of valuable experience to the soul.
The very fact that childlessness is always indi-
cated in a birth-chart by severe discords, shows that
such a condition is in the nature of an affliction rather
than a benefit. Such a childless life can only be com-
pensated for, in its effect upon the soul, by some
marked and continuous effort, to benefit and care for
some section of mankind, or some work for mankind
as a whole.
There is a great amount of foolishness taught con-
cerning the possibilities of eugenics. In order that
men should profit as does domestic stock, through
proper breeding for results, it would be necessary
to place a practical breeder in charge of the whole
human race, with the power to prevent the mating of
all humans except a few superior individuals whom
he would select, and to be able to compel the union
of any man and woman, regardless of their desires
in the matt~r. Such power, which is the secret of a
stock-breeder's success, is not likely to be given any
man.
It is possible, within limits, however, to select the
birth-chart of a child and thus determine many of the
characteristics which the child shall possess. It is
possible, also, through proper environment, to en-
courage characteristics which otherwise would not
SOLUTION OF ANCIENT CYCLES 377
develop. And the ancient magi believed that an ideal
image of characteristics of the future child, held by
both parents before and at the time of conception
had a powerful effect in determining the kind of soul
attracted to the form thus conceived. They held also,
as elaborated in Course IV, that the mental plane in
general of the parents, as indicated by their daily
thoughts, and their harmony or discord in relation
to each other, had a still further influence in shaping
the destiny of the future child.
lnitiation.-ln the soul's pilgrimage Arcanum
XIX represents the reunion of true soul-mates into
a single soul-mate system. So far as common require-
ments are concerned the marriage of harmonious
souls is sufficient to afford those harmonies which aid
spiritual progress. And, because this inner union is
of spiritual bodies, only the few are highly enough
developed to recognize it when it does take place.
The majority mistake magnetic affinity for this inner
blend, and consequently all too many discard one
partner for another in the belief that the soul-mate
has been found.
This is a deplorable situation, hut does not miti-
gate against such relations when they exist in truth.
In fact, this abuse is just another inversion of some-
thing holy to gratify sensuality.
The real union of soul-mates, to which Arcanum
XIX corresponds, is purely spiritual, and does not
of necessity require carnal contact. The blend may
even take place in the spaces while the individuals
are asleep, all, or nearly all recollection of it often
vanishing when they awaken. Yet once this bond is
378 THE SACRED TAROT
formed, its power is never lost, and ultimately the
two become conscious of the bond, either in this
world or the next, and they begin to function then
as a single system.
Occult Science.-Organic alchemy is the science
which embraces all life-forms in the universe, and
the changes in their characters which are produced
by their experiences, and the processes by which they
develop along special lines, each to become a valu-
able function in the body of the universal organism.
Such processes are indicated as taking place by Ar-
canum XIX.
The Sarcophagus.-Arcanum XX. Letter: Egyp-
tian, Rasith; Hebrew, Resh; English, R. Num-
ber, 20. Astrologically, the Moon. Color, green.
Tone, F. Occult science, the next life. Human func-
tion, the Divine Soul. Natural ·remedy, hydro-ther-
apy. Mineral, the metal silver.
R-20 expresses in the spiritual world, the im-
mortality of the soul.
.In the intellectual world, the judgment of con-
science.
In the physical world, unexpected elevation.
Remember, then, son of earth, that all fortune is
changeable, even that which appears most stable.
The ascension of the soul is the fruit that it should
draw from its successive trials. Hope in suffering,
but mistrust thyself in prosperity. If Arcanum XX
should appear in the prophetic signs of thy horo-
scope, fall not asleep, either in idleness or forgetful-
ness; for thou hast a mission to accomplish which
SOLUTION OF ANCIENT CYCLES 379
providence will reveal when thou art prepared to
receive it.
In Divination, Arcanum XX may be read as an
Awakening or Resurrection.
Arcanum XX is figured by a sarcophagus on
whose side is pictured a scarab. Above this tomb a
genie sounds a trumpet, whereupon it opens and a
man, woman and child rise from it, still dressed in
their winding sheets.
The sarcophagus is the tomb through which man
ascends to a higher life. The scarab -is symbol of the
immortality of the soul. The genie blowing t~e trum-
pet is the call to ascend to higher spheres. A man,
woman and child arise together to indicate that im-
mortality depends upon the trinity of positive and
negative soul-monads united about their Deific ego.
The innocence of the ego is represented by the child.
The real tomb is the physical body which confines
and envelops the soul while it develops its powers
through the functions of social life; its relations to
other life-forms. After one life in human form it has
acquired self-consciousness and has no need to return
to earth. As indicated by the trinity rising from the
grave, there are opportunities for family life and
other experiences on the next plane, the total en-
semble symbolizing this entering into a new and
active life in a realm above matter.
Number.-Numerically, 20 is the third decave of
2, and thus represents Arcanum II operating on the
plane of Arcanum III, occult science manifesting in
marriage. In the King's chamber of the Great Pyra-
380 THE SACRED TAROT
mid in Egypt is found a lidless sarcophagus, symbol-
izing the soul's Bight out of matter, and out of the
physical body ; but significant enough, no sarcoph-
agus is found in the Queen's chamber, for those
who devised this great monument of occult science
recognized that man and woman were but the two
immortal portions of one Deific spiritual ego.
Astrology.-The Moon governs all periods of
gestation, and is the magnetic mother of all life.
Life on earth, in a physical body, is but the period of
gestation which precedes a more vivid and active life
in higher-dimensional realms. The Moon thus cor-
responds to Arcanum XX.
Human Function.- The ego is a spiritual spark
of Deity, and as such is eternal; but the soul alone is
immortal. What the Moon is to the Sun, that the
soul is to the ego. It is the divine soul which, having
evolved through countless life-forms, attains self-
conscious immortality, Its effort in this direction is
shown in Arcanum XX.
Alchemy.-ln alchemy, Arcanum XX represents
the Consciousness of the changes in himself, or the
changes in other things, as the case may require, that
take place as the transmutations proceed. It is the
recognition of the new vibratory rates.
Bible.-The trinity rising from the sarcophagus
of Arcanum XX is referred to in J oho 21 :14; "This
is now the third time that Jesus showed himself to
his disciples, after He was risen from the dead."
Then Luke 24 :51 ; "And it came to pass while he
blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried
SOLUTION OF ANCIENT CYCLES 381
up into heaven." Such ascensions are mentioned still
further in Rev. 20 :6; "Blessed and holy is he that
h~th part in the first resurrection: on such the second
death hath no power."
This signifies that those who attain adeptship, and
in the process build a spiritual form, not only volun-
tarily translate to the inner plane when life's work is
over, but that, instead of requiring still more ardu-
ous experience in the astral realms, they move at
once to sojourn on the spiritual plane, thus escaping
the so-called second death. Voluntary ascension is
plainly indicated for both Elijah and Jesus, and may
be inferred for M,0ses; Deut. 34-6; "But no man
knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day. And Moses
was an hundred and twenty years old when he died;
his eye ~as not dim, nor his natural forces abated."
The birth into the next life may be accidental,
natural, or surgical, depending on the circumstances.
The natural method is that indicated in the lives of
Jesus, Elijah, Moses and certain of the Indian tribes-
men of the North. That is, they go voluntarily, and
need no assistance from others on either plane.
The accidental method of birth into the next life
occurs frequently on the field of battle, in sudden
accidents, where there are explosions, and other
places in which the death of the physical comes with-
out warning and with considerable shock. In such
cases not infrequently the individual does not realize
for some time, that he is dead. These cases, how-
ever, which represent a temporary inability to make
the proper adjustment to the inner plane, are not
382 THE SACRED TAROT
the same as those in which, through the strong
and unbreakable attachment to some earthly thing
the individual is earthbound: Rev. 20 :5; "But the
rest of the dead lived not again until a thousand years
were finished."
Masonry.-ln Masonry, Arcanum XX is the basis
of the Perfect Master degree. It is symbolized by
the sprig of cassia, sign of immortality, that was
found on the grave of Hiram Abiff. Still more is it
exemplified by the coffin with a five-point star on the
lid, and leaning over it the immortal sprig of cassia.
In the ritual of raising Hiram Abiff from the
grave, there are three attempts made, as signified by
the three persons rising from the tomb of Arcanum
XX. The first two efforts are unsuccessful; and the
resurrection is finally accomplished only when the
soul-union method of the Lion's paw grip of Ar-
canum XIX is employed.
Magic.-In many magical practices the assistance
of those who have once lived on earth is invoked.
More commonly than not those who control mediums
are, or pretend to be, those who have once lived on
earth.
It is true that a medium can tune in on a thought-
form, or record left in the astral substance about our
planet, so thoroughly as to be dominated by it. This
is especially true of thought-forms to which, through
mental magic, elemental life-forms have been at-
tached. More commonly, however, mediums are
actually controlled by those who once lived on earth,
or they tune in on the thoughts and desires emanat-
SOLUTION OF ANCIENT CYCLES 383
ing from the unconscious minds of those in their
circle.
The electromagnetic body of a person never moves
far from the corpse after physical death, and it has
no intelligence, or special power that can he utilized.
The astral body of an individual can only be used
through control of it, and an astral body is not a
shell. The only spooks and shells of human origin
are the powerful thought-forms left by people under
great emotional excitement, the astral bodies of souls
which are earth-bound, and the electromagnetic
bodies of those wi10se corpses have not yet disinte-
grated. One might delude oneself into thinking any
one of these was a departed loved one; hut the dis-
criminating would not make this mistake; and such
spooks and phantoms can not he made successfully to
impersonate loved ones who have passed to the next
plane. The teaching that such is the case is merely the
inversive use of a fact in the effort to disparage the
belief in the immortality of the soul and to create a
disbelief in the possibility of spirit communication.
Initiation.-In the soul's pilgrimage Arcanum XX
represents the awakening of the soul to its angelic
state as the result of entering into the soul-mate
system.
Occult Science.-The Next Life, is the science of
those conditions which surround the life-form after
it passes from the physical plane, and embraces a
consideration of inner-plane properties, and the
means by which the soul continues its advancement
in the -realms beyond the tomb.
384 THE SACRED TAROT
The Magic Cross Spread.-In this spread the
cards are shuffled and cut as usual. Then five cards
are dealt in a straight line from left to right; and
eight more cards are dealt in a vertical line crossing
the horizontal row at right angles, as illustrated on
the frontispiece. Thus while there are really only 13
cards in the spread, there are 5 in the horizontal
line and 9 in the vertical line, making 14, the double
7 of regeneration. This explains the mystery of the
cross; for 13 is the cross of death and 14 is the rosy
cross of life.
The cards marked on the diagram 1 and 2 are to
be read as the past. Cards marked 6 and·7 are the
hopes and expectations. 4 and 5 represent the oppo-
sition and the adversaries. Then 3 is the present,
where all factors meet to give birth to the future.
And cards 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13 represent the
future so conceived.

HOW TO READ THE TAROT
F
ROFICIENCY in any art, physical or psy-
chical; depends largely upon system and
method; and this is true of acquiring pro- .
ficiency in tarot reading.
The first thing to adopt in formulating
such a system is a rule in which, except when another
shuffies them for the purpose of receiving a reading,
no other person is permitted to handle the cards.
The more the tarot reader handles the cards the bet-
ter, for they thus the more completely become im-
pregnated with his magnetism and are able to
respond to the subtle thought-vibrations of his uncon-
scious mind. But the magnetism and thought-emana-
tions of others tend to impair this responsiveness
through mixing the influences.
For this reason new cards are not so good as
those which have been used repeatedly in card read-
ing. And in order that they may the more fully re-
tain the reader's influence they should not be left
lying around in contact with the household furniture
and thus become contaminated with the magnetism
of others; but for best results they should be kept in
a special box. This box should not be too large, and
a wooden box lined with silk, which is a non-conduc-
tor, is preferable; a small box of soft white pine
being excellent for the purpose.
If the reader expects to devote much time to tarot
practice, and to the spiritual aspect, it is better to

have two different tarot packs. The magnetism,' or
mental emanations, with ·'Which the cards become
saturated in giving personal readings belongs to one
b_
asic vibratory level, ,w.hile philosophical and spir-
itual research belong .to anqthe.r.· If the cards used
for the higher 'lines of thought are also used in-per-
sonal readings they may become·so influenced by the
lower trend for which they .are used that they do not
pr.operly-respond to the cdesire to obtain information
about spiritual things.. So it. is well to have a ·sep.a-.
rate pack for each type of.use, and not to use either
pack for gaining informa,tion .except on its own vibra-
tory plane.
As a table .on which to lay out the cards, any sur-
face will do. A sewing table is ·excellent and easily
handled; but where the amount of time devoted to
the subject warrants, a light, unvarnished and un-
painted table of soft white pine is·still better. A new
table imparts no extraneous thought-vibrations to the
cards, and if unvarnished more quickly absorbs the
thought emanations of the reader and gives the best
conditions .for tqe psychic intelligence to manifest
itself.
A room which is the scene of constant discord and
strife is not suitable for any kind of psychic work, as
the vibrations left disturb the tranquillity of the un-
conscious mind and tend to impair the action of ·the
psychic intelligence in its manifestation through the
cards. Of course, good.re.sults can be obtained when
the conditions are not ideal. I have here merely out-
lined the best conditions. But if these are not to be
392 THE SACRED TAROT
had, diligent practice will yield good results with the
cards even under very unfavorable circumstances.
I have in an early lesson of the course indicated
that a definite system in shuffling and cutting should
be followed, and only departed from when there is
a very urgent impression to do so. Thus the uncon-
scious mind of the reader, and such other psychic in-
telligences as may be present, will have a clear idea
of how the cards are going to be handled. Knowing
how the cards will be handled facilitates giving them
the proper arrangement by which accurate informa-
tion may be conveyed through them.
The person to whom the reading is given should
be seated on the opposite side of the table facing the
reader; and if the arrangement permits, it is better
that the reader sit on the south side of the table and
the person to whom the reading is given sit on the
north side. The natural magnetic flow is from north
to south, and this seating aids the establishment of a
relation of positive to negative between the client
and the reader.
Before the cards are touched the reader should
ascertain just what it is that the client wishes to
know, so that he will have a clear idea of what the
cards are expected to reveal. Then he should ask the
client to clear his mind of all desires and thoughts
other than the desire to receive a true and correct
reading, or answer to the question. A trivial atti-
tude will cause the reading to take a frivolous turn.
And if there is a strong desire in the mind of the
client or reader to receive a certain answer, it will
HOW TO READ THE TAROT 393
tend to cause the cards to give that answer. But if
the desire is only for the truth, and there is earnest-
ness, the cards will mirror this attitude and respond
with a clear and accurate reading.
Holding their minds to this unbiased attitude t-o
know the truth, the client is then instructed to pick
up the cards and shuffle them in such a manner that
the ends of some will also be reversed. He is then
told to cut them at random into three separate piles,
and to collect them again into one pack in a manner
giving them a different position than they had before
cutting. This process is gone through asecond time,
and then a third time, all the while the minds of both
being occupied with the desire to receive a truthful
answer. When they have been thus shuffled, cut, and
recollected the third· time by the client, the reader
takes the cards and deals them from the top, face
downward, in the form of the spread he chose to use
before the shuffl_
ing started.
Then the reader starts by taking the first card by
the top and turning it over from top to bottom so
that it lies face upward on the table. He looks at
this card and notes any impressions he receives in
connection with its usual divinator:y:_significance and
states them to the client. But in reading the inter-
pretation he is merely to be guided by "the common
meaning, and is not to be restricted to it.
For the sake of facility the brief divinatory mean-
ing of each card as given in these lessons should be
memorized. Yet the real a-rtist will recognize that
every card is the symbol of some astrological influ-
394 THE SACRED TAROT .
ence, and his intuition often will select some phase
of this astrological rulership to indicate the events
w.hich are to t.ranspire.
The Broader Significance of Each Card.-On
each Major Arcanum is given its corresponding
number, at the upper right-hand corner is the symbol
of its astr<;>logical planet or sign, below is the English
letter, at the lower left-hand corner its Hebrew and
Chaldean letter, at the lower right-hand its Egyptian
letter, and if it corresponds to a zodiacal sign, the
stars of the constellation picturing the sign are traced
on the card as they appear in the sky. Outstanding
things relating to each Major Arcanum are given in
the text accompanying its description; and further
things _
ruled by the corresponding sign may be learned
from lessons No. 90 and No. 8; and further things
ruled by the corresponding planet may be learned
from lessons No. 92,and No. 107.
The scope of interpretation of each arcanum is
thus vastly increased through the ,applica.tion of the
law of correspondences. For instance, should Ar-
canum XVI be turned up it might read as an acci-
dent, which is the common meaning. But this ar-
canum is really an expression of the energy of M ars,
so that if there were cards preceding it which indi-
cated sickness, it should then he read as a surgical
operation; for surgical operations only occur in peo-
ple's l~ves when .there_is 3: Major Progressed Aspect
involvm~ Mars m their btrth-charts.1
The Kings, Queens and Youths.-·On each of the
court cards which represents a type of individual,

in addition to the corresponding playing card sym-
bols to he found above and below on the left-hand
side of the cara, and the emblem of the suit to he
found at the lower right-hand cornert the symbol of
the zodiacal sign it represents is given at the upper
right-hand corner, and on the card the stars of the
constellation picturing that sign are traced as they
appear in the sky. If the picture on the card is that
of a man, it represents a man when right way up,
and represents a woman when reversed. If the pic-
ture is that of a woman, it represents a woman when
right way up, and represents a man when reversed.
Then the suit alone.indicates one of the four general
temperaments, and the complexion of the indiyidual
thus designated, if such is all that is required.
The brief description and the Key-phrase given in
association with each card representing a person,
adds further information about the designated indi-
vidual. But the student, as he advances will desire
more details about such persons as are indicated in
the spread ; and on occasions will wish to know their
spiritual leanings as well as their more common char-
acteristics. The description of people horn under
each zodiacal sign, as set forth in lessons No. 46 and
No. 105 will give full details of their characteristics;
lesson No. 89 will give their personal appear.ance;
and the allegorical story and its spiritual teaching
given in Course VII as relating to the sign, will re-
veal their spiritual possibilities.
The Horsemen.-The Horsemen are mounted to
signify the carrying>power ·and astrological signifi-
396 THE SACRED TAROT
cance of thought. The suit, as shown by the symbol
at the lower right-hand corner indicates what the
thoughts are about. They represent the thoughts of
other people in relation to the client; usually being
the thoughts of the person nearest whom found in
·the spread. If a Horseman is found right end up, it
indicates that the thoughts and plans so signified are
favorable to the client; but if the Horseman is re-
versed, the thoughts and plans are detrimental to
the interests of the client.
The Minor Arcana.-ln astrology the Sun or a
planet is considered not only in its relation to the
point where the observer stands, but also in relation
to. its position in the zodiac. In relation to the di-
urnal rotation of the earth, when the Sun is on the
M. C. at noon, it corresponds to Jod of the divine
word, and to the suit of scepters; yet in relation to
the Sun's apparent annual journey through the zo-
diac, scepters correspond to the fiery signs.
When the Sun sinks below the western horizon its
position corresponds to the first He of the divine
word, and to the feminine suit of cups; yet in relation
to the zodiac, cups correspond to the watery signs.
When the Sun is on the nadir at midnight, where
one day joins another and the power of darkness is
greatest, this position corresponds to Vau of the
divine word, where J od and He unite, and to the
suit of swords. Yet in relation to the zodiacal circle,
swords correspond to the earthy signs:
Finally, when the Sun rises on the eastern horizon,
bringing new life to an awaiting world, its position
HOW TO READ THE TAROT 397
corresponds to the suit of coins; yet in relation to
the whole zodiac, coins correspond to the airy signs.
The common divinatory interpretation of the
Minor Arcana considers the suit according to the
positions relating to the diurnal rotation of the
earth; that is, in reference to the M. C. (business),
the Desc. (affections) , the Nadir (affliction) and
the Ase. (life and money) . But the inner interpre-
tation is derived from the correspondence of each
card to a ten degree section of the zodiac.
Each Minor Arcanum has its number placed at
the upper left-hand corner, and the symbol of its
suit at the lower right-hand corner, the emblem being
repeated the proper number of times in the symbolic
I design. The nine arcana of each suit correspond to
the nine decanates of each zodiacal triplicity, the
tenth arcana, both embracing the whole triplicity as
a completed circle and marking a transition to a new
cycle, being summarized by the triplicity's Key-word.
The Movable signs of the zodiac are the starters,
the PIONEERS, hence the true point of departure
in any triplicity is not where it first appears in the
zodiac, which with the earthy triplicity, for instance,
would be Taurus, but with its first appearance in a
movable sign. Thus the fiery triplicity commences
with Aries, the watery triplicity with Cancer, the
Airy triplicity with Libra and the earthy triplicity
with Capricorn.
If you will turn to the illustrated key at the front
of lesson No. 22, it will be plain that the first three
decanates of the earthy triplicity, corresponding to
398 THE\SACRED TAROT
the suit of swords, are there shown numbered 1, 2, 3,
in Capricorn at the top of the key; that the next
three decanates occur in Taurus and are numbered
4, 5, 6; while the last three decanates of the earthy
triplicity appear in Virgo, numbered 7, 8, 9. A little
study of this key will indicate the astrological posi-
tion and correspondence also of the decanates of the
other triplicities corresponding to the other suits.
Each of the Minor Arcana befow 10 thus corre-
sponds strictly to one of the 10 degree section of the
zodiac. And as each of the 36 decanates is pictured
in the sky by a constellation, the stars of the constel-
lation corresponding to each Minor Arcanum are
traced upon it. In the text, in addition to the com-
mon divinatory meaning of each Minor Arcanum is
given its inner interpretation, which is revealed by
the Key-word of the decanate to which it thus be-
longs.
As the student advances, however, he will wish
still more detailed information as to the significance
of these Minor Arcana. The symbols indicating the
decanate to which each belongs are given at the
upper right-hand corner of the card, and the planet
ruling the decanate is placed, for ready reference, at
- the lower left-hand corner. Full details of the
physical significance of each decanate, and thus of
its Minor Arcanum, may be learned by consulting
lessons No. 103 and No. 104; while the allegorical
story relating to each, which reveals its spiritual
significance, can be had by looking up the decanate
in Course VII.' '
HOW TO READ THE TAROT 399
Interpreting the Cards.-Beginners should restrict
their interpretation closely to the common divinatory
meaning; but it will. be seen that as all events,
thoughts and circumstances have astrological cor-
respondences, every possible combination of events
and conditions may be indicated in a tarot spread
-if the wide astrological interpretation is used.
If all the cards are turned over before the read-
ing starts the mind sp~ntaneo~sly wanders all over
the spread and it detracts from the ability to draw
correct conclusions from the card under considera-
tion. Therefore, the eaFds should be turned over,
one at a time, as read. After reading the first card,
which usually indicates some event or condition in
the past, the next card should be turned over and
read as a subsequent condition or event modifying
the first, and the third card as a ·circumstance mod-
ifying all that has preceded. Thus proceed from
past through the pr~sent into the future, each card
like a single petal of the opening bud of events,
which alters in shape as it expands, yet all required
to represent the full blown flower of the future.·
Some of the cards will be found right .end up, and
some reversed. But this reversal of· ends does not
reverse the meaning, as is sometimes thought. In-
stead it makes the card somewhat less fortunate than
it is when right end up, just- as ·a planet is less fortu-
nate when it receives a bad aspect, or as a sign is less
fortunate when its ruler receives an .inharmonious
aspect. For insta.nee, Saturn'can-hardly be considered
a, benefic planet when well aspected; and Arcanum
400 THE SACRED TAROT
XV is never a good card, even when right end up;
but when reversed it is more like Saturn afflicted by
a discordant aspect. On the other hand Jupiter, even
when much afflicted, is never very malefic; therefore
Arcanum V, even when reversed can signify very
little' evil, although it 1s then not so good as if right
end up. The same principle applies also to the minor
arcana. Thus except for the court cards, the signifi-
cance of which when reversed has already been ex-
plained, any card right end up is more fortunate than
it is when reversed.
To determine the influence upon the life of the
client of any Court Arcanum, consider the card just
preceding it in the spread. To determine what action
will be taken, or move made, by a person repre-
sented by a Court Arcanum, consider the card that
next follows it in the spread.
One may read the cards for himself; and one may
read the cards successfully .for an absent person,
both shuffling and reading the cards. And as in any
art, proficiency is acquired only by much practice and
observation of results.
When using the tarot cards for spiritual and philo-
sophical problems, in which the life of no person is
involved, the Major Arcana become of great impor-
tance, and at times may be used apart from the other
cards. In such considerations the 12 Court Arcana
represent the 12 zodiacal signs, and the things to
which they correspond, such as the 12 types of in-
telligence. The Horsemen then represent the 4 ele-
mental kingdoms, and also the four principles related
HOW TO READ THE TAROT 401
to the word Jod-He-Vau-He. The Minor Arcana be-
come useful to designate the various numerical re-
lations.
In using the tarot for philosophical and spiritual
problems, the Court Arcana, other than the Horse-
men, may also be taken to signify the influence of
their corresponding zodiacal signs to modify condi-
tions.
And in the use of the cards for such purposes, it
should be carefully borne in mind that the reading
of the Major Arcana should always occupy the same
plane as the problem to be solved. Thus if the prob-
lem concerns the physical plane, such as the destiny
of a nation, its success.in war or commerce, the geo-
logical epochs of the earth, the growth of plants and
animals-physical relations-the reading given for
the physical world should be used. But if the prob-
lem is concerned with the soul world, with mental
action, with the intellectual development of life, or
with the interaction of magical forces, the reading
should follow the interpretation of the Major Ar-
cana given for the Intellectual world. Furthermore,
if the thing about which information is sought has to
do with universal principles, with spiritual condi-
tions, with eternal verities, or with the working of
God's Great Plan, the interpretation given in con-
nection with each Arcanum in the spiritual world
should be employed. The idea is always to have the
premise~ and conclusions on the same plane.
The Major Arcana of the tarot are only sur-
passed as subjects for meditation by the spiritual
402 THE SACRED TAROT
texts of astrology. One such card can be used thus
on one day, and another card on the following day,
its symbolism and meaning in the three different
worlds receiving undivided attention. After thus
thoroughly covering the entire 22, they may be vari-
ously joined in twos, the interaction of the two
principles being meditated upon, in different arrange-
ments. If, for instance it is desired to know the
value of g()od and evil, conjoin Arcanum V and Ar-
canum XV; or if the effect of controlling desire
would be known, meditate upon the union of Ar-
canum I with Arcanum VI.
Because everything which exists has an astrological
correspondence which is als<;> associated with a tarot
card, by selecting the proper factors, any physical or
occult problem may be solved by the use of the tarot.
Thus, taking something crude, if you wished to know
the possibilities of gasoline, ruled by Neptune, for
power, you would select Arcanum XI. If you wished
to know more about the alternating current of elec-
trical science, you would c~mbine X, ruling elec-
tricity and sudden changes with VI ruling the copper
transmitter. Arcanum XVI thus would giv~ you
something definite to think about.-
In an astrological chart, to get a clearer view,
you can substitute the admonition which starts, "Re-
member, then, son of earth," for the dominant
planet, or for the significator of the thing asked
about. And if the correspondences of the factors in
the problem are unknown, you can take the pack of
cards and lay out a suitable spread as·in other divi-
HOW TO READ THE TAROT 403
nation by cards, to get the answer. What the tarot
can be made fo reveal is limited only by the capacity
of understanding of the person using it. ·

In the intellectual world, the triumph of adept-
ship.
In the physical world, the highest possible attain-
ment.
Remember, then, son of earth, that the empire of
the world belongs to the empire of light and that the
empire of light.is the throne which God reserves for
the sanctified will. If Arcanum XXI should appear
in the prophetic signs of thy horoscope, thou wilt
gather the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil;
and drink of the eternal foµntain, if thou art suf-
ficiently master .of thyself to approach it without
coveting; obstacles will disapp~ar from thy path, and
thy destin¥ will have no limit save those of thy will.
In Divination, Arcanum XXI may be read as
Success or Attainment.
Arcanum XXI is figured by a kneeling young girl
playing on a harp of three strings. .Above is a wreath.
of twelve flowers, each flower having three blossoms.
At each of the four angles of the wreath is a head;
404 THE SACRED TAROT
the two below being the head of an eagle and the
head of a hull, the two above being the head of a
lion and the head of a man. The man's head has the -
sacred serpent at its brow to indicate mental fer-
tility. In the center of the wreath is a phallus and a
yoni conjoined. This sacred lingha is soaring up-
ward through the wreath, sustained by two wings.
'The young girl symbolizes purity of life. She is
modestly clothed to indicate simplicity of living and
moderation in desires. She kneels as she plays the
harp to indicate absolute devotion to the higher
laws, and prayerful aspirations to live a spiritual
life.
The harp has three strings, signifying harmony of
body, intellect and emotions.
The twelve flowers of the wreath above are the
twelve .zodiacal signs in which all experience is
gained. The three blossoms of each flower indicate
that both souls, as represented joined in the winged
linga, have garnered the flowers of zodiacal ex-
perience on all planes, physical, astral and spiritual.
The head of the Lion signifies the creative forces
of the solar sign, Leo, and the courage which is neces-
sary to all real attainment. The head of the Bull
represents the fructifying agent of nature and points
out the necessity of labor in all progress. The Eagle
signifies that sex, as signified by the sign Scorpio,
has been turned into channels which lead to spiritual-
ity. And the head of the Man indicates that both
intuition and intelligence are necessary guides in un-
folding the highest spiritual possibilities.
HOW TO READ THE TAROT 405
These four emblems ranged around the zodiac
typify the processes of evolution. They are the
four forms of the Egyptian sphinx, and also symbol-
ize the passage of the Sun through the four zodiacal
quadrants. As applied to adeptship they point out
that the neophyte must have energy and courage to
sustain his efforts, must have knowledge to direct
his energies properly, must labor ceaselessly for the
realization of his aspirations, and must gradually
tune his emotions to a higher, more spiritual vibra-
tory level. Those four attributes, Wisdom, Perse-
verance, Courage, and Love are usually rendered
in occult circles as: "To Know, To Do, To Dare,
To be Silent."
The winged lin_ga in the center of the wreath
of zodiacal flowers symbolizes the permanent union
of soul-mates and their ascension into angelic worlds
by virtue of the properties of the soul-mates system
so form_
ed. The girl kneeling by the harp denotes
that this union was brought about by living the life
of the spirit while on earth. Spiritual aspirations
and devotion to furthering God's Great Plan, lov-
ing and unselfish endeavor to contribute the utmost
to cosmic welfare, together with a clear conception
of the laws of harmony, in time bring about the
recognition across the spaces and the development
of exchanging lines of force, which lead to this in-
effable union. · This harmonious reverberation of
soul to soul is symbolized by the harp of three
strings, for the union embraces all three planes.
Strength depends upon harmony, and the music
406 THE SACRED TAROT
of their souls sounding across the spaces endows
both with a hitherto unknown power to overcome
obstacles, to gain the blossoms of experience on all
three ·planes, as signified by the three flowers related
to each of the 12 zodiacal signs. As a whole the
ensemble signifies the attainment of adeptship while
on earth, and the crown of angelhood that awaits
such perfo;:t human beings when they have passed
from the physical and function in the sublime vistas
of the future.
Number.-Numerically, 21 is the third decave of
3, representing Arcanum III operating on the plane
of Arcanum III, hence marriage in its most perfect
expression. It signifies the complete nuptial union of
7 carried through three planes to be developed into
angelic expression. And it also signifies in its other
aspects, the 3 x 7, or highest possible development
of human functions and possibilities.
Astrology.-As in truth the Sun is the source of
all physical, mental and emotiQnal power expressed
on earth, the planets merely refracting its various
attributes, and the signs acting as sounding-boards
for such expression, so Arcanum XXI, signifying
perfection, union and attainment on all three planes,
corresponds to the Sun.
Human Function. - Arcanum XXI pictures the
ultimate reunion of soul-mates. And as such reunion
enters into the formation of a new system in which
the ego is the central nucleus, about which_the mag-
netic and spiritual forces of both souls play, endow-
ing the ·whole·with properties which transcend even
HOW TO READ THE TA:ROT 407
those of five-dimensional life; Arcanum XXI . well
corresponds to the ego:
Alchemy.-In Alchemy, Arcanu·m XXI represents
the final ·product, or-s.uccessful transmutation, and
more specifically it denotes the completion of The
Great Work. .
Bible.-The Bible refers to the principle involved
in Arcanum XXI as the.Promiseq· Land, on which
Moses was permitted to look, but into which he was
not able to enter. In this respect the Kabala states
that Moses was able to pass.49 gates, but could not
pass the SOth, or gate ot jubilee. . . .
Masonry.-ln Masonry, the Degree of Perfec-
tion is based upon Arcanum. XXL This Ar:canurn
is symbolized in .ancient masonry by .a two-h_e~ded
eagle. An eagle .is the spiritual aspect of sex, ·and
the two heads signify two intelligences, or souls,
united and occupying one soul-mate system. .
Magic.- In Magic, Arcanum XXI represents the
exer:cise of. the functiqns..of adeptship. Although
not easily distinguishable, there are seven grades of
humanity who live and move upon the earth, the
seventh, and highest, state being .that of the perfect
maq.. The attainment of adeptship .on the physical
plane is the grand climax of physical evolution, .the
topmost po.int in the :ladder ,of worldly ambitions.
The adept, ·Commencing as an earnest neophyte;
has undergone a ·system of study by which he ·ha:s
mastered the 21 ,different branches..of occult science•
He has entered upon a process of regular psychic
trainin·g by which his-inner faculties are made active
408 THE SACRED TAROT
and accurate, and thus he masters the 21 lucidic arts.
Intuition is used to check reason, and the psychic
senses are developed to a keenness that they can be
depended on for far-reaching information not acces-
sible in the outer world.
Furthermore, there are 7 states of consciousness
which are developed, which constitute soul attain-
ment. Those 49, then, are the 49 gates of attain-
. ment which Moses passed. And the 50th is that
which relates to the union of true soul-mates.
The real adept, however, is not, as so many seem
to imagine, a being who has attained wonderful
power, but who resides in seclusion and lets mankind
work out its own problems. Instead, if he is really
an adept, and not merely a magician, he moves
among men, and uses all his powers, in the manner
that will be most helpful, to alleviate suffering and
to aid the forward movement of universal progres-
sion.
Whatever the powers he has developed, you may
be sure the adept is actively engaged in using them
for human welfare. He realizes that the destiny of
the cosmos depends upon each section of it advanc-
ing as rapidly as possible, and performing its own
work. And he has striven to become an adept, not to
have magical powers by which to amaze the multi-
tude, but because such a high state of development
gives him added usefulness in the general scheme
of things. Constantly, and persistently, he works for
human upliftment, and for everything that will aid
in the proper development of God's Great Plan.
HOW TO READ THE TAROT 409
Initiation.-·In the soul's pilgrimage, Arcanum
XXI represents the consciousness of the where-
abouts of the soul-mate, and finally, due to spiritual
work accomplished and spiritual faculties developed,
the union in a soul-mate system. As such permanent
union is a relation of spiritual forms, it is apparent
there can be no permanent union until both have
spiritual forms developed. Spiritual bodies are not
something with which people are born, they are build-
ed through living a spiritual life. Consequently, the
effort to locate the soul-mate, until such finer forms
have developed, is premature, and leads many
p~ople to grievous error.
Furthermore, as when the spirituality is suf-
ficiently advanced, through living a truly spiritual
life, it leads spontaneously to a recognition of the
soul-mate, the most fitting effort toward such a state
is not to set out on a soul-mate quest, but to set out
with the determination to develop adeptship. When
adeptship, or even its approximation, is attained, the
knowledge of the soul-mate comes by virtue of the
states of consciousness developed, and with no spe-
cial endeavor required.
Occult Science.-Personal alchemy, which em-
braces the various changes which the devotee of

ceaseless cooperation in the furtherance of God's
Great ·Plari. '
Remember, ·th~n, son of earth, that all things
physical p;tss away; and that before the soul can
pass to higher real~s every debt to nature must he
paid to the utm9st .farthing. If Arcanum XXII
should appear in the prophetic signs of thy horo-
scope, imprudence threatens to encompass thy ruin,
and thou wilt he called upon to pay for thy folly
unless thou immediately changeth thy ways.
In Divination, Arcanum XXII means Failure,
Foily, and Mistake; (or Spirituality).
Arcanum XXII, or 0, like the planet Pluto, has
a dual interpretation. As XXII, it is well repre-
sented by the letter T with its point thus down; but
as 0, the circle being the symbol of spirit, it is rep-
resented by the reversed T, that is, having the
point, or energy, directed upward, the cross-bar
resting below on the earth, and thus indicating that
HOW TO READ THE TAROT 4:11
the thoughts, emotions and acti.ons, are directed ex-
clusively toward spiritual endeavor.
. It is figured by
a blind man carrying bags op _
his left shoulder. H.e
leans on a black staff and walks toward a fallen ob-
elisk, behind which a crocodile. with open .mquth
awaits to devour him. Above is an ecli~e=°f the
Sun. The eclipse signifies that the spiritual light
from within has been obscured by material interests;
or it signifies that dark forces from the inner plane
try to shut away the spiritµal illumination which
guides the neophyte.
The bags over the left shoulder, of the blind man
indicate the material things of lik he has spent his
efforts acquiring; or it represents his ability to minis-
ter in physical ways to those in need.
The staff of experience with. good and evil is
black, .indicating that prudence is subservient to the
demands of the senses; or that the demands for up-
lifting and protecting others is so great that, though
enlightened, he ignores all danger.
The fallen obelisk symbolizes the final overthrow .
of all temporal work and power. The crocodile in-
dicates the ultimate fate of all who are blind t6
spiritual things, and also the persecution of those
who work to spread the true facts of spirituality. ·
· This blind man is the atheist, or materialist, and
the man who is so absorbed in material aims that
he neglects all thought of spiritual things. It is like-
wise the man who is a slave to his desires. And the
ensemble thus symbolizes the inevitable suffering
which follows sin. Or, it symboliz.es the truly spirit-
412 THE SACRED TAROT
ual man, who is so enthusiastic in his effort to assist
the race that he is completely blind to the conse-
quences to himself. And thus, equally well, it sym-
bolizes the law of universal compensation, which
decrees that f9r all effort expended in a constructive
channel there inevitably follows increased ability and
real advancement.
Number.-Numerically, 22 is the third decave of
4, and thus represents sex used to gratify the pas-
sions, or for magical and selfish purposes. 0, how-
ever, which is the alternate reading of the Arcanum,
represents the cycle, and shows that there is a tran-
sition of character to a higher basic spiritual, or vi-
bratory, level.
Astrology.-In astrology it is found that the
planet Pluto has two marked and opposite qualities.
It rules the gangster and racketeer when its destruc-
tive side manifests; and it rules the highest type of
spiritual effort, and the realization by the individual
of his cosmic work, when the better side is manifest.
These two extremes are symbolized by Arcanum
XXII.
Human Fnnction.-On its destructive side Ar-
canum XXII corresponds to, and symbolizes, the
disintegration of the vehicle on the inner plane oc-
cupied by the soul; and on the constructive side Ar-
canum 0 represents the infiltration to the soul yet
on earth of information and instructions from
adepts occupying the super-velocity spiritual plane.
Akhemy.-ln Alchemy, Arcanum XXII signifies
failure in transmutation, and the regimes adopted
HOW TO READ THE TAROT 413
in the hope of transmutation which lead only to
repressions. Arcanum 0, on the other hand, repre-
sents the work in cosmic affairs which is undertaken
after the Great Work has been accomplished. ·
Bible.-In the Bible we read that the Fool has
said in his heart that there is no God. Also, Math.
16 :26; "For what is a man profited, if he shall gain
the whole world, and lose his own soul?" Math.
12 :32; "But whosoever speaketh against the Holy
Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this
world, neither in the world to come." Speaking
against the Holy Ghost is effort made to prevent
the progress of God's Great Plan of eternal evolu-
tion.
Masonry. - In Masonry, the Sublime Knight
Elected is based upon Arcanum XXII, the Tau, or
T, with the point down, instead of with the point up,
and thus indicating that the creative energies are
devoted exclusively to material ends.
Magic.-·In Magic, Arcanum XXII indicates that
the individual has given himself over to the control
of invisible intelligences who have no regard for
his welfare, and who use him consi~tently to thwart
any and everything which is true and progressive on
the face of the earth. It symbolizes elemental af-
finities that are formed in the selfish endeavor to
gain, through magic, material advantages over
others.
Arcanum 0, the alternate interpretation, how-
ever, indicates that there is freedom from all con-
trol; but that the individual has contacted intelli-
414 THE SACRED TAROT
gences of a very exalted spiritual plane who direct
him consistently in his efforts to give to those on
earth new and higher teachings.
Initiation. - In the soul's pilgrimage Arcanum
XXII represents the failure of the soul to gain self-
conscious immortality. It also represents the ob-
stacles which, whenever the neophyte sets his feet
resolutely_ on the path of adeptship he ill sure to
attract. The resolution to live in a different manner,
by the law of affinity, causes the thinking about it to
attract obstacles to the performance of the thing
resolved upon.
Arcanum 0, on the other hand, indicates that the
soul through its earthly experiences has developed
in the bui~ding of its spiritual form far enough that
it will not need to tarry in the astral world after the
dissolution of the physical, but wil! go at once to un-
dertake a higher mission for The Father, on the still
more interior planes. And it represents that law of
affinity which, when the aspirations are vivid, at-
tracts spiritual entities and forces which enable it,
through their help, to overcome the obstacles to its
spiritual progress.
Occult Science.-·Arcanum XXII represents the
soul-annihilating dogmas of materialism. But Arca-
num 0, on the other hand, represents the soul uplift-
ing teachings of THE RELIGION OF THE
STARS.
THE LIFE SPREAD.-The Life-Spread requires
a large table, or space, on which to lay the cards.
After shuffling and cutting the cards in the usual
HOW TO ,READ THE TAROT 415
manner, the cards are .dealt, one at a time, face
downward in the forin of a hollow square of 28
cards. 4 is realization and 7 is per£ection of form,
and these 4 x 7 cards. of. the square, or 28 (2 plmi 8
equals ten) ,involving to 10, symbolize the cycle of
life in the physical form. Yet, as laid, there are 8
on each side, the number of crystallization. This
square relates tQ the physical endeavors.
Within this hollow square of the physical, deal a
triangle of. 12 cards, so that there are 5 cards on
each side of the triangle, always dealing from the
right hand corner around to the left. 5 is the number
of inspiratipn and 3 is the number. of action. These
12 cards indicate the sacrifices ( 12) which have
been mad,
e of the physical comforts for the sake of
developing the mentality. This triangle, the triangle
symbolizing mind, relates to mental attainment.
Then in this hollow trine, commencing at the bot-
tom, deal a circle of 9 cards. 9. is the number of
divine wisdom, and as it is in the form of a circle,
which sym}Jolizes spirit, it relates to spiritual at-
tainment.
There are now 49 cards, or 49 gates to life, 'and
there -remains only to add the 50th card in the cen-
ter to give the jubilee, which is the point where
square, trine and circle are one. The spread is illus-
trated on the frontispie~e.
In reading this life oracle, start with the lower
right hand corner of the square and read entirely
around the square to the left, turning and reading
but one card at a time. The cards in this outer
416 THE SACRED TAROT
spread are all to be considered as events relating to
the physical life and material success; and not as
having much direct bearing on intellectual pursuits
or spiritual attainment. Each, in the order in which
it occurs is to be considered as a subsequent event or
influence.
After the material events and influences have thus
been read, start at the lower right hand corner of the
trine, and read around to the left; but consider these
cards, as turned and read, to have to do with the
mental processes, the intellectual attainment, and
such studies and opportunities as have to do with
acquiring knowledge.
Next start with the bottom card of the circle and
read it around to the left. The conditions there
found, and the opportunities shown, relate to the
spiritual development, and the moral trend. Of
course, material happenings and mental opportu-
nities have an influence upon the spiritual life; but
only such as are found in the circle of 9 cards are to
be considered as really important factors in the
spiritual life.
The events relating to each plane of endeavor, as
shown in this spread, are to be considered as those
of most importance throughout the whole of the
life. And as a final revelation, indicating the event
which, on the physical, mental and spiritual plane,
will have most influence in shaping the client's life,
the central card, or Jubilee, should be turned over
and read. ·
