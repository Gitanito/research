 Calvert (1867-1940) was one of the rural (he published from Pigeon-Roost-In-The-Woods, Indiana and then in Mountain View, New Jersey) philosophers and prairie socialists who sprang up in the United States around 1900.  He was an eccentric writer and pamphleteer, an early pioneer of the nudist movement in the United States, an admirer of Whitman, the Roycrofters and Elbert Hubbard, Jack London and Emma Goldman, and the journal was replete with New Thought offerings and carried extensive advertising for the works of the lesser-known New Thought mages of the period.  He organized a Harmonic School of Rational Education which taught lessons on health, breathing, diet, "sex ethics" and eugenics, "Harmonica of Nature" and rational education, and was a pamphleteer on divorce, socialism, Christian Science, white slavery, woman, and right living generally.  Noted in The Occult Digest, 1930, and in Rosicrucian Brotherhood, 1909, and given full-page notices in the Initiates, 1908.  The issue for October 1911 carried an article by Gilbert Keith Chesterton.
