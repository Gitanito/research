Got on exit ramp that was elevated, truck slid into barrier wall on right side that stopped truck from rolling over. I saw the wall was ending, I thought I was going to roll over so I turned the wheel hard left and the truck went into the wall on the other side of the road head on. The truck was destroyed and I saw myself (from the ceiling area of the truck) lying on the floor of truck with materials from the passenger side of seat on my body. I was not wearing a seat belt because I always had a feeling something like this would happen, I even practiced what I called (the dive move) where I dove to passenger side of a vehicle practicing for this sort of accident. I was not hurt; I did not even end up with a scratch. 

It seemed like only seconds I saw myself lying on the floor of truck and I thought to myself (I am dead). Then I saw myself move on the truck floor and thought I am alive. Police showed up, I asked how you got there so fast; he said he got the call about twenty minutes ago, so I guess I was out twenty minutes. Now I wear seat belt and don't practice the dive move anymore.
