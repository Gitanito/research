  		              		Experience Description   

  At 16 years old, I was a passenger on my friend's motorcycle.  It had just finished raining a typical southern downpour and we left the highway to turn around in a parking lot and head back home.  There was a large pothole covered with water in the lot and my friend drove right through it thinking it shallow.  It was actually pretty deep and the front wheel of the motorcycle stuck and we were thrown from the vehicle (neither of us were wearing helmets).  As I tumbled through the air, I had a partial pleasant life review, as though I was in a movie theatre, and many memories/experiences of my current life up to that point were played out on the movie screen.  Luckily for both of us we landed in a nearby seasonal creek and other than a few bruises were unharmed.

  I never mentioned this life review to my friend nor anyone else for many years, not sure it really happened, though it seemed real.  For a few years I had some occasional  disassociated feelings that I didn't exist or my life was unreal but those eventually passed I haven't had those feelings for many decades.  Some years later in college I took a psychology course that discussed this life review phenomenon and validated that what I had experienced previously was real and not too uncommon given the circumstances.
