  		              		Experience Description   

    This experience happened in the middle of the night. I had been sleeping.

    

  My husband and I were sleeping in our double bed. During the night I woke up, thinking of going to the bathroom.  As I arose, I looked down upon the bed and there was a women sleeping beside my husband. That women looked exactly like me. A carbon copy! I got scared and thought, 'But that can't be me. Who is that?'  Suddenly, I felt a presence nearby, seeming to be about three feet away from me.  I turned to look and there was a man standing near the window. He was about six and a half feet (two meters) tall. His silver hair was combed back in a ponytail. He had blue eyes. His face was pale white, silky smooth, and had a shine to it, reminiscent of the moon. He had no mustache nor beard. His clothes were all white—simple and neat. The man did not look scary to me at first.  

  But after looking at him for a moment, I got scared. I found I could not speak from my mouth, but WAS able to communicate with him from my brain. So I asked him, 'Who are you?' I got no reply. I asked him two more times, 'Who are you?' He finally replied, 'I am Allah's Angel and I have been sent to take your soul because you are dead now.' I replied, 'No, I am NOT dead. Look, I am standing here with you.' And the Angel said, 'Yes, you ARE dead. See? There is your dead body lying right there on the bed.' I told the Angel, 'No, it's not. That is a Jinn (spirit) lying beside my husband. It has simply taken my form.' But the Angel replied, 'No, that body lying beside your husband is YOUR dead body and the 'YOU' standing here is your soul.' At that point, I started believing him and having sad feelings because I would have to leave my husband and my three sleeping children.  
  
  The Angel gently held my hand and we floated out through the window. The feeling of sadness vanished as we moved upwards towards the sky. Looking downwards, I saw the roof of my house and then the other houses on my street. As we continued to move upwards into the sky, I saw everything getting smaller and smaller, and it all looked so beautiful. At first, the earth looked flat to me. But the further up we went into space, the more the earth appeared oval shaped. Then looking around, I saw we were passing planets, stars and many galaxies. They looked very beautiful. I seemed to be going somewhere very, very far away, but in a short span of time. I suddenly jerked and I wasn't there any more.    

  When I opened my eyes, I was in an incredibly beautiful, amazing garden that I cannot find words to describe. I was standing in this garden next to a huge gold and silver gate with many decorative shiny gems of different colours. The Angel who was with me now stood on the other side of the gate. He said, 'You cannot leave this garden. This garden is your place and you have to stay here until Judgment Day.' I said to him, 'Take me back to my family NOW. My children are small and they will need me.' I told the Angel to speak to Allah, and plead with him— 'Allah, my Lord, please! No matter what, you MUST send me back!' The Angel did not reply to me; he just disappeared.  
  
  Then I felt like touring the garden. Looking around, I saw a massive pathway leading to many smaller paths. The ground sparkled with white sand. I didn't see any grass. There were many trees that were blossoming in different colours and putting forth lovely musical melodies. Flowers emanated their own light. I had never seen anything like this scene on earth. I picked up a handful of the white sand and threw it up in the air. It gave off golden sparkles and then disappeared! I saw beautiful birds of different sizes, shapes, and colours. As I watched the birds in flight, I saw light sparkling and glittering from their wings. And their bird calls sounded like beautiful melodies! The sky was a peach colour. There were no clouds, no sun, moon, nor stars. The weather was perfect, calming, peaceful and just pure happiness. The place felt like I belonged there and I thought 'This is my home.'  

  I walked up a path and came to a river where it divided into two forks. One fork was the colour of milk and the other fork was honey colored. There were trees that had massive fruits such as figs, apples, and grapes. Also, there were many different types of fruit that I didn't have names for, as I had never seen them on earth. As I was walking along the path, I approached some tall flowering plants. I moved the flowers aside to see what was behind them. There I beheld a huge, massive palace with shiny pearl domes. Its bricks were transparent, yet glowing with a silvery gold color, and there were beautifully colored gems interspersed among the bricks. The palace glowed with a mighty golden colour and it had emerald green doors. I walked towards those doors and they opened automatically for me, so I entered the palace. The carpets were silky green with a sequence of beautiful designs. I saw two golden thrones, decorated with green emeralds, red rubies and silver. There were also lovely red silk chairs glittering with beautiful gems. Also, there were sparkling, swinging chairs of green and silver. I was going around, touching everything and feeling so excited and so happy.  

  I notice that I was dressed in a peach-pink silk dress with pearls and diamonds. I was wearing golden shoes, accented with pearls. I gazed around the interior of the palace and saw many doors. I opened one of the doors and found myself in a huge bathroom made of shiny, cream-colored marble. The bathtub was round, with water in it and it was full of floating lotus flowers. I also saw a beautiful, ivory silk dress with decorative pearls and diamonds on it. I was amazed. I then made my way outside of the palace to explore some more. First I saw a huge multi-coloured bird sitting in a tree. It had a big beak and a feathered crest like that of a cockatoo. The bird spoke to me, saying, 'Peace be upon you.' I also saw a tree with gigantic multi-coloured flowers. I went over to that tree and felt that I could communicate with it. I then noticed the river with the two forks and I sat down near it.  

  Suddenly, I was back on planet earth. I heard a thump, an impact sound coming from my chest. I sat up with my heart racing!  I was sweating, feeling pain in my chest, and was gasping for air.

    Did time seem to speed up or slow down?         Everything seemed to be happening at once; or time stopped or lost all meaning.    This felt like I was in that garden for a full day.  It also seemed like  there was no time there because the day remained the same. It was unlike earth morning, afternoon, evening and nighttime daylight changes.    

    Were your senses More vivid than usual?         Incredibly more vivid    

    Please compare your vision during the experience to your everyday vision that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.       my vision in my NDE experience was powerful. I was able to control my vision by zooming with my eyes far and wide. My eyes never felt tired.    

    Please compare your hearing during the experience to your everyday hearing that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.      my hearing in my NDE was very sharp. I can hear very clearly. If I had to focus on the bird, I can hear that bird singing.

    Was the experience difficult to express in words?        Yes   This place I believe must be paradise. I cannot express my words, we on earth are so insignificant and so limited.  That place I saw was very real from the trees to the palaces. I only explored a little, yet it blew my mind away of what I saw and felt.    

    How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?
