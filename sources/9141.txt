  		              		Experience Description   

    Fifteen years ago,  I was in a severe bus accident and  was seriously injured. I was totally unconscious when the accident happened. Almost all the bones of the right leg and right hand were fractured and I had minor head injuries. I was hospitalized. The hospital was under the control of ministry and the poor people were suffering due to political influence and corruption inside from the doctors. We did not have enough money to spend to get appropriate care from the doctors. I had to undergo surgeries to repair my bones. At last, the doctors decided to do the surgery, one week after the accident occurred. It was New Year's day and it took long time for my surgery. After surgery they have shifted me to the normal room due to lack of space in the intensive care unit and the after-care special room. The doctor kept the respiratory tube with me and told me that I had several breathing issues. He told nearby bystanders  to take care of me so that I would not try to pull out the ventilator out. I was eagerly waiting for the time to get rid of the tube. After some time, I was feeling that my breathing was congested. I fought to breathe and became unconscious.

   I was seeing a speedy track-road with white lines and I was rapidly moving. On both sides of the lines, several white gloves were waving back. Suddenly at one point, that rapid movement stopped.  I could hear an old doctor's voice saying,  'Now she is perfectly all right' as I  returned to consciousness.
  
  According to the doctors the tube got stuck,  I wasn't  breathing, and they couldn't feel a pulse because lung compression happened. After a long time from several doctors' efforts, I could breath and came back to normal.

   I was about to die and  was travelling to and pushed back from another world. The unexplained speed was that I was really moving to eternity and the white gloves were the souls that  were not allowing me to enter there. I have a lot of questions that  remain unanswered and I still feel those feelings moving me  forward.  I  consider the incident as my strength and it reminds me about the purpose of living here.
