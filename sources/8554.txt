NDEs  Call for a Celebration of Life on Earth: Life Purpose.

   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;    After reading many accounts of NDEs,  one quickly gets the sense that there are universal truths that transcend  religion.&nbsp;   When people were asked if they came back with a sense of order or purpose  to this existence on earth, the overwhelming reply was a resounding, &quot;YES!&quot;&nbsp;   The most important purpose was to learn lessons; while the most important  lesson was to practice unconditional love.&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     The good news is that there is no  hell, unless we create one for ourselves.&nbsp;  The  bad news is that we keep coming back until we get it right.&nbsp;  In  the life review, the only judge is the experiencer.&nbsp;   Many people report that they had all knowledge, remembrance, and total  compassion on the other side.&nbsp;  To  learn lessons on earth, people are made to forget their home on the other side.&nbsp;   Everyone who came back, including atheists, had a profound sense of the  continuity of life.&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     The NDEs seem to come at a key point  in a person's life in order to either give them a choice to leave or to  continue existence on earth.&nbsp;  There is a pattern suggesting a NDE acts as a planned event  when a person gets too far away from their life's purpose or goal.&nbsp;   When they come back it is definitely a path-altering event.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     Most people described home as  the other side as they were free from physical pain or limitations and with  those they loved the most.&nbsp;  These people knew that earth was but an illusion lasting  short blink in the universal eye of time.&nbsp;  Interestingly,  Jesus was the number one figure people talked to.&nbsp;   This is not surprising since most of the submissions to NDERF are from  predominantly Judeo-Christian countries.&nbsp;  Unanimously,  everyone returned to this life because they still had a purpose to fulfill on  earth.&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     So why would one want to celebrate  being on earth?&nbsp;   It is one of the rare opportunities to experience growth of the spirit.&nbsp;   It is hard to learn or grow in an environment with total knowledge and  unconditional love.&nbsp;  By coming to  earth, we are taken out of our natural surroundings to not just live with God,  but to co-create with God.&nbsp;  The  greatest triumph of the human soul is to overcome darkness and adversity on  earth and to do it with unconditional love.
