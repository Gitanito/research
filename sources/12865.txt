I remember flying through a very pretty tunnel. I found myself by a waterfall, and saw my father! He stayed with me for a while. It was an amazing place, full of vibrant beautiful colors, bright green grass and blue skies. My father looked wonderful. He spoke with me after a bit and told me I had to go back to take care of my sister and my sons. He told me that I was not allowed to see my mom, as they would not let me. I recall watching over my own body, as well.
