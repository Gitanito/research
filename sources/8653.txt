  				Before I was married I met Ron. He was late arriving at my   				college, and as he entered the room I knew him. I am a normal   				heterosexual guy, so this knowledge was just a full on   				acceptance of him, a pre-knowledge of his complete and quirky   				nature, his old fashioned attitudes and sense of self.   				Everything. So as I knew him I just gestured to him and said   				something like &quot;Hi Ron, there is a space over here...&quot; and so   				began a very long and often fun but rather shallow typical male   				relationship. Yet I knew him so well and so immediately.    				
  				I do not feel my wife is a soul mate in the romantic sense. I   				did know within a week or two that we were meant to marry. I   				proposed after nine weeks and so began our stages of marriage,   				some wonderful, others hard. She is a beautiful and wonderful   				wife. She teaches me, and I hope I do the same. We love each   				other but we are so different and our connection whilst loving   				is not complete.    				
  				My soul mate, my perfect fit, was a surprise to us both, a   				surprise that I was definitely not looking for. One day during a   				lecture on a specialized and intriguing subject I just felt this   				sensation. Each of the next two days afterwards, without knowing   				who or what I was sensing I just kept feeling a stronger and   				stronger sense of warmth, of bliss in my chest, just below my   				sternum. I have never felt anything quite exactly like this   				before or since. As I said I didn&#39;t even know for sure it was a   				person that I was feeling, we had not spoken yet and in this   				crowded room it was initially impossible to understand what was   				happening to me. Initially I thought perhaps I might be ill or   				even have eaten something. After a day or two I could feel the   				same sensation but growing daily stronger, the sense became   				directional and sometimes moved about. So I focused on looking   				in the direction, trying to find out who, or what, was causing   				me to feel this way. It was a completely non sexual sense of   				full belonging. Something that I had not thought possible to   				experience. So eventually I knew. We were similar, so very   				similar. To cut a short story shorter, we both had separate   				lives we had to complete. So why did we meet? I felt one   				overwhelming truth, that we just loved each other fully. This   				brief relationship taught me the importance of my prior   				commitments. Without honoring my already present life I felt I   				would undervalue myself so much that I would no longer be worthy   				of someone I loved this much. Sounds simple, but it is truly so   				hard, the hardest thing I have yet had to do, to say goodbye to   				a soul mate. She taught me patience and acceptance to a deeper   				level than I had ever thought truly existed.&nbsp;    				
  				Perhaps my story seems a little to much like a lust or just   				another wayward husband story. You would be incorrect. I was not   				looking for, nor feeling the need for another relationship. To   				this day I marvel at the magical and wonderful sensation I felt   				and can only liken it to a similar, not identical, feeling I had   				when I meet a true healer. That is another story.    </body>
