He was too strong for me, and I thought that I was drowning, or that maybe I was dead. I began to see a bright, yellowish light and feel that if this was death, it was very peaceful and wonderful.

One of my feet found a rock, and then my head came out from under the water, and I was totally rejuvenated.

Ever since that incident, I always wondered if I was dead and was brought back by God. I have never experienced the bright light before.  I had never heard about it on television or other media sources.

I do thank God because maybe I was dead, and he put the rock there.
