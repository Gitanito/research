My feeling was that I did not think it was possible to survive. My spirit body separated from the physical body and my consciousness floated up and up and up. At some point, while I was up there, I was met by a female figure. Her presence was the embodiment of pure love. The next thing I remember was descending gently downwards towards my physical body which was on the ground with the attack still in progress. As I drifted back down, I was aware of a silvery cord trailing downwards, stretching back and connecting to the physical body from where I was in my spirit body. The cord had an endless, relaxed quality to it and seemed to be able to stretch infinitely and retract easily. At that stage, I felt peaceful, calm and an acceptance as I was only witnessing, not experiencing what was happening to my physical body.

  				    As a part of the experience, I asked about the nature of reality and why stuff like this happens. It was an urgent question, because I'd reached the limit of endurance to sustain emotional equilibrium regarding trauma, I absolutely could not go on without knowing the answer. I poured everything into it, my focus, my heart and soul, 'Why did this happen to me? What caused it? Was it me? Was it because I was bad person?' Up until then, I'd never truly considered the possibility of judging myself as a bad person.

  				    Then as if overlaid on reality, I was presented with an image of a fractal. As the motion of the curves of the fractal moved inwards towards itself, I saw the faces of each of my friends embedded in various sections of the fractal, and then repeating. I received the understanding that the people we know are somehow attached to our beliefs and in a way - an external representation of our beliefs. I remember thinking, 'Oh, this friend is the mother within me, and oh, that person is the child... ' and other aspects of self.

After the experience, I was immediately freed from the fear of death and emotional healing began. I focused on loving myself and looking at each one of my beliefs and teasing and untangling any repressed pain. It was slow and steady, until the day I became freed from any type of emotional pain. I'd also been given an inner connection to an intuitive mechanism which guides my spiritual evolution and within this context, I've experienced many spiritual transformative experiences and events, including communicating and visitations or merging with beings, such as Jesus, Mary, the Divine Mother and Aboriginal Ancestral Spirits.

After the NDE:

Was the experience difficult to express in words?      Uncertain   Only in the sense that I did not have names for things, like the fractal and the long silvery cord that was attached to my spirit body as I was returning to my physical body.  Since this event, I have 'seen' this type of cord on a friend of mine who passed away from a brain aneurism in 2004. My Spiritual teacher, Amma, showed me a 'vision', where the cord detached from my friend's physical body after Amma gave it a tug. The passing over was completed in an instant and my friend 'happily jumped in Amma's arms'. I felt a lot of peace after this vision.

How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?     I remember the experience as accurately as other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.    This is the most vivid experience from around that time.

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?       Yes     I can see an unseen world which overlays this world. While it is energetically finer and lighter in density to our physical world, its topography is similar to this world in that it shares the same trees, rocks, rivers, and so on. I can receive thoughts telepathically, heal, read energy imprints of past and future events of physical locations, be taught directly from nature, dream-share, bi-locate (as reported by others), OBE and receive ADCs. I can remember things like pre-birth memories, being a baby and other lives.

Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?        The fractal.

Have you ever shared this experience with others?     Yes    It was several years until I shared my experience with anyone. I have not talked about it often, but when I have, it was received positively.

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?     Uncertain   Possibly

What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?       Experience was definitely real     I believed it. I had no doubt that my experience was real.

What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?       Experience was definitely real     I equally believe it now. I have had other experiences since that have confirmed and enlarged my understanding concerning what I learned that night.

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?     Yes   The longest continuous experience that was similar was with my Aboriginal Ancestor Spirits, when they gave me a creation story and welcomed me back to the land.

Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?       I have a different sort of connection with animals now.

Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?       Some questions could have had the added option of Other or Unknown. Thank you.
