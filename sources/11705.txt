However, during the course of my NDE, what I "felt" and "understood" during the passage through the tunnel or shaft of light that I was in was quite extraordinary.  Passing through this area, which seemed as if it could be endless, yet wasn't, I could sense those spirits that were in the shadows, I understood why they wouldn't look into the light, mostly because of the religious indoctrination that had lived by on earth, they felt they were not worthy to look into the light because of actions they had done in the human existence.

As I passed through the tunnel, I came to the end and saw the most beautiful garden ever.  I have to interject here, I had been here two times before as this was my third NDE.  All that I experienced on that side, all that I remember, I could not include here, it would take to much typing to put it all in.  The one thing I can say is this, what I went through, changed my life, changed my perceptions about life and what life is all about to such a degree that many people that I have been in contact with, it has also raised doubts and questions they have about their own beliefs.

I'm not afraid of death or dying.  I don't even care how I die.  I have a promise made to me by the Creator, the moment my mission in this existence is over, I will leave immediately and I don't care how I go out.  I just want to go home.

Physically, minimal, spiritually and consciously, extremely alert.  To the point that I vividly recall all that I saw and the conversations I had with those on the other side.

No, it was real.  The only thing I have to add to this is, while I was in my experience, I had the pleasure of having a discussion with Jesus.  I knew it was him and that I can never deny.  I also received a wonderful hug from him.  I felt his body with my spirit and there are times, especially when I do have occasional bouts of depression, I can still feel his physical body with my fingertips and I know he was real and that what he brought to the world was wonderful.

I could see myself as I am now, yet in a perfected state.  I was a bit overweight in my physical form, yet I was in perfect form on that side.  My hair was past my shoulders, yet was white, like spun glass.

 Humility, joy, happiness, sadness when I had to leave.


  			        That is kind of difficult to explain, I did and I didn't.  I did hear birds singing as well as everything around me.  Yet it wasn't sounds that were unknown as they are here.  Everything resonated with the energy of our Heavenly Father.  No music on this earth comes close, yet I still listen for it.

  				        God, Spiritual and Religion: 

  				        What was your religion prior to your experience?   Conservative/fundamentalist   1st, Methodist  2nd, Baptist  3rd, Mormon

  Have your religious practices changed since your experience?      Yes     Not only with the advanced increase of my psychic abilities, I had been Mormon at the time of my last NDE.  I have since left that belief and found that I have understandings about many beliefs, many I have never studied before.  I found that I have been drawn to embrace instead Wicca and Paganism, as I felt the presence of not only a "Heavenly Father", but a "Heavenly Mother" as well.  And that she had just as much, if not more, than Father in the creation of this existence.

  What is your religion now?      Liberal   Wiccan

  Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?      Yes     Not only with the advanced increase of my psychic abilities, I had been Mormon at the time of my last NDE.  I have since left that belief and found that I have understandings about many beliefs, many I have never studied before.  I found that I have been drawn to embrace instead Wicca and Paganism, as I felt the presence of not only a "Heavenly Father", but a "Heavenly Mother" as well.  And that she had just as much, if not more, than Father in the creation of this existence.

  The experience included:      Presence of unearthly beings

  Did you seem to encounter a mystical being or presence, or hear an unidentifiable voice?      I encountered a definite being, or a voice clearly of mystical or unearthly origin   

  Did you see deceased or religious spirits?      I actually saw them

  Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion: 

  During your experience, did you gain special knowledge or information about your purpose?    Yes   I came to understand that life as we know it now is also an illusion.  Since my NDE, I acquired a beautiful crystal ball.  For one thing, as I gaze into it, I can see our existence as I saw it on the other side.  There is no time, that is our measurement.  What we need to experience, we can do so at whichever "time" would best suit that experience for us to gain that understanding.

  Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?     Yes  Oh yeah, it changed for a while with my wife and children, but they soon could see how it changed me in helping them.    Relationships with my extended family members, well, not so good, they always thought I was crazy, and now they think I've really gone off the deep end.  They are a closed minded lot, and are not very receptive to change.

  After the NDE: 

  Was the experience difficult to express in words?     Yes   When I have been asked about what I "saw" during my NDE, what is especially difficult is trying to explain something that has no explanation, nothing to compare it too.

  Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?      Yes     Was born psychic, however my experiences have only magnified my abilities

  Have you ever shared this experience with others?    Yes    Many times.  I belong to the IANDS Chapter in Salt Lake City, but I haven't shared my complete story since I moved from there.

  Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?    No   

  What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?     Experience was definitely real.     

  What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?      Experience was definitely real.     

  At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?    No

  				        NDE Elements: 

  				        At the time of your experience, was there an associated life-threatening event?      Yes   Illness  Ruptured Appendix  Life threatening event, but not clinical death I had a ruptured appendix

  				        How do you consider the content of your experience?      Positive

  				        The experience included:      Out of body experience

  				        The experience included:      Light

  				        The experience included:      A landscape or city

  				        Did you seem to enter some other, unearthly world?     A clearly mystical or unearthly realm     I have already written about the room with the wheel, but there was more.  I was also given a review of our world, our existence, from the beginning.  I was there at the council in Heaven when the plan of Salvation was discussed and accepted.  We all were there.  This existence, this earth, was created in the spirit before it was created in the physical form.  How awesome it is to not only look down upon this earth and see the aura of it as it radiates out.  To know the Earth’s aura is made up, not only from the planet itself, but from each and every living soul on this earth.  The Earth’s aura is the most brilliant blue.  Even our sky does not compare to the radiance of this aura.

  				        The experience included:      Strong emotional tone

  				        What emotions did you feel during the experience?      Humility, joy, happiness, sadness when I had to leave.

  				        Did you reach a boundary or limiting physical structure?      No     

  				        Did you come to a border or point of no return?      I came to a barrier that I was not permitted to cross; or was sent back against my will   I was given a choice about my returning.  I was also told that the things I had put into motion during my life would continue to their completion, but I wouldn't be there to enjoy them as I'm supposed to, if I chose to stay.  I understood that I needed to return, I was sad, but I also knew that my return would actually be quicker than snapping your fingers when it was time.

  				        God, Spiritual and Religion: 

  				        What was your religion prior to your experience?   Conservative/fundamentalist   Devout Mormon

  				        The experience included:      Presence of unearthly beings

  				        Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion: 

  				        After the NDE: 

  				        Was the experience difficult to express in words?     Yes   

  				        Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?       The best was talking with our Lord Jesus Christ and finding out truths that the ancient theologians conveniently forgot to put into the scriptures.  I also know and it was confirmed to me the missing points could be found in three books that have never been revised or changed.  They have only been translated once and revealed only once.  Those three books are: The Book of Mormon, The Pearl of Great Price and The Doctrine and Covenants.

  				        Have you ever shared this experience with others?    Yes    Many times.  I belong to the IANDS Chapter in Salt Lake City, but I haven't shared my complete story since I moved from there.

  				        At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?    No   

  				        Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?      Dear Jody,

    Thank you and Jeff for such a wonderful website, and you are welcome. In response to your question "I am curious - can you say what the symbols were or what they mean and how they are used?"

    Well, I can and I can't, to say what the symbols were, some of them I know what they were and why they are there, others, I know them when I see them and also know how to use them.

    First: 1 set of the symbols were those of the zodiac, but not as we know them, but their astrological star constellations.  Whether some want to believe it, those symbols do have a correlation to events or occurrences that have or will happen on this earth or in an individual's life.  It is really more complex than even some astrologers have ever delved into.

    Second: Another set of the symbols pertain to the healing art of Reiki as we call it here.  I know all of the symbols, and how to use them, as I'm also a Reiki Master.  I hate to burst anyone's bubble, but some of these "new" symbols that Reiki Organizations have come out with are nothing but marks, they do nothing.

    Third:  Another set, pertains to wisdom, knowledge and understanding.  This one is extremely difficult to explain as it more involves senses and feelings.  They are keys that help in unlocking "mysteries" that we have often thought we would never know.  They also help in enhancing psychic abilities.

    Besides the symbols, there were also crystals that go with each symbol.  Of course the most powerful of all crystals is a diamond, but who could afford a diamond ball, only a clear or semi-clear quartz ball can be used for all the symbols as it resonates all colors.  Yet besides the crystals, those crystals also held colors and they too are important to our psyche and to our overall health and well-being.

    To tell people what these symbols are, it isn't easy to explain something there is no reference to.  Many of them I can't explain, because I just use them everyday, they are like second-nature to me.  Just as my psychic abilities I've always had, even now this gift is more pronounced. 

    I hope this makes sense, and if you have anymore questions, please don't hesitate to ask.  Until later,

    Sincerely,

      William Si


       DIALOGUE with William

    Hi Jerad,

    J:  Do you have a clear understanding of what your mission is and how to go about accomplishing it or do you just have to think and feel your way through it as best you can?

    M:  MY UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT MY MISSION IS ON THIS EARTH, PRIMARILY HAS BEEN HIDDEN FROM ME, (NOT ONLY AT MY REQUEST BUT WITH MY PERMISSION).  I ASKED THAT IT BE HIDDEN SO THAT I DIDN'T COMPLETE IT TO SOON.  YET, I ALSO AGREED THAT "SIGN POST" WOULD BE PLACED ALONG THE WAY, JUST SO THAT I WOULD HAVE REMINDERS THAT I'M FOLLOWING MY CHOSEN PATH.

    J:  ...I had been here two times before ... Were there differences in how you perceived your experience from one time to the next or was everything essentially the same each time?  Do you feel we were given a greater degree of understanding with each NDE?

    M:  THERE HAVEN'T BEEN SO MUCH AS DIFFERENCES, YET THE DEGREE OF UNDERSTANDING HAS INCREASED MORE SO WITH EACH NDE THAN THE ONE BEFORE.

    J:  You said you were a devout Mormon before your experiences but that now you do not belong to any organized religion.  Besides this obvious change, what other specific changes have you made in your belief system as a result of your experience?  Please be as explicit as possible.

    M:  AN UNDERSTANDING IN WHAT LIFE IS ABOUT AND WHAT OUR PURPOSE TRULY IS HERE.  THE MORMONS BELIEVE AND TEACH THERE ARE "CLASSES" AND "LEVELS" IN HEAVEN THAT WE WILL BE JUDGED AND PLACED IN AND ONLY IN THE HIGHEST LEVEL CAN WE "ASCEND" TO BE WITH GOD.  FROM MY EXPERIENCE I LEARNED OR REMEMBERED THERE WERE NO "CLASSES OR LEVELS" AS THEY WERE TEACHING.  YET THE LEVELS ARE MORE OF UNDERSTANDING THAN PUNISHMENTS. WOULD IT MAKE SENSE TO PUT A 2 YEAR OLD IN WITH A GROUP OF PEOPLE WITH PhD'S?  THE 2 YEAR OLD WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND.  YET, THOSE WITH THE PhD'S WOULD HUMBLE THEMSELVES WITH THEIR LEVEL OF UNDERSTANDINGS TO TEACH, NURTURE AND HELP THE 2 YEAR OLD GROW IN THEIR LEVELS OF UNDERSTANDING.

     J:  Can you share what things about this life were important to you and your own beliefs?

     PRIOR TO BEING MORMON, I WAS RAISED IN A METHODIST/PENTECOSTAL HOME.  I GREW UP BELIEVING THAT GOD THE FATHER WAS AN ANGRY VENGEFUL GOD AND THAT JESUS WAS SENT TO SAVE US FROM HIS WRATH.  WRONG!!!

    FOR ONE THING, GOD IS NOT AN ANGRY VENGEFUL GOD, BUT IS A LOVING PARENT TO ALL OF HIS CHILDREN.  AS FOR JESUS, ONE THING THE THEOLOGIANS WANTED US NOT TO KNOW WAS THAT WHILE JESUS WAS ON THIS EARTH, "HE WAS HUMAN".  ALL OF THE PRINCIPALS HE TAUGHT HE DID AS "HUMAN".  THE MARRIAGE IN THE BIBLE WHERE HE TURNED THE WATER TO WINE.  THAT WAS HIS MARRIAGE, IF YOU STUDY JEWISH HISTORY.  AS HUMAN, HE HAD A WIFE AND CHILDREN, WE JUST DO NOT KNOW WHO HIS LINAGE IS.  ONE THING HE DID TELL ME, IF YOU STRUGGLE WITH TRYING TO DO ALL THE PRINCIPALS HE TAUGHT, "STOP"!!! DON'T DO THEM ALL AT ONE TIME.  TAKE ONE AND WORK ON IT, WHEN IT BECOMES SECOND NATURE, THEM PICK UP THE NEXT ONE, ETC.  WHEN HE SAID, "THESE THINGS I DO, YOU CAN DO ALSO, AND THEN SOME", WAS NOT AN EXAGGERATION, BUT TRUTH.  WHEN WE LOOK BACK ON OUR LIFE AFTER WE LEAVE HERE, WE WILL SEE THAT WE HAD DONE ALL THAT HE HAD TAUGHT, AND MORE.

    ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS HE TOLD ME WAS, WHAT BETTER WAY FOR MAN TO KNOW THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO BE SAVED. SAVED FROM WHAT?  OUR SOUL IS ALREADY ETERNAL, ALWAYS WILL BE.  OUR SOUL/SPIRIT IS LITERALLY A CHILD OF GOD AND AS SUCH IS ETERNAL.  WHEN WE REALIZE THAT ALL THINGS, ALL WORDS COME FROM GOD, NOTHING IS OFFENSIVE TO GOD BECAUSE IT CAME FROM GOD.  WHAT IS OFFENSIVE IS HOW WE PERCEIVE IT.  AS FOR OUR BODIES AND SPIRITS JOINING IN THE "RAPTURE", WE HAVE THAT CHOICE ANY TIME WE WANT.

     J:  Can you tell me what these gifts were/are and what you now do to use them fully?

    M:  MY GIFTS WERE MY PSYCHIC ABILITIES.  HAVING BEEN RAISED WITH A METHODIST MOM AND A PENTECOSTAL FATHER, THEY BELIEVED THEY WERE FROM THE DEVIL AND THAT I SHOULD CAST THEM AWAY UNLESS I BE CAST INTO HELL.  MY GIFTS ARE NOT FROM THE DEVIL, SINCE I DON'T BELIEVE IN THE DEVIL OR IN SATAN.  I USE MY GIFTS TO HELP HEAL PEOPLE AND ONLY TO SERVE GOD IN THE WAYS I'M SUPPOSED TO GO.

    M:  From this is sounds like we have total control over the way our life unfolds and develops.  Is this what you meant?  If so, how do we decide which "time" to choose and what direction to go in?

    J:  WE DO HAVE CONTROL OVER OUR LIVES? THAT IS OUR CHOICE OF FREE AGENCY.  GOD GAVE US THAT AND WILL NEVER TAKE IT AWAY.  IN EVERY THING THAT WE DO, WE HAVE A CHOICE TO BUILD UP OR TO TEAR DOWN.  TO CONTROL AND MANIPULATE OR TO GUIDE AND LET GO AND LET OTHERS MAKE THEIR CHOICE FOR THEIR LIVES.

     M:  The best, talking with Jesus and finding out truth's that the ancient theologians conveniently forgot to put into the scriptures.  Can you tell me what those truths are? 

    J:  I PUT A LOT OF THOSE IN A PREVIOUS QUESTION YOU ASKED.

     M:  I am also a Reiki practitioner.  Can you tell me which of the "new" symbols are nothing but marks?  Which of the "old" symbols do you use?  What is the power these symbols have?  Before reading what you said here, it was my feeling that the symbols really didn't have any power; that the real power behind Reiki was the love and the loving intent behind the hand placement and touch.  But I am going to reconsider this position because of what your have said.

    J:  THE OLD SYMBOLS, THE SEI HE KI, CHOKU REI, DAI-KO-MEO, AND THE HO SHA ZE SHO NEN, THESE SYMBOLS ARE POWERFUL WITHIN THEMSELVES.  YET MANY OF THE REIKI SCHOOLS LIKE TO TEACH THE KARUNA METHOD AND SOME OTHERS THAT I HAVE FOUND ON THE INTERNET.  THEY ARE NOT REAL AND HAVE NOTHING TO THEM.  YES, THE REAL POWER OF REIKI IS BASED ON LOVE AND THE INTENT OF THE HAND PLACEMENT, VERY TRUE, BUT THERE ARE SYMBOLS THAT ARE NOT USED FOR HANDS-ON OR DISTANT HEALING, YET ARE USED TO ENHANCE PERSONAL ABILITIES IN PSYCHIC HEALING AND PSYCHIC WORK.  THEY CAN BE USED IN GUIDING AND HELPING THOSE CAUGHT IN THE SHADOWS THAT ARE AFRAID TO LOOK INTO THE LIGHT.  MANY OF THESE SYMBOLS ARE USED IN MEDITATION TO OPEN YOURSELF UP TO RECEIVING GUIDANCE FROM THE OTHER SIDE.

    I HOPE THIS ANSWERS SOME OF YOUR QUESTIONS.  IF YOU HAVE FURTHER QUESTIONS PLEASE DON'T HESITATE TO ASK.

     SINCERELY,

    WILLIAM SI

    ==========
  William Sillyman's Response to What About a Soldier?

    Dear John,

    I want to thank you for contacting Jody at the Near Death Experience Research Foundation (NDERF).  She asked me to send my response to you also to the site so that it can be shared with others.

    The question that you have, on "How does God/The Creator view someone that has to kill for their country?"  That question can be also asked as to anyone that has to take the life of another either to defend their country or way of life.

    When I was on the other side and was watching my life review, there were also other questions that I had pertaining to many different things.  And it is interesting to note that one of these questions, was the taking of another life.  Another discussion regarded Adolph Hitler and those like him who have been a part of our history, made notorious for their actions.

    What I was shown was that each one of us, including Hitler, have all been shown what our "mission" on this earth would entail.  We saw all that would occur during our life.  However, we were also shown various paths that we could take during the course of our life.  None of these paths are predestined.  But instead, we (not God) put specific signposts along the way to trigger decisions that we should make.  Sometimes we recognize them, other times we don't.

    One thing that we do know, whether we choose to come to this earth as white, black, Oriental, Mexican, Christian, Jewish, Catholic, Muslim, Hindu or Buddhist, we also know and realize that there may be times we will have to defend our way of life and our personal beliefs, even to the point of taking a human life while we are here.  That is our freedom of choice.   We also know that when we come here, we may be called to exercise our duty as a citizen of a particular country,  to protect and defend that way of life. 

    When it comes to judging, God does not judge as so many religions practice, they do a really good job of guilting you to death.  Guilt for looking at a woman or man, for taking a drink, smoking, etc.  However, for you to defend your way of life, you are rewarded and praised.

    As I mentioned earlier with Adolph Hitler, our history books teach hatred.  We are to continue to hate this man for what he did and for what he ordered.  Why can't we look at it in a different point of view of what the man taught us?  Hitler’s message is that if we (mankind) do not watch what we do and how we act, this is how low mankind can really go. 

    His actions and those who followed his orders tried to wipe out a whole race of life, simply because it was different than theirs.  And as such, because of that lesson, look at the appropriate response that American soldiers were called upon to perform.  The U.S. was attempting to stop, not merely a way of life but a threat to all life.  The big picture is to realize that it doesn't matter what walk of life a person may have chosen, we are all "Children of God."  We just have different points of view and that is ok.

    When it comes to the 9/11 incident, my point of view with that is, those that lived were not meant to die that day.  Those that did, it was their chosen day and time on that day and in that way.  Why?  What could possibly be the reason?

    Our  nation and those of all  nations have recognized for a long time that individuals have terrorized our way's of life.  Just like it took the 6 million plus to die in the Concentration Camps at the hands of the Nazi's, it took that many to make a strong enough impact to wake us up— not just the U.S., but the whole world.  So it is the same with 9/11.  Sure, we have had a small bombing here and shooting there, but it took something this dramatic to make the impact and for us to realize, Enough is Enough.

    At the end of WWII, it took a few years to help the German people to see Hitler's point of view.  They realized that it was not a threat to Germany but had been a threat to Hitler's point of view.   The same is with ben Laden.  I have many friends that are also Muslim that do not feel the same as al Quaida or ben Laden.  Many religions believe they are the only true religion on this earth, so do these particular Muslims.   

    Since my three NDEs, my point of view has dramatically changed.  Religion, all religions, were created by man and man is the one that wrote and created the laws that govern how you should feel, what you should do and what you think.  God is NO RELIGION, HE/SHE IS JUST GOD.  HE/SHE IS THE GREAT I AM and that is it. We are a part of the Great I AM.  That will never change.  It doesn't matter whether or not what name He/She goes by, He/She is still GOD.

    When mankind gets the clue that to stop all the MADNESS, we just simply have to realize that God is God, and that we are all, literally, a part of God.  Our human bodies may be a part of our parents with all its generations, but our spirit has only one generation— You as the eternal Child of God.  

    When mankind understands the continuity of the soul, mankind will also realize that we no longer need to force others to change individual points of views, because it won't matter.  Individuals will be accepted for who they are. 

    There will finally be no more killing, no more sickness and possibly no more dying.  However, dying is just a rebirth another transition from this existence back to the existence from which we came.

    So, back to your question.  God will not judge those that have had to take a life to defend themselves or their country.  If an individual holds guilt for an action, it is their own self-judgment.  Before I end this, let me try and share a small part of my NDE with  everyone.

    As I was passing through the tunnel, I could sense the spirits that were in the shadows beyond the tunnel of light.  I could feel the torment, the fear, the guilt and shame that they were feeling.  I asked my guardians how could God condemn these spirits to this realm.  I was told that God did not put them there, They Put Themselves There.

    I asked what they meant by this.  (I'm going to be a bit on the blunt side here.)  So many times religions will teach that actions and words can admit or restrain a person from entering the presence of God.  These types of teachings, teach guilt and shame.  For instance, if you say the words, “Shit, Damn or Hell,” that soul will not be worthy to stand in the presence of God.  If a person chooses to live a different lifestyle than the norm, many religions will outcast the member from the group by scapegoating that individual and reminding the rest of the congregation how this individual will be cast into Hell and will never see the Light of God.

    When I stood in the presence of my Creator, I had done things in my life that were not the Norm, but I felt no shame for them, I just felt loved.  While I was there, I was able to see 4 old friends that I had had on this earth.  These friends had all been killed in a car wreck after they had been hit by a drunk driver.  Some would think that that was o.k. because they had been innocently killed.  The drunk driver had also been killed.  Yet he was there also.  Why?  Because the guys had all forgiven him for his actions.  All five of them knew and agreed that their missions on this earth ended on that particular night.

    Oh, I also forgot to mention, the four friends of mine, shouldn't have been in Heaven at all, because religion had condemned them to Hell.  All four of them on this earth had been Gay.  They had no shame or guilt for their way of life.  Society had the shame and guilt.  These were great guys, they never hurt another human being.  Three of them even had younger siblings, and they not once ever Molested or Defiled them, in fact they protected them, even up to the day they died.

    When we pass to that side, when Jesus went to those in Prison, he was talking about those that were in the shadows.  Those through their guilt and shame felt they were unworthy and incapable of being loved by God.  They are who we are to help.  To teach those who remain tortured in the shadows to awaken and realize that their turmoil was of no need.  God is pure LOVE.  The experiences these souls had on earth was just that, an experience and part of their mission.  When they learn to let go of the guilt and shame they will return back to the light.

    I hope this helps and attempts to answer your question.  Please feel free to write me anytime.

    Your truly,

    William Sillyman
