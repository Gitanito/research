CONTENTS.
ThisWork contains an exposition ofthe Errors ofall Ancient and Modern
Authors, impartially stated, proving that no Original Works on this depart
ment of Astronomy, have been published in this Kingdom for several Centu
ries past, and that all Modern Publications on Nativities, which have yet
been given to the World, are pirated from Ancient Authors, with a develope-
ment of their erroneous operations, and Judgment in Directional Motion, &c.
including the Names of. all piratical Authors, who have dishonored this
celestial science by their inexplicable principles and practice.
The pristine eleMents op calculating nativities, and the true
Method of delivering Judgment in all cases, are clearly demonstrated in this
Work, divested of every fallacious hypothesis, with a concise illustration of
the Computations of all Mundane directions, and Parallels by direct,
rapt, and conveRSe Motion, comprising the most correct Rules, and
demonstrable ExamplesforComputing all Arcs of Directions in the zodiac,
which are proved in the Calculations of thirtY reMarkable Modern
nativities, never before published; including the Geniture ofthe infant
duke de bordeaux. All those who are disposed to Study this department
of Astronomy, may refer to the exemplary Computations given in full, by
attending to which, they will be qualified to Calculate all the Arcs of Direc
tions in any Nativity, with accuracy and expedition, and also ascertain
4
their various Effects in the different Terms and Constellations, &c. by which
all important Events, during any person's Life, are accurately discovered,
and previously ascertained. Many Examples forpractice are given in this
Work, computed in full, from new astronoMical tables, according to the
present Ecliptical Obliquity, exemplifying the influence of the Celestial
Bodies on Map, comprising the established Method of selecting, and direct
ing the True Apheta, in any Nativity, in Examples of Life and Death.
The Precepts are interspersed with copious strictures, practical and scientific,
comprehending the Stellar Causes of the retardation, frustration, and
acceleration ofthe Effects ofall Primary Directions, with a dissertation on
Directional Motion in all its parts, which may be proved by the use of the
Celestial Globe, or Spherical Trigonometry. To which are added, concise
Rules for delivering Judgment ON the revolutions of kingdoMs
and states; including correct precepts for coMputing solar and
lunar eclipses, for any number of Years past or to come, with Examples
containing the Calculations; and also the Elements ofthe great Eclipse
of the Sun, on the 15th ofMay 1836. New tables ofthe Poles of the
Houses, and those of Declination, Right Ascension, and Ascensional Differ
ence, arc given in this Work, and likewise all those new and valuable Tables
of Oblique Ascension, computed by the Author, according to the present
Obliquity of the Ecliptic, from one to sizty Degrees of Latitude, compris
ing those Calculated for the principal Cities, and Towns in England, Scot
land, France, Ireland, and North America, which were never beforepublish
ed in this Kingdom.

THE
AUTHOR'S ADDRESS
TO
Many improvements have been made in all
ages, for promoting and advancing useful arts and
sciences, which merit the approbation of an im
partial community ; but in the present age, the
divine science ofGenethliacal Astronomy has been
neglected, and in a great measure discountenan
ced, in consequence of the numerous errors and
notorious contradictions which are recorded in the
pirated works ofall Authors. Many have applied
themselves to this Celestial Study, but have soon
been defeated, because they were not able to ob
tain a competent knowledge of its primitive prin
ciples, having nothing to attend to but delusive
Theorems, multifarious processes, and inexplica
ble Problems void of legal demonstration, which
have plunged them into a Labyrinth of insur-
mounlable error and confusion. Thus it becomes
evident to every enlightened mind, that this sub
lime science, as it is now generally studied, and
practised, must be considered as a most disgusting
and contemptible study, because its advocates and
B
iv THE AUTHOR'S ADOREiS
professors have not produced any ofthose substan
tial and indubitable proofs, which are required to
place this useful, and interesting branch of sacred
literature, high in public estimation ; for no mo
dern examples have yet been given, which are
deemed sufficient to establish the verity of Stellar
power on mankind, neither are there any mani
fest facts on record, that are competent to convince
the unbelievers, ofthe truth ofAstronomical com
putations, and predictions; but in this work I
presume I have unveiled all those flagrant abuses,
and delusive chimeras, with which the Volumes
ofall piratical Authors abound, and having so dene
by authentic examples founded on facts, which
cannot be confuted, I flatter myselfthat my feeble
exertions, will be productive of establishing the
truth and utility of this sacred and much injured
science, and once more restore it to the summit
of its ancient respectability and splendour.
It is well known that this branch of Astronomi
cal literature, was sanctioned and practised in the
earliest ages, by the most august and learned per
sonages, whose works exhibit numerous interest
ing and important truths relative to the effects of
Sideral power; but though the laudable and in
defatigable researches, of those literary and sci
entificcharacters,were attended with consummate
success, yet all those who are Students in this de
partment ofAstronomy, ought to know that there - -
are .several works, which if adhered to, will con-
stflntly mislead them in all their operations-, and

judgment. The Authors of the works I allude
to, are Gadbury, Coley, Parker, White and Sibly.
These pirates have dishonoured this predictive
science by the fallacious innovations, and notori
ous prevarications which pollute their pages ; th?y
have multiplied the most flagrant errors in direc
tional motion and judgment, which ought to have
been deposited in the confines of oblivion, for it
is plain from their pirated works, that they were
deficient in Astronomical calculations. The true
method of directing a significator to its promittor
in Mundo, by direct and converse motion, was
unknown to them, because they did not understand
the Rapt motion of the Earth, and doctrine ofthe
sphere in all its parts. Their Tables and Arcs
of directions are all incorrect, and their division
of the Heavens are also false, delusive and unde-
monstrable, which I have proved by the examples
given in this work. They have absurdly invented
many vague motions of the Celestial Bodies that
have no existence, being remote from truth, which
the most correct Astronomical computations, and
use of the Celestial Globe are incompetent to ex
plain.
A Work entitled, "an illustration ofAstrology",
waspirated and published by Mr. E. Sibly, about
thirty years ago, which has done incalculable
injury to this noble science. In many cases he
has givenprecepts forcomputing directions, which
he has abandoned in his operations, he has also
extracted most of the Nativities from Gadbury's :

collection ; with all the erroneous calculations and
judgment of that Author, which have been very
ably exposed, and refuted, more than a century
ago, by Mr. John Partridge, in his valuable En
glishworks calledOpus Reformatum,and Defectio
Geniturarum, the compilation of those volumes
will immortalize his name, andexhibithis superior
talents in this department of Astronomy, to gene
rations yet unborn. . ,
The Works of Mr. William Lilly on Horary
questions, and on the subsequent mutations of the
World, are interesting and ofconsiderable impor
tance to all genuine students in this celestial sci
ence, and though the Author was unacquainted
with the true method of directional motion in
Nativities, and the correct division ofthe Heavens
-by duplicate horary times, yet he certainly was
the greatest professor of the Mundane, and Ho
rary departments of this science, that ever wrote
in the English language ; his precepts and judg
ment prove his abilities to every unprejudiced
reader. The Works of Mr. John Partridge, and
Mr. William Lilly, are of more value than all
others that have been \ ublished in this Kingdom ;
but if the industrious Students are disposed to
purchase the works of other Authors, which are
al ogether a confused heap of rubbish, they are
at liberty to do so, as Booksellers may always be
found, who will be very ready and willing to sup
ply their customers with works on Nativities, at
enormous prices, if the deluded purchasers think

proper to dispose of their cash for articles that are
of no use, or value whatsoever.
About twelve years ago, Mr. Thomas White
published a work called, "The Celestial Intelli
gencer," which is a wretched compilation of bor
rowed, and stolen trash, collected from the works
of most of the pirates I have mentioned. The
truth is, his work does not contain fifty pages of
his own composition ; his Arcs of directions are
all notoriously false, and his judgment inco
herent and absurd ; he has given the most incon
sistent examples to prove, that the Planets, after
they have passed the Ascendant and Midheavens
return back, contrary to the regular order of na
ture, and the distance of the Stars from those
Angles, he is pleased to stile Arcs of Directions ;
by these and other ridiculous, and whimsical no
tions,the industrious Students are misguided, and
continually deceived in their practice, thus when
a Man is disposed to transcribe and pirate the
works of the living, or the dead, combined with
new inventions void of truth, his own inability
then becomes manifest to an impartial community
and his works will ever record his ignorance and
folly.
Mr. James Wilson has lately published a Dic
tionary of Astrology, in which he has given all
thefallacious precepts, false terms, and preposte
rous innovations ofthe transcribers before quoted.
The errors and contradictions which he has re
Viii THE AUTHOR'S ADDJliSS
vived, ought to have been placed in obscurity,
and not raked together to deceive the ignorant,
and confound the Students in this Science ; but I
have given my opinion on his Dictionary more
at large in another part of this work, hoping that
my impartial admonitions will prove useful to
those who are inclined to adhere to truth alone?
founded on authentic examples and experience.
There are several other Authors who have writ
ten on Nativities, but I shall not notice the rubbish
they have collected, and impudently foisted on the
Public ; but it is by no means sufficient for me to
say thatthe works ofthe Authors I have mentioned
are false, without producing satisfactory proofs of
the truth ofmy assertions, which I presume I have
done in the course of my calculations ; all of which
may be proved by the use ofthe Celestial Globe ;
for what can be more simple and plain than the
examples I have given, or what more easy to be
understood, than those invariable facts, proved
by the clearest demonstration. In the compila
tion of this work, 1 have received no assistance
from any Man living, but I anticipate that suc
ceeding generations will return me grateful thanks
for exposing the errors contained in this noble>
Science, and particularly those in directional mo
tion. It is notorious to observe the villany which
is practised by numerous impostors, who travel
through the Country, and pretend to calculate
Nativities, of which they know nothing j these
W THE HEADER. IX
Juggler81 and artful deceivers, who are gene
rally as ignorant as they are impudent, frequently
attempt to perform many things, which are far
beyond the extent of human comprehension ; In
many towns or villages of note, some of this
scandalous tribe may be found, they cften attract
the attention of the vulgar, and to carry on their
villany without control, pretend to converse with
Spirits, and to have Legions of Angels at their
command. Many of these detestable impostors,
manufacture, and dispose of Charms, Sigils and
Lumens, to make their poor deluded clients rich
and completely happy, and thereby put their de
signs of knavery into execution, by which they
impose on the creduLus, and deceive the ignorant;
but all these, and many other species of villany,
(too odious, and contemptible to mention,) are by
no means connected with the genuine principles
of Genethliacal Astronomy, reduced to practice.
There may be, and doubtless are some, who un
derstand the primitive rudiments of this celestial
Science, butthose literary characters are at present
unknown to me. Every attentive observer may
soon discover the numerous abuses practised un
der the name of this sublime study, which when
attended to in its divine purity, is far superior to
all the known arts and sciences in the World.
In this Work I have given the primitive ele
ments of calculating Nativities, and the method
of delivering judgment in all cases, which are
c
-
I'Hk. AiJTHOK'ti AJ>ltHJh>Â»Â«
clearly demonstrated and divested of every falla
cious hypothesis, with an illustration of the pro
jections of the Mundane Aspects of the significa-
tors and promittors in any Geniture, and in all
parts of the Heavens, comprising the most correct
rules and demonstrable examples for computing
all Arcs of directions in the Zodiac, which are
proved in the calculation of thirty remarkable
modern Nativities, according to the doctrine of
Ptolemy.
I have also given new Tables of Declination,
computed according to the present obliquity of
the Ecliptic, with those of right Ascension, and
Ascensional difference, including new Tables of
the Poles of the Houses, calculated by duplicate
horary times ; I have likewise given new Tables
of oblique Ascension, computed according to the
Ecliptical Angle of twenty three degrees, twenty
eight minutes, from one to sixty degrees of lati
tude, among which are given, those calculated
for the latitudes of several principal Towns and
Cities in England, Scotland, France, Ireland and
North America, which were never before publish
ed in this Kingdom.
Those who purchase this Work will not require
any aid or assistance from any other Author, as I
have not omitted any thing that is requisite to be
understood, by the attentive practitioner. In
erecting the first Figure in this Work, for the La
titude of the City ofLincoln, I have given the true
method of placing the proper Signs, Degrees and
TO THE READBR. XI
Minutes, on the Cusps ofall the Houses, and have
also given Rules how to place the Planets therein,
so that without the least difficulty, a Figure ofthe
Heavens may be truly erected for other Latitudes,
according to the same rules and computations from
the tables of Oblique Ascension at the end of this
Work, as tables of Houses are unnecessary. I
have likewise explained the method ofcalculating
the true Geocentric places of the Planets from the
Epliemeris, for the time of Birth, and have also
given rules and examples in full, for computing
the Latitudes, Declinations, Right Ascensions,
Semidiurnal, Seminocturnal Arcs, and Ascensio
nal Differences of the Planets, with their diurnal
and nocturnal horary times, all of which I have
endeavoured to make as plain and as easy as pos
sible, in order that those operations may be per
fectly understood by every Student in this science,
before he proceeds to compute any Arcs of direc
tions, either in the Zodiac, or in Mundo.
I have given tho true computation of the place
of the part of Fortune, and the method of direct
ing it from the original Greek Quadripartite of
the learned Claudius Ptolemy, which has never
been published in the English Language. The
Lunar Horoscope can only be directed in the
World, having a regular and uniform motion
through all the Houses, it is always found to pre
serve the same space from the Eastern Horizon,
whether by day, or night, as the Luminaries are
distant from ea^h oth^r ; it does not depend on
THE AUTHOR'S ADIiRliSS
the Latitude and Declination ofthe Moon, as thoi>e
numbers are only required in constituting the
Moon's true distance from the Solar place, neither
can it claim the horary times of the Moon, for
certain and obvious reasons ; for if the Moon and
part of Fortune, were allowed to have the same
Latitude and Declination in all parts of the Hea
vens, and in all cases, we should then to no pur
pose, endeavour to explain, what is impossible to
be proved by human Literature. The calculation
ol this important point, as it is given by all Authors
presents an entire mass of error and confusion ;
but as 1 have given all its Arcs of Directions in
the Genitures calculated in this Work, it would
be needlsss to dwell longeron this subject, which
if duly investigated, will doubtless give the great
est satisfaction to all Students in this Celestial
Science.
All Authors have given inaccurate methods for
computing the Poles of the, Planets, which I have
proved by examples in this Work, for when the
Student has used his best endeavours to ascertain
his numbers and distances, &c, under incorrect
polar Elevations, his Arcs oi Dhecticns then be
come entirely deficient, so that no e*ents can be
truly predicted from such lalse cvenations; but I
have made all these subjects as j lain as possible
by my computations ; i have also instiucted the
Student, (by the precepts I have recorded,) how-
to give immediate Judgment on any Nativity,
respecting the propitious and malignant qualities
TO THE READCB
of the Celestial bodies, from their different posi
tions, and configurations in the Radix ; so that
when a figure iserected, the Student may examine
the precepts I have given, and he will instantly
discover, whether that Native, born under the
power of those Elementary qualities will obtain
Wealth and Preferment, or experience Poverty
and Woe. I have likewise given many Arcs of
Directions wrought in full, both in the Zodiac, and
in Mundo, including Mundane Parallels, by Di
rect, Rapt and Converse Direction, so that the
Student may soon become Master of the whole
Art of directional Motion, without which, the time
cf any important Event during the Life ol an in
dividual, cannot be previously pointed out, and
truly ascertained. But to instruct the Student
still further in these Celestial enquiries, I have
alio given Rules by which 1 have explained the
nature, power, and effects cf all Directions and
Parallels in the Zodiac, and in the World ; so that
when the Student has computed the Arcs of Di
rections in any Geniture, by the examples given,
he may then refer to the Precepts, where he will
instantly discover the nature of the Events por-
tanded by the quality and Effects of the different
directions, whether they are good or evil .
. The, Rules which 1 have given lor delivering
judgment on the Revolutions, of Kingdoms and
States, War and Peace, Plenty and Scarcity, &c
may be depended on in all cases,, and those who
properly attend to them, will be amply rewarded
Xiv THE AVTHOlt'a ADDRESS
for their exertions. The method of computing
Solar and Lunar Eclipses I have also given in this
Work, and have inserted the calculations in full,
by a correct method, by which any Student may
compute them with ease and accuracy, for any
number of Years past, or to come.
In the Nativities calculated in this Work, I have
explained the power of Progressions, Annual Re-
volut ons and Secondary Directions by examples,
so that the Student will be enabled to understand
them by little application, and apj ly them in all
cases in the calculation of other Genitures; but
though I have recorded the most substantial truths
relative to the verity ot sideral prediction, which
the testimony of many hundreds of respectable
characters can substantiate, yet I am aware that
the most flagrant and abusive arguments will bw
advanced against the utility of this venerable Sci
ence, by those, who are always ready to condemn
what they are unable to define, or comprehend ;
if such characters are of a different opinion, and
do not believe that the Heavenly Bodies have any
influence on Mankind, they ought to avoid every
portion of censure, and view those who Study the
power, magnitude and motions of the Celestial
Orbs, with pity and regret, for it is absurd and
unji st to deny the truth of what they never pro
ved; but Alas! in the present Age, when bold
Infidelity \& making gigantic movements in this

which contain god's holy word, are frequently

traduced, disregarded, and a considerable portion
of odium, and ignominy levelled against them,
but sacred and Celestial truth in its purity, will
ever reign triumphant over vice, profaneness and
immorality, Those who demand prool of Astral
power on man, may observe, that I have lurnished
them with examples, over which contention, and
hypocrisy are unable to prevail; if the difference
between the Cause and the Effect is required, the
most ample proofs are giventhroughout the Work
which will repel every artful insinuation opposed
to the Study of Stellar power, it would therefore
be inconsistent to attend to arguments advanced
by Infidels, Deists, and Atheists, who generally
use their puny efforts, to stifle and traduce visible
facts of every description, if those facts appear
mysterious to their own comprehension. The
untaught vulgar are generally enemies to Celes
tial truths; their impertinent, and pitiful ribaldry
combined with a large portion of low cunning, in
a moment proclaim an ignoble origin ; but the
ignominious conduct ofsuch characters is beneath
my notice. It is well known that there are some
who remain of opinion, that allowing the time of
every important Event of any person's Life, with
the period of dissolution, to be previously ascer
tained with correctness and precision, by Astro
nomy, or any laudable Calculations whatsoever,
it would prove injurious ; and instead of adminis
tering comfort and consolation to an afflicted mind
a perfect and previous knowledge of those Events,
Wi Till: AUTHOR'S ADDRESS
would be productive of unhappiness and misery.
Such is the nature and extent of the ridiculous
and absurd arguments, which some, who disbe
lieve the Occult power of Sideral agency on man
kind, are disposed to produce, but the Royal
Psalmist was of a different opinion, for his express
and humble desire was, to know his end, and the
number of his Days, that he might be prepared
to meet his God ; but the hardened Infidels ge
nerally condemn every contemplation ot a solemn
and instructive nature, and turn aside, and impi
ously spurn at all admonitions, which exhibit to
them the period, when they must bid a final adieu
to all alluring vices ; then at last on a bed of sick
ness they appear conscious oftheir guilt, and wish
in vain for the return of a few Years, that they
might humbly reconcile themselves to an offended
God, and receive spiritual consolation from every
divine instruction, but Alas ! the number of their
Months are with THEE, they must go hence at
the time appointed, unto that place, where the
wicked cease from troubling, and where their im
pious Tongues will no more be able to utter da
ring eloquence, against the irresistable power of
the wonderous Works of the most high.
All those who are Students in this department
of Astronomy, (in which the infinite Wisdom of
the grand Architect of the Universe is so mani
festly apparent in all his stupendous designs,)
will soon be able to comprehend the primitive
rudiments of this noble Science ; they will not
TO tMX U&ADK&. xvii
meet with any insurmountable difficulties in their
practice, when they diligently apply themselves
to directional Motion and Judgment, as I have
used my best endeavours to make every thing as
plain as possible, by the most familiar examples,
The various opinions on iatk, and the freedom
of the will, are here set at rest for ever, not by
noisy arguments and contention destitute of proof,
but by a combination of visible, and manifest facts
which admit of no human contradiction. Reli
gion in its purity, on which the Law of the Land
is established, cannot unfold to human reason,
more excellencies of the infinite Wisdom, Glory,
and power of uim, who is king of kings, and
lord of lords, than a constant contemplation of
the influence of those Celestial Bodies, which are
the Works of his Hands, and by whose Almighty
power, they are, and were created, for the use of
mortal Man. Religion teaches us to worship the
great Creator in Spirit, and in Truth ; but the
Study of Celestial Philosophy elevates our finite
understanding still more, and displays to us the
certain immortality ofthe Soul, and the boundless
joys of eternal felicity, which are objects of the
greatest importance ; it also exhibits to us the un
speakable Love of the Lord of Hosts to mankind,
and in a moment breaks all the forged shackles
of Priestcraft, and liberates all those who are
slaves to refined Popery ; it exhibits to the rich
Man the time when himself, his offspring, and
relatives, must soon like shadows, vanish, and bo
B

no more : It teaches Kings, Princes and Emperors,
that the silent Tombs wait for the reception of
their earthly Tabernacles, which must shortly be
dissolved ; thus when the understanding of Man
is soaring by contemplation above those Orbs of
Light, we then reflect, that all Terrestrial objects
are ofsmall importance, when compared witheven
an imperfect view of those Celestial pleasures,
which flow from the favour, mercy and goodness
of the Almighty for evermore.
I now conclude, hoping that what I have deve
loped by examples founded on the Basis of Truth,
will ultimately prove of essential advantage to all
genuine Sons of Urania, ior whose Literary ad
vancement I have unveiled and revived, the pri
mitive principles of the venerable Science of
Genethliacal Astronomy.

Thy rules on record, most refulgent shine ;
To thee alone we owe what we profess,
Though other Sages toil'd without success ;
But now we daily prove, that by thy aid,
This Art in darkness, is no longer laid ;
Those Myst'ries now unveil'd, are all as clear
As Light that floweth from each glitt'ring Sphere:
By thy assistance, we may always find,
Important Lessons, for the human mind :
All gloom is now dispell'd, and Man may show,
The certain Fate of Mortals here below,
As in a Glass we view the human face,
So by thy Lectures, all these things we trace ;
Those who may cavil at this Learning ; stand
Amaz'd to see its progress in this Land ;
Thy precepts just, for ever will impart
Truth to each Student in this noble Art,
By which all Facts unfolded to our Eyes,
Are oft survey'd with wonder and surprise;
Through thee, the power of each Star we know,
Though far from all observers here below ;
Strange then it mustappear, that things now plain,
Should very oft be treated with disdain ;
Those Orbs of Light, which roll in order, prove

Solemn the thought ! such contemplation, brings
Us near to him, who is the King of Kings ;
Thou learned Sage, hast taught us to explain,
Those Signs on High, which are not set in vain ;
The tokens lately view'd in yonder sky,
Are seldom to be seen by human Eye ;
Thou art no more, yet thy immortal Name,
Will soar triumphant on the Wings of Fame,
And though insulting Feet may on thee tread,
Now thou hast long been number'd with the dead;
Yet all thy Rules which infidels surprise,
Are daily proved in the boundless Skies,
Sages unborn, thy learning will adore,
Till Sun and Moon and Stars, shall shine no more.

THE TRUE METHOD OF ERECTING A
A Male Child was Born in the City of Lincoln, near the
House in which I now live, on the first of October 1817, at
for'y five minutes past four o'Clock in the Afternoon; the
Latitude ofthe place of Birth is 53" 15' North. Now in this
example as well as all others, the Sun's true Longitude at the
time of Birth must be first ascertained, and then his Right
Ascension, which must be added to the Right Ascension ofthe
time of Birth, when converted into Degrees and Minutes, and
then the true Right Ascension ofthe Midheaven will be found
which is proved by the following computation.
In White's Ephemeris for the Year 1817, on the 0 st of
October, the Sun's place at Noon, is 7Â° 55' of Libra, and on
the second day at Noon, his Longitude is 8Â° 54' of the same
Sign, omitting seconds, the difference is 59', which is the
Sun's motion in 24 Hours, but as the time of Birth is 4h. 45m.
after the Noon of the first of October, I now say, if 24 Hours,
require 59', then 4H. 45m. will give 12', which added to the
Sum's place at the Meridian of tl at day 7s 55', the true Lon
gitude of the Sun at the time of Birth will be 8Â° 7' of Libra.
Now to find the true Right Ascension of the Sun, I look
in the Table of Right Ascension in this Work, and in the first
column opposite 8Â° of Libra, I find 187Â° 21', and opposite to
9s of the seme Sign, the number is 188Â° 16', thedifference is
6*' ; then if l8, or 60' give 55', the 7' of Longitude will re*

MM
quire 6', which added to 187Â° 21', the sum will be 187Â° 27',
which is the Sun's Right Ascension at the time of Birth ; I
now refer to the Table in this Work, for converting Hours
and Minutes into Degrees and Minutes ; then consequently
4h. 45M. will produce 71Â° 15', which added to the Sun's Right
Ascension before found, which is 187Â° 27', and the true Right
Ascension of the Midheaven will be 258Â° 42' ; now to find the
true Degrees and Minutes of the sign corresponding with the
above Right Ascension of the Medium Celi, the operation is
thus ; I look in the Table of Right Ascension, and seek the
nearest number which is 258Â° 2', opposite to 19Â° of Sagittary,
and even with 20Â°, of the same sign, I find 259Â° 7\ the differ
ence is 1Â° 5' ; then if 65' require 60', what will the difference
between the Right Ascension ofthe Midheaven, and the Right
Ascension of 19Â° of Sagittary, (being 40') give ? the number
thus obtained by proportion, is 37', omitting Fractions; so
that 19Â° 37' ofthat Sign are on the Midheaven at the time of
Birth. Then to the Right Ascension of the Medium Celi
258Â° 42', I add 30Â°, which make 288Â° 42', this number is the
oblique Ascension of the eleventh House, and by looking in
the Tables of the Poles of Position in this Work, and com
puting the proportional part for the elevations of the ele
venth and third, twelfth and second Houses for the 15' of
Latitude which exceed 53Â°, the former will become 25Â°
20', and the latter 42Â° 49' ; I then look in the Table of
Oblique Ascension for the Latitude of 25Â°, omitting the
20', and seek the number 288Â° 42', which as 1 have said
before, is the Oblique Ascension of the Eleventh Hotue, and
the nearest number is 288Â° 8', opposite to 6Â° of Capricorn,
and even with 7Â° of the same Sign 1 find 289Â° 12', the differ
ence is 1Â° 4' ; 1 now subtract the Oblique Ascension corre
sponding with 6Â° of Capricorn from the Oblique Ascension
of the Eleventh House 288Â° 42', and the difference is 3^' . then
if 64' require 60', the above 34', will give 32' ; so that 0Â° 32'
ofCapricorn must be placed on the cusp of the eleventh House;
then to the Oblique Ascension of the eleventh 288Â° 42', I
OH GENETHLlAOAL ASTRONOMY. 3
aÂ»ain add 30Â°, and the sum is 318Â° 42', which is the oblique
Ascsnsion of the twelfth, this number I seek in the Table of
Oblique Ascension forthe Latitude of43Â°, which is the nearest
to the required polar elevation, and opposite to 25Â° of Capri
corn I find 318Â° 6', and even with 26" of the same sign, I find
318" 58', the difference is 52', and the difference between the
Oblique Ascension of 25Â° of Capricorn, and the Oblique As
cension ofthe twelfth, 3 IS0 42', is 36' ;Inow say, if52' require
60', what will 36' require, the answer will be, 42', so that 25*
42' of Capricorn are to be placed on the cusp o2he twelfth
Hou;,e. Now to the Oblique Ascension of the twelfth 318*
42', I add 30Â°, and the sum is 348Â° .2', which is the Oblique
Ascenaon of the Ascendant, I then refer to the Table of Ob
lique Ascension for the Latitude of 53Â° 15', and seek the num
ber 348Â° 42', and opposite to 1Â° of Pisces, I find 348Â° 20* end
even with 2Â° of the same sign, I find 348Â° 46', the difference
between these numbers is 26' ; I then sub'ract the Oblique As
cension of1 * of Capricorn, which is 348Â° 20*', from the Oblique
Ascension ofthe Ascendant'being- 348Â° 42', and the difference
is 22', then if26' require eC, the above number, which is 22'
will produce 51', so that Is 51' of Pisces must be placed
on the cusp of the Ascendant. I then add 30s more to the
Oblique Ascension of the Ascendant as above, which is
348Â° 42', and the sum will be 378Â° 42', but as this number
exceeds the Circle, 1 subtract 360Â° from it, and the remain
der 18Â° 42' will be the Oblique Ascension of the second,
Which I look for in the table of Oblique Ascension under
the Pole of 43Â°, and opposite to 2Â° of Taurus I find 18Â° 12',
and even with 3Â° of that sign stand 18Â° 48', then by sub
traction the difference becomes 36', and by subtracting 18Â°
12' from 18" 42' there will remain 30' ; therefore if 36' re
quire 60', then the difference between the Oblique Ascension
of 2Â° of Taurus, and the Oblique Ascension of the second,
being 30' as above, will produce 50', so that 2Â° 50' of Tau
rus are to be placed on the cusp ofthe second ; I then add 30Â°
more to the Oblique Ascension of the second, and the Ob
4 CJhUtaTIAL PHILOSOPHY,
liqne Ascension of the third will be 48Â° 42', this sum I seek
for in the Table of Oblique Ascension under the Latitude of
25Â°, and even will 0Â° of Gemini I find 47Â° 56', and opposite
to 1D of that Sign stand 48Â° 62', the one number being too
little, and the other too much, the difference between theni
i , 50', then by subtracting the Oblique Ascension of 0Â° of
Gemini 47Â° 56' from the Oblique Ascension of the third <8Â°
42', there will remain 46' ; I now say, if 56' require 60', then
46' will produce 49' ; so that 0" 49' of Gemini must be placed
on the Cusp of the third House.
In these computations it must be observed that the Signs,

The sign Aries is intercepted in the Ascendant, and Libra
in the Seventh ; Aquarius is also intercepted in the twelfth,
and Leo in the sixth.
The Geocentric Longitudes of the Planets at the time of
Birth, are calculated asfollow.
The diurnal motion of Saturn in the Ephemeris is 3' ;
but as the proportional part for the time of Birth amounts
only to seconds ; I take the place of that Planet in 0Â° 13' of
Pieces, Retrograde.
The Longitude of Jupiter on the first of October, is 6Â° 41'
of Sagittary, and on the second, his place is 6Â° 51' of that
Sign, then by subtraction his daily Motion is 10' ; I now say
if 24 Hours require 10', the time of Birth 4h. 45m. will require
OR GENETIILIACAL ASTRONOMY 5
2', which being added to the place of Jupiter on the first of
October, his true Longitude at the time of Birth will be 6*
43' of Sagittary.
By the same method the diurnal motion of Mars will be>
20' ; for if 24 Hours give 20', then 4h. 45m. will produce 4',
which added to 20Â° 36' of Gemini, his Longitude is 20Â° 40'
of that Sign.
The daily motion of Venus by subtraction as in the above
Examples, is 1Â° 11' ; then if 24 Hours require 71' ; the time
of Birth 4h. 45m. will give 14', which added to 0" 4', the
true place of Venus will be 0Â° 18' of Virgo.
The diurnal motion of Mercury is 2/' ; now if 24 Hours
give 27', then the time of Birth 4h. 45m. will give 5', which
must be subtracted from the place of Mercury on the first of
October, because he is Retrograde, and his true Longitude at
the time of Birth will be 24Â° 34' of Libra.
The Longitude of the Moon on the first of October, is 14s
32' of Gemini, and on the second, her place is 26Â° 28' of tljat
sign ; now by subtraction, as in all the above examples,
her diurnal motion becomes 11Â° 56'; then if 24 hours re
quire 11Â° 56', what will 4h. 45m. the time of Birth give?
the answer will be 2Â° 22', which added to 14Â° 32', the true
Longitude of the Moon at the time of Birth will be 16Â° 54'
of Gemini.
The computation of the Latitudes of the Planets, at the
time of Birth.
As there is not more than one Minute in the variation of
the Latitude of Saturn in the space of six days, and the same
with respect to Jupiter's Latitude, I take 1Â° 49' South for
the Latitude of Saturn, and that of Jupiter 0Â° 28' North.
The Latitude of Mars on the first of October is 0Â° 30'
South, and on the seventh of the same Month it is 0Â° 19'
South, the difference is 11' in six days, therefore by propor
tion the time of Birth 4h. 45m. will not produce any number,
so that the Latitude of Mars will be 0Â° 30' South.
Then by subtraction according to the above method, the
E
6 CELESTIAL PHILOSOPHY,
variation of the Latitude of Venus in six days is 18', there
fore 4h. 43M. will produce nearly one Minute, which must
be addâ¢d to 0Â° 30', and the Latitude of Venus at the time of
Birth will bo, 0Â° 37' North.
The Latitude of Mercury on the first day of the above
Month is 3Â° 34' So th, and on the seventh it is 2Â° 33' ; the
difference then produced is 1" 1' in six days ; then if six days
or 144 Hours require CI', what will 4h. 45M. the time of
Birth require? the answer will bâ¢ 2' omitting seconds, which
I subtract from 3Â° 34', and the true Latitude of Mercury will
be 3Â° 32' South.
The difference in the Moon's Latitude- between the first
and second of October, is by subtraction, 55' ; then by the rule
of proportion, if 24 Hours require 55', what will 4h. 45M.
give? the Answer is 11', which beine- added to 2Â° 17', the
true Latitude of the Moon will be 2Â° 28' North. The Dra
gon's head at the time of Birth, is 19Â° 56' of Taurus.
From the new Tables of Declinations contained in this
Work, the true Declinations of the Planets are computed,
which are more correct than taking them from White''
Ephemeris.âThe operations are asfollow.
The Declination of Saturn is thus calculated.
His Longitude is 0Â° 13' of Pisces, in which place he has 1Â«
40' South Latitude :âI now refer to the Tables ofDeclination,
and opposite 0Â° of Pisces at the bottom of the Table, with 1"
South Latitude, I find 12Â° 24', and even with 1Â° of the same
siprn with 1Â° South, the number is 12Â° 4', and the difference
20' ; then if 60' require 20', what will 13' ofLongitude give?
Answer 4', which subtracted from 12Â° 24', there will remain
12Â° 20' :âI now equate for 49' of Latitude thus :âopposite
0Â° of Pisces with 1Â° of Latitude 1 find 12Â° 24', and even with
0Â° of the same Sign, with 2Â° of Latitude, the corresponding
number is 13Â° 20', thus by subtraction the difference is 56' :â
Now if 60' give 56', then 49' of Latitude will produce 46',
which added to 12Â° 20' as above, the true Declination of Sa
turn at the time of Birth will be 13Â° 6' South.
OR GENETHLIACAL ASTRONOMY. 7
The Declination of Jupiter is computed as follows.
The Longitude of Jupiter is 6Â° t3' of Sagittary, with 0Â° 28'
North Latitude ;â1 now turn to the Tables of Declination,
and opposite 6Â° of Sagittary with 0Â° North Latitude, stand
the number 21Â° 20', and even with 7Â° of the same sign under
0Â°, I find 21Â° 30'; the difference will be 10' :âThen if CO'
require 10', what will 43' of Longitude give? Answer/' which
added to 21Â° 20', and the sum is 21Â° 27' :âI now compute f r
28' of Latitude ; opposite 6Â° of Sagittary with 0Â° North, I find
21Â° 20', and even with 6Â° of the same sign with 1" of Lati
tude, the number is 20Â° 21' ; the difference will be 59', then
if 60* require 59', what will 28' of Latitude give? Answer 28',
which I subtract from 21Â° 27'> and the true Declination of
Jupiter at the time of Birth is 20Â° 59' South.
The Declination of Mars ia found as follows.
The Longitude of Mars is 20Â° 40' of Gemini, in which place
he has 0Â° 30' South Latitude ;âI again refer to the Tables of
Declination, and opposite 20" of Gemini with 0Â° Sou h Lati
tude, the number is 23Â° 5', and even with 21Â° of the same sign,
and under the same Latitude I find 23Â° 10' the difference is
5' âNow if 60' give 5', then 40' of Longitude will require
3', which must be added to 23Â° 5', and the number is 23Â° 8' <
I now compute for 30' of Latitude :âopposite 20* of Gemini
with 0Â° of Latitude I find 23Â° 5', and even with 20Â° of the
same sign, and with 1Â° of Latitude stand 22Â° 5' :âThen by
subtraction the difference is 1Â° :âI now say, If 60' require
1Â° then 30' of Latitude will consequently produce 30', this
last number obtained I subtract from 23Â° 8' as before found,
and the true Declination of Mars will be 22Â° 38' North.
The Calculation of the Sun'Â« Declination.
The Longitude of the Sun is 8Â° 7' of Libra, 1 then refer to
the Tables of Declination, and even with 8Â° of Libra 1 find
3Â° 1 1', and under 9Â° ofthe same sign the number is 3Â° 34* :â
The difference is 23' :âNow if60' require 23', then 7' of Lon
gitude will produce 3', which added to 3Â° 11', the sum thence
arising will be 3Â° 14' South, which is the true Declination
of the Sun in the Geniture.
8 CELESTIAL PHILOSOPHY,
The following1 is the computation ofthe Declination of Venus.
In the Nativity, the place of Venus is 0Â° 18' of Virgo, and
her Latitude 0Â° 37' North :âI again turn to the Tables ofDe
clination, and opposite 0Â° ofVirgo, with 0Â° North Latitude,
I find 11Â° 29'. and even with 1Â° of the same sign and under
the same Latitude, stand 11Â° 8' :âI now subtract the lesser
number from the greater, and the remainder will be 21' :âI
then say, If 60' give 21' what will 18' of Longitudâ¢ require?
the answer will be 6' , which I subtract from 11Â° 29', (because
the Declination is decreasing by Latitude, which must be at
tended to in all similar cases,) and the remainder will be 11"
23' :âI now equate for 37' of Latitude ; even with O0 of Vir
go with 0Â° ofLatitude, I find 11Â° 29', and opposite 0Â° of the
same sign, with 1Â° of Latitude, the number is 12Â° 24', the
difference is 55' :âThen if 60' require 55', the above 37' of
Latitude will produce 34', which added to 11Â° 23', then con
sequently the true Declination ofVenus will be 1 1 Â° 57' North.
The Calculation oftheDeclination ofMercury isthus wrought.
The Longitude of Mercury is 24Â° 34' ofLibra, in which place
he has 3Â° 32' South Latitude :âI again refer to the Tables of
Declination, and opposite 24Â° of Libra, with 3Â° South Lati
tude I find 12Â° 6', and even with 25Â° of the same sign with
3Â° ofLatitude, the number is 12Â° 30' ; then by subtraction the
difference is 24' :â1 now say, If 60' require 24' ; what will
34' of Longitude give ? the answer will be 14', which added
to 12Â° 6' the sum will be 12Â° 20' :âI now equate for 32' of
Latitude :âeven with 24Â° of Libra with 3Â° of Latitude, I find
12Â° 6', and opposite to 24Â° of Libra under 4Â° of Latitude, the
number is 13Â° 2' ; I subtract the lesser number from thegreater
and the difierencâ¢ is 56''.âI then say, If 60' give 56' what
will 32' require, the answer is 30', which added to 12Â° 20',
the sum then obtained, is 12Â° 50', which is the true South
Declination of Mercury.
The computation ofthe Declination ofthe Moon, is as follows.
The Geocentric longitude of the Moon at the time of Birth
OK GENETHLIACAL ASTRONOMY, 9
is 16Â° 54' of Gemini , where she has 2Â° 28' North latitude
Then in the Tables of Declination, even with 16Â° ofGemini,
with 2Â° North latitude, 1 find 24Â° 43', and opposite 17Â° of
thâ¢ same sign, under the same latitude, the number is2iÂ° 501 :
the difference is 7' :âThen if CO' give 7\ what will 54' of
longitude require ? the answer will be 6', which I add to 24Â°
43', and the sum is 24Â° 49' :âThen to obtain the requisite
number for 28' of latitude, I proceed in the same manner as in
the operations before wrought ; opposite 16Â° of Gemini, with
2Â° of latitude, I find 24Â° 43' ; and even with 16Â° of the same
sign, with 4Â° of latitude, the number is 25Â° 43' ; the difference
is 1Â°:âThen if 60' require 1Â°, consequently, 28' will produce
28', which I add to 24Â° 49', and the sum will be 25Â° 17'. which
is the true North declination of the Moon, at the time of
birth.
The Calculation of the Right Ascensions of the Planets,
with their Latitudes.
The longitude of Saturn is 0Â° 13' of Pisces, where he ha*
1Â° 49' South latitude ;âI look in the tables of right ascen
sion, under Pisces, with South latitude, and even with 0Â° in .
the first column, and under 1Â° of latitude, I find 332Â° 28' ; and
opposite 1Â°, on the left hand,and under 1Â° oflatitude, 1 find 333'
25' the difference is 57':âThen if 60' require 57', the longitude *
ef Saturn, 13', will require 12', which, added to 332Â° 28'
make 332Â° 40', being the true right ascension of Saturn, with
1Â° South latitude. But to equate for the 49' of latitude, I
take the difference between 332Â° 28', under 1Â°, and 332Â° 49'*
under 2Â° of latitude, which is 21' .âThen, if 60* require 21'
what will 49' require ? the answer will be 17'> which, added
to 332Â° 40', the true right ascension of Saturn with his lati
tude will be 332Â° 57'.
The place of Jupiter is 6Â° 43' of Sagittary, and his latitude
28' North :âIn the Tables ofltight Ascension under Sagit
tary North Latitude, and opposite 6Â° on the left hand under
0Â° ofLatitude I find 244Â° 6', and opposite^0 under the above
0Â° oflatitude, I find 245Â° Â»', thÂ« difference is 1Â° 3' ;âThen if
10 CELESTIAL PHILOSOPHY,
60' require 03' the above 43' ofJupiters longitude will require
45', which added to 244Â° 6', the Right Ascension of Jupiter
without latitude, will be 244Â° 51' :âI then subtract 244Â°
6' from 244Â° 17' under 1Â° of latitude, and the difference isll',
then if 60' require 11', Jupiter's latitude being 28' will require
5', which must be added to 244Â° 51' and the true Right
Ascension of Jupiter will be 244Â° 56'.
The longitude of Mars is 20Â° 40' of Gemini, and his latitude
0Â° 30' South, his right Ascension is thus computed. I look
in the Tables of Right Ascension, and opposite to 20Â° of Ge
mini under 0Â°, I find 79c 7, and the next number even with
21Â°, is 80Â° 12', the difference is 1Â° 5' :âThen if 60' give 65^
what will 40' give ? Answer 43', which added to 79Â° f, the
sum will be 79Â° 50' :âthe difference between 79Â° 7' and 79"
12' is 5' :âThen if 60' require 5', the above "0', the latitude
of Mars will give 3', which with the above 79Â° 50', the true
Right Ascension of Mars will be 79Â° 53'.
The Right Ascension ofthe Sun has been computed, and was
found to be 187Â° 27'.
Venus is in 0Â° 18' of Vh\.o, with 0Â° 37' North latitude, the
difference between 152Â° 6' and 153Â° 4' in the Tables of Right
Ascension under Virgo is 58' :âThen if 60' give 58', the
longitude of Venus being 18' will give 17', which I add to
152Â° 6' and the sum is 152Â° 23' :âNow for the latitude which
is 0Â° 37', the difference between 152Â° 6' and 152Â° 27' under 1Â°
oflatitude, is 21' :âThen if 60' require 21' what will 37' give t
Answer 13', which I add to 152Â° 23', and the true Right As
cension of Venus will then become 152Â° 36'.
The place ofMercury is 24Â° 34' of Libra, Retrograde, and his
latitude 3Â° 32' South :âIn the Tables of Right Ascension
under 3Â° South latitude, and even with 24Â° on the left hand I
find 201Â° 5', and under the same latitude opposite to 25Â° stand
202Â° 2', by subtraction there remains 57' :âThen if60' require
57', the remaining minutes of Mercury's longitude being 34',
will give 32', which added to 201c 2 the sum will be 201Â° 37':
The difference between 3Â° and 4* of latitude opposite 24Â° of
OR GENETHLTACAL ASTRONOMY, 11
Libra is 23' : âThen if 60" give 23\ the 32' of Mercury's La
titude will give 12', which I subtract from the above sum
201Â° 37', because the Right Ascension decreases by South
Latitude, and the Right Ascension of Mercury will be 201Â° 219.
The longitude of the Moon is 16Â° 54' of Gemini, where she
has 2Â° 28' North latitude :âThen in the Tables of Right As
cension North latitude, opposite to 16Â° to the left hand, and
under 2Â° of latitude I find 7 13 33', and even with 17Â° under
the same latitude, stand 75Â° 39', the difference between these
numbers is 1Â° 6' :âThen if60' require 661 what will 54' give?
Answer 59', which added to 74Â° 33' the sum is 75Â° 32' :âNow
opposite 10Â° and under 2Â° of latitude I find the number 74*
33', and under 3Â° of Latitude stand 74Â° IT, the difference is
only 6' :âThen if 60' require 6' what will 28' require ? An
swer 3' (omitting fractions in all cases,) which I subtract
from 75" 32', and the Moon's Right Ascension in the Nati
vity will be 75Â° 29'.
Thefollowing is the calculation ofthe Ascensional Dif
ference of the Planets, by which their Semidiurnal and
Seminocturnal Arcs are ascertained, with the Diurnal and
Nocturnal horary times at the time of Birth, under the
Latitude of 53Â° 15' North.
The Declination of Saturn is 13Â° 6', I look for 13Â° in the
Tables of Ascensional Difference, and even with that num
ber under 53Â° of Latitude I find 17Â° 50', and opposite to 14Â°
under the same Latitude stand 19Â° 19', the difference is 1"
29' :âThen if 60' require 89', the 6' of Saturn's Declination
will give 9', which I add to 17Â° 50' and the sum is 17Â° 59' :
The difference between 53Â° and 54Â° of Latitude opposite to
13Â° on the left hand is 42' :âThen if 60' give 42' the 15' of
Latitude which exceed A3Â°, will give 10', which I add to 17-
59!, and the ascensional Difference of Saturn will be 18Â° 9' :
Now having found this number, I subtract it from 90Â° because
the Declination of Saturn is South, and I then obtain the Se
midiurnal Arc of Saturn 71Â° 51', this number I divide by 6,
and I obtainhis diurnal horary times 1 1Â° 58' :âI then subtract
12 CELESTIAL PHILOSOPHY',
the Semidiurnal Arc 71Â° 51' from 180Â°, and the number re
maining, being 108Â° 9', will then be the correct Seminoc-
turnal Arc of the Planet, which also divided by 6, the noc
turnal horary times will be 18Â° 2'.
Jupiter's Declination is 20Â° 59' :âIn the Tables of Ascensio
nal Difference as before, I look for 20Â° on the left hand, and
under 53Â° of Latitude even therewith I find 28Â° 53', and op
posite 21Â° the number is 30Â° 37", by subtraction the difference
will be 1Â° 44v:âThen if 601 give 104" what will 59' give?
Answer 1Â° 42', which added to 23Â° 53', the number is 30*
35' ; the difference between 53Â° and 54Â° of Latitude opposite
20Â° on the left hand I find to be 1Â° 11':âThen if 6tT give
71', the 15" of Latitude will produce 18v, which added to 30*
35', the Ascensional Difference of Jupiter will become 30-
53', which I subtract from 90Â°, because the Declination is
South, and Jupiter's Semidiurnal Arc will be 59Â° 7' which
divided by 6 give his diurnal horary times 9Â° 51':âThen
I subtract the above Semidiurnal Arc 59Â° 7' from 180Â°, and
the Seminocturnal Arc will be 120Â° 53', which divided by 6
the nocturnal horary times thus produced will be 20Â° 9'.
The Declination of Mars is 22Â° 38', then in the Tables of
Ascensional Difference I observe 22Â° and under 53Â° the num
ber is 32Â° 25(, and even with 23Â° I find 34Â° 17", the difference
is 1Â° 521 ; then if 60' give 112', the 38" of Declination will
give 71' or 1Â° IT, which I add to 32Â° 25', and the number
will be 33Â° 36\ the difference between 53Â° and 54Â° even
with 22Â° on the left hand as in the foregoing Examples,
will become 1Â° 22':âI now say, if 601 give 82' what will
15' of Latitude give? Answer 20', which being added to 33*
36', the number thence arising will be the true Ascensional
Difference of Mars 33Â° 56' :âNow as Mars has North Decli
nation, I add the Ascensional Difference thus found to 90Â°,
and the Semidiurnal Arc of Mars will be 123Â° 56( which I
divide by 6, and I then obtain the diurnal horary times 20Â°
313', I now subtract the above Semidiurnal Arc from 180Â°, and
the Seminocturnal Arc will be 56Â° 4', which divided by 6r
OR GENETIILIACAL ASTRONOMY, 13
will give 9Â° 21', being the nocturnal horary times of Mars.
The Sun's Declination is 3Â° 14' : Now in the above Tables
opposite 3Â°, and under the elevation of the Pole 53Â°, I find
3Â° 59', and even with 4Â° under the same Latitude, stand 5'
191, the difference is 1Â° 20' ; then if 60' give 80', the 14 of
the Sun's Declination will give 19', which with 3Â° 59' make
4Â° 18', then the difference between 53Â° and 54Â° of Latitude
even with 3Â° on the left hand, will be 9' :âtherefore if 60'
give 9', the 15' above the Latitude of 53Â°, will produce 2' ;
which added to 4Â° 18', make the Ascensional Difference of
the Sun, 4Â° 20', which I subtract from 90Â°, because the Sun
has>Siow/A Declination, and his Semidiurnal Arc willbe85Â°40',
this number by being divided by 6, will give his diurnal ho
rary times, 14Â° 17' ; then by subtracting the above Semidi
urnal Arc from 180Â°, there remains the Seminocturnal Arc
94" 20', which I again divide by 6, and his nocturnal horary
times will be 15Â° 43'.
The Declination of Venus is 11Â° 571 ; I enter the Tables of
Ascensional Difference with 11Â° on the left hand, then under
53Â°, I find 14Â° 57', and opposite 12Â° the number is 16Â° 23',
and the difference 1Â° 26' :âNow if 60', give 86', then 57'
will give 1Â° 22', which I add to 14Â° 57', and the number will
be 16Â° 19' ; then by subtraction, the remaining difference op
posite 11Â° under 53Â° and 54Â° will become 341 :âThus the pro
portional part for 15' of Latitude will be 8', which I add to
16Â° 19', and the Ascensional Difference of Venus will be 16*
27', which being added to 90Â°, because the Declination is
North, will produce her Semidiurnal Arc 106Â° IT, this num
ber divided by 6, will give the diurnal horary times 17Â° 44',
and the Seminocturnal Arc by subtraction as before, 73Â° 33',
which again divided by 6, the nocturnal horary times of Ve
nus will be 12Â° 16'.
The Declination of Mercury being 12Â° 50', I look in the Ta
ble even with 12Â°, and I find 16Â° 23', under the elevation of
the Pole 53Â°, the next number below is 17Â° 50', the difference
F
14 CELESTIAL PHILOSOPHY,
is 1Â° 27' ; the proportional part obtained as in the foregoing
Examples, is 1Â° 12", which I add to 16Â° 23', and the number
will become 17Â° 35' ; the difference between 53Â° and 54Â°, op
posite 12Â° on the left hand, is 37' ;âThen if 60( give 37', the
15' of Latitude will give 9', which added to 17Â° 35', will pro
duce the Ascensional Difference of Mercury 17Â° >1 V :â1 sub
tract this number as before, from 90Â° because the Declination
is South, and the Semidiurnal Arc is 72Â° 16', and the diurnal
horary times 12Â° 3' ; consequently the Seminocturnal Arc
will be 107Â° 44', and the Nocturnal horary times 17Â° 57'.
The Moon's Declination is 25Â° 17';âIn the Table opposite
25Â° on the left hand, and under 53Â° of Latitude I find 38Â° 14',
and opposite 26Â° stand 40Â°*20', the difference is 2Â° 6' :âthen
if 60' give 126' what will 17( give? Answer 36', which I add
to 3Se 14", and it makes 38Â° 50' ; then for the 15' ofLatitude;
the difference under the elevation of the Pole of 53Â° and 54Â°
opposite 25Â°, is 1Â° 45' ; then by the rule of proportion, if 601,
give 105', the 15' of Latitude which exceed 53Â° will give 26',
which added to 38Â° 50' will produce the Ascensional Diffe
rence of the Moon 39Â° 16' under the Latitude of 53Â° 15' :â
Now as the Moon's Latitude is North, I add the Ascensional
Difference above computed to 90Â°, and I make the true Se
midiurnal Arc of the Moon 129Â° 16', which divided by 6, her
diurnal horary times will be 21Â° 33';âthen consequently
the above Semidiurnal Arc taken from 180Â°, the remainder,
which is 50Â° 44' will be the Moon's Seminocturnal Arc, this
number I also divide by 6, and I obtain the nocturnal horary
times of the Moon 8Â° 27'.
It is to be observed in all cases, that when a Planet has North
Declination, the Ascensional Difference must always be added
to 90Â°, which will produce the Semidiurnal Arc, but when
the Declination is South, the Ascensional Difference must
then be subtractedfrom 90Â°, and the remainder will be the
Semidiurnal Arc required.

There are several Methods of computing and directing the
Part of Fortune, all which differ materially from each other,
being false and groundless ; for it is certain that this point,
(which can only be directed in Mundo,) will continually be
found to preserve the greatest order a<hd regularity in its
movements, being always as far from the Eastern Horizon,
as the Moon is distant from the Sun in the various parts of
the Heavens, Nothing can be more absurd than allowing
it to claim the same Latitude and Declination as the Moon
for by the false Methods that are used, the Moon may be po
sited in the middle of the Tropical Sign Cancer, and the Par
of Fortune near the end of the opposite Sign Capricorn, anc
yet many would allow them both to have North Declination
which in several other similar cases, are inconsistent and un-
demonstrable. Now if the Moon was posited in twelve de
grees of Virgo, and the Part of Fortune in twenty two De
grees of Libra ; then if the Moon in that place had no Lati~
OR GENETHLIACAL ASTRONOMY, 17
fude, most practitioners would allow her to have the same
Declination, when it is evident that one point is North, and
the other South of the Equator ; and then if we were to al
low five degrees of North Latitude to each of those places,
it would augment the Declination of the one point, and re
duce that of the other. I have plainly stated these observa
tions that the Student may no longer be deluded by those
false Rules, which 1 am certain will deceive him in all his
calculations.

I now add the distance of the Part of Fortune from the ninth
to the Oblique Descension of the ninth, being 228Â° 42', which
is found by adding 60Â° to the Oblique Descension of the se
venth, and the Oblique Descension of the Part of Fortune
will be 237Â° 52', which points to 10Â° 26' of Sagittary, where
its Declination is 22Â° 2' South ; and its Right Ascension 248-
49' : its Ascensional Difference then consequently will be 32'
49', that number being subtracted from 90Â°, leaves its Semi
diurnal Arc 57Â° 11', which divided by 6, its diurnal horary
times become 9Â° 32' :âI then subtract its Semidiurnal Arc
from 180Â°, and the remainder will be the Seminocturnal Arc
122Â° 49', which also divided by 6, will produce iU nocturnal
18 CELESTIAL PHILOSOPHY,
horary times 20Â° 28'. The Pole of the Part of Fortune is
never required, because it can only be directed in the Mun
dane Circle.
In all computations when the Degrees and Minutes of a
Planets Longitude exceed those of the House where it claims
its position, it must then be placed past the cusp, according
to the regular succession ofthe Signs in the Zodiac; but when
the Degrees and Minutes of the Stars Geocentric Longitude,
are less than those of the House to which it belongs, then the
reverse Rules must be uniformly attended to, without the
least variation.
I have not noticed the difference between the Meridian of
Greenwich, and that of-JLincoln in this Geniture, because it
is very small, but when the difference in time is more con
siderable, then it must be attended to in all Nativities, by add
ing it to the correct time of Birth if the Longitude be West,
and subtracting it if the Longitude be East of the given place
of Birth.
From the foregoing Calculations, the true Celestial Figure
of Birth, including the requisite numbers for computing all
the Arcs of Directions in the Zodiac and Mundo, stand at

OR GENETHLIACAL ASTROWOMY. 35
The foregoing' Nativity is that of James, the Son ofWilliam
Attersall, who was Born in the City of Lincoln. When
this Child Was about twelve Months old, and in good health,
its Parents applied to me for the purpose of receiving' my
Judgment on its Geniture, which I gave them in few words,
as it is my practice in all cases, not to write long Epistles,
when short and concise observations are sufficient.
As soon as I had attentively investigated the positions of
the Celestial Bodies at the time of Birth, with their Variou'
qualities, and configurations, &c. I was convinced that a
violent Death was certain and inevitable, which was not in
the power ofany human efforts to prevent. I then delivered
my impartial Judgment, which was, that dissolution Would
take ptace at, or before the Age of two years, and as the
Child's Father was then constantly engaged in attending one
of the Packets on the River Witham, I considered it a duty
incumbent on me to admonish its Parents, never to suffer the
Child to go on board the Packet, in consequence ofthe mor
tal Configurations then fast approaching without relief; they
promised to attend to the solemn, and previous warning I
had given, and certainly acted according to my request
having informed them that Death would take place suddenly,
either by a fall, or wound from a Horse, and as Horses were
(in the course of Business,) frequently taken on board the
Packet, I conceived his Death might arise from violence of
that nature ; the fact is, the Child was never suffered to go on
board that or any other Packet, agreeable to my advice. But
mark the unchangeabxe decree ov the oMnipotent
creator, the unfortunate Child was kept as much as pos
sible in the House, and was not suffered to approach any
Horse, nor go on any Navigable Vessel. About ten days
prior te its dissolution, I went to the abode of its Parents,
and told them that manifest danger was at hand ; there were
several persons present, who replied, that ifDeathby violence
should take place, as I had publicly declared, it could not be
, . CELESTIAL PHILOSOPHY,
for want of sufficient warning1. On the day of Death, the
Child went into the Street unobserved by any one, and immedi
ately accompanied several other Children who were playing
very near a Horse that was feeding a short distance from the
Door, near the side of the River. The Horse was always
considered to be a very quiet Animal, but in the fatal Hour,
he kicked at the Children, yet none were injured, except the
unfortunate Child, who received the stroke in its forehead,
which proved instantly Mortal ; his Death happened on the
22nd. of September, 1819, near three o'CIock in the After
noon, Aged oneYear, eleven Months,and twenty days. This
prediction obtained publicity near a Year previous to the time
ofDeath, and there are many per-ons of respectability in this
place, and its Vicinity, who will prove what I have b^ere as
serted to be correct, and beyond the bounds of contradiction,
and ifany doubts remain as to the verity of what I have rela
ted, I request that application may be made to the Parents in
this City, who will establish the truth of what 1 have re
corded.
- But though I have given the hostile primary Directions in
this Geniture, with their true computation as far as the orbs
of the benign Stars are in operation, (which ought to be
strictly regarded in all Nativities,) yet I would not have the
Students to entertain Ideas, that all Children who die in
their infant state, are destroyed by violent Directions to the
giver of Life, &c ; for those who die in infancy, or before the
end of the fifth Year, are generally destroyed by those malig
nant and destructive positions that are formed in the Heavens
at the time of Birth ; as Ptolemy clearly informs us, and not
by Directions, which was the case in this unfortunate Geni
ture, there are also other sideral causes of the utmost conse
quence, which have great and manifest power in destroying
Life within the above period ; for when the significators of
Children are weak and afflicted in the Genitures ofthe Parents,
itwill require but little violence in the Nativity ofthe offspring
OR GENETHLIACAL ASTRONOMY. 37
f
to cut off Life. The great disproportion in the occult power
ofthe Elementary qualities, with the evil testimonies predo
minating in the Radix, as well ss the Mundane stations ofthe
Stars, with their heating, drying, cooling, and moistening
qualities, in the various signs, and parts of the Heaven' in
which they are posited : are all subjects which require serious
consideration, chiefly when death occurs naturally, and must
in all cases be attended to, before final Judgment is given,
concerning the period of personal extinction. .
The Astral causes that produced the sudden and violent
Death of this Child, are plainly visible ; the Ascendant is
afflicted by the Body of Saturn, and Square of the Moon, and
Mars in Mundo ; the Moon is conjoined with Mars among*
evil Stars in the Northern Angle, approaching the Terms of
Saturn, without any relief, and that Luminary is applying to
the Mundane Square of Saturn, by direct motion. The Part
of Fortune is afflicted by the opposition of the Moon and
Mars ; but I judged the work of Mortality to arise chiefly
from the uninterrupted communication of those violent rays
of Mars and the Moon from the Imum Celi, to the Sun, who
is the true Apheta, or giver of Life, particularly because the
Hyleg is near the Body of Mercury, and Rapt Parallel of Sa
turn ; and I shall here observe that Mercury is of the nature
of the enemies in the Celestial constitution.
Thus you see all the vital significators were afflicted at the
time of Birth, and no intervening Rays of a benevolent nature,
could break their force, or counteract their fury ; for Jupiter
is posited near the Heart of the Scorpion, and afflictedby the
Quartile of Saturn, and Venus by the opposition of that Ma
lefic, and also by the square of Mars in Mundo, so that all
benign influence was destroyed, and could be of no avail
whatever, in supporting the Life of the Native.
At the return of the Sun to his radical place, on the first
of October 1818, we find many furious and alarming motions
ofthe Stars, which augment in a great measure, the Effects of
I
38 CELESTIAL PHILOSOPHY,
the other malignant positions in the Radix. At the above
time, Saturn was Retrograde, and posited in the Ascendant,
in Square to the Moon in the Nativity, and that Luminary
and Mars who wore in conjunction in the Imum Celi at Birth,
were conjoined in the Western Angle, on the place of Mer
cury in the Geniture, who was near the Sun's place in the
Nativity. Jupiter was in Square to the Sun's position in
the Radix, and Mercury was in opposition to the radical As
cendant, having' lately separated from the opposite rays of
Saturn. Venus was in a violent part of the Heavens, and
afflicted by the evil Rays of Mercury from zodiacal stations,
being at the same time injured by the hostile beams of Sa
turn and his Terms. These positions of the Stars are a'to
nishing, and certainly prove the great and manifest power
of such motions, when rightly compared with the true places
of the superior significators that have dominion in the Geni
ture. In fine, such furious irradiations were assured testimo
nies of approaching dissolution by violence, but the Mundane
and zodiacal stations of the Stars at the time of Death, were
still more remarkable, when compared with the Anaretic
positions of the Planets in the Radix ;âthere was a new
Moon three Days previous to his dissolution, when both the
Luminaries were in opposition of Saturn, and also in square
to the place of the Moon and Mars in the Nativity. Venus
had the Declination of Saturn, and was combust ; the Moon
was also cadent in the terms of Saturn at the time of Death,
and Jupiter was nearly on the radical place of that Malefic.
When he received the mortal wound, the Sun was afflicted
by the opposition of Saturn, who was Retrograde, and under
the Earth ; such a train of evil testimonies, united with those
corresponding positions, and primary Directions of an Ana-
retical nature in the Radix, are worthy of admiration. These
things every attentive student ought to attend to, as well as
all. the powerful motions of the malignant Stars in the zodiac,
and Mundo, with their occult qualities, as they afflict the
OK GENETHLIACAi, ASTRONOMY. 39
Lights, or the most principal, and superior places of the Lu
minaries, or their Rulers, Avith other significators in the Ge-
niture, and also the progressions and powerful secondary
Directions then in operation ; for when the corroborating
testimonies of the Enemies are violent, and are likewise mul
tiplied at the same time by other applications of an inimical
power, without any benevolent assistance, they then, (as in
this Example,) never fail to destroy Life.
All those litigious traducers (who condemn the Study of
second causes,) may observe, that the fate of this Child was
clearly visible in the Heavens at the time of Birth, and that
no human endeavours could alter, prevent or control the
immutable decree of the most hich. The free will of
the Parents was previously used a long time, in a solemn and
indefatigable manner for the preservation of their offspring,
but in vain, which is well known to the Public. These facts
are too obvious to be denied. The Infidel, the Deist, the
Atheist, and the Critic, (who endeavour to turn every Sacred
subject into ignominy^an'd reproach,) may sneer at these re
marks, but let suchrcharacters advance what scurrilous argu
ments they please, against this Sacred Science, yet they are
in their minds convinced by daily experience that there is
animpending fate, or a something that frustrates, defeats,
and counteracts our actions, and engagements, during Life,
let ns endeavour as we may, for in numberless cases we may
observe, that when our premeditated projects appear success
ful, and even infallible, according to human reason, yet inthe
execution ofthose Acts, something overturns our flattering
schemes, and renders our exertions ineffectual. By these
manifest Facts we may be convinced, (as an eminent writer
observes,) that if all men could arrive at affluence by their
earnest endeavours, more would probably attain to it, than
what at present are seen to do so,
" And this should teach us,
There's a Divinity that shapes our ends ;
Sough-hew them hoy? we will."
40 CELESTIAL PHILOSOPHY,
The next is the Nativity of a Lady, who is now living,
and in good Health. The estimate time of Birth, (which is
given in the following Figure of the Heavens,) was extracted
from the written documents ofher Parents, and I am induced
to believe it is correct, because the benign and hostile Effects
of the antecedent Directions, with their sideral cause, and
periods of operation, correspond with the past occurrences
ofLife. I have computed and arranged the Directions from
the Tables contained in this Work, by which the Reader may
observe that the methods I use in calculation, and Judgment,
are invariably the same in all Nativities, and may be depend
ed upon without error, when they are properly applied, and
rightly understood, according to the Examples 1 have plainly
developed in Directional motion, on which the foundation of
this Sacred Science depends. The true distance between the
Apheta and the Anaretical Promittors, ought first to be com
puted in all Genitures ; for it is certainly contradictory to the
established principles of this department of Astronomy, when
Judgment is pronounced on the Events of the Life ofan Indi
vidual, (whethergood, or evil, with the time thereof,) from
the Effects of subsequent Directions, &c. at those remote pe
riods, after the Prorogator to the mortal train has completed
its final course. There are many, who being ignorant ofthe
true motions of the Heavens, mistake thefirst and chief es
sential cause which offers itself for consideration, and ab
surdly attend to those vague, and unintelligible Directions,
which were to produce Effects after the Native's Demise ; for
if those arrogant pretenders to these Astronomical Calcu
lations are unacquainted with the time, and quality ofDeath,
from a true Nativity, when the Native is living, I am confi
dent they know notbiug of it after dissolution, though they
may vainly attempt to invent something as the probabls
cause of personal extinction, when the Native is no more.

52 CELESTIAL PHILOSOPHY,
The positions of the Planets in this Nativity, are of an un-
propitious Nature, and as their various configurations to each
other, are also of an inimical power, 1 shall therefore make a
few plain observations on their effects, that those, who apply
themselves to this Sacred Study, may form' a decisive and
impartial Judgment on other Genitures, in which similar po
sitions and Directions are frequently apparent, which when
diligently attended to, will give pleasure and satisfaction to
every industrious Student in the noble Science of prognostic
Astronomy.
The Celestial Sign Sagittarius occupies the oriental Ho
rizon, ai.d Jupiter Lord of the Ascendant, and significator of
the Native, is posited in the Ninth House, cadeivt, and in his
detriment, near violent fixed Stars ; he is likewise applying
to the square of Saturn in the Western Angle, without any
assistance from benign Hays, or propitious terms, either in the
Zodiac, or in the AVorld. Mercury who disposes of Jupiter
iu the Radix, is combust, and besieged between the bodies of
the Sun and Mars in the descending part of the Heavens,
wherâ¢ the evil power of the Malefic Stars is augmented by
the Rapt Motion of the Earth. The Moon and Mars, which
arâ¢ the chief Mortal promittors, are very violently conjoined,
and as they approach their subterraneous positions, they con
sequently increase their baneful rays to each other; the part
of Fortune is afflicted by the opposition of Saturn, Lord of
the second, and its dispositor is weak, and deprived of all his
dignities in the Radix ; these positions and violent motions of
the Stars, combined with the evil stations of the Satellite?
of the Luminaries, will (notwithstanding the mundane Sex-
tile of the Sun to the Midheaven, and the Trine of Venus
Tuler of the supreme Southern Angle to the Ascendant in the
World,) always produce sorrows, and many difficulties, with
various calamities during the whole period of the Native's
Life ; and I shall further observe, that in all Genitures,
OR GENETHLIACAL ASTRONOMY. 53
(whether Male or Female,) where such hostilepositions, and
configurations as the above are discovered, those persons
will be subject to contempt, and reproach ; innumerable
troubles, andlosses, with dangers to Life will surround them,
and in the end they will always descend below the sphere
of Life in which they were Born.
There are many methods invented for the purpose of ascer-'
taining the true Hour, and Minute of a Nativity, from the
estimate, or given time of Birth. 1 have tried all the rules>
both Aucient and Modern, in an impartial manner,that have
been published; and in many hundreds of Nativities which
I have calculated, they have generally deceived me in my
computations, and I am certain they will deceive every prac
titioner who may think proper to rely on such preposterous
inventions, which can neither be supported by proof, nor il
lustrated by proper Examples, and Experience : The truth
is, there, is but one trueMethod for correcting the given time
of any Birth, and that method will never fail, when pro
perly understood, and rightly practised; and when the estij
mate time does not exceed its reasonable limits. The Me
thod 1 allude to, is the computation of the Arcs of Directi
ons to the Ascendant and Midheaven, which are the two
superior Angles ofthe Figure, so that when the time of any
important Events* (whether good or evil,) are given, the
true time of Birth may be readily discovered, by comparing
the Numbers arising from the computed Arcs, with the
Years, and Months of the Native's Life, when the corre*
sponding occurrences took place; thus by adjusting the
Directions, according to the nature, and power of the pro-
mittors, &c. in the manner above described, the true time of
Birth will visibly appear without the least confusion pi
error, but when the time of any Nativity is truly taken from
a corrected Clock, or Watch, no rectification will be re
quired. 1 have recorded these important subjects in this
place, because by the above Method, {which 1 daily use in
L
54 CELESTIAL PHILOSOPHY,
jmy practice,) I have proved the time of the foregoing Nati
vity correct, as will appear from the Nature of the fol
lowing Directions ; the Effects of which perfectly corre
spond with the periods of the given Events of Life.
At the Age of twenty-seven Years, the Life of the Native
was in imminent danger from a lingering Illness, which con
tinued upwards of six months. She also suffered much in
jury by a fall from a Horse. The Ascendant was then di
rected to the Opposition of Saturn.
Aged forty-one Years and ten Months, she Was not ex
pected to survive the Effects of an intermitting Fever, which
attacked her with unusual violence, during several weeks ;
this Direction at the same time produced several other cala
mities, and troubles. The Ascendant at that period was di
rected to the Opposition of the Sun.
When the Native was nearly fifty-five years of age, she
was afflicted with another violent Illness, accompanied with
delirium, and hysteric affections, which according to the opi
nion ofher Medical attendants, had every appearance of ter
minating in death ; but after two Months severe sickness,
she was restored to her former state of Health. The Effects
of the Ascendant to the Opposition of Mercury, were in ope
ration at that period.
These three directions of Saturn, the Sun, and Mercury
to the Ascendant, were those which 1 previously selected for
the purpose of proving the correctness of the given time of
Birth, before I commenced the calculation. The Ascend
ant is certainly the giver of Life; according to the Rules
I have given in this Work, for selecting the true prorogator
in all Genitures, and at the Age of sixty-four Years and ten
Months, that Aphetical point will be directed to the oppo
sition of Mars and the Moon, without assistance, the Effects
of which will certainly destroy the Native's Life.
OR GE\*ETHLTACA.L ASTRONOMY. 5>
But though I have stated the time of Dissolution, to prove
the important use of the true Prorogator, 1 shall observe,
that the power of the Anaretic Directions will be consider
ably increased and accelerated under their horary Circles of
position ; for before the mortal promittors descend the Wes
tern Horizon, Hie Terms of both the Malefics, and their Pa
rallels under the Motion of the Primum Mobile, set, with
two Degrees fifty Minutes of Leo, and consequently precede
the deadly train at the age of sixty years and nine months ;
at which time, Life will be exposed to the most alarming
danger by a violent sickness, from which the Native will
never perfectly recover. The Mortal disease will be violent
palpitations of the Heart, with difficulty of breathing, pains
and intlamations in the Breast, and a putrid Fever; such will
be the Nature and Effects of the disease, which will termi
nate the Native's existence in this earthly World.
I have not made any comments on the Events produced
by the Effects of those Directions that are Tabulated in th s
Geniture, from the time of Birth, to the present period tf
the Native's Life, except a few of those computed to the
Oriental Horizon, having omitted such observations to avoid
repetition, as the practitioner will find the Rules for Judg*
mentwith the Effects of all Directions in any Nati-
\'ity, progressively arranged in another part of this Publi
cation.
I have calculated all the preceding Arcs of Directions in
this, and all other Nativities in this Work, from Tabular
numbers, being the only true Method, though the Planis
phere is used by some, whofalsely and impudently affirm,
that for accuracy and expedition, it is far superior to any o-
ther invention ; I have had one ofthose Instruments in my
possession, with all its pretended improvements, several
years, and I flatter myself, that I understand its use as well
as any of those Teachers. This paltry thing at first sight
appears beautiful to behold, in consequence of the various
56 CELESTIAL PHILOSOPHY,
Colourswith which the Signs and Planets, Sfc, are orna-,
merited; but the more it is attentively surveyed, the more
disgusting it appears, with all its visible imperfections'
Most Students are disposed to attend to any inventions
which appear likely to prove advantageous to their pur
suits, but I will ask, Why is so much time sacrificed in Map-;
ping, Colouring, aad1 Ornamenting a piece of Cardboard,
before the Compass, #c. are applied, and which is good for
nothing at last, and why are theSlars and Constellations
whimsically embellished with most of the Colours, which
the understanding of man can devise ? Surely this is not the
right way to instruct the ingenious Students, but it cer
tainly is the Method which Planispheric Teachers (as they
call themselves), adopt to please the Eyes and tease the
Pockets of those, to whom they give artful Lessons of im
provement, Lessons which I am certain many of the
deluded Students will never forget. Some who are advo
cates for the use of this instrument, gravely say, that it
saves much time and trouble, which is a most notorious and
false assertion, for/thelime taken up in Mapping, Colour
ing, and Ornamenting, is much more than able calculators
require in computing the whole of the Directions in any Ge-
niture whatsoever; and when the Arcs of Directions are nu
merous in a Nativity, this thing altogether becomes use
less, as well as the childish Speculum which is generally
attached to it ; J have made these remarks, by which the
Reader may observe, that I do not sanction the use of this
Instrument, (which is only a Globe delineated on a Plane,)
because'jt is deficient in all those parts where true Calcula
tions are required, though it is artfully contrived to attract
the notice of the innocent, and delude the ignorant> and urj.
wary, ' -

cently discovered, I have omitted them in all my computa
tions, being convinced that we have not had any Examples
sufficient to prove the existence of their power, for plain and
manifest reasons, The true and correct places and Revolu
tions, 8fc, of these Planets, are unknown to us at present ; so
that if we were to notice them in our Calculations and Judg
ment, we should soon be convinced of our Errors. 1 know
some will say they have discovered many of their Effects in
Nativities, but those who entertain an opinion of that na
ture, ought to produce substantial proofs of their discove
ries, which I am certain they are unable to explain, tho' if
such persons are inclined to discountenance what I have here
stated, I entreat them not to stand any longer at a distance
but come forward and publish to the world, the result of
their observations, founded on legal examples, and experi
ence.
The Reader will observe, that as there was not suffi
cient room to contain the Characters, Degrees, and Mi
nutesofthe Moon, Venus, and the Dragon'' Head, in the
eighth House, in which they claim their true position ;
the compositor has unavoidably placed them as they now
appear in the preceding Figure ofBirth
58 CELESTIAL PHILOSOPHY,
This is the Nativity of Mr. Thomas Willoughby, a young
Gentleman, with whom I was acquainted, and owing to his
request, and the desire of some of his Friends, when he was
in perfect health, I calculated his Geniture, and immediately
observed, that there were many Anaretical Directions fol
lowing each other, in regular succession to the Moon, the
giver ofLife, which would shew their Mortal Effects, early
in the month of August, 1822, agreeable to the most
accurate computations ; and which, according to my
judgment, would produce personal dissolution, as there were
no benevolent directions to give the least support, or assist
ance to the true Prorogator, when those powerful Directions
were in operation. My previous prediction was verified, as
the time of Birth was taken with the greatest care. He was
born at Hull, in Yorkshire, at the time given in the follow
ing Figure; and departed this life on the 26th ofJuly, 1822,
at. eleven o'clock in the evening, aged twenty-two years,,
seven months and five days-.

OR 5ENETHLIACAL ASTRONOMY, 65
The Tabulated Directions preceding, are those which I
computed for this Gentleman two Years before his demise,
which several of his Friends now living, well know ; but
there is something remarkable in the quality of his Death,
therefore it is my wish that all Students in this Science may
properly attend to the Rules I have laid down in this Work,
concerning the nature, and quality of dissolution in any
Nativity ; for the same Causes will invariably produce the
same Effects, when the Heavens are accurately divided by
duplicate horary times, and the Arcs of Directions truly cal
culated, from the new Astronomical Tables contained in this
Publication.
The Moon is certainly the giver of Life in this Nativity,
and though the Sun is in an Aphetical position, yet he can
by no means claim the prorogatory power, according to the
established precepts and Examples which I have given for
selecting the true Hyleg. This Gentleman was dangerously
indisposed at the Age of Nineteen Years, and I am of opini
on that many pretenders to this Science, would havejudged
inevitable Death at that time, bâ¢cause the Hyleg was then
directed to the Square of Saturn in the Zodiac, that promit-
tor being in the eighth House, which is considered to be their
favourite killing Mansion jn all Genitures. I certainlyadmit
that the Effects of the Direction of the Apheta to the quar-
tile Rays of that Malefic, were of a dangerous nature, but
had not power to destroy Life, because when that Direction
was in operation, the Moon was receivedin the termsofJupi
ter, and his orbs, and was also directed to his Square, by
Converse Motion, she afterwards applied to the Body of Ve
nus in the Zodiae, which must appear evident to the Judg
ment of those who are masters of directional motion ; but
though the above Direction ofthe Moon to Saturn's quartile
was deprived of its mortal influence, yet it clearly shewed
ithe quality of Death ; for Venus in Scorpio, indicates poison,
OR GENETHLIACAL ASTRONOMY, Gd
both by position, nnd Direction, tis she is in square to Sa
turn in the Radix, and both their Directions fall in the
Mortal train to the giver of Life ; therefore my previous
and impartial Judgment was, that the Native's Death
would be occasioned, either by the baneful Effects of im
proper Medicine, or, by poisonous Effluvia, received by
respiration into the Lungs, which would corrupt the Blood,
and ultimately produce Death, the latter of which was the
case, for . Venus, though she cannot save, yet she trans
mits Saturn's malignant Rays to the Hyleg, and joins at
the same time in the Anaretical train of Directions, which
clearly prove the nature and quality of Death, as specified
above.
The Directions which destroyed the Life of this Native,
were the Moon to the Parallel of Mars in Mundo, by the
Rapt Motion, followed by the scmiquartile of the Sun in
the Zodiac, the square of Mercury, in Mundo, by a right
Motion, and by a Converse Direction, the Hyleg was di
rected to the Mundane square of Mars, succeeded by the
Parallel of Saturn's Declination, and also by the zodiacal
Parallel of Mars ; and though the sun was directed to vio
lent promittors near the same period, which doubtless in
creased the Effects of the mortal train to the true proroga-
tor, yet he had no power of himself to destroy Life, because
the Aphetical dignity is claimed by the other Luminary in
this Example ; such Directions as the above will always
destroy Life in any Nativity in which such corresponding
positions, and configurations of the Celestial Bodies, ap
pear to our view, for it is certain that in every Geniture,
when the true significator of Life is strongly dignified, and
free from the contact of inimical beams, one violent Direc
tion to the Apheta cannot produce dissolution, but when
all the vital significators are at the same time united with
G7 CELESTIAL PHILOSOPHY,
baneful Directions, without any assistance from benign
rays, &c. then, and then only, the Effects of one Direc
tion of a violent nature to the Hyleg, will cut off
Life.
In the secondary Directions, the sun was in square to
the moon's place in tho Nativity, and the Hyleg was like
wise conjoined with saturn, near his station at the time of
Birth, and was declining from an opposition to the sun
by those motions, which increased the Effects df the cor
responding primary Directions to the giver of Life, when
they were in operation ; and in the Involutional Figure
for the twenty second Year, the moon was posited on the
place of mars in the Geniture, and saturn and Jupiter
were in opposition to the Radical position of the Proroga-
tor. Venus was then separating from the opposite place
of Saturn at the time of Birth, and mars was in square
to mercury, they being both promittors in the mortal
train ; but in the Progression, the applications of the
chief significators were still more violent ; for the Lumi
naries were both afllicted by the stations of the malefics
from the superior places, and were also superseded by their
terms in those parts of the Heavens where no benign rays
could interpose to counteract their baneful powers ; and
what is more remarkable, that in all these motions, the
antecedent parallels of the Declination of the promit
tors, minutely correspond with the nature and Effects of
the primary Directions in the mortal train, which not
only prove the truth of the computations, but also con
firm the cause of the acceleration, and retardation of the
Effects of all those Directions to the giver of Life, which
have power to produce the work of mortality.
At the time of his Death, Saturn was on the Ascen
dant in opposition with the moon giver of Life in the
OR GENETHLIACAL ASTROXOMt, 68
Nativity, and had descended below the Western Horizon
at the time of his departure. The sun was in quartile
with saturn, and near the Radical place of that male
fic ; mercury was then in exact zodiacal square to the
place of the Hyleg in the Geniture, and was also in di
rect opposition to the place of that Luminary in mundo
at the time of Birth ; I have thus given a brief illustra
tion of all these corresponding motions of the Planets
in their moveable stations, which perfectly represent the
plain, and easy method of discovering the difference be
tween the important Causes and Effects in any Geni-|
ture, which relate to directional motion, and which
when properly understood, will amply compensate every
attentive student, for his researches in this department
of Astronomy.
On GENETHLIACAL ASTRONOMY, 69
The estimate time of the following Geniture, was Febru
ary 5th 1802, Oh/ 40m. P. M. Latitude 53Â° North ; it was
carefully taken by the Aecoucher, who was a Man of the
strictest Virtue, and Fidelity, so that owing to his attention
in recording the Hour, and Minute of Birth, there is suffi
cient reason to believe, that the time given is near truth ; for
it cannot be supposed that a Man, on whose Character and
Reputation, the malignant Breath of slander had never
blown, would give a false tinte to deceive the Calculator.
The Natives Relatives and Friends, (acting under the pollu
ted Banners of Priestcraft 5) are enemies to these Astrono
mical enquiries, and do not believe that the Celestial Bodies,
as second causes, have any influence on the Actions, and
affairs of Mankind ; so that they at once deny the existence
of those things, which they, and their Offspring daily see,
andfeel, and which are proved to be continually visible by
numberless Examples. It must appear ridiculous, and conr
temptible, in this enlightened Age, when such characters,
fnot mutilated by the profound Literature they possess,)
endeavour to traduce the common rules of Arithmetic, on
which the immoveable foundation, and admirable structure
of this venerable Science depend. How wretched and su
perficial must the minds of those persons be, who, impiously
condemn what they cannot comprehend ; they insolently
slander the works of the Creator, and treat their power and
operation with ridicule and disdain, because they are unable
to define the Sideral Causes which forebode, and produce
the various, and visible Effects on the Life of Man ; thus
being foiled in their superficial researches, they then have
recourse to visionary Themes, which they adopt to amuse
the credulous, and impose on the unlettered part of Man
kind. Some of these pitiful deceivers, and licentious im
postors pretend to know the state of Mortal Man after dis
solution, and impudently affirm that they are qualified to

am not disposed to sanction any of those Chimeras which
deg rade the human understand i'.ig : for how can 1 depend on
thejudgment oi those, who are unable to prove one single
Fact to the satisfaction of any rational inquirer. It is much
to be regretted that many are to be found, who pretend to
resolve those Mysteries which relate to a Life immortal, and
'which the feeble, and finite imagination of Man, is unable
to comprehend.
The Popish Priests, when in their sables clad,
Would prove their Trade, but proof cannot be had ;
With hands unclean, to Metaphors they fly,
To solve their Chimeras, beyond the Sky;
But all in vain, their Tricks now old and stale,
Are disregarded as an idle Tale;
O irksome Priestcraft, hide thy gvilty head,
There is ONE GOD, the Judge of quick and dead.
But though it may be consdced that I have made a di
gression in this place, yet I shall not apologi. e for so doing,
for the well known subjects which I have here introduced,
are of recent date, and ought to be faithfully handed down
to future Generations. The Study of Genethliacal Astrono
my, shews forth the incomprehensible wisdom, powfr,
and glory of ONE OMNIPOTENT CREATOR in his
wonderous Works, and i. far superior to those debased prin
ciple* of refined Popery, which are now become a Stalking-
horse, to answer every vile, and nefarious purpose that hu
man reaton can devise. Such feigned delusion and detestable
dut licity, (being pious Mockery in its odious garb.)&TS
frequently practised by such as are guilty of crimes not
Kit to be named. Many of those cold blooded monster*
of iniquity, (who reside near the place where this Native
Wm Born,) are well known to the Public, their Names are
OR GENETIILIACAL ASTRONOMY, 71
already written with hvman gore, which will not be oblitem
rated by time. We hare v iewed those immaculate Canni
bals, and their Offspring. in the act of devouring the Flesh
of their fellow Mortals, and have seen them quaff the blood
of innocent and defenceless Orphans, ihe.se well known
facts clearly prove, that there are Beings yet prowling on
the Earth in the human form, who have bid adieu to Mola
lity, humanity, and honesty, having artfully destroyed
those whom they ought to have protected, iaopen violation
of the sacred trust reposed in them. It is notorious to
observe, that under the Mask ofprostituted Piety, Priest
craft, and. hypocritical Friendship, the most atrocious
Acts of premeditated Murder, Plunder, and Villany, have
been accomplished, which will ever ditgrace the human
Character, in an enlightened and civilized Nation.
But though we cannot view such diabolical actions as those
above recorded without indignation and horror, yet there
is a crime of a more heinous Nature committed by those who
have yet escaped the hand of the Executioner. The Sacred
writings inform us, that the Almighty destroyed two ofthemo.st
magnificent Cities in the World, by Fire and Brimstone from
Heaven, because there were not ten rigrhteous persons to be
found therein. All were guilty of the most horrid, unna
tural, and detestable Crimes. Those personages who as
sume the presumptions habit of Piety, and who are now
moving in apparent affluence, ought to reject, thai there is
an Eye that never slumbereth, and the time is fast approach
ing, when divine vengeance will overtake them. It is
certainly the duty of an \uthor to expose by every just, and
proper means in his power, and in the strongest Language,
the Malignancy of a crime of this description, which is ma
king considerable progress in this Nation, with all its hor
rid, and dreadful consequences. The treacherous and blood
thirsty pettifogger, and the polluted pof-ish priest,
72 CELESTIAL PHILOSOPHY,
dare not appear before the Bar of an Earthly tribunal, to an
swer the horrid charges exhibited against them ; but they
put a period to their existence, and thereby evaded the pre
sence of a Mortal Judge, to appear before HIM WHO IS
IMMORTAL ; and who will "Judge the World in righte
ousness, and the People with Equity".

OR GENETHLIACAL ASTRONOMY. 79
In taking a view of the Significators of Riches in the foregoing .
Geniture, we find strong, and powerful testimonies, which show a
sufficient portion of Wealth.â The Lord of the second, is in his
exaltation, angular, and applying by a Mundane sextile to the
Cusp of the second, and its dispositor is in the Northern Angle,
in his dignities, and in the Cardinal Sign Capricorn, disposed
of by Saturn, ruler of the Imum Coeli, who is conjoined with
Jupiter above the Earth, and free from all affliction; these
positions, without the aid of other concurring testimonies, clearly
denote a competent property, which the Native will enjoy, during
the short period of life.
I shall make a few observations on the Religion of this Native.
The general significator of Piety, and Virtue, is Jupiter, who is
Retrograde, in his detriment, and afflicted by the Body of the
greater Malefic, who is also Retrograde, and afflicting the Ascer.-
dant. Mercury Lord of the Ninth, is combust ofthe Sun, in u
violent sign, and his dispositor, as well as himself, are deprived of
all their powerful Dignities; from which it is plain that the
Religion ofthe Native is a deceitful, vain, and fanciful show, let
the Native's pretensions in society be what they may; and as the
Ascendant is afflicted by the Mundane square of Mai's, united
with the baneful rays of Saturn, and Mercury, they instil a consid
erable portion of pride and insolence into the Native's Mind, which
is further proved by the ruler of the Ascendant applying to the
Rapt Parallel of Mars, in the Radix; thus it becomes obvious,
that suchfeigned Religion is a something that wants a name,
set forth to pick the pocket of the simple, and to show the Na
tive's Vanity, Hypocrisy, Insincerity, Superstition and Folly,
Jn this Geniture the Ascendant is the giver of Life, as all the
Planets are under the Earth, except Saturn, and Jupiter, and
neither of them can claim the Apheticai power; therefore the
Eastern Horizonis the point which must be seleeted to determine
the time of the Native's Death.
n3
CELESTIAL PHILOSOHHYv ^
The ridiculous, vain, and romantic Hypothesis given by Mr.
Wilson, who, in his dictionary op errors and contradic
tions, page 31 1, says, that both the Luminaries under the Earth,
in the Nativity of Philip the 3rd were Hylegiacal, he also mforms
us, that the Moon on the Cusp of the third House, was Hyleg
in the Nativity of the Child who was drowned, about the age23 of
three years; these Genitures he has selected from Placidus, to
prove his groundless opinion, that the Luminaries under 'the
Earth are Hyleg in any Geniture, and he further observes, " nor
will all the crude formal dogmas of Ptolemy persuade me to .the
contrary'', but he has left the subject in obscurity, without any
proofs whatsoever; then in page 308, he mentions the "foolish
doctrine of Ptolemy' , yet after all the unbecoming insult levelled
againit the dumb a^hes ofthe dead, he has in page 159, (and
in direct contradiction to his former assertions, ) affirmed, that
"amidst this vast heap of incongruities, 1 would advise the Student
to confine himself chiefly to the Rules laid down by Ptolemy,
which are by far the most rational.'' . ,
The learned Cardan strictly adhered to the genuine principles
of Ptolemy, and acknowledged that whenever he deviated from his
Doctrine, he was placed in confusion, and error. The precepts
delivered by Ptolemy, for selecting the Prorogator, which I itave
given in this work, are clearly illustrated by examples, and those
who attend to their application, will soon discover the luminous
Facts they unfold to the Students in this Science. .Mr. Wilson
is, I believe, the only Author, who has the effrontery to affirm,
that the Luminaries, under the Earth, are Hylegiacal, contrary to
the Rules of Ptolemy, and repugnant to Ileason, and daily expe-.
rience. I have made these remarks that the Student may not
be led astray by those fanciful innovations, promulgated to deceive,
annoy, confound, and mislead all those who adliere to such
false, and delusive Notions. In the \n e ;> ding Geniture, the
Student may observe,, that both the Luminaries are under the
Earth, and at the Age oftwenty one years and ten months, the
OR GENETHLIACAL ASTRONOMY 81
Sun was directed to the opposition of Saturn, followed by^the
Moon to the Square of Mars in Mundo, and also by his quartile
in the Zodiac, which ought, (ifthe Luminaries under the Earth
are Hylegiacal,) to have given dangerous Sicknesses, and misfor
tunes, but no such Events took place, as he then enjoyed a good
state of Health. I could produce more than one hundred
examples of a similar nature, to prove, that the Luminaries, when,
in a subterranean position, cannot possess the Aphetical power to
destroy Life, even when they meet a train of violent Directions,
except when the Lights are within the prescribed limits of the
Eastern, and Western Horizon, by which they then claim the
Hylegiacal Dignity.â Butsome will probably ask, if I allow the
Directions of the Luminaries under the Earth, to the baneful con'
figurations ofthe Malefics, to give dangerous Sicknesses, Accidents,
and other misfortunes ? I certainly admit that such Directions,
when they shew their effects, will produce diseases, troubles, and
Losses, &c. when the Malefics possess their own Nature in the
places where those violent Directions finish their course; but when
the reverse takes place, and the obnoxious rays of the Promittors
become considerably diminished, by the Terms of the Benefics, &
their directions, then their malignant power becomes weak, and
unable to produce any serious injury to the Health, and affairs of
the Native, so that in many cases they pass over, and cannot pro
duce any visible effects whatsoever.
I have observed before that the Ascendant is the giver of Life
in this Nativity, and therefore in few words I shall inform ths
Reader, that when that point of the Heavens is directed to the
Sesquiquadrate ofthe Moon in Mundo, at the Age of thirty two
years, and eight months, followed by the Mundane square of the
Sun, Life will be destroyed, as there is then no benign assistance
that can impede the violence of their Anaretical power, for I
consider the Luminaries, and also the benevolent Planets in this
Geniture to be weak, as well as those parts of the Heavens where
they exercise their dominion over Life, but it is not from thÂ«
82 CELESTIAL PHILOSOPHY,
Effects of the above Directions alone that I award this Judgment,
but from the combined power of other Motions, which noi being
remote, co-operate with the destructive positions, and direction? of
the Mortal Promittors from the Oriental Horizon, and Supreme
Southern Angle. Now the Nature and quality of Death must
be defined from the active power of those Directions that follow in
the train, and as the Sun, and Mars, have considerable dominion
in those places, it is certain that the dissolution of the Native will
be occasioned by a violent Fever, with pains at the Heart, disorders
in the Reins, and Mesentery, and as the Lungs will be consider
ably affected at the same time, it further shows, that the powerful
Effects ofsuch diseases, cannnot be alleviated in the least degree
by the most judicious assistance of the Medical practitioner.
OR GENETHLIACAL ASTRONOMY. 83
The following Nativity is that of Joseph Kent ; this Child
lived with his Parents, in the City of Lincoln, and on the twelfth
of July, 1824, in consequence of his not returning home from
school at the usual time in the Evening, his Relatives Were
alarmed for his safety, and applied to me, on the morning of the
following day, requesting my Judgment, whether he was living, or
dead ; they informed me that he was born at Liverpool, on the 6th
of June, 1817, at half past eleven at night, and further observed
I might depend that the time of his Birth, was exact, being
taken by his Father, (who is now living,) with the greatest care
and attention ; As soon as I had observed that the Effects of the
mortal Directions to the true Hyleg were then in operation, and
that all the secondary significators of Life were likewise afflicted,
both by position, and Direction, without any relief from benefic
irradiations, the giver of life being angular, in Pisces, a sign of
the watery Trigon, with Saturn, & applying to the Body of that
Malefic by a converse Motion, and also to the Zodiacal Parallel,
and conjunction of Mars, by a direct Direction; I then delivered
my Judgment, that the Child was drowned, and told those who
applied to me on this melancholy occasion, that the River, which
had been superficially examined, ought to be more diligently
explored, which was accordingly done, and the Body was found
near the Swivel Bridge, though all signs of Life had disappeared;
these facts are well known to the Inhabitants of Lincoln. I have
inserted this Nativity with the following directions, & judgment,
which will doubtless be considered as an interesting Example, by
all those who are seriously inclined to investigate, and prove the
true principles of this Heavenly Science.

88 CELESTIAL PHILOSOPHY1,
Those who will take the trouble to examine the Rules I have
laid down in this work, relative to violent Deaths, and apply them
in a proper manner hi the Nativity of this Child, will immediately
discover, that the obnoxious positions of the Celestial Bodies
minutely correspond with the quality of the Native's1 dissolution.
The Moon who claims the Aphetical power is posited between the
Bodies of both the Malefics, in the Ascendant, in a Watery Sign,
and in that station she is deprived of sufficient support from the
Benefics, both ofwhich are afflicted in their radical stations; the
giver of Life is in square to the Sun, and Mercury .in the Zodiac,
and applying to the Mundane quartile of the Sun by Converse
Motion, that Luminary being' posited in the Northern Angle,
among violent Stars, in which place he becomes configurated with
Saturn, by a baneful square in the World. The Ascendant is also
afflicted oy the quartile of the Sun in Mundo, and the Part of
Fortune-is in opposition to the Sun and Mercury, and in mundane
Square of the Moon, and Mars in the Nativity; thus we may
clearly observe that both the Luminaries, the Ascendant, and
Part of Fortune, are all afflicted in this Geniture, which forebode
a sudden, and violent Death, by suffocation or drowning, which
happened as I have before related.
This Child was drowned at the Age ofseven years, one Month,
and six days, and the Directions that destroyed Life, (which
shewed their effects at the time of Death,) were the Moon Hyleg,
to the Body of Saturn, by Converse Motion, and also the parallel
Declination of Mars, and body of that Malefic in the Zodiac, and
Mundo ; those Directions, with all others may be' seen in the
preceding Table, and though the giver of Life applied to the sex-
tile of Venus, and trine of Jupiter, yet those applications could not
produce any important assistance, because both the benefics were
afflicted in the Nativity ; for Jupiter is retrograde, near the Heart
of the Scorpion, in square of Saturn, and in mundane Parallel
with the Sun, and applying to his opposition, Venus is also
Rotiograde, near the Pleiades, and inexact parallel with Mercury
OR GENETHLIACAL ASTRONOMY. 89
in Mundo, where she becomes posited in the terms of both the
Enemies; thus we may observe that though the apparent benign
rays of Jupiter and Venus could not preserve Life, neither by
position, or direction, yet owing to their Motions the fury of the
Mortal Directions to the Hyleg were retarded for a time in pro
ducing their Effects, which will always be found to occur, wher
ever such configurations are prevalent in any Geniture whatsoever.
By Secondary Motion the Sun was in conjunction 'with
Mercury, and the Moon the giver of Life, had nearly arrived at
the place of the Sun in the Nativity, and was applying to the
Square ofher radical position, and likewise to the rays of Mars,
the chief mortal promittor in the Geniture, these obnoxious appli
cations, compared with the violence of the Progression, considerably
increase the baneful power of the Anaretical Directions to the
Prorogator. In the Revolutional Figure for the seventh Year of
the Native's age, the Moon was in a violent part of the Heavens,
and separating from the opposite place of Mars in the Nativity ;
Jupiter was also in Square to the place of Mars, and that Malefic
was applying to the opposition of his own radical station. Saturn
and Venus were conjoined in a subterranean.position/ among
violent fixed Stars; those Planets, with Mercury, having nearly
the same Declination; all these testimonies fully corroborate the
Mortal power of the primary Directions to the giver of Life, as
well as the correctnes' of all the corresponding calculations. At
the time he was drowned, the Sun, Jupiter, and Venus were in
conjunction in the watery sign Cancer, and descended below thÂ«,
Western Horizon, with Castor, and Pollux ; they were likewise in,
Square to Mars, who was separating from the Opposition of his
place in the Nativity, and Saturn had then returned to the
quartile of his own position at the time of birth. The giver of
Lifo was also near the radical Horizon, afflicted by the baneful
stations of the Enemies, at the time of his deathâ  , t ,
CELESTIAL PHILOSOPHY,
Samuel Portwood Was Born at Donington near Spalding,
Lincolnshire, on the 5th of June 1790, 18h. 55M. P. M. he
Was the Son of William Portwood, Farmer of that place. In
the month of October 1821, this young Man ( with whom I
Was well acquainted, ) applied to me. and gave me the above time
of his Birth, requesting me to calculate bis Nativity, which I
performed, and delivered the Figure, and Directions to him in
cluding my impartial Judgment thereon; he hod a little know
ledge ofthis Science, which he had obtained from my Books, and
Papers, and appeared confident that the given time of his Birth
Was correct, of which I have no doubt, as the nature of the primary
Directions is confirmed by the preceding events of his Life. He
told me that he had gained considerably by Land jobbing, and
Was very lucky, though the Moon, and Saturn, in the Midhcaven,
he thought, should have given something far different, according
to the Works of all those Authors he had read on this Science ;
he further observed with a smile, that the evil conjunction of the
Moon, and Saturn in the Zenith, could do him no harm, because
by their different Latitude, they were far distant from each other,
and Jupiter was posited in the second House, with the Lion's
Heart; Itold him that all his observations were founded on error,
as other Astral Causes of a different nature, were the Auxiliaries of
his success, which would continue but a short time, when Land
jobbing, and Life would be no more, for I never knew the least
portion of durable good to flow from a Treasury of evil; I also
informed him that though he had many Books, Papers, and
documents of mine in hispossession, which I expected he would
peruse to the time of his Death, yet there was one that surpassed
all others, on which the following words were written.â"Prepare
to meet thy God,for soon thou shall surely Die."
I quickly discovered that my admonitions were but little regard
ed, I then told him he was not aware that the Moon was Hyleg,
or giver of Life, and would encounter those terrible Anaretical
Directions in the Snmmer of 1 824, which would cut off Life, tÂ»
OR GENETHLIACAL ASTRONOMY 9X
which he replied, that as the Birth was by Day, the Sun, he
believed was the true Prorogator, because he was posited in the
Eleventh House; I informed him that according to the Sun's
position, he certainly was not qualified to claim the Aphetical
power, which a short time would prove, because that Luminary
had not arrived at that part of the Eleventh, where he claims his
full, and perfect Hylegiacal Dignity; I further observed that
there were other arguments to prove, that the Sun could not be the
Prorogator, for if that had been the case, his Direction to the squares
ofthe Moon, and Saturn in the Zodiac, united with the Sextile
of Mars, in Signs of long Ascensions, followed by the body of
Mercury, and all in Cardinal Signs, would have destroyed Life
several Years ago, instead of which, those Directions when they
shewed their effects, produced only a dangerous fall from a Cart,
with a few bruises, including troubles at the same time. The
Figure of Birth with the Directions follow, according to true
Astronomical Calculation.

This- Native lived at Donington, where he was Bora, and for
tome yearsprevious tohis Death, was a writer to Benjamin Smith,
an Attorney at Law/ at Horbling, Hear Folkingbarrr, Lincoln
shire. Those who view the malignant conjunction of the Moony
and Saturn in the Zenith, in- Square to Mercury in Cardinal
Signs, will instantly discover circumstances of a most remarkable
Nature. When in Health, he witnessed the destruction of the
foes of a certain individual; he was cut down in the early part
of Life like a Plower of the Field, according to the JndgmenA
I had given three Years prior to his demisev the truth of which'
can atany time be proved; but though he had obtained MY 0OCO-
mevts which showed that the King of Terrors, was nearly at
the Door of his dwelling, to execute his final summons, yet hÂ»
would not be convinced that the Moon was Hyleg, he therefore
paid but little attention to my Judgment, strictly, and absurdly
depending on the Sun as the right pror-ogator,- which he vainly
believed, promised him Health, and old Age, though that Lumina
ry was certainly the chief mortal Promittor in the Radix, and
thus instead of producing long Life to the Native, ho ushered in
Death at a period but little thought of, and by no means expeoted,
according to all human appearance. Several unbelievers in this
Science whose true Nativities I have in my Possession, and who
are yet living near the same place, must with their Offspring, suffer
severe calamities, and in a fete Year*, "pass that Bodfn from
Whence no Travellers return", leaving their sAKteifl13E H8firJStdbfll
bad in remembrance, by Genetations yet nnborrf.
Both the LtirairiarieS, and Ascendant arte afflicted in the Radix,

98 CELESTIAL PHILOSOPHY,
the weakness of the Moon the giver of Life, and her affliction
without Auxiliaries, convinced me, that when that Luminary
was directed to the Rapt Parallel of the Sun, followed by his
Mnndane Square, Converse Motion, with the other vital significa-
tors afflicted at the same time by IValefic Directions, the Native
would exchange this mortal Life, for a state of immortality, the
truth of which was verified, for though the Directions of Jupiter,
and Venus are conjoined, yet they could not save, owing to the
Terms ofthe Enemies being united near the Anaretical places;
it must also be further observed, that when the Moon
was directed to the mundane Square of Jupiter, and also to
the Parallels of Venus in Mundo, by Direct, and Converse
Motion, their apparent benign power became null, and void, be
cause they Were both afflicted by the same Directions of Saturn in
the World, and by Mars also in the subsequent Motions, this
example, (which I have handed down to posterity, with others,
for the Instruction of the Students in this Sublime Science,)
clearly prove, that it is the true Prorogator alone, that must be
strictly attended to in all cases of Life and Death. The Native died
on the 16th of October. 1824 ; Aged thirty four Years, four
months, and ten days.
By Secondary Direction, the significators of Life, and Death
were violently disposed, which may be seen by comparing them
with the mortal Directions that were in action at the time of
dissolution. The Progression also corresponded with the Effects
of the hostile Motions, and concurring Declinations, and Terms;
the Moon separated from the quartile of Mars, and applied to the
Body of Mercury, and aUo to the Square of Saturn from Cardinal
Signs, by the other subsequent stations; thus by t he preceding
applications, Mars had returned to the place of the moderator in
the Nativity, and both the Luminaries were also in obnoxious
places without any relief from benevolent applications, either in the
Zodiac, or in the World. The Revolutional Figure for his
thirty fourth Year was violent, the Sun being within the Orbs of a

conjunction with Saturn, and that Malefic was among violent star'
conjoined with Venus; the Moon the giver of Life was afflicted
by the body of Mars, and had returned to the opposition of her
own Radical place, Saturn, Venus, and Mercury having the same
declination, and Mars was at the same time posited in the Nadir,
ia opposition to the place of the Prorogator at the time of Birth,
and was also in Mundane Square to the Radical Ascendant
A^bort time after 1 had Calculated the fieniture of .tfiis ffa-
tive, 23he requested me to make a few observations on the Nativity
ofhis Daughter, Melicent, who is now living at Donington, 1
therefore complied with 'his request; he told me that the time of
hpr Birth was carefully tdken by himself, and mighthe depended
on as correct; he also said 'that I was welcome to make what re
marks I thought proper upon it, for the benefit ofthe Science, hut
owing to his engagements, he had but little time to apply himself to
the Study of its principles; he requested me repeatedly, to be as
particular as possible in my calculations, relative to the length of
Life, for it appeared to him that both the Luminaries contended
for the Aphetical Dominion, which is by no means the case, for
as the Birth is diurnal, the Sun being in an HylegiactJ station is
certainly the legal, and true Prqrogator, and supporter of Life,
until his power becomes destroyed by the mortal union, and Di
rections of the Anaretical Promittors without assistance,
which will appear evident from the following display of the Celes
tial Bodies at the time of Birth, united with the Tabulated Arcs
of Directions.

106 OR GENETHLIACAL ASTRONOMY.
This Native's Father, as I have said before, had a little
knowledge ofthis Science; and as he had previously investigated
the Geniture of his Daughter, by position, (not being able to com
pute Directions,) there is no doubt that he observed the Moon was
posited in that part of the Heavens, which would have qualified
her to receive the Prorogatory Dignity, if the Sun had been pos
ited at a more remotâ¢ distance from the Zenith ; for if the time of
Birth had been twenty-five minutes later, then it is certain that the
Moon would become the giver of Life, and that no Directions,
however Malefic to the Sun, could produce dissolution, though
their Effects would be attended with dangerous consequences;
these considerations induced him to be more urgent to receive my
Judgment; I told hira that as he wished to have the Directions
computed with accuracy and precision, he might depend that my
exertions should be used to give him satisfaction, respecting the
length of Life in particular, which he received from, me, and
which he appeared remarkably anxious to ascertain.
The distance of the Moon from the Meridian, is 35Â° 5', and
her Semidiurnal Arc, 73Â° 11', consequently her distance from
the Oriental Horizon, becomes 38Â° fi', these numbers produce
her distance from the Eleventh, 10Â° 41', and her true Polar
Elevation 32Â° 43', under which her Oblique Ascension is 218Â°
29', these distances manifestly show, that though the Moon is in
an Aphetical position, yet according to the given time of Birth, no
Malefic Directions to that Luminary can produce Death.
That the Sun is the true Prorogatof, or giver of Life in this
Nativity, does not admit of any doubt whatever; therefore it is
from his Directional Motion, that the length of Life must be
ascertained; his true distance from the Zenith, is 37Â° 30', and
his distance from the West, 75Â° 14', which give his Pole of
Position 24Â°, and his Oblique Descension, 145Â° ] 8'. Now
the first Direction that the Hyleg meets with, that will put Life
CELESTIAL PHILOSOPHY, 107
in danger, is the Parallel of Saturn's Declination, which the Sun
encounters in 11Â° 58' of Virgo, the Oblique Descension of that
point, under the Sun's circle of position, is 166Â° 33', from that
sum the Sun's Oblique Descension under his own Pole being
subtracted, the Arc of Direction will be 21Â° 15' ; by the same
method, the Sun to the zodiacal Parallel of Mars, opposition of
Saturn, Body of Mars, Semiquartile of the Moon, with the
zodiacal Parallel, and Body of Venus, may be easily, and cor
rectly computed, without much trouble, or difficulty; for by
turning to the Tables at the end of this Work, and taking out
the proper numbers, and using them according to the given precepts,
the Directions will then be immediately discovered, not by chance,
or anyJuggling Art, but by the true, and unerring principles ofthe
Noble, and incomparable Science of Astronoiny.
From the Nature and Effects of those violent primary Directions
to the Prorogator before mentioned, united with the powerful
secondary Motions, &c'.. it is evident that they will produce (by
their furious velocity,) tiie greatest dangers to me i'ative's
life which human aid cannot prevent, at the Age of twenty-five
Years, and eleven Months; there are also other Malefic Directi
ons, that will be in operation to the Ilyleg, upwards of two years
prior to the above period, which will increase the power oi the
baneful applications in those Terms, and parts of the Heavens,
where the Progressive Directions correspond.
Objection. You inform us in your Work, that the Direc
tions of Jupiter, and Venus, when they arejoined in a violent train
to the giver of Life, will impede the fury of the evil Effect*
portended ; how is it then that you do not notice the -power of
Venus in this Nativity, she being in conjunction with Mars, and
Opposition of Saturn at the time of Birth, and as her parallel of
Declination, and conjunction to the Hyleg follow in Directional
Motion, why ought she not to dissolve some part of the evil, and
J08 OR GENEfHtfACAL ASTKONOMY.
saVfetHe Native from &xmddng&s to Life, you- few* w
positively freditfedt
Answer. I dÂ» affirm that tke Directions of Jupiter* and
Venus, will certainly impede the power of a violent tram of Direc
tionsto the giver of Life, in any Nativity, when they are strong,-
freefront affliction, and joined with them, either* in thâ¢ Zodiac-,
or in Mundo, but though these are my rules, which will not deceive
the practitioner, yet from the same precepts sufficient is recorded to
prove, that when the Benefics are unable to produce assistance, in
consequence of their impotence, and affliction in the Radix, or MM
those places where the Directions fall, they then show the nature^
and quality of thâ¢ disea'e, or Death, which is frequently of a
violent nature ; therefore in this Genitufe, though Venus is joined
in the train with Saturn, and Mars, and is also afflicted by both
the Malefics by position, and near violent fixed Stars, she is
qualified to produce a considerable portion of Evil, for being Over*
come by the Enemies, she will protract the nature of the calamity,
and produce diseases ofthe Liver, &c, and injury by Medicine;
so that she cannot sufficiently counteract the impending violence of
jthe dreadful train to the giver of Life.
I have omitted Some observations on the Effects of several
Directions that come up at an earlier period in Life, some of
which will give injury to Health, but as I do not see any tiling
remarkable in the Figure, I have not noticed those subjects that
appear to be of little advantage to the improvement of the Students
jn this Seiehee.
OR GENETHLIACAL ASTRONOMY. 109
As a further proof ofthe Truth of these Astronomical Calcula
tions, I now lay before the public, the Nativity of Mr. Richard
White, Hair-Dresser, who resided in Lincoln. On Monday the 8th
of September, 1817, he requested me to Calculate his Nativity,
which I undertook to convince him of the Truth of this venerable
Study, being at the same time aware, that no Man was a greater
enemy to this Science than himself, neither could any persons pass
more scurrilous reflections, and unbecoming Language on the
power of the Celestial Hosts, than himself, and his Relatives.
The time ofTus birth, which he delivered to me from an indisputa
ble document, was April 25th, 1792, 3h. 45m. a m. My
previous Judgment on the period ofhis demise, was truly verified,
which is well known to the Public,
By proofs like these, this Noble Science show.
The fate of ev'ry Mortal here below;
Those Starry Infidels, puff''d up with pride,
Ifthey would suffer truth to be their guide,
They then by Sacred thought, would keep in view,
The solemn time, when they must bid adieu
To Mortal objects, with all Terrene things,
And view thb GLORY OF THE KING OF KINGS.

OR GENETHLIACAL ASTRONOMY. f#f
When this Native was sixteen Years of Age, he suffered
senerely by a violent nervous Fever, which continued Â«huost two
Months, during which time he was not expected to survive; the
Ejections of the Ascendant to 'the Body of the Sun, nnd the
Hyleg to the Mundane Parallel of Mars, ,by Direct Motion,
then shewed their Effects; for if the distance of Mars with 'bis
Latitude from the Nadir, be subtracted from his Semiuocturnal
Arc, his true distance from the Western Horizon, below ,the
Earth, will be 1Â° 18', so that by these numbers, the Parallel of
Mars, by the Motion ofthe Primum Mobile, may soon be dis
covered, and computed ; the above Directions were preceded by
the Sun to the Parallel of Mars in Mundo, Converse Direction,
and the Rapt Parallel of Saturn, the superior Malefic being con.
joined with the giver of Life in the Eastern angle, at the time of
Birth.
At the Age of twenty-one Years, and a half, the Native
entered into Business for himself, and was successful in his Profes
sion, according to his station in Life ; he also entered into the state
of Matrimony near the same time ; the Directions then in opera
tion were the Ascendant to the Body of Mercury, the Part of
Fortune to the Trine of Jupiter, the Sun to the Sextile of Venus
in the Zodiac, and her Parallel in Mundo, by Converse Motion,
all of which are benevolent, and agree with those Events; but the
influence ofthe subsequent Directions was retarded, owing to the
impotence of the Promittors in the Figure, and the depression of
the Pole of the Sun in those places, and Terms, where both the
Malerics, (by the frigidity of their nocturnal applications,) project
their beams with increased power to the significators; it is necessary
that these things should be properly considered, and understood by
all Students in this incomparable Science, as the acceleration of
the Effects of all Directions in the Zodiac, and Mundo, with
their retardation, &c., chiefly depend on those Motions, and
Terms, with which they continue in Direction, by their stations,
and applications through all parts of the Heavens.
118 CELESTIAL PHILOSOPHY,
As soon as I had observed those Directions above, with their
corresponding Effects, I then computed the time when the Na
tive's Death might be expected, but in pointing out that solemn
period, my Judgment was traduced, by the hardened Infidel,
the censorious Critic, and the Vulgar. The Sun is the
giver of Life, and as the position is weak, and both the Benefics,
Ascendant, and Luminaries are all afflicted in the Geniture, I
judged that at the Age of thirty-three Years, the Native would
depart this Life, as the Hyleg was then directed to the Body of
the Moon, Mundane Parallel of Saturn by Converse Direction,
and also to the square of the Moon in Mundo, by Converse Mo
tion, succeeded by the Apheta to his own Semiquartile in the
Zodiac, and Parallel of Saturn in the World, by Direct Direc
tion, and likewise to the Moon's Parallel in Mundo, by the Rapt
Motion, these were the principal Directions that caused his Death,
according to the Judgment I publicly delivered seven Years before
his demise, the truth of which can at any time be proved ; he died
on the 18th of April, 1825, at Noon, aged thirty-three Years
nearly.
I have now stated the Mortal Directions to the Hyleg which
cut off Life, and whenever similar Anaretical Directions are ob
served in other Nativities to the Moderators, without sufficient
assistance, they will notfail to destroy. The Hyleg was direct
ed to the Quartile of Mars in the Zodiac, at the Age of thirty
Years, and eight Months, the Effects of which could not produce
any sudden, or serious injury to the Native's Life, owing to the
powerful Terms of Jupiter, and Venus, in which that Direction
completed its course; but as it was near the beginning ofthe deadly
train, it caused a slow Fever, with a gradual diminution of
strength, until the Apheta arrived at the Body of the Moon, and
though the Directions of Jupiter were united to the giver of Life,
yet they could not save, for as he was in the .Western Angle at the
time of Birth, and afflicted by the Opposition of Saturn, he shew
OR GENETHLIACAL ASTRONOMY. 119
ed a diseased Viscera by position, and that an inflamation, and
decay of the Lungs, (being that part which Jupiter governs,)
would be the cause ofthe Native's Death.
Those who think proper to examine all the Primary Motions
&c., and compare them with each other, will find that they display
their baneful influence in producing dissolution; for when the
Polar Elevations of the significators, and Promittors are considered,
with their augmented strength as they ascend the superior Angles*
it is evident that a sufficient portion of benign aid ; could not be
received by the giver of Life, in his nocturnal ^station. The
Secondary Directions were also of a violent nature, as well as the
positions of the principal rulers in his last Revolution. At the
time he died, there was a New Moon in the Zenith, on the place
of Saturn in the Nativity, Venus was in conjunction with that
Malefic, and Mars was on the radical place of the Sun, the giver
of T ife.
120 CELESTIAL PHILOSOPHY.
The next Geniture is that of Mary Dickinson, this young
Woman lived in the service of Mr. Nathan Clayton, owner of
one ofthe Steam Packets in the City of Lincoln. On the fifth
of August, 1822, she, (in company with some of her Female
Friends, ) came to my1 House, and râ¢quested me to amsw*# a few
questions ott her Nativity, she produced the correct time ofher Birth,
and observed, that she did not place confidence in such things, as she
had never known any proof give" satisfaction ; she asked me if I
could inform her of the time of her Marriage, and whether she was
likely to live happy in that state, to which I answerâ¢d, that I was
confident she would never enter into the Matrimonial Union j she
said she was sorry that I should give such false Judgment, as she*
expected to Marry in the ensuing Spring; my reply Wte, th&t I
hadsubstantial reasons, ( though ihey were of aÂ» important ctttd 4*<
licate nature,) to prove the truth of my affirmation, wniob i* * <e#
Months would be verified ; as she was anxious to know what ftfy
delicate reasons were, which caused me to withhold the principal
part of my Judgment, I then informed herthat something ofan aw
ful nature would occur, before the Month of March, then next
ensuing, which would destroy Life. As soon as I had mentioned
these things, including my reasons lor giving this Judgment, she
laughed immoderately, and said, she placed no confidence in my
observations ; I told her it was with deep regret that I beheld the
terrific Astral Causes in her Geniture, the Effects of which
were fast approaching, but none of my admonitions had any influ
ence on her Mind ; I endeavoured in vain, to inform her, that "Hea
ven is the book of God," in which we may clâ¢arly read the
divine ordinances of the MOST HIGH ; she said she believed
that all things in the Science were guessed at, and ifthey happen
ed right, it was all by chance ; but before she left me she said in a
jocular way, that as I had given my Judgment on the shortness of
her Life, (if she thought proper to believe it,) she wished to be
intormed of the quality of Death ; I told her it appeared to me,
that Drowning would be the caUse of her dissolution, at which
OR GASTRONOMY. 12 J
she IttHgked, and said, that wasimpossible', for though' Mr.. Clayton,
( with whom she bodlived several Yâ¢ars, ) had * Steam Packet,
yet as she did not go on Board, she considered herself perfectly
safe firdta any danger of that nature ; her remarks were such as ex
cited fitft rather than contempt ; she then left me, and I saw her no
Htore, though I sent some of her Friends about a fortnight after-
w.ard, to admonish heroftheformidable dangerapproaching, butshe
treated themm with derision, and endeavoured to depreciate myprevi
ous Judgment. As she had engaged to go to a Village near Boston,
she went on Board the Packet, and in the act of leaning over the
side of the Vessel, she was precipitated into the River, near the
town of Bardney, tod when taken out, Life was extinct; her
Death happened on ihe 7th of January, 1823, at half past eleven
o'Clo'sk in the Morning, Aged twenty-four Years, eleven Months,
arid six. days. 1*116 awful Figure of the Heavens, at the true

OR GENETH-LIACAL ASTRONQMY.
The foregoing Gonethliaeal display of the Celestial Ed
dies, tod Directions, tire the same as those that I used when this
unfortunate Native applied to me. As soon as I had viewed the
alarming testimonies that were prevalent, and presented themselves
in every part of the Heavens, I was then convinced that a violent
Death was apparent, and that there was nothing that could possibly
mitigate the fury o2luso inimical configurations, that were con
joined with the Anaretieal Directions, in their eorre^)oin4ing places
and Mortal stations. The Ascendant is afflicted by the Body of
Mars (who is near the Heart of the Scorpion,) and also by the
Semiquartile of the Sun, and that important Angle is likewise afflic
ted by the Moon's Mundane Sesquiquadrate, to which that Lu
minary is applying: the two Lights of the World are also in oppo
sition to each' Other, and Mars, who has just risen at tha time of
Birth, is afflicting the Sun, and Moon, from obnoiious places and
Terms, all of which portend a violent Death. The Part of Fof*
tune claims ths prorogatory Dignity, as a full Moon precfed&d the
Nocturnal Birth, and neither the Ascendant, Or any Planet, ceuli
claim the Hylegiacal power, the affliction of that Aphetical point by
the Opposition of Mars, his Mundane Parallel, and also by the
Semiquartile of the Moon, and Sesquiquadrate of the Sun in the
World, are all strong, and additional arguments of a sudden
Death by violence. The position ot Jupiter in the Imum- Coel^
afflicted by the q iartile of Saturn in the Zodiac, and Mundane
Square of Mars, applying, has a baneful appearance when compar
ed with the Motions ofthe other Stare in their Longitudinal plaeei.
Venus is also applying to the Square of Saturn, therefore from
these observations it will plainly appear, that both the benefics are
deprived of their natural, and benign qualities, both by position
and Direction, and consequently cannot render any support,
either to tire true Hyleg. or the othef inferior Vital places, which
have co-signification of Life. Some may probably observe, that
as the giver of Life is in a Mundane Square to Jupiter, and neaf
the Trine of Venus in the World, the afflciticn of the Prdrogator
m the Genethliacal Constitution is much reduced, and the vio'-
T2
128 CELESTIAL PHILOSOPHY,
lence thereof considerably dissolved; but those who ore inclined to
etate such insignificant, and puny propositions, know nothing of
the true principles ofthis Science, either by Theory, or Practice.
I affirm that the Part of Fortune is the giver of Life, and it was
from the Directions of that point to the Body of Suturn, Sesqui-
quadrate of Mars in Mundo, and Parallel of Saturn in the World,
(he being posited in Cancer, a violent Cardinal Sign of the watery
Trigon, and in the Western Angle, ) that I foretold the Death
of this Native by Drowning, five Months before that Event took
place, which is well known to the Public. The Irue Calculations
of those Directions to the flyleg, or giver of Life, are as follow.
The true Pole ofthe Sun, is thus computed.

Gemini, consequently its Declination will be 22Â° 2t)' North, its
Right Ascension 72Â° 32', and its diurnal horary times 203 3d'.

OR GENETHLIACAL ASTRONOMY. 131
These were the Directions that I judged would produca
Death, and when they shewed their Effects, I was not disappoint
ed in my expectation, I do not deny that the Ascendant, and Lu
minaries, were afflicted by primary Directions, which succeeded!
those to the Hyleg that destroyed Life, and which doubtless in
creased the sudden power of the killing train to the Moderator;
but though I have made these observations in this place, yet I po
sitively say, that if the legal Prorogator had not encountered those
Mortal Directions, which I have computed in full, the others of
an inferior power that followed, could not have destroyed Life.
I mention these things that the Students may observe, that no
violent Directions can produce Death, except they are made to the
true giver of Life, though they will, ( when the Enemies possess
their own nature,) give Sickness, Troubles, and Accidents, ac
cording to their power in the Kadix, and in the places where tha
Promittors, &c. have dominion, when the Directions are finished.
I trust I shall be excused for making repetition, yet the subject I
am no at discussing, demands the strictest attention, and ought to be
laid down in plain terms, and not left in obscurity. The Students
must always remember, that when a sudden Death is visible, they
will then discover, that many violent Directions of different deno
minations, will generally be united with, or near those that are in
operation to the Prorogator, though it is from the Anaretical power
of the latter alone, that personal extinction is produced.
I conceive I have said sufficient on this Nativity, and hop*
from the exaMples preceding, that the Students will readily un
derstand how to judge of all the other Motions, and applications in
the Zodiac, and Mundo, whether they are ofan hostile, or benign
power. In the Native's last Revolution, the Moon was just set-
tin", in square to Mars, and in Opposition to the place of that
Malefic, in the Nativity, being among violent fixed Stars, and near
the place of the giver of Life in the Radix; she was also applying
to the Mundane Squares of Saturn and Jupiter. At the exact
time she was Drowned, the Moon, was in the watery Sign Scorpig
132 CELESTIAL PHILOSOPHY,
in the Western Angle, in opposition to Saturn, and on fhe Mun
dane place ofthe Part of Fortune in the Geniture ; Saturn, and
Mars, the two Mortal Promittors, were also in quartile to each other,
and conveyed their destructive, power to the siguificator of Life, at
the time of her expiration.
OR GENETHLIACAL ASTRONOMY. 133
The time ofthe Birth of a Female, Born in Lincoln, was given
to me about five Years ago, by one of her Relatives, now living,
who informed me, that I might rely on the correctness thereof;
which was, September 3rd, 1801, Oh. 35m. P. M. From the
following Figure of the Heavens, and the Directions; it is well
known to many, that I foretold the time of the dissolution of this
Native,' which clearly demonstrate the essential use, power, and
sole dominion of the giver of Life, when properly chosen accord
ing to the Rules I have given ; but though the Sun is certainly the
Prorogator iu this Nativity, yeiras some of the Directions that as
sisted in destroying the life of the Native, differ from the general
precepts, and as these Examples clearly dt^elope the true Terms
of the Planets, in the most conspicuous manner, with their saving,
and destroying power, I have taken the trouble, by true Calcula
tion, to prove, that the Terms, which ought to be used, are wholly
unconnected with any of those degrees in the Signs ofthe Zodiac,
which the pretenders to this Science sanction, and admire without
examination. 1 have tried them all in the Calculation of several
hundreds of Nativities, as they are erroneously given in the Works,
of Ancient, and Modern Pirates, and have discovered, that there
is no truth in them whatever; therefore as they are not to be de
pended on in any Computations, as they are now generally used,
all those who rely on their assumed power, which cannot be de
monstrated, will remain in a labyrinth of confusion, so long as they
suffer any of those false, and ostentatious innovations, to operate as
a barrier to their progress in this Celestial Study.
It is extraordinary to observe, with what avidity the Students in
general, adhere to the superficial, and preposterous notions, which
have been falsely disseminated by various Authors. Many are so
ardently attached to Ancient errors, (which the Tables of the
Terms ofthe Planets, and many other spurious inventions, fully
explain,) that they are not inclined to discountenance them, even
when Truth makes its brilliant appearance to aid and faciliate
them in their researches in the paths of Science. With some it is
U
134 CELESTIAL PHILOSOPHY,
a matter of little consequence, whether the instructions they receive-
from an Author, are true, or false, as they seldom call them fn
question, if they appear sufficiently prolix, and originate from
Ancient Authority, therefore Truth,(which ought to be esteemed
as the most essential criterion)does not become their primary object,
but is considered as a subject ofminor importance; to what use
then are false Rules, and fabricated Examples given by Pirates,
which upon minute examination, are found to be deficient, and
will not stand the test of impartial proof, when opposed to Truth,
Reason, and Experience, which I have evinced in this Publica
tion. The injury done to this Science by such Pirates, is incal
culable ; they have promulgated the most inconsistent, and super
fluous Precepts, contrary to the true Motions of the Heavens,
which mislead the Students, and cause them to imbibe plausible
Chimeras, instead of those profound, and substantial Theorems,
which carrnot be refuted. An Author who intends that the Stu
dents should receive advantage from his labors, will always make
his Rules, and instructions as clear as the nature of the subjects
will admit, and deliver his sentiments in a plain, concise, and
intelligent manner; tor when irrefutable computations, (combined
with Judgment which exhibit the true Causes, with their Effects,)
are introduced in his Work, the Students will then attend with
pleasure to the Proofs he has unveiled, by which the most lumi
nous Truths become Publicly corroborated, and established
beyond the bounds of contradiction. I hope I have sufficiently
explained my instructions, and confirmed the Judgment I have
given, not only from authentic demonstration, but also from the
most respectableevidence, which neitherthe wiseacres or sceptics,
are able to refute ; for it cannot be supposed that any hifidel can
be found, who dare deny, or oppose those public, and ocular facts,
contained in this Work, which are confirmed, and proved by the
testimony ofmany hundreds of surviving witnesses. With respect
to the Terms of the Celestial Bodies, I shall not trouble the
Students with additional observations thereon, as Examples are far
superior to comments, on subjects which require the most serious
OR GENETHLIACAL ASTRONOMY. 135
attention. I shall now proceed to illustrate, and explain those
Terms, with their natural Effects by Directions to the Sun, who is
the presiding Moderator, including his power in that part ofthe
Heavens, in which he is posited, as the true giver of Life in this
Geniture. The Native died on the 28th of June, 1825; Aged
twenty three Years, nine Months, and twenty four Days.

140 CELESTIAL PHILOSOPHY,
The distance ofthe Sun from the Meridian, in the preceding
Geniture, is eight Degrees, forty-five Minutes, by which he claims
the Aphetical Dignity, and consequently the time of the Native's
dissolution, must be obtained from his Progressive Motion to the
killing Place; but from his impotent position,(with the affliction
of the other Stars in those stations, which have affinity to Diseases,
and Death,)it became apparent to me, that the Native would soon
be removed from this state of Mortality, as the whole position,
properly considered in all its parts, is too feeble to' support Life, for
any considerable length oftime; I therefore judged that lingering
Diseases, (during the short period of her existence,) would be pro
duced from so many unfavorable, and conflicting Causes, none of
which were defeated in producing their corresponding Effects.
The Hyleg is in MundaWe Parallel with Mars, Which is a' violent
affliction, and collects a considerable augmentation ofevil from the
Terms of the enemies, by the Rapt Motion, as they decline from
the Zenith, which the use of the Celestial Globe will immediately
prove; we may also discover the Sun's additional affliction, by his
being conjoined with Saturn, and with Mercury also, who is of
the Nature ofthat Malefic ; and as the Hyleg cannot receive any
benign applications, when he arrives at the Anaretical Point, in
5Â° 13' of Libra; where the second Zodiacal Parallel of Mars,
and his Terms, (with those of Saturn)are nearly united, I judged
that her Personal extinction would take place when that Direction
shewed its Effects; as it was followed by the Semiquartiles of Mer
cury, and Saturn in the Zodiac, &c. The Part of Fortune was
likewise directed to the Mundane Square of Saturn, and the Moon
also applied by Converse Motion, to the Quartile of Mars in the
Zodiac, at the same time ; hence we may observe, that the Sun,
Moon, and Part of Fortune were all afflicted by directional Motion,
at the time of the Native's Death.
It may probably be asked by some, why the giver of Life to the
Parallel of Mars in the Zodiac, at the Age of thirteen Years, and
eleven Months, followed by his Body at fifteen Years and eight
OR GENETHLIACAL ASTRONOMY. 141
Months, did not produce Death ; it is evident that no Sickness, or
danger, worthy of notice, could possibly take place from those
Directions, because the Sextile of Venus, combined with J upiter's
Terms, and his conjunction, by Converse Direction, interposed at
the place, and dissolved the apparent violence; but before I con
clude this Nativity, I shall make a few additional observations
thereon, which may be of use to the Students, if they think proper
to attend to them. The old Tables which contain certain Num
bers in the signs of the Zodiac, being the supposed Planetary
Terms, are all whimsical notions, and void of Truth ; the true
Terms arise from clear demonstration, they may be discovered by
Calculations in every Nativity, and those Calculations fully prove
their use and power; the Fact is, they are those places where the
Benefics. and Malefics claim their greatest influencein theZodiacal,
and Mundane Circles, and are found by adjusting the difference,
as the Stars approach to, or decline from the preceding Angle at
Birth ; thus Mars is 6Â° 27' from the Meridian, and his distance
then taken by proportion from the Eastern Horizon, which he
beholds by a Mundane Square applying, his Terms fall in 7Â° 23*
of Libra, and those of Saturn, in 9Â° 41' of the same Sign. Now
in this Nativity, when the Sun was directed to the Zodiacal
Parallel of Mars, for Death, the old Terms of Venus followed,
which by the Ancient Method, ought to have preserved Life, if
they were true, and their Effects of sufficient power. With little
difficulty it may be proved, that all the twelve Constellations have
changed their Ancient places, so that the Sign Aries has now got
into Taurus, and the Constellation Taurus, into that of Gemini,
and so of all the other signs ofthe Zodiac. There are many errors,
and deficiences in Nativities, which I have not disclosed, that
have long been received as absolute Facts, though I have never
given credit to any of them, because when I demanded proof, I
soon discovered that it was not to be obtained, and as I have lately
observed that it would be difficult to turn many from their old
favoritepath of Error, into that of TRUTH, J shall not attempt
to perform that office ; however I shall observe, that if the Students
think they have not yet labored long enough in their trammels,
148 CRBESTTAL VmhQSOtfSTf*
they may still proceedforward, until; thejr dweaver their errois
more visibly, by proper practice, and experience.
Having stated the. Directions which destroyed the. Life of tlm
Native, I sball now consider the quality of the Disease, which
terminated the Native's existence. Jupiter, who is posited in a
cadent station, is weak, and afflicted by the Bodies- of Mercury,
and Saturn, in the fiery sign Leo, near Cor Lconis.so that when
the giver of Life, arrived at the first Direction, which produced
Death, Jupiter was directed a few Degrees afterwards, in the
subsequent train to the Body of Mars,, and Vonus came also to a
conjunction witL Merciuy, and Saturn ; hut these Directions have
no\ power at any time, to give Death, but Diseases only, from
which it is plain, that both those benevolent Planets* being afflicted
by furious Directions; produced great injury to the internal parts,
governed by those benign Stars, and the Signs in which tltey are
posited at Birth, regard being had to those places-, where their
hostile Motions- are finished. Jupiter, and Venus,- govern the
Ltmgs; and Liver, &c. and being afflicted in the. Radix, and by
Directional Mofipnlikcwise, they always produce incurable Diseases,
and a waiting of the Flesh; hence it is obvious; that.a, Consumption
was ib&ariginal Cause of this Native's dissolution. .
In her last Revolution, the Sun, the sigtiificator of Lifei- was fn
Square to Saturn in the Zodiac, and in Mundane Square to Mars;
the Moon was also in opposition to her own plaee in the Nativity ;
Mars was likewise in zodiacal Quartile to Jupiter, Mercury, andJ
Saturn, in the Geniture, and the Moon applied to the Declination
of the three superior Planets in the Revolution; all of which are
testimonies of a malignant Nature. At the time she died, the
Moon was among violent fixed Stars, in a subterranean station, and
applied to the Opposition, of Saturn, Mercury, and Mars, and^
that Luminary at the same time, had nearly the Declination of
Saturn, Mercury, and the Sun. Mara, the chiefmortal Promittor,
was Cadent in the twelfth, in exact Square to his place at Birth,
and the Moon was in Quartile to the Prorogator, in the GenHure.
OR GENETHWACAL ASTRONOMY. 143
Maria Ferguson was Bom on the 28th of October, 1808,
>3h. 40m. P. M. and was Drowned in the Fossdyke, near Lincoln
Race^grcwnll, on the 12th of July, 1825, about 9 o'clock in the
Morning, Agedsixteen Years, eight Months, and thirteen Days.
Thisyoung Woman lived in 'Lincoln wben she gave me the
above time of her Birth, which she said was trie, having been told
it was taken with much care. As soon as I beheld the dreadful
appearances of the Celestial Bodies in the Figure of Birth, I was
immediately convinced that a violent Death by Water, was
plainly visible; for it must appear evident to those, who have but
little skill in 4his noble, and Sublime Study, that a more alarming
position is seldom seen, than that which follows ; particularly
"when the Directions that destroyed Life, are minutely examined,
with those-parteofthe Heavens in which they completetheir courses,
ft is well known to many respectable persons in this City, that I
foretold the time ofthis Native's Death, and its quality, which
certainly were not difficult to iiorform, when the proper Precepts
in this Work are attended to, by which, not only the length of
life, but also the quality of Death, whether natural, orviolent, are
soon discoverer!. According to my usual practice, 1 first computed
13the duration'of Lifo, and as the Sun is Hyleg, it appeared obvious
to me, that when ho arrived On the Western Horizon, followed by
several Directions of a Mortal nature, this Native would be no
more, that Direction of the Apheta to the West, being the first
that made its appearance m the Anarotical train. Now as my
previous Calculations, and Judgment have been confirmed, it is
impossible lor prejudice, or any artful Chicanery, to oppose those
luminous Facts, which admit of no refutation. There are certain
characters, Who vainly imaginO, that they are qualified to discover
the limits of a Man s understanding, but when they meet with those
difficulties in Science, which tfeey cannot comprehend, (not being
wflling to acknowledge thatothers are superiorto themin Utesature,)
they then become offended, and in the raost unoandid raanner, use
every means in their power, to level odious, and gross sttirrSity
X2
144 CELESTIAL PHILOSOPHY,
against that, which throws their Talents in the shade, and makes
them appear contemptible in the Eyes of the Public. Those who
consider themselves qualified to oppose a Science, ought to under
stand all its principles, otherwise their arguments, and observations,
will soon obtain the ignominy they merit, and the Authors, instead
ofgaining reputation, will establish their own disgrace to succeeding
Generations.
Some have, to their shame, asserted, that this is not a commend
able Study, and even those who make much noise concerning popish
suPERSTiTiON(which Ls as dangerous as the Tommqhauk in the
handofasatiate,)displaytheirlearnedanddogntaticalsentiments,
agaiast this Divine, and sacred Learning, which our forefathers
studied with the greatest diligence, and admiration. I have been
told by those, whose Heads arefilled with priestcraft, that no
person can perform these things, if he had not an evil Spirit to
assist him, o shaMe! o shaMe! are we to be told in this enlightened,
Age, and in the nineteenth Century, that Astronomical Calcula
tions, the use of the Globe, and the common rules of Arithmetic,
are performed by the assistance of beelzebub, who is probably,
not a learned Astronomer ; how degrading must such simple, and
delusive notions appear to every impartial observer. With respect
to the dissolution of this young Woman, some learned sciolists,
. (with affected Jargon,) say, that she died an untimely Death.
I never have yet been able to understand the literal meaning of
that, which appears to be an Allegorical Theme, or a jarring,
and confused misrepresentation of something, which requires plain
confirmation; for how can the Death ofthis Native be considered
untimely, when it was visibly apparent in the Heavens, at the
moment she came into the World, and which, no human Efforts
could alter, or prevent; the word untimely, appears to represent,
what happens before its natural time, or in fact, what Mortal Men
are disposed thus to stile it; but according to all the researches
which have been made in this venerable Study, combined with
god's Most holY word, in its purity, it is manifest that,"tc/Â«rt
OR GENETHLIACAL ASTRONOMY.
ever is, is righi". The time and quality ofevery person's Death,
are unfolded to us by Secondary Causes, according to the ordin
ancâ¢ ofthe MOST HIGH. How imperious and immoral must
thosepersonsbe, who pronounce the Death ofan individual untimely,
merely because it is of a violent nature in the Eyes of Mortal Men,
though itwas decreed in the eternal Mind of the ALMIGHTY,
from all Eternity. Many hundreds of such Examples as the
abovâ¢, are continually displaying themselves to us, (if wâ¢ do not
survey them too superficially) as we travel through this Mortal Life
to the glorious Mansions of everlasting felicity, all of which prove,
the UNERRING, AND IMMUTABLE DECREE qi that ALMIGHTY
CREATOR, who is blessed for evermore.

152 CELESTIAL PHILOSOPHY,
In this Nativity, the alarming testimonies which indicate a
violent Death, are many ; the Moon is afflicted by the Opposition
of Mars, from cadent stations, and is also in Square with Mercury,
who is ofthe nature and power of both the Malefics. The Sun,
the giver of Life, is near violent fixed Stars, in the Watery Sign
Scorpio, and applying to the Parallel of Saturn's Declination, and
also to his Body in the Zodiac, and Mundo; he is likewise
afflicted by the Rapt Parallel of Mars, and Mundane Parallel of
thâ¢ Moon, and according to his radical position, as he descends
towards the Western Angle, by the Motion of the Primum
Mobile; he applies to the Mundane Parallel of Mars, both by
Direct, and Converse Motion. The Part of Fortune is also
posited in the Watery Sign Cancer, in Mundane Square to Saturn,
Venus, and Mercury. Jupiter is afflicted by the Opposition of
Mars, and also by his Parallel of Declination, and Venus is con-
joincdwith Saturn, and Mercury in a violent part ofthe Heavens;
so that both the Luminaries, and the benefics are afflicted at the
time of Birth ; all these are configurations of a most malignant Na
ture, and as all the Celestial Bodies, except Mars, are in Watery
Signs, it is evident that Drowning would bo the Cause of her
Death, which took place at the time I have stated above.
The Sun is the right Prorogator, and the Directions that de
stroyed Life, were, when he descended on the Cusp of the Seventh
House, followed by the Square of the Moon in the Zodiac, and
also by the Rapt Parallels of Mercury, Venus, and Saturn ; the
giver of Life was likewise directed to the Body of Mars in Mundo,
by Converse Motion, and by Direct Direction, ho arrived at the
Quai tile of Mars in the Zodiac, and though the rays of J upiter,
and Venus interposed in these Motions, their feeble power was of
no avail, as they were afflicted in the Radix, and were also united
in the train of Mortal Directions that cut off Life.
There are some who will doubtless ask, why the Sun, when he
was directed to the Body of Saturn, at the Ago of eleven Years,
OR GENETHLIACAL ASTRONOMY. 153
and five Months, followed by the Conjunction of Venus, and
Mercury, did notdestroy Life, as the Hyleg passed those baneful
Directions, in the Zodiac, and in the World. I know this will
prove a mystery to many, as the Native did not experience any
Sickness, or danger, at that time; there is no doubt that those
Directions would have had sufficient strength to have produced
considerable danger to Life, but not Death, if their violent power
had not been diminished by the other Motions, through which their
Effects were defeated ; for when the Sun was directed to the Body
of Saturn, that Malefic was received in the Terms of Jupiter,
therefore as his baneful power was dissolved, he consequently could
not transmit any dangerous qualities to the giver of Life; and
moreover, at the time when the Apheta arrived at his Body, he
was, by Directional Motion, far removed from his radical station,
and constituted in the Rays of Jupiter's Quartile in the Zodiac 13
all these Motions ought to be properly observed by all Students,
as they will find in their practice, that it is not merely computing
Directions alone, that will make them proficients in this Sublime
Science, without diligent Study, and intense application ; neither
will all the Quadripartites that have yet been translated (or
supposed to have been translated,) unveil this, and many other
mysteries. It is said these Works were written by Ptolemy, but
in the manner in which they are now given to the Public, it is
plain to all Students, who think proper to exercise their understand
ing thereon, that the most they contain, is a large portion of
useless home-manufactured-maiter, to confuse the practitioners
without Examples, or any proofs to show, that what has been
written isjbunded on truth. I relate theseplain Facts, which
probably may give offence to some, but that I regard not. The
genuine Principles of this Science, as they were taughtby Ptolemy,
are short, and concise; his Original greek quadkipartite, in
Manuscript, Is yet preserved, and has never been Published,
though the time may probably arrive, when it will be given to the
Public, including a collection of one hundred Modern Nativities,
to\ prove all the Rules by true Calculation, and Judgment; but
154 CELESTIAL PHILOSOPHY,
with respect to the Quadripartites lately Published, we have no
more "proofs of their having been originally written by jthe
immortal PtoleMY, than we have of their been composed by the
Roman Pontiff.
I have rather made a digression, but shall now return to my
subject; In the Secondary Directions, the Sun applied to the
Conjunction of Saturn, and Mercury, and Mundane Square of
Mars, the Moon was in Parallel with Mars in the World, and
also applied to his zodiacal Parallel, the lesser Malefic, having the
Declination of the Moon in the Nativity; that Luminary also
applied to the hostile stations of the enemies in the Progression;
and in the last Revolution, the Moon made application to the
Declination of Saturn, and Venus was on her own place, and
also on the station of Saturn, and Mercury in the Nativity; Saturn
was likewise in Square to the Moon, Jupiter, and Mars in the
Radix. At the time she was Drowned, the Moon was applying
to the Body of Venus, and Saturn, those Planets being in Quartile
to Jupiter, and Mars in the Nativity. The Sun the giver of
Life, was in the Watery Sign Cancer, with Ca&tor, and Pollux,
separating from the Body of Mars, having the Declination of
Saturn, and Mercury; the Moon was also in Square to her own
place in the Geniture; hence we may observe all those powerful
Motions ofthe Stars, at those periods, when they were united in
obnoxious places, and being joined with the primary Directions,
they consequently augmented their power, by various applications,
which correctly correspond with the time of Death, and the
quality thereof. , -
OR GENETHLIACAL ASTRONOMY. 155
The following Geniture is that of a person now living; he wasi
Born in the City 6f Lincoln,- and the estimate time of his Birth
was given to me in the 'Month of October, 1824, which was
supposed to be correct; but I will not be positive respecting the
accuracy thereof,' having no occurrences worthy of notice for
rectification, without which no Nativity can be truly corrected;
but I have reason to believe that there is not much difference
between the Estimate, and the true time of Birth. It is well
known to several persons now living, that the Father ofthis Native,
(though unacquainted with this Celestial Study,) was anxious to
obtain the times of the Births of all his Children, as near as
possible, but what induced him to attend to such observations, I
know not, as the true principlesof thisScience were but little known,
or practised at that period. About fifty Years ago, the times of
the Births of Children in general, (according to all the information -
I have been able to obtain,) were seldom ascertained with precision,
owing to which, many errors have been committed, for when the
Oblique Ascension of the Ascendant, and Right Ascension of the
Zenith, are incorrect, (occasioned by a false time of Birth,) they
not only alter all the Directions of the two superior Angles to
Promittors in Mnndo, but likewise cause the greatest errors in all
the Mundane Parallels, and in fact, in every Arc of Direction
in the Nativity, more or less, in the Zodiac, and in the World,
both by Direct, and Converse Motion ; but I need not trouble the
Reader with a reiteration of remarks, which are manifest to the
meanest capacity. The imbecile, and hostile appearances of the
Celestial Bodies at the time of this Native's Birth, clearly indicate
at one view, that he will never rise in the World above his present
station in life. Mercury represents his Person, Profession, &c.
because he is ruler of the Ascendant, and Medium Cceli, he is
conjoined with the Sun, who is in his fall, under theEarth, and that
Luminary, who is the general significator of Promotion, &c. does
not receive any assistance from benign applications. The Moon
is also in a subterranean Position, in opposition to Jupiler, who is in
a cadent station, in his detriment, and in sextile with Saturn, in
156 CELESTIAL PHILOSOPHY,
signs of long Ascensions, and Venus, who governs the second
House is impotent, being posited in the violent Sign Scorpio, in a
subterranean place, where she is afflicted by the Square of Mars
in the Zodiac, and Mundo, from obscure parts of the Heavens,
that Malefic is also applying to the Conjunction of Jupiter, in an
obnoxious position, and the ruler ofthe Part of Fortune is afflicted
in the Radix, and deprived of all his Dignities. I could easily
explain what all these violent positions, (combined with the
Effects of the Directions,) will produce, during the few remaining
Years of his Life, but as they exhibit transactions, which every
attentive Student in this Science may readily discover, I shall
make but few obsâ¢rvations thereon, as all the Planets are weak,
and none of them dignified at the given time of Birth, neithor
can those Stars that behold the superior places, produce any benign
Effects which will appear in the following Figure of the Heavens.

166 CELESTIAL PHILOSOPHY,
The Dignity of Hyleg is claimed by the Sun in this Geniture,
and if we examine those Directions of an inimical Power, which
that Luminary has passed several Years ago, it will become evident
that they could not produce any visible Effects, because their
apparent obnoxious qualities were reduced, and counteracted, in
proportion as the giver of Life applied to those Mundane places,
where the power of the benefics were most prevalent. The Sun
was directed to the zodiacal Parallel of Mars, at the Age of twenty-
seven Years, and nine Months, but that Direction could not produce
any injury to the Native's Health, because the Hyleg was then
directed to the Sextile ofJupiter in Mundo, by Direct Motion, he
also applied to the Terms ofboth the benefics, being surrounded by
their rays in the mundane Circle, when the Prorogate arrived at
the Eastern Horizon. At the Age of thirty-six Years and six
months, the Hyleg was directed to the Parallel of Saturn's Declina
tion, but that Direction could not give any Illness, or danger,
because the giver of Life applied to the Body of Jupiter, by Con
verse motion, and was also received in his Terms, where, the ray*
of Venus , by the Altitude of the Sun's Circle of position, became
subsequently conjoined; from which we may observe, that those
Directions to mars, and Saturn to the giver of Life, could not pro
duce any indisposition ; and when the Sun was directed to the
Body of Saturn, many pretenders would judge that the Native
would depart this life at the time limited by that Direction, but
it passed over at the Age of forty-five Years, and one month, and
left the Native in good Health, and Spirits; therefore from what has
been observed, it is plain, that the Sun to the Body of Saturn could
neither kill this Native, or produce any injury to his Life, for the
Directions of both the benefics followed, by which the violence of
that Direction was impeded; but when the Hyleg is directed
to the Body of mars by Converse Direction, united with others
which will be in operation at the same time, then this Native will
be no more, as the Etfects of those Directions will prove mortal,
at the Ago of fifty-one Years, and two months.
OR GENETHLIACAL ASTRONOMY. 167
I should not have given this Nativity a place in ray Work, if
there had not been a whimsical question connected therewith,
which I conceive may require an answer. The fact is, a Gentle
man now living was Born in the Town of Boston, Lincolnshire,
October 3rd, 1778, 16h. 30m. r m, by which it will appear that
the Native at Boston, was Born twenty minutes in time, earlierthan
the Native of Lincoln, and therefore the question is, as there are
only twenty Minutes difference between the time of each Birth,
will both these persons depart this Life at the same time.
I have stated the period ofthe Demise of the Native of Lincoln,
in whose Geniture the Sun is certainly the giver of Life, but in the
Nativity of the Native Born at Boston, the Sun's Directions
cannot produce Death, because he does not claim the office of
Prorogator, therefore the Ascendant becomes the giver of Life, and
at the Age ofsixty-nine Years, and eleven Months, that point of
the Heavens will be directed to the Semiquartile of the Sun in
Mundo, followed by the Body of Saturn, and Mundane Square
of Mars, which will certainly produce dissolution ; it is therefore
not difficult to prove, that these two persons who were Born in the
same Hour, and but little more than thirty Miles distant from each
other, will not depart this Life at the same time, for by true
Astronomical Computation, the difference between the Mortal
Directions in each Geniture, will be eighteen Years, and nine
Months, so that there will be that space of time between the
Demise of each Native, I therefore hope that I have given a
satisfactory answer to this learned Question, which has occasioned
much illiterate disputation.
2A
168 CELESTIAL PHILOSOPHY,,
Mr, G. J. Ping whs Born at the time gi^rv, i& the following
Figure, and departed this. Life, June 27^1825,, tyf$, tw.enty-
two Years, nine Months, and five Days,
This Gentleman was by Profession, a Schoolmaster, and
resided ,at Brigg, in the County of Lincoln ; at his request I calcula
ted the Directions in his Nativity in the Autumn of1 1821, and as
both the Luminaries are in Aphefical places, it cannot be difficult
to select the proper Moderator, the right of which belongs to the
Sun. As soon as I had viewed the different positions and configu
rations of the Stars ia the Radix, I first ,coinpu^d ^he pe^rjiod^f
dissolution, which all those, who Study this. Science, ought.always,
to ascertain, before any Judgment is given; for.if that most impor
tant, and interesting subject , be omitted, the practitioners will
frequently wander from one thingto another, and predict, impossi-
.. bilities, and the times ofvarious Er^PK which, were to cpme to pass,
when the Native is in his Qrave.
I have repeatedly urged the propriety offirst selecting the true
Hyleg in every correct Genituro, whether the Native be an Infant,
or has advanced to Years of Maturity. The true time of the Birth
of a healthy Female Child, named Smaljey, (who was Born in
the City of Lincoln, February 18th, 1825, 10h. A M.) was given
to me for Judgment ; it certainly could not be difficult to predict
dissolution before the end of the first Year, for both the Luminaries,
and Ascendant are afflicted at the time of Birth; the Sun thegiver
of Lift: was applying to the Square of Saturn in the Zodiac, and
also to the Body of the Moon, &c. without any assistance; the fact
is, this Child died on the 14th, of August, in the same Year, but
there are other Causes that produce Death in Infancy, independent
of Directions, which I have explained in this Work; I therefore
mention this Example to show, that if I had neglected noticing
the proper use of the true Apheta, my Judgment would have been
erroneous; for some pretenders to this Science declared, that the
Child would live to Years of Maturity, and Marry a person of
OR GENETHLIACAL ASTRONOMY. 169
some Property, and remain happy, and comfortable when both the
Luminaries were directed to the Sextiles of Saturn, and Mercury,
trine of Jupiter in the Zodiac, and Body of Venus, but all this
preposterous jargon is totally refuted, by her personal extinction,
which took .place, according to my previousprediction, before the
end of the first Year.
But some will doubtless say, that the Nativity of this Child has
nothing to do with the Geniture of Mr. Ping, but as<! am writing
for Public information, I conceive that nothing ought to be omitted,
that witl convey genuine Instruction to the Students in this Science;
and as the time of the Death of this Child, has puzzled some
Practitioners, so also has the period of the dissolution of Mr. Ping
on <the same principles defeated the Judgment of those Professors,
who are ignorant of the true Doctrine ofthe Sphere, and Rapt
Motion ofthe Earth; for as the time of Birth is correct, I defy any
Manto havepreviously predicted the true time ofhis Death by any
Rules, except those alone that are delivered-by the immortal
Ptolemy, for the Sun is certainly the giver of Life, and does not
rneet any violent Directions in the Zodiac atthe timeof his decease,
and therefore if there had not been those in Mundo, of equal
Malefic power to have destroyed Life at the time he died, the
Native would have been now living, and in good Health; therefore
I ought not to be reproved in recording such Examples, as may
be deemed beneficial to the Students, if they think proper to receive
them ; by which they may perfectly understand, (in the most
perspicuoiis maimer,) how to apply the established Rules, iu all
primary Directions, and Judgment.

174 CELESTIAL PHILOSOPHY,
At the Age of sixteen Years, and nine Months, this Native's
Life was exposed to the greatest danger, by a severe Sickness,
which continued with unabated violence, for several Weeks. The
giver of Life was then directed to the Body of Saturn, by Converse
Motion, the Effects of which were of an alarming Nature, and
threatened dissolution, but the Hyleg advanced to the Zenith by
the Rapt Motion, and entered the Terms of both the benefics, his
polar Elevation being constituted in the orbs of Venus, so that the
Life of the Native was preserved, and the Effects of that Direction
could not produce Death ; but as soon as the Apheta was disengag
edfrom those obnoxious Motions he then subsequentlyappliedtoother
primary Directions of a more furious nature, there being no benign
applications sufficient to dissolve any portion of the evil, owing to
the weakness of the position in all its farts. The Sun who is
Hyleg, is afflicted by the Square of Mars in the Zodiac, and
J upiter is combust, and in Quartile with that Malefic, being near
the Body of Saturn ; Venus is also in Square to the Moon, and in
Sesquiquadrate with Mars in the Zodiac, and Mundo; so that both
the Benefics, as well as the giver of Life, were violently afflicted at
the time of Birth, which induced me to judge, that when the Sun
was directedtothe Parallel of Saturn, by the Rapt Motion, followed
by the Mundane Square of Mars, and Parallel of Saturn's Declina
tion, the Life ofthis Native would be destroyed; he died at the
time I had predicted, and though the Directions of Jupiter and
Venus were united in the Mortal train to the Prorogator, yet I did
not regard their apparent power, which could be ofno avail what
soever, though consequently, by their union, they showed the
quality of Death, which must appear plain to every attentive
Student in this Science.
By Secondary Motion the Moon was applying to the Squares of
Saturn, and Jupiter in the Zodiac, and the Hyleg had nearly the
Declination of the superior Malefic; Mars waslikewisein Mundane
Square to Venus in the Nativity; and from the Progression, the
Malefics afflicted both the Lights in the superior places. In his
.
OR GENETHLIACAL ASTRONOMY. 175
last Revolution the Moon applied to the Body of the Sun from an
angular position, and Mars occupied the Ascendant at that time,
and was in Mundane quartile to both the Luminaries. At the
time ofhis Death, Saturn had arrived at the Square of his place
in the Geniture, and Mars had returned to his exact station at the
time of Birth, being in Quartile to the place of the giver of Life
in the Radix; these stations ofthe Stars duly considered with the
Directions, are of an ominous tendency, as both the Enemies were
afflicting all the Vital significators when the Soul took its flight to
theimmortal abodes of happiness, and Glory.
176 CELESTIAL PHILOSOPHY.
The next is the Nativity of a young Lady, who was.Born al
Boston, in the County of Lincoln, on the 4th of May, 1803, at
twenty Minutes before eight o'Clock iri the Morning; the abftvo
time was given by her Friends, who informed me that I might
depend on it being exact, as it was taken by a corrected Clock-, with
the greatest care. This Native died on the llth of May, 1822,
Aged nineteen Years, and seven Days.
Some pretenders to this Sublime Study, made a few observations
on the Geniture of this young Lady, when she .was living, and
took the Ascendant for the giver of Life, though that point of the
Heavens cannot be Hyleg, neither can the Sun, Moon, or Part
of Fortune claim the Aphetical power; for it is evident, that if the
Ascendant had been the true Apheta, the Effects of its Directions
to the Scmiquartiles of the Sun, and Mercury in Mundo, and
Square of Saturn in the World, would certainly have destroyed
Life, at the Age of nine Years, and four Months, there being no
benign assistance at that period to preserve Life; but the unex
pected demise of this Native, has caused those pretenders to witness
the full extent of their Error, which has impeached, and invalidated
every portion oftheir sterling Skill, (if they ever possessed any,) in
this Science.
There are some who always take the Ascendant for Hyleg, in
every Nativity they pretend to Calculate, and by their absurd
notions, and ignorance, they endeavor to make the untaught
Vulgar believe, that they possess all the sterling Wisdom of the
Eastern Sages; they generally inform those who apply to them that
they are Born under such, and such a Planet, and that they are abie
to discover all the Moles, Marks, or Scars on the personofthe Native,
and also, that the configurations of various Stars at thetime of Birth,
give black, dark, grey, or blue Eyes, &c. &c. Now I do affirm
that all this is complete nonsense, and absurdity, and cannot be too
much exposed, being performed for the purpose of deceiving those
who apply to such lenrned Sages for Judgment; for you must
OR GENETHLIACAL ASTRONOMY. 177
observe that most of those talkative Gentlemen are very soon
puzzled; therefore from what I have stated, it is evident, that when
a person applies to a Professor ofthis Science, and delivers to him
the true time, and place ofhis Birth, the Native does not require
such paltry. Themes to be sounded in his, Kara, which are irrele
vant to the Questions proposed to be resolved from the true time of
Birth; for the formlandstature, Maples, M^arks, anc( colour of the
Eyes, Hair, &c. &c. are wholly unconnected with these Astrono
mical Calculations, though they are doubtless a refugefor igno
rance to which most of those Professors, (who know but littlâ¢ of
Directional Motion,) generally resort. All the Questions required
to be answered from a correct Geniture, are, the true periods when
all important Events, (during the Native's Life,) will come to pass,
including their respective qualities, and whether they are good, or
evil, ', â¢
The Dignity of Hyleg in this Geniture is claimed by Venus,
who is not only in an Aphetical Place, but receives the proper
Prorogatory power from every part of the Heavens, &c. which
entitle her to possess that Dominion. I have computed the Anare-
tical Directions in full to the true giver ofLife, not only to assist
the genuine Student in his labors, but also to explain to him the
vanity, and absurdity of selecting afalse Prorogator, which is done
in numberless cases, by which the fallacious Judgment of the
Practitioners is justly held in derision, and the invalidity of
their Skill rendered contemptible to every Scientific observer in
this department ot Celestial Philosophy.

The Student may observe, that as Venus is the giver of Life,
no violent Directions could produce Death, but those alone to
which that Planet was directed, for she beholds the Moon by an
opposition, and the Horoscope by a Mundane Sextile, ; and dis
poses ofboth the Luminaries at the time of Birth, and also of the
preceding Conjunction; these Were the chiefreasons vhich induced
me to select that Star for the true Prorogator; I computed the
following Directions in full for the Native's Death, which cor
rectly corresponded with the period of that solemn Event.

Question.âIt appears that you have taken much trouble in
computing the Mortal Directions to Venus, as Hyleg in this
Nativity, but wby should not the Effects of the Ascendant to the
Body ot Mars have been sufficient to have destroyed Life at the
time she died, with a very small alteration in time, as it came up
so near the other Directions, which you have allowed to be the only
cause ofthe Native's Death ?
..39 5
.13 7

CELESTIAL PHILOSOPHY,
Answer.âIf the Ascendant had been the giver of Life, this
Native would have died in her Infant state, but the Horoscope has
nothing to do with Diseases, and Death, in this Nativity, and
therefore it is a most pitiful, and absurd notion to mention the
Ascendant to the Body of Mars for the Native's demise, as that
Direction could not produce any Illness, neither could any visible
Accident appear from its supposed Malefic power; how I could
wish that those who take the Horoscope as the giver of Life in
other Genitures, (when it has no right to exercise that Dominion;)
to notice, what Effects the Ascendant to the Body of Mars will
produce, when the Directions of both the Benefics immediately
follow in regular succession to that point in the Mundane Circle.
In this Example, when the Ascendant Was directed to the Body
of that Malefic, it was succeeded by the Mundane Squares of
Jupiter, and Venus, with their Terms, so that the violent power
of Mars was dissolved, by which be could not give the least Sick
ness, or danger. But the only true Anaretical Directions, were,
Venus Hyleg, to the Parallel of Saturn in Mundo, by the Rapt
Motion, and also to the Square of Mars in the Zodiac, with the
Parallel of Saturn's Declination, Zodiacal Parallel of the Moon,
and Sosquiquadrate of Saturn in the Zodiac, and in Mundo; these
were the Directions that destroyed Life, which may be seen pro
gressively arranged in the foregoing Table.
By Secondary Motion the giver of Life was in a violent station,
hi Quartile to the place of Mars in the Genhure ; the Sun and
Mars were in Mundane Square, and the Decimation of both were
nearly the sameJ the Moon was on the Mundane place of Mars in
the Nativity, and in Zodiacal Square to the Apheta in the
Geniture. In the Revolutional Figure for the nineteenth Year,
the Moon was applying to the Opposition ofSaturn, and Mercury,
and also to the Declination of Jupiter, Mars, and the Sun ; she
also applied to the Square of Mars in the Nativity, and had
separated from her Radical place. At the time she died, the
Hykg was near herplace in the Geniture, and the Moon was like
wise in Square to her own radical station, and was also in Quartile
to the place of Mars in the Nativity.
OR GENETHLIACAL ASTRONOMY. ]87
Several respectable Gentlemen who reside in Paris, have re
quested me to publish the Nativity of the Duke of Bordeaux : I
have complied with their requests, and have given his Geniture a
place in this publication. The time'of Birth communicated to
me, is thatwhich I have inserted in the following Figure. Those
Scientific persons who^are acquainted with the primitive principles
of Stellar power, will acknowledge, that this Nativity is a very
remarkable one, when considered in all its parts, which may bo
proved by .the illustration of the Precepts given in this Work.
At tho Baptism of this illustrious Native, who is now living, the
late Louis the eighteenth, spoke to the Assemblage as follows.
'Let us invoke for him the protection of the Mother of God, the
Queen ofthe Angels, let us implore her to watch over his Days,
to remove far from his Cradle the misfortunes with which it has
pleased Providence to afflict bis Relatives, and to conduct him by
a less rugged path, than I have trod to Eternal felicity.'
It will probably appear singular to some, that I have omitted
the Computations of all the various Arcs of Directions in this Ge
niture, and given them in others in a copious manner, throughout the
whole of this Work; my particular reasons for so doing must'
remain in obscurity, as I do not wish to give the least offence to
any party, and as I am not disposed to create discord, or multiply
disputations among those Characters, who are, or may be interested
in subjects that are yet in Oblivion, I therefore trust that1 I have
not acted improperly in omitting the primary' Directidns, and
Judgment, having given aU the correct numbers that are required
to complete the various Calculations, the sublimity of which can
not fail toelevate,the mind of those whoare inclined to contemplate
the infinite Wisdom, and power ofthe Omnipotent Creator, in
his wondrous Works. - .. .' . :

As several persons will doubtless be disposed to compute the
Directions in this Nativity, I have given the true Circlesof Positions
of the Planets, with their Oblique Ascensions, and Descensions,
under their own Poles, whichimmediately follow; theyareaccurate
ly Calculated, so that the Practitioners, may, without much
difficulty, or trouble, calculate the true Arcs in an accurate, and
explanatory manner, which will amply recompense them for their
labors, and give sufficient satisfaction.
The primary distance ofthe Sun from the Horoscope, is 55Â° 9',
and his Seminocturnal Arc 92Â° 39'; his duplicate horary times
below the Earth, are 30Â° 52', and his Pole of Position 24Â° 22',
under which his Oblique Ascenion is 186Â° 24'.
The distance of the Moon by her Latitude from the Zenith, is
53Â° 20', and her double diurnal horary times, 42Â° 46'; her Sc-.
midiurnal Arc is 128Â° 19'; these numbers produce her Pole 26Â°
SV, and her true Oblique Ascension 80Â° 15',
The distance of Saturn from the Western Horizon, is 59Â° 46',
and his double horary times above the Earth, are 30Â° 38', his
Circle of Position will then become 22Â°, and his Oblique Descen*
sion, 11Â° 23'.
Jupiter's distance from the West, is 26Â° 51', and his duplicate
horary times above the Earth, 27Â° 20'; his Semidiurnal Arc is
8 1 Â° 58', and his Pole 37Â° 26', consequently his Oblique Descen-
sion will be 342Â° 22'.
The distance of Mars from the Northern Angle, is 10Â° 44',
therefore his Seminocturnal Arc is 105Â° 26', and his double horary
times 35Â° 8'; his Pole of Position will then be 6Â° 42', and his
Oblique Ascension 213Â° 41',
The primary distance of Venus from the Horoscope, is 6Â° 20',
and her duplicate horary times above the Earth 35Â° 4' ; her Circle
ofPosition willthen be 47Â° 3', and her ObliqueAscension 127Â° 28'.

The next is the Geniture of a Gentleman, who was Born near
Boston, October 7th, 1789, 13h. OM. P M; and died on the

This Native hatfacquired 2onsideraBle knowledge In thW.i;dfir-
partment of Astronomy, which the Astral significators of Science,
&c. â¢xhibit in the following Figure of his Birth. His noble and
excellent qualifications, and pious demeanour were such, that all
those who had the pleasure of his acquaintance, soon became con
vinced of his superior Talents in Literature, which, combined with
a dignified Mind, free from Pride, and ostentation, truly adorn
the character of the Scholar, and the Gentleman. He was not
much attached to the sports of the Field, yet he sometimes accom
panied my . Father in Shooting, and Coursing, in the Lordships
of Helpringham, Hale, Heckington, Swaton, Scredington, Spanby,
and Donington, &c. &c. He computed the Moon's Direction
to the quartile of Saturn in the Zodiac, in his own Geniture, (that
Luminary being the giver of Life,) and observed, that he believed
it was a baneful Direction, as Saturn was in the eighth House, .
and posited in the Watery sign Pisces, he therefore told my
Father that he anticipated considerable danger to his Life by
Water, when the Effects of that Direction were in operation, but
his Judgment in this case was founded on the false principles of
the old School, for it is not the lord of the Eighth, nor Planets
posited in the Eighth, that can produce Death, butthe trueAnareta
only, which will always be found to perform that office ; hence it is
of no consequence where the destroying Star is stationed at the time
of Birth, neither is it of any importance what Mansion of Heaven
it governs in the Radix, for it will always retain its own destructive
power, except its influence becomes defeated by other Motions,
which may be visibly discovered by its Progressive movements, at
the period when the giver of Life comes in contact with its Malefic
Directions, joined withothers of a similar nature in the Zodiac, and
Mundo; for ifthe Hyleg be not then assisted by benefic Rays, and
2D
CELESTIAL PHrLOSOP&Y,
if the power of the Anareta be not counteracted at the same taM
by Directions, or Terms ofa reverse denomination, then consequent
ly dissolution will tate place, in defiance of alf human exertions;
butthe Examples I have given in this Work, will doubtless be
deemed-sufficient to establish the verity of these observations.

198 CELESTIAL PHILOSOPHY.
This Native was Married twice, the first Matrimonial Union
took place under the Effects ofthe Direction of the Moon to the
Trine ofthe Sun in the Zodiac; and his Marriage to his second
Wife was solemnized, when the Moon was directed^' the Sextije
of Jupiter in Mundo, by Direct Motion. At this Age oftwenty-
three Years and one Month, the Hyleg was directed to-the Square
of Saturn in the Zodiac, at which time, according to tie' Native's
Judgment, he expected his Life would be exposed to the greatest
danger by Water, but no daiigeroas Accident of any kind took
place, for the Moon was then directed to the Rapt Parallel of
Venus, and her Terms, which destroyed the apparent dangerous
Effects ofthat single Direction; but though it had not power to
destroy Life, yet it produced a lingering disease, which continued
until the time of his Death. The Mortal Directions which I
previously computed, were, the Apheta to the Parallel of Mars in
the Zodiac, the Semiquartile of Saturn in the World, by Converse
Motion, and Square ofthat Malefic in Mundo, by Direct Direc
tion, succeeded by the Hyleg to the Semiquartile of Saturn in the
Zodiac, by Converse Motion, and Sesquiquadrate of Mercury in
the Zodiac, and Parallel of that promittor in Mundo, by Direct,
and Converse Motion ; these were the Directions which I allowed
for his Death, and though the Moon the giver of Life, was direct
ed to the Sextile of Jupiter in the Zodiac, which appeared to dis
solve a large portion of the violence of the above train of Directions,
yet his benign qualities were wholly destroyed, for he was directed
at the same time to the Rapt Parallel of Saturn, he also ascended
to the Body of Mars, and applied to the opposition of Saturn, so
that he could produce no assistance, for being thus overcome by the
power of the Enemies, he specified the nature of the disease that
destroyed Life, which was a Consumption, and though every human
effort was used for the recovery of the Native, yet all exertions
proved ineffectual, as it was not in the power of the most learned
Physician, to subdue the progress of that dreadful disease, which
terminated the Mortal existence of this valuable member of society
OR GENETHLIACAL ASTRONOMY. 199
In the Secondary Directions, the Sun was applying to the Square
of Mars, and the Moon had nearly obtained the Declination ofthe
Sun ; the applications from the Progression, were of an inimical
power. Ln his last Revolution, the Hyleg^was posited on the place
of Saturn in the Nativity, the Sun, and Mercury were also in
Quartile to that Malefic from Cardinal Signs, and at the time he
died, Saturn was posited in the Oriental Horizon, in Opposition
to Venus, there was likewise a new Moon a few- Hours before
his Death, which was celebrated in a violent part of the Heavens,
and boththe Luminaries were at the same time conjoined with
Mars in the Radical Ascendant, and in Quartile to the place of
Â£he Hyleg jn the Geniture.
2E
CELESTrAL PHILOSOPHY,
As a further confirmation of trie power, and important use of the
trueProrogator, and thattheAnglescannot becomputedto Directions
in the Zodiac, I have inserted the following Nativity, which is that
of a young Man, who was Born iu the City of Lincoln, March
llth, 1802, 20n. 12m, P. M. and died on the 2nd. of June,
1823, Aged twenty-one Years, two Months, and twenty-one Days.
When this Native was eighteen YeMSof Ags, he gave me the
above time of his Birth, which lie said wew carefully taken by his
Grandfather, who remained confident that the estimate time could
not possibly differ three Minutes frdw the true Radix. As seen
as I had viewed the Figure of the Heavens, I told the Native I
had rather not make any observations thereon; he asked me why I
took so little notice of it, and further observed, that he did not wish
to give me trouble, without remuneration; Hold him that the whole
Position, (when properly considered in all its parts,) was of a violent
nature, and indicated severe afflictions, and short Life, but when
I delivered this impartial Judgment, and' that the twenty-first Year
of his Age would prove fatal, he appeared not to place confidence
in what I related, being at that time in a good state of Health; he
said there were many learned Men in this Nation who did not
sanction this Study, and if the art of Calculating Nativities was
to be depended on without error, it appeared extraordinary that the
Truth of the Science was not publicly developed before the nine-,
teenth Century. I told him I bad no doubt that there were
many persons of high respectability, who, having received a liberal
Education, studied this Science in a private manner,boing perfectly
satisfied with its truth, and utility, and I was also well convinced,
that there were others that appeared to Ije rick and pious, who
traduced, and condemned these Astronomical enquiries, and at the
sametimeappliedthemselves closely to the Study and Practice of
other Artsofa detestable nature, which are too abominable for de
scription; the sanguine actions of some of those beings, who are
frequently bedecked in the Robes of innocence, will never
be forgotten, as by their command, the notorious cannibals,
(on the verge of the Sepulchre,J received directions to Jinish
OR GENETIILIACAV ASTRONOMY. 201
their last unmerciful Hepas?, o$ the withered. Hmbs of
dying individuals. The Native asked -mo .what my opinion
Was, respecting Deaf, and Dumb i'eo^Je^.a^.sp^le oi Sexes
frequently visit the City of XflwlflV ajjd spjesiivto tcfofasirange
things, coaceraing the Fortune of those jwho o$${p tp'^hern for
advice; I told hjnj they were a.l] ktfAYBfj ftnd \*atS*bonds,
and that I was sorry to observe.n^any Â«$pe>#a,bJe Pergqns-.became
the dupes of such notorious impostors,, as ,s,proe aTthem- cottjd hear,
and speak as occasion-rco^lresj Vu$ i a^way^ observed that those
who Possess superior Talon^ to l^ftfoingy never notice such Beings,
but view their tile, and artfultftetensions wii,h the contempt they
merit. But theDeaf, and Dumb, are not the pnly characters who
impose on the credulous, for there are others,, who, ,being,destitute of
shame, are now Publishing the refuse' otseyeT^-disgrtfoeful Arts,
which ought to be treated with uniyersa,l contempt, in this enlighten
ed Ago.
THE MAGICIAN OP fHE KtJfETCEKtHrtiNTtiRV, DISSECTED,
Reader behold ! the Sage fllaggcian jtries,
To show his Arts, with Wonder, and surprise}
His skill is us'd, with all his kndvish themes,
To dupe his Readers, with romantic. Breams j
He aims at Cash, and ifhis Works wi}} sfill,
The Pirate is conceal 'd, and all is we]l ;
The learned Writer, hides Jits proper Name,
Which proved he's not quite destitute qf Shamey
He lays his Bait, with inweaiing Arts,
To show what ghostl? sechets hp imparts J
Falsehoodfor truth, lie's not asham'd to tell,
Because vve know not where the sage does dwell;
From all the deep besearcjjes he has made,
He's in the dark, and carries on his Trade ;
Arm'd by deception, he, with sapient care,
Brings Anecdotes to make the vulgar stare.
2e2
202 CELESTIAL PHILOSOPHY
Romances oft, the thoughtless mind engage,
More than the Troth, in this our learned Age;
Deceit and Guile are mask'd,âMark well the Man,
Then you'll discover the imPostor9 plan ;
By Rites he'll teach you, without fear, or dread,
To hold Nocturnal converse with the dead;
Thus through his Visions, he's dispos'd to stuinr
His learned Pages, for the sake of Gain ;
By tricks like these, his knavish efforts show,
What wit, and learned Parts can sometimes do?
His talismans, (those wondrous things of note,)
With all their force, were never worth a Groat ;
There's Geomancy, which some say, excel
All other Wonders, if its manag'd well ;
His puny schemes, to every Man of sense,.
Declare at once, the Pirates impudence ;
All those alluring Artsr to puzzle Youth,
He has reviv 'd, without a word of Truth ;
Come candid Readers, now behold the Snare
Is laid to take your Cash, therefore beware;
For all these things are nothing more, or less,
Than vile deceit, in its polluted dress ;
proofs i demand, but nothing can obtain,
Except old stories, insolent, and Vain;
Some Students may, (without much care,) imbibe
The ghostly visions of this learned Tribe;
When HONEST PARTRIDGE wrote, he took aview
And gave Examples of this learned Crew;
He stiles their Practice, 'cheating tricks', and then,.
Proclaims them villains, and dishonest Men;
Now Straggling Members, spread-those forged Lies,
Which in their tender conscience, they despise ;
I therefore trust, the Students will disdain,
Those groundless Arts, which I've exposed plain;
Alarm'd at truth, the Pious Jugglersfly,
Which soon discover all their VILLA NY.

As there are several Pretenders to this Science, who consider
themselves able to direct the Angles to the Aspects of the Stars in
the Zodiac, contrary to the true Motions of the Heavens, I could
wish to be informed, how they would proceed to make the Square
of Mars, by their Method, correspond with the time ofthis Native's
decease; though I believe it would not be difficult to anticipate
what they would bring forth, as a plausible Cause of this Native's
Sickness, and Death ; they certainly must bo convinced, (if they
know any thing relative to the true Doctrine of the Sphere,) that
such Motions as they consider to be right, are certainly wholly
undemonstrable, which the use of the Celestial Globe will evi
dently Prove, for it must appear obvious to those who are acquainted
with the true Method of Directional Motion, that in the preceding
Geniture, there is but one true Method, by which the Ascendant
can be directed to the Square of Mars, and that is, by directing the
Zenith to the Body of that Planet ; for when that Direction is
finished, which is when Mars ascends exactly on the Meridian,
then, and then only, the Ascendant will come to the true Quartile
of that Star* in the World ; not byany vain, and imaginary Move
ments, but by those unerring, and demonstrable Motions of the
Heavens, which become visibly apparent to those observers, who,
by diligence, and delight, contemplate the regular harmony, and
Effects of the Celestial Bodies, in their different stations, in all parts
of the Heavens.
In the Geniture ofthis unfortunate young Man, the Asciendant
is the giver of Life, and the Directions which I computed for his
Death, were, the Horoscope to the Square of Mam in Mundo,
followed by the Body of the Moon, which will destroy Life in
any Geniture, when the Hyleg is not supported by benevolent
Directions, which is the casein this Example. At the time of his
Death, the Moon was directed to the Sesquiquadrate of Saturn in
Mundo, by Converse Motion, and also to the Square of that
Malefic in the Zodiac, by Converse Direction, followed by her
own- Semiquartile in the World, and the Sun to the Parallel of
2f2
210 CELESTIAL PHILOSOPHY.
Saturn's Declination ; and though these violent Directions Lave
nO:power to destroy Life, yet, beingjoined with those 'which were'
the true Cause of dissolution, they increased. their'Mortal'power.
It would be unnecessary were I to point out the nature of the eonV
flicting diseases, which terminated bis Mortal career, as that must
appear plain to all those, who are but superficially conversant in
this Sublime speculation. .
In computing the Secondary Directions, the Luminaries were'
in Conjunction, and both the Malerics afflicted'the Eastern, and'
Western Angles, by an Opposition ; Jupiter wasin the Ascendant^ .
in conjunction with Saturn, and in Opposition to Mars,1 where*-
the Lights, at the lime of the Progression, became afflicted'by the"
subsequent inimical Motions, below the Earth ;tl* Mboit was-irt-
Quartileto her own placein the Nativity, and was likewise in-the
same violent Aspectwith the Sun in the Mrmdane- Circle y the*
three superior Planets, having nearly the same Declination-. - Irr-
the Revolutional- Figure for his twenty-first Year, the Moon; and'
Mars, the Mortal Promittors, were in Conjunction withthe Sim;
and Saturn was near the Ascendant; the Moon was likewise in- a"
Mundane- Square to her radical place. At the time he died, that'
Luminary was near the Zodiacal, and. Mundane Square of the-
Sun, -and applied to the-obnoxious Rays of Saturn, and-' Mars,
from malignant stations, and Terms; the Moon alsoappliedHo ther
place of the S.n in the Radix, and Saturn was in Square to the
place of Mars in the Geniture, and that Mortal Promittor (Ky -
primary Direction,) was iu Quartile to the Zodiacal position of-
Saturn, and Jupiter, in the Nativity, ~.

Iff filte Nativity; it may seem doubtful to'soroe, what-Starought-
to^Be eekwted as^the projisb Moderator; but aecorilingstorny JUdg5'
ment, no doubts on that subject eau-possibly appear*-for the Geni--
ture is': DiÂ»rnalj;and tljereforo tlie " Sun; by being ! posited > in the-

does not occupy'an- Aphetica^rflaee, neither <Hh the1 Moon daim"
that Dominion, as she- is trader the Earth, in- the' Iinnm- Oteli.:
Now as Mercury is posited in the Ascendant, ho may appear to
claim the Aphctical influence, and more particularly, because he
seems to dispose of the preceding new Moon, which happened in
the twenty-eighth Degree of Virgo, in the Dignities of Mercury j
therefore there is no doubt, that some would select that Star, to
represent the Aphetical Office, but the Horoscope advocates would
take the Ascendant for Hyleg, and thus, by directing that point of
the Heavens to the Body of Mercnry, for the Native's Death,
with a little alteration in Time, they would become culpable in
adhering to those inconsistencies, which cannot bo adjusted with
out confusion ; and thus by adopting this absurd practice, they
would then direct their supposed Prorogators to each other, (with
out the power of a proper Anareta,) as the apparent cause of the
Native's Death.
The above Method ofselecting the significator of Life, is nothing
more than presisting in errors, and rejecting Truth, whichwill show
the Practitioners, as they advance in this Study, that they
will never be able to perform any Computation worthy of notice,
so long as they adhere to such groundlessnotions; for in this Na
tivity, it is impossible for the Ascendant to be Hyleg, neither can
Mercury, or Venus, possess any portion of Vital influence; but the
CELESTIAL PHILOSOPHY,
true Aphetical power, belongs to Saturn alone, be having the proper
Dignities, to qualify him to receive, and support that office; for if the
Latitude ofthe Moon be properly considered, at the time of the
preceding Conjunction ofthe Luminaries* it will then appear evident,
that she was in Square to Saturn, and disposed ofhim atthat time;
and in the Nativity, was also in reception with that Planet, as the
true giver of Life, having each of them nearly the same Parallel of
Declination ; the Hyleg was also in Quartile with the Sun in the
Geniture, and occupied the proper Aphetical place in the Heavens;
so that I did not discover any difficulty in selecting the proper
Apheta, which I positively affirm, belongs to Saturn in this Nativity/
which is proved by the quality of the Native's Death, and the
Directions that were the true Causes thereof,

218 CELESTIAL PHILOSOPHY.
There can be no difficulty in defining the quality of this Native'
Death, for all the Celestial Bodies afflict each other by alarming
configurations ; the Sun is of the nature of the enemies, being in
Square to Saturn, from Cardinal Signs, and cadent places ; he is in
opposition to Jupiter, and that Planet is afflicted by the Quartile
of Saturn in the Zodiac, and Mundo, and likewise by the Parallel
of Mars' Declination ; the Moon is in a Mundane Square to the
Ascendant, and is afflicted by the Quartile of Mercury, and
Zodiacal Parallel of Saturn, and that Planet, being the Prorogator,
is posited in the watery Sign Cancer, in the Ninth House, which
with other additional, and malignant testimonies, prove in the
clearest manner, that Drowning would be the cause ofthe Native's
Death.
Hence we have sufficient arguments to confirm theviolence ofthe
Native's dissolution, and the Anaretical Directions, demonstrate
the time thereof, in the plainest manner ; for at the period of his
Death, Saturn, the giver of Life, was directed to the Parallel of
Mars, by the Motion of the Primum Mobile, and also to the
Semiquartile of that Malefic in Mundo, by Direct Direction,
with the Square of Mercury in the Zodiac, which is of the nature
of the Malefics, followed by eight others, without any benevolent
assistance, to diminish their destructive power; it is also worthy of
observation, that the Sun, Moon, Ascendant, and Part of Fortune,
were all afflicted by violent Directions, united with the Mortal
train to the Hyleg : the first Direction for Death, was six Months
deficient in shewing its Effeots, but the Figure I have given, is
computed according to the estimate time, so that if it was two
Minutes earlier, that Direction to the Apheta, (at the head of the
Mortal train,) would correctly correspond with the time when he
departed this Life ; .all the others follow in regular order, which
may be seen in the Table of Directions.
In computing the other Motions, it will be found, that Saturn,
the giver of Life, had descended below the Western Horizon by
OR GENETHLIACAL ASTRONOMY. 219
Secondary Direction, and was in Square to Mercury in the Zodiac;
the two Luminaries were in obnoxious places, and Terms ; the
Moon also applied to the radical place of Mars; and in Mundo,
was configurated with Saturn, Mars, and Mercury in the Progres
sion from the superior Angles. In the Revolutional Figure for the
sixteenth Year ofthe Native's Age, both the Malefics had nearly
the same Declination ; Saturn was in Opposition to his place in the
Geniture, and received the hostile rays of the Sun from a violent
part ofthe fleavens, and Mercury was on the place of Mars in the
Nativity. At the time he was Drowned, (which was January
5th, 1814, at seven o'Clock in the Morning.) the Moon was near
the Cusp of the Western Angle, applying to the Square of Mars,
and opposition of the Sun; the Apheta was conjoined with the Sun
in the East, united with the Parallel of Mercury's Declination,
he being in Zodiacal Quartile to Mars in the Geniture ; the Moon,
was in Mundane Square to her place in the Nativity, and applied
to the Zodiacal position of the Apheta at the time of. Birth,
220 CELESTIAL PHILOSOPHY.
' Miss Amelia Farrow, was Born in Lincoln, on the 2nd of
March, 1799, at 6a, 45m. A. M ; and departed this Life, on the
4th of October, 1824;' Aged twenty-five Years, seven Months,
and two Days.
The above time was given to me by the Native, a few Years
before her Death, which she said was taken with the greatest care,
by her Parents. I first observed, that the Sun was the giver of Life,
and at the Age ofseventeen, eighteen, and nineteen, he was directed
to the Squares of Satnrri, and the Moon in the Zodiac, from violent
Cardinal Signs, the Effects of which, I judged, produced consid
erable danger to her Life, by Sickness, &c; she said in the Years
I mentioned, she was violently irrdisposed, and was not expected to
live; but those Directions, though 'they certainly were of a danger
ous nature, could not destroy Life. I will therefore prove to the
Students, (in as plain a manner as possible, and in few words,) the
true Causes which defeated those apparent Mortal Directions,
from executing the work of Mortality."'" ""
It is evident that nothing worthy of notice can be performed in
this noble Science, without such Directions as are accurately com
puted, by which, the time, and quality of all important Events, are
previously known; but though these Facts admit of no refutation,
yet there are other subjects of considerable importance, which the
Students ought to know, if they are not too learned to receive in
struction. The Sun (to whom the Dignity of Hyleg belongs,)
is strong, and free from affliction in this Geniture, he is in conjunc
tion, and Mundane Parallel with Venus, and near her Parallel
of Declination; ho is also applying to the Sextile of Jupiter in the
Zodiac, and is received in the Terms of that benefic, as he ascends
the Eastern Horizon, by which his powerful influence (as Proro-
gator,)is considerably augmented; now as Saturn, and the Moon,
are in Opposition to each other, from Cardinal Signs, it clearly
shows the apparent fury of their Quartilos, when the Hyleg was
directed to them in the Eastern Angle; for when the Sun came to
OR GENETHLIACAL ASTRONOMY. 221
the Squares of Saturn, and the Moon, he was then directed to the
Sextile of Jupiter in Mundo, by Converse Motion, and also to the
I 1 Quartile of thatbenefic in the Zodiac, by Converse Direction; and
'it must be further observed, that when those two Malefic Directions
were in operation, Saturn was directed to the Sextile of Jupitei;
in the World, by Converse Motion, and also to the trine of that
benefic, by Direct Direction ; the Moon was also directed to the
Mundane Trine of Jupiter, by Converse Motion, neat the same
i period. Hence it is plain, thaMhe places ofall theviolent Promit-1
I tors, and their Directions, must always be strictly, regarded, as
well as those of the Significators; for when the Promiiton
are unable to execute their Mortal Effects, owing to benign Direc
tions, and Terms, to which they are joined, they then only pro
duce diseases, &c ; so that when the giver of Life, in this Geniture,
) was directed to the Quartiles of Saturn, and the Moon, in theZodiac,
those two Promittors, then received the powerof both the benefics,
by Directional Motion, to which they were united in the Mundane
Circle. From these remarks, the Students may observe, that the
time of Death ought not to be pronounced, when the Hyleg meets
with Malefic Directions, until they have properly examined the
intervention of all the benefic rays, and those places in the Heavens,
where the Promittors arrive at that time ; for if their violent power
be defeated, by other Motions, so that their influence becomes of .
a reverse quality, Life will bo preserved ; but when they retain
their own destructive power, without alteration, or diminution, the
Native will then be removed from the land of the Living.

228 CELESTIAL PHILOSOPHY,
The Directions that destroyed the Life of this Native, were, the
Sun Hyleg, to the Parallels of Mars in Mundo, by Direct, and
Converse Motion, and also to the Zodiacal Parallel of Mercury, and
Bodies of the Moon, and Mars, with the Parallel of Mars' Declina
tion, the Mundane Square of Saturn, and Quartile of the Moon in
the World, by Direct Direction; and though the rays of Jupiter
interposed in the Mortal train, he was unable to abate the influence
thereof, being afflicted by tho furious Directions of the Malefics at
the time of Death, by which his benevolent qualities were destroyed,
both in strength, and operation, so that he could not render any
assistance to preserve Life, though ho properly specified the quality
of Death, of which I need not make any comments, having (in
preceding Examples,) stated the nature of the Mortal diseases,
produced by that Star, when his power was overcome by obnoxious
rays.
By secondary Direction, the Hyleg applied to the Square of
Saturn, and the Moon was nearly in Quartile with the Sun from
Cardinal Signs, and subterranean positions. In her last Revolution,
the Moon separated from the Body ofthe Sun, and applied to the
Opposition of Mars, who afflicted the Horoscope by his opposite
rays ; Saturn was then in Square to Mercury, being posited on the
place of Jupiter, and Mars in the Nativity. At the time she died,
the Moon was applying to the Quartiles of Saturn, and Mars, both
of which were in Square to the true significator of Life, in the
Geniture.
My observations aro founded on Truth, and will ever remain
irrefutable; but there are many noisy 'pretenders to this Science,
who believe themselves able to perform wonders, and in fact,' if
wonders are to be executed by long Epistles, with a host of
wAimsicalcAimeras, and sentences without meaning, I have no
doubt that such characters may be esteemed superior to theircontem
poraries ;I will therefore give thefollowing true time of a Female's
Birth, that thry mayerect a Figure, and pronounce Judgment
OR GENETHLIACAL ASTRONOMY 229
thereon. The Native was Born near Lincoln, on the 29th of May,
1797, at 7h. 20M, P M; andat the time ofmy writing this, (which
is, November 3rd, 1825,) she is in a good state ofHealth. The
Sun is the giver of Life, and has passed the Bodies of Saturn, Mer
cury, and Mars, with their old Terms, and the Moon at the same
time was directed to those Promittors by Converse Direction; now
if those learned Gentlemen in this Science, are able to prove by
true Astronomical demonstration, why those Directions did not
destroy Life, and when the Native's dissolution will take place, I
shall then acknowledge that they are acquainted with some oftho
true principles ofthis Sublime, and incomparable Study.
230 CELESTIAL PHILOSOPHY,
The next is the Nativity of a Child, that was Born near Don-
ington, in the County of Lincoln, on the 6lh of September, 1814,
at 7h. JOM. P M; and died July 4th, 1825, Aged ten Years, and
ten Months, nearly. â¢ , -
The stations of the Stars in this Geniture, plainly show the short
duration ofthe Native's Life; for their qualities in the different parts
of the Heavens, are malignant, and impotent, which, with the Radi
cal affliction of the Prorogator, produced an ill stale of Health,
during the time she lived ; and though the most judicious means
were used for her recovery, I judged, that in a few Years, she would
exchange this transitory Life, for a glorious immortality, as all the
vital significators are afflicted in the Zodiac, and in the World, with
out assistance, which show the rapid approach of Death, in the
early part of Life.
This Native died by Directions to the Hyleg, and not by the
violence of the- position ; and in selecting the true Aphetical signi-
ficator, I have no doubt that some would take their favorite point,
the Ascendant; but I shall endeavor to undeceive such persons by
this Example; for as neither ofthe Luminaries are in an Aphetical
position, the true significator of Life, is Jupiter, who has the proper
Dignities to claim that power, accordingto the true principles of the
IMMoktal PtoleMY : for that Star is in an Aphetical place, and
disposed of the preceding full Moon, and at the time of Birth, was
rw'er of the Part of Fortune, being conjoined with the Sun, and
in exact Trine to the Moon in Mundo, and also in Opposition to
the Ascendant. The following is the Figure of Birth, with the
Directions, which produced the Terminus Vit<e.
'She foil,
Like some fair Lilly, or a Poppy green.
Which from its Parent Root, the Blast hath rent.'

236 CELESTIAL PHILOSOPHY,
I calculated this Nativity in the Month of November, 1821, and
foretold the time of her Death, which is well known to many. It
is probable thatsome may object to my selecting Jupiter, as the true
significator of Life, because he is under the Earth, and under the
rays of the Sun also, which, (to those who consider themsolves
learned in this Science,) may appear contrary to my rules, and
practice. I do aftirm that the Luminaries, &c. when in a subter
ranean location, cannot exercise the Hylegiacal power, except when
they are within the proper limits of the Eastern, and Western
Horizon. Now ifthe Latitude, and Declination of Jupiter, are
taken into consideration, his distance from the Western Angle, will
be found to qualify him tobecome the true Apheta ; the authenticity
ofwhich, may be proved by those who think proper to compute
the true Motions, and distances, according to the Examples I have
given in this Work.
In the preceding Table, the Reader will observe, that there are
twelve Directions to the Hyleg, which formed the Mortal train, in
regular succession; the Body of Mercury, and the Terms of Saturn,
were first encountered by the Apheta, which shewed the time of
Death; and as Mercury is in Zodiacal, and Mundane Sesquiqua-
drate with Saturn, and also in Quartiie to the Moon, and near tho
Body ofMars, and his Terms, ho consequently becameofthe nature
of both the Enemies. The Hyleg was directed to the Sextile of
Venus in the Zodiac, which were united with the Directions for
â dissolution, but hor rays could not render the least assistance, though
their union shewed the quality of the lingering disease, by which
the Native's Life was destroyed.
The Sun was conjoined with Jupiter, Mars, and Mercury, by
Secondary Direction, and Saturn afflicted the Horoscope, in which
position he communicated his violent power to the Luminaries, and
Benefics in the Progression. In the Rovolutional Figure for the
tenth Year, the Moon was in a violent Sign, and in a cadent station ,
having separated from the Quartiie of Mars, she then applied to the
OR GENETHLIACAL ASTRONOMY. 237
Square of Saturn in the Zodiac ; Mercury was in Opposition to the
Ascendant, and the three superiors had nearly the same Parallel of
Declination; Saturn was also on the place of the Moon in the
Nativity, in which position he was in Quartile with the Sun, and
in Square to (lie Radical place of that Luminary. At the time
she died, the Sun, Mars, and Mercury, were in Conjunction; the
Moon was also afflicted, and the Hyleg received the malignant
power ofSaturn, and Mars, in the Mundano Circle, all which con
firm the verity of these important Calculations, and the baneful
Effects of the primary Motions, particularly when their rays are
projected in an uniform manner, from Nocturnal applications, to
the true significator of Life.
CELESTIAL PHILOSOPHY,
The next is the Geniture of Eliza Ingraham, who lived at
Billingborough, near Folkingham, Lincolnshire ; she was Born on
the 2nd of August, 1771, at 21h. 55M. P. M.
The time ofthis Birth was lately given to me, by one of the
Native's Female Relatives, now living, who requested me to state
the period, when any particular Event would take place ; I was also
desired to ascertain , whether the Native-was likely to Travel, or
take long Voyages, and, if she would be fortunate, or unfortunate,
in general, during Life. As soon as I had examined the violent
positions of the Celestial Bodies, and the Mortal Directions in
Infancy, I immediately told her, I was confident, that her relation
was dead, and that she died before the end of the sixth Year; the
answer which I received, was, that my Judgment was true, and,
that she departedthis Life, at thetime I mentioned. I then asked,
what induced her to try to deceive me, by false questions, as I was
not disposed to waste my time, to satisfy her curiosity; she said, her
chief motive was, because she wished to be convinced of the truth
of the Science, and, that she had now sufficiently proved the accu
racy of my Judgment; she said she had always been an unbeliever,
and considered the Science to be a false, and groundless Study ;
but was now ofa different opinion, and firmly believed in its'truth,
when practised by skilful Professors. I asked her, ifshe could put
me in possession ofthe time of her own Geniture, she answered in
the affirmative, and producâ¢d the true time thereof, written by her
late Father. 1 then computed the Directions of the Ilyleg, to all
the mortal Promittors, (which were seven in number,) and, that
she might not any longerconsider these Astronomicel Computations,
as imaginary whims, and vain delusions, I informed her, that before
the end ofthe Month of June, 1832, she would then, no longer
remain an inhabitant of this Earthly World.

242 CELESTIAL PHILOSOPHY',
In this Nativity the Sun is the giver of Life, and as he was
surrounded by the formidable irradiations of Saturn, Mars, and
the Moon, without any assistance from Jupiter, or Venus, I per
emptorily affirmed, that the Child died, when the giver of Life
was directed to the Zodiacal Parallel of Saturn, followed by six
others that were joined in the deadly train, which I have inserted
in the preceding Table* The position of Mercury, conld not
produce any injury to Life, because the Terms of Jupiter, immedi
ately succeeded his Radical station, but the rapidity of the subse
quent Directions of the Moon, and Mars in the Zodiac, and
Mundo, shewed, that the quality of Death was a putrid Fever,
which soon destroyed the Native's Life. If the Students think
proper to attend to these Examples, and lirst select the Hyleg in
their Calculations, they will be able to discover all premeditated
deception, which may be artfully brought in action to traduce, and
dishonor this Celestial Science. This Nativity was given to me,
after the Native had been forty-six Years in her Grave.
In computing the other Motions of the Stars which have supe
rior dominion in those places, where the interjacent rays of the
Promittors form their union with the true significator of Life, it
will plainly appear, that their Effects were powerfully increased in
the ascending part of the Heavens, by whieh thei' violence was
collected from both the superior Angles, according to their progres
sive Movements above the Earth. In the Native's last Revolu
tion, Saturn was in the Ascendant, in Square to Jupiter, and
Mars, from Cardinal Signs, and Angular stations; Venus was
combust ofthe Sun, and the Moon applied to her own Radical
place; and likewise to the Quartile of the Sun, the true Proroga-
tor. All these violent applications, when compared with the Pri
mary Motions, plainly prove their Effects, in conveying additional
power to those Directions, which produced the Native's Death'
OR GENETHUACAL ASTRONOMY. 243
The following Nativity is that of Mr. John Ward, who was
Born at Scotter, near Wragby, in the County of Lincoln, October
23rd, 1791, at 6h. 48M. P. M, and died on the 7th of May,
1809, Aged seventeen Years, six Months, and fourteen Days.
The Celastial Bodies in this Geniture, exhibit a remarkable
appearance ofviolence, for they are all under the Earth, except
Saturn, who is in the twelfth House, by his Latitude, Retrograde,
and in Opposition to Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, and the Sun, from
violent Constellations, and places : the Moon is applying by a Con
verse Motion, to the Body of Mars, who is in the Nadir, near the
Heart of the Lion, that Malefic being one of the Mortal Promit-
tors in the Directions for dissolution.
The Death ofthis Native was occasioned by his drinking cold
stagnated Water from a Ditch, which I have reasons to judge,
(from the whole position,) was considerably impregnated with
Animal matter of a poisonous quality, from the Effects of which,
he languished a considerable time in severe affliction, before his
personal extinction took place.

448 CELESTIAL PHILOSOPHY,
The Horoscope is the Apheta in this Nativity, and the Directions
that destroyed Life, were, the Semiquartile of Saturn in the World,
the Mundane Square of Mars, and Sesquiquadrate of the Sun,
their true Astronomical Computations, are performed as follow.
The Right Ascension of the Medium Cosli, is, 310Â° 12', which
subtracted from the Right Ascension of Saturn, with the Circle,
374Â° 15', his distance from the Zenith will be, 64Â° 3', from which
subtracting his triplicate diurnal horary times, 47Â° 6', the Arc of
Direction, of the Ascendant to the Semiquartile ofSaturn in Mundo,
will be 10Â° 57'.
The Horoscope's Direction to the Mundane Square of Mars, is-
ascertained, by subtracting the Right Ascension of the Nadir, 130Â°
12', from the Right Ascension of Mars, with his Latitude, 148Â° 42',
and the Direction's Arc then becomes, 18Â° 30'.
The Right Ascension of the Imum Cceli, is, 130Â° 12', and that '
of the Sun, 208Â° 12', by subtraction, the distance of the Sun from
the Northern Angle, is, 78Â° ()', from which his treble nocturnal
horary times, 53Â° 0', being subtracted, the Arc of Direction of the
Ascendant to the Mundane Sesquiquadrate of the Sun, will be, '
5t5Â° 0'.
The Effects ofthese Directions to the giver of JAk, were the
true Cause of the Native's Death, and in consequence ofthe violence
ofthe position, the Directions of the Benefics could not give any
support to the Aphetical point; the Sun's Direction to the Quartile
of Mars in the Zodiac, was united with those to the Hyleg, that
produced bis demise ; but their combined power was retarded for
a time, owing to the stations of the Promittors, as they slowly
approached the Anaretical places, in those subterranean parts of
the Heavens, where their mortal rays became in contact with the
true significator of Life.
OR GENETHLIACAL ASTRONOMY. 249
fn adjusting the Secondary Directions, and comparing them
with the other motions of the Stars in their Genethliacal stations,
wo find the Moon posited in the Western Angle, in opposition to
Mercury, and the Sun, and applying to the Quartile of Mars, in
the Radix, who was separating from his own place at the time of
Birth, and near the Moon's plaee in the Nativity. In the Revo-
lutional Figure for the seventeenth year of his age, the;Moon was
in Opposition to the Radical Ascendant, and Mars was near the
Moon's place in the Geniture ; these configurations of the Stars,
when their Declinations are considered, with the Progrâ¢ssion, &u.
evidently show their violence, as they assume the most formidable
appearanee, in uniting their power with the mortal primary
Directions. At the time the Native died, the Moon was in Square
to the superior Malefic, and Jupiter was in Opposition to Mars ;
Venus was likewise in opposition with Saturn, by which the
Benefics were afflicted by both the Malefics, at the time of Death.

250 CELESTIAL fMLQSOEHY. > : .
. The next is the Nativity of Me. Geoige Goldiag, of :North
Hyckham, near Lincoln; he was born,on the I0th .of August,
l,753,ni So. 45m. P. M,,; and died June 26th, t1822, aged sixty-
eight years, ten months, and sixteen days.
I was.personally acquainted with this Native, a lew years before
his death ; his honesty, and integrity, combined with every
inestimable virtue, which constitute the human character, are far
beyond the limits of my .feeble power to describe. In the early
part of.his.life, he moved in a respectable station, but -.before his
dissolution, he was placed in adverse circumstances, yet his firmness
of mind, probity, and fidelity, remained the same ; and -though die
was insulted by the vulgar, and treated with, unbecoming insolence.,
by ignoble persons, yet lie was always unmoved, and in the midst
of all his difficulties, and WRONGS, he possessed that christian
fortitude, which enabled him calmly to view those storms of afflic
tion, (the effects of which, he was unable to mitigate,) with a
serene, and smiling countenance.
Testators should, by wills, or deeds, employ,
Honest Trustees, who never will annoy
The Orphan's Rights ; but then, ifthey loo late,
Those Reptiles in Sheejps clothing, nominate,
The die is cast, they'll oft embezzle all,
Whether the sums in cash, are great or small.
With house, and land, (the vulgar often say,)
Knavish Trustees, can never run away ;
I'll grant the fact, but whatthe Landsproduce,
They very oft convert, to their own use ;
Stealing the rents, and profits of the same,
Thereby possessing a most roguish name.
All public courts, the guilty robbers fear,
And with reluctance, in the same appear ;
The injur'd heirs, there, all their Rights obtain,
And leave the Robbers inremorse, and pain ;
OR GENETHLIACAL ASTRONOMY.
Excuses then, will be of no avail,
-When splen did pacts, their tender ears -assail. ;
The Law declares this truth, which none deny,
There is no WRONG, without a REMEDY.

OR GENETHLIACAL ASTRONOMY. 263
The preceding Directions are computed according to Astrono
mical principles, and those three Arcs to the Angles, which I have
here selected, prove the correctness of the time of Birth ; as they
accurately correspond with those Events of the Native's Life,
which they produced at those periods, when their Effects were in
operation.
At the Age of eighteen Years, and four Months, the Ascendant
was directed to the Body of Saturn ; at that time he suffered
severely from the Effects of a dangerous fall ; he was also much
afflicted with a violent cough, and pleurisy, which continued
several Months before his health was re-established.
The Horoscope Was directed to the Square of Mars in Mundo,
at the Age of twenty-seven Years, and three Months, which was
the cause of a sudden, and alarming sickness ; and as the power of
the Promittor was increased by the rays of the Sun, and Mercury,
the baneful Effects of that Direction produced the greatest danger
in Life, by a violent Fever, with pains in the Head, and Breast,
and difficulty in breathing, &c. ; but after he had remained iu
that afflicted state, during twelve Days, he perfectly recovered, to
the astonishment of his Medical Attendants.
The Ascendant arrived by Direction, at the Opposition of the
Sun, (or the Medium Coeli to the Mundane Square of that Lumina
ry,) at the age of sixty Years, and ten Months ; the Effects of
which, produced great difficulties, and troubles ; he was then
afflicted by an intermitting Fever, with injury to the Eyes, and
also with acute pains in the Breast and Abdomen ; those who
attended him, believed that his recovery was impossible, butthough
this Direction Was armed with direful fury, owing to many exist
ing causes, which must appear plain to every attentive Student, its
Effects could not destroy Life, because the Ascendant is not Hyleg,
and therefore, though it was unable to produce Death, yet, after he
recovered from its malevolent power, he nevor enjoyed a good state
of Health any more, during the remaining Years of his Life*
264 CELESTIAL PHILOSOPHY, '
The Moon is (he Apbeta, or giver of Life, and thetime of Death
must be discovered by her directional Motion to those Promittors,
Which have power to produce dissolution. At the Age of fifty-
eight Years, and eight Months, the Prbrogator was directed to the
Square of Saturn in the Zodiac, but that Direction could not pro
duce any Sickness, or danger to the Native's Health, even though
it was joined with the Sun's Parallel in the World, by Converse
Direction ; for the Trine of Jupiter, and Quartile of Venus hi the
Zodiac, immediately followed, united with the Trine of Venus in
the Zodiac, and Mundo, by Converse Motion ; but when the Moon
was directed to the Opposition of Mars in Mundo, by Converse
Direction, and also to the Square of Saturn in the World, by
Direct Motion, succeeded by the Trine of the Sun in the Zodiac,
and Parallel of Mercury in Mundo, by Converse Direction, (those
two Promittors being of the nature of the Enemies in this Geniture,}
I judged, that be could not survive the Effects of those Directions,
particularly, because the Hyleg was subsequently directed to the
Opposition of Mars in the Zodiac, by Converse Motion, and to the
Parallel of the Sun in Mundo, by Direct Direction, with the
Quartile of Saturn in the Zodiac, by Converse Motion. These
Directions formed the mortal train to the giver of Life, and though
the rays of the Benefics interposed, yet they could not save, being:
weak, and surrounded by the obnoxious Directions, and stations of
the MaleficSi The Native died of an infiamation of the Bowels-,
at the time I had previously predicted, from which it is evident,
that the Effects of the above Directions to the true Hyleg, were
the original cause of his Death.
By Secondary Direction, the Moon was in Opposition to Saturn,
from the Eastern, and Westâ¢rn Angles, both being in Cardinal
Signs, and that Luminary was in Opposition to her own place in the
Nativity. In his last Revolution, the Moon was applying to the
Square of Saturn, and Opposition of Mars, by Converse Direction,
Mars being in the West, in Opposition to the place of Saturn in the
Geniture ; the Moon had returned to her own station at the time
OR GENETHLUCAL ASTRONOMY. 2G5
of Birth, and Saturn was in an Angular position, in Conjunction
with Jupiter. At the time he died, the Moon was in Quartile to
the Sun, and applied to the Square of her own Radical place ;
Saturn was near the station of Mars in the Radix, and the latter
Malefic was applying to the Quartile of Saturn's place at the time
of Birth ; all these Motions, and applications of the Stars, shew
their powerful, and baneful influence, in giving assistance to
those Primary Directions to the Jlyleg, which destroyed the Life
of the Native.
The primitive Principles of this Science, are regularly
taught by the Author ofthis Work, by whom, any Person may
have any Nativity calculated with expedition, on immediate
application.

26<5 CELESTIAL PHILOSOPHY,
John Davison was Born near Hull, on the 21st of July, 1808,
at 6h. 48M. P. M. and was drowned, September 26th, 1825 ;
Aged seventeen Years, two Months, and four Days.
I have observed that those persona, in whose Genitures, the
Stars are unfortunately posited, generally disregard, and treat with
levity, and contempt, all human admonition ; and instead of receiv
ing the warnings displayed by the Celestial Messengers,, with
fortitude, and composure, they impiously condemn them in thâ¢
most insulting, and ignominious terms of disapprobation. It is out
of my power to relate the abuse, levelled against the HeavenlY
Hosts, as Secondary Causes by those, who are unbelievers ; though
the most notorious Infidelsfeel their powerful influence, at those
periods, appointed by the Most High, during the time they inhabit
this Terrestrial Globe.
This Native in company with five others, attended a Marriage,
in the Church of Bardney, near Lincoln ; and in attempting to
cross the River Witham, in a small Boat, one of them, regardless of
danger, shaked the Boat with considerable violence, which occa
sioned Water to flow over the sides ; in this situation, as the Boat
was fast filling, they all went to the stern, by which it instantly
upset, and they were all precipitated into the Water ; two others of
the Names of Dent, and Kennington, (each about twenty years of
age,) were drowned with this Native ; the other three were saved
with the greatest difficulty. The time of this Native's Birth was
given to me by his Parents, who are now living. The following
Figure of the Heavens, and Directions, exemplify the Terminus
Vita, with the quality of Death.

272 CELESTIAL PHILOSOPHY,
There cannot be stronger testimonies of a violent Death, in any
Genitare, than in this under consideration. The learned and im
mortal Ptolemy, has, in his precepts, clearly defined the cause,
and quality of Death in all cases, whether violent, or natural,
and, he plainly informs us how to select the rulers of Death, in
any Nativity, which are chiefly to be regarded ; for, if the Lumi
naries are in the superior Angles, and afflicted by the Malefics in
violent Signs, and Terms without assistance; and at the same time,
ifthe Benejics are found in obnoxious places, and afflicted by
Position, and are also inimically joined in the Directions for dis
solution, then, when such testimonies prevail, a violent Death is
evidently foreboded, which is always pointed out by the Effects of
the Mortal Directions, when they are in operation to the giver of
Life ; the first of which ascertains tho true period of dissolution,
(when benevolent rays do not precede,) and thoie that follow, in
dicate the quality thereof; thus when remarkable, and violent
Deaths happen, we alwaysfind both the Malefics ruling tho Ana-
retic places, and assumingpower, and superior dominion over
the Luminaries, and afflicting them at the same time in the Radix,
as well as in the subsequent train of the Mortal Directions,
which wag the case in this Nativity.
Those who adhere to the infallible precepts, (contained in this
Work,)for defining the Apheta, will find, that in the Geniture of this
unfortunate young Man, the Sun claims the dominion of Proroga
te-, and, at the time of Death, that Luminary was directed to the
Quartile of Saturn, in the World, Converse Motion ; succeeded by
the Hyleg to the Body of Mars, in the Zodiac, Converse Direction;
the giver of Life, also subsequently arrived at the West ; Scmi-
quartile of Mars, in Mundo, by a right Motion ; Rapt Parallel of
Mercury ; and Parallel of Mars, in the World, Converse Direction ;
followed by many other direful Motions to the significator of Life.
Some may probably say, that the two foremost Directions, in the
Mortal train, are only Converse, and have not sufficient power to
OR GENETHLIACAL ASTRONOMY, 273
produce dissolution ; to this I answer, that both thoso Malevolent
Motions, were formed from Angles, and Signs of the Watery
Trigon, and, under those circumstances, they became equal to the
formidable efficacy ofany direct Aspect, and, were qualified with
others, to portend Death by Drowning. The foregoing Motions
of the Celestial Bodies, were preceded by the giver of Life, to the
Zodiacal Parallel of Mercury, who is ofthe nature of Saturn, in
the Radix; and, when this Direction was completed, that Star
was received in the Orbs, and Terms of Mars; but, as the Pro-
mittor was retrograde, and declining to the Occidental Horizon,
it was retarded in shewing its Effects, until the other Motions of
the Stars displayed their ominous, and inimical power to the Sun,
the legal Prorogator of Life.
In computing the Secondary Motion, we find, the Apheta was
Angular, and applying to the Zodiacal Quartile of Saturn ; and,
that Luminary was in Mundane Square to his position, in (he
Geniture. In the Revolutional Figure, the Moon had just separa
ted from the Square of Mars, in the Zodiac, and was exactly in the
same Aspect with Saturn, in the World. At the time he was
Drowned, the Mooa was posited in a Watery Sign, beholding the
greater Malefic, by hostile applications ; she likewise applied to
the Mundane Parallel of Mercury, who was of the nature of the
Malevnlents ; and both the Benofics were extremely afflicted by the
Conjunction of Mars, which correspond with the Directions, and
gave additional violence to the other stations, and configurations of
the Planets in the Geniture.

274 CELESTIAL PHILOSOPHY,
The following is the Nativity, of Charlotte, Daughter ofthe late
Mr. William Booth, Schoolmaster, at Brant Broughton, near
Grantham, Lincolnshire. This Gentleman was an eminent Ma
thematician, and a good Astronomer. The time of Birth, taken,
and given by himself, was April 29th 1780, 7Br. I 2M. P. M. She
died on the 2nd of August, 1818, aged thirty-eight years, three
months, and three days, (according to ray previous Calculation,)
which will appear evident from the following Figure ofthe Heavens,
at the time of Birth, and the Anaretical Directions, which are cor
rectly computed, according to the unerring principles ofAstronomy.

OR GENETHLIACAL ASTRONOMY. 281
This Native was Married to a Gentleman far above her station
in Life, which is plainly visible in the Heavens. An honorable
connexion was formed at the Age of twenty-six Years, and two
Months, under the Effects of the Direction of the Midheaven to
the Trine of the Sun, in the World, he being ruler of the Tenth,
and posited in the Western Angle, which is the Husband's Ascen
dant. At the Age oftwenty-six Years, and eleven Months, the
Horoscope came by Direction to the Sextile of Jupiter, in Mundo,
which may be proved by the use of the Celestial Globe; and as
Jupiter was in a Cardinal Sign, disposed of by Venus, lady of the
Husband's Ascendant, and was also in the Radix, in a Mundane
Sextile to the Medium Caeli, the supreme Angle of Dignity, and
Promotion ; and was likewise in Trine to Venus in the Eighth,
which is the Husband's second, with Mercury lord of the Eighth,
in Sextile to Venus, lady ofthe seventh ; these Radical positions,
united with the efficacy of the primary Directions in operation,
from the Age of twenty-six Years, and two Months, until twenty-
six Years, and eleven Months, were proper to produce a respectable,
and Wealthy Marriage. She was Married to a Gentleman of con
siderable Property, on the sixth of May, 1807, Aged twenty-seven
Years, and six Days.
The Sun, in this Genilure, is the undoubted Apheta, or giver of
Life; and, at the Age of thirty- eight Years, and two Months, that
Luminary came to the Parallel of Mars, in Mundo, by Direct
Direction, followed by the Opposition of Saturn, in the Zodiac,
with Aldebaron, and also to the Parallel of Saturn, in the World,
by a right Motion; these were the Directions which I judged
would produce Dissolution, the truth ofwhich was verified, though
she lived one Month, and three Days, beyond the period pointed
out by the first Direction in the train for Death.
But some will ask, why I have not noticed the Direction of the
Ascendant to the Body of Saturn, it being in operation with those
of the Sun, which I have allowed for Death ? to such inquiries,
2r2
282 CELESTIAL PHILOSOPHY.
T shall only say, tliat the true Hyleg alone, in every Geniture,
must be directed for Death, its time, and quality ; the Direction
of the Horoscope to the Body of Saturn, might augment the fury
of the other Directions to the Prorogator, yet, it was of its own
nature, wholly unqualified to produce Death, or any serious or
alarming Indisposition ; but being united with those that compose
the Anaretie train, it doubtless gave some additional assistance to
the Effects ofthe Mortal Directions to the Hyleg before mentioned,
when they were in operation. The Horoscope Advocates way
believe this if they please, for it is an established fact, that the
most violent, and malignant Directions to the Ascendant, can never
destroy Life, when the Luminaries, &c ; are in the proper Apheti-
cal places, and claim the Prorogatory power; though evil Direc
tions to the Horoscope may, (without others of a violent nature,)
produce Sickness, and Accidents, with various troubles, &c. These
things are manifestly apparentto every Practitioner; but before I
proceed further, I shall make some observations on the Directions
of the Sun to the Body of Mars in the Zodiac, and in the World,
which were followed by the Opposition of Saturn, in Mundo, as I
shall probably be asked why they did not destroy Life,' before the
Age of thirty-eight Years, and two Months. The Sun certainly
passed those Directions without causing the Death of the Native;
and I am convinced, that many pretenders to this Science, would
judge inevitable Dissolution, in similar instances, from such appar
ent violence ; but in this case, those Directions were not Anaretie,
and therefore were not armed with a sufficient portion of inimical
power to destroy Life ; neither were they able to produce any dan
gerous Sickness, or Accidents, so as to put Life in jeopardy; because
when the same Directions were finished, those Malefic Promittors
were received in tho Orbs, Terms,and Directions of the Benevo-
lents, which deprived them ofpart of their own natural, and vio
lent influence, and power. The preceding Directions were
followed by the Sun to the Parallel of Mars, in the Zodiac, the
Effects of which, assisted by the Direction of tho Horoscope to the
OR GENETHLIACAL ASTRONOMY. 283
Opposition of that Malefic, could not prove Mortal, because the
flyleg was succeeded by the Square of Venus, in Mundo, Converse
Direction, and Parallel of that Star in the World, by Converse
Motion ; and Saturn, and Mars, were likewise conjoined with
benign Directions, by the Motion of the Primum Mobile, by
which a largeportion of the evil was dissolved, which must be
constantly, andparticularly attended to, in allsimilar Calcula
tions, and Judgment.
But though the Directions before quoted, had not sufficient
power to destroy Life, owing to the causes above assigned; yet,
when they shewed their Effects, the Native experienced a lingor-
ins Illness, with which she was afflicted for more than a Year
previous to her dissolution; the rays of Venus falling in by Direc
tion at thfrtirae of Death, were unable to save, against the evil train
then in operation that succeeded, though they described the nature
of the affliction, or quality of the Mortal disease, which was a
disorder of the Stomach, and Liver. The use of Medical skill
was of no avail, neither was human assistance able to alleviate her
lingering afflictions ; but Death put a final period to her Earthly
sufferings, at the Age before recorded.
There may probably bo some difficulties arise among practition
ers, concerning the nature, and power of those Directions that are
Anaretic, and those that are not ; for in all cases, the Rules of
the immortal Ptolemy, are substantial; he tells us in plain lan->
guage, that Directions of the Hyleg to the Bodies, and other
destructive rays of Saturn, and Mars, &c ; do not always destroy
Life; he also informs us, that when tho Apheta is at any time
directed to the Malefics, or their furious beams, the evil though
apparently great, is much abated, if the enemies at tho same time,
do notpossess their own natural, and violent power; for if they
are then in the Terms of the benevolent Stars, and are directed to
tho Benofics, either in tho Zodiac, or Mundo, they cannot destroy
Life; though they may be qualified to produce long, and lingering
284 CELESTIAL PHILOSOPHY,
diseases, which may be considered as thefore-runners of Death ;
so that when the practitioners have (as they suppose,) computed a
violent train of Directions to the Prorogator, they then absurdly
judge Death from their Effects, without consulting other sideral
causes of the greatest importance, previous to giving final Judg
ment; for if the Benefic Directions intervene to break the train, or
if the Malefics, &c, as I have before observed be directed at the
same time in peculiar parts ofthe Heavens, to the Bodies, or rays
of Jupiter, or Venus, or their Terms, life will bepreserved, not
withstanding the apparent fury, and violence of the Directions.
The Revolulional Figure for the Native's thirty-eighth Year,
contained the greatest testimonies of violence ; for Saturn was
posited exactly on the Radical place of the Moon, and Jupiter had
nearly returned to the Square of his own place in the Nativity,
where he was afflicted by the hostile beams of Mars, from Cardinal
Signs. Mars was likewise in Quartile to the Radical place of
Jupiter at Birth, and the Moon, in the Revolution, was applying
to the Body of Saturn. Mercury was also near the Conjunction of
Mars in the Geniture, and likewise near the Square of the
Moon in the Revolution. By Secondary Motion, the Moon
wa3 in Square to the Sun, in the World, and the Hyleg was also
afflicted by both the Malefics, having then the Declination
of the Moon. Saturn had also returned to his opposite place at
Birth, and Mercury was likewise applying to the Opposition of
Saturn, and had his Declination also; the Sun had passed the
Opposition of Saturn, and applied to the Body of Mars ; and in the
Progression, that Malefic was posited on the place of the Moon
in the Revolution, who was afflicted by the violent rays of Saturn ;
the Sun having at the same time gained the Declination of Saturn,
was likewise in Square to the Moon in the Nativity. On the
Morning of Death, there was a New Moon in nine Degrees,
thirteen Minutes of Leo, in Square to the place of the Sun at Birth ;
and what is most remarkable, Venus, ("whose primary Directions
OR GENETHLIACAL ASTRONOMY. 285
interposed in the train of Death, but could not save,) was in Con
junction with Mars, and in Opposition of Saturn at the time of
Dissolution; these things duly considered, not only prove the Verity
ofthe Computations, but also the great, and important use of
Revolutions, and Secondary Directions. &o, when properly
attended to at those periods, and in all eases, when Analytical
Directions are in operation to the true Prorogator, or giver of Life.
286 CELESTIAL PHILOSOPHY,
The following Nativity is that of a Female Child, who was
Born on the 20th. of September 1803, at half past eleven o'Clock
at Night; and was Drowned at the Age of six Years, five Months,
and sixteen days. The Figure of the Heavens, with the Mortal
Directions, prove, that the true Hyleg alone, must, (in all cases,) be
directed for Death, its time, and quality. . . .
In this Geniture, both the Luminaries are under the Earth, and
all the other Planets are likewise posited in a Subterranean position,
so that the Horoscope claims the Aphetical power. Now as the
time of Birth was correctly taken by an adjusted Clock, I think
all those who absurdly suppose that the Angles may be directed to
Aspects in the Zodiac, will doubtless be convinced of their Error,
for it is evident that there can be no such Directions, according to
the true Doctrine of the Sphere, which has been before observed. I
have in numerous Examples, proved the absurdity of such whimsi
cal notions ; and ifany advocates are now to be found, who arâ¢
disposed to rely on the Effects of Directions in the Zodiac, to the
Angles, I must inform them from the highest Authority, and thâ¢
most substantial proof, that no such Directions have been in Exist
ence, according to the true Motions of the Heavens, since the
beginning of the World.

290 CELESTIAL PHILOSOPHY,
In every Nativity, all the true Arcs of Directions to the vital
significators, whether of a benevolent nature, or of a Malâ¢fic power,
ought to be computed, which fall within the Orbs, and Terras of
the Erratics, after the arrival of the true Prorogator, at the foremost
in the Mortal train, (as in this case,) according to the Doctrine of
the immortal Ptolemy, which he has clearly demonstrated in his
Original Greek Quadripartite; for if allihe Mortal Directions are
not truly wrought, which precede, as well as those that follow, or
unite in the Anaretic train, the Sltident will not be able to distin
guish those that destroy Life, from others, which shew the nature,
and quality of Death ; for it is not always the first Malefic Direc
tion to the Hyleg which destroys Life, though it is generally the
case ; for it sometimes happens, that when the giver of Life has
arrived at the first Direction in the beginning of those hostile pri
mary Motions, whioh threaten dissolution, Life is preserved by
other benign Rays, Orbs, and Terms, in which the Prorogator,
assuming the powerful Aphetical Dignity, is surrounded in the
Zodiac, and in Mundo. Those benevolent Directions, (whether
Converse, or Direct,) formed from the superior places, and Angles,
&c. will dissolve a considerable portion ofthe evil ; so that no materi
al injury to Life is experienced ; but when the giver of Life arrives
at the neat Malefic Direction in the train, then Death will ensue,
because the power of those preceding Directions, (though of a be
nevolent nature,) is destroyed, and can afford no assistance to the
true Prorogator, and particularly when other vital significators are
afflicted by violent primary Directions, at, or near the same period.
There are many testimonies in this Geniture, which clearly
portend a violent Death. The Sun is conjoined with Saturn, in the
Imum Ceeli, and Venus is united with them in that Angle. The
Moon is in the Watery Sign Scorpio, in Sextile with the Sun,
Saturn, and Venus; and as those rays are formed from Signs of
long Ascension, they are of the nature, and power of a Square in
this case. Mercury is in Conjunction with Mars, in the Nativity,
OR GENETHLIACAL ASTRONOMY. 291
and both are transmitting violent, and obnoxious qualities to Jupiter,
who is also afflicted by the Parallel of Saturn's Declination ; and
the prevailing evil testimonies are considerably increased, in conse
quence of all the Planet's being Angular, the Moon excepted, and
under the Earth at the time of Birth, and in those violent Signs,
and places, which give Death by Drowning; for Ptolemy informs
us, that when the Moon is in moist Signs, and evilly configurated
with the Sun, and Saturn in obnoxious places, (the benevolent
Stars being afflicted at the same time;) then Death will occur by
Suffocation, and Drowning; and thus it happened in the present
instance,
The Directions that destroyed this Native's Life, were the
Ascendant Hyleg, to the Squares of Saturn, and the Sun in Mundo,
according to true, and natural Motion ; and it is evident, that no
other Directions could destroy Life. The Horoscope was separa
ting from the Sesquiquadrate of the Moon, in Mundo, but was not
free from the Effects of that inimical, and previous application at
the time of Birth. Some will say, that the Ascendant is afflicted
by the Squares of Saturn, and Mercury, in the Zodiac, and ought
riot their rays to be esteemed of sufficient power to destroy Life? To
this I answer, the Native lived past the expiration of the fifth Year,
and therefore she died by Directions. In the course of all my
practice, I have never seen any Zodiacal Squares ofthe Malefics to
the Ascendant, destroy Life, when that point of the Heavens was
the TRUE PR.ORO6ATOfl..
But as T do not wish to sanction any project, nor rely on any
Rules, and Precepts, which cannot be proved by Reason, and de
monstrated by Truth; I will now prove to the Reader, (if he is
not wilfully blind,) that when Mars, and Mercury arrive at the
Cusp of the Northern Angle, then is the Ascendant directed to
their true Squares in Mundo; this Motion maybe instantly proved
by the Celestial Globe, to the satisfaction of all those who wish to
inquire after Truth, and adhere to Reason in all their operations ;
for it must be impossible for the Ascendant i.i this case, to bo
2T
292 CELESTIAL PHILOSOPHY,
directed to the Squares of Mar?, and Mercury, by two distinct, and
separate Motions ; indeed if that was the case, we should have very
small Arcs of Directions in one operation, and in the other, very
large ones ; but I do positively say, that the true Arc of Direction,
ofthe Ascendant to the Square ofMars, in Mundo, in this Geniture,
is 29Â° 2' ; and that of Mercury 29Â° 5' ; and if we subtract the
correct distance of Mars from the Northern Anglo, 29Â° 2' from his
duplicate nocturnal horary times 33Â° 32', we shall find, the true
distance of Mars from -the .Cusp of the fifth to be 4Â° 30'; by which
it appears plain, that both Mars and Mercury, were nearly in a
Mundane Trine to the Oriental Horizon, at the time of Birth.
In the Native's last Revolution, Saturn was nearly on the place
of the Moon in the Geniture; and that Luminary was likewise in
Square to her place in the Nativity, and applying to the Quartile
of Saturn, in the Revolution; and as her Declination was then de
creasing, she consequently applied to the Zodiacal Parallels of all
the Planets, in the Radix; the union of such violent testimonies,
whenever they arc found to correspond with the nature of the Pro
gressions, Lunations, and Secondary Motion, &c. ; always in
crease the violent, and dangerous Effects of the hostile primary
Directions, to the Aphetical place. By Secondary Motion, Saturn
was found in the Midheaven, conjoined with Venus, in Mundane
Opposition to his position, in the Radix; he was also on the Solar
place, in the Revolution. At the time of Death, the Sun was
found in Opposition to Venus, and Saturn, at Birth; the latter Star
was in Zodiacal Quartile with Venus at the time ofexpiration, and
on the place of the lessee Malefic, in the Revolution, in Opposition
to his own Mundane station in the Geniture; the Moon- was un
propitiously irradiated by Mercury, and Mars in the Nativity, and
the latter Star was in direct Opposition with Jupiter, in the Geni
ture ; and Jupiter was in an hostilâ¢ Aspect with Mars, and Mercury,
in the Radical Constitution. Such evil, and violent Motions of the
Stars, when agreeing with the Effects of the malignant primary
Directions in operation to the Ilyleg, always increase thâ¢ir fury,
and produce sudden Dissolution*
OR GENETHLIACAL ASTRONOMY. 293
The next Geniture which I shall give to the Public, is that of
Elizabeth Thompson, who was Born near Hull, on the IIth of
November, 1810, 7h. 5M. P M; and departed this Life, on the
3rd of December, 1824, Aged fourteen Years, and twenty-one
Days.
This Native's Father, who is now living, gave me the above time
of Birth, which he informed me, was taken by himself, by a well
regulated Clock, so that the Nativity is not skeptical, but strictly
correct.
The Immortal Ptolemy, that illustrious Master of Genethlia-
cal Astronomy, &c.; informs us in plain terms, without the least
ambiguity, that the most important subject, which oughtJirst to
engage our serious attention, in all Genitures, i3 tiie doct57ine
of the space of life; for it would be vain, and inconsistent to
give Judgment, concerning the time of Prosperity, Adversity,
Sickness, &c.; with other occurrences at distant periods in the
Life of an Individual, when malevolent Directions to the proper
Apheta, are qualified to produce dissolution, in the early part of
Life. In the following Nativity, I believe many pretenders to this
Sublime Study, would absurdly take the Ascendant as the Pro-
rogator, or giver of Life; but according to the Precepts given in
this Work, for selecting the Hyleg, which will always be found
certain, and infallible, it may easily be discovered, that the Part
of Fortune claims the 4phelicalpower, as a full Moon preceded
the Nocturnal Birth, and none ofthe Planets are in the Prorogatory
places, which will appear evident, from the following Figure of the
Heavens; and the Mortal Directions, to that powerful Mundane
configuration, correspond with the period of personal extinction.

OR GENETHLHCAL ASTRONOMY. 297
In the foregoing Nativity, the Lunar Horoscope is in exact
Semiquartile with the Sun, which forcible, and inimical Aspect,
combined with the impotent stations, and configurations of other
vital significators, were evident testimonies of short Life: and that
the Native would experience lingering diseases, during the tran
sitory period of her existence, is clearly foreboded by the cadent
positions, and afflictions of the superior Stars, in the GenitureÂ«
In this original work, I have inserted the correct Computa
tion of the Part of Fortune, with the arrangement of some of its
Directions, which are precisely wrought infull, in page 128, 129,
and 130; and without the least deviation from these precepts, which
must be constantly attended to in every Geniture: the distance of
the Part of Fortune from the Occidental Horizon, in this Nativity,
is 7Â° 44', by which position, that Mundane point, claims the Pro-
rogalory power; and the Directions that destroyed the Life of this
Native, were, the Part of Fortune to the Square of Mars, in the
World, and Mundane Semiquartile of Saturn, without the least
portion of benevolent assistance ; the latter Anaretical Direction
was several degrees distant from the first, which produced Death;
but I wish every Student in this incomparable Science, to notice,
that when similar Nativities are observed, two destructive Directions
to the Apheta, (even when they are far remote,J without sufficient
benign aid, will never fail to cause dissolution.
It is worthy of remark, that both the benevolents were afflicted
by Direction, at the time of Death; Jupiter was directed to the
Opposition of Saturn, and Venus arrived on the place of that Male
fic ; the hostile prevalence of those Stars, at the time of expi
ration, united with the violent nature, andpower of the Anare-
tical Directions, apparently point out the Mortal disease, to be a
Consumption.
In the Native's last Revolution, the Prorogate was in Quartilo
with Saturn, in the World, and the Moon applied to the Docliua-
tions of the Sun, and Saturn, and Zodiacal Semiquartile of the
2U2

greater Malefic. Mars, the chiefMortal Promittor, in the primary
Directions, who was Angular in the Geniture, was then descending
below the Western Horizon, in Opposition to the Horoscope, and
communicated deadly qualities to the Moon ; while Venus occu
pied the place of Saturn, in the Radix. By Secondary Direction,
the Part of Fortune, the significator of Life, was in Square with
Mars, in the Mundane Circle ; and the Moon applied to the obnox
ious rays ofthat Malevolent, in a subterranean position : but in the
Progression, the affliction ofthe Lunar Horoscope, was still more
striking. She departed this Life, when the diurnal Luminary
made Oriental appearance, and consequently the Hyleg was then
conjoined with the Moon; it also approached the Mundane Quartile
of Mars. The proximity of these direful configurations, to the
Moderator, produced the greatest degree ofinauspicious influence.

The subsequent Geniture is that of Sabina Dayles, who was
Born near Boston, Lincolnshire, on the 19th of February, 1816,
23h. 11m. P M; and died at Lincoln, June 2nd 1826, Aged
ten Years, three Months, and twelve Days.
The Sun is certainly the true Hyleg, or giver of Life, and it
would be preposterous to foretel the time of Death from Directions
to any other significator; though 1 am convinced, there are some
who would in this, and similar Nativities, neglect the austral posi
tion of that Luminary, and improperly allow the Horoscope to
claim that momentous Dominion, and attempt to ascertain the
period of the Native's dissolution from inimical Aspects to that
Angle.
It is extraordinary to observe the contradictory, and unintelli
gible information given by various Authors, both Ancient, and
Modern, who have written on the Doctrine of Nativities; but in one
essentialpoint, the vague assertions, and exorbitant Tenacity,
with which the generality ofwriters agree, is still more notoriously
confused, and that essentialpoint, is in selecting the Moderator.
Those who have written on this subject, vainly endeavor to dilu-
cidate, and even alter, and oppose the incontrovertible precepts
ofthat luminous character, the IMMORTAL ptolkmy, by which,
they have absurdly invented the most sophistical, and injudici
ous Examples ; which Examples are adhered to by many to this
time, and are considered preferable to the primitive Method of as
certaining the Prorogator, which the Author above quoted, has
faithfully, and clearly elucidated in his Original Greek Quadri
partite,

OR GENETHLIACAL ASTRONOMY. 303
From the positions, and Directions in the preceding Geniture,
there are several subjects worthy of observation, particularly the
shortness of her Life, and the nature of the disease which termina
ted her existence. At the Age of three Years, and five Months, the
Sun, the Prorogator, or giver of Life, arrived at the Quartilo of the
Moon, in the Zodiac; (succeeded by the Apheta tothe Rapt Paral
lel of Saturn,) at that time she experienced a dangerous Illness,
which remained with considerable Vehemencefor several Weeks,
and no hopes were entertained of her recovery ; but as the Hyleg
was in Mundane Sextile with Venus, and subsequently applied to
the Zodiacal Trine of Jupiter, those malevolent Directions had not
sufficient power to produce dissolution.
At the time of Death, the Aphetical point was directed to the
Parallel of Saturn in Mundo, by a right Motion, followed by the
Body of Mercury in the Zodiac, Semiquartile of Mars inthe World,
Direct Direction, Parallel of Saturn in Mundo, Converse Motion, and
Conjunction of that Malefic, by Converse Direction ; these Mortal
Directions produced personal Expiration at the Age before mention
ed ; and though the Zodiacal SextileofVenus succeeded, that Aspect
was unable to yield any assistance, because it wasmore than seven
Degrees distant from the killing place: and the Promittor was
violently afflicted when this Direction was completed. The Sun
to the Body of Mercury, being the second Direction in the Mortal
train, most wonderfully points out the quality of Death; for not
withstanding the Trine of that Star with Jupiter, he beholds the
Moon by a violent Square, and is also in the Terms of Saturn;
he therefore is of a mischievous nature, andpower : Mercury thus
afflicted in the Geniturn, and also near the obnoxious Aspects of
the Enemies at the time of dissolution, and in Pisces a Sign of the
Watery Trigon, evidently describes the Mortal disease ; which
was occasioned by Water in the Brain.
The Revolulional Figure for the tenth Year, was very inimical,
and violent, for the giver of Life was applying to the Square of
2X
304 CELESTIAL PHILOSOPHY,
Baturn in the Zodiac, and Mars was on the radical place of
Jupiter, and in Zodiacal Quartile with Saturn, in 'the Nativity.
At the time of Death, the Apheta was applying to the Conjunction
of Saturn, in a violent part of the Heavens; and the Moon was
in direct Opposition with Mars. The Progression was also as
dangerous as theother Motions, and stations ofthe Stars; for Saturn,
and Mars were unpropitiously configurated with the Sun, in the
Mundane Circle. By Secondary Motion, the Prorogator was near
the Occidental Horizon, in Square to Mars in the World, and in
Parallel with Mercury in Mundo; and Mars was on the Mundane
place of Saturn in the Geniture: all these obnoxious irradiations,
being combined with the Anaretical primary Directions to the
Hyleg, greatly augmented the sudden, and furious union of their
violent Beams, which not beingcounteracted by benign applications,
always produce in similar cases, certain, and inevitable dissolution,

Elizabeth Gilliatt was Born at Lincoln, October 18th 1798,
J2h. 28m. P M; and departed this Life, August oth ISl'J, Aged
twenty Years, nine Months, and seventeen Days.
This Celestial Science is founded on Reason, and Truth, and
may be proved by all; but those who are disposed to deny its Utili
ty, and Authenticity, soon disgrace their Arguments by their vague,
and contradictory observations. All their wire drawn Texts,
and disreputable Exclamations, when displayed in hostile array
against the primitive principles of this prophetic Science, become
instantly vanguished by the narration of one established Fact. In
attempting to state the Fallacy of this Celestial Study, those who
wantonly abuse the Works of the Creator, ought to produce
public, and substantial Truths to support their assertions, without
which, their bigoted Ideas will ever become disreputable, and con
temptible. Such characters vainly believe, that they possess unioer'
sal Wisdom, and will by no means allow, that any Man can possi
bly excel them in Literature ; but when they are finally defeated,
they then attempt to proclaim a visionary victory by immode
rate passion, and abusive language, &c. How unmanly,
base, and wretched, must the mind of those Men be, who attempt to
traduce a Science, the true principles of which, they ar3 wholly
unable to define, or comprehend. A man may deliver his opinion
on any subject, either in the negative, or affirmative, but that will by
no means establish the validity of his Judgment, except ho is able
(by the aid of Truth, and Reason,) to confirm his remarks, and
support his Animadversions, without fraud, or deception.

310 CELESTIAL PHILOSOPHY,
When this Native was in the most perfect state of Health, I was
requested by her Father, to make some observations on her Geni-
ture; and from the Estimate time of Birth, (as it was recorded in an
Ancient family document,) which is inserted in the preceding
Figure, Iwasperfectly satisfied, that the Moon was Hyleg, and
as the Native had not been exposed to any violent Indisposition, to
put Life in danger, I was confident, that the Directions ofthe Moon
to the Parallel of Mars in Mundo, Direct Motion ; Semiquartile of
Mars in the World, Converse Direction ; Quartile of Mercury in
Mundo, Converse Motion ; Sesquiquadrate ofthat Star in the World
Direct Direction; Parallel of Mars in the Zodiac; Sesquiquadrate
of Saturn in Mundo, and Zodiac ; and Sesquiquadrate of the Sun
in the Zodiac, had not showed their Effects, and as they were not
twelve Months distant at the time I finished the Computations; the
Judgment which I delivered in few words, was, that before the end
of her twenty-first Year, she would leave this World for a better,
however her Father believed in nothing I had said, and passed
several absurd, and unhandsome observations on my Calculations,
and Judgment; but Alas !
Thedestin'd Victim did rrsign her Breath,
By that due Summons from râ¢lrntless Dâ¢ath.
The Mortal disease according to the positions, and Directions
preceding, was a disorder ofthe Lungs, which occasioned a rapid
wasting of the Flesh, accompanied with a slow nervous Fever.
There are some who will probably ask, why the rays of Jupiter
did not save Life, as the Moon to his Square in Mundo, was united
with those Directions, which I allowed for Death ; it is true the
Direction of Jupiter follows, but as he was at that time deprived
ofhis benevolent qualities, he could not render sufficient assistance
to the giver of Life ; his subsequent Directions being void ofrelief,
were of no avail, though they certainly specified the nature, and

Quartile, from the Eastern, and Southern Angles; and in violent con
figuration with the Moon in the Nativity ; the giver of Life was also
in Square to her place in the Genituro. In the Native's last Revo-
lutional Figure, the Hyleg was in Mundane, and Zodiacal Quar
tile with Saturn ; and the Sun was making application to the Body
of Mars; the greater Malefic was likewise on the place of Mars in
the Radix: and in the Progression, the Luminaries were surround
ed by hostile rays, as they approached the superior Angles, and
could receive no assistance from benevolent irradiations. At the
time of Death, the Moon had the Declination ofthe lesser Malefic,
and was applying to the Opposition of the Sun; she was also in
Square with Mars in the Revolution. Mars was in Zodiacal Quar
tile with Mercury, and on his own Mundane position in the Nati
vity. Those who will take the trouble to make observations of
this kind, and reduce them to practice as occasion requires, will
find, that such hostile Motions as I have here investigated, will,
when compared with the nature, and Effects of the superior prima
ry Directions, augment their operations; and particularly when
they are conjoined, and correspond with those Motions, which are
productive of Death ; therefore from what has been recorded, the
young Students will, I have no doubt attend to the foregoing obser
vations, which may soon be understood by all those who are incli
ned to occupy their leisure Hours in these Calculations.

312 CELESTIAL PHILOSOPHY,
The next, and last Nativity, is that of a young Gentleman, who
is now living, and in good Health ; and as this Geniture has been
delivered into the hands ofsome ignorant impostors, who impu
dently affirm, that he is to Marry at the Age of twenty-five Years,
and also obtain considerable Wealth at the Age of thirty-eight: I
have therefore Published this Nativity, that the community may
notice the deceit, and villany practised by illiterate pretenders,
who go about the Country for the purpose of aeceiving the igno
rant. The time of Birth inserted in the Celestial Figure, was
given to me by the Native's Parents, by whom I was requested to
Calculate this Geniture. The Figure of Heaven, with the Direc
tions computed from the Astronomical Tables contained in this
Work, are as follow.

OR GENETHLIACAL ASTRONOMY. 319
In this Nativity, the Horoscope is excluded from the Dominion
of Hyleg, in consequence of the position of Jupiter, who is in an
Aphetical place, and properly qualified for that Office : for he is in
Zodiacal Trine with the Moon, and beholds her by a Parallel of
Declination, and is inMundane, and Zodiacal Sextile with the Sunt
and ruler of the Part of Fortune in the Radical ^Constitution; it
is therefore evident, that Jupiter is the legal significator of Life.
Now I do assert, that when the Prorogator is directed to the Quar-
tile ofthe Moon in the Zodiac, and Parallel of the Sun in Mundot
by the Rapt Motion, the true Arcs of those Directions will be com
pletely finished, and it is from their Effects, followed by many
others of an obnoxious nature, and power, that I predict the disso
lution of this Native : the first Direction above mentioned ascertains
the period of that solemn Event, to take place, at the Age of thirty-
two Years, and four Months, I am an enemy to long Epistles
being wrought on any Geniture, therefore the best way is always to
come at once to the point, and deliver an impartial Judgment on
every Event of importance through Life without the least evasion ;
for when Men produce vague remarks where few words are suffi
cient, it only tends to shew their ignorance, and establish their dis
grace. Those notorious impostors who have pretended to Calcu
late this Nativity, and who have predicted considerable Wealth at
the Age ofthirty-eight Years, may now observe, by my Computa
tions, and Judgment, founded on the genuine principles of astro
nomy, that long before that period arrives, the Native will "pass
that Bourn from whence no Travellers return".
At the Age of twelve Years, and seven Months, the Hyleg was
directed to the Square of the Moon in the World, by o right Mo
tion, the Effect of which, was productive of a severe Indisposition ;
and although several other inimical Directions were subsequently
in operation to the Prorogator ; ihe application of the Aphetical
point to the Rays of Venus, saved the Life of the Native at that
period.
2Z
320 CELESTIAL PHILOSOPHY,
At the time the Mortalprimary Directions to the Hyleg will
shew their Effects, the benevolent Planet Venus, cannot render
any relief to the giver of Life. The Directions of Jupiter to the
Rapt Parallel of Venus ; and to the Trine of Venus in Mundo, and
in the Zodiac, Converse Motion, will be ofno avail, in consequence
of the presence of the Enemies, with which Venus will be unfa
vorably conjoined by the Rapt Motion of the Earth.
If we carefully examine the nature of the second Direction in
the Mortal train, and properly regard the affliction of the lesser
Hcnefie, with the Rays of Saturn in the Radix, and likewise in di
rectional Motion; we may easily foresee, that the Native's Death
will be occasioned by a violent Fever, preceded, and attended with
a rapid Consumption.
I believe it would not be interesting to the Reader, if 1 was to
discuss all those testimonies which forebode advancement according
to tho Native's station in Life; but as his demise is not many Years
distant, it would bo of no importance to make observations on
those subjects; though I shall here notice, that the Direction of the
Midhcaven to the Sextile of Jupiter in the NVorld, will most cer
tainly produce Marriage, and Prosperity, fyc. at tho Age of
twenty eight Years, and a half. Was this Native destined for a
longer Life, I should make copious remarks on the various sideral
coniigutations and Directions, &c; but as that is not the case, I
shall decline delivering any other occurrences on his few remaining
Years; because when the spirit of the dead has abandoned its life
less Clay which imprisoned it, all Terrestrial Wealth, and Hap
piness, vanish like a shadow, and are no more.
I have now concluded the thirty remarkable Nativities which 1
promised to give to the Public ; and have endeavored to make every
subject as easy as possible: the Computations of all the Ares
of Directions are made by true, and natural Motion, which may
be proved by tho use of the Celestial Globe, or Spherical Trigono
metry. I shall now proceed with the subsequent part of the Celes
tial Philosophy, according to tho announcement previously given to
the Public.
OR GENETHLIACAL ASTRONOMY. 321
THE EFFECTS OF DIRECTIONS.
The Sun, Moon, Ascendant, or Midheaven, directed to the Con
junction, Square, or Opposition of Saturn, indicates loss of Reputa
tion, Office, and Estate: severe Illnesses, and Accidents of various
denominations, according to the Signs, and positions of the significa-
tor, and promittor; which must be properly attended to in every
Nativity.
The Sun, Moon, Ascendant, or Midheaven, directed to the Sex-
tile, or Trine of Saturn, shews advantage by the means of elderly
persons, or a legacy is bequeathed; and the Native is successful in
every undertaking. This is to be understood when those Aspects
are not augmented, or diminished, by Signs of long, or short Ascen
sion.
The Sun, Moon, Ascendant, or Midheaven, directed to the Con
junction, Sextile or Trine of Jupiter, forebodes respectability, ad
vancement, Honor, and Wealth : the Native is fortunate in all af
fairs, and Marriage is frequently Solemnized.
The Sun, Moon, Ascendant, or Midheaven, directed to the
Square, or Opposition of Jupiter, portends troubles, and vexations,
quarrels, and contentions; and loss of Estate by the means of eccle
siastical characters.
The Sun, Moon, Ascendant, or Midheaven, directed to the Con
junction, Square, or Opposition of Mars, are malevolent Directions,
and denote manifold disputations, and commotions ; scandal, dis
grace, and loss ofsubstance : Illnesses of various denominations, and
sometimes Accidents.
The Sun, Moon, Ascendant, or Midheaven, directed to tho Sex-
tile, or Trine of Mars, gives Honor, and Preferment by Chemistry,
or martial employment. In a Feminine Geniturc, Marriage fre
quently occurs.
2Z2
CELESTIAL PHILOSOPHY,
The Moon, or Ascendant, directed to the Conjunction, Square,
or Opposition of the Sun, denotes Indisposition, and injury to the
Eyes; many perplexities, and losses : the Native is suddenly de
prived of Dignity, and Office, and credit, or Reputation is material
ly injured. The Midheaven to the Body of the Sun is a propiti
ous Direction, and gives any Native Honor, and Promotion, accord
ing to the sphere of Life, which must be impartially investigated in
all cases.
The Moon, Ascendant, or Midheaven, directed to the Sextile, or
Trine of the Sun, will be productive of happiness, Honor, Wealth,
popularity, and renown, and sometimes Marriage.
The Moon, Ascendant, or Midheaven, directed to the Square, or
Opposition of Venus, are unpropitious Directions; and forebode trou
bles, and controversies ; the Native also obtains disrespect from Fe
males. The Direction of the Sun to the Square of Venus, is indica
tive of vexations, and difficulties, by various ways, and means.
The Sun, Moon, Ascendant, or Midheaven, directed to the Con
junction, Sextile, or Trine of Venus, foreshews Honor, and Promo
tion; the Native is very fortunate in every engagement; and the
Matrimonial Union is frequently Solemnized, under the operation
of any of these Directions.
The Moon, Ascendant, or Midheaven, directed to the Square, or
Opposition of Mercury, denotes many accusations, contentions,
troubles, disappointments, and losses, as well as Indisposition ; the
Native's undertakings are unsuccessful on all occasions. The Sun
directed to the Square of Mercury, indicates vexations, and difficul
ties, in every Geniture.
The Sun, Moon, Ascendant, or Midheaven, directed to the Body,
Sextile, or Trine of Mercury, gives an inclination to the Study of
Arls, and Sciences; the Native is admired foringenuity, andlearning,
and is successful in most underta57ings; tligse Directions also indicate
OR GENETHLfACAL ASTRONOMY. 323
Travelling; but when Mercury is afflicted in tho Geniture, the Con
junction ofthat Planet to any of the above places, is productive of
perplexities, and losses on all occasions.
The Sun, or Ascendant, directed to tho Conjunction, Square, or
Opposition ofthe Moon, are very inimical Directions, causing many
troubles, difficulties, and losses ; any of these Directions put the Life
of the Native in considerable jeopardy, either by Indisposition, or
Accident. The Midheaven to the Body of the Moon frequently
produces Travelling, Marriage, and Prosperity.
The Sun, Ascendant, or Midheaven, directed to the Sextile, or
Trine of the Moon, denotes Travelling, comfort, and happiness,
with an augmentation of Honor, and Wealth: the Matrimonial
Union is generally Solemnized, under the Effects ofany of these
Directions.
The Part of Fortune directed to any benevolent Aspect, produces
an augmentation of Honor, and Riches ; but to malevolent Rays,
troubles, and a considerable diminution of Wealth.
The Sun, Moon, Ascendant, Midheaven, ov Part of Fortune di
rected to the Quintile, or Biquintile of any Planet, denotes the Na
tive to prosper in every undertaking; the Semiquartile, or Sesquiqua-
drate, is of a malevolent nature, and power.
The Luminaries directed to their own Sextilos, or to any Paral
lel of the Benefics, either in the Zodiac, or in the World, will con
sequently be productive ofgood Effects in the affairs oi any Native :
but the Directions of the Lights to their own Semiquartiles, or
Squares, or to any Parallel of the Malevolents, denote troubles, and
obstacles, and impair Health.
I have briefly explained the Effects of all Directions, which when
compared with the remarks on the Nativities given in this Work,
in Examples of Life, and Death, the Student may readily compre
hend every portion of their influence in all parts of the Heavens,
and in all cases whatsoever.
324 CELESTIAL PHILOSOPHY,
I have allowed malevolent Directions formed to the Sun, Moon,
Ascendant, Midheaven, or Part of Fortune, to be productive of trou
bles, and losses, &c : in addition to which, I shall notice in this
place, that the Hyleg directed to a violent train of unpropitious As
pects, (without sufficient aid from the benefics,) will, in every Nati
vity, produce inevitable dissolution, either natural, or violent; ac
cording to the positions, and configurations of the Celestial Bodies,
at the time of Birth, combined with the prevalence of the Anareti-
cal places, and Directions, which has been previously observed.
From what I have here mentioned, every Student in this Science,
.will consequently predict the time of all Momentous Events, from
the nature, and power of each Direction.
THE ESTABLISHED METHOD OF SELECTING THE TRUE HYLEG,
IN ANY GEN1TURE.
In order to make the Aphetical places easy to be understood, I
shall observe, that they commence with five degrees past the Cusp
of the Second House, in the Ascendant, and extend as far as five
degrees above the Horizon : the Eleventh House, and centre of
that House, the whole of the Tenth, Ninth, and five degrees be
yond the latter House, are also Aphetical places; and five de
grees past the Cusp of the Eighth, in the Seventh, as far as five de
grees past the Occidental Horizon, below the Earth, are likewise
Prorogatory places. And among these again arepreferred, asstrong
er, and more powerful, first they which are in the Zenith, then
they in the East, next to those, they in the succeedant to the Mid-
heaven, then the West, and lastly, they which precede the Mid-
heaven : for whatsoever House of the twelve above the Earth, hath
no configuration with the Horoscope is not proper to be taken; and
that in a subterranean place, is unqualified for such a Dominion,
except what come in to light with the Ascendant,
The Apheta3, or significators of Life, are'five ; and those are the
Sun, Moon, Ascendant, Part of Fortune, and that Planet who hath
most Dignities in the place of the Sun, Moon, Horoscope, and
Part of Fortune, in the Figure of Birth; and in the place of the
OR GENETHLIACAL ASTRONOMY. 325
Conjunction, or Opposition of the Luminaries, preceding the Geni-
Wo, in which this regularity must be observed.
In a diurnal Nativity, the Sun shall be preferred if he is in an
Aphetical place ; but if he be not, let the Moon ; ifshe be not, that
Planet shall be accepted that hath most titles of Dominion in the
place of the Sun, the preceding Conjunction, and the Horoscope ;
(and in a Prorogatory place also,) that is, when he hath Dominion
three ways or more, in one of the mentioned places, for all the ways
of Dominion are five ; but if there be none such, the Horoscope
shall be taken as the true significator of Life.
By night, the Moon shall be preferred ifshe be in an Aphetical
places but if she be not, the Sun shall, if he be : if neither of the
Luminaries should be so qualified, then take that Planet who hath
most Dignities in the place ofthe Moon, the preceding full Moon,
and the Part of Fortune, and in an Aphetical place: ifthere be none
such, the Horoscope shall be taken if a Conjunction preceded, but
if it was a full Moon, the Part of Fortune shall be allowed that
Dominion, when found in an Aphetical place.
326 CELESTIAL PHILOSOPHY,
OX THE REVOLUTIONS OF KINGDOMS AND STATES, &C.
When any grand Mutations have come to pass, that are visible
tQthe World, and in which the unbelievers are more or less involved,
they then say, 'God does all these things,' which I by no means
deny ; but I ask, how does he perform, and bring to pass such
events, which are considered so miraculous to the wisdom of
Mortal Men? for it is certain, that all things on Earth, are depen
dant on the Heavens, and occult power of the Celestial Bodies,
which are secondary causes to execute the divine will, and
ETERNAL DECREE OF THE GREAT CREATOR, which I have proved
to the most licentious Infidel,
All those who at present deny the existence of Stellar power, and
.who impiously slander the Works ofthe Almighty, will, (should
they survive a few revolving Years,) be perfectly convinced oftheir
Error; for in the Years 1 820, and 1821, were observed in the Hea
vens many appearances ofan extraordinary, andformidable na
ture, which cannot happen again for many Centuries to come,
The Mundane power of such appearances will become manifest for
a long period of time, and will be visible in many parts of the
World.
But as the celestial bodies are the representatives of king
doMs and states, I must request the ingenious practitioner to pay
the strictest attention to those wonderful Celestial Congresses, which
were visible on the 17th 18th and 19th of April 1821; on those
days, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, the Sun, Venus, and Mercury,
were all conjoined in the sign auies. Now reader pause, and
consider these things in solitude, and do not hastily, and wantonly
condemn, what I am certain you can never understand ; for I do
positively say, that this great meeting in the Heavens, does most
assuredlyforebode a succession ofManY Memorable events of
the grâ¢atest magnitude in foreign realMs. I dare not pre
sume to offer my impartial Judgment on all the direful effects
of those Celestial Congresses : what the influence ofsuch remarkable
OR GENETHLIACAL ASTRONOMY. 327
Meetings ofthe Heavenly Bodies, hereafter will be, must bo left for
Time to determine. If the young Students are inclined to receive
some information on this subject, {hey may read the names ofthose
Kingdoms, Cities, andCountries, which are governed by thefour
Cardinalpoints, including those seated under Gemini, and Virgd,
with Me opposite Signs; and then they may instantly make
their Judgment final, and see every subsequent occurrence before
them, though yet in the womb oftime. The Mundane influence of
these Celestial appearances, will estond theirirresistible power with
unbounded fury to remote realms for many Years : 'Horrid
waRS, 'dissent-ions, tuMults, violence, imprisonMents,
Assassinations, sudden deaths, with incurable pestilential
Fevers, and disorders ofthe Lungs, will be experienced in For
eign nations, with the Death of Men in high Authority, and
power; dreadful Thunder, and Lightnings, will be prevalent in
many places, with awful conflagrations, and likewise high
Winds, Tides, and violent Hurricanes, with many Shipwrecks,
and unfortunate Navigations : great alterations in the Wgath
er for a long period of time; the Waters in the Rivers will'be
diminished at intervals, and Springs dried tip, so that Cattle in
severalplaces will receive great injuryfor want of Water ; in
consequence of which, will follow incurable diseases among
them in several Places: these droughts oflong continuance,
will at certain periods be succeeded, as well as preceded, bY
uncoMMon wet weather, which will cause great innun-
dations ; Frost, Snow, and intense cold will abound in their
Seasons, which willfrequentlyprove injurious to the Seeds, and
Fruits of the Earth ; excessive heat, succeeded by very sudden
transitions ofimmoderate cold, willvery often be severelyfelt in
severalplaces, during many subsequent Years : but as I have no
authority to state where these direful calaMities will fall,
T must with reluctance remain silent ; however I hope, and trust,
that from what I have here stated, every industrious Student, will
be enabled to form a correct Judgment on the long continued Ef
fects of those dreadful Celestial appearances, which were so re
markably posited at the periods beforementioned.
3A
328 CELESTIAL PHILOSOPHY,
It frequently occurs, that the Congresses of several of the Planets
in some predominating Signs, and places, do not immediately shew
their ominous Effects, but many Years elapses before they become
manifestly apparent. In the Month of March 1789, the Sun,
Saturn, Mars, Venus, and Mercury, were all conjoined in the Sign
Pisces, and in the same Year, the Revolution in France broke out,
which circumstance, and many subsequent hostilities in that King
dom, were evidently foreboded from the Effects of the above Con
junction of five Planets in the Constellation of the Watery Tripli-
city : and whenever similar appearances of the Heavenly Bodies are
observed, (the Sun being properly united,) they always produce
commotions, and Revolutions, or a change of state in those places,
governed by the Signs, and their opposites, which has been before
observed : but Peace and Plenty, may certainly be predicted when
those Congresses of the Planets have completed their formidable
efficacy, or become disjoined by the rapidity of the inferior Stars.
Imightexpatiate upon these subjects, but I believe sufficient has been
mentioned by which any attentive Student in this Science, may
precisely comprehend the manifold, and subsequent Effects of
every extraordinary meeting ofthe Celestial Bodies.

CORRECT PRECEPTS FOR COMPUTING THE ECLIPSES OF THE SUN,
AND MOON,
TO CALCULATE AN ECLIPSE OF THE MOON.
1 . Find by Astronomical Tables, the true Time of the Ecliptic
opposition, or full Moon, when an Eclipse is expected to happen :
and let that Time be reduced to apparent Time, by increasing, or
diminishing the same, by the equation of Time, as occasion requires.
To which Time, viz. the true Ecliptic opposition of the Sun, and
Moon; find the Moon's true Latitude, and her Hourly Motion in
Latitude. Also, the Moon's Hourly Motion in Longitude, in order
to find the Hourly Motion ofthe Moon from tho Sun in Longitude.
Find the Moon's Horizontal Parallax, and her Semidiameter; the
Sun's Hourly Motion, and Semidiameter being found before. The
Sun's Horizontal Parallax may always be taken at 9".
2. Find the Angle of Inclination of the Axis ofthe Moon's way,
with the (-Northern) Axis of the Ecliptic; which is to the right
hand, if the Moon has North Latitude ascending, or South Latitiude
descending ; otherwise, if the Moon has North Latitude descending,
or South Latitude ascending, the Angle lies to the left hand of the
Axis of the Ecliptic.
RULE.
To the co-arith. of log. Sine of the Moon's Hourly Motion from
the Sun, add the log. Sine of the Moon's Hourly Motion in Lati
tude, the sum is the Tangent of the Angle required.
3. To find the nearest approach of the Centres of the Moon,
and Earth's Shadow.
RULE.
To the co. sine of the Angle ofthe Moon's Inclination, add the
log. sine of the Moon's true Latitude, (at the Ecliptic opposition,)
and the sum will be the log. sine of the nearest approach of the
Centres of the Moon, and Earth's Shadow.
3A2
330 CELESTIAL PHILOSOPHY,
4. Then from the sum ofthe Horizontal Parallaxes ofthe Sun,
and Moon, subtract the Semidiameter of the Sun, the remainder is
the apparent Semidiameter of the Earth's Shadow, which must be
increased by 50", on account of the Earth's Atmosphere.
To the Semidiameterof the Earth's Shadow, thus found and in
creased, add the Semidiameter of the Moon ; and if that sum is
more than the nearest approach oftheir Centres, the Moon will be
Eclipsed at that Time ; but if otherwise, she will not be Eclipsed.
5. The Moon being found Echpsed ; then from the sum of the
Semidiameters ofthe Moon, and Earth's Shadow, subtract the near
est approach of their Centra, and the remainder is the partdeficient.
Hole. If the parts deficient are less than the Moon's apparent di
ameter, it shews the Eclipse will not be total ; but if they be
equal, then the Eclipse will be total without continuance;
but if the parts deficient be more than the Moon's apparent
diameter, then the Eclipse will be total with continuance.

deficient : Digits Eclipsed, or
To the co-arith of logistical log. of the Moon's Semidiameter,
add the logistical log. of parts deficient; the sum will be the logis

6. With the argument of Latitude (longitude > in Orbitâcor
rect longitude SI) found attlle Time ofthe truâ¢ Ecliptic opposition,
take out the Moon's reduction from her proper Orbit tÂ» thâ¢ Ecliptic,
which equation is to be doubled, and turned into Time, by the
Moon's Hourly Motion from the Sun ; and you will have the Time
between the true Syzygy and the mean Eclipse, or greatest Obscu
ration ; which is to be added to, or subtracted from the Time of the
true Ecliptic Opposition, according as the Moon is yet short of, or

duration.
From the square ofthe sum of the Semidiameters-, of the Moon,
and Eurth's Shadow, in seconds, deduct the square of the nearest
approach of their Centres in seconds'; the square root of what re
mains, will be the Motion of Semiduration, in seconds of a Degree.
Tofind the time thereof, say,
As the Hourly Motion of the Moon from the Sun : is to 1 Hour,
or 60 Minutes in Time : : so is the Motion of Semiduration : to
the Time of Soinidiiration ; which being subtracted from, and add
ed to the Time of the greatest Obscuration, will give the Time of
the Beginning, ahd'End of the Moon's Eclipse.

TO COMPUTE ECLIPSES OF THE SDN.
PRECEPTS.
1. By Astronomical Tables find the time of the true Ecliptic
Conjunction, or new Moon, when an Eclipse is expected to happen.
From the Horizontal Parallax of the Moon, subtract the Horizon
tal Parallax ofthe Sun, the remainder will be the Semidiameter of
the Earth's Disk. Likewise, to the Semidiameter of the Sun, add
the Semidiameter of the Moon, the sum of which, will be the Se
midiameter of the Moon's Penumbra.
2. To the Semidiameter ofthe Earth's Disk, add the Semidi
ameter of the Moon's Penumbra, and if the sum exceeds the near
est approach oftheir Centres, (found like the nearest approach of
the Centres of the Moon and Earth's Shadow, in an Eclipse of the
Moon,) the Sun will be Eclipsed in some part of the Earth : but
otherwise no Eclipse of the Sun can happen.
3. The Sun being found Eclipsed in some part ofthe Earth, the
Beginning, Middle, and End of the general and also central
Eclipse, (with respect to the whole Earth,) may be found in like
manner as is before directed, for finding the Beginning, Middle,
and End of an Eclipse of the Moon.
To Calculate an Eclipse of the Sunfor any particularplace
given, by Parallaxes.
1. Having found by Astronomical Tables, the true Ecliptic
Conjunction of the Sun and Moon, together with their places in the
Ecliptic ; compute the Moon's true Latitude, with all the other
requisites, adapted to the particular place given.
Find also, the Moon's Horizontal Parallax, her apparent Semidi
ameter, and Hourly Motion in Longitude and Latitude, as also the
Sun's apparent Semidiameter, and Hourly Motion.
2. To the apparent Time of the true Conjunction of the Sun
and Moon, compute the Parallax of the Moon from the Sun, in
Longitude.
3B
336 CELESTIAL PHILOSOPHY,
3. To half an Hour, an Hour or more, (as the said Parallax is
small or great,) before or after the true Conjunction, according as
the Moon is in the Eastern, or Western Quadrant of the Ecliptic,
compute again the Parallax ofthe Moon from the Sun in Longitude;
by which means, (from the true,) you will have the visible half,
Hourly, &c. Motion of the Moon from the Sun.
Note. To Compute the Parallaxes ofthe Moon in Longitude,
and Latitude, in Solar Eclipses.
For the Moon's Parallax in Longitude.
The Equatorial Horixontal Parallax of the Moon, is first to be
reduced from the Sphere to the Spheroid for the Latitude of the
place.
To the Sine ofthe Horizontal Parallax, add the Sine of the Alti
tude of the Nonagesimal degree of the Ecliptic, and the Sine of the
distance of the Sun, (or Moon's visible distance,J from the Nona
gesimal degree, and their sum will be the Sine ofthe Moon's Par
allax in Longitude,
Note. The Moon's Parallax in Longitude is to be added, or
subtracted to the Moon's true place, as the Sun is to the East, or
West of the Nonagesimal degree
For the Moon's Parallax in Latitude.
To the Sine ofthe Moon's Horizontal Parallax, add the Co-sine
of the Altitude of the Nonagesimal degree of the Ecliptic, and the
sum will be the Sine of the Moon's Parallax in Latitude.
Note. The Moon's Parallax in Latitude always depress her
Southward, in Northern Latitudes without the Tropicks; that is
diminish her true North Latitude, and increase her true South
Latitude.
Now gay' As the visible Motion of ) a Â© : is to the Time
taken : : to is the Parallax of the Moon frqm the Sun in Longitude
O2 GENETHLIACAL ASTRONOMY. 337
at the Time of the true Conjunction : to the Interval of the true
and visible Conjunction, which added to, or subtracted from, the
Time of the true Conjunction, according as the Moon is to the East,
or West of the Nonagesimal degree, will give the Time ofthe visi
ble Conjunction of the Sun and Moon.
4. To which time, compute again the true places of the Sun
and Moon, with the Parallax of the ) a 0 in Longitude and Lati
tude, and so find the apparent or visible place of the Moon, in re
spect of the Sun ; and also the Moon's visible Latitude.
5. To ten or fifteen Minutes (more or less,) before or after the
visible Conjunction, as the Moon's visible Latitude is found to bo
increasing, or decreasing, compute the visible Longitude of the >
a 0 ; with her visible Latitude. Now say, As the Sine of the
visible Motion of > a 0 in Longitude, in the Time taken : is to
Radius : : so is the Tangent of the difference of visible Latitudes
(between the visible Conjunction and Time taken) : to the Tangent
of the Angle of the visible way of the Moon with the Ecliptic at
the Time ofthe visible Conjunction. And, as Radius : is to the
Sine of the visible Latitude of the Moon at the visible Conjunction
: : so is the Sine ofthe Angle of the visible way of the Moon with
the Ecliptic at that Time : to the Sine ofthe Motion seen from the
visible Conjunction, to the greatest Obscuration.
And, : : so is the Co-sine ofthat Angle : to the Sine of the visible
distance of the Centres of the Sun and Moon at the Time of the
greatest Obscuration, that is, their nearest visible distance.
Note. Ifthis distance be less than the Semidiameter ofthe Moon's
Penumbra, the Sun will be Eclipsed at that place; but otherwise
not.
Note. If the Moon's place be more than the place of the Nona-
gesimal degree, according to the order of the Signs, then she is East
of the Nonagesimal degree, and the Parallax in Longitude adds.
3B2
338 CELESTIAL PHILOSOPHY,
But ifit is the contrary, she is to the West ofthe Nonagesimal
degree, and the Parallax in Longitude subtracts.
6. The Sun being found Eclipsed ; from the Semidiameter of
the Penumbra, subtract the nearest visible distance of the Centres
of the Sun and Moon, the remainder will be the part deficient;
from which the Digits Eclipsed may be found.
7. Now say, As the visible Motion of the Moon from the Sun in
the Time before taken, (before or after the visible Conjunction,) :
is to that Time : : so is the Motion seen from the visible Conjunc
tion, to the greatest Obscuration : to the Interval in Time, which
being added to, or subtracted from the Time of the visible Conjunc
tion (as the visible Latitude is decreasing or increasing) gives the
Time of the greatest Obscuration, or the middle ofthe Eclipse.
8. To the Semidiameter of the Penumbra, add and subtract the
nearest visible distance of the Centres of the Sun and Moon,
To the Logistical log. of that sum, add the Logistical log. of
their difference ; divide that sum by two, and you will have the
Logistical log. of the visible Motion of Semiduration in Minutes
and seconds of a degree.
9. Now say, As the Sine of the visible Motion ofthe Moon from
the Sun in Longitude for an Hour, or more, before the visible Con
junction, : is to Radius : : so is the Tangent of the difference of
visible Latitude in that Time : to the Tangent of the Angle of the
visible way of the Moon with the Ecliptic, from the Beginning of
the Eclipse to the visible Conjunction.
And, as Radius : is to the Sine of the visible Motion of Semi-
duration : : so is the Co-sine of that Angle : to the Sine of the
* visible Motion in Longitude from the Beginning of the Eclipse to
the greatest Obscuration, or middle of the Eclipse.
10. Likewise, As the visible Motion of the Moon from the Sun,
in Longitude in the Hour, (or more,) before the visible Conjunction
OR GENETHLIACAL ASTRONOMY. 339
: is to 1 hour, (or more,) : : so is the Motion in Longitude seen
from the Beginning of the Eclipse to the greatest Obscuration : to
the Time of Incidence ; which subtract from the Time of the
greatest Obscuration, gives the Time of the Beginning of the
Eclipse.
By the like proportions, (from the visible Longitude of the Moon
from the Sun in consequence with her visible Latitude for an Hour,
or more, after the visible Conjunction,) you may find the Time of
Emergence, and so the End ofthe Eclipse.

OR GENETHLTACAL ASTRONOMY. 469
The true Method of Computing the Direction of the Sun to the Zodiacal
Sextile of Venus, by Oblique Ascension, in the first Nativity in this Work.
Pole of the Sun 48Â° 9'. The Sextile of Venus falls in 0Â° 18' tit. In
the Tables of Oblique Ascension under 48Â°, and even with 0Â° of 8,1
find 14Â° 52', and opposite 1Â° of that Sign, the number is 15Â° 24', the
difference is 32'. I now say, if 60' give 32', what w 11 18' require? Answer
10', which must be added to 14Â° 52', and the Oblique Ascension of the
Opposition of the said Aspect, under the Pole of 48Â° is, 15Â° 2'. I now
equate for the 9' which exceed 48Â°. Opposite 0Â° of 8 in the Tables of
Oblique Ascension, under 48Â°, the number is 14Â° 52', and even with the
same degrees of that Sign, under 49Â°, I find, 14Â° 23', by subtraction there
remains 29' : then if60' give 29', what will 9' produce? Answer 4', which
1 deduct from 15Â° 2' above computed, and the remainder is the Oblique
Ascension of the Opposite place of the Sextile of Venus, (under the Pole of
the Sun,) 14Â° .58', from which I subtract the Oblique Ascension of the
Sun's Opposition, and the remainder is the Arc of Direction 1 1Â° 8'.
The ingenious practitioner may, in any Geniture, compute all the Direc
tions to the Sun in the Zodiac, from the Tables of Oblique Ascension
contained in this Work, with ease, and accuracy, by proceeding with the
operations in a similar manner to the single Precept I have here given ; (which
is quite sufficient for exemplification,) whereby every Arc of Direction may
be discovered with readiness in all cases, and which will amply compensate
all those who are Students in this incomparable Science.

ERRATA.
In the Author's address to the Reader, several inispointings are omitted.
Pago 4, line 3, read with 0Â° of Gemini, instead of will 0Â° of Gemini.
â 13, line 30, read difference instead of difierence.
ââ 14, line 21, read Declination instead of Latitude.
ââ 15, the last line but two, read separated instead ofseperated.
55, line 14, read inflammations instead ofinfiamations.
66, 67, and 68, the Head-lines incorrect.
ââ69, line 3, read Accoucheur instead of Accouchcr.
From Page 101 to Page 108, the Head-lines incorrect
Page 113. The Direction of the Sun to the Opposition of Mars in the
Zodiac, Converse Motion, should be 17yrs. 9mo. and not 17yrs 613o.
In the same Page, the Midheaven to the Square of Mercury in Mundo,
should be 20d. 36m. and not 2Cd. 26m.
Page 144, line 10, read Tomahawk instead of Tommahauk.
160. The Sun to the Parallel of Jupiter in Mundo, Direct Motion,
should be 9ybs. 6mo. and not 8yrs. 6mo.; and the Sun to the Semiquar-
tile of Mars in the Zodiac, should be 9yrs. 13mo. and not 6yrs. 9mo.
Page 166, line 21 , read Directions of Mars, and not Directions to Mars.
In the Figure of Birth, Page 213, the Â© is omitted. It falls near the Cusp
of the fifth House.
Page 246. The Midheaven to the Opposition of Mars in Mundo, should
be I8yrs. Hmo. and mot 4Syrs. Uho.
Page 266. The Moon to the Parallel ofSaturn in Mundo, Converse Direc
tion, should be29o. 55m. and not 25d. 55m.
In the Figure of Birth, Page 306, there should be 21Â° 8' Â© on the Cusp
ofthe twelfth House, and not 2Â° 8' of that Sign.
