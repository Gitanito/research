The Four  Agreements,    by Don Miguel Ruiz, Amber-Allen  Publishing, San Rafael, CA (1997).

This is one of the most  spiritually powerful books packed into 138 easy to read and understand pages.&nbsp;   As my friend William Fitzhugh points out, A summary is possible, but  you really need to read the whole thing to do it justice.&nbsp; And, I might  add, it's definitely worth taking the time to read.&nbsp; I have read a whole  lot of &quot;great&quot; books in the past 25 some odd years that deal with  expanding human potential.&nbsp; I have to say that this one is the clearest,  cleanest and simplest I have ever read.

The Four Agreements can be  summed up as follows:

(1) Be Impeccable With Your  Word.&nbsp; The broad scope of this concept is to avoid sin against yourself by  what you think.&nbsp; Sinning against the self takes many forms: such as,  putting yourself down, gossiping, or putting anybody else down because you don't  agree with what they think.&nbsp; Actions and words need to be consistent as  part of being impeccable with yourself.&nbsp;  The  other side of the coin is the smoky mirror concept.&nbsp;   Ruiz makes the point that our perceptions of others are merely  reflections of ourselves.&nbsp;  Therefore,  to put another down or project negative words or energy towards another person,  is to lash out at the other person because of our own insecurities.&nbsp;

(2) Don't Take Anything  Personally.&nbsp; There is an awful lot of negative energy out there and some of  it is directed at us by other people.&nbsp; If you take it personally and take  on the poison of another's words, it becomes a very negative agreement you have  with yourself.&nbsp; What anybody thinks about you, or says about you, is really  about them.&nbsp; Not taking it personally allows you to be in relationship with  anyone and not get trapped in their stuff.&nbsp; This agreement can also pertain  to things that we take personally that cause us to go into upset.

(3) Don't Make Assumptions.&nbsp;  What we think we understand about what someone says, how someone looks at us,  what someone means by what they do, etc, may often not reflect reality at all,  and more often than not lead us to think badly of ourselves or of others, and  reinforce not being impeccable with our word.&nbsp;

(4) Always Do Your Best.&nbsp;  Your &quot;best&quot; is a variable thing from moment to moment.&nbsp;  &quot;When you do your best, you don't give the Judge the opportunity to find  you guilty or to blame you.'&nbsp;  You  can always say,&nbsp;'I did my best.&quot;&nbsp; There are no regrets.&nbsp;(p.80)&nbsp;  The other key to doing your best revolves about being in action.&nbsp;  &quot;Action is about living fully.&nbsp; Inaction is the way that we deny life.&nbsp;  Inaction is sitting in front of the television every day for years because you  are afraid to be alive and to take the risk of expressing what you are.&nbsp;  Expressing what you are is taking action.&nbsp; You can have many great ideas in  your head, but what makes the difference is the action.&nbsp; Without action  upon an idea, there will be no manifestation, no results, and no reward.&quot;  (p.82)

I could really relate to the mirror  analogy and the concept that perception is the way that people see light (truth  &amp; spirit) through their own smoky mirror.&nbsp;

The first agreement was  probably the most powerful for me.&nbsp; I never conceived of how much power  (energy) that words have.&nbsp; The story of the little girl who stopped singing  was especially touching.&nbsp; I recall many in the legal field and the power  their words had on the lives of children.&nbsp; With one pompous, statement out  of wrongful use of power, I saw so many children further abused by Judges.&nbsp;Judges  who&nbsp;were so cloaked&nbsp;in either laziness or narcissistic power and&nbsp;promoting  a corrupted buddy system, they can't see the truth or protect the innocents who  have no representation.&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, they knew there is rarely any  retribution because few people can afford an appeal.&nbsp; I reflected on how  many unkind words had drastically changed my life.&nbsp; I also reflected on how  one, &quot;I love you mommy&quot;, and a hug from your baby girls can make even  the worst year worth living.&nbsp;&nbsp;

&quot;Being impeccable with  your word is the correct use of energy; it means to use your energy in the  direction of&nbsp;love and truth for yourself.&quot; (pg 32)&nbsp; I would also  add &quot;for yourself . . . and others.&quot;&nbsp; This is a powerful concept  about using free will to make correct choices that lead one closer to God.&nbsp;  This is one of the main premises in NDERF's talk at the IANDS conference when  talking about soulmates and relationships.

The second agreement is very  close to the Buddhism concept of non-attachment.&nbsp; Don't take anything  personally.&nbsp; (I'm still struggling with this concept, so any Buddhists  who can comment on my perceptions regarding non-attachment would be most  helpful)&nbsp;  I like the concept that  there can be no fear if you don't take anything someone says as personal.&nbsp;&nbsp;

However, I like to take love  personally.&nbsp; From my perspective, In order to live, you have to feel.&nbsp;  Without feeling emotions, you wouldn't be able to feel or understand love.&nbsp;  I think perhaps Ruiz needed to emphasize that he was talking of the negative  emotions.&nbsp;&nbsp;While this is good advice for most people, the more you  understand, the more you can refine the concept.&nbsp; I think that adversity  and negative emotions can bring about some of the most powerful reformations and  social change.&nbsp; Many times, change happens because the emotions provide the  motivation behind the movement.&nbsp; It is not necessarily a bad thing to be  angry or use that energy in a constructive manner.&nbsp; I think that many times  the science of non-attachment or not taking things personally has a leads to  passivism.&nbsp; Passivism or beliefs resulting in passivism, in my opinion, can  be another form of evil because people tend to ignore problems in society and  their own lives - rather than try to change them.

Don't make assumptions.&nbsp;  This is where the book starts to get a bit contradictory.&nbsp; I find the  concept of not making assumptions at odds with the concept on page 58, where he  talks about paying attention to&nbsp;someone's actions that don't match their  words.&nbsp;&nbsp;While I agree it is healthy not to take someone's lies  personally, I also think that there are some people you can't clarify lies with.&nbsp;  They may not even realize they live in a world based on lies.&nbsp; Many times,  I think our preconceived notions (assumptions) may be a behavioral shorthand  that keeps us safe.&nbsp; I missed the distinction between a gut feeling and an  assumption.&nbsp; Both can turn out to be wrong -&nbsp;but initially, I don't  think you should ignore them.&nbsp; It would seem more of a distinction to say  that a misunderstanding is one of those shades of gray.&nbsp; If the reality is  wrong, then the core assumption&nbsp;needs to be changed.&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally,  a good easy rule to remember and follow&nbsp;is&nbsp;to not make assumptions.&nbsp;  However, sometimes, it is&nbsp;not only necessary, but it is a key&nbsp;process  by which we&nbsp;can quickly gauge our outside world.&nbsp;

Do your best at everything.&nbsp;  I espouse the 4th agreement in just about everything I do, and whole-heartedly  endorse this concept.&nbsp; This was a wonderful chapter until the last  paragraph.&nbsp; It is silly for a person to not be concerned about the future.&nbsp;  It's called goal-planning.&nbsp; While living in the present is truly living, I  would think that one would look towards the future to achieve specific ideals.&nbsp;  For example, one may wish to invest in stocks for&nbsp;financial security in old  age.

The last part of the book is  inspirational and thought provoking.&nbsp;&nbsp;Particularly intriguing is&nbsp;the  inference on pg 113 that a healthy mind is outside normal limits.&nbsp; I also  liked when Ruiz talks of forgiveness, which is not defined in the traditional  religious sense.&nbsp; Rather it is used more like&nbsp;remaining impeccable&nbsp;in  your words.&nbsp; His description of forgiveness is one that I am finding the  most empowering when working with blocked emotions.&nbsp; It is to allow the  emotions to flow and ebb, without obstruction, and without judgment.&nbsp; If  something needs to change, then do your best to change it.&nbsp; Don't take it  personally, and don't assume that you personally are the cause of the negative  actions.&nbsp; Again, The Four Agreements is a wonderful book with great  concepts!&nbsp; (I think I'll forgive myself and eat another bowl of ice cream  to feel alive and celebrate such a book! :)
