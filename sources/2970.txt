-LETTER OF DAVID BERNARD,
(A urns-r rmmua)
01| THE SECOND COMING OF CHRIST.
JAN. Qd, A. D., 1843.
Van! Dun Fmnnn.--It is with feelin s of
deep and overwhelming interest, that I address
you on the subject ofCn1us1"s srcoun ransom-
az. Anvsxr mom Hanan. You, doubtless,
profess to believe this important truth of Di-
vine Revelation. It is there recorded in plain
and explicit terms. But, with the great mass
of men,
pon mai
have, until now, felt,
"
my
Lord de ayeth is coming." With them, you
may have
supposed
that God has given us no
intimation in is word of the time when this
event will happen. You may have been kept
in ignorance ofthe truth, by a
wrong apprehen-
sion of Christ's words-" of that day and hour
knoweth no man"-and thefalse opinion that
"Prophecies are not to be' understood until
after their accomplishment." If the words of
Christ refer to the end of time, (which some
LETTER or S
doubt,) may they not accord with the event be-
ing made known to the People of God previous
to the appearing of our Lord ? Or is that day
to come upon them unawares ? There is a
pre-
diction in Daniel xii. 4-9, which many
believe refers to this event : the words (per-
haps the import of them) were to
"
be shut up"
(kept secret) and sealed,
"
until the time ofthe
end." Hence, at the time ofthe Savior's in-
carnation the time ofthe event was not known-
for the "time of the end" had not then come.
But if the time of the end has now come, or in
other words, if we are on the eve ofthe time
when the Lord is to appear-though the
"
wicked will do wickedly and none of the
wicked shall understand," may it not be
possi-
ble, as Daniel says, that the "
wise shal un-
derstand P" (Dan. xii. 10.) And does not
the Apostle say,
"
but ye, brethren, are not in
darkness, that that day should overtake you as
athief ?" Is it not possible, that there is a
mistake concerning the time not being known?
The wisest of uninspired men have erred on
other subjects. May it not be possible that
they have been in error on this subject also P
And is it not strange, that those very persons,
however wise, who contend that "
we can know
nothing about the time" and that "
prophecies
are not to he understood until after their ac-
complishment," are
perpetually, in their pray-
ers, and sermons, and missionary publications,
interpreting the prophecies ! They predict, or
say that the prophecies predict, a time of uni-
versal peace and pros erity in the church and
in the world. How dh they know this, if the
4 DAVID BERNARD,
prophecies are not to be understood iuntil after
their fulfilment ? They say, moreover, that this
universal peace end prosperity will cohtinue for
om thousand years, and that then there will be
a declension by the influence of Satan, who
will be
"
loosed out of his prison and go out to
deceive the nations, (sec Rev. xx.,) and
that then will the end come. Now, do not
those who entertain these views not only inter-
pret the prophecies, but also declare that the
time will be known ? Ifthis is to be the on
der of events, it will not be difficult, I think,
to know the time. But is it certain that the
Bible teaches this doctrine ? Most ofthe an-
cient Fathers 'did not believe it. Martin Ln~
ther did not. He believed that the end would
come be/are 1846. Dr. Gill did not helieve it-
nor did Cotton Mather. They thought that the
end of all things was at hand ! The scriptures,
which, it is believed, inculcate the doctrine ofa
temporal millennium,I have carefully examined,
and there is no evidence at all satisfactory to
my mind, that they will admit of such an inter-
pretation. lt is true that the heathen are to be
given to Christ for an inheritance, but the same
scripture informs us that he will break them to
pieces with a rod (sceptre) of iron-will dash
them in pieces like a
pntter's vessel, (Pe. ii : 8,
9.) It is also true that the Gospel was to have
been preached in all thc world for a testimony
to all nations before the end should come,"
(Matt. xxii. 14.) But has not this been done
already P VVns it not
"
preached every where"
to
"
every creature under heaven P" So says
the Bible. That scripture had its literal ae-
,
urrsn or 6
collplishment betbre the destruction of Jerusa-
lem. And as it has a second accomplishment,
(if that were necessary.) since that event; for
it has been preached in the four quarters of
the globe, for a witness to all nations, of the
mercy and grace of God.
The angel who was seen flying in the midst
of heaven, having the
everlasting! gpspel to
preach to them who dwell on the eart , to
"
eve-
ry nation and tribe and tongue and people"T-
cried "
fear God and give glory to him, for the
hour o/'his is come." Is there not rea-
son to believe that this angel is now fiiltilling
his commission P If so, the judgment is near !
The Bible says,
"
the kingdoms of this world
are become the kingdoms of our Lord and his
Christ, and he will reign forever and ever."
But this is after the sounding of the seventh
trumpet, (which is the last,) at which time "
the
nations are
enraged, and the wrath of God is
come, and the time ofthe dead that they should
be judged, and that God should reward his ser-
vants, the
prophets, and the saints, and those
who fear him, both small and great, and should
_destroy those who destroy the.earth."-(Rev.
xi. 15--18.)
There are other scriptures frequently addu-
ced, like Is. ch. 25, to prove a
temporal millenni-
um. But it seems to me the lan uage is too
strong, and the blessings predictedwo full and
perfsct for a temporal reign of Christ : for, while
:the-prophet says, that God will make "
unto all
=people a feast of fat things, and will
destroy
the
wail that is cast over all nations"-he dec ares
_that he will swnnow or vans in vxc'roar--
6 num B!R.1ABD.
will wipe away the tearsfrom all faces, and will
take away the rebuke ofhia pwplefrom all the
earth." And at thfs time the sun will be con-
founded and the moon ashamed when the Lord
dwelleth in .Mount Zion bqbre his /mcisnrs glo-
riously," (See Is. uh. xxiv.) Will not such
language apply with more
propriety to a celes-
tial than to a
temporal reign ofthe Messiah ?
'
There are
many who still cherish the idea
that the Jews are to be restored to their nation-
al land; and others, that they will be converted.
But I cannot entertninyfor a moment, the faith,
that God will restore Judaism, which he has
long since abolishedfnor that the Jews, as a
nation, are to be converted. "
All Israel will be
saved."
"
The Delivercr will turn away nn-
godliness from Jacob." "But Israel has not ob-
tained that which they have sought-but the
election has obtained it,and the rest are blinded."
"'
He is a Jew who is one inwardly and circum-
'cision is of the heart." "
If we are Christ's,
then we are Abi-aham"'s seed, and heirs accord-
flng to the promise."
'
The limits of this letter will not permit a
and thorough investigation of the whole subject.
But I wish to say enough to induce you to ex-
'amine it for yourselfi If God has given us any
intimutions concerning the time ofthe world's
(destruction, it is very important that we should
understand them. He informed Noah, 120
years before the flood, when he would destroy
the world. Our Lord informed his disciplel
ofthe approaching destruction which awaited
'Jerusalem-#of the signs which should precede
'it, and that the event should not extend beyond
nr1-an or
'
7
that generation. And it is not contrary -to rea-
son, nor the character ot'God's general govern-
ment, nor revelation itself; for him to inibrm us
when he will destroy the world by a deluge of
ire. The only question is, has he done it ?
Let us examine the subject candidly, carefully,
and pfrayezful/y, and then judge.
~
'
Please to read carefully the entire book of
-Daniel. You will learn that the "
great image"
of Nebuchadnezzar's vision, as
interpreted by
Daniel, represents the four great monarchies
which succeeded each other-which exercised
.universal empire, and are the Babylonian--the
"
Medo-Persian"-the Grecian and the Roman:
That the vision of Daniel in the 7th ch., repre-
sents the same as that of Nebuchadnezzar: And
that the one inthe 8th oh., is nearly analogous
to the other-with the exception, that in the
feast,
the Babylonian kingdom is not represent-
-e . .
»
I wish you to observe, that the '
great image,'
representing the four great monarchies, was
dashed all to pieces by a stone, cut out without
hands, which stone, (the kingdom ofGod,)
'°
fill-
ed the whole earth."
And that the.
"
little horn" (Dan. viii 8-1 l,)
was succeeded by the coming ofthe "
Ancient
or uns"-the slaying, destruction and burning
-ofthe Beast.
_
Andalso, that that same horn (vii. 21, '22,)
»
" made war with the saints and prevailed against
fthem until the Ancient of days came, and
judg-
nnent was given to the saints of the Most I-Iig ;
lllld the time cams, that the saints possessedtho
=kingdom;"
8 num annum. V
Howdrikinglydoessll thissccordwiththe
account
pivenby Paul, These. eh. 2, of the
"
msn o sin" and his estruction by the come
ing
of Christ!
-
n esob and eve instance, where the Roman
power is spoken ol? it is represented as being
destroyed by the coming _of the Lord !
The "
Man of Sin"--the
"
Papal power,"
then, is to continue until the "end ofthe world."
How little does this accord with the doctrine
of s
"
Temporal Millennium ! .
It seems that Daniel had s strong desire te
know something which had not been told him,
concerning the vision. What was this ? Every
thing had been explained, except the time when
the 2300 days commenced. It vas on this
point, then, he desired inibrmstion. To inv-
atruct him, Gabriel was commissioned :
"
Unf
dsrstmd the matter," said he,
"
and consider
the vision." What matter? What vision? Cer-
tainly, the one which had already been the sub-
ject of bisthonghts and desires. What follows,
(Daniel ix. 24--27,) is not s vision, but an ex-
planation ofthe one already seen. In making all
this plain, Gabriel gives him additional informs-
tion, by which, also, the certainty ofthe vision
and its and can be demonstrated.
"
Seventy weeks are determined, (cut om it
should be rendered, for theHebrew will not oe-
ly justify it, but requires it-so say some ofour
best Hebrew scholar-s,) on
thy people," &.o.--
The seventy weeks are 490 days. F' Days," in
Dsniel's prophecies, ssys Newton,
"
are put for
=7esrs." These 490 years,then, are cd qfiiol
the 2300 years. And as these 490 yeartane s
Larrza or 9
part ofthe 2300, being cut oft ti-om them, and
-commenced at the time ofthe Decree of Artax-
erxes, King of Persia, to restore Jerusalem,
(see Ezra,) which was 745 years before the
birth of Christ-the 2300 years commenced at
that time, (4-57 B. C. or 490 years before the
death of Christ,) which will bring us down to
1843. V
-
In the year 1843, then, the "
Sanctum will
be cleansed." But what sanctuary is this, that is
to be cleansed in |843 ? A sanctuary is a
plac¢
of worship. Under the Jewish dispensation,
the Tabernacle, the Temple, and Jerusalem it-
self, were places ofworship. Under the Chris-
tian dispensation, the place of worship is not
restricted to any particular place-the world
itself is the sanctuary of the Lord. And this
is evident from Ex. xv. 17. Hence the earth is
to be purified.
"
The elements will melt with
fervent heat,
"
and "
we," according to his prom-
ise "'
look for a new heaven and a new earth,
wherein dwelleth righteousness." (Sec 2 Pe-
er, ch. iv.)
The other numbers in Daniel seem to corres-
pond with the above. The "
time, times and
dividing oftime," in Dan. vii. 25, and the "
time,
times and a half," in Dan. xii. 7, doubtless re-
fer to the same period spoken of in Rev. ll;
Q, 3. This is 1260 years-the reign of`Anti-
christ. In other words, the time Q/ the Papal
wqrremacy commenced in 538, and ended in
_l798, when the sceptre ofthe Pope was broken
-he being taken captive and imprisoned bythe
French.
-
The '1290 days in Dan. xii. ll. may cow
I0 nntn naman.
mence in 508, when Pa n Rome ended, by the
conversion of the 10 gagan Kings, and the
commencement ofthe first Papal war.
The Pagan Rites were then abolished, and
the "
abomination that maketh desolate," or
the Papal power, began with a strong hand to
persecute the saints. The 1290 days end in
1793. "
Blessed is he that waiteth and cometh
tothe 1335 days," (Dan. xii. 12. This period
very naturally commences in 508, as no other
time is given--and ends in 1843.
At this time, at the _end of the days, 1843,
Daniel is to
"
stand in his lot," Dan. xii. 13.
Now if we are not to expect a Temporal Milf
lennium before the comin of Christ, and the
four great kingdoms with their descendants
are to be dashed to pieces and pass away, so
that there will be found no
place for them-and
the stone, which is the kingdom of God, is to
till the whole earth, and to stand forever-and
the termination of this vision is to be in 1843,
is there not reason to expect ,immediately the
coming of the Lord ? The time of the
cleansing
ofthe Sanctuary-the time when Daniel wil
stahd in his lot, seem to be the same, and all
those aremade blessed, who wait for, and attain
it. What can all this mean but the end ofthe
world-the resurrection of the dead- -the com-
in of the Lord ?
%3ut the "
wicked will do wickedly, and none
ofthe wicked shall understand-but the wise
shall understand." "
Behold the Bridegroom
cometh! go yo out to meet Him E"
And now,
mg'
dear friend, are ou and I ready
fbi' this event . We have heard of it ti-om the
Lrrrla or ll
pulpit--we
have read of it in the Bible, and
aps with some interest. But has not the
aiding always been--" it isfar distant T'
Qw-
hg to this sentiment, has not the impression
been slight and transient as the morning cloud P
But new if the "
coming of the Lord draweth
nigh"--if in a few days-a few weeks at the
longest--the end of all things will come, what
an
impression ought auch tmth to produce on
the mind! God is to leave the mercy seat-
Jesus to close the intercession-the Holy Spir-
it to be withdrawn-the Gospel proclaimed no
more--prevailing prayer no more to be offer-
ed-the da of mercy and time of salvation
to end, andythe eternal destinies of all men both
saint and sinner, fixed, and made known to all
assembled universe !
O ! my dear friend, this subject deeply affects
my heart. Though a professor of
religion, I
cannot contemplate the probability of this event
being so very near, without the deepest anxiety
on m own account ! I have a hope in the mer-
cy ol!God, in Christ Jesus. And this is all
my hope of being able to stand in that day.
"
I
am not mad." But I think of this subject every
moment-I cannot banish it from my mind-it
is written as with a pen
qg
iron on
my soul. I
have come solemnly to t e determination, by
the grace of God, to be ready, and to do all I
canto induce others to prepare to meet the ap-
proaching God ! ! If the time should pass, and
the sequel prove I am mistaken, I shall not be
sorry for the trial nor _/or the eparation. For
whether the last trumpet shallps-ound this year
or the next-time with me and with all men
I! invm nnzunn.
will soon close! But should my expectations
be realized-should the Lord indeed come, no'
language will be able to' express my joy ! !
And now, my dear ii-iend, will you not give
heed to this waming ? The timeis short, to
make up your mind and prepare for such events
as the Buamuc or 'ran woaw-=the JUDGMENT
or ALL Mas-and the nz'rluBU'rioN or :run-
xrrv ! ! ! Davin Banu/mn.
_
P. S. If we have made no mistake in our
exposition of the Prophecies of Daniel, the
Lord, will come in 1843. Should there be a
mistake-which is possible--still I believe,
from the other pro hecies, that the end q/' all
things is at hand. fsaanr. Loox ron Him 'ru.r.
