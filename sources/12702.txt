Everyone in the cemetery is a relative of mine. The graves date back to 1869. I saw a number of my dead relatives standing around me; however, none of them could see me. In this experience, there were no tombstones in the cemetery. Some of the people that I saw there died before I was born, yet I am able to describe their mannerisms. I walked through the crowd of dead relatives, and noticed that they were looking in one direction, as if they were waiting for a car to arrive. I realized that they could not see me even when I walked right beside some of them. I decided to leave the scene because I felt that I was not the person that they were looking for. When I woke up, I was being run down the hall of a hospital on a stretcher.
