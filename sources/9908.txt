  		              		Experience Description   

    I left my classes, at that time I was studying at the university, and my job was in the evening; when I got off the bus, I had to walk a few blocks to my house and that's when a city bus ran over me.  

  During my NDE, I was walking behind an old man with a hood who was carrying a lantern in his hand; we entered a dark tunnel, where hands came out from the sides of the tunnel, moaning and trying to touch me; the floor was slimy. Upon leaving the tunnel, the old man disappeared, and I was floating in a white light, similar to a cloudy day and in the background, there were the mountains of China, wrapped a little in mist (in my room I had a painting with Chinese mountains), but very far from me. My feeling was one of total anguish because I was completely alone and there was nowhere to go, I didn't understand what was happening.  

  When I regained consciousness after the accident, I had no memory of what had happened and I got out of bed, I was alone, and I fell to the floor; I felt like my femur was sliding onto itself and was not holding me, then my mother told me that my leg was broken because they had run over me. Later, I began to feel dizzy while lying down, and they prescribed me medications and the dizziness stopped; apparently it happened every time I would think of the accident, which I could never remember until today; I think I blocked it.  

  I didn't know anyone who claimed to know me, not even my 2-year-old daughter. I was never treated for those memory issues, nor did I mention them; over time I learned to know those people and I was identifying with this life. I only wanted to return to God after the accident, a profound longing led me to learn about Hare Krishna, gnosis, the Catholic charismatics, shamanism, the cyclopean method of internal activation of the pineal gland, yoga, among others. I wanted to be a yoga instructor and I didn't see the meaning of what I was studying at the university, but I didn't dare and I continued with the life I had before the accident, to this day; I never made a turn.

Were your senses More vivid than usual?         No  

Please compare your vision during the experience to your everyday vision that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.       The vision was the same, but sometimes from the corner of my eye I saw shadows, I was sure they were coming for me, to take me to the other side. Especially right after the accident.  

Please compare your hearing during the experience to your everyday hearing that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.      No changes

  Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was both consistent and not consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience.     I always believed that we were truly guided as we passed into the other world, and I saw the old man with the hood guiding me. I had a painting of Chinese mountains in front of my bed and they appeared during my NDE; I floated in distressing nothingness and now I think that the nothingness was a representation of the loneliness and disconnection that I have felt all my life, that is a constant.  
  
Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         Yes     Since the NDE, I think there is a part of me which I cannot access directly, to which I owe my life, and I try to figure out what it thinks about what I do or I ask it to share its opinion.

What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         Slight changes in my life     Now I cannot live without meditations, spiritual exercises or reflections of the spirit; they are part of who I am now. Before, this dimension did not exist for me.  

Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          No   

After the NDE:       

Was the experience difficult to express in words?        Yes   It is such an unlikely experience that words cannot evoke what you want to convey.  

How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.e experience  This experience was so real, more real than everyday life, so that long after the NDE, I believed that I was dead and that what I was experiencing was not real.  

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         Yes     A little clairaudience  

Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          The emptiness is very significant, and I still can't reconcile with it, it still scares me a lot.  

Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    I shared my experience months after the accident and people would fall silent and change the subject; it was very lonely, until today. My niece and daughter were influenced by my spiritual vision of the world and now they carry out activities related to the spiritual  

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       No     

What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real     I did not understand what I was doing with the family to which I returned, I was sure that I had died, and that another soul lived in me, another being. I was totally confused and no one could help me because they did not understand.  

What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real     I believe that I am not linked to experiences at the level of “consciousness”, which may or may not be in a body, in this or another dimension, and that is what happened to me during the NDE; my consciousness moved without my body and when I returned, I had no explanation.  

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       Yes   When I see car accidents, I panic, and I have to stop to drive away.
