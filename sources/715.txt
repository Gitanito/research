Hºw to set a Clock or Watch by this Table:—For Erample, Jan.
|the 1st, I find, by looking into the Table, that a Clock to be right
| must be 3 Min, 35 Seconds faster than a Sun Dial; therefore I set it
somuch faster accordingly. And so of the rest. Twelve o’Clock is
the best Time to set a Clock or a Watch by a Dial. ,
Note—A Sun Dial shows Solar or Apparent Time ; buta clock,&c.
|should be set to Equal or mean time, as the Table directs, to go true

ECLIPSES OF THE SUN AND MOON,
And other Appearances in the Heavens,
- IN THE YEAR 1816: -----
Calculated from New and Improved Solar and Lunar Tables,
Founded on the NewtoNIAN System of Gravitation;
And agreeing withObservations to a surprising Exactness.
-
* *
IN this Year there happen Two Eclipses of the SUN,
and Two of the Moon ; one of the Sun, and the Two
Eclipses of the Moon, will be visible in our Hemisphere.
They occur in the following Order, according to my Cale
culations:—
The FIRST is a Solar Defect, upon Monday the 27th of
May, about our Three o'clock in the Morning, conse
quently invisible, not to us only, but even to all Europe.
But in the unknown Southern Parts of the World, it
will be a very great Eclipse : for in 58 deg. 52 min.
of South Latitude, and 138 deg. 26 min. of East Lon
itude from London, viz. in the Great South Sea, the Sun
will be centrally eclipsed in the Meridian, that is, at Noon
day; it will not be total, but annular; a bright Circle will
appear quite round the Sun, beautiful to behold. This
Place falls near Captain Cook's Track in his Voyage round
the World in 1775, to the Westward of the Island of New
Zealand. This Eclipse will be visible (more or less) at
New Zealand and New Holland, and along the Coast of
New South Wales; and therefore visible at Botany Bay
and Port Jackson.
The Second is a Total Eclipse of the Moon, on Trinity
Sunday, the 9th of June; and if the Air prove favourable,
may be seen by us in this Kingdom, and not by us only,
but also by the Inhabitants of all the States and King
doms in Europe and Africa, together with the Western
Parts of Asia, and the East Parts of America. But in
Siam, China, Chinese Tartary, &c. in the Eastern Parts of
Asia, the fore-part only will be visible; the Moon setting
with them before the Eclipse be over. It will be all
visible in South America; but the Moon will rise eclipsed
in

North America, as appears by considering her Position in
respect to those Parts of the Earth, during the Time of
the Eclipse; for at its beginning, the Moon will be vertical,
or right over-head at Midnight, under 23 deg.8 min. of
South Lat. and 6 deg. 22 min. East from London : At the
Time of the Middle she is vertical, under 23 deg. 19 min.
South Lat. and 18 deg. 49 min. West from London. At
the End of the Eclipse she will be vertical, under 23 deg.
28 min. South, in Long, 44 deg. 15 min. West from Lon.
don. All this falls in the Great South Atlantic Ocean,--
With us in Great Britain, it may be expected nearly to
corrrespond with the following Type and Caleulation.—

than at London ; and at Grantham and Lincoln, about
2 min. sooner. - * * * *

The THIRD is a notable Eclipse of the SUN, upon
Tuesday the 19th of November, in the Morning; visible in
these Parts of the Globe.
It will be first seen to begin upon the vertical Point of
the Sun's Periphery at his Rising, in the Great Atlantic
Ocean, in 47 deg. 55 min. of North Lat. and 10 deg.
51 min West from London, which place is about 4 deg. to
the West of the Island of Ushant, near the French Coast.
The central Eclipse begins in 66 deg. 18 min. North
Latitude, and Longitude 0 deg. 15 min. East from Lon
don, near the Arctic Circle, and, directing its course.

; , ,
towards the South-east, it passeth over some Parts of
Norway, the Coast of Sweden, near the Categat; then
crosses the Baltic, and the Island of Bornholm, and
enters Pomerania; it then passes over some Parts of
Poland, Hungary, European Turkey, and, entering the
Black Sea, the Sun is there centrally and totally eclipsed
at Noon-day, in Latitude 43 deg. 24 min. North, in Lon
gitude 29 deg. 42 min. East from London, which Place is
about 150 geographical Miles NN. E. of Constantinople.
Leaving the Black Sea, it enters Asiatic Tartary, crossing
that country into Persia; bending its course more Nor
therly, it passes over the Northern Parts of Hindoostan,
into the great Empire of China, where the central Shade
quits the Earth with the setting Sun; which Place falls in
thegreat Desert of Cobi, in Latitude35 deg. 55 min. North,
and in 83 deg. 10 min. East from London. Through all
which Tract the Spectators will be involved in a kind
of gloomy Darkness, even like that at Midnight, but not
of long continuance, for the Moon's apparent Diameter
only exceeds the Sun's Diameter by about 46" at its
greatest altitude, and in the Horizon but about 27
seconds; however, the Eclipse will be total all along the
central Track, and for some distance on each Side of it.
The whole Penumbra leaves this terraqueous Globe in Lat.
13 deg.20 min. North, and 73 deg. 26 min. of East Long.
from London, namely, in the Arabian Sea, not far from
the Malabar Coast in the East Indies, where the Eclipse

they often rob, when travelling over this part of the De

in order to visit Mahomet's Tomb l—ft appears that this
Eclipse will be visible in Africa, the Island of Madagascar,
all the lesser Isles of the Eastern or Hindian Sea, in Suma

* 1: That beautiful Star, the Planet Jupiter, comes
to an Opposition of the Sun this year, on the 25th of
April; hence, for that Month, and some time to come, is
a proper time, when the Evenings are clear, for viewing
his Moons, and their Eclipses, and their Configurations
amongst themselves.
2. The Planet SATURN will also come to an Opposition
of the Sun, about the 13th of August; when it will be a
proper time, should the Sky be clear, to view his wonder
ful Ring. But this requires a good and powerful Tele
scope. When these Planets are in an Opposition to the
Sun, they are then nearer the Earth than at other times.

• To the Courteous READER.
My Friends and Countrymen.
Fºsome years past, my mind has been much affected
by the great Events that have turned up in various
Parts of Europe; for, ever since that great and wonderful
Revolution, which took place in France about the Year
1789, great Troubles and Distresses have ensued, by the ,
cruel Ravages of War, the Flames of which, like a Whirl
, wind, have passed through and rent many States and
Kingdoms, even to their very Foundations ; Thrones
have been overturned, and Sceptres broken; and it is
out of the reach of Human Wisdom to ascertain, what
yet may be the Consequences of these great and wonder
ful Changes, and the extent thereof. God's Judgments
are still abroad in the Earth; I wish the People and their
Rulers, in all Countries, would take warning thereby.
Britain has hitherto been preserved by the Goodness and
Mercy of God; and I hope that Preservation of Divine
}.will still be continued to my native Land and
Country. The Hand of God seems to be in all these

Changes and Events, in order to bring abouta Reforma
tion in all Nations, and also of the corrupt Part of the
Christian World, and to operate as the Discipline and
Trial of all the rest. Notwithstanding our Peace, new,
and great Events have and are still turning up, which are,
pregnant with Apprehension and Alarm t
* The late splendid CoMET, in an Astrological Sense, was
a Forerunner of great Events in the World, and signified
the DownfalofsomeTyrannicalGovernments,togetherwith
the Superstition and Pride of Rome; for, according to the
Scriptures, Popery must go down, and Religious and Civil
Hiberty take its place. But all this will be a work of time.
It is begun. NApoleos BuonapaRTE had a Comet in the ,
10th House of his Nativity, which demoted, with other,
Configurations of the Planets, that this Man, so born,
would act his Part upon the Stage of the World with such
Success, that it would not be very easy to overturn and
stop his Progress as a General and Commander—However,
this Man, a few Months ago, was forced, on condition, to ,
abdicate the Throne of France; but since then he has re- a
turned, in order to finish and conclude that Course which
Providence has laid out for him. There is something in
this Event rather singular and wonderful, for he was re
ceived in France with open arms ' ' But it is no more
than what might have been expected. Yet, from his
want of Success, he has been forced to abdicate again, and
has been sent into perpetual Banishment. -
But unto God we will leave the Event,
Who rules the Starst, which he for Signs hath sent,
And makes them fight in the Defence of Those,
That in their God doth their whole Trust repose."
I say it is impossible to look back upon all these won
derful Changes and Scenes, without observing the Opera
tions of the Hand of God herein, in order to bring about
the Reformation of Europe.—I now shall exhibit to my
Readers, an Hieroglyphic, alluding to these present
Times: Hieroglyphics were much used by the Ancients, *

Mars is strong, in his own House and Dignities, located
in the 11th. The Planet Saturn is in the 9th, in a Square

Earth." These are the principal Configurations of the
Planets at this Tropical Ingress. My Readers, no doubt;
are now in expectation of what I shall say, respecting
these eventful Times, and the Politics of Europe, &e. Of
late years, many remarkable things have been turning up,
and many strange Occurrences have taken place; and very
recently, amongst the rest, the Return of NApoleon Buo
NAPARTE to the Throne of France, which has excited no
little Agitation amongst most of the Powers of Europe:
And I expect, from the Configurations of the Planets at
this ingress, as well as from the ensuing visible Eclipses
of the Sun and Moon, that some further remarkable
Events will follow; some of which have lately taken
place, and others are now on the Anvil of State. Many
eminent Councils, and great Consultations, are secretly
carrying on in the Cabinets of Kings, Princes, and other
Potentates. The French Nation, ever since the departure
of their late Emperor, is much disturbed and peºplexed
by civil Broils and internal Commotions, fermented by
Foreign Powers . This I am afraid is still likely to
continue. O that they would consider the great Evil
there is in War! that formidable Scourge with which
God often chastises sinful Nations; it is, considered in
itself, a diabolical Work, which ravages the fair face of
God's Creation, and hurls Destruction among the noblest
of his Creatures in this World. The Abettors of this Evil
will surely have to answer for it hereafter. How 'blind
the Politics, how infatuated the Divinity, that can make
War palatable to the taste!—The influences and effects of
the Planets at this Time, together with the 8 of M and 3,
and the D of H and 3, now coming forward, will afflict
several parts of Germany, together with France, Holland,
Portugal, Spain, and Italy. Some of the European Powers
are still active, and I expect will be more so in the Spring
following: at present, they seem consulting and concert
ing such ways and means, as will, in all probability, expe
dite and hasten some important event ; and I am sorry to
find England is in some measure connected therewith; to
her Detriment and Loss; for I see she will sufferinºsome
degree, from the Insults of open Enemies, and the
of pretended Friends, but will triumph, I hope, in the end

# THAT glorious Luminary, the Sun, is the Fountain of
Light and Life; to him we chiefly owe the Variation of
the Seasons. He will now cross the Equinoctical Line,
and display his genial Influence on us in these Northern
Regions, by entering the celestial Sign Aries, which this
year he will do on Wednesday the 20th of March, at 9 min.
past 5 in the Afternoon; at which Time 21 deg. of mp,
ascend the Eastern Horizon, and 18 deg. of II culminate.
The Scheme above displays the Face of the Heavens and
Planetary Positions at that Time: the ad D G), et ad it
§, et #21.-I now come to consider, from the Planets,
as secondary Causes, what will probably be transacted upon
the Stage of Europe, together with the Connection of
Great Britain therewith. At this Ingress, all the Planets
are under the Earth, except the Sun and Mars; the Sun
is in the western Angle, and Mars is in the 9th House. It
thereforeseems to me, from this Figure, that some Occur
rences
46 º M.O. O. R. E 1816.*
rences of moment will take place during this year, and are
even now on the Anvil of State. Many eminent Councils,
and great Consultations, are secretly carrying ion in
the Cabinets of Kings, Princes, and great Potentates of the
Earth. The Powers of Europe are much divided amongs
themselves, each Power seeking its own Interest. ...'The
French are still active with their Sword (if necessary) as
well as in their Councils. Much Liberty, both Civil and
Religious, hitherto unknown, have been given to the
French People. And I also think that some of the Powers
on the Continent of Europe are much inclined to bring
about a Reconciliation between the French Nation, and
those that are and have becn hostile against her. It also
appears from the Figure, that the People of England have
their Doubts and Fears, respecting some Events that have
lately taken place in France, Spain, and Holland, as well
as in some parts of Germany. The Papistical Clergy, espe
cially the Cardinals, shall be cast down from their Digni
ties; and these shall obtain the Revolution of a new Em
pire, under which shall be administered universal Gladness.
. We shall, assuredly, find this, as well as the last, a very
busy Year, in which many notable Matters will he vigo
rously transacted. 'Tis the Influence of Heaven which in
stigates and drives on various Resolutions in the People in
general; and they are ordained by God Almighty, to shew
that Kingdoms and Commonwealths have both Risings.
and Downfalls in the Affections of Subjects, and that, no
Engagements hold so long and so firm in the People's Af
fections, as Justice impartially distributed, and a seasonable
Compliance for Redress of People's Grievances. If the
English wisely improve their Talents (as there is no doubt
but they will) then will their Fame be still more splendid,
* @
… and England will flourish again and again, which is my
hearty Wish. With Us and America, things begin, to ap
pear with a better face; and this I am also glad of. May
GoD protect my native Land,and bless the Councils of The
Prince Regent with Unanimity of Spirit, and sound Judg
ment ' The French, and other Powers, as well as Great
Britain, may, I expect, be keeping up some Standing
Forces, as there are still some warlike Appearances !

THIS Quarter begins when the Sun enters the Northern
Tropic, or the Sign Cancer; which, according to my Cal
"culations, will be, this year, upon Friday the 21st day of
June, at 45 min. past Two o'clock in the Afternoon ; at
which time, 9 deg. of Q is upon the Medium Coeli, and 29

Planet Mars in the 9th moving rapidly to an Opposition
of the Planet Saturn, who is under the Earth, retrograde,
: as if endeavouring to move from him--the direct Opposi
tion of these two Planets will not take place until the 18th
of July, yet their Influences will soon begin to act—the
Moon is posited in the Western Angle of the Figure, de
parting from a Square Aspect of Mars, and next applying
to a Sextile Aspect of Mercury, posited in the 9th House—
Jupiter and Mars have lately been in a Square Aspect—
From all which I infer, that this, like the last, will prove
“a busy Quarter, and there will be Rumours of some ap
‘proaching Troubles in Foreign Countries. But I hope we
shall flourish, and remain tranquil, amidst all the Changes
... and Alterations, still likely to take place in Europe. I
.."think the Church of Rome is falling to decay, notwith
standing the late propping up, both in France, Spain, and
*-elsewhere. There is in Revolutions and Vicissitudes of
Greatness, in various Nations, a Something, that must
obey the swing of that Wheel, not moved by Intelligences,
but by the Hand of God, whereby all Estates arise to their
Zenith, or Vertical Point, according to their predestinated
Periods. We have seen the Funerals of the greatest Mo
marchies, the posthumous Rubbish of mouldered Cities,
and the dreadful Carmage of numerous Armies—the Effects
of the ratified Decrees of the stubborn Destinies.

THIS Quarter takes place when the Sun, according to
Appearance, enters the Equinoctical Sign as, and then
crosses the Line in his way to the Southern Regions, until
he arrives at the Tropic of Capricorn, when the Winter
Quarter begins. This Autumnal Quarter will take place
on Monday the 23d day of September, at 43 min, past 4
o'clock in the Morning, when 16 deg. of my ascend, and 12
deg. of II are on the Mid-heaven. The D ab d of 2,

are, a [] of h and 3, and a C of 21 and 3—and on the
29th of October there happens a Square Aspect of SATURN
and JUPITER from m and 3:. At the time of this Ingress,
the Sun and Mars are in the Ascendant, afflicting each
other—Venus, the Moon, and Mercury, near each other in
the 2d House; all the Planets are under the Earth at this
Ingress. This Quarter, like the foregoing, will produce
“some particular Occurrences, both in France, Spain, Italy,
and some parts of Germany. There is a restless Party,
who will stir up Broils and Contentions. There is a Race
of Men in the World, who will bear no Restraint or Con
troul, though they be promoting the most unjust and ille
gal Attempts. But the Time is approaching, when Tyran
nical Governments must down; when the Power of the
motley Leopard, the Dragon, and such like Beasts of
Cruelty, will no longer prevail.—The noble House of
Austria will recover much from her hereditary Enemies; a
great General stoops to Fate! Death alone convinces us
