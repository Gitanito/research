During the past few years the worldwide   press has seen a virtual explosion of headlines claiming that a condition called   'REM intrusion' explains near-death experiences. The media's excitement makes it   sound like a final solution. However, the people who really know NDEs say, 'Not   so fast.'

REM intrusion is a condition that   occurs when some characteristics of the common REM sleep state'such as rapid eye   movement, low muscle tone, and dreaming'activate during wakefulness. Without   question, there are marked similarities between REM intrusion and NDEs, just as   there are similarities with other much-hyped earlier comparisons such as   temporal lobe epilepsy, oxygen deprivation, and the effects of some drugs.   However, once again, what the world's media overlooked in presenting the REM   findings are their marked differences .      	NDE research years ago firmly   	established clear distinctions between NDEs and hallucinations; NDErs who   	had also experienced REM intrusion were not asked to compare the two.  	REM intrusion does not explain key   	NDE elements such as veridical perception, lasting aftereffects, and visual   	perception in the blind  	REM intrusion experiencers   	immediately recognize that their visual and auditory experiences are not   	reality-based, whereas NDErs describe theirs as 'realer than real.'  	Although the published study   	concludes that a higher rate of REM intrusion predisposes a person to NDEs,   	the NDErs weren't asked when the intrusions occurred; so, it is just as   	likely that they occur as a result    	of an NDE. Further, 40% of the NDErs said they had never had REM intrusions   	at all.
