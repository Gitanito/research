  		          Introduction

  By Barbara Mango, Ph.D.

&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    				Contemporary near-death research began in earnest with the   				publication of Raymond Moody’s groundbreaking book,  				Life after Life.  				&nbsp; By the late 1970s,   				medical technology and advanced resuscitation techniques allowed   				more rigorous and empirically testable research to be conducted.&nbsp;  				 Science began to investigate the complex relationship   				between brain function, consciousness, and the near-death   				experience. &nbsp;

  				  				&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Researchers   				ultimately developed two opposing theories to explain the   				near-death experience: materialism and non-materialism.  				&nbsp;  The   				materialist approach posits that consciousness is produced by   				and is a sole function of the brain, thus, the near-death   				experience is explained as nothing more than the neurobiology of   				a dying brain. &nbsp; Since   				this model is still taught at most medical schools in the   				Western world, the majority of near-death researchers uphold   				this theory.

  				  				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  				    				  				The opposing paradigm, termed non-materialism, postulates   				consciousness is non-local, independent of matter, and not   				exclusively brain-based. Current research contends this theory   				offers a compelling and frequently verifiable explanation of the   				near-death experience. Advanced research in the fields of   				neuroscience, psychology, resuscitation science, and quantum   				mechanics challenges the veracity of the materialist theory.

  				  				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    				It is perplexing that materialist science continues to so   				rigidly adhere to a paradigm seemingly incongruent with   				cutting-edge research. Cardiologist and near-death researcher   				Pim van Lommel contends two major factors strengthen the   				persistent adherence to this model.

  				  				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    				According to philosopher Ilja Maso, nearly all government   				funding is awarded to traditional science.&nbsp;  				 It attracts most of the funding, achieves the most   				striking results, and is thought to employ the brightest minds.   				The more a vision deviates from this materialist paradigm, the   				lower its status and the less money it receives.[1]            
     &nbsp;  Secondly,   				materialists tend to reject any challenge to their rigidly held   				hypothesis. Non-materialists, such as philosopher Neal Grossman,   				are frequently ostracized by traditional colleagues simply   				because their research threatens the existing paradigm.&nbsp;  				 Grossman recalls such an experience:

  				  				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  				 One conversation in particular caused me to see the   				fundamental irrationality of academics with respect to the   				evidence against materialism…I asked [a colleague] “What will it   				take short of having a near-death experience yourself to   				convince you that it’s real?”&nbsp;  				 Very nonchalantly, without batting an eye, the response   				was: “Even if I were to have a near-death experience myself, I   				would conclude that I was hallucinating, rather than believe   				that my mind can exist independently of my brain.”[2]

    &nbsp;       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dutch Cardiologist Pim van Lommel   additionally reasons that the majority of researchers specializing in   consciousness research, including neuroscientists, psychologists, psychiatrists,   and philosophers, continue to argue that there is a&nbsp;   reductionist explanation for consciousness and near-death experiences. &nbsp;

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Bruce Greyson,   renowned psychiatrist and near-death researcher further counters traditional   skeptics by stating:

  …because we can now regularly bring people back from death, we can ask what   happens to them while they were dead—and their recollections of that period   makes possible a scientific exploration of what happens to human consciousness   after the body dies, pointing the way toward a new scientific theory of the   mind.[3]

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The   preponderance of current evidence suggests materialism fails to adequately   explain the near-death experience. In   Evidence of the Afterlife, Dr. Long presents nine converging lines of   evidence which together, make an exceptionally compelling argument for the   authenticity of near-death experiences. The most persuasive of these include   out-of-body experiences, sighted experiences reported by the congenitally blind,   and those occurring both under general anesthesia and during cardiac arrest. The   revolutionary field of quantum mechanics further substantiates the validity of   the intensely lucid experiences consistently reported by near death   experiencers.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Each of the   aforementioned lines of reasoning will be discussed in further detail. It is   seemingly inexplicable that conscious, lucid experiences can occur during a time   when&nbsp;&nbsp;  brain-function ceases.&nbsp;   It is the intention of this discussion to demystify the materialist   paradigm by examining current research, and in doing so, help bridge the gap   between science and spirituality.&nbsp;    Renowned academic neurosurgeon Eben Alexander shares this same vision.&nbsp;   Alexander is optimistic that, “All the arguing between “spiritual” people   and “scientific” people will stop, and we will join together in mapping and   understanding the true universe in ways not even dreamt of now”.[4]
