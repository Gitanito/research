    Even if you never have a near-death experience (NDE) on the surgeon's table, in a car accident or during a heart attack, you can reap the spiritual benefits claimed by NDErs. Through meditation, study and mental exercises, you can tap into the healing energy of the loving, nonjudgmental Being of Light   glimpsed by many at death's door. You can simulate a panoramic life-review of your entire existence, catapulting your values away from competitive materialism and toward love, service, cooperation; and you can integrate the insights commonly reported by NDErs into daily practical living. That's the message of this manual that, notwithstanding its aim of reaching out beyond the lucky privileged NDErs to the masses, mostly preaches to the converted. Veteran NDE researcher Ring (The Omega Project), here writing with Swiss NDE investigator Valarino, includes many previously unpublished NDE cases and distills techniques he has taught at workshops and university courses. In a book that reads like a New Age seminar, Ring presents intriguing evidence to support his belief that NDEs represent an authentic, objective experience, not a self-protective   hallucination or a neurological artifact of a dying brain. This material includes reports of out-of-body experiences, children's NDEs, blind people gaining sight during NDE episodes, and NDErs whose brush with death apparently unleashed paranormal or healing abilities. Skeptics will relish punching holes in each of these phenomena, and a more rigorous approach would have been welcome for the already overcrowded NDE shelf.

While providing many accounts of near-death experiences (NDEs) from men, women, and children of all ages and backgrounds, Lessons from the Light is more than just an inspiring collection of NDEs. In what many consider his strongest book, Kenneth Ring extracts the pure gold of the NDE and with a beautiful balance of science and human insight reveals the practical wisdom held   within these experiences. 

Lessons from the Light will help you to live your life with greater self-awareness, self-compassion, and concern for others. It will also extinguishes your fears of death and dying. Reading Lessons from the Light is an altogether transforming experience.--This text refers to the Paperback edition.

Here's  a sample of what people are saying about this book:

&quot;A  beautiful melding of research and compassionate, intuitive analysis.      An inspirational book filled  with both spiritual insight and practical information  to help us realize our own personal power.&quot;

Caroline  Myss, Ph.D., author of Anatomy of the Spirit

&quot;A  major contribution that offers a wealth of fresh case materials     together with balanced and insightful commentary.&quot;

Raymond  A. Moody, Ph.D., author of Life After Life and Reunions

&nbsp;

&quot;This  is unquestionably the most important book on the subject of     near-death experience since Moody's Life After Life.&quot;

Ian  Wilson, author of&nbsp;  The After Death  Experience

&nbsp;

&quot;In  this remarkable book, Ring presents evidence that merely learning     about the near-death experience has similar positive effects to those reported     by people who actually have had near-death experiences. Kenneth Ring is     one     of the few authors whose gifts include the capacity to transform their     readers' lives.&quot;&nbsp;

Stanley  Krippner, Ph.D., Professor of Psychology, Saybook Graduate     School, San Francisco,&nbsp;  co-author of  The Mythic Path, coeditor, Broken Images,     Broken Selves

&nbsp;

&quot;Lessons  from the Light is the best and most complete book on the     near-death experience I've ever read, and I believe it will help you     overcome your     fears of dying.&quot;

Seymour  Boorstein, M.D., Associate Clinical Professor of Psychiatry,     University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine and author of  Clinical Studies in     Transpersonal Psychotherapy.

&nbsp;

&quot;Lessons  from the Light is the culmination of Kenneth Ring's rich and

extensive  career as the foremost researcher of the NDE. One of the very     best books on the subject to date, it is a must read for anyone     interested in     life's possibilities.&quot;

Sukie  Miller, Ph.D., author of After Death: Mapping the Journey and     director of The Institute for the Study of the Afterdeath
