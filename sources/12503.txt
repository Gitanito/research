August 28th, 2005. 10:30 a.m. Having excruciating pain across shoulders and neck. Called my husband and said that I needed him with me. Called for nurses and they took electro cardiogram on two different machines and it did not show that I was having a heart attack. They soon knew because I went into cardiac arrest. I was gone for one minute and thirty-five seconds. At the time, I saw myself lying on the bed and I was floating above in a grey square area. My husband was there with me and saw my eyes go back in my head and yelled to the nurses that something was really wrong.
