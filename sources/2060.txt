Here is a list of&nbsp;more than two hundred of them.

At a time when mainstream science doubts the reality of psi,&nbsp;it can be surprising to learn that some high-profile scientists nevertheless consider it to be real – or at least deserving of scientific study. In fact,&nbsp;many scientists&nbsp;have thought this, as have thinkers and artists of all kinds – especially in the decades since the 1880s, when research societies were first established to investigate psi phenomena.1 If we believe psi to be real, perhaps persuaded by the scientific literature or by our own experiences, this list of more than&nbsp;two hundred intellectuals reminds us that we are in good company.

Objections can be made to some of the inclusions. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of Sherlock Holmes, was as dogmatic in defending séance phenomena as sceptics often are in criticizing it.2 The descriptions of personal psi experienced by the Swedish playwright August Strindberg would be of more interest to a clinical psychologist than to a parapsychological researcher. Some held obnoxious views: the pioneering French biologist Alexis Carrel favoured Nazi eugenics, for instance. But taken as a whole, the list overwhelmingly shows that women and men of genius in many areas of life – science, the arts, politics, invention – have shown a lively and at times professional interest in psi, and were irritated by those who tried to stifle it.

It has long been fashionable to argue that psi is simply ruled out by scientific norms – the constraints imposed by physics for instance, or by a knowledge of how the nervous system works. But the belief in the possibility of psi that was held by Nobel prizewinners such as physicists Einstein and Planck, and brain scientists Eccles and Ramón y Cajal, suggests we should treat such claims with caution. Nor should we be distracted by claims that only a psychologist is qualified to detect the myriad ways – whether sensory or cognitive&nbsp;– in which information can be conveyed, considering the presence here of foundational figures in psychophysics,3 experimental psychology,4 behaviorism,5 and dynamic psychology,&nbsp;and the fact that some scientists in these fields continue to support the study of psi.6

In terms of qualifications for inclusion, the people in this list achieved a high degree of eminence in a field independent of parapsychology (although some achieved eminence in the latter also); lived during the past century and a half, the period when psi became a subject of scientific research; and, with the exception of two living Nobel prizewinners, are all deceased.

Excluded are eminent individuals who displayed no knowledge or interest in psi phenomena while pursuing spiritual or occult concerns. Writers and artists are listed if they endorsed psi phenomena, but not if they merely referred to it in their works or if events in their lives could be interpreted as psi, as in the case of&nbsp;the Spanish poet Federico García Lorca who seemed to&nbsp;precisely anticipate&nbsp;the date of his execution five years beforehand in one of his plays.7 Since nothing is known about his views about psi, he is excluded. Doubts must also remain about the great stage magician and debunker Harry Houdini, who left a code as a means to ascertain whether he could contact his wife after his death,8 but was vocally hostile to the idea of mediums talking with the dead.

In general, the men and women listed here believed in psi phenomena for the same reasons as do most other people: personal experience (their own or of loved ones) or from reading the research literature. In the first category falls Mark Twain, who dreamed in detail about the future death of his brother,9 and the visions experienced by Ted Hughes’s mother.10 In the second category fall Cesare Lombroso and founding members of the Society for Psychical Research (SPR) such as Eleanor Sidgwick and Richard Hodgson, who took a lot of convincing by other researchers before they would endorse the validity of a phenomenon.11

The people named here manifested their interest in psi in different, but not necessarily exclusive, ways. One of these can be termed a shift in central interest, in which the individual leaves behind a mainstream scientific activity in order to focus primarily on psi research. The French scientist Charles Richet is a good example of this; in later life he largely abandoned the studies of physiology that had earned him a Nobel prize in order to concentrate on parapsychology and hypnosis, eventually becoming president of both the SPR and the Institut Métapsychique International.

By contrast, a parallel central interest is exemplified by those who maintained their activity in a mainstream scientific endeavor while also pursuing psi research. Good examples are the Sidgwicks. Henry Sidgwick, one of the great modern ethical philosophers,12 was the first president of the SPR but went on contributing prolifically on subjects relating to ethics, politics and science while holding a professorship at the University of Cambridge. His wife Eleanor (née Balfour), a later SPR president, was a mathematician and educator who served as Principal of Newnham College, only the second college at Cambridge to accept women, while also applying her keen mind to psychical research.

For some of the figures in the list, psi interests were secondary to their other activities. These include Nobel prizewinners Marie and Pierre Curie, who attended séances with Eusapia Palladino and wrote about the importance of studying psi phenomena.13 Others are Santiago Ramón y Cajal14 and John C Eccles.15

Some figures aimed to integrate psi with larger concerns. This applies to William James, a central figure in both psychology and philosophy, who not only participated in psi research and wrote important papers – most famously regarding the medium Leonora Piper, whom he considered his 'white crow' – but sought to integrate psi within a larger framework. In physics, David Bohm16 discussed how psi phenomena might be accommodated within his theory of wholeness and implicate order, while Evans Harris Walker developed a quantum mechanics theory of psi.17 The philosopher Henri Bergson considered psi within his larger discussion of time, consciousness, and evolution.18

Psi phenomena have also served as inspiration for both technological and artistic achievements. Among scientists there is the extraordinary case of Hans Berger, inspired by an experience in which his sister, seventy miles away, intuitively felt his brush with death during a military exercise and immediately had their father send him a telegram. When Berger later invented the electroencephalogram (EEG), it was partly to discover if the machine might detect psi.19

Psi phenomena have been used as a topic for fiction – in the novels of Philip K&nbsp;Dick, the plays of JB&nbsp;Priestley, or the films of Andrei Tarkovsky, among many others. But they have also served as the real-life inspirations for the works themselves. André Breton described a number of ostensible psi phenomena in Nadja, L’Amour Fou and other books, as part of a surrealist exploration of alterations of consciousness and psi phenomena.20 The poet James Merrill partly channeled through a Ouija board his Pulitzer and National Book Awards winner The Changing Light at Sandover, proving that not only metaphysical pap comes from automatic writing.21 But can psi eliminate the need for a physical expression of the artwork altogether? This is what František Kupka and Wassily Kandinsky thought earlier in the twentieth century, as does now the performance artist Marina Abramović.22

Another category is of authors who worked as psi researcher-participants. This applies to the American novelist Upton Sinclair, whose book Mental Radio23 describes a long series of telepathy experiments he carried out himself, with his wife Mary Craig Kimborough acting as the perceiving subject. Another influential book was JW Dunne’s An Experiment with Time,24 in which the author discussed in detail a number of his ostensibly precognitive dreams.

Some had a veiled interest in psi. One&nbsp;is the painter Hilma af Klint, who in addition to her main activity of painting portraits and plants conducted a decades-long program of other painterly activities, based on either direct automatic writing and painting, or on an elaboration of messages that she believed she received from higher spiritual sources.

In the realm of politics at least two prime ministers, Britain’s Arthur Balfour and Canada’s William Lyon Mackenzie King, privately consulted with mediums without this impacting on their professional work.25

In the category of explicit acceptance can be cited a casual mention by the Russian dissident writer Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn in his book The Gulag Archipelago of psi abilities possessed by one of his former cellmates: ‘There is no doubt that he had the gift of precognition’, Solzhenitsyn wrote. ‘More than once he went around in the cell in the morning and pointed: Today they are going to come for you and you. I saw it in my dream. And they came and got them.’26 The pioneering computer scientist Alan Turing27 referred to the ‘overwhelming’ statistical evidence for telepathy in a landmark paper on artificial intelligence. A different sort of example is Otto Stern, who was so fearful of the damaging psychokinetic effects that fellow physicist Wolfgang Pauli seemed to leave in his wake that he barred Pauli from entering his laboratory.

Finally there are those who can be characterized as true sceptics, being open to the possibility of psi phenomena without having arrived at a definite conclusion.28 In this category we find Albert Einstein, who in a sympathetic preface to Sinclair’s Mental Radio confessed that his original disbelief had softened as he became more familiar with psi. Similarly, Max Planck expressed support of research by fellow physicist Oliver Lodge’s investigations of psi phenomena, considering them plausible.&nbsp;

Note: this list may underrepresent people who fulfill the criteria, and tends to favour authors from the American and European continents, for whom information was more easily&nbsp;accessible. Most entries contain a single reference, although some made many contributions. Some of this information appeared previously in an issue&nbsp;of Mindfield, the bulletin of the Parapsychological Association.
