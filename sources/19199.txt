unknown uh and unexplicable events from
the standpoint of UFO and this is
important because it&#39;s an admission that
the phenomenon exists of course um their
present approach is to handle the
problem with a certain care but not to
deny it this is extremely positive um
probably they prefer that other people
um may find the right clue to explain
the problem and is what what we are
trying to do of course on a volunteer
basis of course but it is
so uh another interesting thing is that
recently um we could uh check um some
old documents um they are um documents
from uh the the 30s and um this um
documents ref um are linked mainly to
sightings in 1936 and they show that
even the fascist government that at that
moment uh was handling with the problem
of
UFOs the story is this we received from
an anonymous source these documents and
at the problem of checking everything
from the standpoint of History of
documents and above all we had to add
this documents analyzed from a chemical
uh and historical point of view uh the
result was positive completely positive
in fact we um gave also these documents
to the Italian Air Force in order to
have also their opinion and to see if
they knew nothing more about this the
answer that was that they know nothing
more but in any case is yes the
documents are authentic the conclusion
was that during the
30s Italy was involved um with sightings
of unknown
aircrafts and that moment musolini was
very embarrassed
and
really had problems because um the idea
that uh the Italian power in the air
because the Italian Force were was
really very very important that moment
well this could even led him to to
change his foreign politics of course
because he he feared that uh this
unknown aircrafts might be English or
French of course but uh they were not
obviously uh by the way there are cases
um of elongated objects uh like we see
in EOC cases today expelling uh um
lesser object lesser
um identified flying objects in the form
of the classical Flying Saucer and this
um sighting for instance occurred in the
sky of Venice and we had two fighters of
the royal Italian Air Force at the time
who tried to intercept the objects in
vain of course so in other words there
is nothing new Under the Sun but this is
important because it proves uh what we
always thought that is that the eosi
things began much before 1947 and
everywhere of course in
1978 we uh obtained for the first time
um an official dossier of uh it Alan Air
Force documents we requested them um
according a certain definite procedure
it was not easy but at last we obtained
them from the standpoint of the nature
of the sightings the uh Air Force
documents uh show that we are facing
definite objects uh that these objects
are detected by radar and that uh uh
military Pilots uh had Encounters in the
skies of Italy exactly like uh elsewhere
and um when the Italian Air Force says
that they have
215 cases still
unexplained means that they are eupo
sightings uh which have unknown
characteristics for instance there are
cases of jet military planes
intercepting this objects in the skies
of Italy and normally these objects uh
go away without the possibility of being
intercepted all this um if we had also
the the problem of traces for instance
uh there are
also does you mean Landing yeah Landing
traces and all this this is a very
delicate subject because uh
just a few admissions are made by the
military about this but if we consider
that even there forms their blank forms
uh about the EO subjects uh show a lot
of parameters which
are really
defined at the very minimum extent you
understand that uh what is written there
is surely part of the cases they faced
because otherwise they never would have
put such uh details on the forms
so sometimes the documents speak for
themselves first time we succeeded in
half a century to have as uh guest uh an
official delegation of the Italian Air
Force uh which came to our EO
congress with other 16 foreign delegates
to speak officially and in uniform about
the EO problem the speaker was um
General Olivero uh at that time he was
still a colonal but now he&#39;s a general
and he is the chief of uh the
intelligence office of the Italian Air
Force which is um charge also to follow
the EO cases of course colon Lio was
um
sufficiently um careful in saying
certain things and not saying certain
other things but what is important that
he say that the problem exists that the
Italian force is handling this difficult
thing since
1978 that they have on file at least
215 eupo cases that they are still
controlling the Italian airspace in
order to control the situation from the
standpoint of EO and that really there
are unexplicable cases uh besides he was
also asked officially by the Press what
uh he thought on a personal
basis and it said that uh as a pilot
since he is a pilot he had known and he
knew and he knows uh serious colleagues
serious pilots who really had encounters
with UFOs and he said I trust them in
the &#39;90s we had two different cases in
Italy uh they both occurred in campia
campia is uh the region near
Naples and uh we had two different
Landings and the landing
traces left by these two different
objects uh uh were uh analyzed in a
laboratory by our experts and uh we uh
got certain
results uh that this we discovered that
the objects after their Landing had
really bombed the surface of the soil
with
microwaves uh and with high intensity
high high frequency
microwaves uh we could check and Define
this man this effect so uh we could um
compare and confirm in this way uh the
the world famous case of trans and
provance in uh in France uh which
occurred in
1981 and uh which is a classic from this
point of view uh it was very important
because when we went to tus and we
confronted the data we saw that the
effects were very similar and this was
very very important we have good
relationships with the French even if
they are govern Al body of course and
our organization is a private one Mr
Vasco is the head of the governmental
body who who St St who studies the eupo
problem in France this is important what
has he concluded does he do they think
this is real or fictitious excuse me do
they think that the phenomenon is real
or fictitious no no no the no no no the
the approach of Vasco is extremely
positive they think that the problem is
real that we are having
we are um confronting a real phenomenon
a technological phenomenon of unnown
nature the position of the French is
extremely open and extremely realistic
the possibilities of UFOs are much uh
Superior than we think really probably
it&#39;s uh it&#39;s hard to say that fly that
unidentified flying objects uh fly what
does it mean fly
uh we a plane flies because it has a
sort of portance but probably uh UFOs
use another kind of propulsion and for
them it&#39;s absolutely the same to to
proceed in fluid like water or an
atmosphere like ours or the atmosphere
of another planet or even the vacuum the
void so it&#39;s a quite different kind of
proportion and even the cases in our
seas show
this we had a lot of cases of pilots in
Italy but civilians and uh military uh
who really had this encounters for
instance in
1973 we had a very famous case three
planes were involved
over the airport of Trine and at present
um one of these three Pilots is still
alive in fact we succeeded in having him
uh as a guest in the submarino Symposium
um this this man um the name is trilio
and was one of the um Pilots of the
three planes involved we had um um a
sighting of from three different planes
and from the Tower of the tourin airport
besides the object was also on the r
screens so it&#39;s very important um after
this object took off and went to our
friends and so the story was over but um
all the Italian newspapers mentioned
this case because the Witnesses were not
only the pilots but also a lot of people
in the on the ground
something
like a flying luminous egg something
like that um another important case was
the case of a general now is no longer
in the Air Force because uh uh General
salvator maretti in
1976 yes um W when he was
the the chief of the um
flight school of the Italian Air Force
in leche um happened to to meet a
tremendous object IM imagine he was
flying and he Co suddenly he suddenly
saw a green light over him he just rised
the eyes towards the height and so an
incredible line a a a curve line green
of a big compact object over the
cockpit and he understood that something
enormous huge was over the plane he he
didn&#39;t know what to do seconds later
minutes later he still doesn&#39;t know how
long this experience lasted he saw
suddenly this Mass took off with a
tremendous
speed it didn&#39;t um check this object on
the r screen
asked without mentioning this sighting
to the tower if they had anything
strange on the r screen they hadn&#39;t but
he saw this and in fact only when he
left the Italian Air Force he of course
mentioned this uh event if we consider
um from a statis iCal point of view all
the cases we are
facing
surely um I think that a good half of uh
these cases may have some
different Origins but uh a good health
is surely linked to a technological
phenomenon of unknown
nature of of unknown
technology if we have to try to explain
all this in Practical terms I think that
still the extra terrestrial hypothesis
is uh the hypothesis which is able to
explain more than any other hypothesis
what&#39;s going
on besides if we consider that the EOC
cases um can and must be
compared we still see definite patterns
in these cases and this is extremely
important because this means that the
EOC cases have a sort of have have their
own um rules their own um particular uh
characteristics their
own patterns and if you you see that
these patterns lead us to think that
unknown beings humanoid in form um and
of Unknown Origin are visiting
H much before the
1946 I think that really the only
possible explanation is the
Extraterrestrial hypothesis from a
logical point of
view I don&#39;t think that we have nothing
to to fear because uh uh if uh we who
face hostile beings well surely they
would have conquered us or made
incredible things um in the past they
could really if this didn&#39;t happen
surely is because we have nothing to
fear I think I don&#39;t say nothing new
saying that uh probably there is uh
every in every part of the world
probably with invisible links a definite
invisible College we may call it
so even if uh this expression why used
in a different sense by Joseph alen Heek
uh which is uh facing this sub this
subject from the standpoint of
research um secretly in order to have
gains and Technologies to be applied in
a quite
different
uh
approach because the problem is
that um people does understand a very
important things thing um the yuo
problem is not only a scientific problem
it is also an intelligence problem this
is the second important face of the eup
for reality and we uh when we begin to
understand this we may understand a lot
of things because all this has to do
with power power everywhere in every
country in every with every government
with every
situation don&#39;t worry about it folks he
said that&#39;s
all
spotlights but being an idiot like me I
jump and I say colonel I said what do
you mean spotlights there&#39;s no
clouds there&#39;s no beam of light coming
from any place and you&#39;re telling us
it&#39;s spot lights and he told me to shut
up and just then a bird colonel jumps up
and he I knew the bird colonel CU I
that&#39;s why I knew he was bird name was
the Miller he jumps up and he says
Colonel he said you shut up
