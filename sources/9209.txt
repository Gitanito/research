I was then looking down on myself from a panoramic angle. I was floating.  I could see tubes going up my nose and then out of my mouth, but there was no pain.  I could see my face and also the insides of my nose almost like layers. 

The doctors and nurses were all fussing and then one of the nurses put my Rupert Bear back under my arm. 

That's all I remember. 

When I came round my mum said they could not find anything wrong with my tonsils, so they took my adenoids out instead.
