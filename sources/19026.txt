hello Dr Greer welcome and I hope you
had a great holiday with your family
hello Pat and thank you and I hope you
did also and everyone happy New Year and
holidays hope everyone has a great 2024
it&#39;s going to be interesting they say um
I think a lot of big changes in the next
12 WE 12 months it&#39;s sort of it would
probably be better to say that you know
buckle up buckle up yes indeed here we
go okay so um so I think that this
year-end disclosure update that we&#39;re
going to do here really will help to
answer the many many questions that
people have about the ndaa what has
happened with it and I think they&#39;d love
to hear your own opinion on um some of
the interviews and some of the news that
has come out in mainstream media there&#39;s
been a lot and people have tried to sift
through this it&#39;s impossible to figure
out what&#39;s true and what isn&#39;t there&#39;s
all kinds of all kinds of stuff being
said out there so yes and we&#39;ve heard
that we&#39;ve heard that personally uh from
people like Tucker Carlson and members
of Congress and uh other people from all
walks of life who&#39;ve Conta that we just
just don&#39;t know what to believe who to
trust what&#39;s there because when people
begin to look into this here&#39;s the key
thing 90% of the information out there
are like pre-positioned weapons of mass
destruction from a psychological and uh
psychological warfare point of view and
so if you start looking into this with
not a whole lot of background
information it&#39;s very easy to get
diverted into the disinformation or
false information as opposed to the
information it&#39;s a big problem it&#39;s a
problem I&#39;ve been dealing with for over
30 years uh December marks the 30th year
anniversary of my briefing the first CIA
director we did with h Clinton and 30
years on I don&#39;t think a whole lot has
changed in that regard because what we
call the fund of knowledge the basic
information that these leaders in
Washington have and and certainly
journalists and the general public is is
an ad mixture of myth and information
and deliberately uh offered false
information for its manipulative value
and that I think is is the biggest
problem that we saw in the 90s when I
wrote the paper uh when disclosure
serves secrecy the secret agenda so the
very people who kept this secret their
agenda is always the one that&#39;s going to
be Pur push forward because they have
assets embedded everywhere throughout
media and government and elsewhere and
and and the result is that they end up
uh putting out information that has a
kernel of Truth in it that&#39;s surrounded
by a poison pill of of
disinformation um so it&#39;s sort of like a
sweet coding on the outside that looks
true and then you take the poison so
that that&#39;s something that&#39;s been
developed since the 50s so as you all
know from the CIA document we acquired
after I briefed the CI director about
this where in 1953 they talked about
the great psychological warfare value of
the UFO subject so we&#39;re 70 years into
those guys having a running start on
what&#39;s now beginning to be just the
disclosure concept that I I found that
in the 90s is now used and all in the
mainstream media is called disclosure
you know someone joked or so trademark
that I&#39;m just I&#39;m just kidding but that
unfortunately we know that whether
you&#39;re the president and you have
someone come in with a portfolio of
false information or you&#39;re a journalist
you&#39;re going to first have the people
shoved in your face who are um Counter
Intelligence uh disinformation
operatives uh even though they may not
come across that way initially so it&#39;s
complicated problem um and it&#39;s why
there is so much confusion and
consternation and and what have you
right so um can you discuss this ndaa
and can you tell me or tell our
listeners What policies um have CH
towards this UAP research and
transparency are they more transparent
and how is this going to impact people&#39;s
future uh what can we expect this year
well to be honest with you a great deal
of the most important aspects of it was
gutted by the conference committee
between the Senate and the house what
the Senate passed was pretty aggressive
and the Senate intelligence committee
and the folks I&#39;ve been working with
there uh it came out of committee
unanimously to put this amnesty or safe
haror period in so that individual
corporations would have six months to
come clean then they&#39;d be in violation
of the law explicitly Etc a lot of that
was taken out um now there were other
parts of it that were problematic that I
think resulted in other parts of it
being taken out and we&#39;re going to get
into something here very controversial
what I&#39;m about to say but there were
some Provisions in there modeled on the
uh JFK assassination records act uh
which was Valley Hood as a great step
forward in reality the JFK records act
resulted in the continued cover up of
the most sensitive information
surrounding that event and everyone
knows that um and so the other problem
with this is that there was going to be
a nine member panel appointed by the
president and then confirmed by the
Senate and
unfortunately neither the people in
Congress nor the White House and I would
say most of the UFO research community
don&#39;t know the history of these panels
of the Robertson panel
1953 was set up uh as an objective
research project to look into the UFO
issue and it turned out we have
documents that state this that do Donald
menel of Harvard and other people on
that panel uh in a CIA document have
were on the payroll and were embedded to
sort of skew the results and steer that
panel into a dead end the same thing
happened the M few years later
1969 the Condon committee with Professor
Condon at University of Colorado they
were set up to get to the bottom of this
we have CIA documents it&#39;s all going to
be in the archive that all of you can
read these are official documents not
contested their provenance is not in
doubt and it
states the key members of that panel
including Professor Conan himself were
on the payroll of the CIA and were
actually operatives but that that had to
be kept very secret we have that
document um and it turns out as you know
from the disclosure project uh initially
the group of witnesses that came forward
in in 19 2001 uh Dr Robert Woods who is
a McDonald Douglas aircraft who which of
course that merge with Boeing uh Mr
McDonald himself of McDonald Douglas
wanted him to look into the UFO issue he
did he found all this hard evidence and
he was going to be on that committee
with Professor Condon the the Condon
committee
and Professor Condon went to Mr McDonald
and told him to fire him and he was
kicked off that committee because he had
actual evidence as opposed to the myth
and the cover up so there&#39;s a problem
with this and this is could there&#39; be
nine people that would be appointed by
these bureaucrats and people in the
government who would not be corrupted
clandestinely it&#39;s not like they&#39;re
wearing a badge here&#39;s the niev of the
public no one wears a badge saying I&#39;m a
covert CIA operative right so these
people U you know whether they&#39;re bribed
or there&#39;s Oppo research on them or they
did something illegal that they can hold
over them or some personal problem um or
money I mean all you know all the above
has been been done to me and offered to
me and so what I see is that that would
have been very difficult because it
would have also been a under top secret
clearance and then they could decide
whatever they found which parts the
public would know and which parts they
wouldn&#39;t what that means is that there
would be just pum that probably profer
to the public and the media now some
people have said I&#39;m working with in the
Senate that that&#39;s a rather cynical view
but I think it&#39;s because it&#39;s not
cynical it&#39;s realistic if you know the
history so if you don&#39;t know the history
you&#39;re going to repeat it and
unfortunately the members of Congress
who conceived of that I don&#39;t think know
this 70-year history of how this has
been covered up what the mechanisms are
and how those efforts have been
corrupted
therefore um the real action needs to be
and this what we&#39;ve been saying for 30
years is an open not classified Hearing
in the Senate and House and a true
investigation now I will tell you having
worked for years now very intimately
with the most senior people in the house
and the Senate particularly the last two
years there&#39;s no real investigation
going on because they haven&#39;t staffed
that up yet when I first met with the
senior um officials on the Senate
intelligence committee couple years ago
the plan was they were going to put on a
a group of about 30 investigators to get
to the bottom of this and and that
funding and that process never began
they opened the arrow office A a o at
Pentagon but that office also um was
doing conducting all of its debriefings
of the whistleblowers we brought in in a
skiff secure compartmented information
facility top secret where a lot of that
was covered up and not sent back over to
the members of the Congress I know for a
fact how do I know that listen carefully
everyone we would bring people over to
Washington they would first meet with my
trusted folks who are really the wh hat
Good Guys Senate Intel Senate armed
services Etc so they would get all that
information from these whistleblowers
first then they would draw drive them
over to the skiff or Arrow or the
Pentagon and so they knew when when that
Arrow office and Dr kpatrick was
covering up the testimony and
information given by some of the most
important firsthand
Witnesses um which
unfortunately at this point I can&#39;t name
who all those were but I&#39;ll just give
everyone an example none of you know who
this guy is it&#39;s a firsthand
whistleblower not like Mr gush someone
who secondhand and he was at Area 51 for
years he was actually in
in control of communication monitoring
of of the of all telephone conversations
and everything in the very top secret S4
and other areas uh he worked this issue
for a number of years and also was at
Wright Patterson Air Force Space um and
what he shared Dr katrick didn&#39;t want to
hear and then left it out of of what he
would then send up to even the top
secret gang of eight folks in the
Congress so that&#39;s why you saw last
spring a rather strong letter from
Senators Rubio and uh uh Senator Warner
of Virginia that said Point Blank it was
sort of castigating the Aro office for
having done that now the reason they
knew that had been
done we had made sure that they had that
information independently so it&#39;s a
check and a balance um so that&#39;s what
we&#39;ve been doing I know it&#39;s shocking to
some people to hear this but you have to
you cannot trust folks who are in these
positions not to be corrupted or
corruptible now ultimately the way to
get around that is to do this and take
it completely out of and this is where I
completely agree with you know
Congressman Moscow with he&#39;s a Democrat
from Miami uh and and berett a
republican from Tennessee Luna it&#39;s
across the Spectrum in the house
oversight where they realize they need
to have an open hearing and they need to
have subpoena power and that is what
we&#39;re now working with them on and we
just proferred and sent over to them uh
a couple weeks ago before Christmas um
23 of the first uh really important top
secret firsthand whistleblowers to be
subpena and if they&#39;re
subpoena they&#39;re testifying under oath
if they lie they can be prosecuted and
it gives them cover more importantly
most of them want to be sure it&#39;s
they&#39;re they&#39;re giving cover and
protection for coming forward uh uh two
weeks ago we had a brand new lieutenant
colonel Air Force retired who was at a
very important Air Force Base and dealt
directly with the pilots and the
aircraft that are the man-made UFOs that
of course right now you have an army of
ufologists going up there telling people
that didn&#39;t exist right that&#39;s the
biggest part of the cover up heads up
everyone it&#39;s not about the
extraterrestrials aliens it&#39;s about what
we have because those Technologies uh
disclosed would terminate the oil
industry and the Cent for utilities and
all of that you know it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s
hundreds of trillions of dollars so I
think that one of the problems is is
being sure that the people who are
firsthand get peut and it&#39;s the correct
people but then there&#39;s another level
and that is what we&#39;ve been spending a
lot of time on behind the scenes is and
I&#39;m not going to say who I&#39;m doing this
with but like when there have been some
of the earlier hearings they&#39;ll contact
me and ask me what questions to ask the
big problem because I&#39;ve been doing this
now for 30 some years and have debriefed
over a thousand literally over a
thousand
whistleblowers um you have to know
enough to ask the follow on to the
follow on to the follow on question it
was complicated in other words you need
to have a certain level of knowledge
even know what the next question would
be to be frank I want to get into the
weeds too far with this but that&#39;s why
there was a huge educational learning
curve for members of Congress or or
White House who are incredibly busy with
a million things the Middle East blowing
up China Russia Ukraine blah blah blah
the economy um and and so to get them
you know up to up to date and up to
speed correctly with information and not
false information very difficult to do
and very timeconsuming that&#39;s what we&#39;re
that&#39;s behind I&#39;m giving people a
glimpse behind the scenes of what we&#39;re
trying to do and and have been doing
rather successfully but it&#39;s it&#39;s slow
going of course now the other thing
that&#39;s uh happening that happened in
2024 towards the very end of the year
um there
were sorry you mean 2023 yes I&#39;m getting
my ahead of myself a year
that&#39;s okay you&#39;re almost there yeah hey
man I&#39;m I&#39;m a man in a hurry right you
know I ain&#39;t getting no younger girl
so don&#39;t I know it um so you know I was
thinking the other day I was 34 when I
started this disclosure effort and now
I&#39;m 68 half my
life um but at any rate what I what I
think is very important for people to
appreciate is the volume of information
that&#39;s out there that we have versus the
volume of disinformation that&#39;s the
mythology and the dominant Paradigm is
the mythology right right and and and so
when they have these people go up there
they have a little bit of knowledge all
right let&#39;s say you&#39;re a secondhand
witness or you&#39;re an
operative uh like Luis alzando you&#39;re
going to provide the information that
the coverup artists want them to provide
uh and or you just simply don&#39;t know uh
and you find it unbelievable and this is
why some of the pilots like uh David
fraver who whom I&#39;ve spoken with very
sincerely believe that those objects he
chased had to be From Another Dimension
another world another planet whatever
and that we couldn&#39;t possibly have
something like that and yet we have
knowledge and proof that those were in
fact from the locked Skunk
Works now another update um in late
September um I was taken by a classified
helicopter and a very um high-ranking
person inside the secret U deep black
government programs to two black sites
out west um at very low altitude and I
have that video I think you&#39;ve seen some
of it um including the opening to The
Underground facility at at one of them
that was run by the locki Skunk Works
Corporation and Boeing which work
seamlessly and another one that north of
gramman and U it&#39;s a it&#39;s a site that I
know the most senior people in the
Congress that we&#39;ve handed this over to
subsequent to this and we have had no
idea existed they didn&#39;t know the sites
existed they didn&#39;t know what was
underground there it&#39;s like an antill
where you go under and then it&#39;s this
huge complex
underneath uh in the deserts out west
and U this particular site had um
electromagnetic pulse weapons uh that of
course an electromagnetic pulse is what
you get from a a nuclear blast but just
that pulse Factor can be weaponized now
that&#39;s against the nuclear
nonproliferation treaty but we have them
and of course organization doing this to
care less about law treaties
international law Etc who cares if
you&#39;re going to be Rogue and break the
law you&#39;re you&#39;re G to break all of them
right right so what has happened when I
was over this site I realized he this
gentleman is is a senior operator there
very senior who actually has handled the
Biologicals meaning the dead bodies of
the ETS but also of the human Pilots
that we&#39;ve killed that have accidentally
stayed into that airspace during an
operation that have been struck with
these uh electromagnetic pulse weapons
at both sites the one site I was over he
said about two ET craft a year are
knocked down there and that that he&#39;s
been involved with retrieving and and
opsc operational security around it um
he extremely
senior and so the it was kind of spooky
because there was a security vehicle
right by one of those as we descended
right over the site maybe 100 200 feet
uh AGL about ground level but um and the
director of the law enforcement uh
Strike Team that we&#39;ve been providing
information to is behind me and the back
of the back SE of the chopper but the
purpose of this was for us to review
this site because besides the fact that
they&#39;re targeting and knocking down to
ET craft and by accident unfortunately a
civilian
aircraft and they just completely get
rid of the fuselage and the bodies of
these poor people who have been killed
over this site um and and that&#39;s
something we&#39;re looking at opening up a
major investigation uh and lawsuit over
uh because it&#39;s a lot of people over the
years that have been killed this one
site&#39;s been fully operational for 40
years and four Zer four Zer and yeah 40
and have on average killed about two ET
craft and and retrieve those um victims
uh during that period so that&#39;s 80 crash
retrievals just at one site the other
site similar number um so when I tell
people we have 122 crash retreat evil
cases those are the ones that we have
had people come forward and talk about
there&#39;s obviously probably more than a
thousand over the years and I would say
globally much more than that the other
problem is that we found out that that
same
site uh this operation they have people
who&#39; have been trained using very
Advanced
Technologies and what I described in
1991 is consciousness assisted
technology interface between thought
Consciousness and Technology to
essentially hijack an ET vehicle bring
it into the area and kill it um and this
particular gentleman is handing over to
us a couple of these operators that do
that most of the people doing that are
killed in the process of their training
uh but there are some alive and a couple
of them are coming forward um now that
sounds like science fiction but it&#39;s
true and this is part of the problem is
that the deeper you go into the
subject the rabbit hole just gets
crazier
and and the truth is way more
unbelievable than the fiction being sold
now of course all these senior folks
who&#39;ve approached us know about how
they&#39;ve been conducting abductions
making them look alien what those
Technologies entail how they&#39;ve been
doing and why they&#39;ve been doing
mutilations we have a new whistleblower
Who&#39;s involved in that
directly um it&#39;s very dark stuff as
Tucker Carlson recently said in an
interview with someone but he doesn&#39;t
know that a lot of the the the stage
crafting of the scariest stuff covert
human programs conducting them
for their psychological warfare value
quote unquote quote the CI
document um but that&#39;s something we hope
to clear up with with Mr Carlson soon
and some other journalists uh who have
been gaslit by some false information
yeah I mean his comments um I don&#39;t know
if you want to speak to any of his uh
comments that are particular comments
you might want to because they&#39;re out
there in the public domain and I think
this has caused a great deal of of um
confusion with the public and people who
follow this not just the public but
people in the government in law
enforcement serious oh it is it totally
is and and and the but that&#39;s the
intention right is not to bring Clarity
it&#39;s to bring confusion
to to hide and off escate with false
information and false narratives but the
stage craft the staging of these false
events is so well done right uh you have
very Advanced aircraft that are
anti-gravity that are human you have
very Advanced Technologies of things
that look like an alien that aren&#39;t and
then on top of it there&#39;s been this
deliberate con conflation and confusion
around extraterrestrial and
extradimensional
right and you know it it doesn&#39;t assume
that he it doesn&#39;t appear that he may be
doing this on purpose I just think he
doesn&#39;t know at all so no he doesn&#39;t no
totally innoc totally totally totally
innocent right right and and he said he
thinks that ETS have been here for
forever and that the US government has
made contact with them for some time and
that he finds this disturbing um does he
have proof of any of this and if he does
um what should he do with it well no he
he&#39;s heard heard these accounts some
secondhand and that part of it true
there have been ETS that have around on
the planet for probably longer than Homo
sapiens humans uh there have been events
that happened early on with contact and
then of course we ended up betraying
those ETS uh back in the 50s I always
tell people can you name a single treaty
the US government has done with anyone
where they haven&#39;t betrayed it I&#39;d like
to hear about it um you know being a you
know my grandmother&#39;s half Cherokee
Native American asked them how that
worked out with the trailers where they
were mostly the genocide of the Cherokee
Nation um so I think one of one of the
problems with this also is uh if if
you&#39;re a little bit of knowledge is a a
very extremely dangerous thing I mean
I&#39;ve said this now for most of 2023
because it was quite clear that there
were people coming forward that had
secondhand inform
information and are just look looking
into the issue quite recently in the
last few months maybe last couple years
uh like Mr grush and it&#39;s very easy to
lose your way through that Wilderness
that&#39;s been created
deliberately I think the other bigger
problem is U many of the events are not
even the staged fake alien events
they&#39;re Things From Another Dimension
and I was recently on a um Twitter
spaces interview I guess there were 50
60 people listening right and I went I
went on it deliberately because there
was a group that deals with all the
reptilian you know uh yeah myth and of
course no one on that understood the
difference
between an extradimensional
interdimensional being that is brought
From Another
Dimension all right which exists and an
extraterrestrial biological entity from
another planet and star system the
problem the reason it gets so confusing
this why I encourage people to look on
our YouTube channel here uh we have a
whole afternoon event talking about this
the cosmic structure and architecture
and all these different phenomenon
phenomena that get called phenomenon all
right so there are multiple phenomena
plural being called one thing UAP
whatever U and that&#39;s bad because what
happens is that you have quite spooky
scary things that can be induced let&#39;s
say brought forward From Another
Dimension that aren&#39;t extraterrestrial
but sure would look like one and sure
would confuse people so now you have
three things going on you have the
actual eens extraterrestrial biological
entities with actual spacecraft but they
travel when they&#39;re their technology
allows them to go beyond the speed of
light but when they&#39;re even hovering
somewhere over Earth they can be shifted
out of this Dimension into another and
then pop back and forth that&#39;s how they
look like they materialize and
dematerialize so that technology is
easily confused with and let&#39;s call it a
native ex extradimensional or being from
another dimension that&#39;s not an ET from
another planet because there&#39;s some
overlap in the
phenomenological uh way that they would
appear what you would see and exper
erience so then you have of course the
man-made completely man-made fake aliens
fake UFOs or man-made
UFOs and all of that gets thrown into
sort of a blender and gets mixed around
in people&#39;s heads as they first begin to
look into this so This cacophony and
confusion is completely
understandable it just has it it it
requires corrective knowledge and
information which is what we&#39;re trying
to do um but it&#39;s difficult because the
weight of the Zeitgeist out there let&#39;s
call it is all into the spooky stuff
that then commingles it with the uh
actual
extraterrestrial and if you don&#39;t know
to make the I always have used this
analogy let&#39;s I&#39;m a doctor so let&#39;s say
someone comes in with chest pain if you
think everyone appearing with chest pain
in my emergency department is having a
heart attack you&#39;re going to miss a
hundred other diagnosis alinary embolis
dissecting thoracic aneurysm puracy
pneumonia blah blah blah blah blah like
a whole list I could go on all day now
that&#39;s unfortunately what&#39;s going on
with this
subject and that&#39;s called a differential
diagnosis in other words you you have to
have enough knowledge of what the signs
and symptoms and findings would be for
any given uh
reality what it is in this case that&#39;s
not happened yet it&#39;s all clunked
together and there&#39;s no discernment
there&#39;s no pursing it out and that makes
it very easy then to Gaslight and
confuse people with scary
narratives where you can confuse the ET
issue and the let&#39;s call it the native
extraterrestrial craft and people with
the man-made ones that are staged with
the extradimensional interdimensional
phenomenon which is also very real by
the way absolutely real so that&#39;s that&#39;s
that&#39;s the biggest Crux of the confusion
that people like Mr Carlson or these
senators and congressmen run into and
then they throw their hands up and go we
don&#39;t know what to believe we don&#39;t know
who to believe and and it becomes very
difficult um at that point because you
have to spend a great deal of time to go
through the data and learn
basically a new paradigm of
understanding the cosmos uh dealing with
Dimensions other the worlds and the big
Paradigm Buster is what illegal secret
government programs have and this is
greatly underestimated by the UFO
subculture the media and Congress
whatever you think we humans have it&#39;s a
hundred times more
unbelievable uh and so that that creates
it own own problem because it means that
the ability to false flag hoax stage
things that to any reasonable person I&#39;m
saying reasonable person would believe
is alien or
extraterrestrial is quite welldeveloped
and that&#39;s unfortunately one of the the
big challenges of the disclosure effort
yeah well they have um I think you know
we&#39;ve talked about this before this idea
of dimensionality with different beings
and different you you know right like
whatever they are um the government I
mean this illegal Black Ops has has also
has that capability of De travel that
people would say oh no no no that can&#39;t
be real that sounds like myth or science
fiction but as you we all know this is
is real well I I I&#39;ve dealt with at
least three maybe four separate covert
technology teams that have had very high
voltage thidal donut-shaped systems that
at certain frequencies will bring into
this Dimension 3D some really scary
thing like a demon or something
terrifying From Another Dimension extra
dimensional it&#39;s not
extraterrestrial and so this gets into a
a very you know big problem where we
have a big catching up to do in our
basic understanding of the architecture
of the Cosmos what I call the new
cosmology and that&#39;s why in I believe
1990 or 91 I wrote a paper called uh e
ETS in the new cosmology that how do you
understand the ET uh phenomenon when
there are these other things going on
and how do you discern and make a
distinction now 30 some years later of
course most people haven&#39;t read that um
but it&#39;s it&#39;s and it&#39;s controversial uh
any new information is always
controversial which I accept that&#39;s fine
I don&#39;t have any problem with it but
we&#39;re we&#39;re really going to have to
focus on that more and more than people
would like to because this simplistic
naive everything that goes bump in the
night is an alien business is is you
know that&#39;s got to stop pretty quickly
now the best way for that to
happen again two
things open hearings where people have
knowledge of this are put under oath and
subpoena and they talk talk about it all
right and number
two um law enforcement going in and
seizing those assets that are being used
criminally and standing them down uh and
I&#39;ve said this before there needs to be
no everyone&#39;s been focused on the ndaa
and this bill and that bill that&#39;s great
and and I&#39;ve been there helping with
that and been suggesting I actually was
the first person to suggest to the
Senate intelligence committee people to
put this amnesty provision in back a
couple years ago uh and initially they
didn&#39;t want to they and if they did they
thought well we&#39;ll do 18 months and they
did six months but they didn&#39;t it didn&#39;t
come out of committee with between the
house and the Senate conference
committee but maybe it will next year
the point I&#39;m making is all of that
process uh has to go along with people
understand what it is that you&#39;re you&#39;re
trying to investigate which phenomenon
are you investigating and so that&#39;s
where it gets more and more and more
complicated uh for the members uh and uh
the only way to clarify would be to
bring forward people who number one have
dealt with both or one or the other
maybe one person dealt with the ET
another person dealt with the man-made
another person dealt with the stage
craft of of of staging the mutilations
and abductions uh who are who come
forward who are whistleblowers but then
the other part would would be for law
enforcement actually go in and seize
these assets uh because they&#39;re just
simply enforcing existing law you don&#39;t
have to pass a new law they&#39;re on the
books I mean there any number of laws
against abducting people torturing
people mutilating people&#39;s private
livestock uh kidnapping uh embezzlement
of government funds black illegal black
budget operations on and on and on so
you know there&#39;s dozens of felonies that
are already on the book so the Federal
and state and local governments for that
matter that are being violated so in
that sense you really what you really
need is a a three-prong approach and
this is what we&#39;re doing one
open hearings under subpoena in congress
not in a
ski now I&#39;m going to come back to this
in a minute remind me too about how
that&#39;s been messed up all right in the
last six months the second would be long
enforcement where they go in
and there&#39;s a knock on the door and it&#39;s
polite then it&#39;s not polite they come in
it is like a swap team uh that needs to
happen because otherwise you&#39;re not
going to be able to get these assets
under control but also to show them to
the Congress and the White House and the
public which is the intention of of the
law enforcement team that we&#39;ve been uh
having briefings with and giving them
the information they need uh from our
archive from the intelligence collection
we have
of 147 black sites that we&#39;ve collected
um now the other part of it is then the
third prong and there&#39;s I won&#39;t say who
it is because these are still in
negotiations there&#39;s a major major Law
Firm that sued one of the giant
corporations and won about two billion
dollars uh dragon slayers and they&#39;ve
approached well one of the partners saw
me in the airport LAX basically and
approached and said you know we had a
conversation and I talked about our
legal uh disclosure project effort and
uh this person offered the firms
resources to do this so that&#39;s something
in 2024 to look for we&#39;ll see how far
that goes because we have a number of
cases that can be opened uh and put
through federal court that would provide
another way you could go to Discovery if
there was a cooperating federal judge if
he&#39;s not corrupt would then allow for uh
side investigations
depositions
Discovery um and uh it would rock these
large corporate entities on their heels
because now we&#39;re talking much bigger
than a two billion dollar lawsuit you
know there&#39;s a lot of zeros after that
for what they&#39;ve done and what they&#39;ve
taken from the world and the people
these free energy devices all of it um
we have a the the the former chairman of
a major Fortune 100 company that&#39;s come
forward and and is admitted he has the
documents and the proof this company had
quote free energy that would save the
planet and eliminate poverty but he has
to be subpoenaed um so he could be
subpoenaed in Congress but you could
also do it through a private civilian
Suits series of Suits so that&#39;s the
third that&#39;s the third approach right
they want to be subed because doesn&#39;t
that uh kind of jump over their um ndas
in some way let&#39;s talk about that yeah
yeah their non-disclosure agreements
whether it&#39;s corporate or government
have already been
nullified um and luckily there&#39;s a man
I&#39;ve been working with for um about a
year who did not want to come forward
unless he spoke in a skiff top secret
secure compartment information facility
which is where you exchange top secret
code name level
information um and and I&#39;ve in those now
what what&#39;s interesting is that he&#39;s now
come around and understood it took
about nine months for him to get his to
really see the
proof that his non-disclosure agreement
is nullified because the operation he
was working under on this particular
issue was a criminal Enterprise not
overseen and approved by the Congress or
the president so now that he knows that
he&#39;s willing to come forward and be and
give testimony so for many of these men
and women it&#39;s a
process oh and you know you remember the
hearings this past summer when uh Mr
brush said oh I need to I can talk about
that it needs to be in a ski not true
that that and what I&#39;m telling now the
members of the House oversight committee
is that I&#39;m glad you were denied a skiff
because you should not be conducting
this business in a skiff this should be
in an open hearing on CP and on the news
networks there are we should
afford that Organization no cover of
National Security none unless they come
clean and become and rejoin the legal
processes that our constitution requires
so
remember in the 1990s between
1992 and
1998 I had met with enough senior people
at the Pentagon General
Admirals people in Congress Senators
congressmen White House people CI
directors Etc and it was made quite
clear to me that these projects were
being run without oversight and
supervision and therefore
unconstitutional and up to and including
threatening senior officials if they
made inquiries literally threatening
them so you can&#39;t behave like a mafia
illegal organization and then hide
behind the law law to enforce the
secrecy this what I just said here
everyone needs to transcribe it and
write it to their members of Congress
they cannot and should not afford that
effort the dignity and the stat stature
of a top secret clearance or any
clearance so this is why it needs to be
brought straight out the information now
javat the operational technology and
design so the things that fly that we
have those should be very secret and
people are going to hate when they hear
me say this the energy devices that
would run your house and car great uh
the things that fly at couple hundred
thousand miles per hour you do not want
an unstable country or a terrorist
organization to get that because in two
seconds they could deliver a weapon over
downtown LA or DC or New York or
whatever so there are legitimate
concerns but let&#39;s face it we all know
have thermonuclear weapons you can&#39;t go
to Ace Hardware and buy one um or build
one right so some of this needs to be
looked at in a more nuanced and I would
say mature way right now see that hasn&#39;t
happened yet the distinction
between the information and the
existence of these Technologies and
craft coming out versus the actual
Technologies the actual Technologies
need to be brought out in phases and the
first pH phase which is what we&#39;ve been
recommending for 30 years are the
devices that are zero point Quantum
vacuum whatever you want to call them
like we presented in the Lost Century
film that would put in uh a system for
the world that would eliminate
pollution and end CH stop the damage to
the environment but also eliminate
poverty in about 20 years so those can
come out a 100 years ago those should
have been out in the time of Nicola
Tesla I mean the real Tesla Technologies
not the current fake ones but so that is
something very very important to make
that distinction uh and I I say this
because I have to have sort of very
reason conversations with members of
Congress that I&#39;m meeting with but also
people in Special Forces law enforcement
I mean this is serious this is not you
know UFO Club Google it on the internet
I mean it&#39;s very serious responsibility
and I and I&#39;m very blunt about the fact
that not everything technological can
spill out in the first
period uh but the knowledge of their
existence needs to um and we certainly
can&#39;t keep covering up um the existence
of the
ET craft and people and targeting them
and destroying them but we also can&#39;t
keep the covert programs using illegally
clandestinely the man-made UFOs which
have been used in
horrific I mean murdering entire
villages in Africa and and and South
America and the CIA document that jock
Fila has where he
outlines uh you know in 1985 the CIA
document that said they were down in
Brazil and Argentina abducting uh
peasants quote unquote for their
psychological warfare value making it
look completely alien with man-made
alien looking craft and creatures
now that that is an official document
that we know exists because jacqu F and
a couple other people I know have it but
they haven&#39;t turned it over publicly yet
but that can be subpoena see so in a
court case or in the Congress knock
knock here&#39;s a subpoena you deliver
produce this document so we have
outlined all this it&#39;s a very complex I
I understand that in the New Year 2024
there will be more hearings and I trying
to get them
ready with the correct Witnesses teed up
but also the correct questions and
follow on questions and then most
importantly the the right approach the
wrong approach would we say we can hear
from about this openly but this we have
to go into a skiff no no no no close the
skiff that time&#39;s got to be over so the
only thing that when you&#39;re talking
about transparency and bringing this
knowledge out in in uh in open public
hearings rather than a ski your feel is
really the only thing that would be um
that would be appropriate to do an a ski
would be something that has to do with
electri rtics yeah the sort of uh very
Advanced Technologies how they&#39;re made
what their design is that could be used
as a weapon right right that&#39;s different
than the information a thermonuclear
device is a
weapon right
but but you know not everyone can
possess one you know you you know Rhode
Island can&#39;t build its own nuclear
weapon so it can fight off Boston or
something stupid right so I mean so the
truth of the matter is you know you know
I&#39;m being silly but I mean you have to
have some sort of reasonable uh criteria
but if you don&#39;t even know what what&#39;s
what in other words you&#39;re dealing right
now this is where the people who are in
the scene senior reachers of the
Aerospace and intelligence community
that are currently in those positions
who&#39;ve reached out they&#39;re very
frustrated with the slow pace of this in
Congress so it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s to be
determined TBD whether the the the the
legal approach we&#39;re going to take um in
a court case would bring this
information out before Congress would or
before law enforcement organizes and
says we&#39;ve sat around all we&#39;re going to
we have enough actionable intelligence
to move on these facilities and we&#39;re
going to move so those are three big
initiatives that we&#39;re heading up and
assisting with I&#39;m not of course I&#39;m not
law enforcement but when I was
approached by the director of the law
enforcement initiative in April if I
would help them because they had no
knowledge of where assets were I said
what do you want he said so we want
everything I said my friend that&#39;s going
to be a lot and they they&#39;re they&#39;re
getting
everything and then this lets me pivot
to something even more
current um you all heard that we have
the disclosure project intelligence
archive I think you can testify to the
fact when you were here for a couple of
weeks helping scan stuff in there&#39;s some
oh yes mindblowing stuff in
there
yeah I literally had to go outside and
take a couple deep breaths a couple of
times I mean this is going to be where
people do need to book but it needs to
come out yeah so um I&#39;m just giving this
as a a warning to people listening this
is going to come out early next year we
are spending four
$500,000 to move all electronic files
into digital and all documents and
testimony into digital that are now in a
customdesign searchable database with
major
categories um we&#39;ve been able to
compress the videos and the audio files
through a technology so instead of it
being 50 terabytes we can keep it under
a terabyte and by doing so we&#39;ll be able
to put it and host it so that we
wouldn&#39;t have to be spending enormous
amounts of money so the public could
access it because as you know this is a
big problem um you know is the cost of
that we don&#39;t have you know the
Rockefeller and Ford foundations and the
government are not supporting this this
is all our own effort but uh it will
then have an interface so if you look at
a database that would have all that
content you saw or some of it you
saw there would be an interface between
that database that&#39;s being custom built
to the worldwide web and what we need if
there&#39;s anyone who can do this in 30
days is a web site developer it&#39;d be
more like a landing page that we could
have that up and that would connect to
this system I&#39;m not an internet
technology guy but that would then give
free access to the entire archive to
eight billion people on the planet and I
will say this this is a rather bold
statement that dump of data and
information is the disclosure it is
everything it it&#39;s every site it&#39;s
hundreds of top secret
Witnesses uh
it&#39;s hundreds of thousands of pages of
government documents and transcripts of
testimony and technology and black
budget proof and it&#39;s you know 122 crash
retrievals and named to people and sites
and on and on and on and on and on
so it&#39;s not finished it we wanted it
finished by now but it&#39;s big project and
technically challenging in some ways I
won&#39;t get into the sausage making of
that nightmare but um it&#39;s a big
undertaking um so but it will be
available now the only thing that the
public won&#39;t see those of you who who uh
are curious are the redacted names of
people their their social security
numbers and and their email addresses if
they&#39;re a top secret witness or an
individual that doesn&#39;t want to be known
by the public but has wanted us to have
the information so this is a little bit
like the chadam house rules at at secret
meetings know shadam House of the think
tank in London or in the UK where you
can site the information someone shares
but not the name of the person so my
ethics is that if someone has said I
want you to have this information I
don&#39;t mind if the world has it but I
don&#39;t want my name out there because I&#39;m
scared of for my family or I don&#39;t want
a bunch of UFO coups being in my door
down or whatever it is so I honor those
requests so that is the redacted now the
full
unredacted which is very sensitive and
very top secret that is being provided
to the the key investigators the law
enforcement and the senior people in
Congress all of it no nothing&#39;s held
back so that&#39;s look forward to that and
now we hope I had hoped we would have
the whole thing out um December 1st
looks like it may be more later in the
winter the big hang-up is going to be
who can build this landing page website
for us quickly like in the next 30 days
and um the team that&#39;s been working on
the database are not web developers but
they can get someone so there&#39;s a bit of
a cur fuffle with that that&#39;s that&#39;s the
it&#39;s like we&#39;re at the 99 yard line we
need one more yard to carry it across
otherwise the public will have no portal
right you need to have a portal into
this thing
right anyway so and and I don&#39;t know the
first thing about making a website and
we don&#39;t have anyone on team who does
nobody knows how to build a website um
so if someone&#39;s expert at that and can
do it quickly and either for free or
reasonably let us know like uh three
months
ago you know there are people out there
who know how to do this and once they
hear this I think you&#39;ll have a lot of
hands coming up so um hope we&#39;ll see
yeah we&#39;ll see we&#39;ll see um okay so one
other thing I want to ask ask you about
with Carlson he he believes that there
is a spiritual he has mentioned that he
believes that there and he&#39;s not the
only one obviously there are many people
who speak about this this topic and this
subject that understand that there some
understand some don&#39;t that there is a
spiritual
component um that is involved with with
these beings and with contact
experiences and going forward can you
speak I don&#39;t know anyone else in the
world who can speak about this with the
expertise and knowledge that you have so
can you speak about that a little bit
for us sure I mean it&#39;s and again it&#39;s
it sort of recapitulates what we started
with
there&#39;s I tell this funny story back in
the 90s being at the Vatican with
monsenor balduchi who is a uh Theologian
senior Theologian to Pope John Paul
and he was actually a
demonologist
interestingly and of course not my cup
all that but I mean you know we had a
very long
interview and he said the
extraterrestrials are neither demons nor
angels however they&#39;re not hostile and
they&#39;re so Advanced that they could be
confused with
angels um on the other hand the
extradimensional
uh phenomenon would be more like the
demons and those get conflated all the
time with extraterrestrial and the
man-made atrocities being done the look
alien definitely look like a negative
entity from somewhere so you have all of
that happening now he emphatically said
because then he had access at the
Vatican all the way to the pope and you
know he introduced me to the Vatican uh
astronomer
everything and and so he understood the
cosmology quite well and knew the
difference between an angel a demon an
ET and something that would be concocted
out of the Skunk Works or or what have
you uh cover program but that is a very
Advanced understanding but so
spiritually the
um the the ET the actual let&#39;s call it
native ET real
extraterrestrial um all of them were so
Advanced that that they would appear to
be you know unimaginable in their
evolution and there is a deep spiritual
component to it simply because once a
civilization has free energy and
abundance and it&#39;s no longer fighting
over a scrap of land here and a piece of
gold there the whole civilization pivots
towards the development of their
spiritual higher States Of Consciousness
and so they&#39;re very interested in humans
and that component and that&#39;s why the
Close Encounters of the fifth kind the
C5 contact if you get the app C5 contact
you&#39;ll see it&#39;s very rooted in this
understanding of Consciousness
universality and how that operates
through not only making contact but also
Advanced
Technologies extraterrestrial technology
seamlessly interface with Consciousness
field and thought and so that part of it
when people encounter it without an
understanding of
non-locality of the physics of
entanglement of the physics of the
entanglement of Consciousness and
thought and omnipresence of
Consciousness all those Concepts it&#39;s
going to be very confusing because and
and you&#39;re going to then also
conflate some of the
Extraterrestrial phenomenon and and and
experiences people have with something
from an Angelic realm because some of
them you have entire planets out there
that on the level of Consciousness they
are basically evolved to the level of a
very higher level of Consciousness and
so they would present as these very
enlightened Spiritual Beings even if
they have a body in a spacecraft from a
star system in the Andromeda galaxy so
this gets where you have to have this
comprehensive
assessment uh and overview that
integrates what&#39;s normally very separate
things that never get put together and
that&#39;s science spirituality religion uh
Consciousness studies and advanced
physics The Cutting Edge of of
entanglement and Ai and all of this so
that&#39;s something that requires a deep
study and understanding of this in order
not to be
completely discombobulated and Confused
and so he&#39;s quite right that there is a
spiritual component but again which is
it is it actually a spiritual
being man-made phenomenon an
extraterrestrial Advanced civilization
whose Consciousness might be on parody
with a Celestial level of Consciousness
all of that has to be understood and
then that goes into your analysis
whenever you encounter a phenomenon a
case an encounter what is it is it X Y
or Z or something else so again without
that sort of knowledge and study
everyone&#39;s going to be hopelessly
confused unfortunately uh and this is
not that difficult I think we can
articulate that is briefly as I just did
I agree um but it it needs to be
discussed but it makes people
uncomfortable because if you&#39;re a
scientist you&#39;re not comfortable with
that if you&#39;re a theologian you&#39;re not
conversant with science if you&#39;re
a policy academic or you know political
person that all of that is just
completely foreign mostly to th to those
folks so we kind of have to create a
common ground for all that and so and
that&#39;s what we&#39;ve tried to do because as
you know we have these three big
foundations of what we&#39;re doing the
disclosure project the C5 contact with
development of higher Consciousness and
then the the the uh technology ology the
effort to bring out these Z Point free
Technologies those are the three big
projects that that we&#39;ve been moving
forward over the last 30 years so I
think that&#39;s why that knowledge you know
it says in the the vas in the ancient
betas in India uh knowledge is the
greatest purifier if you have the
knowledge it clarifies and purifies this
understanding if you don&#39;t it&#39;s very
easy to mix it all together in this
uh mixer bowl of stuff um and that&#39;s
what we we need to try to bring Clarity
to hopefully the archive will also have
a C5 part of
it um and uh eventually right now it&#39;s
dealing mostly with the nuts and bolts
and the documents and the witnesses and
the sites and all that but there&#39;s a
great deal as you know that the public
has never seen on the C5 experience
right uh I mean there&#39;s enormous photos
videos accounts
testimonies
um and that that would be included you
know eventually it&#39;s too bad also that
we can&#39;t come up with some kind of
common language and terminology because
each one of these groups that you have
mentioned physicists the Academia um the
public scientists they all use different
terminology and some of the terminology
is so above the heads of the common
person right that they it&#39;s they their
eyes start to Glass over and you realize
unless there is unless people start
speaking in simpler terms right simple
terms that everyone can understand we
leave so many behind and then people get
confused well if people look at my books
i&#39; I&#39;ve created a lexicon and
descriptions that do that you have uh
very much so and I&#39;m aware this a
problem I was a meditation teacher
before I was a medical doctor so I
understand how you have to create a
Common Language but then if you&#39;re going
to use use a term you describe it all
right uh and and you you define it and
this is important words do matter and
and words are a reflection of the
thought which is a reflection of the
Consciousness and meaning behind it and
so that is important and these are all
things that are going to get more and
more defined as this goes
forward the the problem is I think the
timeline&#39;s getting very short I&#39;m not
trying to sound ominous I don&#39;t think
there&#39;s 30 more years or 80 more years
to fool around as things have been going
um for one thing the Betrayal of the
ETS by our cobbert illegal secret
government is not going to be allowed to
go on much for longer and if we don&#39;t
fix it there are forces out there in
space that will which is a worst case
scenario I want to repeat it it&#39;s a
worst case scenario everyone asks why
don&#39;t the ET just come and fix all this
I oh no you don&#39;t want that under any
circumstances um so we need to take the
lead humans who understand this need to
take the lead um and and to do that we
need to have certain segments of society
get up to speed very quickly which is
one of the reasons for this disclosure
project intelligence archive being
online and everyone&#39;s seeing it because
there it is I mean you know and uh is
going to be a lot of it&#39;s going to be
very shocking to the public very very it
is if I if I can be shocked and I&#39;ve
been involved in this for years I can
tell you that it definitely will be a
buckle up uh Journey it&#39;s why I haven&#39;t
released a lot of it it&#39;s disturbing
know um the things that these covert
programs have done um the murders uh the
testimony of so many of these
whistleblowers that no one has ever seen
um you know and remember in the archive
you&#39;re going to see the redacted not the
people who come forward that have given
us permission to use their name but the
other 650 the names are redacted but
there&#39;ll be a little blur but in a file
of what they&#39;ve written and what notes
we&#39;ve made about what they&#39;ve shared
right now I know who all those people
are all 755 of
them all right that are in that list and
you&#39;ll see the list um you&#39;ll also see
all the black sites the map and the
sites as well as now the big job now I
just want to warn everyone this archive
is going to be kind of raw data right
that&#39;s searchable it&#39;s a database what I
still have to create is to
triage so let&#39;s say you have I don&#39;t
know 200,000 pages of government
documents no one&#39;s going to read 200,000
pages of government documents what what
we need to do is triage the most
important to the least right that takes
time same thing for the crash retrieval
cases same thing for the witnesses that
there there are more important witnesses
that dealt over a period of time
directly and there are others who just
had an incidental encounter like the
pilots who encountered the Tic Tac right
that&#39;s just a chance encounter versus
someone who was read in and worked in an
underground base so the Witnesses
themselves have to be triaged and then
the crash retrieval cases as well as the
major cases and the radar CA all of
these
categories have to be and that has not
started yet right all right just warning
everyone I&#39;m warning I&#39;m I&#39;m a doctor
who always gives full information I
don&#39;t hide information I don&#39;t tell you
nonsense so it&#39;s going to be put out
there at that stage now the bigger part
of it after that&#39;s done
is what I call the briefing
modules how do you make okay and we&#39;re
going to do something heads up everyone
get on a list contact Pat we&#39;re going to
have a select number maybe 20 people at
our Retreat Center this winter where all
we&#39;re going to do is go through all this
deep deep stuff and I&#39;m going to create
the archive modules and what those
briefings are is connecting the dots
across all categories of the most
important cases that then reach the
intelligence assessment so these would
be th these would be the most important
things in the archive and they&#39;re not
even created yet I&#39;ve got to create
those uh but we&#39;re going to have a week
event to to bring in more of that we
already have a few law enforcement and
Special Forces people ask me to
create some critical ones and those will
be in there
but redacted heavily because it&#39;s
extremely
sensitive and frankly scare the crap out
of everyone who read them but um frankly
U but but you know it needs to be done
otherwise you have all these huge amount
of data that no one&#39;s going to be able
to sift through without an assessment
that connects all those dots but that is
that&#39;s it the connecting of the dots and
really only I don&#39;t know anyone else who
can do that but you to really succinctly
connect those dots for people because
that is where the real understanding of
this information right so it visualize
this you open the archive there would be
the categories and then there would be
sort of a introductory briefing analysis
that would connect all the dots within
that and triaged but also connecting to
other categories with a hot link so
where it&#39;s all interconnected so that in
intricacy and that analysis and that
work hasn&#39;t started
but we want the public to have the raw
data we&#39;ve been rushing to get that and
also I need to get it in this form so
that the investigators with the Senate
intelligence and armed services and the
house oversight committee would have uh
a tool so look at look at what we&#39;re
doing with this dpia the disclosure
project intelligence archive would be
like Wikipedia for all things UFO
related passive
and we&#39;re we&#39;re we&#39;re inviting other
people to submit more material we don&#39;t
pretend that we have everything on
planet Earth by any means but what we do
have you&#39;ll have access to um which no
one in the world has ever seen except a
few people who&#39; crawled through my
archive here at our place but um so
that&#39;ll be an exciting uh development
it&#39;s an ongoing project really um so in
uh next month we&#39;re going to launch a
crowdfunding uh site
for the disclosure project intelligence
archive uh we&#39;re going to set the
initial goal around
500,000 it may have to go up I mean the
expenses of the programmers and the
hosting all that is it&#39;s exorbitant
frankly so to do it we&#39;re going to need
continuing support and resources or we&#39;d
have to shut the website down um just
like Wikipedia ask for donation and
stuff we can&#39;t you can&#39;t do this unless
you have someone either underwriting all
the costs or you have to put a pay wall
up where people pay a monthly fee which
I don&#39;t want to do so everyone listening
if you want all this stuff for free you
need to help us because there are no
free lunches we I mean we&#39;re not I&#39;m a
retired doctor we don&#39;t have the ability
to just underwrite hundreds of thousands
of dollars in ongoing expenses for
something like this out of what you know
right so that that that&#39;s something
we&#39;re going to need help from everyone
who actually wants to see this available
to every man woman and child on planet
Earth really of course the more people
who use the archive the more expensive
it&#39;ll be because you get build from the
cloud you know the hosting of all this
and the the usage so this is all
something we&#39;re looking at we&#39;re hoping
our my
aspiration uh this is my New Year&#39;s
resolution is to find a way to get all
this out in front of the people early in
20124 for free where there&#39;s no pay wall
you know it be like getting on our
YouTube channel you just look at it
except in this case it&#39;s everything it&#39;s
this enormous amount of material so we
hope people will support that effort
when you hear from us sign up for at our
uh website uh which should be linked
here so we can uh you know send you
information about this crowdfunding uh
and if you want to join us at our
retreat center it&#39;s probably going to be
later in February uh for this week um it
will be hunkered down in the mountains
of Virginia near the Omni Homestead
beautiful area um and um not great for
going out at night that time of year but
we&#39;re going to be focused on this uh and
at least we have a hot tub
but under the stars at night you can do
that if the temperature is 101 degrees
yeah yeah oh and the Jefferson Thomas
Jefferson&#39;s Hot Springs are two minutes
from that so those are amazing but I I
hope that what we can do is that as as
early 2024 comes out have this site
available in it&#39;s kind of raw data form
then keep him improving and adding to it
with these modules and triage but also
uh
create a more and more information we&#39;re
going to be asking the public uh you
know maybe your grandfather and when he
passed away you found top secret
documents or whatever or as a new
witness comes forward or a photograph or
someone who&#39;s been in a new site we
don&#39;t know about so as information comes
in that we will solicit from the public
we will look at those vet it see if it&#39;s
legit and then include it right right so
that it&#39;s going to be a growing look at
this as a living breathing growing body
of intelligence that&#39;s not at the CIA or
in an underground Vault or a skiff Vault
but available to the whole public how do
you think this will impact people on the
hill you think they&#39;ll read this do you
think this will
Enlighten a huge number of them
the big problem with members and look
I&#39;m I&#39;m this way you know me if someone
sends me a five-page thing I turn it
over to my assistant say turn into three
sentences I don&#39;t have time all right so
I understand how busy they are and I
understand that if you&#39;re an executive
or Senator or whatever you know you
can&#39;t drag you can&#39;t go spend thousands
of hours going through this this is why
curating the triage and and rank
ordering Which documents which cases are
most important and creating these
briefing modules that tie it together
that they would be able to that would
make it more usable and for the public
and journalists I&#39;ve had some big
mainstream journalists contact me and
say we&#39;d like to have access to that but
even for that they&#39;re not GNA be able to
spend thousands of hours going through
all that content and making sense of it
right so you know it&#39;s it&#39;s going to be
a process that&#39;s going to be a very
heavy lift on my part frankly to to do
that because that phase of it isn&#39;t
scanning and programming and putting in
categories um but it has to be done but
that&#39;s going to be arduous task that&#39;s
coming up in 2024 but as we do it and
we&#39;ll just keep adding modules so what
we don&#39;t want to do is delay for a year
or two longer access by the world but
I&#39;m just warning people it&#39;s not going
to it&#39;s going to be searchable but there
are a lot of refinements still going to
have to happen and we need your help
with that I mean we&#39;re going to need
funding help and all kinds of
help pretty exciting stuff Dr Greer
pretty ex I mean this is going to be
like a master&#39;s or a doctorate course in
uh the history
of people ofs and contact really for the
world well there Planet there&#39;s huge
sections on it thousands of pages on the
Technologies and patents and devices and
uh all kinds of material I mean people&#39;s
eyes are going to just you
know you don&#39;t have enough life years
left in most people&#39;s life to go through
it all which is why however if you say I
want to know every whatever is in this
archive about right Patterson Air Force
Base you&#39;ll be able to go right
Patterson Air Force Base and it will
aggregate across all categories and the
whole archive everything whether it&#39;s a
whistleblower test Tony a document a
schematic a crash retrieval case that
was taken there it would all go
populated Isn&#39;t that cool this is and
you know the information um I was amazed
at the breadth of uh the time span of
this information this isn&#39;t just the
last 30 years that you&#39;ve been working
on this some of this stuff goes back to
I mean over a hundred years ago you&#39;ve
got documents there that go way back
this is gives a complete and utter
history in magnifying glass of some of
these uh things really some of these
subjects there&#39;s a whole file on uh that
we got from someone whose grandmother
had been at Los Alamos with the first
atomic bomb and then at Roswell when
that happened and when they were
cleaning out her things out of a book
fell a photograph of a extraterrestrial
body being dissected on a table in the
1920s that apparently were brought in
from a prior
acquisition of an ET uh so that when
Roswell happened they would have some
comparative Anatomy um and that&#39;s going
to be in there I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s the
enormous amount of material that most
people on earth have never conceived
exist but part of it also
is I I think that we&#39;re at a point where
all this is going to come out and there
needs to be a source that has curated
legitimate material since there&#39;s so
much not legitimate material
right and uh and I am getting older Ian
I&#39;m 68 you know I could drop dead
tomorrow um I could be killed tomorrow
so I mean I kind of feel like uh I won&#39;t
say who it is but a man whose whose
grandfather was an extremely famous
artist who was good friends with
Picasso he had he had created this
archive for his
father and for his grandfather who was
already dead and all his junk was
scattered all over the four corners of
the Earth
and it took him forever and I said well
I don&#39;t want that to happen so he
brought up to me in 2016 he says who&#39;s
your archist how do where&#39;s your I said
I remember I remember it&#39;s in a bunch of
boxes and scattered all over and so
Sandy it was good that he said that to
me because it sort of triggered that
that should be done and then when the
Senate intelligence committee folks and
the house oversight and other and the
the military office for the White House
Hall approached me in the last two or
three years I thought we really need to
do this I mean otherwise it&#39;s it&#39;s been
exhausting and expensive and sort of a
very complex task but um once it&#39;s done
it it it will be available to everybody
including the investigators in Congress
and law
enforcement I remember being in a in a
carg going out to Joshua Tre we were
going out one night to do a C5 with a
group of 30 people maybe it was the Demi
Levato I believe it was the Demi Levato
trip it was yeah it was and you said
I&#39;ve got all this stuff in my in my
seller and all this stuff needs to there
needs to be an archive of this and I was
like how much is in there and you were
like 40 50 boxes and I was
like I mean the idea just yeah it&#39;s way
more than that it just seemed um like an
overwhelming job but I mean it was clear
that you were say
this needs to get done well let me be
blonde as we wrap up this is the
disclosure there won&#39;t be a hearing or
anything out of the US government that
will have more content than this the
only thing that would have more
definitive proof evidence and content
would be if the government the secret
government programs capitulate and
release it or the law enforcement seizes
it and releases it short of that this
absolutely will be the largest
disclosure in history on the subject so
the disclosure you&#39;re all asking for
we&#39;re about to drop that to the public
yeah definitely a buckle up moment but I
can&#39;t wait and I&#39;m so happy that this
got done and thank you Dr Greer I mean
the world does not realize you
know it is such an enormous job that you
have undertaken for all these years and
I&#39;ve before you know you definitely have
job security I don&#39;t know that anybody
else wanted your job really no they
don&#39;t I try to I&#39;m I try to give it away
yeah oh trust me I would love to be able
to step off this stage I mean everyone
thinks that I this is something that&#39;s
some hobby you know it&#39;s this Blood
Sweat and Tears as you know so this is
right probably one of the most important
things that&#39;s really been done for the
civilization Yeah well yeah and it&#39;s
it&#39;s it&#39;s going to be my goal is that if
if everyone contributes so we can keep
it free which I hope we can and continue
to expand it improve it it&#39;s just going
to be this Snowball Effect of disclosure
through a openly available site um yeah
right and somebody asked recently they
said I think they maybe an asked you
when did you think that when was the
last time that you thought something was
really this transparent happened and and
really actually to me for this country
it actually was back in 1776 was the
last time anything Act
yeah a big a big as it&#39;s a revolution
but a peace a peaceful one we hope and
um so peace in the new year and
hopefully we get our act together as a
species and make a peaceful contact
initiative our goal always has been to
disclose the information and get the
world Community to make peaceful contact
with these civilizations instead of
mismanaging it through the myopia
of of of secret military programs uh
that is that was the mistake you know as
you know when I was with Senator Barry
Goldwater uh before he passed away and
you know he ran for president as a
republican in the 60s against lynon
Johnson and he had found out about this
issue but was denied access and
threatened um and when I was in his
living room in Paradise Valley in
Scottdale some years ago you know said
you know this is his language not mine
it was a goddamn mistake then and a
godamn mistake now this was ever handled
this way and kept secret and so it it
allowed an enormous problem to develop
that just has become a huge crisis uh
and people don&#39;t know that most people
don&#39;t realize the crisis it&#39;s created
I.E climate change poverty pollution
oceans dying people go what&#39;s that got
to do with extraterrestrials I said
because the
technologies that are behind how those
things move but then you add into it the
other problem and that is we&#39;re about to
push through a red line in outer space
targeting these
craft and I think their patience has a
limit I think these civilizations from
other star systems they&#39;re not going to
let us take that too much further
before that our capability is stopped
but they&#39;re stopping that capabil
they know would be terrible because it
would be spun by the media and by the uh
UFOs community and and the
military-industrial complex as Alien
Invasion right so they people always ask
me very smart people why don&#39;t they just
land and fix this I said because it
would a they&#39;d be blown out of the sky
with these EMP scaler weapons and B it
would be portrayed by the Spin meisters
and as Alien Invasion week on the
History Channel it would be Independence
Day right like that movie with Will
Smith so they&#39;re caught between a rock
and a hard place the ETS need good
humans to fix this this is our planet we
need to fix it and if we get this to a
certain level where it&#39;s fixed there&#39;ll
be open contact beginning to evolve uh
that would be peaceful and the
technologies that can be used for
peaceful purposes and not weapons can
come out be a whole new it&#39; be a new
world and it&#39;s like the ET yeah it&#39;s
what the ET said to Colonel Corso when
you know that craft landed out at Whit
Sands and and and the ET asked him to
help stop these tracking and targeting
them and Colonel Corso you know he said
what&#39;s in it for me and the ET said a
new world if you can take
it so that was
1956 you do the
math you know IM time it&#39;s time right
it&#39;s time just imagine what we could
learn from them about Consciousness oh
everything though I mean the universe
Consciousness Technologies healing you
know yeah oh yeah I mean it&#39;s
just we&#39;re we&#39;re really living you know
half a step out of the jungle as a
civilization because of all these
wondrous and incredible technologies
that have been withheld from humanity
and so the the peace dividend let&#39;s call
it of bringing this out and doing it
peacefully and then making peaceful
contact uh would would completely
transform our civilization in 20 years
you wouldn&#39;t recognize it from today you
would not recognize it well I hope I
hope well here&#39;s to that we raise a
glass and a toast to that on New Year&#39;s
Eve yep and also um this will be this
will be available for people on the 31st
right this will be yes
yes okay on New Year&#39;s Eve so happy New
Year happy New Year thank
you thank you for very years of work
also thank you you&#39;re welcome you&#39;re an
angel thanks thank you bye bye
