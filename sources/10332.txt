  I had quadruple bypass surgery.  Two days after the operation, I was doing well. The walks with my physician assistant were doing better than the medical team had hoped. 

  At 2 o'clock in the morning, I bent over to pull up my left sock and coded. I woke up three days later and did not know I had died.  A few days after that, my son came to visit and told me what had happened.  He is an emergency room nurse. He told me that I was without a heartbeat for 6 minutes. It took the staff two hours to stabilize me because my heart beat wasn't 'consistent with life.' 

    I remember being in a room.  I could not feel my shoulders or neck and realized that I did not have a body. I was an orb on a table and my face was like a round ball. In front of me was a man with black hair. He was dressed in a white, dress shirt with a long, black tie,  and black pants accented with  a gold, belt buckle. He looked at me for a few minutes and then said, 'You're not ready.' He used his right hand to pushed me back into my body.

     Days after I woke up from the medically induced coma, I never knew I had died. I was very emotional and still have a hard time controlling my emotions. I talked with the physician assistant a little about about my experience and asked her when they moved me to that other room. She told me that I never left this room. I started to argue with her, but she stopped me and told me that we would talk about it later.  She also referred to my experience as a gift. 
  
    I also had another odd experience two days later.  A woman appeared in my room around 3 o'clock in the morning.  She introduced herself as, 'Victoria from the patient's advocate department. She wanted to ask me a few questions. I was afraid of her because something wasn't right. She sensed my fear and started to leave. She told me that to find my answer, I needed to look to the Lord. As she turned to the door to leave, she said, 'Everything will be all right.' Then she was gone. 

    A few hours later, it was time to draw my blood as customary every morning at 4 a.m. I asked the lady about the woman who came to visit me earlier this morning.  She told me that she would check the video recordings for last night, but she was sure nobody came into my room last night. Then she returned to my room 30 minutes later.  She apologized because the my blood draws were mislabeled and she would have to draw them again.  

    Around 5 a.m. my physician assistant came in and asked me, 'Who came to visit you last night?' I told her all about what happened earlier in the morning.  She told me she had gone over the tapes and nobody entered my room other than the lady at 4 a.m. Then she said, 'Someone up there loves you!' Then she explained why I needed a second draw of blood. My kidneys and liver were not working.  The doctors had given orders on how they wanted to to restart them, but the kidneys were only functioning at 40% and my liver was up to 60%. Yet, this morning the liver and kidneys were both at 100%. The medical staff thought my draws were mixed up with somebody else, hence the need for a second blood draw. 

    Then the physician assistant asked me to describe what the woman who came in at 3 o'clock was wearing. She reminded me that nobody could enter my room unless cleared by her.  She told me that nobody had signed up to see me at that time.

Experience Description 9282 Shared 10/2021 - 10 weeks after the experience:   

    On August 1, 2021, at 2:00am, I reached down to pull up my left sock because it was under my heel and I coded. I was out for 4 minutes.  The nurse was in the other room with her patient when she noticed my heart rate had dropped to 30 bpm. She ran to my room, followed by a second nurse who also heard the alarm going off. They threw me on the bed and started CPR. After the first 2 minutes, they gave me Epinephrine to start my heart. And they continued with the second round of CPR.  After 4 minutes, they had a heartbeat.  I came back from where I was because I heard a man tell me that 'I was not ready' and sent me back.  

    The medical staff had to use the pacemaker that was put behind my heart during the operation if July 29th. They worked on me until I stabilized, which may have been around 4:20 am. Around 5am they called wife to tell her what had happened and how I was doing.
