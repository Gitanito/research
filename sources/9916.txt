  		              		Experience Description   

    My mother witnessed a two-day period of agony watching my 7 year- old daughter Elżbieta (Elizabeth) die. This was back in 1949 when her  appendix had ruptured. She had no medical help in the hospital; she didn't get any  drugs such as pain medicatoin or  antibiotics. While Elizabeth was  running a fever and suffering from infection, she told my mom what she was seeing. She described herself as being in  a great beautiful garden that was  in a meadow full of flowers and plants. It was so beautiful. A man, who radiated light and who was dressed in a white  gown/robe,  was smiling at her and calling her to come closer. She was running towards him, full of joy at the sight of those unearthly views of paradise.   She was happy, but also noticed her mom. Elisabeth  warned mom that she could not go to this place yet because  she had to stay among the living. 
 
    I was born three years later and my mum told me that story over and over. I was brought up with that narrative of a heavenly future. I was brought up by my mum and could pray to my guardian angel at the age of 7. I used to go to church sometimes. I didn’t know any other stories about God, just the fact that HE IS THERE.
