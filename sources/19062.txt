so when you were talking about this
this knowledge I guess my question to
you is do you subscribe to any kind of
idea like Illuminati you know curtailing
this and there&#39;s any type of negative
kind of et presence within to that model
where it&#39;s kind of been keeping it like
a prison planet
well the question is is in terms of the
information being kept secret is there
some Illuminati type entity or perhaps
even et presence keeping it secret
I doubt it in the way that it&#39;s the
mythology the internet mythology would
say it is I think it has more to do with
the fact that there are lists they call
cartels interest groups that are also
competing interest groups human not BT
that don&#39;t want certain aspects of this
out and there are points where they
cooperate in their points where they
don&#39;t now there&#39;s something that the
latest iteration of it I&#39;ve been told
for my so my intelligence sources is
called sig SI G which is the senior
interagency Intelligence Group and the
sig which you know from the old majesty
and majestic entity from the Truman era
and some of the documents I have it says
magic in mage AIC classification those
are you know intelligence groups that
operate out of normal chain of command
they work with people in different
countries and then they will usually
have representation from different
interest groups such as religious
technological financial macroeconomic
etc and so on and so there&#39;s not a
there&#39;s a really a simplistic view that
they&#39;re sort of like one group it&#39;s the
Bilderbergers it&#39;s the Illuminati
it&#39;s too this is it it was interesting
because I a few years ago I was at a
meeting in San Francisco and it was
after the disclosure project launched
and Henry Dakin who the Dakin toy
company was hosting a sort of a
reception at his loft and in San
Francisco and Judis Koch was there who
was the original publisher of the Course
in Miracles worth marrying worth and
very big supporter and her husband as a
colonel and she was friends with this
man who had just been up at the Bohemian
Grove with the whole Bohemian Grove over
like 2500 people and this issue came up
and the issue of there was a very
wealthy European feenin seer and so this
issue came up about disclosure because
they&#39;d all been in the news and they had
someone there to get up on the stage and
tell everyone that they were part of a
high very high governmental scientific
entity that it looked into this the none
of it was true that it was all just miss
interpretations and you know swamp gas
and Venus rising or whatever the usual
blather and all those 2500 people took
it to heart and believed it because it
was their peerage so I want to talk
about peer to peer containment systems
so you have one group of peerage called
the US Senate out of those hundred guys
one or two people are read into or know
about this subject their task is to lie
to the other 99 or 98 Bilderbergers
there might be a handful of them they
lie to the rest Bohemian Grove same
thing so people have this very
simplistic view of how secrecy like this
would be maintained and that there&#39;s
some sort of vast sort of conspiracy and
there&#39;d be all these people because of
compartmentalization there would be
people and compart
is where you have you know a very walled
off area of operation where it&#39;s
compartment it to that particular task
or research and it is so narrowly
focused and the people in there have
such blinders they don&#39;t know what the
person the next cubicle is doing
nevermind what the big picture is so
it&#39;s very easy when you have extreme
compartmentalization to keep most people
in the dark about what&#39;s really going on
and then there&#39;ll be a handful of people
who really know and they may you know
this committee if you want to look at it
that way this intelligence group might
have two or three hundred people from
different countries who are themselves
members of different elite groups and
those folks would then lie to their
brethren in that peerage to deceive them
and that&#39;s their job and they&#39;re trained
professionally to lie so it isn&#39;t as if
it so mostly I would say 99.99999% of
everything I&#39;ve ever seen that&#39;s out
there on this trash dump called the
internet isn&#39;t has any has almost no
bearing in reality because it&#39;s just too
imbecilic it would not be operating that
way now for a special compartment it you
know top-secret ESS CI top-secret
special compartment intelligence to
operate is the compartment part it&#39;s not
the top-secret part there nine hundred
eighty thousand people in the United
States with top-secret clearances which
means they&#39;re communists dirt
it&#39;s the compartment your end all right
so you may have Q clearance what used to
be the king of clearance for nuclear
weapons and stuff but doesn&#39;t mean that
just cause you have Q clearance you have
clearance into electromagnetic wave it
expect you almost certainly would not so
and the same thing goes in for corporate
same thing goes for I it was interesting
I was at the San Francisco
at another time and there was a woman
who lived in Pacific Heights the end of
Broadway where all the 100
million-dollar mansions you know the
Getty home and Larry Ellison all these
people live and she was hosting her
neighbors for a salon and I was the
guest for this dinner party and you know
I mean there were all these people and
the guy won&#39;t one side of me had been
the chairman of SSRI Stanford Research
International and they had had contracts
dealing with this issue but he said I
was only the chairman of SSRI so I
didn&#39;t have a need to know what was
really going on
so because my I&#39;ve never been in the
government but I have all these hundreds
of people who provided information from
all these different walks of life over
the last 50 years in terms of
experienced people going all the way
back to the 50s 60 years that sort of I
just sort of become sort of a source for
that so he was a picking my brain here
was the chairman of SSRI and then across
the table was the chairman of AT&amp;T now
AT&amp;T has had a lot of contracts with the
intelligence community dealing with this
issue but the chairman of atnt didn&#39;t
know about it because he was only the
chairman of a tea he was not read into
so it&#39;s compartmented at corporate
governmental political and religious
levels and it&#39;s not so simple that you
do it be some one entity you can name
and then you know sort of vent your
spleen that group is now the question of
whether there are interstellar
civilizations that are cooperating or
facilitating that I&#39;m very skeptical of
but it could be theoretically possible
that in the early days they were hoping
that there would be some kind of
rapprochement with leaders military or
political and have had head contact an
ongoing level of that is less likely but
if it is if it is happening then we need
a ce-5 effort even more here&#39;s what I
always say to people let&#39;s say that
there are they say now 11
star systems in the Milky Way that have
earth-like planets around them and the
Milky Way shows only one of billions of
galaxies the likelihood is that there
are countless numbers of civilizations
out there and you can&#39;t prove a negative
I can&#39;t say every one is at a state of
enlightenment I will say that if they&#39;re
become interstellar and they haven&#39;t
blown themselves up yet they&#39;re more
evolved than we are
however it could be that there are some
that have interests and ethical concerns
that don&#39;t comport with contemporary
human ones but that&#39;s where you would
need to have even more of a diplomatic
communicative effort and the worst thing
you can do is relegate that to people in
covert military operations because
they&#39;re only looking at the universe
with rose-colored military glasses on
and it&#39;s all about power and control and
so you know it&#39;s sort of like when there
used to be a US Senator from Virginia
named John Warner not the current Mark
Warner no relation and he had been
chairman of Armed Services and Intel
various things and I knew he was
involved with majestic majesty and MJ
magic and he had been one of the
secretaries of Navy way back I believe
are under secretary of the Navy and one
of his a member of my team who had dated
him for a while went out at his place in
Virginia met with him and brought this
whole issue up and he basically listened
to her and said nothing stone-faced and
where she left off the previous
conversation to that exact word he
picked it up and continued and just that
issue was just sequestered out he would
not acknowledge it at all and my my one
of my military advisers had the same
experience with
animal Harry train who did the exact
same thing when it was brought up though
except he also said he said I am
profoundly disinterested in discussing
this issue with you and dropped it okay
and that was the same Admiral who was at
Atlantic command when we went to full
code zebra cause of these craft off the
coast of eastern coast of the United
States so I think that you know they&#39;re
very very disciplined about that and I
bet with a number of these sort of
characters and and yet you have other
people like Senator Claiborne Pell who
the Pell grants anyone who was really
poor like I was who got a Pell Grant to
go to college I was at a dinner party
with him I fed my wife and I were we
were there and for noetic Sciences
Institute and at through the dinner
party we went out on on the patio of
this beautiful home in San Rafael near
George Lucas&#39;s place right next to the
Skywalker Ranch gym and we were there
and and Senator Pell and I were talking
and he just sort of epitomized noblesse
oblige and was this wonderful guy
very very genuine across the aisle tried
to do great things for the country
patrician very grit and we were talking
and you know and he turned to me he says
dr. Greer would you comment and brief my
staff on this and I said well sure any
time you want me to he says because
we&#39;ve asked about this and no one&#39;s ever
told us anything and he&#39;s been on every
committee and and ice and I was looking
at him and I looked up at the stars and
I looked at him and I said you know
you&#39;ve been deprived of dealing with the
ultimate foreign relations issue and
you&#39;re the chairman of the Foreign
Relations Committee and I pointed to the
stars above my head and he looked at me
through those you know horn rimmed
glasses and blanked he says well dr.
grim afraid you might be right
I said well I am
and it was really a poignant but really
in a said funny but sad moment the
here&#39;s this guy you know been in
Congress or the Senate since the 50s
they&#39;ve been denied any information on
this who would have been a great
interstellar diplomat and instead the
wise the enlightened the peace-loving
people who should have been handling
this that shoved to the side relegated
to the scrap heap of history and the war
mongers and the control freaks and the
misanthropic money I have a few
other adjectives I&#39;ll leave off kind of
took it over which is what happens
Eisenhower famously said beware the
military-industrial complex he was
specifically talking about the fact he
lost control over this and other issues
in nineteen fifty cents went 56 when
Nelson Rockefeller the Rockefeller
Commission Lawrence&#39;s brother Nelson
Rockefeller reorganized the Department
of Defense and CIA under the Rockefeller
Commission in 1956
so no president since 1956 hazop has had
even if they&#39;ve known about the issue
they have not had operational control
over these projects so it&#39;s been an
unconstitutional off the rails for the
last almost 60 years
