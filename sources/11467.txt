I became disassociated with input from the persons and equipment used to work on me.  I saw a shimmering portal-like wreath, which enlarged and shrank in size.  I knew I could reach through, and I did.  It was welcoming and enticing.  My grandfather was visible through the hole and he wanted to take me fishing.  I reached through and stepped halfway in, then withdrew as my children entered my thoughts.  I told my grandfather no and he said 'but Kevin, I even have worms today.' This meant the best bait possible for our favorite fishing spot.  

Suddenly, the shimmery port was gone and I was awake. This happened again 2 days later, but I already knew if I went through the hole in the shimmery thing I could not come back.
