  About the Author
  
  Nahu, a nationally recognized psychic,   has been an ardent student of Fortean phenomena, the Paranormal, UFOs and the   nature of reality for over thirty years. In the early sixties, he developed   unusual psychic abilities following an out-of-body projection into a vortex of   pure light. Subsequently, this experience changed the course of his life,   directing him to the path of Psychic Guide through the Maya of the 3-d Realm.   This entails using clairvoyance to help others recognize subconscious   limitations hidden in individual perspective. Among his many psychic skills is   the ability to see into and recognize health problems within the internal   organs. --This text refers   to the     Paperback   edition.  

        Trail-Blazing Journey into the Mind of God!, December 20, 2006
      Reviewer: Ronald E. Purser &quot;Ronald Purser, Ph.D. Professor of Management, San   Francisco State University&quot; (San Bruno, CA United States) 
  
  UFO s: God From Inner Space is an original and   first-person exploration of this cultural and physical phenomena that has up   until now, either perplexed scientists, theologians, psychologists, or has been   shrouded in mystery or folklore. Nahu, a gifted clairvoyant in his own right,   provides a unique perspective on UFO s derived from his   own profound and transformative personal encounter, as well as through years of   painstaking analyses of other accounts of close encounters. Unlike many other   books which focus on the &quot;nuts and bolts&quot; paradigm of trying to &quot;prove&quot; the   existence of UFO s, Nahu takes the reader deep into the   depths of our personal and collective psyches, exploring how   UFO s defy the laws of our three dimensional space-time reality, and   beckon us to awaken to our true source--&quot;pure mind.&quot; Be prepared for a journey   and psychic adventure that weaves together research from such disparate fields   as quantum physics, chaos theory, depth psychology, Eastern philosophy,   parapsychology, sacred geometry, and religious history, along with visionary   insights into the holographic nature of consciousness based on the &quot;Spiral   Template&quot; principle. For Nahu, UFO s are just the tip   of the iceberg; the real import of his ideas point to the deeper realities of  UFO s as imprints of the Mind of God.     </p>  Unlike many faddish or cultish books on UFO s,   Nahu attempts to understand UFO s by reexamining   documented cases and reinterpreting archival data from a transformation of   consciousness perspective. Nahu uncovers many hidden and overlooked aspects of   the UFO  experience that are missed by conventional   &quot;nuts and bolts&quot; investigators. Original insights and new theoretical visions of   reality abound in this book. The nature of time, the construction of our   personal and collective reality through the &quot;observation principle,&quot;   understanding the dynamics of individual perspective, the connection between   Near Death Experiences, Out-of-Body Experiences, the symbolic nature of Light in   spiritual transformation, and UFO s are explored in   great depth. All this, according to Nahu, is pointing to the   HOLOVERSAL SELF  - an awakened mind that is fully aware of its   multidimensional nature--and open to the interpenetrating realities of wholes in   the parts.

Explaining in explicate detail how UFO s can be   understood as an inter-dimensional phenomena, this book takes up where Carl Jung   left off. In short, Nahu presents a &quot;grand unified theory of   UFO s&quot; that unites objective and subjective realities, and links insights   into the underlying energetic structures of UFO s to   the divinity of our own minds.

This book is relevant not just to UFO    enthusiasts, but to depth psychologists, open-minded physicists, those   interested in the paranormal, and anyone committed to personal and collective   transformation of consciousness.
