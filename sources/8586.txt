  		I saw something   		like a fantasy, I looked behind and I saw the lamb of the street and I   		was going to it very quickly.&nbsp; I entered the car quickly, then the story   		began, I felt that I am so tall, with no weight, out of control. I saw   		everything of my past life, since my birth. I saw it as if I watch it,   		then everything disappeared. I was walking, but the step in a width of   		10 steps.&nbsp; When I turn my face to left or right, I see persons; some of   		them observing me, the other were looking at me as if they are waiting   		something from me.&nbsp; Others looking at each other, I saw many people whom   		I mistreated them or hurt them, they were looking at me as if they want   		to take revenge.&nbsp; Then I stopped without my wish, as if there is a sign   		of compulsory (STOP), though there is a long road or other world in   		front of me.

  		In a   		moment, I saw myself leave my body.&nbsp; I was floating up near the ceiling   		in the room, when I saw the doctors put electric shocks on my chest   		(DC).&nbsp; I saw the doctor, who was my brother&#65533;s friend, crying and hugged   		my brother out of the operation room.&nbsp; My brother didn&#65533;t cry, and told   		his friend&nbsp; that &quot;my brother would not die.&quot;&nbsp; He began to pray. I saw   		then all the officials at the local    		council  		   		came to the hospital to console my brother.&nbsp; I saw the   		father of the doctor brought a picture of Alkhidir -peace be upon him,   		he brought it from the Bethlehem church.&nbsp; As he was working there, I   		feel myself returned to my body, I felt the pain started with me, I also   		saw all my past life since my breast feeding till now.

I   		had car accident, when the car is turned upside down, during this I   		remembered everything with all the details and very accurately, since my   		birth till the time of accident and I remembered all the people I knew,   		even the ones whom I met once or twice, I remembered all the events, the   		important and non-important ones when my age is less than a year, I   		remembered it with all its details, it past was in front of me and I saw   		it as a cinema show in just 15 minutes, and when I got out of the car I   		was in full consciousness, I felt that I wasn&#65533;t in the car or in other   		means I was exist and not exist, a feeling that is difficult to   		describe, I felt that there is a something to protect people.

  		I was drifting in and out   		of consciousness during this time, and I could feel my spirit actually   		leaving my body.&nbsp; I saw and heard the conversations between my husband   		and the doctors taking place outside my room, about 40 feet away down a   		hallway. I was later able to verify this conversation to my shocked   		husband.&nbsp; Then I actually &quot;crossed over&quot; to another dimension, where I   		was engulfed in a total feeling of love.&nbsp; I also experienced extreme   		clarity of why I had the cancer, why I had come into this life in the   		first place, what role everyone in my family played in my life in the   		grand scheme of things, and generally how life works.&nbsp; The clarity and   		understanding I obtained in this state is almost indescribable.&nbsp; Words   		seem to limit the experience &#65533; I was at a place where I understood how   		much more there is than what we are able to conceive in our   		3-dimensional world.&nbsp; I realized what a gift life was, and that I was   		surrounded by loving spiritual beings, who were always around me even   		when I did not know it.

  		I c ould   		see the letters written on the roof tiles from very near almost few   		inches. Each letter appeared very big to me. It was a wonderful,   		painless state and very cool and yet full of emotions. I had perfect   		crystal clear consciousness.&nbsp; I could see my body lying on the floor   		head down and still holding the wire. I rose to about 10 feet off the   		ground and I stopped hovering near the roof tiles. I was calling for   		help but no one was there. After some time I noticed my dad coming from   		other end of the house and I could see him through the walls and he was   		coming very slowly as he was not aware of the accident.

My   		breathing had stopped, blood pressure was 0x0, and still I could hear   		the doctors discussing what had happened. And then within a fraction of   		a second I traveled millions of miles and reached an area of the Light.   		The traveling was in the fourth dimension, which can be termed as out of   		body experience, when an unidentified identity merged in &#65533;that Light&#65533;.   		Words fail me as I try to describe exactly what I saw or felt. But I can   		say that there was no humanized God, all the same, it was an area of   		unalloyed purity. There was brilliant Light, immense speed or Motion and   		unbelievable Divine Love. I did not require senses to experience &#65533;IT&#65533;.   		&#65533;I&#65533; was absent and still I saw, knew and understood. Though I was there   		for a few seconds, it felt like an eternity. My concept of time and   		distance changed considerably, as I had traveled immeasurably long   		distance in a trillionth of a second and what seemed like an eternity   		was eternal sacredness condensed in our concept of time.

  		Suddenly I realized I was dead! My God! I   		have brought my young kids &amp; and family and have left them in a strange   		place without any protection financially or otherwise! Visibility was   		not clear. Everything was misty. But it was as though I could see   		without vision, hear without sound. I was in another Dimension of   		Existence. I could hear the laments of women below &amp; the hushed   		conversation. One thought became prominent in me. How absurd Life is! In   		the morning the body would be cremated. Is this all to life. What a   		meaningless end to a chain of boundless wonders &amp; potential   		opportunities. It is like bubble floating on a sea. Then what is death?   		An entrance to another dimension? I was calmly &amp; objectively thinking   		while my brain &amp; body were lying below! &amp; as though I was not the person   		affected by death. Evolution endows matter with higher &amp; higher levels   		of consciousness &amp; death seems to snatch it. While brooding I became   		aware of a presence. In a speechless communication IT informed me that I   		could re-enter the body if I so desired. But no time should be lost.   		However at that critical moment I pleaded for an answer to the riddle of   		Life as that thought had fully engrossed me! There was a beautiful   		vision of stars roaring past me. At the centre of all that tumult was a   		glowing light. Each star appeared to be a minute centre of   		consciousness. It was merging into &amp; emerging from the central   		consciousness as desired by that cosmic WILL which shone like a very   		huge sun!

  		During that time, that i was   		watching my own body, i distinctly remember feeling joy, at not being   		the one hurt, complete disorientation from my own body, did not   		recognize my own body, identified myself as being the one, watching the   		other body lying on the ground. I did not feel any pain, or feeling,   		apart from feeling happy, at not being hurt.

  		Account shared   		by a friend of the NDEr:   		My friend, then in her   		twenties, had been very ill and was in the ICU when she collapsed. &nbsp;She   		says that she suddenly found herself going down a black tunnel. That   		experience felt 'interesting' because she said she kept observing what   		was going on. Today, in her forties (which is now, when she told me) she   		is (alas) unable to recall whatever it was that was going on.&nbsp; She   		reached the end of the tunnel where she found a tall/big dark man   		standing with a lantern. He saw her and said, &quot;No, no. Not you. Its   		another Sheila (I am using a pseudonym here), that I am waiting for.&quot;   		There was no further conversation, nor did she see anybody else.&nbsp; That   		was it, the next thing she knew she was awake.

At   		that moment I could no longer feel that I 'had' a body anymore but   		somehow I was conscious of my surroundings. In those moments of fear, I   		did sort of feel a presence by my right side, sort of comforting me   		through the process, as slowly I felt as if I was being lifted or   		carried away. What my body now felt like was that I was just a 'cold   		mist', it felt as if my hands, legs didn't even exist. &nbsp;That feeling of   		floating upwards and away could only be equivalent to diving into a   		swimming pool and laying on the bottom and letting yourself float   		upwards...accept the water is freezing cold that your whole body goes   		numb.&nbsp;For a few seconds, I saw myself from above, lying on the floor, I   		saw uncle Muharram on my left and my dad on my right, my mother near the   		sofa looking worried, but I kept on floating upwards and away. For a   		brief second I saw the roof-top of my house. I saw the housing area   		where I lived from above, and as I got higher I could see some night   		clouds in the sky. I felt sad leaving my parents and my family...of   		leaving this world as I knew that I might never come back.

Meantime, I saw my uncle, who died one   		month ago, while passing me he said &#65533;not yet&#65533;.&nbsp; I was surprised how I   		understood him without spoken words, but I felt very peaceful.&nbsp;Later&nbsp; a   		lady came to me, if I see her now, I would recognize her.&nbsp; She took me   		to a wonderful place with mountains and said that this was the place of   		my life.&nbsp; The place we went was beautiful, but I said to her that this   		place is not my life&#65533;s place.&nbsp; Then we came to a sea shore with a little   		village and she said again that this place was my life, but I don&#65533;t know   		this place and I said to her that this is not the place of my life.&nbsp;   		After we travelled some more very beautiful places she said that I was   		not ready to stay in these places and asked me what I remember about my   		life.

  		  		Finally I surrendered.&nbsp; I knew that something strange was   		going on with me. Suddenly, I looked into the street, but I didn&#65533;t find   		the street&nbsp; or anything of the surroundings because everything   		disappeared.&nbsp; All the life around me looked like a tube.&nbsp; I was   		surprised to find myself feelinglessly going towards the tube to a hole   		which seemed as if it is a gate of that tube.&nbsp; In this moment, I heard   		the voice of my child calling me. I turned my face. I saw myself sitting   		in the chair and my head is down on my chest.&nbsp; My 2 children were trying   		to wake me up while they are weeping. I felt a bit sorry and bit   		sadness.&nbsp; I knew that I had died.&nbsp; I didn&#65533;t feel afraid, but the   		opposite. I felt a kind of relief I hadn&#65533;t experience in all my life.&nbsp; I   		had the strange feeling that I now know all the sciences and human   		knowledge as medicine and engineering and chemistry.&nbsp; When I reached the   		end of the tube, I saw my dead father and my cousin in their full   		appearance.&nbsp; They were smiling to me and pointed to me to go towards   		them.&nbsp; They were standing in a brilliant lighted circle at the end of   		the tube.&nbsp; I felt a strong willingness to join them, especially to my   		father who died years before. </span>

  		The next thing I remember was saying &quot;I cannot breathe...&quot; And then   		darkness. I was high above my body looking down when I next became   		aware. There were people around me. I did not care to return and turned   		around. At this time, I seemed so light and happy and could actually   		look down at the Sphinx&nbsp; below! I then saw another level of existence   		opening up, sort of like the scene from the movie &quot;Ghost&quot;. There were   		many beings who had come to meet me.( I was astounded when I saw &quot;Ghost&quot;   		after I returned to the states...it was really like that!) I was told   		that I could either come or go back, but that I would suffer great pain   		if I did. I remember making a choice, as I thought there was something   		else I needed to accomplish in this life. &nbsp;I became aware of being in a   		van, and the film crew crying and calling out my name. The producer was   		gently slapping my face and trying to communicate with me. I was trying   		to open my eyes or move my hand but found that I could not do either,   		but I could hear them crying. (I have a sense of humor and remember   		thinking &quot;the brain is just like a computer...it is down...&quot;) I then   		went into a comfort zone of soft darkness and remained there. I wondered   		if this was the state of death, it was so peaceful and womblike. Then I   		heard the doctor say: &quot;She has suffered a severe concussion. We do not   		know if she will live through the night.&quot; </span>

I immediately found   		myself, simultaneously thinking and responding, &quot;Ready to die?&quot; &quot;Why   		must I die?&quot;&nbsp; I was very scared.&nbsp; Immediately the &quot;Voice&quot; replied, &quot;You   		must die, because you have failed to do what you promised us that you   		would do.&quot;&nbsp; I was even more mystified, confused and unbelievably   		afraid.&nbsp; I responded, begging for my life, &quot;I don't remember what I   		promised, I don't know why I must die, please give me another chance, I   		don't remember what I promised to do.&quot;&nbsp; The VOICE answered me by stating   		the following: &quot;You promised us that you would help others.&nbsp; You have   		failed to do this.&quot; </span>

  		While I was   		eating food with my mother and friend.&nbsp; It got into my respiratory   		tract.&nbsp;    		  		Then I couldn't take air inside.&nbsp; I fell down. struggling for air.&nbsp; I   		felt parting with my body &amp; going upwards. I am now seeing a tunnel with   		light on other end someone is pulling me upwards. When I look around the   		surrounding is very bright. Then I can't see anything because of light.   		I have a strong desire to get into my body. Because my mother is crying   		for me. I can hear her crying from very down. Then suddenly I gasped   		some air with all my efforts.&nbsp; The food is moved out of the tract.&nbsp;   		Suddenly I get the feeling of inside the body. </span>
