  		              		Experience Description   

    I was scheduled for my tonsils and adenoids to be removed. I was wheeled into surgery.  I was sleepy from the shot given beforehand. I remember being so out of it and then they placed a mask over my mouth, but only half covering it. They told me to count backwards from 10 which I think I made it to 7 and was out. 

  The next thing I knew, I was sitting up and looked at the tile on the wall.  It  was white and bordered with black tile. There was a clock on the wall. The  the second hand dial was the type that sweeped rather than clicked. I hopped off the bed from the right side and walked around the foot of the bed. I saw the nurses and doctors huddled around the bed. I never heard anything or paid too much attention at who was in the bed. I walked out of the room, through the door, and turned right into a waiting area.  I saw my mom looking worried and my Dad was looking at a magazine. There was an end table between them with a green lamp between them. I stood there and heard my mom say to my Dad, 'Something is wrong.' My Dad looked up at my mom. She said, 'Something's wrong with Jack. I am going to see what's going on.' My Dad closed the magazine and placed it on the table. My mom got up and walked from my right to left as she passed me. I walked on her right side and a few steps behind. She went to the nurse's desk to the left. I knew she was asking the nurse something but I continued walking. I  took a left to another hallway and all was black again. 

  I woke up in the recovery room. About a year later, my mom told me that I had died on the table and be careful in the future because I don't take anesthesia well.
