you
I&#39;m a graduate of Parks College started
in the Air Force at wright-patterson and
was in the Air Force for two years in
state an additional six years working in
research and then I returned the
McDonnell Douglas and stayed there for
thirty years and finally ended up at
Parkes College again as a endowed chair
and McDonnell Douglas what was your work
there I would have involved a lot of
high speed work hypersonics we worked on
things that flew from Mach 4 to mark 12
he had some airplanes that flew Mach 12
all the way around the world and just
for the benefit of people can you just
explain what you with the mock-mock-mock
numbers how many faster than the speed
of sound you are so literally a Mach 12
airplane flies about 12,000 feet per
second or about 14,000 miles an hour and
if it could fly away around the world
almost built it
one of the more interesting nights I had
was one of the things I did of course
when you lieutenant in the Air Force is
you get the wonderful assignments like
your office the assistant assistant
office or the day one night I was the
assistant to the head office or the day
over at Patterson field and we had 151
phone calls come in of objects flying
down interstate well at that time u.s.
40 then turning at Columbus and going up
to Detroit and these were state
policemen some doctors that were up late
at night all kinds of people that
reported seeing as we had radar tracks
on them had airliners calling that they
had seen them very very interesting and
each one had called in I had to run over
to FTD and take the thing over and if I
didn&#39;t get back in time and the poor
colonel got awoken by the next call I
get balled out but that was a very
interesting night and these guys there
were not you know people who weren&#39;t
used to seeing evidentiary sights and
things like that I mean they were very
clear descriptors of what they saw
probably more than half of my career
that was in projects that were
classified or compartmentalized can you
describe how that process works well
generally you have to get depending on
the level of the compartmentalization
and the secrecy level you have to go
through a fairly significant background
check it takes between six months to a
year to get the background checks and
then when you do that
then you generally if you&#39;re in a very
tight compartment then you have to sign
a statement that you will not divulge
the existence of the project or even
answer a question that could divulge the
existence of the project and it&#39;s on it
it&#39;s not an even on a need-to-know basis
it&#39;s on a basis of people being
identified specifically to know what
you&#39;re working on and directly
associated with the
object so it&#39;s very closely contained
material if you have a covert project
the funding would come through a number
of government sources none of which
would be identified to the workers
whatever higher level you know people
were involved in it even they might know
might not know where the funding came
it&#39;s just that you sign a contract with
the US government and the funding would
show up at the right place at the right
time if there were if there was non non
earth bound sources of the information
you would at least that the people that
were doing a design work or doing
analysis work would never have any idea
of where it came from all you would have
to do is visit Russia to see how they
did it they would compartmentalize every
project into what I used to call silos
and it would have a colonel or a colonel
general sitting on top of that and
literally they could not talk to anyone
outside of that silo and if someone else
needed help one person would be sent
over to another place sit down at a desk
look at a piece of paper say yes I know
what that problem is here&#39;s the answer
to it and walk away he would not even
know what it was that he was working on
there&#39;s giant triangles that appear over
Palmdale that move very slow so they may
be different triangles from so they have
these the ones that I&#39;ve heard about
have this glow around them and they
they&#39;re very large and very slow-moving
so that&#39;s different I think than the
ones that appear all over Belgium and at
that are very fast moving the ones that
are peered over Belgium that move very
quickly in a few seconds no you can&#39;t
explain that unconventional physics just
like if you use can by conventional
physics
I mean engines and jet engines and
rocket motors and propulsion systems as
as we know them today you put fuel in
you burn something and it produces
thrust and it accelerates an object in
in that context no and in the cadet kind
of physics you cannot explain
any hardly any human beings living long
enough to go much much beyond the edge
of us of our little solar system because
it takes almost 13 years to get to the
outer edge where the keeper belt is and
some of the outer outer things that are
going around with with Pluto and Charon
and those things so that&#39;s 26 years
roundtrip so you got even out to the
edge of the heliosphere where the edge
of the sun&#39;s interaction is with the
with free space that&#39;s three light years
away and that would take a hundred 150
years so in the conventional terms no
you can&#39;t explain it it has to be if the
physics that have to explain that are
quantum physics in which things can
appear to be almost two places at the
same time and appear and reappear just
like positrons and electrons do in in
some of the high-energy particle
colliders it&#39;s probably not anything
pushing it through the air it&#39;s it&#39;s a
it&#39;s a coupling of the device with the
energy that&#39;s permeate space probably
Tesla was as close to it when he said
that if given the right energy system
the right or the right electromagnetic
spectrum I can power a human base on
Mars from Earth without any loss of
energy in the end in quantum physics and
zero-point energy that&#39;s a possibility
but literally Sakharov and the number of
people that were working on it I think
are very very convincing arguments that
the fabric of space is like an ocean and
energy ocean in which solid energy is
floating on it and solid energy is the
mass and if that&#39;s true then gravity
waves of exists and in fact everything
goes back to heavy sides equation
and it&#39;s waves not particles and the
quantum is now not mass but time and if
that&#39;s true then there&#39;s a whole
different you look at the whole universe
and a different light and then a lot of
things become possible that we think
impossible within our current
understanding of what time and space and
thrust and force know what is if they
come from the other part of the universe
if there are crafts that travel galaxies
on the average are 10 million light
years away and even our galaxy is about
a hundred thousand light years across
all of the conventional thrust and force
mechanisms that we conceive of just
won&#39;t work in terms of human time frames
that&#39;s the only explanation I can get is
that that if they if people are here
from another civilization
then they if they&#39;ve understood the the
higher the higher the finer points of
quantum of quantum physics and how to
couple that from particles into beings
that can do what quantum what particles
can do now
when I was at wright-patterson we had
the flying saucers it went up
I think they covered the distance from
Columbus to Detroit in something like
equivalent of about 20,000 miles an hour
I don&#39;t think anyone in the canoe in the
ordinary aerospace business would have
had any knowledge of what they were even
talking about if you mentioned quantum
physics or or wormholes are the type of
things we know now because if you went
to CERN and talked to the particle
physicists they would tell you certainly
some of this was possible because they
see it all the time where they think
they see mass they really see they
really see energy frozen in it in a time
quantum and what they&#39;re seeing is not
is this is really a frozen bundle of
energy and it moves back and forth
almost without any restriction
I thought there were enough credible
stories that I may not be able to
explain them but they weren&#39;t phenomenon
that were people&#39;s imagination whatever
they saw was real but I couldn&#39;t explain
how it how it was real what made it real
but I think what they I think they saw
what they saw near st. Louis there was a
fairly large triangular object seen and
it covered the distance down to south
st. Louis in some in some of its
sightings it was moving relatively
benign Lee but then it it literally
jumped about 20 miles in a sec couple of
seconds and I&#39;ve received a lot of phone
calls from the local newspapers and TV
stations is how can that be and I said I
don&#39;t know how it can be except if you
explain it through something like a
quantum physics explanation of time and
space relationships it gave you time and
space travel but other than that I don&#39;t
there&#39;s no way I know that I can put the
biggest rocket engine I could think of
on it it still couldn&#39;t get there at
that speed and the noise and the sounds
you would make doing something like that
would wake everybody up for 10 miles and
it made no sound at all
it&#39;s see it starts out at hover and it
literally almost disappears and pops
over here so it&#39;s not like it&#39;s not like
a cartoon where it goes whoosh it&#39;s
almost like it disappears and comes up
over here at least that the descriptions
that some of the police officers gave to
it a lot of combat pilots routinely go
up to 7 and 8 GS but that&#39;s a very
specific direction that&#39;s from your head
downward along the axis of your spine if
you were to take that what&#39;s called
eyeballs in which is when you accelerate
the forces this way you literally would
have your eyeballs and compressed out of
their sockets and you have brain damage
so that the G&#39;s the do that might be in
the level of order of
so no that&#39;s not physically possible for
any even even insects to take that level
of acceleration even over a short period
of time you might get in an automobile
accident you might get a hundred two
hundred and fifty G&#39;s and that&#39;s when
the car is completely crushed so that&#39;s
what happened would happen to a human
being if that were a conventional force
accelerator so it&#39;s not a conventional
force accelerator because if there&#39;s
people in human beings in them or
something being in them that isn&#39;t
crushed then it has to be a different
way of doing it the hard part is to find
a way to physically do that you know
there are people who have been
experimenting with zero-point energy or
try to tap zero-point energy for years
every once in a while someone will do it
accidentally they&#39;ll call it cold fusion
but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s cold fusion I
just think it&#39;s a zero-point energy tap
except for three people that I know no
one has been able to control it when it
happens
it happens for a short period of time
and it&#39;s almost always destructive it&#39;s
like drilling a hole into the base of
Grand Coulee Dam and all of a sudden
this jet of water comes out that
literally has enough pressure to cut you
in half without a valve on it you can&#39;t
shut it off does one guy that that that
a friend of mine actually visited in Ann
Arbor Michigan that was I consider a
mathematical genius that actually
figured out a way to control it
he was so paranoid he divorced his wife
left his wife and children and went in
hiding
because he was terrified that someone
would would kill him for the knowledge
that he had the ability to tap this
whenever he chose to and control it we
don&#39;t know worried we haven&#39;t seen him
in five years I don&#39;t worry is you know
right now today you&#39;ve got an energy
problem with the price of oil what do
you think would happen if you introduced
an ability to attempt zero-point energy
represents about 40 to 50 megawatts of
power per cubic inch of space
that&#39;s a lot of power
that&#39;s 4600 million watts of power and
if you could tap it at will then no one
would have to sell gasoline or oil
anymore you would just tap into it it
would be it would be like taking and
going out to the Great Lakes and taking
out one drop and using it it would you&#39;d
hardly miss it and since it permeates
the whole universe and it continually
fluctuates as it as as that as the
matter and antimatter interact it&#39;s not
like it&#39;s a steady lake it&#39;s um you see
it&#39;s a pool the size of the universe so
you&#39;d never for what we&#39;ve used before
you never even miss it the only thing
this one guy claimed that happened is if
you bottle it and move it to another
location and release it he sounded
exactly like mr. Spock he said you
create a tear in the in the time time
domain of the of local space and
actually caused a problem which he
claims he did and he will never do it
again which is bottle and move it the
other part is that you&#39;re knock it
doesn&#39;t work on conventional jet engines
one has to create an actual zero point
energy engine to do that this one guy in
Ann Arbor Mich
Michigan had one running in his basement
not connected to any power source
whatsoever sitting in the middle of a
table and it had been running for a year
yeah the ones I&#39;ve seen
not that they&#39;re theirs there they might
be able to make up an engine that would
drive an automobile or they might make a
motor that would drive a pump for a well
in Africa somewhere or a generator to
power the village but none of them would
have to have even those the inkling of
how you would build a 300 the size of a
football field and make it move at the
speeds that that apparently moved
I shouldn&#39;t speak zactly that the wrong
word would appear to be changing and
location of in very rapid times because
conventionally we think of this as
speeding through space but what if it
really acts like a like some of the high
energy particles at CERN they really
transfer into energy and reappear over
here and there was no mass that went
anywhere because all mass is is solid
energy and if you find a way to move
back and forth with that the
conventional wisdom is that a complex
organic structure like us cannot
transfer back and forth from energy to
solid but that&#39;s because we&#39;ve never
seen it done what you represent is a
solid energy now what you you see you
think you&#39;re solid right in fact the
distance between the atoms in your body
are almost exactly relatively
proportional the same distance as the
planets around the Sun so in fact if you
were to take if you could if you could
look at your individual atoms you would
be 98% space the if we if you if we if
you were the equivalent a neutron star
which is only only the the nucleus and
the electrons compressed your you would
fit on the point of a pen so when you
really get down to what you&#39;re made out
of it the total electronic the total
state of you is on the point of a pen
james s mcdonnell actually had an
institute to study paranormal psychology
he&#39;s it that&#39;s why his airplanes were
named banshee and phantom he was he was
an Irishman who was very interscope and
very much interested in in the in the in
the spiritual world on the para and the
paranormal and he had part of his
research department
working with a foundation he had to
study the paranormal and the great Randy
the magician infiltrated his
organization and actually for about a
six months did sleight of hand
experiments to get him tied to this that
there was something really there and
that he discredit him the head of the
research department would not even talk
about anything related to this fact the
guy in Ann Arbor that had the zero-point
energy machine actually came to
McDonnell Douglas he and a couple of his
partners came in they were going to talk
about this funny hydrogen motor that
they had and I got invited to the
meeting and about halfway through it I
just said guys you&#39;ve got a zero-point
energy machine why don&#39;t you and admit
it and the head of the research
department who is who he thinks quote
was discredited would put off when they
did Randy did this he had the guards
come in and escort them off the planet
off the plant because he was just so
terrified of this he thought it was
pseudoscience and I said it&#39;s not
pseudoscience it&#39;s just beyond what we
know right now but anyway Randy would
always say I can&#39;t measure it and what I
would say is I&#39;m going to give him a
ruler and I&#39;m going to say now I want
you to measure the diameter of an atom
or I want you to measure I want you to
measure how was the distance between
quarks and the answer is well that
device can&#39;t isn&#39;t useful for doing that
so when he talks about radio instruments
and electrodes and probes and says well
I can&#39;t measure anything anything Paris
I call it Paris psychological he may not
know what is parapsychology how do you
measure it the only people that I know
that have come close are the Russians
and their parapsychology Institute&#39;s
most of which are all now defunct but
they had some very interesting twins
that they were doing experiments with
that they could find ways
they were they were measuring something
was occurring between the two of the two
of them in their brain so they could
actually know what the other one was
thinking and it&#39;s utterly amazing as to
the spectrum of electromagnetics that
are going on inside the brain the
Russians have done a lot with what&#39;s
called scalar waves and different
spectrum electromagnetics with within
the brain and they&#39;re convinced that you
could explain parapsychology if you
could ever find out what it is that you
have to measure to prove that it&#39;s
occurring but they are only they just
got to the edge of perhaps measuring
something but they really quite weren&#39;t
sure what to do or how to do it it&#39;s all
based on physics but maybe you haven&#39;t
got maybe it is scalar waves if it&#39;s
scalar waves then you&#39;re in a whole
nother avenue of physics which are very
controversial Tesla was very very much
into those the difficulty with Tesla is
that when he passed away J Edgar Hoover
came in and confiscated almost
everything that when his made this one
has made discovered him him dead she
didn&#39;t discover him dead she discovered
five FBI agents in his room pilfering
everything and he was laying on the bed
dead his nephew sued the US government
and won back theoretically all of his
equipment experiments and records there
were theoretically 50 boxes he got 45 of
those in Belgrade the other five were
missing and a whole bunch of stuff is
missing one of the guys did an
experiment that he did in New Jersey
which was build a half grounded antenna
a very unusual different configuration
everyone said it wouldn&#39;t work but in
1934 he met one of Tesla&#39;s assistants
who you work with him in New Jersey and
he says oh well you&#39;re hooking up wrong
here you hook it up like this so in a
rainstorm in Massachusetts they hooked a
little
ten watt receiver transmitter up and the
other guy went fifty miles away on the
other side of a mountain in a rainstorm
they held a conversation over that
antenna system without any noise static
or anything else on it we also found a
record of a submarine that was in the
Mediterranean in 1917 1918 number L and
Tesla in New Jersey put one of these
antennas in the ocean right off the
coast and on the shore and he&#39;s holding
a conversation with the captain of the
submarine and one of the guys actually
dug out of the Navy records the log of
the submarine and it essentially says
some idiot who&#39;s claiming his in New
Jersey talking to me must be absolutely
crazy because I know I&#39;m a hundred feet
underwater and no one can be talking to
me from New Jersey and he had the
matching language in his records in his
logbook Tesla&#39;s logbook so what was that
you know people say oh if it was an
accident it was a coincidence that was
an inversion of the what layer over here
you know there are a lot of things we
can&#39;t explain that are going that people
have actually done back when I was a
young young engineer at McDonald in the
60s we routinely designed for the Air
Force and the Navy airplanes of fluid
like four and a half and six the the
Vietnam War interfered with most of that
but we had running engines that would
fly Mach 6 easily
we actually had tested engines that
would fly them with the Mach 12
airplanes in fact in 1966 a fellow by
the name of Bill Escher he&#39;s still alive
working for Si Si and si I see in
Huntsville he had on a test stand an
engine that was not we can&#39;t fly at Mach
8 in a wind tunnel but we can duplicate
the pressure and temperature that the
engine would see if it were attached to
an inlet which is what he did
and he actually ran an engine that got
within 5% of predicted performance of a
airstream that duplicated Mach 8
conditions at about a hundred and twenty
thousand feet and it ran for about
twenty minutes that was all the air
supply had 1966 and we were convinced we
could build them then what&#39;s fascinating
is I got to see the x-33 a couple weeks
ago and they had this new breakthrough
of this new shingle technology that
allowed the the inside of the airplane
to be room temperature cold with these
shingles that reflect the heat they look
exactly they&#39;re another little bit
thinner because they have a little bit
better materials but we built exactly
the same structure and 65 and tested it
to Mach 12 conditions almost the same
standoffs a little bit more elegant than
what we had because they have a little
more elegant materials these days but we
were convinced we could do it then
people laugh at you and say well no you
couldn&#39;t or no it&#39;s impossible we&#39;re not
going to do that because it&#39;s risky but
no it wasn&#39;t risky and yes it could be
done all it takes is a dreamer so can
you imagine the Wright brothers if they
one was a lawyer and when wasn&#39;t a
common why are you going to build a
stupid airplane for it only carries one
person who&#39;s going to buy it what kind
of profit margin we&#39;re going to get god
we got 40% on bicycles why are we doing
this for think of the liability
everybody can sue us it&#39;s a bad idea
yeah let&#39;s not do it as long as we have
that opinion we&#39;re stuck what you have
to say is my gosh it&#39;s something that no
one&#39;s ever done before let&#39;s try it if I
were to look at since my first
introduction to UFOs is a young
lieutenant today I would say have to
look at first of all I believe there&#39;s a
large number of covert projects that go
on the United States and none of us were
ever aware of and if you see some of
those things
they probably bend your mind in the
don&#39;t fit your conception of what what
an airplane or whatever it is and so it
seems to you to be a UFO so I think
maybe a large fraction of those are
covert projects that we&#39;re doing or
someone&#39;s doing that are earthbound and
human beings and and and and if you
really knew that what was behind them
you would say yes I I can see how that
works but then I think it&#39;s like large
project Bluebook there&#39;s this hardcore
ten fifteen percent or twenty percent
that don&#39;t fit any explanation other
than the fact that the the individuals
the beings that are in demand came here
I came here by way of a process that
we&#39;re not familiar with that is time
space travel and I firmly believe that
some of those are like that the history
of the world has been that the wrong
individual getting that information can
use it for a lot of destructive things
not everyone would use it for the
betterment almost any anything you can
think of can be turned around to be used
as a weapon and when you get into these
kind of energy energy time transitions
order it whatever you I can that&#39;s I
can&#39;t think of the best word it&#39;s it&#39;s
it&#39;s what Tom Bearden says that they
could be used to just wipe out whole
segments of the population and then the
earth as well as they could be mate to
liberate us from all dependence on
fossil fuels well first of all the blood
the anti-ballistic missile defense
system is probably a pipe dream in the
sense that if what is designed for is
that you know where it&#39;s coming from and
when we had Russia there was a 50/50
chance that you knew
about where it would be coming from with
the rogue nations we have today it&#39;s
absolutely ludicrous it&#39;s the guy who
walks in with the briefcase with
remember that in the 50s they built a
nuclear warhead that fit inside a
sparrow aim-7 sparrow which has an 8
inch diameter body now it was 1/4
kiloton weapon that will fit inside any
briefcase you can think of now the guy
may die carrying it but he&#39;s going to
die anyway so what difference does it
make
I&#39;m far more feared of that then if if
people can if beings can travel in time
space than anything we would put in
orbit as a weapon would be like like
going against jenga&#39;s con with a
firecracker you know if it doesn&#39;t make
sense you know when we talk about
zero-point energy
what that means is that when everything
comes down to rest there&#39;s still energy
left it&#39;s like sea level in in in the
ocean and there is a constant flow of
energy between matter and antimatter is
it annihilates itself and recreates
itself
it occurs in stars all of these big star
factories you see now with Hubble is a
continual exchange of energy and
although the average is 0 that 0 may be
a pretty high level above nothing at all
and what soccer off and some of the
physicists said is that it&#39;s this level
that creates the background for the
universe to exist because a group of
Russians that use that tube to repeat an
experiment that Tesla ran in Colorado
Springs when he ran it he actually
created he tapped so much energy that
the electric energy flowed back through
the wire and actually destroyed the
parse the the power station at Colorado
Springs and when the Russians repeated
it at Moscow Aviation Institute
- they blew up the one megawatt power
station at ma I this was 1980 when I got
involved in space again with Sandy
McDonald and we started the what
eventually became national aerospace
plane I met a group of Russians over in
England who had a conference and one of
them hadn&#39;t been involved in
transmitting energy from antenna on the
ground to a satellite in orbit back down
to Moscow with only about 10-15 percent
losses and he said the reason we can do
this is this is a scalar way projector
and here&#39;s what it uses and he opens up
his loose-leaf binder and says now you
can&#39;t take any pictures of this or make
any sketches just look at it in low and
behold there&#39;s the tube I saw in
civilian Yugoslavia and this was the
antenna that what caspar weinberger was
saying was the anti-ballistic missile
thing and he told me even then he says
you know if you ever go in the building
all you&#39;re going to see is an empty
concrete building with a couple of
cables because it&#39;s not an
anti-ballistic missile radar it&#39;s a
scalar wave transmitter and finally when
the DoD got in there they found an empty
concrete building with a couple of wires
in it and he said ah
they pulled everything out and Victor
says it never was in there so they
actually he claims he pi he transmitted
up to 10 megawatts of power from this
station to satellite to Moscow and got
about it eight and a half to nine
megawatts of power back received in
Moscow so they were on the verge of
understanding how you do some of these
unconventional things but all of that is
now gone I don&#39;t know where he is he
lost his job his Institute disappeared
so a lot of that work just collapsed in
the Soviet Union that&#39;s the same tube
the Tesla says he could transmit energy
to Mars the surface of Mars and support
a human colony or to the surface of the
Moon so once you make it once you break
that breakthrough that you actually do
that then just think of the hole that
then fuel doesn&#39;t become a problem
anymore in our but you just use one of
these tubes to generate the power
directly to the right antenna and you
you can you can fly to the moon you can
fly in our but you can do anything you
want I think it&#39;s like a lot of things
the people that if there are a group of
people in the world that that have
access to it I don&#39;t think they know how
to let go of it because they&#39;re afraid
who&#39;s going to get their hands on it
even though there&#39;d be tremendous
benefit to mankind and to Enver been
getting us energy sources that we
wouldn&#39;t have the problems we have with
today they&#39;re also worried about that
somebody could take that same energy
source and do the equivalent of what
they did with the coal of instead of
blowing a hole inside just obliterating
the whole ship it&#39;s like trying to
describe a casper of the go the Friendly
Ghost you might see a cartoon of him but
you don&#39;t know how big he is you don&#39;t
know where his funding comes from you
don&#39;t know how many there are because of
the compartmentalization and the oath of
people have to take I mean I know people
today that worked on one of the things
that I worked on that if you ask them
did you recognize this name they would
even if I can show it to you on the
internet there&#39;s some things that have

would never admit that they even know
what you&#39;re talking about so you don&#39;t
know you have no idea but it&#39;s probably
it&#39;s probably larger than you think
and again that there&#39;s a reason for it
and that is you don&#39;t want people who
would be hostile to you to know what it
is you could do to them if they really
caused a major catastrophe because if
they knew that you wouldn&#39;t prevent them
from doing it they would just do it

damn that&#39;s that&#39;s the hard thing to do
this today I mean who would ever think
in Japan that a group of Japanese
citizens who are normally the most
controlled individuals you&#39;ve ever seen

their underground metropolitan train
system I just blew my mind that they
would they did that possibilities of
UFOs are much superior than we think
really probably it&#39;s it&#39;s hard to say
that fly that the unidentified flying
objects fly what does it mean fly we fly
a plane flies because it has a sort of
portance but probably
