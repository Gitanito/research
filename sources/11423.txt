  					 After giving birth to my first child, I hemorrhaged losing eight pints of blood.  The placenta had stuck.  I could not be put to sleep because I had eaten just before labor. Delivery was uneventful until the afterbirth problem. I remember being cold and asking for blanket.....


I felt the doctor scraping me and trying to stop bleeding. I asked the nurse if I was dying.


Then I was floating above my body that I saw was lying on the table.  I could describe equipment and conversations of nurses and doctor. I was not scared, but was emotionally detached from the scene. I thought, 'HMMMM I must be dying.'  Then I remembered my new baby and prayed, 'Please let me stay. I have a new baby.'


I remember feeling the transfusion in my veins and the blood was very cold, like ice water.  Then I was back.


The doctor said that he almost lost me. My baby was born at 11:35pm.  The doctor finished working on me at 3am. He never gave up.


I had no anesthesia during this time.
