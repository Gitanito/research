jENOPHON, having said
nothings in his Cyropæ-
dia, of what happen dfrom
the 1 6th to the 40th Tear
of Cyrus, / have taken the Liberty
to fill up a Tart of this Chasm by
making him travel. The Relation
of his Travels gives me an Oppor
tunity of describing the Religion,
Manners, and Policy of the several
Countries thro' which he passes 5 as
also thegreat Revolutions, which hap
pen'd in that Hero's Ttme, in Egypt,
Greece, Tyre, and Babylon.

there discusses the Matter with a Bre

He was educated from his tender
Years, after the Manner of antient
'Perfea, where the young Satrapes
were inur'd to Hardfliip, Fatigue, and
a military Life. Hunting and War
were their only Exercifes., and they
look'd upon the one as an Image of
the other.
The tper/ians were hitherto rough,
but virtuous. They were not vers'd

in those Arts and Sciences which po
lish the Minds and Manners. But
they were great Masters of the sublime
Science of being content with simple
Nature, of despising Death for the
Love of their Country, and of flying
all Pleasures which emasculate the
Mind, and enervate the Body.
The Youth were educated in pub-
lick Schools, where they were early
instructed in the Knowledge of the
Laws, and accustom'd to hear Causes,
pass Sentence, and mutually to do
one another Justice 5 and hereby they
discovered their Dispositions, Penetra
tion, and Capacity for Employments
in a riper Age.
The Virtues which their Masters
were principally careful to inspire,
were Truth and Goodness, Sobriety
and Obedience. The two former
make us resemble the Gods 5 the two

\
latter are necessary to the Preserva
tion of Order. *
The chief Aim of the Laws in
antient Perjia, was to prevent the
Corruption of the Heart: And for
this Reason, the 'Persians punisii'd
Ingratitude, a Vice against which
there is no Provision made by the
Laws of other Nations. Whoever
was capable of forgetting a Benefit,
or of refusing to do a good Office
when it was in his Power, was looked
upon as an Enemy to Society.
Cyrus had been educated according
to these wise Maxims. And though
it was impossible to conceal from him
his Rank and Condition, yet he was
treated like the rest ofhis Companions,
and with the same Severity as if he
had. not been born to reign. He was
taught to practise an exact Obedience,

that he might afterwards know how
to command.
When he arrived at the Age of
Sixteen, Astyages press d to see him.?
Mandana could not avoid complying,
but was uneasy at the Thought of
being oblig'd to carry her Son to the
Court of Echatana.
For the Space of two hundred
Years, the Bravery of the Kings of
Media had extended their Conquests 5
and Conquests had begot Luxury,
which is always the Fore-runner of
the Fall of Empires. Valour, Con
quest, Luxury, Anarchy. This is
the fatal Circle, and these are the
different Periods of the politick Life,
in almost all States. The Court of
Echatana was then in its Splendor 3
but this Splendor had nothing in it of
Solidity.
* See Mr. Freress Letter, p. 5.
The
The Travels 0/ Cyrus. 7
The Days were spent in Effemi
nacy, or in Flattery. The Love of
Glory, strict Probity, severe Honour,
were no longer in Esteem. Solid
Knowledge was looked upon as con
trary to Delicacy ofManners. Agree
able Trifling, fine-spun Thoughts, and
lively Sallies of Imagination, were
the only Kinds of Wit admired there.
No sort of Writings pleas'd, but
amusing Fictions 5 where a perpetual
Succession ofEvents surprized by their
Variety, without improving the Un

Love was without Delicacy. Blind
Pleasure was its only attractive Charm.
The Women thought themselves de
spised when no Attempts were made
to ensnare them. That which con
tributed to encrease this Corruption
of Mind, Manners, and Sentiments,
was the new Doctrine, spread every

Heart. For as each Man was free to
place his Pleasure according to his
Fancy, this Maxim authorized Virtue
or Vice according to every one's Taste,
Humour, or Complexion.
This Depravity, however, was not
then so universal in Media, as it be-
i *' came afterwards under the Reigns of
Artaxerxes and 'Darius Codomanus.
Corruption takes its Rise in Courts,
and extends itself gradually thro' all
.» ' ". I the Parts of a State. There were in
the Provinces, and in the Troops,
several military Men who were not
corrupted by the infectious Air of
Echatana, but had preserv'd in them
selves all the Virtues which flourish'd
in the Reigns of Demes and ^hra-
ortes.
Mandana was throughly sensible of
all the Dangers to which she should
expose young Cyrus, by carrying him
to
The Travels o/Cyrus.
to a Court, the Manners ofwhich were
so different from those of the Ter-
Jians. But the Will ofCambyfes, and
the Orders of djlyages, obliged her
to undertake the Journey.
She set out, attended by a Body
ofthe young Nobility of 'Persia, un
der the Command of Hyftaspes, to
whom the Education of Cyrus had
been committed. She was in a Cha
riot with her Son, and it was the
first time he had seen himself distin
guish'd from his Companions.
Mandana was a Princess of un
common Virtue. Her Mind was cul
tivated and adorned, and she had a
Genius much above her Sex. She
made it her Business, during the Jour
ney, to inspire Cyrus with the Love
of Virtue, by entertaining him with
Fables according to the Eastern Man

are not gained by difficult and refined
Reasonings, they must be enticed by
agreeable and familiar Images. To
make Truth lovely to them, it must
be exhibited by sensible and beautiful
Representations.
Mandana had observed that 'Cyrus
was often too full of himself, and
that he discovered some Tokens of a
rising Vanity, which might one Day
obscure his great Qualities. She en
deavoured to make him sensible of
the Deformity of that Vice, by re
lating to him the Fable of Sozares,

Ajfyria It resembles the Story of
the Grecian Narciffhs, who perished
by the foolish Love of himself. For
thus it is that the Gods punish 5 they

She then painted to him the Beauty
of those noble Virtues which lead to
Heroism, by the generous forgetting
ofoneWelf. She related to him the
Fable of the first Hermes, a divine
Youth, who was beautiful without
knowing it, had Wit without think
ing so, and who was unacquainted
with his own Virtue, because he was
ignorant that there were Vices.
It was thus that Mandana instruct
ed her Son during the Journey 5 one
Fable gave Rise to another. The
Questions of the Prince furnished the
Queen with new Matter to entertain
him, and with Opportunities of teach
ing him the Sense of the Egyptian
Fables, the Taste for which had pre
vailed very much in the Eafl, since /,
the Conquests of Sefejiris. {
As they passed one Day by a
Mountain, consecrated to the great
Oroma%es,
ii The Travels os Cyrus.
Oromazes*, Mandana stopp'd her
Chariot, alighted, and drew near to the
sacred Place. It was the Day of a so
lemn Festival, and the High Priest was
already preparing the Victim, crown'd
with Flowers. He was of a sudden
seiz'd with a Divine Spirit, and inter
rupting the Silence and Solemnity of
the Sacrifice, cryed out in a Trans
port 5 / fee a young Laurel rising.
It will soon spread its Branches over
all the East. The Nations will come
in Crowds to assemble together under
its Shadow. At the very same In
stant a Spark of Fire flew out from
the Pile, and moved about the Head
of Cyrus.
Mandana made deep Reflections
upon this Event, and after she was
again in her Chariot, said to her Son,
The Gods sometimes fend these Au
guries to animate Heroick Souls : They

are Presages of what may happen,
and by no means certain 'Predictions
of a Futurity, which muji always de
pend upon their Virtue.
Being arrived upon the Frontiers
of Media, Jjlyages, with all his
Court, came out to meet them. He
was a Prince of great Beneficence and
Humanity, but his natural Goodness
made him often too Easy, and his
Propensity to Pleasure had brought
the Medes into the Taste of Luxury
and Effeminacy *.
Cyrus, soon aster his Arrival at
the Court of Echatana, gave Proofs
of a Wit and Judgment far beyond
his Age. J
styages put divers Ques
tions to him concerning the Manners,
Laws, and Method ofeducating Youth
among the cPerfians. He was struck
with Astonishment at the lively and

noble
\ 4 The Travels of Cyrus.
noble Answers of his Grandson. All
the Court admired the bright Parts of
Cyrus, insomuch that he began to be
intoxicated with Praise. A secret Pre
sumption steals into his Heart. He
talks a little too much, and does not
hearken enough to others. He de
cides with an Air of Sufficiency, and
seems too fond of Wit.
Mandana, to remedy this Fault,
contrived. to set before him his own
Picture, by certain Passages of His
tory 5 for she still proceeded in his
Education, upon the same Plan on
which flie had begun it. She related to
him the Story of Logis and Sygeus.
c My Son, said she, it was for-
c merly the Custom at Thebes, in
c Bœotia, to raise to the Throne, af-
* ter the Death of the King, him, of
' all his Children, who had the best
c Parts. When a Prince has fine Parts

proper Use of their Talents, and
govern those who govern under
him. This is the great Secret of
the Art of Reigning.
c Among the King's Sons there
were two who discovered a supe-
riour Genius. The elder loved
Talking, the younger was more
silent. The eloquent Prince, named
Logh, made himself admired by
the Charms of his Wit. The silent
Prince, named Sygeus, made him
self loved by the Goodness of his
Heart. The first fhew'd plainly,
even while he endeavoured to con
ceal it, that he spoke only to shine.
The second hearkned readily to
others, and looked upon Conversa
tion, as a sort of Commerce, where
each Person ought to bring some
thing of his own. The one made
the most thorny and perplexed Af
fairs agreeable by a peculiar Grace
in the manner of treating them :

* The other threw Light upon the otv
c Icurest Points, by reducing every

ther, and raised by degrees a Re
bellion, under Pretext that Injus
tice had been done to Logis.

* The chief Men of both Parties,
seeing the Miseries with which the
State was ready to be overwhelmed,
thought it adviseable to prefer a less

Expedient of letting both the Bro

This Form of Government has ma
ny Inconveniencies, but it was pre
ferr'd before a Civil War, the great
est of all Calamities. The two
Brothers applauded the Proposal for
Peace, and Logis mounted the
Throne. He changed, in a little
time, all the antient Laws of the
Kingdom, was always listening to
new Projects 5 and to have a lively
Imagination was sufficient to raise
a Man to the highest Employments.
That which seemed excellent in
Speculation could not be executed
but with Difficulty and Confusion.

His Ministers, who had no Expe
rience, knew not that precipitate
Changes, how useful soever they
may appear, are always dangerous.
c The neighbouring Nations took
occasion from this weak Admini
stration to invade the State5 and had
it not been for the Prudence and
Bravery of Sygeus, all had been lost,
and the People must have submit
ted to a foreign Yoke. But this
Prince engag'd, defeated, and drove
the Enemy out of the Country.
c It was then decided in the su<
preme Council of the old Men,
That the King to be chosen for the
suture^ should not be the Person who
gave Proofs of the quickest Parts,
but of the soundest Judgment.
They were of Opinion, that to talk
eloquently, or to be fruitful in
Expedients, were not Talents so

Cyrus usually confess'd his Faults
without seeking to excuse them. He
listened to this Story with Attention.,
perceived the Design oiMandana in
telling it him, and resolved to correct:
himself.
Soon after this, he gave a notable
Proof of his Genius and Courage.
He was scarce Seventeen Years ofAge
when Merodac Son of Nabuchodono-
sor King of Assyria assembled some
Troops under pretence of Hunting,
and made an Irruption into Media.
He left his Infantry upon the Fron
tiers, and marching in Person with
twelve thousand Horse towards the
first strong Places belonging to the
Medes, encamped near them, and
from thence sent out Detachments
every

every Day to scour and ravage the
Country.
Ajlyages had early Notice that
the Enemy was enter'd into his
Dominions, and after having given
the necessary Orders for assembling his
Army, he set out with his Son Cy-
axares and young Cyrus, followed
only by some Squadrons levy'd in
haste, to the Number of eight thou
sand Horse.
When he was come near the Bor
ders of his own Country, he en-
cam p'd upon a rising Ground, from
whence he discover'd the Plain which
Merodac ravaged by his Detach
ments. Aftyages ordered two of his
General Officers to go and observe
the Enemy. Cyrus desired leave to
accompany them, in order to inform
himself of the Situation of the Coun
try, the advantageous Posts, and the
Strength of the Assyrian Army.
C 3 Having
2t The Travels of Cyrus.
Having made his Observations, he
came back, and gave an exact: Ac
count of all he had seen.
Afiyages the next Day assembled
a Council of War to deliberate upon
the Motions he should make. The
greatest Part of the General Officers,
apprehending some Ambush if they
should leave their Camp, advis'd the
suspending all Action, till the Arrival
of new Troops. Cyrus, who was
impatient to engage, hearken'd to
their Reasonings with Uneasiness, but
observed a profound Silence out of
Respect to the Emperor, and so ma
ny experiencd Commanders 3 till at
length Ajiyages order'd him to speak.
He then rose up in the midst of the
Assembly, and with a noble and mo
dest Air, said, / discovers Tejierday

of it, by passing secretly a Detach-
ment thither thro' this Valley, which
is at our Left. I will convey my self
thither with Hystaspes, if the Em
peror approves it.
Cyrus held his peace, blush'd, and
feard to have spoken too much. All
adnuYd his Genius for War, at such
tender Years. Ajtyages was surpriz'd
at the Justness of his Thought, and
immediately commanded that his
Counsel should be follow'd.
Cyaxares marched strait to the
Enemy, while Cyrus, accompanied
by Hyflafpes, filed off with a Body
of Cavalry, without being discovers,
and conceal'd himself in the Wood.
The Prince of the Medes attack'd the
Assyrians dispers'd in the Plain. Me-
rodac left his Camp to sustain them.

with his Voice animated the Medes,
who all followed him with Ardour,
He cover'd himself with his Shield,
pierc'd into the thickest of the Squa
drons, and spread Terror and Slaughter
where-ever he came. The Assyrians
seeing themselves thus attack'd on all
Sides, lost Courage, and fled in Dis
order.
Cyrus, after the Battle, was sen
sibly touch'd with seeing the Field
cover'd with dead Bodies. He took the
lame Care of the wounded Assyrians,
as of the Medes, and gave the ne
cessary Orders for their Cure. They
are Men, said he, as well as we,
and are no longer Enemies when once
they are vanquishd.
The Emperor, having taken his
Precautions to prevent such Irruptions
for the suture, return'd to Ecbatana.
Mandana soon aster was oblig'd to

leave Media. She was desirous to carry
back her Son with her, but Aftyages
opposed it : Why will you, said he,
deprive me of the 'Pleasure offeeing

my old Age : besides, he will here
learn military discipline, which is
not yet known in Persia. / conjure
you by the 'Tenderness which I have

■
Mandana could not yield her Con
sent, but with infinite Concern. She
dreaded the leaving her Son in the
midst of a Courts which was the
Seat of Voluptuousness. Being alone
with Cyrus, stie was resolv d to sound
his Inclinations, and ask'd him, Whe
ther he liked best to stay at Ecbatana,
or to return to 'Persia. He answer'd,
/ should be sincerely glad to return
with you, but methinks I may here

Ifear, reply'd Mandana, that the
Reason you offer is only a 'Pretence,
and even a Beginning of Corruption.

Leave Hystaspes with me, reply'd
Cyrus : he will teach me to avoid all
these T)angers. His Virtue is not too
severe. I have been long accujlomd
to open my Heart to him, and he is
not only my Counsellor, but the Confi~

mander : He had serv'd many Years
under Aflyages, in his Wars against
the Scythians, and the King of Lydia,
and had all the Virtues ofthe antient
'Persians, together with the Politeness
of the Medes. Being a great Poli
tician, and a great Philosopher, a
Man equally able and disinterested,
he had risen to the first: Employ
ments of the State, without Ambi

Mandana being persuaded of the
Virtue and Capacity of Hyflajpes, as
well as of the Advantages her Son
might find, by living in a Court,
that was no less brave and knowing
in the Art of War, than polite, re-
solv'd to obey Jjlyages,
She began her Journey soon after,
and Cyrus accompanied her some
Leagues from Ecbatana, At parting
she embrac'd him with Tenderness 5
My Son, said she, remember that your
Virtue alone can make me happy. The
young Prince melted into Tears, and
stood silent. This was his first Se
paration from her. He follow'd her
with his Eyes till she was out of
Sight, and then return'd to Ecbatana.
Cyrus continued in a voluptuous
Court, without being infected by it.
This however was not owing to the
Precautions of Mandana, the Coun

Virtue, but to Love.
There was then at the Court of
Eclatan a young Princess named Cas-

and Daughter of 'Pharnafpes, who
was of the Race of the Achemenides *.
Her Father, who was one of the
principal Satrapes of ^Per/ta, had sent
her to the Court of Afiyages, to be
there educated. She had all the
Politeness of that Court, without
any of its Faults. Her Wit was
equal to her Beauty, and her Mo
desty heighten'd the Charms of both.
Her Imagination was lively, but di
rected by her Judgment. A Justness
of Thought was as natural to her as a
Gracefulness of Expression. She spoke
seldom 5 but when she did speak, one
might perceive that she priz'd Virtue
more than Wit. She had entertain'd

a particular Regard for Cyrus from
the first Moment she saw him, but
conceal'd her Sentiments so well, as
not to be suspected.
Proximity of Blood gave Cyrus
frequent Opportunities of seeing and
discoursing with her. Her Conversa
tion soften'd the Manners of the young
Prince, and he insensibly acquir'd a
Delicacy with which till then he had
not been acquainted.
The Beauties and Virtues of this
Princess produced by degrees in his
Soul all the Motions of that noble
Passion, which softens the Hearts of
Heroes without lessening their Cou
rage, and which places the principal
Charm of Love in the Pleasure of
loving. Precepts, Maxims, and se
vere Lessons, do not always preserve
the Mind from the poison'd Arrows
of Sensuality. 'Tis perhaps exacting
too much from Youth, to require
that

that they should be insensible. And it
often happens that nothing but a well-
plac'd Love can be a Security from
dangerous and criminal Passions.
Cajsandana perceiv'd the Affection
of Cyrus, but without seeming to
observe it. And Cyrus enjoy'd in
her Conversation all the Pleasures of
the purest Friendship, without de
claring his Love. His Youth and his
Modesty made him timorous. And
it was not long before he felt all the
Disquiets, Pains, and Alarms, which
ever tend upon such Passions, even
when they are most innocent.
Cajfandanas Beauty very soon
created him a Rival. Cyaxares be
came enamour'd of this Princess. He
was very near of the same Age with
Cyrus, but of a very different Cha
racter. He had Wit and Courage,
but was of an impetuous, haughty
Disposition, and shew'd already but
too
3 2 The Travels os Cyrus.
too great a Propensity to all the Vices
common to young Princes.
Cqfsandana could love nothing but
Virtue, and her Heart had made its
Choice. She dreaded more than
Death an Alliance with the Median
Prince, tho' it flatter'd so much her
Ambition.
Cyaxares was unacquainted with
the Delicacy of Love. His high
Rank augmented his natural Haugh
tiness, and the Manners ofthe.M?^.s
authoriz'd his Presumption : So that
he us'd little Precaution or Ceremony
in letting the Princess know his Pas
sion for her.
He immediately perceived her In
difference, sought for the Cause of it,
and was not long in making the Dis
covery. In all publick Diversions
she appear'd gay and free with him,
but was more constrain'd with Cyrus.
The
The Travels of Cyrus. 77
The Guard she kept upon herself,
gave her an Air of Reserve, which
was not natural to her. She answer'd
to all the Civilities of Cyaxares, with
ready and lively Turns of Wit 5 but
when Cyrus spoke, she could hardly
conceal her Perplexity.
Cyaxares observ'd this different Be
haviour, and guefs'd the Reason of
it : But young Cyrus, being little
skill'd in the Secrets ofLove, did not
interpret the Conduct of Cajfandana
in the same manner. He imagin'd
that she was pleas'd with the Passion
of Cyaxares, and that her Eyes were
dazzled with the Lustre ofthat Prince's
Crown.
Cyrus experienc'd alternately, the
Uncertainty and Hope, the Pains and
Pleasures of a lively Passion. His

Not long after, Cambyses having
Notice of Cyrus's Love for Caffan-
dana, recalled him to Terjia 5 for he
had other Views for his Son, which
agreed better with his Politicks.
'Pharnafpes was at the same time
inform'd of the Sentiments of Cyax-
ares. His Ambition was flatter'd
by the Hope of such an Alliance,
and he sent Orders to his Daughter
to stay at the Court of Ecbatana.
Cyrus and Caffandana were in
form'd of their Fathers Intentions,
and saw the Necessity of a Separa
tion. Their Grief was proportionable
to their Love. But the Prince flatter'd
himself that he should be able, by
the Help of Mandana, to move Cam
byses and 'Pharnafpes, at his Return
to the Court of Persia. And this
Hope hindered him from sinking
under the Sorrow of so cruel a
Situation.

which Jstyages had given him at

to go privately thro' By-ways, and
stop Cajsandana, and to conduct: her
to a solitary Place on the Borders of

Araspes had given himself up to all
the Pleasures of a voluptuous Court,
but in the midst of Sensuality had

just : All his Faults proceeded rather
from Easiness and Complaisance than
Vice : He had an excellent Under

as well as form'd for a Court, was
qualified for every thing both in Peace
and War.
He communicated the Orders given
him by Cyaxares to his Father Harpa-

conversing with them.
He undertook this Journey with
Cajsandana, attended by several Sa-

Banks of the Arqfis. They enter'd
by a narrow Pass into a large Valley,

Sound ofharmonious Mnsick. There,
they beheld, by the side of a cleat
Fountain, a great Number of Meri
of all Ages, and over against them a
Company of Women, who form'd a
Concert. They understood that it
Was the School of the Magi, and
were surpriz'd to see, instead of
austere, melancholy, and thoughtful
Men, an agreeable and polite People*
These Philosophers look'd upon Mu*

After they had given some little
time in the Morning to this Exercise,
they led their Disciples thro' agreeable
Places to the Sacred Mountain, ob
serving all the while a strict: Silence :
There, they ofFer'd their Homages to
the Gods, rather by the Voice of the
Heart, than of the Lips. Thus by
Musick, pleasant Walks, and Prayer,
they prepar'd themselves for the Con
templation of Truth, and put the
Soul into a Serenity proper for Medi
tation : The rest of the Day was
spent in Study. Their only Repast
was a little before Sun-set, at which
they eat nothing but Bread, and some
Portion of what had been offer'd to
the Gods, concluding all with Con

Archimagus. He, who then pos
sessed that Honour, was named Z*av~

rest more in Wisdom than in Age,
for he was scarce fifty Years old :
Nevertheless he was a consummate
Master in all the Sciences of the Goal*

arose and worshipped them, bowing
themselves t© the Earths according to

Spirits, who descend sometimes from
the Throne of Oromazes, to con

Seeing herself alone with a Man,
she fled, and took Refuge in a
Temple that was near the Forest.
I durst not follow her 5 but I learnt
that she was Daughter of an old
Brachman, who dwelt in that
Temple, and that she was conse
crated to the Worship of the Fire.
The Laws of the Ejlales are so
severe among the Indians, that a
Father thinks it an Act of Religion,
to throw his Daughter alive into the
Flames,should she ever fall from that
Purity of Manners which she has
sworn to preserve. My Father was
yet living, and I could not make use
of Violence : But had I been

Months with her, and it was not

I could engage her to love me,
she would forsake her State of Life,
to share my Crown with me : For

1 young Heart given up to its Passion ?
£ As I was one Day crossing the
Country of the Lycians, I stopt in
a great Forest, to shelter myself
from the Heat. I presently saw a
Company of Hunters pass by, and
a little after several Women, among
whom I thought I discoverd Selima ;
She was in a hunting Dress, mount
ed upon a proud Courser, and di-
stinguish'd from all the rest by a
Crown of Flowers. She pass'd by
me so swift, that I could not be
sure whether my Conjectures were
well founded 5 but I went strait to
the Capital.
e The Lycians were at that time
govern'd by Women, which Form
of Government was establifli'd
among them upon the following
Occasion,
5 Some
IT'he Travels of Cyrus. 7?
1 Some Years ago, the Men became
so effeminate during a long Peace,
that their Thoughts were wholly
taken up about their Dress. They
affected the Discourse, Manners,
Maxims, and all the Imperfections
of Women, without having either
their Sweetness or Delicacy : And
while they gave themselves up to
infamous Laziness., the most abo-r
minable Vices took the Place of
lovely Passions. They defpis'd the
Lycian Women, and treated them
like Slaves. A foreign War came
upon them. The Men being grown
cowardly and effeminate, were
not able to defend their Country.
They fled and hid themselves in
Caves and Caverns. The Women,
being accustomed to Fatigue, by
the Slavery they had undergone,
rook Arms, drove away the Enemy,
became Mistresses of the Country,
and establish'd themselvesin Author
rity by an immutable Law.
' From
74' %"he Travels es Cyrus,
' From that time the Lycians ac
customed themselves to this Form
of Government, and found it the
easiest and most convenient.
Their Queens had a Council of
Senators, who assisted them with
their Advice : The Men proposed
good Laws, but the Women caus'd
them to be executed. The Sweetness
and Mildness of the Sex prevented
all the Mischiefs of Tyranny 5
and the Counsel of the wise Sena
tors, qualify'd that Inconstancy,
with which Women are reproach'd,
• I understood that the Mother of
Selima, having been dethroned by
the Ambition of a Kinswoman,
her first Minister had fled to the
Indies with the young Princess 5 that
he had liv'd there several Years as a
Brachman, and she as an Efiale $
that this old Man having always
maintained a Correspondence with
« the
^Travels o/Cyrus, -'^j
the Friends of the Royal Family,
the young Queen had been restor'd
to the Throne after the Death of
the Usurper 5 that she govern d
with the Wisdom of a Person who
had experienc'd Misfortunes : And
lastly, that she had always express'd
an invincible Dislike to Marriage.
e This News gave me an inex
pressible Joy 5 I thank'd the Gods
for having conducted me by such
wonderful Ways, near the Object
of my Heart 5 I implor'd their Help,
and promis'd never to love but
once, if they would favour my
Passion.
1 I consider'd of several Methods
whereby to make myself known to
the Queen 5 and seeing that War
was the most proper, I engag'd in
the Troops. There, I distinguish'd
myself very soon 5 for I refus'd no
Fatigue, I sought the most hazardous

Enterprizes, and expos'd myself
every where. Upon a Day of
Battle, which was to be decisive of
the Liberty of the Lycians, the
Carians put our Troops into Dis
order : 'Twas in a large Plain, out
of which there was but one narrow
Pass. I gain'd this Pass, and
thfeatned to pierce with my Jave
lin, any Man who should attempt
to force it. In this Manner I rally'd
our Troops, and returned to charge
the Enemy 5 I routed them? and
obtained a complete Victory. This
Action drew the Attention of all
the Army upon me : Nothing was
spoken of but my Courage 5 and all
the Soldiers call'd me the Deliverer
of their Country. I was conducted
to the Queen's Presence, who could
not recollect me 5 for we had been
separated six Years, and Grief and
Fatigue had alter'd my Features.
'She

c She ask'd me my Name, and
my Country, and examined me
with Attention. I thought I dis
covered in her Eyes a secret Emo

I conceiv'd a Design of making

conceal'd my Country, and my
Birth, and told her, I was born in
a Village of Bafiria, of a very
obscure Family. Upon which she
suddenly withdrew, without an
swering me.

you then forgot Amana ? She was
transported with Surprize, Ten

me, and conjectur'd all the rest.
I had no need to speak 5 and we
both were a long time silent. At
length I told her my Story, with ,
all the Effects that Love had pro
duc'd in me.
1 She very soon assembled her
Council, and acquainted them with
my Birth. Embassadors were sent
to the Indies. I renounced my
Crown and Country for ever 5 and
my Brother was confirmed in the
Possession of my Throne.
' This was an easy Sacrifice 5 I was

The Story of Zoroaster made a
strong Impression upon the Prince
and Princess5 it confirm'd them in
their mutual Tenderness, and in their
Love of Virtue,

While CaJJandana was agreeably
entertaining herself in the Conversa
tion ofthe Women, and with their har
monious Concerts, Zoroaster initiated
Cyrus into all the Mysteries of the
Eastern Wisdom. The Chaldeans,
the Egyptians, and the Gymnofophijls,
had a wonderful Knowledge of Na»
ture 5 but they wrapp'd it up in Alle
gorical Fables : And this, doubtless,
is the Reason, that venerable Anti
quity has been reproach'd with Igno
rance, in natural Philosophy.
Zoroaster laid open before Cyrus,
all the Secrets of Nature 5 not merely
to amuse him, but to make him ob
serve the Marks of an infinite Wis
dom, diffus'd throughout the Uni
verse 5 and thereby to prepare him
for more sublime Instructions relating
to the Divinity and Religion.
One
po The Travels of Cyrus.
One while he made him admire
the Structure of the Human Body,
the Springs of which it is compos'd,
and the Liquors that flow in it 5 the
Canals, the Pumps, and the Basons,
which are form'd by the mere inter
weaving of the Nerves, Arteries, and
Veins, in order to separate, purify,
conducts and reconduct the Liquids
into all the Extremities of the Body,
Then the Levers, the Cords, and
the Pullies, form'd by the Bones,
Muscles, and Cartilages, for the
causing of all the Motions of the
Solids. ..-.

this he made him comprehend, that
an Infinity of small imperceptible
Springs, the Construction and Mo
tions of which we are ignorant o£
are continually playing in our Bo*
dies 5 and consequently, that none
but a sovereign Intelligence could
produce, adjust, and preserve so
compounded, fb delicate, and so
admirable a Machine.
At another time he explain'd to
him the Configuration of Plants, and
the Transformation of Insects. They
had not then our Optkk Glasses, to
magnify Objects, and bring them
near 5 but the penetrating Spirit of
Zoroajier, inlightened by a long Tra
dition of physical Experiments, saw
further than the Eye can reach to by
their Help.
I Each

within it a Plant of its own Spe
cies 5 This Plant another Seed 5 and
this Seed another little Plant 5 and
so on without End. Fruitful Na
ture is inexhaustible. The Growth
of Vegetables is but the unfolding
of the Fibres, Membranes, and
Branches, by the flowing of the
Moisture of the Earth into them..
The Pressure of the Air makes that
nourishing Moisture, which is preg
nant with Salts, Sulphur, and Oils,
enter into the Tubes of the Roots.
The Action of the Sun in the Day
time draws upwards the subtil Part
of the Sap 5 and the Coolness of
the Night fixes, condenses, and
ripens it, in order to produce
Leaves, Flowers and Fruits5 and
to form all those Riches of Nature,
which charm the Sight, the Smell,
and the Taste.

He then recounted to him all their
different Metamorphoses. Now they
are Worms which crawl upon the

quors 5 and at last, they get Wings,
and rise into the Air.
Another time, the Sage carried the

Regions, to contemplate all the extra

there.
He shew'd him the wonderful
Qualities of that subtil and invisible

a strong Impression on the Mind of

least the mutual Tenderness of these
happy Lovers. They liv'd thus se
veral Years together, and Cajsandana
brought Cyrus two Sons, Cambyfes
and Smerdis, and two Daughters,
Meroe and Arijlona, and then died,
tho' in the Flower of her Age.
None but those who have experiene'd
the Force of true Love3 founded upon
Virtue, can imagine the disconsolate
Condition of Cyrus. In losing Cas-
sandana, he lost all. Taste, Reason,
Pleasure, and Duty were all united
to augment his Passion. In loving
her he had experiene'd all the Charms
of Love, without knowing either its
Pains, or the Disgusts with which it
is often attended. He feels the
Greatness of his Loss, and refuses all
Consolation. It is neither the sudden
Revolutions in States, nor the severe
Stroaks of adverse Fortune, which
oppress the Minds of Heroes. Noble

and generous Souls are touch'd by
those Misfortunes only which concern
the Objects of their softer Passions.
Cyrus gives himself wholly up to
Grief, not to be alleviated by weep
ing or complaining. Great Passions
are always mute. This profound
Silence is at length succeeded by a
Torrent of Tears. Mandana and
AraspeSy who never left him, endea
vour'd to comfort him no other way,
than by weeping with him. Rea- 1
soning and Persuasion furnish no Cure
for Sorrow 5 nor can Friendship yield
Relies, but by sharing it.
After he had long continu'd in this
Dejection, he return'd to see Zoro
aster. The Conversation of that
great Man contributed much to mol
lify the Anguish of his Mind 5 but it
was by Degrees that he recover'd
himself, and not till he had travell'd
for some Years.

Cyrus obey'd his Father's Orders,
and very soon left Terfia, accom-
pany'd by his Friend Araspes, Two
Faithful Slaves were all his Attendants,
for he desir'd to be unknown. He
went down the River Agradatus, em-
bark'd upon the 'Persian Gulf, and
soon arriv'd at the Port of Gerra,
upon the Coast of Arabia Felix.
The next Day he continu'd his
Way towards the City of Macoraba,
The Serenity of the Sky, the Mild
ness of the Climate, the Perfumes
which embalm'd the Air, the Variety,
Fruitfulness, and smiling Appearance
of Nature in every Part, charm'd all
his Senses.
While the Prince was admiring the
Beauty of the Country, he saw a
Man
The Travels o/Cyrus, ill
Man walking with a grave and flow
Pace, and who seem'd bury'd in some
profound Thought. He was already-
come near Cyrus, without having
perceiv'd him. The Prince inter
rupted his Meditation to ask him the
Way to Nahata, where he was to
embark for Egypt.
Amenophis (for that was his Name)
saluted the Travellers with great
Civility, and having represented to
them, that the Day was too far spent
to continue their Journey, hospita*
bly invited them to his rural Ha
bitation. He led them through a
By-way, to a little Hill not far
off, where he had form'd with
his own Hands, several rustick
Grotto's. A Fountain rose in the

Peace and Tranquillity.
Amenophis set before his Guests
some dry'd Fruits, and delicious
Wines 5 and entertain'd them agree*
ably during their Repast. An unaf
fected and serene Joy was to be seen
upon his Countenance. His Dis
course was full of good Sense, and
os noble Sentiments. He had all the
Politeness of a Man educated at the
Courts of Kings 5 which gave Cyrus
a great Curiosity to know the Cause
of his Retirement. In order to engage
Amenophis to a greater Freedom, he
discover'd to him who he was, and
the Design of his Travels $ and at
the same time let him see his Desire,
but with that modest Respect, which
one ought to have for the Secret of a
Stranger. Amenophis perceiving it,
began the History of his Life and Mis
fortunes in the following Manner :
% ' Tho'

c Tho' I am descended from one
of the antientest Families in Egypt ;
nevertheless by the sad Vicissitude of
human Things, the Branch, from
which I come, is fallen into great
Poverty. My Father liv'd near

He cultivated his paternal Farm
with his own Hands, and brought
me up to the Taste of true Plea
sures, in the Simplicity of a Coun
try Life 5 to place my Happiness
in the Study of Wisdom, and to
make Agriculture, Hunting, and ,
the liberal Arts my sweetest Occu
pations.
* It was the Custom of King
rfpries, from time to time to make
a Progress thro' the different Pro
vinces of his Kingdom. One Day
as he pass'd thro' a Forest near the
Place where I liv'd, he perceiv'd me
under the Shade of a Palm-tree,

* I was then but Sixteen Years of
Age, and my Youth and Air drew
the King's Attention. He came
up to me, ask'd me my Name,
my Condition, and what I was
reading. He was pleased with my
Answers, order'd me to be con
ducted to his Court, and neglected
nothing in my Education.
c The Liking which Aprtes had
for me, changed, by Degrees, into
a Confidence, which seemed to
augment, in Proportion as I ad-
vanc'd in Years 5 and my Heart
was full of Affection and Grati
tude. Being young, and without
Experience, I thought that Princes

os that Obscurity from whence the
King had drawn me : I did not

a Disinterestedness, which charm'd
me. In a Word, he so gain'd my

prevail'd upon the Inhabitants of

had done them. AU the time that
he continued there, I had free Access

under his Protection. We march'd
against the Usurper, and gave him
Battle near Memphis 5 but having
only foreign Troops., we were intire-
ly defeated. To prevent further
Disturbances, the principal Officers
of our Army were condemn'd to
perpetual Imprisonment. Amajis
made me be sought for every where5
but a Report being spread of my
Death, he believed it, so that I was
confounded with the other Com
manders, and put into a high
Tower at Memphis.
1 The King was conducted to
Sais, where Amajis did him great
Honours for some Days. In order
to sound the Inclinations of the
People, he propos'd to them the
restoring him to the Throne, but
secretly form'd the Design of taking
away his Life. All the Egyptians
demanded the Prince's Death, and
Amajis yielded him to their Pleasure.

He was strangled in his own Palace,
and the Usurper crown'd with
Solemnity.
' Scarce were the People quieted,
when they gave way to that In
constancy which is natural to the
Multitude. They began to despise
the mean Birth of the new King,
and to murmur against him. But
this able Politician successfully made
use of his Address to prevent a
Rebellion.
' He had a golden Cistern., in
which he and his Courtiers used to
warn their Hands upon solemn
Festivals. He caus'd it to be made
into a Statue of Seraph, and ex-
pos'd it to be worfhipp'd by the
People. He beheld with Joy, the
Homages which they ran eagerly to
pay it from all Parts 5 and having
assembled the Egyptians, made
them the following Harangue :

c Amajis, by this impious Dis-
* course, which flatter'd the People,
c solidly fix'd his Authority : They
' conjur'd him to remain upon the
' Throne, and he seem'd to accept
c the Royalty as a Favour done to
' the People. He is ador'd by the
i Egyptians, whom he governs with
1 Mildness and Moderation. Good
' Policy requires it, and his Ambi-
' tion is satisfy'd. He lives at
* Sais, in a Splendor which dazzles
1 those who approach him. Nothing
1 seems wanting to his Happiness :
1 But I am assur'd, that inwardly
* he is far different from what he
1 appears outwardly. He thinks
* that every Man about him is like
1 himself, and would betray him, as
' he betray'd his Master. These
' continual Distrusts hinder him from
' enjoying the Fruit of his Crime 5
* and

' and it is thus that the Gods punifli
' him for his Usurpation. Cruel
£ Remorses rend his Heart, and dark

' Charm of Life.'
Here Cyrus interrupted Amenophis,
to ask him how Amafis could get
such an Ascendant over the Mind of
Apries.
c The Kingj reply'd Amenophis,
'- wanted neither Talents nor Virtues,
c but he did not love to be contra-
4 dieted : Even when he order'd his
c Ministers to tell him the Truth,
' he never forgave those who obey'd

affected to hate it. Amajis per
ceiv'd this Weakness, and manag'd
it with Art. When Apries made
any Difficulty of giving in to the ■
Despotick Maxims which that per
fidious Minister would have inspir'd
him with 3 he insinuated to the
King, that the Multitude, being in
capable of Reasoning, ought to be
govern d by absolute Authority *
and that Princes, being the Vice
gerents of the Gods, may act like
them, without giving a Reason of
their Conduct. He season d his
Counsels with so many seeming
Principles of Virtue, and' such de
licate Praise, that the Prince, being
seduc d, made himself hated by his
Subjects, without perceiving it.
Cyrus, deeply struck with these Re
flections, and with the unhappy Con
dition of Kings, could nor forbear
saying to Amenophis, ' Methinh

1 hlamd. How should 'Princes be
c able to discover Treacheryr, when it
c is conceal'd with Jo much Art ?
' The Happiness of the People,
answer'd Amenophhi makes the
Happiness of the Prince. Their
true Interests are necesiarily united,
whatever Pains are taken to separate
them. Whosoever attempts to in
spire Princes with contrary Maxims,
ought to be look'd upon as an
Enemy of the State.
* Moreover, Kings ought always
to be apprehensive of a Man who
never contradicts them, and who
tells them only such Truths as will
be agreeable. There needs no
further Proof of the Corruption of
a Minister, than to fee him pre
fer his Master's Favour, to his
Glory.

* In short, a Prince should know
how to make Advantage of the
Talents of his Ministers 5 but he
ought never to yield himself up

not give himself absolutely to them.
c Ah how unhappy., cry'd out
Cyrus, is the Condition of Kings !
They may lend themselves to Men
(you say) but not give themselves
absolutely to them. They will
never be acquainted then with the
Charms of Friendship. How much
is my Situation to be lamented, if
the Splendor of Royalty be inse

Calamities ?

c son, he may enjoy the Pleasures of

After these Reflections, Amenophh
continued his Story : ' I remain'd un
known, said he, some Years in my
Prison at Memphis. My Confine
ment was so close, that I could not
converse with, or see any Person.
Being thus left in Solitude, and
without any Comfort, I fufferd
the cruel Torments of tiresome
Loneliness. Man finds nothing
within himself but a frightful Void,
which renders him utterly discon
solate. His Happiness oftentimes
proceeds only from the Amuse
ments which hinder him from feel
ing his natural Insufficiency. I ar-

* One Day, when I was over
whelmed with the most melancholy
Reflections, I heard of a sudden a
Noise, as if somebody was open
ing a Way thro' the Wall of my
Prison. It was a Man who endea-
vour'd to make his Escape 5 and in
a sew Days he had made the Pas
sage wide enough to get into my
Chamber. This Prisoner, though
a Stranger, spoke the Egyptian
Tongue perfectly well. He inform'd
me, that he was of Tyre, his
Name Jrohal 5 that he had serv'd
jipries in the Cartan Troops, and
had been taken Prisoner at the same
time with me. I never saw a Man
of a more easy, witty, and agreeable

' self with Spirit, Delicacy, and

' without Repetition. We related to
' each other our Adventures and Mis-
1 fortunes. The Pleasure which I
' found in the Conversation of this
c Stranger, made me forget the Loss
1 of my Liberty.
c We were soon after releas'd from

All is the Effect of a Circulation
which connects, nourishes, and

Kind of Vegetables. We walk'd
with Pleasure among these Beauties,
unknown to the generality of Men 5
but, alas ! the Light of the Day was
wanting, and we could distinguish
nothing but by the Glimmering of
Lamps. We were already begin
ning to accustom ourselves to this
new kind of Misfortune., when
Heaven restor'd us to Liberty, by
a Stroke equally terrible and un
expected.

c The Subterraneous Fires some
times break their Prisons with a
Violence that seems to shake Na
ture even to its Foundations. We
frequently felt those terrible Con
vulsions. One Day the Shocks re
doubled, the Earth seem'd to groan.
We expected nothing but Death,
when the impetuous Fires open'd a
Passage into a spacious Cavern j
and that which seem'd to threaten
us with Loss of Life, procur'd us
Liberty.
c We walk'd a long time by the
Light of our Lamps before we
saw the Day 5 but at length the
subterraneous Passage ended at an
old Temple, which we knew to
have been consecrated to O/tris, by

* offer, nor any thing wherewith to
-' make Libations ; but instead of all
c Sacrifice, we made a solemn Vow
' for ever to love Virtue.
c This Temple was situated near
' the Arabian Gulf. We embark'd
' in a Vessel which was bound for
1 Nahata. We cross'd a great Part
c of Arabia Felix, and at length ar-
' riv'd at this Solitude. The Gods
1 seem to have conceal'd the most
' beautiful Places of the Earth, from
c those who know not how to prize
1 a Life of Peace and Tranquillity.
£ We found Men in these Woods and
: Forests of sweet and humane Difpo-
: sitions, full of Truth and Justice.

: among them. Arobal taught them
how to draw the Bow,and throw the

' mir'd the Motions of beautiful
' Nature, which we observ'd in them 5
c their unaffected Joy, their in-
1 genuous Simplicity., and their af-

1 We then saw that great Cities,and
magnificent Courts, have only serv'd
too much to corrupt the Manners and
Sentiments ofMankind $ and that by
uniting a Multitude of Men in the
same Place, they often do but unite
and multiply their Passions. We
thank'd the Gods for our being un-
deceiv'd with regard to those false
Pleasures, and even false Virtues,
both Political and Military, which
Self-love has introduc'd into nume
rous Societies, to deceive Men, and
make them Slaves to their Ambition.

c But, alas ! how weak and incon
stant is the Mind of Man. Arobal,
that virtuous, affectionate, and
generous Friend, who had supported
Imprisonment and Slavery with so
much Resolution, could not con
tent himself with a simple and uni
form Life. Having a Genius for
War, he sigh'd after great Exploits,
and being more a Philosopher in
Speculation than in Reality, con-
fess'd to me, that he could no lon
ger bear the Calm of Retirement :
He left me at last, and I have
never seen him since.
' I seem to myself a Being lest
alone upon the Earth. Apries uses
me ill, Amajis betrays me, Arobal
forsakes me. I find every where a
frightful Void. I know at present
the Value of Men. I experience '
that Friendship, the greatest of all
Felicities, is hard to be met with.

' theless I do not hate Men, but I
' cannot esteem them 5 I have a sin-
' cere Benevolence for them, and
' would do them good without hope
' of Recompence.'
While Cyrus was listening to this
Story} one might see upon his Coun
tenance the Sentiments and Passions,
which all these various Events should
naturally raise in him. He conceiv'd
a high Esteem for Amenophis, and
could not without Reluctance resolve
to leave him. \rn
In the mean while Arafpes was
preparing for their Departure. Cyrus,
before he took his leave of the Phi
losopher, said to him 5 ' Is I were
c born a private Man, I should think

ment. But Heaven destines me to
the Toils of Empire^ and I obey
its Orders, not so much methinks
to please my Ambition, as that I
may contribute to the Happiness of
my Country/ After this Cyrus
and Araspes continu'd their Way, and
cross'd the Country of the Salæam.
Araspes during their Journey, was
sometimes fad and thoughtful, which
Cyrus perceiving, ask'd him the Rea
son. Araspes answer'd, c You are a
Prince, I dare not speak my Heart
to you/ Let usforget the ^Prince,
said Cyrus, and converse like Friends.
Well then, said Araspes, I obey.

In this manner they discours'd to

of the Arabian Gulf^ where they em-
bark'd for Egypt.

The Cities of Egypt were numerous,
well Peopled, spacious, and full of
magnificent Temples, and stately
Palaces, adorn d with Statues and
Pillars.
Cyrus took a cursory View of all
these Beauties, and went afterwards
to fee the famous Labyrinth built by
the twelve Nomarchs. It was not a
single Palace, but twelve magnificent
Palaces regularly dispos'd. Three
thousand Chambers, which had a
Communication by Terrains, were
rang'd round twelve Halls 5 and
whoever enter'd there without a Guide,
could never find his Way out. There*
were as manyBuildings under Ground,
and these were allotted for the Burial-
Places of the Kings.
The Pavement of all these Apart
ments was of Marble, as likewise the
Walls, upon which were Carvings in
Bas-Relief, representing the History

1 60 The Travels of Cyrus.
of the Kings. The Princes who were
bury'd underneath, seem'd to live
again in these Sculptures. So that
the same Palace contain'd Monuments,
which set before Monarchs both their
Grandeur and their Nothingness.
Besides the Temples and Palaces
allotted for the Worship of the Gods,
and the Habitation of Mortals, there
were throughout all Egypt, and
especially near Memphis, Pyramids,
which serv'd for the Tombs of great
Men. This wise People thought it
proper to lodge the Dead as magni
ficently as the Living, in order to
immortalize Merit, and perpetuate
Emulation.
The most famous of these Pyra
mids was that of Hermes. It was of
polish'd Stone, and its Height more
than Six hundred Feet. Neither
Winds nor Earthquakes could injure
it. The Taste of the Egyptians was
more
The Travelso/ Cyrus i<5t
more for Solidity than Ornament.
Thro' each Door of this Pyramid was
an Entrance into seven Apartments,
call'd by the Names of the Planets.
In each of them was a golden Statue.
The biggest was in the Apartment of
the Sun, or OJiris. It had a Book
upon its Forehead, and its Hand upon
its Mouth. Upon the Outside of the
Book was written this Inscription,
/ must he read in a profound Silence\
to signify, say the Egyptian Priests^
that we cannot come to know the
Divine Nature, but by imposing
Silence upon the Senses and Imagina
tion.
Cyrus, after taking a View of all
these Wonders, apply'd himself to
learn the History, Policy, and Laws
of antient Egypt, which. were the
Model of those of Greece.
He found that the Egyptian Priests
had compil'd their History of an un-
Vol. I. M bounded

bounded Succession of Ages. They
took a Pleasure in losing themselves
in that infinite Abyss of Duration,
when Ofiris govern'd Mankind him
self. All the Fictions with which
they have fill'd their Annals, about
the Reign of the Gods and Demi-
Gods, are but Allegories to express
the first State of Souls before their
Descent into mortal Bodies.
According to them, Egypt was then
the favourite. Abode of the Gods,
and the Place of the Universe with
which they were most delighted.
After the Origin of Evil, and the
great Revolution which happen'd by
the Rebellion of the Monster Typhon,
they believ'd that their Country was
the least chang'd and disfigur'd of any.
Being watered by the Nile, it con
tinued fruitful,' while all Nature be
sides was barren. They look'd upon
Egypt as the Mother of Men and all
Animals.
Their

Their first King was nam'd Menes.
Their History from his Time is con-
fin'd within reasonable Bounds, and
is reduc'd to three Ages. The first,
from Menes to the Shepherd-Kings,
takes in Five hundred Years. The
second, from the Shepherd-Kings to
Sefoflris, is of the same Duration.
The third, from Sesojlris to Amajis,
contains six Centuries. *
During the first Age, Egypt was
divided into several Dynajlys, or
Governments, which had each its
King. Their principal Residences
were at Memphis, Thanh, This,
Elephantis, and Thebes. This last
Dynasty fwallow'd up all the rest,
and became Mistress. Egypt, in
those earliest Times, had no foreign
Commerce, but confin'd itself to
Agriculture and a Pastoral Life.

Shepherds were then Heroes, and
Kings Philoiophers. In those Days
lived the first Hermes, who pene
trated into all the Secrets of Nature,
and of Divinity. It was the Age of
occult Sciences. The Greeks, said the
Egyptians, imagine that the World
in its Infancy was ignorant 5 but
they think so, only because they them
selves are Children. * They know
nothing of the Origin of the World,
its Antiquity, and the Revolutions
which have happen'd in it. The
Men of Mercury's Time had yet a
Remembrance of their first State, and
had diverse traditional Lights which
we have lost. The Arts of Imitation,
Poesy, Musick, Painting, every thing
within the Province of the Imagina-
tion, are but Sports of the Mind,
in Comparison of the sublime Sciences
known by the first Men. Nature
was then obedient to the Voice of the
Sages. They could put all its hid-

den Springs in Motion. They pro-
duc'd the most amazing Prodigies
whenever they pleas'd. The Aerial
Genii were subject to them.* They
had frequent Intercourse with the
Ætherial Spirits, and sometimes with
the pure Intelligences that inhabit the
Empyreum. c We have lost, said
the Priests to Cyrus, this exalted
kind of Knowledge. We have
only remaining some Traces of it
upon our antient Obelisks, which
are, so to speak, the Registers of
our Divinity, Mysteries, and Tra
dition, relating to the Deity and to
Nature, and in no wise the Annals
of our Civil History, as the Igno
rant imagine.'
The second Age was that of the
Shepherd - Kings, who came from
Arabia. They over-ran Egypt with
Two hundred thousand Men. The
* Sec Iambliehus de mysteriis Æ^yptiorum.

\66 ^Travelso/Cyrus,
Barbarity of these unpolish'd and igno
rant Arabians, made the sublime and
occult Sciences be despis'd and forgot
ten. Their Imagination could re
ceive nothing but what was Material
and Sensible. From their Time the
Genius of the Egyptians was intirely
chang'd, and turn'd to the Study of
Arts, Architecture, Commerce, War,
and all the superficial kinds of Know
ledge, which are useless to those who
can content themselves with simple
Nature. It was then that Idolatry
came into Egypt. Sculpture, Paint
ing and Poesy obscur'd all pure Ideas,
and transformed them into sensible
Images. The Vulgar stop there,
without seeing into the hidden Mean
ing of the Allegories.
Some little time after this Invasion of
the Arabians, several Egyptians, who
could not support the Yoke of Fo
reigners, left their Country, and settled
themselves in Colonies in all Parts of
the
The Travelso/Cyrus. 1 6/
the World. From thence came all
the great and famous Men in other
Nations. The Babylonian Belus,
the Athenian Cecrops, the Bœotian
Cadmus. Thence it is, that all the
Nations of the Universe owe their
Laws, Sciences, and Religion to
Egypt. In this manner spoke the
Priests to Cyrus.
In this Age liv'd the second Her
mes, calYdTrismegiJlus. He was the
Restorer ofthe antient Religion. He
collected the Laws and Sciences of
the first Mercury, in Forty-two
Volumes, which were call'd, The
Treasure of Remedies for the Soul,
because they cure the Mind of its
Ignorance, the Source of all Evils.
The third Age was that of Con
quests and Luxury. Arts were per
fected more and more 5 Cities, Edi
fices, and Pyramids multiplied.
The Father of Sefojlris caus'd all the
M 4 Chil-
i68 The Travels of Cyrus.
Children who were born the same
Day with his Son, to be brought to
Court, and educated with the same
Care as the young Prince. Upon
the Death of the King, Sesojtris
levy'd a formidable Army, and ap
pointed the young Men who had
been educated with him, to be the
Officers to command it. There were
near Two thousand of them, who
were able to inspire all the Troops
with Courage, military Virtues, and
Attachment to the Prince. They
consider'd him both as their Master
and their Brother. He form'd a De
sign of conquering the whole World,
and penetrated into the Indies, far
ther than either Bacchus or Hercules.
The Scythians submitted to his Em
pire. Thrace and Jfia Minor are
full of the Monuments of his Victo
ries. Upon those Monuments are to
be seen the proud Inscriptions of,
Sesostris King of Kings, and Lord of
Lords. Having; extended his Con-
quests
The Travels of Cyrus. 160
quests from the Ganges to the Tianube,
and from the River Tanais to the
Extremities of Africa, he return'd
after Nine Years Absence, loaded with
the Spoils of all the concjuer'd Na
tions, and drawn in a Chariot by the
Kings whom he had fubdu'd.
His Government was altogether
Military and Despotical. He lessen'd
the Authority ofthe Pontiffs,and trans
fer'd their Power to the Commanders
of the Army. After his Death Divi
sions arose among those Chiefs.
They were become too powerful to
continue united under one Master.
Under Anijis the Blind, Sabacon the
Ethiopian took Advantage of their
Discords, and invaded Egypt. This
Religious Prince re-establifh'd the
Power of the Priests, reign'd fifty
Years in a profound Peace, and then
return'd into his own Country, to
obey the Oracles of his Gods. The
Kingdom thus forsaken, fell into the
Hands
170 ^TuAVELS o/CyRUS.
Hands of Sethon the High-Priest of
Vulcan, who entirely destroyed the
Art of War among the Egyptians,
and despised the Military Men. The
Reign ofSuperstition, which enfeebles
Courage, succeeded that of despotick
Power, which had too much depress'd
it. From that time Egypt was sup
ported only by foreign Troops, and
it fell by degrees into Anarchy.
Twelve Nomarchs, chosen by the
People, shar'd the Kingdom between
them. One of them, named 'Pfam-
metichus, made himself Master of all
the rest. Egyptrecover'd itselfa little,
and continued pretty powerful for five
or six Reigns • till at length this an-
tient Kingdom became tributary to
Nahuchodonofbr King ofBabylon.
The Conquests of Sesojlris were
the Source of all these Calamities.
Princes who are insatiable of Con
quering, are Enemies to their Posterity.
By seeking to extend their Dominion
too
The Travels of Cyrus. 171
too far, they sap the Foundation of
their Authority.
From that time the antient Laws
were no longer in Force. Cyrus col
lected the Principal of them from his
Conversation with all the great Men
and old Sages who were then living.
These Laws are reduced to three,
upon which all the rest depend.
The First relates to Kings, the Second
to Polity, and the Third to Civil
Justice.
The Kingdom was Hereditary,
but the Kings were obliged to observe
the Laws with greater Exactness than
others. The Egyptians esteemed it a
criminal Usurpation upon the Rights
of the Great Ofiris, and as a mad
Presumption in a Man to give his
Will for a Law.
As soon as the King rose in the
Morning, which was at the Break of
Day,
17* The Tft-Av els os Cyrus.
Day, when the Understanding is
clearest, and the Soul most serene, an
exact: and distinct: Idea was given him
of all Matters upon which he was to
decide that Day. But before he
pronounc'd Judgment, he went to
the Temple to invoke the Gods, and
to offer Sacrifice. Being there, sur
rounded by all his Court, and the
Victims standing at the Altar, he
assisted at a Prayer, full ofInstruction 5
the Form of which was as follows :
' Great Osiris ! Eye of the World,
* and Light ofSpirits I Grant to the
c 'Prince, your Image, all Royal
* Virtues, that he may he religious
' towards the Gods , and benign
c towards Men 5 moderate, just ,

1 After
The Travels of Cyrus. 173
After this, the High-Priest repre
sented to him the Faults he had com
mitted against the Laws 5 but it was
always suppos'd that he fell into them
by Surprize, or through Ignorance 5
and the Ministers, who had given
him evil Counsels, or had disguis'd
the Truth, were loaded with Impre
cations.
After the Prayer and the Sacrifice,
they read to him the Actions of the
Heroes and great Kings, that the
Monarch might imitate their Example,
and maintain the Laws which had
render'd his Predecessors illustrious,
and their People happy.
What is there that might not be
hop'd for from Princes accustom'd,
as an essential Part of their Religion,
to hear Daily the strongest and most
salutary Truths ? Accordingly, the
greater Number of them were so dear
to
174 The Travels os Cyrus.
to their People, that each private
Man bewail'd their Death like that of
a Father.
The Second Law related to Polity,
and the Subordination of Ranks.
The Lands were divided into three
Parts. The First was the King's
Domain 5 the Second belong'd to the
Chief Priests 5 and the Third to the
Military Men. For it scem'd absurd
to employ Troops for the Defence of
a Country, who had no Interest in
its Preservation.
The common People were divided
into three Classes, Husbandmen,
Shepherds, and Artizans. These
three Sorts made great Improvements,
each in their Professions: Being
brought up to them from Generation
to Generation, they made Advantage
of the Experience of their Ancestors.
Each Family transmitted its Know
ledge and Skill to the Children of it.
2 No
tshe Travels os Cyrus. 175
No Person was allow'd to go out of
his Rank, or to forsake his hereditary-
Employment. By this means Arts
were cultivated and brought to a
great Perfection $ and the Troubles,
occasion'd by the Ambition of those
who seek to rise above their natural
Condition, were prevented.
To the End that no Person might
be asham'd of the Lowness of his State
and Degree, Arts were held in Honour.
In the Body Politick, as in the Na
tural, all the Members contribute
something to the common Life. It
seem'd a Madness in Egypt to despise
a Man because he serves his Country
in a more laborious Employment.
And thus was a due Subordination of
Ranks preferv'd, without Envy in one
Sort, or Contempt in the other.
The Third Law regarded Civil
Justice. Thirty Judges, drawn out
of the principal Cities, compos'd the
supreme

supreme Council, which judg'd the
Kingdom. The Prince assign d them
Revenues sufficient to free them from
Domestic Cares, that they might
give their whole Time to the compo
sing good Laws, and making them
be observ'd. They had no further
Profit of their Labours 5 except the
Glory and Pleasure of serving their
Country in the noblest Way.
To avoid. Surprize in giving Judg
ment, the Pleaders were forbidden
that delusive Eloquence,which dazzles
the Understanding, and moves the
Passions. They expos'd the Matters
of Fact: with a clear and nervous
Brevity, stript of the false Orna
ments of Reasoning. The President
of the Senate wore a Collar of Gold
and. precious Stones, at which hung
a small Figure without Eyes, which
was call'd Truth. He apply'd it to
the Forehead and Heart of him who
was to gain his Cause 5 for that was
the
The Travels of Cyrus. 177
the Manner of pronouncing Judg
ment.
There was in Egypt a fort of
Justice unknown to other Nations.
As soon as a Man had yielded his last
Breath, he was brought into Judg
ment, and the publick Accuser was
heard against him. In cafe it ap-
pear'd that the Behaviour of the De-
ceas'd had been contrary to the Laws,
his Memory was branded, and he
was refus'd Burial, if he was not
accus'd of any Grime against the
Gods, or his Country, his Pane-
gyrick was made, and he was en-
tomb'd honourably.
Before he was carry'd to the
Sepulchre, his Bowels were taken
out, and put into an Urn 5 which
the Pontiff raising towards the Sun,
made this Prayer in the Name of the
Deceas'd *.

nounc'dthese last Words., he threw the
Urn into the River -, and the rest of
the Body, (which was embalm'd)
was deposited in the Pyramids.
Such were the Notions of the an-
tient Egyptians. Being full of the
Hopes of Immortality, they imagin'd
that human Frailties were expiated
by our Separation from the mortal

committed against the Gods and
Society, hinder'd the Soul from being
re-united to its Origin.
. These Things gave Cyrus a great
Desire to instruct himself throughly
in the Religion of antient Egypt.
For this Purpose he went to Thebes.
This famous City, whose hundred
Gates have been fung by Homer■,
might dispute with all the Cities in
the Universe for Magnificence, Ex-
, tent and Power. 'Tis said, that it
was able heretofore, to march out of
each of its Gates Ten thousand fight
ing Men. Doubtless there is some
thing ofpoetical Fiction in this, but all
agree that its Inhabitants were exceed
ingly numerous. - .

Country. Sonchis conducted him
into a spacious Hall, where were
three hundred Statues of Egyptian
Pontiffs. This long Succession for so
many Ages, gave the Prince a high
Notion of the Antiquity of the
Religion of Egypt, and a great Cu
riosity taknow the Principles of it.

* I must give you the History of
' Hermes Trifmegijlus, who was the
c Founder of them.
1 Hermes, the second of the Name,
was of the Race of our first Sove
reigns. While his Mother was
with Child of him, {he went by
Sea to Libya, to make a Sacrifice
to 'Jupiter Hammon. As she coast
ed along Africa, a sudden Storm
arose, and the Vessel perifli'd near
a Desart Island. She was, by a

' cast upon the Island all alone.
* There she liv'd a solitary Life, un-
* til her Delivery, at which Time she
' died. The Infant remain'd expos d
* to the Inclemency of the Weather,
' and the Fury of the wild Beasts :
* But Heaven, which intended him
* for great Purposes , preserv'd

c which there were great Plenty in

* and suckled him till he was past In-

c on the tender Grafs, with his Nurse,
c but afterwards upon Dates and
c wild Fruits, which seemed to him
c a more proper Food.

He compar'd all he saw in her with
what he felt in himself, and per-
ceiv'd that he had a Beating in his

her. He saw her by Degrees pu-

' ture seem'd to languish in the Ab-
' sence of the Day. He concluded
' therefore, That the Stars 'were not
x thefirji 'Principles of Life.
1 As he advanced in Age, his Un-
* derstanding ripen'd, and his Re
flections became more profound.
i He had remark'd, that inanimate
Bodies could not move of them
selves 5 that Animals did not re?
store Motion to themselves when
they had lost it, and that the Sun
did not revive dead Bodies.
1 Thence he concluded, That the
First Mover was something
greater than the Sun or the
Stars.
c Reflecting afterwards upon him
self, and upon all the Remarks
which he had made from the first
Use of his Reason, he observ'd,
1That
The Travels of Cyrus, 185
* That there was something in him
' which felt, which thought, and
* which compared his Thoughts to-
c gether. After having meditated
' whole Years upon all those Opera-
* tions of his Mind, he concluded at
c length, That the First: Mover had

4 Mankind liv'd then without Dis
cord, Ambition, or Luxury, in a
perfect: Peace, Equality, and Sim
plicity. Each Man, however,
had his particular Qualities and
Passions 5 but all Passions were sub
servient to the Love of Virtue 5

were the Diversion, Enter

rality. This has been the Method
of the Sages in all Times, and of
the great Legislators in all Coun
tries. These divine Men knew,
that corrupted Minds could not re

Cyrus understood by this History
of Hermes, that the O/iris, Orus,
and Typhon of the Egyptians, were
the same with the Oromazes, My*'
thras, and Arimanius of the 'Per-

two Nations was founded upon the
same Principles, and express'd the
fame Ideas by different Names.
After Sonchis had entertained

that the Sun cannot draw them up

Then they reason'd upon the Eb

is only discernable in the great Oce^
of the Influence of the Moon which
causes those regular Motions, and of
the Distance and Magnitude of that

After some Days sailing, the Ves

soon arrived at Epidaurus, from
whence the Prince made haste to get
to Sparta.
This famous City was of a circular
Form, and resembled a Camp.

It was situated in a wild and
barren Valley $ the Eurotas flow'd
through it, and often laid waste
the whole Country by its Inunda

one side by inaccessible Mountains,
and on the other by little Hills,
which were stor'd, not with those
Riches which are the Beauties of Na
ture, but with every thing that is *
necessary to supply Mens Wants,
The Situation of the Country had
contributed very much to the Warlike
and Savage Genius of its Inhabitants.
As Cyrus enter'd the City, he beheld
only plain and uniform Buildings,
very different from the stately Palaces
he had seen in Egypt. Every thing
still spoke the primitive Simplicity of
the Spartam. But their Manners
were upon the Point of being cor

with the Egyptians. He put on all
Shapes by turns 5 not to deceive (for
he was not wicked) but to gratify his
prevailing Passion, which was the
Desire of Pleasing, and of being the
Idol of Men. In a Word, he was a

all Sorts of Voluptuousness. The

entertain'd Suspicions of the best Of

of his Generals, a Man of strict Pro

Leonidas lov'd Virtue sincerely, but
had not enough of it to bear with
the Faults of others. He despis'd
Men too much, and was regardless
both of their Praises and Favours.
He humdur'd neither Princes, nor
their Courtiers. His Hatred of Vice
render'd his Manners fierce and savage,
like those of the first Spartans. He
look'd for Perfection in every thing 5
and as he never found it, he had no
intimate Friendship with any Person.

banish'd him. Thus did this Prince
weaken the Strength of Sparta, while
Arijlon corrupted his Manners.
Chilo, who had educated the two
young Princes, went and spoke to
them in the following Manner :

to you with Freedom. You both

To give Cyrus & living Represen

him to the Council of Senators, in
stituted by Lycurgus.
* Before thatLegislator's Time, the
Kings of Sparta had been absolute. But
Eurytion, one of those Kings, having
yielded some Part of his Prerogatives
to please the People, a Republican
Party was thereupon form'd, which
became audacious and turbulent.

would not suffer it5 and this con

To establish an even Ballance of
the Kings and Peoples Powers which
lean'd alternately to Tyranny and
Anarchy, Lycurgus instituted a Coun
cil of Twenty eight Senators 5 whose
Authority being in a Mean betwixt
the two Extremes, deliver'd Sparta
from its domestick Dissensions.
Thirty Years after him, 'Theo-
pompus having observ'd, that what
had been resolv'd by the Kings
and their Council, was not always
agreeable to the Multitude, establisti'd
certain annual Magistrates, call'd
Ephori, who were chosen by the
People, and consented in their
Name to whatever was deter-
min'd by the King and Senate.
Each private Man look'd upon these
unanimous Resolutions as made by
himself. And in this Union of the
Head with the Members, consisted
the Life of the Body Politick at
Sparta.
Cyrus
The Travels o/Cyrus^ 213
Cyrus saw the two Kings sitting in
their supreme Council, which was
held in a Hall hung with Matt, that
the Magnificence of the Place might
not divert the Senators Attention.
This Council of about forty Persons,
was not liable to the Tumult and
Confusion which frequently reign'd in
the Consultations of the People at
Athens,
After Lycurgus had regulated the
Form of the Government, he gave
the Spartans such Laws as were pro
per to prevent the Disorders occasions
by Avarice, Ambition, and Love.
In order to expel Luxury and
Envy from Sparta, he resolv'd to
banish for ever, both Riches and
Poverty. He persuaded his Country
men to make an equal Distribution
of all their Wealth, and of all their
Lands j decry'd the Use of Gold and

Silver, and ordain'd that they should
have only Iron Money, which was
not current in foreign Countries. He
chose rather to deprive the Spartans
of the Advantages ofCommerce with
their Neighbours, than to expose
them to the Misfortune of bringing
home from other Nations, those In
struments of Luxury which might
corrupt them.
To prevent the Ambition of
private Men, and to fix and strengthen
an Equality among the Citizens, they
ate together in Publick Halls, but
separate. Each Company had Li
berty to choose its own Guests. No
one was admitted there but with the
Consent of all 5 to the End, that
Peace might not be disturb'd by Dif
ference or Humours 5 a necessary Pre
caution for Men naturally fierce and

Cyrus went into these Publick
Halls, where the Men were seated
without any Distinction but that of
their Age. They were surrounded
by Children, who waited on them.
Their Temperance and Austerity of
Life was so great, that other Nations
used to say, It was better to die,
than to live like the Spartans. During
the Repast, they discours'd together
on grave and serious Matters 5 the
Interests of their Country, the Laws
of Sparta, the Lives of the Great
Men, the Difference of a good and
bad Citizen, and of whatever might
form Youth to the Taste of military
Virtues. Their Discourse contain'd
much Sense in sew Words 5 for which
Reason the Laconick Style has been
admir'd in all Nations. By imitating
the Rapidity of Thought, it gave the
Pleasure of hearing all in a Moment,
and of discovering a profound Mean

graceful, fine and delicate Turns of
the Athenians were unknown at
Lacedamon. The Spartans were for
Strength in the Mind as well as in
the Body.
Upon a Solemn Festival, Cyrus and
Arajpes desir'd to be present at the As
semblies of the young Lacedæmonians,
which were held within a large In
closure, surrounded with diverse Seats
of Turf rais'd one above another, in
Form of an Amphitheatre. There
theybeheld young Girls., almost naked,
contending with Boys in Running,
Wrestling, Dancing, and all Sorts of
laborious Exercises. The Boys were
not permitted to marry any but such
as they had vanquish'd at these
Games.
Cyrus was fhock'd to fee the
Liberty, which reign'd in these Pub-
lick Assemblies, between Persons of
different Sexes 5 and could not
forbear representing it to Chilo.

Lycurgus. His Aim was to have

nevertheless, he has not been afraid
to expose them to Sensuality, which
may weaken their Courage.

Here Cyrus, struck with a lively
Remembrance of Cajfandana, and of
the pure Pleasures of their mutual

an Abhorrence of these odious Ma

he could not relish the Spartan
Roughness, which sacrific'd the sweet

and knew not how toreconcile military
Virtues with tender Passions. How
ever, as he was sensible that Chilo
would little understand what he
meant by such Sentiments, he con

In reality, great Care was taken of
the Education of Children at Sparta*
They were chiefly taught to obey,
to undergo Labour, to conquer in
Combats, and to face Pain and Death
with Courage. They went with
their Heads and Feet naked, lay up
on Rushes, and ate very little 5 and
this little they were obliged to procure
by Dexterity, in the publick Banquet
ing Rooms. Not that the Spartans
authorized Thefts and Robberies 5 for
as all was in common in this Repub
lics those Vices could have no
Place there : But the Design was
to accustom Children, who were de
stin'd for War, to surprize the Vigi
lance of those who watch'd over
them, and to expose themselves cou
rageously to the severest Punishments,
iri case they fail'd of that Dexterity
which was exacted of them.

to spoil the Understanding, and cor

made little Account of them. No
shing, however, was neglected, to
awaken in Children the Taste of
pure Reason, and to give them a
Strength ofJudgment 5 but all Kinds
of Studies, which were not ser
viceable togood Manners, were look'd
upon as useless and dangerous Occu

Gymnafes, where the Youth did their

verse Nations, whose Strength was in
their Union.
The Spartans employ'd themselves
in no sort of Labour but these Exer
cises. The Helots, who were their
Slaves, manur'd their Lands, and
were the only Mechanicks among
them: For they esteem'd it a vileThing

This Discourse rais'd in Cyrus a
Curiosity to know the military Dis
cipline of the Spartans, and he signi
fy'd it to Chilo. The next Day the
Kings of Sparta order'd Leonidas to
assemble the Lacedæmonian Trobps in
a spacious Plain near the City, that
they might pass in Review before
Cyrus, and let him see the Exercifi
in use among the Greeks.

Leonidas appear'd in a military
Dress. His Cask was adorn'd with
three Birds, of which that in the
Middle was the Crest. Upon his
Cuirass was the Head of Medusa,
All the Attributes of the God Mars
were represented upon his Shield,
which was a Hexagon 5 and he held
in his Hand a Staff of Command.
Cyrus and Jrajpes, being mount
ed upon two proud Steeds, rode out
of the City with the Spartan Gene
ral, who knowing how fond the
Prince was of Instruction, entertain'd
him in the Way, after the following
Manner :
c Greece is divided into several
c Republicks, each of which main-
c tains an Army in Proportion to its
' Extent. We do not affect to bring
1 prodigious Armies into the Field,
t like the Jsiatkks, but to have

c well-disciplin'd Troops. Numerous
i Bodies are difficult to manage, and
c are too expensive to a State. Our
* invariable Rule is to encamp so,
c that we may never be oblig'd to
fight against our Will. A small
Army, well practis'd in War, may,
by entrenching itself, oblige a very
numerous one to disperse its Troops,
which would otherwise soon be de
stroys for Want of Provisions.
' When the common Cause of
Greece is to be defended, all these
separate Bodies unite, and then no
State dares attack us. At Lacedæmon
all the Citizens are Soldiers. In the
other Republicks, all forts of Peo
ple are not promiscuously admitted
into the Soldiery, but the best Men
are chosen out for the Army, such as
are bold, robust, in the Flower of
their Age, and inur'd to laborious
Exercises. The Qualities reejuir'd

pass before Cyrus. They were di
vided into diverse Bodies of Horse
and Foot. At their Head were the
ipolemarchi, and the Commanders of
the several Corps. They all march'd
with the Sound of Flutes, their Heads
crown'd with Flowers, and singing
the Hymn of Cajlor. They were
cloath'd in Red, that in the Heat of
Action the Sight of their own Blood
might not terrify them, or alarm their
Companions. *

soever I have for Lycurgm, I can
not admire this Form of Govern
ment. Men educated only for
War, who have no other Exercise,
Study, or Profession, but to make
themselves able and dexterous in
destroying other Men, ought to be (
look'd upon as Enemies to Society.
Good Policy ought to provide, not
only for the Liberty of each State,
but for the common Security of all
the neighbouring ones. To set
ourselves loose from the rest of
Mankind, to look upon ourselves

all Nations against us. 'Tis here

and at length stopt at Corinth, which
was the most flourishing Republick
of Greece, after those of Sparta and
Athens.
As he enter'd the Town, he beheld
all the People in Mourning. Several
Players upon Flutes marched ac
the Head of a Funeral Procession,
and increas'd the publick Sorrow by
their plaintive Sounds. A Company
of young Girls bare-footed, their Hair
dishevel'd, and cloathed in long
white Robes, surrounded the Bier,
and melted into Tears when they
fung the Praises of the Dead. A little
after follow'd the Soldiers, with a slow
Pace, a sorrowful Air, their Pikes
revers'd, and their Eyes upon the
Ground. At their Head march'd a
venerable old Man. His noble and
military Air, his tall and majestick
Stature, and the bitter Grief that was
painted upon his Face, drew the At
tention of Cyrus. The young Prince

having ask'd his Name, understood
that it was King <Periander, who
was conducting his Son Lycophron to
his Tomb. ■ t
Cyrus and Arafpes join'd them
selves with the Crowd, which was
going to a Fortress call'd Acrocorin-
thus. It was built upon the Summit
of a high Mountain, from whence
might be seen a vast Extent of Coun
try, together with the Ægean and
Ionian Seas 5 for which Reason it was
calFd the Eye of Greece.
Being come to the Fortress, which
was the Burial Place of the Kings,
'Periander, first of all, pour'd Wine,
Milk, and Honey upon the Body of
his Son. He then lighted with his
own Hands the Funeral Pile, upon
which had been strew'd Incense,
Aromatick Spices, and sweet Odors.
He remain'd mute, immoveable,
and with his Eyes drown'd in Tears,
while

while the devouring Flames con
sumed the Body. After having
sprinkled the yet smoaking Ashes with
perfum'd Liquors, he gathered them
together into a Golden Urn 5 and
then making a Sign to the People
that he was going to speak, he thus
broke Silence. ' 'People of Corinth,
6 the Gods themselves have taken Care
1 to revenge you of my Usurpation,
* and to deliver you from Slavery.
' Lycophron is dead. My whole
* Race is extinff, and I will reign no
c longer. Countrymen, resume your
* Rights and your Liberties.'
As soon as he had laid these Words,
he order'd all the Assembly to retire,
cue off his Hair to denote his Sorrow,
and (hut himself up in the Tomb
with his Son. This Event gave Cy-
vus a great Desire to know the Cause
of it, and he received the following
Account :

that this famous City had chang'd its
Form of Government, which was

the Saronic Gulph, widening by-
Degrees, open'd a Prospect of several
Islands which seem'd to float upon
the Waves. At a greater Distance

lose themselves in the Clouds, while

which extended itself upon the De
clivity of a Hill. The numerous
Buildings rose one above another,
and their different Structure shew'd
the different Ages of the Republick 5
its first Simplicity in the heroick Ages,
and its rising Magnificence in the Time
of Solon. In one Part might be seen

cover'd the warlike and rustick Taste
ofantient Times. The River Ilijsus,
which flow'd near the City, and
winded through the Meadows, added
a thousand natural Beauties to those
of Art.
It was in this agreeable Place that
Cyrus desir'd Solon to give him an
Idea of the State of Greece, and par
ticularly of Athens. He thought it
would please the old Man, to furnish
him with an Opportunity of recount
ing the Services he had done his
Country 5 and the wise Lawgiver
satisfy'd his Curiosity in the following
manner :

selves several Cities, and from those
Cities came Hercules, Theseus,
Minos, and all those first Heroes, to
whom Divine Honours are given, in
order to (hew that Virtue can be
rewarded only in Heaven.
' Egypt first inspir'd the Greeks,
with a Taste for Arts and Sciences,
initiated them into her Mysteries,
and gave them both Gods and
Laws. Greece being thus civiliz'd,
sorm'd itself by Degrees into several
Republicks. The supreme Council
of the Amphitfyones, compos'd of
the Deputies of the principal Cities,
united them all in the same View,
which was, to preserve Indepen-
dance Abroad, and Union at
Home.

c Wisdom and Virtue have their

* Among all these Republicks,
' Athens and Lacedæmon are with-

* Character of Athens is graceful Wit,
* refin'd Politeness, all the amiable
* and conversable Virtues. That
' of the Spartans is Magnanimity,
* Temperance, military Virtue,
* and Reason stripe of all Orna-
' ment. The Athenians love the
' Sciences and Pleasures : Their great
' Propensity is to Voluptuousness.

Athenians took this Occasion to

and declared Jupiter sole King of

Yoke of all settled Authority.
' In the Place of the Kings, they
created perpetual Governors, under
the Name of Archons 5 but this
being an Image of Royalty,
appear'd odious. That they might
not leave so much as a Shadow of
Regal Power, they establish'd De

Humour was not yet satisfy'd.
They reduc'd the Duration of these
Magistracies to one Year, that they
might the oftner take into their

' So limited a Power was but ill
qualify'd to keep such restless Spirits
within Bounds. Factions, In

Laws in his Hand, would dispute
about the Sense of them. The
Men of the most lively Imagina

and the most apt to create Broils.
They think every thing due to their
superficial Talents. Under pretence
that all Men are born equal, they

and preach up a chimerical Equality,
only that they themselves may get

soon gave me a Disgust for a loose
and disorderly Life.

' it, and apply'd myself to cure

* The first Source of all those
Evils, was the excessive Power of
the People. Monarchical Autho
rity, moderated by a Senate, was
the primitive Form of Government
in all wise Nations. I was desi
rous to imitate Lycurgus in the
Establishment of it., but was too
well acquainted with the natural
Temper of my Countrymen, to
undertake it. I knew that if they suf

Sovereign Power, they would soon

1 lence. I therefore contented my-
1 self with setting Bounds to it.
1 I was throughly sensible, that
no State can subsist without some
Subordination. I distributed the
People into four Classes, and chose
an hundred Men out of each
Class, whom I added to the Council
of Areopagus. I shew'd these
Chiefs, that sovereign Authority,
of what Kind soever, is but a ne
cessary Evil, for preventing greater
Evils 5 and that it ought only to
be employ'd to restrain Mens Pas
sions. I represented to the People
the Mischiefs they had suffer'd by
giving themselves up to their own
Fury. By this Means, I dispos'd the
one, to command with Moderation 5
and the other, to obey with Rea
diness.
I caused

c I caused those to be punish'd se-
c verely, whotaught, That allMen are
' horn equal 5 that Merit only ought
' to regulate Ranks 5 and that the
1 greatest Merit a Man can have is
* Wit. I made them sensible of the
c fatal Consequences of such false
c Maxims.
' I prov'd to them, that the natu-
c ral Equality., ^which those Men
1 talk'd of, is a Chimera, founded
' upon the Poetical Fables of the
' Companions of Cadmus, and the
c Children of T)eucalion 5 that there
i never was a Time, in which Men
' rose in that Manner out of the
c Earth, in a State of perfect Man-
' hood 5 that it was ridiculous to
' offer the Sports of the Imagination
' for Principles 5 that ever since the
' Golden Age, the Oder of Gene-

c among Men : And lastly, that pa-
* ternal Authority had been the first
* Model of all Governments.
1 I made a Law, by which ic
' was ordained, That every Man

1 Imagination, florid 'Discourses, and
c the Talent of Talking upon all Sub-
1 jefis, without going to the Bottom
1 of any Thing, Jhould be incapable
c of publick Employments.'
Here Cyrus interrupted Solon, and
said to him, ' But aster all, methinks
* Merit is what ought to make the
' Distinction among Men. Wit is
' the lowest Sort of Merit, because
c it is always dangerous when alone :
* But Wisdom, Virtue, and Valour,

Sovereignty and Ranks are necessary
Evils to keep the Passions within
Bounds. The lower Sort ought
to be content with meriting the in
ternal Esteem of Men, by their
simple and modest Virtue 5 and
the Great should be persuaded that
nothing but outward Homage will
be paid thenr, unless they have true
Merit. By this Means, the one
Sort will not be dejected with their
low Condition 5 nor the other
pride themselves too much, in their
Grandeur. Men will become sen
sible, that Kings are necessary 5 and
Kings will not forget, that they are
Men. Each Man will keep him
self within his own Sphere, and the
Order of Society will not be di
sturbs. I see clearly the Beauty
of this Principle, and am very im
patient to know your other Laws.

4 The second Source of the
Miseries of Athens, said Solon, was
the excessive Riches of some,
and the extreme Poverty os
others. This terrible Inequality in
a popular Government, occafion'd
eternal Disorders. I durst not at
tempt to remedy this Disorder, by
establishing a Community of Goods
as at Sparta. The Genius of the
Athenians, which carries them to
Luxury and Pleasures, would never
have suffered such an Equality : But
in order to diminish our Evils, I
abolish'd all Debts 5 I began by
remitting those which were due to
me. I enfranchis'd all my Slaves,
and forbad any one for the future,
to pledge his Liberty for what he
borrow'd.
c I never tasted so much Pleasure,
as in relieving the Miserable. I
retain d enough for my own Per-
' son,
The Travels of Cyrus 275
son, and was therefore rich 5 but
I esteem'd my self poor,because I had
not sufficient to distribute something
to all the Unfortunate. I spread
abroad at Athens this useful Maxim,
That all the Members of the fame
Commonwealth ought to feel and
compassionate the Miseries of one
another, as Tarts of the fame
Body.
c The third Source of our Miff
chiefs, was the Multiplicity of
Laws, which is as evident a Token
of the Corruption of a State, as
a Diversity of Medicines is of the
Distempers of Bodies.
* Here again I could not imitate
Lycurgus. Community of Goods,
and an Equality of all the Mem
bers of a Republick, render use
less a great many Laws and Forms,
which are absolutely necessary,
where there is an Inequality of
T 2 ' Ranks

Ranks and Property. I contented
my self with abolishing all those
Laws, which serv'd only to exer
cise the subtle Genius of the So
phists, and the Skill of the Law
yers 5 reserving only a small Num
ber of such as were simple, short,
and clear. By this Means I avoid
ed contentious Chicane, that Mon
ster, produc'd by the idle Subtlety
of Men, to elude Justice. I fix'd
certain Times for the final Deter
mination of . Law-Suits, and or-
dain'd severe and disgraceful Pu
nishments for the Magistrates, who
should lengthen them beyond the
Bounds prefcrib'd. Lastly, I abo-
lifh'd the too severe Laws of 2)raco,
which punilh'd the smallest Weak
ness, and the greatest Crime, equally
with Death, and I proportion'd the
Punishment to the Offence.
e
c The fourth Source of Evils.,
was the bad Education of Chil-
1 dren.
The Travels of Cyrus. %y;
dren. None but superficial Qua
lities, Wit, bright Imagination, and
Gallantry, were cultivated in young
Persons. The Heart, Reason, no
ble Sentiments, and solid Virtues,
were neglected. The Value, both
of Men and Things, was rated
by Appearances, and not by Rea
lity. The Athenians were serious
about Trifles, and look'd upon
solid Matters as too abstracted.
' In order to prevent these Mis
chiefs., I ordain'dthat the Council of
Areopagus should super-intend the
Education of Children. I would
not have them educated in such
Ignorance, as the Spartans, nor
confin'dj as before, to the Study
of Eloquence, Poesy, and those
Sciences, which serve only to adorn
the Imagination. I would have
them apply their Thoughts to all
those Kinds of Knowledge which

portion of Numbers, the Calcula
tion of the Cœlestial Motions, the
Structure of the Universe, the great
Art of knowing how to mount up

Consequences, and to open the
whole Chain of Truths.
* These speculative Sciences never
theless, serve only to exercise and
cultivate the Mind, in the Time of
Youth. The Athenians, in a riper
Age, apply themselves to the Study
of the Laws, Policy, and History,
to learn the Revolutions of Empires,
the Causes of their Rife, and the
Occasions of their Fall 5 in a Word,
to every Thing which may con
tribute to the Knowledge of Man,
and of Men.
' The

c The fifth and last Source of our
' Evils, was an unbridled Taste for
' Pleasures. I knew that the Genius
* of the Athenians required Amuse-
c ments and publick Shews. I was
* sensible that I could not subdue
- those Republican and untractable
* Souls, but by making use of their
* Inclination towards Pleasure, to
' captivate and instruct: them.
' In the publick Shews, I caused
c to be represented the fatal Conse-

' all the Vices prejudicial to Society.
1 By this Means, multitudes of Men,
' assembled in the fame Place, were
f induced to spend whole Hours in
c hearing Lessons of a sublime Mora-
' lity. They would have been difi-

Lycurgus found, in his Spartans,
a Genius, apt to all heroick Virtues.
I found, in the Athenians, a Bent
towards all the Vices, which make
Men effeminate. I will venture to
fay, that the Laws of Sparta, by
carrying the Virtues to an Extreme,
transform them into Faults. My
Laws, on the contrary, tend to

* Policy can do. It does not change
1 Mens Hearts 5 it only restrains their
' Passions.
* I thought, continu'd Solon, to
have prevented, or remedied, the
greatest Part of our Evils, by the
Establishment of these Laws 5 but
the Restlessness of a People, accu-
stom'd to Licentiousness, occasions
me daily Vexations. Some blam'd
my Regulations 5 others pretended
not to understand them: Some were
for making Additions to them 3
others for retrenching them. I per-
ceiv'd then how useless the most
excellent Laws are, without a
fix'd and stable Authority, to put
them in Execution. How unhappy
is the Lot of Mortals ! By endea

of popular Government, they run

however found Means to cause an
Insurrection, and the Fury of the
People rose to such a Heights that
they set Fire to my Palace in the
Night. I ran to the Appartment
of 'Phya, but it was already con
sumed by the Flames, and I had
but just Time enough to save my
self, with my Son Hippias. I
escap'd in the Dark, and fled to the
Island of Salamts, where I con-
ceal'd myself for two whole Years.
I doubted not but that Phya had

more than the Loss of my Crown.

• In order to engage the Atheni
ans to come into our Measures, we
had recourse to Religion, and cor
rupted the Priests of Minerva. I
left the Island of SaJamis 5 but
before I enter'd Athens, I stopt ac
a Temple, some Furlongs from
the City : There I found Megacles,
who waited for me, with divers
Senators, and a Crowd of People.
Sacrifices were offer'd _, and the
Entrails of the Victims examine!,
upon which the High-Priest declar
ed in the Name of the Goddess,
that her City cou'd not be happy
but by restoring me 5 whereupon
I was crown'd with Solemnity. The
better to impose upon the People,
Megacles chose out, from among
the young PriestefTes,her who was of
< the

the most Majestick Stature. She
was arm'd like the Daughter of
Jupiter, the dreadful Ægis was
upon her Breast, and she held in
her Hand a shining Lance 5 but her
Face was veil'd. I seated myself
with her in a Triumphal Chariot,
and we were conducted to the Ci
ty : Trumpeters and Heralds went
before, and cried with a loud
Voice, 'People of Athens, Receive
Pisistratus, whom Minerva, resolv
ing to honour above all other Mor
tals, brings back to you by her
Priestess.
* The Gates of the Town were
immediately open'd, and we werjt
directly to the Fortress, where my
Marriage was to be celebrated.
The Priestess stept down from her
Chariot, and taking me by the
Hand, led me into the Inner-Ap-
partment of the Palace. As soon
as we were alone, (he took off her

Account of her escaping the
Flames, of the Search {he had
made for me, the Report that had
been spread abroad of my Death,
and of her retiring to the Temple
of Minerva.
1 Megacles, seeing all his Projects
disconcerted, employ'd his Thoughts
to dispossess me again. He persuaded
himself that I had acted in con
cert with cPhya to deceive him by
false Hopes. He spread a Rumour
at Athens, that I had corrupted the
Pontiff, and had employ'd Reli
gion to impose upon, and abuse, the
People. They rose in Arms against

Country, till being discover'd and
persecuted by Megacles, I retir'd
into the Island of Naxos. I en-
ter'd into the Temple of 'Pallas,

my Devotions to the Protectress of

Prayer, I perceiv'd an Urn upon

read this Inscription. Here reft
the Ashes ofPhya, whoseLove to Pi-

and my Reign has never since been

c
While Cyrus staid at Athens, 2*/-
Jijtratus and Solon conducted him
often to the Theatre. Stately Edifi
ces, pompous Decorations, and the
nice Rules, which have been since
observed, were not then known.
Tragedy was not in that Perfection
to which it was brought by Sophocles 5
but it answer'd all the Views of Po
licy, for which it was introduc'd.
The Greek Poets, in their Drama
tic Performances, usually represented
the Tyranny of Kings, in order to
strengthen the Aversion which the
Athenians had to Royalty : But $*'$-
Jljlratus directed the Deliverance of
Andromeda to be acted. The Poet
had scatter'd, throughout his Tragedy,
several Strokes of Panegyrick, which
were the more delicate, as they might
be apply'dj not only to 'Perseus, but
to
'The Travels of Cyrus. 30'
to Cyrus, who was descended from
him. After this, Solon led the young
Prince to Areopagus, to take a
Repast there 5 which was more frugal
than that at the Palace of tPi/tJlra-
tus, but not less agreeable. Du
ring the Entertainment, Cyrus de-
sir a the old Sage to explain to him
the Nature, Design, and principal
Parts, of Tragedy, which he did not
yet understand. Solon, who was
himself a Poet, answer'd :
c The Theatre is a living Picture
' of the Virtues and Passions of Men.
1 Imitation deceives the Mind into a
* Belief, that the Objects are really
c present, and not represented/
c You have formerly read our
* Poet, Homer 5 the Drama is only
* an Abridgement of Epic-Poesy*
* The one is an Action recited, the
1 other an Action represented. The

' umphs
302 'The Travels o/ Cyrus.
umphs of Virtue and Courage over
Vice and Fortune 5 the other re
presents the unforeseen Mischiefs
caus'd by the Passions. The one
may abound with the Marvellous
and Supernatural, because it treats
of heroick Virtues, which the Gods
alone inspire 5 but in the other,
where human Passions prevail, the
Natural must be joined with the
Surprizing, to shew the Effect and
Sport of those Passions. The heaping
Wonders upon Wonders, transports
the Mind beyond the Limits of Na
ture, but it only excites Admiration.
On the contrary, by describing the
Effects of Virtue and Vice, both
without and within us, Man is
brought to see and know himself 5
the Heart is touch'd, while the
Mind is diverted.
c The Virtmus, the Useful, and
c the Agreeable, must be united, in
I order to reach the Sublime. The
< most
The Travels of Cyrus. 303
most beautiful Flowers, Graces,
and Paintings, only please the
Imagination, without satisfying the
Heart, or improving the Under
standing. Solid Principles, noble
Sentiments, and various Characters
must be dispers'd throughout, in
order to display to us, Truth, Vir
tue, and Nature. Man must be
represented as he is, and as he ap
pears 5 in his native Colours, and
under his Disguises5 that the Picture
may resemble the Original, in which
there is always a Contrast of Vir
tues and Imperfections. Never
theless it is necessary to conform to
the Weakness of Mankind. Too
much Moralizing disgusts 5 too
much Reasoning tires. We must
turn Maxims into Action, convey
noble Sentiments by a single
Word, and instruct rather by the
Manners of the Hero, than by his
Discourse.
< These
304 The Travels os Cyrus.
* These are the great Rules found
ed upon human Nature, and the
Springs which must be put in Mo
tion to make Pleasure serviceable
to Instruction. I foresee that one
Day these Rules may be improv'd,
by introducing into such Entertain
ments, all the Arts of Imitation,
Painting, Musick, and Dancing,
as well as Poesy. Hitherto I have
contented my self with making the
Theatre a School of Philosophy, for
the young Athenians, and useful
to their Education. It argues an
Ignorance of human Nature, to at-
tempt to lead it to Wisdom at once
by Constraint and Severity. Du
ring the Sprightliness and Fire of
Youth, there is no fixing the At
tention of the Mind, but by amu
sing it. This Age is always upon
its Guard against Precepts 5 and
it is therefore necessary to disguise
them, under the Form ofPleasure/

Cyrus comprehended by this the
great Designs, both Political and
Moral, of the Theatre 5 and saw
clearly at the same Time, that the
principal Rules of Tragedy are not
arbitrary, but taken from Nature.
He thought he could not better shew
his Thankfulness to Solon for his In
structions, than by letting him see
the Impression they had made upon
him.
1 I now perceive^ said he, that the
* Egyptians are much in the wrong
* to despise the Greeks, and especial-
c \y you Athenians. They look up-
* on your Graces, your Delicacies,

' volous Thoughts, superfluous Or-

1 ments/

embracing him, and laying : ' Hap-.

The young Prince, at parting,
made the same Promise to cPiJijlra-
tus, which he had made to Chilo and
Leonidas, of being ever a faithful
Ally to Greece. He embark'd, with
Araspes, at the Port of 'Phalerus, in
a Rhodian Vessel, which was bound
for Crete.
Cyrus's Design in going thither,
was not only to study the Laws of
X 2 Minos.
308 The Travels of Cyrus.
Minos, but likewise to see 'Pythago
ras, who had stopp'd there in his
Way to Croton. All the Eastern
Magi, whom that Sage had seen in
his Travels, had spoken of him to
the Prince with Encomiums. He was
esteem'd the greatest Philosopher of
bis Age, and to understand, best of
all Men, the ancient Religion of Or
pheus. His Dispute with Jnaxi-
mander, the Naturalist, had fill'd all
Greece with his Fame, and divided
all the Learned. Arafpes had been
inform'd of this Matter by the Phi
losophers of Athens, and during the
Voyage, gave Cyrus the following
Account of it :
' 'Pythagoras, who was descended
4 from the ancient Kings of the Island
* of Santos, had been captivated with
c the Charms of Wisdom from his ten-
* derest Years. He discover'd, even
* from that Time, a superior Ge-
* nius, and a sovereign Taste for
< Truth.
The Travels of Cyrus. $oq
Truth. Not finding at Samos any
Philosopher, who cou'd satisfy his
eager Thirst for Knowledge, he
left it at Eighteen Years of Age, to
seek elsewhere what he could not
meet with in his own Country.
After having travell'd for several
Years in Egypt and Asia, he re
turned Home, fraught with all the
Sciences of the Chaldeans, Egyp
tians, GymnofophifiS, and He
brews.
* The Sublimity of his Genius was
equal to the Extent of his Learning,
and the excellent Qualities of his
Heart surpass'd both. His lively and
fertile Imagination did not hinder
the Justness of his Reasoning.
c Anaximander had gone from his
own Country, Miletus, to the
'- Island of Samos. He had all the
Talents which can be acquir'd by
; Study 5 but his Understanding was
' more
3io The Tr a v e l s of C y r u s.
more subtile than solid, his No
tions more learned than luminous,
and his deluding Eloquence full of
Sophistry. He was impious in the
very Bottom of his Soul, yet af
fected all the outward Appearances
of an extravagant Superstition. He
held, as 1)i<vine Truths, all the
Fables of the Poets, and stuck to
the literal Sense of their Alle
gories. He adopted all the vulgar
Opinions as Principles, in order to
degrade Religion, and make it
monstrous. His Impiety did not
proceed only from the Vanity of
making himself the Head of a new
Sect, but from ill Nature. He
hated Mankind, and to gratify his
Humour, endeavour'd to destroy
all the true Pleasures of the Mind,
and all the sweet Hopes which the
Idea of Immortality inspires.
c 'Pythagoras loudly oppos'd his
mischievous Maxims, and endea-
c vour'd
The Travels of Cyrus. 311
vour'd to purge Religion of those
absurd Opinions which dishonour
it. Anaximander, covering him
self with the Veil of a deep Hypo
crisy, took Occasion from thence
to accuse him of Impiety.
1 He secretly made use of all Arts
to incense the People, and alarm
^Polycrates, " who then reigri'd at
Samos. He addressed himself to
all the Sects of Philosophers, and
to the Priests of the different Di
vinities, to persuade them that the
Samian Sage, by teaching the
Unity of one sole Principle, de
stroy'd the Gods of Greece. The
King esteem'd and lov'd Pythago
ras. Nevertheless he suffer'd him
self to be surpriz'd and impos'd
upon, by the artful Representati
ons, which Anaximander contriv'd
to have laid before him. The Sage
was banish'd from Court, and
obliged to quit his Country.'

in those Arts and Sciences which po

they were great Masters of the sublime
Science of being content with simple
Nature, of despising Death for the
Love of their Country, and of flying
all Pleasures which emasculate the
Mind, and enervate the Body.
The Youth were educated in pub-
lick Schools, where they were early
instructed in the Knowledge of the
Laws, and accustom'd to hear Causes,
pass Sentence, and mutually to do
one another Justice 5 and hereby they
discovered their Dispositions, Penetra
tion, and Capacity for Employments
in a riper Age.
The Virtues which their Masters
were principally careful to inspire,
were Truth and Goodness, Sobriety
and Obedience. The two former

latter are necessary to the Preserva

The chief Aim of the Laws in
antient Perjia, was to prevent the
Corruption of the Heart: And for
this Reason, the 'Persians punisii'd
Ingratitude, a Vice against which
there is no Provision made by the
Laws of other Nations. Whoever
was capable of forgetting a Benefit,
or of refusing to do a good Office
when it was in his Power, was looked

Cyrus had been educated according
to these wise Maxims. And though
it was impossible to conceal from him
his Rank and Condition, yet he was
treated like the rest ofhis Companions,
and with the same Severity as if he
had. not been born to reign. He was
taught to practise an exact Obedience,

Mandana could not avoid complying,
but was uneasy at the Thought of
being oblig'd to carry her Son to the
Court of Echatana.
For the Space of two hundred
Years, the Bravery of the Kings of
Media had extended their Conquests 5

the Fall of Empires. Valour, Con

the fatal Circle, and these are the

Solidity.

The Days were spent in Effemi
nacy, or in Flattery. The Love of
Glory, strict Probity, severe Honour,
were no longer in Esteem. Solid
Knowledge was looked upon as con

This Depravity, however, was not
then so universal in Media, as it be-

Artaxerxes and 'Darius Codomanus.
Corruption takes its Rise in Courts,
and extends itself gradually thro' all
.» ' ". I the Parts of a State. There were in
the Provinces, and in the Troops,
several military Men who were not
corrupted by the infectious Air of
Echatana, but had preserv'd in them
selves all the Virtues which flourish'd
in the Reigns of Demes and ^hra-
ortes.
Mandana was throughly sensible of
all the Dangers to which she should
expose young Cyrus, by carrying him

to a Court, the Manners ofwhich were
so different from those of the Ter-
Jians. But the Will ofCambyfes, and
the Orders of djlyages, obliged her
to undertake the Journey.
She set out, attended by a Body
ofthe young Nobility of 'Persia, un
der the Command of Hyftaspes, to
whom the Education of Cyrus had
been committed. She was in a Cha
riot with her Son, and it was the
first time he had seen himself distin
guish'd from his Companions.
Mandana was a Princess of un
common Virtue. Her Mind was cul
tivated and adorned, and she had a
Genius much above her Sex. She
made it her Business, during the Jour
ney, to inspire Cyrus with the Love
of Virtue, by entertaining him with
Fables according to the Eastern Man

agreeable and familiar Images. To
make Truth lovely to them, it must
be exhibited by sensible and beautiful
Representations.
Mandana had observed that 'Cyrus
was often too full of himself, and
that he discovered some Tokens of a
rising Vanity, which might one Day
obscure his great Qualities. She en
deavoured to make him sensible of
the Deformity of that Vice, by re
lating to him the Fable of Sozares,

She then painted to him the Beauty
of those noble Virtues which lead to
Heroism, by the generous forgetting
ofoneWelf. She related to him the
Fable of the first Hermes, a divine
Youth, who was beautiful without
knowing it, had Wit without think
ing so, and who was unacquainted
with his own Virtue, because he was
ignorant that there were Vices.
It was thus that Mandana instruct

Fable gave Rise to another. The
Questions of the Prince furnished the
Queen with new Matter to entertain
him, and with Opportunities of teach

Fables, the Taste for which had pre
vailed very much in the Eafl, since /,

As they passed one Day by a
Mountain, consecrated to the great
Oroma%es,

Oromazes*, Mandana stopp'd her
Chariot, alighted, and drew near to the
sacred Place. It was the Day of a so
lemn Festival, and the High Priest was
already preparing the Victim, crown'd
with Flowers. He was of a sudden
seiz'd with a Divine Spirit, and inter
rupting the Silence and Solemnity of
the Sacrifice, cryed out in a Trans
port 5 / fee a young Laurel rising.
It will soon spread its Branches over
all the East. The Nations will come
in Crowds to assemble together under
its Shadow. At the very same In
stant a Spark of Fire flew out from
the Pile, and moved about the Head
of Cyrus.
Mandana made deep Reflections
upon this Event, and after she was
again in her Chariot, said to her Son,

guries to animate Heroick Souls : They

Being arrived upon the Frontiers
of Media, Jjlyages, with all his
Court, came out to meet them. He
was a Prince of great Beneficence and
Humanity, but his natural Goodness
made him often too Easy, and his
Propensity to Pleasure had brought
the Medes into the Taste of Luxury
and Effeminacy *.
Cyrus, soon aster his Arrival at
the Court of Echatana, gave Proofs
of a Wit and Judgment far beyond
his Age. J
styages put divers Ques
tions to him concerning the Manners,
Laws, and Method ofeducating Youth
among the cPerfians. He was struck
with Astonishment at the lively and

noble Answers of his Grandson. All
the Court admired the bright Parts of
Cyrus, insomuch that he began to be
intoxicated with Praise. A secret Pre
sumption steals into his Heart. He
talks a little too much, and does not
hearken enough to others. He de
cides with an Air of Sufficiency, and
seems too fond of Wit.
Mandana, to remedy this Fault,
contrived. to set before him his own
Picture, by certain Passages of His
tory 5 for she still proceeded in his
Education, upon the same Plan on
which flie had begun it. She related to
him the Story of Logis and Sygeus.

c merly the Custom at Thebes, in

proper Use of their Talents, and
govern those who govern under
him. This is the great Secret of
the Art of Reigning.
c Among the King's Sons there
were two who discovered a supe-
riour Genius. The elder loved
Talking, the younger was more
silent. The eloquent Prince, named
Logh, made himself admired by
the Charms of his Wit. The silent
Prince, named Sygeus, made him
self loved by the Goodness of his
Heart. The first fhew'd plainly,
even while he endeavoured to con
ceal it, that he spoke only to shine.
The second hearkned readily to
others, and looked upon Conversa
tion, as a sort of Commerce, where
each Person ought to bring some
thing of his own. The one made
the most thorny and perplexed Af
fairs agreeable by a peculiar Grace
in the manner of treating them :

seeing the Miseries with which the

His Ministers, who had no Expe

Changes, how useful soever they
may appear, are always dangerous.

it not been for the Prudence and

Cyrus usually confess'd his Faults
without seeking to excuse them. He
listened to this Story with Attention.,
perceived the Design oiMandana in
telling it him, and resolved to correct:
himself.
Soon after this, he gave a notable
Proof of his Genius and Courage.
He was scarce Seventeen Years ofAge
when Merodac Son of Nabuchodono-
sor King of Assyria assembled some
Troops under pretence of Hunting,
and made an Irruption into Media.
He left his Infantry upon the Fron
tiers, and marching in Person with
twelve thousand Horse towards the
first strong Places belonging to the
Medes, encamped near them, and
from thence sent out Detachments

every Day to scour and ravage the
Country.
Ajlyages had early Notice that
the Enemy was enter'd into his
Dominions, and after having given
the necessary Orders for assembling his
Army, he set out with his Son Cy-
axares and young Cyrus, followed
only by some Squadrons levy'd in
haste, to the Number of eight thou
sand Horse.
When he was come near the Bor
ders of his own Country, he en-
cam p'd upon a rising Ground, from
whence he discover'd the Plain which
Merodac ravaged by his Detach
ments. Aftyages ordered two of his
General Officers to go and observe
the Enemy. Cyrus desired leave to
accompany them, in order to inform
himself of the Situation of the Coun
try, the advantageous Posts, and the
Strength of the Assyrian Army.
C 3 Having

Having made his Observations, he
came back, and gave an exact: Ac
count of all he had seen.
Afiyages the next Day assembled
a Council of War to deliberate upon
the Motions he should make. The
greatest Part of the General Officers,
apprehending some Ambush if they
should leave their Camp, advis'd the
suspending all Action, till the Arrival
of new Troops. Cyrus, who was
impatient to engage, hearken'd to
their Reasonings with Uneasiness, but
observed a profound Silence out of
Respect to the Emperor, and so ma
ny experiencd Commanders 3 till at
length Ajiyages order'd him to speak.
He then rose up in the midst of the
Assembly, and with a noble and mo
dest Air, said, / discovers Tejierday

ment thither thro' this Valley, which

peror approves it.
Cyrus held his peace, blush'd, and
feard to have spoken too much. All
adnuYd his Genius for War, at such
tender Years. Ajtyages was surpriz'd
at the Justness of his Thought, and
immediately commanded that his
Counsel should be follow'd.
Cyaxares marched strait to the
Enemy, while Cyrus, accompanied
by Hyflafpes, filed off with a Body
of Cavalry, without being discovers,
and conceal'd himself in the Wood.
The Prince of the Medes attack'd the
Assyrians dispers'd in the Plain. Me-
rodac left his Camp to sustain them.

He cover'd himself with his Shield,
pierc'd into the thickest of the Squa
drons, and spread Terror and Slaughter
where-ever he came. The Assyrians
seeing themselves thus attack'd on all
Sides, lost Courage, and fled in Dis
order.
Cyrus, after the Battle, was sen
sibly touch'd with seeing the Field
cover'd with dead Bodies. He took the
lame Care of the wounded Assyrians,
as of the Medes, and gave the ne
cessary Orders for their Cure. They
are Men, said he, as well as we,
and are no longer Enemies when once
they are vanquishd.
The Emperor, having taken his
Precautions to prevent such Irruptions
for the suture, return'd to Ecbatana.

back her Son with her, but Aftyages

Mandana could not yield her Con

dreaded the leaving her Son in the

Seat of Voluptuousness. Being alone
with Cyrus, stie was resolv d to sound
his Inclinations, and ask'd him, Whe
ther he liked best to stay at Ecbatana,
or to return to 'Persia. He answer'd,

under Aflyages, in his Wars against
the Scythians, and the King of Lydia,
and had all the Virtues ofthe antient

of the Medes. Being a great Poli

Man equally able and disinterested,
he had risen to the first: Employ

Mandana

28 The Travels of Cyrus.
Mandana being persuaded of the
Virtue and Capacity of Hyflajpes, as
well as of the Advantages her Son
might find, by living in a Court,
that was no less brave and knowing
in the Art of War, than polite, re-
solv'd to obey Jjlyages,
She began her Journey soon after,
and Cyrus accompanied her some
Leagues from Ecbatana, At parting
she embrac'd him with Tenderness 5
My Son, said she, remember that your
Virtue alone can make me happy. The
young Prince melted into Tears, and
stood silent. This was his first Se
paration from her. He follow'd her
with his Eyes till she was out of
Sight, and then return'd to Ecbatana.
Cyrus continued in a voluptuous
Court, without being infected by it.
This however was not owing to the
Precautions of Mandana, the Coun
sels
The Travels of Cyrus. 20
sels of Hyjlajpes, or his own natural
Virtue, but to Love.
There was then at the Court of
Eclatan a young Princess named Cas-
fandana, & near Relation of Cyrus,
and Daughter of 'Pharnafpes, who
was of the Race of the Achemenides *.
Her Father, who was one of the
principal Satrapes of ^Per/ta, had sent
her to the Court of Afiyages, to be
there educated. She had all the
Politeness of that Court, without
any of its Faults. Her Wit was
equal to her Beauty, and her Mo
desty heighten'd the Charms of both.
Her Imagination was lively, but di
rected by her Judgment. A Justness
of Thought was as natural to her as a
Gracefulness of Expression. She spoke
seldom 5 but when she did speak, one
might perceive that she priz'd Virtue
more than Wit. She had entertain'd
* Herod. B. r.
30 The Travels of Cyrus,
a particular Regard for Cyrus from
the first Moment she saw him, but
conceal'd her Sentiments so well, as
not to be suspected.
Proximity of Blood gave Cyrus
frequent Opportunities of seeing and
discoursing with her. Her Conversa
tion soften'd the Manners of the young
Prince, and he insensibly acquir'd a
Delicacy with which till then he had
not been acquainted.
The Beauties and Virtues of this
Princess produced by degrees in his
Soul all the Motions of that noble
Passion, which softens the Hearts of
Heroes without lessening their Cou
rage, and which places the principal
Charm of Love in the Pleasure of
loving. Precepts, Maxims, and se
vere Lessons, do not always preserve
the Mind from the poison'd Arrows
of Sensuality. 'Tis perhaps exacting
too much from Youth, to require
that

that they should be insensible. And it
often happens that nothing but a well-
plac'd Love can be a Security from
dangerous and criminal Passions.
Cajsandana perceiv'd the Affection
of Cyrus, but without seeming to
observe it. And Cyrus enjoy'd in
her Conversation all the Pleasures of
the purest Friendship, without de
claring his Love. His Youth and his
Modesty made him timorous. And
it was not long before he felt all the
Disquiets, Pains, and Alarms, which
ever tend upon such Passions, even
when they are most innocent.
Cajfandanas Beauty very soon
created him a Rival. Cyaxares be
came enamour'd of this Princess. He
was very near of the same Age with
Cyrus, but of a very different Cha
racter. He had Wit and Courage,
but was of an impetuous, haughty
Disposition, and shew'd already but
too
3 2 The Travels os Cyrus.
too great a Propensity to all the Vices
common to young Princes.
Cqfsandana could love nothing but
Virtue, and her Heart had made its
Choice. She dreaded more than
Death an Alliance with the Median
Prince, tho' it flatter'd so much her
Ambition.
Cyaxares was unacquainted with
the Delicacy of Love. His high
Rank augmented his natural Haugh
tiness, and the Manners ofthe.M?^.s
authoriz'd his Presumption : So that
he us'd little Precaution or Ceremony
in letting the Princess know his Pas
sion for her.
He immediately perceived her In
difference, sought for the Cause of it,
and was not long in making the Dis
covery. In all publick Diversions
she appear'd gay and free with him,
but was more constrain'd with Cyrus.
The
The Travels of Cyrus. 77
The Guard she kept upon herself,
gave her an Air of Reserve, which
was not natural to her. She answer'd
to all the Civilities of Cyaxares, with
ready and lively Turns of Wit 5 but
when Cyrus spoke, she could hardly
conceal her Perplexity.
Cyaxares observ'd this different Be
haviour, and guefs'd the Reason of
it : But young Cyrus, being little
skill'd in the Secrets ofLove, did not
interpret the Conduct of Cajfandana
in the same manner. He imagin'd
that she was pleas'd with the Passion
of Cyaxares, and that her Eyes were
dazzled with the Lustre ofthat Prince's
Crown.
Cyrus experienc'd alternately, the
Uncertainty and Hope, the Pains and
Pleasures of a lively Passion. His
Trouble was too great to be long

Not long after, Cambyses having
Notice of Cyrus's Love for Caffan-
dana, recalled him to Terjia 5 for he
had other Views for his Son, which
agreed better with his Politicks.
'Pharnafpes was at the same time
inform'd of the Sentiments of Cyax-
ares. His Ambition was flatter'd
by the Hope of such an Alliance,
and he sent Orders to his Daughter
to stay at the Court of Ecbatana.
Cyrus and Caffandana were in
form'd of their Fathers Intentions,
and saw the Necessity of a Separa
tion. Their Grief was proportionable
to their Love. But the Prince flatter'd
himself that he should be able, by
the Help of Mandana, to move Cam
byses and 'Pharnafpes, at his Return
to the Court of Persia. And this
Hope hindered him from sinking
under the Sorrow of so cruel a
Situation.

young Araspes the Son of Harpagus,
to go privately thro' By-ways, and
stop Cajsandana, and to conduct: her
to a solitary Place on the Borders of
the Caspian Sea.
Araspes had given himself up to all
the Pleasures of a voluptuous Court,
but in the midst of Sensuality had
preserv'd noble and generous Senti

Thing that was dishonourable and un
just : All his Faults proceeded rather
from Easiness and Complaisance than
Vice : He had an excellent Under

as well as form'd for a Court, was
qualified for every thing both in Peace
and War.
He communicated the Orders given
him by Cyaxares to his Father Harpa-

He commanded him at the same
time to go and impart the whole

should find some other Means to
execute his Purpose, ordered Arafpes,

the Father to a great Feast, he made

hopes that Mandana would prevail
with Camhyfes to alter his Mind. A
Turn of Politicks soon after chang'd
that Prince's Sentiments. He learnt

S Cyrus advened in Years,
his Understanding opened
and improved. His Taste
and his Genius led him to
the Study of the sublime Sciences.
He had often heard speak of the fa

quitted their Retreat upon the Banks
of the River Oxus, in Baftria, and
were settled near the Terfian Gulf.

As chose Sages rarely left their Soli
tude, and had little Intercourse with
other Men, he had never seen any
one of them. The Thirst of Know
ledge begot in him a strong Desire os
conversing with them.
He undertook this Journey with
Cajsandana, attended by several Sa-
trapes, and crossing the Plain of *Pas~
sagarda, went thro' the Country of
the Mardi, and arrived upon the
Banks of the Arqfis. They enter'd
by a narrow Pass into a large Valley,
encompass'd with high Mountains,
the Tops of which were covered
with Oaks, Fir-trees, and lofty Ce
dars. Below were rich Pastures, in
which all Sorts of Cattle were seed
ing. The Plain look'd like a Garden,
water'd by many Rivulets, which
came from the Rocks all around,
and emptied themselves into the

away, and discovered a Prospect of
fruitful Fields, vast Forests, and the
Caspian Sea, which bounded the
Horizon.
Cyrus and Cajfandana, as they
advanc'd in the Valley, were invited
into a neighbouring Grove by the
Sound ofharmonious Mnsick. There,
they beheld, by the side of a cleat
Fountain, a great Number of Meri
of all Ages, and over against them a
Company of Women, who form'd a
Concert. They understood that it
Was the School of the Magi, and
were surpriz'd to see, instead of
austere, melancholy, and thoughtful
Men, an agreeable and polite People*

After they had given some little
time in the Morning to this Exercise,
they led their Disciples thro' agreeable
Places to the Sacred Mountain, ob
serving all the while a strict: Silence :
There, they ofFer'd their Homages to
the Gods, rather by the Voice of the
Heart, than of the Lips. Thus by
Musick, pleasant Walks, and Prayer,
they prepar'd themselves for the Con
templation of Truth, and put the
Soul into a Serenity proper for Medi
tation : The rest of the Day was
spent in Study. Their only Repast
was a little before Sun-set, at which
they eat nothing but Bread, and some
Portion of what had been offer'd to
the Gods, concluding all with Con
certs of Musick.

Archimagus. He, who then pos
sessed that Honour, was named Z*av~

rest more in Wisdom than in Age,
for he was scarce fifty Years old :
Nevertheless he was a consummate
Master in all the Sciences of the Goal*

tered into this Grove, the Assembly
arose and worshipped them, bowing
themselves t© the Earths according to
the Custom of the Eaji 5 and then
retiring, left them alone with Zoro+

of the Life, Manners, and Virtues of

he frequently cast a Look upon the
Statue, and as he beheld it, his Eyes
were bathed in Tears. Cyrus and
Cajsandana observ'd his Sorrow at
first with a respectful Silence, but
afterwards the Princess could not for
bear asking him the Reason of it.

that she was Daughter of an old

when we were surrounded by a
Body of Men, arm'd with Bows
and Arrows, who carry'd away
Sellma and her Father. They were
all on Horseback : I sollow'd them
some time, but they enter'd into a
Wood, and I saw them no more.

1 lima : What cannot Love do in a
1 young Heart given up to its Passion ?
£ As I was one Day crossing the
Country of the Lycians, I stopt in
a great Forest, to shelter myself
from the Heat. I presently saw a
Company of Hunters pass by, and
a little after several Women, among
whom I thought I discoverd Selima ;
She was in a hunting Dress, mount
ed upon a proud Courser, and di-
stinguish'd from all the rest by a
Crown of Flowers. She pass'd by
me so swift, that I could not be
sure whether my Conjectures were
well founded 5 but I went strait to
the Capital.
e The Lycians were at that time
govern'd by Women, which Form
of Government was establifli'd
among them upon the following
Occasion,
5 Some
IT'he Travels of Cyrus. 7?
1 Some Years ago, the Men became
so effeminate during a long Peace,
that their Thoughts were wholly
taken up about their Dress. They
affected the Discourse, Manners,
Maxims, and all the Imperfections
of Women, without having either
their Sweetness or Delicacy : And
while they gave themselves up to
infamous Laziness., the most abo-r
minable Vices took the Place of
lovely Passions. They defpis'd the
Lycian Women, and treated them
like Slaves. A foreign War came
upon them. The Men being grown
cowardly and effeminate, were
not able to defend their Country.
They fled and hid themselves in
Caves and Caverns. The Women,
being accustomed to Fatigue, by
the Slavery they had undergone,
rook Arms, drove away the Enemy,
became Mistresses of the Country,
and establish'd themselvesin Author
rity by an immutable Law.
' From
74' %"he Travels es Cyrus,
' From that time the Lycians ac
customed themselves to this Form
of Government, and found it the
easiest and most convenient.
Their Queens had a Council of
Senators, who assisted them with
their Advice : The Men proposed
good Laws, but the Women caus'd
them to be executed. The Sweetness
and Mildness of the Sex prevented
all the Mischiefs of Tyranny 5
and the Counsel of the wise Sena
tors, qualify'd that Inconstancy,
with which Women are reproach'd,
• I understood that the Mother of
Selima, having been dethroned by
the Ambition of a Kinswoman,
her first Minister had fled to the
Indies with the young Princess 5 that
he had liv'd there several Years as a
Brachman, and she as an Efiale $
that this old Man having always
maintained a Correspondence with
« the
^Travels o/Cyrus, -'^j
the Friends of the Royal Family,
the young Queen had been restor'd
to the Throne after the Death of
the Usurper 5 that she govern d
with the Wisdom of a Person who
had experienc'd Misfortunes : And
lastly, that she had always express'd
an invincible Dislike to Marriage.
e This News gave me an inex
pressible Joy 5 I thank'd the Gods
for having conducted me by such
wonderful Ways, near the Object
of my Heart 5 I implor'd their Help,
and promis'd never to love but
once, if they would favour my
Passion.
1 I consider'd of several Methods
whereby to make myself known to
the Queen 5 and seeing that War
was the most proper, I engag'd in
the Troops. There, I distinguish'd
myself very soon 5 for I refus'd no
Fatigue, I sought the most hazardous

Enterprizes, and expos'd myself
every where. Upon a Day of
Battle, which was to be decisive of
the Liberty of the Lycians, the
Carians put our Troops into Dis
order : 'Twas in a large Plain, out
of which there was but one narrow
Pass. I gain'd this Pass, and
thfeatned to pierce with my Jave
lin, any Man who should attempt
to force it. In this Manner I rally'd
our Troops, and returned to charge
the Enemy 5 I routed them? and
obtained a complete Victory. This
Action drew the Attention of all
the Army upon me : Nothing was
spoken of but my Courage 5 and all
the Soldiers call'd me the Deliverer
of their Country. I was conducted
to the Queen's Presence, who could
not recollect me 5 for we had been
separated six Years, and Grief and
Fatigue had alter'd my Features.
'She

c She ask'd me my Name, and
my Country, and examined me
with Attention. I thought I dis
covered in her Eyes a secret Emo
tion, which she endeavour'd to
conceal. Strange Capriciousness of
Love ! Heretofore I had thought
her an Ejiak of mean Birth ^ yet
nevertheless I resolved to share my
Crown with her. This Moment
I conceiv'd a Design of making
myself be lov'd, as I had lov'd 5 I
conceal'd my Country, and my
Birth, and told her, I was born in
a Village of Bafiria, of a very
obscure Family. Upon which she
suddenly withdrew, without an
swering me.

the Advice of her Senators, the

the People. Aflbon as we were
alone., Ah Selima I said I, have
you then forgot Amana ? She was
transported with Surprize, Ten
derness and Joy. She then knew
me, and conjectur'd all the rest.
I had no need to speak 5 and we
both were a long time silent. At
length I told her my Story, with ,
all the Effects that Love had pro
duc'd in me.
1 She very soon assembled her
Council, and acquainted them with
my Birth. Embassadors were sent
to the Indies. I renounced my
Crown and Country for ever 5 and
my Brother was confirmed in the
Possession of my Throne.
' This was an easy Sacrifice 5 I was
in Possession of Selima, and my

The Story of Zoroaster made a
strong Impression upon the Prince
and Princess5 it confirm'd them in
their mutual Tenderness, and in their
Love of Virtue,
Whil?
The Travels of Cyr. us, 89
While CaJJandana was agreeably
entertaining herself in the Conversa
tion ofthe Women, and with their har
monious Concerts, Zoroaster initiated
Cyrus into all the Mysteries of the
Eastern Wisdom. The Chaldeans,
the Egyptians, and the Gymnofophijls,
had a wonderful Knowledge of Na»
ture 5 but they wrapp'd it up in Alle
gorical Fables : And this, doubtless,
is the Reason, that venerable Anti
quity has been reproach'd with Igno
rance, in natural Philosophy.
Zoroaster laid open before Cyrus,
all the Secrets of Nature 5 not merely
to amuse him, but to make him ob
serve the Marks of an infinite Wis
dom, diffus'd throughout the Uni
verse 5 and thereby to prepare him
for more sublime Instructions relating
to the Divinity and Religion.
One
po The Travels of Cyrus.
One while he made him admire
the Structure of the Human Body,
the Springs of which it is compos'd,
and the Liquors that flow in it 5 the
Canals, the Pumps, and the Basons,
which are form'd by the mere inter
weaving of the Nerves, Arteries, and
Veins, in order to separate, purify,
conducts and reconduct the Liquids
into all the Extremities of the Body,
Then the Levers, the Cords, and
the Pullies, form'd by the Bones,
Muscles, and Cartilages, for the
causing of all the Motions of the
Solids. ..-.

this he made him comprehend, that
an Infinity of small imperceptible
Springs, the Construction and Mo
tions of which we are ignorant o£
are continually playing in our Bo*
dies 5 and consequently, that none
but a sovereign Intelligence could
produce, adjust, and preserve so
compounded, fb delicate, and so
admirable a Machine.
At another time he explain'd to
him the Configuration of Plants, and
the Transformation of Insects. They
had not then our Optkk Glasses, to
magnify Objects, and bring them
near 5 but the penetrating Spirit of
Zoroajier, inlightened by a long Tra
dition of physical Experiments, saw
further than the Eye can reach to by
their Help.

this Seed another little Plant 5 and
so on without End. Fruitful Na
ture is inexhaustible. The Growth
of Vegetables is but the unfolding
of the Fibres, Membranes, and
Branches, by the flowing of the
Moisture of the Earth into them..
The Pressure of the Air makes that
nourishing Moisture, which is preg
nant with Salts, Sulphur, and Oils,
enter into the Tubes of the Roots.
The Action of the Sun in the Day
time draws upwards the subtil Part
of the Sap 5 and the Coolness of
the Night fixes, condenses, and
ripens it, in order to produce
Leaves, Flowers and Fruits5 and
to form all those Riches of Nature,
which charm the Sight, the Smell,
and the Taste.

He then recounted to him all their
different Metamorphoses. Now they
are Worms which crawl upon the
Earth 5 then Fishes swimming in Li
quors 5 and at last, they get Wings,
and rise into the Air.
Another time, the Sage carried the

there.
He shew'd him the wonderful
Qualities of that subtil and invisible
Fluid, which encompasses the Earth 5
how useful and necessary it is to the
Life of Animals, the Growth of
Plants, the Flying of Birds, the Form
ing of Sounds, and all the Uses of

1 and thereby make them lighter than
i the Air 5 so that they ascend into

* The Sun having drawn up these

Causes, are regulated according to
Weight and Measure, by that Sove

verse in his Hand 5 and who weighs
the Earth as a Grain of Sand 5 and
the Sea as a Drop of Water.
After this Zoroafler rais'd the
Thoughts of Cyrus to contemplate
the Cœlestial Bodies 5 arid explain'd
to him the admirable Proportion in
their Distances, Magnitudes and Re
volutions.

These Discourses ofZoroaster made
a strong Impression on the Mind of
Cyrus. He would have staid much
longer with the Magi in their Soli
tude, if his Duty had not call'd him
back to the Court of Persia.

Virtues, those Charms which are
ever new, and which are not to be

ture to change, diminish'd in the
least the mutual Tenderness of these
happy Lovers. They liv'd thus se
veral Years together, and Cajsandana
brought Cyrus two Sons, Cambyfes
and Smerdis, and two Daughters,
Meroe and Arijlona, and then died,
tho' in the Flower of her Age.
None but those who have experiene'd
the Force of true Love3 founded upon
Virtue, can imagine the disconsolate
Condition of Cyrus. In losing Cas-
sandana, he lost all. Taste, Reason,
Pleasure, and Duty were all united
to augment his Passion. In loving
her he had experiene'd all the Charms
of Love, without knowing either its
Pains, or the Disgusts with which it
is often attended. He feels the
Greatness of his Loss, and refuses all
Consolation. It is neither the sudden
Revolutions in States, nor the severe
Stroaks of adverse Fortune, which
oppress the Minds of Heroes. Noble

and generous Souls are touch'd by
those Misfortunes only which concern
the Objects of their softer Passions.
Cyrus gives himself wholly up to
Grief, not to be alleviated by weep
ing or complaining. Great Passions
are always mute. This profound
Silence is at length succeeded by a
Torrent of Tears. Mandana and
AraspeSy who never left him, endea
vour'd to comfort him no other way,
than by weeping with him. Rea- 1
soning and Persuasion furnish no Cure
for Sorrow 5 nor can Friendship yield
Relies, but by sharing it.
After he had long continu'd in this
Dejection, he return'd to see Zoro
aster. The Conversation of that
great Man contributed much to mol
lify the Anguish of his Mind 5 but it
was by Degrees that he recover'd
himself, and not till he had travell'd
for some Years.

Cyrus obey'd his Father's Orders,
and very soon left Terfia, accom-
pany'd by his Friend Araspes, Two
Faithful Slaves were all his Attendants,
for he desir'd to be unknown. He
went down the River Agradatus, em-
bark'd upon the 'Persian Gulf, and
soon arriv'd at the Port of Gerra,
upon the Coast of Arabia Felix.
The next Day he continu'd his
Way towards the City of Macoraba,
The Serenity of the Sky, the Mild
ness of the Climate, the Perfumes
which embalm'd the Air, the Variety,
Fruitfulness, and smiling Appearance
of Nature in every Part, charm'd all
his Senses.
While the Prince was admiring the
Beauty of the Country, he saw a
Man
The Travels o/Cyrus, ill
Man walking with a grave and flow
Pace, and who seem'd bury'd in some
profound Thought. He was already-
come near Cyrus, without having
perceiv'd him. The Prince inter
rupted his Meditation to ask him the
Way to Nahata, where he was to
embark for Egypt.
Amenophis (for that was his Name)
saluted the Travellers with great
Civility, and having represented to
them, that the Day was too far spent
to continue their Journey, hospita*
bly invited them to his rural Ha
bitation. He led them through a
By-way, to a little Hill not far
off, where he had form'd with
his own Hands, several rustick
Grotto's. A Fountain rose in the

could be heard in this Abode of
Peace and Tranquillity.
Amenophis set before his Guests
some dry'd Fruits, and delicious
Wines 5 and entertain'd them agree*
ably during their Repast. An unaf
fected and serene Joy was to be seen
upon his Countenance. His Dis
course was full of good Sense, and
os noble Sentiments. He had all the
Politeness of a Man educated at the
Courts of Kings 5 which gave Cyrus
a great Curiosity to know the Cause
of his Retirement. In order to engage
Amenophis to a greater Freedom, he
discover'd to him who he was, and
the Design of his Travels $ and at
the same time let him see his Desire,
but with that modest Respect, which
one ought to have for the Secret of a
Stranger. Amenophis perceiving it,
began the History of his Life and Mis
fortunes in the following Manner :

c Tho' I am descended from one
of the antientest Families in Egypt ;
nevertheless by the sad Vicissitude of
human Things, the Branch, from
which I come, is fallen into great
Poverty. My Father liv'd near

He cultivated his paternal Farm
with his own Hands, and brought
me up to the Taste of true Plea
sures, in the Simplicity of a Coun
try Life 5 to place my Happiness
in the Study of Wisdom, and to
make Agriculture, Hunting, and ,
the liberal Arts my sweetest Occu
pations.
* It was the Custom of King
rfpries, from time to time to make
a Progress thro' the different Pro
vinces of his Kingdom. One Day
as he pass'd thro' a Forest near the
Place where I liv'd, he perceiv'd me
under the Shade of a Palm-tree,

1 Books of Hermes.
* I was then but Sixteen Years of
Age, and my Youth and Air drew
the King's Attention. He came
up to me, ask'd me my Name,
my Condition, and what I was
reading. He was pleased with my
Answers, order'd me to be con
ducted to his Court, and neglected
nothing in my Education.
c The Liking which Aprtes had
for me, changed, by Degrees, into
a Confidence, which seemed to
augment, in Proportion as I ad-
vanc'd in Years 5 and my Heart
was full of Affection and Grati
tude. Being young, and without
Experience, I thought that Princes
were capable of Friendship 5 and
I did not know that the Gods have

his Wars against the Sidonians and
Cyprians, I became his only Fa
vourite. He communicated to me
the most important Secrets of the
State, and honour'd me with the
first Posts about his Person.
1 I never lost the Remembrance
os that Obscurity from whence the
King had drawn me : I did not
forget that I had been poor, and I
was afraid of being rich. Thus I
preserv'd my Integrity in the midst
of Grandeur, and I went from
time to time into Upper-Egypt^

Advantage of it. He affected a
Candour, a Nobleness of Soul, and
a Disinterestedness, which charm'd
me. In a Word, he so gain'd my
Confidence, that he was to me,
the same that I was to the King.
I presented him to Apr'tes, as a Man
very capable of serving him 5 and
it was not long before he was al
low'd a free Access to the Prince.

himself at the Prince's Feet, laid open

c The King sent Amajis to quiet
them., and to make them return to
their Duty. It was then that the
Designs of that perfidious Minister
broke out. Instead of pacifying
them, he incensed them more and
more, put himself at their Head,
and was proclaim'd King. The

make his Escape into Upper-Egypt.

prevail'd upon the Inhabitants of

That Spirit, which had been so
haughty in Prosperity, and had
boasted that it was not in the

dethrone him, could not support
Adversity. That Prince, so re-

true Courage of the Mind. He

under his Protection. We march'd
against the Usurper, and gave him
Battle near Memphis 5 but having
only foreign Troops., we were intire-
ly defeated. To prevent further
Disturbances, the principal Officers
of our Army were condemn'd to
perpetual Imprisonment. Amajis
made me be sought for every where5
but a Report being spread of my
Death, he believed it, so that I was
confounded with the other Com
manders, and put into a high
Tower at Memphis.
1 The King was conducted to
Sais, where Amajis did him great
Honours for some Days. In order
to sound the Inclinations of the
People, he propos'd to them the
restoring him to the Throne, but
secretly form'd the Design of taking
away his Life. All the Egyptians
demanded the Prince's Death, and
Amajis yielded him to their Pleasure.

He was strangled in his own Palace,
and the Usurper crown'd with
Solemnity.
' Scarce were the People quieted,
when they gave way to that In
constancy which is natural to the
Multitude. They began to despise
the mean Birth of the new King,
and to murmur against him. But
this able Politician successfully made
use of his Address to prevent a
Rebellion.
' He had a golden Cistern., in
which he and his Courtiers used to
warn their Hands upon solemn
Festivals. He caus'd it to be made
into a Statue of Seraph, and ex-
pos'd it to be worfhipp'd by the
People. He beheld with Joy, the
Homages which they ran eagerly to
pay it from all Parts 5 and having
assembled the Egyptians, made
them the following Harangue :

* course, which flatter'd the People,

' conjur'd him to remain upon the
' Throne, and he seem'd to accept
c the Royalty as a Favour done to

1 Mildness and Moderation. Good
' Policy requires it, and his Ambi-
' tion is satisfy'd. He lives at
* Sais, in a Splendor which dazzles
1 those who approach him. Nothing
1 seems wanting to his Happiness :
1 But I am assur'd, that inwardly
* he is far different from what he
1 appears outwardly. He thinks
* that every Man about him is like
1 himself, and would betray him, as
' he betray'd his Master. These
' continual Distrusts hinder him from
' enjoying the Fruit of his Crime 5

Here Cyrus interrupted Amenophis,
to ask him how Amafis could get
such an Ascendant over the Mind of
Apries.
c The Kingj reply'd Amenophis,
'- wanted neither Talents nor Virtues,

4 dieted : Even when he order'd his
c Ministers to tell him the Truth,

ceiv'd this Weakness, and manag'd
it with Art. When Apries made
any Difficulty of giving in to the ■
Despotick Maxims which that per
fidious Minister would have inspir'd
him with 3 he insinuated to the
King, that the Multitude, being in
capable of Reasoning, ought to be
govern d by absolute Authority *
and that Princes, being the Vice
gerents of the Gods, may act like
them, without giving a Reason of
their Conduct. He season d his
Counsels with so many seeming
Principles of Virtue, and' such de
licate Praise, that the Prince, being
seduc d, made himself hated by his
Subjects, without perceiving it.
Cyrus, deeply struck with these Re
flections, and with the unhappy Con
dition of Kings, could nor forbear
saying to Amenophis, ' Methinh

' The Happiness of the People,
answer'd Amenophhi makes the
Happiness of the Prince. Their
true Interests are necesiarily united,
whatever Pains are taken to separate
them. Whosoever attempts to in
spire Princes with contrary Maxims,
ought to be look'd upon as an
Enemy of the State.
* Moreover, Kings ought always
to be apprehensive of a Man who
never contradicts them, and who
tells them only such Truths as will
be agreeable. There needs no
further Proof of the Corruption of
a Minister, than to fee him pre

Glory.

After these Reflections, Amenophh
continued his Story : ' I remain'd un
known, said he, some Years in my
Prison at Memphis. My Confine
ment was so close, that I could not
converse with, or see any Person.
Being thus left in Solitude, and
without any Comfort, I fufferd
the cruel Torments of tiresome
Loneliness. Man finds nothing
within himself but a frightful Void,
which renders him utterly discon
solate. His Happiness oftentimes
proceeds only from the Amuse
ments which hinder him from feel

whelmed with the most melancholy
Reflections, I heard of a sudden a
Noise, as if somebody was open
ing a Way thro' the Wall of my
Prison. It was a Man who endea-
vour'd to make his Escape 5 and in
a sew Days he had made the Pas
sage wide enough to get into my
Chamber. This Prisoner, though
a Stranger, spoke the Egyptian
Tongue perfectly well. He inform'd
me, that he was of Tyre, his
Name Jrohal 5 that he had serv'd
jipries in the Cartan Troops, and
had been taken Prisoner at the same
time with me. I never saw a Man
of a more easy, witty, and agreeable

Kind of Vegetables. We walk'd
with Pleasure among these Beauties,
unknown to the generality of Men 5
but, alas ! the Light of the Day was
wanting, and we could distinguish
nothing but by the Glimmering of
Lamps. We were already begin
ning to accustom ourselves to this
new kind of Misfortune., when
Heaven restor'd us to Liberty, by
a Stroke equally terrible and un

c The Subterraneous Fires some
times break their Prisons with a
Violence that seems to shake Na
ture even to its Foundations. We
frequently felt those terrible Con
vulsions. One Day the Shocks re
doubled, the Earth seem'd to groan.
We expected nothing but Death,
when the impetuous Fires open'd a
Passage into a spacious Cavern j
and that which seem'd to threaten
us with Loss of Life, procur'd us
Liberty.
c We walk'd a long time by the
Light of our Lamps before we
saw the Day 5 but at length the
subterraneous Passage ended at an
old Temple, which we knew to
have been consecrated to O/tris, by

the Altar. We prostrated ourselves

c This Temple was situated near
' the Arabian Gulf. We embark'd

1 Nahata. We cross'd a great Part
c of Arabia Felix, and at length ar-
' riv'd at this Solitude. The Gods

1 We then saw that great Cities,and
magnificent Courts, have only serv'd
too much to corrupt the Manners and
Sentiments ofMankind $ and that by
uniting a Multitude of Men in the
same Place, they often do but unite
and multiply their Passions. We
thank'd the Gods for our being un-
deceiv'd with regard to those false
Pleasures, and even false Virtues,

Self-love has introduc'd into nume

make them Slaves to their Ambition.

c But, alas ! how weak and incon
stant is the Mind of Man. Arobal,
that virtuous, affectionate, and
generous Friend, who had supported
Imprisonment and Slavery with so
much Resolution, could not con
tent himself with a simple and uni
form Life. Having a Genius for
War, he sigh'd after great Exploits,
and being more a Philosopher in
Speculation than in Reality, con-
fess'd to me, that he could no lon
ger bear the Calm of Retirement :
He left me at last, and I have
never seen him since.
' I seem to myself a Being lest
alone upon the Earth. Apries uses
me ill, Amajis betrays me, Arobal
forsakes me. I find every where a
frightful Void. I know at present
the Value of Men. I experience '

While Cyrus was listening to this
Story} one might see upon his Coun
tenance the Sentiments and Passions,
which all these various Events should
naturally raise in him. He conceiv'd
a high Esteem for Amenophis, and
could not without Reluctance resolve
to leave him. \rn
In the mean while Arafpes was
preparing for their Departure. Cyrus,

losopher, said to him 5 ' Is I were

ment. But Heaven destines me to

its Orders, not so much methinks
to please my Ambition, as that I

and Araspes continu'd their Way, and
cross'd the Country of the Salæam.
Araspes during their Journey, was
sometimes fad and thoughtful, which
Cyrus perceiving, ask'd him the Rea
son. Araspes answer'd, c You are a

Canals were cut cross it, in order to

Nile carried Fruitsulness every where

The Cities of Egypt were numerous,
well Peopled, spacious, and full of
magnificent Temples, and stately
Palaces, adorn d with Statues and
Pillars.
Cyrus took a cursory View of all
these Beauties, and went afterwards
to fee the famous Labyrinth built by
the twelve Nomarchs. It was not a
single Palace, but twelve magnificent
Palaces regularly dispos'd. Three
thousand Chambers, which had a
Communication by Terrains, were
rang'd round twelve Halls 5 and
whoever enter'd there without a Guide,
could never find his Way out. There*
were as manyBuildings under Ground,
and these were allotted for the Burial-
Places of the Kings.
The Pavement of all these Apart
ments was of Marble, as likewise the
Walls, upon which were Carvings in
Bas-Relief, representing the History
2 of
1 60 The Travels of Cyrus.
of the Kings. The Princes who were
bury'd underneath, seem'd to live
again in these Sculptures. So that
the same Palace contain'd Monuments,
which set before Monarchs both their
Grandeur and their Nothingness.
Besides the Temples and Palaces
allotted for the Worship of the Gods,
and the Habitation of Mortals, there
were throughout all Egypt, and
especially near Memphis, Pyramids,
which serv'd for the Tombs of great
Men. This wise People thought it
proper to lodge the Dead as magni
ficently as the Living, in order to
immortalize Merit, and perpetuate
Emulation.
The most famous of these Pyra
mids was that of Hermes. It was of
polish'd Stone, and its Height more
than Six hundred Feet. Neither
Winds nor Earthquakes could injure
it. The Taste of the Egyptians was
more
The Travelso/ Cyrus i<5t
more for Solidity than Ornament.
Thro' each Door of this Pyramid was
an Entrance into seven Apartments,
call'd by the Names of the Planets.
In each of them was a golden Statue.
The biggest was in the Apartment of
the Sun, or OJiris. It had a Book
upon its Forehead, and its Hand upon
its Mouth. Upon the Outside of the
Book was written this Inscription,
/ must he read in a profound Silence\
to signify, say the Egyptian Priests^
that we cannot come to know the
Divine Nature, but by imposing
Silence upon the Senses and Imagina
tion.
Cyrus, after taking a View of all
these Wonders, apply'd himself to
learn the History, Policy, and Laws
of antient Egypt, which. were the
Model of those of Greece.
He found that the Egyptian Priests
had compil'd their History of an un-

bounded Succession of Ages. They
took a Pleasure in losing themselves
in that infinite Abyss of Duration,
when Ofiris govern'd Mankind him
self. All the Fictions with which
they have fill'd their Annals, about
the Reign of the Gods and Demi-
Gods, are but Allegories to express
the first State of Souls before their
Descent into mortal Bodies.
According to them, Egypt was then
the favourite. Abode of the Gods,
and the Place of the Universe with
which they were most delighted.
After the Origin of Evil, and the
great Revolution which happen'd by
the Rebellion of the Monster Typhon,
they believ'd that their Country was
the least chang'd and disfigur'd of any.
Being watered by the Nile, it con
tinued fruitful,' while all Nature be
sides was barren. They look'd upon
Egypt as the Mother of Men and all
Animals.

Their first King was nam'd Menes.
Their History from his Time is con-
fin'd within reasonable Bounds, and
is reduc'd to three Ages. The first,
from Menes to the Shepherd-Kings,
takes in Five hundred Years. The
second, from the Shepherd-Kings to
Sefoflris, is of the same Duration.
The third, from Sesojlris to Amajis,
contains six Centuries. *
During the first Age, Egypt was
divided into several Dynajlys, or
Governments, which had each its
King. Their principal Residences
were at Memphis, Thanh, This,
Elephantis, and Thebes. This last
Dynasty fwallow'd up all the rest,
and became Mistress. Egypt, in
those earliest Times, had no foreign
Commerce, but confin'd itself to
Agriculture and a Pastoral Life.

Shepherds were then Heroes, and
Kings Philoiophers. In those Days
lived the first Hermes, who pene
trated into all the Secrets of Nature,
and of Divinity. It was the Age of
occult Sciences. The Greeks, said the
Egyptians, imagine that the World
in its Infancy was ignorant 5 but
they think so, only because they them
selves are Children. * They know
nothing of the Origin of the World,
its Antiquity, and the Revolutions
which have happen'd in it. The
Men of Mercury's Time had yet a
Remembrance of their first State, and
had diverse traditional Lights which
we have lost. The Arts of Imitation,
Poesy, Musick, Painting, every thing
within the Province of the Imagina-
tion, are but Sports of the Mind,
in Comparison of the sublime Sciences
known by the first Men. Nature
was then obedient to the Voice of the
Sages. They could put all its hid-

den Springs in Motion. They pro-
duc'd the most amazing Prodigies
whenever they pleas'd. The Aerial
Genii were subject to them.* They
had frequent Intercourse with the
Ætherial Spirits, and sometimes with
the pure Intelligences that inhabit the
Empyreum. c We have lost, said
the Priests to Cyrus, this exalted
kind of Knowledge. We have
only remaining some Traces of it
upon our antient Obelisks, which
are, so to speak, the Registers of
our Divinity, Mysteries, and Tra
dition, relating to the Deity and to
Nature, and in no wise the Annals
of our Civil History, as the Igno
rant imagine.'
The second Age was that of the
Shepherd - Kings, who came from
Arabia. They over-ran Egypt with
Two hundred thousand Men. The

Barbarity of these unpolish'd and igno
rant Arabians, made the sublime and
occult Sciences be despis'd and forgot
ten. Their Imagination could re
ceive nothing but what was Material
and Sensible. From their Time the
Genius of the Egyptians was intirely
chang'd, and turn'd to the Study of
Arts, Architecture, Commerce, War,
and all the superficial kinds of Know
ledge, which are useless to those who
can content themselves with simple
Nature. It was then that Idolatry
came into Egypt. Sculpture, Paint
ing and Poesy obscur'd all pure Ideas,
and transformed them into sensible
Images. The Vulgar stop there,
without seeing into the hidden Mean
ing of the Allegories.
Some little time after this Invasion of
the Arabians, several Egyptians, who
could not support the Yoke of Fo
reigners, left their Country, and settled
themselves in Colonies in all Parts of
the

the World. From thence came all
the great and famous Men in other
Nations. The Babylonian Belus,
the Athenian Cecrops, the Bœotian
Cadmus. Thence it is, that all the
Nations of the Universe owe their
Laws, Sciences, and Religion to
Egypt. In this manner spoke the
Priests to Cyrus.
In this Age liv'd the second Her
mes, calYdTrismegiJlus. He was the
Restorer ofthe antient Religion. He
collected the Laws and Sciences of

The third Age was that of Con
quests and Luxury. Arts were per
fected more and more 5 Cities, Edi
fices, and Pyramids multiplied.
The Father of Sefojlris caus'd all the

i68 The Travels of Cyrus.
Children who were born the same
Day with his Son, to be brought to
Court, and educated with the same
Care as the young Prince. Upon
the Death of the King, Sesojtris
levy'd a formidable Army, and ap
pointed the young Men who had
been educated with him, to be the
Officers to command it. There were
near Two thousand of them, who
were able to inspire all the Troops
with Courage, military Virtues, and
Attachment to the Prince. They
consider'd him both as their Master
and their Brother. He form'd a De
sign of conquering the whole World,
and penetrated into the Indies, far
ther than either Bacchus or Hercules.
The Scythians submitted to his Em
pire. Thrace and Jfia Minor are
full of the Monuments of his Victo
ries. Upon those Monuments are to
be seen the proud Inscriptions of,
Sesostris King of Kings, and Lord of
Lords. Having; extended his Con-
quests
The Travels of Cyrus. 160
quests from the Ganges to the Tianube,
and from the River Tanais to the
Extremities of Africa, he return'd
after Nine Years Absence, loaded with
the Spoils of all the concjuer'd Na
tions, and drawn in a Chariot by the
Kings whom he had fubdu'd.
His Government was altogether
Military and Despotical. He lessen'd
the Authority ofthe Pontiffs,and trans
fer'd their Power to the Commanders
of the Army. After his Death Divi
sions arose among those Chiefs.
They were become too powerful to
continue united under one Master.
Under Anijis the Blind, Sabacon the
Ethiopian took Advantage of their
Discords, and invaded Egypt. This
Religious Prince re-establifh'd the
Power of the Priests, reign'd fifty
Years in a profound Peace, and then
return'd into his own Country, to
obey the Oracles of his Gods. The
Kingdom thus forsaken, fell into the
Hands
170 ^TuAVELS o/CyRUS.
Hands of Sethon the High-Priest of
Vulcan, who entirely destroyed the
Art of War among the Egyptians,
and despised the Military Men. The
Reign ofSuperstition, which enfeebles
Courage, succeeded that of despotick
Power, which had too much depress'd
it. From that time Egypt was sup
ported only by foreign Troops, and
it fell by degrees into Anarchy.
Twelve Nomarchs, chosen by the
People, shar'd the Kingdom between
them. One of them, named 'Pfam-
metichus, made himself Master of all
the rest. Egyptrecover'd itselfa little,
and continued pretty powerful for five
or six Reigns • till at length this an-
tient Kingdom became tributary to
Nahuchodonofbr King ofBabylon.
The Conquests of Sesojlris were
the Source of all these Calamities.
Princes who are insatiable of Con
quering, are Enemies to their Posterity.
By seeking to extend their Dominion
too
The Travels of Cyrus. 171
too far, they sap the Foundation of
their Authority.
From that time the antient Laws
were no longer in Force. Cyrus col
lected the Principal of them from his
Conversation with all the great Men
and old Sages who were then living.
These Laws are reduced to three,
upon which all the rest depend.
The First relates to Kings, the Second
to Polity, and the Third to Civil
Justice.
The Kingdom was Hereditary,
but the Kings were obliged to observe
the Laws with greater Exactness than
others. The Egyptians esteemed it a
criminal Usurpation upon the Rights
of the Great Ofiris, and as a mad
Presumption in a Man to give his
Will for a Law.
As soon as the King rose in the
Morning, which was at the Break of
Day,
17* The Tft-Av els os Cyrus.
Day, when the Understanding is
clearest, and the Soul most serene, an
exact: and distinct: Idea was given him
of all Matters upon which he was to
decide that Day. But before he
pronounc'd Judgment, he went to
the Temple to invoke the Gods, and
to offer Sacrifice. Being there, sur
rounded by all his Court, and the
Victims standing at the Altar, he
assisted at a Prayer, full ofInstruction 5
the Form of which was as follows :
' Great Osiris ! Eye of the World,
* and Light ofSpirits I Grant to the
c 'Prince, your Image, all Royal
* Virtues, that he may he religious
' towards the Gods , and benign
c towards Men 5 moderate, just ,
* magnanimous, generous, an Enemy

1 punishing less than the Crime
c deserves, and rewarding beyond
< Merit!
1 After
The Travels of Cyrus. 173
After this, the High-Priest repre
sented to him the Faults he had com
mitted against the Laws 5 but it was
always suppos'd that he fell into them
by Surprize, or through Ignorance 5
and the Ministers, who had given
him evil Counsels, or had disguis'd
the Truth, were loaded with Impre
cations.
After the Prayer and the Sacrifice,
they read to him the Actions of the
Heroes and great Kings, that the
Monarch might imitate their Example,
and maintain the Laws which had
render'd his Predecessors illustrious,
and their People happy.
What is there that might not be
hop'd for from Princes accustom'd,
as an essential Part of their Religion,
to hear Daily the strongest and most
salutary Truths ? Accordingly, the
greater Number of them were so dear
to
174 The Travels os Cyrus.
to their People, that each private
Man bewail'd their Death like that of
a Father.
The Second Law related to Polity,
and the Subordination of Ranks.
The Lands were divided into three
Parts. The First was the King's
Domain 5 the Second belong'd to the
Chief Priests 5 and the Third to the
Military Men. For it scem'd absurd
to employ Troops for the Defence of
a Country, who had no Interest in
its Preservation.
The common People were divided
into three Classes, Husbandmen,
Shepherds, and Artizans. These
three Sorts made great Improvements,
each in their Professions: Being
brought up to them from Generation
to Generation, they made Advantage
of the Experience of their Ancestors.
Each Family transmitted its Know
ledge and Skill to the Children of it.
2 No
tshe Travels os Cyrus. 175
No Person was allow'd to go out of
his Rank, or to forsake his hereditary-
Employment. By this means Arts
were cultivated and brought to a
great Perfection $ and the Troubles,
occasion'd by the Ambition of those
who seek to rise above their natural
Condition, were prevented.
To the End that no Person might
be asham'd of the Lowness of his State
and Degree, Arts were held in Honour.
In the Body Politick, as in the Na
tural, all the Members contribute
something to the common Life. It
seem'd a Madness in Egypt to despise
a Man because he serves his Country
in a more laborious Employment.
And thus was a due Subordination of
Ranks preferv'd, without Envy in one
Sort, or Contempt in the other.
The Third Law regarded Civil
Justice. Thirty Judges, drawn out
of the principal Cities, compos'd the
supreme

supreme Council, which judg'd the
Kingdom. The Prince assign d them
Revenues sufficient to free them from
Domestic Cares, that they might
give their whole Time to the compo
sing good Laws, and making them
be observ'd. They had no further
Profit of their Labours 5 except the
Glory and Pleasure of serving their
Country in the noblest Way.
To avoid. Surprize in giving Judg
ment, the Pleaders were forbidden
that delusive Eloquence,which dazzles
the Understanding, and moves the
Passions. They expos'd the Matters
of Fact: with a clear and nervous
Brevity, stript of the false Orna
ments of Reasoning. The President
of the Senate wore a Collar of Gold
and. precious Stones, at which hung
a small Figure without Eyes, which
was call'd Truth. He apply'd it to
the Forehead and Heart of him who
was to gain his Cause 5 for that was
the
The Travels of Cyrus. 177
the Manner of pronouncing Judg
ment.
There was in Egypt a fort of
Justice unknown to other Nations.
As soon as a Man had yielded his last
Breath, he was brought into Judg
ment, and the publick Accuser was
heard against him. In cafe it ap-
pear'd that the Behaviour of the De-
ceas'd had been contrary to the Laws,
his Memory was branded, and he
was refus'd Burial, if he was not
accus'd of any Grime against the
Gods, or his Country, his Pane-
gyrick was made, and he was en-
tomb'd honourably.
Before he was carry'd to the
Sepulchre, his Bowels were taken
out, and put into an Urn 5 which
the Pontiff raising towards the Sun,
made this Prayer in the Name of the
Deceas'd *.

was deposited in the Pyramids.
Such were the Notions of the an-
tient Egyptians. Being full of the
Hopes of Immortality, they imagin'd
that human Frailties were expiated
by our Separation from the mortal

committed against the Gods and

re-united to its Origin.
. These Things gave Cyrus a great
Desire to instruct himself throughly
in the Religion of antient Egypt.
For this Purpose he went to Thebes.
This famous City, whose hundred
Gates have been fung by Homer■,
might dispute with all the Cities in
the Universe for Magnificence, Ex-
, tent and Power. 'Tis said, that it
was able heretofore, to march out of
each of its Gates Ten thousand fight
ing Men. Doubtless there is some
thing ofpoetical Fiction in this, but all
agree that its Inhabitants were exceed
ingly numerous. - .

after to Sonchis the High-Priest of

Country. Sonchis conducted him
into a spacious Hall, where were
three hundred Statues of Egyptian
Pontiffs. This long Succession for so
many Ages, gave the Prince a high
Notion of the Antiquity of the
Religion of Egypt, and a great Cu
riosity taknow the Principles of it.
4 To make you acquainted, said
c the Pontiff", with the Origin of our
c Worship, Symbols, and Mysteries,
* I must give you the History of
' Hermes Trifmegijlus, who was the
c Founder of them.
1 Hermes, the second of the Name,
was of the Race of our first Sove
reigns. While his Mother was
with Child of him, {he went by
Sea to Libya, to make a Sacrifice
to 'Jupiter Hammon. As she coast
ed along Africa, a sudden Storm
arose, and the Vessel perifli'd near
a Desart Island. She was, by a
' particular
The Travels o/Cyrus. 181
1 particular Protection of the Gods,
' cast upon the Island all alone.
* There she liv'd a solitary Life, un-
* til her Delivery, at which Time she
' died. The Infant remain'd expos d
* to the Inclemency of the Weather,
' and the Fury of the wild Beasts :
* But Heaven, which intended him
* for great Purposes , preserv'd
* him in the midst of these Misfor-
* tunes. A young She-Goat, of
c which there were great Plenty in
* this Island, hearing his Cries, came
* and suckled him till he was past In-
* fancy. For some Years he fed up-
c on the tender Grafs, with his Nurse,
c but afterwards upon Dates and
c wild Fruits, which seemed to him
c a more proper Food.
' He perceived by the first Rays
* of Reason, which began to shine
c in him, That he was not of the

c tion3 and Address than they 5 and
* thence he suspected, That he might
? be of a different Nature.
c The She-Goat, which had nou

serv'd the like before. He could'

so long cold, and without Motion.
He compar'd all he saw in her with
what he felt in himself, and per-
ceiv'd that he had a Beating in his
Breast, and a Principle of Motion
in him, which was no longer in
her. He saw her by Degrees pu-
trify, grow dry, and fall to Pieces.

which we have affixed to our.Ideas.
Hermes reason'd thus : -The Goat

* of Lifey since it has loft it, and
* cannot restore it to itself,
1 He sought a long Time what

c vive every Year, by the going

' ture seem'd to languish in the Ab-
' sence of the Day. He concluded
' therefore, That the Stars 'were not
x thefirji 'Principles of Life.
1 As he advanced in Age, his Un-
* derstanding ripen'd, and his Re
flections became more profound.
i He had remark'd, that inanimate
Bodies could not move of them
selves 5 that Animals did not re?
store Motion to themselves when
they had lost it, and that the Sun
did not revive dead Bodies.
1 Thence he concluded, That the
First Mover was something
greater than the Sun or the
Stars.
c Reflecting afterwards upon him
self, and upon all the Remarks
which he had made from the first
Use of his Reason, he observ'd,
1That
The Travels of Cyrus, 185
* That there was something in him
' which felt, which thought, and
* which compared his Thoughts to-
c gether. After having meditated
' whole Years upon all those Opera-
* tions of his Mind, he concluded at
c length, That the First: Mover had
•' Understanding as well as Force,
' and that his Wisdom was equal to his
' 'Power.
c Man in the midst of Beings who
' can give him no Succour, is in a
4 frightful Situation. But when he
c discovers the Idea of something
c which is able to make him happy,
* there is nothing which can compare
* with his Hopes and his Joy.
' The Desire of Happiness, inse-
' parable from our Nature, made

* verse with him. Is I could, said
' he , make him understand my

' Thoughts, and my 1>ejires, doubt~
c less he would render me more happy
' than I am.
c His Hopes and his Joy were
1 soon disturb'd by great Doubts.
' Alas ! said he, // the First Mover

1 Why has he not made himself known
1 to me ? And above all, Why am I
* in this mournful Solitude, where I
c fee nothing like myself, nothing
i which seems to reason as I do, no-
1 thing which can give me any Asp-
' fiance.
c In the midst of these Per-
' plexities, his weak Reason was
* silent, and could answer him no-
c thing. His Heart spoke, and turn-
' ing itself to the first Principle, said
* to him, in that mute Language

c than Words : Life of all Beings !

Jlus was steeping at the Foot of a
Tree, Hermes came and fat down
by him. Trismegijtus was fur-
priz'd, when he awak'd, to behold
a Figure like his own. He utterM
some Sounds, but they were not
articulate. He discover'd all the
different Motions of his Soul, by
the Transports, Earnestness, and
ingenuous and artless Signs, where
by Nature teaches Men to express
what they strongly feel. .
c Mercury
1 88 The Travels os Cyrus.
' Mercury in a little Time taught
c the Savage Philosopher the Egyptian
1 Language. Afterwards he inform'd
c him what he was, and what he
* was to be, and instructed him in
' all the Sciences, which Trismegijlus
1 since taught the Egyptians. He
' then began to discern several Marks,
c which he had not observed before,
c of an infinite Wisdom and Power,
* diffus'd throughout all Nature :

' of human Reason, when left to it-
' self, and without Instruction. He
1 was astonish'd at his former Igno-
1 ranee, but his new Discoveries pro-
1 due'd new Perplexities.

c speaking to him of the noble De-

had his particular Qualities and
Passions 5 but all Passions were sub
servient to the Love of Virtue 5
and all Talents applied to the
Discovery of Truth. The Beau
ties of Nature, and of its Author,
were the Diversion, Enter

' This terrestrial Life., how happy
soever, was nevertheless but the
Infancy of our Beings, in which
Souls were prepar'd for a successive
unfolding of Intelligence and Hap

* of that Prince, ascended the Throne,
' and made Egypt for a long Time
1 happy, by the Wisdom of his
' Laws.
' He wrote several Books, which
1 contain'd the Divinity, Philosophy,
c and Policy of the Egyptians. The

* nious Art of expressing all Sorts

* vention most wonderful for its

c admired because it is common.

* Trismegifius conceal'd the My

expos'd nothing to the Eyes of the
Vulgar but the Beauties of his Mo
rality. This has been the Method
of the Sages in all Times, and of
the great Legislators in all Coun
tries. These divine Men knew,
that corrupted Minds could not re
lish sublime Truths, till the Heart
was purg'd of its Passions : For

Cyrus understood by this History
of Hermes, that the O/iris, Orus,
and Typhon of the Egyptians, were
the same with the Oromazes, My*'
thras, and Arimanius of the 'Per-
fians 5 that the Mythology of these
two Nations was founded upon the
same Principles, and express'd the

After Sonchis had entertained

that the Sun cannot draw them up

the Earth, not being overcharged with
them, become plenteous Sources of

is only discernable in the great Oce^

causes those regular Motions, and of
the Distance and Magnitude of that
Planet, which are wifely adjusted to

to Sparta.

It was situated in a wild and
barren Valley $ the Eurotas flow'd
through it, and often laid waste
the whole Country by its Inunda

one side by inaccessible Mountains,
and on the other by little Hills,
which were stor'd, not with those
Riches which are the Beauties of Na
ture, but with every thing that is *
necessary to supply Mens Wants,
The Situation of the Country had
contributed very much to the Warlike
and Savage Genius of its Inhabitants.
As Cyrus enter'd the City, he beheld
only plain and uniform Buildings,
very different from the stately Palaces
he had seen in Egypt. Every thing
still spoke the primitive Simplicity of
the Spartam. But their Manners
were upon the Point of being cor

He humdur'd neither Princes, nor

Chilo, who had educated the two

the Spartans to shew to Strangers.

stituted by Lycurgus.
* Before thatLegislator's Time, the
Kings of Sparta had been absolute. But
Eurytion, one of those Kings, having
yielded some Part of his Prerogatives
to please the People, a Republican
Party was thereupon form'd, which
became audacious and turbulent.
The Kings would have resum'd their

would not suffer it5 and this con

To establish an even Ballance of
the Kings and Peoples Powers which
lean'd alternately to Tyranny and
Anarchy, Lycurgus instituted a Coun
cil of Twenty eight Senators 5 whose
Authority being in a Mean betwixt
the two Extremes, deliver'd Sparta
from its domestick Dissensions.
Thirty Years after him, 'Theo-
pompus having observ'd, that what
had been resolv'd by the Kings
and their Council, was not always
agreeable to the Multitude, establisti'd
certain annual Magistrates, call'd
Ephori, who were chosen by the
People, and consented in their
Name to whatever was deter-
min'd by the King and Senate.
Each private Man look'd upon these
unanimous Resolutions as made by
himself. And in this Union of the
Head with the Members, consisted
the Life of the Body Politick at
Sparta.
Cyrus
The Travels o/Cyrus^ 213
Cyrus saw the two Kings sitting in
their supreme Council, which was
held in a Hall hung with Matt, that
the Magnificence of the Place might
not divert the Senators Attention.
This Council of about forty Persons,
was not liable to the Tumult and
Confusion which frequently reign'd in
the Consultations of the People at
Athens,
After Lycurgus had regulated the
Form of the Government, he gave
the Spartans such Laws as were pro
per to prevent the Disorders occasions
by Avarice, Ambition, and Love.
In order to expel Luxury and
Envy from Sparta, he resolv'd to
banish for ever, both Riches and
Poverty. He persuaded his Country
men to make an equal Distribution
of all their Wealth, and of all their
Lands j decry'd the Use of Gold and

Silver, and ordain'd that they should
have only Iron Money, which was
not current in foreign Countries. He
chose rather to deprive the Spartans
of the Advantages ofCommerce with
their Neighbours, than to expose
them to the Misfortune of bringing
home from other Nations, those In
struments of Luxury which might
corrupt them.
To prevent the Ambition of
private Men, and to fix and strengthen
an Equality among the Citizens, they
ate together in Publick Halls, but
separate. Each Company had Li
berty to choose its own Guests. No
one was admitted there but with the
Consent of all 5 to the End, that
Peace might not be disturb'd by Dif
ference or Humours 5 a necessary Pre
caution for Men naturally fierce and

Cyrus went into these Publick
Halls, where the Men were seated
without any Distinction but that of
their Age. They were surrounded
by Children, who waited on them.
Their Temperance and Austerity of
Life was so great, that other Nations
used to say, It was better to die,
than to live like the Spartans. During
the Repast, they discours'd together
on grave and serious Matters 5 the
Interests of their Country, the Laws
of Sparta, the Lives of the Great
Men, the Difference of a good and
bad Citizen, and of whatever might
form Youth to the Taste of military
Virtues. Their Discourse contain'd
much Sense in sew Words 5 for which
Reason the Laconick Style has been
admir'd in all Nations. By imitating
the Rapidity of Thought, it gave the
Pleasure of hearing all in a Moment,
and of discovering a profound Mean

graceful, fine and delicate Turns of
the Athenians were unknown at
Lacedamon. The Spartans were for
Strength in the Mind as well as in
the Body.
Upon a Solemn Festival, Cyrus and
Arajpes desir'd to be present at the As
semblies of the young Lacedæmonians,
which were held within a large In
closure, surrounded with diverse Seats
of Turf rais'd one above another, in
Form of an Amphitheatre. There
theybeheld young Girls., almost naked,
contending with Boys in Running,
Wrestling, Dancing, and all Sorts of
laborious Exercises. The Boys were
not permitted to marry any but such
as they had vanquish'd at these
Games.
Cyrus was fhock'd to fee the
Liberty, which reign'd in these Pub-
lick Assemblies, between Persons of
different Sexes 5 and could not
forbear representing it to Chilo.

great Inconsistency in the Laws of
Lycurgus. His Aim was to have
a Republick only of Warriors,

nevertheless, he has not been afraid
to expose them to Sensuality, which
may weaken their Courage.

Here Cyrus, struck with a lively
Remembrance of Cajfandana, and of
the pure Pleasures of their mutual

an Abhorrence of these odious Ma
xims. He despis'd Effeminacy, but
he could not relish the Spartan
Roughness, which sacrific'd the sweet
est Charms of Society to Ambition,
and knew not how toreconcile military
Virtues with tender Passions. How
ever, as he was sensible that Chilo
would little understand what he
meant by such Sentiments, he con

In reality, great Care was taken of
the Education of Children at Sparta*
They were chiefly taught to obey,
to undergo Labour, to conquer in
Combats, and to face Pain and Death
with Courage. They went with
their Heads and Feet naked, lay up
on Rushes, and ate very little 5 and
this little they were obliged to procure
by Dexterity, in the publick Banquet
ing Rooms. Not that the Spartans
authorized Thefts and Robberies 5 for

lics those Vices could have no

to accustom Children, who were de
stin'd for War, to surprize the Vigi

them, and to expose themselves cou
rageously to the severest Punishments,
iri case they fail'd of that Dexterity
which was exacted of them.

made little Account of them. No
shing, however, was neglected, to
awaken in Children the Taste of

Strength ofJudgment 5 but all Kinds
of Studies, which were not ser
viceable togood Manners, were look'd
upon as useless and dangerous Occu

The Spartans employ'd themselves
in no sort of Labour but these Exer

Prejudice in Times of Peace.
This Discourse rais'd in Cyrus a
Curiosity to know the military Dis
cipline of the Spartans, and he signi
fy'd it to Chilo. The next Day the
Kings of Sparta order'd Leonidas to
assemble the Lacedæmonian Trobps in
a spacious Plain near the City, that
they might pass in Review before
Cyrus, and let him see the Exercifi
in use among the Greeks.

2i6 The Travels os Cyrus.
Leonidas appear'd in a military
Dress. His Cask was adorn'd with
three Birds, of which that in the
Middle was the Crest. Upon his
Cuirass was the Head of Medusa,
All the Attributes of the God Mars
were represented upon his Shield,
which was a Hexagon 5 and he held
in his Hand a Staff of Command.
Cyrus and Jrajpes, being mount
ed upon two proud Steeds, rode out
of the City with the Spartan Gene
ral, who knowing how fond the
Prince was of Instruction, entertain'd
him in the Way, after the following
Manner :
c Greece is divided into several
c Republicks, each of which main-
c tains an Army in Proportion to its
' Extent. We do not affect to bring
1 prodigious Armies into the Field,
t like the Jsiatkks, but to have

c are too expensive to a State. Our
* invariable Rule is to encamp so,
c that we may never be oblig'd to
fight against our Will. A small
Army, well practis'd in War, may,
by entrenching itself, oblige a very
numerous one to disperse its Troops,
which would otherwise soon be de
stroys for Want of Provisions.
' When the common Cause of
Greece is to be defended, all these
separate Bodies unite, and then no
State dares attack us. At Lacedæmon
all the Citizens are Soldiers. In the
other Republicks, all forts of Peo
ple are not promiscuously admitted
into the Soldiery, but the best Men
are chosen out for the Army, such as
are bold, robust, in the Flower of
their Age, and inur'd to laborious
Exercises. The Qualities reejuir'd

and Foot. At their Head were the
ipolemarchi, and the Commanders of
the several Corps. They all march'd
with the Sound of Flutes, their Heads
crown'd with Flowers, and singing
the Hymn of Cajlor. They were
cloath'd in Red, that in the Heat of
Action the Sight of their own Blood

soever I have for Lycurgm, I can
not admire this Form of Govern

War, who have no other Exercise,
Study, or Profession, but to make
themselves able and dexterous in
destroying other Men, ought to be (

only for the Liberty of each State,
but for the common Security of all
the neighbouring ones. To set
ourselves loose from the rest of
Mankind, to look upon ourselves
as made to conquer them., is to arm
all Nations against us. 'Tis here
again that Lycurgus has departed
both from Nature and Justice,

and at length stopt at Corinth, which
was the most flourishing Republick
of Greece, after those of Sparta and
Athens.
As he enter'd the Town, he beheld
all the People in Mourning. Several
Players upon Flutes marched ac
the Head of a Funeral Procession,
and increas'd the publick Sorrow by
their plaintive Sounds. A Company
of young Girls bare-footed, their Hair
dishevel'd, and cloathed in long
white Robes, surrounded the Bier,
and melted into Tears when they
fung the Praises of the Dead. A little
after follow'd the Soldiers, with a slow
Pace, a sorrowful Air, their Pikes
revers'd, and their Eyes upon the
Ground. At their Head march'd a
venerable old Man. His noble and
military Air, his tall and majestick
Stature, and the bitter Grief that was
painted upon his Face, drew the At
tention of Cyrus. The young Prince

his Tomb. ■ t
Cyrus and Arafpes join'd them
selves with the Crowd, which was
going to a Fortress call'd Acrocorin-
thus. It was built upon the Summit
of a high Mountain, from whence
might be seen a vast Extent of Coun
try, together with the Ægean and
Ionian Seas 5 for which Reason it was
calFd the Eye of Greece.
Being come to the Fortress, which
was the Burial Place of the Kings,
'Periander, first of all, pour'd Wine,
Milk, and Honey upon the Body of
his Son. He then lighted with his
own Hands the Funeral Pile, upon
which had been strew'd Incense,
Aromatick Spices, and sweet Odors.
He remain'd mute, immoveable,
and with his Eyes drown'd in Tears,

while the devouring Flames con
sumed the Body. After having
sprinkled the yet smoaking Ashes with
perfum'd Liquors, he gathered them
together into a Golden Urn 5 and
then making a Sign to the People
that he was going to speak, he thus
broke Silence. ' 'People of Corinth,

* and to deliver you from Slavery.
' Lycophron is dead. My whole
* Race is extinff, and I will reign no

* Rights and your Liberties.'
As soon as he had laid these Words,
he order'd all the Assembly to retire,
cue off his Hair to denote his Sorrow,
and (hut himself up in the Tomb
with his Son. This Event gave Cy-
vus a great Desire to know the Cause
of it, and he received the following

should meet, and then throw his

saw there new Monuments of the

the Tomb of Oedipus and Jocajla 5

that this famous City had chang'd its
Form of Government, which was
become Popular. He had seen the
like Alteration in several Cities of
Greece. All those little States had
been at first Monarchical, but by the
Weakness or Corruption of Princes,
were chang'd into Republicks.

season'd his Discourse with historical
Remarks, agreeable Descriptions, and
ingenious Turns, which delighted all
the Assembly.

of the Freedom usual at Banquets, to

The next Day Cyrus signify'd to

This Philosopher, aster his Travels,

to be declared King. But having
understood with how much Wisdom
and Moderation he govern'd, he was
reconcil'd to him.

held the famous Council of Areopa

lively Chearfulness, and those Beauties
ofthe Mind which never grow old. He
embrac'd Cyrus with that affectionate
Tenderness which is natural to old
Men, when young Persons seek their
Counsels and Conversation, in order
to learn Wisdom. Tijistratus know
ing that the Prince's Design in vi
siting Solon-, was to inform himself
throughly of the Athenian Laws,
retir'd, and left them alone.
That they might discourse with the
greater Liberty? and more agreeably,
the Sage conducted him to the Top of
the Hill, where they found a delightful
Verdure, and seated themselves at
the Foot of a great Oak.
From this Place they beheld the
fertile Plains and crgggy Mountains of
Attica, which bounded the View on

the Saronic Gulph, widening by-
Degrees, open'd a Prospect of several
Islands which seem'd to float upon
the Waves. At a greater Distance
the rising Coasts of Argolh seem'd to
lose themselves in the Clouds, while
the Sea, which appear'd to touch the
Skies, terminated the View, and re-
liev'd the Eye, weary with surveying
so great a Variety of Objects.

which extended itself upon the De
clivity of a Hill. The numerous
Buildings rose one above another,
and their different Structure shew'd
the different Ages of the Republick 5

and its rising Magnificence in the Time
of Solon. In one Part might be seen

cover'd the warlike and rustick Taste
ofantient Times. The River Ilijsus,
which flow'd near the City, and
winded through the Meadows, added
a thousand natural Beauties to those
of Art.
It was in this agreeable Place that
Cyrus desir'd Solon to give him an
Idea of the State of Greece, and par
ticularly of Athens. He thought it
would please the old Man, to furnish
him with an Opportunity of recount
ing the Services he had done his
Country 5 and the wise Lawgiver
satisfy'd his Curiosity in the following
manner :
c All the Grecian Families are de-
* fcended from Hellen Son of ?Deu-
* calion, whose three Children gave
€ their Names to the three Sorts of
c Greeks 5 Æolians, ^Dorians, and

selves several Cities, and from those
Cities came Hercules, Theseus,
Minos, and all those first Heroes, to
whom Divine Honours are given, in
order to (hew that Virtue can be
rewarded only in Heaven.
' Egypt first inspir'd the Greeks,
with a Taste for Arts and Sciences,
initiated them into her Mysteries,
and gave them both Gods and
Laws. Greece being thus civiliz'd,
sorm'd itself by Degrees into several
Republicks. The supreme Council
of the Amphitfyones, compos'd of
the Deputies of the principal Cities,
united them all in the same View,
which was, to preserve Indepen-
dance Abroad, and Union at
Home.

Athenians took this Occasion to

and declared Jupiter sole King of

Rebellion, and to shake off the
Yoke of all settled Authority.
' In the Place of the Kings, they
created perpetual Governors, under
the Name of Archons 5 but this

not leave so much as a Shadow of

Magistracies to one Year, that they

* The first Source of all those
Evils, was the excessive Power of
the People. Monarchical Autho
rity, moderated by a Senate, was
the primitive Form of Government
in all wise Nations. I was desi
rous to imitate Lycurgus in the
Establishment of it., but was too
well acquainted with the natural
Temper of my Countrymen, to
undertake it. I knew that if they suf

1 lence. I therefore contented my-
1 self with setting Bounds to it.
1 I was throughly sensible, that
no State can subsist without some
Subordination. I distributed the
People into four Classes, and chose
an hundred Men out of each
Class, whom I added to the Council
of Areopagus. I shew'd these
Chiefs, that sovereign Authority,
of what Kind soever, is but a ne
cessary Evil, for preventing greater
Evils 5 and that it ought only to
be employ'd to restrain Mens Pas
sions. I represented to the People
the Mischiefs they had suffer'd by
giving themselves up to their own
Fury. By this Means, I dispos'd the
one, to command with Moderation 5
and the other, to obey with Rea
diness.

Here Cyrus interrupted Solon, and
said to him, ' But aster all, methinks

c I understand you, said Cyrus 5
Sovereignty and Ranks are necessary
Evils to keep the Passions within
Bounds. The lower Sort ought
to be content with meriting the in
ternal Esteem of Men, by their
simple and modest Virtue 5 and
the Great should be persuaded that
nothing but outward Homage will
be paid thenr, unless they have true
Merit. By this Means, the one
Sort will not be dejected with their
low Condition 5 nor the other
pride themselves too much, in their
Grandeur. Men will become sen
sible, that Kings are necessary 5 and
Kings will not forget, that they are
Men. Each Man will keep him
self within his own Sphere, and the

sturbs. I see clearly the Beauty
of this Principle, and am very im

4 The second Source of the
Miseries of Athens, said Solon, was
the excessive Riches of some,
and the extreme Poverty os
others. This terrible Inequality in
a popular Government, occafion'd
eternal Disorders. I durst not at
tempt to remedy this Disorder, by
establishing a Community of Goods
as at Sparta. The Genius of the
Athenians, which carries them to
Luxury and Pleasures, would never
have suffered such an Equality : But
in order to diminish our Evils, I
abolish'd all Debts 5 I began by
remitting those which were due to
me. I enfranchis'd all my Slaves,
and forbad any one for the future,
to pledge his Liberty for what he
borrow'd.
c I never tasted so much Pleasure,
as in relieving the Miserable. I
retain d enough for my own Per-

The Travels of Cyrus 275
son, and was therefore rich 5 but
I esteem'd my self poor,because I had
not sufficient to distribute something
to all the Unfortunate. I spread
abroad at Athens this useful Maxim,
That all the Members of the fame
Commonwealth ought to feel and
compassionate the Miseries of one
another, as Tarts of the fame
Body.
c The third Source of our Miff
chiefs, was the Multiplicity of
Laws, which is as evident a Token
of the Corruption of a State, as
a Diversity of Medicines is of the
Distempers of Bodies.
* Here again I could not imitate
Lycurgus. Community of Goods,
and an Equality of all the Mem
bers of a Republick, render use
less a great many Laws and Forms,
which are absolutely necessary,
where there is an Inequality of
T 2 ' Ranks

Ranks and Property. I contented
my self with abolishing all those
Laws, which serv'd only to exer
cise the subtle Genius of the So
phists, and the Skill of the Law
yers 5 reserving only a small Num
ber of such as were simple, short,
and clear. By this Means I avoid
ed contentious Chicane, that Mon
ster, produc'd by the idle Subtlety
of Men, to elude Justice. I fix'd
certain Times for the final Deter
mination of . Law-Suits, and or-
dain'd severe and disgraceful Pu
nishments for the Magistrates, who
should lengthen them beyond the
Bounds prefcrib'd. Lastly, I abo-
lifh'd the too severe Laws of 2)raco,
which punilh'd the smallest Weak
ness, and the greatest Crime, equally
with Death, and I proportion'd the
Punishment to the Offence.
e
c The fourth Source of Evils.,
was the bad Education of Chil-
1 dren.

dren. None but superficial Qua
lities, Wit, bright Imagination, and
Gallantry, were cultivated in young
Persons. The Heart, Reason, no
ble Sentiments, and solid Virtues,
were neglected. The Value, both
of Men and Things, was rated
by Appearances, and not by Rea
lity. The Athenians were serious
about Trifles, and look'd upon
solid Matters as too abstracted.
' In order to prevent these Mis
chiefs., I ordain'dthat the Council of
Areopagus should super-intend the
Education of Children. I would
not have them educated in such
Ignorance, as the Spartans, nor
confin'dj as before, to the Study
of Eloquence, Poesy, and those
Sciences, which serve only to adorn
the Imagination. I would have
them apply their Thoughts to all

portion of Numbers, the Calcula
tion of the Cœlestial Motions, the
Structure of the Universe, the great
Art of knowing how to mount up
to first Principles, to descend to
Consequences, and to open the
whole Chain of Truths.
* These speculative Sciences never
theless, serve only to exercise and
cultivate the Mind, in the Time of
Youth. The Athenians, in a riper
Age, apply themselves to the Study
of the Laws, Policy, and History,
to learn the Revolutions of Empires,
the Causes of their Rife, and the
Occasions of their Fall 5 in a Word,

c The fifth and last Source of our
' Evils, was an unbridled Taste for
' Pleasures. I knew that the Genius

* sensible that I could not subdue
- those Republican and untractable
* Souls, but by making use of their
* Inclination towards Pleasure, to
' captivate and instruct: them.
' In the publick Shews, I caused
c to be represented the fatal Conse-

' all the Vices prejudicial to Society.
1 By this Means, multitudes of Men,
' assembled in the fame Place, were
f induced to spend whole Hours in
c hearing Lessons of a sublime Mora-

Lycurgus found, in his Spartans,
a Genius, apt to all heroick Virtues.
I found, in the Athenians, a Bent
towards all the Vices, which make
Men effeminate. I will venture to
fay, that the Laws of Sparta, by
carrying the Virtues to an Extreme,
transform them into Faults. My
Laws, on the contrary, tend to

c render even the Weaknesses of Men
* useful to Society. This is all that
* Policy can do. It does not change
1 Mens Hearts 5 it only restrains their
' Passions.
* I thought, continu'd Solon, to
have prevented, or remedied, the
greatest Part of our Evils, by the
Establishment of these Laws 5 but
the Restlessness of a People, accu-
stom'd to Licentiousness, occasions
me daily Vexations. Some blam'd
my Regulations 5 others pretended
not to understand them: Some were
for making Additions to them 3
others for retrenching them. I per-
ceiv'd then how useless the most
excellent Laws are, without a
fix'd and stable Authority, to put
them in Execution. How unhappy
is the Lot of Mortals ! By endea
vouring to avoid the terrible Evils
of popular Government, they run

was arm'd like the Daughter of

her Hand a shining Lance 5 but her
Face was veil'd. I seated myself
with her in a Triumphal Chariot,

While Cyrus staid at Athens, 2*/-
Jijtratus and Solon conducted him
often to the Theatre. Stately Edifi
ces, pompous Decorations, and the
nice Rules, which have been since
observed, were not then known.
Tragedy was not in that Perfection
to which it was brought by Sophocles 5
but it answer'd all the Views of Po
licy, for which it was introduc'd.
The Greek Poets, in their Drama
tic Performances, usually represented
the Tyranny of Kings, in order to
strengthen the Aversion which the
Athenians had to Royalty : But $*'$-
Jljlratus directed the Deliverance of
Andromeda to be acted. The Poet
had scatter'd, throughout his Tragedy,
several Strokes of Panegyrick, which
were the more delicate, as they might
be apply'dj not only to 'Perseus, but

to Cyrus, who was descended from
him. After this, Solon led the young
Prince to Areopagus, to take a
Repast there 5 which was more frugal
than that at the Palace of tPi/tJlra-
tus, but not less agreeable. Du
ring the Entertainment, Cyrus de-
sir a the old Sage to explain to him
the Nature, Design, and principal
Parts, of Tragedy, which he did not
yet understand. Solon, who was
himself a Poet, answer'd :
c The Theatre is a living Picture
' of the Virtues and Passions of Men.

umphs of Virtue and Courage over
Vice and Fortune 5 the other re
presents the unforeseen Mischiefs
caus'd by the Passions. The one
may abound with the Marvellous
and Supernatural, because it treats
of heroick Virtues, which the Gods
alone inspire 5 but in the other,
where human Passions prevail, the
Natural must be joined with the
Surprizing, to shew the Effect and
Sport of those Passions. The heaping
Wonders upon Wonders, transports
the Mind beyond the Limits of Na
ture, but it only excites Admiration.
On the contrary, by describing the
Effects of Virtue and Vice, both
without and within us, Man is
brought to see and know himself 5
the Heart is touch'd, while the
Mind is diverted.
c The Virtmus, the Useful, and

most beautiful Flowers, Graces,

Imagination, without satisfying the
Heart, or improving the Under
standing. Solid Principles, noble
Sentiments, and various Characters
must be dispers'd throughout, in
order to display to us, Truth, Vir
tue, and Nature. Man must be
represented as he is, and as he ap
pears 5 in his native Colours, and
under his Disguises5 that the Picture
may resemble the Original, in which
there is always a Contrast of Vir
tues and Imperfections. Never
theless it is necessary to conform to
the Weakness of Mankind. Too
much Moralizing disgusts 5 too
much Reasoning tires. We must
turn Maxims into Action, convey
noble Sentiments by a single
Word, and instruct rather by the
Manners of the Hero, than by his
Discourse.
< These

* These are the great Rules found
ed upon human Nature, and the
Springs which must be put in Mo
tion to make Pleasure serviceable
to Instruction. I foresee that one
Day these Rules may be improv'd,
by introducing into such Entertain
ments, all the Arts of Imitation,
Painting, Musick, and Dancing,
as well as Poesy. Hitherto I have
contented my self with making the
Theatre a School of Philosophy, for
the young Athenians, and useful
to their Education. It argues an
Ignorance of human Nature, to at-
tempt to lead it to Wisdom at once
by Constraint and Severity. Du

Youth, there is no fixing the At

Cyrus comprehended by this the
great Designs, both Political and
Moral, of the Theatre 5 and saw
clearly at the same Time, that the
principal Rules of Tragedy are not
arbitrary, but taken from Nature.
He thought he could not better shew
his Thankfulness to Solon for his In
structions, than by letting him see
the Impression they had made upon
him.

embracing him, and laying : ' Hap-.

The young Prince, at parting,
made the same Promise to cPiJijlra-
tus, which he had made to Chilo and
Leonidas, of being ever a faithful
Ally to Greece. He embark'd, with
Araspes, at the Port of 'Phalerus, in
a Rhodian Vessel, which was bound
for Crete.
Cyrus's Design in going thither,
was not only to study the Laws of

Minos, but likewise to see 'Pythago
ras, who had stopp'd there in his
Way to Croton. All the Eastern
Magi, whom that Sage had seen in
his Travels, had spoken of him to
the Prince with Encomiums. He was
esteem'd the greatest Philosopher of
bis Age, and to understand, best of
all Men, the ancient Religion of Or
pheus. His Dispute with Jnaxi-
mander, the Naturalist, had fill'd all
Greece with his Fame, and divided
all the Learned. Arafpes had been
inform'd of this Matter by the Phi
losophers of Athens, and during the
Voyage, gave Cyrus the following
Account of it :
' 'Pythagoras, who was descended
4 from the ancient Kings of the Island
* of Santos, had been captivated with
c the Charms of Wisdom from his ten-
* derest Years. He discover'd, even
* from that Time, a superior Ge-
* nius, and a sovereign Taste for

Truth. Not finding at Samos any
Philosopher, who cou'd satisfy his
eager Thirst for Knowledge, he
left it at Eighteen Years of Age, to
seek elsewhere what he could not
meet with in his own Country.
After having travell'd for several
Years in Egypt and Asia, he re
turned Home, fraught with all the
Sciences of the Chaldeans, Egyp
tians, GymnofophifiS, and He
brews.
* The Sublimity of his Genius was
equal to the Extent of his Learning,
and the excellent Qualities of his
Heart surpass'd both. His lively and
fertile Imagination did not hinder
the Justness of his Reasoning.
c Anaximander had gone from his
own Country, Miletus, to the
'- Island of Samos. He had all the
Talents which can be acquir'd by
; Study 5 but his Understanding was
' more
3io The Tr a v e l s of C y r u s.
more subtile than solid, his No
tions more learned than luminous,
and his deluding Eloquence full of
Sophistry. He was impious in the
very Bottom of his Soul, yet af
fected all the outward Appearances
of an extravagant Superstition. He
held, as 1)i<vine Truths, all the
Fables of the Poets, and stuck to
the literal Sense of their Alle
gories. He adopted all the vulgar
Opinions as Principles, in order to
degrade Religion, and make it
monstrous. His Impiety did not
proceed only from the Vanity of
making himself the Head of a new
Sect, but from ill Nature. He
hated Mankind, and to gratify his
Humour, endeavour'd to destroy
all the true Pleasures of the Mind,
and all the sweet Hopes which the
Idea of Immortality inspires.
c 'Pythagoras loudly oppos'd his
mischievous Maxims, and endea-

vour'd to purge Religion of those
absurd Opinions which dishonour
it. Anaximander, covering him
self with the Veil of a deep Hypo
crisy, took Occasion from thence
to accuse him of Impiety.
1 He secretly made use of all Arts
to incense the People, and alarm
^Polycrates, " who then reigri'd at
Samos. He addressed himself to
all the Sects of Philosophers, and
to the Priests of the different Di
vinities, to persuade them that the
Samian Sage, by teaching the
Unity of one sole Principle, de
stroy'd the Gods of Greece. The
King esteem'd and lov'd Pythago
ras. Nevertheless he suffer'd him
self to be surpriz'd and impos'd
upon, by the artful Representati
ons, which Anaximander contriv'd
to have laid before him. The Sage
was banish'd from Court, and
obliged to quit his Country.'

This magnificent Building stood
within a large Enclosure,in the midst of
a sacred Wood . The Entrance into it
was through a Portico of twenty Pillars
of Oriental Grenate. The Gate was
of Brass, finely carv'd. Two large
Figures adorn'd the Portal, the one
representing Truths the other Justice.
The Temple was an immense Arch,
which let in the Light only above,
in order to hide from the Eye all

At certain Distances one from an

Statues of Terrestrial Divinities be
tween the Pillars. The Dome was
cover'd on the outside with Plates of
Silver, and adorn'd on the inside
with the Images of Heroes, who had
been deify'd for their Merit.
Cyrus enters this Temple* The
Silence and Majesty of the Place
fill him with Awe and Respect. He
prostrates himself, and adores the
Divinity present. He had learnt from
Zoroaster, that the Jupiter of the
Greeks was the same with the Oro-
mazes of the Persians, and the Osiris
of the Egyptians.
He then cast his Eye over all the
Wonders of Art which were to be
seen in this Place. He was less struck
with the Richness and Magnificence

of the Altars, than with the Noble
ness and Expression of the Statues.
As he had learnt the Greek Mytho
logy, he could easily distinguish all
the Divinities by their Attributes, and
discern the Mysteries of Religion, in
the allegorical Figures which were be
fore him.
That which drew his Attention
more especially, was, that each of
the Celestial Deities held in his Hand
a Tablet of massy Gold , upon
which were written all the exalted
Ideas of Minos in Religion. They
were the Answers which different O-
racles had given that Lawgiver, when
he consulted them about the Nature
of the Gods, and the Worship they
requir'd.

into the sacred Wood adjoining to
the Temple.
Cyrus then said to him, ' That

After this they sat down near a
Statue of Minos, which was in the
midst of the sacred Wood , and the
Philosopher rehears'd to them all the

Anaximander , answer'd I, sub
stitutes irregular Passions in the
Room of noble Sentiments. He
affirms boldly, but he proves no
thing. This is not my Method \
my Proofs are these :
* The Soul is a Particle of the
Divine Nature, and therefore may
imitate the Gods. The Gods do
good for the sole Love os Good 5
consequently she may love it as
they do. Such was the primitive
Nature of Man. Anaximander
cannot deny it without over-throw
ing Religion.

upon all the social Duties. If we*

consider himself, as an independent
* Being, made for himself. There
' will be no Reason to sacrifice pri-
* vate Interest to publick Good. No-
4 ble Sentiments and heroick Virtues
4 will be destroy'd. Nor is this all :
4 Every conceal'd Crime will soon
4 be authoriz'd. If Virtue be not
4 amiable for it self, each Man will
' forsake it, when he can hide him-
4 self from the Eyes of the Publick.
* He will commit all Crimes with-
4 out Remorse, when Interest carries
4 him to it j and he is not with- held
4 by Fear : And thus is all Society

4 consider Religion or Policy, both
4 conspire to prove my Doctrine.

Gods. He says, that we must re
semble them. They swim in De
lights above, and nothing disturbs
their Repose. To imitate them,
we likewise must love Pleasure.
They give us Passions, only that
we may satisfy them. Jupiter
himself shews us an Example.
Pleasure is the great Law, both of
mortal and immortal Natures. Its
attractive Force is irresistible, and
it is the only moving Spring of
Man's Heart/
c We always love zvith Pleasure,
answer'd I, but we do not always
love for the sake of Pleasure. We
may love Justice for the Good
which it procures us^ and we may
also love it for it self. It is this
which makes the Difference between
heroick and common Virtue. The
true Hero does noble Actions from
noble Motives.

treated me as an impious Person,
and an Enemy of Religion. Per

of Anaximander , and the blind
Zeal of the People, who were de

4 Further, I perceive in my self
' and in several Beings with which I
4 am encompass'd, a reasoning Prin-
4 ciple which feels, thinks, compares
' andjudges. Now it is absurd to sup-
f pose that Matter without Thought
* and Sensation, can become sensible
4 and intelligent, meerly by shifting
* its Place: There is no Connection
' between these Ideas. I allow that
' the Quickness of our Sensations de-
' pends often upon the Motion of
* the Humours in the Body 5 and
c this proves that Spirit and Body
' may be united, but by no Means
* that they are the fame ; and from
* the whole I conclude, that there is
* in Nature another Substance be-
4 fides Matter, and consequently that
' there may be a Sovereign Intelletl,
* much superior to yours, to mine,
' and to all those with which we are
* acquainted.
The Travels of Cyrus.
c In order to know whether there
* be such an Intellect, I run over all
' the Wonders of the Universe. I
' observe the Constancy and Regu-
* larity of its Laws, the Fruitfulness
* and Variety of its Productions,
c the Connection and Agreement of
c its Parts, the Conformation of A-
t nimals, the Structure of Plants,
1 the Order of the Elements, and
c the Revolutions of the Heavenly
c Bodies. I cannot doubt but that
* all is the Effect of Art, Contri-
' vance, and an infinite Wisdom.
* And from this I conclude, that the
' infinite Force which you acknow-
1 ledge to be in Nature, is a sove-:
' reign Mind.
' I remember, said Cyrus, ( inter-
i rupting him here) that Zoroaster
1 laid open to me all those Beau-
' ties and wonderful Appearances.

Thus ended the Conversation be
tween Cyrus and Pythagoras. The
Prince was touch'd with the Conside
ration of the Weakness of human
Understanding. He saw oy the Ex
ample of Anaximandeir , that the
most subtile Genius's may go gradu
ally from Impiety to Extravagance*
and fall into a Philosophical Deliri
um, which is as real a Madness as
any other.

^ Nature. Equality of Ranks, and

Cyrus saw there all that regarded
Religion, Morality arid Policy, and
whatever might contribute to the
Knowledge of the Gods, himself, and
other Men. He found in this sacred
Book all that was excellent in the
Laws of Egypt, Sparta, and Athens,
and thereby perceiv'd, that as the
Egyptian Knowledge had been use
ful to Minos, so Lycurgus and Solon
were indebted to the Cretan Law

their Institutions: And it Was upon

found there great Men os all Kinds,
profound Philosophers, able Cap

Things.
' It is true , they love the agree

than abstract Ideas j the Arts of

is true indeed, we find sublime
Ideas, and learned Discoveries a-
mong the Chaldeans and Egyptians 5
but their pretended Depth is often
full of Obscurity. They know
not, like the Greeks, how to come
at bidden Truths, by a chain of
known and easy Truths. That in
genious Method of ranging each
Idea in its proper Place, of Leading
the Mind by degrees from the most
simple Truths to the most com
pounded, with Order, Perspicuity,
and Brevity, is a Secret with which
the Chaldeans and Egyptians, who
boast of having more of ori
ginal Genius, are little acquainted.
This , nevertheless , is the true
Science, by which Man is taught
the Extent and Bounds of his own
Mind , and it is for this Reason
that I prefer the Greeks to other
Nations, and not because of their
Politeness.

( True Politeness is common to\
delicate Souls of all Nations, and
does not belong to any one People
in particular. External Civility is
but the Form establish'd in the dif
ferent Countries for expressing that
Politeness of the Soul. I prefer
the Civility of the Greeks to that
of other Nations, because it is more
simple, and less troublesome. It
excludes all superfluous Formality.
Its only Aim is to render Compa
ny and Conversation easy and a-
greeable. But internal Politeness
is very different from that superfi
cial Civility.
c You were not present that Day,
when Pythagoras spoke to me up
on this Head. I will tell you his
Notion of Politeness , to which
his own Practice is answerable.

4 ment, to perceive immediately the
4 different Characters of Men 3 and
4 by a sweet Condescension, adapts it
4 selfto each Mans Tafte, not to flat-

4 a word, it is a forgetting of our
4 selves, in order to seek what may
4 be agreeable to others ; but in so
4 delicate a manner as to let them
4 scarce perceive that we are so em~

and Virtue of Ecnibal. He spent
some Days at his Court, to instruct
himself in the Rules of Commerce,
and desir'd the King of Tyre to ex
plain to him, how he had brought his
State into such a flourishing Condi
tion in so short a Time.
' Phœnicia, said Ecnibal, has al-
4 ways been renown'd for Commerce.
4 Tyre is happily situated : The
' Tyrians understand Navigation bet-
' ter than other People. At first,
4 Trade was perfectly free , and
' Strangers lookcl upon themselves
* as Citizens of Tyre : But under
' the Reign of Itohal all fell to Ruin.
' Instead of keeping our Ports open,
4 according to the old Custom, he
4 shut them out of political Views.

Commerce ought to be encourag'd,
without being universal. In a

Cyrus comprehended by the Dis
course of Amenoph'n, that the chief
Study of a Prince should be to know
the Genius of his People, and the
Maxims proper for the Kingdom
which he governs, that he may con
form himself to them.

are agreeable or useful to Mankind.
Whole Days were spent , in Fasting,
Praver and Lamentations; after
which the publick Sorrow was of a
sudden changed into gladness. Songs
of Joy succeeded to Weeping, and
they all tun'd this sacred Hymn*.

closes her Eyes, and her Soul flies a-
way to the Empyreum. She was long
lamented by all Persia ^ and Cambyfes
erected a stately Monument to her
Memory. Cyrus's Grief did not
wear off but by degrees, and as Ne
cessity oblig'd him to apply himself
to Affairs.
Cambyfes was a religious and pa-
cifick Prince. He had never been
out of Persia, the Manners of which
were innocent and pure, but austere
and rugged. He knew how tp chuse
Ministers capable of supplying what
was defective in his own Talents:
but he sometimes abandon'd himself
too much to them, by a Diffidence
of his own Understanding.
He prudently resolv'd, that Cyrus
should himself enter into the Admi
nistration of Affairs j and having
sent for him one Day, said to him 5
t Hitherto
The Travels of Cyrus.
* Hitherto you have only been

it for the Good of your Country.
You are destin'd not only to go

Under the Government of Camby*
ses this Minister had found the Ne
cessity of appearing virtuous, nay,
he thought himself really so ; but his
Virtue had never been put to the
Tfial. Soranes did not himself
know the Excess to which his bound
less Ambition could carry him.
When Cyrus apply'd himself to
learn the State and Condition ofPer<>
fia, its military Strength, and its In^
terests, both foreign and domestick,
Soranes quickly saw with Concern,
that he was going to lose much of
his Authority, under a Prince, who
had all the Talents necessary for
governing by himself. He endea
vour'd to captivate the Mind of Cy-
rus, and studied him a long time to
discover his Weaknesses.
The young Prince feeling himself
not insensible to Praise, was upon his

Guard against it, but lov'd to de
serve it. He had a Taste for Plea
sure, without being under its Domi
nion. He did not dislike Magnifi
cence, but he could refuse himself
every Thing, rather than oppress his
People. Thus he was inaccessible to
Flattery, and averse to Voluptuous
ness and Pomp.
Soranes perceiv'd that there was
no Means to preserve his Credit with
Cyrus, but by making himself neces
sary to him. He display'd all his
Talents, both in publick and pri
vate Councils. He shew'd that he
was Master of the Secrets of the wi
sest Policy, and above all, that he
understood that Detail, which is the
chief Science for a Minister. He
prcpar'd and digested Matters with
so much Order and Clearness, that
he left the Prince little to do. Any
other but Cyrus would have been
eharm'd to see himself excus'd from

resolv d to see every Thing with his
own Eyes. He had a Confidence in his
father's Ministers,but would not blind

When Soranes perceiv'd that the
Prince would himself see every Thing
to the Bottom, he study'd to throw
Obscurity over the most important
Affairs, that he might make himself
yet more necessary. But Cyr us manag'd
chis able and jealous Minister with fa
much Delicacy, that he drew from
him by degrees, what he endeavour'd
so artfully to conceal. When the
Prince thought himself sufficiently in
structed, he let Soranes see, that he
would himself be his Father's first
Minister 5 and in this Manner, he
redue'd that Favourite to his proper
Place, without giving him any just
Cause of Complaint.
Soranes s Ambition was nevefthe-

theless offended by this Conduct of
Cyrus. His Pride could not bear,
without mortal Uneasiness, to see his
Credit lessening, and himself no lon
ger necessary. This was the first
Source of his Discontent, which might
have prov'd fatal to Cyrus, if his
Virtue, Prudence and Address had
not presserv'd him from its Effects.
Persia had for some Ages been in
Subjection to Media, but upon the
Marriage of Cambyses with Manda-
na, it had been stipulated that the
King of Persia should for the fu
ture pay only a small annual Tri
bute as a Mark of Homage.
From that Time the Medes and
Persians had lived in perfect Amity,
tijl the Jealousy of Cyaxares kindled
the Fire of Discord. The Median
Prince was incessantly calling to mind,
with Vexation, the Oracles which
Vol. II. H were
The Travels of Cyr
were spread abroad concerning the
suture Conquests of young Cyrus.
He consider'd him as the Destroyer
of his Power, and imagin'd already,
that he saw him entring Ecbatan to
dethrone him. He was every Mo
ment sollicking Aflyages, to prevent
those fatal Predictions, to weaken
the Strength of Persia, and to re
duce it to its former Dependance.
Mandana, while she liv'd had so
dextrously manag'd her Father, as to
hinder an open Rupture between
him and Cambyfes. But as soon as she
was dead, Cyaxares renew'd his Sol
icitations with the Median Emperor.
Cambyfes was inform'd of Cyax-
aress Designs, and sent Hyjlafpes to
the Court of Ecbatan , to represent
to Aftyages the Danger of mutually
weakening each other's Power, while
the Affyriam, their common Enemy,
were
The T RAVELS of CYRtJS.
were forming Schemes, to extend
their Dominion over all the East.
Hyftajpes, by his Address, put a
Stop to the Execution of Cyaxaress
Projects, and gain'd Cambyses Time
to make his Preparations* in ease of
a Rupture.
The Prince of Media, seeing that
the wise Counsels of Hyfiaspes were
favourably listen'd to by his Father,
and that there was no Means sudden
ly to kindle a War, attempted by
other Ways to weaken the Power of
Persia. Being inform'd of Soranes's
Discontent, he endeavour'd to gain
him, by an Offer of the first Dig*
nities of the Empire.
Soranes at first was shock'd at the
very Thought $ but afterwards being
deceiv'd by his Resentment, he knew
not himself the secret Motives up
on which he acted. His Heart was
not yet become insensible to Vii>

tue, but his lively Imagination trans-
sorm'd Objects, and represented them
to him in the Colours necessary to
flatter his Ambition. In the End, he
got the better of his Remorse, un
der Pretext, that Cyaxares would one
Day be his lawful Emperor3 and that
Cambyfes was but a tributary Ma
ster. There is nothing which we
cannot persuade our selves to think,
when blinded and drawn away by
strong Passions. Thus he came by
degrees into a strict Correspondence
with Cyaxares, and secretly employ'd
all Means to render Cyrus's Admini
stration odious to the Persians.
Cyrus had rais'd Araspes to the
first Dignities in the Army, upon
Account of his Capacity and Talent
for War : But he would not bring
him into the Senate, because the
Laws and Customs of Persia did not
allow Strangers to sit in the supreme
Council. The perfidious Soranes
never-

nevertheless, press'd the young Prince
to infringe these Laws, knowing that
it would be a sure Means to excite
the Jealousy of the Persians, and to
stir them up against Cyrus. 4 You

4 a Man like Araspes in your

Designs, but he lov'd Justice too
well to depart from it. ' I am per-
f suaded, answer'd the Prince, of the
f Fidelity and Capacity of Araspes. I
' love him sincerely j out though my
* Friendship were capable of making
' me break the Laws in his Favour,
* he is too much attach'd. to me, ever
' to accept a Dignity, which might
f excite the Jealousy of the Persians,
f and give them Cause to think, that I
£ acted from Inclination and Affection
4 in Affairs of State/
Soranes having in vain attempted
to ingage Cyrus to take this false Step,
endeavour'd to surprize him another
way, and to raise an Uneasiness be
tween him and his Father. He art
fully made him observe the King's
Imperfections, his want of Capacity
and Genius, and the Necessity of
pursuing other Maxims than his.
4 The mild and peaceful Govern-
f ment of Cambyfes, said he to him,
The Travels os Cyrus. 103
f is incompatible with noble Views.
* if you content your self, like him,
c with a pacifick Reign, how will
* you become a Conqueror?
Cyrus made no other Use of these
Insinuations, but to avoid the Rocks
upon which Cambyfes had split. It
did not lessen his Docility and Sub
mission to a Father whom he tender
ly lov'd. He respected him, even
in his Failings, which he endeavour'd
to conceal. He did nothing without
his Orders ,- but consulted him in such
a manner, as at the same time to
give him a just Notion of Things.
He frequently talk'd to him in pri
vate, that the King might be able to
decide in publick. Cambyfes had
Judgment enough to distinguish, and
make himself Master of the excel
lent Advices of his Son, who em-
ploy'd the Superiority of his Genius
only to make -his Father's Commands
respected, and made use of his Ta-
H 4 lents
104 The Travels of Cyrus.
lents only to strengthen the King's
Authority. Cambyses redoubled his
Affection and Esteem for Cyrus, and
his Confidence in him, when he saw
his prudent Conduct : But the Prince
took no Advantage of it, and thought
he did nothing but his Duty.
Soranes, seeing all his Schemes
frustrated , endeavour'd secretly to
raise a Distrust in the Minds of the
Satrapes, as if the Prince would in
trench upon their Rights, and ruin
their Authority ; and in order to aug
ment their Jealousy, he endeavour'd
to inspire Cyrus with despotick Prin
ciples.

Cyrus was fhock'd at this Discourse,
but conceal'd his Indignation out of
Prudence, and dextroufly breaking
off the Conversation, left Soranes in
a Persuasion, that he relish cl his
Maxims.
As soon as Cyrus was alone, he
made profound Reflections on all
that had pass'd. He call'd to mind
the Conduct of Amasis, and began
to suspect Soranes % Fidelity. He had
not indeed any certain Proofs of his
Perfidiousness , but a Man who had
the Boldness to inspire him with such
Sentiments, seem'd at least: verv dan-
gerous, though he should not be a
Traitor. The young Prince by de
grees excluded this Minister from the
Secret of Affairs, and sought for Pre
tences to remove him from about his
Person ; yet without doing any thing
to affront him openly.
The Travels 5/ Cyrus. i
Soranes quickly perceiv'd this
Change, and carry'd his Resentment
to the last Extremities. He persua
ded himself, that Araspes was going
to be put in his Place 5 that Cyrus
had a Design to make himself abso
lute Master in Persia 5 and that this
was the Prince's secret View in disci
plining his ^oops with, so much
Exactness.
His lively Imagination and suspi
cious Temper first work'd up his Pas
sions to the Height, and then Jealousy
and Ambition blinded him to such
a Degree, that he imagin'd he diet
his Duty in practising the blackest
Treasons.
He inform'd Cyaxares of all that
pass'd in Persia- the Augmentation
bf its Forces, the Preparations which
were making for War, and Cyrus's
Design of extending his Empire
4 Pve?
108 The Travels of Cyrus.
over all the East, under Pretext of
accomplishing certain pretended Ora
cles, by which he impos'd upon the
People. Cyaxares made Advantage
of these Advices, to alarm Aftyages,
and to insinuate Uneasiness and Dis
trust into his Mind. Hyftafpes was
order'd away from the Court of Ec-
batan, and the Emperor threaten'd
Cambyfes with a bloody War, if he
did not consent to pay the antient
Tribute, and return to the same De-
pendance, from which Persia was set
free, upon his Marriage with Man-
dana. Cambyfes's Refusal was the
Signal of the War, and Preparations
were made on both Sides.
In the mean while, Soranes endea-
vour'd to corrupt the chief Officers
of the Army, and weaken their Cou
rage, by insinuating, that Afiyages
was their lawful Emperor 5 that the
ambitious Designs of Cyrus would
ruin their Country; and that they
4 could

could never make Head against the
Median Troops, who would over
whelm them with Numbers.
He continu'd likewise to increase
the Distrust of the Senators, by art
fully spreading a Rumour among
them, that Cyrus undertook this un
natural War against his Grandfather,
only to weaken their Authority, and
to usurp an absolute Power.
He conceal'd all his Plots with
such Art, that it was almost impos
sible to discover them. Every Thing
he said was with so much Caution,
that there was no seeing into his fe-
cret Intentions. Nay, there were
certain Moments, in which he did not
fee them himself5 but thought that
he was sincere and zealous for the
publick Good. His first Remorses
•return'd from time to time, but he
stifled them, by persuading himself
that the ill Designs which he imputed
to the Prince, were real. Cy-
no The Travels of Cyrus.
Cyrus was quickly inform'd of the
Murmurs of the People, the Dis
content of the Army, and that it was
doubtful whether the Senate wou'd
give the necessary Subsidies. The Em
peror ofthe Medes was upon the Point
of entring Persia, at the Head of six
ty thousand Men. The Prince see

cruel Extremities, and the Necessity
of taking Arms against his Grand

As soon as the Preparations were

of his Army.

appear'd more zealous than any, and

The two Armies continued in
sight of each other for several Days.
Cyrus could not, without great Con
cern, look forward to the Conse
quences of a War against his Grand
father, and employ'd this time, in
sending to Ajlyagess Camp, a Satraps
named Attabasus, who spoke to him
in the following Manner.

The Emperor, still irritated by
Cyaxares, persisted in his first Re
solution, and Artabafus return'd,
without succeeding in his Nego

his principal Officers, and heard all
their Opinions. He then took his
Resolution, which he communicated
only to Hystaspes and Harpagm.
The Day following he caus'd a
Rumour to be spread abroad, that
he intended to retire, not daring to
engage with unequal Forces. Before
he left the Camp, he caus'd Sacrifi
ces to be offer'd, made the usual Li
bations, and all the Chiefs did the
same. He gave the Word, Mytbras
the Conduaor and Saviour , and
then mounting Horse, commanded
each Man to take his Rank. All the
Soldiers had Iron Cuirasies of divers
Colours, made like the Scales of
Fish. Their Casques or Tiara's
were of Brass, with a great white
Feather. Their Shields were made of
Willow -^ below which hung their
Quivers. Their Darts were short,,

panded. It was the same of which
the Kings of Persia have ever since
made use.
He decamp'd by Night, advanced
in the Plains of Passagarda , and
Ajlyages made haste to meet him ,
by Sun-rising. Cyrus immediately
drew up his Army in order of Battle,,
only twelve deep, that the Javelins
and Darts of the last Rank might
reach the Enemy and that all the
Parts might support and assist each
other without Confusion. Further,
he chose out of each of the Batta

form'd a triangular Phalanx , after
the Manner of the Greeks. He pla

Plain was cover'd with Dust and

advantagiouily, that the rising Dust
was driven full in the Faces of the
Medes., and favour'd his Stratagem.
Harpagus commanded the right
Wing, Hyftafpes the left , Araspes

every where.
The Army of the Medes was
compos'd of several square Batta

the Army were the Chariots, with

pretended to be wounded, and ask'd
Permission to go to Ecbatan.
Aftyages was conducted with Pomp
to the Capital of Persia, not like a
conquer'd Prince, but a victorious one.
Being no longer importun'd by the ill
Counsels of his Son, he made a Peace,
and Persia was declar'd a free King
dom for ever. This was the first Ser
vice which Cyrus did his Country.
The Success of thisWar, so contrary
to the Expectations of Soranes, open'd
his Eyes. If the Event had been an
swerable to his Desires, he would still
have continu'd his Perfidiousness. But
6nding that he was not free to es

to conceal them any longer, he

brought himself, the Crimes he had
committed, and the certain Disgrace
which would follow. Not able there-
sore to endure this Prospect, he falls
into Despair, kills himself, and leaves
a sad Example to Posterity, of the
Excesses to which mad Ambition
may carry the greatest Genius's, even
when their Hearts are not entirely
corrupted.
After his Death Cyrus was in
form'd of all the Particulars of his
Treachery. The Prince, without
applauding himself for having early
seen into the Character of this Mini
ster, beheld with Concern, and la

ded, Aftyages return'd to Media.
After his Departure Cyrus assembled
the Senators, Satrapes, and all the
Chiefs of the People, and said to
them, in the Name of the King,

Thus did Cyrus avoid all the Snares
of Soranes, triumph over the Plots of
Cyaxares, and restore Liberty to the
Persians. He never had Recourse to
Artifice, mean Dissimulation, or a
tricking Policy, unworthy of great
Souls.
Aftyages dy'd soon after his return
home, and left the Empire to Cy-
axares. Cambyses foreseeing, that

that Prince would soon excite new
Disturbances, resolv'd to seek an Al

It was six hundred Foot high, and

made the whole impenetrable to Rain,

cover'd all was of that Depth, as to

As soon as Cyrus was arriv'd at
Babylon, he went to fee Queen A-
mytis. This Princess had, for near -
seven Years, been plung'd in a deep
Sadness ; but she was beginning to
moderate her Grief, because the
Jews, who were then Captives in
the City, had promis'd her that the
King should be cur'd in a few Days.
The Queen was waiting that happy
Moment with great Impatience. The
Wonders which me had seen per
forms by Daniel, had made her
confide in what he said. Cyrus, from
a respectful Consideration of the Af
fliction of Amyits, avoided speaking to
her concerning the principal Design of
his Journey. He was sensible, that it
was not a favourable Conjuncture to
treat of political Affairs, and watted,
like the Queen, for the King s Cure-3

the mean while, he endeavour'd to\

Darnel was not then at Babylon,
but was gone to visit and console the
Jews, diipers'd throughout Assyria.
Amytis made Cyrus acquainted with
an illustrious Hebrew, named Elea-
zer, for whom she had a particular
Esteem. The Prince being inform d
by him, that the People of God did
not look upon the King's Frenzy as
a natural Distemper, but as a Punish
ment from Heaven, enquir'd of him
the Cause of it.

He frequently saw Eleazer, with
whom he came by degrees into a
strict Friendship. The Eternal, be
ing watchful over Cyras, whom he
had chosen, to bring about the De
liverance of his People, thought fit,
by his Conversation with this Hebrew
Sage, to prepare him to receive, soon
after, the Instructions of the Prophet
Daniel.
Ever since the Captivity of the
Israelites, the Hebrew Doctors, who
were dispers'd in the several Nations,
had apply'd themselves to the Study
of the profane Sciences, and endea-
vour'd to reconcile Religion with
Philosophy. In order thereto, they
embrac'd, or forsook the literal Sense
of the sacred Books, according as it
suited with their Notions, or was re
pugnant to them. They taught,

that the Hebrew Traditions were of
ten folded up in Allegories, accord
ing to the Eastern Custom ; but they
pretended to explain them. This
was what gave Rife afterwards to that
famous Sect among the Hebrews,
call'd the Æegorijls.
Eleazer was of the Number of
those Philosophers, and was, with
Reason, esteem'd one of the greatest
Gerimis of his Age. He was vers'd
in all the Sciences of the Chaldeans
and Egyptians, and had held several
Disputes with the Eastern Magi, to
prove, that the Religion of the "Jews
was not only the most antient, but
the most conformable to Reason.

They are all sensible, that Man is
not now what he was, and believe
that he will one Day assume a
more perfect Form. God cannot
suffer an eternal Blemish in his
Work. Evil had a Beginning, and
it will have an End. Then will
be the Triumph of Light over
Darkness. That is the Time fix'd
by Destiny, for the total Destruc

4 Nevertheless, there arises one
c great Difficulty, which no Philo-

f this great Difficulty. Shew me
i which way to justify the eternal
4 Wisdom. Why has God created
1 free Beings capable of Evil ? Why
' has he beflow'd on them so fatal a
< Gift?'
4 Liberty, answered Eleazer, is a
4 necessary Consequence of our rea-
* sonable Nature. To be free, is
4 to be able to chuse. To chuse, is
* to prefer. Every Being capable of
' Reasoning and Comparing can
4 prefer, and consequently chuse.

4 tween Bodies and Spirits: The one

rus, have hinder'd us from abusing
our Liberty, by shewing us Truth
with so clear an Evidence, that it
would have been impossible to
mistake ? When the sovereign
Beauty displays his infinitely at
tractive Charms, they seize and en
gross the whole Will, and make all
inferior Amiableness vanish, as the
rising Sundispels theShades ofNight.
c The purest Light, answered E'
leazer, does not illuminate those
who will not see. Now, every fi
nite Intelligence may turn his Eyes
from the Truth. I have already
told you that Spirits cannot inces
santly contemplate the Splendors of
the divine Essence 5 they are ob-
lig'd from time to time to cover
their Faces. 'Tis then that Self-
love may seduce and make them
take an apparent Good for a real
one. And this false Good may
dazzle and draw them away from

the true Good. Self-love is inse
parable from our Nature. God,
in loving himself, essentially loves
Order, because he is Order 5 but
the Creature may love it self with
out loving Order 5 and hence eve
ry created Spirit is necessarily and
essentially fallible. To ask why
God has made fallible Intelligences,
is to ask why he has made them
finite, or why he has not created
Gods as perfect as himself ? A
Thing impossible.
4 Cannot God, continiid Cyrus,
employ his Almighty Power, to
force free Intelligences to see and
relish Truth?'
4 Under the Empire of God him
self, answer1d Eleazer, despotick
Rule and Liberty are incompatible.
Inclination, Will, and Love, are
never fore'd. God does every
Thing he pleases in Heaven and
* upon
The Travels of Cyrus. i
' upon Earth 5 but he will not em-
c ploy his absolute Power to destroy
c the free Nature of intelligent Be-
' ings. If he did so, they would
c act no longer from Inclination and
4 Choice, but by Force and Necefli-
c ty. They would obey, but they
c would not love. Now Love is
c what God demands, and it is the
c only Worship worthy of him. He
' does not require it for any Advan-
' tage to himself, but for the Good
' of his Creatures. He will have
' them happy, and contribute to
c their own Happiness 3 happy by
4 Love, and by a Love of pure
* Choice. It is thus that their Me-
4 rit augments their Felicity.'
c I begin to understand you, said
c Cyrus. Moral Evil does not come
£ from the supremely good, wise,
c and powerful Being, who cannot
c be wanting to his Creatures, but

4 I have already told you, an-
c swerd Eleazer, that we are capa-
£ ble of a twofold Happiness. If
' God, after our Rebellion, con-
4 tinu'd to us the Enjoyment of

4 aspire to an Union with the Creator.
£ We should content our selves with

* preme Beatitude of our Nature.
4 The only Means to give free Be-

4 their Disorder, is to make them
£ feel,
The Travels o/ Cvrus. i
c feel, for a time, the fatal Conse-
4 quences of their wandring from
e him. God owes it to his Justice,
4 to punisli the Guilty, that he may
4 not countenance Crimes 3 and his
* Goodness likewise requires it, in
4 order to correct and reform the
' Criminal. Natural Evil is necef-

* God could not deprive Spirits of

4 of Intelligence nor hinder them
' from being fallible, without mak-
4 ing them infinite ; nor restore them

' Pains, without violating his Justice

Vol. II. M [ Yes,

f Yes, answered Eleazer, all will
1 suffer more or less, as they are
c more or less gone astray. Those
' who have never departed from
c their Duty, will for ever excel the
c rest in Knowledge and in Happi-
' ness. Those who delay their Re-
L turn to it, will be always inferior

* licity. The Return of Spirits to
* their first Principle, resembles the
4 Motion of Bodies towards their
c Center. The nearer they approach
c to it, the more their Velocity aug-
' ments.
This is the Order established by
c eternal Wisdom, the immutable
' Law of distributive Justice, from
* which God cannot deviate, without

fore he return'd to his Capital, he re-
solv'd to pay a publick Homage to
the God of Israel, in the same Place
where he had given the notorious In
stance of his Impiety.
He order'd Daniel to assemble the
Princes, Magistrates, Governors of
Provinces, and all the Nobles of
Babylon, and to conduct them to
the Plains of Dura, where he had
some Years before erected the fa
mous golden Statue. Cloatb'd with
M j his

his Imperial Robe, he mounts upon
an Eminence, from whence he may
be seen by all the People. He has
no longer any thing fierce or savage
in his Look. Notwithstanding the

ferings had redue'd him, his Coun

Capital, and resum'd the Govern

he rais'd Daniel to the highest: Dig

with the first Posts throughout his
vast Empire.
Some Days after, Amyt'is pre
sented Cyrus to Nabuchodonosor, who
receiv'd the young Prince in a most
friendly Manner, and gave him a
favourable Hearing. However, the

King's Council, represented to him
in very strong Terms That great In

And that it would be better Policy
to foment the Divisions between the
Medes and Persians, in order to
make them mutually weaken each o-
ther's Strength, and so give the King
of Babylon a fair Occasion of ex
tending his Conquests.
But Nabuchodonofor, who by the
Misfortunes he had sufTer'd , was
curd of all such false Maxims, did
not suffer himself to be dazzled by the
ambitious Projects of his Ministers.
And Cyrus observing his good Dis
positions, took that Opportunity to
lay before him the Advantages he
might find by an Alliance with
Cambyfes. He represented to him,
that the Medes were the only Rivals
of his Power in the East 5 That it
could not be for the Interest of the
King of Babylon, to let them grow
more considerable, by subjecting and

Friends, who might serve as a Bar
rier to his Empire against the Enter
prises of the Median Prince. And in
fine, that Persia lay very convenient
for the Babylonian Troops to march
through it into Media, in case Cy-
axares should resolve upon a Rup
ture.

the Books of Isaiah, which had
mention'd Cyrus by Name, a hun
dred and fifty Years before his Birth,

£ You have already learn'd by
the universal Doctrine of all Na

Purity of his Original. By dis
continuing to be just, he ceas'd to

close upon Crimes, and Men were
condemn d to a State of Pain and

£ For the first Ages after the Fall,
Religion was not written. The

Monsieur,
L'Histoire de Cyrus, & la Chronolo

être la partie de toute l'antiquité fur laquelle
on a imaginé le plus de Systemes differens,
mais tous ces Systemes font si defectueux &
si mal liez avec les evenemens contempo

embarras de ces Hypotheses : c'est ce qu'on
eprouve en lisant les ouvrages de Scaliger,
de Pctau, d'Usser, deMarfham, de l'Evçque
de Meaux, & de Prideaux.
Dans votre ouvrage, Monsieur, vous avez
sagement evité ces embarras, & vous avez
imaginé ce qu'il y avoit de mieux pour con

de Ctcfias, de Xenophoir, & des autres an

A LETTER from Mr. Fret et (Mem

cerning the Chronology of his
Work.
SIR,
rJ~,HE RE have perhaps been more dif-
ferent Systemsformed, to fettle the His
tory of Cyrus, and the Chronology of the
Kings ^Babylon, than for any other part
of antient Story. But these Hypotheses
are allso defensive, and so ill connectedwith
cotemporary Events-, that we arestopped al
most at every step, by the Contradictions and
Inconsistencies we meet with in them. This
every Mans Experience shews him to be
true, who reads the Writings of Scaligcr,
Petau, Usher, Marsham, the Bishop of Me-
aux, and Prideaux.
But in your Work-, you have wifely avoid
ed these Difficulties, and have hit upon the
best Method of reconciling the contradictory
Accounts, which Herodotus, Ctefias, Xeno-
phon, and other ancient Writers, give us
of Cyrus.
Tou have preserved this 'Prince's War
with his Grandfather Astyagesi a War which

plus simple & plus conforme à l'ancienne
Histoire. Vous avez preparé cette Guerre, &
vous l'avez conduite de telle façon qu'elle
ne ternit en rien le Caractere de votre
Heros.
La Suppression d'un Evenement si con
siderable a obligé Xenophon à faire deux
anachronismes pour remplir les premieres
années de Cyrus. Il a avancé la prise de
Sardis de 25 ans, & celle de Babylone de 28.

He suppressed this Faff, in his Cyropædia,
only to avoid throwing a Blemish on Cyrus'j
Character, by a War, which he thought con
trary to naturalDuty. Prideaux^j likewise
thought Jit to omit it. Marfham has in
vented a mere Romance, and supposes, that
there were two different Kingdoms of the
Medes, which were, at the fameTime, go
verned by two Astyages's, one the Grand-fa
ther, and the other the Enemy, of Cyrus.
The Method you have taken, is more sim
ple, and more agreeable to ancient Story. Ton
have paved the Wayfor this War, and con-
duffed it in such a Manner, that it does
in no wife stain the Character ofyour Hero.
The Omifjwn of so considerable an Event,
led Xenophon into two Anachronisms, in
order to findEmployment for Cyrus, in his
younger Tears. This Author antedates the
taking of Sardis, 2 5 Tears ; andthat of Baby
lon, 28.
As this Historian had nothing in view
but military Virtues and the Qualities of a
true Patriot, whereby toform his Hero ; his
Scheme did not furnish him with the fame
Materials, tofill up Cyrus's Touth, asyours
does. He had no Thoughts of instilling
into his Mind, such Principles as would
most effeffuallysecure himfrom the Dangers
which beset the Virtue of Princes-, or of
guarding him beforehand, against the Cor-

dont les suites sont egalement funestes pour
la Societé.
Xenophon elevé dans la Grece ne con-
noiflbit que les Rouyames de Sparte & de
Macedoine, où les Roys n'etoient à propre
ment parler que les premiers Citoyens de
l'Etat, & où les Magistrats ctoient leurs
Collegues plutôt que leurs ministres. Il
n'imaginoit point les abus du despotisme, &
navoit point pensé à les prevenir. Dans vo
tre plan, comme il s'agit de former un
Roy plutôt qu'un Conquerant, & un prince
qui scache encore mieux rendre les peuples
heureux sous son Gouvernement, que les
contraindre à se soumettre à ses loix, vous
avez trouvé de quoy remplir la Jeunesse de
Cyrus en le faisant voyager sans rien deran
ger dans la veritable Chronologie.
Cyrus est mort l'an 218 de Nabonassar,
530 ans avant Jesus Christ. C'est un point
que je ne m'arreteray pas à prouver. Il est
constant parmy tous les Chronologistes.
Ce Prince etoit alors âgé de 70 ans, selon
Dinon, auteur d'uneHistoire de Perse tres esti-
iiiée ; (a) donc il etoit né l'an 148 de Nabo-
nassar,6oo bu s 99 ans avant l'Ere Chretienne.

ruption of false Toliticks and false Thilo-
sophy, which are, in their consequences,
equally fatal to Seciety.
Xenophon having been educatedin Greece,
was acquainted only with the Kingdoms of
Sparta and Macedon, whose Kings were,
properly speaking, nothing more than the
chief ^Persons in the State j and the Magi
strates were rather their Collegues, than their
Ministers. He had no Notion of the Abuses
of despotick Tower, and therefore could have
no thoughts of preventing them. Whereas
your Design being toformaKing, rather than
a Conqueror, aTrincebetter qualify'dto make
his Teople happy under his Government, than
to force them to submit to his Laws ; you
are thereby enabled to give Cyrus full Em-
and that very consistently with true Chro
nology.
Cyrus died the 2 1 8th Tear of Nabonassar,
and 530 Tears before the Christian <^Æra,
which I shall not lose time in proving, be
cause acknowledged by all Chronologers.
This Prince was then 70 Tears ofAge, ac
cording to Dinon, the Author of a cele
brated History (1) of Persia. He was there
fore born in the 14.8th Tear of Nabonassar,
600, or 599 Tears before Christ. He had reign

adolescens & y reste 10 ans. L'historien a-

Destgn-, and your Chronology is not only
agreeable to that of the Greeks and Persians,
tut likewise to that os the Babylonians.
Xenophon indeed has changed all this
Chronology. According to him, Cyrus went
to the Court of Media, at i z Tears of Age;
Jlay'd there 4 Tears, returnedin hissixteenth
Tear, entered into the Class of the "Etpqfioi or
Young-men, in his seventeenth, and conti
nued in it 1 o Tears : to which he adds that
Astyages died in this Interval. But this
is not true ; for that Trince reigned till he
was conquered by Cyrus, in the Tear 560,
and did not die till some Tears after. Ton
have therefore done well in not following
Xenophon.
According to him, Cyrus enter'd Media
at the Head of 30000 Men, when he was
2 8 Tears of Age } subdued the Armenians
at 29 ; marched against the Lydians, and
took Sardis, at 30 ; and made himself Master
c/'Babylon, at 3 3, about theTear 5 67. This
is the 179th Tear of Nabonassar, and the
3 6th oj Nabuchodonosor, who reignedseven
Tears after it. These 7 Tears added to
the 2 1 Tears of the four Kings who reigned
in Babylon after him, make the 28 Tears
of the Anachronifm abovementioned.

1 3 ans qui avoit commencé la septieme

The City of Tyre was not taken, till the
1 9th Tear of Nabuchodonosor, after a thir-
teeen-Tears-fiege, which began the seventh
Tear of that 'Prince's Reign, according to
/^<? Phœnician Annals, which jofephus had
read. In the Tear Jerusalem was taken,
which was the i %th tear of Nabuchodono
sor, the Prophet Ezechiel threatens Tyre
with approaching ruin it therefore was
not taken at that time. Cyrus was then
1 5 Tears of Age. Now, as the Time when
Cyrus met with Amenophis again at Tyre,
might be about i 5 Tears later than this }
and as the Travels of Cyrus are allplaced
between the 28th and 3 id Tear of his Age ;
you are therefore guilty of no Anachronism
in this particular.
We have no where any express 'Passage,
whereby to fix the Time of Nabuchodono-
fov's Madness. That he was mad, is cer
tain, from Daniel : And it is veryprobable, it
happened towards the End of his Life. My

We are told in Jeremiah (5) and in the
(6) second Book of Kings, that in the 3 jth
Tear of Jehoiachin'j Captivity', Evilmero-
dach ascended the Throne of Babylon, took
Jehoiachin out of Prison, admitted him to
his own Table, and bestowed many Honours
upon him. This was the 14.8th Tear ofNz-
bonassar, the $6\th before Christ, and the
lllhof Qyixxgs Age-, at which time Nabu-
chodonosor was yet alive-, since he did not
die till the issth of Nabonassar, and the
39th of Cyrus. Evilmerodach therefore did
not only mount the Throne in his Father's
Lifetime, but he governed without consult
ing him, and with so little dependance up
on him, as not to fear provoking him, by
taking quite different Measures from his,
and heaping Honours on a 'Prince, whom
his Father had all along kept in Fetters.
Berosus makes the Prince, whom he calls
Evilmerodach to have reigned 10 Tears.
The Astronomical Canon allows him but
two, and calls him Ilovarodam. The Scrip
ture places him upon the Throne, three Tears
before the 'Death of his Father.

suppose, that NabuchodonosorV Madness

began 8 Tears before his Death, and that
his Son Evilmcrodac was from that Time
looked upon as King, placed himself at the
Head of Affairs, and governed the Em
pire with his Father's Ministers. These
8 Tears, joined with the two he reigned
alone ajter his Father's Death, make up
the 10 Tears of Berosus. The Holy Scrip
tures begin his Reign later, doubtless from
the Time that he removed the Ministers,
who made him uneasy, which didnot happen
till the third Tear before the Death of Na-
buchodonosor. This 'Prince's Madness con
tinued but 7 Tears after that time he re
covered his Senses, reajfumed the govern
ment, and published an Edifl in favour of
the Jews, which is related in Daniel. His
Name had all along been made Use of in
the publick Acts ; and for this Reason, the
Astronomical Canon makes his Son Ilova-
rodam to have reigned but z Tears. This
Canon was drawn up from thepublick Acts.
NabuchodonosorV Madness must have
produced great Revolutions, in the Court of
Babylon, and we mayform an Idea of them,
from what passed at the Court ^France,
during that of Charles VI: when the Ma
nagement of Affairs was sometimes lodged
in the Hands of the Queen, sometimes in
those of her Children, and sometimes in
those of the great Lords and Primes of

Upon this Supposition, which is both easy
and necessary, Nabuchodonosor'j Madness
will have happened, in the 179 Tear of Na-
bonassar, the 569th before Christ, and the
3 zd of Cyrus. This 'Prince must have been
informed of that Event, for it was of great
Importance to him to know it- It is not to
be doubtedbut it had its Influence in the War
of the Medes and Persians. The Babyloni
ans were alliedto the Medcs andtheirKings :
For Nabuchodonosor hadmarried a Daugh
ter of Astyages. They would have taken some
'Part in this War, {had it not been for the
Mediations Amytis ; whom we maysuppose
to have labour'd to reconcile the Medes and
Persians;) the Weakness of the Babylonian
Government; occasionedby the Madness ofthe
King, and the Divisions which prevailed
at Court, among the different ^Parties, who
contendedfor the Direction ofAffairs.
The Sight of fa famous a Conqueror re
duced to so deplorable a Condition, must
have been a very proper Spectaclefor the In
struction of Cyrus, andyou hadgreat Rea
son not to neglect it. He returned from
his Travels, according to your Chronology,
about the 3 id Tear of his Age, after Naba-
chodonosor'x Madness had already seized
him. Cyrus spent 7 Tears, under his Fa
ther's Government, in Persia, during which
Time, all the Intrigues between Cyaxares
and Soranes were carried on-, Cambyses

la fin de la Maladie de Nabucodonofor. Ce
Temps est bien choisy pour rendre le Spec
tacle plus touchant & plus Instructif.
Votre Chronologie fur les Evenemens
politiques & fur les Revolutions arrivées
du Temps de Cyrus est donc parfaitement
conforme à celle des Grecs, des Babyloni
ens, & des Hebreux. Examinons mainte

Vous savez combien les anciens font op

a vécu, ce qui vient fans doute de ce que
l'on a donné le nom de Zoroastre à tous
ceux qui ont reformé en differens temps la

fameux de tous, & le seul qui ait eté connu

made War with the Medes; Astyagcs died
and Cyrus went to Babylon, to negotiate
Affairs with Amytis, a little before Nabu-
chodonosor'j Madness left him. This time
was judiciously chosen, to make the Sight
more affecting and instructive.
Tour Chronology, with regard to politi
cal Affairs, and the Revolutions which
happened in Cyrus's Time, is therefore per
fectly agreeable to that of the Greeks, Eaby-
lonians, and Hebrews. Let us now enquire,
whether the Great Men, whom you make
Cyrus to have seen in his Travels; were
his Cotemporaries. Tou may indeed be al
lowed a greater Liberty in this Cafe than
in the former.
Tou know how the Antients contradict one
another with regard to the Time when Zo-
roaster lived; which doubtlessproceeds from
hence, that the Name of Zoroaster was
given to all those, who, at different Times,
reform d the Religion of the Magi. The
last of these was the most famous, and
is the only one, who is known by that Name,
or by the Name of Zardouscht, in the East.
Prideaux makes him cotemporarywith Cam-
byses, and Darius the Son of Hyfttfpcs But
it is very probable he livedsome Time before
them.
The Eastern Writers, as may be seen in
'Dr. Hyde'* Work, make him to have lived
under
r»;
Gustaspes, ou Hystaspes pere de Darab qui
est le Darius premier des Grecs. Ce Gus
taspes etoit plus âgé que Cyrus, & pou-
voit être le même que celuy que vous faites
son Gouverneur. D'où il iùit necessaire
ment que la reforme de la Religion des
Mages a du se faire pendant le Regne de
ce Prince, & que c'etoit alors que Zoroa
ster vivoir. La Reforme faite par Darius
suppose que les Mages s'etoient arrogés une
tres grande Autorité dont il les depouilla. Il
altera même la pureté de la Religion de
Zoroastre par le melange de l'Idolâtrie
Estrangerc. Ce fut fous son Regne que le
Culte d'Anaitis s'introduisit dans la Per se, &
cela ne s'accom ode pas avec les Hypothe
ses de Mr. Prideaux. Le Party que vous
avez pris est plus conformé à la fuite de
l'Histoire telle qu'elle resuite des faits qui
sons communs aux Grecs, & aux Historiens
Persans & Arabes.
Cyrus a pû epouser Cassandane a l'Age
de 18 ans, & vivre avec elle neuf ou dix
ans; de cette façon il a pû passer en Egypte
vers la 29e Année de son Age. Votre
Chronologie s'accorde parfaitment avec
l'Age d'Amalîs. Son Regne a finy de l'aven
de tous le Chronologistes un an avant
l'Expedition de Cambysc, c'est à dire vers
l'an 525 avant J. Christ, & la 63e Olym
piade. Herodote ne donne que 4+ ans de

under Gustaspes or Hystaspes, the Father of
Darab, who is the first Darius of the Greeks.
This Gustaspes was older than Cyrus, and
may have been the fame Ter
son, whom you
make his Governor. Whence it necessarily
follows, that the Reformation of the Re
ligion of the Magi must have been made
during his Reign, and that Zoroaster lived
at that Time. The Reformation made by
Darius supposes that the Magi had assumed
to themselves very great Authority, which
he took away from them. He likewise cor
rupted the 'Purity of Zoroaster's Religion,
by a Mixture of foreign Idolatry. In his
Reign, the ffbrjhip of Anaitis was first
brought into Persia, contrary to the Hypo
theses of Dr. Prideaux. Tour Scheme
is more agreeable to the Course of the
History, as it results from those Faffs,
which are related by the Persian and
Arabian Historians, as well as by the Gre
cian.
Cyrus may have married Cassandana at
1 8 Tears of Age, and have lived with her
nine or ten Iears j so that he may have tra
velled into Egypr, about the 29th Tear of
his Age. Tour Chronology agrees exaiJfy
with the Age of Amasis. All Chronologists
agree, that his Reign ended a Tear before
Cambyscs'j Expedition, that is about the
SiSth Tear before Christ, and the 63 ^Olym
piad. Herodotus makes bis Reign to have
lasted

quent il le fait commencer en Tannée 569
avant Jesus Christ & à la 52 Olympiade,
vers la 30e année de Cyrus.
Diodore qui donne 5 5 ans de Regne à
Amasis suppose qu'il monta sur le Throne
l'an 579 ou 580 avant l'Ere Chretienne,
& la 20 année de l'Age de Cyrus : Mais
ces deux Opinions font faciles à concilier.
Herodote a commencé le Regne d'Amafrs
à la fin de la Revolution qui le mit fur le
Throne, & Diodore a compté du Commen
cement de fa Revolte.
Apries vivoit encore peu après la prise
de Jerusalem puisque le Prophete Jeremie (*)
predit sa mort sous le nom de Pharaon Ho-
phra, comme un evenement qui devoit arri
ver dans' peu de Temps. Cette année est la
589 avant J. C. & la 36" avant la fin d'Ama
fis, & montre que les Divisions de l'Egypte
avoient deja commencé. Dans votre Sy
steme Amasis etoit maître tranquille de tou
te l'Egypte lors que Cyrus y passa, & il y
avoit deja plusieurs années qu'Apries etoit
mort. Ce qui est conforme à l'Histoire pro
fane & sacrée j Cyrus ayant 28 à 30 ans
lors de ses Voyages.
La Chronologie Grecque souffrira un
peu plus de difficulté, mais l'anachronisme
ne passera pas 12 ou 14 ans.

lasted 4-4 Tears ; and consequently places the
beginning of it in the 569th Tear before
Christ, and the 5 zd Olympiad, and about
the 10th Tear of Cyrus.
Diodorus indeed, who makes Amasis to
have reigned 5 5 Tears, supposes that he as
cended the Throne in the 579th, or $&oth
Tear before Christ, and the 20th Tear
of Cyrus'* Age : But these two Opinions
are easily reconciled. Herodotus begins A-
masis'j Reign at the end of the Revolution,
which placed him on the Throne, and Di
odorus at the beginning of his Revolt.
Apries must havelived but a little time af
ter the taking of Jerusalem since the 'Pro
phet Jeremiah, (7) foretells his 'Death, un
der the Names of Pharaoh Hophra, as what
must soon happen. Jerusalem was taken in
the Tear 589 before Christ, and the 6 idbe
fore Amasis'x Death, which shews that the
Troubles in Egypt were already begun. Ac
cording to your System, Amafis governed all
Egypt, in Tranquillity, when Cyrus went
thither ; and Apries had already been dead
several Tears; which is agreeable both to
prophane and sacred History. Cyrus being
between 28 and 30 Tears of Age when he
Travelled.
The Greek Chronology indeed will not be
so easily reconciled to yours but the A-

Chilo was, according to Hermippus, as
quotedby (s) Diogenes Laertius, advanced in
Age, at the time of the 5 id Olympiad.
This Olympiad began in the 573d Tear be
fore Christ, and ended in the 570th, which
was the 30th of Cyrus. This was before
his Ephorate, which Pamphyla places in the
56th Olympiad, but this 'Passage is mani

of the Chronology of the Olympiads, fixes
the time of the Magistracy ofChilo, to that
ofthe Archonship 0/'Euthydemes,<tf Athens ;
that is, to the 8 xstTear before Xerxes'j Pas

ofthe (5) Arundelian Marbles. This was the
561ft Tear before Christ, and the nth of
Cyrus, which agrees perfectly well with
your Chronology ; for Cyrus might haveseen

'fieath, the Anachronism is a Beauty, and
is, otherwise, of little Importance.
Pisistratus* Reign over the Athenians
did not begin, till 5 60 Tears before Christ,
71 before the Battle of Marathon, according
to Thucydides, and 100 before the
Tyranny of the 400, at Athens. Cyrus
was then 40 Tears old; so that your Ana
chronism here is only of 9, or 10 Tears.
Jlnd with regard to Solon, you are guilty
of no Anachronism at all. His Archonfhip
and his Reformations the Government of
Athens, was in the Tear 597 before Christ,
and the id Tear of (l2) the \6th Olympi
ad. He spent a considerable Time in tra
velling, and did not return to Athens, till
he was advanced in Tears ; which would
not suffer him to be concerned in publick
Affairs any more. He died at the Age of
to Tears, in the second Tear of Pisistra-

and in the \\st Tear of Cyrus : Who might
therefore have conversed with him, nine or
ten Tears before.

Y first Design was to in

often from the principal Story , I
thought it would be more agreeable
to the Reader to digest them into the
Form of a Discourse , which I divide
into two Parts.
In the firjl I shall shew, that the
Philosophers of all Ages and all
Countries have had a Notion of
a SUPREME DEITY distinB
and different from Matter.
From the second it will appear,
that there are Traces of the princi
pal Doctrines of revealed Religion
with regard to the three States of Na
ture to be found in the Mythology
of all Nations.

PART I.
Of the Theology of the
ANTIENTS.
O begin with the Magi or
Persian Philosophers : Ac
cording to the Testimony of
Herodotus* , the antient Persians
had neither Statues, nor Temples,
nor Altars : 4 They think it ridicu-
c lous, ( says this Author, ) to fancy,
c like the Greeks, that the Gods have
* an human Shape, or derive their
4 Original from Men. They chuse

os their Sacrifice : They use nei
ther Libations, nor Mustek, nor
hallow'd Breads but when any
one has a mind to sacrifice, he leads
the Victim into a clean Place, and
wearing a Wreath of Myrtle about
his Head, invokes the God to
whom he intends to offer it. The
4 Priest is not allow'd to pray for his
* own private Good, but for that of
4 the Nation in general, each parti-
4 cular Member finding his Benefit in
' the Prosperity of the Whole.
Strabo * gives the same Account
of the antient Persians. ' They
' neither erected Statues nor Altars,
says this Historian -t 4 they sacrificed
' in a clean Place, and upon an Emi-
* nence, where they offered up a
* Victim crowned. When the Priest
* had cut it into small Pieces, every
£ one took his share. They left no

of the ANTIENTS.
c Portion of it for the Deities, say-
' ing, that God desires nothing but
£ the Soul of the Victim.'
The Eastern People, full of the
Notion of Transmigration, imagined,
that the Victim was animated by a
Soul in a State of Punishment, whose
expiatory Pains were compleated by
the Sacrifice.
The Persians indeed, as well as
other Pagans, worshipped the Fire,
the Sun, and the Stars : But we shall
see that they consider'd them only as
visible Images and Symbols of a su
preme God, whom they believed to
be the Sovereign Lord of Nature.
-
Plutarch has left us in his Trea
tise of Ifis and Osiris, a Fragment of
the Theology of the Magt. This
philosophical Historian assures us,
that they called the Great God, Oro*
mazes, or the Principle of Light
R 3 that
6 Os the Theology
that produced every things and work -
eth all in all*. They admitted
however another God, but of an in
ferior Nature and Order, whom they
called Mythras or the Middle God.
They did not think him a Being co-
eternal with the supreme Divinity,
but the first Production of his Pow
er, the chief of all Spirits , and pla
ced by him in Authority over them.
This will appear from the following
Passages.
The finest Definition we have of
the Deity among all the Writings of
the Antients, is that of Zoroajier. It
has been transmitted down to us by
Rusebius in his Præparatio Evange-
lica .: an Author so far from being
over favourable to the Pagans, that
he makes it his Business continually
to expose and degrade their Philoso
phy. And yet he says, that he had
read the following Words verbatim
* Plut.delsid. & Osir. Edit. Paris, 1624. p. 37c.
in
of the ANTIENTS. 7
in a Book of Zoroafier that was ex
tant in his Time, and known by the
Title of The Sacred Collet!ton of
Persian Monuments.
f ' God is the first of all incor-
' ruptible Beings, eternal and unbe-
i gotten : He is not compounded of
* Parts. There is none like nor e-
' qual to him. He is the Author of
' all good, and entirely disinterested,

' Self-instructed, Self-sufficient, and

Arabians and Persians, who have

R 4 of

of Fire, maintain, that the first Magi
admitted only one eternal Principle
os all things.
Abuljeda, cited by the famous
Dr. Pocock, says, that according to
the primitive Doctrine of the Per
sians* , ' God was prior to both
4 Light and Darkness, and had ex-
6 ist.d from all Eternity in an ado-
* rable Solitude, without any Com-
' panion or Rival/
Sarifihani, quoted by Dr. Hyde,
says, ' That the first Magi \ did
* not look upon the good and evil
* Principles as both of them co-eter-
* nal, but thought that the Light
* was indeed eternal, and that the
' Darkness was produced in time by

Such
os the ANTIENTS. 9
Such was the Theology of the an-
tient Persians, which in the foregoing
Work I have put in the Mouth of
Zoroaster.
M. Bayle says in his Dictionary,
that the antient Persians were all Ma-
nichæans 3 however he came to en
tertain this 'Notion, he must cer
tainly have given it up, if he had
consulted the original Authors : a
Method which that famous Critick
did not always take. He had a Ge
nius capable of going to the bottom
of any Subject whatever : but he
wrote sometimes in a hurry, and
treated superficially the gravest and
most important Subjects. Besides,
there is no clearing him from the
Charge of loving too much the dis
mal Obscurity of Scepticism. He is
always upon his guard against the
pleasing Ideas of Immortality. He
sliews with Art and Subtlety all the
dark
io Os the Theology
dark Sides of a Question: but he
very rarely represents it in that Point
of Light, which shines with Evidence.
What Encomiums would he not have
merited, had he employed his admi
rable Talents more for the Benefit
of Mankind?
The Egyptians had much the same
Principles as the oriental Nations.
• There is nothing more absurd than
the Norion generally given us of
their Theology 5 nor is any thing
more extravagant than the allegorical
Sense which certain Authors fancy
they have discovered in their Hiero-
glyphicks.
On one hand, it is hard to believe
that human Nature could ever sink
so low as to adore Insects, Reptiles,
and Plants, which they fee produced,
growing, and dying every day, with
out ascribing certain divine Virtues
to them, or considering them as Sym
bols
os the ANTIENTS. n
bols of some invisible Power. In
the most barbarous Countries we still
find some Knowledge of a superior
Being, which is the Object of the
Hope and Fear of the most stupid
Savages. But though we should sup
pose there are some Nations in the
World sunk into so gross an Igno
rance as to have no Notion of a De
ity, yet it is' certain that Egypt can
not be charged with this Ignorance.
All Historians, as. well sacred as pro
fane, agree in speaking of this Peo
ple as the wisest of all Nations 5 and
one of the Encomiums that the Holy
Spirit gives to Moses, is, that he
was learned in all the Wisdom os
the Egyptians. Would the Holy
Ghost ever have spoken in such a
manner of a Nation that was fallen
into so senseless and barbarous an
Ignorance, as to worship Onions,
Crocodiles, and the most despicable
Reptiles ?
On
iz . Os the Theology
On the other hand, there are cer
tain modern Writers who exalt the
Theology of the Egyptians too high,
and fancy that they find in their
Hieroglyphicks all the Mysteries of
the Christian Religion. After the
Deluge, Noah doubtless would not
leave his Children ignorant of the
great Principles of Religion, with re
gard to the three States of Mankind:
and that Tradition might have been
spread from Generation to Genera
tion over all Nations of the World.
But we mould not infer from thence,
that the Heathens had as clear No
tions of the Divine Nature and the
Mejfias, as the Jews had themselves.
Such a Supposition, far from doing
Honour to Holy Writ, would only
derogate from its Dignity. I shall
endeavour to keep the just Medium
between these two Extremes.

Plutarch
os the ANTIENTS. 13
Plutarch in his Treatise of Isis and
OJtris, tells us*, ' That the Theo-
* logy of the Egyptians had two
4 Meanings 5 the one holy and fym-
* bolical, the other vulgar and lite*
1 ral 5 and consequently that the Fi-
4 gures of Animals which they had
' in their Temples, and which they
4 seemed to adore, were only so ma-
' ny Hieroglyphicks to represent the
' Divine Attributes.'
Pursuant to this Distinction, he
says, that Osiris signifies the active
Principle, or the most holy Beings 5
I/is the Wisdom or Rule of his Ope
ration, Orus the first Production of
his Power, the Model or Plan by
which he produced every thing, or
the Archetype of the World.
It would be rash to assert, that

the
14 Of the Theology
the Pagans ever had any Knowledge
of a Trinity of distinct Persons in
the indivisible Unity of the Divine
Nature. But it is plain that the
Chaldeans and Egyptians believed
that all the Attributes of the Deity
might be reduced to three, Power,
Understanding, and Love. They dis
tinguished alio three sorts of Worlds,
the sensible World, the aerial World,
and the etherial World. In each of
these Worlds they asserted likewise
three principal Properties , Figure,
Lights and Motion: Matter, Lorm,
and ABivity : and on this account
the antient Philosophers looked upon
the Number three as mysterious.
if any Man reads with attention
the aforementioned Tract of Plu
tarch, the Works of Jamblichus, and
what Accounts are left of the Reli
gion of the Orientals and Egyptians,

of the ANTIENTS.
he will easily see, that the Mythology
of those Nations chiefly regards the
internal Operations, and the Attri
butes of the Deity, as that of the
Greek does his external Operations,
or the Properties of Nature. The
Orientals and Egyptians had a more
refining and metaphysical Genius
than the Greeks and Romans, who
were fondest of the Sciences that
depend on Imagination and Sense.
This Key may contribute a great deal
towards understanding the antient
Mythologies.
Plutarch concludes his Treatise of
I/is and Osiris in this manner: * 4 As
4 he that reads the Works of Plato
' may be said to read Plato, and he

4 may be said to act Menander: so

Os the Theology
of the Deity. (Plutarch had said
a little before,) that care should be
taken not to transform, dissolve
and scatter the Divine Nature into
Rivers, Winds, Vegetables, or
bodily Forms and Motions. This
would be as ridiculous as to ima
gine, that the Sails, the Cables,
the Rigging and the Anchor are the
Pilot 3 or that the Thread, the
Woof, and the Shittle are the Wea
ver. Such senseless Notions are an
Indignity to the Heavenly Powers,
whom they blaspheme whilst they
give the Name of Gods to Beings
of an insensible, inanimate, and
corruptible Nature. Nothing, as
he goes on, that is without a Soul,
nothing that is material and to be
perceived by our Senses, can be
God. Nor yet must we imagine
that there are different Gods ac
cording to the different Countries
of Greeks and Barbarians, Nor
thern and Southern People. As

4 the Sun is common to all the World,
' tho' called by different Names in
' different Places ; so there is but
4 one sole supreme Mind or Reason,
* and one and the same Providence
* that governs the World, tho' he is

* and has appointed some inferior
* Powers for his Ministers/ Such,
according to Plutarch, was the Doc
trine of the first Egyptians with re
gard to the Divine Nature.
Origen, wn0 was co-temporary
with Plutarch, follows the same Prin
ciples in his Book against Celsus , a
Pagan Philosopher, who pretended to
understand Christianity, because he
knew some Ceremonies of that Reli
gion, tho' he never entered into the
Spirit of it. Now Origen expresses
himself in this manner : * ' The
' Egyptian Philosophers have sublime
* Orig. contra Cels. lib. i. p. n.
S 4 No
1 8 Of the Theology
Notions with regard to the Divine
Nature, which they keep secret, and
never discover to the People but
under a Veil of Fables and Allego
ries. Celfus is like a Man who has
travelled into that Country j and
tho' he has conversed with none
but the ignorant Vulgar, yet
takes it into his Head, that he
understands the Egyptian Religion.
All the Eastern Nations, (continues
he) the Persians, the Indians, the
Syrians conceal secret Mysteries
under their religious Fables. The
wisse Men of all those Religions see
into the Sense and true Meaning of
them, whilst the Vulgar go no fur
ther than the exterior Symbol, and
see only the Bark that covers
them.'
Let us next hear the Testimony of
Jamblichus, who had studied the Re
ligion of the Egyptians, and under
stood it thoroughly. He lived in
the

the beginning of the third Century,
and was a Disciple of the famous
Porphyry, As both St. Clement *
and St. Cyril of Alexandria f assure
us, there were at that time a great
many Egyptian Books extant, which
have been since lost : Several of these
were highly respected for their Anti
quity, and ascribed to Hermes Trif-
megistus, or one of his first Disciples.
Jamblichus had read theseBooks,which
had been translated by the Greeks j
and this is the Account that he gives
of the Theology which they taught.
4 According to the Egyptians, the
' first God existed in his solitary Uni-
' ty before all Beings^. He is the
' Fountain and Original of every thing

4 that this second God, whom he

self all spiritual Beings. He makes
' nothing superior to this God- Guide,

' r'ts, as he is the Author of all
* Good/
Such, according to Jamhlichus,
was the Doctrine of the Egyptians 3
and it is evident from thence, that
they admitted only one Principle,
and a middle God, like the Mytbras
of the Persians.
The Notion of a Spirit constitu
ted by the supreme God, to be the
Head and Guide of all Spirits, is very
anticnt. The Hebrew Doctors be
lieved that the Soul of the Messias
was created from the Beginning of
the World , and appointed to preside
over all the Orders of Intelligences.
This Opinion was founded on a No
tion , that finite Natures cannot
incessantly contemplate the Bright
ness and Glories of the Divine Es
sence, and must necessarily some
times turn off their View, and adore
the Creator in his Works , that ac
S 3 such
Of the Theology •
such Times there must be an Head
to lead Spirits thro' all the Regions
of Immensity, and shew them ail its
Beauties and Wonders.
To have a more perfect: Know
ledge of the Theology of the Orien
tals and Egyptians, it, may not be
improper to examine that of the
Greeks and Romansy which is derived
originally from it. The Philoso
phers of Greece went to study Wis
dom in Asia and Egypt* Thales^
Pythagoras, Plato, drew the best of
their Knowledge from thence. The
Traces of the Oriental Tradition are
now indeed in a manner worn out ,
but as there are leveral Monuments
of the Theology of the Greeks still
preserved, we may judge of the Mas
ters by their Disciples.
We must however distinguish be
tween the Gods of the Poets, and
those of the Philosophers. Poetry
deifies
us the ANTIENTS.
deifies all the various Parts of Na
ture, and gives Spirit to Bodies, as
well as Body to Spirits : It expresses
the Operations and Properties of
Matter by the Actions and Passions
of such invisible Powers, as the Pa
gans supposed to be Directors of
all the Motions and Events that we
fee in the Universe. The Poets pals
in a Moment from Allegory to the
literal Sense, and from the literal
Sense to Allegory - from real Gods
to fabulous Deities : and this occa
sions that Jumble of their Images,
that Absurdity in their Fictions, and
that Indecorum in their Expressions,
which are so justly condemned by
the Philosophers.
Notwithstanding this Multiplica
tion of inferior Deities, these Poets
however acknowledged , that there
was but one only supreme God. This
will appear from the very antient
Traditions which we still have left
S 4 , of
Of the Theology
of the Philosophy of Orpheus. I am
very far from thinking that Orpheus
was the Author of those Works which
go under his "Name. I believe with
the famous Grottus, that those Books
were wrote by the Pythagoreans, who
professed themselves Diiciples of Or
pheus. But whoever is the Author
of these Writings , 'tis certain that
they are older than Hercdotus and
Plato, and were in great Esteem a-
mong the Heathens -} so that by the
Fragments of them still preserved,
we may form a Judgment of the
antient Theology os the Greeks.
I shall begin with the Abridgment
which Timotheus the Cosmographer
gives us of the Doctrine of Orpheus.
This Abridgment is preserved in
Sutdas *.
f There is one unknown Being
• Suidas de Orph. p. 3p.
* exalted
os the ANTIENTS.
' exalted above and prior to all Be-
e ings, the Author of all Things,
c even of the Æther, and of every
c thing that is below the Æther:
c This exalted Being is Life, Light,
4 and Wisdom 5 which three Names
c express only one and the same
' Power, which has created all Be-
c ings, visible and invisible, out of
' nothing.'
It appears by this Passage, that the
Doctrine of the Creation, that is , of
the Production of Substances , was
not unknown to the Heathen Philo*
fophers. We mail soon find it laid
down in Plato,
Proclm has transmitted down to
us this extraordinary Passage of the
Theology of Orpheus *. c The
4 Universe was produced by Jupiter,
c the Empyrœum, the deep Tartarus,

' Jupiter. Jupiter is the First and
* the Last, the Beginning and the
* End. All Beings derive their Ori-
4 gin from him. He is the Primi-
4 tive Father, and the Immortal Vir-
4 gin. He is the Life , the Cause,
4 and the Energy of all Things.
4 There is but one only Power, one
4 only God, and one sole universal
4 King of all.'
I shall conclude the Theology of
Orpheus with a famous Passage of
the Author of the Argonautica, who
is looked upon to be a Disciple of
his *. 4 We will sing first an Hymn
4 upon the antient Chaos, how the
4 Heavens, the Sea, and the Earth

were

c were formed out of it. We will
c sing likewise that Eternal, Wise,
' and Self-perfect: Love, which re-
c duced this Chaos into Order *.
. 'Tis clear enough from the Doc
trine of the Theogony, or Birth of
the Gods, which is the same as the
Cosmogony, or Generation os the
Universe, that the antient Poets as
cribed it entirely to a First Being,
from whom all other Beings derived
theirs. The Poem of the Theogonia,
which is ascribed to Hefiod speaks
of Love £ as the first Principle which
4 brought the Chaos into Order 3
and from that Chaos sprung the
Night, from the Night the Æther,
from the Æther the Light 5 then the
Stars, the Planets, the Earth, and at
last the Deities that govern all.

Words which shew plainly that the

Tradition makes a Distinction be

his Wisdom brought it out of Con
fusion into Order.

observe, that the Greek and Roman

is much more imperfect than that of

tell us, that there was an happy and
perfect State of the World prior to
the Chaos j that the good Principle
could never produce any thing that
was evil 5 that his first Work could
not be Confusion and Disorder 3 and
in a word, that physical Evil is no
thing else but a Consequence of mo
ral Evil. 'Twas the Imagination of
the Greek Poets that first brought
forth the monstrous Manichæan Doc
trine about two co-eternal Principles,
a supreme Intelligence and a blind
Matter, Light and Darkness, an in
digested Chaos, and a Deity to range
it in Order.
I pass from Hefiod and Ovid to
speak of the Theology of Homer
and his Imitator Virgil. Let any
one read these two Epick Poets with
a proper Attention , and he will fee
that the Marvellous which runs
thro' their Fable is sounded upon
these three Principles. 1. That there
is

is one supreme God, whom they eve
ry where call the Father, and the
Sovereign Lord of Men and Gods,
the Architect of the World, the
Prince and Governour of the Uni
verse, the First God, and the Great
God. 2. That universal Nature is
full of subordinate Spirits, which are
the Ministers of that supreme God.
3. That Good and Evil, Virtue and
Vice, Knowledge and Error, arise
from the different Influence and In
spiration of the good and evil Genii,
who dwell in the Air, the Sea, the
Earth, and the Heavens.
The Tragick and Lyrick Poets
express themselves after the same
manner as the Epick Poets. Euripi-
des expressly acknowledges the De
pendence of all Beings upon one sole
Principle : 4 O Father , and King

Sophocles represents the Deity to
us as a sovereign Intelligence, which
is the Truth, the Wisdom, and the
Eternal Law of all Spirits f. 'Tis
not, says he, to any mortal Nature,
that Laws owe their Origin. They
come from above. They come down
from Heaven itself. The Olympian
Jupiter alone is the Father of them.
Pindar says t, that Chiron taught
Achilles to adore Jove, who lances

that he required of his Disciples.
He was very sensible that human Un

to the Knowledge os Divine Things,
unless the Heart was purged of its
Passions. Now these are the No

Thus he represents to us the Di
vine Immensity as filled with Spirits
of different Orders \. Thales had
the same Notion 3, a Notion which
those two Philosophers had learned
in Egypt, where they thought it was
to stint the Divine Power to suppose
it less productive in intelligent Be
ings, than in material Ones.
This is the true Sense of that far
mous Expression ascribed to the Py*
thagoreans, that Unity was the Prinr
ciple of all things, and that from this
Unity there sprung an infinite Dut
ality. We are not by this Duality
to understand two Persons of the
Christian Trinity, nor the two Prin-s
ciples of the Manichees ; but a World

stances, which is the Effect whereof
Unity is the Cause*. This is the
Sentiment of Porphyry, and it ought
to be preferred before that of Plu
tarch, who is for ascribing the Ma-
nichean System to Pythagoras, with
out producing for it any Proof.
Pythagoras agreed with Thales in
defining the Soul to be a Self-moving
Principle f. He maintained further,
c that when it quits the Body, it is
* re- united to the Soul ofthe Worlds j
c That it is not a God, but the
c Work of an Eternal God**, and
c that it is immortal on account of

This Philosopher was of opinion,
that Man was composed of three
Parts, of a pure Spirit, of an ethe
real Matter, (which he called the

The Pythagoreans speaking of the
subtile Vehicle or the celestial Body,
frequently call it the Soul; because
they consider it as the active Power
which animates the terrestrial Body .
This has made such as do not under
stand their Philosophy thoroughly,
imagine, that they believed the think
ing Substance to be material 5 whereas
nothing is more false. They always
distinguished between the Under
standing or the pure Spirit, and the
animal Soul or ethereal Body. They
considered the one as the Source

of our Thoughts, the other as the
Cause of our Motions. They be
lieved them to be two different Sub
stances. AnaxagoraS, as we shall
soon see, rectified this Mistake,
The old Greek Poets had dressed
up this Opinion in a different Guise;
they called the ethereal Body the
Representation, the Image, or the
Shadow because they fancy'd that
this subtile Body, when it came down
from Heaven to animate the ter
restrial Body, assumed its Form just
as melted Metal takes that of the
Mold in which it is cast. They said,
that after Death, the Spirit still clothed
with this subtile Vehicle, flew up to-
the Regions of the Moon, where
they placed the Ehfian Fields. And
there, as they imagined, a sort of
second Death ensued by the Separa
tion of the pure Spirit from its Ve
hicle. The one was united to the
Gods, the other staid in the Abode
Of the The ology
of the Shades. This is the Reason
why Ulyjses says in the Odyffeis,
' That he saw in the Elyfian Fields
' the Divine Hercules 5 /. e. his
4 Image, says the Poet 3 for as for
* him, he is with the Immortal Gods,
~ and assists at their Banquets*.
Pythagoras did not adopt the Po-
etick Fiction of a second Death. He
held, that the pure Spirit, and its
subtile Vehicle being born together,
were inseparable, and returned after
Death to the Star from whence they
descended.
I do not speak here of Transmi
gration, which only related to such
Souls as were degraded and corrupt
ed in mortal Bodies. I shall treat
of it in the second Part of this Dis"
course.

I cannot conclude this Article of
Pythagoras better than with the Sumr
mary which St. Cyril gives us of the

After Pythagoras comes Anaxago-
ras ^ of the Ionick Sect, born at
Clazomenœ, and Master to Pericles
the Athenian Hero. This Philoso
pher was the first after Thales in the

Universe. He rejected with Con
tempt, and with great Strength of
Reason refuted the Doctrine of such
as held, that * a blind Necessity,
and the casual Motions of Matter had
produced the World. He endea
voured to prove, that a pure and
uncompounded Spirit presides over
the Universe.
According to Aristotle % Account,
the Reasoning of Anaxaqpras was
founded upon these two Principles:
4 i. That the Idea of Matter not in-
4 eluding that of active Force, Mo-
4 tion could not be one of its Pro-
' perties. We must therefore, said
' he, seek somewhere else to find
* out the Cause of its Activity. Now
*. this Active Principle, as it was the
* Cause of Motion', he called the Soul,
I because it animates the Universes.

c any reserftblance to this Property;
* and from thence he inferred, that
4 there was in Nature another Sub-

4 ded, that the Soul and Spirit were

' tinguiflied by us only in regard of
* its different Operations, and that
4 of all Essences, it was the most
* simple, the most pure, and the
* most exempt from all Mixture and
4 Composition.'
This Philosopher pasted at Athens
for an Atheist, because he denied
that the Stars and Planets were Gods %.
He maintained, that the first were

So very antient is the System of a
Plurality of Worlds, which has been
generally thought to be modern.;
Plato * accuses Anaxagoras of
saving explained all the Phenomena
of Nature by Matter and Motion.
Descartes has only revived this Opi
nion. I cannot but think it Very un
just to attack the Philosopher of Cla-
zomenœ or his Follower on this ac
count, since they both lay it down
for a Principle, that Motion is not a
Property of Matter, and that the
Laws of Motion are settled with
Thought and Design. Supposing
these two Principles, he gives -us a no
bler Idea, and one every way more
worthy of the Deity, who maintains,
that God being always himself present
to his Work, gives Life, Being, and
Motion to all Creatures, than he who

imagines with the Per'tpatetkks, that
certain inferior Spirits, substantial
Forms, or middle Beings, which
they cannot define, produce all the
various Modifications and Arrange
ments of Matter. Aristotle and his
School, by multiplying second Causes,
seem to have robbed the first Cause
in some measure of his Power and
Glory.
Socrates * follows close after A"
naxagoras. The common Notion
is, that he was a Martyr for the Uni
ty of the Godhead, in having refused
to pay his Homage to the Gods of
Greece-, but it is a Mistake. In the
Apology that Plato makes for this
Philosopher, Socrates acknowledgeth
certain iubordinatc Deities, and teach
es that the Stars and the Sun are ani
mated by Intelligences that ought to
be worshipped with Divine Honours.
* Flor. Olymp. 90.
i The
48 Of ^'Theology
The same Plato in his Dialogue upon
Holiness * tells us, that Socrates was
not punished for denying that there
were inferior Gods, but for declaim
ing openly against the Poets who
ascribed human Passions and enor
mous Crimes to those Deities*
Socrates however, whilst he sup
posed several inferior Gods, admitted
all the while but only one Eternal
Principle. Xenophon has left us an
excellent Abridgment of the Theo
logy of that Philosopher. 'Tis per
haps the most important Piece we
have left of Antiquity. It contains
the Conversation of Socrates with
Ariflodemw, who doubted of the
Existence of God. Socrates makes
him at first take notice of all the Cha

Wisdom that appear all over the
Universe , and particularly in the

4 might as well conclude, that you
' do nothing your self with Design

8 thing is done by blind Chance in

Ariftodemus at length acknowledg
ing a supreme Being, is still in doubt
as to Providence $ not being able to
comprehend how the Deity can fee
every thing at once. Socrates re
plies, 4 If the Spirit that resides in
' your Body moves and disposes it
' at its pleasure j why sliould not
c that sovereign Wisdom which pre-
c sides over the Universe, be able
£ likewise to regulate and order every

c Skily j why should not the Divine
4 Mind be able to take care of every
' thing, being every where present

Socrates perceiving at last that the
infidelity of Ariftodernus did not arise
so much from his Reason as from his
Heart, concludes with these Words:
* O Ariftomedus, apply yourself sin-
' cerely to worship God he will
c enlighten you, and all your Doubts
4 will soon be removed !'
Plato a Disciple of Socrates^
follows the same Principles. He
lived at a time when the Doctrine of
Democritus had made a great Pro
gress at Athens. The Design of all
his Theology is to give us noble Sen
timents of the Deity, to sliew us
that Souls were condemned to ani
mate mortal Bodies, only in order
* Qlym. ioo;
u *
Os the The6logy
to expiate Faults they had committed
in a pre- existent State -, and in fine,
to teach that Religion is the only
Way to restore us to our first Glory
and Perfection. He despises all the
Tenets of the Athenian Superstition,
and endeavours to purge Religion of
them. The chief Object of this Phi
losopher is Man in his immortal
Capacity, he only speaks of him in
his politick one', to mew that the
shortest Way to Immortality, is to
discharge all the Duties of Civil So
ciety for the Love of Virtue.

Speaking indeed of the Divine Sub
stance in his Timam Locriust he calls
it an uncreated Matter f. But he
distinguishes it always from the sen
sible Universe, which he considers
merely as an Effect and a Produc

Nor is it surprising that Plato^
who had only the Light of Nature
to instruct him, should be convinced
of the Creation. That Truth, how
ever incomprehensible it may appear
to finite Minds, does yet imply no
Contradiction. In reality, when God
creates, he does not draw a Being

necessarily supposes that, of being a-

well as new Forms. To make a
Substance exist which did not exist

Cicero lived in an Age when Cor
ruption of Manners and Scepticism
were at their Height. The Sect of
Epicurus had got the Ascendant at
Rome over that of Pythagoras ; and
some of the greatest Men when they
were reasoning about the Divine Na
ture, thought fit to suspend their Judg
ment and waver between the two O-
pinions of a supreme Intelligence and
a blind Matter. Cicero, in his Trea
tise os the Nature of the Gods, pleads
the Cause of the Academick Philo
sophers who doubted of every thing.
It is however to be observed, that
he refutes Epicurus with great Force
of Reason in his first Book, and that
the Objections which he makes in
his third, as an Academick, are much
weaker than the Proofs that he draws
from the Wonders that appeat in
Nature, which he insists on in his
Si Os the f HfcbtoSy

istence of a supreme Intelligence.

Such were the Reasonings of Ci

and was not carried away by a Fond

Doctrine of the Sceptkks.

To come at last to Seneca the
Stoick. He was Nero's Tutor, and
lived in an Age when Christianity-
was not in Credit enough to engage
the Heathens to borrow any philoso
phical Principles from thence.
£ * 'Tis of very little Confe-
c cjuence, says he, by what Name

f He is called Jupiter Stator, not as
* Historians say, because he stopped
c the Roman Armies as they were
£ flying, but because he is the con-
* stant support of all Beings. They
f may call him Fate, because he is
* the first Cause on which all others
' depend. We Stoicks call him some-
' times Father Bacchus, because he

There is no reading the Works of
Epiffietus, of Arrtan his Disciple, and
or Marcus Antoninus without Admi
ration. We find in them Rules of
Morality worthy of Christianity 5 and
yet those Disciples of Z,eno believed
like their Master, that there was but
one Substance, that the supreme in
telligent Being was material, and that
its Esience was a pure Æther which
filled all by local Diffusion. The
Error of these Materialists docs not
in any wisse prove them'to be Atheists ;
a false Notion about the Deity being
far from proving that they believed
none at all. What constitutes an A-

of the Church thought of it, They
had sufficient Opportunities of know
ing it throughly, by the frequent
Disputes which they held with them.
And as this is a Matter of a very
nice Nature, I will not indulge any
thing to my own Conjectures, but
will cite their own Words,
Armbim introduces the Heathens
complaining of the Injustice of the
Christians. ' * Tis a mere Calum-
* ny, say those Heathens, to charge
c us with such a Crime, as the de-
* nying of a supreme God. We call

4 * St. Paul in his preaching at
Athens, says St. Clement of Alex

had a Knowledge of the Deity.
He supposes that those People adore
the fame God as we do, though
not in the same manner. He docs
not forbid us to adore the same
God as the Greeks, but he forbids
us to adore him after the same
way. He orders us to change the
Manner, and not the Object of our
Worship.'
* t The Heathens , says LaBan-
tius) who admit several Gods, say
nevertheless that those subordinate
Deities, though they preside over
all the various Parts of the Universe,

Euseb'ius of Cesarea goes further.

4 poreal and invisible manner, they are
4 therefore in the right to worship him
4 in his visible and corporeal Effects.'
I shall conclude with a famous
Passage of St. Augitfl'ine, who re
duces the Polytheism of the Hea
thens to the Unity of one sole Prin
ciple. 4 f Jup'tter, says this Father,

£ In the Æthercal Spaces he is called

' Sea Neptune, in the Earth Pluto,
' in Hell Proserpina, in the Ele-

' Gods and Goddesses are only the
' fame Jupiter, whose different Pow-

* different Names.'
It is therefore evident by the Te
stimony of profane Poets, Heathen
Philosophers, and Fathers of the
Church, that the Pagans acknow
ledged one supreme Deity. The
Eastern People, the Egyptians, the
Greeks,
[ j6 Os the Theology
Greeks, the Romans, and all Na
tions agreed universally in teaching
this Truth.
About the fifteenth Olympiad, six
hundred Years before the Christian
Æra, the Greeks having lost the tra
ditional Knowledge of the Orientals,
began to lay aside the Doctrine of
the Antients, and to reason about
the Divine Nature from Prejudices
which their Senses and Imagination
suggested. Anaximander lived at
that time, and was the first that set
himself to destroy the Belief of a su
preme Intelligence, in order to ac
count for every thing from the Ac
tion of blind Matter, which by ne
cessity assumes all Sorts of Forms.
He was followed by Leucippus, De-
mocritus, Epicurus, Strata, Lucretius,
and all the School of the Atomical
Philosophers.
Pythagoras, Anqxagoras, Soera-
les, Plato, Aristotle, and all the great
Men
os the ANTIENTS.
Men of Greece, opposed this impious
Doctrine, and endeavoured to prove
the antient Theology of the Orien
tals. These Philosophers of a su-
periour Genius observed in Nature,
Afotion, Thought and Design. And /
as the Idea of Matter includes none
of these three Properties, they in
ferred from thence, that there was
another Substance different from Mat
ter.
Greece being thus divided into
two Sects, they disputed for a long
time, without either Party being
convinced. . At length about the
i loth Olympiad Pyrrho formed a
third Sect whose great Principle was
to doubt of every thing, and deter
mine nothing. All the Atomists
who had laboured in vain to find out
a Demonstration of their false Prin
ciples, presently struck in with the
Pyrrhonian Sect. They ran wildly
into the System of an universal Doubt,
Of the Theology
and carried it almost to such an Ex
cess of Frenzy, that they doubted of
the clearest and most sensible Truths.
They maintained without any Alle
gory, that every thing we see is only
an Illusion, and that the whole Series
of Life is but a perpetual Dream of
which those of the Night are only so
many Images.
/ At last Zenofet up a fourth School
/about the 130th Olympiad. This
/ Philosopher endeavoured to reconcile
the Disciples of Democritus with
those of Plato, by maintaining that
the first Principle was indeed an infi
nite Wisdom., but his Essence was on
ly a pure Æther, or a subtile Light,
which diffus'd it self every where, to
give Life, Motion, and Reason to
all Beings.

In these last Ages the modern Free-*
thinkers have done nothing but re
vive the antient Errors. 'Jwdano

Bruno, Vanning and Spinoza, have
vamped up the monstrous System of
Anaximander 5 and the last of the
three has endeavoured to dazzle weak
Minds, by dressing it up in a geo
metrical Form.
Some Spinofifts finding that they
were every Moment at a Loss for
Evidence in the pretended Demon
strations of their Master, are fallen
into a senseless sort of Scepticism,
called Rgomifm, where every one
fancies himself to be the only Being
that exists.
Mr. Hobbes and several other Phi
losophers, without setting up for A-
theists, have ventured to maintain,
that Thought and Extension are Pro
perties of the same Substance.
Des Cartes, F, Malebranche, Leib
nitz, Dr. Bentley, Dr. Clarke , and

qually subtile and profound, have
endeavoured to refute these ErrorSj
and brought Arguments to support
the antient Theology. Besides the
Proofs which are drawn from the Ef
fects, they have insisted on others
drawn from the Idea of the first
Cause. They shew plainly that the
/ Reasons of believing, are infinitely
stronger than any Arguments there
are for doubting. This is all that
can be expected in metaphysical Dis
cussions.
The History of former Times is
like that of our own. Human Un

looked upon moral and phy

non in the Work of a Being infinite

account for it, the Philosophers have
had recourse to several Hypotheses.
Reason told them all, that what
is supremely good could never pro

miserable. From hence they conclu-

ded that Souls are not now what
they were at firsts that they are de
graded for some Fault committed by
them in a former State ,- that this Life
is a Place of Exile and Expiation j
and in a Word, that all Beings are to
be restored to their proper Order.
These philosophical Notions, how
ever, had another Original. Tra
dition struck in with Reason to gain
them a Reception, and that Tradi
tion had spread over all "Nations cer
tain Opinions which they held in
common, with regard to the three
States of the World, as I shall shew
in this second Part, which will be a
sort of Abridgment of the traditio
nal Doctrine of the Ancients.
I begin with the Mythology of
the Greeks and Romans. AU the

an happy State, where there were

neither Calamities, nor Crimes, nor

They represent to us on the con
trary, the Iron Age, as the time when
physical and moral Evil first appear
ed5 when Vices, Sufferings, and all
manner of Evils came forth of Pan
dora's fatal Box, and over-flowed
the Face of the Earth j[.
They speak to us of the Golden
Age revived, as of a time when As-
trœa was to return upon Earth5 when
Justice, Peace and Innocence were
to flourish again with their original
Lustre5 and when every thing was to
be restored to its primitive Perfec

I lay no great Stress upon those

may perhaps be looked upon as

of the ANTIENTS.
meer Fictions, and a Machinery intro
duced to embellish a Poem and a-
muse the Mind. Allegorical Ex
plications are liable to Uncertainty
and Mistake. So that I shall pass
directly to represent the Doctrine of
the Philosophers, particularly that of
Plato ,• who is the Source from whence
Plotinus, ProclitS, and the Platonijis
of the third Century drew their prin
cipal Notions.
To begin with the Dialogue of
Phtfdo, or of Immortality, and give
a short Analysis of it. Phædo gives
bis Friends an Account of the Con
dition that he saw Socrates in at the
time of his Death. £ He quitted Life,
(lays he) f with a peaceable Joy, and
4 a noble Intrepidity/ His Friends ask
ing him the Reason of it, 4 I hope,
(says Socrates in his Answer) ' to be
' re-united to the good and perfect
* Gods, and to be associated with
Y 3 i bette*
86 0/ Mythology
c better Men than those I leave upon
4 Earth.' *
When Cebes objects to him, that
the Soul vanislied after Death, like a
Smoke, and was entirely annihilated,
Socrates sets himself to refute that
Opinion, and endeavours to prove
that the Soul had a real Existence \
in an happy State, before it inform
ed an human Body.
This Doctrine he ascribes to Or
pheus \. ' The Disciples of Or-
f phens, (says he) called the Body a
c Prison, because the Soul is here in
c a State of Punishment till it has ex-
c piated the Faults that it committed
* in Heaven.
' Souls (continues Plato) that are
* too much given to bodily Pleasures,
5 and are in a manner besotted, wan-
* P. 48. j P. J7. j Plat. Cratyl. p. 276.

4 der upon the Earth, and are put
4 into new Bodies. * For all Sen-
4 suality and Passion bind the Soul
* more closely to Bodies, make
4 her fancy that she is of the same
4 Nature, and render her in a manner
* corporeal. So that she contracts
* an Incapacity of flying away into
4 another Life, and being oppresied
4 with the Weight of her Impurity
4 and Corruption, sinks deeper into
' Matter, and becomes thereby dis-
* abled to re-mount towards the Re-
4 gions of Purity, and attain to a
4 Re-union with her Principle.
Upon this Foundation is built the
Doctrine of the Transmigration of
Souls, which Plato represents in his
Timœus Locrus as an Allegory, and
at other times as a real State, where
Souls that have made themselves un
worthy of the supreme Beatitude*
* Pha?d. p. 6i, 62, 63.
Y 4 sojourn

sojourn and suffer successively in the
Bodies of different Animals, till they
are purged at last of their Crimes by
the, Pains they undergo. This hath
made some Philosophers believe that
the Souls of Beasts are degraded Spi
rits.
' Pure Souls, adds Plato, that
c have exerted themselves here be-
f low to get the better of all Cor-
4 ruption, and free themselves from
c the Impurities of their terrestrial
L Prison, retire after Death into an
' invisible Place, unknown to us,
f where the pure unites with the pure,
' the good cleaves to its like, and
* pur immortal Essence is united to
. the divine.
He calls this Place the first Earth,
where Souls made their Abode before
their Degradation. c The Earth,
says he, ' is immense,- we know and
* we inhabit only a small Comer of
3 ' it-
os the ANTIENTS.
it The ethereal Earth, the an-
tient Abode of Souls, is placed in
the pure Regions of Heaven, where
the fixed Stars are seated. We that
live in this low Abyss, are apt e-
nough to fancy that we are in an
high Place, and we call the Air
the Heavens ; just like a Man that
from the Bottom of the Sea should
view the Sun and Stars through
the Water, and fancy the Ocean
: to be the Firmament it self. But
' if we had Wings to mount on high,
; we ITiould see that there is the true
1 Heaven, the true Light, and the
4 true Earth. As in the Sea every
f thing is changed, and disfigured by
£ the Salts that abound in it j so in
* our present Earth every thing is de-
* formed, corrupted, and in a ruin-
* ous Condition, if compared with
i the primitive Earth.'

Plato gives afterwards a pompous
Description of that aethereal Earth, of
which ours is only a shattered Crusts-
He says, * that c every thing there
c was beautiful, harmonious and

4 was watered with Rivers of Nec-
' tar. They breathed there the Light
fc as here we breathe the Air, and
' they drank Waters that were purer
' than Air it self/

great Measure with that o$Des Car-

This same Doctrine of Plato is
likewise clearly explained in his Ti-

in his Travels discoursed with an E-

the World, its Origin, and the Re

according to the Mythology of the

Priest says to him, c O Solon, you

4 you never come to an Age of Ma-
4 turity : Your Understanding is

This Discourse puts Tzmœus upon

Such was the Doctrine which Plato
opposed to the profane Sect of De-
mocritus and Epicurus, who denied
an eternal Providence on Account of
the physical and moral Evil which
they saw in the World. This Phi
losopher gives us a fine Description
of the Universe. He considers it as
an Immensity filled with free Spirits,
which inhabit and inform innumerable
Worlds. These Spirits are qualified
to enjoy a double Felicity 3 the one
consisting in the Contemplation of
the Divine Essence, the other in ad
miring his Works. When Souls no
longer make their Felicity consist in the
Knowledge of Truth, and when lower
Pleasures turn them off from the
Z 1 Love
Of the Mythology
Love of the supreme Essence, they
are thrown down into some Planet,
there to undergo expiatory Punish
ments till they are cured by their
Sufferings. These Planets are conse
quently according to Plato s Notion,
like Hospitals or f Places instituted
for the Cure of distempered Intelli
gences. This is the inviolable Law
established * for the Preservation of
Order in the Celestial Spheres.
This double Employment of Ce
lestial Spirits, is one of the sublimest
Notions of Plato, and shews the
wonderful Depth of his Genius.
This was the System adopted by
the Heathen Philosophers, when
ever they attempted to explain to
us the Origin of Evil. And thus
they reason 5 if Souls could without
Inter-

V
Intermission contemplate the Divine
Eflence by a direct View, they would
be impeccable, the Sight of the su
preme Good necessarily engaging all
the Love of the Will. To explain
therefore the Fall of Spirits, they
were forced to suppose an Interval,
when the Soul withdraws from the
Divine Presence, and quits the su
pra-celestial Abode, in order to ad
mire the Beauties of Nature, and
entertain itself with Ambrosia, as a
Food less delicate, and more suitable
to a finite Being. 'Tis in these In
tervals that she becomes false to her
Duty.
Pythagoras had learned the same
Doctrine among the Egyptians. We
have still a very valuable Monument
of it left in the Commentary of Hie-
rocles upon the golden Verses ascrib
ed to that Philosopher. ' As our

thor, ' and the Loss of the Wings

' But the Judges of the Shades be-

5Tis therefore evidently the Doc
trine of the most famous Greek Phi-

Pre-existence in Heaven. 2.dly,
That the Jupiter who marched at
the Head of Souls before the Loss
of their Wings ; and he to whom
Saturn gave the Reins of his Em
pire after the Origin of Evil is a di
stinct Being from the supreme Essence,
and is very like the Mythras of the
Persians,and the Orus ofthe Egyptians.
3dly, That Souls lost their Wings,
and were thrust down into mortal
Bodies, because that instead of fol
lowing Jupiter's Chariot, they gave
themlelves too much up to the En
joyment of lower Pleasures. 4thly,
That at the end of a certain Period
of time, the Wings of the Soul shall
grow again, and Saturn shall resume
the Reins of his Empire in order to
restore the Universe to its original
Perfection.
Let us now examine the Egyptian
Mythology, the Source from whence
that
of the ANTIENTS. i
that of the Greeks was derived. I
(hall not offer to maintain the mysti
cal Explications that Kircher gives of
the famous Table of Ifis, or of the 0-
belisks that are to be seen at Rome :
I confine my self to Plutarch, who has
preserved us an admirable Monument
of that Mythology. To represent
it in its real Beauties, it will be pro
per to give a (hort and clear Analy
sis of his Treatise of I/is and Osiris,
which is a Letter written to Clea,
Priestess of Ifis.
* $ The Egyptian Mythology,
says Plutarch, 4 has two Senses, the
' one sacred and sublime, the other
' sensible and palpable. 'Tis for
< this Reason that the Egyptians put
4 Sphinxes before the Door of their
' Temples 5 designing thereby to sig-
c nify to us that their Theology con-
' tains the Secrets of Wisdom under c-
* njgmatical Words.' This is also the

' They were both born of Rhea and

4 but burst violently through the Ribs
4 of Rhea. He afterwards revolted

4 them about. Ever since that time

' eternal and immortal Soul of Oft-

4 below, where he gave him Instruc-
4 tions how to fight, and beat Ty-
4 phon. Orus returned upon Earth,
1 fought and defeated Typhon, but
' did not kill him. All that he did
' was to bind him, and take away
4 his Power of doing Mischief. The
4 wicked one made his Escape after-
4 wards, and was going to renew his
t Malice : But Orus fought him in
4 two bloody Battels, and destroyed
€ him entirely/
Plutarch goes on thus j * Who-
- ever applieth these Allegories to

c ture, deserves to be treated with
4 Contempt. We must not how-
' ever believe that they are mere
i Fables without any Meaning, like

Religion, and estrange Men from
the Deity/

much juster in their Notions, who
have wrote, that whatever is re

' Evil, because he is sovereignly
' good 5 Matter cannot be the Cause
4 of Evil , because it has no active
* Force. But Evil comes from a
* third Principle, neither so perfect

. I have already {hewn that the
Schools of Pythagoras and Plato as
serted Liberty of Will. The former
expresses k by the Nature of the
Soul, which can either raise or sink
itself j the other by the Wings of the
Soul, which may move different ways
and be parted. Plutarch follows
the same Principles , and makes Li
berty consist in the Activity of the

Soul, by which it is the Source of its
own Determinations.
This Opinion therefore ought not
to be looked upon as modern. It
is at once both natural and philoso
phical. The Soul can always sepa*-
rate and re- unite, recall and compare
her Ideas, and on this Activity de
pends her Liberty. We can always
think upon other Goods than those
we are actually thinking of. We
can always suspend bur Consent to
consider if the Good that we enjoy,
be, or be not the true Good. Our
Liberty does not consist in willing
without any Reason for willing 3 nor
in preferring a 1 ester Good to what
appears to us to be a greater 3 but it
consists in examining whether the
present Good be a real or an imagi
nary Good. The Soul exerts its Li
berty only when it is placed between
two Objects that seem worthy of
som$ Choice. It is never carried

away invincibly by the Impression
of any finite Good, because it cast
think upon other Goods much greater
than they, and thereby discover a su
perior Charm and Attraction that is
sufficient to get the better of the ap
parent and deceitful Good.
It must be owned that the Passi
ons by the lively Impressions which
they make on us, sometimes take up
all the Capacity of the Soul, and
hinder it from reflecting. They dar
ken its discerning Faculty, and hurry
it on to an Assent : They transform
Objects, and place them in a wrong
Light. But strong as they are, they
are never invincible 5 'tis difficult in
deed, but not impossible, to sur
mount them. 'Tis always in our
Power to diminish their Force gra
dually, and prevent their Excess.
This is the Warfare of Man on
Earth, and this is the Triumph of
^Virtue.

r
The Heathens feeling this Tyran
ny of the Passions, were convinced
by the Light of Nature alone, of
the Necessity of a celestial Power to
subdue them. They always repre
sent Virtue to us as a Divine Ener
gy descending from Heaven. They
axe continually bringing into their
Poems Guardian Deities that inspire,
enlighten and strengthen us, to fl?ew

The Magt add, that Oromazes is

that Oromazes made six Genii^

We have lost the ancient Books of

judge of their Mythology, we must
have recourse to the oriental Philoso
phers of our own time, and see if
there be still left among the Disciples
of Zoroaster any Traces of the an-
tient Doctrine of their Master. The
famous Dr. Hyde, a Diyine of the
Church of England, who had travel
led into the East, and perfectly un

Here we see the soui Notions that
I speak of in the foregoing Work :
i. A State before Good and Evil
were blended and confounded toge
ther. 2. A State after they were so
blended and confounded. 3 . A State
when Evil shall be entirely destroyed.
4. A middle God between the good
and the evil Principle.
As the Doctrine of the Persian
Magt is a Sequel of the Doctrine of
the Indian Brachmans, we must con
sult the one to put the other in a
clear Light. We have but few Tra
ces left of the antient Theology of
the Gymnofophifts , yet those which
Strabo has preserved, suppose the

I should hardly have thought
these Traditions authentick, or have
brought my self to trust to the Tran
slators of the Vedatoj if this Doc
trine had not been perfectly agree
able to that of Pythagoras , which I
gave an Account of a little before.
This Philosopher taught the Greeks
nothing but what he had learned from
the Gymnofophtjls.
The Discovery of these uniform
and agreeing Sentiments in Greece;
in Egypt, in Persia , and in the /»-
dies, made me desirous to advance
further into the Eafi , and to carry
my Searches as far as China. I ap
plied my self accordingly to such a£
understood the Language of that
Country, had spent several Years
together in it, and were well versed
in the original Books of that Nation.
And in this Point particularly I have
made great use of the Informations
I have
os the ANTIENTS.
I have received from a Gentleman
of a superior Genius, who does not
care to be mentioned till he has pub
lished a large Work upon these Mat
ters, which will be of Service to Re*
ligion , and do Honour to human
Understanding. In the mean time
he has allowed me to publish the
following Passages, which he tran
slated himself out of some antient
Chinese Books that have been brought
into Europe, and which may be seen
both at Parts and at Rome ; so that
all who understand the Language,
may judge of the Faithfulness os the
Translation.
The Book Yking, i. e. the Book
of Changes, is continually speak
ing of a double Heaven 5 a pri
mitive Heaven , and a posterior
Heaven. The first Heaven is there
described in the following Manner :
* All Things were then in an happy
¥ State, every thing was excellent,
f every
ii% Of the Mythology

' were perfect in their kind. In this
' happy Age Heaven and Earth em-
4 ployed their Virtues jointly to em-
' bellim Nature. There was no jar-
4 ring in the Elements, no Inclemen-
4 cy in the Air. All Things grew
4 without Labour, an universal Fer-
4 tility reigned every where. The
f active and passive Virtues consph>
' ed together without any Effort or

' the Universe/
In the Books which the Chinese
call King or Sacred, we read the sol*
lowing Passage j ' Whilst the first
* State of Heaven lasted, a pure
' Pleasure and a perfect Tranquillity
• reigned over all Nature. There
4 were neither Labour nor Fatigues,
1 nor Pains, nor Crimes. Nothing
4 made Opposition to the Will of
I Man/
of the ANTIENTS.
The Philosophers who stuck to
these antient Traditions, and parti
cularly Tchouangse says, i That in
* the State of the first Heaven, Man
4 was united inwardly to the supreme
' Reason, and outwardly he practi-
* sed all the Works of Justice. The
* Heart rejoiced in Truth, and there
* was no Mixture of Falfhood. Then
* the four Seasons of the Year fuc-
* ceeded each other regularly without
* Confusion. There were no impe-
* tuous Winds, nor excessive Rains.
* The Sun and the Moon without
* ever suffering an Eclipse, furnished
* a Light purer and brighter than
at present. The five Planets kept
on their Course without any In
equality. Nothing did Harm to
Man, and Man did Harm to no
thing. An universal Amity and
Harmony reigned over all Nature.

On the other side, the Philoso
pher Hoamantse speaking of the lat*
ter Heaven, says, c The Pillars of
* Heaven were broken, the Earth
' was shaken to its very Foundations.
4 The Heavens funk lower towards

* Planets altered their Course, and
' the universal Harmony was dis-
c turbed.'
The Philosophers Ventse and Li-
etse, who lived long before Hoat-
nantse, express themselves almost in
the same Terms. * The universal

* flowed the Face of the Earth.'
All these Evils arose, says the Book
Lzkiykt, 4 from Man's despising the
£ supreme Monarch of the Universe.
4 He would needs dispute about
* Truth and Falshood, and these Dis-
4 putes banished the eternal Reason.
£ He then fixed his Looks on terres-

The same Books speak of a time
when every thing is to be restored
to its first Splendour, by the coming
of an Hero called Kiuntse, which
signifies Shepherd and Prince, to whom
they give likewise the Names of The
most Holy, the Universal Teacher,
and the Supreme Truth. He answers
exactly to the Mythras of the Per
sians, the Orus of the Egyptians, the
Mercury of the Greeks, and the Bra-
ma of the Indians.
, The Chinese Books speak likewise
of the . Sufferings and Conflicts of
Kiuntse, just as the Syrians do of
the Death of Adonis, who was to
risse again to make Men happy *,
and as the Greeks do of the Labours

and painful Exploits of the Son of
Jupiter who was to come down up
on Earth. It looks as if the Source
of all these Allegories was only .an
antient Tradition common to all Na
tions, that the Middle God, to whom
they all give the Name of Soter or
Saviour, was to put an end to Crimes
by his great Sufferings. But I do
not lay a Stress upon this Notion,
my Design being only to speak of
the Traces that appear in all Religi
ons of a Nature exalted, fallen, and
to be repaired again by a Divine
Hero.
These Truths run equally through
out the Mythologies of the Greeks,
the Egyptians, the Persians, the In-r
dians, and the Chinese. 5Tis time
to come at last to the Jewish My
thology.
I mean by it the Rabbinism or
Philosophy of the Jewish Doctors,
B b 3 and
Os the Mythology
and particularly of the BJsenes.
These Philosophers asserted, accord
ing to the Testimony of Pbilo f;
and Josephus \, ' That the literal
' Sense of the sacred Text was only

'Twas the universal Taste of the
Orientals to make use of corporeal
Images to represent the Properties and
Operations of Spirits.
This symbolical Stile seems in a
great Measure authorized by the sa
cred Writers. The Prophet Daniel
represents God to us under the Image
of the Antient of Days. The He-

brew Mythologists and Cabbalists,
who are a Succession of the School
of the Rffenes, took occasion from
thence to explain the Divine Attri
butes, as Members of the Body of
the Antient of Days. We see this
Allegory carried to an Extravagance
in the Books of the Rabbins. They
speak there of the Dew that distilled
from the Brain of the Antient of
Days, from his Skull, his Hair, his
Forehead, his Eyes, and especially
from his wonderful Jkard.
These Comparisons are undoubt
edly absurd, and unbecoming the
Majesty os God: But the Cabbalis-
tical Philosophers pretend to autho
rize diem by some very metaphy
sical Notions.
The Creation, according to them,
is a Picture of the Divine Perfecti
ons. All created Beings are conse

tion as they have more or Icis Con
formity with their Original.
Hence it follows that all Crea
tures are in some Respect like one
another, and that Man, or the Mi
crocosm, resembles the great World *
or Macrocosm ; the material World
resembles the intelligible World, as
the intelligible World does the Ar
chetype, which is God.
These are the Principles upon
which the allegorical Expressions - of
the Cabbalists are founded, if we
strip their Mythology of this myste
rious Language, we shall find in it
sublime Notions very like those
which we have before admired in the
Heathen Philosophers. Now these
are the four principal ones which I
find clearly enough set forth in the
Works of the Rabbins Irira^ Mos-
chech, and Jitzack, which Ktttan

I leave the Reader to determine
whether these four Notions do not
resemble those which we have found
in Persia, in Egypt, and in Greece.
And this Resemblance I thought a
sufficient Authority for me to give
the sour mythological Pictures which
are inserted in the foregoing Work.
In all these Systems we see that
phe antient Philosophers, in order to
refute the Objections of the Impious
drawn from the Origin and Duration
of Evil, adopted the Doctrine of the
Prœ-existence os Souls, and their si"
nal Restoration. Several Fathers of
the Church have maintained the first
Opinion, as the only philosophical
Way of explaining original Sin. And
Origen made use of the latter, to op
pose the Libertines of his time.

if the ANTIENTS. i4I
It is far from my Intention to
defend these two Opinions discoun
tenanced by the Church. All the
use I make of the Arguments
which the wisse Antients found out
against Impiety, is to shew, that
Reason alone furnishes Means suffi
cient to confound such Philosophers
as refuse to believe unless they can
comprehend*
'Tis sot this Reason that I make
Daniel speak a different Language
from Eleazer. The Prophet advi
ses Cyrus to lay aside all subtile Specu
lations, and to leave to God the Care
of justifying the incomprehensible
Steps of his Providence. He plun
ges him again in an Obscurity more
wholsome and more suitable to hu
man Weakness, than all the Conjec
tures of Philosophers. He reduceth
what we are to believe on this Sub
ject:, to these four principal Truths. .
i. God
Os the Mythology
1. God being infinitely good, can
not produce wicked and miserable
Beings 3 and therefore the moral and
physical Evil which we see in the U-
niverse, must come from the Abuse
that Men make of their Liberty.
2. Human Nature is fallen from
the first Purity in which it was crea
ted, and this mortal Life is a State
of Trial, in which Souls are cured
of their Corruption, and aspire to
Immortality by their Virtue.
3. God is united to human Na
ture in order to expiate moral Evil
by his Sacrifice. The MeJJias will
come at last in his Glory to destroy
physical Evil, and renew the Face of
the Earth.
4. These Truths have been trans
mitted to us from Age to Age, from
the time of the Deluge till now, by
art
of the ANTIENTS.
an universal Tradition. Other Na
tions have obscured and altered this
Tradition by their Fables. It has
been preserved in its Purity no where
but in the Holy Scriptures, the Au
thority of which cannot be disputed
with any Shadow of Reason.
5Tis a common Notion that all
the Footsteps of natural and reveal'd
Religion which we see in the Heathen
Poets and Philosophers , are origi
nally owing to their having read the
Books of Moses. But 'tis impossi
ble to answer the Objections which
are made against this Opinion. The
Jews and their Books were too long
concealed in a Corner oftheEarth,to be
reasonably thought the primitive Light
of the Gentiles. We must go further
back, even to the Deluge. Tis sur
prising that those who are convinced
of the Authority of the sacred Books,
have not made Advantage of this
System to prove the Truth of the
Mosakk

gin of the World, the universal De

therwise than by the Doctrine I have
. put in the Mouth of Daniel, that U-
niformity of Sentiments which we
find in the Religions of all Nations.
The four great Principles I have
spoken of, seem to me the Founda
tion of Christianity. I have had a
Pleasure in paying this small Homage -
to our Religion by endeavouring to
justify its Tenets against^ the super

and the vain Subtilties of audacious
Criticks, who cavil at eternal Wis*
