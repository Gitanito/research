  Commentary      Conquering Cancer Through Living Fearlessly,      By Herb Weiss  
       weekly Commentary, detailing Anita Moorjani&#39;s NDE, (attached)&nbsp;was printed in the   Friday, November 9, 2012 in the Pawtucket Times and the Saturday, November 10,   2012, in   the Woonsocket Call, two daily newspapers in Rhode Island&nbsp;(on the Editorial   page) &nbsp; 
  &nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   We’ve heard it before – “don’t sweat the small   stuff”, &nbsp;    “do not fear death…only the unlived life”, “live your life   to the fullest”. &nbsp;   Anita  Moorjani, 50, only   knows the truth behind these familiar sayings all too well because of a Near   Death Experience (NDE) she had in 2006.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   In  Moorjani’s book,   Dying to be   Me: My Journey From Cancer To Near Death, To True Healing ,   published in 2012 by Hay Houses, USA, the Hong Kong-resident recounts stories of   her childhood, being raised Hindu while residing in a largely Chinese and   British society in Hong Kong. &nbsp;   &nbsp; Throughout her adult life, she faced challenges to   find a  &nbsp; profession,   eventually found her one true love, &nbsp;   husband Danny, and eventually fought her devastating   cancer, which lead to her death, but ultimately came back to life and became   healed, an outcome that today baffles the medical world.    &nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   The 191 page inspirational tome tells how    Moorjani fought against Stage IV lymphoma for almost four   years, ultimately a terminal disease that spread from the base of her skull,   which traveled over her neck and down to her abdomen. &nbsp;   Her body was riddled with malignant tumors, “some   the size of lemons”, she recalls.    &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   As a result of her near death experience, and the   publicity generated by her book,  Moorjani now speaks   at conferences and events around the world to share her insights gained from her   Near Death Experience. &nbsp;   She is also a frequent guest at The University of   Hong Kong’s department of behavioral sciences speaking on topics such as dealing   with terminal illness, facing death, and the psychology of spiritual beliefs. &nbsp;     &nbsp;

  Crossing Over &nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   By the morning of February 2, 2006,    Moorjani was wheel-chair bound, on oxygen and receiving   full-time care at home. &nbsp;   She was sliding in and out of consciousness while   experiencing breathing difficulties due to fluid in her lungs. &nbsp;   Her body was swollen with open skin lesions and she   was soon admitted to the local hospital in a coma. &nbsp;   Her outcome was grim, and the attending physician   informed her husband that he did not expect her to survive for another 36 hours.     &nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Now in the ICU and having been in a coma for nearly   20 hours, the forty-four year old woman’s vital organs began to fail. In fact,   she was ultimately pronounced dead. &nbsp;   Moorjani recalls entering into a “NDE”, having a   spiritual epiphany while on the other side of death’s veil. &nbsp;   She came to understand the ultimate cause of her   devastating medical condition, which she reports as    &nbsp; “being   fearful of life”. &nbsp;   When she chose to return to her physical body,   Moorjani knew that she indeed had the power to heal   her body of the spreading cancer,    &nbsp; knowing   with certainty that this medical miracle would occur.    &nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Over a six month period after her NDE,    Moorjani was given chemotherapy,    &nbsp; even   though every medical test revealed no trace of cancer. &nbsp;   A lymph node biopsy also revealed no cancer in any   of her lymph nodes..

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Like millions of others who have reported NDE,   Moorjani had experienced many of its classic traits. &nbsp;   She recalls having “an extreme sense of peace and   well-being, an intense feeling of unconditional love”, and became reunited with   deceased family and friends and spiritual guides.    &nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Her book noted that even in a coma in this very deep   NDE, she was acutely aware of her surroundings. &nbsp;   She heard a physician tell her husband, outside her   room in the corridor, that her organs were failing and she would not last the   night. &nbsp;    In her NDE she knew that her brother was on a plane coming   to say his goodbyes, too.    &nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   On the other side,    Moorjani recounts in this book how she received profound knowledge about her   life, mission and purpose of life with an understanding of the nature of the   universe as well. &nbsp;   When the terminally ill woman approached the   boundary of no return, she remembers she had a decision to make, to stay and   sever ties with her sickly body, or come back to heal and accomplish her life’s   mission. &nbsp; &nbsp; Choosing   to voluntarily return to her disease-ridden body, upon regaining consciousness,   she knew that her body would be quickly healed of cancerous tumors. She was   released from the hospital within weeks, without a trace of cancer in her body.     &nbsp;

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   With an increased belief in the God-force within, no   longer would Moorjani fear death, and this experience fueled her desire to   confront life fearlessly.

  &nbsp;  
  NDE Is a      Common Occurrence

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Over the years, Jeffrey Long, M.D., a leading NDE   researcher, has documented over 3,000 NDEs, posted on the        www.nderf.org  website.&nbsp;The practicing radiation   oncologist says that this data base is by far the largest collection of NDEs,   available in 22 languages, that is publicly accessible. &nbsp;   Readers from over 100 different foreign countries   access Dr. Long’s web site monthly. &nbsp;   Over 300,000 pages are read from this website every   month. &nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Meanwhile, Dr. Long’s website, notes that a lthough   most people who come near death do not remember anything, around 18% later   report that “something happened.”&nbsp; That “something” is often a near-death   experience NDE, says Long. &nbsp;   He notes a 1993 Gallop Poll estimated that 12 to 15   million Americans personally experienced a NDE. &nbsp;   As of 2001, almost 600 adults per day across the   nation experience an NDE.     &nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   According to Dr. Long, who penned the    New York Times    bestseller,    Evidence of the Afterlife: The Science of Near-Death Experiences ,   Moorjani’s, NDE is “ one   of the  most profound NDEs ever reported.&nbsp; The   insights that she received during her NDE are profound, yet corroborated by the   insights of many other NDErs.”    &nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Dr. Long noted, “I have carefully reviewed Anita   Moorjani’s incredible recovery and NDE.&nbsp; It is   medically inexplicable.&nbsp; Doctor’s don’t like to use the term ‘miracle’, but   that is the best word to describe her experience.” &nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   While he did not review her original medical   records, one physician did. In an email and a press release, promoting a   workshop to discuss  Moorjani’s &nbsp;   rapid remission from an advanced stage of cancer,   Dr. Peter  Ko, an oncologist who reviewed her medical   records did not attribute her dramatic recovery to her chemotherapy. &nbsp;   “Based on what we have learned about cancer cell   behaviors, I speculate that something (non-physical...”information”?) either   switched off the mutated genes from expressing, or signaled them to a programmed   cell death. &nbsp;    The exact mechanism is unknown to us, but not likely to be   the result of  cytotoxic drugs.” &nbsp;     &nbsp;

  Lessons Learned from Beyond the Veil &nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Moorjani now believes that her cancer manifested in   her physical body due to the fear of being herself, displeasing others, not   measuring up to their expectations  andthe fear of   living life to the fullest. &nbsp;   In fact, it was being “fearful of everything,” said   the internationally recognized writer, that blocked her greater essence from   healing the physical body.    &nbsp; &nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   “Only when I realized my own magnificence, my own   perfection, my own self worth as a beautiful child of the universe, was I able   to let go of fear and embrace life with all its uncertainties, ambiguities,   joys, sorrows, and challenges. Seeing myself as perfection, as an exquisite   manifestation of life, led to my healing,” she said.    &nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Moreover, a prevalent part of her experience was the   realization that we are all interconnected and when she was not in her body she   was able to clearly see this. &nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Finally, “laughter and a good sense of humor can be   your best medicine” - Moorjani recommends not to take your life too seriously,   just “Learn to lighten up and laugh. Don’t be afraid of just being yourself.”
