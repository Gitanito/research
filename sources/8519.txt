  		          The Near-Death Experience talks about the law of Attraction

  By D

&nbsp;

    Another thing supportive of the law of attraction is how consistently time is   viewed as an illusion. &nbsp;Then I   heard a voice... It was soothing. It said, 'EVERYTHING IS NOW.' And not only   that, but every possible outcome for every possible situation that could ever   happen is happening at the same time. At this very moment. At every moment.'&nbsp;--   Linda U &nbsp;

&nbsp; Note: the     ellipsis is provided by me.

  &nbsp;

    &nbsp; A key tenet of the law of attraction is that we should assume the   feeling of our desire fulfilled and live it now. Even Jesus taught it: &nbsp;Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask in prayer, &nbsp;believe   that you have received it, and it will be yours.&nbsp; (ESV) &nbsp;

  &nbsp;

    &nbsp; A great proof of how sustained belief creates our reality is   produced by Cynthia Stafford:

&nbsp; 
She received   exactly what she wanted (for that matter the actor&nbsp;Jim&nbsp;Carrey did it too).

  &nbsp;

    &nbsp;Some of the experiencers talk of the existence of everything and nothing at the   same time. Well, it seems to me as if they are possibly describing   potentiality/possibilities. &nbsp; For such possibilities related to the earthly&nbsp;plane&nbsp;refer&nbsp;to&nbsp; Lori   E's, and Anita M's experience in the violet text.&nbsp;

  &nbsp;

    A strange sense of duality from time as physical beings perceive it. &nbsp;As if time   had absolutely no real meaning in this form. &nbsp;So much was exchanged, and   yet.....seemingly nothing at all.&nbsp;&nbsp;As if EVERYTHING was ''known'' to me,   but that&nbsp;there was NOTHING at all.&nbsp;It was like being a part of absolutely   everything at once, having no sense of a individuality, but also like a total   void of anything, save a sort of sense of peace and contentment. &nbsp;So very hard   to express. &nbsp;A glimpse into both everything and nothing I guess.&nbsp; -- Anthony S&nbsp; &nbsp;

  &nbsp;

    When I first passed out, I entered the void-darkness-abyss.&nbsp;It was   everything, yet nothing.&nbsp;It felt as if&nbsp;it were raw un-manifested energy.&nbsp;I   didn't feel loneliness or any negative emotions, nor positive emotions, either.   I felt in balance between the two. &nbsp;-- Trevor O&nbsp;

  &nbsp;

    When I entered into the light. &nbsp;I entered into the 'void' and into 'everything'   at the same time..I realized everything was god and is permanently creating.   &nbsp;Nothingness creating nothingness. --   Hafur&nbsp; &nbsp;

  &nbsp;

    Law of attraction related : &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;

  &#10086;  &nbsp;'All that can be imagined may exist because it originates from   universal consciousness (knowledge), thought is creative! Here things occur with   a delay, but on the other side they happen instantly. God (us) is a vibration,   love and this vibration create light. The more we love, the more we emit light   because we vibrate faster!' -- Leonard

    &nbsp;

  &nbsp;

  &#10086;  &nbsp;'Our life is just a thought providing circumstances for this   existence' -- Henry W&nbsp;

    &nbsp;

  &nbsp;

  &#10086;  &nbsp;'I was aware of things on the outlying edges of my own   consciousness. Like, all I had to do was focus on them, as they were already   there -I just allow them into my sight. Everything I could ever want, was   available. I just had to let it in. See it. Kind of like when you lose   something. You go back and look and look in the same places. Suddenly, the tenth   time you open the drawer, you see it there! It wasn't magically put there, it   was there the entire time, you just didn't see it! Now, I saw it!! It was the   law of manifestation right in front of me. How everything is there, I just have   to let it come forward. If I got rid of all this fear, and all the feelings it   created, I could effortlessly let it roll into my line of vision. It was already   mine, I just needed to see it...To know I am the creative force within my own   life'that what I think and feel about myself and others affects my surroundings'   -- Lori NOTE: the ellipsis is provided by me.

  &nbsp;

  &#10086;  &nbsp;'Yes&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the time, I was trying   desperately to grasp on to these lessons, but it felt as though 99% was lost   when I returned to my body. &nbsp;It wasn't until I read 'the amazing power of   deliberate intent' years later that I 'remembered' it. &nbsp;Essentially, the purpose   of life is to experience radiant joy, to feel elation and excitement, and that   we are the creators of our existence. &nbsp;I got goose bumps upon reading this, and   knew instantly what they were speaking of.'--Donna K

  &nbsp;

  &#10086;  &nbsp;'There is a divine magnetic pull infusing thought patterns and   vibrational energies. These are truly exciting magical times ahead.' &nbsp;-- Renee M

  &nbsp;

  &#10086;  &nbsp;'I will say that we our co-creators and can very well create   our own realities.'-- Mary&amp; Richard

  &nbsp;

  &#10086;  &nbsp;'That we are the true creators here on earth and by our   believing and experience love we create our greatness, but if we experience in   fear we reap nothing but darkness and fear.'-- Virginia D

&nbsp;

  &nbsp;

  &#10086;  &nbsp;'It can be, if that's what you want. It can be Hell, as well,   if that's what you believe. This reality is an extension of you, instantly   realized and formed. You always create your own reality, no matter where you   find yourself, for we are all co-creators.' -- Richard L

&nbsp;

  &nbsp;

  &#10086;  &nbsp;'We are all co creators of our life's path and everything in   our experience.' -- David B

&nbsp;

  &nbsp;

  &#10086; &nbsp;  &nbsp;'I did not understand why my thoughts would manifest afterwards.   Everything I would think of would appear and it concerned me so I made a promise   to myself that I would keep positive thoughts and images because I learned that   our thoughts are powerful either negative or positive...I feel sometimes that if   we think of something and we are passionate about it then it can manifest and   that may be called the law of attraction.'-- Jenneane E&nbsp;

    Note: the ellipsis is provided by me.

&nbsp;

  &nbsp;

  &#10086;  &nbsp;'We need to come to understand that the responsibilities of   life are ours. What we become is affected by what we want. Whether consciously   or unconsciously, we create our reality. We are what we believe. We need to live   with balance (equilibrium) in everything we do. &nbsp;I don't know where I came up   with this philosophy of life. I think it was all part of the experience I had.'   -- Magda

  &nbsp;

  &#10086;  &nbsp;'We are what we think.'--Derry B

&nbsp;

  &nbsp;

  &#10086; &nbsp;  &nbsp;'But I know that everything I saw originates from thoughts, or   the universal mind, that is projected in images and events that interact with   lucid consciousness as an experience, and that this whole experience is a part   the infinitude of that which is real on every plain or level of existence that   we want to invent or divide into pieces so that our temporal mind can decipher   it despite its limitations. &nbsp;I believe I understood that what we call god is the   silence of indescribable life that is in everything, and everything is in   it...What we think or want to think is what is, come what may. In this way the   universe is constructed. &nbsp;It is like a game of consciousness that recognizes   itself and recreates itself through each one of us, and at the same time we are   the 'point of nothingness' in which life becomes self-aware. &nbsp;-It is difficult   to express this-' -- Hafur &nbsp;NOTE: the ellipsis is provided by me.

&nbsp;

  &nbsp;

  &#10086;  &nbsp;'I feel that once you start believing that something is   possible, you start to let it into your awareness, and then it starts to become   true for you. &nbsp;The more you believe it, the more it starts to become real for   you. This is why it is so, very important to believe in positive things, rather   than negative things. &nbsp;Whatever you believe, you will find that you are correct.   &nbsp;The universe has a way of presenting to you exactly what you believe. &nbsp;If you   think life is great, you are correct. If you think life is tough, you will be   proved correct too...The way I view life now, nothing exists in this world until   we bring it into our consciousness/awareness. Nothing exists until we express   it, either as an individual or as a collective. The more awareness we draw to   something, the more real it becomes in the physical. As a collective, we are   probably inadvertently creating our physical reality by default, unknowingly.   But as individuals, we always have the choice to create differently than what is   being created 'out there'.'-- Anita M

&nbsp; NOTE: the   ellipsis is provided by me.&nbsp;

    Note: Anita M talks a great deal of the law of attraction; the text above is a   small part.&nbsp; &nbsp;

    Compare Anita M's analogy to Lori E's:&nbsp;

  &nbsp;

  &#10048;     'I now know   that a lot more exists than we are consciously aware of or capable of   understanding. Each day, I am understanding more and more since the NDE. &nbsp;I am   finding out that there are things I now feel I 'know' or 'understand', which I   never did before.&nbsp;&nbsp; The best example I can think of is: imagine there   is a huge warehouse, which is dark, and you live in this warehouse with one   flashlight. Everything you know about this warehouse is seen through the light   of this one small flashlight. Whenever you want to look for something, you may   or may not find it, but it does not mean the thing does not exist. &nbsp;It is there,   but you just haven't flashed your light on it. &nbsp;You can only see what your light   is focused on. &nbsp;Then one day, someone flicks on a lightswitch, and for the first   time, you can see the whole warehouse. &nbsp;The vastness of it is almost   overwhelming, you can't see all the way to the end, and you know there is more   than what you can see. &nbsp;But you do see how all the products are lined up on all   the shelves, and you notice just how many different things there are in the   warehouse which you never noticed, never even conceived having existed, yet they   do, simultaneously with the things you know existed (those are the things your   flashlight had been able to find). &nbsp;Then, even when the light switch goes back   off, nothing can take away the understanding and clarity of your experience.   &nbsp;Even though you are back to one flashlight, you now know how to look for   things. &nbsp;You know what is possible, and you even know what to look for. &nbsp;You   start viewing things differently, and it is from this new springboard that your   experiences start to happen. &nbsp;And so I find that in my daily life, I am   referring referring to different aspects of my experience at different times,   and I am understanding things in a different way, and knowing things I did not   know I knew.' -- Anita M

&nbsp;

  &nbsp;

  &#10048;  'I was aware of things on the outlying edges of my own   consciousness. Like, all I had to do was focus on them, as they were already   there'I just allow them into my sight. Everything I could ever want, was   available. I just had to let it in. See it. Kind of like when you lose   something. You go back and look and look in the same places.

&nbsp;

  &nbsp;

  &#10086;  &nbsp;'I said, 'I saw that many of my thoughts became actual physical   things. How is this possible?' They said, 'Thoughts ARE things. What you image   with emotion is what we must give you in order for you to learn to become us.   When you learn to generate a stable image, coupled with firm emotion, we are   bound to bring it into being. But remember, there are issues to having this   thing.' I said, 'Such as?' They replied 'Such as, do you have the means to   support keeping the item now that you have it? Do you actually, truly want it   now that you have it? For example, you cannot image intangible things. Can you   image acceptance, or can you only feel it? Can you image love, or can you only   experience it? You have much to learn Childing. Do you wish to stay or do you   wish to return?... Here is all you have to remember. What you think with emotion   is what you will get. It doesn't&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   matter the thought or the emotion. If the thought is beneficial, and the emotion   is non-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   beneficial, the results will be scattered, but you will get it. If the thought   is beneficial, and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the emotion is beneficial, you will   get it. If the thought is non-beneficial, and the emotion is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   non-beneficial, you will get it. Again, what you think with emotion is what you   get.' -- Childing&nbsp; &nbsp; NOTE:   the ellipsis is provided by me. Now upon second reread the story seems dubious.

  &nbsp;

  &#10086;  &nbsp;'Yes&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes but was given the knowledge that I am in   complete control of what I want in this life.' -- Matthew&nbsp;

&nbsp;

  &nbsp;

  &#10086;  &nbsp;'Knowing, content, responsible for every thing in my life.' --   Bob S

&nbsp;

  &nbsp;

  &#10086;  &nbsp;'I decided to wake up and realized I was awake. I decided to   meditate and realized I was meditating. I was all these things at the same time.   &nbsp;It took me days to get over it and years to understand it. That what is around   us is a perfect real time reflection of our inner state of being. What we   perceive to be external is actually internal. A waking dream where the external   environment and events mirror perfectly our inner state of being. &nbsp;Just like a   dream that we have at night is really happening inside us, but during the dream   it feels like it is outside our center of awareness. If you dream that a wolf is   chasing you through the forest, when you wake up you realize that you were   yourself, you were the wolf and you were the forest. It all seems to be dreams   within dreams within dreams.' -- Tom H

&nbsp;

  &nbsp;

  &#10086;  &nbsp;'I also learned that the creative mind is the most powerful   instrument we have if we just learn to put it to use... When I finally realized   what was taking place, I lost my fear of death and I knew life held no   limitations. &nbsp;I could do anything I put my mind to. &nbsp;This led me to a successful   life. &nbsp;Once you know the truth, there is nothing to fear and life opens up to   you. &nbsp;You begin living. &nbsp;Fear is what limits us. &nbsp;No more fear... I knew the   power of the mind was vast and I took advantage of it... I know that we humans   are the shapers of our destiny, and when I learned what I learned, I knew that   nothing could stop me from attaining my dreams.' -- Kim B

  &nbsp;

  &#10086;  &nbsp;'I had explored New Thought a few years after my NDE because it   felt more in alignment with my experience; however, my desire to remain part of   my family - and The Church was more powerful than the desire to live my life -   true to myself...&nbsp;Yes &nbsp;I went from Catholic to New Thought.'-- Joan LH

&nbsp; Note: the   ellipsis is provided by&nbsp;me.

  &nbsp;

  &#10086;  &nbsp;'Yes totally....from staunch   Catholic to Doctorate of Divinity in New thought, ancient wisdom.' -- Peg A

  &nbsp;

  &nbsp;

  &#10086;  &nbsp;'we control our destiny. our   thoughts and prayers are very powerful and our perception becomes our reality'   -- Filiesha I

&nbsp;

  &nbsp;

  &#10086;  &nbsp;'Yes&nbsp;&nbsp; That we are all   one, that we exist in both dimensions all the time and we can control our   destiny.' -- Robert C

&nbsp;

  &nbsp;

  &#10086;  &nbsp;'And   we are all here to remind each other of our pure essence and what we can create   in this 3-dimensional world through love and co-creating...And what I learned is   that no matter what, we can change things to create heaven on earth here right   now.' -- Cherie B&nbsp;  Note: the   ellipsis is provided by me.

&nbsp;

  &nbsp;

  &#10086;  &nbsp;'Yes&nbsp;&nbsp; So we can learn   and grow....ultimately learning the power we have within us to create our lives   if we honor our calling, our Divine purpose.' -- Steve I

  &#10086;  &nbsp;' First, what I learned is that there   is nothing to seek, there is only plenty to discard. Second, there is nothing to   seek because there is nothing that you don't already have. What we are is an   incredible-unimaginable-boundless gift of infinity to our selves. The only thing   we need to do to earn it is to just enjoy it. How much better does it get than   that? ... My life is now a function of trusting and allowing rather then doing   and achieving. I have realized that belief in what I already have is my true   nature rather then striving for what I perceive to not have .'   &nbsp;    -- Victor C  Note: compare to Lori E's, and Anita   M's experience (the violet text above). It's a meditation experience. Ellipsis   is provided by me.

&nbsp;

    &nbsp;

  &#10086;  &nbsp;' &quot;Remember this and never forget; you   save, redeem and heal yourself. You always have. You always will. You were   created with the power to do so from before the beginning of the world.&quot; ' --   Mellen-Thomas Benedict

&nbsp;

    &nbsp;

  &#10086;  &nbsp;'...we are here to make a difference   and everything that happens is a choice.&nbsp; Free will always reigns....We are   ALL great and powerful beings.' -- Susan R       &nbsp;Note: the ellipses are provided by me. (SOBE)

&nbsp;

    &nbsp;

  &#10086;  &nbsp;'For people to KNOW they really do   create because we are co-creators. ...Cannot stand feeling negativity from   others or hear &quot;pain words&quot; that people do not realize is an energy. EVERYTHING   is.' -- Linda S&nbsp;     Note:&nbsp;        the ellipsis is provided by me.       (SOBE)

&nbsp;

    &nbsp;

  &#10086;  &nbsp;'Yes It has been as if what I place my   awareness on, manifests.' -- Michelle M&nbsp;       Note: compare to Jenneane E's (the tenth citation descending order)

&nbsp;

    &nbsp;

  &#10086;  &nbsp;'Yes I now know that ALL THINGS ARE   POSSIBLE that there are no rights or wrongs. Things just &quot;ARE&quot;. ...      Doubt nothing.   All things are possible!  ' -- Renee G    Note: ellipsis is provided   by me &nbsp;

&nbsp;

    &nbsp;

    &nbsp; &#10086;  &nbsp;'It taught me that nothing is impossible; that we are divine   beings and can accomplish anything we desire, provided we did it with good   intentions and that there is nothing really good or bad; it just is potential. '   -- Padma

&nbsp;

    &nbsp;

  &#10086;  &nbsp;'Yes The cosmic consciousness, for   whatever it is - is real. And something out there, works on our behalf and   possible at our beck and call. I believe, we must be EXTREMELY CAREFUL as to our   INTENTIONS. Positive or Negative, you attract. A spiritual law - what goes   around comes around. Or, whatsoever you sow, so shall you reap.' -- Stephen R       Note: (OBE)

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

  &#10086;  'For the rest of my life I have watched   as the most fleeting and buried intentions - the ones we don't even think we   have ' manifest in external situations within our health or circumstances or in   others. Undigested impulse and well-suppressed emotion snake out to wreak havoc   externally. They create material situations and tangible real-world   repercussions. I see that one of the greatest jobs I'm given in this life is to   wrestle these very human energies into unified, directed control of a heart- and   mind-empowered will. ' -- Cami R       &nbsp;Note: there's plenty of law of attraction stuff in her account, so if you find   her trustworthy check it out for more.

  &#10086; &nbsp;     'In addition, If I think of something, all of a sudden it just comes   into my life, effortlessly.' -- Dawn W     &nbsp; Note: compare to Jenneane   E's (the tenth citation descending order)       and Michelle M (the thirty second citation descending order[the fifth citation   above this one]) 
  &nbsp;

    &nbsp;

  &#10086; &nbsp; 'I create and co-create my life,   and am deeply aware of this.....'-- Krista G

&nbsp;

  &nbsp;

    Conclusion: &nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the notion of the law of attraction is not only   present in all religious teachings but also in near-death and out-of-body   experiences.
