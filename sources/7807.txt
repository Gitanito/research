  		              		Experience Description   

    I do not remember getting hit or two weeks before the experience.  I could tell my brother all about the lady. I can tell details such as what the lady looked like,  how she had her hair, and the look on her face as if I were standing in front of her car and looking at her shocked face.  After I died 4 times in the care flight. I died once at the hospital, then came back to life, while on life support. 

     I was a depressed teen in 1996.  I saved up my prescription drugs for two months.    I cleaned my room, and then took a  bottle of pills.  As an afterthought, I felt I should go tell my mom.  I did not tell her because she had cancer and I did not want to get into trouble. 

     The next thing I knew, I was in the top of the room of my bedroom. There was  an angel on either side of me and they were holding me up.    I felt AMAZING!  I wanted to stay but I felt God was telling me it was not my time to stay stay there. Then  I knew that  my mom was crying while dragging me to the bathtub.  I threatened her so she would not take me to the hospital.  I still wanted to go back there.  I scared her so bad with my threat, that she did not call 911.  She told my brother to take me out of the tub and  not let me fall asleep.

  I have since then seen life very differently.  Life IS eternal.

  Please compare your vision during the experience to your everyday vision that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.       There were angels in my peripheral vision.  I was young, so not sure if it was more vivid. I just remember I was floating over my own body and I felt so great and the angels on either side.  I was not alone,  though I felt alone and helpless.  (Teen incident)

God, Spiritual and Religion:       

What was your religion prior to your experience?      Christian- Protestant   Life is everlasting.  I know

  Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was both consistent and not consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience.     I did not know about a tunnel in 1988.  I didn't know much about death at all.  In 1996, I was not surprised that God was not done with me yet. The angels were surprising the way they held me.  
  
  Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         Yes     I knew God existed. It was in 1996, I realized he was really with me.  I was upset he sent me back to earth so I was kind of trying to get into accidents and seeing if God would take me back.  I was 16 and depressed, but I knew after this time dying. I had a plan but was a little rebellious toward God for a small time after he sent me back.  
  
Did you seem to encounter a mystical being or presence, or hear an unidentifiable voice?         I encountered a definite being, or a voice clearly of mystical or unearthly origin   No voices, just Angels  

Did you see deceased or religious spirits?         I actually saw them  

Did you encounter or become aware of any beings who previously lived on earth who are described by name in religions (for example: Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, etc.)?         Yes   Jesus was in the tunnel in front of the crowd.  

During your experience, did you gain information about premortal existence?         Uncertain     Not sure  

During your experience, did you gain information about universal connection or oneness?         Yes     I was and am connected to God, our creator.  

During your experience, did you gain information about the existence of God?         Yes     He spoke to me, I felt Him.  

Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:       

During your experience, did you gain special knowledge or information about your purpose?      Yes   I can't describe it but, yes. I still feel like I have a purpose and want to help as many people as I can.  

During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?         Yes     God is in control, not us.  God wants us to follow Jesus and do His will.  He wants great things for us.  

  During your experience, did you gain information about an afterlife?         An afterlife definitely exists.     We never are not existing.  We are eternal beings. That is what that experience was about.  
  
Did you gain information about how to live our lives?         Yes     Be kind to one another, we are only on this earth for a second in time.  Treat each other good and forgive one another.

  During your experience, did you gain information about love?         Yes     I gained more insight to love others.  
  
What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         Large changes in my life     There is too much to write...God has been a great source of communication and a care taker for me and my children. Miracle after miracle.  

Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          Yes   

After the NDE:       

Was the experience difficult to express in words?        Yes   You can never really give a story like that justice with words.  

How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  These are defining moments.  

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         Yes     I can feel others thoughts and feelings. Mind reading. If I think of someone, they call or pop up in roughly 24 hrs.  It is strange, I know.  I have gotten used to it.  If I lose something.  All I have to do is ask God and I find it.  God fixed my car just by me asking.  God is the answer for anything you need.  

Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          The 1988 experience...many people were watching. It was super Tuesday. The lady that hit me was my grandfather's childhood pastors daughter who lived far away. She had been in town for a school reunion or party. Just the dynamics of that incident are astronomical.

What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real     My consciousness was the same as now...during the experience but I felt so much greater than the earth experience.  

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       Uncertain   I feel like I am having an earth experience.  Like I know I am just passing through this life. It is a gift.  

Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?         Yes  

  Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?         Ppl think I am very unique.  Some think I am weird. Some appreciate a person like me; everyone is different.
