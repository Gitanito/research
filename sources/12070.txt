  		              		Experience Description   

    During my NDE, I had both negative and positive visions. I also had a life review as well as the ability to see future events in my life. Numbers played an important factor in my NDE. To start, I was standing on what resembled a number line. I was standing at a perfect zero in physical form on this number line. I could see my entire body in physical form. The right side of the number line had a bluish color. The left side had a reddish color. My attire was the same as it was when I went in for surgery.

  I was wearing a black skirt, white sleeveless shirt with black roses on it. I saw a soul like variation of myself standing directly across from where I was standing in physical form. From the waist up, I saw the soul-like variation of myself, wearing the same attire as the physical form of me. The soul-like variation of myself was surrounded by  a flourescent bluish-whitish color light. A red question mark was above the middle of my forehead. On each side, the number line extended to the number 104 on both sides. I saw the number 104 burning in flames to the left of me. The numbers 72 and 22 were lit up to the right of me. Those were the only numbers I had seen so vividly. Those 3 numbers had stood out more than any of the other numbers. I didn't see any symbols on the left side. I experienced smells of burning flesh and hair while looking towards the left of the number line during my life review.

   There was a door that was a greyish-black color. It was very squeaky and needed some  WD40 lubricant. The door appeared to be very heavy in weight. Out of the door came 2 soul-like figures that were literally burning alive. This was my soon-to-be-EX-husband and his father, burning alive right before my eyes. Seeing them standing to the left of me at a 45 degree angle, they were screaming in pain, regret, and, remorse and it was so hard for me to grasp. With each flame that arose, more and more regret, anger, remorse and rage consumed their souls. Then came my life review, which was also done on the same side as their burning souls. A complete life review on the left side of how I treated others was quite overwhelming. In that moment, the speed of my life was  flashing before me. A speed that is immeasurable on Earth. By comparison, the speed was much  faster than watching a DVD being rewound on the fastest speed. Seeing the pain and agony of how poorly I had treated people was a shock at all levels. Seeing the lies that I told; the cheating, and stealing was shown so vividly. I saw my drug using days, and the vast amount of disrespect I had for people, even those of whom I professed to love. My mother was one of the biggest victims of my disrespect, prior to my NDE. It was as if I were watching a rewound version of my life, while wearing 3D glasses. 

   During the life review, I felt heat that was so very intense and more intense than any inferno. My wrongdoings (sins) were measured in sync and severity with the heat. Once adultery was shown, the heat became even more intense. Lying caused the heat to intensify just as much as the adultery. Based on the temperature of the heat, the message instantly revealed was that I needed to be truthful in all of my actions. It also revealed telepathically to not be so aggressive. A divine telepathic communication that was telling me to be more loving and open my heart. After my life review, there was a brief minute of darkness. 

   Directly following that brief screen of darkness, I was now at the right side of the number line. There was a divine presence of positive energy as well as telepathic communication from the Divine, while on the right side. I would have to classify the right side as the high definition side. Emotions really seemed to manifest themselves within me, while on this side. Practicality seemed to dissipate, allowing more heartfelt love to flow into me. The love was overwhelming, unadulterated bliss that had consumed my soul, unlike anything I had ever felt before. I felt a sense of peace and content  as I was gazing at the intensely, bright light. On this side, their was no fear, heat, or foul smells. Negativity was non-existent on this side because of so much positive energy. Love was a more prominent emotion, unlike fear on the left side. 

  Through a smoky-beam of bluish-white light, I did see what resembled a word globe looking symbol in a brassy gold   color. There were some squiggly  lines, with 3 letters accompanying the globe-like symbol. Due to the light being so bright, I could only make out one of the letters, in which looked like a crooked M. I had experienced communication with a deceased little girl, of  whom later revealed to be my daughter. I was given the opportunity to converse with this little girl about making changes.

  While staring at her features in my NDE, I saw so much of myself in her. She had long black hair and beautiful dark brown eyes. Her complexion was so beautiful and I saw my features. She had her father's eyes, and was probably close to 5 years old. Immediately and instinctively, I knew who she was before even asking. I was in awe of the similarity in features and asked 'are you'....? Before I could finish the sentence, she said, 'Yes Mommy', I'm your daughter.' By her physical appearance and age range, I knew this had to be true. She says 'Mommy, why couldn't you keep me?' I said, 'Baby, mommy had what was called an abortion.' I said, 'There isn't a day that goes by that I don't think about you.' 'Mommy is so sorry and I was married to another man and your daddy was married to another woman.' I asked, 'Do you forgive me'? She says, 'Yes Mommy! It's OK Mommy, but you have to change. Mommy, you have to stop being mean to people.'

   Standing beside her was a tall handsome man, wearing an aqua, iced-blue dress shirt. He was standing at a 45 degree angle under the word globe sign that I described earlier. In his hands, was a device that was as big as a cellphone by comparison. I had never seen anyone whom fits his description prior to my NDE. In that moment, I thought of him as a 'mystery man', and was literally able to feel his energy. He radiated such a positive vibe and a feeling of belonging. It felt as if I had seen him in a past spiritual realm at one time, or was going to encounter his presence. We never verbally spoke. We telepathically communicated with each other in my NDE. I could see into his soul, almost as if he was just as captivated by me, as I was him. I stared up at this tall man and my heart fluttered for the first time ever. There were visions of us riding on a bus together and laughing. These visions flashed before my eyes, just as my life review did, while on the left side. Nearby scenery revealed white birds in a lake, while the bus was in motion. He had complete adoration for me while holding this electronic device. A feeling of adoration and unadulterated shock ran through my system, as I stared intently at the glow around him. There were 2 buttons on this device. A red button on the left in which there were a few squiggly lines. However, the lines didn't seem to form any words. A blue button was on the right of this device, measuring significantly larger than the red button on the left. The words 'send back' were written in bold black letters just below the blue button. 

   My daughter and I had a conversation and she had told me that I needed to change. She and I discussed the changes that I needed to make. All of the changes had encompassed around what was shown to me in the life review. I needed  to change my aggression, and NOT to be so negative. My daughter forewarned me to stop cheating when I find love again. She reminded me to be honest, true,and sincere in my actions and not to be such a dominant female. She said 'stop being cold and mean Mommy.' I also received a telepathic message from God that reminded me to get baptized again. Telepathically, the message communicated was   'Go and find the rivers of belief.' Before I could be sent back, I was asked by my daughter if I would agree to making these changes. She said 'Mommy, if you say you will  change, we can send you back.' I had agreed to those changes by telling her 'Yes.' I also telepathically communicated with God  by mentally  responding 'Yes, I will commit to making changes.' The energy on the other side was so intense. Then I felt like there was  electricity running through my veins, at the Earthly level. There was a love so strong, with such a magnetic pull that it drew me  to the light more and more. Upon telepathic communication with the Divine, I felt immeasurable  positive energy engrained in my soul. A slight portion  of that energy remained with me during my journey back to Earth.

   Just before I was sent back, parts of Ozzy Osbourne's song, 'See You On The Other Side' was playing as I began waking from my NDE.  The exact 4 lines  were... 'But we'll be together carved in stone, carved in stone, carved in stone.' I distinctly remember my last thought being , I need to find this mystery man upon returning to Earth. Visions of us becoming romantic were not tangibly seen in my NDE, but only intuitively felt. I was able to 'feel' his embrace, without him actually embracing me. Just looking up at him, had me beyond the scope of captivated. A complete and utter feeling of warmth and love consumed my soul. In that moment, it was unlike anything I had ever felt. By comparison, it was a love stronger than death. I knew immediately that seeing him in my NDE was an indication of some sort. I was convinced that God was trying to tell and/or show me something by him being in my NDE. However, during the NDE, I couldn't figure out the entire message. I did get a feeling as if we were going to end up together romantically at some point. All that came to mind telepathically from God was, 'Go find him Tammy.' Visions of him in the aqua-ice colored shirt plus his overall physical appearance began to change. During the changing of his physical appearance and shirt colors, I felt a sense of loss within me. It felt almost as if I could sense him becoming ill, which would end our contact on Earth. 

   Suddenly, a  transformative vision of him came into play. He had changed from wearing an aqua-iced blue shirt to  wearing a white shirt, with a burgundy colored tie. I had briefly seen a quick camera like flash of myself in a wedding gown, standing beside him. We were standing at a bus stop that was adjacent to what resembled a court house building. However, this vision of him  had revealed a much younger physique. Although he was dressed in different attire, and a younger physique, he still felt like the same mystery man. Spiritually, it was as if the connection never died. His  'new' physique resembled darker eyes and a beard, with his height remaining the same. Perhaps maybe this was a sign of reincarnation, and that we would find each other again, no matter what? I truthfully do not know. What I do know, is the 'soul-feeling' was the same. All visions faded and I had entered reality. Reality meaning, I was literally able to feel my soul reuniting with my physical body. 

  At the Earthly level, I was feeling a sense of enlightenment and fully awakening at a different level. I woke up in the hospital and was literally sweating in the recovery room. My nightgown had disappeared and I complained to the nurses about the heat being so intense. I had asked, 'where is my purple nightgown'? The nurse told me, 'You took it off'. I said, 'I did?' She said, 'Yes ma'am and we tried putting a thinner cotton one on you too, and you fought us.' Needless to say, I was perfectly comfortable with my bare breasts feeling the softness of the hospital blanket. I kept repeating, 'The heat, it is so intense, it is so intense, IM Alive, IM Alive!' 

  I called my Soon-To-be-EX-Father-In-Law to give him an update hours later. I had discussed with him what I saw. He said in a very serious tone, 'It sounds like you had a Near Death Experience.' I was in a complete state of shock and denial. Confusion was very well accompanying the shock and denial. Over the phone, I described the man in my NDE to my Soon-To-be-EX-Father-In-Law. He was insistent that I had a Near Death Experience, and  had been given the opportunity to see into my future. I was beside myself, still being able to 'feel' this 'mystery man's' energy. This energy was so prominent, and couldn't be ignored. 

  Later that evening, I  snapped a few pictures of me, and made a few quick videos  with my cell phone. I had taken some paper and a pen with me in case I needed to write down any important surgery information. Hours later, I had wrote a brief outline of the visions I had seen. The next day, making a video before being  released from the hospital became a priority. I thought to myself, a video needs to be made, in the event we find our way to each other through fate. Without knowing his name, I referred to him as 'baby' in the video. Upon returning home, I prayed constantly to find this mystery man. I spent various evenings wondering who he was and questioning why I saw him? I eventually moved to a new apartment, by  a lake. The complex I moved to was in a bad area, yet I still had the desire to move there. However, something kept gnawing at me, indicating their was a deeper reason behind moving there.

  Nonetheless, moving there had sealed my fate. Fate had  led me to my NDE 'mystery man' (JOHN), just under 1 year later. We had met  on a bus, a few months after my NDE on April 6, 2016. I recognized him immediately and was in a state of shock, the morning he stepped on the bus. All of the scenery on the bus ride was exactly what was seen in my NDE. His shirt had the same squiggly lines and word globe signal that was seen in my NDE. We started out talking periodically on the bus, with just general everyday conversation. There was always such a bright glow around him, especially when he would wink at me. Around the August of 2016 timeframe, we formally introduced ourselves to each other by shaking hands. Just the touch of his hand made me weak in the knees. Energy surges ran through my body, leaving me rendered still. I went home and said to myself, 'This is without a doubt unbelievable. I have met the mystery man!' As I touched his hand, that same energy resurfaced itself from my NDE. The following month, we hugged on September 2. On that day, he was wearing the same exact colored aqua, iced-blue dress shirt, as in my NDE. We exchanged Email addresses and things began to take off at that point. I sent him the first Email on October 3, 2016, and was captivated where our conversation went. Ironically enough, he had typed in an Email, 'Looks like we just wrote our script for next Friday Night, well - the first scene of course.' His use of the word script made me think to myself that when the time is right, I will show you the video. All that ran through my mind, was the original outline I had wrote while in Chesapeake on July 24, 2015. In that moment, while conversing, it felt as if we had known each other for centuries. Time stood still, leaving my body to  shake with genuine warmth. Warmth that had permeated throughout every vein. Several months went by, we had our ups, and our downs. Overall, a connection so deep that cannot be defused. Having the ability to read each other's minds and feel each other is indescribable, even to this day.
