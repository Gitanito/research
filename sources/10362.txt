At first, I thought it was bad heartburn, but then the pain became unbearable. I knew I was having a heart attack and called 911.  The first call didn't go through and was just digital noise.  I called again and it rang.  A 911 operator answered and the first thing I did, in case I passed out, was give her my address. Then I explained that I was having a heart attack.  She asked a bunch of questions like ‘was I in a cold sweat?’ I answered, 'yes.'  ‘Did I have bad chest and arm pain?’ I answered, 'yes.'  She said it sounded like a heart attack and had me keep the telephone line open until the medics arrived. They arrive in 4 minutes.  I had gotten up to unlock the door so they could get in and then went back to the bed.  I was in extreme pain. The emergency medical technicians came in, gave me aspirin, and starting hooking up wires to my chest.  After about 5 minutes, my arms went numb and I was panicking.  I knew that was it. For some unknown reason, I jumped off the bed onto the carpet. I don't remember hitting the floor. 
 
 Then after what seemed like a few seconds, I was on the floor and surrounded by a green mist or fog in a real low light. I felt no pain.  The place, where I was, seemed so surreal and so pleasant. I was very conscious but seemed to be in another place. I couldn't see anyone, no paramedics or other people.  Then I realized that I was dead and I said aloud, 'I'm dead.' I heard a very pleasant woman's voice say 'Yes,' but I didn't see her. It seemed like I was there for at least 20 minutes, but after they revived me I guess my heart only stopped for about 15 seconds.  It was as if time was stretched out where I was or maybe it just seemed like a long time to me. I seemed to be planted on the floor.  I could move from the waist up with ease but my legs seemed very heavy and I couldn't move.  My body was different, so it must have been my spirit body.  I could feel everything but had no sensation of pain; it was such a pleasant feeling but very surreal. I wasn't afraid at all and almost didn't want to leave, but I felt like it wasn't my time and wanted to go back to my body. I reached out my arm and after a little while, went into a dream state.  I was no longer conscious but was asleep dreaming. I think this is when the paramedics must have revived me. 
 
 I woke up to a large group of medics all around me, one told me, 'Sir, you just had a heart attack and your heart stopped.' I sat there for a minute and asked them, 'My heart stopped?' They said, 'Yes.' The only thing I could think of to say was, 'Holy crap!' Everyone seemed quite upset since they had just seen me die. I didn't say anything about the experience because I was still trying to process what had just happened to me. I will never forget it. It was a bad and good thing that I went through.  It was bad that I had a heart attack but good that I know the answer to a question humanity had wondered about forever - Does our consciousness go on after our body dies.  The answer is 100% yes, it does.

  Experience Description 7853  					</p>  					I was at home. I felt like I had a bad case of heartburn, but it seemed more painful than any heartburn I had ever had before. The heartburn finally stopped and I went to bed for about four hours. When I woke up, the pain in my chest returned but was much worse than before.  My shoulder hurt, my arms where going numb, and I was in a cold sweat. I called 911 and they arrived after about five minutes.  I went from sitting on the bed to collapsing on the floor. I woke up and everything was very dark. I wasn't in any pain but felt very heavy.  My body looked different and shapeless. I felt as though I had slowly come out of my body.  I had this extreme feeling of heaviness; I wasn't scared, it was more of a pleasant feeling. Then a hand reached out to take mine so I reached out for it.  Then I fell into a pleasant dream-state that felt as though I had been sleeping for like a half hour. All off a sudden, I woke up on the bed with paramedics all around me.  I felt upset because I was having such a pleasant dream and they had awakened me.  Then one of them said, 'Sir, you have just had a heart attack.  Your heart stopped for 15 seconds and we had to do CPR and shock you.' It felt like I had a pleasant nap for like a half hour. My main artery was blocked and they put two stents in my heart at the hospital. They kept me in the hospital for a week. I have some heart damage but I'm alive, thanks to the paramedics. After deep thought about this experience, I feel that spirits were there to take me to the afterlife as the paramedics were trying to bring me back.
