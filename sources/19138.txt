good question she asked in our lifetime
we would see an acknowledgment of an
extraterrestrial presence ironically
what I just said a moment ago I think we
already have
I think the mass public already think
that we&#39;re not alone now so you have to
think qualify
when will the elites acknowledge it
publicly privately a lot of the elites
that I&#39;ve been able to meet with will
acknowledge it oh yes but then when you
say will you say that publicly I&#39;ll nose
into my career whether they&#39;re a
professor or governmental person or
senator no one wants to be senator
Moonbeam and ridiculed so I think that
the problem really is defining
disclosure a lot of people saying when
is disclosure going to happen I said
we&#39;ve done it already when I started the
project there was only about 25 percent
of the public thought this was real now
it&#39;s 50 60 % but in terms of if you&#39;re
metric is the conventional wisdom
mainstream media mainstream academia
mainstream governmental entities your
guess is as good as mine and I&#39;m not
holding my breath
however nor should we we can probe we
can go forward with this information
independent of that and that is the
beauty of the Internet by the way
because you know I can do a program and
reach a million two million five million
people whereas the ratings for you know
Piers Morgan on CNN it&#39;s a few hundred
thousand which is why they had to remove
him but or Larry King I&#39;m when I was
only a king show by the way
interestingly when the media tell you
well we don&#39;t cover this those there&#39;s
not public interest after pornography
this is the number one subject
interest on the Internet it&#39;s huge
moreover when I when I was on I have a
letter here from the producer for Larry
King Live on the show I was on you know
19 20 years ago and she said this was
the most watched Larry King special
we&#39;ve ever had so the metrics of ancient
aliens for the history of the most
lucrative and best franchise so it isn&#39;t
because the media wouldn&#39;t get numbers
or the media wouldn&#39;t get a lucrative
advertising if they covered this it&#39;s
because their corporate bosses won&#39;t let
them now am i speculating now let me
tell you what happened with the
executive producer of ABC primetime live
in 20/20 back years ago after the
disclosure project was launched and I&#39;m
not gonna mention his name here but he&#39;s
a very nice guy from New York he had
been a producer for Mike Wallace at 60
minutes and won an Emmy and then went to
New York with ABC News and was the
executive producer for those two news
magazines in primetime live in 2020 and
he came out to our farm in Virginia and
I gave him 35 digital hours of military
top-secret testimony all the documents
he wanted and all the information he
wanted he says either this is all the
biggest hoax I&#39;ve ever seen or is the
biggest story of the 20th century I said
I think you know it&#39;s the latter he says
yeah it really is amazing so he went
back to New York and then invited me up
there and I saw old Sam Donaldson and
some other people and then I got a phone
call now before all this happened I told
him I said you know I don&#39;t think ABC is
gonna let you do this what he wanted to
do is a series of news magazines like
town hall with you know a lot of these
military and and other people there with
them discussing on ABC prime time and in
2020 what they knew about this and
really blow the lid off this and then
make a call for more to come public so I
so great let&#39;s do it but I don&#39;t think
they will let you and he says oh no I&#39;m
the executive producer of this show
a bit of hubris okay and I said I just
smiled and I said well let me know how I
can help a couple weeks later gives me a
call he says dr. Greer they won&#39;t let me
do this program I said oh who are they
and he said dr. Greer you know who they
are and that was it
now we&#39;ve stayed in touch periodically
since same thing with the movie industry
Hollywood there was a very big producer
multibillion-dollar guy who&#39;s done
multi-billion dollars in gross revenues
for films and he sent someone to the
1997 congressional briefings we did that
were closed here at the Westin Hotel in
Georgetown where we had all these
military the first sort of wave of these
military witnesses who are willing to do
this privately and there were members of
this you know the head of the chairman
of the Government Reform and oversight
committee Dan Burton who issued a
thousand subpoenas on the Monica
Lewinsky case was there all these people
were there White House people were there
vice-president of course some of his
people and the Pentagon folks and so he
sent this producer in Hollywood sent his
senior person to attend just where
nobody would know who she was and it
blew her mind she went back and she said
this is the real x-files without the
nonsense
so this producer flew me out there you
know the whole Hollywood two-step
limousines the whole bit flies out there
were meeting at 20th Century Fox in his
amazing office he has a conference room
full of people of writers who&#39;ve done
all these big oscar-winning movies and
Emmy and shows and he says I have a 60
million dollar discretionary budget with
Fox to make any film I want to make and
I want to make this one I said I&#39;m not
sure they will let you he says oh of
course they will I&#39;m many told me who he
was again I said wonderful glad to hear
it well put put it together and I&#39;ll
cooperate in every way I can all I want
to do is get the information out I want
to read sent
I&#39;ll give you out but you know you can
just pick my brain I&#39;ll give you all the
Dada all you want and
a couple weeks later he calls and says
well dr. Greer Fox won&#39;t let me do this
movie I said I thought you said you had
complete control over this $60,000,000
not he says not for this it has to be a
fiction I said well I mean Close
Encounters of the Third Kind was a
docudrama that was fiction but it was
mostly based on true events by the way
so it&#39;s Steven Spielberg did and I
actually went I had dinner with one of
his family members and we talked about
that this Phil Berg said so the reality
is that people think that Hollywood can
do whatever it wants the big media can
do whatever it wants a corporation in
Silicon Valley that might discover this
widget that will do this in it can do
whatever it wants what has happened to
our freedoms and this is I mean I know
this sounds very kind of libertarian or
Jeffersonian but we have really lost
anything resembling a free society on
fundamental issues and that is should be
a great concern I don&#39;t care if you&#39;re a
Republican Democrat left-right socialist
whatever you are which you know I don&#39;t
subscribe to any of the political
divisions because really this issue
transcends all of them there have been
people who are Democrats who love what
we&#39;re doing there people who Republicans
who love what we&#39;re doing and vice versa
who don&#39;t like it depend on where their
interests lie and how many checks
they&#39;re collecting from the special
interests which is a lot I mean they you
know oil industry and coal industry
utilities they spread a lot of money
around it&#39;s like big farm how many how
much it health care reform and you get
when you have a multibillion-dollar
entity that&#39;s kind of bribing all the
senators and congressmen and
what-have-you so that but this is is
that a to to a much larger degree than
even even the pharmaceutical industry
much larger and I think we have to
figure out a way to say look we&#39;re going
to continue with acknowledging the et
presence and doing disclosure and most
importantly I don&#39;t to leave this out of
this it really doesn&#39;t matter if we have
free energy if we go to interstellar war
we were talking about this at the break
so we need to have people
who put out to the public a paradigm for
contact that&#39;s peaceful that is
multilateral that isn&#39;t polluted with
all the usual fear-mongering and
stereotypes of all things scary and
alien because we need to be able to say
if we&#39;re already in an interstellar
moment when we are even if it&#39;s not
acknowledged fully who&#39;s taking care of
that relationship not secretary Kerry at
the State Department not the UN
officials I&#39;ve met not the people in
foreign ministries I&#39;ve briefed it is
not being tasked to any of them so we
the people need to come together and do
that
it&#39;s like citizens diplomacy but on an
interplanetary level and that&#39;s really
why I formed the the whole Close
Encounters of the fifth kind initiative
which now has an app that for a training
apps that you can get on your smartphone
but also now this networking app so you
can plug into anyone in the community
you want to plug into that&#39;s near you
you may have to travel an hour if you
live in the remote area of Montana but
you know you can do that and I think
it&#39;s very important for two reasons one
it shows a face of humanity to these
extraterrestrial civilizations that
isn&#39;t just militaristic and avaricious
greedy but it also creates its own as
Rupert Sheldrake talks about
morphogenetic field where in
consciousness once it&#39;s like the
hundredth monkey effect once a certain
number of people start doing something
it begins to propagate non-locally and
has an effect that is beyond just a
linear one person to another but
actually shifts the great unconscious if
you will and that is why it&#39;s so
important for people to do that so we
move our civilization in the direction
of universal peace and not
interplanetary war you know because
Douglas MacArthur in his last talk and
up here in Congressional to the Congress
said World War 3 will be interplanetary
Reagan stood up in front of the UN and
said wouldn&#39;t it be easier to unite the
world if we had a common alien threat to
United
Clinton recently with Jimmy Fallon made
a similar sort of misguided statement so
you know there is this tendency that you
we want to take this issue and instead
of having another race to fight or
economic system to fight or religion to
fight
let&#39;s find another planet to fight
hallelujah instead of having World Peace
that is true world peace let&#39;s unite the
world in interplanetary conflict well
this is not going forward my friends
this is a big step backwards so we need
calmer heads and more spiritually minded
people to get involved in this so that
our civilization doesn&#39;t get tricked
into a sort of cosmic 9/11 or a cosmic
gulf of tonkin
you know the Gulf of Tonkin incident
when it&#39;s been substantially proven we
basically exaggerated and staged these
attacks on our ships in the Gulf of
Tonkin so that Congress in the Johnson
administration would be stampeded and to
expand in the Vietnam War and that is
not a myth that actually has happened it
was proven that occur so you know we
have to be careful because the public
are very easily affected by these sort
of misguided patriotism of us versus
them like the movie Independence Day
goes kick alien butt and Will Smith you
know and this is the worst outcome that
is that&#39;s actually a worse outcome than
if we have these new technologies and
the world gets off oil and becomes
United but then we get maneuvered by
these makaveli and manipulators in the
intelligence community into an
interplanetary conflict and and I think
that that&#39;s why there are three big
projects that I&#39;ve been focused on the
original one is the Center for the Study
of extraterrestrial intelligence whose
motto is one universe one people because
on the basis of just sentient conscious
mind the deep spiritual aspect of
ourselves we&#39;re all one being but that
led to the disclosure project hosted a
near landing event and sighting that
happened in Gulf Breeze and Pensacola in
the 90s and now we&#39;re at this point of
working on the technology
so those three compose
it&#39;s a really key to what we want to
achieve but the heart of it is really
contact peaceful contact with citizen
