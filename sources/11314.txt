It was as if I was some kind of energy, and I was flying away from earth. Then it seemed as if I was flying away from the solar system. Then I started flying away faster and I saw bunches of stars as if they were galaxies flying away from me. Then they seemed to be bunching together into huge packs as if they were separate universes or something like that. It was as if there was a force or energy out there way bigger than anything we know, and I had an enormous sense of understanding the meaning of life, that's when I seemed to shoot back at a phenomenal speed! I then came round, realized I had been in a coma, and must have died.

It is very frustrating because I cannot pinpoint my understanding. As it was happening, I remember feeling very excited and thinking to myself 'So that's why we are here!' And it was so real, but my understanding was not explained to me. Due to this experience, my view on life after death goes somewhere way beyond planet earth and our energy possibly passes to another dimension or a different universe. I would like to hear if anybody else has experienced this because I have not heard of this NDE before. I have heard of people seeing earth from space but nothing this extreme.
