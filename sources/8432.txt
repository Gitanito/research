  Physician  Views and Response to Patients' Near-Death Experience (NDE):
  A Survey
  Dr. Jeff, M.D.
    Judith Boss  , Ph.D.

   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   This study is a survey of the  medical staff of a single large institution regarding physician views and  responses to patients' near-death experience (NDE).&nbsp;   A survey of this type has not been previously reported.&nbsp;   An Internet survey form was developed containing three demographic  questions and 18 questions pertinent to NDE (www.rooj.com/survey.htm).&nbsp;   Notice of this voluntary survey was e-mailed to the attention of  approximately 550 physicians and chiropractors on the faculty of Brown  University School of Medicine (    Providence  ,   Rhode Island  ,   U.S.A.    ) on   October 2, 2001  .&nbsp;  A total of 18 responded to the  survey.&nbsp;  Of these 18, 17 were  physicians and one was a chiropractor.&nbsp;  The  17 physicians responding represented approximately 3% of all physicians  contacted.&nbsp;  The very low percentage  of physician response is not unusual among surveys of this type.&nbsp;   Survey questions generally allowed both multiple-choice and narrative  responses as appropriate.&nbsp;  The survey  multiple-choice questions' default answers were set to 'No response' to  minimize false positive and false negative responses.&nbsp;   A portion of the final results of this survey is presented.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   It must be  emphasized that the results of this study cannot be considered representative of  the attitudes of physicians in general regarding NDE.&nbsp;   A very low percentage of physicians contacted completed the survey.&nbsp;   Those responding almost certainly had significantly different attitudes  regarding NDE than physicians in general.&nbsp;  The  survey involved only a single institution with a medical school environment that  may not represent attitudes of physicians outside an academic environment.&nbsp;   Physicians practicing in other areas of the country or representing a  different mix of medical specialties may have different attitudes toward NDE.&nbsp;   Additionally, the Internet survey form methodology may be unfamiliar to  some physicians potentially biasing the results.&nbsp;   It also must be emphasized that any generalizing statements presented  herein must be considered highly tentative and unproven.&nbsp;   Certainly more research regarding physician attitudes toward NDE is  needed.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   In spite of  the aforementioned significant study limitations, the results are interesting.&nbsp;   None of the respondents personally experienced a NDE.&nbsp;   A Gallup Poll in 1992 led to an estimate that 13 million adult Americans  may have experienced a NDE, suggesting approximately 4% of the     United States     adult population may have a personal history of NDE.&nbsp;   Given this prevalence of NDE, it is somewhat surprising that out of  approximately 550 physicians surveyed, none responded with a history of personal  NDE.&nbsp;  We would have expected at least  some physicians to be NDErs, and thus more likely to respond to a survey  regarding NDE.&nbsp;  This raises the  possibility that physicians might have a lower prevalence of NDE than the     United States     adult population as a whole.&nbsp;  It is  also possible physician NDErs may have less interest in sharing and interacting  with others regarding the experience than non-physician NDErs.&nbsp;   Another possibility is that the prevalence of NDE is lower than was  estimated by the aforementioned Gallup Poll.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Those responding had  been practicing an average of 20 years following completion of medical school  suggesting they had considerable medical practice experience.&nbsp;   When asked 'Have you ever talked to any patient as part of your  professional practice who told you about his/her NDE?' responses were Yes: 6  (33%), No: 11 (61%) and Uncertain: 1 (6%).&nbsp;  It  is notable that even in this select group, only a minority of physicians has  encountered patients who shared their NDEs.&nbsp;   This suggests the great majority of physicians in general may not have  heard of NDE from their patients' personal experience.&nbsp;   When asked both 'How comfortable was the patient(s) in sharing their  NDE with you?' and 'How comfortable you were discussing the NDE with the  patient(s)?', both questions had 6 responses of 'Very comfortable' and 12  responses of 'No comment'.&nbsp;  The  consistent high level of comfort in sharing NDE experiences among both the  physicians and patients is somewhat surprising.&nbsp;   We suspect this level of comfort in both sharing and listening to the NDE  experience occurs in a small percentage of NDErs and physicians.&nbsp;

In  our NDE research, we have encountered a number of NDErs who describe  unsatisfactory or unpleasant experiences when they tried to share their NDE with  their physicians.&nbsp;  It is likely the  six survey respondents who were very comfortable hearing about the NDE both knew  about and respected NDE prior to hearing about their patients' NDEs.&nbsp;   One respondent wrote 'I feel at ease discussing these experiences, and  actually try to help the patient use the experience to help learn to experience  greater peace in his or her life.'&nbsp;  If  there were a higher level of comfort in both sharing and listening to NDEs,  perhaps far more NDEs would be shared.&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   When asked, 'Which of the  following best describes your view of NDE (please check or uncheck all that  apply).&nbsp; NDEs are:' the responses were:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   To the question 'Have you  discussed NDE with other physician(s) at any time under any circumstances?'  responses were: Yes: 6 (33%) and No: 12 (67%).&nbsp;   Even in this select group of respondents with an average of 20 years of  medical practice, NDE is clearly an uncommon topic of informal discussion.&nbsp;   This suggests physicians in general are unlikely to have discussed NDE at  any time with other physicians.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;               We suspect this is a more  accurate representation of general physician attitude toward NDE than the  previously noted respondents' personal views of NDE.&nbsp;               Differences in responses between the preceding two tables are further  evidence that the respondents' attitudes are not typical of the attitudes of  physicians in general toward NDE.&nbsp;  The  infrequency that physicians discuss NDE among themselves must be borne in mind  in considering responses to this question. The most common expected view of  other physicians is that NDE is 'Caused  by physiological changes brought on by extreme stress' (8), followed by the  response of 'Unknown' (7) and 'Hallucinations' (5).&nbsp;               The choices suggesting NDE is a valid spiritual experience are uncommonly  selected with responses of&nbsp;  'An  experience of a higher dimension/reality' (3) and 'A spiritual encounter  with a divine force' (2) selected infrequently.&nbsp;               It is interesting to note that no respondent selected the option of  'Suggestive of mental disorder' as their own view or expected other  physicians' view of NDE.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;               When asked,  'Should information on NDEs be part of the education of medical&nbsp;students  and physicians?' responses were: Yes: 7 (39%), No: 5 (28%) and Uncertain: 6  (33%).&nbsp;  When asked about a variety of  methods of teaching medical students, the top three choices were: 'Optional  reading' (7), 'NDE experiencers personally sharing their account' (6) and  'Seminars' (5).&nbsp;  Any efforts to  teach NDE in a medical school may be resisted by those doubting the validity of  NDE, as expressed by one respondent who wrote 'That anyone supposes there is a  fragment of scientific information to be gained by 'studying' NDE is  disturbing, and symptomatic of the pseudoscience that infests the study of  man's mind.'

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;               There is some  interest in NDE research among the respondents.&nbsp;               When asked, 'Would you be interested in participation in NDE research  projects?' responses were: Yes: 4 (22%), No: 11 (61%), Uncertain: 2 (11%) and  No response: 1 (6%).&nbsp;  One respondent  wrote 'NDEs are only one form of spiritual or 'higher power' experiences  that patients have that would be useful to study.&nbsp;               Events/experiences related to pre-diagnosis, diagnosis, treatment,  relapses, etc. would all be valuable to study.'&nbsp;               It is noteworthy that four respondents (22%) expressed an interest in  participating in NDE research projects.&nbsp;  This  suggests a large number of physicians nationwide may have an interest in NDE to  the degree they would be interested in participating in NDE research.&nbsp;               If a mechanism could be found to identify and contact physicians with  such an interest, NDE research might be greatly expanded.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;               One study  co-investigator (Dr. Jeff, M.D.) is a physician and NDE researcher.&nbsp;               Dr. Jeff's commentary is as follows:&nbsp;               At least three physicians have submitted their experience to my www.nderf.org  (Near Death Experience Research Foundation) web site.&nbsp;               All of them were greatly affected by the experience, and had no doubts  about its validity and significance.&nbsp;  I  think most physicians (as with other professionals) are quite busy with their  professional as well as personal lives, and have less exposure to media  presentations about NDE than the general public.&nbsp;               Probably the great majority of physicians have not encountered NDE  experiences shared by their patients and have not discussed NDE with other  physicians.&nbsp;  Thus, physicians in  general probably have little exposure to NDE and little factual information to  make an informed decision about its validity.&nbsp;               IANDS is aware of the need to present physicians and medical students  with factual information regarding NDE and is actively pursuing this goal.

If  any readers have any comments regarding this survey and study, or have ideas on  how this survey could be provided to other medical staff groups, please e-mail  us at   (Dr. Jeff, M.D.)  or  JUDITHB@prodigy.net  (               Judith Boss               , Ph.D.).&nbsp;               We are quite interested in conducting this survey at other medical  schools or with other large physician groups.&nbsp;               If anyone would be able to assist us in any way in this endeavor, please  let us know.                                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;               I thank Bruce Greyson, M.D. who  reviewed the survey and provided helpful comments.&nbsp;               Thanks also to Jody Long for her editorial assistance.
