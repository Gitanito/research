The Book Of
Forbidden Knowledge
DIVINATION, OR HOW TO OBTAIN KNOWLEDGE
OF FUTURE EVENTS
Any ];)erson fasting on midsummer
eve, and sitting on the church porch,
will, at midnight, see the spirits of
the persons of that parish, who will
die that year, come and knoek at the
church-doc~ in the order and sueces-
sion in which they will die. One of
those watchers, there being several in
company, fell into a profound sleep,
so that he could not be waked; whilst
in this state his ghost was s een by the
rest of his companions knocking at the
church door. Any unmarried woman
fasting on midsummer eve, and at mid-
night laying a clean cloth, with bread,
cheese and ale, and sitting down as if
going to eat, the street door b e ing left
open, the person whom she is after-
ward to marry will come into the room,
and drink to her by bowing, and after-
ward filling th<l glass, will leave it on
the table, and making another bow, re-
tire. On St. Agnes' night, the 21st of
January, take a row of pins, and pull
out every one, one after another, say-
ing a paternoster, on sticking a pin in
your sleeve, and you will dream of him
you shall marry. Another method to
see a future spouse in a dream; the
party inquiring must lie in a different
country from that in which he com-
monly resides, and, on going to bed,
must knit the left garter about the
right legged stocking, letting the oth-
er garter and stocking alone; and as
you rehearse the following verses, at
every comma knit a knot:
This knot I knit,
To know a thing I know not yet,
That I may see
The man that shall my husband be,
How he goes and what he wears,
. And what he does all days and years.
Accordingly, in a dream he will ap-
pear with the insignia of his trade or
profession. Another performed by
charming the moon, thus: At the first
appearance of the new moon, immedi-
ately after the new year's day, go out
in the evening and stand over the
spears of a gate or stile, and, looking
on the moon, repeat the following
lines:
All hail to thee, moon; all hail to
thee,
I prithee, good moon, reveal to me
'!'his night who my husband must be.
The party will then dream of their
future husband. A slice of the bride-
eake, thrice thrown through the wed-
rling ring, and laid under the head of
an unmarried woman will make them
dream of their future husband. The
same is practiced in the north with a
piece of the groaning cheese.
HOW TO RECEIVE ORACLES
BY DREAMS
He who would. receive true dreams,
should keep a pure, undisturbed, and
imaginative spirit, and so compose it
that it may be made worthy of knowl-
edge and government by the mind; for
such a spirit is most fit for prophesy-
ing, anrl is a most clear glass of a!l
things. When, therefore, we are sound
in body, not disturbed in mind, our in-
tellect not made dull by h eavy meals
and strong drink, not sad through pov-
erty, not provoked through lust, not
incited by any vice, not stirred up by
wrath or anger, not being irreligiously
and profanely inclined, not given to
levity nor lost in drunkenness, but,
ehastely going to bed, fall asleep, then
our pure and divine soul being free
from all the evils above recited, and
separated from all hurtful thoughts-
and now freed, by dreaming-is en-
dowed with this divine spirit as an in-
strument, and doth receive those beams
and representations which are darted
down, as it were, and shine forth from
the divine Mind into itself, in a deify-
ing glass.
BOOK OF FORBIDDEN KNOWLEDGE
There are !our kinds of true dreams,
viz., the first, matutine, i.e., between
eleeping and waking; the second, that
which one sees concerning another; the
third, that whose interpretation is
shown to the same dreamer in the
nocturn.al vision; and, lastly, that
which is related to the same dreamer
in the nocturnal vision. But natural
things and their own co-mixtures do
likewise belong unto wise men, and we
often use such to receive oracles from
a spirit by a dream, which are neither
by perfumes, unctions, meats, drinks,
rings, seals, etc.
Now those who are desirous to re-
ceive oracles through a dream, let them
make themselves a ring of the Sun or
Saturn for this purpos e. There are
likewise images of dreams, which, be-
ing put under the hea d when going to
eleep, doth effectually give true dreams
of whatever the mind hath before de-
termined or consulted upon, the prac-
tice of which is as follows:
Thou shalt make an image of the
~un, the figure whereof must be a man
eleeping upon the bosom of an angel;
which thou shalt make when Leo as-
cends, the Sun being in the ninth house
in Aries; then you must write upon the
tl.gure the name of the effect desired,
and in the hand of the angel the name
and character of the intelligence of the
Sun, which is Michael.
Let the same image be made in Virgo
ascending-Mercury being fortunate in
Aries in the ninth, or Gemini ascend-
ing, Mercury being fortunte in the
ninth house in Aquarius-and let him
be received by Saturn with a fortunate
aspect, and let the name of the spirit
(which is Raphael) be written upon it.
Let the same likewise be made-Libra
ascending, Venus being received from
Mercury in Gemini In the ninth house
-and write upon it the name of the
angel of Venus (which is Anael). Again
you may make the same image·-
Aquarius ascending, Saturn fortunate-
ly possessing the ninth in his exalta-
tion, which is Libra-and let there be
written upon it the name of the angel
of Saturn (which is Cassia!). The same
may be made with Cancer ascending
the Moon being received by Jupiter and
Venus in Pisces, and being fortunately
placed in the ninth house-and write
upon it the spirit of the Moon (which
is Gabriel).
There are likewise made rings of
dreams of wonderful efficacy, and there
are rings of the Sun and Saturn-and
the constellation of them is, when the
Sun or Saturn ascend in their exalta-
tion in the ninth, and when the Moon
Is joined to Saturn in the ninth, and In
that sign which was the ninth house of
the nativity, and write and engrave
upon the rings the name of the spirit
of the Sun or Saturn, and by these
rules you may know how and by what
means to constitute more of yourself.
But know this, that such images
work nothing (as they are simply
images), except they are vivified by -
spiritual and celestial virtue, and
chiefly by the ardent desire and firm
intent of the soul of the operator. But
who can give a soul to an image, or
make a stone, or metal, or clay, or
wood, or wax, or paper, to live? Cer-
tainly no man whatever, for this ar-
canum Cloth not enter into an artist of
a stiff neck. He only hath it who tran-
s cends the progress of angels, and
comes to the very Arch type Himself.
The tables of numbers lik ewise confer
to the receiving of oracles, being duly
formed under their own constellations.
Therefore, he who is desirous of re-
ceiving true oracles by dreams, let him
abstain from supper, from drink, and
be otherwise well disposed, so his brain
will be free from turbulent vapors; let
him also have his bed-chamber fair and
clean, exorcised and cousecrated; then
let him perfume the same with some
convenient fumigation, and let him
anoint his t emples with some unguent
efficacious hereunto, and put a ring of
dreams upon his finger; then let him
take one of the images we have spoken
of, and place the same under his head;
then let him address himself to sleep,
meditating upon that thing which he
desires to know. So shall he receive a
most certain and undoubted oracle by
a dream when the Moon goes through
the sign of the ninth revolution of his
nativity, and she is in the ninth .sign
from the sign of perfection.
This is the way whereby we may ob-
tain all sciences and arts whatsoever,
whether astrology, occult philosophy,
physic, etc., or else suddenly and per-
fectly with a true illumination of our
intellect, although all inferior familiar
spirits whatsoever conduce to this ef-
fect, and sometimes also evil spirits
sensibly inform us, intrinsically and
extrinsically.
DREAMS, TOKENS, AND IN-
SIGHTS INTO FUTURITY
THE RING AND THE OLIVE BRANCH
Buy a ring; it matters not it being
gold, so as it has the semblance of a
wedding ring; and it is best to try this
charm on your own birthday. Pay for
your ring with some small bill, for
whatever change you receive you must
give it to the first beggar you meet in
the street; and, if no one asks alms of
you, give it to some poor person-for
you need not, alas! go far bef9re you
find one to whom your charity will be
acceptable; carefully note what they
say in return, such as "God bless you,"
or wishing you luck and prosperity, as
is usual. When you get home, write it
down on a sheet of paper, at each of
four corners, and, in the middle, put
the two first letters of your nam~,
your age, and the letters of the planets
then reigning as morning and evening
stars, get a branch of olive and !aston
BOOK OF FORBIDDEN KNOWLEDGE a
the ring on the stalk with a string of
thread which has been steeped all day
in a mixture of honey and vinegar, or
any compoeition of opposite qualities,
very sweet and very sour; cover your
ring and stalk with the written paper,
carefully wrapped round and round;
wear it in your bosom till the ninth
hour of 'the night; then repair to the
next church-yard and bury the charm
in the grave of a young man who died
unmarried; and, while you are so doing
repeat the letters of your own Chris-
tian name three times backwards, re-
turn home, and keep as silent as pos-
sible till you go to bed, which must
be done before eleven; put a light in
your chimney, or some eafe place, and,
before midnight, or just about that
time, your husband that is to be will
present himself at the foot of the bed,
but will presently disappear. If you
are not to marry, none will come, and,
in that case, if you dream before morn-
ing of children, it shows that you will
have them unmarried; and if you
dream of crowds of men, beware of
prostitution.
THE WITCH'S CHAIN
Let three young women join together
in making a long chain-about a yard
will do-of Christmas juniper and mis-
tletoe berries, and, at the end of every
link, put an oak acorn. Exactly before
midnight let them assemble in a room
by themselves, where no one can dis-
turb them; leave a window open, and
take the l<ey out of the keyhole and
hang it over the chimney-piece; have
a good fire, and place in the midst of
it a long, thinnish log of wood, well
sprinkled with oil, salt, and fresh
mould; then wrap the chain round it,
each maiden having an equal share in
the business; then sit down, and on
your left knee let each fair one have
a prayer-book opened at the matri-
monial service. Just as the last acorn
is burned, the future husband will
cross the room; each one will see her
own proper spouse, but he will be in-
visible to the rest of the wakeful vir-
gins. Those that are not be wed will
see a coffin, or some mis-shapen form,
cross the room; go to bed instantly,
and you will all have remarkable
dreams. This must be done either on
a Wednesday or Friday night, but no
other.
LOVE'S CORDIAL
(To be tried the third night of a new
moon.)
Take brandy, rum, gin, wine, and the
oil of amber, of each a teaspoonful;
a tablespoonful of cream, and three of
spring water; drink it as you get into
bed. Repeat:
This mixture of love I take for my
potion,
That I of my destiny may have a
notion;
Cupid befriend me, new moon be
kind,
And show unto me that fate that's
designed.
You will dream of drink, and, ac-
cording to the quality or manner of it
being presented, you may tell the con-
dition to which you will rise or fall by
marriage. Water is poverty; and if
you dream of a drunken man, it is omi-
nous that you will have a drunken
mate. If you dream of drinking too
much you will fall, at a future period,
into that sad error yourself, without
great care; and what is a worse sight
than an inebriated female? She cannot
guard her own honor, ruins her own
and family's substance, and often
clothes herself with rags. Trouble is
often used as an excuse for this vicious
habit; but it gives more trouble than
it takes away.
LOVE LETTERS
On receiving a love letter that has
any particular declaration in it, lay it
wide open; then fold it in nine folda,
pin it next your heart, and thus wear
it till bed-time; then place it in your
left-hand glove, and lay it under your
head. If you dream of gold, diamonds,
or any costly gems, your lover Is true,
and means what he says; if of white
linen, you will lose him by death; and
if of flowers, he will prove false. If
you dream of his saluting you, he is,
at present, false, and means not what
he professes, but only to draw you into
a snare.
MAGIC ROSE
Gather your rose on the 27th of
June; let it be full blown, and as
bright a red as you can get; pluck it
between the hours of three and four in
the morning, taking care to have no
witness of the transaction; convey it
to your chamber, and hold it over a
chaffing dish or any convenient utensil
for the purpose, in which there is char-
coal and sulphur or brimstone; hold
your rose over the smoke about five
minutes, and you will see It have a
wonderful effect on the flower. Before
the rose gets the least cool, clap it in
a sheet of writing paper, on which is
written your own name and that of
the young man you love best; also the
date of the year and the name of the
morning star that has the ascendency
at that time; fold it up and seal it
neatly with three separate seals, then
run and bury the parcel at the foot of
the tree from which you gathered the
flower; here let it remain untouched
till the 6th of July; take it up at mid-
night, go to bed and place It under
your pillow, and you will have a singu-
lar and most eventful dream before
morning, or, at least, before your usual
time of rising. You may keep the
rose under your head three nights
without spoiling the charm; when you
BOOK OF FORBIDDEN KNOWLEDGE
are done with the rose and paper be
sure to burn them.
LUCKY AND UNLUCKY
DAYS, ETC.
LIST OF UNLUCKY DAYS
Which, to those persons being males
born on them, will generally prove un-
fortunate:
January 3, 4.
February 6, 7, 12, 13, 19, 20.
March 5, 6, 12, 13.
May 12, 13, 20, 21, 26, 27.
June 1, 2, 9, 10, 16, 17, 22, 23, 24.
July 3, 4, 10, 11, 16, 17, 18.
October 3, 4, 9, 10, 11, 16, 17, 31.
November 1, 3.
Almost all persons (being of the
male sex) that are born on the days
included in the foregoing table, will,
in a greater or less de~ree suffer, not
only by pecuniary ~mbarra ss ment and
losses of property, but will also ex-
perience great distress and anxiety of
mind, much dissatisfaction, dissension,
and unhappiness in their family affairs,
much disaffection to each other among
the married ones, (indeed few of them
can ever be happy in the married
state), trouble about their children,
daughters forming unfortunate attach-
ments, and a variety of untoward
events of other description which our
limits do not allow us to particular-
ize. The influence of these days are
of a quality and tendency calculated to
excite in the minds of persons born on
them, an extraordinary itch for specu-
lation, to make changes in their af-
fairs, commence new undertakings of
various kinds, but all of them will tend
nearly to one point-loss of property
and pecuniary embarrassments. Such
persons .who embark their capital on
credit in new concerns or engagements
will be likely to r~ceive checks or in-
terruptions to the progress of their
schemes or undertakings. Those who
enter into engagements intended to be
permanent, whether purchases, leases,
partnerships, or, in short, any other
speculation of a description which can-
not readily be transferred, or got rid
of will dearly repent their bargains.
They will find their affairs from time
to time much interrupted and agitated,
and experience many disappointments
in money matters, trouble through
bills, and have need of all their activity
and address to prop their declining
credit. Indeed, almost all engagements
and affairs that are entered upon by
persons born on any of these days will
receive some sort of check or obstruc-
tion. The greater number of those
persons born on these days will be
subject to weakness or sprains in the
knees and ankles, also diseases and
hurts in the legs.
LIST OF UNLUCKY DAYS
Which to those persons (being fe-
males) born on them will generally
prove unfortunate:
January 5, 6, 13, 14, 20, and 21.
February 2, 3, 9, 10, 16, 17, 22, and 23.
March 1, 2, 8, 9, 16, 17, 28, and 29.
April 24 and 26.
May 1, 2, 9, 17, 22, 29, and 30.
June 5, 6, 12, 13, 18, and 19.
July 3 and 4.
September 9 and 16.
October 20 and 27.
November 9, 10, 21, 29, and SO.
D ecember 6, 14, and 21.
We particularly advise all females
born on ·these days to be extremely
cautious of placing their affections too
hastily, as they will be :subject to dis-
pointments and vexations m that re-
spect. It will be better for them (in
those matters) to be guided by the ad-
vice of their friends, rather than by
their own feeling, they will be less
fortunate in placing their affections
than in any other action of their lives:
as many of these marriages will termi-
nate in separations, divorces, etc. Their
courtships will end in unhappy elope-
ments, and other ways not necessary
of explanation. Our readers must be
well aware that affairs of importance
begun at inauspicious times, by those
who have been born at those periods
when the stars shed their malign in-
fluence, can seldom, if ever, lea d to
much good; it is, therefore, that we en-
deavor to lay before them a correct
statement drawn from accurate astro-
logical information, in order that by
strict attention and care, they may
avoid falling into those perplexing
labyrinths from which nothing but that
care and attention can save them. The
list of days we have above given, will
be productive of hasty and clandestine
marriages--marriages under untoward
circumstances, perplexing attachments,
and a natural consequence, the dis-
pleasure of friends, together with fam-
ily broils, discussions and divisions. We
now present our readers with a

Although the greater number, or in-
deed, nearly all persor.s that are born
on the days stated in the preceding
list will be likely to meet with a pros-
pect of marriage, or become engaged in
some love affair of more than ordinary
importance, yet it must not be expected
that the result will be the same with
all of them; with some they will ter-
minate in marriage-with others in
disappointment-and some of them will
be in danger of forming attachments
that may prove of a somewhat trouble -
some d es~ ription. W e shall, therefore,
in order to enable our readers to dis-
tinguish them, give a cgmprehensive
and useful list, showing which of thQm
will be most likely to marry.
Those born within the limits of the
succeeding List of Hours, on any of the
preceding days, will be the most likely
to marry-or will, at least, have court-
ships that will be likely to have a
happy termination.

We do not presume to assert that
every person born on the last mentioned
times, will be exempt from all descrip-
tions of trouble during the whole of
their lives, but that they will never
(in spite of whatever may happen to
befall them) sink below mediocrity.
Even servants and those born of poor
parents will possess s ome superior
qualities--get into good company-be
much noticed by their superiors, and
will, in spite of any intervening diffi-
culties, establish themselves in the
world, and rise much above their
sphere of birth.
It has often been recorded, and
though a singular observation, experi-
ence has shown it to be a true one,
that some event of importance is sure
to happen to a woman in her thirty-
first year, whether single or married;
it may prove for her good, or it may
be some great evil or temptation; there-
fore we advise her to be cautious and
circumspect in all her actions. If she
is a maiden or widow, it is probable
she will marry this year. If a wife
that she will lose her children or her
husband. She will either receive riches
or travel into a foreign land; at all
events, some circumstance or oth~r will
take place during this remarkable year
of her life, that will have great effect
on her future fortunes and existence.
The like is applicable to men in
their forty-second year, of which so
many instances have been proved that
there is not a doubt of its truth: Ob-
serve always to take a lease for an odd
n urn ber of years; even are not prosper-
ous.-The three first days of the moon
are the best for signing papers, and
the first five days ·as well as the twen-
ty-fourth for any fresh undertaking.
But we cannot but allow that a great
d eal depends on our own industry and
perseverance, and by strictly discharg-
Ing · our duty to God and man, we may
often overcome the malign influence of
a b a d planet, or a day marked as un-
lucky in the book of fate.
METRAGRAl\!IMATISM,
OR THE ART OF FORTUNE-TELLING
BY TRANSPOSITION OF NAlUES
It has often been remarked, although
it is a fact by no means commonly
known, that tte names given to chil-
dren at the baptismal font joined to
their family or surnames, and added to
titles which may be bestowed upon
them in after life, often point out many
circumstances and evenls which may
befall the parties upon whom such
names have been bestowed; and that if
their parents had paid more attention
to this part of Astrological divination,
those names which were unlucky
might, by due care and attention, have
been avoided, while those of a more
fortunate description might have been
selected for their children, and have
been rendered even still more valu-
able and fortunate, by being conjoined
with others of a like nature. In order
that our readers may have a clearer in-
sight into this branch of fortune-tell-
ing, and which appears to have been
strangely neglected by modern prac-
titioners, we shall lay before them a
few specimens of this admirable sys-
tem of discovering the ev ents of our
checkered existence; · and from a study
of which they will readily learn how
to avoid b estowing on thei r children
su ch as . 21.re of a malignant nature;
and, at the same time, p erceive how
8 BOOK OF FORBIDDEN KNOWLEDGE
the secret influence of the stars that
preside at our birth, act in the min-
utest manner-even to the giving of
that name at our baptism, which often-
times explains to the bearer of it, if
he could then but know it, those events
which will assuredly befall him in the
course of his life. .
Of the antiquity of this science it is
scarcely necessary to speak-it may
however be as well to remark, that it
was formerly in the highest repute
among the astrologers of the early
ages, and even some of our ancient
writers have not disdained to advocate
its cause. One of these, the celebrated
Camden, has in his "Remains" be-
queathe d to the world an excellent
treatise on this ·subject. He refers the
origin of this invention tc the time of
Mos es, and conceives that it might
have had some sha re in the rr:ystical
tradition afterward called Caba lo,
communicated by that divine lawgiver
to the chosen s eventy.-That this art
was practiced by the a n cient E .gyptians
there ca nnot be a doubt, as the re are
even now r em a ining several of the
names of the Egyptian monarchs which
have been trans posed and fully point
out the principa l events of their lives.
The Greel{s al;:;o pract ic ed the art, but
we do not find any examples among
the Romans, which is somewhat sur-
prising, as their seers, astrologers, and
sybils practiced almost every species
of divination. Among modern nations,
the French a ppear to have distinguish-
ed themselves for the ir proficiency in
it, and which, Camden says, "they ex-
ceedingly admire and celebra te for the
deep antiquity and mystical meaning
thereof." Indeed, to such a height did
that nation carry the practice of this
art in the early ages, that there were
kept lists of lucky and unlucky names,
and partic ular ca re was talcen, when
bestowing a name on a child, that such
only should be given as could, by trans-
position, be form ed into some fortu-
nate signification. But this often fail-
ed, for even those very names which,
when transposed, contained this fortu-
nate signification; yet, by a second
transposition, sometimes quite the con-
trary would be indicated and thus
''Foil those, who would have foil'd the
stars."
Having thus introduced this subject
to our readers, and fully proved its an-
tiquity, it only remains for us to lay
before them such specimens of the art
as may enable them to practice upon
their own names, and by so doing be-
come acquainted with that principal
occurrence of the ir lives, which may
be for their future good or evil; and if
the latter, by possessing such fore-
knowledge, by ca ution a nd g o od con-
duct on their parts, a lleviate or prevent
its affects. \Ve shall take these in-
stances from the names of well known
cbaracters, by which it will be instant-
ly seen how immediate is the connec-
tj..pn between the name of the party
and the principal event of their lives.
And first with the name of Bonaparte,
which is perhaps the most complete
speeimen of the art we could possibly
lay before our readers, and if properly
transposed fully shows in each trans-
position the character of the man, and
points out that unfortunate occurrence
in his life, which ultimately proved his
ruin-thus:
NAPOLEON BONAPARTE.
NO, APPEAR NOT ON ELBA.
In the name of Wellington we find
his future glory parts:
ARTHUR WELLESLEY, Duke of Wel-
Hngton.
LET WELL FOILED GAUL secure thy
renown.
And the like in that of Nelson,-thus:
HORATIO NELSON.
HONOR EST A NILO.
Which in English means "Honor is to
be found at the Nile!"
In the name of SIR FRANCIS BUR-
DETT we find: FRANTIC DISTURB-
ERS, which fully prophesies the busy
scenes· of popular riot and disturbance
in which he would be engaged.
In the name of the late lamented
Princess Charlotte, we have another
proof of the infallibility of this art-
thus: · ·
PRINCESS CHARLOTTE AUGUSTA
OF WALES, P.
HER ..}UGUST RACE IS LOST, 0!
FATAL NEWS!
The following anagra m on James
VI of Scotland, fully proves that his
future fortune was predicted at his
baptism-thus:
CHARLES JAMES STUART
CLAIMS ARTHUH'S SEAT,
and accordingly, on the death of Queen
Elizabeth, he became James I. of Eng-
land, and thereby possessed the throne
whi ch the name given him at his birth
plainly foretold!
The above will be sufficient to in-
struct our readers in this very enter-
taining and infallible mode of discov-
ering future events. It may be neces-
sary to observe, that some names will
not easily form into separate words
without the addition or subtraction of
one or more letters, this is always al-
lowable-for instance, K may be sub-
stituted for C-I for J-V for U-and
vice versa.
These specimens will be sufficient to
prove the infallibility of this art; and
many of our readers will find, if they
transpose the letters of their own
names after the same fashion, that
their future good or ill fortune will be
thereby plainly pointed out.
DAYS OF THE WEEK
1. Their importance at the natal
hour.
A child born on Sunday will be of
long life and obtain riches.
A child born on Monday will be weak
and effeminate.
Tuesday is more unfortunate still.
BOOK OF FORBIDDEN KNOWLEDGE 9
though a chi_ld born on this day may,
by extraordinary vigila nce, conquer the
inordinate desires to which h e will be
subject; still, in his reckless attempts
to gra tify them, he will be in danger
of a violent death.
The child born on Wednesday will
be give n to a studious life, and shall
rea p great profit therefrom.
A child born on Thurs d a y shall at-
tain great honor and dignity.
H e who calls Friday his natal d a y
shall be of a strong con s titution, and
p e rha ps a ddicted to the pleasures of
love.
Saturday is another ill-omen ed day;
mos t c hildren born on this d ay will be
of heavy, dull, and dogged dispos itions.
II. Their influence otherwise.
If a person have his meas ure taken
for n ew clothes on a Sunday, h e will be
sorrowful and crying. If on a Monday,
h e will have ample fo od and provi-
si ons. If on a Tuesday, his clothes will
b e burned. If on a W ednes d a y, he will
enjoy h a ppiness and tranquility. If on
Thursda y, he will be good and pro-
pitious. If on a Friday, he will get
Into prison. If on Saturday, he will
exp e rie n ce numerous troubles and mis-
fortunes.
If o n e puts on a new suit of clothes
on a Sunda y, he will experience happi-
n ess and ease. If on a Monday, his
clothes will tear. If on a Tuesday,
even if he stand in wate r, his clothes
will ca tch fire. If on a Wednesday, he
will r eadily obtain a new suit. If on
a 'Thursda y, his dress will appear neat
and elegant. If on a Friday, as long
as the suit remain10 new, he will be
happy and d elighted. If on a Saturday,
he will be taken ill.
If a person puts on a new suit of
cl o th e ~! in the morning, h e will become
w ealthy and fortunate . If at noon, he
will appear elegant. If at about sun-
set, h e will become wre t ch ed. If in the
evening, h e will continue ill.
If a p e rson bathe on Sund a y, he will
experi ence affliction. If on Monday,
his property will increase. If on Tues-
d a y, he will labor under a nxie ty of
mind. If on Wednesday,, he will in-
creas e in beauty. If on Thurs d a y, his
prope rty will increase. If on Friday,
all his sins will be forgiven him. If
on S1
1turday, all hi~! ailments will be
remov ed.
For- shaving, four day~! of the week
are pref e rable to the rest, viz., Mon-
d a y, W ednesday, Thurs day, and Friday;
the other three are evil and inaus-
picious.
Luc ky day~! for business, three first
days of the moon's age; for marriage
the 7th, 9th, and 12th; requesting fa-

the 16th and 21st; to answer letters, if
poss ible choose an odd day of the
moon; to tra vel on land, choose the in-
crease of the moon; and to embar~ on
the ocean, choose tht: decline.
Ma rch is a fortunate month for be-
g-inning a new bullding-; and it is sing-
ular, but nevertheless reckoned true,
tha t it is good to open a concert-room,
a music-s hop, or b egin a n ew piece of
mus ic on the eve of St. Cecilia. It is
not good to marry on your own birth-
d a y, or on any martyr's; every other
saint's d a y is fortunate in this concern;
neither is it fortunate for a woma n to
marry in colors; let h e r dress be as
white a s p o::o;sible, except she be a
widow, thl:m let her c hoose some pleas-
ant 'Color, but beware of green and
yellow.

sign of su c~ ess, and a pieb a ld one, if
you are gomg to ask a f a vor; to be

especially to a man who is going court~
ing.
For a pigeon to fly into the house not

and if it r ests on a bed, it Is d eath:

TO ltiAKE A MA.GNETIC COMPASS
WHICH WILL SERVE TO DIS-
COVER THE TREASURES
AND ORES IN THE
EARTH
.For this purpose a magnet made of
the plusquam perfection, accompanied
by the prime material of which all met-
als grow is requisite; with this, the
magnet of the compass must be
strengthened. Around the compass are
engraved the characteristic signs of all
the seven metals. If it is desired now
to ascertain what kind of a metal is
most likely to be found in a hidden
treasure or in ore beneath the earth, it
will be only necessary to hie to that
particular spot, where the magnetic rod
has given the indication, but you must
put your foot there where the perpen-
dicular shows its attraction, and take
of every metal a small piece, that is,
one as heavy as the other, and lay it
upon the respective character and the
rieedle will rotate to that metal which
predominates under the surface of the
earth, and there it will stand still.
TO DISCERN IN A MIRROR, WHAT
AN ENEMY· DESIGNS AT THE
DISTANCE OF THREE
MILES OR MORE
Obtain a good plain looking glass,
as large as you please, and have it
framed on three sides only; upon the
left side it should be left open. Such
a glass must be held toward the direc-
tion where the enemy is existing and
you will be able to discern all his
markings, maneuverings, his doings
and workings. Was effectually used
during the Thirty Years' war.
FOR VIOLENT TOOTHACHES
Take a new nail, pick with this the
tooth till it bleeds, then take this nail
and insert it in a place where neither
sun or moon ever shines into, perha ps,
in the rafters of the bin in a cellar,
toward the r !sing of the sun; at the
first stroke upon the nail call the name
of him whom you design to help, and
speak: Toothache fty away, by the sec-
ond stroke: Toothache cease, pain al-
lay!
EYEWATER WHICH MAKES THE
SIGHT CLEAR, SO THAT NO
SPECTACLES ARE NEEDED
Take some good brandy or nettles,
one drachm of ginger, camphor, fish-
berry, herb and nasturtium, of each one
drachm, of cloves one scruple, or rue
toothwort, eyebalm so much as may
be held between two fingers (one
pinch). Bruise all these articles, and
put into the brandy, and distill it in
the sun, during the winter season 24
days in a warm room. Dip your fing·er
therein and rub the eyelids therewith,
morning and evening, this will keep
the eyes clear, and make them strong
without the use of spectacles.
TO RECOVER STOLEN GOODS
Mark well whence the thi ef left and
by which door; from it cut three pieces
of wood while pronouncing the three
most sacred names; take these scraps
of wood to a wagon, but in a noiseless
manner, take a · wheel off' the wagon
and insert the wood in the nave, again
pronouncing the three holiASt names,
then drive the wheel backward a nd
ejactulate: Thief,thief, return with the
stolen article, thou shalt be compelled
by the omniscience of God the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit. God the
Father calls thee back, God the Son
turn thy footsteps that thou must re-
turn, God the Holy Spirit guide thee ·to
retrace thy steps until thou again
reachest this place. By dint of God's
power thou must come back, by the
wisdom of the Son of God thou shalt
enjoy no peace nor rest till all the stol-
en things are returned to the rightful
owner. By the grace of God the Holy
Ghost, thou must run and leap, canst
neither rest nor sleep till thou shalt
arrive at that place where thou has
committed the theft. God the Father
bind thee, God the Son compel thee,
God the Holy Ghost cause thee to re-
turn. The wheel, thou must not rapid-
ly turn, or the soles of his feet may
blister and burn, he will 1n pain and
anguish cry, and ere you catch him,
thus may die; Thou shalt come in the
name of the Father, the Son and the
Holy Spirit. 'l'hief, thou must come.
Thief thou must come. If thou art
mightier, thief, thief, thief, than God
and the Holy Trinity, then stay where
thou art. The ten eommandments
BOOK OF FORBIDDEN KNOWLEDGE 11
force thee to observe not to steal, hence
thou must return.
TO SECURE ONE'S SELF AGAINST
ROBBERS WHILE TRAVELING
Speak three times: Two wicked eyes
have overshadowed me, but three other
eyes are overshadowing me too, the one
of God, the Father, the other God the
Son, the third of God the Holy Spirit,
they watch my blood and flesh, my
marrow and home, and all other large
and small limbs, they shall be protected
in the name of God.
ALSO FOR THE TOOTHA.CHE
St. Peter stood under an oak tree.
Then spake our beloved Redeemer to
Peter: Why art thou sad and weary?
Peter replied:· Why should I not feel
sad and dread, since all the teeth de-
cay in my head? Wherupon our Lord
.Jesus Christ spake unto Peter: Peter,
hie to the cool and lonely nook, there
runs a clear water in a mountain
brook. Take water thereof in thy de-
caying mouth, and spew it again into
into the running brook. This done three
times in succession, and each time the
three highest names pronounced. This
repeat for three days in succession.
HOW TO MAKE ONE'S SELF AGREE-
ABLE TO ALL
Carry a whoop's eye on your person.

you make a good b1l.rgain on all what
you sell.
TO FASTEN A PERSON THAT HE
MAY NOT ESCAPE
Take a needle wherewith the gown
from a corpse had been sewed and put
this needle into the foot prints of the
person you seek to fC~,sten. And never

your mouth again and kiss her, and
she will accept your suit.
Or: Take salt, cheese and flour, mix
it together, put it into her room, and
she will have no rest until she sees
you.
AN AMBROSE-STONE
Steal the eggs of a raven, boil them
hard, lay them again into the nest and
the raven will fly across the sea and
bring a stone from abroad and lay it
over the eggs and they will become at
once soft again. If such a stone is
wrapped up into a bay leaf and is given
to a prisoner, that prisoner will be lib-
erated at once. Whoev-er touches a
door with such a stone, to him that
door will be opened, and he who puts
that stone into his mouth will under-
stand the song of every bird.
WHEN AN ANilUAL 15 STUPID
When an animal is stupid, when it
runs around as if it had the rams, or
when it carries the head upon one side,
which signifies a sort of woe or pain,
it may arise from heat and superfluous
blood; hence it would be good to bleed
such a baast three or four times, espe-
cially on a Friday. In all cases, how-
ever, an animal should suffer from such
an ailment, pronounce the following
grace three times over it, the first time
stand upon the right side of the ani-
mal; the second time on its left side;
the third time again upon the right
side, and while saying the grace move
constantly your hand over the back of
the animal.
TO MAKE ONE'~ SELF SHOT-PROOF
According to this formula, on the
day of Peter and Paul, at vesper tide,
there spring open waywort roots, of
which hunters and men of the forest
believe that he who carries them on
his person cannot be hit or shot.
TO CATCH FISH
Take valerian, or cocculus Indicus,
and make small cakes thereof with
flour; throw these into the deep. As
soon as a fish eats thereof it will be-
come intoxicated, . and float upon the
surface.

thief upon the fire, for thy sin and
temerity so dire. I place them upon
thy lungs, liver and hea rt, that thou

TALISMANS, CHARMS, SPELLS AND INCANTATIONS
Spells of such force no wizard grave
E'er framed in dark Thessalian cave,
Though his could this ocean dry,
And force the planets from the sky.
TALISMANS
In the whole circle of the occult sciences there is scarcely anything more
obstruse or intricate than the mystical scienee of Talismans. The use of them
has occasionally received much opposition from incredulous individuals; while
on the other hand, it has stood the ground with firmness amidst the change of
ages. Mourning rings, miniatures, lockets, mementoes, armorial bearings, and
the "boast of heraldry," are but so many relics of Talismanic learning, Amongst
mankind in general, there is much of talismanic belief; witness the avidity with
which the caul of an infant is sought after to preserve from danger by water;
as also the celebrated romance of "The Talisman," by Sir Walter Scott; the in-
tense interest of which arises from the narration of a singular instance of the
faith formerly reposed in Talismanic agency. It is now well known that when
Napoleon went to Egypt he was then presented with a talisman by a learned
eastern magician, the effect of which was to protect and defend him from sudden
attacks, assassinations, and all manner of hurts from firearms.
TALISMAN FOR LOVE
This Talisman is said to be wonderfully effi-
cacious in procuring success in amours and love
adventures. It should be made or prepared when
Venus, the planet of love, is the evening star. It
should be made preferably of pure silver, but
where that is not practicable, cut out the picture
of the Talisman from this book, and paste it
neatly in any suitable article, such as in a locket,
back of a watch, or it may be pasted on a piece
of round cardboard of equal size and worn over
the heart or the left breast, or ca.rrie~ in the
pocket as a Lucky Pocket Piece.
TALISMAN AGAINST ENEMIES
Where possible this Talisman should be cast of
the purest grain tin, and during the increase of
the moon. The eharacters are to be engraved on
it also during the increase of the moon. Where
this is not practicable, the illustration may be
cut out of this book and placed in, say, a locket,
and suspended about the neck, or worn on any
part of the body, or it may be pasted on a piece
of round cardboard of· equal size and carried in
the pocket. It should be kept from the sight of
all but the wearer. Its effects are to give victory
over enemies, protection against their machina-
tions, and to inspire the wearer thereof with the
most remarkable confidence.
BOOK OF FORBIDDEN KNOWLEDGE
TALISMAN FOR WAR AND BATTLE
This Talisman bears on it the powerful words,
and also the awful sign which were said to have
been conveyed to the Emperor Constantine from
heaven, in daylight, and in the presence of his
whole army, and whereby he was victorious in
battle. It should be made of highly tempered
steel, but where not practicable, the illustration
may be cut out of this book and placed in a locket
or other suitable article, or simply pasted on a
piece of cardboard of similar size. It should be
tied around the sword-arm.
An ancient manuscript says of this Talisman:
"He that beareth this sign about him shall be
helped in every need and necessity,"
TALISMAN FOR DESTROYING IN-
SECTS AND REPTILES
13
This Talisman is to be made, if possible, of iron,
when the sun and moon enter the sign, Scorpio.
It has been proved to be powerful in effect; so
much so that no kind of venomous reptile or trou-
blesome insect can come within some yards of the
house or place in which it is. The manuscript
from which the account of this Talisman is takeu,
cost a very large sum and a medical gentle·.nan
to whom it belonged, affirms that he had himself
proved its efficacy, for being at one time much an-
noyed with beetles, he mane a talisman, accord-
ing to instructions here given and screwed it to
the floor, when these troublesome insects imme-
diately disappeared, but afterwards, when the
servant removed it, through ignorance, they re-
turned in great numbers; when he again nailed it
to the floor, and ·they again disappeared!
If impractical to have this Talisman specially !llade, the illustration may be
cut out of this book and pasted on a piece of heavy tin or other metal, or even
a stout piece of cardboard.
TO OVERCOME CHARMS AND EVIL INFLUENCE
Repeat reverently, and with si'ncere faith, the following words, and you shall
be protected in the hour of danger: "Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust,
and not be afraid, for the Lord Jehovah is my strength and my song; He also is
become my salvation. For the stars of heaven, anrl the constellations thereof,
shall not give their light; the sun shall be darkened in his going forth, and the
moon shall not cause her light to shine. And behold, at evening tide, trouble.;
and before the morning he is not; this is the portion of them that spoil us, and
the lot of them that rob us.''
CHARM AGAINST TROUBLE IN GENERAL
Repeat reverently, and with sincere faith, the following words, and you shall
be protected in the hour of danger: "He shall deliver the six troubles; .yea, in
seven there shall no evil touch thee.
· "In famine he shall redeem thee :from death, and in war from thepower of the
sword. And thou shalt know that thy tabernacles shall be in peace, and thou
shalt visit thy habitation and shalt not err."
18 BOOK OF FORBIDDEN KNOWLEDGE
CHARMS, OMENS, AND
SIGNS
The use of charm and talisman is
extensive, and a great percentage of
the people have their pet "lucky piece"
always with them. Magnetic lode-
stone):! are universally used to attract
good fortune, love and happiness, like-
wise with various lucky images or
idols. Belief in these lucky pieces ex-
tends back into history of thousands
of years.
CLOUDS
Fleecy clouds indicate either a long
wet or dry spell. Long streaky clouds
denote fair weather. A halo around
the moon is 8. sign of rain. An un-
even number of reports of lightning in
quick succession is a sign of good
luck. Thunder from a clear sky is also
indicative of good fortune.
PHYSICAL SIGNS AND OMENS
It is unlucky to see a new moon for
the first time through a glass. A bee,
flying in the house, should be retained
for a few minutes as a prisoner to
bring luck. Crickets in the house are
considered a - sign of luck, but a sign
of illness if they leave without appa r-
ent reason. A sick person witnessing
a shooting star will recover within the
month. The howling of dogs denotes
impending ·disaster. Robins are looked
upon as messengers of good luck. To
kill a moth hovering about a candle is
to invite good luck. If a knife be
dropped, accidently, so that the point
penetrates the ground and stands up-
right, good luck will result. To spill
salt on the table is considered unlucky.
To counteract the spell, throw a pinch
of the salt over the left shoulder. If
your teakettle •ings, it is a sign of
happiness and contentment in your
house.
A spark on the wick of a candle
means a letter will be received by the
one who first sees it. To move into a
new home on Friday is unlucky; how-
ever, Monday and Wednesday are par-
ticularly fortunate. A girl standing
under a piece of mistletoe may be kiss-
ed by any man finding her there.
Should the girl refuse the kiss, she in-
vites bad luck. To put your clothes
on the wrong way is a sign of good
luck, if performed without intention.
However, the clothes must be worn
that way, else the luck changes. If you
observe a shooting star, make a wish
while it is still in motion, and the
wish will come true.
A rabbit running across your path
Is a sign of impending ill luck. The
continual hooting of owls at night is
an omen of ill-health. Should you wash
your hands or face in water just used
by another, be sure to first sprinkle a
few drops on your head before empty-
in~ the vessel to avoid bad luck. Sun-
shine and the sneezing. of a cat are
said to be happy omens for brides. A
creeping child will have better luck
and be more fortunate in life than one
that does not. B:orseshoes are always
considered lucky, and should be hung
over th e door of the house or barn.
The horseshoe on the barn insures a
good harvest. If you see a pin, pick
it up; as it will bring you good luck;
to let it lie is bad luck. Never relate a
bad dream before breakfast. lest it
come true. The new moon first seen
over the right shoulder offers an op-
portunity for a wish to come trur.-.
To break a mirror is considered un-
lucky, and the person breaking the
glass will h a ve bad fortune for seven
:rears. In Catholic countries a person
who acc identally breaks a mirror
crosses himself and repeats "May th~
Saints avert ill fortune." However if
a glass is wilfully and purposely br~k­
en and thrown away, it will have no
effect on the person breaking the
glass.
POPULAR SUPERSTITIONS
KNOCKING ON WOOD
The custom of knocking on wood to
prevent ill luck is perhaps the most
prevalent custom in existence, and is
performed by all classes of people, the
world over. Its origin is attributed to
the ancien[ religious rite of touching
a crucifix when taking an oath. It is
said that a president of the United
States is accused of resorting to this
strange custom.
THE EVIL EYE
Fear of being bewitched by the "evil
eye" is very prevalent among the Latin
r a ces, and in this country the belief
is widespread that certain persons,
possessing power of the devil and su-
pernatural agencies, can bewitch an-
other by simply looking at him with
hatred in the eyes, and thus cast a
spell.
Psychology teaches that it is pos-
sible to influence others with your
mind, the expression and influence go-
ing from the eyes, however, this should
not bo t ermed as the "evil eye spell,"
which is in rea lity a myth. However,
many people still cling to the belief
and wear charms and amulets to coun-
teract the bad influence of the evil
eye. These charms really aid these
people, as it changes the negative
thoughts of their minds to positive
one:;;.
Perhaps the most popular amulet is
a cross of jet, the belief being that it
will split if looked upon by a person
having evil intentions. In some parts
of the world, the face of a - new born
child is gently brushed with a bough
of pine to prevent any evil influences
from attacking the child. The Hindus

dies. Taken in food, it is good for
cancer.
When you catch a whoop, you will
find a stone which you must put under
the head of a ~leeping person, and that
person will be compelled to impart to
you all secrets which he may know.
If you carry a badger's foot with you,
all your affairs will be fortunate, and
you will not be perplexed nor err.
Whoop eyes make a man benign. If
you carry the eye with you, you will
be in good repute by the authorities;
and if you will carry the head no one
will cheat you.
If you carry the head of a crow upon
your breast, .all must love you who
have dealings with you.
When you catch a mole and put it
into a pot, while it lives, and ig;nite
sulphur, all moles will gather together.
When you put a mole into an earthen
pot, and boil the same, and with this
water wash the hair, the hair will turn
white.
During the month of August take a
swallow from its nest. In its stomach
you will find a stone, which you may
wrap into a linen handkerchief, hang
under your left arm. It is a good thing
against slanderers, and makes you
agreeable among the people.

Black is the color of sadness, gloom
and d e ath, while white denotes all that
is pure and desired.
L UCii:Y STONES
Birthstones are genera lly accepted as
inducing fortunate occure n ces. Each
stone is governed by a different month
or Sign of the Zodiac. They are as
follows:
January-Ga~net.
February-·Amethyst.
March-Bloodstone.
April-Diamond.
Ma y-Emerald.
June-Agate.
July-Ruby.
August-Sardonyx.
Septe m h e r-Sapphire.
October-Opal.
November-Topaz.
Decemher-Turquoise.
Not being contented with a lucky
gem for each month, the ancient phil-
osophers allotted a stone for each day
of the week, as follows :
Sunda y-Ruby and chrysolite.
Monday-Se lenite, pea rl and opal.
'l'uesda y-Amethyst and bloodstone.
Wednesday-Agate, jade and olivine..
Thursday-Emerald and sapphire.
Frida y-Turquoise and lapis-lazuli.
Saturd&.y-Onyx.
Ho·w TO MAI<:E YOUR LOVER OR
SWEETHEART CO!IE
If a m a id wishes to see her lover, let
h e r tak e the following method: Prick
the third or w edding finger of your left
hand with a sharp needle (beware a
pin), a nd with the blood write your
own a nd lov e r 's name on a piece of
clean writing p a per, in as small a com-
p ass as you can, and encircle it with
three rou n d rings of the same crimson
s tream, fold it up, and exactly at the
ninth hour of the evening bury it with
y our own h a nd in the earth, and tell
no one. You r lover will hasten to you
a s soon as pos sible, and he will not be
able t o r est until he sees you, and if
you have quarrelled to make it up. A
young man may al~o try this charm,
only instead of the wedding finger,
le t him pie rce the left thumb.
FOLK-LORE OF PINS
Why, however, north country people
are s o p e rsistent in their refusal to
give one a nother a pin it is not easy
t o di scover, as even they themselves
cannot give the origin and reason of
this super s itition. When asked for a
pin they invariably say, "You may take
one, but mind, I do not give it." It may,
perha ps, have some connection with
the vulgar prejudice against giving a
knife, or other sharp instrument, as
mentioned by Gay in his "Shepherd's
Week."
But woe is me I such presents luckless prove,
For knives, they tell me, always sever love.
-A supposition as popular now as in
d ays gone by. Another fact associated
with pins will doubtless interest those
of the f a ir s ex about to enter on the
happy sta te of m a trimony. Thus, it is
still a prev a lent belief in certain places
that a bride, in removing her bridal
robe a nd ch a plet a.t the completion of
the m:ilrriage ceremonies, must take
special care to throw away every pin
worn on this eventful day. Woe to the
bride who k eeps even one pin used ·in
the m a rriage toilet. Woe also to the
bridesmaids if they retain any of them,
as their chances of marriage will
thereby be mate ria lly les s ened, and
anyhow they mus t give up all hope of
being w edded before the following
vVhitsuntide. On the other hand, in
Sussex on her return home from
church the bride is often robbed of all
the pins about her dress by her single
friends present, from the belief that
whoe ver poss esses one of them will be
married in the course of a year. Much
excitem ent and amusement are occa-
siona lly cau sed by the youthful c_
om-
petito r s f or this supposed charm, and
the brid e h er self is not infrequently
the victim of rather rough treatment.

MAGICAL PROPERTIES
OF PINS
Among the magical properties of pins
we may mention their supposed effi-
cacy in the cure of certain disease.
Thus, in Alabama, in the case of warts,
the patient is taken to an ash tree,
where a pin is first stuck into the bark,
and withdrawn; a wart is transfixed
with it till he feels pain, and then the
pin is again pushed into the tree.
Every wart entirely disappears. A few
years ago we are told that some trees
might be seen thickly studded with
pins, each the index of a cured wart.
In connection with this superstition
there is a well known couplet:
Ashen tree, ashen tree,
Pray buy these warts of me.
In place of a pin, :ot nail driven into
an oak is reported to cure toothache.
A Virginia remedy consists in rubbing
the warts with a snail, after it has
been pierced with a pin as many times
as there are warts. As the snail by
degrees withers away, so it is believed
that the wart, impr-egnated with its
matter, will do the same. It has been
pointed out that most of the charms
of this kind are of the nature of a sac-
rifice, the warts being transferred to
a substitute.
DREAMS [THAT COME TRUE
A poor peasant, dwelling in the vi-
cinity of Rheims, saw, one night, dur-
tng his slumbers, a young man, who,
taking him by the hand, conducted him
to the base of an old wall, where, after
designating a huge stone recommend-
ing him to raise it up on the morrow,
he suddenly vanished. The peasant
followed his advice, and found the
stone indicated in his dream, which
upon being displaced, and revealed a
vase filled with golden coins-enrich-
ing the dreamer and his family.
Gassius of Parma, who had espoused
the cause of Mark Antony, fled to Ath-
ens after the battle of Actium. While
sleeping in his apartments there, he
saw a man enter his chamber, an indi-
vidual with dark complexion and dis-
hevelled hair, very tall and stout. Cas-
sius demanded who he was; to which
the phantom replied, "I am your evil
genius." The dreamer arose in affright,
and seeing no one present, summoned
his slaves, inquiring if any among
them had seen a stranger enter the
apartment. An examination showed the
doors of the house to have been firmly
closed, so that it was impossible for
anyone to enter. Cassius, persuaded
that he had been the victim of some
chimerical illusion, again went to
sleep, but the same vision presented it-
self a second time, addressing him
with the same words. Cassius, troubled
arose from his couch and summoned
lights. At early daybreak he was as-
sassinated by order of the Emperor
Augustus.
MURDER REVEALED
Two Arcadian friends, journeying to-
gether, arrived at Megara, at which
place the 0ne took lodgings at the
house of a friends, while his compan-
ion put up at a public t-avern. The
traveler lodging at his friend's, was
visited in a dream by his comrade, who
supplicated him to come extricate him
from a trap set for him by the inn-
keeper. He awoke suddenly, arose,
dressed and hastened towards the tav-
ern, when an afterthought compelled
him to return, and he again undressed
and went to sleep. · Again his com-
rade presented himself, but this time
covered with blood, and be~eeching him
to avenge his murder. The phantom
informed his fellow traveler that he
had been treacherously assassinated by
the tavern keeper, and his body con-
cealed beneath a dunghill outside the
city gates. Terrified at this second ap-
parition, the Arcadian hesitated no
longer, but going to the place desig-
nated, he discovered his friend's c0rpse,
and was therefore enabled to bring the
murderer to justice.
LUCKY DREAMS
A tradesman of Paris, sleeping in
bed with his wife, dreamed that he
heard a voice exclaiming to him: "I
have now finished forty years, seven
months, and twenty-nine days of labor
and I am happy." The wife, sleeping
by her husband's side, had the same
dream, and upon awakening in the
morning went forth, and without men-
tioning the occurrence, procured a lot-
tery ticket bearing the numbers 40-7-
29. The same day the numbers came
out, and the tradesman lamented his
indiscretion in not taking the advice of
his nocturnal visitor. His sorrow was
turned into joy when he learned that
his wife, profiting by her dream, had
drawn the grand prize in the Royal
Lottery.
An old lady of Paris was in the habit
of encouraging her niece by promises
of wealth. which she never fulfilled;
extenuating her procrastination from
year to year ty recourse of ingenious
expedients, and she finally died. Short-
ly after her decease, the aunt appeared
during the night-time and instructed
her niece to remove the center tile of
their hearth, where she would discover
the oft-promised treasure. The young
girl obeyed the injunction, but discov-
ered in the cavity nothing save a heap
of cinders. In vexation of spirit, the
niece railed vehemently against the
duplicity of a relative deceiving her
after death. On the following night,
however, the phantom again appeared~
and without saying a word, designatea
four numbers apparently on the wall.
Although placing little reliance upon
BOOK OF FORBIDDEN KNOWLEDGE 19
the injunction which she conceived to
relate to a lottery (then the town
talk), the niece resolved to try her
luck, especially as the ticket offered
for her purchase by the dealer bore
the same numbers designated by the
apparition. Subsequently, these num-
bers came out in the order indicated,
and the girl came into possession of
four hundred thousand francs.
DIONYSIUS' VISION
Dionysius, of Syracuse, while lying
one night upon his couch, awake and
contemplative, heard a loud noise, and
arose to ascertain the cause of it. He
perceived at the end of the gallery a
woman of gigantic stature, as hideous
in countenance as one of the Furies,
engaged in sweeping the mannion with
a gigantic broom. In terror and af-
fright, the tyrant summoned his friends
and caused them to spend the remain-
der of the night with him. But the
specter re-appeared no more. Two
days after this vision, the son of Dion-
ysius fell from a window and was kill-
ed, and before a week had elapsed his
entire family was destroyed, and thus,
observes the historian Leloyer, it can
be justly said that Dionysius and his
race were swept off the face of the
earth in the same manner in which the
Fury, the avenging genius of Syra-
cure, had been seen to sweep out the
palace.
OBSERVATIONS CONCERN..
ING THE EYES
Spots in the eyes are of two sorts;
either they appear in the white of the
eye (and this shows the sudden redun-
dancy of melancholy as appears in such
a~ are near death), or when the eyes
are maculated with black spots pro-
ceeding from habitual melancholy, and
is a certain index of the afflicting pas-
sions of the mind; or else the eyes are
masculated with spots like the grain
of millet, or quadrangle; and if divers
various colors, as fiery, red, azure, or
of a rainbow color, all of which indi-
cates mad, wild, cruel, and the worst
of conditions; from whence we may
pronounce most horrid events, and un-
natural death.
The following additional observa-
tions concerning eyes will be found in-
teresting and useful:
1. Great eyes denote a slothful, bold
and lying person, of a rustic and
coarse mind. 2. Eyes deep in the head
denote a great mind, yet full of doubts,
but generous and friendly, and if they
are blue or gray, they signify great
ltnowledge; if they are of a greenish
cast they intermix malice, injury and
envy, and if red, they are of the nature
of the cat. 3. Eminent and apparent
eyes of a wall color, denote a simple,
foolish, and prodigal person. 4. Sharp
and piercing eyes, that decline the eye-
brows, denote a deceiver, and a secret
and lawless per:wn. 5. Little eyes like
those of a .mole or pig, denote a weak
understandmg, and easily to be im-
posed on. 6. Beware of squint eyes, for
out of one hundred, you will not find
two faithful; for the possessor will be
sly, c;unning, and insinuating. It is
very Ill luck to meet a squinting per-
sop, and from long experience, I would
Wish that a person going out on busi-
!less or a~y _great expectations, meet-
mg a squmtlng person of either sex
would return home and defer their
business till another day, if they wish
for success. 7. Eyes that move slowly
and look sleepy, denote an unfaithful'
slothful, and riotous person. 8. The
wor:;;t of all the eyes are the yellowish
or citr<?n; beware of them, for the pos-
sessor Is a dangerous person if you are
in his power. 9. Beware also of them
who, when they awake, twinkle their
eyes, for they are double minded. If it
is a woman that does so with her left
eye, trust her not as to the faithful-
ness of her love, and have an eye upon
her actions. 10. A child who has a blue
yein across he:t: nose, be~ween the eyes,
IS a general sign that It will not live
long, but if it survives its infancy it
will be very passionate, and a gr'eat
trouble to its family. But you seldom
will find deceit where the eye looks
with a modest confidence, not staring
you out of countenance, nor averting
as if detected of a crime; but when in
business, love, or friendship, there ap-
pears a tender firmness, the conscious-
nes of the integrity of the heart and
conduct are thereby expressed.
SIGNS TAKEN FROM PARTS OF
'l'HE EYES
1. The angle of the eyes over long
indicates malevolent condition. 2. The
angles being short, show a laudable
nature; if the angles near the nose are
fleshy, they denote hot constitution and
improbity. 3. '.rhe balls of the eyes are
equal, declare justice-unequal, the
contrary. 4. The circles in the eyes of
various colors and dry, denote fraudu-
lency and vanity; but moist, denote
fortitude, prudence and eloquence. 5.
The lower circle green, and the upper
black, are sure signs of a deceiver, and
fraudulent person. 6. Eyes of moderate
bigness, clear and shining, are signs of
an ingenious, noble, generous and hon-
est mind. '
THE SILENT LANGUAGE
By motion of the hands. This art is
performed by the twenty-four letters
of the hand and fingers, which you
must learn, and then you must spell
the words you intend your friend
should know; the letters are very easi-
ly learned, and as easily remembered.
I have taught several persons in less
than half an hour. You must under-
stand that most of the letters are upon
the left hand, and made witn the fin-
20 BOOK OF FORBIDDEN KNOWLEDGE
gers of your right hand upon your left
hand; the forefinger of your right h a nd
you point to every letter; but some
times that and the two next fingers
make several letters, as you will see.
The vowels are very easy to remember,
they being the tops or ends of your five
fingers upon your left hand, :fnd Y is
the table or palm of your hand, thus:
The end of the top of the thumb is . . . ..... . . A
The end of the fore finger is . ......... . ... . . E
The end of the middle finger is . .......... . .. I
The end of the ring finger is ..... . ..•. . ..• . 0
The end of the little finger is ............•. U

The backs of your hands together . .......... . S
The end of your fore finger to the middle joint
of the other fore finger . . .. . . .. . . ........ T
Two fingers upon the little finger of left hand . . W
Two fore fingers across .................... X
Give two snaps with your fingers ............ Z
Practice it but a few times over, and
you will soon be perfect; severa l mo-
tions represent the likeness of the let-
ters; as, one finger at the back of your
hands is like I, two fingers like N,
three is like M. The fore finger to the
middle joint of the other fore finger is
like T; two fingers across is like X;
likewise B, C, D, is very easily remem-
bered, one finger on the left thumb is
B, two fingers C, three fingers D. So
the rest a re soon learned, and as easy
to remember. But you must always
remember to give a snap with your
finger between every word, that your
friend may distinguish one word from
another. If you are in company, and
think some one in compa ny under-
stands you, that you would not h a ve,
it is easy for you to change the vowels
to some other part of the hand, and
then none but your friend that knows
it can understand you. Suppose you
would say to your mistress, when she
is in a great compa ny, "Madam, I am
your humble serv,ant."
Lay three fingers on the back of your hand .. . M
Put your finger to the end of your thumb ..... A
Three fingers upon your left thumb ... . .... . . D

A FIGURE HAND
You · must make an exchange and
place these figures in the place:
a e i o u y t n s r

th~:d then your alphabet will run

w y 6 2
Columbia, Columbia, to glory arise,
C415mb31, C415mb31, 74 cl 40y 10392
You will find a great many words
nothing but figures, and there is scarce
any word, great or small, but has the
greatest part figures. It is so plain to
be learned that I need not give you any
further instructions, but only to prac-
tice the ten figures instead of letters.
'l'he other hand is performed by ex-
changing of more letters, one for the
other.
a e I o u
y t n s r
When you are to write A, you must
write Y, when you are to write Y, you
must write A; and so on of all the
rest. As for example, suppose you
would say, "Sir, I am your humble ser-
vant," it is thus:
Onu, n ym aR
ru hrm, blt Oturyie
This appears like another language,
and puzzles the greatest wits, and with
a little practice is soon learned, by
reason there are but ten letters you
are to learn for the other, your alpha-
bet will be thus :
a.bcdefghojklmnopqrstuvwxyz
y b c d t f g u h kIm is p quo e r v w x &l'l
I shall not proceed any further, be-
cause this is sufficient, but let the
r eader practice what is here shown
him, and he may soon learn the whole
art.
HOW TO WRITE LOVE LET-
TERS SECRETLY
To write love letters secretly, so that
they s)lall not be discovered, take a
sheet of white paper and double it In
the middle, and cut holes through both
the half sheets; let the holes be cut
l ike a pa n e of glass, or other forms
that you may fancy; then with a pin,
prick two little holes at each end and
cut your paper in two halves; give one
h a lf to your friend to whom you intend
to write, lay your cut paper upon a
half sheet of writing paper, and stick
two pins in these holes that it stir not;
th en through these holes that you did
cut, write your mind to your fr iend.
When you have done, take off your
pa per holes again, and then write some
other idle words both before and after
your lines but if they were written to
BOOK OF FORBIDDEN KNOWLEDGE 21
make some little sense, it would carry
the less suspicion; the n seal it up and
send it. When y0ur friend h ath re-
ceived it, he must lay his paper on the
same, putting pins into the pin holes,
and then h e can read nothing but your
mind that you write, for all the rest of
the lines are covered. ·
Another.-Write what you please of
a letter on one side of a sheet of letter
paper with common ink, then turn
your paper, and write on the other
side with milk, that which yould have
secret, and let it dry, but this must be
written with a clean pen. Now when
you would read it you must hold that
side which is writte n with ink to the
fire, and the milky l etters will then
show bluish on the other side.
THE WAY TO GET RICH
AND LIVE HAPPY IS THE
MARRIAGE S'l'ATE
"There is a tide in the affairs of men,
which, taken at the flood, leads on to
fortune."
He that by the plow would thrive,
Himself must either hold or drive.
For age and want save while you may,
No morning's sun lasts a whole day.
Get what you can, and what you get, hold:
'Tis a stone t:1at will tum all your lead to gold.
Therefore be ruled by me, I pray;
Save something for a rainy day.
Remember, that time is money; for
he that can earn $2.50 a day at his
labor, and goes abroad or sits idle at
home one-half of that day, though he
spend but 10 cents during his diversion
or idleness, he ought not to reckon
that the only expense; he hath really
wasted, or, rather, thrown away $1.00·
besides.
Remember, that credit is money. If
a man let his money lay in my hands
after it is due, because he has a good
opinion of my credit, h e gives me the
interest, or so much as I can make of
the money during that time. This
amounts to a very considerable sum,
where a man has large credit, and also
makes good use of it.
Remember, that money is of a pro-
lific or multiplying nature. Money will
produce money, and its offspring will
produce more; and so $1.25 turned
is $1.50; being turned again is $1.75;
and so on, till it becomes a hundred
dollars, and, the more there is of it,
the more it will produce on every turn-
ing, so that the profits rise quicker and
quicker, and he who throws away $1
destroys a ll that it might have pro-
duced, even some scores of dollars.
Rememher this proverb: that the
good paymaster is lord of a nother
man's purse; for he who is known to
pay punctua lly and exactly to the time
h e promises, may, at a ny time, and on
any occasion, raise all the money his
friends can spare. This is sometimes
of great use, next to industry and fru-
gality. Nothing can contribute more
to the raising of a man in the world
than punctuality in all his dealings.
Therefore, never keep borrowed money
one single hour .beyond the time prom-
ised, lest the disappointment should
shut up your friend's purse forever, a:J
the most trifling actions that affect a
man's credit ought always to be
avoided.
The sound of the hammer at five
o'clock in the morning, or at nine at
night, being heard by a creditor, makes
him easy six months longer; but, if he
sees you at a gaming table, or hears
your voice in a tavern when you should
be at work, he sends for his money the
very next day, and demands it before
it is convenient for you to pay him.
Beware of thinking all your own
that you possess, and of living accord-
ingly. This is a mistake that many
people of credit fall into; but, in order
to prevent this, always keep an exact
daily account of both your expenses,
and also of your daily income and
profits; for, if you will only just take
the trouble at first to enumerate par-
ticulars, you will discover unto you
how wonderfully small trifling ex-
penses mount up to a large sum; by
which you will a lso discern what might
have been, and also what may for the
future be saved without causing any
great in,;onvenience. In short, the way
to obtain riches, if you desire it, is a3
plain as the way to· market, which de-
pends chiefly ori two things, viz.: in-
dustry and frugality. And take care
that you waste neither .time nor money
but daily make the best use of both.
If you t~ke care of the hours and days,
the weeks, months and· years will also
take care of themselves.
I have always found, by constant ex-
perience, that any business, being first
well contrived, is more than half done
-for a sleeping fox catches no poultry.
There will be sleep enough in the
grave; and, also that lost time is but
seldom found again, for that which we
generally call time enough always
proves little enough; for sloth makes
things difficult, while industry makes
them easy.
He that rises late must trot hard all
day, and shall scarce overtake his busi-
ness at night-for laziness travels so
slow that poverty soon overtakes him.
Drive your business, but let not that
drive you; for early to bed and early to
rise is the way to become healthy,
wealthy and wise. Industry need not
want, while he who lives on a vain
hope will do fasting; for we find that
there is nothing to be done or accomp-
lished under the sun without labor.
He that hath a trade hath an estate,
and he that hath a profession hath on
office and profit with honor, but then
the trade must be worked at, and the
profession well followed, or they will
BOOK OF FORBIDDEN KNOWLEDGE
not enable you to pay rent and taxes;
for at the working man's house, hun-
ger looks in, but dares not enter-for
industry pays debts, while despair in-
creases them.
Diligence is the mother of good luck.
As Solomon said, "The diligent hand
maketh rich, while he that dealeth
wfth a slack hand becometh poor," for
God gives all things to industry. Then
plow deep while sluggards sleep, and
you shall have plenty, while others
have reason to complain of hard times.
Therefore, keep working while it is
called today, for you know not how
much you may be hindered tomorrow;
and never that business to be done to-
morrow - which you can do today; for,
since you are not sure of a single hour,
throw not that away. How many are
there who live daily by their wits, and
who often break for want of a stock
in hand, while industry gives comfort,
plenty and respect.
Keep your shop well and then your
shop will keep you. For it sometimes
happens that the eye of a master will
do more work than both his hands,
and mor<>. especially if his head be any
reasonable length; for the want of care
generally does more damage than the
want of knowledge. If you do not
watch your workmen, you may just
as well leave them your purse open;
for the trusting too much to the care
of others has completely ruined many
a man. Therefore, if you would be
wealthy, think of being careful and
saving; for ·
"Women, wine, game, and deceit,
Make the wealth small and the wants great."
OMENS
Omens, as signs that may be good
or bad, resemble dreams in this, that
they bring before us signals that we
ourselves do not seek, and convey
warnings that are of much significance
to those who can read them right.
VALUE OF OMENS
In olden days, when superstition had
a strong hold upon the minds of men,
the abuse of this branch of Occultism
led to much needless misery; but now
that the clear light of science has scat-
tered so many of the mists of mere
superstition, we can set aside the more
trivial accidents of life, which were
looked upon with undue alarm, and
cease to torment ourselves at every
turn with groundless f ears and nerv-.
ous fancies, while we still believe that
many secrets of Nature have been
solved to which we should give earnest
h(ied. Thus, while we may avoid walk-
ing under a ladder as much because
a brick dislodged from above may fall
upon our head, as from a ny dread of
bad luck to follow, we do not doubt
that there are many omens of more
eerious import to which we should at-
tend.
SECOND SIGHT
Foremost among such grave omens,
and nearest to the kindred realm of
dreams, is that indication of future
events which comes by which is known
as Second Sight.
A few years before his death Doctor
Johnson visited places in Scotland
where evidences of this mysterious
faculty were frequent, for the special
purpose of inquiring into the subject;
and the following extracts from his
account of it are full of interest:
"Second sight," he says, "is an im-
pression made either by the mind upon
the eye, or upon the eye by the mind,
by which things distant or future are
perceived and seen as. if they were
present. A man on a journey, far from
home, falls from his horse; another,
who i5> perhaps at work about the
house, sees him bleeding on the
ground, commonly with the landscape
of the place where the accident b efalls
him. Another seer, driving home h is
cattle, or wandering in idlen ess, or
musing in the sunshine, is suddenly
surprised by the appearance of a bridal
ceremony, or a funeral procession.
Things distant are seen at the instant
when they happen. The appearances
have .to depe nde nce upon choice; they
cannot be summoned, del:ained or re-
called. The impression is sudden, and
the effect often painful. I do not find
it to be true that nothing is presented
to the Second Sight but phantoms of
evll. Good seems to have the same
proportion in these visionary s cenes ::ts
it has in real life. That they should
often see death is to be expected, be-
cause death is frequ ent and important."
According to Martin, an early writer
on this subject, It is possible to some
extent to classify these visions, and so
to determine the time between the
sight and the event. If an object was
seen early in the morninig, the event
would take place in ::t few hours; if at
noon, the same day; if at night, it
would b e fulfilled weeks, m onths, and
sometimes years afterwards. The ap-
pearance of a shroud was a certain
sign of d eath; if it was not drawn
above the middle of the body, a delay
of a year m ight be hoped for, but if it
ascended high towards the head _the
mortal hour was close at hand.
"The visi on makes such a lively im-
pression upon the Seer s," says Martin,
"that they neither see nor think of
anything else as long as the vision
continues; their eyelids are uplifted,
and their eyes are staring so long as
the sigl1t can be seen."
NIGHT OMENS
Many methods have long been in use
for discovering what the future holds
in store in matters of love and mar-
riage. If young people would dr~am
of their lovers, l et them secure a p1ece
of the first cut of a "groaning cheese,"
a cheese made at the birth of a child
BOOK OF FORBIDDEN KNOWLEDGE 23
in any family, and place it under their
pillow. !f this should fail -let them
take a piece of cake made on a similar
occasion, and known as "dreaming
bread." Each inquirer must 19lace this
in the foot of the left stocking, and
throw ·it over the right shoulder, and
then retire to bed backwards, and in
perfect silence. If she falls asleep be-
fore midnight her future partner will
appear in her dream.
Yet another method is for anxious
maidens to write their names on slips
of paper at twelve o'clock, and to burn
these; then to gather the ashes care-
fully, and lay them, closely wrapped
in paper, upon a looking-glass marked
with a cross under their pillows. This
should make them dream of their
loves.
SALT-SPILLING
The spilling of salt is reckoned to
presage calamity, and particularly do-
mestic strife. To avert this it is cus-
tomary to fling a pinch of salt over the
left shoulder. A writer on this sub-
ject says: "To scatter salt by over-
turning the salt-cellar is very unlucky,
and portends a quarrel with a friend,
a broken bone, or other bodily misfor-
tune. This may be averted by throw-
ing a small quantity over the head."
Leonardo da Vinci, in his picture of
The Last Supper, has repres"ented the
traitor Judas overturning the salt-a
dark and ominous foreshadowing of
the betrayal of his Master. Salt has
long been esteemed a symbol of friend-
ship, probably because it is considered
incorruptible, but in the North it is
thought unlucky to put it on another
person's plate. Hence the saying-
"Help me to salt,
Help me to sorrow;"
but any evil consequences may · be
averted by a second helping.
Such are some of the principal omens
which clai'm credence from all who un-
derstand "that there are more things
in heaven and earth than are dreamed
of in our philosophy," and there are
many others to which we should give
heed, even though some of them seem
to be of little moment.
A STRING OF OMENS
The following are gathered from re-
liable sources; and are commended to
the consideration of those who have
"ears to hear."
Birthdays.-An old rhyme says of
our bir"thdays:
"Sunday's child is full of grace,
Monday's child is full in the face,
Tuesday's child is solemn and sad,
Wednesday's child is merry and glad,
Thursday's child is inclined to thiev-
ing,
Friday's child is free in giving,
Saturday's child works hard for his
l!ving."
Another version of this runs thus:
"Monday'3 child is fair of face,
Tuesday's child is full of grace,
Wednesday's child is full of woe,
Thursday's child has far to go,
Friday's child is loving and giving,
Saturday's child works hard for its
living;
But a child that is born on the Sab-
bath day
Is handsome and wise, and loving
and gay."
Clothes.-If you put on any of your
garments inside out, be careful not to
alter them, as by so doing you will
incur bad 1uck.
Crickcts.-Do not on any account dis-
turb a cricket in your house. Its pres-
ence is an omen of prosperity, and
foretells money that is coming to you.
Denth wntclt.-If you hear a clinking
sound in the wall ·of your hemse caused
by the little insect commonly called
the death-watch, regard it as a presage
of some discomfort, but not necessarily
of a death.
Enrs.-If your right ear tingles,
some . one is speaking well of you; if
your left ear, then ill is spoken. If you
run through the list of your friends
and acquaintances, the tingling will
cease as you name the person who is
speaking of you.
Knife or Fork.-If a knife, or fork,
or a pair of scissors falls from your
hand and sticks in the floor, it is a cer-
tain sign that visitors are coming to
call upon you.
Lady-birds.-A lady-bird is of simi-
lar omen.
Mngpies.-A single magpie seen out
of doors portends bad luck; two tell of
good fortune; three indicate a wedding,
and four a birth. Folk in the northern
counties say:
"One for anger, two for mirth,
Three for a wedding, four for a
birth."
Marringe.-A girl should never be
married in colors. A widow should not
marry in white. Among many happy
omens for brides are sunshine, and the
sneezing of a cat.
Martin11.-Martins nesting under your
eaves bring good luck if undisturbed.
May,---lThe month of May has been
considered an unlucky time for mar-
riages. Ovid in his "Fasti" declares ·
this time to be unpropitious for the
weddings of either widows or maidens,
and the modern warning runs-
"Marry in May, and you'll rue the
day."
Nails.-There is a time for every-
thing, and the following quaint lines
tell us when we should cut our nails-
"A man had better ne'er been born
Than have his nails on a Sunday
shorn.
Cut them on Monday, cut them for
health;
Cut them on Tuesday, cut them for
wealth;
Cut them on Wednesday, cut them
for news; · ·
24 BOOK OF FORBIDDEN KNOWLEDGE
Cut them on Thursday for a pair of
new shoes;
Cut them on Friday, cut them for
sorrow;
Cut them on Saturday, see your
sweethea;rt tomorrow."
New Moon.-A new moon on Monday
is a certain sign of fair weather and
good luck. If you see a new moon for
the first time over your right shoulder,
and form a wish, you may expect it to
be realized.
New Yeur.-When first you see or
eat anything new in the New Year, be-
fore speaking have a silent wish, and
say some poet's name distinctly, other-
wise your wishing will be vain.
Nlghtingule.-It is a happy omen for
lovers to hear the nightingale before
the cuckoo. In his "Sonnet to the
Nightingale" Milton says-
"Thy liquid notes that close the eve
of day,
First heard before the swallow cuc-
koo's bill,
Portend success in love."
Owls.-The continuous hooting of
owls in your trees is said to be an
omen of ill-health.
Pigs.-If you meet a sow coming to-
ward you, it is an excellent omen; but
should she turn from you, the luck is
lost.
Rubbits.-A rabbit running across
your path is an unfavorable sign.
Shoes.-It is considered unlucky to
put on your left shoe first.
Singing.-!! you sing before break-
fast you may expect bad news and sor-
row before night.
Spnrks.-A red spark on the wick of
a candle signifies a letter coming to
the person who sees it first.
Spider~.-Long-legged spiders are
harbingers of good fortune. A small
red spider-called sometimes a money
spinner-running over you, is a sign
of money coming to you. Do not in
any way disturb it.
Stars.-If you see a shooting star,
and are quick enough to form a wish
before it has vanished, you may be
sure that your desires will come to
pass.
Sto11.es or Pips.-If you have a num-
ber of fruit stones or pips on your
plate, think of a wish, and then count
the stones. If they are even, the omen
is favorable; if odd, it is the reverse.
'l'hrowing Old Sboes.-The common
custom of -throwing an old shoe after
a bride has a deeper ·meaning than the
belief that it will bring good luck. It
was originally the symbol of renun-
ciation of authority over ' her by her
father or guardian, and its transfer-
ence to her husband. This evidence
of a change of ownership is of very
anci':lnt date, and traces of it are to be
found in the Books of Ruth and Deu-
teronomy.
"rashing.-If you wash your hands
In the water which some other person
has just used, vou l'lhould first make
the sign of the cross over the water.
If you neglect this pre2aution there
-.ill be a quarrel between you.
'Veatber and Bees.-Bees are weath-
er-wise, and do not ·wander far from
their hive if storms are at hand.
HOW TO BE A
SPIRIT MEDIUM
The spirit-circle is the assembling
together of a given number of persons
for the purpose of seeking communion
with the spirits that h a ve passed away
from earth into the higher world of
souls. The chief advantage of such
an assembly is the mutual impartation
and reception of the combined magnet-
isms of the assemblage. These in com-
bination form a force stronger than
that of an isolated subject; first en-
abling the spirits to commune with
greater power; next, developing the
latent gifts of mediumship in such
members of the circle as a:re thus en-
dowed; and, finally, promoting that
harmonious and social spirit of frater-
nal intercourse which is one of the
especial aims of the spirits' mission.
The first conditions to be observed
relate to the persons who compose the
circle. These should be, as far as pos-
sible, of opposite temperaments, as
positive and negative in disposition,
whether male or female; also of moral
characters, pure minds, and not mark-
ed by repulsive points of either physi-
cal or mental condition. The physical
temperaments should contrast with
each other; but no person suffering
from a decidedly chronic disease, or of
a very d e bilitated physique, should be
present at any circle unless it is form-
ed expressly for healing purposes. I
would recommend that the number of
the circle never be less than three nor
more tha n twelve.
The use growing out of the associa-
tion of differing temperaments is to
form a battery on the principles of
electricity or galvanism, composed of
positive and negative elements, the
sum of which should be unequal. No
person of a very strongly positive tem-
perament or di s position should be
present, as any magnetic spheres em-
anating from the circle will over-
power that of the spirits, who must
always be positive to the circle in or-
d er to produce phenomena. It is not
desirable to have more than two al-
ready well-developed mediums in a
circle,as mediums always absorb the
magnetism of the rest of the party;
h ence, when there are too many pres-
ent, the force, being divided, cannot
operate successfully with any.
Of TelllJ)erature. - Never let the
apartment be overheated, or even
close. As an unusual a mount of mag-
netism is liberated at a circle, the
room is always warmer than it is ordi-
BOOK OF FORBIDDEN KNOWLEDGE 25
narily, and should be well ventilated.
Avoid strong light, which, by produc-
ing excessive motion in the atmos-
phere, disturbs the manifestations. A
very subdued light is the most favor-
able for any manifestations of a mag-
netic character, especially for spiritual
magnetism.
Of the Positions to Be Observed.-If
the circle is one which meets another
periodically, and is composed of the
sam e persons, let them occupy the
same seats (unless changed under spir-
itual direction), and sit ( as the most
favorable of all positions) around a
table, th ei r hands laid on it, with
palms downward. It is believed that
the wood, when charged, becom es a
conductor, without the necessity of
touching or holding hands. I should
always suggest the propriety of em-
ploying a table as a conductor, espe-
cially as all tables in a household use
are more or less magnetically charged
already. I! flowers and fruit are i.n
the room, see that they are just fresh-
ly gathered, otherwise remove them;
also avoid sitting in a room with many
minerals, metalg, or glasses, as these
all injurious ly effect sensitives, of
whom mediums are the type,
I recommend the seance to be op ened
either with prayer or music, voca l or
instrumental; after which subdued,
quiet and h a rmonizin~ conversation is
better than wearisome :silence ; but let
the conversation be always directed to-
ward the purpose of the gathering, and
never sink into disc u ssion, or rise to
emphasis; let it be gentle, quiet, and
spiritual, until phenomena begin to be
manifest. Always have a :slate, or pen,
pencil and paper on the table, so as
not to be obliged to rise to procure
them. Especially avoid all entering or
leaving the room, moving about, ir-
relevant conversation or disturbances
within or without the circle-room, a f-
ter the sea nce h as been once com-
m e n ced.
The spirits are far more punctual to
seasons, f a ithful to promise and peri-
odical in action than morta ls. Endeav-
or, then, to fi:x: your circle at a con-
venient hour, when you will be least
inter:cupted, and do not fail in your
appointments. Do not admit unpunc-
tual late cumers; nor, if possible, suf-
fer the air of the room to be disturbed
in any way after the sitting com-
mences. Nothing but necessity, indis-
position, or impressions (to be here-
after described) should warrant the
least disturbance of the sitting, which
should never exceed two hours, unless
an extension of time be solicited of the
spirits. Let the seance always extend
to one hour, even if no res ults are ob-
tained; it sometimes requires all that
time for spirits to form their battery
of the materials furnished. Let it be
also remembered that all circles are
experimental; hence no one should be
discouraged if phenomena are not pro-
duced after the first few sittings. Stay
with the same circle for six sittings;
if no phemonena are then produced
(provided all the above conditions are
observed) you may be sure you are not
r ightly assimilated to each other; you
do · not form the requisite combina-
tions, or neutralize each other. In that
case, break up, and let that circle of
m embers meet with other persons;
that is, change one, two, or three per-
sons of your circle for others, and so
on until you succeed.
A well developed test-medium may
sit without injury for any person of
any description of character or tem-
perament; but a circle sitting for mu-
tual development should never admit
persons addicted to bad habits, crimi-
nals, sensualists, strongly positive per-
sons of any kind, whether rude, skepti-
cal, viole nt-tempered, or dogmatical.
An humble, candid, inquiring spirit,
unprejudi ced, and receptive of truth, is
the only frame of mind in which to sit
for phenomena , the delicate magnet-
ism of which is shaped, tempered, and
m a de or marred as much by mental as
physical conditions. When once any of
the circle' can communicate freely and
co nclusively with the spirits, the spir-
its can a nd will take charge of and
r egulate the future movements of the
circle.
Of lmpressions.-Impressions are the
voices of spirits speaking to our spir-
its, or else the admonitions of the spirit
within us, and should always be re-
s pected and followed out, unless
(which is very rare) suggestive of ac-
tual wrong in act or word. At the
opening of the circle, one or more of
the members are often impressed to
change seats with others; one or more
impressed with the desire to withdraw,
or a strong fe eling of repulsion to
some member of the circle, makes it
painful to remain there. Let any or
all of these impressions be faithfully
regarded, and, at commencing, pledge
to each other the promise that no of-
fense shall be taken by following out
impressions.
If a strong impression to write,
speak, sing, dance, or gesticulate, pos-
sesses any mind pregent, follow it out
faithfully. It has a meaning, if you
cannot at first realize it. Never feel
hurt in your own person, nor ridicule
your neighbors, for any failure to ex-
press, or at first d iscover the meaning
of the spirits impressing. you.
· Spirit control is often deficient, and
at first almost always imperfect. But
by often yielding to it, your organism
becomes more flexible, and the spirit
more experienced; and practice in con-
trol is absolutely necessary for spirits
as well as mortals. If dark and evil-
disposed spirits manifest to you, never
drive them away, but always strive to
elevate them, and treat them as you
would mortals under similar circum-
stances. Do not always attribute faise-
26 BOOK OF FORBIDDEN KNOWLEDGE
hoods to lying spirits or deceiving me- '
diums. Many mistakes occur in the
communion of which you cannot al-
ways be aware.
Strive in truth, but rebuke error
gently; and do not always attribute it
to design, but rather to mistake in so
difficult and so experimental a stage
of the communion as mortals at pres-
ent enjoy the spirits.
Unless strictly charged by spirits to
do otherwise, do not continue to hold
sittings with the same parties for more
than a twelvemonth. After that time,
if not before, fresh elements of ma g-
netism are absolutely essential. Some
of the original circle should withdraw
and others take their place.
All persons are subject to spirit in-
fluence and spirit guidance and con-
trol, but not all can so externalize this
power as to use it consciously or_be
what is significantly called a medium;
and finally, let it be remembered, that
except in the case of trance-speakers
no medium can ever hope to exercise
successfully his or her gift in a large
or promiscuous assembly; while trance-
speakers, no less than mediums for any
other gift, can never be influenced by
spirits far beyond their own normal
capacity in the matter of the intelli-
gence rendered; the magnetism of the
spirit and the spirit-circle being but
a quickening fire, which inspires the
brain, stimulates the faculties, and,
like a hot-house process on plants,
forces in abnormal prominence dor-
mant or latent powers of mind, but
creates nothing. Even in the case of
merely automatic speakers, writers,
aping, tipping, and other forms of test
mediums, the intelligence or idea of
the spirit is always measurably shaped
by the capacity idiosyncrasies of the
medium. All spirit power is thus lim-
ited to expression by organism through
which it works; and spirits may con-
trol, inspire, and influence the human
mind, but do not change or recreate it.
SECRET METHOD OF
MESMERISM
HOW TO HYPNOTIZE
The method used to bring about
the hypnotic conditions consists essen-
tially in an imitation of the process
of ordinary sleep, by means of verbal
suggestion. Thus we actually bring
sleep into existence by acting upon
the imagination through action and
speech. The skill of the operator con-
sists in making the subject believe he
is going to sleep; that is all. It is
not necessary that he should possess
any peculiarity of temperament and
voice, as has been supposed. In short,
everything lies in the subject and not
in the operator. Impress upon your
subject the belief that what you say
is about to happen, will happen, and
you have paved the way to success.
Give your subject to understand that
you are perfectly competent to hyp-
notize him, and his imagination will
do the rest.
Assuming you are unable the get
a person who has been under the in-
fluence before, I will ask you to se-
cure a person (a stranger) who in
your judgement would be easily in-
fluenced,-not one of those stubborn,
over-confident know-it-all people,-
but one who would be willing to obey
your suggestions. The reason why
some people are difficult to hypno-
tize is because they either consciously
or unconsciously resist the operator's
influence. They are not passive. Those
between fifteen and twenty years o:f
age are more easily controlled.
Having secured your subject, place
him in a chair in a comfortable posit-
ion, preferably with his back to the
light. Before you commence to oper-
ate it will be well to observe certain
conditions. First, don't let anyone
talk or laugh in the room while you
are operating. Disturbing noises at the
first tend to prevent hypnosis. They
distract the attention, and thus inter-
fere with the mental state for hypno-
si.!!!. Later when you have, as well as
your subject, learned to concentrate
your thoughts, noises are less dis-
turbing.The most absolute avoidance
of any sign of mistrust by those is
necessary, as the least word or ges-
ture may thwart the attempt to hyp~
notize. Do not allow yourself to get
excited, as there is nothing whatever
to get excited about. Don't be afraid
that you will have any trouble in
awakening your subject as that is
the easiest part of it, and there is
absolutely no danger of being unable
to bring the subject out of the hyp-
notic condition if you follow strictly
BOOK OF FORBIDDEN KNOWLEDGE
· what' these lessons teach on the
~ubj e ct.
Having observed the above pre-
cauti )ns, you m ay now turn your at-
tention to hypnotizing your subject.
You have put him into a comforta ble
chair, and m a ke sure that he is com-
fortable. Shift him about until he is
resting easily, and say that he is
resting. You do this for effect. Every-
thing in this work d epends upon the
effect you produce upon the subject's
mind. Yo'if are not, while engaged in
this work, a man of original thoughts;
you are simply an actor, weighing tone
and gesture, testing the effect of a
glance, a sentence, a frown, a corn-
pression of the lips, a persuasive un-
bending; testing these things, weigh-
ing them, withdrawing them accord-
ing to results, even as the regular
physician tries and withdraws his
material r emedies according to results.
Before beginning your work as the
hypnotizer (no matter which method
you u~e), your subject is to look at
\vhatever you may request him to,
and Ray to him that very soon he will
become drowsy, then more and more
drowsy, until he will be compelled to
elose his eyes and sleep.Be sure to
tell him that he will notice nothing
unusual about the drowsiness; tell him
that it will be just as pleasant as the
approach to natural sleep that he has
eYer experienced. Let him not expect
anything unnatural to occur, for such
will di~tract his attention and make
him feel excited and less passive than
he should be. Let him understand that
it is for his good to be hypnotized if
he is sick, or to help him cure a bad
habit. Tell him that you will not make
him appear ridiculous, and that you
will only keep him asleep for a few
minutes. Tell him to look earnestly
at whatever you direct, and never
under any circumstances to look away
from it, no matter who comes into
the room or around him he is going
to gaze straight at the object and no
other.
METHOD No. 1.-Take any bright
object (I generally use my watch),
between the thumb and fore and mid-
dle fingers of the right hand. Be sure
that the light falls in the object in
your hand. Hold it from eight to
twelve inches from the eyes, at about
ten inches above the head so as to
-,roduce the greatest possible strain
upon the eyelids, and enable the sub-
ject to maintain a fixed steady stare
at the object. The subject's eyes must
be fixed steadily on the bright object,
and his mind riveted upon the idea of
the one object. When you notice the
first change in your subject's face and
eyes say such woras as these: "Keep
right on looking at it, directly you will
be drowsy. You are sleepy. Your
eyelids are heavy. You are asleep."
Let your voice grow lower, lower, till
just above a whisper. Pause a mo-
ment or two. Give him time. Never
hurry. You will fail if you try to
hurry too much at first. He will think
it more natural if you give him a
moment to get sleepy. Let him only
listen. As soon as the eyelids really
grow heavy, say: "Your eyes are al-
most closed now," making your words
long drawn out and spoken in a tone
which will not arouse him, but will,
instead, indicate that you are yourself
sleepy-and almost gone. Continue as
follows: "Directly your eyes will have
to close-you just cannot keep awake
-see they are closing-now they are
almost ready to close-now they will
close and you will sleep. Close thei;U."
Pause a nwment, then say: "Sleep."
Give the command to sleep in a quiet,
yet firm and masterful way, in a low
tone.
You will see that the eyelids may
quiver for a few seconds, sometimes
for a minute, but very soon the sub-
ject will settle back in his chair, fre-
quently with a sigh, and the eyes will
become quiet, and his limbs show per-
fect relaxation. Let him remain so for
some minutes, saying nothing to him
at all. When you are ready to operata,
it is well for you as a beginner, espe-
cially if you have a new subject, to
constantly make suggestions. For in-
stance, you say: "Nothing will wake
you, nothing can hurt you. You can
open your eyes, but you will stay
asleep. Now I am about to raise your
arm, ·but you won't wake up. Nothing
will wake you." Rub the arm a few
times and say: "Now you can't take
it down-see, you can't. You are
sound asleep, and you will do every-
thing I tell you to do, but -¥OU will
BOOK OF FORBIDDEN KNOWLEDGE
not wake up-you can't wake up till
I tell you."
The arm will remain in the position
in which it i:s placed, and if you tell
him that no person can take it down
or bend it, you will find it true that
no one can. I always begin operations
in this way, placing both arms in an
uplifted position, with both legs out-
stretched in the same manner. When
you are ready to take them down rub
them gently but firmly (rubbing from
the body, and always raunng the
hands when reaching the extremities).
and say: "Now you can take them
down-see, you can-you will do all
I tell you. You will have to do so. No
one can wake you except myself."
Speak to your subject just as though
he were awake and in full possession
of his senses. Although fast asleep to
every one else, he is keenly awake to
you. He went to sleep 'vvith his mind
absorbed with the idea that you alone
could control him, and this is the rea-
son why no one else· can make any
impression on him. This connection
between the subject and operator is
called rapport, which is a state of
sleep in which the attention of the
subject is fixE>d exclusively upon the
Hypnotist, so that the idea of him is
constantly present in the subject's
memory. It is possible, however, to
put your subject en-rapport with any
other person by simply suggesting to
him to he is to obey the requests or
demands of that person until further
notice.
1\-IETBOD No. 2.-The subject re-
clines on a couch or easy chair, and
you stand beside him. Hold the first
two fingers of your right hand at a
distance of about twelve inches from
his eyes, at such an angle that his
gaze shall be directed upwards in a
strained manner. Direct him to look
steadily at the tips of those fingers,
and to make his mind as nearly blank
as possible. After he has stared fixed-
ly for about half a minute his ex-
pression will undergo a change-a far
away look coming into his face. His
pupils will contract and dilate several
times, and his eyelids will twitch
spasmodically. These signs indicate a
commencement of the desired hyp-
notization. If the eyes do not close
of themselves, shut them gently with
your left hand, and say: "You are be-
coming sleepy; your eyes are very
heavy; they are getting more and
more heavy; my fingers seem quite
indistinct to you (this when the pu-
pils are observed to dilate or con-
tract); a numbness is stealing over
your limbs; you will be fast asleep in
a few minutes; now sleep."
This is a good method to use with
children, and if they are hypnotized
for any special reason hold their right
hand with your left while talking to
them.
1\'IETHOD No. 3.-Seat your subject
if convenlent in an ordinary chair
(not an arm or rocking chair), with
both feet flat upon the floor. Place his
hands on his thighs with th e palms
down, the fingers pointed towards the
knees. Then, standing three or four
feet in front of him, request him to
r elax as much as possible, mentally
and physically. Then say to him:
"Look at one of my eyes," and draw
his attention with the index finger of
your right hand to the eye you wish
him to look at. Lower your hand im-
mediately to your side, and gaze di-
rectly a nd steadily into one of your
subject's eyes until his pupil begins
to dilate. This will r equire from five
to ·ten seconds. Then repeat slowly
the following: "Close your eyes gently
-arch your eye-brows. Now you will
find it hard to open your eyes. Try-
try-try! All right, you may open
them." Relax all tension in yourself
when you say "All right." You must,
of course, feel confident that you can
hold his eyes closed for a few seconds.
Your manner and tone should be such
as to convince him that you can do so.
As soon as you see that you have pro-
duced an impression at once rele::tse
your subject for a moment. This will
prevent his forming adverse auto-sug-
gestions which might destroy the
slight impressions already made. Af-
ter a moment's rest, repeat the opera-
tion, saying again: "Look at one of
my eyes. Close your eyes gently," and
so on, just as before. From the mo-
ment you commence keep up a stream
of . oral suggestions, and repeat the
above over and over again until you
are quite sure your subject is under
your influence.
How To PerEorm The Daven·
port Brothers' "Spirit
Mysteries"
The "manifestations" of the Davenport
Brothers are produced in eitheil' a. cabinet or
a darkened room, and in no instance while
the operato1·s are in full view of the au-
dience.
In a darkened room their "manifestations"
moRtly consist of the thrumming (without
mu,ric) of guitars, ringing the bells, rattling-
of tambourines, fltc., while at the same time
the instruments are moved-as indica.ted by
the sounds from them-with considerable
rapidity about the room. The same sounds
and movements also occur to a limited ex-
tent after the operators have been bound by
a committee from the aud;enee, the reintro-
duction of light disclosing them still in bonds
as plaeed by the commiitee. They u sually
axtricate themselves from the tying after the
light is again extinguished, in less time than
the colllimitt.ee ocet:pied in binding them.
During their entertainment the>y are also
bound with ropes by what they assume to
be a spirit power, without mortal assistance.
To all appearance the tying done by "the
spirits" is as methodical and secure as any
that a rr..ortal could do. Yet the very in·
stant that darkness supervenes, after the
knots h ave been exa.mined by the committee,
the musical instrumen ts are sounded, and
various "manifestations" made that could
not possibly be accomplished w;thout the use
of hands: immedit.tely on the CBssation of
which light is produced, and the "mediums"
are ascertained to bfl bound as they were
before the extinction of the lig-ht. Some-
t-imeR, while he is thns sitnated, one of the
mediums will have his coat 1"€moved from
his body in a few seconds' time.
A performance of the Davenports, which
many spiritualists have asserted to be an in-
dubitable evidence of the exercise of spirit
power. is as follows: One of them sits with
his right side to the table on which the
instruments are lying. The other takes a
seat beside, and at the left of the one at
thg table. An investigator sits in f1·ont of
the mediums, and puts a h and on the bead
of each: and, reaching up, each medium puts
his hands, in separate places. but close to-
fi~~eris 0
~x~~g~i~~eX.f !~~ i~~~~~ga~~·~· m~~
on the instruments, the latter being moved,
and perhaps brought in contact with the
investigator's head. That gentleman is not
conscious of any change in the position of
the mediums. Their hands seem to him to
remain constantly clasped to his arms, in
which position they are found to be when
tho light is again produced.
The mysterious cabinet in which the
Davenports gi ve their public exhibitions is
about six feet high, six feet wide, and two
and a h alf fee t deep, the front cunsisting of
three doors opening outward. In each end
ts a seat with holes through which the ropes
can be pasf>fld in securing the performers. In
the uprJer part of the middle door · is a
lozenge-shaped aperture. curtained on the in·
side with black muslin or oil cloth. The
bolts are on the inside of the door.
As preliminary to the "manifestations,"
and in order that it may not be supposed
that they are the operators, the mediums sub-
mit to being bound by a committee from
the audience. The doors are tht:n closed and
bolted, it being necessary for the mortal
manager to r~ach through the aperture to
secure the middle door. A tremendous racket
is soon made in the cabinet, the noise of the
musical instruments being combined with a
~f~er;
1
th~b;~J"ie~~l~~i~k rh!.~
0
a~e~i~~ciis0
h
the sound of a cloven hoof kicking things
around inside the structure which encloses
the mediums.
Usually, after the first performance, the
doors of the <>abinet are opened, and the
committee requested to observe that the op-
erators are still bound; but sometimes there
is an interval just before the opening of the
door, in which a rattling of the ropes is
hearcl., and then the mediums walk forth.
free. If they are observed by the ce>mmitte~
before the roves are removed f1·om them, the
doors are again closed till the untying is ac-
complished.
Being again enclosed in thfl cabinet, the
young men are bound by what they assert
to be l:', spirit power. during t,be exercise of
which they are passive. The ''spirit tying"
is submitted for exarni.nation to the com-
mittee, by whom it is pronounced to be ap·
parently so secure as to preclude the pos·
sibility of the mediums being able to use
their hands. No sooner are the doors closed,
however, than h 'lnds are seen at the aperture
in the middle door. These bands are visible
for but an instant at a time, and with a
rapid vibratory movement while in view, so
tha t it would not be possible for the ob·
server to identify them as belonging to the
medium!l. however posit.iYely he might be·
lieve them to be theirs.
Immediately on the disappearance of the
hands from the aperture, the cabinet doors
are opened, and the committee, after an ex-
amination, report the mediums to be still
bound. The doors are again closed, and in-
stantly "the spirits" strike up a lively tune
on a violin, with a bell and tambourine ac·
companiment.
That the audience may be still more pro-
foundly impressed with the wonderful powers
of the young men, they sometimes request
that flour be placed in their hands, as a
seeurity, in addition to the "spirit tying,"
against their being 'l.ble to use those members.
Their request being complied with, a band or
two is shown at the apertc.re, some noises are
made on the musical instruments, and then
the mediums exhibit the flour still in their
hands. with none spilled on their clothing or
the fioor.
Sometimfls they permit one of the com·
mittee to sit in the cabinet with them, for
a short time, while they are bound, but be,
too, must be bound, with his right hand se-
cured to one medium's shoulder, and his left
hand to the other medium's knees. The lights
in the hall are then turned down so that it
is quite dark in the cabinet. The gentleman
in contact wHh the mediums is banged over
the head with an instrument of music, his
hair is pulled, his nose tweaked, and alto-

position, and perhaps looking somewhat scar-
ed, bq. reports to the audien.:)C what has been
done to him, with the additional statement
that he did not detect any movement on tho
part of the mediums. "If not the manifesta-
tion of SPirit power, what is it?" is a question
which very naturally arises in the minds of
those present. An answer is contained in the
followmg explanatione:
In a darkened room, the investigators be·
ing seated by the walls, the mediums g:rasv
the guitars by the neck. next ele keys, and
swing them around, and thrust them into
different parts of the open space of the room,
at the same time vibrating the strings of the
instruments with the forefinger. The faster
the finger vasses over the strings, the m':lre
rapidly the instrument see ms to move. Two
hands c<~.n thus use a& m~ny guitars, and a
tea-bell, clasped by the little finger of either
hand, can be rung at the same time. Or one
performer can sound a guitar and bell with
one hand, and play an accordion or con-
certina with the other, an end of the last
named instrument being held under the arm
against the body. In the darkness the audi-
ence thinks the instruments go fru·thur than
they really do: and the room being close, the
sounds are echoed or reflected from the walls.
When an investigator is sitting with the
mediums at a table whereon musical instru-
ments are lying, his hands resting on their
heads, and their hands claaped to his arm
above the elbow, the medium next the table
removes one hand from the arm without be-
Ing detected, simply because the presence of
the other hand, which is nearer the shonlder,
is so great ae to cut off communication by
means of the nerves of sensation from the
arm below. It is thus impossible for the
investigator to determine whether both hands
of the mediUlll are on his arm or not. He
thinks they are, because the sensation in his
arm remains the same. In the first place.
the left hand of the medium is put heavily
on the arm next the shoulder, and the right
hand quite lightly, close by the other next
the elbow. Both hands are seen to be on the
arm, and are preeumed to be pressing with
equal force. The light il3 extinguished, and
perhap3 the medium taltes the man'.;. atten-
tion momentarily from his arm. by suggest-
Ing that their feet IJe placed ir:; contact; then
it is that with a gradually increased pressure
of his left hand the rnedium carefully re-
moves his right hand, and while he preserves
a rigidity of the museles of his neck and bacl;:,
so as not to move his h ead, he tal,es the guitar
(which lies within reach) by the neck, and
extending the body of the instrnment as far
as possible, moves it in a half-circle, vibrat-
ing the strings with his fore-finger. That
the demonstration may be more striking, per-
h:ws he hits the guitar against the h ead of
the man with whom he is in contact. If he
wisl1es to ring a bell at the same time, he
can hold it with his little finger. He can
sound, in turn. all the instruments lying on
the table: then, carefully replacing his hand
on the man's arm, he is ready to have a light
produced. The other medium really holds on
with both hands to the arm he has clasped,
feeling sure that while he does so it cannot
be interfering with the operations of "the
spirits" at the table.
. Should the medium put his right hand on
top of the extended thumb of his left hand,
with an appearance. to the investigator. of
both hands being on his arm, the same re-
sults could be produced with less risk of rle·
tection; for the presence of the thumb. where
the right hand was seen to be, would lead
the investigator to sum>ose. in the dark11ess,
that the hand was still there.
If in their dark seance, phmmhorns having
been put on the instruments, you sho1lld see a
phosphoresent light very far above the stage,
you may take it that the instrument which
is heard is not where the light is seen, but
that the phosphorns has been rubbed from the
instruments, and some other put on a piece
of card-board, which is atta~hed to a folding
rod and elevated in the darlmess, to the de-
sired position.
To the Davenports. the extrics.tion of them-
selves, after being bound by a committee. is
a brief and easy tasl,. A simple "twist of
the wrist" will convert a "square knot," us-
ually conshlered the most secure. into two
"half-hit.ches," through which the part of the
rope they enclooe can be easily slipped. With
e~, little sla<:k in the rope any ordinary knot
can be made into a ''slip-knot.'' It is hardly
possible to bind a man without causing h1m
pain, so that he cannot get a "slack" in the
rope. The writer has been bound v<'ith ropes
a great many times by people who were de-
termined to mako a "good job" of tne tyiPg,
and not once has he failed to release himself,
often in less time than was occupied in bind-
ing h im.
After the Davell'ports have been bound in
their cabinets by a committee. and the dool'li
of the st1·ucture are closed, they immediate-
ly set to work to loosen the knots next their
wrista and extricate their hands. which they
usually succeed in doing iil a short space o:t
time. In some instances one of them will
have a hand at liberty as soon as the middle
door is bolted. which he exhibits at the aper-
ture. to be followed shortly by other hands;
then both the mediums do their "level best"
in making- a noise with such instrumentil as
they have a t hand. Speedily getting their
hands back in the ropes and drawing thc:-
knot.s close to their. wrists, t.hey make some
adclitiona:i noise with one or two instruments
which they had so placed as to be still within
their reach. and then give a signal for the
opening of the doors. The knots are examin-
ed b;v the committee and :reparted to be "the
s:otm.e as they were;" the doors are again
closed and the operatives release themselves
entirely uom the ropes, untying every knot.
Sometimes, after being tied by the com-
mittee, the mediums cannot readily extricate
their bands and g·et them back as they were,
in which case they do not hc.ve the doors open
till all the knots are untied, it being a better
policy :for them to wait till "the spirits" have
tied them before making a show of hands or
tortru·ing the musical instruments.
The important point with the Davenports.
in tying themselves, is to have a knot next
their wrists that loQks solid, "fair and
square," but which at the same time will
admit of being slipped, so that they can get
their hands out in a moment. There are
seve1·al ways in which such a knot can be
formed, one of which is as follows: A square
knot is loosely tied in the middle of a rope,
then the ends of the rope are . tucked through,
in opposite directions, below the knot. and
the lat.ter is then drawn tight. There are
then two loops, which are left just large
er:;ough for the passage of the hand through
them. The ends of the rope are then put
through the holes in the seat. and tied be-
neath, and also to the feet. Lastly the hands
are put through the loops, and the lmot
drawn close to the wrist. coming between
the latter. No novice in tying would suspect
from the appearance of S'.lCh a knot. and
without taking particular pains in tradng the
directivn of the rope in forming- it, that it
could be slipped. As the hands of the
mediums when thus tied are at their backs,
clore to the end of the cabinet, the commit-
tee cannot have a very good opporunity to
observe the most important lmot.
The doors next the ends of the cabinet are
first closed by the manager, and as the medi-
ums are then con<'ealed from view of the audi-
ence, they strain open the loops and are ready
to use their hands as soon as the middle door
is closed, which one of them instantly bolts
on the inside. Then their hands are thrur;t
under the curtain, which h a ngs over the
aperture in the door. and exhi bited to the
:~di~~~ibu~~t b~t f~~fo:~ i~t:t~e:!"i ~rea ~fm~~
and with a vibratory motion of them ; other-
wie.e they might be recognized as belonging to
the mediums. To make the h ands look large
or small, they spread or press together the
fingers. With that pel!'.lliar motion impart-
ed to them, four hands at the aperture will
appear to be half a dozen, or more, as two
penn:ies, rubbed together betrween the balls
of a pc..·son's thumbs, will present what ap-
pear to be the edges of three.
A lady's flesh-()olored kid glove, nicely stuff-
ed with cotton, has sometimes been exhibited
a.s the hand of a fema,le spirit--a critical
observation of it not being allowed.
These mediums once exhibited what they
doubtless supposed would look like the hafld
of a negro; but it was of uniform bladmess,
palm and all. At one of their entertainments,
when, in addition to the exhibition of "spirit
hands." a naked arm was protruded from the
aperture an old lady, who, on a~ount of the
dimness of her vision, was permitted to stand
clo1e by the cabinet, saw, notwithstanding
her defective sight, what made h er exclaim,
"Well, I declare! They must practice vn.cciH-
ation in the other world, for J see marke of
it on that spirit . arm!" When the "spirit
arm" was shown at another time. rope marks
were seen on the wrist ! -
It takes theRe mediums but a few seconds
to get their hanO.s hack into loops, a nd draw
the knots close to their wrists, r eady to be
examined by the committee.
In malting the music, one medium ho~cJ.fl
the vlolin in the manner usual with most
players of that instrument, and with the little
fl.ng·er of the bow hand he clasps a bell, which
rings in time with the music. The other
medium b~ats the tambourine on his head or
knees with one hand, while his other h a nd i:s
eng3,bed in maiting a noise on something else.
The performances of these young men are
interesting on accou"1t of the ingenuity and
expertness exercised by them, and would ll'Jt
be ln the least obiedionable were it not for
their pretended "mediumship."
Electrical Psychology
The most easy, sure and direct mode to
produce electro psychological communication
is to take the individual by the hand, in the
same manner as t1;!ough you were going to
shake hands. Press your thumb with moder-
ate force upon the ulnar nen·e, which spreads
its branches to the ring and little finger. The
pressure should be l'!early an inch above the
knuckle, and in range of the ring finger. Lay
the ball of the thumb fiat and particularly
crosswise so as to cover the minute branches
of this nerve of motion and sensation. When
you first take him by the hand, request him
to place his eyes upon yours, and to k eep
them fixed, so that he may see every emotion
·of your mind expressed in the countenance.
Continue this pressure for a half a min•.1te
or more. Then request him to close his eyes,
and with your fingers gentl:" brush downwarcl
several times over the eyelids, as though
fastening them firmly together. Thro;.Jghout
the whole process feel within yourself a fixed
determination to close them, so as to express
that determination fully in your countenance
and manner. Having done this, place YG UI'
hand on the top of his head and press your
thumb firmly on the organ of Indivi'duality,
' bearing oartia.lly downward, and with tha
other thumb still pressing the umar nerve, tell
him-you. can not OPNI your e;yes! Remem-
ber, that your manner, your expre<;sion ot
countena nce, youi' motions and yoi.lr !anguage
must all be of the most pcsitive cb.aracter.
If h e EUcceed in ovening his eyes, try it once
or twice more, because impressions, whether
physical or mental, continue to deepen by rep-
etition. In cae.e, however, that you cannot
close his eyes, nor see any effect produced
upon them, you should cease making any
further efforts, because ycu have now fairly
tested tha t his mind and body both s~ and in
positive relation as it regards the doctrine of
impressions. If you su~ceed in closing th•3
subject's e~'es by the above mode, you may
then request him to put his h ands on his
h ead, or in any position you choose, and tell
him, you can not stir them! In case you
succeed, request him to be seated, and tell
him, you can not risez If you are successful
in this, requ est him to put his hands in
motion, and teil him, you can not stop them I
If you succeed, request him to walk the
floor, and tell him, you can not cease walk-
ing! And so you may continue to perform
C<Xperiments involving muscular motion and
paralysis of any kind that m ay occur to the
mind, till you can completely control him,
in arresting or moving all the voluntary parts
of his system.
How To Make Persons At A
Distance Think Of You
Let it, be p articularly remembered that
"F'aith" and conet\ntration of thought are
positively needful to accomplish aught iu
dt·awing others to you or' mak ing them thin];:
of you. If YO'.l have not the capacity or
understanding how to operate an electrie
telegraph t~a ttery, it is no proof that an ex-
pert a.nd competent person should fail doing
so; iur. t so in this case; if faith, meditation,
m concentration of thought fail you, then
will you also fail to operate upon others.
First. you must h ave a yearning for the per-
f"Oll you wish to make think of you; and
secm~dly, you must learn to guess at what
time of day or night he may be unemployed,
passive, so that he be in a, proper state to
receive the thought which you dispatch to
him. If h 9 should be occupied in any way,
so tha t lHs nervous forces were needed to
comple te his task, h;s "HumaTI Battery," or
thought. would not be in a recipient or pas-
sive condition, therefore your experiment
would fail at that moment. Or if he were
under h eavy narcotics, liquors, tobacco. O'l'
gluttonous influences, he could not be reached
at such moments. Or, if he were asleep,
and you operated to affect a wakeful mind
or thought, you would fail again at the mo-
ment. To make a person at a distance think
of you, whether you are acquainted with him
or not, matters not;· I again repeat, find out
or guess at what moment he is likely to be
passive: by this I mean easy and careless;
t.hen, with the most fervent prayer, or yearn-
ing of your entire heart, mind, soul, and
strength, desire he may think of you; and
if you wish him to think on any p2,rticular
topic in relation to you, it is necessary for
you to press your hands, when operating on
him, on su:;h mental faculties of your head
as you wish him to exercise towards you.
This demands a meagre knowledge of Phreno·
l0gy. His "Feeling Nature" or "Propensi-
ties," you cannot reach through these opera-
tions, but when he once thinks of you, (if
he does not know you be imagir..es such a

that is if no accident or very unfavorable

towards you, and when he comes within sight,

to manage him.
How To Charm Those Whom
You Meet And Love
When you desire to make any one "Love"
you with whom you meet, although not per-

readily reach him and make his acquaintance,
if you observe the foregoing instructions, in
addition to the following directions: Sup-
pose you see him coming towards you in an
unoccuPied mood, or he is recklessly, or pas-
sively walking past you, all that remains for
you to do at that moment is to concentrate
your thought and send it into him as before

was passive, he will look at you, and now is

gently, though firmly , between the bones of
the thumb and forefinger of his hand, and
at the very instant when you press thus on

own purified, Christian, and loving taste.
Writing On The Am~
The conjuror's explanation was a great
lesson in ''spiritualism." I next asked him
to elucidate the trick of writing on the arm.
On the occasion of my visit to Mr. Forster,
when the rap1:1 indicated the second pellet, he
required the "spirit" present to write the
initials on his bare arm. Mr. Forster placed
his arm under the table for a moment, then
rested it in front of a lamp burning on the
t.able, and quickly rolled up the sleeve of his
coat. The stu n wa!! without stain or mark.
He passed his hand over it once or twice,
and the ir..itials of the names 1 had written
on the second pellet seemed to grow on the
arm ln letters of crimson. "It's a trick I do
every night. It goes with the audience like
steam," sai.d the conjuror. "Very simple.
Well, suppose a name. ·what name would
you lill:e?" "Henry Clay," I replied. Down
went the conjuror's arm under the table. In
a few seconds he raised it and C\KPOsed the
bare forearm without mark upon it. He
doubled up his fist tightly so as to bring ·the
muscles of the arm to the surface, and rub-
bed the skin smartly with his open hand.
The lette:-g "H. C." soon appea:-ed upon it
in well-deftned writing of a deep red color.
"There you have it, ~rentlemen; that's the
blood-red writing. Very simple. All you
have to do is to take a lucifer-match, and
write on your arm with the wrong end of
it. If you moisten the skin with a little
salt water first, all the better. Then wet
the palm of the other hand, rub your arm
with it. Send up the muscles and the blood-
red writing will come out. It will fade away
in less than no time. If you look under
the tahle, you will Ree that I have a. little
piece of pointed wood. I can move my arm
under that and write the letters without
