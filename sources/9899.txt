  		              		Experience Description   

    On March 5, 1988, I was in an auto accident. I think I was announced dead at the scene.
  
  I was watching everything from above. I saw my body covered with blood and people were trying to take my body out of the crashed car. Everything I’m going to write here is beyond describing because  I just can’t describe it right with words.
  
  I was surrounded completely in bright light. It was such a peaceful, warm feeling that others on earth can’t even imagine.  It was such a lovely color, just like the colors of a rainbow but much brighter and unbelievable.   I was in a place surrounded with scenery like hills or green areas.  I  could hear a very soft music, like  something I've never heard  before.
  
  I don’t know how long I was there; I only know that I woke up in the hospital with complete memory loss for few days.  I sustained a major head injury that  still shows on the right side of my face and behind my ear. There was a partial memory loss for about three to four months and there are things which have gone completely and never came back to this day.
  
  My mom and wife were there by  my bedside when I woke up in the hospital. I didn’t know them in the beginning and I didn’t know where I was at.  According to my wife, I kept asking the same questions over and over, such as 'Where am I?&quot; They would tell me and I would forget the answer and then ask again.    The hospital is probably 20-30 minutes away from the highway where I had the accident. They had contacted my brother to come to attend my funeral. He was serving in a city around 180 Km from the hospital I was in. When he arrived, I was already back to life.

  How did your highest level of consciousness and alertness during the experience compare to your normal everyday consciousness and alertness?        More consciousness and alertness than normal.   Everything I felt was so real. Although it has been over 32 years ago, I’m still living that experience in detail.

Were your thoughts speeded up?         No  

  Did time seem to speed up or slow down?         Everything seemed to be happening at once; or time stopped or lost all meaning.     I was  confused of what was happening. I didn’t know where I was and what was happening. I didn't understand  why  I could see my body from above, covered with blood, but I was not feeling any pain.
  
Were your senses More vivid than usual?         More vivid than usual  

  Please compare your vision during the experience to your everyday vision that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.       Better vision during the experience.  I was able to see everything so clear from above, where I was floating.  
  
  Please compare your hearing during the experience to your everyday hearing that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.      I think it was perfect because I was hearing  very beautiful music. I have never heard anything more beautiful and it was very real and clear.

  Did you seem to enter some other, unearthly world?         A clearly mystical or unearthly realm.     I was in a place where I felt very welcomed and like I belonged there.  I was  surrounded by very beautiful colors.  I was in an area surrounded by bright green hills that were  so beautiful that I don’t know or can’t find words to describe it. I heard  lovely, beautiful music.  
  
  What emotions did you feel during the experience?         I can't fully describe the feelings of being welcomed with a warm, peaceful feeling. It felt like home and I still miss that place

  Did scenes from the future come to you?         Scenes from my personal future.      I felt myself and my wife as  we got older but not in a very clear picture. Sometimes, but rarely, I can know  what will happen  before it happens.
  
Did you come to a border or point of no return?         No     

God, Spiritual and Religion:       

What was your religion prior to your experience?      Christian- Catholic     

Have your religious practices changed since your experience?         No       

What is your religion now?         Christian- Catholic     

  Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was both consistent and not consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience.     My belief in a Catholic god is love, and I did felt complete love on the other side.  
  
  Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         Yes      I’m Catholic and believed in God, but now I’m certain God exists and that God is a loving God. I don’t care much about money any more. I  feel it’s a vehicle I need in life; nothing more. I love people, help them and other creatures. This the most important thing in life.  
  
Did you seem to encounter a mystical being or presence, or hear an unidentifiable voice?         No     

Did you see deceased or religious spirits?         No  

Did you encounter or become aware of any beings who previously lived on earth who are described by name in religions (for example: Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, etc.)?         No     

During your experience, did you gain information about premortal existence?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about universal connection or oneness?         No       

  During your experience, did you gain information about the existence of God?         Yes     I felt the existence of love,  belonging, and a welcoming home.  I didn’t feel or see any shape but the feeling was so real and felt so true. I felt that I was with God or the creator.  
  
Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:       

  During your experience, did you gain special knowledge or information about your purpose?      Uncertain.   Sometimes,  I can feel people (not judging) if they are honest or hiding something.  I would say 99% of my feelings are accurate. With  some people when I’m talking or  even when I meet them for the first time,  I can feel or expect what they would say or know how they will behave.  
  
During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?         No       

  During your experience, did you gain information about an afterlife?         An afterlife definitely exists.          I was there and could see everything from above. I had that feeling of belonging, peace and love.  I also heard the music. I saw my body and people at the scene from above, which means I was a separate life up there so, definitely  there is another life after death.  
  
Did you gain information about how to live our lives?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about life's difficulties, challenges and hardships?         No       

  During your experience, did you gain information about love?         Yes     So much love that is beyond description. I was  surrounded by love, like living only love and nothing else.  
  
  What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         Large changes in my life.     I’m not afraid of death whatsoever. I do miss this place sometimes (a lot). Although, I love my family but I miss  the place I was in and I know this might seem very selfish, but it’s the reality.  I love all people and love to help them. I become very passionate and feel people suffering.   I love animals, trees, and nature.  I noticed, I don’t enjoy eating meat. Although, even before my experience, I didn’t care a lot about meat  
  
  Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          Yes  I love to help others but I feel I have more love toward everyone now.  I can’t  hate anyone, even if they treat me badly.  
  
After the NDE:       

  Was the experience difficult to express in words?        Yes   It was such a wonderful feeling,  being warm and surrounded by  love. It is beyond words because I have never felt something more beautiful.  If I was given the choice, I would never choose to come back. I do enjoy living the moment with my family but there is always something missing.  
  
  How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  I still remember every simple detail of my  experience, despite not being able to  describe it. I remember every single detail like it happened just now.  
  
  Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         Uncertain.     Not sure other than ability to feel people.  I do believe I have something else to work on or improve now after ignoring this for so long. 
  
  Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          Yes I’m sure of the existence of loving God and my belief in the existence of other life. I am  sure more beautiful and meaningful than our existing life.  
  
  Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Uncertain    Not always, because a lot of people don’t understand me. Only recently, did  I meet another person who had a similar experience. She explained to me a lot of things including your website and then encouraged me to write, and seek help and advice.  
  
Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       No     

  What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real.     I just felt very thing was so real and I can remember all details  
  
What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real       

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       No
