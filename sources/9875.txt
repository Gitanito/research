  		              		Experience Description:   

  					  I'm at work right now, so I can't in as much detail as I (you) would like. Short story: I was free diving (no diving gear) through lava tubes in Hawaii. I took a wrong turn and got lost/stuck in an underwater cavern. I was under water for around fifteen minutes, pulled out by another diver, and resuscitated by a bystander. Several of my friends and a few strangers witnessed this.
