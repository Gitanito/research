but governments can&#39;t die
so we need to find other incentives for
bureaucracy to adapt
and improve
the technology revolution has
transformed organizations across the
private sector
but not ours not fully
not yet
we are as they say
uh tangled in our anchor chain
our financial systems are decades old
according to some estimates we cannot
track 2.3 trillion dollars in
transactions well you don&#39;t just have
two three ten trillion dollars vanish
there&#39;s a whole system in place and it
comes from many different budgets
and then a big part of the funding comes
from private endeavors
so it isn&#39;t just government it&#39;s private
and government
together so i call this a hybrid entity
that&#39;s neither
strictly government nor strictly private
and interestingly from a secrecy point
of view as a private entity corporate or
citizen penetrate these projects oh it&#39;s
top secret national security most of the
work being done on this are private
corporations northrop raytheon the old e
systems eg g and they&#39;ll say oh it&#39;s
proprietary
you see so if you come from the
government it&#39;s proprietary if you come
from corporate or civilian it&#39;s top
secret government so they kind of wall
it off they play that game
it&#39;s like the truman show if you look at
that old show
jim carrey is playing this guy who his
whole life is raised in this sort of
fake set and wakes up one day and
realizes
my whole life has been this staged thing
so i think most people don&#39;t realize
we&#39;re living in in somebody&#39;s big truman
show here
the controllers i call them uh who who
orchestrate these things
and so we kind of have to go well we
need to have that jim carrey moment
where we kind of wake up
and realize
you know we&#39;ve been in a crazy truman
show here for 70 years since world war
ii
and
get real and that&#39;s what we need to do
