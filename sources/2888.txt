Criticizes an article by Prof. Wesley Raymond Wells

Wells’ adolescent conﬂict precluded him from cor

seeing "sublimation” as a problem of psychic evolution.

(no. 3) :159-168 :May-June, 1922.
The chief diﬁiculty is the psychologic imperative of
religious psychologists. That and the mystic's self-inter
pretation, both need to be judged by an evolutionary stand
ard of desires and of mental processes. Psychologists
with even a mild erotophobia are incompetent for the
psychogenetic study of religious experiences.

From the psycho-genetic viewpoint the truth of re

THE PSYCHOLOGY OF RELIGION
of "universal love" or of “God”, is an erotic ecstacy,
which for the moment precludes all consciousness of ob
jectives, or of personal limitation. This psychologic in
hibition imposes the same unawareness of relations to
objectives as that which is, by the physical conditions,
imposed upon the prenatal psyche. Describes the mental
mechanism by which such inhibitions produce the illusion
of experiencing God.

r’NTELLECTUAL SLAVERY
BY THEODORE SCHROEDER
To permit the limitation of mental freedom
Concedes power to create every other slavery
since only those of high intelligence as to free
men's rights can know and so love liberty as to
make possible the overthrow of any tyranny.
Censorship fosters all the horrors of every serf
dom. lt precludes the intelligence necessary to
peaceful revolutions and by the same ignorance
makes revolutions by violence more bloody in
method and less useful in consequences. It is the
surest method of prolonging legalized injustice,
the strongest chain for slaves, the chief support
of a "bloody Tzar" and of the more subtle, in
direct and therefore more dangerous tyranny of
majorities. it is the slimy ooze in which germi
nates the prudish purulence of our puritan
"
morals" and is the creator of "moralists" for
revenue who easily develop into professional per
jurers and spy-provocateurs. Tyrant-wrongs and
rebel-vengence will continue their vicious round
until our minds are freed from conventions tra
ditions, superstitions and statutes, until we are
permitted to hear all and read all that unrestrain
ed minds are willing to offer and until we our
selves are desirous to know all, free to believe all
and encouraged to express all that we believe or
feel Liberty by permission is slavery; only tyrants
and slaves live where any sane adult can be
precluded from receiving even the most odious
opinion—about the most obnoxious subject
expressed in the most offensive manner-by the
“Wit despised person.

INTELLECTUAL HOSPITALITY
BY THEODORE SCHROEDER.
To have some intelligent appreciation of how
much of the knowable is yet unknown, conduces
to that humility which is the beginning of Wis"
dom. To know something of the past struggles
for human progress conduces to an appreciation
of how little is probably true of what we think
we know. Thus to see our attainments in their
true relations to past beliefs and their probable
relation to future knowledge conduces to a true
measure of our great ignorance. To have this
‘is
to be without censure, because without a
stupid pride. To love truth more than our vain
predispositions; to love harmlessness of life more
than moral sentimentalism; to be free from
phariseeism, because knowing the diversity and
uncertainty of standards; to be unafraid of new
evidence, and unoppressive toward new allega
tions of truth; to be controlled by a selﬁshness
of so high an order, that your greatest happiness
comes from studying all problems from the im'
personal viewpoint, and making all judgements by
impersonal standards; to have the desire to be
right always overpowering the desire that
others esteem us to be so; never to impose one's
opinion by invasive force; never to be impatient,
except, perhaps with dogmatism and intolerance
-—this
is
the essence of intellectual hospitality.
in
addition to this,
if
you show that rare disposi'
tion to make a substantial sacrifice for defending
the right to be heard, of those whose opinions
you disapprove, you would have a virtue so
‘rare as to be almost heroic.
