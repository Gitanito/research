PREFACE.
In an age when every innocent amusement should be
devised to stem the torrent of that awful fascination, which
attends Card Parties and Card Playing, it seems to
need no apology for the publication of a little volume
calculated harmlessly to allure to peaceful thoughts and
blissful moments. It has long been felt by " the initiated"
that there is much consolation in the Astral Art, and
in the contemplation of those starry orbs, with a reference
to our future immortality and state of blessedness ; and it
is confessed that the approbation of the public on a forrrer
volume, called " Raphael's Lady Witch," has led to
another attempt of the kind, although quite a different
plan altogether.
London, May, 1834.
DESCRIPTIVE DELINEATION
OF THE
Jpvonti$$ittt,
FRONTISPIECE, Drawn by Mrs. Henry Browne, on a Large
Folding Steel Plate, containing* Seventeen distinct Designs,
as follows :
—
I.
In the centre—TIME, in vain attempting to eradicate the signs in
Geomancy. The Theban Sage, aware by his art of the speedy
downfall of that proud and gorgeous city, is engaged in engraving
the GEOMANTIO ART on tablets of stone : rapacious Time
endeavours to obliterate his works, but is frustrated by the all-
powerful influence of the Genius of Science ; around may be
discerned their stupendous monuments and temples, which are
now covered by the sand of the desert, and trod on by the feet of
Pilgrims and Camels.
II.
Round the Circle are depicted
—
1. SPIRITS OF EARTH—the Gnomes.
2. SPIRITS OF AIR—the Sylphids.
3. SPIRITS OF FIRE—the Salamanders.
4. SPIRITS OF WATER—the Undines.
III.
A Diagram of the Twelve Celestial Houses of Heaven, and
their various significations, relative to the affairs of human life,
all of which are fully explained in this work, and reveal
the soothing Characteristics of the Celestial Science among
the varied Scenes of Life, which are as follow :
—
The EMBLEMATICAL PICTURE of the FIRST CELESTIAL
HOUSE, refers to SELF, HEALTH, and FORM.—[Represents
the Student reclining by a fountain, musing o'er his future des-
tinies.]
Second Emblem refers to SUBSTANCE and MONEY.—[The Miser
in his prison-like room, is absorbed in the contemplation of his
long- hoarded wealth.]
i
DESCRIPTION OF FRONTISPIECE. V
Third Emblem refers to BRETHREN, LETTERS, and SHORT
JOURNIES.—[The brother arrived from his journey, is re-
ceived by his kinsman, while the attendant presents a sealed
packet.]
Fourth Emblem refers to FATHER, LAND, MINES, and HOUSES.
[A singular scene : —The father at the portico of his dwelling,
is surrounded by his offspring ; beneath are the Gnomes in the
mine, jabbering over their golden ingots.]
Fifth Emblem refers to GAMBLING, COURTSHIP, and SPE-
CULATION.— [Here we have both gambling and courtship, a
fit representation of the Fifth House.]
Sixth Emblem refers to SICKNESS, SERVANTS, and SMALL
ANIMALS.—[A Turk oppressed by sickness, is reclining under
the shade of a palm tree ; the son of Galen presents his potion ;
a Nubian slave stands by his side, while the watchful dog is
earnestly eying his master.]
Seventh Emblem refers to MARRIAGE, LAW -SUIT, OPEN
ENMITY, and OPPOSITION.—[A minted scene: first the
marriage, with the lawyer drawing up deeds ; in the distance,
two warriors are engaged in a deadly combat.]
Eighth Emblem refers to DEATHS, LEGACIES, DEBTS, and
WILLS.—[The heir is standing by the tomb of the deceased,
pondering over the wall, which has raised him to affluence.]
Ninth Emblem refers to SCIENCE, DREAMS, and LONG VOY-
AGES.—[The student of occult science is entranced by the
df^pth of his meditations; his guardian spirit causes visions of
the Peri's to float before him.]
Tenth Emblem refers to HONOUR, POWER, RENOWN, PRO-
FESSION, and CREDIT.- [The king on his throne dispenses
honours and favours to his courtiers.]
Eleventh Emblem refers to FRIENDSHIP, HOPES, and DE-
SIRES.—[Could not be better exemplified, than by the tale of
Damon and Pythias.]
Twelfth Emblem refers to PRIVATE ENMITY, PRISON, SOR-
CERY, and LARGE CATTLE.— [The witch concocts her mid-
night spell; in the distance is the gloomy prison 5 the Cavalieris
traitorously stabbed in the back by bis enemy.

OF THE
ASTRAL ART;
OE,
fBl»0tum of ^sttoioge*
GEOMANCY has been termed in the East—where it took
its rise—to be twin sister of the Celestial Science of
Astrology. The origin of this art is lost in the dark-
ness of the primeval and antediluvian ages ; but, according
to all testimonies, both mythological and historical, we
are led to believe that it was much studied and practised in
the Theban Temples, where, by its means, the Priests
delivered oracles to the people. The art consists in
certain judgments that are drawn from a Geomantic figure,
the particular symbols of which, concurring in the formation
of the figure, are handed down to us under the following
names :

CJje fit*0t |Jr0££00 in erecting the figure of GEO-
MANCY, is to make sixteen lines of dots as below, allow-
ing the hand to be governed by the sense of impulse alone,
not heeding whether there be few or many, or whether the
number is even or uneven. The method practised in the
eastern nations, is to form the lines of dots from right to
left, and, generally, they cast the lots on sand or slate.
The most common method adopted in this country, is to
cast the lots or points on paper, either with the pen or
pencil. The method of extracting the geomantic figures
from these lines of dots, is extremely simple ; it consists
in joining the dots together two by two, or in counting
them ; if the number should be odd, one point must be
set down ; if even, two. Thus it w7
ill be found that the
sixteen lines of dots will produce four distinct figures, cor-
responding with the figures in the preceding table. (See
page 4.)

The four first figurks being thus formed, the fifth,
sixth, seventh, and eighth figures are next deduced from
them in the following manner : —observe the number of
dots that compose the first lixks of the first four figures,
—the first line will form the fifth figure, the second will
form the sixth, the third will form the seventh, and the
fourth the eighth—thus :

* X # * * * *
* * * 7T X a

* * % # # #
* # * * * * *
# X # # * X
In order to form the next four figures, wr
e commence by-
adding the first and second figures together, and if the
number should be even, two points must be put down ;
if odd, one point. The first figure thus formed will be
the ninth in the figure.; the tenth figure is formed from the
third and fourth figures, the eleventh from the fifth and
sixth, and the twelfth from the seventh and eighth, in
order as follows :

The next process is the formation of the thirteenth and

similar manner to the former ones, by adding the ninth and
tenth together, and the eleventh and twelfth.

These are the natural and distinct properties of the Six-
teen figures of GEOMANCY, according to their distribu-
tions to the Signs and Planets. Before any judgment can
be given on a Geomantic figure, great attention should be
paid, that it be radical and fit to be judged, which is done
as follows :
—
HOW TO JUDGE IF THE FIGURE OF GEOMANCY
BE RADICAL.
After having erected the figure of Geomancy, attention
must be paid to the figures occupying the first, fourth, se-
venth, and TENTH HOUSES, and if one of those figure?
is governed by the planet ruling the hour in which the
figure is cast, then it is radical, and true answers to any
question proposed may be deduced therefrom ; if there is
no figure governed by the planet which rules the hours
occupying one of those houses, then a true result cannot
be had to any question, and another figure must be cast,
until a figure is obtained which is radical according to the
preceding rule.
RAPHAEL'S SANCTUARY. 11
THE METHOD OF OBTAINING THE
Is extremely simple. The number of hours elapsing be-
tween sunrise and sunset must be multiplied by 60, and
the product divided by 12; the number of times that
twelve is contained, or the quotient of this division, will
show the number of minutes constituting the planetary
hour by day ; for those of the night, it is necessary to
apply the same rule to the number of hours elapsing be-
tween sunset and sunrise.
The following table will be found useful in determining
the order of the planetary hours :
—
G
?
$
D
Observing, that the first hour of Sunday commences
under the dominion of the Sun, the second under that of
Venus, the third Mercury, and so on, according to the
order in the table.
The first hour of Monday under the Moon.
The first hour of Tuesday under Mars.
The first hour of Wednesday under Mercury.
The first hour of Thursday under JuriTER.
The first hour of Friday under Venus.
The first hour of Saturday under Saturn.
To those of our readers who may not wish to cast the
figure of Geomancy, we propose the following simple and
easy method of obtaining an answer to any of the following
14'; Questions :
—
Let each figure on the cards accompanying this wr

cut out and made into a pack ; then let the party, after they
have chosen the particular question they wish answered,
draw one card from the pack, without looking at it or
choosing it ; then observe what the number of the question
is ; and under the circle, corresponding to the house in
which the question is, and opposite to the number of the
question, in the circle occupied by the figure drawn from
the pack, the answer will be found.

SPANISH EVENING HYMN.
Ave ! now let prayer and music
Meet in love on shore and sea
!
Now, sweet Mother ! may the weary
Turn from this cold world to thee.
From the dark and restless waters
Hear the sailor's hymn arise !
From his watch-fire, 'midst the mountains,
Lo ! to thee the shepherd cries.
Yet, where thus full hearts find voices,
If o'erburden'd souls there be,
Dark and silent in their anguish,
—
Aid those captives— set them free !
Touch them, every fount unsealing,
Where the frozen tears lie deep
;
Thou, the Mother of all sorrows,
Aid, oh ! aid to pray and weep
!

A military gentleman of high rank, a great admirer, and
no mean proficient in this " celestial art," to whose many
acts' of friendship in matters of science I am much in-
debted, having, in the beginning of the year 1819, some
affairs of moment to transact in Germany, happened, dur-
ing his stay therein, to ascertain the true time of this illus-
trious prince's birth.
As the figure is cast to the latitude of Hanover, it will
be seen that he was born jointly under the influence of the
two great superiors ; for the sign Capricornus arose on the
eastern angle, and Jupiter was ascending in the fixed sign
Aquarius. The figure I hold to be of a remarkably bril-
liant description; for a new moon had just been celebrated
in the masculine and fiery sign Aries, that body then ap-
plied to the sextile of Jupiter and conjunction of Mercury ;
she was also in sextile to the ascendant. His disposition
will be placid, temperate, pleasant, and cheerful, yet
sharp. Had Mercury been free from the beams of the Sun,
lie wT
ould have proved a prodigy in many branches of
learning and science, for that erratic was in Sextile to both
the benefics, and in trine to the Georgian planet. As it
now occurs, he will have much to do with public, honour-
able, and stirring political matters ; and for his love of
justice, ingenuity, and activity therein, he will meet with
much and well-merited applause.
It is a nativity of exceeding vitality for Jupiter. The
Sun and the Moon all befriend the ascendant, and until the
leaden orb of old Saturn arrives at the Hyleg's conjunction,
danger will be afar off.
He will be very wealthy, for the part of fortune is dis-
posed of by Jupiter, and that planet is well configurated
;
he will, notwithstanding, be liable to losses of money and
property by secret means and measures, for Saturn is in
square to Herschel.
His rank will be high—his power will be great—espe-
cially towards the close of his days. The Sun and the
Moon being both in Aries, and both the benevolents being
their attendants, casting their trines to the culminating angle.
Though much of the power of the Moon is absorbed in
the beams of the Sun, and though she is in a sign of single

form, and in declination to the enemy of marriage, yet,
seeing that she is in, sextile to Jupiter, I think he will
marry, and that his marriage will take place in the year
1845; in that state of life, he will experience a tolerable
good share of happiness, and children he will certainly have.
In his time he will perform many journies, for the Moon
is in a travelling sign, as well as in a cadent house ; his
travels will be honourable and full of pleasure, though once
or twice they will prove dangerous, especially by water.
From the present time up to the year 1841 , evil arcs are
more prevalent than good. In his sixteenth year he will
be liable to losses of money ; and in the beginning of the
year 1837. he will have an amour, and probably a fewT
troubles and vexations through females generally ; under
this and the influences which succeed, he must be careful
of his credit. In June, 1840, perhaps an accident; and
in the following year his health will be affected.
After this, for the long space of five years, the wanderers
of heaven favour him ; in fact, immediately after the inter-
ruption of health, of which I have last spoken, he will
attain to honour and dignity ; an important and profitable
journey succeeds ; then a great increase of wealth and
worldly possessions ; considerable activity ; literary notice ;
and, finally, in the year 1845, not very distant from the
anniversary of his twenty-sixth birth-day, it is my per-
suasion he will marry.
In the summer of 1846 he will certainly be unwell, and
meet with losses and many disagreeables. A continuation
of the same will spread over 1847.
As the spring of 1849 is passing away, he will be ad-
vanced to some honourable post; in the autumn his affairs
get unsettled—he travels. In 1850, his deeds will attract
public attention; and in the year 1852, his embarrassments
will depart. It will be a time of great honour, credit, and
popular distinction.
1853 has its annoyances; such as losses of money and
secret vexations, mixed up with much business.
1854, in the month of May, much sorrow is shewn,
in which female influence hath predominance. It may be
the death of one whom he dearly loves ; but I shall ab-

stain from particulars. Suffice it, that I name the nature of
the event. The latter part of that year will he prosperous.
In 1855, and somewhere about October, this illustrious
individual is liable to a sharp and sudden illness or accident.
He will do well to avoid steamboats and the water.
Evil to the general prosperity and health, are the arcs
of 1857 and 1858, even to December 1859. I must here
mention, that in 1857 a lingering affliction of an agueish
character will afflict him.
In 1859 he will travel considerably, and towards Christ-
mas his health will be wonderfully established ; it will be a
time of much gain and great prosperity; —the arcs in the
summer of 1860 shows that he is likely to suffer much loss,
through the defalcation of some servant in whom too much
trust is put ; in matters of important correspondence, per-
haps caution at this time may prevent the same.
1862 and 1863, abound in good fortune, ease of mind,
honour, credit, and pleasure. 1864 is by no means so
favourable ; but in the year 1865, and in the month of July,
if the birth is very correct, he will have an inflammatory
complaint, and while that inflammation lasts, it will be very
violent—his throat, during its progress, will be much
affected ; and, unless more than ordinary care is taken,
the dregs of this disease will certainly fall into his legs and
feet. 1868 will be prosperous for most of his affairs ; 1 869
is replete with many untoward events; 1870 is very little
better.
But after this, until the Sun shall return for the fifty-
sixth time, since the birth, to the same point of the zodiac
he occupied at that minute, his prosperity will be un-
bounded—honours and benefits wr
ill be showT
ered upon him
—in those years he will attain to the meridian of his glory ;
and, finally, as the great globe of Saturn shall touch the
orient, he wr
ill sink into everlasting rest, surrounded by
bis friends, and in high estimation with his fellow mortals.
