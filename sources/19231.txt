so we went through all these I mean it&#39;s
a whole bunch of people I met with
personally uh now there are people out
there who say they&#39;re doing stuff with
disclosure and lobbying but they&#39;ve
actually never met with a member of a
sitting member of
Congress I&#39;m not going to name names but
that&#39;s it um that&#39;s what I did for 10
years from 92 and three until 01 and
Beyond um and also people overseas the
cabinet level member of uh the Japanese
government in charge of Science and
Technology briefed him very interested
but when I said will Japan take the lead
on disclosure and put this material
together he says oh no we can&#39;t do it be
ahead of the United States he was in
Terror of the idea of getting ahead of
these covert
programs same thing with meeting with
certain members of the royal families in
Europe that I met with and as you know I
provided a big briefing for that was
given to Prince Charles by um
Jamie Cromwell the actor who played he
said he was kind of playing me in this
movie First Contact a Star Trek movie
and Jamie Cromwell they had the opening
in London and and Prince Charles came
and wanted this briefing we were putting
together for the president and so Jamie
Cromwell handed it to him and I got a
lovely note back from Prince Charles
about this but not that Charles could do
anything about this issue but they&#39;re
interested there&#39;s so much interest but
the people even if they&#39;re in very high
positions they&#39;re interested and now
they&#39;re know
to be briefed but they have no power
over the
operations so as I said over an hour ago
don&#39;t conflate knowledge of the issue
with Access
Control access control is in these
unacknowledged special access
projects so that led me to doing
something very
controversial and there&#39;s a
my military people said look there
there&#39;s a way that we do things in the
military and it&#39;s called A unod letter
unless otherwise
directed um and what that means is you
write to various people in command and
say unless otherwise directed here&#39;s my
assessment and here&#39;s what I&#39;m going to
do so they said to legally cover
yourself you need to do a unod letter
and send it to the head of the justice
department the president the Pentagon
the CIA the FBI the whole alphabet suit
the NSA and we send it return receipt
requested so you can prove it was
received and I did that and that&#39;s also
in the first
book extraterrestrial contact the
evidence and
implications and it said if is it it
basically said and you can read it it&#39;s
up on our website here is our assessment
these projects are being run illegally
they are unacknowledged special access
projects that have been unconstitutional
since the 50s the president and other
key figures we know have been lied to as
have the oversight Committees of the
Congress similar crisis exists in the
United Kingdom and other countries where
I have had
briefings
therefore it is our assessment that the
National Security Act and secrecy laws
that are attached to Oaths of secrecy
are null and
void and that any man or woman who has
knowledge and any document material or
evidence attached to the UFO and
extraterrestrial issue can be provided
and disclosed publicly without penalty
of
law this is our assessment and unless
otherwise directed beginning at as soon
as we can organize it we will proceed
with disclosing this testimony and these
documents this was what we used to
legally cover all 110 top secret
military witnesses that came forward it
had to be done and the reason I couldn&#39;t
have done that between 93 and 98 I had
to go through this torture chamber of of
of finding out that in fact and proving
not only to myself for for posterity and
in my records that the key people who
should know about this do not and
therefore the programs are illegal and
therefore if the programs are themselves
illegal they can&#39;t site the law it&#39;s
basic constitutional law if you&#39;re
operating if you&#39;re a
mafia let&#39;s say that you know you know
some a mafia guy is running an illegal
project and you enter into a contract
with him that contract is viated
nullified is worth is is completely
zeroed out because the underlying
operation&#39;s illegal so all these men and
women who have been at lock heat Martin
Skunk Works who have been with the CIA
the DIA the Pentagon who have worked on
these projects we basically exonerated
them from any legal penalties for
disclosing information about these
projects because we were able to prove
they were being run unconstitutionally
and therefore for the National Security
Act could not be applied does everyone
understand what I&#39;m just describing that
was the basis for the disclosure project
of May
2001 and we had to do that because the
you know I talked to Danny shean who is
a constitutional attorney who did the
silkwood case representing the New York
Times and the Pentagon papers and he was
helping me pro bono on this we I I I ran
this idea by him so I I you know I had
my military guys advise me on the unod
letter the less otherwise directed
letter but I talk to some legal
constitutional experts and say is this a
sound legal assessment because I&#39;m just
a doctor I don&#39;t you know I know
anything about this stuff and they he
said absolutely if these projects are
being run illegally those they cannot
then have it both ways they either have
to be under proper oversight and control
of the president and the Congress and or
they have opted themselves out of the
legal system and therefore they cannot
use the legal
system to prosecute any of our Witnesses
or me for having disclosed top secret
documents that have not been
Declassified which I have
done now that&#39;s a very big difference
from what Snowden did Snowden disclosed
things that were being overseen by the
president and were being overseen by the
Senate select committee on intelligence
and the house intelligence commit
and even some of those even though those
pro programs
are big brother esque and
outrageous he really should have limited
his disclosure if he&#39;s listening to
operations that were unacknowledged and
illegal you see if he had done that he
would not be in legal trouble does
everybody understand what I&#39;m saying he
just didn&#39;t know he was young and he had
very bad advisers the people the
journalists and people who were working
with him didn&#39;t understand the system
well so I anyone listening who wants to
be a whistleblower listen to me contact
me before you jump off that plank
because you must only disclose the
projects that are
usaps unacknowledged and which are
unacknowledged to the level that even
upon directed inquiry by the key people
in the Congress the Pentagon the CIA and
the president are still they&#39;re still
lying to them
so those programs then are rogue and
illegal um those you can disclose and if
you can prove that then you&#39;re free
sailing now that&#39;s what we did so from
98 until 2000 we gathered together more
and more and more of these top secret
military people and others and I went
all around the
world and uh interviewed them there&#39;s
several dozen of them up on our website
at siriusdisclosure.com
siriusdisclosure.com
their testimony is a book that we put
together called
disclosure um some of it I mean it&#39;s so
voluminous to give you an idea I had 110
hours of testimony that I had to cut
down to the 4H hour and 2hour DVDs that
you can get on our website there&#39;s so
much material so it&#39;s unbelievable
amount of material that were um that&#39;s
on digital film I mean honestly I did
most of the filming so it&#39;s not
professional because I&#39;m a clutz with
cameras but that&#39;s all we didn&#39;t have
the funding to do this you know like a
big project we just did it it was all by
the way the disclosure project had no
paid staff no office all volunteers
working in our spare time all of it so
that&#39;s how it got done and it still is
how it&#39;s happening so I think that
people have to understand that you know
we did the best we could with what we
had it wasn&#39;t like we had a $5 million
Grand or $10 million Grand to to do this
we had a couple hundred, to travel the
world interview all these people and
launch it at the national press club
which became the biggest event in the
history of the national Press Club since
Ronald Reagan was there and at the time
that we did the May 9th 2001 event it
was the most watched event in the
history of the internet the entire
internet and the PE the company that
hosts the
internet broadcast out of the national
Press Club said they had so many people
trying to see it it crashed their system
and that Bill Gates and others were
watching this because they had never
seen that many people trying to get on
to see it grab they had to grab every T1
line in Washington at the old system now
you can handle it but they couldn&#39;t
handle it in
2001 and it was all in the media
eventually about 800 million people
around the world saw it but then one by
one the media were contacted and told
take this down take this down take this
down four months later 911
happened but in in in the course of all
of this um I&#39;ve learned a a lot but you
know what one of the things I&#39;ve learned
is that um you cannot expect people in
power to bite the hand that feeds them
like the old 9-inch nails song well they
bite the hand that feeds them um and the
answer is usually
not and the other thing is that the
currency that matters is is it&#39;s not
it&#39;s not impressive if you&#39;re a
billionaire I know a lot of billionaires
um it&#39;s not impressive if you have a law
degree from
Harvard um it&#39;s not impressive if Daddy
left you 10 billion dollar it&#39;s not
impressive if you&#39;re the president of
the United States if you&#39;re not willing
to do the right things for the people of
the world and of the United States and
have the courage to do it now that one
word courage comes cooler from heart
from the French do you have the heart
and the courage to do it that&#39;s what&#39;s
been missing because for the most part
our politicians and our attorneys most
of whom most politicians are lawyers
they&#39;re not they come up in a system
where it&#39;s self-aggrandizing naked
ambition and most people in the
corporate world and in the political
world are not going to do something that
could be an enormously dangerous thing
for themselves personally and could ruin
their careers by being associated with
it and that&#39;s why I concluded by 2000
that the people have to do it we the
people have to do that
now one of the one of the real uh other
issues that came up recently was have
them been people who over a period of
time been trying to work this within the
system yes there&#39;s a senior off official
at the CIA who for 20 years has been
very very
supportive um and he&#39;s part of that
group but he&#39;s on the side of
disclosure but he can&#39;t stick his neck
out too far because he saw what happened
to former CIA director Colby when he
stuck his neck out he was going to give
Bill Colby the CI director I think for
Ford and Nixon was going to hand off one
of these 0 point free energy devices and
about $50 million in seed money so we
could get it out to the public
and the week he was going to meet with a
member of my board they found him
floating down the pomac river um almost
absolutely it was assassinated we can&#39;t
prove it but um his best friend a
colonel uh met with me and said yes
that&#39;s what happened and he knew it was
a risk so a lot of people who are
friendly to this who are on the inside
are afraid of being tweaked terminated
with extreme
prejudice and then you have other people
who aren&#39;t on the inside who don&#39;t have
the courage of the ridicule Factor
because the New York Times And The
Washington Post the big media outfits
that are wholly owned subsidiaries of
the intelligence Community frankly when
it comes to this issue are going to
absolutely
roast and ridicule any politician that
brings up the word UFO it has to be done
like on K kemel lie you know just sort
of hahaa make a joke of it um
so in 19 53 the CIA decided that the
psychological warfare aspects of this
would be where the real enforcement
could be by just making it ridiculous
and they actually engaged I have a
document that proves this Disney Studios
to make cartoons about little green men
so that it would become the laughing
stock and and sort of defang the whole
issue into sort of silliness and so it
has remained for 60
years so it takes a lot of Courage not
just in terms of your personal safety
but your reputation because you&#39;re going
to be ridiculed and laughed out of
meetings or you&#39;re going to be teased
and most people don&#39;t want to be
ridiculed um I&#39;m just the kind of person
I don&#39;t care what someone says about me
I mean everything terrible you can
imagine&#39;s been said about me and so what
I mean you just expect it so but most
people in a public
eye don&#39;t want to do
that and so disclosure is going to have
to be with the people so we initiated
that in 01 and we continue to do that
and I think that the biggest problem
we&#39;ve had and I wrote a paper about this
called when disclosure serves
secrecy now this paper I wish you would
read it and memorize it the everything I
predicted in that a long time ago it&#39;s
on our website and if you sign up for
our email service we occasionally send
it out it&#39;s a free newsletter you can
just sign up it&#39;s it&#39;s
siriusdisclosure.com it&#39;s free we just
it&#39;s completely provided to the public
um that paper describes the
dangers of doing what we&#39;ve
done and that is disclosure being
hijacked by
charlatans who masquerade as disclosure
folks who attached to all the body of
evidence I put together the The Fear
Factor and the silly season and the evil
aliens are coming to eat us for lunch
all right and that has happened and the
betrayals I will not go into because it
will break your heart so the the truth
is the thing that that keeps me up most
at night is all this information being
folded into it which is all solid
information being folded into
disinformation that&#39;s tailored to scare
the public into what General MacArthur
said and that is World War II will be
interplanetary so now let me talk about
the deepest usap the deepest
unacknowledged special Access Project is
the one that is taxed with doing the
psychological propaganda just like
Hitler did with his
program for convincing the people that
there&#39;s a threat that we should fight uh
this was launched in the 50s and 60s um
first they made the subject ridiculous
and then they made it terrifying like
the movie Independence
Day and this was all part of a plan
hatched in the
50s to be sure that we could continue to
grow the military-industrial complex but
instead of just one country sort of a
unipolar expenditure out mainly the
United States and at that time Soviet
Union it&#39;d be a global hun military
effort effort because there&#39;s a threat
from outer space and they have done
about 50 years 60 years of very very
careful
preparation now the UFO subculture is
replete with the influence of that most
people don&#39;t understand it and I wasn&#39;t
surprised when I got a document in the
1990s from the Strategic Studies
Institute describing this project and
this is going to be in our next film if
I can find a director that wants to make
this film
um and it describes creating a worldwide
subculture and cult
around alien abductions using
stagecraft I&#39;m
quoting and using Advanced Aerospace
devices I.E man-made UFOs
anti-gravity with creatures that could
pass as a aliens to engage in events to
scare people so that the public could be
turned to believe that there&#39;s one or
more civilizations that we should unite
against and fight and Ronald Reagan at
the United Nations literally said
wouldn&#39;t our job of creating a world a
unified World be easier if we had a
common alien
threat this is you can Google this clip
of Reagan saying this so that
agenda and the Star Wars programs that
go with it and 90 plus perc of all UFO
subculture books movies conferences are
infected with that
virus now I&#39;m saying unwittingly in many
cases because how would you know if you
haven&#39;t been read into a
program that is so sensitive and I&#39;ve
had physicists who worked at the doui
complex and at the pine Gap complex in
in Australia that where they manufacture
these what are called programmed life
forms these things that look like aliens
that are 100% man-made have integrated
circuits in their neural complex but
they&#39;re Biologicals and they&#39;re on board
these but the people running the craft
are military or corporate
guys and they&#39;ll sick these things on
people and they will abduct them and put
an implant in
them and the implants are made by eg&amp;
G they&#39;re on the edge of the Nellis
range you want to hear more
