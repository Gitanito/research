The guy in front of me wiped out and didn't have the board leash secured, so his 6 foot (or more) long fiberglass board shot out of the water and landed right on my face/head. 

I floated there bordering on consciousness in a huge pool of blood until I was poked by a huge tiger shark. Then the shark poked me again. That's when I had a life review, and was lifted out of the water by a faceless, glowing entity, and flown to shore in an instant. No one ever saw the entity but me.

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?     No

Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?       Yes, I'm sorry that some of these answers seem confusing because I didn't know if I should do this survey for each SEPARATE NDE/precognition event, or mix the answers, as each situation was totally unique to the other.
