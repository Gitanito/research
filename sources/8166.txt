I was at the oral surgeon's office this morning for a dental implant. I had nitrous oxide, which I have had before but I've never had this experience before. I felt like I was quickly going toward this long, very bright light and I saw a shadow of a man and I realized and thought, 'I am dying, I have to go back to my children.' I kept thinking my daughter's name. I woke up and had tears running down my face. The doctor and his assistants were acting very concerned. They told me that I gave them a scare.
