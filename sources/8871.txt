  		              		Experience Description   

    On 4/21/1976, I made plans with the employees of my new department to celebrate my arrival from Germany after a 17-month apprenticeship of new equipment and service to be implemented at the company in Brazil. The celebration took place in São Paulo. After the celebration, I was heading home and giving a ride to two employees and one of their wives in the new VW Beetle I had just bought. It was close to Midnight. All of a sudden, a motorcycle and a new VW Brasilia were trying to go across, cutting me off from the right. They were having a street race. I had the right-of-way. When they hit the right side of the front of my car, my car spun horizontally, diagonally crossing the very long intersection, and my car hit the curb. I was the driver and my body flew about 30 meters out of the right-side window. When I fell, the right side of my face and shoulder hit the surface of the promenade. Right across from the scene of the accident, there was an emergency center at a private hospital.  

  I had passed out during the accident, but I was breathing and bleeding profusely; both of my knees had been cut by the metal parts of the car window; my face was disfigured from the injuries and the blood; and there was blood gushing from my right shoulder.  

My older sister, Gemma, told me what had happened at the São Paulo medical hospital: The ambulance arrived at the scene of the accident and took me to the nearest hospital. My sister came along, but she was not allowed to enter the hospital. At least half an hour went by. She was outside of a braided wire wall and, since it was taking so long, she spoke to some officers and then came into the hospital. She looked through all of the emergency care rooms but she was unable to locate me. But, in the middle of the hall where there was an elevator that went down to the morgue, she saw eight more bodies covered by white cloth on top of some stretchers. These bodies were waiting to go to the morgue for an expert examination. One of them had a lot of blood on the stretcher and a left foot exposed from under the cloth. The middle toes of my feet are raised very differently compared to the normal feet. 'That’s my brother, Joon!' yelled my sister to one of the officers.  

  A medical team arrived to examine me and found that I was alive but had a very weak pulse. The nurse in charge said that he had thought that I was dead because of all the blood on the stretcher. I was immediately taken to another hospital located at the other end of Paulista Avenue. The police called for an ambulance and my sister and I were escorted by a police siren.  

  Three days in a coma or with memory loss:  

  When I arrived at the other hospital, I was immediately operated on after several attempts at taking X-rays. The on-duty physician discovered in the X-ray a shape of a crucifix right in the middle of my spine. It was the crucifix pendant that my sister had given to me as a gift. Three X-rays were taken because it was really deep inside and it would require minor surgery to remove it. The doctor removed it and handed it to my sister. Very impressed, he said, 'This cross saved your brother’s life!' I was in a coma at that time; however, I was seeing something strange.    

 In another world: I was looking at two of me—one me was face down in front of a long wall, and the other me was at the scene of the accident. However, I was looking at the scene of the accident from above: my car, two people with their hands up clinging to a wall, and an employee sitting with one knee leaning on the ground and supporting one arm on the other knee—he seemed to be in a lot of pain.  

  My other body was in front of a new wall, lying face down trying to lift its neck to get a glimpse of a very interesting scene: My body was totally uninjured and I saw some flowers on the edge of the wall, which I had never seen before. I was able to see through the wall into a house. A young mother was in the kitchen and a boy and a girl were talking, 'Let’s play with ice cream like when we were on Earth?' 'Yes, let’s do it! What would you like?' The girl says, 'I want vanilla and chocolate! How about you?' The boy replies, 'Strawberries and cream for me!'  

  What surprised me was that the ice cream instantly appeared in each of their hands. I thought to myself, 'Oh, it’s like that here? Just think about what you want and you can have anything? How cool!' I was awestruck. Their mother was smiling as she made some tasty-smelling food.  

  All of a sudden somebody yelled, 'I watched over him all the time! I just don’t know how this accident could have happened! It’s the truth, sir! I watched over him!'  

  From the somewhat hoarse voice, I realized that it was the voice of my guardian angel. That’s just what I figured. He was behind the wall with someone who might have been his boss. 'Maybe he’s an archangel,' I thought to myself.  

  All of a sudden, this supposed boss of my guardian angel came through the wall and appeared before me. I was lying face down, motionless, and I strained my neck to look up. He was tall and dressed in a white cassock that would change color (light blue, soft brown, etc.). I enjoyed painting pictures, and I unintentionally yelled out, 'Aha! That means that white is the mother of all colors? That’s it! I’ve figured it out!'  

  I tried to get a look at his face, but all I saw was a white plaque covering his face.  

  He opened his right hand and pointed his index finger and lifted me up. His index finger looked like a wooden pole. And with his other hand pointing to the scene of the accident, he said, 'It’s not your time to come here yet. Go back there and help a lot of people, and then come back!'  

  His voice came to me as if it were in surround sound, coming from all over. I had this big eye, which saw all of these scenes from another world and this world, where I had had the accident.    

I woke up when someone called to me, 'Look! This is my daughter, Cristina! She just turned one year old!' When I came back into the world, my memory became very clear, and I recognized my older brother from Campinas.

    Later on, Gemma told me that during these three days (which I did not remember having been in a coma) I was interacting normally with my colleagues from Siemens, and I was teaching the work to my employees quite naturally.  

  This happened 44 years ago, and I can see it clearly as if it was still the year the accident happened.  

Background Information:       

Gender:   	Male  

Date NDE Occurred:   	 April 21, 1976  

NDE Elements:       

At the time of your experience, was there an associated life-threatening event?        Uncertain  Accident          Clinical death (cessation of breathing or heart function or brain function)  From speaking with the physician who performed the surgery on me, he said I would have died if only a few more minutes had gone by. After all, the risk of death was a common thing.  

How do you consider the content of your experience?        Entirely pleasant  

Did you feel separated from your body?      Yes  We would have to separate the part during the experience from the part after, because during the experience, it was really clear what was happening. However, after the experience, everything went back to normal and, lately, I’ve been getting the feeling that I can talk to my dogs telepathically.  I clearly left my body and existed outside it  

How did your highest level of consciousness and alertness during the experience compare to your normal everyday consciousness and alertness?        More consciousness and alertness than normal   There were three of me: one from the world of the accident; another one in a different world; and the big eye that was looking at my two bodies.  

At what time during the experience were you at your highest level of consciousness and alertness?         Every moment that my third eye was looking at my two bodies.  

Were your thoughts speeded up?         Faster than usual  

Did time seem to speed up or slow down?         Everything seemed to be happening at once; or time stopped or lost all meaning     It seemed that time had stood still, but when I would look at this world, Earth time was normal.  

Were your senses More vivid than usual?         More vivid than usual  

Please compare your vision during the experience to your everyday vision that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.       I became closer to God after the experience. Before this experience, I used to talk to God normally, but I never expected Him to answer.  

Please compare your hearing during the experience to your everyday hearing that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.      Very different: During the experience, I could hear the content of the conversation without distinguishing the language. And even though I experienced different dimensions during the experience, I was able to understand all the dimensions simultaneously.  

Did you seem to be aware of things going on elsewhere, as if by ESP?       Yes, but the facts have not been checked out  

Did you pass into or through a tunnel?         Uncertain     I’ve heard about these tunnels before. I’m typically not that aware of my surroundings, so, I don’t remember if I went through a tunnel. I saw that I was in another world and, at the same time, I saw my body at the scene of the accident.  

Did you see any beings in your experience?         I actually saw them  

Did you encounter or become aware of any deceased (or alive) beings?         No       

Did you see, or feel surrounded by, a brilliant light?         No  

Did you see an unearthly light?         Uncertain   As I mentioned earlier, I’m not always very aware. I saw the sky very clearly. The masked archangel was wearing a cassock… one moment with light, the next it was clear.  

Did you seem to enter some other, unearthly world?         A clearly mystical or unearthly realm     As I mentioned earlier, it seemed to me that I was in a heavenly world with homes belonging to residents of the land that made things happen through their thoughts.  

What emotions did you feel during the experience?         I just felt that I needed to obey all the instructions, and I didn’t question it. I wasn’t able to remember what it was that needed to be done. Another part of my body (a big eye) from a higher dimension was observing me to check my behavior in the other world.  

Did you have a feeling of peace or pleasantness?         Incredible peace or pleasantness  

Did you have a feeling of joy?         Incredible joy  

Did you feel a sense of harmony or unity with the universe?       I felt united or one with the world  

Did you suddenly seem to understand everything?         Everything about the universe     I was only able to understand a little bit because I was only thinking about getting back quickly to this world.  

Did scenes from your past come back to you?         No       

Did scenes from the future come to you?         No       

Did you come to a border or point of no return?         I came to a barrier that I was not permitted to cross; or was sent back against my will    

God, Spiritual and Religion:       

What was your religion prior to your experience?      Other or several faiths   My family was Christian, although I did not attend church. However, ever since I was a child, I had a habit of talking to God, and after this experience, I absolutely believe in God and I talk to Him. As for participating in mass or to practicing worship, I attend any church that might be near to me at the time (Catholic or Protestant).  

Have your religious practices changed since your experience?         Actually, my religious beliefs have disappeared and I only believe in God and angels.     No  

What is your religion now?         Other or several faiths   In line with my previous answer, I’ve come to respect all religions with my one God. I do not, however, attend church, and I only pray at mealtimes.  

Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was entirely consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience     I don't know how to explain it.  

Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         Yes     I became more certain from the experience.  

Did you seem to encounter a mystical being or presence, or hear an unidentifiable voice?         I encountered a definite being, or a voice clearly of mystical or unearthly origin   The one that interacted with me seemed to be an archangel. I only heard the voice of my guardian angel (it seemed).  

Did you see deceased or religious spirits?         I actually saw them  

Did you encounter or become aware of any beings who previously lived on earth who are described by name in religions (for example: Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, etc.)?         No     

During your experience, did you gain information about premortal existence?         Yes     I was watching two lives simultaneously.  

During your experience, did you gain information about universal connection or oneness?         Yes     According to what I saw—a mother and two children in a beautiful house—things can be brought about through thoughts.  

During your experience, did you gain information about the existence of God?         Yes     I am sure that the archangel that interacted with me must have a superior, which would be God. I realized that there are sets of rules different than those on Earth.  

Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:       

During your experience, did you gain special knowledge or information about your purpose?      Yes   I acquired wisdom related to colors.  

During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?         Yes     From the tone of my archangel when he sent me back to earth with a mission, I can see that one of our primordial and most important duties is to help others.  

During your experience, did you gain information about an afterlife?         An afterlife definitely exists     Yes     According to what I saw—a family in the other world after their life on Earth—there are places for those that are chosen, and the chosen tend to use their thoughts to accomplish things.  

Did you gain information about how to live our lives?         Yes     I had to return to this world with a specific mission: Help lots of people!  

During your experience, did you gain information about life's difficulties, challenges and hardships?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about love?         No       

What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         Large changes in my life     God exists and he is instructing you directly or through angels.  

Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          Yes Yes  

After the NDE:       

Was the experience difficult to express in words?        No     

How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  I’ve been recounting this for over 40 years and the accuracy and detail have not changed.  

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         No       

Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          If my subconscious is connected to my spirit, I think there is another subconscious of the subconscious.  

Have you ever shared this experience with others?       No      

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       Yes   I was two years old and I don’t remember.  

What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real     When you receive a mission through an experience, the mission will be accomplished only if you believe!  

What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real     I received a mission to carry out in my earthly life… am I supposed to question it?  

Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?         Yes  

Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?         I felt a divine control when I relaxed into my mission.
