and the story is that some years ago
maybe four or five years ago we were up
in England at Alton Barnes roll the crop
circles had appeared and we were doing
this amazing meditation up on Woodbury
Hill and we did a puja which is a
Sanskrit mantra meditative ceremony that
I do for everyone when I start the
meditation for a group and it&#39;s all in
Sanskrit and we started to do it and we
were in this big meadow and there were
all these beautiful of cows that were in
the meadow and they came around and made
a circle around our circle laid down and
then meditated with us and the whole
time we were doing the puja and
meditating they were they&#39;re just very
very peaceful peaceable and meditating
with us at the end of it they literally
all got up and then went about their
business and we had these amazing
contact experiences up on this hill with
these cows who joined us in meditation
so when you go into deep meditation even
the grass and the trees and the animals
join you in that state of consciousness
