    Summary:  From Pat Deveney's database:

 Forum of Psychic and Scientific Research, The.
 A Digest of the Philosophy of Survival and the Phenomena of Spiritualism and Psychic Research.
 Science, Philosophy, Religion--1933?  Monthly
 Los Angeles, CA.  Publisher: Crossley Publishing Company.  Editor: Felicie O. Crossley, editor-publisher; Bernice H. Jacquelin, secretary; Beverly D. Hiner, A.B., special correspondent.
 Succeeds: Spiritualist Monthly

 1/1 December 1930.  $2.50 a year, 32 pp.  This was the companion to Crossley's Spiritualists Monthly and differs from it mainly in its emphasis on "psychic and scientific research" rather than on doctrinaire spiritualism -- though the distinction is often less than clear.  It contained contributions by Mrs. Hewat McKenzie, Mrs. St. Clair Stobart, Swami Dhirananda,  Horace Leaf, Nandor Fodor, et al, and carried notably an article by H. Duncan McFarland in February 1933 on "The Truth About the Negro Question," on the split among spiritualists (the NSA and the GAS) at their 1927 convention.  On Crossley, see the note under Spiritualist Monthly.
