  		              		Experience Description:   

  This experience is told to Peggi, a friend of Sheila's for  almost 30 years.   Sheila passed away three times, with the longest time being approximately 15 to 18 minutes while in  the hospital.   
  
  She had  three heart attacks, each one was about three weeks apart from the last one. When she came out of the third heart attack,  they took the breathing tube out of her.  The first thing she said to me was, 'Jesus came to me three times.' She didn’t realize that  she had actually died three times.    
  
  Here’s the actual recording with a tiny bit of editing. Once Sheila  could talk and I heard her say that Jesus came to her, I immediately got my recorder out.   
  
  Peggi: What was your dream?   
  
  Sheila:  I woke up. I was in a lucid dream, half sleep and half awake, because Jesus woke me up.  He said, 'Get up. Do you want to come?' I said, 'No.' I was  matter-of-fact about that. Yet, I could tell He was disappointed.  He then  asked me, 'What do you want to take?'   
  
  Sheila: 'What do I want to take...special back?'     He did not say that but I got the feeling that    last time He was disappointed.   
  
  Peggi: So how'd you know if  you would come back?
  
  Sheila: I said, 'No. I want to stay.'    I don’t know what the hell I was thinking. Then I started to get the tube out (referring to the breathing tube)   
  
  Peggi: So you said he gave you something? Do you know what he gave you?'   
  
  Sheila: LIFE
  
  Peggi: Life?
  
  Sheila: Yeah
  
  Peggi: So Sheila, tell us what happened. I drove you to the hospital for a simple procedure.   
  
  Sheila:  Yeah, I don't remember going to the hospital.     I don't remember staying at the hotel… nothing.   All I remember is lying down like this. You can’t see, but my feet are up and I was looking out the window.  I was in a tube and  there was light in it. It was almost bright white  because Jesus was in it with me. But it was a see-through tube and I was looking out.  I saw there were all these colors flying by.  
  
  I was trying think, 'What is this; what ride is this?'   It couldn’t have been a ride because I don’t do rides because  I’m chicken. Now I know what it was because I was  on the other side  and I've had   plenty of time to think about it. It was galaxies and universes that we were passing on our way to what I call 'Jesus’ courtyard.'   
  
  It was like 'Poof.' I landed and everywhere was all white. There was nobody there. I was looking, spinning around, and looking for something. And then I turned around and all sudden I see Jesus! BAM!  It hit me so hard with His love! It just knocked me down!  And I knew right away who it was. There was no doubt who it was. It was Jesus! And I fell down on my knees because the love that was coming from him was so intense that I couldn't even stand up. 

   I remember before dying, that a long time ago,    I was told that 'No man could stand before Jesus or God.'   I thought, 'Well, why would that be?' I mean, 'Would He beat you down or something?' I never understood why they would say that. Now I know why; it is because  his love is so mighty,  that I can't even describe it.   This love is so intense that I could not stand because it just knocked me over.   
  
  Anyway, I'm on my knees and I'm looking at Him like I was ashamed, with my hands over my face and peeking up at Him.   I don't want to look straight  at Him because He was looking at me with so much love. I didn't feel worthy of it. I don't know why I would feel that way because I'm not bad person.   
  
  I love the animals. I like people. I always try to do my best, but yet I didn't feel like I wanted him to look at me like He was just so in love with me.  (not sexually) So, I kept burying my head in the ground.     I couldn't get low enough  and He’s still looking at me like He loves me so much!    
  
  I know exactly what His feet look like because I was at his feet for what seemed like forever. Although   I was told that I was dead for around 15 minutes, it could have been  a life time there.   I flet like I was on my knees for at least a lifetime,  because I just couldn't bring myself stand up to Him. And the whole time, He was just looking at me like I was the absolute apple of His eye.   
  
It’s absolutely incredible the love that He has for all of us or those of us who believe in Him. I don't know about the others. I just know me and because this is my experience.   

  Anyway, He must have sat down because He was not saying to me, 'Get up! Other people dying. Women having babies. People praying. I gotta go!' There was none of that.     He just sat down and let me go through my feelings because He knew apparently. I'm not trying     to say what Jesus knew or not, but to my impression, He knew that I had to go through it, which     I think I was repenting. I don't know, but whatever it was, I was on my knees and finally He got comfortable.     He just sat down and let me go through it peacefully. He was real relaxed and just sat there. He never left me. 

  Finally, after who knows how long when I finally stood up, then I was able to really observe Him.  I remember thinking, 'Whoa,' because I was already thinking His feet were giant, but I hadn’t     stood back yet. When I finally stood up  I could see all of  Him,  I was thinking, 'Wow!'     I was so blown away at how tall He was, like a giant.  Yet, I could see His face.  I remember thinking, 'Wow, I never realized how tall you were.'   Jesus  was thin; He wasn't fat, but He wasn't skinny. He was perfect. He had His white robe on and He had a staff.  His staff was tall too with a cradle on top of it.   Above the cradle was a sphere that was about four inches in diameter. The sphere was hovering above the cradle  about two or three inches and it was spinning.  I remember thinking, 'What is that? Let me have that.'   
  
  Jesus told me what it was but I don't remember. He told me a lot of things. I looked at staff. All of a  sudden, I felt like I better explain to Jesus that maybe I'm in the wrong place because I know I'm in heaven but I don't know about being dead. I say to Heavenly Father; I say, 'Jesus, I don't go to church anymore because it     seems like every time I go to church it's always the prejudiced person who wants to sit next to me and I'm way in the back already. It's like they purposely find me to sit next to me but they don't  want to greet me. That just turns me totally off, you know.' And I was telling Jesus, 'So I don't go to church anymore and I don't feel like I should have to because I talk to you all the time.'   
  
  He said to me, not in this exact way because He has His own way of saying things, but He said, 'I know. I am losing a lot of my lambs.' He calls us lambs. We’re His lambs.
  
  He said, 'I'm losing a lot of my lambs to the church for that very reason, because people are going to church trying to praise and worship me,  but they're being judged by others that are there. So, I don't have a problem with you not going, but… (and Heavenly Father doesn't insist anything, He recommends.)   
  
  After He said that, I must have asked Him a whole series of questions because He then went on to say there were three things that were important.  It may have been more than three things but this is what I specifically remember. He said that:   
  
  1)  fellowshipping was very important.  He understands about His lambs not going to the church but He said, 'Always stay in fellowship with other believers of Him. (Christ believers)   
  
  2) Forgiveness was absolutely huge and forgiveness has nothing to do with the other person's salvation. It has to do with your own salvation because up in heaven, He's already got a new world created for us. He doesn't want people that are in the new creation or the new place, to have black hearts. He doesn't want them to negatively affect others. If a person can't forgive someone, they can forget  going there. I’m not saying that people are going to hell if they can't forgive, but they will not be in the new place  because He doesn't want 'sour pusses' up there.      The lesson is that  if there's somebody who has hurt you or whatever the case is, move on! Forgive them and move on, because you want to go to the new place!
  
  3) And the third thing was 'Woe to those that hurt the children.' And He said it like 'Woe!' 'Woe' was what He said. 'To those that hurt the children.' And I'm not talking about parents spanking children. I'm talking about people exploiting them sexually, mentally and messing them up. Because the little ones don’t have protection. When He said that, I got the impression like I don't care how much you repent, it's not gonna matter.    He didn't say it but that's how I felt. I got that feeling like the exploiters are going to hell because that behavior is totally  unacceptable! That child had no defense at all.  

  I remember being very taken aback by that, like 'Oh my goodness!' because… the one thing that was really interesting to me was that the whole time I'm listening to Him, and mind you, this love is hitting me still over  and over. This love never stopped and I'm thinking to myself, 'How could He send anyone to hell? It was just the love coming out of Him, you just can't you can't imagine that He would send someone to hell, but apparently, He has to.  But He didn't show that side to me, because apparently I don't need it.  He didn't need to show this side to me.   
  
  We talked for a long time. I must have asked Him something about the animals because I love the animals. I don’t remember what He said, but after my experience with Him, I now have a peace about animals. I don’t know if they are with Him or not after they leave earth, but I’m sure they go to a wonderful place since I do have peace about it.    

  I said, 'But Heavenly Father!'   

  I realize the connection that I have with Him, it's a parent father-daughter connection, I won't say daughter because I don't know what I was. I was nothing… I wasn't a Female or Male. I was just an absolute supreme being with a big S on my chest. It was like I felt so incredibly powerful in His presence.     There was no suppression of my speech at all. There was no, 'Oh, you're talking too much. Shut up.'       Or 'That doesn't make sense. You’re stupid.' None of that. He was just so happy and pleased with me.  I  don't think my feet ever touch the ground at all.     
    
    After I'm finally comfortable enough, I realize that I remember Him. You know, it's like, 'Ooh, this is Dad! This is, this is Father!       I have been with Him before because we're talking and  He was looking at me like He understood me, like He couldn’t take His eyes off of me.  

    I remember it was the same as one time my cat went missing. I went knocking on everybody's door, 'Have you seen my cat?'       I was sick to my stomach because I lost my cat and I didn’t think I was ever gonna see her again.   After the third day, she came home after being locked in neighbor's garage.  When I found her, I put her in the house and I didn't want to let her out. I couldn't take my eyes off of her.       And it was the same thing with Jesus. It was like He lost me or, I know that's kind of weird to say because how could He lose anybody? I don't know, but it was like that. It was like He got me and He didn't want to let me go.     
    
  I was now standing up  again and  felt like I just wanted to talk to Him and couldn't stop talking. And He was laughing. He was very easy, relaxed, and laughing at me. I tickled Him. I think because I talked so much. I could be long winded. And so I was saying this and that. We talked for a long time. 
  
  Jesus told me Kindness was so important. Treat each other kindly. We are all connected and He wants us to treat each other like royalty. It makes Him so happy. He cries a lot for us  because the way we treat each other and how we treat ourselves.  Even like many of us go to work we give our customers or patients everything. We give them all this joy and love and then at the end of day we go home, take off makeup, brush teeth or whatever. But as we're looking at the mirror, we're finding bad things about ourselves       that we don't like. Then we criticize ourselves. This makes Him cry worse than ever because He sees us as absolutely perfect, absolute perfection.     
    
    For instance, I had really long dreads and I had to cut them because my hair was falling out after dying.  I don't like it short anymore, but I can't say that because I know Heavenly Father sees them as beautiful. So, I have to say, 'Oh my beautiful hair,' because I don't want to make Him cry again.       He wants us to sincerely compliment each other.  When I was in the hospital, I showered the doctors and nurses with compliments, because Jesus was still with me. I would feel Him so much that I couldn't help myself but to say something nice about whoever it was.     If a doctor came in, I said, 'Ahh, look, that's the cutest top you have on!' Or 'Those earrings are pretty.' Or, ' That's a nice tie.' Or, 'Boy that's a nice beard. You keep it so nice and groomed.'       And the people would just light up. Some of them would even cry.  I remember being able to witness this and it would almost make me cry because we’re all so starving for someone to tell us something good about ourselves.     
    
    And that's why Heavenly Father is always sad, because we really are so beautiful. We're so powerful and magnificent and we don't see it in ourselves. When we see it in other people, we don't even say it. And it hurts me to even talk about this because I saw with my own eyes how people would just hang on to me after I told them, 'Oh that's a beautiful shirt that you have on. It looks so nice on you with your hair.'       It made them feel good. That’s telling God, 'Thank you for creating us.' Because remember, He toiled and toiled to get us perfect. That really stuck with me. 

     Now, I'm so connected with Heavenly Father that I can remember a lot more about my experience. I remember being there talking to Him and all of a sudden I stopped and  said, 'Whoa, we're not speaking English. We were not Speaking English at all.' I have no idea what it was. Many people ask  me, 'Could it have been ancient Hebrew?' I have no idea because I don't speak ancient Hebrew, but then Peggi told me the other day, she said, 'It could have been Aramaic.' I have a feeling that's what it was because for some reason the ancient Hebrew did not sit well with me. But when she said that, I thought, 'That might have been it.' Whatever the case, I was fluent in it. At the time, I knew exactly what it was and I knew every word He was saying because I was able to speak right back to Him.     
    
    We did a lot of talking. I don't care what I asked Him, He answered it patiently and until I  fully understood Him.       There was never rushing me like, 'Oh, let me hurry,' or, 'You don't need to know that.' None of it. I don't care what I asked Him, He told me in the way that I would Understand.     One of the things that has always bothered me about the crucifix with Jesus on it, it’s showing Him dead but in Heaven He is definitely on a throne.     Yet, over there,     He has a throne and He has little baby throne next to it for us. But who cares about the throne, I wanted to sit on His lap. Oh my goodness – His lap because He’s giant!     
    
    I don't know how big I was, but I know when I sat on His lap, it was perfect. It was so cozy. I didn't have to do any adjustments because when I sat down, automatically I was comfortable. That's why I wanted to be on His lap the whole time. It was like sitting on a cloud and His breath was so sweet. And so, I'm talking to Him on His lap, and He has no problem with you being on it, He likes it (not sexually) but He likes it. Your comfort in Him, your enjoyment in Him - He loves it. 
    
            Peggi told me that on the recording when I first spoke that I'd met Jesus, I told her that He asked me, what did I want to take back with me to this earthly existence?    I don't remember. But the one thing that I have been able to do is hear God now speaking to me without a question that it's Him speaking to me.  I believe maybe I would have said to Him, 'I want to know it’s you when I hear You.' Like, 'When I hear your calling, I will know it is you and I will understand what it is you’re wanting from me.' Because I can do that now without a shadow of a doubt. If there’s something I want to do, I'll say, 'Heavenly Father,' because He wants us to go to Him First. Period. Not girlfriend. Not Boyfriend.  Not mom and dad. Him.   
  
        Peggi told me that when I told her the story, that when I first came to meet Jesus, she said I told her that I said He was black, but then later I said He was white. She was asking me to clarify what color Jesus was. I told her, 'He comes to you as your most comfortable.'         He could have came to me blue, green or purple and I wouldn’t have cared because the love is all that's important to me, then and it still is. In my mind He came to me the color of love.    

    At one point, I must have asked Him about Satan and his hold that he has on this world. He showed me His left eye.The iris of His eye looked like a blue world,  but it wasn't Earth.          When Heavenly Father was telling me, 'Listen. Don't worry about him. He can’t hurt you.'  Satan is afraid of  our connection with and remembering of Heavenly Father. That's why whatever Satan does he's able to block the memory or shield it from us.   

  God told me so much, when I was in Heaven, I could not differentiate the Father, the Holy Spirit and the Son. Jesus was it! There was nobody He had to go to like His Father. He was it, at least with me. He didn’t say I have to go discuss it with Father, so I think that’s that Trinity.     I don't know how to explain it. I don't care to explain. I'm just telling you what I was experiencing.   

  Whatever Satan  does,  he doesn't want us to remember God.     I remember very vividly sitting on Jesus’ lap and Him saying, 'But he cannot hurt you. And he knows it.' We just don’t know it. We fall into that lie that Satan is  more powerful than us, we who are of Christ, and he's not.  Jesus is not on the cross. He is on His throne and His is coming.

   I must have said something about the ocean, because I'm really passionate about the ocean and the plastic in it. Heavenly Father, I don’t know if He said it, but the impression that I got was 'I'm done with Earth. I'm not gonna fix it.     I have already got a new world and I'm just coming for my lambs.'     That’s us. Believers. He’s not going to fix it, because it's too dark.     When I was in Heaven with Heavenly Father, He could not look at Earth straight on at all because it's so black here. It's too heavy because He's so much Light and love and when I came back to Earth, I see now why Heavenly Father is that way, because it's hard to even look at things.               
    
    I remember thinking, 'Why is He showing me this?' but I don't remember why but when I get back on this side, I pondered, 'What does that mean?'      My Interpretation  could be dead wrong. I have no idea, but I’m gonna tell you anyway. I think He was showing me to say that the first time when Heavenly Father was here and He left afterwards with the disciples. After He came out of the cave and He stands again; the disciples wanted Him to stay and they wanted to go with Him.  Heavenly Father said, 'No, I'm going to leave the Holy Spirit to dwell within you.'    I think that was because, when He showed me the world within Him,  that we would now dwell within Him so that never again will Satan be able to do what He's done to us.         We know that good and evil can both dwell within us, because of our actions show us that and proves it, but good and evil cannot dwell in Jesus - only good.     
    
    So, by Him showing me the blue world in His eye, I took that to be that we would then dwell within Him, Heavenly Father so that evil can never again inhabit us and change what God created us to be and that's to be fruitful. We got the multiplying down but what we don't have down what is  fruitful. Being fruitful is about being  joyful, loving, happy, and alive!      
    
    When I was up in heaven, I realized that we don't know what being alive is until we die or until you live and go to heaven. On earth, this body had  been sick for so long and I my lungs always hurt.  Yet there, we are so powerful and I remember thinking, 'Oh my body is not Hurting.  And I could breathe and  I felt so invigorated. There was nothing that I couldn't do! If I wanted to fly, I didn't  need wings to do it. If Satan was standing in front of me, all I had to do was look at him and he would disappear. That's how powerful we are!     
    
    Here, we don't even know what love       is. We think we do. But No, we don't know until we have Heavenly Father looking at you with those eyes of His and that love coming at You.  It’s so powerful, it knocks you out. It’s just BANG! Now I know, now I know what when people say, 'I've been knocked out. It knocked me out with love!' Yeah, it knocks you flat out!        
    
       I must have fallen asleep or whatever the case was. I must have shut my mouth because He stood up and went into a doorframe or a portal because there was no house attached to the doorframe. His feet were half way over the threshhold. He filled out the whole door.  When He stood up the  doorframe appeared.  He must have opened the door on the other end, so I could hear where He wanted to take         me.  I heard so much joy. It was  like  a picnic, with no ants, no fighting couples, no dog crap, none of that.  There was only  absolute harmony and love.  That's  that's where He  wanted to take me.  I know now why He opened the door, so         I could hear because  He already knew that I would ask to come back. So, I think He wanted to tempt me with 'Look.' Yet It was entirely my  choice because if it was up to Him, I would not be sitting here at all. I would have still been  there, because He did not want me to come back.      
    
    He looked at me and asked, 'What would you like to do?' 
    
    And I knew it. I can feel it and I went into absolute panic for the first time. If you could believe it, I had anxiety in Heaven.  I thought, 'Uh!' And I can feel how deeply He didn't want to let me go back. I could feel it and I said, ' Oh but Dad, I have, uh, I have to go back! Best friend can’t drive the…oh, I got my cats!' I panicked. What was I thinking? Because it is a mess down here.
    
    After pleading with Him to let me come back, He finally said, 'Okay.'  I remember being back on His lap, and like any loving parent, He started telling me about this and that and what to look out for. He reminded me to  'Don't go too far to where you can't hear me call you.'

     That's when I realized, 'I have crossed over,' because all this time I didn't know I was dead. I have no idea what I'd like to do.  I just know that I'm alive and I realized, 'OOOOH! Oh my goodness!'  I panicked…                          


     Now, I see the darkness. I see  all of the television shows with bickering couples. If they want to be in love, some outside source comes in and stirs up havoc or everybody is trying to go to work and have nice things but it's never     good enough. There's always something holding us back. It’s  just dark here. It's not like That in Heaven.     
    
    Heaven is, I don't care what you want to be as long as it’s of love, you can do it. If you want to be, let's say you’re a man and you like cooking, you're not going to be told 'that’s Female work.' Heavenly Father will say, 'Okay, let's go cook! And that’s another thing. Heavenly Father will do it with you. Me, I like to build and He didn't tell me, 'Don’t don’t, Argh! That’s for guys!' Nope!  'Let’s go build something!'     
    
    He builds you up. All of us were created in His image and we were all in His house and Satan doesn't want us to know that because when I went back to Heaven, like I said, I knew exactly it was Jesus! Whatever name you have for Him is whatever, but my name for Him is Jesus the Christ and I knew exactly, no one had to say, 'This is Jesus.' I knew exactly who it was and then I remembered and that's why I fell to my knees.  I remember sitting on lap the first time Him telling me, 'You know, Satan is tricky. He’s Blah Blah Blah.' 'Yeah, Dad! I got it! I’m good! I understand!'     
    
    And then soon as I leave to come to earth, BLAM, I forget. Then I got to go back and Face Jesus, Heavenly Father,ashamed and that's what it was. That's why I was on my knees. I was ashamed that I forgot and that I fell in the trap.     
    
    So, now I’m on His lap getting ready to come back and He's telling me about Satan and He can't hurt you and everything. He was reading me the rights and I was getting that.  I said, 'Yes.' Yes, but I was so like a little child, wanting to hurry up to get out of there and come back.     
    
    I don't remember coming back in a tube or Wormhole but I do remember rolling over off His lap, and then I was back here. All of a sudden, I felt heavy, like a heavy weight was on me. Then I felt like I was looking around because I'm looking for Satan and I'm now feeling scared. Everything God just told me just went right out the door. Oh boy, and I just fell back into it. But the good thing is that I still remember what it was like being on the other side.     
    
Satan is afraid of our connection because he knows that when we stand before the Heavenly Father like I had done, he's got no chance with us – none at all! So he wants to block that connection and he does a good job at it by getting us distracted constantly.     

Men are spending more time at football games than to even thinking about the Father and they want to complain; we all want to complain about what we don't have, but it's because of our own doing, because God has provided us with everything to live a thriving life     

    We don't want to celebrate the good. We all want to think about the negative.      TV is full of murder and killings and rapings. Who wants to see that?     
    
    I felt Jesus is coming for His Lambs but I don’t know WHEN He is coming.  I know  He wants me to stay close to Him so I can hear Him when He calls. And that’s just what I am doing now.

There was no doubt who it was. It was Jesus! And I fell down on my knees because the love that was coming from him was so intense that I couldn't even stand up.    I remember being under a gazebo type structure.  There were a few of these gazebos,  like platform stages. Some people were cooking, and others were performing music.  I sat with Jesus and ate food. A nice lady served me. Part of me wants to say she was blue. She fed me food that was so good, I smashed it all over my face, it was so good. It was some kind of really juicy fruit.

I was told I was going to hell because I didn't go to church, when I was 13 I wore lipstick, when I was little, I liked to do what boys did (Wear pants, build gocarts, etc) I always thought I was going to hell for that. When I got to Heaven and saw how He will built with me, I was in my bliss!    
    
Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         Uncertain         

    Did you seem to encounter a mystical being or presence, or hear an unidentifiable voice?         I encountered a definite being, or a voice clearly of mystical or unearthly origin.   It was Jesus.  I knew right away it was Jesus/Heavenly Father.    (NOTE FROM PEGGI - Sheila used to think they were separate beings as I did. The Father (Most High/I Am that I Am) and Jesus, the son of God. BUT after her experience, she believes they are one. She can't explain it.    
    
Did you see deceased or religious spirits?         No    

Did you encounter or become aware of any beings who previously lived on earth who are described by name in religions (for example: Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, etc.)?         Yes   Jesus was it! 

During your experience, did you gain information about premortal existence?         Uncertain     I had a definite knowing I had lived before. I felt God was wanting me to take respite - Like, 'You've had enough. Rest.'    

    During your experience, did you gain information about universal connection or oneness?         Yes     I felt we're all  best friends in Heaven. But there are some on earth who belong to the darkness. They are not included.    
    
During your experience, did you gain information about the existence of God?         Yes     I sat on His Lap! He was THE MAN! MY GOD! It was JESUS! NO DOUBT!    

Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:         

During your experience, did you gain special knowledge or information about your purpose?      Yes   Jesus loves us more than we've been led to believe. There is an enemy who wants to destroy us. He will do anything to destroy our connection and relationship to Jesus...ANYTHING. and he's not afraid of us, he's afraid of our relationship with Jesus.    

During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?         Yes     I felt like I needed to go back to earth to bring others to Him... 'Let me go! I'll go get them.' We love God so much we want to please Him. We feel we want to go back and please Him, but it is so dark here...we are not superbeings on earth like in Heaven.    

During your experience, did you gain information about an afterlife?         An afterlife definitely exists     Yes     By hearing the picnic behind Him- there was life behind Him - and I FELT INCREDIBLY ALIVE!    

Did you gain information about how to live our lives?         Yes     I know that I've done this before (lived lives -uncertain if they were here one earth)    

During your experience, did you gain information about life's difficulties, challenges and hardships?         Yes     Yes, Satan is our enemy and he will do anything to deceive and destroy us. Stick close to Jesus so when He calls, we will hear    

During your experience, did you gain information about love?         Yes     Yes, I never experienced such great love here on earth.    

What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         Large changes in my life     I feel I can Hear Father talk to me- answer my prayers to Him. I feel I know it is Him giving me guidance. He asked me during my experience, 'What do you want to take back with you?' Regarding what it is I wanted to take back. I told Peggi this and just when I was going to tell her what it was, nurses and doctors charged in the room to look at how great I looked- how healthy I looked..they were amazed. Peggi wanted to scream and push them out of the room because I was just about to tell her what it was. When they left, I misunderstood the question and said He gave me Life - which He did, but that wasn't what I was going to say. I believe I would have asked Him to be able to actually Hear Him give me guidance and answer my prayers.     Now I speak out about Christianity whereas before I did not. Now I and am trying to Help Jesus get His children Home. I am trying to get people to revisit the words of Christ and rebuild their relationship with Him or do it for the first time. Then I just want to go home to Him and get on His lap and feel His love!    

Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          Yes They are richer... My relationship with Peggi is soley focused on Jesus and we're more patient with each other. I am more patient and forgiving because I know at home, we all love each other.  I am more trusting in Jesus.    

After the NDE:         

Was the experience difficult to express in words?        Yes   I don't have the words to describe Jesus' love. Mighty isn't the right word. My words are not LARGE enough!    

How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  I don't remember the heart attacks, CPR, going to the actual hospital, being in the hotel room the night before, etc. I vaguely remember having the breathing tube in my mouth.. I remember a woman nurse walking by me with a smile and checking in on me while I was tied up with tube in mouth. She walked by me and I wished she would scratch my forehead and nose because my forehead itched.    

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         Yes     I can hear God better- definitely    

Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          Sitting on God's lap and knowing how much HE loves us and how forgiving He is.    

Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    I shared it with Peggi right away and shared with my father what Jesus wants us to do (forgive, be kind, etc.)and then with friends and medical professionals when I came back and then a year later when I felt strong enough, I started youtube channel sharing how much our Father loves us!  Most were receptive in a positive way- some cried and said that was the exact thing they needed to hear, but a few poo pood it or didn't respond.    

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       Yes   Peggi shared a few stories over the years with me- very little AND our friend Louis had a near death experience when he died. While Peggi was driving with her friend to see him in the hospital which was about a 30 minute drive, Louis died and was dead for 15 minutes. When Peggi arrived, the nurses said he was the miracle patient and just came alive again. He spoke for the first time and said he had a dream and saw his deceased family members: mom, dad, and sister. He felt great love. He didn't want to go back. His mom said he had something to finish and took a switch (like she did with all her 12 children to shoo them away or to do something she needed them to do or not do - never abusive) and chased him back and he woke up in his body on earth.   But I never really paid attention. If it wasn't about motorcycles, iron man, golf, or building, I didn't care or give it much thought. I am type A personality.    

What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real     It was real without a doubt- I don't care what anyone thinks- it is REAL!    

What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real     Same! Jesus wants His lambs home to Him! He is concerned he is 'losing too many of His lambs to Satan.' (I said this too shortly after coming out of my experience.)    

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       Yes   I feel God near me when He is. I can feel Him now when He is near.    

Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?         We, those of us who are of God's seed - have a conscience) are all connected and we all love each other so much when we're home- regardless of your spiritual background, color, sex. We just get here and we forget and Satan uses that against us. I am absolutely convinced of it.    

Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?         You did an excellent job!
