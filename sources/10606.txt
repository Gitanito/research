  		              		Experience Description:   

  					  I collapsed due to a potential drug overdose experiment with Librium which became overpowering. After I dropped a glass ashtray that broke a sharp piece cut into my heel. I was bleeding profusely from my heel and passed out. Now here is what I experience next:

I traveled out of my body and became conscious again. I could not see my body or where I was, except I was moving fast. It was very black, then a light appeared which seemed to be down/up/or along a tunnel. Next thing I felt higher than I have ever been in life, I felt a deep state of tranquility, love.

MOST MOVING PART IS NEXT: Suddenly my recently deceased father (nine months before) appeared and told me it's not my time and I have to go back. I tried to resist but all of a sudden, I could see my mother working on me, trying to revive me and bandage my foot. I was looking down on my mother and my lifeless body. I felt very sad for her and then struggled to get back into my body and then I came to in my body, very groggy but conscious.

I tried to tell my mother what happened but she did not think much of it and she called an ambulance that came and took me to the hospital where they pumped my stomach - I lived.
