  		              		Experience Description   

  Nine years ago, I was busy putting on makeup in the restroom before going to work.  All of a sudden, I felt a chill that went from my head and traveled down my body. I knew it was not a good sign, so I sat down on the toilet. 

In less than a second, the pain was gone.  I saw a sheet of white, bright light appearing before me. I felt safe and all the pressure was gone. I had no need to deal with tough problems, and no longer worried about my children.  I felt calm and happy.  I said to myself, 'It is so nice here that I want to stay.' Unfortunately, after a while, there was a voice telling me, 'Go back, you still have a lot to do, and you need to go to work.'  I felt depressed and woke up with a sense of loss.   

  Later, I regained consciousness on the cold, marble floor in the bathroom. I called for an ambulance after I woke up and they took me to the hospital.  The doctor examined my heart, brain, nerves, and the rest of the body.  Everything was fine except my face and head where I had fallen on the floor. I lost consciousness and collapsed several times afterwards, but I had not experienced that state of happiness again.  

What I learned is that death is not horrible when I know that I will go to a place without worries or family burdens. I felt such relief. It is a peaceful, pleasant, and safe place that made me forget about everything on earth.  Heaven is very beautiful and calm. I am no longer afraid of death now.
