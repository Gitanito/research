    When I was a teenager, I played on the riverside and was swept away by the tide and drowned. At that time, I couldn't swim, and I sank to the bottom of the river. I struggled hard to go upstream, but I was drowning for a long time, couldn't breathe, and lost consciousness. But after losing consciousness, I suddenly regained it. I saw my body was under the field in a vantage point at that time, about two meters away. It was like a soul out of the body, and I became relaxed and not struggled anymore. I heard peaceful music that sounded a bit similar to the ritual music of Western churches, and also like Chinese music as well, and then I saw my whole experience from childhood to adulthood through a third-person perspective; I saw my dead father, and some people I didn’t know. This playback was like a slideshow on a movie film, and its speed is super fast but the content is crispy clear, my whole life rewound in a blink of my eyes, and then a white light appears all around the surrounding area of my body. In a certain direction of the light, I remember that it should be above, there was a particularly bright opening, then I was sent out by a mysterious force from this opening.  After I surfaced out of the water, I went directly to the shore. I will stop right now even though there were more that had happened afterward.
