I was in a coma for five days.  On one of those days I heard a heart monitor go off, it was mine. I was looking down at my body and noticed there was a dead person covered from head to toe with a sheet onto my right. I floated as a white glow surrounded my being. Down below where my body was a doctor that I could plainly hear was saying that he was not going to lose another one and started to do CPR. I did not want to return to my body and I waved my arms so that he would stop but he did not notice me at all. I returned to my body. When I awoke from coma I no longer feared death!
