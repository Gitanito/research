  		              		Experience Description   

    I was brought into the operating room for an Endoscopy, hooked up to all the things they hook you up to and oxygen tube placed under my nostrils. A nurse and the anesthesiologist were the only people in the room, one on each side of me. The anesthesia was given through an IV inserted in my left hand. They were both pleasant and chatted jokingly. I started to feel the anesthesia as the room swelled and swayed. Next thing I know, I’m flying very fast through a blue/green fluoresce tunnel, there is someone on each side of me and we are talking. It feels like it might be the nurse and the anesthesiologist. I am feeling euphoric. It feels like I am traveling faster than the speed of light, like in a sci-fi movie being transported through space. It seems like this continues for a long time, it feels very nice and I don’t want it to end. The two beings are with me, talking and supportive. Then I feel myself slowing down and coming back down, slipping into my body. I start to wake up thinking, 'What a trip.' I’m in the recovery room, still hooked up to all the apparatus and oxygen which seemed odd to me because I’d had a colonoscopy a month before and when I awoke then, from the anesthesia, I had been disconnected from all that stuff. This time they kept me connected for another half hour, or so. When the doctor came to check on me he asked if I had sleep-apnea, which I do not. He didn’t elaborate much but in the written report said I 'tolerated the procedure poorly due to respiratory instability.'

I was mostly aware of the blue/green fluorescent tunnel as I raced through it.  

Please compare your hearing during the experience to your everyday hearing that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.      I’m not sure. We were talking but I don’t remember what we said.

God, Spiritual and Religion:       

What was your religion prior to your experience?      Other faiths- New age   I consider myself a spiritual person, not religious. I have 'New Age' beliefs but don’t practice, meet with others or participate in any ritual around those beliefs.  

Have your religious practices changed since your experience?         No       

What is your religion now?         Other faiths- New age   There was a time in my past when I studied and participated in spiritual 'healing' workshops.  

Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was entirely consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience     At the time of the experience I was not trying to understand what was happening or thinking that I might be 'passing over.' At the same time, I do and did believe that there are other dimensions and energy that continues to exist after our death.  

Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         No       

Did you seem to encounter a mystical being or presence, or hear an unidentifiable voice?         I encountered a definite being, or a voice clearly of mystical or unearthly origin   I’m not sure if the two beings with me were mystical but there were definitely two beings, one on each side of me, taking with me.  

Did you see deceased or religious spirits?         No  

Did you encounter or become aware of any beings who previously lived on earth who are described by name in religions (for example: Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, etc.)?         No     

During your experience, did you gain information about premortal existence?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about universal connection or oneness?         Uncertain     Not sure if I would call it specific information but my travel through the tunnel felt real and was carrying me to a different 'dimension.'  

During your experience, did you gain information about the existence of God?         No       

Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:       

During your experience, did you gain special knowledge or information about your purpose?      No     

During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about an afterlife?         An afterlife definitely exists     No       

Did you gain information about how to live our lives?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about life's difficulties, challenges and hardships?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about love?         No       

What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         No changes in my life     This only happened yesterday so I am still processing the event. It feels like a confirmation of what I believe, it feels like a huge event that is interesting as heck and surprising. It’s made me think about my own fragile mortality, which doesn’t scare me, but makes me think how unexpected loss devastates your loved ones left behind.  I guess I’ll try to hang around until my time comes.  

Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          No   

After the NDE:       

Was the experience difficult to express in words?        No     

How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience as accurately as other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  I remember waiting to go into the procedure and then being wheeled in and being given the anesthesia. I remember feeling surprised that 'going under' was not a blank piece of lost time, it was vivid and euphoric. I also remember the feeling of returning to consciousness as a 'transition' into the physical rather than waking up from dreams forgotten or empty nothingness.  

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         No       

Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          It was one long trip that was unchanging and felt significant. I only wish I could remember what we were talking about.  

Have you ever shared this experience with others?       No      

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       Yes   I have studied spiritual beliefs connected with afterlife and had friends who have helped a loved pass-over. I have received messages from a loved one after he passed so NDE does not seem ludicrous to me.  

What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real     I remember telling my mom, upon waking after recovery, 'What a trip' and telling her about it. My stepfather had experienced a lucid, subconscious event years ago while battling a life threatening illness and it felt a little like that but I hadn’t considered that I came close to 'passing over.' I only realized it was a real experience hours after returning home. Not sure if I could trust my own feelings but sensing that it was an important event I went online and learned that it’s been proven that under anesthesia the brain shows no activity. So what I experienced was not a dream but an actual event.  

What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real     This happened to me yesterday so not much time has passed for me to feel differently.  

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       No     

Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?         That’s it.
