I remember being on shore by the dock and looking back in the yard as my family was having a barbeque. I walked to the end of the dock and stood at the edge looking down into the water, next thing I know I'm submerged in the lake sinking to the bottom. I faintly remember starting to panic, but then the area began to get really bright almost animated in a sense. I remember staring at some seaweed that was swaying in front of me and being at ease with my surroundings. The scared feeling went away when I felt like I was no longer alone down there - it was surreal I guess. I didn't exactly SEE a presence, but I DEFINITELY FELT IT. It also felt like time slowed and I was in my own kind of heaven. Next thing I know I'm on my dad's shoulder and he's hitting my back and I'm spitting out water from my lungs. What it taught me was that death isn't painful or something we should fear - I actually respect it now and welcome it - don't get the wrong idea I'm not suicidal by any means.
