It's strange to describe but the closest thing I could think of to it is the sensation of not being able to breathe. I felt my heart stop. 

I lost consciousness, then I felt myself rise up, and I was looking at myself. I could hear the doctors and nurses calling me and I could see my husband and my new baby. My hubby was looking so helpless. The room looked slightly different, like it was hazy. I keep yelling, 'I am here, I am right here!' but no one could hear me. 

Finally they gave me ephedrine to get my heart going again and I felt myself plunge back into my body and take a breath, like being underwater and coming up for air.
