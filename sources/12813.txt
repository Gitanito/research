  		              		Experience Description   

    I was with a friend in her car. She recognized that I was having a heart attack, not indigestion as I thought.  She said I turned white as a sheet of paper and broke out into  a cold sweet.  She raced me to the nearest emergency room since it was only 2 minutes away.  An ambulance would have taken longer.  She said she was astounded how calm I was when I walked into the emergency room as I told them I was having a heart attack.  I find it interesting that I knew certain  things that day. These things were   not just a question of belief or supposition, I just knew.  I was unquestionably aware that I was dying.  This was not a belief, but knowledge with absolute certainty that as this process went on, I was dying.  Without  an external intervention, the dying process would continue.  
  
  I became aware of 'everything', such as my position on the table and the movement of the earth.  It wasn't quite like  I was dissolving, but rather like I was disconnecting or becoming unsynchronized with the universe.  I was calmly aware of everyone around me and what they were doing. I know I was not connected to my body.  I was on my way to somewhere else, but there are no words to describe it.  Words like 'up' or'down' lacked meaning.  I’ve read many accounts of NDE and, except for those that sound like a movie concept, I found few that really describe the experience.  Not surprisingly, it may be unique to each of us. It was that disconnected experience, as though the connected portion of our existence blocks another realm, whatever that is.  I just know I was on my way to the next realm.  I was not frightened but very accepting of it because this was just a transition. 
  
  I remember them calling for the defibrillator.  I remember the computer voice giving them instructions and ending with 'begin CPR.'  I never felt the shock.  It was later that my doctor thought my body and pain receptors had ceased functioning and that I may have been been 'somewhere else' but still aware of the room.    Since this experience, I have spent a lot of time afterwards talking with priests.  I don’t know about angels, lights, deceased relatives saying come into the light or go back, etc.  I came from my experience with only three things I am absolutely certain of - this corporeal existence is a transitory part and there is more to existence, there is nothing to fear, and the afterlife is not we think it is.
