I passed out. I then started to walk towards a very peaceful light sort of a tunnel and just a tremendous sense of joy. As I got closer to the end of the tunnel, I heard an older man's voice that said it was not my time yet. 

Then I awoke on the operating table. I heard the doctors and nurses saying that I was waking up. Then they administered something that knocked me out again.
