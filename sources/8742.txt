  		      2066.        Ali K NDE       12/20/2009.      NDE 4229.       From Turkey. Original in Turkish, translated to English Aylin.      I watched the 'me' in the tunnel from two to three meters distance from above. When I looked at myself I saw at the end of the tunnel a place with yellowish colorful mist at the sky, which illuminated the place like a sun illuminates the days and this light shined into the tunnel.  
   NDE from heart attack.   

    2065.        Bo FDE       12/20/2009.      FDE 4221.       From Sweden. Original in Swedish, translated to English by John S.      At this moment my life started to replay like a movie, and view it for me until this very day. As the time went by I began to sink deeper and deeper, and when my friend, who was holding my hand, hoping to pulling me up, started to glide towards the ice hole and fall into the current water I told him: 'Let go of me, it's better that one of us is drowning than the both of us.' At this moment, I only had my head and one arm above the surface of the water. Then something happened, that was beyond all human capacity, and suddenly we were both lying on firm ice and soon after that we could get ashore. My friend told me later that I suddenly was as light as his younger brother.

    2064.        Lynne H NDE       12/20/2009.      NDE 4233.       From the UK.      I floated upwards. I felt I was floating up a tunnel or beam, like to a space ship, but it was all foggy and grey. I couldn't see what was behind me because I was floating backwards along this tunnel (like the one going to a plane). It was going upwards at an angle of about seventy degrees. I felt a pressure at the back of my spirit head as if I was stopped from going any further. I heard the voice, which I assumed was God asking if I was sure about my decision to leave. When you are out of your body, you are pure love and only make decisions with the purest intentions. You are totally unselfish. I was asked to think about what would happen if I left now. I saw a scene of my daughter being brought up by her grandparents, with my husband paying the odd visit now and again. She was brought up very strictly and was deeply unhappy, nervous, and frightened. I then compared it to how I would bring her up and had to make the decision to go back.  
   NDE due to complications after delivery.   

    2063.        Polly R Probable NDE       12/20/2009.      Probable NDE 4231.             Then I passed out. I do not remember much on the breathing tube ordeal, but I was fully aware of what was happening.  I could not talk or move, but my mind was very aware. That was the scariest part of the whole thing, as if being trapped and not being able to move speak or tell what's wrong. I could hear everything, all doctor's discussions and more. Finally, I heard 'congestive heart failure.' But again, I could do nothing.

    2062.        Kim C NDE       12/20/2009.      NDE 4230.             I was standing behind the couch, and then I realized I was not in my body. I saw my mom run to the back of the couch. She was trying to wake me up and slapping my cheeks but my body had no response. It was as if I was in between the couch and my mom. I could see and hear everything and everyone but all I remember feeling is peace and calmness. I had no fear. I could see my boyfriend at the time across the room standing next to our friend.  My brother's girlfriend was sitting in a rocking chair.  Everyone was staring at my body.  
   NDE due to episode of unconsciousness from unknown cause.   

    2061.        Rick H Possible NDE       12/20/2009.      Possible NDE 4228.             I continually had a white veil covering my physical eyes. During which time I could hear arguing in the background, all the while getting a strange feeling as though it were all over me. Yet there was only one voice that I could hear clearly.  I heard the accusations against me.  Those words still to this day ring in my mind. Afterwards, I was standing above the world looking down upon it, just as I saw the creation begin and every man and woman that is upon the earth today, then I saw a fire spread across the land for I then knew many answers.  
   Possible NDE due to multiple seizures.   

    2060.        Deroan FDE       12/20/2009.      FDE 4227.             In that instant, something happened to me, some kind of 'rush' and in that one instant, prior to contact, my entire life 'flashed before my eyes', just like they describe it on TV shows or in movies or what not, my life flashed from start to end and in the one moment I knew every moment of my life.

    2059.        Rick Probable NDE       12/20/2009.      Probable NDE 4226.             In my near death experience, I was standing in my family's cemetery. Everyone in the cemetery is a relative of mine. The graves date back to 1869. I saw a number of my dead relatives standing around me; however, none of them could see me. In this experience, there were no tombstones in the cemetery. Some of the people that I saw there died before I was born, yet I am able to describe their mannerisms. I walked through the crowd of dead relatives, and noticed that they were looking in one direction, as if they were waiting for a car to arrive. I realized that they could not see me even when I walked right beside some of them. I decided to leave the scene because I felt that I was not the person that they were looking for. When I woke up, I was being run down the hall of a hospital on a stretcher.  
   Probable NDE due to illness.   

    2058.        Brianna C NDE       12/19/2009.      NDE 4224.             It was very loud and shaky I felt so scared. It got worse and worse as I came back into my body. I wiggled my fingers and toes and then proceeded to move the rest of my body. I got up and made my way to the bathroom to see what was wrong with me because my head was pounding. I walked back to the kitchen and as I sat down the neighbor guy and the paramedics rushed in to me. The neighbor told me he thought I was dead because I had no heartbeat, nor was I breathing.  
   NDE due to heroin overdose.   

    2057.        Tina Probable NDE       12/19/2009.      Probable NDE 4223.             Down on the plain far below I saw six figures, five dancing around one stationary in the center. I floated down in an instant, like zipped down with no sense of air whooshing by, just outside this circle of dancers. They were dancing skeletons with rags and shreds of flesh on them. They were menacing a bit at me, but once I caught the eyes of the one in the center, all fear, all doubt dropped away. This man had blonde hair and blue eyes.  He was smiling, no really smirking at me. He seemed like a long lost friend who was going to say 'I told you so,' any minute. He was in plain black from neck to toe - like a turtleneck and plain pants and shoes, but I'm not sure about anything but his face and hands.  
   Probable NDE due to accidental overdose of sleeping pills at about age two.   

    2056.        Becca L NDE       12/19/2009.      NDE 4218.             I came to the realization that I couldn't stop the speeding ball. It was heading straight for my face. I ducked a bit but my efforts made no difference. The ball hit me square in the eye. I suddenly felt my world spiral; I saw a bright light, and then total darkness. I heard the crowd gasp. I saw my childhood, my entire short life flash before my eyes like a film. I landed with a loud thud against the soft dirt of the mound. I felt I was dead. Gone. An immense feeling of peace overcame me as I let my eyes close. I woke up with a broken eye socket and a hospital band on my wrist.

    2055.        Mark A NDE       12/19/2009.      NDE 4217.             Here is what happened, all of a sudden there I was watching three hooded figures sitting around a campfire at what appeared to be night. When I crashed it was noon daytime!! I don't know if I was floating or standing or if I was clothed or naked. None of that seemed important, it felt as if I was in a trance watching the campfire and the three hooded figures speak... Then all of a sudden, they turned and looked at me and spoke all in unison at the same time. Now I could understand what they said. I don't know if what they said was in English or in their tongue. All I know is that I understood it!! They said to me that I was not supposed to be there!!  
   NDE due to motorcycle accident with atypical content.   

    2054.        Vanessa H Probable NDE       12/19/2009.      Probable NDE 4216.             During the course of this they found out that I had double pneumonia and also I was suffering from a staph infection. When this presence came to me in my sleep, it took me on a journey that I will never forget. I started to feel very peaceful. Then I was gliding through this light it was so heavenly and the most beautiful thing I ever saw in my life. The brightness of it you can't explain. It didn't hurt it wasn't so bright that you couldn't look at it. I wanted to stay because at that point I had no pain like most of the time in my life that I do. Then as the presence took me further in that's when a voice came out of this light and said take her back she is not ready to go yet (meaning die).  
   Probable NDE due to complication of asthma attack.   

    2053.        Rita S NDE       11/21/2009.      NDE 22173.             The first event that I can remember was when I was three years old. I was in a swimming pool. I couldn’t swim, and I somehow walked to the far end. I went under the water and started drowning. The water burned, but the next thing I knew, I could see a lady sunbathing next to the pool and seeing myself drowning! I wondered why she couldn’t see me. Then I remember that I was on the ground and they were trying to resuscitate me.  
   NDE from drowning at age 3 and multiple OBEs.   

    2052.        Laurent B NDE       12/12/2009.      NDE 4215.       From France. Original in French, translated by Kathy.      I saw myself struggling and drowning, I saw myself, me, like my own twin who was drowning and well below the surface. I couldn't say which of my twin or I was conscious but the feeling I had observing this scene was sweet, light, beyond peaceful. I felt weightless under the water, calm and serene, in no way panicky, no pain of any kind, just a spectator, in fact I was feeling very good indeed. At one point I became aware of a sort of white glow which, how can I say - was approaching and growing until the final becoming of a total whole.

    2051.        Lisette D NDE       12/6/2009.      NDE 4206.       From Canada. Original in French, translated by Kathy.      I felt euphoric then suddenly the images, the butterfly, everything changed. Gradually, the colors disappeared I was seeing in black and white and then the images disappeared. There weren't any more images, just sounds. I didn't feel as though I was in a tunnel, I was following the presence who was with me, with unconditional trust and we laughed and talked a lot. Then we were approaching a group of presences because I could hear many voices. I heard, 'What's SHE doing here? She mustn't go on; she has to be sent back.'

    2050.        Tom C NDE       12/6/2009.      NDE 4212.             Next thing was that I watched the emergency medical technicians try and revive me right after. It took the fire and rescue men almost an hour to extract me from my car. I was hovering overhead! In this time, I felt no pain, no fear at all. I remember actually being over my body in the ambulance as they took me to the hospital! A male emergency medical technician gave me CPR and I remember the tattoo he had on his upper forearm. I could draw it! I don't remember his face or name at all. I 'followed' myself from the ambulance down the hospital corridor with the emergency medical technician still trying to revive me. I was covered with blood! ... I watched as I had a seizure!  
   NDE due to auto accident.   

    2049.        Karl F Probable NDE       12/6/2009.      Probable NDE 4214.             It will be difficult to describe all of what happened to me because it covered a good portion of my life and I will tire from this and explaining this drains me. There was a place of greater light that I wanted to go to, but could not. Two men eventually came in and told me I could not go there unless I came back. There have been books and scriptures that were word for word on these types of experiences. As events unfolded some wanted me to not come back, the two men in white wanted nothing of me but to present me with information to make my own choices.

    2048.        Casper NDE       12/6/2009.      NDE 4210.             Little did I know that shortly after Mich'l died, I would come close to losing my life and having the privilege of experiencing my first near-death experience. During my NDE, I could see my body lying on a stretcher as the ambulance attendants worked feverishly to save my life. Unaware of any time or distance, my spirit floated high into the clouds - until Mich'l and I were reunited in a temple called Beautiful. As we entered the temple, I was breathless and stood admiring the perfectly carved archways, and magnificent pillars. Since Mich'l was still unable to walk, I had to carry him through the temple gates. On the other side of the doorway, were six recliners placed in a circle. Somehow, I knew they were especially handcrafted for people who could not sit up unassisted. After placing my son into one of the chairs, I left the area.  
   NDE due to allergic reaction.   

    2047.        Doug W NDE       12/6/2009.      NDE 4203.             I found myself totally lucid, clear in mind and thought, floating in blackness. It felt as if I was lying on my side, but without feeling any pressure on the side I was lying on. To get a point of reference I looked down at myself, and observed I was all in white. My skin was a translucent white. I was wearing an oversized robe. Thinking of my position it shifted on its own, and now I felt I was upright, and I started to look around. The darkness had depth; it felt like the void went on to infinity. I was comfortable, and realized something had happened during the surgery, and I must had died. I got excited, because I was happy that my passing was painless. I was getting anxious to move on, and was wondering, and talking to myself when someone was coming to get me. I waited, and waited, time seemed to come to a standstill.

    2046.        Oriana R FDE       12/6/2009.      FDE 4202.       From New Zealand      I was driving in a car and it seemed as if I was about to crash into a truck, but something took over the steering wheel, shot me upwards towards a bright light and I was surrounded by some loving beings. As I was going to the light as message was shared with me. 'No matter what you have done and not done you are loved. No matter what you will do and won't do, you are loved. The world is perfect and you are perfect.'

    2045.        David A NDE       12/6/2009.      NDE 4175.             As I dove away from the point of impact, the crash crushed the car where I sat and I was ejected from the vehicle. As I was thrown across the highway and sustained head trauma and other injuries, in my mind I was floating above the accident scene watching the events unfold. The scene was moving in extreme slow motion and most likely took place over less than a minute. But to me it was unfolding over an extended period. I also experienced my life flashing by with numerous scenes and memories of my childhood and vivid memories of loved ones who had died previously as well as current friends and relatives. I also experienced traveling down a tunnel seeing many of my deceased relatives who seemed to be welcoming me.

    2044.        Gail K NDE       12/6/2009.      NDE 4174.             After feeling intense pain and deep fear during strangulation, I became aware of 'floating' through a dark (PITCH BLACK, all-encompassing darkness) area that had no limits or boundaries. I passed other floating beings, who seemed to be just kind of in suspension in the darkness, or stuck, if that describes it better. All at once, I seemed to be floating within an intense, pure, joyous white brightness that felt like all good things, the most joyous love and a complete sense of peace and contentment. I felt how my actions in my life affected persons around me, both positively and negatively. I know I was told that I have to do something here, but I don't remember what it is. I know, however, that I will accomplish whatever it is that I'm supposed to do.  
   NDE due to criminal attack.   

    2043.        Heron S NDE       12/6/2009.      NDE 4173.             Being in Its Presence felt so good, like peace, and like calm, and like home, and like belonging, and like safety and wellness. I could have stayed there forever and my contact with the Being of Light was somehow outside of time, although there was communication that I barely recall now: somehow, with Words that had no Sound, I understood that it wasn't time for me to be there, not yet. There was no sense of rushing my departure - it wasn't within time as I understand that here - but at some point I reverse-flew back through the tunnel with no walls and I guess landed back inside my physical body, where I awoke in the hospital.  
   NDE due to suicide attempt.   

    2042.        Jake NDE       12/6/2009.      NDE 4169.             My mind was a muddle but my heart was true. Again flashing images of everyone I ever knew, then I saw a vivid image of a graveyard, very vibrant dark green grass, I think it was raining, and a large gathering of people dressed in black around an open grave, someone was being buried. I immediately knew it was my grave and I saw all those people feeling so terrible. I thought the pain I had been feeling was too much. But seeing those people, I couldn't bare it, it hurt me more than anything I could ever begin to imagine, all of their pain immediately became mine and all of the calm I had felt fled from me as quickly as it had come and a righteous fury like nothing I've ever known consumed me. I cursed everything, I cursed God himself and I furiously declared 'I won't let this happen! I won't let it!'  
   NDE due to injury from falling.   

    2041.        Edie F NDE       12/6/2009.      NDE 4167.             I am certain that my near-death experience took place at some time following the second birth as this would have been the time of the hemorrhage and drop in blood pressure. The first thing I remember about it was that I seemed to be traveling horizontally along some colored lights that had sounds, with an awareness that each color had its own sound. My awareness of myself did not include my body, but I was fully aware of who I was as I moved along, listening to these lights. I would move along one row until that row ended, then I would move up to the next row with lights of a different color and different sounds and go the other direction until I came to the end of the row again. Then I would move up to another row and go back the other direction.  
   NDE due to complications after delivering twins.   

    2040.        John Z NDE       12/6/2009.      NDE 4163.             I was behind the operating table perhaps ten to twelve feet back and slightly above the doctor's and nurse's heads and I could feel the palpable sense of frustration and failure of the doctor's because my heart had stopped and they could not continue to try and dissolve the clot in my artery. Next thing I felt was a shock convulsion, very powerful, and next I was in an intensive care recovery room.  
   NDE while in surgery for a coronary artery procedure.   

    2039.        Gail R NDE       12/6/2009.      NDE 4162.       From the Philippines.      All I can recall at that moment was that I was lying in an empty space; everything seemed to be dark except the constant flashes of tiny white lights that connected each other. Every flash connects to the next light.  As it goes to the next light, I saw an experience. I know the moment that I am going to die. It's really a strange feeling because we always fear death but when you experience it, there is this feeling of compete surrender, a kind of peace.  I even forgot the people who will be left sad when I am gone.  
   NDE from asthma attack. Shared within two weeks of its occurrence.   

    2038.        Michael B NDE       12/6/2009.      NDE 4161.             I remember watching myself spinning through space. It is at this moment that everything seemed to be black and I could not see anything of the area around where I was. While watching myself spinning or 'flying through space,' I also recall feeling as if I were hurtling through a very tight-fitting tunnel.  It seemed to me that I was approaching what I can only describe as a nerve synapse and fully expected to jump from one side of the synapse to the other but as I approached this synapse I can clearly recall hearing 'not yet' and the next thing I remember is lying on the ground.  
   NDE due to being hit by a bus.   

    2037.        Marta G NDE       12/6/2009.      NDE 4160.             A beautiful woman dressed in bright white light pulled me out and, looking into my eyes, asked me what I wanted. I was completely satisfied and could think of nothing until it occurred to me to take a trip around the lake. I did and saw detail I would ever have seen in 'real' life. I could go anywhere, even to the tops of trees, by simply intending to do so... I was legally blind and for the first time saw leaves on trees, bird's feathers, bird's eyes, details on telephone poles and in people's backyards that were far more acute than 20/20 vision.  
   Exceptional NDE at age five due to drowning. Legally blind, and saw much earthly detail visually for the first time in her life.   

    2036.        Nannci R Possible NDE       12/6/2009.      Possible NDE 4157.       From Australia      The light was amazingly bright but not painful to look at.  The light was not just a light it was the power of love. It washed over me so strongly; it washed away all the pain, tears and sadness I ever experienced so quickly that I was left without a memory of ever experiencing them at that moment and instantly. I was overcome with love, the purity, an innocence and a sense of perfection or holiness simultaneously. To describe the actual merging of this is just not humanly possible, it happened so quickly but yet I could feel the bad wash away and the goodness enter and I knew this was how I was meant to be. This was me in the 'right' state of being; everything negative before was a corruption.  
   Possible NDE associated with sleep apnea.   

    2035.        Diane H NDE       12/6/2009.      NDE 4156.             I was in a near fatal motor vehicle accident and was cut from my car and air lifted to a local hospital. During the helicopter ride, I had a conversation with my deceased mother-in-law and grandmother. I remember being so happy to see them and smiling and feeling euphoric. I wanted to hug and kiss them but my mother-in-law simply said, 'Turn around, it isn't your time yet.' I felt perplexed and feel as though I made a strange face. She followed with, 'Amy can't lose you, so close to losing me. Go back and be with her.' She had such a kind loving look on her face and my grandmother was over her shoulder, smiling and shaking her head yes. Amy is my long-time partner. I remember thinking she is right and they kind of disappeared.  
   NDE due to auto accident.   

    2034.        Mary L NDE       12/6/2009.      NDE 4155.             My vision became blurry and I started to pass out, knocking a cup to the floor. Upon hearing the sound of the cup crashing to the floor, my grandmother rushed in and performed the Heimlich maneuver. I remember passing out briefly, almost as if I were drifting off to sleep. Then I opened my eyes and somehow found myself looking at the scene unfold - as if I were a spectator at my own performance. I saw my grandmother rush in with a horrified look on her face and pick me up off the floor. I saw her attempts to get the candy out of my throat. I didn't feel alarm, just an overall sense of numb curiosity. I remember a feeling that I had - it was almost one of indecision. On one hand, I felt that I could leave the house, and everything I knew behind me. On the other hand I felt that I could somehow go back and that things would be okay.  
   NDE at age five due to choking.   

    2033.        Malina B NDE       12/6/2009.      NDE 4153.             I remember standing up telling my parents I wasn't feeling well and then collapsing to the floor. When I first fell to the floor, I was still conscious. I remember lying there looking at the carpet but my eyes weren't blinking. I remember an echo type noise, my parents shaking me, and my dad calling and talking to a 911 operator. I remember I began to have seizures then I was gone. Everything was very dark but in the center, there was a very bright light. In the center of the light, my niece was dancing around very happily. It was a good feeling and my niece looked very pleased and happy. She looked like she was far away and I remember I felt like I was smiling at how well she was dancing. She was also singing. I felt very emotional and begin to cry.  
   NDE due to diabetes and hypoglycemia.   

    2032.        Tim B Possible NDE       12/6/2009.      Possible NDE 4151.             I recall that it was like a portion of me floated out of my body and was looking down at myself on the bed. But the strange thing is that I was also in the bed, looking up at myself floating over the top of me. It was very strange; I was in two places as the same time observing myself from both vantage points. This lasted maybe a few minutes. There wasn't anything like a shock, or a sensation of being 'pulled' back. It abruptly ended.  
   Possible NDE following gunshot injury at age fourteen with OBE observations later verified.   

    2031.        Debbie Probable NDE       12/6/2009.      Probable NDE 4146.             I was walking around the baby pool. A young boy grabbed me and pushed me under the water. I almost instantly started floating above my body. I saw myself in an aqua one-piece swimsuit lying in the pool floor. I was not scared and remembered wondering how I could be in both places at the same time. I was watching a movie of myself. I was right above my body and began to float higher and higher into the sky. I was not scared, but confused. It was so pretty. I was hovering in a beautiful blue sky and white clouds. It was silent. I was going higher and higher. I began to see my mom jump into the pool and pick me up. Everyone was running to me. The last thing I remember was waking up in my mom's arms in the pool office. It was in slow, slow motion.  
   Probable NDE due to drowning at age four.   

    2030.        Kathleen P Probable NDE       12/6/2009.      Probable NDE 4145.             Next I found myself surrounded by an all-consuming light. It was wonderful, comforting and described as incredibly good. It was a glow as if in the center of a candle flame, that orange yellow glow. I had no sense of body and saw only the light. I felt torn between staying and so wanted to. I heard myself say, 'But he is only nine,' referring to my son. Immediately after that I found myself sitting in my hospital bed there were no machines, no IV's, I felt fine.  
   Probable NDE during complication following surgery.   

    2029.        Robert L NDE       12/6/2009.      NDE 4144.             As I felt the light engulf me (this is where it gets hard to explain) I could feel all the problems, anger, fear and any other negative emotion just lift out of my body. I instantly knew the light was pure goodness and love, like nothing I had ever felt before or since. I noticed some people near me and walked over to them. One was my mother and another was my first wife. There were some others but I'm not able to say for sure whom. My first question was this, 'Is this how it really feels?' It was such a feeling of peace and love I can't describe it. Their answer was 'Yes isn't it wonderful.' 'Yes,' I said. I got to say hello and ask what happens next and they told me I was going back where I had come from but they would be watching over me and we would all be together again.  
   NDE due to episode of unconsciousness.   

  2078.    Mark B Probable NDE     9/11/2023 &amp; 12/31/2009.      Probable NDE vs. ICU Experience 16133/2078.            My previous feelings of fear, confusion, and pain dissipated into feelings of peace, tranquility, and safety like I had never known before. Moreover, despite the absolute silence of this refuge I was able to "hear" the sounds to be heard, yet I could "hear" the many feelings that emanated within my refuge. I became "aware" of the absolute darkness yet was never blinded by it nor did it hinder my vision. There was nothing to see, yet I could "see" like never before. There I remained "alive" and was never lonely as something, someone, somehow instilled me with safety and well-being. 
  Probable NDE and ICU Experience due to car accident.  Was in a coma for 2 months.   
  
  2027.        Kelly P FDE       9/24/2009.      FDE 22157.       From Canada.      The first thing I saw before the ‘incident’ was a larger than normal bright semi-truck trailer coming towards me on its own side of the highway. I will never forget it. Then it started. I felt like I lost control of the car as everything went pitch black. There was an incredible massive intense spinning like I have never experienced. It went on for quite some time. I remember saying repeatedly, 'I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead.' I couldn't do anything, I couldn't see anything, I couldn't feel anything other than a dark blackish grey tunnel which I felt, and, weirdly, saw myself going through at a rapid speed.  It was unbelievable.  
   Fear Death Experience due to near auto accident.   

    2026.        Norman NDE       9/13/2009.      NDE 22146.       From Mexico.      I was riding my bike in the middle of the day in an area that had no trees (it was just planted farmland). There were no clouds I could see one hundred fifty yards full circle all the way around me. I remember helping an old man sit down under a tree in the grass and I was talking to him. We talked for a while, but I don’t remember what we talked about. I looked toward the ambulance and said that I have to help them get that body in the ambulance. I didn't know it was my body.  
   NDE due to being hit by a car.   

    2025.        Paul NDE       11/8/2009.      Shared NDE 22145.             I knew Rick was in heaven and with his words, he sent me back! He might have wanted to be where he was. During the experience, Rick stopped me with a voice that he only used certain times. He said it wasn’t my time. I hovered over my body and saw my teeth or blood on the road.  
   Apparent shared NDE with Rick, who apparently died at the time of the auto crash.   

    2024.        Jewel S NDE/ADC       9/13/2007.      NDE 31688.       From Canada      In 1991 I had a cancer operation for cervical cancer. I got too much gas just before I was put out in the operating room. I saw my dead great grandfather Joe who died at ninety-six he showed up white hair and blue eyes and said in his English accent. 'You're going to be alright,' then was gone. I was put under. During the time I was out, I found myself outside a beautiful white garden gate leading into a beautiful flower garden in golden light. As I looked into the garden, Jim came, took both my hands, and said, 'come on baby you have taken enough.' I said, 'no I can't leave the kids.' Jim looked sad. I awoke twelve hours later. The hospital thought I was brain dead.  
   ADCs from deceased boyfriend, and apparent NDE.   

    2023.        Ricardo FV NDE       12/5/2009.      NDE 4170.       From Spain. Original in Spanish, translated by Simon.      I ascended through a tunnel at the end of which there was a lot of white light. When I got to the end, my deceased father-in-law was waiting for me there, to my surprise. I asked him what I was doing there with him, and he told me not to be afraid, that I had simply died. I answered this by saying it was not possible, since my children needed me, being still very small, so I refused to stay in that place.  
   NDE from a heart attack.   

    2022.        Volf W NDE       12/5/2009.      NDE 4197.       From Sweden. Original in Swedish translated by John S.      I was floating over a billowing cornfield. There was clear, blue sky, white clouds and a strong wind that stirred into the field. At the end of the cornfield, I could see a house painted in red with white window frames and corners. Everything was so beautiful and the colors in the sky, the clouds, the corn and the house were sharp.  The experience was filled with happiness, energy, and made me strong somehow.  
   NDE from a car accident.   

    2021.        Linda B NDE       11/21/2009.      NDE 4132.             As all of these things occurred I also felt and saw a bright light. In the light was my daughter-in-law who had passed two years before. She was waiting for me. She seemed in the light and part of the light. I felt wonderful, happy and moved into the light. I knew I was leaving my husband and family behind but wanted to go into the light. It was happiness a thousand times over. Utopian. Angela was smiling and getting closer.  
   NDE due to surgical complication.   

    2020.        Astrid K NDE       11/21/2009.      NDE 4131.             I 'woke up' or more like suddenly appeared laying on the railroad tracks which were in the dark tunnel (at first it felt very cold) I could see its dimensions, color which was dark gray /black, it had a very strong smell of a fuel that drips from the trains onto the railroad trucks. At first, I didn't realize where I was. Then a sudden fear mixed with warmth enveloped me. I started to scream out my friends' name and being frantic. I didn't know what to do or which direction to go. Then a little light started to appear. It was first very small and then becoming brighter and bigger as it was coming closer to me. For some reason, I wasn't very scared anymore; I somehow became calm and just kept starring at it. Then I woke up surrounded by my friends.  
   NDE due to unconsciousness from childhood game at age thirteen.   

    2019.        Ollie K NDE       11/21/2009.      NDE 4130.             I was about ceiling high and looking down at my body thinking how funny it will be for them to find me on the commode. I was so happy to be out of that horrifically painful body. As I was leaving, my little girl who was five at the time laughed outside of the bathroom window. I stopped ascending and tried to think of someone in my family to raise my children. I don't know how long I took, but it was clear to me there was no one to raise them. I said, 'God, please let me go back I have to raise my children.' I assume I knew he was allowing me to go back. I looked down at my body and I was dreading going back into it. I knew I had to and so I pulled myself back into it.  
   NDE associated with severe fever.   

    2018.        Robert T NDE       11/21/2009.      NDE 4129.       From the UK      I was moving towards a wall of bright lights and in front of me were hundreds of people moving with me. It was the most peaceful place I had ever been and wanted to stay. After I was bought back I had a strong memory of standing across the ward and I was watching the two nurses working on me. I could see what nurses were there, Ganor was straddling me and Mark was at the head of the bed trying to get an oxygen tube in.  
   NDE due to heart stopping; apparently related to blood clot.   

    2017.        Benjamin H NDE       11/21/2009.      NDE 4127.             Then as soon as the darkness came, it went away, and I was in a field of some sort. I was wearing jeans and a red plaid shirt. It was so sunny outside, so it was all bright. Then I saw a man walking toward me, and I felt curious so I walked toward to him as well. When I got close enough to see him clearly, I realized I was looking at my dad. My dad had died two years earlier from a heart attack. He was in his regular T-shirt and blue jeans with his John Deere hat that he always wore. He got about two feet from me. We were so close that I could've touched him if I wanted to. But we just stood still for what felt like forever. He just stared at me, never saying a word.  
   NDE from 'Improvised Explosive Device' explosion in Iraq.   

    2016.        Gina D NDE       11/21/2009.      NDE 4123.             I bled out (twice) after childbirth, flat-lined. I was not conscious to the normal world except for seeing down onto the doctors working on me and being aware, I was up in a corner of the room. I could clearly see and describe the doctors, including bald heads and beards.  
   NDE due to blood loss after delivery.   

    2015.        Ann Y Probable NDE       11/21/2009.      Probable NDE 4122.       From England.      I was on holiday and ended up in hospital with a twisted bowel, which had been left for some considerable time, when they decided to do an emergency operation on me. All I know is that I went through a doorway into a brightly lit room and there was my father, mother and two brothers who had passed away. My father who had been very ill and in a wheelchair for the last seven years of his life and passed away at the age of sixty-two was sitting next to my eldest brother who had passed away aged sixty-six then my mum was next to him. She passed away aged seventy-five. My youngest brother was standing sideways looking at them. (This has always troubled me) He died aged forty-two of cancer. My father stood up smiling and happy and not a trace of illness and he said to me, 'Hello love it's good to see you,' and had his arms held out towards me when my brother looked up and said, 'What are you doing here?' To which I replied 'I've come to join you' 'Oh no,' he said, 'it isn't your time - go back.'  
   Probable NDEs associated with emergency bowel surgery.   

    2014.        Elle NDE       11/21/1009.      NDE 4121.       From Canada.      I began to cry thinking of my family who needed me and how many things I had yet to accomplish such as school, having a family, saying goodbye to loved ones and suddenly my life fast forwarded in front of my eyes and I slowly drifted off. I was now able to see myself laying on the street covered in blood with my belongings scattered around me. I kneeled down beside my body and began to cry, it was far more real this time and I saw two women who had parked there car and ran towards the scene to aid me - but it was too late I was already dead. I looked around and it seemed like another dimension. People who had not been there previously were walking around and doing normal day to day activities.  
   NDE due to being struck by car.   

    2013.        Ira P NDE       9/13/2009.      NDE 22141.       From India.      I stood up real fast and I felt a little dizzy, but I didn’t pay too much attention to it because that’s what happens to everyone. So I was at the basin with my toothbrush in my left hand and the toothpaste in my right hand getting ready to brush my teeth and then everything just went blank. The next thing I remember was standing near the door and looking down at my body on the floor. That sight freaked me out so much. Then I (the one on the floor) remember looking at the fan on the ceiling and wondering, ‘That’s weird. Why am I looking at the fan?’ My eyes were shut the whole time, so there was no way I could have seen that. At that moment I came back to my conscious self and opened my eyes, and I was actually on the floor and looking at the fan!  
   NDE from fainting at age 15.   

    2012.        Frank G NDE/ADC       5/14/2007.      NDE 31670.             Now here's where things get real interesting. The Gates of Heaven! I found myself looking in but could not get in! I started to knock, knock on the gates to Heaven. The sights where out of this world, people playing having a great time. The sight and sounds greater than anything we know musical notes and sounds just greater than works can explain. The visual effect was endless amount of bright colors (using color to try to paint the color). Again, words are too simple! As I became accustomed to the sights and sound, I was delighted I was in the right place, yet the gates would not open!  
   NDE due to motorcycle accident.   

    2011.        Cindy E NDE       11/15/2009.      NDE 4198.             'I'm dying. Born in 1962, died in 1997.' Then, everything got dark. I saw my whole family in front of me, except my beloved nana. I didn't know why she wasn't there. I kept telling my family, 'But, I'm dying.' I saw mom's head, and I was relaxing on the sofa. I kept saying that 'But, I'm dying,' while talking to mom. I wanted her to tell my boss that I wouldn't be coming back to work because, 'But I'm dying,' and to say goodbye to everyone in my family for me. Then, mom was gone, and God came. I couldn't see him. But, I knew he was there. He kept telling me how I was special and that I shouldn't think so lowly about myself. I felt this being infused in me and I felt very loved.  
   NDE due to criminal attack.   

    2010.        Shirley R Probable NDE       11/15/2009.      Probable NDE 4194.             I was a silhouette of dark grey with light grey surrounding the whole area, except for the bright light that seemed to be heading up. The light being was not of earth light.  There was no need for the moon or stars. The best way I can describe the light is it was like the look of a full moon brightness.  
   Surgery-related Probable NDE.   

    2009.        Tommy S NDE       11/15/2009.      NDE 4187.             I was soaking wet with sweat and the electricity went in my arm and stomach and would not let me go. I couldn't yell or anything to get away and I could not breathe, so basically I suffocated to death and my heart stopped. Suddenly I remembered I had done everything I could now it was in the Lord's hands, so I started praying for God to help me. I saw this tunnel of white light drawing closer and closer and I was not afraid or in pain anymore, all I felt was peace.  
   NDE due to electrocution.   

    2008.        Debbie P NDE       11/24/2013 & 11/15/2009.      NDE 7001/4186.             I remember seeing my body under the water.  I had a blue swimsuit on and saw bubbles coming out of my nose and mouth.  I was just watching from above, but close.  I was not scared.  I was calm and thinking to myself, 'why am I under water and why is that boy holding my hand?'  I started floating higher away and then saw my mom run into the water and grab the boy.  It was beautiful, and the colors were very pretty and clear.  I remember zapping instantly into my body violently fast.  
   NDE due to drowning at age 4.   

    2007.        Herb B NDE       11/15/2009.      NDE 4184.             This is about the time I realized I didn't have a body shape anymore. I knew something had changed, but I just accepted it. I noticed I was starting to slowly levitate. I also felt an incredible sense of peace and well-being coming from behind me. I had a pulling feeling and I was turned 180 degrees toward the left side of the ambulance. The pulling was like a gradual magnet effect.  I could see a square opening higher in the ambulance side. It was then that the pulling took control of me. I could see something flowing out of the square opening. I can best describe it as many small headlights beaming slightly through a thick white fog. I was pulled towards the opening and the white illuminated fog, which flowed like a stream.  
   NDE due to motorcycle accident.   

    2006.        K.C. NDE       11/15/2009.      NDE 4112.       From the UK.      Then I heard a voice in my head saying, 'If you don't get up, you're going to die here. You have to get up!' I was thinking that I don't want to die here. On my own, I got up somehow and stumbled down the street. I remember walking a while. The next thing I recall was looking down at someone huddled in a corner of a messy room. I couldn't see the face of the person. I felt calm, no pain. I said or thought, 'Who is that?' A hazy grayish greenish light lit up this corner. It was me!  
   NDE from being hit in the head and going unconscious.   

    2005.        Maria G NDE       11/14/2009.      NDE 4148.       From Mexico. Original in Spanish, translated by Simon.      Then suddenly I saw a light in the distance, like someone seeing a bright star, and this is when I knew that I had to go towards that light while at the same time a wonderful peace invaded my being, a tranquility never before experienced, and great, great joy at going towards the light. Arriving there, the light was shining in great splendor.  As I entered into the light, I heard someone calling my name.  The voice was full of tenderness saying, 'It is not your time.  You have two children who need you. You must go back.'  
   Childbirth NDE.   

    2004.        Robert T Possible NDE       11/14/2009.      Possible NDE 4182.       From Canada. Original in French, translated by Kathy.      During this trip I remember that I didn't want to die because I was caring for my seventy-seven year old mother who was very sick at home. I didn't want to leave her alone and I especially didn't want to cause her sorrow. To get back to my journey, when I objected to the idea of dying the voice of God, which I recognized, intervened saying to the being who was in such a rush to deliver me to the Creator, God told him, 'Hey, don't you see that he's not ready to die. Bring him back to his body.'  
   Possible NDE or NDE-Like, hard to tell.   

    2003.        Julie D NDE       11/14/2009.      NDE 4180.       From the UK.      I remember standing next to a male being who wore a grey cloak with a hood. He stood to my left. I felt my whole life up until that moment. I was engulfed with overwhelming sadness because my life had been empty. I didn't want to cry. I got the feeling or thought I had to resume living because I hadn't done or learned what I had come here for. At no time during this experience was I aware of my earthly body.  
   NDE due to strangulation.   

    2002.        Corbin NDE       11/14/2009.      NDE 4179.             Then all at once a feeling of comfort overwhelmed me and I thought, 'It's over at last.' Then I was home and all around me was pure white light and total love and caring and a comfort I've never known nor will I forget. I couldn't see anyone but knew I was not alone and had nothing to fear. All the time, there was this overpowering feeling that I had made it home at last.  After a life-long wait, everything was perfect and my life was now complete.  
   NDE due to intestinal bleed.   

    2001.        Greta P NDE       11/14/2009.      NDE 4177.             Then I heard a voice - rich, loving, deep and rather like an radio announcer of that era (they couldn't get jobs on the air unless they had wonderful voices). This voice started telling me that I needed to get out of the water. 'But I can't,' I retorted. 'But, you must get out of the water.' 'I've tried and tried, but nothing works.' Sometime in my conversation with 'the voice' my soul floated up out of my body and was about one foot above, looking down on my body, but at the same time, I was also in my body, experiencing it. The voice continued to coach me in a very loving manner. 'You must fight to get out of the water.' 'Yes, I know, but nothing works. And besides, I'm so relaxed...' 'If you don't get out of that water - you're going to die.' 'I know,' I said. 'Do you want to die?' 'No, but I'm so relaxed.'  
   NDE due to head injury followed by drowning at age ten. Remarkable in that NDE contained information to save herself from drowning. Shared fifty-three years later.   

    2000.        Shawna F NDE       11/14/2009.      Shared NDE 4176.             My thoughts were all related to how I was feeling. I did know or I did think that I had died. I felt that it was wonderful; it was a feeling of such unexplainable joy. The notion of being dead was just a matter of fact. It was like - okay, I have died and this is AWESOME. My kid is here, I feel incredible!!! But, soon after I began to think that way, I started to fly again and I started to move away from my son. It was as if I was dangling a few feet in the air over him now, instead of beside him.  
   Shared NDE due to car accident.   

    1999.        Cindy Q Friend NDE       11/14/2009.      Secondhand NDE 4094.             As a child there was a neighborhood boy named Raymond that was slightly retarded, nobody wanted to play with him. I always let him play with us and scolded the other kids if they were mean to him. One day after one of the kids said something mean, he said, 'I'm like this because I died.' Of course, I asked him what he meant. He said, 'I have something in my brain, they did an operation and I died on the table. I saw the doctors; they said bad words and everyone was running around. I told them what they said when I was dead and then they believed me that I died and came back. There was a white light and everything was so beautiful. I'm not afraid to die anymore.'  
   Cindy had an OBE.  She tells of her friend who had an NDE.   

    1998.        Bobbie M NDE       11/8/2009.      NDE 4181.       From France. Translated by Kathy.      Briefly: once asleep on the operating table I remember a very bright light dazzling me. Never, at any time, was I afraid of what was happening!! I was drawn to the light so I moved forward, but I wasn't walking I was floating!! Once at the end of this light I found myself in a huge field with flowers and birds everywhere and a little stream with a bridge over it where a man in a long white robe was sitting. He smiled at me.  
   Surgery-related NDE at age ten.   

    1997.        Ian R NDE       9/7/2009.      NDE 22096.       From the UK.      Literally as soon as the massage started everything would go black. Then a small white light would appear, gradually getting larger and I'd get a falling sensation as if in a tunnel. Then I would see the physician’s hands massaging my neck, which would suddenly zoom down the tunnel towards the light. What was strange is I did not follow.  The doctor’s arms would stretch into infinity and I'd become aware that I was floating. Slowly rising upwards until the entire cubicle was visible to me from above. My first experience I watched the doctor massaging my neck, and I watched my Mother crying and I watched a Nurse enter the cubicle and give my Mother a paper tissue to dry her tears. This abruptly stopped and it felt as if I had been suddenly sucked back into my body.  
   NDE from neck massage as a child.   

    1996.        Paul M NDE       5/13/2006.      NDE 31638.             I was outside the ambulance seeing what route it was taking. When I was revived I told the paramedic what route we took and I was right even though I was clinically dead.  
   NDE at age 7 associated with fire in house.   

    1995.        Pamela D Possible NDE       10/28/2009.      Possible NDE 4118.             She said that I was pronounced dead at an Emergency Room, and the doctors brought me back. All I remember is through a persistent dream I have of being in a dark place but not being afraid. There was a radiating warmth engulfing me. I seem to remember it FELT like a white or gold light. I don't recall seeing this light, just feeling it. It also felt like love I have never known. The radiating 'light' was telling me things telepathically. No words transpired until I asked a presence I felt there with me, 'Am I going now?' The presence answered, 'No, it's not your time yet.'  
   Possible NDE revealed through subsequent dreams from a possible criminal attack.   

    1994.        William T NDE-Like       5/23/2011.      NDE-Like 16043.             Colors were intensely vibrant.  I found myself in an intimate perceptual relationship with everything. I had become a void at the center of my universe. The center of a network of spatial relationships. The experience was complemented by an out-of-body, third person perspective from ten feet above my head.  The third person perspective was in addition to my eye level perspective and lasted about three days.  The color intensity, the knowledge where everything was, the intense focus on the here-and-now persisted for months.    

    1993.        Veronica W NDE       12/6/2009.      NDE 4158.             There was one major being of love and many other beings of love with actual personhood or souls.  I could not see much but light and vague outlines in a way.  There was nothing but love, goodness, truth, and all things to do with love. There was no room for fear or evil or anything but this love.  It was more wonderful than any of my best hopes or experiences on this planet.  It was beyond perfect and loving as we in our human state know it.  There are no words to describe it.  I was so happy to be there.  
   Exceptional NDE due to anaphylactic allergic reaction.  A must read.   

    1992.        Clint G NDE       10/11/2009.      NDE 4143.       From Canada.      When I was thirteen, I was shot in my right thigh with a rifle, the bullet broke my femoral artery vein in my leg. At the time I was shot, I had what seemed like a flash of my life, and all past experiences. Although I do not remember a single thing from this experience, I do know that it happened, the best way that I explained it over the years was like a giant picture of thousands of tiny pictures that flashed in my mind.  
   NDE due to being accidentally shot at age thirteen.   

    1991.        Stacy M NDE       10/11/2009.      NDE 4142.             I know that I SAW darkness. I know I felt like I was lying on the ground and looking up into darkness. There was a form that felt loving, a female who was looking over my body. (I just started to tear up feeling this story again.) 'She' was hovering it felt above me. She had an outline and it felt like her long wavy blond hair hung down too. Next I felt being in the ambulance.  
   NDE due to seizure at age fifteen.   

    1990.        Larry W FDE       10/11/2009.      FDE 4141.             I was transported into the sky. I looked down on the action taking place, seeing myself carrying the wounded Marine, watching dirt exploding as rounds hit all around me. I had a panoramic view of the whole hillside, could see our dug-in positions and even the faces of my fellow Marines. All sounds of battle stopped, though muzzle flashes and explosions were clearly visible. All smells of battle were gone. I heard a gentle wind blowing, as I seemed to float about the battlefield. I felt a presence behind my back, which seemed to be supporting me and seemed also to radiate a light over me. I was flying, or hovering superman style.  
   Fear death experience during Vietnam combat.  These types of experiences are in the spectrum of experiences that includes NDE.   

    1989.        Michael K NDE       10/11/2009.      NDE 4140.             During the operation, for some reason, I did not know there was a problem, as I was under anesthesia, all I know I was above my body watching hem working on me doing CPR and trying all kinds of things. I remember watching them and thinking, 'What are they doing?' I hovered in the corner of the operating room watching what was going on. Then, I left the operating room and was floating off towards a light. It was the most peaceful light, there was no fear, no pain, just happiness and peace. I was happy to be there. I saw people closer towards the light, which I believe, were my grandmother and great-grandmother; I was heading towards them and happy to be there.  Then for no reason I was transported back.  
   NDE due to cardiac arrest while in surgery. Witnessed his own resuscitation.   

    1988.        Rene A NDE       10/11/2009.      NDE 4139.             Next, I was going away, into a mild to cool light. As I 'lifted', my body faded away, and I was just aware of something or someone informing me I wasn't there anymore. I was with a new experience that felt right. I felt a happiness and wanted to cry with joy, but couldn't. Then an endless reel of life peeled within my conscientiousness. I was being shown I was living a lie. I felt bad, and sad about it. I was told it was all right. My guide was someone called Salle or something like it. Then I was shown the cosmos of all reality. My soul sang out, 'I knew it' - this is where we live. I saw amazing energies and realities of all things. I wept as only a soul could weep. I was profoundly at peace, and filled with hope. I remember asking like a little kid, can I stay here?  
   NDE during general surgery.   

    1987.        Gerry M NDE       10/11/2009.      NDE 4049.             The only part that had 'normal' color was the area behind the 'tear' in space, or time, or whatever it was that that was behind the person I was speaking with. This tear opened up as I began to go towards this person. I could hear children laughing, playing and it looked like what a nice park here on earth looks like - nice green grass cut short, trees, blue sky and clouds. Everything else was basically different shades of the color you see when you close your eyes outside in daylight.  
   Fell off roof of garage at age seven.   

    1986.        Bart A NDE       10/11/2009.      NDE 4045.       From the UK      The experience was truly fantastic, but unfortunately very hard to describe. There was an overwhelming feeling of joy and peace. Time as we know it didn't seem to exist. I felt like I was taken on an emotional journey of the joy of my childhood.  
   NDE from liver failure.   

    1985.        Tony P NDE       10/4/2009.      NDE 4117.       Original in Italian, translated to French by Philippe and translated to English by Kathy.      Having counted four hundred and fifty branches and tunnels, I found myself outdoors in a forest of vibrant colors, of fluorescent green, with a colossal tree in the center. In staring at it and its thin blanket of snow, I felt every one of my cells invaded by an energy and a sense of security I'd never felt before. A very deep voice penetrated me and made my entire being vibrate. 'It isn't time.' Everything moved in synchronicity with my steps. At this point, my entire life passed before me, but only the wayward moments and I was tormented by it. I begged for help with all my heart and all my strength.  
   NDE from a brain aneurism.   

    1984.        Oklahoma NDE       9/27/2009.      NDE 4113.             I was aware of sudden and intense pain and for some reason I knew I was dying. In my mind, I was screaming for God's help, telling Him I was dying. I felt like I was expanding, like I was filling up with air. I was floating, flying, racing upward. I became nothing but consciousness, if that makes sense. I didn't hurt any more. Now I am surrounded by a field of blue. It was a luminescent blue like no other blue I have ever seen before or since. On the periphery was a golden glow - I couldn't look right at the gold area, it was just there on the edge of my field of vision. I'm thinking how beautiful this is. I don't really care for the color blue, but this is HEAVENLY. Oh my God, this is Heaven.  
   NDE from car accident.   

    1983.        Scott Y NDE       5/7/2011 & 5/7/2009.      NDE 5179/4111.             All of a sudden, all of the pain and agony ended.  I saw my physical body on the bottom of the lake.  My face showed a lot of pain and distress.  My spiritual body felt no pain, but only relief and peace.  I felt free and liberated. I turned around and saw a long see-through tunnel. At the end of the tunnel was a very intense and bright light. I seemed to be physically drawn to the light, almost as if it was sucking me towards it. The light radiated love and peace. I wanted to experience it and be in its presence.  
   NDE as a teenager from a drowning incident.   

    1982.        Elisa R NDE       9/27/2009.      NDE 4109.             One thing I remember is that when I drifted in the light with God there was a point in time that I was begging him to take me with him, I told him that I did not want to go back and it was safe with him. He asked me, 'Are you finished?' I thought about it and realized that I was not finished and if I came home with the Lord I would have unfinished business and my tasks would be incomplete. I was given a choice to stay or go and I chose to come back and finish. He reminded me of my home and the reality that really exists and the beauty behind all of it is so indescribable and amazing. Till this day, pretty much every day, I crave my home - because Heaven truly is my home - this earth is very temporary and time is simply an illusion to further understand being human.  
   NDE from an auto accident.   

    1981.        Jane LB NDE       9/27/2009.      NDE 4107.             I went to the light and it felt good. I could not go all the way because of my seven children, the youngest of whom was only seven. I had to fight it. I would not be afraid of passing through it again now though because I know things will be fine. As I was returning, I saw from above that there was a lumberjack, or at least a man who looked like one, standing near my body (a handsome blond man with long hair who was wearing plaid shirt, jeans and a smile). He was talking to me and his words sounded beautiful but I could not understand him.  
   NDE from a bike accident.   

    1980.        Attila D FDE       9/27/2009.      FDE 4106.             At the point of impact, all I remember after that was a big flash like those old cameras they used many years ago were they put the material over their heads and they made a bit of smoke. It was a very big white flash. Then all I saw (which was in black and white) was like an old film reel flicking through my whole life very fast with little flashes. I saw my whole childhood from being in my mum's stomach, my parents holding me, who I had met in my family, my brothers, sisters, grandparents, etc. It was very bizarre to me.  
   Life review caused by a fear death experience.   

    1979.        Forbes G NDE       9/27/2009.      NDE 4105.             Suddenly the pain was gone, the siren was gone, and the bumpy ride was gone.  I was in a place that I am unable to describe. I was in a place of calm, warm, quiet, pleasant place and the most wonderful feeling of peace, love, and contentment. I was reveling in it, lost in it, and suddenly I heard a voice in the back of my head say, 'Open your eyes.' I was in this wonderful place, and this voice had the gall to try to interrupt me.  
   NDE from a tire accident.   

    1978.        Jennifer T NDE       9/27/2009.      NDE 4102.             I am looking at myself lying in a hospital bed. I am feeling strange, almost dreamlike, but in awe of seeing myself. Something takes hold of my left hand and I turn around, to my right. I am looking at this Being of Light and feel calm and at peace. The Being of Light takes hold of my right hand and releases my left while communicating with me that everything will be all right. The communication is not with spoken words but I just know this. I see a small light, which seems so far away. During this time, I am feeling that this Being of Light is both male and female. I describe it as being calming and protective like a woman yet strong like a male.  
   NDE from closed-head injury.   

    1977.        Jerry S NDE       9/12/2009.      NDE 22125.             I started to cross the street and the next thing I know I feel like I’ve woken up. I was looking down at people who were looking down at me laying on the street. I was all but dead.  
   Child NDE as a pedestrian.   

    1976.        Rick E NDE       9/9/2009.      NDE 22100.             At the age of five, my father had to slam on the brakes. I hit my head on the gear shifter of the car. The next thing I knew, I was floating about thirty feet above the car. After that, my mother was shaking me to wake up. I had a big bruise on my forehead for days afterward. I thought it was a dream until I started learning about astral projection.  
   Child went unconscious when head hit.   

    1974.        Alicia C FDE       5/30/2009.      FDE 22083.             When he took the curve he lost control and the car started to spin. It never rolled or crashed into anything, luckily. We ended up on the other side of the road in the ditch facing the other way. During the whole time as soon as the car started to spin. I somehow ended up outside the car about one hundred feet away on the side of the road. I could see the car, I could see us in the car, I could make out all the colors, and I saw all the cars coming on the road along with the headlights. I could see the car spinning. As soon as the car stopped in the ditch I was back in the car.  
   Fear death experience from a near car crash.   

    1973.        Betty SOBE       5/16/2009.      SOBE 22079.             I was twelve and I was playing with my friends outside. One friend was pulling another and myself in a wagon. Another friend was running side by side chasing the wagon down a sidewalk. I tripped and started to fall. The second I hit the ground I saw myself from about one hundred and fifty feet in the air. I could see everything looking straight down. The tops of the trees, the top of my house, myself and my friend running. It was all in a freeze frame. It felt like I was looking down on everything for about five to seven solid seconds. It was like looking at a photo. There was no fear of being high in the sky, just a freeze frame as if time stopped. I could still feel it was a good period of five to seven seconds that I was looking down.  
   This one is either a type of fear death experience or a spontaneous OBE, or something in between the spectrum of consciousness.   

    1972.        Linda Go NDE       5/16/2009.      Linda G NDE 22066.       From Australia.      I was suddenly conscious of looking down at myself. I seemed to be in the corner of the ceiling.  I remember thinking I don't look very well and then realization that I was dying.  I wasn't scared, just pissed off that I was not going to see my daughter grow up.  
   Surgery-related NDE.   

    1971.        Florenti NDE       9/2/2009.      NDE 4056.       From France. Original in French, translated by Jean Peter.      I saw my body was lying behind me.  Next, I was in total darkness and in a tunnel. I started to float forward but did not touch the ground.  I moved faster and faster, almost lying on my belly until I reached a fantastic acceleration, similar to a rocket.  I reached the light that was at the end of this long tunnel. I moved through forms, or I averted them. I passed by sorts of rectangles, triangles (I don't exactly know what it was). I was not scared.  In fact, I was very peaceful.  
   NDE as a child from a dog attack.   

    1970.        Peter NDE       8/30/2009.      NDE 4098.             I saw my life appear above me as if on a big screen and my focus was drawn into it. I was surprised that I did not view it through my eyes, but rather from a 'fly on the wall' perspective. When it came to the moment I was presently in, the view pulled back and I was looking at my face from beside the bed where I lay. I said to myself 'Wow, I'm dead. I guess the first law of thermodynamics is true'.  At this point, I was standing waist deep in the ocean facing the beach. I was engulfed in a great wave of compassion for the human race. I felt a oneness with everyone. The illusion of being alone in the world fell away and I felt a great calming peace that I haven't felt since.  
   NDE due to pulmonary embolism   

    1969.        Guy B NDE       8/30/2009.      NDE 4097.             It was all black and white and grey and blurry. I was in what seemed to be a school hallway with just people moving every which way like a crowded subway station in front of me. To the left was an archway that was the bright part of the scene. To the right and behind me I could feel the darkness. I remember hearing two real loud buzzing sounds like an alarm. I remember thinking to myself there was something I was doing that was important and I shouldn't be sleeping. I opened my eyes to see a bunch of doctors all around and telling them I was sorry and I was trying to stay awake. That is when the doctor told me I died and they had to shock me twice.  
   NDE from heart attack, atypical imagery.   

    1968.        Kathy R Possible NDE       8/30/2009.      Possible NDE 4095.       From the UK.      Exit - the bathroom and my head down the toilet and I remember I couldn't breathe. Next thing, I was travelling into a beautifully light and incredibly colorful 'tube' at rapid speed. The speed was indescribable and I 'erupted' out of the other end to have this incredible 'being' right in front of me. The feeling was amazing and a 'communication' began between us - I do not remember what was said, but it was not 'speech' as we know it on earth. I know it seemed in my soul that it was about 'me' and what I had done so far. The being was surrounded by a brilliant blue and white light that I had never seen before or since. I then realized - that I was 'mind'. I could 'see' and I felt like a child - wonderful place to be.  
   Possible NDE. This is one of those close calls from a drug overdose or possible allergic reaction.   

    1967.        Raina J NDE       8/30/2009.      NDE 4092.             At first, the man in front of me is approximately thirty feet away from me. He appears to be flooded with white light in a white suit, bald, with extremely white teeth. He floats me out of formation, then in front of him. He is not in a white suit, but he is 'glowing'. Inner light is flowing out all round him. He has extremely blue eyes. I am so happy to see him! I know him and he knows me. I cannot recollect who he is now. I hug him and tell him I miss him. He tells me it is not my time.  
   NDE from auto accident, reincarnation imagery.   

    1966.        Blester PW NDE       8/30/2009.      NDE 4091.       From Scotland.      I felt like my body was missing and I was in a void space. The space seemed to have no limits and these were strange sounds like violins but more like voices. It was very loud. I felt very at ease, happy and not worried about how I was in this situation. I just felt like I was supposed to be here. Very quickly, I began to hear voices but I could actually hear them in my head but the sound was all around. I could also see what looked like an old woman wearing some sort of thick gloves, like rubber gloves. I thought she wanted to talk to me but she kept watching me. I recognized her but I don't know who she is at all. The musical sounds were coming from her and it was getting louder and louder. Suddenly I was seeing many strange crystal and glass objects. They had colors I'd never seen before.  
   NDE, went unconscious when she bent over to get her purse.   

    1965.        Lynne S NDE       8/29/2009.      NDE 4087.             I felt wonderful, no pain, no worries. I noted that the tops of the walls faded into blackness and I could see the stars above. I noticed a large window below me, and somehow received the thought that I could go home for a minute if I wished. My marriage was not very good at the time, and I decided not to visit my home before leaving. Suddenly, I was lying with my head and shoulders slightly elevated, in some kind of ethereal tunnel, moving slowly toward a light. There were two beings in front of the light. I knew that soon I would begin to move very fast toward the light. I was ready to go.  
   NDE due to childbirth complications.   

    1964.     See #1473. 

Michael A NDE </a>      8/29/2009.      NDE 4083.             I was floating in a nonphysical form toward a blue/purple gas planet. I felt so much love and understanding words cannot express. My second image, and it was one of the most realistic feeling, I was there in physical form riding on the front of an old sailing ship. I could smell food cooking and I felt the presence of something telling me I need to 'Go back and learn to LOVE the right way.'  
   NDE from accident and head injury.   

    1962.        Jason NDE       8/29/2009.      NDE 4082.             I was not drawn to a light or a life review or even a tunnel of light. I do remember seeing what seemed to be angels of some sort or clerics in white robes leaning over me where I lay. I saw what looked like a field and a piece of the track I was lying on in the physical realm. I do believe that what they gave me was a book and on the cover of this book it said 'Book of Prophecies' and ever since that day I have been more aware of things changing that should not have changed or have the need to change.  
   NDE from bicycle accident - but not the usual imagery.   

    1961.        Victor B NDE       8/29/2009.      NDE 4081.             I dimmed into light, aware that I was floating among the branches and leaves of the oak trees above me. Everything was quiet; I could hear and feel the wind rustling through the leaves. It seemed totally natural that I should be free of my body in this state. I had no desire to look upon myself crumpled within the wreckage of my bicycle. I do remember feeling sorry for that poor little boy and the injuries he sustained. This felt like my real place in the cosmos and I was ready to go forth, even if it meant never seeing my family again. Then I heard something coming from above me. 'Angels!' I screamed with delight. The heavenly chorus was so sweet and loving that to this day, whenever I hear a choir hitting just the right notes, I well up with tears remembering that sweet emotional moment of unbridled joy when I realized I must be dead and the angels were coming for me.  
   NDE from bicycle accident.   

    1960.        Elizabeth NDE       8/22/2009.      NDE 4068.       From Puerto Rico. Original in Spanish, translated to English by Simon A.      I'm told that I fainted. I felt I was looking in front of me, and all I could see was a silhouette standing before me. It was the most attractive presence; I felt it was the most beautiful man I had seen in my life. He seemed to be naked, but I could only see the silhouette standing there in front of me as if he did not want me to go in that direction. Because the bright light was behind him, I couldn't see his face; the light was shining from behind him towards me as if to light him up.  
   NDE from drug overdose.   

    1959.        Stu B NDE       4/17/2011 & 8/22/2009.      NDE 5145/4075.             I clearly remember the wonderful bliss as I moved in a vortex toward a very bright light and looked down from above the water and saw myself laying spread on the floor of the pool as I turned around and went back to the color blobs and through the tunnel toward the beautiful light. I believe that after a while there was an abrupt feeling of being sucked back.  
   Child Drowning NDE.   

    1958.        Eric D Probable NDE       8/22/2009.      Probable NDE 4042.             The most vivid part of the experience was at one point I could see my mother holding me in her arms. She looked very sad, yet accepting. It appeared she was on the verge of crying but she wasn't because she knew I was going on to a better place. Slowly, I began to sink down away from her and I could see geometric shapes below me against a black background. They were a silver-blue in color of various rectangular sizes. I said farewell to my family and friends one by one.  
   Probable NDE from bicycle accident.   

    1957.        Leonard NDE       8/15/2009.      NDE 4046.       From Canada. Original in French, translated to English by Jean Peter.      God then showed me all my life from birth till NDE. I felt and experienced again all these events and I also felt emotions I had raised in others. I was my only judge! This experience was very painful. I dare not imagine what Adolf Hitler underwent when feeling the pain of millions of individuals. God showed me when I had generously done things without thinking about it beforehand, and when I had done unloving things. I even saw myself stealing sweets in a shop, thinking to myself, 'Whew, nobody saw me!' Indeed, somebody saw me. Yes, God saw me! But he does not judge me. In fact this is what hit me the most: God does not judge, he just loves us with unconditional love, this love is indescribable, it is not like what we feel on earth, this is rather a force-of-love.  
   Exceptional NDE from a heart attack.   

    1956.        Bonnie M NDE       8/15/2009.      NDE 4072.             Then a mist of light in the middle of where I was going. All at once, I was in front of these beings of light, they were much taller than I was and I can't say that I saw faces or arms just outlines sort of. Between us was a table like from the 'Flintstones' cartoon in that it looked to be out of a flat stone with stone stools holding it up from underneath. I was directed to come closer, not by hearing sounds but by more of a feeling direction on coming closer.  
   NDE from a bowel rupture.   

    1955.        Renato B Probable NDE       8/15/2009.      Probable NDE 4071.       From the Philippines. Translated from Tagalog to English by John.      I went inside a cave and I saw my ancestors, several of them, they were all seated on the floor. The cave was black, and my ancestors wore full-length white clothing.  They did not speak and stared at me.  
   Short NDE from stroke and blood loss.   

    1954.        Stacy R NDE       8/15/2009.      NDE 4070.             I distinctly remember myself (my body) hovering above the scene that was taking place below. My vision was in black and white and there was no bright light or light at the end of the tunnel. I could draw you a picture of exactly where I was lying right now to this day without question. The emergency medical technician did not extract the nickel - but my mom had now arrived and before the emergency medical technician could perform the tracheotomy needed, my mom pounded on my back like a mad woman and the coin came flying out.  
   NDE when she was five years old.   

    1953.        Michael B NDE       8/15/2009.      Shared NDE 4069.             I remember then walking with my mother in beautiful light towards a source of Great goodness and Love, just as we were about to be bathed in the Light my mother knelt and hugged me, she told me she Loved me, that it was not my time yet. She then crossed into the Light.  
   Shared NDE with a five year old child and his mother.   

    1952.        Ki R Possible NDE       8/15/2009.      Possible NDE 4066.             I looked ahead and there was a vast almost panoramic line of light stretched across space I could see blackness above it and blackness below. As I got closer to this light, which looked like the sun shining through a thick opaque type of glass, it was very comforting and not painful to look at like the sun. As I got further is when I had the overwhelming sense of my body absorbing all of this light, it engulfed me, it washed me, it filled me up with such love I cannot explain there is no word stronger than love here on earth to describe it. I know now that this was God. As I got closer I could see silhouette shapes of people all lined up along the vastness of this light and that was it.  
   She didn't die, but all the classic NDE elements are there.   

    1951.        John P Possible NDE       8/15/2009.      Possible NDE 4065.             While drifting in the darkness and bitter cold (wanting my mother), I felt a warmth coming from behind me, Although I saw no body, I somehow turned and saw a fuzzy light, which seem to be giving off the warmth, to what was now my front. (My back was still bitter cold.) I started (somehow) moving towards the light. The closer I got to the light the warmer I got, the warmer I got the more I knew. I started recalling what I thought were embarrassing moments in my life, only to understand why they happened. The closer to the light the less I wanted to return home. It got to a point I understood everything and forgot about my previous life.  
   NDE from a possible heart attack.   

    1950.        Lisa Possible NDE       8/15/2009.      Possible NDE 4061.             I was looking down at my body and aware of a presence sort of to my right and behind me. I realized (not really visual, but could somehow see him?) that Jesus was there. It surprised me, as I was agnostic. We began a communication/transmission. As if we didn't speak, yet I could hear his voice somehow.  
   Possible NDE from pneumonia and anorexia.   

    1949.        Phillip O NDE       8/11/2009.      NDE 4058.             I heard a mighty rushing wind to my right. I saw an angel flying toward me. As he flew by, there were other angels covered with light following him. The first angel I saw I could see him from head to toe he was very large, he had big fat cheeks, he had muscles on top of muscles, he was clothed in white, and he had huge large white wings. He flew by several times with the angels that were covered with light. All I could see of them were their wings barely sticking out of the light. The fear had left me, I felt pure energy going through me and peace and love. The angel that led the others stopped as I gazed upon him. I was in awe.  
   NDE from bleeding out in the hospital. Experience filled with Christian imagery.   

    1948.        Geralyn AS NDE       8/11/2009.      NDE 4053.             During this, I began rising, and all at once it seemed as though I knew everything there was to know. It seemed as if all the mysteries of the world were being revealed. I understood science, math, and life! Simultaneously, I could see people below me in other rooms, I saw my grandmother and great-aunt crying outside the operating area, I saw other patients being treated in other surgery rooms, I saw people outside the hospital. I saw so much and I continued to rise.  
   Two NDEs. One from cancer surgery and one from drug overdose. The first experience was pleasant, the second hellish.   

    1947.        David J NDE       8/10/2009.      NDE 4050.             I find myself with no sensation in a black void, and someone calls out to me. And how did I know it was to me? I don't know, but I knew it was to me. He said, 'Are you back, already?' That was when I saw the light. It was a bright, round, blue white some distance away. It felt right, to me, that he was there, in the light. I wanted to see whom it was that had called out to me, and it seemed because I wanted to see who was there, the light started to look closer. I have no idea if I moved to the light or the light moved toward me, all I know is the light got larger until I was in it.  
   NDE from electrocution.   

    1946.        Pattie T NDE       8/10/2009.      NDE 4047.             I remember looking both ways then starting to cross. I still don't know if it was just a dream but it didn't feel like it, it felt like I was there, it was so real. All of a sudden, I'm in this beautiful place, such a beautiful landscape, the colors were so vivid. It was full of trees, flowers, and the smell from the flowers. I saw people walking in this garden and a white building in the middle of this wonderful place. I started walking towards the people and the building when I saw this one man. He seemed so full of love and tenderness.  
   NDE from bicycle accident   

    1945.        Charis M NDE       8/9/2009.      NDE 4040.             But at some point during this time I remember (this is the only thing I remember clearly) floating in my hospital room looking down from above at my body in the hospital bed. It's as if I was lying on top of my unconscious body - head to head, toe to toe, just not touching it and floating in the air. I didn't know if my body was dead or unconscious. There was nobody else in the room and I clearly remember saying, 'Wow. I'm really dead,' but no real words would come out, it was just thoughts. I seriously thought it was all over.  
   NDE from suicide attempt.   

    1944.        Pam F NDE       8/9/2009.      NDE 4035.             While all of this was happening, I mostly remember being a spectator, only not above it all, but from table level. I remember bright, bright lights, lots of arms and hands moving quickly over me and mostly faces but not whole faces. Just faces from the nose up and worried looking eyes and expressions. I don't remember any noise, just complete silence. After a while, I remember pulling out the oxygen tube and screaming, 'AIR!!' The next thing I remember was waking up in my room feeling completely exhausted and drained.  
   NDE during surgery.   

    1943.        Lorie NDE       8/9/2009.      NDE 4033.       From Australia.      I was violently shaking from shock, losing blood, and medication to stop the bleeding. I started to drift into a sleep and awoke in a different place. I was still lying on the bed but everything was white, there seemed to be no walls or roof, just endless white. There were two ladies on either side of me and one man at the foot of my bed. They were all dressed in white. The man was of Asian origin and his hair was plaited and so was his beard. He was chanting something at me. As if he was telling me I had a choice to make and counting down to the time left. Live or die. When I first entered this stage, I felt at peace and warm and didn't want to go back.  
   NDE from blood loss giving birth.   

    1942.        Mustapha M NDE       8/8/2009.      NDE 4038.       Originally from Algeria. Original in French translated by Simon A.      Then all of a sudden I could see myself floating within the water, in an incredible calmness and physical and psychological relaxation. I could see this body, very calm, drifting slowly, and saw bubbles coming out of its mouth. The scene was very real, but with an intense luminosity. I could see everything under the water, as if I had a diving mask on. My vision was near three hundred degrees. It was like being a short distance from my body, but I could also see what was happening behind me. I noticed small details: pebbles, which were ochre-colored (like fragments of house-tiles), also light-colored and striped pebbles, on the seabed, seaweed floating beneath the surface. The rest was sand. There were also small, almost translucent fish just under the surface, which were moving, then disappeared with a sudden flick of the tail.  
   Drowning NDE.   

    1941.        Valerie L NDE       8/8/2009.      NDE 4043.       From France. Original in French translated by Jean Peter.      This is when I had my experience. I don't know the exact date. I first saw myself as some sort of big smoke - it was me but not in my body. I tried to see my arms, my legs, nothing. I could only see myself as smoke. I turned around in some sort of concrete swimming pool, and I was not alone there. Somebody else turned around with me. But I did not talk to him, I did not even try to, we turned around clockwise. I don't know how I came back into my body. (Later I was told that I was in the intensive care unit and the person in the room next to mine was in a coma, maybe that was him, I don't know).  
   NDE episodes during hospitalization for heart problems.   

    1940.        Chantal T NDE       7/25/2009.      NDE 4031.       From France. Original in French translated by Jean Peter.      The voice talked to me again. No judgment, no blame, soothing sweetness, extraordinary tenderness, nothing else. I had the choice to 'go' or to stay, as incredible as it seems, all depended upon my choice, she guided and helped me, that's all! I knew this too, as if I were on another plane of consciousness. 'You did not complete what you had to do yet (this was no blame).' I knew it. I just answered, 'I did not know it would be so hard.' Then the voice told me, 'Think to A. (my husband) and to the children.'  
   NDE from a concussion.   

    1939.        Annie B NDE       7/25/2009.      NDE 4037.       From France. Original in French translated by Simon A.      Suddenly I found myself at the end of a dark tube (I don't know how I got to this point). There was a very luminous, blue light, with a fuzzy look. I saw many people coming towards me. When they were quite close, I recognized my mother (deceased 1995) with my father (ditto 1972), my grandparents (1966 and 1971), my great-grandmother (1970) together with my great-grandfather, whom I never knew. All of them, and me too, were about thirty-five years old. All, and me too, were dressed in a blue tunic tied at the waist by a cord. There were also many other people that I had no time to recognize. They were all welcoming towards me.  
   NDE from a pedestrian accident with an automobile.   

    1938.        Miguel G NDE       7/18/2009.      NDE 4048.       From Spain. Original in Spanish translated by Simon A.      That was when I thought: 'How could you be so stupid, you've finally done it, damned drugs!' and I saw how the person in the front seat turned round and looked at me with a very scared expression. Then I felt a sort of explosion in my chest and my heart stopped. My sight misted over and I left my body like a gunshot into the darkness. I was very scared and fully conscious that I was dying. I thought that in a few moments everything would be finished, as the state of lucidity I had for the moment must be from the adrenalin, which my body had surely secreted due to panic. Suddenly I found myself floating, I could hear and feel a sort of vibration, a buzzing, very pleasant and relaxing. I realized that around me were floating some strange and colored globes, very bright and strange, spinning on themselves slowly and all moving in the same direction as though pulled by some force. I looked in that direction and there was a warm, brilliant, white light.  
   Died from drug overdose.   

    1937.        Zoraida C Probable NDE       7/13/2009.      Probable NDE 4028.       From Bolivia. Original in Spanish translated by Simon A.      I saw dimly, but heard the shouts quite clearly, and then getting further away. I went through a black tunnel, which had red lights, and heard voices, without being able to make out whose they were. I felt cramps, and then I relaxed. Then I heard a voice, which was my grandmother, deceased eleven years before. She wanted to take my hand, and other voices were calling me too, but I didn't recognize them. I felt no fear. Suddenly I again heard the cries of my parents, but far away, and I concentrated on listening to them without knowing that they were calling for me.  
   Two accounts of probable NDEs.   

    1936.        Bobbi D NDE       7/9/2009.      NDE 4022.             The greatest emphasis of this experience is LOVE. I am so totally engulfed with a love that does not exist in our physical world. No matter how deep a love you feel for your children, it does not compare with this love. This love is the purest, truest, deepest, totally unconditional love that you could EVER imagine. Now, I realize you may be saying 'That's what I feel for my children.' I'd say that too. But, it goes way beyond what these words can describe. And I think this is because it is communicated to you in the form of feelings. It knocks your socks off. When I received this love, it is not comprehended with my mind. It is FELT by the soul.  
   NDE at age seventeen due to apparent infectious illness and coded during surgery.   

    1935.        Jen V NDE-Like       7/9/2009.      NDE-Like 4023.             I came into the light. The light was so brilliant but not warm nor cold. It was almost as if it consumed me. A feeling of Love so powerful and consuming washed over me. It was so potent that you could almost reach out and touch it. A group of people came toward me with warm greetings. They spoke to me with thought and I knew they were like me but I could not focus on facial features. They were to, consumed by the light and it spread from each of them. As I was aware of them welcoming me, I was also then aware that there seemed to be some confusion that I shouldn't be there. I was told it was not my time and that I should return to finish my life's work.  
   NDE-like experience at age sixteen. Very life-changing.   

    1934.        Mr. W NDE       7/9/2009.      NDE 4025.             I became aware of my senses at that moment and how much more detailed everything seemed and how it all appeared more focused and more sharp. It was like I was seeing the world for the first time with my own true eyes. It was the equivalent of taking off a pair of foggy ski-goggles or glasses. The colors seemed flat and muted but considering the lights were off in my normally pitch-black room I was astonished to be seeing everything with such clarity. I also recall hearing cars on the main road a good half mile from my house and hearing the television upstairs on the other end of the house. I could hear my father and grandfather speaking as if I were in the same room. This was abnormal in that my room was below ground in the basement and when I shut my door, the room was so quiet all I could normally hear was my own breathing. Likewise, there were no windows and the room was completely dark. I felt as though I had been liberated from my body and being outside my body freed me from the limitations imposed by a physical existence. My mind felt cleared and my thoughts seemed quick and decisive.  
   NDE due to suicide attempt with massive overdose of Coumadin (a powerful blood thinner).
