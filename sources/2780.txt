In issuing this volume I feel that I am fill­
ing a serious gap in astrological literature, for
no book on Electional Astrology has ever be­
fore been published, and the; subject is one
that is almost unknown to the great majority
o f students. From ancient times up to the
seventeenth century Electional Astrology in
common with all the other branches o f the
subject received a good deal of attention, and
it is a matter for surprise that it has not
shared in the present revival o f interest in
Astrology, considering the extreme popular­
ity and usefulness o f the matters with which
it deals.
I am aware that the field o f Elections is a
very vast one, and that much still remains to
be discovered, but I think I can claim to have
included in these pages all the available in­
formation on the subject, both ancient and
modern, leaving nothing to be added except
by way o f further original research.
This book is not intended for the casual
reader, and I therefore make no apology for
5

assuming a knowledge of the rudiments of
astrology, and the ability to erect a horo­
scope, such as may be obtained from any
elementary text-book. Beyond this, however,
no further call is made upon the reader’s
knowledge, and I have included an explana­
tion of every technical term, whether gen­
erally familiar or not, in a comprehensive
glossary.
It is in the hope and belief that the infor­
mation herein contained will not only be of
interest but will also prove a source of prac­
tical daily help that I offer it to the astro­
logical public.

The subject o f Electional Astrology, or
more simply Elections, is concerned with the
choosing, or “ electing,” o f propitious times
for the commencement o f any undertaking.
Essentially it is the converse o f Horary
Astrology, for though its methods and pro­
cedure are similar it starts from the point at
which Horary Astrology finishes and works
back to the point at which the latter begins.
T o put the matter rather more explicitly
let us assume that a business is to be started.
The business man selects a date and time
based upon reasons o f convenience or some
other” practical consideration, and this auto­
matically becomes the birth-time o f the un­
dertaking. A horoscope set for this time is
a Horary figure, or as Carter aptly terms it,
an Inceptional figure, and by applying the
rules o f Horary Astrology one can predict
the ups and downs o f the business then begun
and its ultimate success or failure.

But it is obvious that there is another way
of going to work. If the horoscope for the
start shows failure, why not begin at some
other time when the horoscope favours the
venture? In other words, why not choose a
suitable horoscope first, and fit everything
else into that? This is the theory upon which
Elections are based, and Electional Astrology
is concerned with the rules to be followed in
building up a favourable horoscope to suit
any givenpurpose.
The general principle of making an elec­
tion is extremely simple. We have to take
the planetary positions as we find themwithin
a certain limit of time, and arrange them
into the horoscope diagram so that the planets
ruling the matter concerned are as strong
and free from affliction as we can make them,
and all the hindrances and afflicting positions
are tucked neatly away where they can do
the least possible harm.
This process of making any given planet
as strong as it can be is known as fortifying
it, and it consists in placing the planet in a
12

favourable sign in an angle or an appropriate
house, and in so arranging the date that it
receives good aspects from the benefics
Venus and Jupiter, and is not afflicted, nor
in some cases aspected at all, by the malefics
Mars, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. U n­
fortunately we are always very dependent
upon the general planetary positions at the
time, and it is usually quite impossible to
make an ideal election, because the planets
will most disobligingly refuse to arrange
themselves suitably within the time-limit at
our disposal. In such cases we have to do
the best we can with the available material,
but with a little trouble it will always be
found possible to obtain an election that is
reasonably satisfactory.
The subject is usually divided into three
broad classes according to the basis upon
which the electional map is made, and we
have to consider Radical Elections, Mundane
Elections, and Ephemeral or Horary Elec­
tions.

Every writer upon the subject of Elections
agrees that the birth horoscope of the person
for whom the election is made is of para­
mount importance. As Ptolemy puts it in
the 6th aphorism of his Centiloquy, “ It is
advantageous to make choice of days and
hours at a time well constituted by the na­
tivity. Should the time be adverse, the choice
will in no respect avail, however favourable
an issue it may chance to promise.” Should
the nativity or directions indicate failure in
any matter, no election can possibly bring
success, and the reader must not imagine for
one moment that a knowledge of Electional
Astrology is the master key to all wealth
and happiness. Any experienced astrologer
can multiply instances in which an Section
has been made for something against the in­
dications of the radical or progressed horo­
scope and failure has resulted. Generally it
is found to be impossible to vse th
e tim
e
elected, for one obstacle after another arises
until finally the business is begun at quite a
14 •

and unafflicted. Thus if the matter is a
'financial one, the radical second house, the
sign on its cusp, and its ruler should be forti­
fied, as well as the corresponding positions
and planets in the electional map.
It is usually favourable to let the sign on
the radical ascendant be also on the electional
ascendant if it is not afflicted; and the signs
on the tenth or eleventh radical cusps make
good ascendants always provided that they
are fortunate positions in the birth map and
that their rulers are unafflicted. In any case
it is helpful to place the lord o f the radical
ascendant in an angle or succèdent house of
the electional map and oriental o f the Sun,
no matter whether it is a benefic or a malefic;
and to avoid placing it in a cadent house or
in an occidental position, especially if with
the Moon. A malefic that happens to be the
ruler o f the radical ascendant may be made
use o f in elections, for it is not harmful to
the person whose ruler it is. It is said that
the radical ascendant should not be moved
against the earth’s rotation, or in other words
that it should be upon the twelfth, eleventh,

or tenth house of the electional map rather
than upon the second, third, or fourth.
2 . M u n d a n e E l e c t i o n s
Many of the ancient astrologers considered
that an election should be based upon the im­
portant mundane horoscopes in force at the
time, especially if the birth horoscope were
obtainable. The chief map to be taken into
consideration in this case is that for the rul­
ing conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter, and
next in importance are those for the entry
of the Sun into Aries and for eclipses and
lunations. Thus the electional ascendant
should not be afflicted in the previous mun­
dane map, and the same rule holds good for
the planet signifying the matter of the elec­
tion. When this latter planet is the dispositor
of the Sun or Moon (and especially that
which is the “light of time” ) in the previous
entry of the Sun into Aries, or is ruler o f the
ascendant in that map and is strong and well
aspected both there and in the election, it
is said to denote extreme success and fortune
in the matter of the election, and in every-

thing arising out o f it. W hen the place o f
the previous New or Full Moon is dignified
and well placed in the electional map, the
matter will be well established and continue
steadily and fortunately. Success is also de­
noted when the dispositor o f the previous
New or Full Moon is oriental in the electional
map and in its own sign, provided it is in
sextile or trine with the place o f the luxa­
tion; but should it not be in aspect no effect
at all will follow.
The lord o f the triplicity containing the
Moon at the previous lunation is also said
to be powerful, and should be in good aspect
or in reception with the significators in the
election.
These are the chief rules that have been
put forward in regard to the use o f mundane
maps in Electional Astrology. Actually the
consideration o f such maps is rarely at­
tempted, and in the present state o f our
knowledge o f Astrology it seems o f little
use to complicate the issue by attempting to
bring too many factors into play.

3 . E p h e m e r a l o r H o r a r y E l e c t i o n s
This section is the only one that is usually
considered, and is the one with which we are
henceforth concerned. It comprises those
elections that are based upon the planetary
positions at the time for which the election
is made, apart from any consideration of
radical or mundane horoscopes. A t the same
time, however, the caution already given as
to the importance of the birth map must not
be forgotten, and this map must always be
borne in mind no matter whether the rules
specifically refer to it or not.
C H A P T E R I I
G E N E R A L P R IN C IP L E S
The first step in the making of an election
is to decide upon the'important significators,
that is to say, the planets, signs, and houses
ruling the matter for which the election is
required. By far the most important sig-
nificator in any and every election is the
Moon, and it is essential always to fortify
that luminary to the greatest possible extent;
in fact the treatment of the Moon in Elec-
tional Astrology is o f so much importance
that it will best be considered separately after
the other general principles have been for­
mulated.
Apart from the Moon then, the important
points, or “significators” as they are called,
are the cusps of the ascendant and midheaven
with their rulers or “lords” ; the house rul­
ing the matter o f the election and the lord of
the sign on its cusp ; and any planet or' sign
that has a general rulership over -the matter
in question. Thus in matters relating to
21
ELECTIONAL ASTROLOGY
business or employment the Sun is a natural
significator; in money matters, Jupiter; in
love affairs, Venus; and so on.
In a similar manner the general nature of
the signs is of importance. For example,
agricultural work is ruled by the earthy
signs, so that these become of added impor­
tance in-elections dealing with such work, and
must not be afflicted or contain afflicting
malefics. Watery signs have affinity with
voyages; airy signs with flying or with in­
tellectual pursuits; and so on. Therefore in
every case consider which sign or group of
signs relates to the business in hand, and
take care to make that sign or group strong,
angular, and unafflicted either by receiving
bad aspects or by containing an afflicting
planet. Again the speed at which the result
will be achieved depends largely upon the
signs. For a speedy conclusion, cardinal
signs should be chosen; for slowness or per­
manence fixed signs, and for change, or a
medium length of time, or when the question
' of time does not arise mutable signs are im­
portant. In all cases the chief significators
22
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
should be placed in signs relating to the na­
ture of the election; and the ascendant should
also be in such a sign or in one denoting the
speed or permanence desired. Thus in the
case of a voyage a watery sign should be
fortified, and the most appropriate one would
be Cancer, which itself denotes movement
and speed. This could be put upon the as­
cendant; or alternatively it could contain the
lord o f the ascendant or the Moon, and an­
other fortunate or unafflicted sign should be
chosen as ascendant.
It is always advisable to fortify the ascend­
ant, its lord and the dispositor of the latter,
as well as the fourth house, its lord and dis­
positor, because the ascendant is a general
significator o f the person using the election,
and the fourth denotes the final end of the
matter, but it is even more important to
fortify the Moon, and the house and planets
concerned with the business o f the election,
and these should take precedence if it is im­
possible to fortify both these and the ascend­
ant and fourth and their rulers. The house
ruling the business o f the election is always
23
ELECTIONAL ASTROLOGY
of considerable importance, and it should not
be allowed to contain afflicted planets or
malefics.
Furthermore the ruler of the sign on its
cusp must be placed in a strong and fortu­
nate position, and must also be unafflicted.
In considering the benefic or malefic nature
of a planet a very important point arises. If
in the birth map a planet such as Saturn or
Mars is the significator of the business of
the election this planet ceases to be a malefic
for the matter in hand and must receive spe­
cial consideration in the election. Similarly
if Venus or Jupiter afflict the significators
of the matter in the radical map it is of no
use at all to use them as benefics in the elec­
tion. A so-called malefic planet may favour
the business greatly in the radical map, while
a so-called benefic may strongly oppose it,
and it is therefore necessary to remember
that when the rules mention malefics and
benefics one must be guided by any strong
radical signification possessed by these plan­
ets, if the birth map is obtainable. If it is
not known, then of course the usual interpre-
24
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
tation must be put upon the terms. The
benefics or planets favouring any matter are
fortified by being placed in their own signs
or their exaltation signs, by being in angles
or failing this in succedent houses, and by
being in good aspect or reception with the
other significators. Cadent houses are gen­
erally unfavourable and denote failure, hin­
drance, or delay unless the matter specifically
refers to them, but even so extra care must
be taken to avoid afflictions.
'In general a planet is strengthened by
being in good aspect with one of its own
signs, and if it happens to be afflicted the evil
is considerably lessened by so placing it.
Thus if the lord of the ascendant is afflicted
it should be placed so that it is in trine or
sextile to the rising degree.
The ascendant itself should never contain
any malefic planet, and as already mentioned
care should be taken to choose a rising sign
that favours the business in some way, or
one whose ruler is strong and unafflicted. In
general both the ascendant and Moon are
best in signs of long ascension, which tend
25
ELECTIONAL ASTROLOGY
to cause speed and success, whereas signs of
short ascension conduce to hindrance and dif­
ficulty. But of course this rule is frequently
subject to modification and should not be
followed against other indications. O f the
signs of long ascension Scorpio is the most
to be avoided unless it happens to be appro­
priate to the matter in hand. In any case
whatever sign is chosen the lord of the as­
cendant should be kept free from affliction
and should be direct in motion, for if retro­
grade it usually causes much trouble, diffi­
culty, and delay even in the face of a very
fortunate map.
It is also necessary on nearly every occa­
sion to avoid placing either the Sun or the.
Moon in the ascendant. The Sun in the as­
cendant is said to undo all the benefit prom­
ised by the rest of the election, unless it is
in Leo or Aries and well aspected. If with
Saturn in this position it causes hindrances;
if with Jupiter, grief, sadness, and change
of place; if with Mars, sorrow, harm from
enemies, little help from friends, accidents,
or even death; if with Venus, much pain,
2
6
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
travel, quarrels with friends and others, and
slander; if with Mercury, sorrow and loss.
The Moon in the ascendant is very un­
favourable for almost everything, unless it is
strong by sign and very well aspected. - In
fact it is wiser to avoid this position in all
cases except when it is expressly stated to
favour the particular matter in hand. If
the Moon is in the ascendant with Saturn it
denotes sorrow, long and tedious illnesses or
death, loss of money, goods, and friends, and
trouble from influential people. I f with
Jupiter, it denotes journeys and voyages, but
may bring marriage, children, or other bene­
fits. I f with Mars, much harm and decep­
tion; if with Venus, it may bring health and
gain through women; and if with Mercury,
many changes o f work or friends. I f both
Sun and Moon are in the ascendant it is said
to denote loss, trouble, sorrow, danger to the
eyesight, and instability in the matter of the
election.
A s in Horary Astrology a certain amount
of use is made of the Moon’s nodes and
Fortuna or the Part of Fortune. The north
27
ELECTIONAL ASTROLOGY
node, Dragon’s Head, or Caput, is of a fa­
vourable nature and equivalent to a benefic;
■while the south node, Dragon’s Tail, or
Cauda, is of a malefic nature. It is consid­
ered evil to place Cauda in the ascendant, or
in conjunction with either the Sun or Moon,
especially at the time of New or Full Moon,
possibly because it would also be an eclipse.
In the case of Fortuna, it is said to be im­
portant to fortify that point and its dispos-
itor, and to place them in good aspect with
the benefics and free from affliction by the
malefics. Fortuna may safely be in a cadent
house, but it should not be separating from
the conjunction or aspect of the Moon, and
the Moon should not be in the second, sixth,
eighth, or twelfth sign from Fortuna (count­
ing inclusively). In general Fortuna is well
placed in conjunction or favourable aspect
with the lord of the ascendant, especially if
the question of profit or gain is of impor­
tance.
The house ruling the business of the elec­
tion is, of course, of great importance, and a
number of principles have been laid down
2
8
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
which cover in a general way all elections
coming under that house, the radical horo­
scope being also taken into account. These
principles are briefly as follows:—
S e c o n d H o u s e E l e c t i o n s . Fortify Ju­
piter and the ruler o f the radical ascendant,
placing either in the second unafflicted and in
good aspect with planets that were favour­
ably situated in regard to the radical second
or its lord. See that Jupiter is free from
combustion, and let the lord of the radical
second house be imaffiicted, strong, and in
good aspect to the benefics, or to planets
favouring money at birth.
T h i r d H o u s e E l e c t i o n s . Fortify For-
tuna, the Moon and her dispositor, and the
first and third houses, together with their
lords. Place planets in the third which were
fortunate and in good aspect to the third or
its lord at birth, but do not let them be lords
of the sixth, eighth, or twelfth houses.
F o u r t h H o u s e E l e c t i o n s . Fortify the
lords of the radical and electional fourth
house, and let the Moon apply to good as­
pects.
2
9
ELECTIONAL ASTROLOGY
F i f t h H o u s e E l e c t i o n s . Fortify the
sign on the radical fifth house, and put it or
its lord in the electional second, placing Jupi­
ter or Venus in good aspect to the cusp of
the fifth. Debilitate the seventh house and
its lord, but be careful not to afflict the
ascendant and its lord.
S i x t h H o u s e E l e c t i o n s . Fortify the
Moon and place her in Taurus, Gemini,
Virgo, or Capricorn. Let the lord of the
radical second be in the electional sixth in
good aspect to the ascendant or its lord.
S e v e n t h H o u s e E l e c t i o n s . Fortify the
lord of the seventh and the Moon, taking
care that they are unafflicted by the malefics
or by Cauda. Place Leo or Aquarius upon
the ascendant.
E i g h t h H o u s e E l e c t i o n s . Fortify the
^ ascendant, its lord and the Moon, letting the
•lord of the ascendant and the Moon apply
to a good aspect of Saturn.
N i n t h H o u s e E l e c t i o n s . Take care to
keep the lords of the radical and electional
ninth house free from affliction.
T e n t h H o u s e E l e c t i o n s . Place the rad-
30
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
ical tenth cusp upon the electional ascendant,
and fortify the Moon and the lords of the
ascendant and tenth.
E l e v e n t h H o u s e E l e c t i o n s . Place Ju­
piter and Venus in the eleventh house, forti­
fying the lord o f the eleventh and placing it
in good aspect to the lord of the radical as­
cendant.
T w e l f t h H o u s e E l e c t i o n s . Keep the
lord of the ascendant and the Moon free from
affliction, and place them in good aspect with
the lord of the radical twelfth.
The above rules are quite general ones,
and must not be considered in any other light,
for they may need modification in accord­
ance with the actual business of the election
as will be seen in later chapters.

The consideration of the 5) is of para­
mount importance in the study of Elections,
and it is always essential to pay special at­
tention to the lunar aspects and the sign and
house in which the 3> is to be placed. In
all elections it is a sound rule to fortify the
3), whether she be a special significator of
the matter in hand or not, because the 3 is
a general significator of everything relating
to human affairs, and anything begun at a
time when she is weak and afflicted is ex­
tremely unlikely to prosper. A s in all
branches of astrology, a good aspect between
the 3) and the © is an excellent foundation
for success, and will improve any election.
To be at its best it is said that the 3>
should be below the earth by day and above
the earth by night, but this is not an impor­
tant point, and is quite secondary to consid­
erations of house position. This relation of
32
MOON IN ELECTIONAL ASTROLOGY
the G and 2) is one of the fundamental fac­
tors that should be considered at the very
outset o f making an election, for the Moon’s
phase may make all the difference between
success and failure. In a quite general way
matters progress much more speedily and
successfully if begun when the 3) is increas­
ing in light, or in other words passing from
New to Full. There are certain purposes
that need a decreasing 2), such as destroy­
ing weeds or cutting down timber, but when­
ever growth or progress is needed an increas­
ing 3) is essential. The time of New Moon
itself however is an unfavourable one for
most things except such as require secrecy.
The first twelve hours after the exact mo­
ment of New Moon are known as Combust
Hours, and are unfortunate for beginning
anything. The next seventy-two hours are*
good and fortunate provided the 3) be strong
and well aspected, especially by the benefics,
at her entrance into the beginning of the
thirteenth hour. The next twelve hours are
again combust and unfortunate; the foifow-
3
3
ELECTIONAL ASTROLOGY
ing seventy-two are favourable; and so on
throughout the whole month.
I f an election is contemplated for a time
when the }) is just separating from the con­
junction or opposition of the O , that is, for
a time just after New Moon or Full Moon,
the planet to which the 2) applies after leav­
ing the O is of considerable importance, and
the general rule is that nothing should be
begun when the 2), on separating from the
conjunction or opposition of the O , applies
to the conjunction or aspect of a malefic,
especially if that malefic was unfavourable
in the birth horoscope.
The exact effect of the Moon’s application
to a malefic or benefic immediately after New
or Full Moon depends upon whether the luna­
tion itself was well aspected, strong, and for?
tunate, or otherwise. If the lunation was
unfortunate, and the 2) applies to a malefic,
any matter begun at that time will end badly.
This is all the more certain if the lunation
or its dispositor falls in a cadent house, or in
the third, sixth, ninth or twelfth house from
that one ruling the matter of the election. If
3
4
MOON IN ELECTIONAL ASTROLOGY
one or the other falls in a succedent house
good may come in the end, but only after
much trouble. I f after a fortunate lunation
the J applies to a malefic, the matter then
begun will start well but will fail in the end.
On the other hand if the 5) applies to a
benefic after an unfortunate lunation the be­
ginning will be bad and the end good, while
if the lunation was a fortunate one, both the
beginning and end of the matter will be good.
Having decided which part of the month
is most favourable according to the relation
of the I) to the O , the next step in the mak­
ing of an election is to study the Moon’s as­
pects and sign position, the former being
more important than the latter. The 3)
should be as well aspected as possible, espe­
cially by the planets that are of general or
particular significance to the matter in hand,
and even if few good aspects are obtainable
she should always be kept free from affliction,
especially by the malefics and the significators
of the election. Good aspects to the 3) from
planets that were fortunate in the birth horo­
scope are a considerable help, just as afflic-
3
5
ELECTIONAL ASTROLOGY
tions from the unfortunate radical planets
are particularly to be avoided; and it is said
to be favourable to place the 2) at the same
distance and in the same relation to the O as
obtained at birth, but unless the birth horo­
scope is known these considerations cannot
be taken into account.
It is preferable as a rule for the 3) to be
in no aspect at all to the malefics, for this is
better even than a favourable aspect, unless
the malefic concerned happens to be a sig-
nificator of the matter in hand. But in all
cases afflictions from the malefics to the 2)
should be avoided if possible. Sometimes,
however, an affliction from one of the ma­
lefics is unavoidable, and in such cases an
affliction from S is less evil when the 2) is
decreasing in light than when increasing,
while with Saturnian afflictions the reverse
holds good, and the affliction is less evil when
the 2) is increasing.
The ideal proceeding is to place the 2) in
good aspect to all the planets that rule the
matter of the election, or in other words to
the chief significators. But as a rule this is
3
6
M O O N IN E LE C TIO N A L A S TR O LO G Y
impossible and one must be content to have
favourable aspects to one or two of them
only, choosing the most important ones for
preference. If, as sometimes happens, the
2) cannot aspect two given planets Ptolemy
states that care should be taken to connect
her if possible with some fixed star whose
nature combines them both.
In choosing the Moon’s aspect it is most
important to avoid a lunar application to the
conjunction or aspect of any retrograde
planet, for anything begun at such a time will
quickly fail, and if other evil aspects are in
force at the same time, will end in consider­
able difficulty and trouble.
•The next consideration is that of the
Moon’s sign position. This should be as ap­
propriate to the business of the election as
possible, and full details will be found among
the special rules contained in later chapters.
In a general way the 3) is weakened by being
^ in Tikand VJ, its signs of fall and detriment,
but special considerations may over-rule this,'
as will be evident from the later rules. The
worst zodiacal position for the is said to
37
ELECTIONAL ASTROLOGY
be the Via Combusta, which extends from
150 to 150 T
T
L
- This is unfavourable for
everything but especially for buying and sell­
ing, travelling, and marriage and all matters
connected with women. Unless any special
signs are stated, it will be favourable to place
the 3) in 55, «,1133, or X /
The ancient astrologers considered the 3)
to be impedited or weakened in ten ways.
1. When combust or within 120 from the
O. This was considered a worse affliction
when applying than when separating. After
having separated 50 the worst of the effect
is over.
2. In her fall in iq,, and especially in in,
3°, the exact degree of fall.
3. Within 120 of the opposition of the 0 ,
and especially when applying.
4. In conjunction, square or opposition
with the malefics.
5. Within 120 of Caput or Cauda.
6. In the latter degrees of a sign contain­
ing a malefic.
7. When cadent, or in Via Combusta.
3
8
M O ON IN E LE C TIO N A L A S T R O LO G Y

8. In her detriment in Vi, or in T or £s,
all of which afflict her own sign 25.
9. When slow in motion, or moving at
less than her average speed of 130 n ' a day.
10. When void of course, or in other
words when she forms no aspects at all be­
fore entering another sign.
The final consideration is the house in the
electional map which the 3) should occupy.
If possible the 3) should be placed in the
house ruling the matter of the election or in
any angle except the ascendant, which, as
already mentioned, is usually a very un­
favourable position for the 3). A strong
position is advisable, especially if the matter
is one that involves permanence and long
continuance. When the business of the elec­
tion necessitates speed or concerns ephemeral
matters it is better not to place the 3) in too
strong a position, and in suchcases it is prefi
erable to place $ or the ascendant 01
midheaven. v

the 3>is favourably placed or aspected. In
such cases the only course to pursue is to
make the best of the available positions. If
the 3
> is applying to a malefic when the busi­
ness must be put in hand it is best to make
this malefic the lord of the ascendant, no
matter whether it be afflicted or not. But
take care that the chief significators are as
free from affliction as possible. If the 1)is
weak and afflicted place her in an angular or
succedent house, but see that she is in no
aspect with the ascendant, its lord, the lord
of the house ruling the election and its dis-
positor, or any other important significator.
If haste is essential under these conditions,
put the 3) in a cadent house in no aspect to
the ascendant, but let a benefic be rising or
favourably aspecting the rising degree.

TH E LUNAR MANSIONS AND
ASPECTS
It was the custom of the ancient writers
on Elections to give a list of the effects due
to the Moon's position in the various signs
and mansions, and the lunar aspects to the
other planets. There is no necessity for any
consideration of the Moon's sign positions
here, as this is covered to the fullest possible
extent in the chapters that follow, but for
the sake for completeness the effects ascribed
to the lunar mansions, and the traditional
electional influence of the lunar aspects are
appended.
The lunar mansions form a kind of lunar
zodiac of 28 divisions that is related directly
to the fixed stars and constellations, and only
indirectly to the zodiac of signs in ordinary
use. Each mansion is 120 51' 25".7 in ex­
tent, and the series begins at Aries o° of the
constellations, which now corresponds to
about Aries 19“ in the zodiac o f signs used
41
ELECTIONAL ASTROLOGY
in all astrological work. The exact corre­
spondence is not known with any degree of
certainty, and authorities are not agreed on
the exact date on which the two zodiacs co­
incided, but for the present purpose any dis­
crepancy that may exist is of little impor­
tance, and almost certainly less than one de­
gree. The latest estimate is that of Dr.
Vijaya-Raghavulu, which shows the sign
position of the first point of the constellation
zodiac as falling in Aries 190 10' 39".09 on
1st January 1937 with an annual increase of
5o".264799. The Arabic name, initial de­
gree, and electional influence of each of the
mansions is as follows:—

The exact astrological significance of the
lunar mansions and the methods of using
them have been almost entirely lost, and
there is much need for research in this mat­
ter.1 If we are to believe the ancient writers
they are of extreme importance, and much
of the old astrology was based upon their
use. In the words of Cornelius Agrippa:
47
ELECTIONAL ASTROLOGY
“In these twenty-eight Mansions do lye hid
many secrets of the wisdom of the Ancients,
by the which they wrought wonders on all
things which are under the circle of the
Moon.”
L u n a r A spects
Many students of astrology are in the
habit of choosing favourable times for every­
day matters by the rough and ready method
of looking for a day when the Moon’s as­
pects are of a generally favourable nature.
A glance at the detailed rules contained in
the later chapters of this book will afford
ample proof that a haphazard method such
as this cannot be of very great use or re­
liability, but at the same time one cannot deny
that it does possess a certain value, and at
least is better than no method at all for it
ensures favourable lunar conditions if noth­
ing else. The following notes on the lunar
aspects do not profess to be more than a brief
general guide, and are by no means exhaus­
tive, for full details will be found in later

CHAPTER V
PLANETARY HOURS
No treatise on Electional Astrology would
be complete without some account of the
Planetary Hours, not so much because they
are particularly important, but chiefly on
account of their extreme popularity. They
are quite as easy to use as the lunar aspects
described in the last chapter, and constitute
a very simple electional system by them­
selves. Needless to say any such cut and
dried system is of no scientific value and of
little practical reliability, but the Planetary
Hours have their uses in Electional Astrol­
ogy and provided they are used in a supple­
mentary way and not considered as in any
way replacing a properly made election there
is no reason why their effects should not be
tested.
The astrological day begins at the exact
moment of local sunrise, and the night be­
gins at local sunset. The time between sun­
rise and sunset is divided into twelve equal
56
P L A N E T A R Y H O U R S
parts, each of which is called one Planetary
Hour. Similarly the time from sunset to the
following sunrise is also divided into twelve
equal parts which constitute the Planetary
Hours of the night. Some modern authori­
ties consider that noon and midnight should
mark the exact halves of the day and night,
and therefore divide the time from sunrise
to noon into six-equal parts; from noon to
sunset into another six equal parts; and simi­
larly from sunset to midnight, and midnight
to sunrise. Whether this method is more
correct tlian the former and ancient one is
open to question, but for electional purposes
the difference is not usually sufficient to be
of importance, and occurs only at the change
of hour.
The rulership of the hours depends first of
all upon the days of the week, which are
themselves ruled by the planets as follows:—
Sunday is ruled by the Sun
Monday is ruled by the Moon
Tuesday is ruled by Mars
Wednesday is ruled by Mercury

Thursday is ruled by Jupiter
Friday is ruled by Venus
Saturday is ruled by Saturn
The first planetary hour starting from sun­
rise on any day is ruled by the planet ruling
the day itself. The succeeding hours are
ruled by the planets in a definite and fixed
succession, known as the Chaldean order,
which is as follows:— T?, 7f, 6 , O, 2 »
3). Thps on a Sunday, the first hour from
sunrise is ruled by the O ; the next hour is
ruled by 9 ; the next by $ ; the next by the
3); the next by 7?; and so on in the same
order throughout all the remaining hours of
the day and night. It is a simple matter to
work out the planetary hours for any given
day once the times of sunrise and sunsethave
been taken from the almanac, but for those
who need merely a close approximation there
are numerous mechanical devices on sale that
give the commencing times of each hour for
various latitudes and their planetary rulers
at a glance.

. This hour is favourable
for beginning undertakings that require
much time, perseverance, and patience, and
for dealing with Saturnian people such as
farmers, gardeners, miners and mineowners,
estate agents and elderly persons. It is a
good time to deal in land, houses, and prop­
erty, and to buy grain, coal, or other produce
of the earth or of mines. It is favourable
for digging, ploughing, and agricultural
work generally, and also for archaeological
and geological work, and anything relating
to the past or to old and antique things. It
is unfavourable for borrowing money, and
is bad for all journeys and voyages owing to
the risk of loss and disappointment. Servants
and employees engaged in this hour are apt
to prove idle and careless. It is bad for hair
cutting, and for putting on new clothes for
the first time. This hour is unfavourable
for taking medicine; and anyone who is
taken ill at this time may undergo a lengthy
and serious illness.

bankers, merchants, landlords, grocers, and
all Jupiterian people. It is a good time for
asking favours from influential persons, for
borrowing and lending money, and for seek­
ing employment. Journeys may be begun in
this hour, but it is not favourable for board­
ing ships. It is good for social functions,
banquets, and for joining benevolent societies
or becoming a Freemason. Sowing and
planting may be begun, but the hour is not a
good one for purchasing animals. It is un­
favourable for surgical operations, but a per­
son taken ill in this hour will soon recover.
It is an excellent time for becoming engaged
to be married.

hour for most purposes, and especially for
journeys and voyages. It is favourable for
dealing with doctors, surgeons, dentists,
chemists, engineers, soldiers, and others
under the rule of Mars, and also for work

engaging men-servants, but this is the case
'only when Mars is well aspected. Work re­
quiring much force and energy may be be­
gun in this hour.
H
our of the S
u

. This is not a very
fortunate one for general purposes, and is
chiefly favourable for obtaining preferment
and for approaching influential or titled
people and public officials. It is a bad period
for beginning buildings and entering houses
for the first time for it threatens quarrels
and dissatisfaction, and is a dangerous hour
in which to be taken ill. No new clothes
should be first worn in the hour of the Sun,
nor should any expenditure be incurred. It
is a bad hour for love, courtship, and mar­
riage. If the Sun is favourably aspected it
is a good time for dealing with people and
things ruled by the Sun, but if afflicted such
dealings should be avoided. This principle
applies to all the hours.

favourable time for beginning a journey, but
not voyages; and it is a good time to leave
another person’s house, but a bad one in
which to return to it again. It is unfavour­

Under this heading may be grouped a
number of elections which all refer to toilet
and personal matters.

The 3) should be in a mutable or earthy
sign, well placed and aspected, but not in
owing to its barren nature. For speedy
growth, however, it is better to let the ascend­
ant and 3) both be in watery signs. The 3)
should be increasing in light and motion, and
in sextile or trine to the lord of the ascendant
in the native’s birth horoscope. Afflictions
from the malefics to the 3

for they cause scurf and dandruff.
For the hair to grow thick, the 3) should
be in opposition to the 0 , and both it and the.
' ascendant should be unaspected by the malef­
ics.

If, 2 » or the O, but not in conjunction with
any o f them, and not in aspect to 1?. On no
account should the 2) be in any sign that in­
creases hair, namely, T , h , SI, and the latter
part o f t and VJ. In general let the 2)» aS'

the 2) and lord o f the ascendant be in the
western half o f the map. Always avoid an
affliction from the © to the 2) and ascendant,
especially in or from T .

Fortify the ascendant, its ruler and the 3).
Let the ascendant and the sign containing its
ruler be cardinal, and if possible let the 3) be
in T (except from the seventh to the fif­
teenth degrees, and 22° or 230), or 25 (ex­
cept the first six and last three degrees), or
the first fifteen degrees of or the first
eighteen degrees of ITS, or the first nineteen
degrees of ■?, or the first twenty degrees of
X. The 3) may also be in the first twenty
degrees of b , for there it promises pleasure
and satisfaction, but it should not be in any
other fixed sign, especially SI and Tib, the
former being particularly evil for the pur­
pose. The 3) should, if possible, be in sextile
or trine to the O , but if all these require­
ments cannot be met, then at least keep the 3)
out of T

to fortify the 2nd cusp and its ruler, and to

When putting on clothes for the first time

EDECTIONAL ASTROLOGY
let the 2) or the O be in the tenth house, free
from affliction, and if possible in sextile or
trine to 7f or 9 , with reception. Especially
avoid placing the 3) in the ascendant or fifth
house, and do not let the 3) or the rulers of
these houses be in or the last fif­

the ascendant, its ruler, the 2)»the dispositor
of the 2), the fifth house, and its ruler should
all be in cardinal signs and none in fixedsigns
except the first twenty degrees of b • B0^1
Ptolemy and Hermes state emphatically that
in the buying, cutting-out, or wearing of new
clothes it is extremely inadvisable to placethe
2) in S
Ieven if well aspected, and the latter
adds that it is equally bad for the 2) to be in
conjunction or opposition with the O or af­
flicted by the malefics.
These are the rules laid down by the an­
cients, and they may be supplemented in cer­
tain particulars. In choosing a sign for the
2) the nature of the garment should receive
consideration. Thus T is suitable for buy­
ing hats and headgear; bfor neckwear; 25
for coats, shirts, blouses, vests, etc.; T

E ngaging Servants
Fortify the ascendant, its ruler, the 3), its
dispositor, © and its dispositor, and also the
sign and ruler of the sixth house and its dis­
positor, and let the benefics be above the hori­
zon. Make the ruler of the sixth house ap­
ply to the ruler of the ascendant, or make
the latter dispose of the former. This is said
to make the servant diligent and respectful,
but if a malefic is in the fourth or sixth the
servant will be an unfaithful one.
I f these rules cannot all be observed place
the lord of the sixth in the ascendant or mid­
heaven, or in sextile or trine to the cusps of
these houses. If the servant is likely to be a
source of profit, as, for example, a helper w
a business, place the lord of the sixth in the
second unafflicted, but not essentially digni­
fied. If this is impossible place it in sextile
or trine to the second cusp or in reception

the lord of the sixth house be in good aspect
with the lords o f the ascendant and the second
house in the birth horoscope, and to see that
the second house and the 2) in the radical
map are unafflicted by the electional positions.
The }) should be strong, well aspected, and
free from all affliction. It is well placed in

2) in a fixed sign, and therefore it is gener- ^

avoid any afflictions in 25 and Tip, the do­
mestic signs.

In everyday matters of this kind the 2) is
of primary importance. When the 2) is in

suitable time for buying or eating mutton and

good for beef and also for sugar and sweets.
If in n or the other airy signs, and applying
to £ it makes birds unsafe, while if the ap­

onions, and tea. In Si, or when applying to

afflicted by S it is best not to eat herbs, vege­
tables and fruit, especially apricots, peaches,
plums and cherries. In or ss it is favour­
able for milk or foods made from milk such
as custards, etc., and also for confectionery.
In VI it is good for buying medicines, but
dangerous if afflicted by the raalefics. In

buying coffee, cocoa, and hares or rabbits.
In X it is favourable for fish, especially if

sary to beware of stale food, salted meat,
and cold foods.
When shopping beware o f afflictions in or

they cause absentmindedness, loss of parcels,
wrong change, and similar misfortunes.

of gas or short circuits.

W hen buying drills, gimlets, screws, screw­

B u yin g and Selling
The seventh house and its lord signify the
person (that is, the buyer or the seller) who
first broaches the matter; the ascendant and
its lord signify the person approached; the
midheaven and its lord signify the price of
the article; the fourth, its lord, and the 3,
the article itself; while the planet from which
the 3 Inst separated is co-significator of the
seller, and the planet to which it next applies
is co-significator of the buyer. The 3 inthe
ascendant is favourable for either buying or
selling, though it is bad for most purposes.
In buying, fortify © and place it in $ or
X in good aspect to I f , 2 , or £ if itself well
aspected. Let the 3 be decreasing in light,
and in a sign of short ascension. In selling
let the 3 be in a sign of long ascension, in­
creasing in light or motion, and joined with
the benefics. It will also be favourable for
8o
COM M ERCE A N D FIN AN C E
selling if the 3) is in b , 25, up, VS> or K
separating from the conjunction or favour­
able aspect of the 0> 9 , %> or $ , and
aspectmg the malefics but not in conjunction
with them. I f the 3) separates from the
benefits and applies to the malefics it is much
better for the seller than the buyer; therefore
to buy cheaply let the 3>separate from malef­
ics and apply to benefics. It should be noted
that there are contradictory statements
amongst various authors as to the best sign
position o f the 3) for buying and selling. It
has been said that the 3) "between the be­
ginning of and the latter end of H ,”
causes one to buy dear and sell cheap; while
when placed "between the beginning of 25
and the latter end of $ ” it conduces to cheap
buying and dear selling. This is a fiat con­
tradiction of the rule given above, and is, I
think, much less likely to be correct. I am
inclined to think that it arose through hasty
or careless study of the early writers on Elec-
tional Astrology, or through confusion over
the signs of long and short ascension.
In either buying or selling it is important
8i
ELECTIONAL ASTROLOGY
to keep the 3) and $ free from the conjunc­
tion or any aspect of 6 , for that always
hinders the business and causes discord and
wrangling. Some authors add that Cauda
exercises the same effect. If the 3) is pass­
ing from the first quarter to the full, it is best
for selling; while if from the full to the last
quarter it is best for buying. From the last
quarter to the New Moon is the best time for
buying things which the buyer would conceal
or keep secret. In selling it is also advan­
tageous for the 3) to be swift in motion and
in good aspect with the benefics at her en­
trance into the first quarter.
In buying to sell again fortify the 3) P^'
ticularly, and also $ , the lord of the second
house, and if possible the lord of the ascend­
ant Let the 3) be in conjunction or good
aspect with $ , strong by sign and house, and
free from affliction, especially by 6 • Fortify
the 3), the eleventh house and its lord if $
cannot be fortified, but at least see that £ lS

eleventh or both. The more strongly that
the 3) and 2 can be fortified, the more cer­
tainty will there be of gain.
BORROWING AND LENDING GENERALLY
The ascendant and its lord are the signifi-
cators of the borrower; the seventh and its
lord are significators of the lender; and $
and the 3) signify the thing to be lent. If,
however, the 3) is within 1 7 ® from the © ,
the latter becomes significator o f the article
instead of the 3). In order to bring the
matter to a satisfactory conclusion let the
lord of the ascendant and the lord of the
seventh be in good aspect or reception; or
let the lord of the seventh be in the ascendant,
or $ be in -reception, or in conjunction or
aspect, with the lord of the ascendant. See
that the 3> is not placed between 15 and
15 *nL nor in the ascendant at noon; and
take care that neither the 2) nor ascendant is
in the first degree of H , SL or f , which is
bad for both parties, and particularly for the
lender. Never lend anything in the hour of

afflicted by 6 there is much solicitation, diffi­
culty, and often quarrels; while if the afflic­
tion is from T

often failure or a disappointing end. Never
borrow or lend money when the 5 or ascend­
ant is in the first degree of n , it, or t , °r
the 2) is in the ascendant at noon, for much

‘•long time let the angles, and especially the

from affliction. But if the money is to be
used quickly let the angles, and especially the
ascendant, be in cardinal signs, or failing that
in mutable ones, and let the lord of the
ascendant, the 2), and lord of the second in
the radical map, and if possible in the elec-
tional map also, be in cardinal signs and free
from affliction. I f it is desired to keep the
money so that it may be used to advantage,

Part of Goods, or Fortuna, or their houses
or dispositors, especially those of the 2) and

Recovering M oney T h at is Owing '
When taking steps to obtain money that is
due fortify the lord of the radical ascendant,
and also Tf. Let either be in the second
house, strong and essentially dignified, free
from combustion and other afflictions, and in
good aspect to the benefics, especially to any
benefic that throws a good aspect in the birth
horoscope to the second house or its lord. •
In choosing a time in which to apply f°r
money that is due fortify the cusp of the
ascendant and its lord, and let the lord of thc
eighth apply by good aspect to the lord of
the ascendant or of the second. If, how­
ever, this is impossible let the lords of the
ascendant and second be in mutual reception.

W hen making a will let the ascendant, its
lord, and the 5) be in fixed signs, in order to
ensure permanence. I f they are in cardinal
signs it indicates that the will will soon be
altered. Let the be increasing in light and
slow in motion, and let the lord of the ascend­

In choosing a time so that the legatee may

the eighth cusp; or else fortify that cusp and
its lord and place them in good aspect to If

lord of the second or ascendant. If possible
place the lord of the eighth in the second, and
the lord of the second in the eighth.
In the case of a will made in emergency
during illness, the following rules should be
observed. If the 3) be slow in motion, un-
aspected, combust, or under the Sunbeams,
the testator will die and the will remain un­
altered. This is especially so if the 3) be in
conjunction (not in aspect) to 6 , provided
6 is not in the ascendant nor aspecting either
the ascendant or its lord. There is, however,
danger that the will will be lost or stolen.
I f T?, instead of 6 , is similarly placed in
regard to the 3) or lord of the ascendant, and
in no aspect to the ascendant, the testator will
live and the will will remain unaltered during
the rest of his life and after his death; but if
I? afflict the ascendant it will be altered.

ancient authors to make quite certain from
the birth map that one is at all likely to suc­
ceed in any such enterprise before attempting
it. Should the answer be sufficiently reassur-
ing to justify an election, then fortify the
lord of the ascendant, the 3), and the fourth
house and its lord, and let them apply to a
good aspect of 7f or $ , taking care to place
the malefics in cadent houses and the benefics
in angles.

It is not possible to deal with this subject
in these pages, for all the information avail­
able is confidential and I am not at liberty
to publish it. It will be obvious that the
radical map must receive careful attention,

chief importance, but the full consideration

Fortify the 2), the cusp of the tenth house,
and the lord of the tenth in the radical and
electional maps. Fortify also the planet rul­
ing the trade selected, and the signs influenc­
ing it, as given in all text-books of natal
astrology.

Note the planet ruling the occupation and
let one of the signs ruled by that planet oc­
cupy the ascendant or tenth house.
Learning A n y S cience
Place a human sign upon the ascendant
and let the 2> be in a human sign also. Put
the lord of the ascendant in the tenth or
entering it, and the lords of the tenth and
ninth in aspect to the ascendant. Let the 2)

ception with the lord of the ascendant. See
that the 3) is not decreasing in light nor
descending in latitude.
L earning M usic
Regard the chief significators $ , $, and
the 3). Place $ in some of her own digni­
ties (the stronger the better) and let 5 apply
to her also from some of her dignities. Ltt
the 3) be similarly placed, especially in X,
or separating from $ and applying to 9*
Let the ascendant be in a suitable sign, and
let 9 , and if possible $ also, have dignity
therein. See that S , $ and the 3) are an­
gular, but if it is not possible to place the D
in an angle let her be in the ninth house,
strong and well aspected. When learning
singing place the lord of the ascendant in
the ninth, strong and free from affliction.
Put the 3) in VS, which causes a carrying
voice, or in II or np. Fortify the ninth and
its lord and let them be free from all affile-

BUSINESS AND OCCUPATION
tions from the malefics; and also fortify the
tenth and its lord if adopting singing as a
profession. Bonatus says that to excel all
others in singing place £ direct and joined
to $ retrograde, either in the houses, exal­
tations or other dignities o f either of them.
W h e n L earn ing A n y W in d Instrument
Place the 2) in X , T

of Sb.
Setting U p in A n y T rade or Profession
Let the radical tenth cusp be the ascendant
of the election. Let the lord of the ascend­
ant and the 2) not only be free from afflic­
tion, but in sextile or trine to the lords of the
tenth and second houses. I f possible let the
benefics be angular and the malefics cadent,
but note that if the occupation be ruled by
one o f the malefics, that malefic should be
strong and well placed in the figure.
E ngaging A ssistants
The rules for this are the same as for en­
gaging servants. The planet and signs rul-
93
ELECTIONAL ASTROLOGY
ing the business, or the duties for which the
assistant is required, should be well placed
and aspected.
Starting in E mployment or Taking Up
a Position
Let the luminaries be in their dignities, or
at least not afflicted by the malefics. Let 1f
be in the ascendant and the O in the mid-
heaven. Let the seventh and second houses
be strong and fortunate, for if these are oc
cupied by the malefics it shows trouble
through money or associates, especially if %
and $ do not aspect them favourably.
E ntering th e Church or Beginning
Serious Studies
Fortify the ascendant, the third house, and
their lords, the 2> and its disposer, the 0 ,
and also which is the general significator
of religion. I f possible let the luminaries be
i n i or K , or let either of these sips be
rising. For mystical pursuits fortify W
also, and for study fortify 5 - If possible
let the significators be in good aspect to ea

houses.
M a k in g Contracts
Let the 3) he in the ascendant or in a sign
of the same triphcity, and if possible essen­
tially dignified, or in good aspect to her dis-
positor. Fortify the lord of the eleventh and
place it in a strong position.
P artnerships an d A greements
The ascendant, its lord and the planet
from which the 3) last separated denote the
party who began the business; the seventh,
its lord and the planet to which the 3) next
applies denote the other party; the tenth and
its lord denote what will happen between
them; and the fourth and its lord denote the
end of the business. The party prospering
most or most stable in the matter may be
judged by noting whether the ascendant or
seventh cusp is the better aspected by the
lord of the tenth, or is the more essentially
dignified.
Place the 3), the ascendant and its lord at
95
ELECTIONAL ASTROLOGY
the time of making the agreement or partner­
ship in mutable signs, especially n or 1$. If
t or X be chosen let the 3) be received by
If. Fixed signs are all unfavourable with
the exception of Sb, and so are cardinal signs,
except VJ. If possible place Fortuna, its de­
positor, and the dispositor of the 3) also in
mutable signs. Fortify all the significators,
placing them in aspect to the benefics and
free from affliction by the malefics. Let the
3) be increasing in light and motion, and
let as many of the significators as possible
be in aspect with each other or in reception,
especially the lords of the ascendant an
seventh.

Fortify the 2), the eleventh and its lord,
placing both in trine and reception with $ ,
and let $ be also well dignified, or else let
her trine and receive the lord of the ascend­
ant and lord o f the eleventh, the reception
being by house or exaltation. I f this cannot
be done let them be trined and received by
2f in the same manner, and let the lord of
the ascendant be well dignified. I f the friend­
ship is desired for the purpose of gain or
profit let Fortuna be in the ascendant; if for
gaining inheritance put Fortuna in the
fourth, and so with other houses according
to the purpose for which the friendship is
desired.
F or F riendship w it h Relatives and
N eighbours
Fortify the lord of the radical ascendant
and if possible let him apply to a good aspect
97
ELECTIONAL ASTROLOGY
of the lord of the third or vice-versa. Al­
ternatively let the lord of the ascendant and
third be in reception and well placed.
Fortify the radical third house and its
lord.
Reconciling People at V ariance
In the case of two brothers or neighbours
fortify the ascendant and its lord, the 3
)
and its dispositor and the third and its lord;
and let the lord of the third be in conjunction
or good aspect and in reception, by any dig­
nity, with the lord of the ascendant. If pos-
siple let the lord of the third be in good as­
pect with the ascendant, and the lord of the
ascendant in good aspect with the cusp of
the third house; or let the lord of the ascend­
ant be in the tenth or eleventh, and the I)
be in goo'd aspect with either or both of the
significators.
If the reconciliation be with a woman or
between women $ must be fortified. If
elders or superiors are involved attention
must be paid to I?; if equals, to 6 and if
young people or inferiors, to $ .
98
FRIENDSHIP AND FAVOUR
In general vary the above significators ac­
cording to the persons to be reconciled. If
you yourself are one o f the parties take the
ascendant and its lord for yoursdf, and for
the other person take the house and ruler
signifying him or her in the map, as the
fourth for the father, tenth for the mother,
seventh for the wife, fifth for a child, sixth
for a servant and so on, in the same manner
as the third was taken above for a brother,
sister or neighbour.
V isiting
On setting out to visit a person let the lord
of the seventh be in the ascendant, and let
the 3> be in aspect and reception with any
retrograde planet, for this ensures that the
person shall be met.
Joining Clubs or A ssociations
Fortify the lord of the ascendant and let
him apply to a good aspect of the lord of the
eleventh, or vice-versa. I f possible let the
lords of the ascendant and eleventh be in re­
ception or let the 3) translate light from the
99 *
ELECTIONAL ASTROLOGY
lord of the ascendant to the lord of th
e
eleventh. I f the club or association is con­
nected with any special purpose fortify the
planet and house ruling that purpose, and let
the former be in favourable aspect with the
significators.
W h en Becoming a Freemason
Take the twelfth house and its lord in­
stead of the eleventh, and fortify %•
F or Parties and Social Gatherings
Fortify the eleventh and fifth and their
rulers, and let the ascendant or 3) be in &
or ^ =, in good aspect to 2 . Do not let the
malefics be angular, and avoid afflictions
from them to the significators, for afflictions
from 6 denote quarrels or unpleasantness,
and from T
? slowness, heaviness, and bore­
dom.
In the case of garden parties it is better
to fortify 7f than 9 , for if 9 is strong there
is risk of rain.
IOO
FRIENDSHIP AND FAVOUR
Giving or S ending Presents
Fortify the fifth house and its lord and
also and see that 6 and 7? are in no as­
pect to these planets nor to the 2) and For-
tuna and their dispositors, the Part of Goods,
or the ascendant and its lord.
I f possible let the ascendant and fifth cusp
be in mutable signs, the best being X and the
first fifteen degrees of £ , after that n j, and
finally H .
R eceiving Presents
Fortify the ascendant and second house
and their lords, and also the 2> and its dis-
positor, for this will cause gain to come
through the gift. Also, fortify Fortuna, its
dispositor, and % , and see that 6 and T
?
are in no aspect to the above significators.
O btainin g Promises and A skin g Favours
Fortify the eleventh and its lord, the as­
cendant and its lord, and Fortuna and its
dispositor. Make the lord of the ascendant
in aspect to both the lord of the eleventh and
ioi
ELECTIONAL ASTROLOGY
the dispositor of Fortuna, or place one of
them in good aspect to the lord of the ascend«
ant and the other to the ascendant itself.
Let the 3) be well dignified and received by
the lord of the eleventh and the planet sig­
nifying the thing promised. Let the lord of
the seventh apply to the lord of the ascend­
ant or to the ascendant itself; for the seventh
denotes the party applied to, the ascendant
the person requiring the promise or asking
the favour, and the 3) the promise or thing
sought. Therefore it is favourable if the
3) separates from the lord of the seventh and
applies to the lord of the ascendant
The cusp of the eleventh should be in the
dignities of the planet signifying the person
approached; as, for example, 'h, if an old
person; % , if a judge or professional man;
and so on. Also let this planet itself apply
by good aspect to the lord of the ascendant,
and let the lord of the house signifying,the
person approached also apply favourably to
the lord of the ascendant. I f the father, take
the lord of the fourth house; if a business
i superior or an influential person, the lord of
102
FRIENDSHIP AND FAVOUR
the tenth, and so on. If the business concerns
money see that the second and its lord receive
a good aspect from the significators of the
person approached.
W hen asking favours from noble or in­
fluential persons, put I f in the ascendant in
good aspect and reception with the lord of
the tenth. Or put the lord of the tenth in
the ascendant or in sextile or trine thereto or
to its lord or the 2) * I f possible put the 2)
in the tenth, free from all impediments, and
let the lord of the ascendant also be strong
and unafflicted by the malefics. See that
neither 1? nor 6 is angular, especially in the
ascendant, unless it is a significator. If all
these conditions cannot be complied with let
the lord of the thing desired be in the tenth,
' or the lord of the tenth in the house ruling
the thing or in good aspect to it and its lord,
and if possible let the aspect be with recep­
tion.
When approaching a king or prince let a
fiery sign rise, and place the O in good aspect
to If or 9 . Or let the D be in the ascend­
ant in good aspect to the © in the tenth.
103
ELECTIONAL ASTROLOGY
When applying to a clergyman, doctor,
lawyer, or judge let the 3) be in conjunction
or good aspect with % , or even in square if
they are in reception. When approaching
elderly people let the 3) apply to a good aspect
of T?, if possible from angles. When ap­
proaching women, let the 2) apply to a fa­
vourable aspect of $ ; and when approach­
ing writers, editors, clerks, accountants, etc.,
let the 3) apply to $ . In all these cases take
care that your own significator is in favour­
able aspect or reception with the significator
of the person to whom you intend to apply.
To A ccomplish D esires or Gain Credit
for U ndertakings
Put i , X , or 25 on the ascendant Fortify
If, the 3), and the eleventh and its lord. If
possible place If in the eleventh or ascendant,
or at least in sextile or trine to one or both
of these places; and let him be in reception
with the lord of the eleventh. I f possible put
the lord of the eleventh in the ascendant, and
the lord of the ascendant in the eleventh.
Place the © in the tenth or the ascendant,
104
FRIENDSHIP AND FAVOUR
free from impediment, and the in trine or
sextile to him, or even in square with recep­
tion provided she be strong and unaffiicted.
I f possible let the 3) separate from I f , the
lord of the ascendant, or the lord of the
eleventh, when applying to the 0 , for this
denotes that the credit or praise will be spread
abroad.
CHAPTER XI
M E D IC A L ELECTIONS
The medical side of Electional Astrology
would require a large volume to itself if it
were to be adequately treated, and the task
would be beyond our present knowledge of
the subject. I have therefore not attempted
any complete account of all the elections that
could be made in accordance with present day
medical knowledge, partly because little is
known and a great deal of research work
would be needed to obtain the necessary in
formation, and partly because such work can
be properly handled only by a medical expert
The following notes embody all the informa­
tion that has been handed down to us, an
presumably tested many times in the past
F or a D octor to V isit a Patient
Make the angles and their lords as strong
as possible, and place the benefics therein.
For the ascendant and its lord well dignific
indicates that the patient will benefit, the
106
MEDICAL ELECTIONS
tenth, that the patient will be obedient; the
seventh, that the doctor will be able to go
through with his treatment; and the fourth,
that the medicine will be effective. Fortify
the ninth, its lord, the 3> and its dispositor,
for if the ninth and its lord be weak or af­
flicted the doctor will lose the patient's con­
fidence, no matter how good he may be. For
the doctor to gain credit let the 3) and %
be strong and dignified, and let the latter be
in the second or in good aspect to the cusp or
fortified lord of that house, Fortuna, and its
dispositor. Let the patient be first seen or
visited in the hour o f If.
T ak in g M edicine or B eginn ing T reat­
m ent
Let the ascendant be the sign ruling the
diseased part of the body, and see that it is
free from affliction. Fortify the 3) and take
care that it is not in conjunction or opposi­
tion with the lord of the sixth, eighth or
twelfth at the decumbiture, or in the patient’s
radical map, or in the election. It is best to
have no aspect from the 3) to these planets,
107
ELECT10NAL ASTROLOGY
but if one cannot be avoided let it be a sextik
or trine, if possible with reception. Let th
e
3) be in the eastern half of the map.
I f the illness is all over the body let the
ascendant be a human sign, =2: being’ thebest,
and let the 3) and lord of the ascendant be
also in human signs, strong and free from
affliction, especially by the above significators.
It is favourable to let the ascendant be ¡2: or
17| with the 3) therein in conjunction or good
aspect with the benefics. Avoid all aspects
from the malefics if possible, and if not let
them be good ones, but take care that the 3
)
is not aspected by two malefics or going to
combustion.
Note that in cases where no blood is drawn
the 3) may safely be in the sign ruling the
diseased part of the body. Avoid giving medi­
cine when the 3) is in the first 15 0 ° f ^ or
in conjunction or bad aspect with T
?>
or 3 , or when these planets are in mutual
aspect, for the operation of the medicine is
hindered. In preparing medicines avoid the
hours of I? and In undergoing electrical
treatment fortify and keep it free from
108
MEDICAL ELECTIONS
affliction, especially by 6 , while in ray treat­
ment fortify as much as possible.
Givin g P urgatives
Place the ascendant, its lord, the 2> and
its dispositor, or as many o f these as possi­
ble, in 25, Ti\, or X . Let the 2) if possible
be placed between 15 and 15 T
T
L
, aspecting
a planet below the earth and unaspected by
b , I f, and $ , or a retrograde planet. Avoid
having the 2) in T , y , VS, or the last half
of £ , and do not let either the 2) or the lord
of the ascendant aspect a planet above the
earth for these tend to cause vomiting. Ac­
cording to Haly the lord of the ascendant,
the 2), and dispositor of the 2) should be
strong, dignified, oriental, angular, and free
from "the aspects of the malefics, especially
in the case of the 2), the lord of the ascend­
ant and the ascendant itself. The 2) should
apply to £ , and be in reception with the
benches; and its dispositor if weak should
be in good aspect to the benefics with recep­
tion. The 2> should not apply to, or be in
aspect with, I f, for that hinders the effect.
109
ELECTIONAL ASTROLOGY
If the purgative is in liquid form iq, is th
e
best sign for the ascendant or 3); if» in pow­
der form, 25; and if as a pill, K . Avoid the
2) in the ascendant for it tends to cause swell­
ings, and also take care that the 3) and lord
of the ascendant are not in the fourth. See
that the lord of the eighth is neither angular
nor in aspect with any of the significators.
Giving E metics
Place the ascendant, its lord, and the ])
in the ruminant signs T , b , and VS, of which
b is the best. Let the lord of the ascendant
be exalted, or in sextile or trine to the rising
degree.
See that the 3> is in no aspect to any planet
below the earth for that causes the medicine
to work downwards, especially if the planet
be strong; therefore let the 3) be in conjunc­
tion or aspect with a strong and dignified
planet above the earth. Take care that the
2>, ascendant, and lord of the ascendant are
not in watery signs, especially Tq, and 25 for
that has a laxative effect.
n o
MEDICAL ELECTIONS

' Let the ascendant be 25, SI, or Ti& or, ac­

the benefics. Place the lord of the ascendant
also in T , b , or V$.

Let the ascendant be T , well fortified, if
possible, by the benefics, and free from the
aspects of the malefics. Let the 3) be in

aspect with the benefics and free from hin
drance or affliction. Take care that the O

not weak or afflicted. Keep the.ascendant
and the 3) out of earthy signs, and if an
aspect between the 3) and 6 is unavoidable,
take care that it is separating.
T reatment for t h e N ose
Let the ascendant be in 25, £1 , or nj, and
place the 3) in the ascendant in aspect with
a benefic, free from combustion and afflic­
tion, unaspected by a malefic, and not in con­
junction with a weak or retrograde planet
Surgical O perations
Let the 3) be increasing in light and mo­

operated upon nor, according to some au­
thors, even in aspect to it. Also see that the
ascendant and its lord are not in this sign,
nor let the 3) and lord of the ascendant be
cadent.
It is important to fortify the sign and its
lord ruling the part o f the body to be operated
upon, and place the lord of the ascendant in
the ascendant or midheaven, unaspected by
<J, at the same time keeping the 3) free from
any kind of hindrance or affliction. In a gen­
eral way the 3) is better in a fixed sign than
in a cardinal or mutable one, but this con­
sideration is a secondary one, and it is of
far greater importance to keep it out of the
sign ruling the part of the body operated
upon. Afflictions from T
? or & tend to cause
festering, gangrene, and other complications,
and are specially dangerous when the 3> is
near the conjunction of the © , and until it
has separated by fully twelve degrees.
ELECTIONAL ASTROLOGY
D ental T reatment
See that the 3> is not in T or b , and keep

to If or such as involve the fixed signs
should also be avoided. If anaesthetics are
to be used take care that ^ is well aspected,
both in the radical and electional maps.

that the 3) is not in Tib, and that â is not in

sion of Blood, E tc.
Let the lord of the ascendant, the rising
sign, the 3) and its dispositor be strong and
unaspected by T?, d , or the O f ° r these have
a hindering effect. The 3) in conjunction
114
MEDICAL ELECTIONS
with any of them hinders phlebotomy a day
before and after the exact conjunction; in
opposition, twelve hours; and in square, six
hours. The 2> in conjunction with $ or #
hinders blood-letting; twelve hours before
and after, especially if they be combust. See
that the 3) is not in SI, b , or the sign where
the incision is to be made. The 3) may be
in conjunction or good aspect with If or $
if they are not combust, and even in square
to them provided the 5 be in a good sign.
It is favourable also for the 3> to be in a
good sign, and free from affliction in trine
or sextile with T?, <J, or the O . But avoid
the D or lord o f the ascendant in the fourth
house. For those of sanguine temperament,
the 3) should be passing from New Moon

The ascendant, its lord, the Sun, and the
planet from which the 3 last separated are
significators of the man. The seventh house,
its lord, 5 , the planet to which the 3 next
applies are the significators of the woman.
The tenth house, its lord and occupants, and
planets aspecting the cusp or the lord denote
the things that will happen between them,
whether good or bad. The fourth house, its
lord and occupants, and planets aspecting the
cusp or lord denote the event and the end of
the marriage. #
Mercury denotes the children and if ig
nified and in conjunction or aspect with the
benefics, especially if in a fruitful sign, de­
notes a child speedily. Let the ascendant be
well aspected or occupied by the benefics, and
unafflicted by the malefics. Particularly
fortify the 3 for upon her much of the good

ELECTIONAL ASTROLOGY
or evil depends. Let the 3) be increasing in
light and motion (especially light), and if
possible past the first quarter and not in con­
junction with a malefic in the ascendant, for
that signifies continual strife and discord. If
this position be found in either nativity, the
party having it will have chief power and ■
will make strife, but if the 3) be above the
earth he or she will nevertheless be inclined
to make peace again. Be certain to fortify
9 , who is chief significator, and take care
that she is not cadent, combust, retrograde,
nor in fall, detriment, or afflicted by the ma-
lefics. No marriage can be good if $ |
s
weak or afflicted, nor can it be very bad if
9 is strong and well aspected. If possible
put % in sextile or trine with 9 , or ? ,n
reception with If, and the 2) in a sign ruled
by either or in one of their terms and if pos­
sible in good aspect with them. Or place the
lord of the seventh in good aspect to 9» 5 >
or lord of ascendant, but make the lord o
the seventh be disposed of by them by one
of the essential dignities. Let the 3>,
and 9 if possible be in sextile or trine to
MARRIAGE AND CHILDREN
each other, but the trine is best and in the
watery triplicity. Be sure they, or any of the
significators, are not in the signs or parts of
signs to be avoided, especially in the ascend­
ant. The values of the signs are as fol­
lows :—
*!f*. Bad for marriage.
b . From o ° to 19 0, good; the rest bad.
n . The first fifteen degrees are good, the
rest bad.
25. Bad for marriage, except when mar­

deceive the other as to his or her money or
possessions.
TIJ. Bad for marriage except when mar­
rying a widow. Indicates that the husband
soon dies.
=fir. Good for betrothal but bad for mar­
riage.
IT. The first fifteen degrees are good for
marrying a maid or virgin, indicating that
she will be obedient, good, chaste and loving.
The last fifteen degrees are entirely bad, and
denote a woman who is lewd, quarrelsome,

disobedient.
i . Indifferent, but not unfavourable.
VJ. The first ten degrees are bad for mar­
riage. The rest of the sign is good, especially
in marrying a widow, and denotes that the
woman will be loving and tractable, though
she will have few children.
zz. Bad. Causes the woman to be mas­
culine and disobedient.
K . Good. Make the woman loving and
just, though it inclines her to chattering.
These effects are strongest when the 3) is
in the sign, but are also felt when it is on

a masculine, the marriage is better for the
man than for the woman; and if otherwise,
vice-versa; while if If or 9 is in the tenth
house at the time of marriage it is said to
indicate immediate conception. On no ac­

end to the marriage. I f the benefics are in

The chief significators in this matter are
the ascendant and fifth house and their lords,

many of these as possible and place them in
male signs, if a male child is to be conceived,
or in female signs if a female child. I f the
significators are equal in regard to sex look
to the lord of the hour and the planet to
which the 3) applies. If the significators
are still equal an hermaphrodite may be born,
and if the significators are in double-bodied
signs there is a likelihood of twins. For a
male child let fixed signs occupy the angles,
and let the ascendant be a masculine sign of
long ascension free from affliction by the
malefics. Place the benefics free from afflic­
tion and strong, and take care that no ma­
lefic or feminine planet is angular. Let (the
luminaries be strong and free from affliction,

When beginning to build fortify the as­

itor, and the planet to which the 3) applies.
Also fortify the fourth and second houses

lord if the house is to be a high one. Take
care that the significators are not below the
horizon, for that hinders progress, though
the }) may be in the third or fifth if well
aspected by a benefic or significator above the
horizon. Fortuna should be angular and its
dispositor strong, while $ and its dispositor
should also be well placed.
Avoid any afflictions from 6 to the sig­
nificators, and see that is not in a strong
position; it should be in good aspect to $ ,
and in a sign or part of a sign ruled by that
planet. The 3> should be increasing in light
and motion, free from T

ELECTIONAL ASTROLOGY
applying to If, for that improves the appear­
ance of the house. There should be no aspect
between T

? must not be in the
ascendant or fourth, for if there it will hinder
the work, cause the house to stand empty,
bring trouble to the inhabitants, or quickly
need repair. If 6 be in the ascendant in a
sign of short ascension there will be damage
by fire. Let the 3) be in aspect to its dis-
positor, and let the ascendant be aspected by
its ruler, all free from affliction, for other­
wise the landlord of the house will never live
in it. Cauda is best in the twelfth, and must
not be in the ascendant, fourth, or second,
especially the latter, but Caput may safely be
in any of these houses.
I f all these requirements cannot be satis­
fied fortify the ascendant, 3), second and
fourth houses and their rulers, and let the ])

Some astrologers are o f opinion that the
significators should be joined to powerful
fixed stars, but this is not of great importance
in the case of the building of houses, and re­
fers more particularly to the erection of pub­
lic buildings and cities.

house, for that causes water to fall rather
than rise. Let the 2) and its dispositor be
dignified, and in the third or fifth house in an
earthy sign.
If the 2) is in any house below the earth,
take care to fortify her, and place her in
aspect with a benefic above the earth, prefer­
ably in the tenth. If, however, the 2> has to
be above the earth, place her in an earthy sign

It is also beneficial to place © in one of its

planets, signs and angles are as follows:—
The G rules the front entrance, hall, din­

3> rules the cellar, water system, lavatory and
bath-room, and the doors. $ rules the li­
brary, study, picture-gallery, and tool-shed.
$ rules the bed-rooms, drawing-room, and
women’s rooms generally. 6 rules the
kitchen and fire-places. I f rules places where
wood is kept, store-cupboards, and larders.
T
? rules dark, secret, or little-used places;
while Caput rules the stairs, and Cauda rules
places for animals. The airy signs rule the
eaves and upper parts of rooms or of the
house itself, n ruling walls or partitions;
=£: cupboards; and ss places near doors.
Watery signs rule the larder, lavatory, sinks,
and places near water, 77^ being especially
concerned with sinks and dirty water, and 25
with the glass work. The fiery signs rule
chimneys, and parts constructed of iron;
while the earthy signs rule the floors and

of the house; and the fourth, the middle of
the house, and the room where the oldest per­

A t the time o f making the negotiations let

the benefics. If the lord of the fourth is of
a watery, cold or moist nature, take care that
It is not aspected by 7?, and that the lord of
the tenth is not weak or afflicted.
Benefics or essentially dignified planets in
the fourth, or the cusp and lord of the fourth
well aspected, denote fertile and good soil.
In the seventh, they denote strong and fruit­
ful plants. In the tenth, they show much ex­
cellent timber, and tall, 'sound, and fruitful
trees. Malefics or weak planets in the angles
cause much trouble and annoyance. In the
seventh they cause malice, deceit and loss
through workers on the land or tenants of the

For if the ascendant and its ruler are strong
it denotes that the hirer is honest, and just,
and will keep his side o f the bargain, while
if they are weak trouble will result. For the
greater advantage of the hirer, let the lord

JOURNEYS AND MESSAGES
J o u r n e y s
The ascendant rules the starting place, the
seventh, the place to be visited; the tenth,
the circumstances of the journey there; and
the fourth, the circumstances of the return
journey. The general outcome can be judged
by the affections of these places.
In starting a journey let the J) be increas­
ing in light and motion, in good aspect to the
© , free from impediment, and unafflicted,
for an affliction to the J) is worse than to the
ascendant. See that the J) is not in the sec­
ond, eighth, fourth, sixth, nor twelfth which
cause delay and hindrance, but let her be in
the fifth or tenth in aspect with her disposi-
tor and the benefics and essentially dignified,
which causes good success, gain, health and a
speedy return. Let the eighth, seventh, and
second houses and their lords be fortunate,
for th

traveller when he arrives at his destination;
the seventh, what happens when he comes
away from it; and the second what happens
at his return home. Therefore payparticular
attention to the eighth and its lord when
starting a journey, and to the second and its
lord when returning. Let g be free from
combustion and unafflicted by the malefics.
Mercury when retrograde delays an out­
ward journey but hastens the return, and in
general a retrograde or peregrine planet
hinders travel. Let the lord of the ascendant
be unafflicted by the malefics, free from com­
bustion, and in a good house. Place a benefic
in the ascendant or in an angle for this makes
for safety, speed, and pleasure. But avoid
the 2) in the ascendant in either going or re­
turning for that causes sickness and much
trouble. It is, however, favourable to let
the 2) apply to an aspect with the ascendant
and its lord, both of which should be free
from affliction by the malefics. Prosperity
and success follow the 2) in good aspect or
conjunction with %or $. If the 2) is in­
creasing in light and motion the journey will

if the 5 or T
j or both be in the ascendant or
seventh, or T
? in the ascendant and 3
> in the
seventh there will be many sicknesses, losses,
quarrels and danger in the journey or the
place visited. The 3) in the tenth or eleventh
is good, less so in the third, fifth or ninth,
and least in the seventh or fourth. But the
3) is most productive of harm in the ascend­
ant, second, sixth, eighth or twelfth. When
the 3) is in Via Combusta or peregrine in the
beginning of a journey, the traveller will
either be taken ill on his journey, or will
otherwise suffer loss or injury. See that no
malefic occupies the eighth or any angle, and
take care that 6 does not occupy the third,
ninth, or second, especially the latter.
Some of the ancients say that the ruler of
the preceding Vernal Equinox should be for­
tified, and also the sign and planet in that
figure denoting the purpose of the journey.
The ascendant of that map should not be ca­

is to an influential man or for business ad-
ELECTIONAL ASTROLOGY
vancement let the tenth cusp of the Equinox
be rising and so on.
If the radical horoscope be known choose
a day and hour in which the 2) and ascendant
agree with the birth map. Let the eleventh
and third houses and their rulers be fortu­
nate. Watery signs are best for voyages, but
fixed signs for inland journeys. If going to
an influential person or for a business pur­
pose let the radical tenth house ascend; and
in general let the planet governing the person
visited or the purpose of the journey be
strong and in good aspect to the lord of the
ascendant or ]). Avoid a malefic in the radi­
cal ninth house, and fortify the lord of the
ninth. In general it is favourable tolet the D
apply to the significator of the person to be
visited, e.g., to Sfor soldiers, surgeons, etc.,
to the O for nobility, and so on. This sig­
nificator should be placed in the ascendant,
tenth, or eleventh, and never in the fifth,
seventh, or fourth or in an occidental position
for that brings trouble.
Furthermore the significator of the pur­
pose for which the journey is made should be

the daytime is *1°, there is said to be danger
from thieves. If b , gain by cows, oxen,

ants. If 25, good luck and good health, ex­

According to some of the ancients the de­

steps out of his house are his significators,
and the degree rising and its lord when he is
just out of sight of his house are the signifi­
cators of the journey.

For enterings generally see that the second

impediment and not cadent. If the lord of
the second is combust, the traveller will die
suddenly in the place. If it is in the seventh,
he is subject to quarrels, personal harm, loss,

The ascendant and its lord denote the chal­
lenger or beginner, and the seventh and its
lord the other person. Fortify the ascendant
and its lord (if the challenger is to be fa­
voured) and debilitate the seventh and its
lord. Let a cardinal sign rise, and let the
lord of the ascendant be in the fifth, well
aspected by 2£, 9 , or the lord of the fifth;
or let the lord of the fifth be strong and un-
affficted in the ascendant. Let the lord of

trine to the lord of the fifth, if possible with
reception.
To win money let the lord of the fifth sepa­
rate from a good aspect of the lord of the
eighth, and apply to the lord of the ascendant
or second. Take care that the lord of the
ascendant, the 2), and the lord of the second
are not afflicted by the lord of the fifth,
i55
ELECT10NAL ASTROLOGY
seventh or eighth house, for this causes loss
of money. Also see that the lord of the fifth
is not in the seventh or in good aspect to the
lord of the seventh. I f possible place the
lord of the eighth in the second, or applying
to that house or its lord, or to the lord of the
ascendant. If that is impossible place him in
the ascendant in reception with the lord of
the second or ascendant. But take care that
the lord of the eighth does not receive or dis­
pose of the lord of the second, especially while
play is in progress. The sign on the radical
fifth house may be placed upon the electional
second cusp in good aspect to % or 9 , pro­
vided it is not afflicted at birth. (These rules
must, of course, be reversed if the person who
is challenged is to win.)
Let the 2) when play begins be above the
earth, strong, and separating from one be-
nefic and applying to another, preferably
stronger, essentially dignified, and above the
earth. If the 3) be in good aspect to , or
to the cusp of the second or its lord, so much
the better. Let the person to win sit facing
the place of the 3) in the heavens. If the 3)

on. The points of the compass shown by the
houses are as follows:— ascendant, East;
fourth, North; seventh, W est; and tenth,
South. The intermediate houses indicate in­
termediate directions. Thus the middle of
the second house is N E , and its cusp is N E
by E ; while the third cusp is N E by N . In
general it is best for the challenger if the 3)
is in the east and he sits facing it; or for the
person challenged if the ]) is in the west and
he faces it. I f the 2) is below the earth when
play begins this rule should be reversed, and

wards; if to a malefic and then a benefic, he
loses at first and wins in the end.
In Playing Chess let the 3) apply to g

3) is in reception with them both. If the
sign is a mutable one neither player will gain
much.
If a benefic is in the ascendant, the be­
ginner wins, especially if a malefic be in the
seventh, and vice-versa. The lord of the
ascendant in the midheaven favours the be­
ginner. If the lords o f the ascendant and
seventh be in opposition, the players will
quarrel. When the lord of the ascendant is
retrograde the beginner will cheat, and in
cards a retrograde planet indicates a revoke.
I f both the lords of the ascendant and seventh
be equally dignified in the tenth the game will
be an even one. When 5 and the 3) are in
the ascendant there will be many words and
much wrangling; $ there, they will tell many
lies, especially the beginner; 7? there, neither
side wins and after a tedious dispute they
leave off; If there, they part in anger; $

game will be quickly won.
Jf leaving home to play, face the 3), and
let the lord of the ascendant be above the
earth, free from combustion and the affliction
of the malefics, and let him apply to the be-
nefics and be in the midheaven or eleventh.
In the case o f outdoor games or sports
place the significators in appropriate signs,
and take care that 6 and $ are fortified and
free from affliction.
Races
The following rules apply to races between
two competitors and not to horse-racing in
general which does not come within the scope
of the present book.
I n F oot Races let a human sign rise or
contain the 3). Fortify the eleventh and de­
bilitate the fifth. Also fortify $ , and make
it the ruler of the eleventh, or place it in the
eleventh and dignified, or in the ascendant or
tenth in good aspect to the 2> or lord of the

pecially i> on the ascendant. Fortify the
midheaven, ascendant and twelfth houses and
their lords, placing- them in good aspect to
the benefics, and debilitate the seventh and
sixth houses and their rulers. Also let the 2)
be swift in motion and if possible in $ or
in good aspect with the O , <3, $ , or '2/.
This promises victory for the challenger who,
as in playing games, is represented by the
first house. If the lord of the seventh is
strong and better fortified than the lord of
the ascendant, or if the 2) is slow in motion
and afflicted by a malefic the challenger loses.
If the lord of the twelfth is retrograde, or
the lord of the ascendant is afflicted, hurt or
misfortune will befall the rider or horse on
the challenger’s side. Make % lord of the
eleventh, or place him in the eleventh in some
of his dignities, or place him in the ascendant
or tenth in good aspect to the 2) or lord of
the ascendant. See that the 2> is not afflicted
by T?, 3 >or , and avoid mutual afflictions
among the latter planets. It is unfavourable
to place Cauda in the ascendant or in con­
junction with the 3); and it is better to avoid
160
GAMES AND SPORTS
the © , $ , 6 or T
? as lords of the ascendant
or of the hour in which the race begins.
When riding a horse to win in a race where
there are several competitors, fortify the as­
cendant, its lord, the 3) and its dispositor, the
planet to which they are joined, and also For-
tuna and its dispositor; and make the lord
of the ascendant and the 3) apply to the lat­
ter. Then place the lord of the hour in the
ascendant at the time of stepping out of the
stable. I f all cannot be done, be sure to place
the lord of the hour in the ascendant, and for­
tify the 3), placing her if possible in $ or
the first half of See that neither the lord
of the hour, the 3), nor the lord of the as­
cendant is in its fall, for that denotes that the
horse will fall in the race.
H u n tin g , F ow ling, and F ishin g
The ascendant, its lord and the 3) denote
the hunter; the sixth and its lord denote the
dogs, traps, or other instruments of hunting,
and the seventh and its lord, the creature
hunted. Place on the seventh a sign of the
nature of the animal hunted. For hare,
161
ELECTIONAL ASTROLOGY
deer, fox, etc., place a bestial sign such as T ,
b or Vi, with the 3> therein. For wild beasts
choose i l or the last 15 ° of ■£. Fortify the
ascendant, its lord and the 3), and the sixth
and its lord, and debilitate the seventh and
its lord. Avoid T
? in the seventh, for that de­
notes disappointment.
In fowling or hunting birds by traps and
dogs, let the ascendant be in an airy sign, and
its lord in an earthy one. Fortify the sixth
and its lord, but debilitate the seventh and its
lord. Place the 3) in IT, £=, or cr, applying
to £ , and let both be well placed and in recep­
tion. Add a good aspect to $ also, if pos­
sible, to increase the pleasure. If the 3) be
afflicted by T
? or 6 , the fowler will catch
nothing he desires.
In haivking or shooting birds let the as­
cendant and its lord be in airy signs, and
place the 3) in C
Y

however the 3) is in the midheaven afflicted
by S the falconer will lose his hawk.
For water-fowl such as duck, mallard,

its lord strong in a watery sign, or vice-
versa.
In fishing let the ascendant and its lord
be in watery signs and well dignified. For­
tify the sixth and its lord and debilitate the
seventh and its lord. For sea-fishing and
shell-fish let the ascendant be 25, with If in
X . For smaller fish or when fishing rivers
or pools, let X rise. Place the 3) in 25 or X
in the tenth in sextile or trine to $ in the
seventh. Take care that the 2) is applying
to, and not separating from, any planet in a
watery sign. See that the 3) is not afflicted
by either h or <5, and avoid placing the lat­
ter planet in angles, especially the first or
seventh.
In teaching dogs to hunt place the 3> in T
in conjunction with 6 , which makes them
courageous and quick to learn. But let 7f
also be in aspect, to preserve them from
danger in hunting.
In teaching setters place the ascendant in
an earthy sign, and the lord of the ascendant
in conjunction with the 3) in an airy sign, and
163

in good aspect to # and 9 which add docil­
ity and gentleness.

If the 3) applies to a retrograde planet
when starting to hunt or fish it denotes noth­
ing but weariness and trouble; if it be in the
ascendant it denotes great agility, and if 6
be in the midheaven it denotes the same to the
animal hunted. In general, in hunting place
the 2) in the midheaven and a cardinal sign
rising,”with % therein in good aspect to the
2). Place 6 in the seventh, T
? cadent in no
aspect to the ascendant, and 9 in the ascend­
ant or midheaven receiving the application
of the 2) -
Competitions, L otteries, Etc.
In competitions where there are only two
competitors follow the same rules as for
games. Open competitions, sweepstakes, and
similar ventures cannot safely be made the
subject of elections, for no matter how good
a time be chosen to enter it is possible that
one or more of the other competitors entered
164
GAMES AND SPORTS
at an even better time. Moreover, the ques­
tion of relative birth horoscopes, and direc­
tions becomes of great importance. It is said
that the 5) should be in good aspect to the
lord o f the radical fifth house, and itself well
aspected, when taking tickets in lotteries or
sweepstakes, but this alone is obviously not
sufficient to ensure success.

I had originally intended to deal with law­
suits under a separate heading instead of in­
cluding them with wars and fighting, but to
have done so would merely have entailed an
almost entire repetition of rules with little, if
any, corresponding benefit. There is no es­
sential difference between a lawsuit and a
battle, and the same rules apply equally to
either, but of course it will be obvious that
whereas is of prime importance in a fight,
$ and If will be almost as much so in a law­
suit. I f the general principles o*f Electional
Astrology have been grasped there will be no
difficulty in modifying the rules and choosing
the correct significators for any special pur­
pose.

The ascendant, its lord and the planets in

WARS, FIGHTS, AND LAWSUITS
lord denote the challenger, or the person who
begins the controversy; and the seventh, its
lord, and planets in the seventh or in conjunc­
tion or aspect with the lord denote the other
side.
I f the person signified by the ascendant
is to be victorious let one of the signs o f h ,
% , or d be rising. A martial sign is to be
preferred, and in this matter Tib is better
than T . Take care to make the lord o f the
ascendant dispose o f the lord o f the seventh,
or be more dignified, fortified, and elevated
than that planet If, however, the side sig­
nified by the seventh is to be favoured reverse
the above rules. These are the general rules
for all controversies of any kind, but a num­
ber o f other considerations were laid down
by the ancients. The following rules are ar­
ranged so as to make the ascendant the side
to be victorious, but if the other side is to be
favored the rules must be reversed.
Let the lord of the ascendant be in the as­
cendant or in good aspect with its cusp and
also with 6 . I f the lord of the ascendant is
not in the ascendant he should be in the tenth,
167
BLECTIONAL ASTROLOGY
or, failing that, in the eleventh, and dignified.
Take care that he is not in the fourth or sev­
enth, for there he is in the power o f the
other side, nor in the eighth (which in a
fight causes danger of death), nor retro­
grade, cadent, afflicted, or in reception with
any afflicted or weak planet. Also place the
lord of the seventh (the side to be van­
quished) in the ascendant or second, and ap­
plying, preferably by good aspect, to the lord
of the ascendant, for that denotes a desire to
come to terms.
Take care to fortify 6 and let him be well
placed, dignified, and either lord of the house
ruling the victorious side or in good aspect
to the significators of that side. Never begin
a lawsuit or other controversy when the is
weak or afflicted. Fortify the second house
and its lord, and let it be strong and dignified.
For in duels, this house indicates the second
of that person denoted by the ascendant; in
wars it denotes the militia, money,* and all
helpers; and in lawsuits, the helper^ or the
help itself. Conversely the eighth denotes
these things for the side signified by the
1
68
WARS, FIGHTS, AND LAWSUITS
seventh. It is also necessary to fortify the 3),
its dispositor and $ , and let them*apply to
the significators o f the side to be victorious.
In F ights and L aw suits where only two
people are concerned, it is best to examine
their radical horoscopes if possible. Victory
will go to that one whose ruler of the ascend­
ant is most essentially dignified, with due re­
gard to current influences. In the case of
fights, however, the radical and directional
strength of d in the respective maps is of
importance. All things being equal the vic­
tory is said to go to that person born at night.
Hermes says that when the significators are
in double-bodied signs the winner of a fight
or lawsuit gains a great victory and the loser
loses heavily, for the good or evil effect is
doubled by these signs. In the case of •wars
between rival kings the maps for their coro­
nations should be studied as well as their per­
sonal horoscopes. The Parts of W ar and of
Victory should be fortified like the other sig­
nificators, and not placed in the seventh,
fourth, or eighth houses.
The 3) in b in any aspect to T
? or d is evil
ELECTIONAL ASTROLOGY
for the beginner of any war, quarrel, lawsuit
or fight, and it is also adverse in 77$ or Vf.
I f in H or 2o, the 3) should be in trine to
or aspected by the benefics, for otherwise she
is not too favourable to the beginner. It is
best to start when the 3) is in good aspect to
the benefics, and free from affliction by the
malefics.
See that Fortuna is placed in one of the
houses relating to the side to be favoured,
namely, the ascendant, tenth, second, or
eleventh for one party, or the plaintiff in a
lawsuit; and the seventh, tenth, second, or
eleventh if the other side, or the defendant
in a lawsuit, is to win. Place Fortuna free
from affliction, especially by the lords of the
opponents’ houses, and if possible in good
aspect to the benefics.
Avoid cardinal signs on the ascendant (or
seventh) at the beginning of any controversy,
but if one must rise let it be 1$.
In electing a time to begin war or invade
any place, some authors say choose the day
and hour of 9 , or the O , and let the as­
cendant be free from all impediment or afflic-
170
WARS, FIGHTS, AND LAWSUITS
tion, and in a sign of long ascension. The
ascendant is best in i t , or in one of the signs
ruled by the major planets, and its lord and
the © should be strong and well placed, while
the lord o f the seventh should be debilitated.
I f the 2), T?, and 6 are joined together by
conjunction or aspect at the time of any
battle or fight there will be great mortality
and bloodshed.
In joining the army or setting out to fight
let the © , $ , or Caput be in the ascend­
ant, for this denotes safety. I f I? rises there
is danger of cowardice, while with 6 in the
ascendant there is risk of death or serious
wounding. I f both I? and 6 are rising the
danger of death is extreme, but if they are in
the tenth house the soldier will be taken pris­
oner, especially if the lord of the ascendant
is in the twelfth house. It is very danger­
ous to go into battle when the 2) is under the
Sunbeams, or with Cauda or the malefics.
B u yin g A rms and A m m u n it io n , Etc.
Let the 2) be in her house, exaltation or
fripftcrty, and in conjunction with cf if at
171
ELECTIONAL ASTROLOGY
the latter end of the month, or with 1? if at
the beginning’. Let the angles, or at least the
ascendant, be fixed, and in signs of long as­
cension. Place the and lord of the ascend­
ant in an angle, especially the tenth, oriental
and essentially strong, and let the 5) be in­
creasing in light and motion. Fortify 6 as
much as possible, and also the lord of the pre­
ceding New Moon, and let the 3) apply to a
benefic after leaving the conjunction of the
O . I f the lord of the ascendant cannot be
angular let him be entering an angle and in
aspect with the fourth cusp.

as for reconciling two people, as given in
Chapter X .
In suppressing rebels the ascendant denotes
the rebels and the general rules are the same
as for beginning war, making the seventh
house the victorious side. In addition, note
that the 2> must be in the opposite quarter
of the map from the lord of the ascendant.

retrograde, set out the instant they become
direct; if direct, the instant they are retro­
grade; if oriental, when they become occi­

if free when they become combust; or when
they change signs. If $ be in reception with
a beneiic in the map for the Vernal Equinox
the war will cease, at least for that year.
As the ascendant and denote the rebels,
it is not safe to start while these are strong;
nor is it safe for the rebels to move while
they are weak. If the enemy or rebels are
eastward, start when 6 is in the eastern
half of the map, and between the tenth degree
of b

thus placed let the 2) be there or in the tenth,

affliction. It is of great importance in all
planting and sowing that the }> be not only
uoafflicted, but essentially dignified and well
aspected, especially by the benefics. Also in
all planting and sowing operations debilitate
and do not let it be in the ascendant, tenth,
eleventh, fifth, second or third house nor in
aspect to the cusps of these houses, their
rulers, or the 3) and Fortuna and their dis-
positors.
Let the 2) be aspected by its dispositor out
of a watery sign, and if the ascendant is not a
fixed sign let the and lord of the ascendant,
or at least one of them, be oriental of the
Q and rising, for this causes the trees to
grow quickly and be fruitful. If they are
rising but not oriental the trees will grow
quickly, but fructify slowly, and therefore
the orientality is not an important considera­
tion in the case of such trees as do not bear
fruit. If the ascendant cannot be a fixed

nificators in mutable signs duly fortified. If

Planting and Sowing
The ground should be worked chiefly from

that is the best time for destroying weeds.

are
best for the sowing of seed that remains a

5 shouldbe in 25 or >5, but if it is in iY
1there
should be an aspect from a planet in 25 or one
of the other watery signs in order to prevent
the seed drying and withering. The 2) in 25
is particularly suitable for sowing all kinds
180
' AGRICULTURE AND GARDEN ^G ’
of pulse, turnips, potatoes, and 'r'ooi crops
generally.
In general, sowing should be begun within
a day or two after New Moon and while the
3) is increasing in light. It should not, how­
ever, be within iy° of the © , as this prevents
the seeds from thriving. If the 2) is increas­
ing in motion as well as light at the time
when sowing is begun it conduces to quicker
growth. If the ground is dry, or if the seed
is of a hot and dry nature sowing should be
begun in the increase of the 3) but near the
Full. On the other hand when the ground is
moist or the seed is of a moist nature it is
often better to sow in the decrease of the 3>.
In sowing peas and beans it is important for
the 3> to be decreasing in light and motion,
but especially in light, for if it is increasing,
and particularly if also in aspect to71 or 9
from airy or watery signs, the plants will
never cease blooming until they begin to
wither. It is said that peas and beans planted
exactly two days before Full Moon yield
twice as big a crop as a plant laid at any other
time. In the case of plants that grow up-
■ 181
ELECT10NAL ASTROLOGY
wards it is best to sow when the 3) is above
the horizon, but in the case of those that grow
underground the 3) should be below the hori­
zon.
Let the ascendant and its lord be in cardi­
nal signs or in 8 , Hfl, or sz,and let them, to­
gether with the 3), be aspected by the disposi-
tors of the 3) and lord of the ascendant, the
latter being also in cardinal signs, or if this is
impossible in mutable signs. Let the lord of
the ascendant be unafflicted and in good
aspect to the rising degree, which must itself
be free from the aspects of the malefics. See
that T?, which is a natural significator in land
work, is well placed in the map and in good
aspect to the 3), who should herself be dig­
nified; and take care that 6 is weak and in
no aspect either to the 3) or the ascendant.

Seeking F ugitives or Escaped
Prisoners
When beginning the search place the 2) in
the same degree as the O , but not within 17
minutes o f it. Let the 0 be weak and af­
flicted, in the last 15 degrees o f or the first
15 degrees o f Tib, or within 12 degrees before
one of the Moon’s nodes or 7 degrees after it.
I f these conditions cannot be fulfilled let the
luminaries be in the ascendant, or else let
them be in square or opposition to one an­
other, or in sextile or trine without recep­
tion, and weak by house. Or let the time be
within three days o f an eclipse or one day
after, but if possible let it be a lunar eclipse,
for the more the 3 is debilitated the less like­
lihood is there for the prisoner to escape.
Let the 3) be in conjunction or aspect with a
malefic, but take care that neither is in the
fourth house. Let the lord o f the ascendant
189
ELECTIONAL ASTROLOGY
be in conjunction or aspect with the lord of
the seventh, or put the lord o f the ascendant
in the seventh and the lord o f the seventh in
the ascendant. See that the T

Freeing Prisoners and Captives
The ascendant and its lord denote the per­
son to be freed; the tenth the person freeing
or who has the power to free. A malefic in
the ascendant at the time o f deliverance de­
notes imprisonment again. Therefore put a
benefic in the ascendant, and let the lord of
the ascendant be well dignified and free from
affliction by the mnlefics. I f possible let him
190

be in conjunction or good aspect with the
lord o f the tenth and received by him, as also
by the lord of the twelfth. I f possible put
the lord of the tenth in the twelfth or apply­

the twelfth be received by the lord o f the
tenth. Make the }) increasing in light and
motion and in aspect to the benefics. Let the
benefics to which the 2) is joined by conjunc­
tion or aspect be oriental and swift. See that
the 2> is not in the twelfth nor aspecting a
planet slow in motion. Also see that the
lord o f the twelfth is neither slow nor in con­
junction or aspect with planets except swift
and well-dignified ones. Dignify the © , and
fortify the tenth house and its lord, for if
these are impedited it signifies powerlessness
on the part o f the helpers.

I f possible put the O in £1 free from im­

sextile or trine with the planet having do­
minion by house or exaltation in the house
containing the © ; failing this they may be
in square but with reception. On no account
let them be in opposition, either with or with­
out reception. In the case o f the square, do
not let the aspect be thrown from a masculine
sign, and take care that the signs are ones in
which the © and the planet have some dig­
nity. Note any eclipse of either luminary or
any great conjunction that year, and see that
the sign in which the conjunction or eclipse
fell is not on the ascendant or tenth cusp.
Also keep the lords of these houses out of
such signs, and the lord o f such signs out of
the ascendant and tenth. Place both lumi­
naries in terms o f the benefics, aspecting

Let the angles all be fixed, especially the
ascendant and fourth, and let the lord of the
tenth be free from all impediment. Place the
lord of the ascendant either in the ascendant,
tenth, or eleventh house, or at least in the
fifth, received by the lord of the tenth. Let
the lord of the tenth be received by its dis-
positor by sextile or trine ; and the lord o f the
fourth be free from impediment and in good
aspect to the benefics. If all this cannot be
arranged let the 2) be received by the lord of
the tenth, and let the lord of the fourth be
free from impediment, taking care that the

latter is in no aspect with the ascendant or its
lord. If possible let some o f the benefics oc­
cupy or aspect the fourth or tenth"house or.,
at least one of them.
B uilding Castles and Cities
- A t the time of laying the foundation stone
fortify the ascendant and its lord, and the 3)
and Fortuna and their dispositors, and place
in the ascendant some fixed stars o f the na­
ture of % , © , $ , or ? , or of Tj if he is well
placed. This gives durability and continu­
ance.
Although aspects of T
? are to be avoided in
the building o f houses, in the case o f cities
(or castles) T
? should have power in the mid­
heaven and ascendant. Let the ascendant be
2 or H if possible, but in any case let it be
unaspected by 6 , and see that 6 is not in
conjunction or aspect with the 3), the lord of
the term o f the ascendant, or the lord o f the
hour. Let the lord o f the degree rising be
fortunate, direct, and swift in motion; and
the lord of the ascendant in exaltation or fa­
vourable sign, direct, and unafflicted. Place

the © in a sign of long ascension; and For-
tuna and its dispositor in favourable positions
and in good aspect with the 2), for this, to­
gether with the favourable positions o f %,
© , and 5 , regulates the goods, trade, and
riches o f the inhabitants. See that 3
is in no aspect with Fortuna, for any
aspect between them causes scarcity and
poverty. Fortify T
? as much as possible
and let it be in good aspect to 71, for that
gives long continuance, peace, and large
populations. It is important to see that $
has no connection with any significator, for
it brings much trouble to the inhabitants.
Therefore 6 must be debilitated as much as
possible and should be placed in a cadent
house, very weak and afflicted. Let 71 be
fortunately placed and elevated above S , and
also take care to strengthen the © , Fortuna,
and especially the 2)> for the stronger these
are the more fortunate will be the city and its
inhabitants. The 2) must be free from afflic­
tion, and it is important to see that it is not
in conjunction or opposition to the G or
placed between 15 and 15 fTL; nor must it
196

be combust, void o f course, in South latitude
becoming more southerly; in the end or be­
ginning or a sign; in its fall; unaspected by
its dispositor; in the sixth or twelfth houses;
or with either o f the nodes. It should be in­
creasing in light and motion; in North lati­
tude becoming more northerly; in exaltation
or in the exaltation of % ; and in an angle,
especially the ascendant or midheaven, with
If or $ not retrograde. The ascendant and
3) are favourably placed in 8 or TIJ; and
the is favourable in VJ if If is in the as­
cendant and the O by day or the 3)by night is
in the midheaven, for this shows durability
and prosperity.
B uilding Churches
A t the time o f laying the foundation stone
fortify the ascendant and its lord, the ninth
house and its lord, the planets in these
houses, the 3) and Fortuna and their disposi-
tors, and the planets in aspect with the 3).
Let % be in the ascendant, if possible in $
or X , but if this cannot be done let If be in
good aspect to the ascendant, especially in

trine, and in its own or a favourable sign
and fortunate house. Fortify the planet ex­
alted in the ascendant, the tenth house and its
lord, and as many of the significators men­
tioned above as possible.
B uilding Ships
W ar Ships. When beginning building
fortify the ascendant, its lord, the 3> and her
dispositor. Place them in the ascendant,
tenth or eleventh and let the rising sign, and
if possible the other angles also, be fixed.
Fortify the fourth house and its lord which
are natural significators of ships. Take care
that the 3) and other significators are swift
in motion if the ships are to be swift. Let
the planet from which the 3) last separated
be strong, well-disposed, and swift in motion,
or place the Moon's dispositor in a watery
sign free from all impediment or affliction.
If the 3) or lord o f the ascendant cannot be in
the ascendant put a benefic there free from
affliction from the malefics, and let it be
oriental if possible. Make the lord of the
seventh weak and slow in motion.
198

Merchant Ships. The same rules hold
good but in addition fortify $ , placing1him
in good aspect with the benefics, and if pos­
sible in the tenth, eleventh, or ascendant.
Fortify the lord of the second, Fortuna and
its dispositor. The 3) may be slow or swift
in motion as desired.
General R ules in Building or B uying
Ships
Let I f or $ be in the fourth in a watery
sign or a sign of their own nature, strong and
free from impediment, and if possible let the
ascendant or the 3> be in K . I f the 3) is not
in X place her in b , n , the beginning o f 2 5 ,
T
TJ, •?, or the latter degrees o f V?. Note that
the last half of V5 was accounted watery by
the ancients and the first half earthy.
Avoid afflictions to the significators from
t|/, and let that planet be strong and free
from impediment. See that the 5) is increas­
ing in light, motion, and latitude, and in
aspect with the benefics, and let the O be in
trine with the benefics. See that d is in no
aspect with the ascendant or j ) , fo r it de-

notes casualties by fire, and the burning of
the ship at the end. If the be in xx and
the O and <
$ are in evil aspect to her the
ship will suffer much damage by storm and
shipwreck. If the 3) is in a watery sign and
afflicted by the O and d the ship will be
wrecked and sunk with all hands. I f in a
fiery sign, she will be split upon a rode or
run aground and lose most of her goods. If
in a human sign, she will be ransacked and
sunk by pirates, and the crew and passengers
be slain. The influence o f d over ships is
very evil, but it is particularly bad in the as­
cendant, tenth, or eleventh house. Even a
fixed star of the nature of d is dangerous,
especially when afflicting the ascendant, for
it threatens that the ship will be destroyed by
fire.
Launching Ships
See that the 3) is essentially and acci­
dentally strong, well placed by house, well
aspected by % and $ , and free from afflic­
tion by the malefics. And if possible let the
200
PUBLIC AFFAIRS
ascendant, its lord, Fortuna and its dispositor
be similarly fortified.
Commencing V oyages
Let the ship sail when benefics are angular
or in the ninth house, preferably in the hours
o f % or $ , when the J) is in good aspect to
one or both o f these planets. The hours of
the © and ]> should be avoided. Take care
that neither the © nor }) is afflicted by 1?
and $ , and see that the raalefics do not oc­
cupy the third or ninth houses. Afflictions
from Cauda should also be avoided for they
show loss by deception. The ascendant
should not be a fiery sign, for that gives a
watery sign on the eighth cusp. Avoid plac­
ing T
2 in the ascendant, for that causes de­
lay and misfortunes. I f T
? rises in X a f­
flicted by 6 at the time o f sailing, the vessel
will be cast away.
For yachts and sailing ships the ascendant
when canvas is spread should be or in the
case of small boats or n in order to en­
sure a good, strong and steady wind.

Those most generally used in Electional As­
trology are the sextile and trine, whose influ­
ence is benefic or good ; the square and oppo­
sition, whose influence is malefic or bad; and
the conjunction which is variable, being good
between good planets and bad between bad
ones. The other aspects are of less impor­
tance, and to use them all tends to increasethe
difficulty of the work and cause confusion,
which often does more harm than the omis­
sion of the weak aspect.

The essential dignities are five in number,
namely, House, Exaltation, Triplicity, Term,
and Decanate, in this order of strength and
importance. The table on p. 210shows the
essential dignities of the planets in all the
signs.
Thus Aries is the house of 6 (or its ruler
is &
), and the exaltation of the © . The
triplicity ruler is the 0 by day, or in horo­
scopes where the © is above the horizon, and
IXby night, when the G is below the hori­
zon. The term or division from o° to 6° is
under the rule of If, from 70 to 140 is under
$ , from 150 to 210 under ÿ, from 220to

and it is receivedby $ and the 3) in all the
other dignities. A planet without any essen­
tial dignity in the sign and degree it occupies
is termed peregrine and is considered very
weak. The accidental dignities of any planet
are as follows:—Placed in between %and
$ ; in conjunction with the fixed star Regulus
in C

junction with Caput; in exact conjunction,
trine, or sextile with If or $ ; angular or in

fer to the position of a planet with respect to
the O. A planet is occidental when rising

when it is receding from them. The minor
planets # and 9 are oriental when they are
behind the © in the zodiac. The 3) is orien­
tal when passing from New to Full. The ©
itself is oriental when in the 4th, 5th, 6th,

P eregrin e. The position of a planet when
it is in a degree of a sign in which it has no
essential dignity. It is considered a very
weak position. See D

to be receivedby $ , the ruler of that sign.
Reception may be by any of the five essential
dignities, house, exaltation, triplicity, term,
or decanate, and its relative strength and im­
portance is in that order, reception by house
being better than by exaltation, and so on.
Reception by exaltation consists in a planet
occupying the exaltation sign of another.
Thus £ in 25 would be received by 'llwhich
is the exaltation ruler of that sign. In a
similar manner a planet is received by the
triplicity, term, and decanate rulers of the
sign or part of the sign in which it is placed.
M

a
lrecep
tionoccurs when each planet is
in a sign ruled by the other, as, for example,
<5 in H and $ in T . This is a strong and
fortunate position. Mutual reception may
also occur in any of the five dignities, but as
in the case of reception the importance de­
creases, mutual reception by house being the
strongest, and by decanate the weakest.

S ig n if ic a t o r s . The planets in a horo­
scope that rule or signify any particular mat­
ter, either on account o f their own nature,
or because o f their rulership over the house
to which the matter belongs. Thus $ is a
natural significator o f love affairs, and in any
horoscope the planet ruling the fifth house
would also be a significator of love affairs,
because such matters come under the ruler-
ship o f that house.
