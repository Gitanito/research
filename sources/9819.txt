Experience Description 8634 (SOBE)   

    I was 20 years old and had been sick for about a week. I was lying in bed when all four walls of the house fell away, until I was just sitting in my bed. Looking in the distance, I saw a light coming towards me. I ran into my brothers' bedroom to try and wake them up about what was happening but they wouldn't wake up. I ran back into my bedroom where the light was coming from and continued to look at it as it drew closer and closer to me. Looking at the light, I saw a staircase and a man walking down the staircase towards me. The man was the same man I had met when I was first born. 

  He introduced himself again to me as 'HeaTayaham.' He then took me by my hand at an extraordinary pace through a tunnel and then through the entire space and past every single planet that existed. Moving through space, he explained everything to me and wanted to show me everything he had ever created. He was downloading information to me regarding how it was made, how much time it took etc. This was all at an incredible pace that it was  hard to quantify. He then took me from the beginning of my life and all the way until the end of my life. He told me, 'Ask me anything you want to know.' I was so shaken because I didn't know what to ask. At this point I had studied the dead sea scrolls but found that the more I researched them. the more confused I became. So  I asked,  'What is the real truth?' He replied,  'You can ask me anything, but seeming you ask this I will leave you with something so that when you return you will not forget we have had this conversation. Nor will you doubt it.' What he had left me with was a language that I am able to communicate with him. He brought me back to my room where everything was as it was. He said, 'Remember. If you think you cannot reach me, use the language I have given you and I will respond.' 

  It took me a week until I was able to walk following this event. The pace through the universe was so intense, it made my legs numb and I couldn't walk. In the following months, I could hear a voice but in a language I was unable to understand. I could speak this language as well, but could not understand what I said. In order to learn the language, I started singing songs I knew from church as a child. I was able to put together what the words meant until I became fluent in it. I went to several linguists, scholars and professors through my life to share them the language but nobody had heard it before and did not believe that I was able to do this. So now, 40 years later, I have never returned to church because of too much controversy or to cause anyone anguish over what I was saying.  I began to write and whatever I asked about, I wrote down. To this day I have written over 1000 books that I have never published on a myriad of bible figures, including Jesus. To me these stories are the most interesting but in theory, I could ask and write about anyone. I stopped trying to convince people years ago because many people thought I was crazy.

      		Experience Description 8630 NDE   

    I had an experience  the evening that I was born. Instead of being born, I remember flying through the universe and past all the planets. I  learned everything about how the earth and planets were created. Just by looking at something, I was able to learn about its creation and everything there was to know about that particular thing. Next, I remember floating over the hospital room.  I saw my mother below with a nurse. My mother was in excruciating labor pain and it was her screaming that drew in a nurse to the room. My mother was frantically talking to the nurse, but I could not understand what they were saying. Sitting next to me, was God. He was telling me about what was happening down below. God told me  that the nurse was drawn to my mother because she was screaming while talking. At this point, the doctors took over and declared me dead. 

  My mother, hysterically started talking to the nurses in their own non-English native language. My mother, told the nurse that a son would be born who would bring the word of God for all to hear. At this point, I entered my body. The conversation continued between the Nurse and my mother, where the nurse continued to ask my mother more about this boy. The nurse said to my mother 'I want to know more about this boy you kept talking about.' My mother was  holding me and said to the nurse, 'I don't know what you are talking about.' The nurse reminded my mother of the words she had spoken in her native tongue. My mother, confused as she did not speak this language. She  thought the nurse was talking about Jesus. She told the nurse to go to church if she wanted to learn more about him.
  


    E-mail from Dr. Jeff: 

   I am delighted that you were able to share your experience after 60 years.  Pasted below is the narrative description of your experience that you shared.  I have several questions that I would appreciate your answering if you would/could.  If I understand what you shared, you were declared dead at the time of childbirth.  At this time, your mother talked to the nurse in the nurse’s non-English native language (guessing Spanish given this experience happened in San Diego).  When the nurse shared back to your mother what your mother said in the nurse’s native language (a language that your mother did not know) your mother did not know what the nurse was saying and your mother did not recognize what she previously told the nurse.  Importantly “My mother, told her that a son would be born who would bring the word of God for all to hear.”  

    Did your mother ever comment on your delivery?  At what point were you found to be alive?  Any further details that you could provide would be appreciated.  Thanks again for sharing!  

  Fred's Reply Email:  

    My mother's language is native Hawaiian.  

  I recently asked my mother about this experience. I repeated exactly the same story below detailing out the whole experience. My mother said there was no way I could have ever know about this experience.  She had never told anyone until she confirmed my story last week. The reason she never told anyone is because she was waiting to see if a child was born who would share the word of God. She thought the experience was so crazy no one would ever believe her.   

  For your second question: I was declared dead for two minutes. The doctors tried to resuscitate me and after two minutes I took my first breath.
