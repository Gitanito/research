Sidgwick, Eleanor. ON THE EVIDENCE FOR PREMONITIONS,&nbsp;Proceedings&nbsp;5, 1889, pp. 288-354.&nbsp;Sidgwick considers a class of anecdotal evidence gathered by the Society which is suggestive of precognition, if not in her view as convincing as the evidence of telepathy. About two thirds of the material is dreams and the remainder various kinds of hallucination. The character of apparitional cases is similar to that of crisis apparitions, with the added element that the event perceived is some hours or days in the future. Headings include: recognised apparitions (293), unrecognised apparitions (300), symbolic visual hallucinations (302), precognition of sounds (305), symbolic sounds (306), general discussion of dreams (311), recognition of dream scenery (314), dreams foreshadowing deaths (317), dreams of accidents (332), dreams of trivial incidents (343), symbolic dreams (351).&nbsp;spontaneous psi/precognition/apparitions/hallucinations/dreams

Sidgwick, Eleanor. ON THE EVIDENCE FOR CLAIRVOYANCE,&nbsp;Proceedings&nbsp;7, 1891, pp. 30-99.&nbsp;Documents several cases in which subjects become telepathically aware, through dreams or hallucinations, of accidents, deaths and other objective facts. Includes the ‘Wilmot’ case, discussed by commentators to the present day, in which a woman felt herself to be transported to the side of her sleeping husband aboard a ship on a transatlantic crossing. Independently her husband dreamed that she entered his cabin and caressed him and, when he woke, a man sharing his cabin remarked that he was ‘a pretty fellow to have a lady come and visit you in this way.’ Reports of amateur experiments involving a hypnotized subject are also given, in which the subject seemed to become aware of facts she could not normally have known. Telepathy is indicated in some cases, but there are several in which the facts were not known, or known inaccurately by other people involved, and were given correctly by the subject.

Myers, Frederic W.H. THE SUBLIMINAL SELF: CHAPTER 8 - THE RELATION OF SUPERNORMAL PHENOMENA TO TIME RETROCOGNITION AND PRECOGNITION,Proceedings&nbsp;11, 1895, pp. 334-593.&nbsp;Six years have elapsed since Eleanor Sidgwick’s paper inProceedings&nbsp;5 ‘On the evidence for Premonitions’, in which time twice as much anecdotal material has been assembled as she had available to her. Myers offers some reflections, followed by anecdotal cases. A priest hears the first lines of a letter spoken to him hours before he receives it in the post (346); a woman describes the sensation of being a child again and calling out to her sister at night, and receives a letter from her sister saying she had been awakened the night before by the sound of her name being called (355); a man dreams he is involved in a train accident that causes a fatality, and later finds the details confirmed in an actual accident that happened at the same time (370); a man in a light sleep dreams of an accident to a diver in a harbour, which corresponds with an actual accident (378); a dentist working on the manufacture of false teeth obeys the command of an unseen voice to run to the window, narrowly escaping injury when his chemical apparatus explodes (424); a man dreams he makes a business visit and is asked to look at a number of photographic transparencies, an event which takes place in reality unexpectedly some days later (458); etc. SUMMARY &amp; DISCUSSION,Journal&nbsp;7, 1895, pp. 82-5.&nbsp;spontaneous psi/precognition/telepathy/dreams

REPORT ON CASES OF APPARENT PRECOGNITION,&nbsp;Proceedings&nbsp;42, 1934, pp. 49-103.&nbsp;A total of 349 cases of ostensible precognition reported in the Society’s records are classified and analysed. The majority are found to be in dreams (136), followed by hallucination (87), mediumship (62) and impression (51). A few borderland (hypnagogic) and crystal gazing cases are also reported. Of the dream cases, 76 are reported to be highly evidential and 40 significantly so. Hallucinations are 17 and 45 respectively, mediumship 20 and 31, and impressions 14 and 25 (see table on page 51). The most numerous of the incidents foreseen is death, mainly natural but also accidental, followed closely by incidents classed as trivial. The author discusses the character of the material and suggests that quantum theory may be the key to understanding the space-time principle that makes precognition possible. An index of the cases is included. CORRESPONDENCE,&nbsp;Journal&nbsp;28, 1934, pp. 204-6, 219-23, 240-44, 259-61.&nbsp;spontaneous psi/precognition

Green, Celia. ANALYSIS OF SPONTANEOUS CASES,&nbsp;Proceedings&nbsp;53, 1960, pp. 97-161.&nbsp;A study of some 300 spontaneous cases containing enough detail to be worth analysis. Green describes how they were examined and the criteria used to determine their evidential value. Each is broken down into its constituent elements, such as age of percipient and the type of ESP represented, to determine what factors are reported most frequently. Actual cases are provided to illustrate the kind of material analysed. Green concludes that the study is primarily of value for its suggestiveness, and for hints about how to conduct further studies.&nbsp;Appendices provide figures and graphs, also a summary of cases.&nbsp;In one, a young office worker dreams that the sister of a co-worker appears to be distressed and notes next to her the date on his desk calendar, set to April 1.

Lambert, is the record of a dream of a subway accident that was received by the Society the day before a similar accident occurred. The second by G. Zorab, recounts a detailed dream of a house that closely corresponded in appearance and situation to an actual house that the percipient’s mother would move into some five months later.

Heywood, Rosalind. AN APPARENTLY TELEPATHIC DREAM,&nbsp;Journal&nbsp;43, 1966, pp. 252-5.An account of a possibly telepathic dream in which a father, a sceptic regarding all things paranormal, dreamed that his eldest daughter was gasping and choking for air. The next day he learned from press reports that his daughter had been nearly drowned. To the investigator the man’s experience would not be evidential, for dreams are too frequent to be good evidence and he did not mention it before hearing of the corresponding event. But the author cites the case as an illustration of how many sceptics have had their attitudes modified by personal experiences which they would not credit if reported by another person.&nbsp;(PsiLine)&nbsp;spontaneous psi/precognition/dreams

Barker, J.C. PREMONITIONS OF THE ABERFAN DISASTER,&nbsp;Journal&nbsp;44, 1967, pp. 169-81.The Aberfan disaster - in which an avalanche of coal slid down a mountainside onto the Welsh mining village of Aberfan killing 144 persons, 128 of whom were schoolchildren - was such an unusual calamity that the author thought it would provide an excellent opportunity to investigate precognition. He appealed through the media for persons claiming any foreknowledge of the event to communicate with him and describe their experiences. Of the answers received, 35 contained sufficient detail to warrant analysis. These ranged from vague prognostications of doom involving dead or dying children to astonishingly accurate pictorial impressions of screaming children buried by an avalanche of coal in a Welsh mining village. In 21 of the cases there is evidence that the experience occurred before the percipient learned of the disaster normally. The author discusses the cases in the light of the several criteria necessary to establish a connection between a precognitive experience and a future event. Concludes that the evidence for precognition presented in this study is prima facie only, and recommends that a central registry for premonitions be established so that researchers will no longer have to wait until after the event.&nbsp;(PsiLine)&nbsp;spontaneous psi/precognition

Beloff, John. A NOTE ON AN OSTENSIBLY PRECOGNITIVE DREAM,&nbsp;Journal&nbsp;47, 1973, pp. 217-21.&nbsp;Presents evidence and analysis of a precognitive dream case. The case is not evidentially strong but is considered to have some interesting features. The dream report and subsequent evidence is reviewed. The subject’s dream contained the name of a dead man (unfamiliar to her) whose wife’s maiden name was her married name; the name of a disease the subject later contracted; and a character who might be interpreted to represent the subject’s doctor. Analysis showed that the dream representation reversed the disease with the man’s name, an example of a dream displacement. Coincidence is dismissed as not offering a satisfactory explanation.&nbsp;(PsiLine)&nbsp;spontaneous psi/precognition/dreams

Nisbet, Brian C. AN OSTENSIBLE CASE OF PRECOGNITION,&nbsp;Journal&nbsp;49, 1977, pp. 608-11.&nbsp;On 8th September 1975, Mrs. Lickiss, a qualified social worker, aged 50, of 3 Highfield, Sutton, Hull, North Humberside, wrote to the Society for Psychical Research describing a symbolic dream of the death of a man, a Mr. G, whom she had not seen for about 16 years. She had this dream on the night of 9th April 1975 and, on waking the following morning, told her husband. That morning she drove her car to visit a friend and during her drive was surprised to recognize the man of her dream driving another car. She told her friend, Mrs. F (who had known Mr. G) of her dream and of having seen Mr. Gin the car. Mrs. Lickiss then continued on her calls for the day. On returning home she found a message asking her to telephone Mrs. F. She did so and was told that Mr. G had apparently continued in his car to the centre of the town but, while stopping at some traffic lights, had had a heart attack and died there and then.(PsiLine)&nbsp;CORRESPONDENCE, p. 686.&nbsp;spontaneous psi/precognition/dreams

Beloff, John. A NOTE ON A PUTATIVELY PRECOGNITIVE DISASTER DREAM,&nbsp;Journal&nbsp;49, 1978, pp. 854-57.&nbsp;Beloff writes: The subject in this case is a Mrs. Kathleen Preston, a retired schoolteacher and amateur folklorist (author of Tales Of Old Kendal), who lives in Kendal, Westmorland. This lady has corresponded with me for many years and has often sent me accounts both of dreams which she thought might turn out to be precognitive and of miscellaneous ESP experiences within the family circle. I have also met her on one occasion in Edinburgh. Although her accounts were of some parapsychological interest, they were connected for the most part with the small change of everyday life, often with television programs viewed by the subject on the following day, and accordingly, there was little scope for obtaining independent confirmation of the facts even if it had been worth doing so. The present case, however, which relates to a well publicized disaster, is very different.(PsiLine)&nbsp;spontaneous psi/dreams/precognition

Wood-Trost, Lucille. POSSIBLE PRECOGNITION OF THE TETON DAM DISASTER IN IDAHO,&nbsp;Journal&nbsp;51, 1981, pp. 65-74.&nbsp;Wood-Trost outlines an investigation into possible precognitions of the bursting of the Teton Dam in 1976 and subsequent flooding of a large area of Eastern Idaho. After a brief description of her method of collection, Wood-Trost summarizes 18 individual cases of varying types (dreams, intuitions, etc.), time of experience relative to event (from a few moments to a year), and varying detail (from vague premonition to dreams containing one or more specific and veridical details). The author discusses the demographics of her experiencers and the phenomenology of the cases as well as their relationship to similar cases collected in 1967 after the Aberfan disaster in Wales by J.C. Barker and to general characteristics of L.E. Rhine’s collection. She compares time lapses between experiences and events to current thinking on likely clustering of precognition relative to time of the event. In addition, she discusses possible normal explanations, among them subliminal awareness of clues pointing to the disaster and first or second-hand&nbsp; technical knowledge of the dam’s construction and likelihood of failure.&nbsp;(PsiLine)&nbsp;spontaneous psi/dreams/precognition

SUBMARINE ARTEMIS IN 1971,&nbsp;Journal&nbsp;51, 1982, pp. 283-7.&nbsp;Author’s abstract: An ostensible precognition of the accidental sinking in harbour of the submarine H.M.S. Artemis in 1971 is reported. A fortnight before the incident, the female percipient (then aged 17) had met some of the crew at a dance when the vessel visited Grimsby, and had become friendly with one submariner. She had a dream a week before the incident in which she saw the submarine sink, in harbour. In the dream, she ‘knew’ that three men were trapped inside, that two of them were men she had met, and that two of the men would die. The percipient related the dream to several persons over the next few days. On July 1, 1971 the submarine did sink in Gosport harbour, and three men were trapped inside for 101/2 hours. There were no fatalities though. The percipient knew two of the trapped men, but they were not the two she had named. Personality and background information about the percipient is given for use in future comparative studies.&nbsp;spontaneous psi/dreams/precognition

Hearne, Keith M.T. THREE CASES OF OSTENSIBLE PRECOGNITION FROM A SINGLE PERCIPIENT: 1. SADAT ASSASSINATION. 2. REAGAN ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT. 3. S.S. ACHILLE LAURO INCIDENT,&nbsp;Journal&nbsp;51, 1982, pp. 288-91.&nbsp;Author’s abstract: Three seemingly premonitory dreams reported by a female percipient were investigated. Two sisters and a friend provided confirmation of the dream accounts and their occurrence before the actual events. A dream of an assassination in a Middle East country was remarkably similar to the killing of President Sadat of Egypt, three weeks later. Another dream described the shooting of a ‘pockmarked actor,’ while getting out of a car, by a ‘German S.S. man.’ President Reagan (former actor) was shot by John W. Hinckley (former member of a neo-Nazi group) three weeks later. In another dream three weeks before the fire on board the liner Achille Lauro, the percipient saw two coffins on that ship. Two passengers died in the fire and another was lost overboard. Aspects of the ostensible precognitions are discussed. Personality and background information about the percipient is provided.&nbsp;spontaneous psi/dreams/precognition

Pablos, Fernando de. SPONTANEOUS PRECOGNITION DURING DREAMS: ANALYSIS OF A ONE-YEAR NATURALISTIC STUDY,&nbsp;Journal&nbsp;62, 1998, pp. 423-34.&nbsp;Author’s abstract: The author has undertaken an analysis of his own dreams in order to discover spontaneous precognition. The dreams occurring during the calendar years January-December 1996 were investigated. A total of 223 dreams were registered during that period. Out of these, 23 dreams were considered precognitive by explicit criteria previously determined. Brief reports of the dreams and of the precognized events are given. Out of the 23 dreams, in 14 (60.80%) the precognized event occurred within 24 hours after the dream, in 5 (21.74%) the precognized event occurred within two weeks after the dream and in 4 (17.34%) the precognized event occurred within two and a half months after the dream. An analysis of the phenomenological characteristics of precognitive dreams allows us to classify them into two broad categories: realistic and analogical/realistic. A particular emphasis was made in analysing the phenomenological and psychological characteristics of precognized events. Most precognized events were unexpected, sudden and anxiety-provoking events which tend to disrupt the attentional process in the subject. Roughly half of precognized events were under volitional control of other people and the other half could be explained by chance occurrence. We found no case of a precognized event under the possible volitional control of the subject.&nbsp;spontaneous psi/precognition/dreams            			  			     			This page was last updated on: May 28, 2023   			 			                                               	       Search form        Search                   Article Information           	Author: The Society for Psychical Research Word count: 5,800 Created: 22nd August 2016 Last updated: 28th May 2023 May be cited as:Society for Psychical Research, T.
