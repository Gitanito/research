This message will be a revelation
of great importance to every American
interested in the ideals, hopes and
aspirations of the founders of the United
, states. It will be found especially in-
teresting to those who have· wondered
abou t the outcome of tb .e present world
conditions and the future of the Ameri-
can people.
To say that the early American
founders did not dream of establishing a
republic that would endure and eventually
grow into the ideal state of the Golden
Rule would not do them justice nor would
it. display an understanding of human na-
ture. Any close student of man or his-
tory knows that man has always . dreamed.
of living someday in a Golden Haven of
Peace, a Shangri-La. With out the belief
that such a kingdom wil l eventually
arise man would have little incentive to
pioneer strange lands, build cities and
esta blish law and order to ~ttain great-
er civilized privilege s.
There is much evidence, but greatly
grossed over, that our nation was found-
ed around t~1is ideal. And it is quite
evident that t he founders were inspired
by their vision of a Golden Age in which
. infinite ju stice would rule, and from
this vision formed a governmental plan
to serve as a foundation upon which a
higher civilization could mat erialize.

The _
most vital symbol to 1Js now is
the unfinished pyramid of thirteen steps
or stages. In the original de~ign it
was intended for thirteen stones to be
shown in each ste p . If we multiply
thirteen by thirtee11. we have · one hundred
and sixty nine. The beginning of this
nation was 177 6; add 169 to 1776 and we
have 1945, the year when this nation
will h av e reached as hi gh as it can go
under the old order. In 1945 .America
will be confronted with grave decisions~
On the outcome rests t he fate of the na-
tion. It will either fall into oblivio:.:i
through materi a lism or ascend to the
triangle sus pe nd ed above in which shin es
the Li ght of Hoa, the Anc i ent of Dnvs.
If t his h a ppens the,n a great sph~j _tual

THE CiREAT
AMERICAN EAGLE
=0=
The Ea gle was my s tically ch osen to
represent the formation of our democratic
li fe . In the Ancient l eg ends the eagle
is the mat erial r ep resentative of the
s piritu al bird, the Phoentx, t he symbol
of Immort"E
•.
l Life. In the Great Seal of
the U.S.A . we find the eagle represent-
in e this li fe , as the carrier of the
banners of Pea ce, Power, Uni t y and Lib-
erty into the Age of' Universal Hap piness.
The spreading wings of the eagle
represents the life of the American
Sp i r it. They are so sho wn to represent
that the sole purpose of t he e ag le is,
that it shall fly, when the pro pe r time
come s, from t he old or der into a new.
The ea gl e wear s an escutcheoned
shiel d, upon which is the insi gna of his
ne w b irth. The thirteen bar~ on the
shield represen t s the t h irteen Original
Colo ni es, and i n the ir Uni on t he life of
lhe e ag le begaD.

th e Spi rit of Lif e mi ght gro w. In his
left claw he clasps a bunch of arro ws, B
symbol of power in ~ar, which he wi~l ds
to protec t the weak Urn.t they m:
i.ght gro F
and become strong. Th~re are t td rte en
-11-
arrows arid thirteen l~aves on the olive
branch. °Thus it is shown that there
will be thirteen times thirteen periods
(years) · of time in which the New Repub-
li~ must grow before ent~ring j_nfo the
Greater Life.
The white head nn d the nin e white
feathers in t he eagles ta il are symbolic
of tne ten Sephiroth _of the Anc:L8nt 'Kab-
balistic i.rJisdom represe1:it:tng the Spir:..
itual Tree of Life. The nine feathers
:r:'ep:resents the formulatj _

telligenc ·e which shall guide the Repub-
lic through the V:·drteen stages of its
growth and preparat:i.on for th~ Spi.ri tual
