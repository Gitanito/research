  		              		Experience Description   

    No one is really sure how my condition came about.  I think that LSD was the reason for my hospitalization.
  
  Two days prior to being sent to the Hospital by my physician, I was partying with friends.  I think I took a small amount of LSD; it was the second and final time.   The next day, I went to school as normal and went through the whole day without any problems.    When I got home from school, I started feeling very wheezy, which lead me to vomiting all night.  The next morning, I was blind and was still vomiting.  By blind, I mean  that if the rooms walls were painted white, that is all I saw, was a white.   If the room was painted blue, that is all I saw was a blue.   I could not make out any details or even tell where the walls or furniture were.    
  
  That morning, my mother brought me to my physician who then ordered us to the hospital.  I  continued to vomit along the way.

  The Hospital first brought me up to the children's ward, but when a doctor realized the extent of my condition, he changed the order to the ICU (Intensive Care Unit).  While in ICU, my blood pressure went as high as 180/210.  The doctors and nurses were frantically attempting to lower my Blood Pressure.   I do not know the exact time my incident happened.  I think it in the late afternoon of the first day.
  
  I remember leaving my body and  rising up to the ceiling of the room. I saw the whole room and everyone working on me from the ceiling of the room.  I was watching  the heart monitor machine and saw  that my heart had flat-lined. I saw that the hospital staff were trying to get my heart to start again.
  
  Then I went into a winding, curving tunnel.  I felt  no pain, only complete calmness.  My whole life passed by me while I was traveling down this tunnel.   It went very rapidly at first.  Then some moments were slowed down.   Everything was being shown to me;  everyone I helped and everyone I hurt.  Then a small pinhole light appeared at the end of the tunnel.   As I got  closer to it, the light got bigger and bigger.   It was a brilliant white color, but not blinding. There was  a warm, loving feeling coming from it.  I could not make out what it was though.   As I got closer to the light, a figure of a person started to emerge.   The closer I got, the clearer the image got.  It was Jesus Christ.   As I got to the end of the tunnel, I was stopped by Jesus, who said 'It's not your time.' Then he reached his hand out and pushed me back to Earth. 
  
  I was back in my body.  My heart was beating and I could sense the doctors were all relieved, but I cannot remember much after that point.  My sight came back on the third day in the hospital.

  What was your religion prior to your experience?      Christian- Catholic   At age 17 I was attending a Catholic High School.    However, at this age, I fell away from the church and was not regularly practicing or worshipping.  
  
  Have your religious practices changed since your experience?         Yes     My belief in the existence of a God made me  stronger.  
  
What importance do you place on your religious/spiritual life after your experience?         Moderately important to me  

  What is your religion now?         Christian- Catholic   My current belief being the same. My parents had nothing to do with the influence of my religious choices.  For over 30 years I questioned my faith.   I read about many religions  and visited or participated in several faiths; not on a regular basis though.   My father's passing in 2011 was a surreal experience for me in multiple ways.  It eventually lead me to book he was reading on Fr. Solanus Casey.  That book struck my curiosity like never before.  I ended up researching the Catholic History in depth.  I fell in love breadth and color of the church, that I eventually made a local Catholic church my home church.  That certainty does not mean I agree with all that they preach.  
  
  Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was both consistent and not consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience.

  Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         Yes     For me, I think it is occurring in stages over my lifetime.   I am more spiritual and religious than I was before the event, but it occurred over decades.  However, as I age, that experience seems to be flirting and reminding me more often. I never touched another hard drug after that day.
  
  Did you seem to encounter a mystical being or presence, or hear an unidentifiable voice?         I encountered a definite being, or a voice clearly of mystical or unearthly origin   For me, it felt  and looked like Jesus Christ.  
  
Did you see deceased or religious spirits?         I actually saw them

During your experience, did you gain information about universal connection or oneness?         Yes       

Did you believe in the existence of God prior to your experience?         I was uncertain if God exists  

During your experience, did you gain information about the existence of God?         Yes         

Do you believe in the existence of God after your experience?         God definitely exists  

Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:       

  During your experience, did you gain special knowledge or information about your purpose?      Uncertain   I don't understand the question.  
  
Did you believe that our earthly lives Are meaningful and significant prior to your experience?         Unknown  

During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?         No       

Did you believe in an afterlife prior to your experience?         I was uncertain if an afterlife exists  

Do you believe in an afterlife after your experience?         An afterlife definitely exists     Yes     I was stopped at the end of the tunnel.    I could sense some type of vast space was right beyond where I was stopped.  

Did you fear death prior to your experience?         I slightly feared death  

Do you fear death after your experience?         I do not fear death  

Were you fearful living your life prior to your experience?         Unknown  

Were you fearful living your life after your experience?         Slightly fearful in living my earthly life  

Did you believe that our earthly lives Are meaningful and significant prior to your experience?         Unknown

During your experience, did you gain information about love?         No       

Were you compassionate after your experience?         Moderately compassionate toward others  

  What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         Slight changes in my life.     I was more open to listening and believing people's experience than I was before that event.  I think my intuition increased. I became much more patient with people than I was prior to the incident.  
  
Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          Yes I stopped hanging around with the people I hung around prior to the event, and most of my relationships changed.  

After the NDE:       

  Was the experience difficult to express in words?   No.     
  
How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.    

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         Uncertain     Maybe.  I think my intuition and clairvoyance has increased due that event.   Have tested it out periodically.  I found my Indian Heritage birth place solely on a spiritual vision quest.  I went into with much skepticism, and was blown away when I found it.  

Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          I don't know.  I guess...knowing you are one of very few people that get to experience this.  

  Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    I never talked about it with many people in the past 10 years, until it feels like something is urging me to talk about it.  More due to fears of being called a crazy or being sent to mental ward.

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       No     

  What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real.     It eclipsed every fiber of my being.  How could I  see it as anything other than  real?  
  
  What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real.     My memory is outstanding.  It is above the norm of a society.  That event, seems to stick in my mind more prominently than other events.   As I get older, that experience seems to be urging me to talk about it.  
  
At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       No     

  Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?         I do not have  enough knowledge to comment at this time.
