my name is Robert M wood and I go by dr.
Bob these days I have a degree in
aeronautical engineering from the
University of Colorado and then I
subsequently got a PhD in physics from
Cornell and I went right into McDonnell
Douglas as a young engineer and stayed
with McDonnell Douglas for 43 years
graduating basically through the various
management steps and wound up in charge
of various aspects of our research and
development programs including the last
one was the space station program so
that&#39;s my background
you
during my career McDonnell Douglas in
the late 60s there was quite a bit of
publicly exposed information about
various possible UFO events one day when
I was just doing my normal job
supporting my boss he said you know
general Schreiber is retiring and our
general Schreiber was the guy who
invented the ICBM and the Air Force why
do they have a sort of a testimonial
event symposium for him and each of the
contractors including us got an
assignment to predict what the future
would hold in the next 10 years and so
our assignment was to talk about going
to space and back and so I knew my boss
was really oriented towards nuclear
propulsion and if I didn&#39;t tell him
otherwise he was going to talk about
nuclear propulsion everybody was tired
of hearing about nuclear propulsion so I
said well gee ray why don&#39;t you tell him
about how the UFOs allegedly do it and
he said that&#39;s a great idea why don&#39;t
you work that out so I read my first
book which was Donald Mills Menzel&#39;s
book and after I read that book I told
my wife it said this guy&#39;s a allegedly a
scientist but he&#39;s not talking logically
he&#39;s ignoring the data and so I read
another book and pretty soon I&#39;d read
about 50 books and at that time I became
interested in subscribing to the various
journals and met Jim McDonald now there
were two interesting aspects that fell
out of this meeting with Jim McDonald
one of them was that he kind of
convinced me that I had a story that I
could tell to my management since since
I concluded that the UFOs were real one
one day when I was driving to work I
said wow there&#39;s no other solution
they&#39;re clearly real they&#39;re clearly
extraterrestrial and they work somehow
and I think we got to figure out how
they work because I wouldn&#39;t want to be
the last aerospace company to discover
gravity control I think we ought to be
the first so I took a briefing to my
management and my management was very
sympathetic at that particular time for
for some new creative ideas they didn&#39;t
have much of a basic research program
and I offered a very modest project to
look into this problem so we did some
things like
seeing whether we could train change the
speed of light by a large axonal
magnetic field and we hired Stan
Freedman actually to use the UFO
literature as a basis for clues as to
what technology might be involved so
that was that was this project was
underway and Jim McDonald became aware
of the fact that there was a symposium
about to happen in Boston that Philip
Morrison and Carl Sagan were organizing
on UFOs so he apparently planted the
seed and Sagan&#39;s ear and said you know
there&#39;s a group of McDonnell Douglas who
study in UFOs you might want to give
them a call and see if they want to
participate well I had just finished
reading Carl Sagan&#39;s wonderful book
intelligent life in the universe written
in about 1966 and had a tremendous
respect for the ideas that I had seen
there which included the serious
consideration for extraterrestrial life
and so Carl called one day and
introduced himself and I was honored of
course because you know he was clearly
more outranking than I was in terms of
his profession at that time and and he
said I understand that you might be
doing some work and what would you want
to talk about if we were asked to give a
paper and I said well Carl one thing I
wouldn&#39;t want to do is what everybody
else has probably gone to and they would
try to prove that the real I said it&#39;s
very clear to anybody who studies at all
that their extraterrestrial and the most
important things to figure out how they
work so I would give a paper discussing
the different avenues that one could
explore in order to figure out how they
worked and it was long silence on the
phone have you never invited me to give
the paper so at that I did however
attend the conference anyway and heard
everybody else who was there and
realized that at that time I began to
ask myself is there some plan to control
this process it was just a sort of a
subconscious thought that I had in my
mind and I didn&#39;t really do much with
more with it then so that&#39;s two stories
that relate to my career now there was
there is a third story relating to my
career which is much more subtle it had
to do with classified work
the classified program that I was
working on was at the codeword level and
in it actually had had very simply to do
with since I was working on our
ballistic missile defense program it&#39;s
very common for intelligence agencies
like the CIA to ask contractors who have
an expertise in one area to study the
enemy&#39;s expertise in that same area and
so this program was to study the Soviet
ballistic missile defense program and
and that fact I think is actually
unclassified now the name of the program
might be classified in association with
it but so as I became familiar with the
program it was pretty interesting as you
may know when you get cleared for one of
these classified programs you were your
special badge and you know you can talk
to anybody who&#39;s in the room with a lot
of candor and it feels like there&#39;s one
psychological group and there&#39;s a lot of
camaraderie that builds up but one of
and they have access to special
libraries so one of the things that we
could do was to go up to the library
that the Air Force ran and sort of paw
through top-secret material so since I
was interested in UFOs I had some usual
business to take care of and I&#39;d also
kind of look in their library to see
what they had on that subject and for
for about a year I was getting quite a
few hits on the subject about various
reports and then all of a sudden the
whole subject material vanished
it is the entire classification America
classification for the subjects it has
just vanished
and the librarian in our group that I
was working with said you know he&#39;d been
in this business for 20 years he was
he&#39;s about 40 years old but he&#39;d been in
that vault for 20 years and knew exactly
how things normally were done and he
said this is remarkable
he said I&#39;ve ever seen that before you
just don&#39;t have a whole subject vanish
out from under said I think there is
something there
you know he said you know you ought to
go see the Condon committee and tell
them what you&#39;re doing there you&#39;ve got
some some good stuff and you got a good
plan and and so I I did I wrote him a
nice little letter and saying that our
our company had been looking into the
subject of UFOs and did they want to
hear what we were doing and so I got a
courteous invitation back from from
Condon and we prepared a little briefing
that explained how explained how you
could take a toroidal loop of
superconducting material and establish a
strong magnetic field in one direction
and then charge it at the same time so
it could float in the electrostatic
field of the earth and the bottom line
that I had was that we were just about a
factor of ten away from having
superconducting current capacity enough
to do this now of course our team
thought well gee only a factor of ten
we&#39;re going to be there at a couple of
years the continents lack of interest in
the subject and in quite in the contrast
to his group his compound is grouped
together who sat around and listened to
our briefing and and then when he said
well therefore you can&#39;t do it they all
looked at him in amazement and said well
but it&#39;s only a factor of ten yeah and
so I became friendly with several of
them Roy Craig and a couple of others
and I concluded that this was not an
objective study so I wrote a letter to
Condon suggesting that it might be
helpful if he would establish his group
in two parts and have one the believers
in one of this believer ISM that was up
good work with their angles and said I&#39;m
taking the liberty you&#39;re sending this
copy this letter to every member of your
group whose addresses hydrous received
from them privately and he was so
furious at that that he called up james
s mcdonnell who was at that time the the
chairman of the newly merged Douglas and
McDonald
aircraft companies and tried to get me
fired
really I found this out three years
later from my boss who apparently number
one reported that McDonald said I don&#39;t
like other people meddling in my
business so that was nice to hear from
the CEO Eddie and he asked the usual
questions well what did he do and he
answers you wrote a letter and he wrote
a letter that had been approved through
my management because that him that&#39;s
what I did and and so my management
backed me up he backed me up and and I
did never learn of this - about three
years later that my career was you know
practically gone so the head of the Air
Force conning Committee tried to get you
fired
Conda - Condon purse - yeah yeah right
personally tried edition fire right at
the meantime there was one other thing
that came about as a result of my
association with Jim McDonald and and
that was we had become quite quite
friendly I like the guy he was really an
energetic physicist and and wouldn&#39;t let
any grass grow under his feet when he
when he got a case he would dig his
teeth into it and present the
overwhelmingly convincing story to
professional societies and he would talk
to the American Institute of Aeronautics
and Astronautics in the American
Physical Society and I happened to be
members of both so whenever he was in
town I would pick him up as score to
make sure that he felt welcome and so
once when I was traveling through Tucson
where he lived I stopped I had a like a
two-hour layover and to catch an
airplane he came out to the airport to
have a beer with me and so CY you know
what what&#39;s what&#39;s new Jim and he said
well he says I think I got it
I said what what do you think he got he
said I think I got the answer I said
well what is it he said I can&#39;t tell you
yet I got to be sure and it was six
weeks after that that he&#39;s tried to
shoot himself and you know a couple
months after that that he finally
finally died knowing what I think I now
suspect about the skills of our
counterintelligence people I think we
had the capacity to convince him
to do it himself I think that&#39;s what
happened well one of the things that one
does in beginning to study the subject
you oppose is to answer the obvious
questions of where they come from was it
all real and if that&#39;s true how do they
work what&#39;s the evidence and so one of
the things that I did kind of early on
was to take the data that we got from
reading the literature that Stan
Freedman was kind of collecting and and
takes specific cases to see what clues
were there for example the case of Paul
Hill sighting where there were two UFOs
circling around each other at a known
distance apart and under a known cloud
cover told you that it 135 G&#39;s of
acceleration so they had you know really
a good number and then likewise you can
compute the G&#39;s from the time to
disappear over the rise and so I
developed a kind of a technical briefing
on what we knew the limits might be and
and also things relating to the physical
evidence there is indentations on a
railroad tie that were so deep so big
diameter told you you know what the
pressure was going to be per square
centimeter and you could make an
estimate of what that meant with respect
to the weight of the craft so these
kinds of things I just kind of
automatically did as I was developing my
thought processes and I concluded that
there was just no question about what
they were there were genuine real
objects and that they worked in some
specific way and that the only question
was to figure out how that is there were
not there was nothing like magic and
there are no secrets if you&#39;re smart
enough you just figure out what the
equations are and we weren&#39;t there yet
we studied this project on company money
and wound up we spent five hundred
thousand dollars of 1968 270 dollars of
the company&#39;s money here we were
studying a technology that might be a
thousand years ahead of ours and we
might not have the materials with it for
this methods or anything so the right
thing to do was to to cancel it
were there were other things as I became
more familiar with the literature that I
gradually developed an opinion on one
was the opinion that the psychic
communication was always a clue and was
usually present as I remember the one
case that particularly impressed me of
some guy in Mexico said he camera he was
I kinky came drawn a corner and there
was this huge alien with a device around
his belt and so the guy touched the belt
turned a knob and all of a sudden he was
hearing what the alien was thinking
directly just like that and say well you
know that&#39;s what we need is a device
like that all you have to do is figure
out how it works and it should be
straightforward once we study that
that&#39;s why one when I was in the ball I
was working with a guy who turned out we
may even heard of heard of them his name
was Jack Hulk who had a good deal of
interest in studying anomalous things
that had to do with mind and so he had
been looking at the subject of remote
viewing he invented the PK party with
Colonel John Alexander and whom you may
know well whom people may know and Jack
got me interested in doing becoming
familiar with with remote viewing and so
I met Hal boot off when he was working
at SSRI and Hal told me about their
program there and and one thing led to
another that we did a little coordinate
remote viewing program of our own and it
turned out that mr. McDonald became
aware of this fact that we were doing
this in in the ball at least we were
thinking about doing it and he called me
into his office one day when I was back
at st. Louis on a business trip and I
thought you know I&#39;m about to get really
chastised but he talked to me for two
hours and said he was excited to find
out there was somebody who&#39;s interested
in the subject because you know he he
named his airplanes The Phantom in the
Voodoo because he believed in that stuff
at the banshee I think you were maybe
four names and so he gave us $20,000 to
study this coordinate remote viewing
covertly in the vault the net result was
that I had become familiar with yet
another corner of anomalies namely the
psychic end and so I just actually I
started to inadvertently just add
together what I knew about UFOs and what
I knew about psychic stuff and figure
they were all interconnected and if you
get one set of equations you&#39;re going to
get the other and and how pulled off and
I were in agreement with that and we&#39;d
established a pretty good relationship
because I was doing some innovative
things that hadn&#39;t thought of I came to
the conclusion early on that the
evidence for extraterrestrial visitation
was just overwhelming I mean almost so
large that you don&#39;t even have to
discuss as I became more familiar with
the UFO program on projects especially
in my conversations with Jim McDonald I
originally kind of thought like he did
that either had to be a cover-up or a
follow-up and he had leaned strongly to
follow up and there was certainly enough
evidence that support a lot of follow-up
by the Bluebook personnel however my
last conversation with him as I thought
back I I concluded that what he&#39;d found
was that he&#39;d found that there was a
cover-up and that he very likely had run
into the crash the crash retrievals
story and that&#39;s why he wanted to make
absolutely sure that it was right before
he even told me so since then I have not
closed my mind any possibility including
the degree to which we might have been
successful in reverse engineering or
reverse sciencing the the craft the
possibility that we&#39;ve been doing that
same process in the psychic domain and
the possibility that our intelligence
and counterintelligence forces are
sufficiently sophisticated that there&#39;s
almost nothing they can&#39;t deal with or
you could imagine and this comes now
from my kind of car
work that as you look at the Majestic
documents the ones that we&#39;re
researching at the 1952 documents
basically say that the most critical
problem is the control of the press you
can imagine a group of guys say in about
1949 getting together say how are we
going to keep the public from knowing
this and it would have been a challenge
it would have been a fun project to
develop the plan to ensure that the
public never really found out the truth
and have all sorts of countermeasures
ready for if this happens that if that
happens this and so in my opinion
whoever is in control now has all these
countermeasures all worked out and guys
like me going around giving talks here
and there really no no problem for them
because they&#39;ve already assumed that
that&#39;s going to happen they&#39;ve assumed
that some of the people are going to
leak documents it assumed that some of
these are going to be shown to be
unambiguously genuine but they&#39;ve also
said well they put out their small
forces and say well try to screw it up
as much as possible at the mean time so
some of the critics that I have I think
may be inverting pawns of the guys who
are trying to keep the secret clearly in
order to have effective control of this
subject you have to control at all
levels in the most obvious level is the
media so you have to look at all the
kinds of media there are the the movies
the magazines and of course in the early
days that&#39;s all I had is newspapers and
movies and magazines now we have the
internet and another video and all those
other sorts of things so but as the
technology has blossomed into these
other avenues the people worrying about
this control have also just moved into
those avenues right along with them so
every time new avenue comes up they have
a new counterpoint if you look at the
documents that we have recovered it&#39;s
interesting that some of them discuss
the reasons why one we want to keep this
secret and some of those reasons were
extremely valid at the time for example
the first documents that we now have in
fact it just came a few weeks ago I was
was one having to do with the Los
Angeles area and from that air raid
apparently there were two crashes one
that was recovered in the ocean one the
land in the San Marino mountains and so
George Marshall who was a chief of staff
wrote to FDR and said this is what
happened and we are setting up an
interplanetary phenomena unit to study
this problem so the the initial process
would have started during the war and
that&#39;s why I when Roswell crashes
occurred while our teams were all poised
and ready and practiced and it was no
big deal
they&#39;d probably done it several times
before understandable reasons back 50
years ago for secrecy of course would
have been aid to win the war with
Germany it&#39;d be to make sure that we
were in charge of the technology for us
Russia and the Soviet Union so those
those reasons remain very important and
very practical and very real and even
today I would not I see Saddam Hussein
have this high technology he may be even
less responsible than the other guys but
and so to some extent protecting this
technology from irresponsible people is
still a useful thing to do the and
that&#39;s one of the problems where the
problem occurs because today as then in
order to keep it away from bad guys you
have to keep it away from the good guys
too as if you tell the public you have
to assume some of the public or bad guys
and they&#39;ll go off and run with it like
some people you know make explosives and
blow up buildings so the reason is
however I believe for that are different
now as to why the secrecy is is no
longer as much of a problem is that
several things have changed one there is
I believe no significant religious
reason for keeping a secret and that
time they didn&#39;t really know when when
the first UFO crashed the radio program
the War of the Worlds was only three or
four years old and people remembered how
allegedly the public got all upset
because there were Martians landing in
the backyard I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a
problem anymore
the problem of politics I think is the
same that is the people who are in power
why stay in power and unless they see
this as an advantage to staying in power
there&#39;s there&#39;s no reason for them to do
it but the reason for I believe the
genuine reason for releasing this
information and story to the public is
that we&#39;re paying for it and these
covert programs have costs the taxpayers
a huge percentage you know like 10% of
our GNP or something some big number
like that I mean you hear numbers like
thirty to fifty billion dollars but I
don&#39;t think that&#39;s ten percent of the
GNP I&#39;d be inclined to say we&#39;ve spent
more than that we have not only the
well-known covert black programs but we
have I guess to use Steve Greer&#39;s phrase
unacknowledged black programs so
fundamentally it&#39;s wrong to steal money
from people in democracy I&#39;m often asked
well what do I think about what&#39;s going
on today and I guess my conscious answer
to that question is a white son and I
study the documents that we can get
ahold of and those documents tend to
span the range from 1941 to 1970 and we
know what they say and we think we can
prove that they&#39;re authentic and genuine
and telling the right story the word is
that in 1970 or so everything went
electronic and that would have been I
think quite consistent with what I was
seeing and what you&#39;d want to do if you
had a really secure program to make a go
electronic or just have it work mouth
and write almost nothing down on paper
for people to leak and that may be one
of the reasons we&#39;re not getting leaks
today the source of propulsion what&#39;s
the principal issue that I initially
attacked from the point of view of an
aerospace company that is how you get
there from here and part of that answer
has to do with getting the energy to
drive the propulsion system because
clearly it&#39;s not done by by throwing
little particles out the rear as as we
generally do
so I have concluded that whatever the
source of the propulsion gravity control
is is the same as the source of to
release energy once you find one you&#39;ll
find the other and I also think you&#39;ll
probably get a good hint on how the
psychic things work so those things are
likely to be interconnected at the
various deepest level now the only the
theory that I&#39;m most familiar with that
I feel kind of comfortable with is the
zero point fluctuations theories that
that dr. Pugh toff has studied carefully
I got a call from the Gaithersburg
facility saying that they had ten Earl
Ansari 12 to 15 UFOs 50 to 100 feet off
the ground so I asked the guy who was on
the radio with me I said what do they
sound like he took its head and mic off
put it out the band window and again the
pulsating sound except there were more
of them and he was describing them
