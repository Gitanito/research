 Prasnottara, The.
 Theosophy in India.

Like its successor and continuation, the journal was devoted primarily to the practical affairs of the Theosophical Society in India (dues, receipts, Mrs. Besantâ€™s tour program, conventions, etc.) but also included articles on various points of Theosophy.  Noted in Metaphysische Rundschau, July 1896.  Archivo General de la Guerra Civil Espanola.
