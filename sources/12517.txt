It happened at my home.  An emergency team was called immediately; there were many people who arrived at my home (such as the doctor, paramedics, and fire brigade).  I lost consciousness, yet I was hearing, 'We are losing her, we are losing her!'  I was watching everything from the ceiling, as if I was floating above them.  I don't know how much time this took.  Then I felt myself leaving the scene and there was a warm and welcoming light waiting for me and enveloping me.  I felt drawn into the tunnel.  I was well, but I sensed that if I would go too far, I couldn't come back anymore.
