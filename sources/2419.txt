PREFACE
Papus, i.e., Dr. Gerard Encausse, Supreme Grand Master of
the Fraternitas of Europe, rendered service as a physician and
surgeon during the first world war. He died a hero's death.
Some time before the beginning of that war he made the state-
ment that "in the not too distant future the entire secret
mystery concerning the Rosy Cross would be unfolded."
Whether or not Papus had a prevision of the second world
war, and the consequent release of the records held in the
archives of the Fraternitas, no man can truthfully say. We do
know, however, that this has come about and that as a result
we are about to unreel the second phase of the activity of
j Dramatis Persons, beginning immediately after the formation
ft of the Fraternitas Ros<e Crucis, i.e., the Fraternity of the Rosy
Cross, and ending with the date given at the close of this
Preface.
The Fama was properly the foundation and the constitution
of the Fraternhas, and consequently belonged to the first phase
or era of the Fraternitas.
For this reason we have always felt that the Confessio,
published in proper form after the formation of the Fraternitas
actually and rightly belonged to the second phase or era of the
work. Since this text starts with the beginning of this second
phase and era of the Fraternity, we make use of it, and properly
so, as an Introduction to this era, followed by a word picture
of the activities of the Actors of the Arcane Drama.
At the time of the formation of the Fraternity of the Rosy
Cross, there were but two active organized bodies funda-
mentally based on the Arcane. These were the Fraternitas

zation of primitive Masonry, with a ritual based on the Law

PREFACE
Papus, i.e., Dr. Gerard Encausse, Supreme Grand Master of
the Fraternitas of Europe, rendered service as a physician and
surgeon during the first world war. He died a hero's death.
Some time before the beginning of that war he made the state-
ment that "in the not too distant future the entire secret
mystery concerning the Rosy Cross would be unfolded."
Whether or not Papus had a prevision of the second world
war, and the consequent release of the records held in the
archives of the Fraternitas, no man can truthfully say. We do
know, however, that this has come about and that as a result
we are about to unreel the second phase of the activity of
Dramatis Personte, beginning immediately after the formation
of the Fraternitas Roste Crucis, i.e., the Fraternity of the Rosy
Cross, and ending with the date given at the close of this
Preface.
The Fama was properly the foundation and the constitution
of the Fraternitas, and consequently belonged to the first phase
or era of the Fraternitas.
For this reason we have always felt that the Confessio,
published in proper form after the formation of the Fraternitas
actually and rightly belonged to the second phase or era of the
work. Since this text starts with the beginning of this second
phase and era of the Fraternity, we make use of it, and properly
so, as an Introduction to this era, followed by a word picture
of the activities of the Actors of the Arcane Drama.
At the time of the formation of the Fraternity of the Rosy
Cross, there were but two active organized bodies funda-
mentally based on the Arcane. These were the Fraternitas
itself, and a well-established, though profoundly secret organi-
zation of primitive Masonry, with a ritual based on the Law
xii PREFACE
of Creadon (generation), and the necessary efforts of both
man and woman to maintain that creation. This Law was
vividly and truthfully illustrated in the ritual and ended in its
higher degrees in the Arcane of REgeneration. In passing, it
may be stated, without revealing any secrets, that at the
entrance of the Lodge there were two pillars; MAN on one
side, and WOMAN on the other.
These two figures of primitive Masonry (Masonry actually
meaning the "builders") were later replaced in modern Masonry
by Jachin and Boas. That is the exact picture of the Arcane in
the year of 1614.
It can truthfully be stated that:
No sooner does God build a Chapel to his people,
Than Satan (the devil, or evil one) builds a
Charnel house near.
This quickly proved true, as a writer has well stated. Im-
mediately after the Rosy Cross and its concepts became
generally known by the publication of the Fama and other
Arcane literature, a spiritual renaissance began, and with it
illegitimate children by scores, things of rank imposture; down-
right charlatans and pretenders sprang up everywhere and
became active. Clandestinism was rife; hallowed names were
assumed and fraud became the order of the day, so much so,
that the true brethren and their activities entered a period of
voluntary SILENCE in order to protect themselves and the
Arcane. Many works were published by those who had no
knowledge whatever of either the Rosy Cross or the Arcane,
and these books continue to be quoted as authorities, while
clandestine activities continue; misleading, debasing and de-
frauding millions.
To make confusion more confounded, modern Masonry
entered the field and, in a sense, and to a certain degree, super-
ceded Primitive Masonry. This new Masonry was free from
guilt in so far as Occult chicanery was concerned, but in its

of Creation (generation), and the necessary efforts of both
man and woman to maintain that creation. This Law was
vividly and truthfully illustrated in the ritual and ended in its
higher degrees in the Arcane of REgeneration. In p~ing, it
may be stated, without revealing any secrets, that at the
entrance of the Lodge there were two pillars; MAN on one
side, and WOMAN on the other.
These two figures of primitive Masonry (Masonry actually
meaning the "builders") were later replaced in modern Masonry
by Jachin and Boas. That is the exact picture of the Arcane in
the year of 1614.
It can truthfully be stated that:
No sooner does God build a Chapel to his people,
Than Satan (the devil, or evil one) builds a
Chamel house near.
This quickly proved true, as a writer has well stated. Im-
mediately after the Rosy Cross and its concepts became
generally known by the publication of the Fmna and other
Arcane literature, a spiritual renaissance began, and with it
illegitimate children by scores, things of rank imposture; dO'Um-
right charlatans and pretenders sprang up everywhere and
becmne active. Clandestinism was rife; hallowed names were
assumed and fraud became the order of the day, so much so,
that the true brethren and their activities entered a period of
voluntary SILENCE in order to protect themselves and the
Arcane. Many works were published by those who had no
knowledge whatever of either the Rosy Cross or the Arcane,
and these books continue to be quoted as authorities, while
clandestine activities continue; misleading, debasing and de-
frauding millions.
To make confusion more confounded, modem Masonry
entered the field and, in a sense, and to a certain degree, super-
ceded Primitive Masonry. This new Masonry was free from
guilt in so far as Occult chicanery was concerned, but in its
BOOK OF ROSICRUCLE xiii
ritual it embraced a then Occult degree which was known, and
still is known, as the Rose Croix degree. The profane, possessing
no knowledge either of the Arcane Rosy Cross, or the Masonic
degree of Rose Croix, were in no position to differentiate
between the two; one a Philosophical attainment and the other
a ritualistic degree. To all but the Initiates, this hopelessly
confused the two bodies in the mind of the public, and con-
fusion has reigned supreme ever since.
In order to at last, and at this late day, clarify the two; sep-
arating one from the other in such a simple manner, that all
interested either in Masonry or in the Arcane, may readily
understand and avoid either betrayal or confusion, it is to be
understood that:
1. In the ineffable degrees of Masonry there is one known
as the Rose Croix, and this is a "degree"—not a spiritual
attainment through self effort—a degree conferred by
means of a ritual, upon all who are found worthy.
2. It is also to be understood that in many Occult and
semi-spiritual organizations which possess, as part of
their activity, ritualistic degrees, there is a Rose Croix—
NOT Rose Cross—degree, which is conferred upon well-
prepared candidates, by means of a ritual, and against
which no fault is to be found.
3. The purely Masonic degree of the Rose Croix, whether
Christian, Mystical or Occult, and the Rose Croix de-
gree which is part of various Mystical and Occult
organizations, has nothing whatever, not even in the
slightest degree, to do with the Rose Cross of the
Fraternitas, or the Fraternity of the Rosy Cross.
4. This being fundamentally true, we speak of attainment
in the Rosy Cross as Philosophic Initiation, while in the
Rose Croix of either Masonry or Mystical and Occult
societies and orders initiation is ritualistic.

In the present text we deal exclusively with the Fraternitas

crucians, which naturally includes the Brotherhood, Order and
Temple of the Rosy Cross, as these are the outer Courts.
The terms Rosy Cross, Fraternitas Rosa Crucis, Fraternity
of the Rosy Cross or Rosicrucians, are used interchangeably
and mean one and the same thing.
The terms Rose Cross, Brethren of Light, Hermetic and
Alchemic Initiate, and PHILOSOPHIC INITIATE, are likewise used
interchangeably and mean one and the same thing.
No one can possibly become a Rose Cross, a Philosophic
Initiate, or a Brother of the Light, unless he is first enrolled in
a duly accredited Dome, Grand Dome or Supreme Grand
Dome of competent jurisdiction, i.e., belonging to the original
authority of the Fraternitas; accepted as a Neophyte; placed
under the guidance and instruction of a selected instructor; fol-
lowed through with the study, training and development, and
finally BECOMES a Rose Cross.
The true and authentic Rosy Cross is wholly Philosophic
and its purpose and intent is interior Illumination, ending in
Philosophic Initiation, the becoming of a Rose Cross, or a
Brother of the Light.
In this text we are wholly following the middle road; the
path adhered to by the Fraternitas Ros<e Crucis since its
BEGINNING.

On the one side of us are the many and various Fraternalistic

distinct, and though many of the greatest leaders of the past and
in the present belong to one of these worthy bodies, we do not
give them consideration.
On the other side, there are many organizations which are
basically not Masonic, but instead may be classified as semi-
Mystic or semi-Occult, conferring degrees upon their members,
among which is the Rose Croix. This is especially true in France,
other European countries with the probable exception of Eng-
land, and in Central and South American countries.
With these we find no fault, nor have we comment. Many
of the great Initiates were either members or leaders of such
Masonic bodies.
There is still another class of organizations; a large class who
are self-instituted, without competent authority or jurisdiction,
who have blatantly assumed the names of some authentic Rosi-
crucian, Masonic or Mystic-Occult organization or a combina-
tion of both, and who make dupes of millions.
What is competent authority? Masons know what it is, but
many seekers for Rosicrucian truths, Soul Illumination and
Philosophic Initiation do not have a proper understanding of
the term "competent authority," and are therefore unable to
judge between the true and the false.
Authority for the establishment of a Council, whether of
Three, Seven, Nine, Fifteen or Twenty-one, can be granted
only by a Grand, or Supreme Grand Master, and only within
his own Country, or on petition from Rose Cross living in a
country where there is no Rosy Cross.
When organizing the Fraternitas Ros<e Crucis in Germany in
1614, there were the Three who formed the Triangle, these
were the Supreme Grand Masters of Germany, France and
England, and from these, in succession, descended authority.
Each Supreme Grand Master selected his successor, and these
in turn did the same. Either one had the authority to select a

2. Writers of books, and those more or less seriously in
search for truth who, failing to contact the true Order,
wrote books, proclaimed themselves RX and started
Orders. They were NOT REALLY frauds, but WISHFUL
THINKERS.
3. The original organization was never for a moment dead
or inert. It always functioned in one form or another.
Initiates were never for a moment lacking. There are
times or periods when due to conditions there is a de-
cline in Acolytes (such as in France and most of Europe
at this moment, 1946).
4. Periods when only the inner Council of Three remained
active. For the world this proportionately amounted to
as much as though a large organization functioned. The
members of such Councils were always Initiates of the
Exalted Third, highly spiritually minded, Cosmic Con-
scious, or, as Boehrne would have it, "God-enlightened."
These lived but to Glorify God by SERVING MANKIND
as a whole. Their constant aim was to release as much of
this wisdom as the individuals and the mass would
accept. To these Councils were drawn those in earnest
search for truth and Divine Wisdom, and the Order,
as such, again became active. Basically, this Council of
Three has always been a personification of the Essenian
Master's FIAT. "Where two or three are gathered to-
gether in MY NAME [God's purpose], there am I in
the midst of them."—Matthew 18:20. And just as from
the Nazarene's teachings [teaching of one man] sprang
Christianity, so from the Secret, but active Council of
Three is the Fraternity constantly revived. The ignor-
ant and non-knowing may deny the existence of the
Councils, just as they deny the existence of the Naza-
rene, but Christianity exists nevertheless; and so DOES
THE ROSY CROSS.

scious, or, as Boehme would have it, "God-enlightened."
These lived but to Glorify God by SERVING MANKIND
as a whole. Their constant aim was to release as much of
this wisdom as the individuals and the mass would
accept. To these Councils were drawn those in earnest
search for truth and Divine Wisdom, and the Order,
as such, again became active. Basically, this Council of
Three has always been a personification of the E.5senian
Master's FIAT. "Where two or three are gathered to-
gether in MY NAME [God's purpose], there am I in
the midst of them."-Matthew 18: 20. And just as from
the Nazarene's teachings [teaching of one man] sprang
Christianity, so from the Secret, but active Council of
Three is the Fraternity constantly revived. The ignor-
ant and non-knowing may deny the existence of the
Councils, just as they deny the existence of the Naza-
rene, but Christianity exists nevertheless; and so DOES
THE RosY Caoss.

non-Christian; their philosophy Cabalistic and Neo-Platonic,

The Christian revelations were accepted, but only on the
basis that the ancient revelations were not the exclusive prop-

all mankind were given equal rights and opportunities, pro-

made possible these revelations.
It is true that they went far beyond the purely Christian
concept of the WAY of Salvation. In place of the precepts of
Salvation by faith, they held firmly to the Gnostic teaching
of the Way. They taught that only by awakening and bring-

man attain to the highest degree of consciousness and that
this is man's only way to individualization, and ultimate as

Salvation by faith was wholly rejected by the Brethren

state of mind and Soul where we are at peace within ourselves
and therefore with all that is. Even in the midst of sorrow and
turmoil, man can still be at peace—in the knowlede and under-
standing that all is well. This is the ultimate goal of all hu-

The cross must be borne by all, and, that there be no mis-
understanding, the cross borne is a different one for all.
The problems, passions and sorrows of no two are alike,
therefore the Work of the cross, or the meaning of the cross,
is different as it concerns each individual. As we bear the Cross
and the transmutation of the gross; that which is our special
carnal problem, the blood of the rose is shed upon the cross
and results in Immortality.
To believe, to have faith, is well; but we must "knock,"
that is, we must make the effort. We must continue the effort.
This effort must be in patience, lest the divine blessing, the
result of our labors, pass us by.
It is not sufficient that we think of and engage in the Great
Work. We "must resist unto the last drop." That is, all that
is carnal and temporary within us must be transmuted. It is
only then that the Stone Aben—the stone of the Philosophers,
of Life—is uncovered and we receive the wages of the worker.
Moreover, because this effort uncovers the ever knowing
Soul and brings it into consciousness, we obtain the boon of
the Immortals—Wisdom and divine understanding.

authors in the arguments pro and con as to whether such
an organization as the Fraternity or Brotherhood ever actually

Thus we find that irrespective of whether an organization
of Christians did, or did not exist, "where two or three are
gathered together," who actually and spiritually accepted
the teachings of the Gnostic Master, then and there existed
a Christian Congregation or Communion.
It has never been successfully denied that this Master did
exist and that he did speak these words. All this has by mil-
lions been accepted as a fact, therefore, Christianity and the
Christic Communion existed in the past and still exists.
Neither has it been possible to deny with any success that
an association of men existed who called themselves the
Brethren of the Fraternity, or the Brotherhood of the Rosy
Cross. It is not denied that the Brotherhood, or the purported
members published books, that in these books they proclaimed
certain facts, among these, that the members had to swear
an oath.
Can it be denied that whenever and wherever there are gath-

organization, or an association of men, with a purpose in
mind and an obligation to bind them, that if such an obligation
is taken, the said association does not exist?
The "gathering together," whether of two or three or more,

The mere fact that men gathered together, irrespective of
the number or the purpose, gave birth then and there to the
association, or the communion, for the purpose of which they
are gathered together.
This is as surely true as regards the Rosy Cross as it was
of the birth of the Church of Christ, or the Christian Com-
munion. There can be no contradiction of this fact unless
we are willing to admit that there never was any association
of men legally formed. There is not the slightest difference
between all the associations that ever existed or still exist,
except in the name and purpose.
When one man, in the presence of other men who have
met for a certain purpose, subscribes to a name, a form, and
a resolution, and takes the oath to abide thereby, then an
association, an ORDER or a Fraternity has been given birth.
There was no intention on the part of the founders of the
Fraternity of the Rosy Cross to organize in the form which,
for instance, Masonry took in later years. Rosicrucianism was
more on the order of a spiritual union, or a spiritual concor-
dat, a spiritual Heirarchy, the individualization of men who
then form themselves into a spiritual brotherhood. Never-
theless, this communion had a physical or material basis in
that the members obligated themselves for a special purpose,
which purpose had for its basis the reformation of the indivi-
dual first, and then the reformation of the science, religious
practices, and the educational system of the day. Paracelsus
was the greatest of these in the art of medicine and states-

North America because this concerns us most, and lastly,
sympathetic consideration is given the Supreme Grand Dome
and its Illustrious brethren of England.

Less than forty years after the final consummation of the
dreams of the Philosophic Initiates of all the world, in the
formation of the Fraternitas, it was deemed wise by the
brethren to enter a period of silence or sleep, in as far as
the public, i.e., the profane, were concerned. During the
period of silence some of the greatest texts were written and

complete list in the records which General Hitchcock col-

be published in full in Volume III.
After a period of time, the Fraternitas slowly emerged from
its silence or sleep, to once again become active in behalf of

existence was permitted to become known to the world through
the activities of the two most profound enigmas ever known to
man, i.e., Count M. de Saint Germain and Cagliostro. What

also influenced the men who entered the Fraternitas; prepared
themselves for their mission; served faithfully, and given proper
credit herein.
Following closely on the heels of St. Germain and Cagliostro
was the great LaFayette, and then Thomas Paine, two of God's
noblemen who did not consider the limits of country in so far
as it concerned the freedom of men; two men so great, so
noble, so spiritually minded, that they stood boldly in the face
of mighty odds and fought that no injustice be done to even
the King of France, however guilty he might be. For their
nobility they suffered defamation and imprisonment.
Now there began a new era for the Fraternitas, a period of
activity during which all the world should know what the
Fraternitas stood for. The Fraternitas had fully aroused itself
from its sleep; its silence was broken by Levi, who became
the Supreme Grand Master of the Supreme Grand Dome in
France. As both France and America had become free from
its political masters, so did France now give freedom to its
American brethren in the Fraternitas by creating in America
an independent jurisdiction of the Fraternitas. Paschal Beverly
Randolph, under the guidance of one of the world's greatest
Initiates, General Hitchcock, became the first Supreme Grand
Master of the first Supreme Grand Dome.
Levi fulfilled his high office nobly. During his term in office
there was no discredit to L'Ordre du Lis and complete har-
mony prevailed in the Fraternitas throughout the world. His
writings were volumnous and if we do not say much of them
it is because almost all of them are still open to the sincere
seeker.
We had prepared a most valuable FAMA by Levi for this
volume, but found space would not permit its inclusion; it
will be printed in full in Volume III.
After Levi, there followed as Supreme Grand Master,

also influenced the men who entered the Fraternitas; prepared
themselves for their mission; served faithfully, and given proper
credit herein.
Following closely on the heels of St. Germain and Cagliostro
was the great LaFayette, and then Thomas Paine, two of God's
noblemen who did not consider the limits of country in so far
as it concerned the freedom of men; two men so great, so
noble, so spiritually minded, that they stood boldly in the face
of mighty odds and fought that no injustice be done to even
the King of France, however guilty he might be. For their
nobility they suffered defamation and imprisonment.
Now there began a new era for the Fraternitas, a period of
activity during which all the world should know what the
Fraternitas stood for. The Fraternitas had fully aroused itself
from its sleep; its silence was broken by Levi, who became
the Supreme Grand Master of the Supreme Grand Dome in
France. As both France and America had become free from
its political masters, so did France now give freedom to its
American brethren in the Fratemitas by creating in America
an independent jurisdiction of the Fraternitas. Paschal Beverly
Randolph, under the guidance of one of the world's greatest
Initiates, General Hitchcock, became the first Supreme Grand
Master of the first Supreme Grand Dome.
Levi fulfilled his high office nobly. During his term in office
there was no discredit to L'Ordre du Lis and complete har-
mony prevailed in the Fraternitas throughout the world. His
writings were volumnous and if we do not say much of them
it is because almost all of them are still open to the sincere
seeker.
We had prepared a most valuable FAMA by Levi for this
volume, but found space would not permit its inclusion; it
will be printed in full in Volume III.
After Levi, there followed as Supreme Grand Master,
Joseph-Alexander Saint Yves, who, like Levi, prepared a num-
xxvi PREFACE
her of very important texts to enrich the library of the Fra-
ternity and make the path of Neophytes easier.
St. Yves was followed by Stanislas de Guaita, who like St.
Yves, served well and performed heroic work for the Frater-
nitas and had a difficult task to perform because of rank
clandestinism which reared its poisonous head in France and
America.
Following de Guaita as Supreme Grand Master was Gerard
Encausse, i.e., Papus, a Philosophical Initiate of a very high
order. He served well and left behind for the benefit of Neo-
phytes to follow, a vast library carefully prepared. In order to
fully understand Papus it is necessary to familiarize ourselves
with the writings of one of the truly great Druidic and Arcane
Initiates, our own Peter Davidson, who is given full considera-
tion in the American section.
Papus was followed in office by Jean Baptiste Bricaud,
one of the great Occultists of France, who did Herculean
work to not only build up a truly spiritual Hierarchy, but even
more to free the Fraternitas and associate organizations from
the unworthy. Too much credit cannot be given Bricaud for
faithfulness and the results accomplished by him.
Bricaud had a student whom he not only considered as a
most worthy Neophyte, but whom he loved as a brother. This
was none other than Constant Martin Chevillon, a faithful
Neophyte who, through his loyalty and effort attained to
high Philosophic Initiation, was selected by Bricaud as his
successor, and who served well after being inducted into the
high office as Supreme Grand Master.
During his stewardship, Chevillon in turn selected a most
worthy Philosophic Initiate to succeed him in office. This was
H. Dupont, who is at this moment the Supreme Grand Master
of the Fraternitas. It has been our extreme good fortune to
have personally met and labored with these two high Initiates.

In volume three of the Book of Rosicruci<e we will deal more

AMERICA
Beginning with Thomas Vaughan's, i.e., Philalethe's visit
to America in 1654, the Fraternitas Ros<e Crucis, that is, the
Fraternity of the Rosy Cross in America was under the juris-
diction and guidance of a Council of Three, all of whom were
high Philosophic Initiates. This plan continued until Randolph
was selected and seated as Supreme Grand Master -of the
Supreme Grand Dome of America, with the first See in Boston.
During the entire period between Vaughan's visit in 1654,
and Thomas Paine's coming to America in 1774, all of the
activities of the Fraternitas were in secret, as the Fraternitas
was under the shadow of sleep.
With the coming of Paine and the return of Franklin from
London, this was changed, and only semi-secrecy was main-
tained. However, all of the active brethren were of a class
known as Unknown, or Inconnu, mostly due to world condi-
tions and the personal danger to them, had it become known
that they belonged to the Friends of Freedom, active in France,
England and America, and of Humanidad in France.
This period of silence and sleep continued until the veil was
suddenly lifted by a concerted move of those who had silently
been preparing themselves for greater activity. Among these
was America's foremost Alchemical Initiate, General Hitch-

and his philosophy is still invaluable to all who seek the Light
behind the Shadow, and who believe that man's highest legacy
is freedom based on personal responsibility, and against the
encroachment of license ending in anarchy.
There was a question in our mind whether the solemn obli-
gation taken by those who achieved to membership in L'Ordre
du Lis should not form a part of the article on Levi; or of the
Order of the Rose, under the chapter devoted to England. We
finally concluded that it should be included in the article de-
voted to Lippard, as he first broke the silence of the sleep of the
Fraternitas; its philosophy and work, and of what manner were
the men who so labored for country and fellow men.
Of a Lincoln, like a Washington, there is nothing we can say
which would add honor or information. The great service ren-
dered by these men to humanity is too well known to need
comment. As to their part in the Fraternitas, that possibly
concerns only the Brethren.
Of Randolph much has been written and as much said. While
his name and birth are known to all, actually, his life and
achievements are almost as much an enigma as are those of St.
Germain and Cagliostro. He served well his Fraternity; equally
well his country and his fellow men. He was justly proud of
his association with Lincoln, General Hitchcock and the great
of many countries. For all his achievements and services his lot,
like that of St. Germain and Cagliostro, was misunderstanding
and vilification, to say nothing of persecution and suffering.
Pity on him and his lot is wasted because he understood well
that the reward of service is not praise and worldly compensa-
tion, but further sacrifice, self-denial, suffering and desecration
of all that is sacred. He sought not pity, but to serve; nothing
greater may be said of any man. Among the sincere students of
the Arcane, his labors and texts must speak for themselves; the
judgment of others matters little.

already mentioned, but others who should be specially honored
are such as John Temple, Drs. Louis Fontaine and Albert Berge-
vin, and, lest we forget, Charles Trinius and W. G. Palgrave.
Following Randolph in the Supreme Office and appointed by
him as his successor, was Freeman B. Dowd. Dowd, though
Supreme Grand Master, was a semi-Unknown. He filled his
office with honor and performed his work well. The books
prepared by him treat of the Great Work on the basis of
science and are still procurable.
In America, some of the members of the Councils, though
without authoritative or directive power, were more active
than some of the Supreme Grand Masters. Of these, some of
whom wrote and published most important texts, may be
named: Dr. John C. Street; Paul Tyner; Alexander Wilder and
Peter Davidson. Davidson was not only one of the truly great
Philosophic Initiates, but the instructor and guide of many even
in the far corners of the world who either filled the office of
Supreme Grand Master or were the authors of texts accepted
as authority by the Fraternity.
Dr. James R. Phelps and Sorona belonged to the class of the
Unknown, or Inconnu, though they were by no means inactive
during the period of their lives after attaining Philosophic Initi-
ation. This also is true of Dr. Edward H. Brown, who became
a Supreme Grand Master and Hierarch of Imperial Eulis.
Of those who served in the Council of Three under myself,
faithfully performed their duties and have now passed to the
land of the Light beyond the Shadow, two, Peter Davidson and
Dr. Alexander Wilder have already had consideration, the
others, Dr. Allan F. Odell, Dr. Abraham W. Witt, and Oliver
D. Everhard, belonged to the class of Unknown, or Inconnu,
and live fondly in the memory of ourselves and many others;
their place, as must be, is occupied by others whose names will
be revealed in time.

ENGLAND
In England, going back to 1617-1637, we find Dr. Robert
Fludd in the office of Supreme Grand Master of the Supreme
Grand Dome. Fludd, tike Maier in Germany and D'Espagnet
in France, was a truly great Philosophic Initiate, a Rose Cross
second to none, an author of important works, but his days
were to be few. Fortunately for the Fraternitas, there were
worthy Neophytes in preparation for a great work: William
Backhouse and Etias Ashmole.
Backhouse was fully prepared to fill the Supreme office, but
he had no desire to do so. He preferred to remain an Unknown,
or Inconnu, a Member of the Council of Three and the guide
and instructor of those accepted as Neophytes by the Fraterni-
tas. However, it was necessary for Backhouse to fill the office
for a short time, while Elias Ashmole was being finally pre-
pared to take his seat as Supreme Grand Master.
Contemporary with Backhouse and Ashmole were two of the
greatest instructors the Fraternitas ever had in Europe. These
were Peter Sthael and Thomas Vaughan.
Sthael became the instructor and guide of more Neophytes
than any other Philosophic Initiate since the formation of the
Fraternitas. He also had more friends and associates belonging
to the Royal College than any other man. He was a member of
both L'Ordre du Lis and Order of the Rose, and continued as
a member of the Council until his passing.
Associated with Sthael was another great Philosophic Initiate,
none other than Thomas Vaughan, i.e., Philalethes, so highly
spoken of by General Hitchcock. Vaughan's greatest influence
was felt in America and the several countries of Europe. His
works continued to be recognized as texts and are only now

1 This charge may be readily understood when we bear in mind that
many of those who were instrumental in the formation of the Fraternitas
and in the preparation of its FAMAS, had been Initiate members of the
Templars, or the sons of such Initiates and that they accused the Pope,
more than anyone else, of not only destroying the Temple, but also of
torturing many of its members into false confessions and 1n finally burn-
ing at the stake their Supreme Grand Master deMolay and his associates
for things of which none of the Initiates were guilty.

"of day, I suppose we should be ashamed of such ques-

"Fraters R. C."
' This charge may be readily understood when we bear in mind that
many of those who were instrumental in the formation of the Fraternitas
and in the preparation of its FAMAS, had been Initiate members of the
Templars, or the sons of such Initiates and that they accused the Pope,
more than anyone else, of not only destroying the Temele, but also of
torturing many of its members into false confessions and m finally burn-
ing at the stake their Supreme Grand Master dcMolay and his associates
for things of which none of the Initiates were guilty.

"will not move gross wits, and because the works of those

"clamor, a thousand times may present themselves, yet

can the Brethren of the Fraternity be recognized by the pro-
fane; by anyone unless he also has "received the strength bor-
rowed from the eagle." By this we mean that only those will
be able to recognize the Initiate whose vision has been opened
so "that having eyes they see," and none possess this vision un-
less it has been intensified like the sight of the eagle—one who

"more the godly wise, or princely persons than the com-
"mon people, with him we are in no wise angry (for the
"accusation is not without moment), but withall we affirm
"that we have by no means made common property of our
"arena, albeit they resound in five languages within the
"ears of the vulgar, both because, as we well know, they
"will not move gross wits, and because the works of those
"who shall be accepted into our Fraternity will not be
"measured by their curiosity, but by the rule and pattern
"of our revelation. A thousand times the unworthy may
"clamor, a thousand times may present themselves, yet
"God has commanded our ears that they should hear none
"of them, and has so compassed us about with His clouds
" [protective aura1that unto us, His servants, no violence
"can be done; wherefore now no longer are we beheld by
"human eyes, unless they have received strength borrowed
"from the eagle (13)."
( 13) "No longer are we beheld by human eyes," i.e., no longer
can the Brethren of the Fraternity be recognized by the pro-
fane; by anyone unless he also has "received the strength bor-
rowed from the eagle." By this we mean that only those will
be able to recognize the Initiate whose vision has been opened
so "that having eyes they see," and none possess this vision un-
less it has been intensified like the sight of the eagle-one who
soars-one whose vision is of the spirit, not alone of the flesh.
"For the rest, it has been necessary that the Fame should
"be set forth in every one's mother tongue, lest those
"should be defrauded of the knowledge thereof, whom
"(although they be unlearned) ( 14) God has not excluded
''from the happiness [benefits] of this Fraternity which
"divided into degrees ( 15); as those who dwell in Damcar

THE FRATERNITAS ROSAE
CRUCIS IN FRANCE
LMOST IMMEDIATELY after the successful completion of
the formation of the Fraternitas Rosce Crucis, and the
seating of Jean D'Espagnet as Supreme
Grand Master of the Fraternitas for
THE SECOND
PHASE OF THE
GREAT WORK
France and Petro loanne Fabro as senior
member of the Council of Three, the
Fraternitas went into one of the periods
known in the Arcane as sleep, or Si-
lence. This does not mean, as many pro-
fane have concluded, that the Fraternity is either dead or has
ceased its activity, but that for good reasons, it has concluded
that it would be wisest for all concerned if all of its activities
be secret; none of its members be known to the public, and
even those high in office and the Councils should remain Un-
known, or Inconnu, and that even text written by any of the
Brethren during that period of sleep or silence, shall be the
sole responsibility of the author and bear no imprint indicating
their connection with the Fraternity.
Among the Philosophic Initiates during this period, begin-
ning about 1650 and ending with the selection of La Fayette
as a member of the Council of Three, were 1:
Davissons Du Soucy
Abbe Albert Belius Chevalier
1 Many of these were authors of important works on Alchemy, the
Arcane Science and other phases of the Great Work, all of them in
the possession of General Hitchcock. It had been our intention to give
the entire list of tides with dates of issue, in the present work, but space
prohibits. This will be included in the third, and final volume, of
Rosicruciee.

Grand Master of the Fraternitas for
Franee and Petro loanne Fabro as senior
member of the Council of Three, the
Fraternitas went into one of the periods
known in the Arcane as sleep, or Si-
~ Jenee. This does not mean, as many pro-
fane have concluded, that the Fraternity is either dead or has
ceased its activity, but that for good reasons, it has concluded
that it would be wisest for all concerned if all of its activities
be secret; none of its members be known to the public, and
even those high in office and the Councils should remain Un-
known, or lnconnu, and that even text written by any of the
Brethren during that period of sleep or silence, shall be the
sole responsibility of the author and bear no imprint indicating
their connection with the Fraternity.

ning about 1650 and ending with the selection of La Fayette
as a member of the Council of Three, were 1

ing the period he studied medicine, when about twenty-two,
he became acquainted with an old Alchemist who had just re-

were members of the then newly formed Rosy Cross.
Fabro was of an extremely religious turn of mind. He had to
see all things through the eyes of the mystic. While at first he
was skeptical, the spirit of the mysteries soon took hold of him
and he became thoroughly imbued with the concepts of spir-
itual alchemy. The unknown Alchemist, himself an Initiate,
undertook to instruct and guide the young Fabro and by the
time he was twenty-seven he had become a Philosophic Initiate.
When he was twenty-eight he undertook a short visit to
Germany, where he was well received by brethren of the
Council of Three, and was considered worthy of being made a
member of the Council of Seven for France. From Germany
he went to Paris to pay his respects to the brethren there, then

then in medicine, a profession he fol-
lowed through life.
Fabro took his degree when he was
twenty-three and engaged in the prac-
tice of medicine in Montpellier. He
also continued his experiments in chem-
~ istry, to which he added alchemy. Dur-
ing the period he studied medicine, when about twenty-two,
he became acquainted with an old Alchemist who had just re-
turned from Germany to Montpellier with wondrous stories
of the Initiate Alchemists he had met in Germany and who
were members of the then newly formed Rosy Cross.
Fabro was of an extremely religious turn of mind. He had to
see all things through the eyes of the mystic. While at first he
was skeptical, the spirit of the mysteries soon took hold of him
and he became thoroughly imbued with the concepts of spir-
itual alchemy. The unknown Alchemist, himself an Initiate,
undertook to instruct and guide the young Fabro and by the
time he was twenty-seven he had become a Philosophic Initiate.
When he was twenty-eight he undertook a short visit to
Germany, where he was well received by brethren of the
Council of Three, and was considered worthy of being made a
member of the Council of Seven for France. From Germany
he went to Paris to pay his respects to the brethren there, then

journeyed to Toulouse, and on arriving there began the prep-
aration of his first work on the spiritual (Christic, or Christian)
side of Alchemy, which he considered as esoteric (the hidden
side) of Christianity.
In his first Work; Alchemists Christianus, published at
Toulouse in 1632, when he was thirty-one years of age, he
gives much consideration to the symbolism of the Hermetic
Philosophy couched in the jargon of the old Alchemists. This
work of two hundred and thirty-six pages of Latin has been
so little understood that it has received practically no con-
sideration by later writers on the subject.
It deals in detail with the spiritual trinity in alchemical terms
and is actually a treatise on how to bring about this spiritual
alchemization or transmutation within the person.
Hitchcock did not hesitate to show in his writings that the
salt, mercury and the sulphur of the Alchemist Initiates
formed a trinity that, transmuted, became the "philosophic"
gold, the sun, or the Son of Man, the ultimate of human per-
fection.
He also claimed that the trend for all mankind, if obeyed,
is toward perfection through labor or sacrifice; the Rose of
Love, as a result of affection, not passion, bringing about RE-
generation through sacrifice upon the Cross of endurance,
working toward purity and final sanctification (clarification).
In his second work Hercules Pischymicus, published a year
later, he remained true to his earlier concept and ideals with
the Labors of Hercules esoterically, showing that these were
allegories in which are hidden the Arcanum of the Hermetic
philosophy, a theory with which all Philosophic Initiates agree.
After the publication of his second book Fabro continued the
practice of medicine in Toulouse, but gave the greater part of
his time to the instruction and guidance of young Neophytes
placed under his care by the Fraternitas.

COUNT M. DE SAINT GERMAIN was born November 25, 1710,
of a French father, member of the Royal family, and a
Prussian mother, also a member of the
Royal family. His early education was
planned for the purpose of having him
serve several countries in a diplomatic
capacity. Having an exalted position in
mind for him, his guardians 1 had him
instructed in several important lan-
guages, in music and the fine arts, and
in everything needful for a Gentleman
at Court.
At an early age it became apparent
that while all of these attainments were
not at all difficult for him, any desire on
his part for a diplomatic career would
be wholly secondary to his nature, and
that instead, chemistry, Alchemy, the
Occult and the Arcane were native to his nature and would
receive first choice.
Under his guardians he obediently followed the course of
studies outlined, becoming generally proficient in English,
French, Spanish, Italian, German, Russian, Polish, and several
Oriental languages, mastering the art of diplomacy at the same
time.

His instructor in the Italian language was an Occultist of
note among the Philosophic Initiates. Saint Germain, being of
an extremely sensitive nature; a sensitive, in fact; soon sensed
that this one tutor was different from his other instructors, and
he gave him no peace of mind until he also instructed him in
the rudiments of the Arcane philosophy.
When legally of age, Saint Germain severed his ties from his
guardians and left with his Italian language tutor for Italy,
where he resided for three years, perfecting himself in the
Italian language and further studying the Arcane philosophy.
During this period he also studied Oriental languages, and at
twenty-four left for the Orient, where he was received with
honor by the Fraternitas,2 his parents being known to them.
After two years in the Orient, and having attained to Philo-
sophic Initiation, he left India for Syria.
It was while he was under the instruction and guidance of
the Syrian Ansaireh Brotherhood that he developed the power
to at will pass into a trance condition.8 During these experi-

His sensitive sense was so developed that frequently he could
place himself en rapport with others, men and women alike, and
read their thoughts. It was this power that so frequently
mystified those who came in contact with him.
After leaving Syria he traveled through many of the coun-

blood, had kept fully informed of his training and abilities,
arranged to have the Marquis de Bcllisle * invite Saint Germain
to France, where he was introduced to the Marquise de Pompa-

Saint Germain had many bitter enemies. In almost all in-
stances this was not because of anything he did, or did not do,
but because he was accepted into circles closed to most of the
others, and because of his close, aye, secret relations with per-
sonages of high position in many countries; from France to
Russia, from Russia to the Orient, all of whom had implicit
confidence in him. Even his worst enemies never accused him
of betraying confidences. These confidences and friendly re-
lationships among rulers of the world caused bitter jealousies
and there was an effort to destroy not only these close con-
nections, but the man himself; hence the bitter vilification. As
an example of the deep feeling for him, le Landgrave Charles,
Prince de Hesse—Memoirs de Man Temps., said of him: "He

Such, in truth, was this great Master and Philosophic Initi-

greatness in the Arcane is in the fact that he never spoke of his

Neophytes, or admitted into the Arcane society, he carefully
chose his disciples according to temperament and an inner
something he felt, and then exacted absolute obedience on their

this is the ultimate to which man might attain, he sought to
have each one of his Neophytes become a member of a Royal
order; the Royalty of Initiation, a Priest of Melchisedek, some-
thing which would brook neither opposition nor disobedience.
"It is your mission to become as a torch [a Light] unto
the world. If your Light is that only of a planet, you will
be as nothing in the sight of God, but if your Light is like
that of the sun, then you will be as a Light amongst men.

In hypnosis it has been proven possible that the activity of
the human mechanism [heart beat and breathing] can be re-
duced to a minimum—fully one-third or less of the usual activ-
ity. The Magnetists and Mesmerists of that day proved beyond
a doubt that they were capable of a form of self-hypnosis
which permitted them to do this for themselves. This was
frequently denied, but modern experiments prove that this is
possible. Saint Germain was capable of bringing about such a
state within himself whenever he was physically inactive. This
reduced physical wear and tear, moreover and in addition to
this, he taught his Neophytes that which moderns are now only
beginning to understand slightly:
"The life of man may be of a duration much longer than
suspected by the mass. It is the activity of the nervous
system, the strain put upon it, the flame of our [debasing—
unholy—unconstructive] desires the [corrosive] acidity
created by our fears, which consume our vitality and age
our appearance. He who succeeds in raising himself above
his emotions, subjecting them to control, supressing anger,
or transmuting it before it has its effects upon the self, and
replacing fear by hopeful faith, will be capable of over-

the human mechanism [heart beat and breathing] can be re-
duced to a minimum-fully one-third or less of the usual activ-
ity. The Magnetists and Mesmerises of that day proved beyond
a doubt that they were capable of a form of self-hypnosis
which permitted them to do this for themselves. This was
frequently denied, but modern experiments prove that this is
possible. Saint Germain was capable of bringing about such a
state within himself whenever he was physically inactive. This
reduced physical wear and tear, moreover and in addition to
this, he taught his Neophytes that which moderns are now only
begimtlng to understand slightly:
"The life of man may be of a duration much longer than
suspected by the mass. It is the activity of the nervous
system, the strain put upon it, the fitrme of our [debasing-
unholy-unconstructive] desires the [corrosive] acidity
created by our fears, which consume our vitality and age
our appearance. He who succeeds in raising himself above
his emotions, subjecting them to control, supressing anger,
or transmuting it before it has its effects upon the self, and
replacing fear by hopeful faith, will be capable of over-

coming the ravages of time and be able to attain an age
double that usual among men and yet appear more or less
youthful."
Even in his advanced years Saint Germain appeared youthful
and herein he reveals the secret, but there is a coordinating
secret which even Saint Germain did not understand, though
it was operative. It is a secret becoming more and more known
to all Endocrinologists and it is this:
Man in his entirety is governed by the functioning of
his glands; while his glands in turn are governed by his
emotions and passions. The passions activate or inflame the
glands, bringing about disease on the one hand, and quickly
using up vital energy on the other. MAN MAY LIVE A
MONTH, OR EVEN A YEAR, ALL WITHIN THE CONFINES OF AN
HOUR, AS THE RESULT OF EXTREME ANGER, HATE, MALICE,
RESENTMENT, OR FEAR OF ANY ONE THING. Saint Germain's
philosophy governed his action and saved himself from
this waste. The years passed without leaving their impres-
sion upon his features because these passions were under
control. All of the Initiate Magnetists and Mesmerists of
Saint Germain's day were taught the secret of the power
of control or transmutation of the passions, not as an En-
docrinological activity, but as a Mystic Arcane; the end
aimed at was the same.
Until the age of forty, practically all of Saint Germain's time
was devoted to the study of languages, chemistry, Alchemy,
the Arcane science and travel. This includes the application of
the Arcane to his own spiritual development on the one hand,
and on the other, diplomacy, statesmanship and the manners
of the Court and his personal friends; men of the world who
were from almost every Court in Europe, more especially so,
from the Courts of Austria, Hungary, Italy and Persia.
Prior to 1750 he also visited Holland, England and other
countries, and made himself familiar with life at these Courts.

To fully comprehend how it was possible for the almost

mind a number of things:
(1) A great many of the Priests and Monks were secretly
engaged in the study and practice of Alchemy and the Arcane
science. In many instances the Occult received as much, or
more time and attention than the church itself. Because it was
highly dangerous for any member of the church to be so
engaged, the strongest possible oath of secrecy, the penalty of
which for infringement was death and the total destruction of
the Soul, was required of all who were accepted into the Occult
Priestly Order.
(2) The entire structure of Society, in both France, Italy
and other European countries, was morally decadent to the
lowest degree and this had its effect on Priests and laity alike.
(3) The Dogmas of the church, because of the moral laxity
within the church and the barbarous brutality of the Inquisi-
tion, were being attacked and laid bare by the learned men of
that age, irrespective of church affiliation.

laxity, there was a deep undercurrent of spiritual desire. This

cycle to follow. During this period, European immorality and
honor became so low that it was no longer known as an
immoral age, but an un moral age. This had its reaction in the
activity of mysticism, followed by the Victorian era which
resulted in actual prudery, itself setting in an age of ignorance
relative to the all-important problems of sex.

(5) Monasteries, in many parts of Europe, more especially
in France, Germany, and the more Northern countries, became
honey-combed with occult activities and those engaged in these
studies held them as above their fealty to Rome. It was in such
an age and such an atmosphere that Cagliostro was born.
Cagliostro was fortunate in that: (a) His father, though a
priest, was far advanced in the Arcane; (b) That deep love
existed between his father and the woman who was to be his
mother; (c) That though the greatest secrecy had to be main-
tained for their own honor; the honor of their houses and of
the church, nevertheless they desired that the result of the
indiscretion should see the light of day.
Here again there is a contradiction we must recognize: How
can love and honor be reconciled under such conditions? In the
Mysteries it has always been held that true love, being of God,
is greater than all else; that that which is conceived in love,
is pure, therefore immaculate; that evil enters only when the
basis is lust and when the fruit of the creative act is destroyed
because of fear or shame. None of this was true in the present
instance. Love was the basis of the action of the twain and
Cagliostro was conceived in that love union.
The brother of the young priest was a member of the
new Templars, offspring of the proscribed Templars of early
times. He also was high in the church, with powerful con-
nections at a Convent-Orphanage in France, a member of
one of the larger churches to which a number of Arcane
students belonged. For these reasons it was not difficult for
a young lady, a Princess, to enter the convent, ostensibly as
a student in as far as the outside world was concerned, and
it was here that the young Cagliostro was born, and pro-
tected under the Vow which these Neophytes had assumed.
The record of the Fraternitas is not at all secretive regarding
the parentage of Cagliostro, nor of the name of the Convent-
Orphanage. When Cagliostro himself became a Neophyte,
he assumed the same vow to remain forever unknown, except

(5) Monasteries, in many parts of Europe, more especially
in France, Germany, and the more Northern countries, became
honey-combed with occult activities and those engaged in these
studies held them as above their fealty to Rome. It was in such

it was here that the young Cagliostro was born, and pro-
tected under the Vow which these Neophytes had assumed.
The record of the Fraternitas is not at all secretive regarding

Orphanagc. When Cagliostro himself became a Neophyte,
he assumed the same vow to remain forever unknown, except

to Initiates; a responsibility that his Master St. Germain had
assumed, and by his own right he demanded of the brethren
that they also should forever keep his secret.
Later, after Cagliostro had attained to manhood, he, like
his uncle, became a member of the new, hidden Order of
Templars, imbued with the idea that the time for a great
social change had come. The Initiates were to set up a new
Hierarchy which had in mind the idea of rejuvenating society
by a change of standards which would bring about a fair
adjustment between the poorer and richer classes. This was
to be brought about not by a division of things possessed by
the rich or more favored—which, in fact, would be robbery,
a grosser term for confiscation—but offering all an opportu-
nity, whereby through their own efforts they might improve
their position in life and society to any degree they desired.
These men, often priests high in the church, but Initiates
nevertheless, could correctly read the handwriting on the
wall of time. They were enthusiasts [Randolph said: "En-
thusiasts are the Ambassadors of God"] indefatigable and fear-
less in spreading the doctrine for both the physical and moral
regeneration of mankind. Among these were the father and
some relatives of Cagliostro, who inherited their love for

to Initiates; a responsibility that his Master St. Germain had
assumed, and by his own right he demanded of the brethren
that they also should forever keep his secret.
Later, after Cagliostro had attained to manhood, he, like
his uncle, became a member of the new, hidden Order of
Templars, imbued with the idea that the time for a great
social change had come. The Initiates were to set up a new
Hierarchy which had in mind the idea of rejuvenating society
by a change of standards which would bring about a fair
adjustment between the poorer and richer classes. This was
to be brought about not by a division of things possessed by
the rich or more favored-which, in fact, would be robbery,
a grosser term for confiscation-but offering all an opportu-
nity, whereby through their own efforts they might improve
their position in life and society to any degree they desired.
These men, often priests high in the church, but Initiates
nevertheless, could correctly read the handwriting on the
wall of time. They were enthusiasts [Randolph said: "En-
thusiasts are the Ambassadors of God"] indefatigable and fear-
less in spreading the doctrine for both the physical and moral
regeneration of mankind. Among these were the father and
some relatives of Cagliostro, who inherited their love for
the Arcane and became co-worker.
It is natural, and in full accord with the law of Duality,
that alongside, taking step by step with these heralds of a
new age, there should be quacks, charlatans, impostors and
actual criminals posing as fellow-workers, and reaping the
ill-gotten benefits for the work done by those sincere and
earnest in their desire to improve the race. The greatest ex-
ample of the period of both, Initiate and criminal-charlatan,
is Cagliostro on the one side, and Balsamo on the other.
Cagliostro was free from accusation of other than that which
is usually expected by one who embraces the Arcane, until
as late as June 21, 1786, when one Theveneau de Morande,
publisher of Courrier de l'Europe, in London, used his publi-

cation to claim that Cagliostro was the infamous charlatan
and swindler, Balsamo. Another instance is that of Carlyle,
which should also have consideration.
Who was Morande,8 the editor of Le Courrier?
Theveneau de Morande was one of the greatest black-
mailers and general "bad men" of the last quarter of the
eighteenth century. He was the son of a lawyer at Arnay-le-Duc
in Burgundy, where he was born in 1741. According to M.
Paul Robiquet, from the day of consciousness to his death,
he was utterly without scruples, definitely bad, even for that
day. When still a youth he was arrested for theft in a house
of ill-fame. Compelled to enlist or be sent to prison, he chose
the former alternative, but did not serve long. His father
obtained his release on condition that he reform. Instead of
returning home as he had promised, Morande went to Paris,
where his dissolute life led him to the prison of For-1'Eveque.
On being released two years later at the age of twenty-four,
he assaulted one of the principal members of the Government
and fled the country. After some time in Belgium, he left
for London, where he arrived in dire want. This was not
for long. It soon became apparent to him that he might readily
extort money by threatening to inform police of the various
illegal acts of acquaintances he chanced to meet and this de-
veloped into a regular system of blackmail which he regularly
followed.
Morande was the original blackmailing gangster, seller of
"protection," and evil incarnate; his "sons" being predomi-
nantly active today in America. Highly gifted with a talent
for writing, he made use of it by attacking notabilities. In Le
Gazetier Cuirasse, ou Anecdotes scandaleuses sur la cour de
France, he pounced, as a vulture does on carrion, on all who
refused to purchase exemption, and represented them in the
worst possible light. For this work, which Brissot describes as

"Made bold and more criminally minded by the fright he
inspired, he redoubled his attacks, but these did not always
meet with the same success. He was even so bold as to try
to extort a sum of money from Voltaire, who refused to
be terrorized or victimized, and instead of paying, published
Morande's letter. Morande also tried to blackmail the Comte

What manner of judgment is it
•Carlyle was bitterly opposed, even as much as was Rome, against all
forms of Masonry. He was incapable of differentiating between one form
or another, aJJ that was Masonic was bad.
•Here is an open admission th~t he did not base his judgment of
Cagliostro on the results of an investigation made by himself, as one
would expect uf all fair-minded men, but on the opinions of others.
After Carlyle's great works are forgotten, this unfairness on his part
will continue to be remembered and it, instead of his works, will be a
monument to him. It is almost unbelievable that otherwise great men
can be capable of such baseness, biasedness and injustice; it is one of the
basic reasons why there is so much of "man's inhumanity to man" in
the world. Carlyle's acts remind us of a like injustice on the pan of one
of America's otherwise great men, i.e., Theodore Roosevelt, who, for
no apparent reason, called the real father of America, Thomas Paine, a

when a great man says of another: "The man is a shameless
liar. If he has been shamelessly lied about in turn, he has only
gotten what he deserved." He pronounced the judgment of
"lies," NOT by what he knew, but by what others had said.
Carlyle did not stop here but termed Cagliostro a "King
of Liars," a "Prince of Scoundrels," an "Arch-Quack," "Count
Front of Brass-Pinchbeckotrum," "Bubby-jock," "a babbling,
bubbling Turkey-cock," etc., etc.
As with Morande, so with Carlyle, the mass of writers who
followed these have been guilty of the same error; they ac-
cepted the words of other men as truth and repeated them
to the detriment of the man they wrote about. History will
forgive men who make mistakes, but it is seldom kind to the
man, or the men who defame others without first making a
thorough investigation to arrive at the truth. The great guilt
exists in the fact that Carlyle accepted as gospel what others
said. He was self-righteous about it, and as said before, those
who would appear as friends of Cagliostro, or followers of
his philosophy, are as guilty as Carlyle and Morande, if they
believe the written falsehoods and circulate them as facts.
However, as Paracelsus, the "great Quack," has been vindi-
cated, so is Cagliostro gradually being separated from Balsamo
and the tales told by those who hated him for political or
religious reasons, or because they had benefited at his expense
without repaying, are being exposed as falsehoods.
The vilest and most infamous accusation of all, and one
without the slightest foundation, was that he had commercial-
ized his wife. This, in the first instance, was due to Morande's
stupidity or maliciousness in associating Cagliostro with Bal-
anyone else, gave birth to the Liberty of men, not alone in America, but
likewise in France.
Paine was no more an atheist than Cagliostro was a charlatan. When
all the good deeds of Roosevelt are forgotten, this expression of bigotry
and bias will stand against him. Paine was an agnost1c, but not by any
means an atheist.

marriage impossible, and with him as in a few known
other instances, such as Paracelsus and Lawrence of Arabia,
the creative forces were turned inward and he developed
a second nature. These forces that would ordinarily have
been employed in an exterior creative nature and for per-
sonal pleasure, were turned inward and upward, and by
this was developed an Occult, Arcane, and healing power.
Among the Philosophic Initiates by whom he was instructed
and with whom he associated, there was one who had a
daughter very much gifted in the mystic, who avoided in
general the frivolous things of life. These Brethren of Light

most desirable companion for Cagliostro. An arrangement was
made for them to meet and through this meeting a life-long
affection was born.

Cagliostro, due to the accident, could never fulfill the duties
of a husband; [b] that due to this there would be no offspring;
[c] that in the work for which nature had endowed him it
would be necessary for him to have a virgin companion to
see (or skry)8, and be his spiritual eyes; [d] that he could not
be otherwise than virgin and as long as she remained virgin
the union would last. The young lady accepted the conditions
and in due time they were married, were companions in study,
work and travel, sharing pleasures and sorrows in common.
It is at once apparent to every one who has the slightest
knowledge of the Arcane, that Cagliostro, even if he were
utterly selfish, would make every effort to keep his wife a
virgin, because his continued success depended upon her re-
maining so.
'The word "skrying" is not generally known in America, except to
the highest Initiates, nor is the method much used, there being too many
difficult aspects to it and the conditions required too intricate.

marriage impossible, and with him as in a few known
other instances, such as Paracelsus and Lawrence of Arabia,
the creative forces were tumed inward and he developed
a second nature. These forces that would ordinarily have
been employed in an exterior creative nature and for per-
sonal pleasure, were turned inward and upward, and by
this was developed an Occult, Arcane, and healing power.
Among the Philosophic Initiates by whom he was instructed
and with whom he associated, there was one who had a
daughter very much gifted in the mystic, who avoided in
general the frivolous things of life. These Brethren of Light
felt that this girl, none other than Seraphina, would be the
most desirable companion for Cagliostro. An arrangement was
made for them to meet and through this meeting a life-long
affection was born.

be otherwise than virgin and as long as she remained virgin

and in due time they were married, were companions in study,

BOOK OF ROSICRUCLE 49
None of those who so blatantly wrote about Cagliostro,
whether friend or enemies, ever accused him of being inti-
mate with women. They simply did not think such a thing
possible. That in itself would have appeared peculiar. The
reason was simple and apparent to those who had eyes to see:
his appearance became effeminate, as were his actions, and as
a result, he was not associated with women. Women, on the
contrary, judged this to be an innate refinement and many
of those who consulted him, especially women of refinement,
"fell in love" with him. When their advances were discour-
aged by him for a very good reason but known only to him-
self and his wife, they took it as scorn. This explains why
most of his bitterest enemies were women of high station
whom he had benefited, but refused to court. No doubt he
often thought "hell hath no fury like that of a woman
scorned," but could do nothing to vindicate himself in their
eyes.
In his magical seances, as they were generally known, Cag-
liostro made use of one of three mediums; a young boy
[pupille], a young girl [colombe] of virgin innocence, or
more often, his wife. In public it was most frequently a young
boy or girl, in private it was always his wife. Whomsoever
he selected was asked to kneel in front of a globe of jet black
ink, or of crystal pure water, placed upon a table covered with
a black cloth, embroidered with Rosicrucian symbols. Caglio-
stro would then make mesmeric or Magnetic passes, seem-
ingly to summon angels of the sphere to appear, whereupon
the youthful skryer (seer) would, if a sensitive, behold the
vision that would appear to view, describe events taking place
at a distance, or describe diseased organs and the required
remedies to heal. In their private seance Cagliostro and his
wife would most frequently use an Indian Batteh of fabulous
value which never saw light and which no one dared to touch
except those who used it.

Lang, the great traveller, and others.
Persons of a sensitive nature, a neurosis from one cause or
another7 or those Magnetized, may develop temporary or
constant clairvoyant powers, and these may be directed at Will
by the experienced operator. Cagliostro was a born, a devel-
oped, an accomplished Mesmerist and Magnetist of the highest

he so desired, momentarily or for a prolonged period, bring

Occult world is aware of the fact that Marie Corelli was
developed in this manner.
Much of what is written about Cagliostro and the mirror

Madame du Barry, which is actually based on an experiment
by Cagliostro with Giovanna Barberini of Italy, in the pres-

Another accusation hurled against Cagliostro, or claims
made for him by idolatrous worshippers among the different
cults who actually knew nothing at all about him, is, that he
claimed or pretended to have lived centuries, and that he was

Cagliostro was the heir and successor to both Saint Ger-

Alepb, an image of the union between the passive and the
active, the spirit of life, Will and Light. The arrow that of
Apollo, while the serpent is the python of fable, the green
dragon of Hermetic philosophy. The letter Alepb is symbolic

ease. On the other hand, he experienced great sorrow and
much suffering and was constantly vilified by those who were
unable to bend him to their Will, help them satisfy their lusts
or make of him a companion in fulfilment of unholy desires.

imprisonment by Pope VI.

LaFayette was a member of the
Guards and Captain of dragons when
independence was declared. At heart he
was not a Royalist and because of this
dad when very young. It was at the
Lodge Humanidad1 that LaFayette be-
came acquainted with Franklin and
learned all about the new country
across the sea and what its people had in mind. He was so fired
with this new thought for freedom that he not only volun-
teered to go to America to help, but proceeded to fit out
a ship in order to proceed westward and give his aid.
The British ambassador at Versailles learned of the project.
At his insistence orders were issued to seize the ship, and La
Fayette was arrested. The ship was sailed out of Bordeaux to
a port in Spain. LaFayette escaped from custody in disguise,
and before he could be appreheneded he had set sail. His ship
landed at Georgetown, S. C., and he at once proceeded to
Philadelphia.
LaFayette, though but eighteen before he left France, had
been promised a commission as major-general. On his arrival
jealousies were aroused among officers that a mere youth

ARQUIS DE LA FAYETIE, as he is generally known, Philo-

LaFayette was a member of the
Guards and Captain of dragons when
independence was declared. At heart he
was not a Royalist and because of this
he had become a member of Humani-
dad when very young. It was at the
Lodge Humanidad1
that LaFayette be-
~ came acquainted with Franklin and
learned all about the new country
across the sea and what its people had in mind. He was so fired
with this new thought for freedom that he not only volun-
teered to go to America to help, but proceeded to fit out
a ship in order to proceed westward and give his aid.
The British ambassador at Versailles learned of the project.
At his insistence orders were isrued to seize the ship, and La
Fayette was arrested. The ship was sailed out of Bordeaux to
a port in Spain. LaFayette escaped from custody in disguise,
and before he could be appreheneded he had set sail. His ship
landed at Georgetown, S. C., and he at once proceeded to
Philadelphia.
LaFayette, though but eighteen before he left France, had
been promised a commission as major-general. On his arrival
jealousies were aroused among officers that a mere youth
should be so honored. To avoid unpleasantness he volunteered

his valor and passed a resolution "that his services be accepted,
and that, in consideration of his zeal, illustrous family [and
influence in France], he receive the rank and commission of
major-general of the United States."
The day after receiving his commission he met Washing-
ton and they became fast friends. His first battle was at Brandy-
wine where he was wounded. After recovery he was given
command of a division. Early in 1778 he commanded troops
detailed for a proposed expedition against Canada, and in June,
1778, he fought at the battle of Monmouth and received formal
recognition for his valor, from Congress.
When the treaties for Commerce and defensive alliance
were signed by America and France on February 6, 1778,
and a declaration of war against France was declared by Eng-
land, LaFayette requested leave to return to France to con-
sult with the King. This was granted and he returned to France
and at once was made a Colonel in the French Army. After
six months he again returned to America, but after the battle
of Yorktown his military career ended in the United States.
He once more returned to France, where he occupied him-
self with the preparations for an expedition against the British
West Indian Islands, but this was not realized because of the
armistice between England and France. He was now promoted
to the rank of major-general in the French army. In 1784 he
revisited the United States in his military capacity, but more
especially to sit in the Council of Seven of the Fraternitas,
a continuation of the 1774 session,' and to consult with Thomas
Paine, like himself, a Friend of Freedom.

in France and of the fight for freedom that was to follow. He

was whole-heartedly in sympathy with the miseries of the
people but, like others of the Friends of Freedom, he believed
it might be accomplished without bloodshed and in peace.
With this in mind, he took his seat in the Assembly of Not-
ables in 1787. As a leader of the inner group of which Humani-
dad was the organization, he demanded, and himself signed the
demand, that the King convoke the States-General. As a result
of this demand he became the leader in the French revolu-
tion. Less than two years thereafter he was elected to the
States-General and chosen vice-president of the National As-
sembly. On July n, 1789, he presented a declaration of rights,
modelled on the Declaration of Independence written by
Thomas Jefferson. LaFayette was now chosen by acclama-

the red, blue and white, into the tricolor cockade of modern
France. For three years LaFayette was France. Had the con-

made to suffer for his efforts in behalf of the people.
In the Constituent Assembly he pleaded for the abolition
of arbitrary imprisonment; for true—not artificial—religious
tolerance, having in mind the conflict between the church,
Masonry, the Templars and the outer activities of the Philo-
sophic Initiates; he desired actual representation by the peo-
ple; the establishment of trial by jury; for the emancipation
of slaves; the freedom of the press, and the suppression of
all special privileges. This was according to the terms of the
charter written by Paine. During February, 1790, he refused
the supreme command of the National Guard of the kingdom

as very dangerous to the welfare of France and the people
themselves.
While LaFayette was what today is known as a liberal, he
was in no sense a radical, believed in change by means of Law
and order, and acted accordingly, frequently standing almost
alone. In July, 1790, on the first anniversary of the destruction
of the Bastille, he took a prominient part in the celebration.
In April of 1791 he acted to suppress an uprising and then
resigned his commission, but was again compelled by circum-
stances to reaccept it.
When Louis XVI fled to Varennes it was LaFayette who
gave orders to stop him, though later he admitted it might have
been better had lie been allowed to pass. He was now made
lieutenant-general of the army, but shortly again had to com-
mand the troops to suppress another uprising when the con-
stitution was proclaimed September 18, 1790. He now foresaw
what was certain to follow and wanting no part of it, he
resigned.
However, "Man proposes, God disposes." When late in
1791, three armies were formed to attack Austria, LaFayette
was called upon to command one of them, and feeling that
as a loyal Frenchman this was a duty, he accepted the com-
mand, with the plan in mind that eventually th1s army might
be used in creating a limited monarchy.
For all his loyalty to France and his constant service to the
people, The Assembly declared him a traitor to France on
August 19, 1792. LaFayette now fled to Liege, whence he was
one of the prime movers in the Revolution, was taken and
held as a prisoner for five years; first in Prussian and later in
Austrian prisons. Later Napoleon, then still a co-member of
the new Society of 1789, and a Friend of Freedom, in the
treaty of Campo Formio, demanded LaFayette's release.

Shortly thereafter Napoleon foreswore his allegiance to
The Friends of Freedom, the Fraternitas and L'Ordre du Lis,
the desire for Kingship having replaced his ideals for a free
people of whom he would be the leader. LaFayette, as a mem-
ber of these inner circles was aware of this and in 1802 voted
against the life consulate for Napoleon, and again in 1804
voted against the imperial title. He divorced himself entirely
from public life under the Empire but again became active
under the First Restoration and from 1818 to 1824 was the
deputy for the Sarthe, always working on the Freemeti's side.
LaFayette once again visited America and took part in the
deliberations of the Council of Seven in the same manner he
always did in France.
Up to this period the number of the members of the
Council were predominently English. From this period on
the number of French members increased while the number
of English members decreased and allegiance, by permission of
the Supreme Grand Dome of England, shifted to France.
LaFayette was a true Unknown (Inconnu) and no one other
than the members of the Council, was aware of his various
Arcane connections.
He once again returned to America, and America as a whole
received him with open arms. On his return to France in
1825 and until his death, he was a member of the Chamber
of Deputies for Meaux. All in all, the end of his life was far
more pleasant than that of his fellow member and worker,
Thomas Paine, who, in truth, was the father of both the Re-
publics of America and France.
LaFayette remained active in the Councils of the Frater-
nitas in France, and of America, and L'Ordre du Lis, until
his death on May 20, 1834.

It was after he had become a deacon that, because of his
sensitive nature and active mind, he became vitally conscious
of the injustices then rampant among men, and the lack of
spirituality among the priestly class. His thoughts and experi-
ences in this respect were parallel with those of the life and
thoughts of George Lippard in America, and almost at exactly
the same time.
This was an age of extreme selfishness; of total disregard
for the welfare of others. Materialism was the dominating
factor everywhere. The spiritual aspect of the church, recog-

accepted "better class," with the result that atheism held sway.

that, for the time being at least, he lost practically all interest
in his duties to the church, while the church lost its hold upon
him.

Lippard's dynamic writings soon took the world by storm

Besides being the age of selfish materialism, it was also the

have more completely enslaved the bodies and Souls of men
than Capitalism ever did.
Levi in France, had already become conversant with the
philosophy of Andrea as outlined in his Christianopolis, and
he was both ready and eager to accept Lippard's severe con-

familiar manner: 'My dear Mr. Constant, I am delighted to
find you at home.' After this he passed into my study, as if it
were his own home, and took a seat in my armchair. 'But, sir,'
I said, 'I do not recollect seeing you.' He laughed with pleas-
ure. 'This is the first time you see me, at least in this form,
but I know you wellL. I know everything about your past,
present and future life. It is ruled by the inexorable law of
numbers. You are the man of the Pentagram," and the years
marked by the number "five", have always been fatal to you.
Look back and recollect. Your mortal life started in 1815, your
memory failing to recollect beyond that. In 1825 you entered
the Seminary. In 1835 you left the Seminary and entered the
freedom of consciousness. In 1845 you published The Mother
of God, your first essay of religion, and you broke your con-
nection with the church. In 1855 you were a free man, being
deserted by a woman who had absorbed you and forced you
to submit to the law of "Binaire." You then went to England.
You were there to dive in the masculine and active principles.
It was there you saw Appolonius, sad, tired and suffering like
yourself, because the Appolonius that you saw was YOURSELF
—a phantom that came out of yourself, again became a part
of you and still is with you. You will again see him in 1865,
but then beautiful, radiant and triumphant. The natural end
of your life is marked as 1875 [as is mine], accidents aside.
Apollonius, when you saw him, he was afraid of the point
of your sword. You are afraid of it now, just as at the present
moment you consider me a lunatic and, as such, have come
with the idea of murdering you. . . .'" Much more did Ran-
dolph tell Levi, all of which came true.
Levi quickly became a convert to these teachings and then,
as a climax, he was introduced to the teachings of Wronski
[Hoene], who himself had accepted the Mystic Pierre Simon
1 After the manner of Ravalette.
'So impressed was Levi that he adopted the Pentagram as his seal. This
was part of his Initiation.

present and future life. It is ruled by the inexorable law of
numbers. You are the man of the Pentagram,2
and the years
marked by the number "five", have always been fatal to you.
Look back and recollect. Your mortal life started in 1815, your
memory failing to recollect beyond that. In 18z5 you entered
the Seminary. In 1835 you left the Seminary and entered the
freedom of consciousness. In 1845 you published The Mother
of God, your first essay of religion, and you broke your con-
nection with the church. In 1855 you were a free man, being
deserted by a woman who had absorbed you and forced you
to submit to the law of "Binaire." You then went to England.
You were there to dive in the masculine and active principles.
It was there you saw Appolonius, sad, tired and suffering like
yourself, because the Appolonius that you saw was YOURSELF
-a phantom that came out of yourself, again became a part
of you and still is with you. You will again see him in 1865,
but then beautiful, radiant and triumphant. The natural end
of your life is marked as 1875 [as is mine], accidents aside.
Apollonius, when you saw him, he was afraid of the point
of your sword. You are afraid of it now, just as at the present
moment you consider me a lunatic and, as such, have come
with the idea of murdering you....' " Much more did Ran-
dolph tell Levi, all of which came true.
Levi quickly became a convert to these teachings and then,
as a climax, he was introduced to the teachings of Wronski
[Herne], who himself had accepted the Mystic Pierre Simon
' After the manner of R.avalette.

So impressed was Levi that he adopted the Pentagram as his seal. This
was part of his Initiation.

Bel lane he as a protype of what the spiritual [Initiate] man
should be.
With such a foundation one can readily see, as in a mirror,
the medium of Levi's Philosophic Initiation. Acceptance of
these Philosophic teachings brought about a conflict that con-
stantly raged in the person of Levi; the bond that tied him
to the church on the one side, and on the other, his spiritual
concepts, not to mention his duties to his fellow men.
For a time after Levi's conversion to the Arcane science
he continued his duties to the church, but as he gained in
spiritual insight, the hold of the church upon him weakened,
though it was never entirely dissolved. Then, another ele-
ment entered the battle-fray. Levi fell in love with a young girl
of sixteen and, giving but little thought to the bonds of the
church that still held him, they ran away and were married.
As a result of this marriage3 two children were born. The
marriage quickly proved an unhappy one. The conflict be-
tween the various forces within Levi was not conducive to
make him a young, ardent, self-sacrificing lover, except at
short intervals, and the twain quickly grew apart, with the
result that, on the grounds of being a minor, his wife obtained
a divorce.
1 Much has been made by profane writers who understand little of the
Arcane science, of this marriage and nearly all, if not all, have made it
appear that Levi had actually entered a solemn vow of celibacy. His vow
was little more than a promise, and this is clearly indicated by the fact
that the church received him back time and again. He never was excom-
municated by the church.
Equally much has been made of the fact that though Levi had entered
the church and became a deacon, he nevertheless embraced occultism.
These forget that many of the great Philosophic Initiates who became
founders of the Fraternitas were actually monks, abbots and priests.
His marriage and return to the church at numerous times is nothing
more than an indication of certain weaknesses present in his personality.
It can truthfully be admitted that all men are more or less weak. Were
this not so, they would be gods; taken to heaven in a Chariot of Fire;
being too good and too fine for this mundane sphere.

smallest part of it, for selfish purposes. It is a Magical force,
but not per se Magic, because it is based on exact Law. The
method of its development and use is orderly and exact.
The spirit of the Arcane science is to recognize that there
are two forces constantly in operation; one good, i.e., con-
structive, ever directing upwards; the other destructive, i.e.,
evil, impressing or depressing downward. The Great Work of
the Philosophic Initiate is to teach Acolytes that evil of itself,
has no existence; that it is a perversion or misuse of good, and
that every effort is to be made to replace that which has be-
come evil by misuse, with that which is good or constructive.
The Law; "Resist not evil," is not to fight evil, but to replace
it, avoiding the loss of power as a result of conflict in resisting.
Man is capable of attaining super-power, not as a result of
directing a magical force not based on order, but by bringing
into activity the unlimited, though dormant, God-like poten-
tialities and possibilities resident within himself. If he obeyed
the Laws taught by Arcane science, then the sleeping Eros

the experiments made by them cojointly.

That there are contradictions in the writings of Levi is
readily admitted. This is equally true of the writings of all of
the true Philosophic Initiates and is deliberate (a) to hide
identities; (b) to at once interpret the esoteric or Arcane
teachings for the Initiated and (c) to hide the mysteries from
the eyes of the vulgar. For a classic example of this manner of
writing and teaching we need only refer to the work of the
Master, the Nazarene who did not hesitate a moment to say:
Unto you it is given to know the mysteries
of the kingdom of God: but to others in
parables; that seeing they might not see,
and hearing they might not understand.—
St. Luke 8:10.
Levi always and whole-heartedly concurred with the basic
Land Mark of the Fraternitas and these in turn were accepted
by all who followed him:
"The Rosy Cross does not proselyte or advertise. It is
content with opening their always restricted circles* to
students of good Will, and offer them, together with the
necessary guides, the means of penetrating into the domain
of esoteric science."
It gives students a rule of conduct capable of leading
them to a certain serenity, through the labyrinth of human
experiences. The Rosy Cross has no need of a support ex-
terior to itself, because it possesses in itself the fullness of

Randolph: Ravallette and The Rosicrucian's Story.
That there are contradictions in the writings of Levi is
readily admitted. This is equally true of the writings of all of
the true Philosophic Initiates and is deliberate (a) to hide
identities; (b) to at once interpret the esoteric or Arcane
teachings for the Initiated and (c) to bide the mysteries from
the eyes of the vulgar. For a classic example of this manner of
writing and teaching we need only refer to the work of the
Master, the Nazarene who did not hesitate a moment to say:
Unto you it is given to know the mysteries
of the kingdom of God: but to others in
parables; that seeing they might not see,
and hearing they might not understand.-
St. Luke 8: 10.
Levi always and whole-heartedly concurred with the basic
Land Mark of the Fraternitas and these in tum were accepted
by all who followed him:
"The Rosy Cross does not proselyte or advertise. It is
content with opening their always restricted circles 8
to
students of good Will, and offer them, together with the
necessary guides, the means of penetrating into the domain
of esoteric science."
It gives students a rule of conduct capable of leading
them to a certain serenity, through the labyrinth of human
experiences. The Rosy Cross has no need of a support ex-
terior to itself, because it possesses in itself the fullness of

present volume.

the Arcane science, but it is, nevertheless, the receptacle
and the dispenser of the Ineffable Light. The result of this
state is an inviolate silence.
Randolph said the same thing in a few words readily
understood: "He who knows does not talk; he who talks
does not know," and again: "Babblers do not become Initi-
ates [Masters]," for the "Loose tongue runs away with
itself."
In 1850, General Hitchcock, Hermetic and Alchemical Initi-
ate of the Highest degree, a member of the same esoteric Fra-
ternity of which Davidson, who became instructor and guide
to Papus who later became a Supreme Grand Master, went to
Paris to prepare for Levi's induction into the Temple as a
Philosophic Initiate, as a member of the Council of Three and,
if finally proven worthy, to become the Supreme Grand
Master of the Supreme Grand Dome of the Fraternitas Roste
Crucis. Levi did not fail those who had selected and sponsored
him for the high office and he became the Supreme Grand
Master in 1856.
General Hitchcock had looked forward to the time when Dr.
Randolph should become Supreme Grand Master of the Fra-
ternitas Ros<e Crucis of the Western world and the Isles of the
Sea and arrangements were completed which had already been
started by members of the Grand Council some years prior to
Levi's completion of the Philosophic work, and only the final
arrangements were necessary. This induction took place in
Paris in 1858 and on his return from Paris, Randolph and the
Council of Three, in conjunction with the members of the
Council of Seven, General Hitchcock presiding, the Supreme
Grand Lodge of the Western world and Isles of the Sea, was
founded and became active as the supreme Western authority.

During this visit, Lord Lytton, the Comte Branicki and his
brother Alexander, began the experiments, the results of which,
together with the Kabbalistic teachings of Levi, were incor-
porated in Lytton's book The Coming Race, published in 1871.
Of the mysteries of these experiments, Levi makes mention in
his Dogma and Ritual, (P. 271) stating that (these Kabbalistic
secrets), could, if made known to the world, change com-
pletely the very foundation of the laws of society.

giving a series of lectures on Rosicrucian Philosophy, much as
Levi was conducting classes in Magic (the Kabbala). Randolph
delivered these lessons in preparation for his trip to Greece,
Egypt, Turkey, Arabia and Madagascar to study the origin of
man and collect material for his work on Pre-Adamite Man.
He was met in San Francisco by a Philosophic Initiate, member
of the World Council and of the Council of Three from

cessor, as Supreme Grand Master of the Fraternitas. The Mar-
quis so informed by Levi strongly demurred as he did not
wish to become generally known, but sought to teach only
by means of his publications. A compromise was reached by
the understanding between them that as soon as another Philo-
sophic Initiate had attained sufficiently to become a full mem-

prepared by those active beginning with the Marquis D'Alvcydre, we
have consulted with Mme. J. Bricaud, the wife of the former Supreme

upon a basis of exact equality to all, UPON THE RESPONSIBILITY
OF ALL, and wholly opposed to sectarianism. He was an idealist
in that he foresaw a period when those selected to represent
the people would be agents of a National Conscience based
in an Universal [Free to all] Religion.
His Mission of the Jews has as an object the reconciliation
of Science with every form of Religion. The author causes to
enter again into the framework of the Judeo-Christian Tradi-
tion, the principal acquisition of modern science, illustrating
science's insufficiency and lack of balance by its disdain of
Esotericism.
The Marquis Saint Yves might well be considered even more
a Christian Mystic than an Hermetic Initiate, because he
thought as much of the spirit as he did of the Word and made
every effort to live accordingly.
The Marquis D'Alveydre fulfilled well the mission imposed
upon him by the Supreme Grand Master Levi, and died at
Versailles, February, 1909.

INITIATE;
L'Ordre D• Lu After the death of the Supreme
Grand Master Levi and after the Mar-
~ quis had taken his seat, DeGuaita was
selected for membership to the Council of Three, a position he
filled until his death.
In 1884 a schism arose between the Philosophic Initiates who
had been accepted as members of L'Ordre du Lis, and a con-
siderable number of Aspirants who sought office and honors,
to which they had no right because of unpreparedness. It was

During this period DeGuaita and Papus were joined by those
who sought the Light in order to form an exoteric Organiza-
tion which was to be the Door into the Fraternitas, among

The last of the three planned volumes, The Problem of Evil,
was not published.
DeGuaita endeavored to show that the esoteric was more
important than any exoteric teachings in that it taught positive
principles demonstratable by actual practice. In other words,
not mere acceptance by, or in, faith, but by living accordingly.
The result was that many seekers, both true and false, flocked
to him and sought instructions. Being a poet, he also was an
idealist and in consequence, accepted those who came to him at
their face value, only to learn that selfishness lay at the heart
of the many while only the few sought from the heart.
To those who were really ready or serious, the Door was
opened in the form of the Kabbalistic Order of the Rose Croix,1
but it soon became apparent that the serpent (the betrayer) in
the Garden of Eden was present and it was necessary to close
the Door to all who could not prove themselves.
In time the Kabbalistic Order of the Rose Croix purged
itself of the unworthy and proceeded with its work of prepar-
ing Neophytes for the greater inner or Esoteric study and
training. Unfortunately for the reputation of the Kabbalistic
Order of the Rose Croix, those who had eliminated themselves
by their utter foulness, organized, without any authority what-

Paris in 1869. He was entered in Rollin
College and proved himself a brilliant
scholar. In 1882 he entered the School
of Paris as a medical student. At this
time, like many others before him who
later became high Philosophic Initiates,
he was an ardent evolutionist-material-
ist and a book prepared by him on his
theories was published in 1884.
As a founding member of the Stu-
dent's Association he, Encausse, became acquainted with mem-

bers of the Black Cat and in this group trained himself as a
lecturer. To overcome his timidity or inferiority complex, he
passed his evenings giving lectures on Natural History and
Physiology to the members of the French Union for Youths.
As an interne of the hospital he was to serve at the Clinics of
several celebrated professors and finally associated himself with
a Dr. Luys, under whom he became Laboratory chief, but
instead of preparing himself at the hospital as did his comrades,
Encausse devoted himself to the study of the Hermetic Sciences
and passed much of his time at the National Library where
he developed a strong passion for the old grimores of the Al-
chemists and the Rosy Cross. From a materialist he developed a
strong spiritual-philosophic trend and it was at this time that
he was made acquainted with the work of Peter Davidson.
Encausse became active as a writer and 1887 saw the publica-
tion of his Contemporary Occultism and Sepher Yetzirah.
These books served as an introduction to St. Yves D'Alveydre,
who received him with the open arms of a Philosophic Initiate
and recognized Encausse as a worthy Neophyte who should
some day in the not distant future become a truly great Initiate.
The year 1888 saw the publication of his work The Elemen-
tary Treatise of Occult Science. This work passed through
many editions. Part of this work deals with the question How
I Became a Mystic. It is in part a recital of his own intellectual
evolution, but it also offers a detailed explanation of the things
a medical student or physician with open mind is enabled to
discover who, though a materialist, enters the search for truth
regards other organizations, however worthy, we would steer a middle
course because these were merely incidental to our history. We have
as carefully as possible adhered to this determination throughout, how-
ever, there arc 1nstances where this would be misleading; one such is the
record of Papus. His activity in the Fraternitas was known only to the
higher Initiates, but to others he was familiar as the Grand Master of the
Martinist Order and as a member of the Supreme Council of the
Kabbalistic Rose Croix, in both of which he was succeeded first by I11.-.
Brother J. Bricaud and later by I11 .-.Brother Chevillon.

always had the undeniable mania to never accept an idea until
after I had myself given careful study and analysis of all its
aspects."
In 1888, Papus founded the magazine The Initiation and
always prepared the leading article for it. In 1889 he served his
military duty and while doing so, prepared the material for his
book Treatise of Practical Magic. On release from military
duty, he founded an outer center for study, known as The
Centre of Occultism of the Rue de Trevise, where he gave
lectures on the Occult Science.

articles for the magazine L'Initiation, Encausse was engaged on
his work The Tarot of the Bohemians and published, in 1889,
a work for Initiates only. In working out the esoteric meaning
of the Sacred Name, Yod He Vau He, Encausse furnished the
key to the Kaballah itself, though plain as his explanations
appear, none but Philosophic Initiates were ever taught the
application, or practical direction of the Yod He Vau He
Arcanum.
In 1891 there appeared his work Methodical Treatise of
Occult Science. This work offered students an analysis of the
works of Lenain and Kircher on the Kabbala, of the translation
of Genesis by Fabre D'Olivet and the treatise upon Alchemy by
Cyliani as well as the works on Numbers by Wronski.
In 1893 his work Elementary Treatise of Practical Magic
was published. This actually was a continuation of his Me-
thodical Treatise. The latter taught the theory, the former the
practice, showing the application to contemporary psychology
of the teachings of Pythagoras and Plato as dealt with by
Fabre D'Olivet. The second part deals with the realization and
gives studied conclusions to the possible manifestation of the
faculties of the human creature under the influence of various
ju .actions reaching it externally. In the adaptation of his con-
clusions are found the purely traditional teachings.

who profess much knowledge with the Rosy Cross have found
much fault because he died in the arms of the old Church. These

that the Rosy Cross is philosophic; that though its Science of the
Soul is the spirit of religion itself, IT MAINTAINS NO CHURCH; its
adherents being members from Churches of all persuasions.
Atheists are not acceptable by the Fraternitas, consequently, its

persuasion or another and necessarily die in the "arms" of one

The fact that all Fraternal bodies beginning with the Rosy
Cross and Masonry are anathema to the mother church does
not contradict that other fact that other persuasions are just as
bitter against these orders. Men belong to these religious bodies

JEAN BAPTISTE BRICAUD
One of the truly great Philosophic Initiates of modern
times was Jean Baptiste Bricaud, born February 11, 1881,
at Neuville-sur-Ain. His parents being
of a very religious nature, intended that
he should enter the priesthood and en-
rolled him while very young into the
little Seminary of Meximieux (Ain).
During his vacation he became ac-
quainted with members of the Frater-
nitas and acquired a copy of The
Science of the Magi, by Papus. The
faculty learned of this and a severe
reprimand and punishment followed.
Confronted with such extreme narrow-
ness of ideas he renounced a priestly
career and refused to enter the larger
Seminary.
At the age of sixteen, his parents decided to send him to
Lyon to work, his mother going with him in October, 1897.
He at once obtained a position in the Credit Lyonnais (one
of the large banks) where he remained until his death.
Almost from the beginning of his arrival at Lyon, he began
frequenting what was known as the Bouchet bookshop [Elie

was assisted by Dr. Gerard Encausse (Papus) and Moutin,
and administered by Messrs. Baudelot, Demarest and Durville.
There also was active an associate school at 35, rue Tete d'Or,
Lyon. Bricaud was enrolled December 6, 1897, an^ his card

Jacques Charrot, who had been trained under Levi, and who

the Master that twice each week, Bricaud was permitted to
enter the sanctuary and sit at the table with Charrot, who then
proceeded to propound the Kabbala by means of rare manu-

enter the sanctuary and sit at the table with Charrot, who then
proceeded to propound the Kabbala by means of rare manu-
scripts on Hermeticism and Magi-cal science which he, Char-
rot, had received directly from the former Supreme Grand

almost duplicates the story of Lytton's Zanom.

This dwelling of Charrot in old Lyon resembled nothing
more than a monk's cell, furnished with shelves loaded with
books on every known subject dealing with the Arcane and
Philosophic Initiation.
Charrot lived in this setting like the hermit he was. Seated
before his desk covered with manuscripts and facing his Neo-
phyte or Neophytes, he would explain page after page to them.
Through Baron Spedalieri as an intermediary, Charrot had
been accepted by Levi as a Neophyte and under his direction
and guidance had become a master of the Kabbala.
Although Bricaud had left the Seminary he was so deeply
imbued with the spirit of religion that he could not sever him-

he gave his support to the Velentinian Gnostic Movement of
Doinel. In January, 1901, he entered into contract with
Synesius, i.e., Fabre des Essarts the Patriarch, where his deep
knowledge of religion quickly raised him to first rank. Upon
the solicitation of his coadjutor, Sophronius, who had tested

continued to pursue his studies with the Gnosis in the fore-

In 1907, Bricaud and Sophronius separated themselves from
Synesius in order to be free to more clearly define the theology

Not content with his doctrinal and religious activities,
Bricaud, more than ever, pursued his research into the history
of Secret Societies. As this activity is not directly concerned

know, is to group themselves together in an effort to
elevate the Initiation in its true path, and to restore its
lost value. ... To those who desire to work for this restor-
ation we make appeal. . . . The labor is immense and the
workers very few. But, to those who know, it is not a
case of continuing the mistakes of the past. . . . We need
workers from among our own companions, and not of
people who proclaim themselves Masters before having
[even] been apprentices. . . . With the latter we have
nothing to do! There is no room for them among us.

one may think, the Unknown Superiors have never aban-

94 ACTORS IN THE ARCANE DRAMA
Bricaud took great pains to surround himself with the most
sincere of those active in the Great Work. The greatest of
these being his disciple, Constant Martin Chevillon, who had
been closely associated with him in Lyon until 1927. After
Chevillon left Lyon, they corresponded almost daily. When
Bricaud felt himself approaching the great change he requested
Chevillon to step into his high and holy office and continue the
Work. Chevillon's reply was: "It is a very heavy burden
that you confide into my care, my Master, however, I will do
everything in my power to carry on as well as I may; you have
my sacred promise to this."
This pact was concluded in September, 1933. In December
of 1933 Bricaud fell ill; however, he continued to be active.
The day came when he knew it was time to issue the final
and secret orders, and calling Mrs. Bricaud to his side, he had
her make the necessary notes to be passed on to his successor,
Chevillon, so that his task might be made easier. On February
21, 1934, Bricaud passed into the Light beyond the Shadow
and Chevillon took his seat as Supreme Grand Master of the
Fraternitas, and of L'Ordre du Lis, Grand Master of the
Kabbalistic Rose Croix, President of the International Occult
Society, and in addition, he also acquired offices not connected
with the Fraternitas, such as that of the Martinists of which
Bricaud had been Supreme Grand Master, and whom he suc-
ceeded.
Among the many works published by the Supreme Grand
Master Bricaud, are:
1902— Dutoit-Membrini
1903—The Little Anticoncordataire Church
1904—The First Elements of Occultism
1906—The First Elements of Astrology
1907—Catechism for the Gnostic Church
1909—The Modern Christian Religion—in Collaboration with

entire life.
In his instructor, Arthur Hennequin, he recognized the ideal,
so much so that he became almost an idol to him and when
Professor Hennequin died, it grieved him so greatly that he
abandoned his course of study and left the University.
Accepting the offer of a friend, he now entered, as an
ordinary employee, a bank in Lyon, where his material exis-
tence was assured. This was the General Society and he re-
mained with this bank until 1913, later entering the Banque
Nationale de Credit, where he remained until the time of his

Like Bricaud, his instructor and guide, Chevillon may be said
to have led a double life. During the day he followed the
monotonous and absorbing work in the bank; his evenings he
devoted to intellectual and spiritual development.
In 1911, Chevillon, with the help of several companions,
founded the literary society which was known as The Attica,
where he gave lectures of the arts and ideals which were the
very soul of his spiritual nature.
At this time, Chevillon possessed little knowledge of the
Occult and Arcane. Through a friend, the poet J. B. Roche, he
received his first inkling of Occultism, but the war of 1914
came along and the Society dispersed, but not before Roche
had the opportunity to introduce Chevillon to Bricaud. At this
time all were mobilized: Bricaud at Langres, while Chevillon
was first sent into Alsace, then into Champagne, where he was
wounded the first time. He returned to the front in 1916, and
was in the Somme on July 8, where he was gravely wounded;
his left arm broken by a bullet. He was shipped from hospital

Lyon, Chevillon became Bricaud's most faithful and devoted
Neophyte.
Chevillon, being of a philosophical-literary trend, found in
the Arcane science the complement of that which he already
possessed. The Esotericism taught him by Bricaud gave com-
plete satisfaction to Chevillon and his progress toward Philo-
sophic Initiation was rapid. Chevillon's friendship for Bricaud
was as deep as it had been for professor Hennequin. His loyalty
was that of the true Neophyte for the Master and comprehend-

Chevillon reconstituted little by little the various groups at
Paris and in other cities. The climax of his work was attained
when he was honored by the Order of the Rose as a Member;
became the highest ranking officer of UOrdre du Lis of France;
was knighted as a member of the Order of the Holy Grail in
1940, and in association with the Supreme Grand Master of

THE prophet Isaiah prophesied of a New World where men
should be free. Columbus is given credit for the discovery
of that New World, but it remained for
Thomas Paine to so imbue the hearts of
men with the desire for freedom; re-
ligiously, mentally and spiritually, that
they were willing to sacrifice life and
all they possessed in order to obtain it.
In this he was a worthy disciple of
Paracelsus who fought for medical
freedom; Agrippa who labored for the
freedom of Science, while Luther risked
his life for religious liberty.

Member of the Order of the Rose, and L'Ordre du Lis and of

1737. At a very early age he became interested in literary work
and showed an intense interest in the rights and liberties of his
fellow men.

seeking a means to bring about this freedom. Among this group
were members of the Royal houses of both France and England,

When the Revolution in America became a fact in 1774,
Paine immigrated to the United States. Shortly after his arrival,
he became editor of the Pennsylvania Magazine. It was not long
before he recognized that freedom was impossible under the
Governments as they existed and he openly advocated separa-
tion and independence.
Inspired by the prophecy of Isaiah and the instructions he
had amongst the Brethren in Europe, he started to write his
book, Common Sense, putting heart and soul in all he advocated,
and this became the incentive of the leaders for American
freedom. But for Paine and his fiery leadership, America would
not have been able to throw off the shackles of Europe, at least
not at that early date.
Paine not alone advocated American Independence; he like-

held the colored man in serfdom.
Besides these principal doctrines for the freedom of man, he

other nations; in the manner that individual families live within
a state, and advocated the purchase of the Louisiana Territory.

The ancestry of Paine was sectarian; like that of Franklin and
others. They were Quakers and used to hardship, oppression
and taxation beyond reason. The schooling he had was slight,
his difficulties were many and these caused him to think, and by
thinking, to find solutions for the problems confronting his
(and the) people. Like Lincoln, he was forced to seek means

idea that Paine was an atheist, his career as a writer and an advo-

Captain Cook was sailing the seas in search for continents.
Horace Walpole was setting up a printing press at Straw-
berry Hill, while a mighty band of men who had long been
spiritually free, if not politically so, were gathering secretly,
laying plans for men's moral and spiritual freedom, and to these
last belonged Thomas Paine; studying with them, planning and
preparing; and into this group there silently entered a stranger
from a foreign land; Franklin, the Friend.
They were immediately cognizant of the spirit which held
sway within each other; they recognized the abilities possessed
by each other; they knew what each must do. They became
great friends. Franklin recognized the genius of Paine; his part
to play in the coming Immortal drama of the freedom of man
now held so cheaply by the millions.
They held meetings in the secret places of the Order of the
Rose, the one group of free men in all London, and Franklin
was inducted as such. Franklin urged Paine to go to America,
gave him letters of introduction and on November 30, 1774,
Paine set foot on American soil; Paine, the agent or Ambassador
of the spirit Isaiah, who was to make manifest that which
Isaiah had written: the Freedom of Man in a new World.
Paine was the first to coin the phrases: The American Nation,
and The United States of America. He was their father in
spirit and fact. To establish both, or to help make possible their
establishment, it was necessary for him to awaken the colonists
to a realization of their problem, which was to be free from
the mother country; possible only in independence.
To achieve this need, Paine gave the people Common Sense,
which took them as by storm and aroused them to action, with
the result that six months thereafter, the Declaration of Inde-
pendence was written and the revolution—the revolt against
injustice and tyranny—not actually against England, followed.

one bright spot; the Legislature of Pennsylvania voted Paine an
honorarium of three thousand dollars, and the University of
Pennsylvania awarded him the degree of Master of Arts. As
for the rest, defamation and vilification, but Paine continued
to follow a clearly outlined path and it is questionable if he
actually was aware of what was being said.
When independence was declared, Paine enlisted as a private,
was quickly made aide-de-camp to General Greene and took
an active part in various battles, but his work as a writer and
awakener of the people was not yet finished. Late in 1776, he
published The American Crisis, wherein he clearly indicated
the dangers ahead and warned all that NOW was at hand THE
TIME THAT WOULD TRY MEN'S SOULS. The intent and purpose of
the booklet was to arouse the courage of the despondent sol-
diers. Washington immediately recognized its worth and
ordered the pamphlet read by the head of every regiment. Issue
after issue of The American Crisis followed to help keep up the
courage of the army.
Following this Paine started a subscription list for the purpose
of feeding the army that was now well-nigh starving. He
personally headed this list with every cent he possessed 1—fifty
dollars. The subscription finally amounted to more than a
million and a half. It is now admitted that this alone averted
disaster and supported the army until money was received from
France at the request of Franklin.
Perhaps no one ever was more fully en rapport with the Im-
mortal spirit (not in a Spiritualistic sense) than our own George
Lippard, a later member of the Great Council2 to which Paine
belonged, and it is well to listen to what he had to say, because
it is based on historical truth, not on fancy or fiction:
'This, like Franklin giving up the eating of meat, was the "key" to
Paine's sincerity; showing that he was willing to give his all, and thereby
proved his faith in God and the cause he espoused.

the royal brute of Britain.

"Was not that bold language from a little man in a brown
coat, to a great King, sitting there in his royal halls, at once a
tyrant and pope to America? Listen to Common Sense again:
A greater absurdity cannot be conceived than that three mil-
lions of people should be running to their sea coast every time
a ship arrives from London, to know what portion of liberty
they shall enjoy.'
"And again, here is a paragraph for George of England to
give to the Archbishop of Canterbury, to read in all churches
after the customary prayers for the royal family: 'No man,'

than myself before the fatal 19th of April, 1775,' the day of the
massacre of Lexington, 'But the moment the event of that day
was made known, I rejected the hardened, sullen-tempered
Pharaoh of England forever; and disdain the wretch, that with

of their slaughter and composedly sleep with their blood on his

"Yes, look yonder: behold the Crisis read by every corporal
in the army of Washington, read to the listening group of
soldiers; look what joy, what hope, what energy, gleams over
those veteran faces, as words like these break on their ears:
'These are the times that try men's Souls. The summer soldiers
and the sunshine patriots will in this crisis, shrink from the serv-
ice of their country; but he that stands it now deserves the love
and thanks of man and woman. Tyranny, like hell, is not easily
conquered; yet we have this consolation with us, that the harder
the conflict the more glorious the triumph [this is true in all
affairs of life].'
"Do not words like these stir up the blood? Yet can you
imagine their effect, when read to groups of starved and bleed-
ing soldiers, by the dim watchfire, in the cold air of the winter
dawn? Such words as these stirred up the Continentals to the
attack on Trenton; and there, in the dawn of glorious morning
George Washington, standing sword in hand, over the dead
body of the Hessian, Ralle, confessed the magic influence of
the author-hero, Thomas Paine.
"Now, let us change the scene. Come with me over three
thousand miles of waves, come with me to Paris. Come with me,
past yon heap of rocks and burnt embers; the ruins of the
Bastille. Come with me, through these scattered crowds who
murmur in the streets. Hush! Hold your breath as you enter

rn8 ACTORS IN THE ARCANE DRAMA
"Yes, look yonder: behold the Crisis read by every corporal
in the army of Washington, read to the listening group of
soldiers; look what joy, what hope, what energy, gleams over
those veteran faces, as words like these break on their ears:
'These are the times that try men's Souls. The summer soldiers
and the sunshine patriots will in this crisis, shrink from the serv-
ice of their country; but he that stands it now deserves the love
and thanks of man and woman. Tyranny, like hell, is not easily
conquered; yet we have this consolation with us, that the harder
the conflict the more glorious the triumph [this is true in all
affairs of life].'
"Do not words like these stir up the blood? Yet can you
imagine their effect, when read to groups of starved and bleed-
ing soldiers, by the dim watchfire, in the cold air of the winter
dawn? Such words as these stirred up the Continentals to the
attack on Trenton; and there, in the dawn of glorious morning
George \Vashington, standing sword in hand, over the dead
body of the Hessian, RaIle, confessed the magic influence of
the author-hero, Thomas Paine.
"Now, let us change the scene. Come with me over three
thousand miles of waves, come with me to Paris. Come with me,
past yon heap of rocks and burnt embers; the ruins of the
Bastille. Come with me, through these scattered crowds who
murmur in the streets. Hush! Hold your breath as you enter
this wide hall. What see you now? A splendid chamber; splen-
did, because encircled with the architectural trophies of four
hundred years-a splendid chamber, crowded by one dense mass
of human beings. Here-and there-wherever you look, you
see nothing but that wall of human faces. Does not the awful
silence that broods here, in this splendid salon, strike your hearts
with an impression of strange omen? Tell me, oh tell me, and
tell me at once, what means the horror that I see brooding and
gathering over this wall of faces? Listen!
"Here in this hall the people of France have gathered. They

have come from the fair valley of Provence and Dauphine,
from the wilds of Bretagne, from the palaces and huts of
Paris, the people have gathered to try a great criminal. That
criminal, sits yonder in the felon's seat, a man of respectable
appearance, sitting there, with a woman of strange loveliness by
his side—sitting there, with the only unclouded brow in all this
vast assemblage!
"That criminal is Louis Capet. He is to be tried here today,
for treason to the people of France! And when you look upon
the mild-visaged man, sitting there, with the beautiful woman
by his side, and feel inclined to pity him, to weep for that
tender woman; as you see the lowering looks of this vast crowd
directed to the pair; as you feel that this awful silence brooding
and gathering on every side speaks a terror, a horror more to be
feared than the loudest words, then, as pity, sympathy, gather
over your hearts, then I pray you, in the name of God, to
remember, that this man here sits clothed with the groans, the
tears, the blood of f1fteen million people; yes, that the mildly
beautiful pearls, that rise and fall, with every pulsation of that
woman's bosom, if transformed into their original elements,
would flood the wide hall with two rivers; a river of tears and
a river of blood! for now, as the great question is about to be
decided, shall Louis, the Traitor-King, live or die, let us for a
moment, I beseech you, look at the great moral, the great
truth of this scene.
"Ah, is it not a sublime sight, this that breaks upon our eyes;
a king on trial for treason to his people? For ages and ages these
kings have waded up to thrones, through rivers of blood; yes,
built their thrones upon islands of dead bodies, centered in those
rivers of blood, and now, the cry of vengeance [always a crime,
therefore an evil], rising from fifteen millions up to God, has
pierced the eternal ear and called his vengeance down!

BENJAMIN FRANKLIN
Benjamin Franklin, Author, Statesman, Scientist, Philoso-
pher, Philosophic Initiate and Rose Cross, was born in
Boston, Mass., January 17, 1706, of par-
ents so poor that he actually received
but one year of schooling. At the age of
twelve he was apprenticed to his broth-
er, a printer, publisher of the New Eng-
land Courant. When this brother be-
came involved in other matters, Frank-
lin, though but sixteen, continued the
business.
Despite working and assuming such
responsibility, the boy's income was so
small that, in order to buy the books he wanted, he gave up the
eating of meat to save a little money 1 that he might continue to
buy books and study.
Before he was eighteen he decided to leave Boston in order
to improve his financial status and went to New York, and
from there he went to Philadelphia. In Philadelphia he made the
acquaintance of the then Governor of the State, William Keith,
who took a fancy to the youth and suggested that Franklin go
to London in order that he might buy type, other printing
equipment, and set up a printing plant in Philadelphia.
He arrived in London safely, but found himself without
funds. This, for a strange youth in a big city, should have been
'"From little acorns giant oaks grow." It is the apparently little things
in a man that give us the "key" to his character and the "why and where-

a tragedy, but proved to be most fortunate. He obtained work
in the printing house then known as Palmer's. While working
there he made the acquaintance of a second-hand book dealer
named Wilcox, who not only loaned him books on subjects in
which he was interested, but made him acquainted with men
who influenced his entire life, and as a result of which he
became the world famous philosopher and statesman.
By the Fall of 1726, then a youth of but twenty, Franklin
was back in Philadelphia; young in years, aged in knowledge
and experience. Here he engaged himself to manage a printing
plant owned by a Mr. Keimer. He not only managed the plant,
but invented new kinds of ink and new methods for making
type. It was while he was employed in this shop that he organ-
ized a club then known as the Juno, which a little later became
the American Philosophical Society.
After leaving the employ of Keimer, when twenty-four
years of age, he, together with a partner, opened their own
printing shop, but did not well agree, and he later became the
sole owner of the plant. Shortly after this he bought a small
newspaper known as the Pennsylvania Gazette. As editor of
this paper, Franklin, for all his mildness, instituted and fought
for many needed reforms. Through his efforts an academy was
organized which later became the University of Pennsylvania,
and later a hospital was established.
In 1733, Franklin began the publication of Poor Richard's
Almanack, which soon became a best seller and brought him
fame throughout the world. It was no longer necessary for him
to be a vegetarian in order to save a few pennies, but Franklin
had found a philosophy which eschewed warm blooded foods,
and he continued the diet to which he had become accustomed.
Franklin next started the Philadelphia-Zeitung, the first for-
eign language newspaper to be published in America, and in
1741, he began the publication of a magazine called the General
Magazine and Historical Quarterly.

factor by nature, he refused a patent or any profits from it.
He next experimented with electricity, based on theories he
had learned from the French while in London.
When forty-two years of age Franklin retired from business
to devote himself entirely to studies that might lead to knowl-
edge and inventions for the good of the mass. Self-taught after
the manner of Randolph later, Franklin was at home with
philosophers, scientists, diplomats and politicians.
As a result of acquaintances made when in London as a mere
youth, he was made a member of the Royal Society of London,
founded by members of the Initiate Orders and of which many
continued as members. Later the University of St. Andrews of
Scotland conferred upon him the degree Doctor of Law.
In 1757, thirty-three years after his first visit to London,
Franklin returned to London, this time not as a strange, penni-

whose nature was not of graft; as an agent of the Pennsylvania
Assembly.
Franklin was generally successful in whatever mission he
undertook. This was for the reason that his innate honesty was
felt. It was quickly recognized that here was a man who could
not be bought, browbeaten or eliminated by unfair means; a
man who would fight for what he believed right, yet too great
by nature to take advantage of any one either for self-benefit
or benefit of constituency; nor did he hesitate to confound his
own family when he felt them to be in the wrong.
In 1775 Franklin was chosen a member of the Continental
Congress, and he, with others of like nature who thought the
freedom of man of greater importance than life itself, became
one of the leaders. In 1773-74, Franklin was one of the members
of the Great Council of the Fraternitas held in Philadelphia,
which was later woven into a legend by George Lippard.

BOOK OF ROSICRUCLE 115
When the Continental troops were defeated in 1776, and
Congress decided to ask Europe for aid, it was Franklin, be-
cause of his known connections with the Friends of Freedom in
France, who was sent to France in an effort to obtain the needed
help.
Franklin reached Paris, December 21, 1776, and immediately
set about to accomplish his mission which was, first of all, to
win the members of the French Court. This to any other than
Franklin might have been a difficult task. However, several
factors were in his favor. First of all and greatest, was the fact
that Nature had created him a gentleman; kindly, cordial,
friendly, honest, upright to such a degree that effort or make-
believe was unnecessary. To meet him was to like him and all
who met him were drawn to him. . . . Secondly, he already
had many friends, i.e., brethren among the Friends of Freedom
in France, who were members of the Court of high standing.
These men he met secretly as an Unknown; but later as a
member of the lodge of Nine Sisters of Paris, wherein he
became a sponsor for membership of Voltaire. Many of the
members of the Lodge Humanidad were Philosophic Initiates,
or Rose Cross, and members of UOrdre du Lis.
Franklin, a Friend, did not possess a shred of hypocrisy in
his nature. He was himself, and because of this people first
trusted him and then loved him. Even while in Paris on his
most important mission, a mission upon the success of which
depended the freedom of the new nation, he refused to do "as
others do" in order to win their favor.
Moving among a court dressed in embroidery, lace, wigs and
powder, he always appeared in his brown coat and round hat,
hair unpowdered, person unperfumed; a strange but powerful

BOOK OF ROSICRUCI.lE
When the Continental troops were defeated in 1776, and
Congress decided to ask Europe for aid, it was Franklin, be-
cause of his known connections with the Friends of Freedom in
France, who was sent to France in an effort to obtain the needed
help.
Franklin reached Paris, December 21, 1776, and immediately
set about to accomplish his mission which was, first of all, to
win the members of the French Court. This to any other than
Franklin might have been a difficult task. However, several
factors were in his favor. First of all and greatest, was the fact
that Nature had created him a gentleman; kindly, cordial,
friendly, honest, upright to such a degree that effort or make-
believe was unnecessary. To meet him was to like him and all
who met him were drawn to him.... Secondly, he already
had many friends, i.e., brethren among the Friends of Freedom
in France, who were members of the Court of high standing.
These men he met secretly as an Unknown; but later as a
member of the lodge of Nine Sisters of Paris, wherein he
became a sponsor for membership of Voltaire. Many of the
members of the Lodge Humauidad were Philosophic Initiates,
or Rose Cross, and members of L'Ordre du Lis.
Franklin, a Friend, did not possess a shred of hypocrisy in
his nature. He was himself, and because of this people first
trusted him and then loved him. Even while in Paris on his
most important mission, a mission upon the success of which
depended the freedom of the new nation, he refused to do "as
others do" in order to win their favor.
Moving among a court dressed in embroidery, lace, wigs and
powder, he always appeared in his brown coat and round hat,
hair unpowdered, person unperfumed; a strange but P°'"erful
figure, yet a successful one; sectarian, Mason, a commoner. He
negotiated the Franco-American Treaty of alliance, and saw
it signed on February 6, 1778.
This was only the beginning of his efforts for the creation
116 ACTORS IN THE ARCANE DRAMA
of a Free Nation of which free men might be citizens. He now
began his efforts to persuade the French Government to not
only continue their assistance, but to grant loan upon loan, until
the New Republic owed France 20,000,000 francs. He further
obtained French arms, a French Army and a French fleet, all
of this help ready to meet and defeat the then enemy at York-
town in 1781.
Franklin now was called upon to be the peacemaker, a part
which belonged to him by nature. In the Spring of 1782, he
opened negotiations with the British, and in the Fall of 1782 the
treaty between the British and American nation was signed.
After the treaty was signed, Franklin was chosen president of
the Executive Council of Pennsylvania and served for three
years as Governor of the State.
Freeman by nature, American by birth and choice, Franklin
was, nevertheless, a cosmopolitan, and his heart was with ah1
free people. As a member of the Royal Society and during his
fifteen years in England, he devoted many hours to the study
of Arcane philosophy in the presence of the Brethren of the
Rosy Cross and in the meetings of the Order of the Rose. He
also spent other hours with the members of La Humanidad;
Philosophic Initiates and L'Ordre du Lis. During his more
than seven years in France, he had come to love the French
people and held for them as deep an affection as was in his
heart for his own countrymen, many of whom had not shown
him too great a friendliness.
Franklin, though by adherence a sectarian, nevertheless be-
lieved in Reincarnation—a return of the Soul to earth to perfect
itself—as is clearly indicated in the epitaph he himself prepared:

was opposed to England's tax plan because he, as a large and

successful business man, was compelled to pay them. He left
Philadelphia and went to Boston to gain knowledge first hand,
returning to Philadelphia thoroughly filled with a desire for
the independence of America. He proved his sincerity by be-
coming a captain in the army. This was generally against the
doctrine of his religion, but he felt, as had his forefathers who
were members of the Friends of Freedom, that to be a MAN,
man cannot be a slave, and it were better to be dead than live
as the serf of any man or congregation of men.
He entered the Continental Congress as the successor to
John Dickinson, who, though sometimes called "the pen of the
Revolution,'' refused to sign the Declaration of Independence
and left Congress. George served in Congress from July 20,
1776 to September of 1777.1 With Wilson and others of the
Pennsylvania members of Congress, he signed the Declaration
with them.
He was the first treasurer of the central government and
worked with Robert Morris in planning the financial affairs of
the United colonies which was then a treasury without funds.
Clymer was the first man to buy bonds of liberty, and he sold
them to his friends. The problems of Morris and Clymer were
almost insurmountable; problems that would have been (and
were thought) hopeless by all but these two.
When the Congress left in retreat from Philadelphia on
being threatened by unpaid soldiers, Clymer and Morris re-
mained as the sole governors of the then new and decidedly
shaky government. The national leaders issued currency known
as "Continental currency" which became worthless. Clymer, in
addition to working with Morris, also worked with Ebridge
Gerry, another of the signers of the Declaration, in his efforts
for financial reform.

served as a Pennsylvania delegate from 1780 to 1783. When
some of the states became delinquent in the requisitions fixed to
help bear the cost of the war, he and Rutledge were delegated
to awaken them to their obligation.
In 1785 he became a member of the Pennsylvania Legislature
and served until 1788. During this time he, with the Quakers,
fought against capital punishment for many offences, and
against the public expose of criminals. He also was a member of
the Federal Constitution Convention.
Here he fought with the delegation in its fight for the rights
of the large states and whole-heartedly participated in the mak-
ing of the Constitution. Later, again, as a member of the Penn-
sylvania Assembly, he aided greatly in having the Assembly call
a state convention to act on ratification before a formal request
had been made by Congress.
Clymer was sent to the first Congress under the Constitution

which included the territory later represented in Congress by
Buchanan, who became the fifteenth President of the United

Clymer somehow attracted the most disagreeable tasks of
the period. After serving one period in Congress he was con-
signed to the disagreeable position of serving as head of the
excise tax department during what was known as the Whiskey
Rebellion in western Pennsylvania, when the farmer-distillers
of that region defied a Federal Statute fixing a tax on every
barrel of whiskey. The insurrection was subdued with the help
of some fifteen hundred soldiers.
Still another difficult task assigned him was to proceed South
to assist in negotiating a treaty with the Cherokee and Creek
Indians of Georgia during the last period of Washington's
administration.

he had he gave to Washington; even so, he was far more
fortunate than his friend Morris, who, like himself, gave all he
possessed to help the cause; who, later, when penniless and in
debt, was consigned to a debtors prison, disgraced and per-
mitted to suffer mental torture in exchange for his whole-
heartedness and generosity.
Clymer was the only one to sign both the Constitution and
the Declaration of Independence, and as a reward, his home
was sacked and destroyed by a mob which did not approve

ETHAN ALLEN HITCHCOCK
ETHAN ALLEN HITCHCOCK was born at Vergennes, Vermont,
May 18, 1798. His father was a lawyer of reputation; his
mother a daughter of the famous Ethan
Allen, after whom he was named. It is
not our purpose to here deal with the
youth, education or military record of
General Hitchcock l, much of which
has been interwoven throughout this
volume in connection with the many
other Dramatis Person* of the Arcane
Drama.
In truth, beginning with 1845 and un-
til his death, General Hitchcock either
as himself or under one of his Philo-
sophic Initiate names conferred upon
him by the Hierarchy, was connected
in one way or another with almost every
active Grand Dome, whether of Ger-
many, France, England, other European countries, or America.
To the members of the Fraternitas, General Hitchcock was
known, and is known, as one of its highest Hermetic, Alchemic
Philosophic Initiates; as one who attained to the highest degree
of Arcane knowledge; not only sat in the various Councils
of the World, but in the highest seat of the Grand Domes as
Hierophant . . ., Unknown. His word was Law; when he en-
tered the Council or Dome, it was his right to advance to the
Altar, select a Wand or Sword, take his seat in the East and
call the Council or Dome to order.
To the non-Initiate reading public he is best known by his

In truth, beginning with 1845 and un-
til his death, General Hitchcock either
as himself or under one of his Philo-
sophic Initiate names conferred upon
him by the Hierarchy, was connected
~ in one way or another with almost every
active Grand Dome, whether of Ger-
many, France, England, other European countries, or America.
To the members of the Fraternitas, General Hitchcock was
known, and is known, as one of its highest Hermetic, Alchemic
Philosophic Initiates; as one who attained to the highest degree
of Arcane knowledge; not only sat in the various Councils
of the World, but in the highest seat of the Grand Domes as
Hierophant ..., UnknO'WTl. His word was Law; when he en-
tered the Council or Dome, it was his right to advance to the
Altar, select a Wand or Sword, take his seat in the East and
call the Council or Dome to order.
To the non-Initiate reading public he is best known by his
'Those interested to know Hitchcock as he was as a youth, student,
teacher, world traveller, military genius, philosopher, etc., should read
Fifty Years in Camp and Field, by W. A. Croffut, a work sympatheti-
cally written.

work, Alchemy and the Alchemists, wherein he freely offers
the key to Alchemy to all who can read and understand.
Throughout the present works, the History of the Fraternitas
ACCORDING TO THE RECORDS IN THE ARCHIVES, we have made him
our official interpreter of the writings of the Initiate Alchem-
ists.
Since Alchemy, i.e., the transmutation of the ignoble into
the exalted or pure gold, is the Work of Philosophic Initiation,
he must be dealt with in that capacity even in the description
of himself. Regrettably, there will be certain unavoidable
repetitions.
"I am convinced," says Hitchcock, "that the character of the
Alchemists, and the object of their study, have been universally
misconceived; and as a matter of fact [proven such by experi-
ence], the subject is of such importance to the seeker for truth,
that the mystery should be revealed.
"The opinion has become almost universal, that Alchemy is
'a pretended science by which gold and silver were to be made
by the transmutation being called the Philosopher's Stone.'
Those who professed this Art are supposed to have been either
impostors or under the delusion created by impostors and
mountebanks.2
"This opinion has found its way into the works of Science,
and has been stereotyped in biographical dictionaries and in
encyclopedias, large and small; and, in general, allusions of Al-
chemy, in histories, romances, and novels, are of but one charac-
ter, and imply that the professors of the Art were either de-
luders or deluded; were guilty of fraud or the victims of it.8
"This is unquestionably true of all who pose as Initiates of the Great
Work, or as of the Rosy Cross, and pretend that they are able to trans-
mute crude metals into actual material gold, or teach their dupes to do
so. A true Initiate, even if he were able to do so, WOULD MAKE NO SUCH
CLAIMS.

"The Alchemists [Initiates] in Christian countries accepted
the behests of the Nazarene as true in themselves, or in the
nature of things, but they were not regarded as true simply
upon the ground that the Nazarene announced them.
"The Alchemists sought to have the lovers of their Art test
all doctrines by what they called 'the possibility of Nature.'
Hence the test of doctrines was not with them a written record;
and, consistently with this principle, No Alchemist urged his
opinions upon authority, but always in the style of: 'My son,
listen to my words'; adding: PrO'Ve them by living accordingly

In 1855 he moved to Kansas and several years later met
Randolph, of whom he had heard much through General
Hitchcock.
John Brown was a member of the Great or World Council
and Council of Three, and was Immortalized, first, by giving
his life that others might be free, and secondly, by Randolph in
his work, After Death.
In 1859 Brown organized the Lovers of Liberty for the

His spirit and Soul were with the slaves; his method might

becoming "servants of the Most High God," but likewise of
those selected for and engaged in instructing and guiding these
embryonic "servants." Try as he would, it was impossible for
him to reconcile himself to the difference between professions
and pretensions; his sense of right being such that it was im-
possible for him to be hypocritical.1 He left the institution in
bitterness and with strong condemnatory feelings, forswearing
all intention of ever becoming ordained in the Ministry of the
Church. Throughout all of his life and works he vividly por-
trays the hypocrisy of those seeking to become co-workers
of the lowly Nazarene and his teachings.
It is almost unbelievable, but of record, young Lippard was
now but little more than fifteen years of age. He returned to
his home in Philadelphia at the time of his father's death, and
shortly thereafter became a student in the law office of William
Badger, where he remained for a time, and then later entered
the office of Ovid Fraser Johnson, who subsequently became
Attorney-General of the State of Pennsylvania.
Young Lippard had the same conception of Law and lawyers
as he had previously held the church and the ministry. He
honestly believed that lawyers had to be above reproach; that
they could be trusted with life, possessions and character; that
confidences, like property, were sacredly guarded by "the law"
as practiced by lawyers of the bar. His ever-watchfulness,
which perhaps was almost an obsession, soon convinced him
that he was as greatly mistaken of the administers of justice as
he had been of the ministers of religion, and after four years
in the offices of lawyers, he felt completely disillusioned and as
bitter against the evils in the practice of law as he had become
against the evils in religious professions.
1 Lippard was unable to recognize any middle ground. An act would
either be right or wrong and there could be no excuse, no extenuating
circumstances for one professing right, to commit a wrong. Men of the
cloth were engaged in God's business, therefore it was demanded of them
that they live according to the teachings, otherwise they were hypocrites
and unfit to officiate in God's holy temple.

Lippard now was but twenty years of age and wiser in the
ways of life than most men are at eighty. In order to express
himself he entered the field of journalism by accepting em-
ployment on the Philadelphia daily, Spirit of the Times. Here
at last he found a medium of expression and he put into his
work his unbounded enthusiasm and sympathy for the lowly
and downtrodden, the abused and defrauded. His desires and
efforts were greater than his strength would permit. He became
ill, and as a result, he decided to become an author and began
to write history and facts in the guise of fiction; fiction so
thinly veiled that all who read could readily understand the
references.
In 1842, i.e., when he was just twenty years of age, the
Saturday Evening Post began to publish his first romance. He
then turned his attention to the study of the American Revolu-
tion and all, good and evil, that was part of it, and began writing
what he termed the "Legends," by which name they are still
known.
One of the great "Legends" was that of the "Bell Ringer" of
the State House, awaiting the signal to ring the Liberty Bell.
In referring to this incident, I have a letter before me of a great
historian of the Pennsylvania German people in which he states
in part: "... it is he [Lippard] who is responsible for the story;
'Ring, Grampa, Right,' in connection with the Liberty Bell. He
also wrote an account of Kelpius in which he introduces a story
about the Mystic Stone. Whittier, for his 'Pennsylvania Pilgrim'
was dependent on Lippard for much of his information."
In conjunction with his writings, Lippard also became a lec-
turer, and related his Legends in courses before many Institutes
and Literary Societies, both in Philadelphia and many other
parts of the country, so that their popularity became such that
the Saturday Courier published them.

Lippard now was but twenty years of age and wiser in the
ways of life than most men are at eighty. In order to express
himself he entered the field of journalism by accepting em-
ployment on the Philadelphia daily, Spirit of the Times. Here
at last he found a medium of expression and he put into his
work his unbounded enthusiasm and sympathy for the lowly
and downtrodden, the abused and defrauded. His desires and
efforts were greater than his strength would permit. He became
ill, and as a result, he decided to become an author and began
to write history and facts in the guise of fiction; fiction so
thinly veiled that all who read could readily understand the
references.
In 1842, i.e., when he was just twenty years of age, the
SatuTday Evening Post began to publish his first romance. He
then turned his attention to the study of the American Revolu-
tion and all, good and evil, that was part of it, and began writing
what he termed the "Legends," by which name they are still
known.
One of the great "Legends" was that of the "Bell Ringer" of
the State House, awaiting the signal to ring the Liberty Bell.

beloved Masses—your People?
"No—Adonai and Washington—learn the truth at last. Pro-
gress is a lie. Mankind was born to be the prey of a few op-
pressors [no matter what the name]—born to work, suffer, and
die. The instruments of degradation may change their names,
but they are always the same [a Labor's coterie in power is as
destructive to freedom and man's welfare as an International
Banker's dominion]. And thus I feel—I know that this New
World is mine—my lawful spoil—the scene of the utter and final
degradation of the human race."
Adonai bowed his head—he could not answer the EXECU-

beloved Masses-your People?
"No-Adonai and Washington-learn the truth at last. Pro-
gress is a lie. Mankind was born to be the prey of a few op-
pressors [no matter what the name]-born to work, suffer, and
die. The instruments of degradation may change their names,
but they are always the same [a Labor's coterie in power is as
destructive to freedom and man's welfare as an International
Banker's dominion]. And thus I feel-I know that this New
World is mine-my lawful spoil-the scene of the utter and final
degradation of the human race."
Adonai bowed his head-he could not answer the EXECU-
TIONER. For appearances too much confirmed the words of
SATAN. Troubled and groaning, Washington cast himself upon
his face in very weariness of Soul.
And the Satan folding his arms, stood mocking at their dis-
comfort.
But suddenly, as Adonai in the fulness of his agony exclaimed,
"O! it is all in vain, this hope of human progress, \vhich has had
its martyrs and its prophets for these thousands of years"-sud-
denly, yes even as these words passed his lips, the eyes of Adonai
were unscaled to the clear vision of his higher life, and he be-
held himself encircled by a shining band. He was encircled by
the Souls of those, who in all ages, and in face of all manner
of superstition, avarice, and despair, had held fast to hope in

"Behold us! We are here! We, who in all ages, and in climes
widely removed, and in face of all manner of Superstition,
avarice, and despair, have witnessed to the truth, that
Man is capable of social regeneration, that Society is
capable of social re-organization, that it is the Will of THE
ONE AND LIVING GOD that Heaven shall begin upon this
earth, so that it may go on in the Other World.
"This truth, in various forms, and in all speech, we witnessed
in our earthly lives—we witness it now, before the angels and
the only God."
This holy confession of faith seemed to take wings even
from the mountain top, and float from thence over the Ameri-
can Continent and over the world.
Adonai and Washington heard it in praise and prayer, but
SATAN mocked bitterly, saying:

This continued to be the vows after Philip the Fair requested
Jean deMeung to substitute L'Ordre du Lis for the Order of
the Rose after it was transplanted into England; of members of
both Orders who migrated to, and became Americans, and of
those who accepted membership in the Great Council, of the
Council of Three and of Five. Thus swore General Hitchcock,
as did Franklin and Paine before him; thus vowed Randolph.
Such were the vows of Lippard and Lincoln and their fellow
Brethren unnamed and to be named, and such was the vow of
he who said:
AMERICA SHALL NOT ENTER INTO FOREIGN

There is no honor greater than the Honor of being loyal

ever on guard against the enemies of one's country and against
those who seek to overthrow, by whatever means, one's coun-

It is the vow of the citizen-patriot who is such at heart and
not because it is to his selfish interest to do so.

Just as John Trithemius was the spiritual Father of Paracel-

formation of the Fraternitas , so must General Hitchcock be
given the credit for being the spiritual Father in later years of
Lippard, Lincoln and Randolph.

"Pausing on the dusty roadside, where the snow had melted
and exposed the gray earth for a space of two or three yards,
Adonai raised his eyes, and surveyed the Hamlet, Palaces and
hovels, which lay beneath the Colossal Dome.
"There is not a cloud in the winter sky. This place, despite its
contrast of Palaces and hovels, looks beautiful in the sunshine.
Let me hasten to yonder house and ask its name."
Through a wicket gate, and along a path covered with boards,
Adonai passed until he stood before a small edifice, built of
gray stone and standing among withered trees. The sun shone
brightly upon its window panes, and even gave a cheerful glow
to a high wall, which arose from one extremity to the edifice.
Adonai passed the threshold, and presently stood in a large
chamber, where a comfortable fire was burning. Near an oaken
table, which was filled with bottles and glasses, sat a man of
cheerful features, his feet upon the stove, and his hands in the
armholes of his waistcoat. There was a wreath of tobacco
smoke around his smiling features, and a pipe in his mouth.
Adonai stood before him, dusty and wayworn, and yet the
Man of the Place could not help starting in his chair, when he
beheld that youthful countenance, with its blue eyes shining in
saddened thought, and its golden hair tinted by the afternoon
sun.
"Do you want to buy or sell?" said the Man, before Adonai
could speak a word. Strange it was that the words "Buy and
Sell" was the first greeting which Adonai received in the land
of the New World. Adonai gazed upon him with a look of
blank wonder—but impelled by a voice within him—answered
with these words:
"First let me behold your wares. After I have seen them I will
tell you whether I want to buy or sell."
In one part of the room the white wall was varied by a small
square space, which looked like a casement covered by boards.

The good-humored man arose and opened the window, and
said, "Look!" and blew a whistle which was suspended from
his neck.
Wondering, Adonai advanced. He looked through the aper-

rounded by a massive wall, which was built with great solidity,
and which cast a gloom upon the space which it encircled.
Three sides of the wall were bounded by the dead wall, and the
fourth side was also a wall, but pierced with windows and
doors. The windows were covered by iron bars; the doors
looked as though they led into funeral vaults.
"Where are your wares?" said Adonai.
The good-humored man smiled and again blew his whistle,
when lo! a crowd of men and women and children came run-
ning through the narrow door, into the yard bounded by
gloomy walls.
And they ranged themselves in a line before the eyes of
Adonai. And Adonai saw that some of the men were black, and
some of the women also, but there were many whose coun-
tenance were as fair as that of the good-humored man by
his side.
The scene bewildered Adonai.
"I would like to see your wares," he said.

his pipe, and laughed merrily. "I will sell you that man for

Adonai felt his heart grow sick within him, and staggered
back from the window.

deep for words, distorted his face.

written in a book, would not be believed by one man in ten.
And the man who would write them in a book would be

at a stake.2
For those sights and those words, enacted and spoken in the
City of Washington, were a blasphemy upon every good
thought which God has implanted in the hearts of his creatures,
and a blasphemy upon the truth and purity of God Himself.
And it is to the honor of humanity, that those sights and

young, and in suffering old and worn, wrapped about his
slender form a threadbare coat, and said:

where pollution wraps itself in fine apparel—where Women,
driven by extreme want, sell more than life, for a cup of wine,
a bed of down, and—a grave in Potter's Field—where the appe-
tites of the Rich Libertine feed upon the damnation of the
daughters of the poor, whom society has denied work and
bread.
And the Rich Man, when he saw all this, began to weep—
for God had not forgotten him, and there was still a human
heart in his breast.
"This," he said, "this is why you write always for the Poor!"
But the Poor Man did not directly answer, for the contest
between Good and Evil was strong within him—and now, as at
other times, when he remembered what he had felt and seen in
the large city, he forgot the forgiveness of the Gospel, and his
swarthy face corrugated with a ferocious hatred, as he won-

where pollution wraps itself in fine apparel-where Women,
driven by extreme want, sell more than life, for a cup of wine,
a bed of down, and-a grave in Potter's Field-where the appe-
tites of the Rich Libertine feed upon the damnation of the
daughters of the poor, whom society has denied work and
bread.
And the Rich Man, when he saw all this, began to weep-
for God had not forgotten him, and there was still a human
heart in his breast.
"This," he said, "this is why you write always for the Poor!"
But the Poor Man did not directly answer, for the contest
between Good and Evil was strong within him-and now, as at
other times, when he remembered what he had felt and seen in
the la1·ge city, he forgot the forgiveness of the Gospel, and his
swarthy face corrugated with a ferocious hatred, as he won-
dered to himself why the judgment of God delayed so long.
He stood choked by his emotion, struggling with the bad
within him, until a better spirit came over him, and he answered
mildly-"Yes, this, what you have seen with me tonight, is why
I write always for the Poor."

Rich to grow merry upon their graves. And they saw him, as
he was there alone, in that room, turn to the memorials of the
dead people of his kindred, which were upon his table, and

heard him as he wished bitterly, that the clod which rested
upon the brows of those dead were upon his own; that the still-
ness which had fallen upon them would also fall upon him. For
he was weary of struggling, and the hope which had lighted
him so long flickered low—he was anxious to be where the
contrast of hideous wealth and hideous poverty should sting
his Soul no more—after years of hardship, such as might turn
a heart of stone—he was anxious to be at rest. To him then as
he sat alone, the grave came up like a vision of a narrow door
to a Better Land.
And Adonai, who, with the Arisen Washington, had watched
the struggles of the Poor Man, whose many faults, may be,
were mingled with virtues as strong and resolute—Adonai
drew near and shook him rudely by the shoulder.2
"Why dost thou rail at the vices of society?" he said. "Art
thou so pure, so moral, that thou canst call the tyrants of the
world to account?" 1
At first the Poor Alan made no reply in words, but pointing
to the memorials of his dead, which lay upon the table—pointing
to a record of his hard and bitter life, which was also there—

the wall. These letters were I. H. S.

was then living with his little family on North Sixth Street in
Philadelphia. One morning, the great writer Poe came to the
door of his office near Third and Chestnut Streets, in a most
deplorable condition. He explained to Lippard that he was ill,
hungry and penniless; that he had spent the night in Moy-
amensing prison, charged with drunkenness; when in fact he
did not drink; his wretched state being due entirely to being
sick in mind and body; due to extreme want. Lippard took
him to his home, attended to his wants, and had him lie down
and rest, while he himself went for assistance.
Within a short time Lippard succeeded in collecting from his
own friends sufficient funds to pay the poet's fare to Baltimore,
with an additional sum for future needs. Later in the afternoon,
Lippard took the poet to the station and placed him on the
train bound South, and bade him good-bye for the last time.
After Poe's death, it was Lippard who in his own weekly,
The Quaker City, October 20, 1849, expressed his deep feelings
for his friend and defended him against the character assassin
of one Griswold.

phia and elsewhere in the country. These riots in reality were
not Anti-Catholic, but the result of a family feud transferred
from Ireland to this country and this caused him to further
lose faith in the church—all churches.

to the doctrines of the Nazarene. He was in no sense a church-
man, but he, like the founders of the American Republic, was
deeply spiritual, sincerely religious, and this is made clear in
every word he wrote on the subject of religion in his Legends
in the book, THE NAZARENE, and in other of his publications.
That the real facts may be on record, we quote short state-
ments, not entirely verbatim, from his writings.
Religion, my brethren, does not consist in marble pillars, nor
in costly vestments, much less in rituals and long prayers. It
is not a matter of creeds and dogmas. Religion is of the Spirit
which dwells within the Souls of men and makes itself FELT in
silence when man's thoughts are more or less in abeyance.
When you have been successful in bottling the sunshine, and
lay a tax upon the air of Heaven, then you may attempt to
harness religion in the gear of creeds. Religion is that confidence
in God which impels our trust in Him. It is the sublimation of
the affection which exists between the trusting child and its
father.
The child, having full confidence in its father, will make
every effort to do the father's will, without doubt and without
question or reason of its own. It will trust the father through
every storm of doubt and adversity, satisfied that "he doeth all
things well"; it will hang its Soul upon his word, and stake its
fate in his hands.
Religion is that trust in God which is hope to us when we
stand by the grave of a beloved one and know that here is the
parting, but that we shall meet again in happier environments.
It is that confidence, which in the hour of death, assures us that
we are not dying, only "going home" for a brief period of rest.
Marriage is religion. The love of a husband for his wife is re-
ligion. The affection of a brother for a sister is religion. The
love of father for son, of mother for daughter, or mother for
son, or father for daughter—all these loves are religion—the
religion of that beloved disciple of the Nazarene who so well
said: "God is love, and they who love know God."

Profiteering and money changing is not religion. Exploitation
is not religion. Marble pillared churches are not religion, though
in themselves not evil. The swindling of the poor men by
learned Bishops is not religion. Robbing your neighbor, whether
rich or poor, six days in the week, and going to church on the
seventh is not religion. Devoting a life-time to gathering pennies
is not religion, though money and possessions in themselves are
not wrong, nor in themselves the source of evil. Preaching a
creed which teaches John the Methodist to hate James the
Catholic is not religion. Religion is not necessarily found in ele-
gant churches, nor in prettily bound hymn books—much less
is it heard from the lips of those with smooth speech; the polite
preacher, or the Sodom and Gomorrah screech of the wrath-
preacher.
You, I, we are religion. When God saw fit to create us, he
made us so. When we are abroad in the fields, on a clear day, in
the sunny air, by the waterside, among the flowers we FEEL our
hearts go out to God, the creator of all these beautiful things,
in thankfulness; that feeling, my brethren, is the highest form
of religion that man can know. On a dark day we can see God
BEYOND the leaden clouds.
When death comes to our homes, as it must to all of us
sooner or later, we trust in him who gave, and in the silence of
the chamber where death momentarily rules, when the one
whom we loved is still and silent, we feel that God is with us,
aye, within us. God is in that Soul which has just departed and
left us alone. We know that the presence of God is close to us,
and we feel "within ourselves the certain truth that he did not
create us to be miserable or sorrowful; that his brightest rain-
bows succeed the darkest clouds as does the sunshine the heavi-
est shower. We know; that He, in truth, 1s the Father of us all.
Do not speak of religion as of a thing which you can confine
in a creed or jail up in a church. God Himself, through the
voice which speaks in all his beautiful creations, the flowers in
the fields, the trees in the hills, the green pastures and waterways

wealth which kills all his nobler faculties. Make of him a free
man, dwelling on his own land, and cultivating at one and the
same time his physical and his Inunortal nature. And always
remember, whether in sunshine or in clouds, that the Master's
words are truer than earth or stars and that the Master's heart
beats in YOUR breast, when you think and act a deed of Love
or kindness.
Away with all controversy of creeds. Away with all theo-
logical quarrels which for eighteen hundred years have made
tears for the angels and laughter for devils. As for me, I care
but little for your beautiful edifices and marble altars; and am
inclined to despise your stone creeds and marble religion. For
me, I much desire to KNOW the Master as he appeared in humble
creed, while he walked the dusty road of Palestine, and talked
to poor men, and took them to meat and drink.
I had rather clutch the hem of his robe than sit in the grandest
synod, or kneel at the richest altar. I am a wmderer between
two eternities. I am alone, sick and heart-weary. I seek peace
and consolation in the helping hand of a brother, which is f,1r
dearer to me than all the creeds in the world. I am a weary man
whose feet have been torn by the way-side fiim, whose heart
the world has jaded and wrung. I am feeling my way to the
Master who speaks in words that are plain and with a loving
heart.
Brothers, let us March! Hand in hand, shoulder to shoulder,
in companies, in regiments, in armies, let us march. Come,
doubters who pride yourselves upon WHAT YOU oo NOT DELIEVE!
Come ye bigots who pride yourselves upon what you do be-
lieve! Come hungry, homeless, and despairing, come all, let us
march! Let the word go out to tell all the world, sound every
tongue, repeat it in every heart with throbs of convulsive joy,

leave your sterile doubts. Bigots leave your dead creeds.
Scholars leave your superficial learning which has taught you
no more than to despair in God and man. Fall into line, all of
you and let us march. Let us walk by the light which shines in
the Master's eyes.
The Cross of the Master is in the dust, let us not attempt to
walk over it, but let us claim it as our own, for the Cross is
God's and Humanity's, it is the emblem of justice and of right-
eousness and humility. Place the compass in its center, and you
will be able to describe the broad circle of Humanity. Let us
march! Earth has seen many armies, but never one like this!
Let us march hand in hand, an army of humanity seeking the
Master's face! Let your hymns resound my brothers, join every
voice, let every heart be filled with music, sing as you go,
yonder stands the Master and beckons us as our songs fill heaven
and earth, for its chorus is BROTHERHOOD!
This new world, the world of a Washington, Jefferson
and a Lincoln, from the very hour Columbus was inspired
to re-discover it, has been set apart by God, as prophesied
thousands of years ago by Isaiah, as the last altar of human
Brotherhood. That being so, shall the evils of other worlds
find dominance here? Shall they be permitted to repeat
here the self-same tragedy of their contentions? Must their
respective dogmas be again attested by the sacrifice of
millions?
Sects shall die. Unity shall be given perpetual life.
The division of mankind into sects and classes will be known
no longer and all men shall be recognized for WHAT THEY ARE,
what they have done, and what they ARE doing; the drone shall
be the least in the great new kingdom of man.
All evils by whatever name, which undermine or divide the
family or individuals, shall be destroyed.

God who set apart this great Continent, as the scene of His
last experiment with Humanity, as the Homestead of Free men,
will, by the help of those who accept these doctrines and truths,
save us from the domination of priests, kings, all selfish interests
who neither accept nor obey the Law; from all evils which
have desolated the old world and driven its exiles into the new.
And woe, woe here and hereafter, to the church, sect or
organization of men which shall, on any pretense, endorse or
advocate on this soil the same evils, which have made the old
world a hell on earth. These evils we will learn to resist by per-
suasion, by meeting sect and party with the voice of BROTHER-

soften the hearts of the oppressor, then shall the wrath of an
outraged God and his defied Law bring destruction upon those

And then, leaving the hateful strife of controversy, and the

PARTIAL LIST OF WORKS BY LIPPARD
Lippard was but twenty years of age when his first work:
PHILIPPE DE AGRAMONT, appeared in the Saturday Evening Post,
July 9, 1842. From then on during the next ten years, he wrote
and had published a greater number of works than any other
author who lived and labored four times that many years. The
sale of his published works was greater than that of any other
author of that or any previous time.
Herbert Tracy; or, the Legends of the Black Rangers. A
Romance of the Battle of Germantown, 1842.
Original Revolutionary Chronicles; the Battle-Day of Ger-
mantown, 1843.
The Layde Annabel; or, the Doom of a Poisoner, 1844.
The Quaker City; or, The Monks of Monk's Hall. An expose
of the evils rampant in a large city (Philadelphia), then almost
without law and order, 1845. Because of his almost brutal frank-
ness in exposing evils, Lippard was severely condemned, though
no attempt was made to disprove any of the things he exposed.

Nazarene, more words were written about Lincoln than of
any other man who ever lived.
Lincoln accomplished all that destiny had planned for him
and no man can do more. He died by the assassin's hand
April 15, 1865.
Of Lincoln as of Washington, it may be said that their
works are their eternal monuments. To say much more of
them would belittle their accomplishments in a world filled
with selfishness.

France; the Double Eagle of Prussia,
and Order of the Rose of England, was
born in the city of New York, October
8, 182 5. His father was William Bev-
erly Randolph, a nephew of John
Randolph of Virginia; his mother, Flora
Beverly, a native of Vermont, was of
mixed East Indian, French, English,
German and Madagascan blood, not of
negro desccnt1
as stated by so many
writers, wholly ignorant of the facts.
Randolph's mother died when he
was but five years of age. A half-sister
took him into her house, without,

however, making a home for him, or in the least endeavoring
to educate him, or in any way guiding or instructing him. In
order to exist he had to lead the life of a beggar-child, minus
schooling or moral-spiritual training, with the sole exception
of one winter in a public school.
At the age of fifteen his life at the home became unbear-
able. He ran away and became a sailor boy, a life led by him
until he was twenty. During this time he visited almost every
part of the world and being keen of nature, gathered knowl-
edge and experience, which he put to good use in later life.
Of his birth, Randolph himself wrote—and the analysis is
keen and deep—and accounts, at least in greater part, for his
extraordinary life:
"I was born in love, of a loving mother, and what she felt,
that I lived. I am the exact living counterpart of her feelings,
intense passions, volcanic, fiery; her love, like high heaven,
deeper than death; her agony, terrible as a thousand racks;
her HOPE AND TRUST FERVENT, ENDURING, SOLID AS STEEL;
UNBREAKABLE AS THE LIGHTNING, WHICH BLAZES IN THE SKY.
Her loneliness, I have been a hermit all my days, even in the
midst of men; in a word, I am the exact expression of that
woman's state of body, mind, emotion, Soul, longings, spirit,
aspirations, WHEN SHE TOOK IN CHARGE THE INCARNATION OF THE
SOUL OF HIM WHO NOW IS PENNING THESE LINES."
Another writer who was acquainted with the parents of
Randolph and had watched Randolph's later career, said:
with Randolph and his life, who, unable to say anything disparaging
about him to fall back on the oft repeated canard that he was of negro
descent. Originally this conclusion may have been based on the Herald's
College record that his mother was of mixed blood and perhaps wilfully,
at least in many instances, forgetting to mention that in this commingling
of bloods there was none of the negro. According to Herald's College
of England, she was of Madagascan, French, Spanish, Indian and Oriental,
besides Cymrian, Teutonic and Moorish descent, not that there would be
any shame attached to his birth, had there been negro blood in his veins;
many negroes having achieved fame and honor.

who designs to labor for the enlightenment and elevation of
mankind must take it for granted that he will be denounced and
derided, and must be prepared to forgive his oppressors and
forget the ill, for they truly know not what they do.
"The ignorance of the multitude is great, and the majority of
mankind are not prepared to understand or appreciate many
of the most simple and evident truths. He who is unable to bear
patiently all abuse, scorn and indifference, should not dare to
enter the field of reform. But he who has prepared himself to
accept poverty, deprivation, suffering and the disdain of those
of his day; to labor on whether his contemporaries hear or
refuse to listen, he shall do a work whose issue shall be ever-
lasting, and whose memory shall not perish, but be resurrected
after all of his time has passed on and is forgotten."
Prior to 1854, Randolph had already become thoroughly
familiar with the teachings of the Magnetists of France; with
the precepts of Saint Germain and Cagliostro on Magnetic
vision. These he compared with the inculcations of the Oriental
seers and the writings of Paracelsus, Lane, Cuila Vilmara, Jen-
nings, Lytton and others and was engaged in writing what later
became his work—SEERSHIP. However, the work of Seership
was temporarily delayed by his preparation to become, first:
Supreme Grand Master of the Supreme Dome of the Rosy
Cross of France and, second: Supreme Grand Master of the
Fraternitas for the western world.
On his return to America, after his second trip to the Orient,
Dr. Randolph was made acquainted with two members of
the Council of Three of the Fraternitas, Drs. Fontaine and
Bergevin of New York, who in turn gave him a letter of intro-
duction to W. G. Palgrave of London, one of the members of
the Inner Council of the Fraternitas of England, who in turn
introduced Dr. Randolph to Hargrave Jennings. General Ethan
Hitchcock introduced Dr. Randolph to the German Inner
Council, and also sponsored him in France.

BOOK OF ROSICRUCIJE
who designs to labor for the enlightenment and elevation of
mankind must take it for granted that he will be denounced and
derided, and must be prepared to forgive his oppressors and
forget the ill, for they truly know not what they do.
"The ignorance of the multitude is great, and the majority of
mankind are not prepared to understand or appreciate many
of the most simple and evident truths. He who is unable to bear
patiently all abuse, scorn and indifference, should not dare to
enter the field of reform. But he who has prepared himself to
accept poverty, deprivation, suffering and the disdain of those
of his day; to labor on whether his contemporaries hear or
refuse to listen, he shall do a work whose issue shall be ever-
lasting, and whose memory shall not perish, but be resurrected
after a!l of his time has passed on and is forgotten."
Prior to 1854, Randolph had already become thoroughly
familiar with the teachings of the Magnetists of France; with
the precepts of Saint Germain and Cagliostro on Magnetic
vision. These he compared with the inculcations of the Oriental
seers and the writings of Paracelsus, Lane, Cuila Vilmara, Jen-
nings, Lytton and others and was engaged in writing what later
became his work-sEERSHIP. However, the work of Seership
was temporarily delayed by his preparation to become, first:
Supreme Grand Master of the Supreme Dome of the Rosy
Cross of France and, second: Supreme Grand Master of the
Fraternitas for the western world.
On his return to America, after his second trip to the Orient,
Dr. Randolph was made acquainted with two members of
the Council of Three of the Fratenzitas, Drs. Fontaine and
Bergevin of New York, who in turn gave him a letter of intro-
duction to W. G. Palgrave of London, one of the members of
the Inner Council of the Fraternitas of England, who in turn
introduced Dr. Randolph to Hargrave Jennings. General Ethan
Hitchcock introduced Dr. Randolph to the German Inner
Council, and also sponsored him in France.
182 ACTORS IN THE ARCANE DRAMA
During the period between 1854 and 1856, it was decided by
Count Guinotti and the World Council then sitting in Paris,
that the time had come for a division of authority; the establish-
ment of a Supreme Grand Master for Europe [England not
included] and one for the Western World. This was finally
consummated in 1858, as already mentioned.
In 1858 the Supreme Grand Dome met in Paris. The Con-
clave was opened by the Supreme Grand Master Levi. After
the opening of the meeting in solemn form, Levi turned over
the Wand to the Supreme World Hierarch, Count Guinotti,
who, in ancient form, closed the Supreme Grand Dome and
opened under the grand ceremonial of L'ORDRE DU L1s. Levi,
in due order, at the behest of the Supreme Hierarch, gave
up his seat as Supreme Grand Master of the Supreme Grand
Dome* and Randolph was inducted before the Altar of the
Three Flew de Lis, and took the oath of both L'Ordre du Lis
and as a Supreme Grand Master of the Supreme Grand Dome.
After taking his seat, the Grand Ritual was performed, he
stepped down from the chair, handed the Wand to Count
Guinotti, who proceeded to recall Supreme Grand Master Levi
to his seat and the proper officers proceeded to Initiate Dr.
Randolph into his office as Supreme Grand Master of the Fra-
ternitas Ros<£ Crucis for the Western World [North, Central
and South America] and the Isles of the Sea.
On his return to America, Randolph occupied himself first
of all in the formation of the Supreme Grand Dome for the
Fraternitas, which up to that time was governed by the Secret
Councils of Three and Seven, and to the preparation of texts.
This was accomplished by 1860. Randolph then decided on a
world tour for two specific purposes: (a) to cement his fellow-
ship with all the members of the various Councils of the world;
•In all instances where a candidate is to be inducted into a higher
iffice than previously occupied, the senior incumbent in such office,
temporarily vacates his seat so that the candidate may be properly
inducted.

to contact as many as possible of the active Rose Cross or
Philosophic Initiates, and (b) to collect material for several
books he had in mind.
In the summer of 1861 he left for a ten week series of
lectures in San Francisco, and to establish the Fraternitas of the
Western World on the shores of the Pacific.
After concluding this engagement, he visited Europe and the
Orient to gather information respecting human antiquity and
ontology, treading the spots made sacred because of their asso-
ciation and connection with the Nazarene, Mohammed, Plato
and other great reformers, who for their particular age, gave
the world a workable exposition of the Divine Law governing
human behavior.
He successfully visited England, Scotland, Ireland, France,
Malta, Egypt, Arabia, Syria, Palestine, Turkey and Greece. The
first result of these travels was his celebrated book, Pre-Adamite
Man, a work dedicated by direct request to President Lincoln,
then a member of the Council of Three of the Fraternitas. This
work concluded, Dr. Randolph, also at the President's request,
went to New Orleans to establish schools for the education of
the freed children,6 a work somewhat marred by the wholly
selfish interest of those who were against almost everything that
both Lincoln and Randolph held dear.
During his visit to Syria, Randolph was permitted to finish
his study of the Ansaireh secret teachings and was made a priest
of the Ansaireh, something theretofore unknown. The result of
these studies among the Ansaireh of Syria and his Initiation
into their cult, was the interpretation of their teachings suitable
to the western mind, as contained in his master text EULIS, a
work for which evil minds persecuted and prosecuted him, but
for which he was finally vindicated.
Alexander Dumas became a firm friend of Randolph during

insufficient, then Randolph possesses that constituent of great-
ness. If greatness means power and ingeniousness to concentrate
the gifts and talents of many on one point, to inspire others
with sympathy and enthusiasm for the same end, and to make
them gladly contribute toward it, then he was great. If it is
great to see from the earliest manhood the main end of one's
individual life, steadily pursuing it to the very end with the
highest gifts of nature, then he was great. If greatness means
to soar high in the one selected sphere; to be trivial or puerile
in none—on the contrary, to retain a vivid sympathy with all
that is noble, beautiful, true and just, then he was great. If it is
a characteristic of greatness to be original and strike out on new
paths; indeed, even to prophetic anticipations, then he was
great. If greatness requires marked individuality, which yet
takes up all the main threads that give distinctness to the times
we live in, then he was great. If greatness means an inventive
and interleaguing imagination that gathers what is scattered,

full of inspiring ambition, but free from a desire to keep com-

that destroys true greatness.
"No one ever heard from his lips any indication from which
it might be surmised that he shared in that superciliousness with
which modern philosophers and thinkers frequently look upon
other sciences and branches of knowledge. On the contrary, he
took the deepest interest in human society, and all the branches
which treat of men and social beings. He never fell into the
grevious error of considering matter, space, force and time of
higher importance than mind, society, right and goodness."

A few advantages are purchased at an enormous cost. A
short, brilliant, erratic career, more kicks than pra1ses;
more flattering leeches than fast friends; rich and joyous
today, houseless and suffering the pangs of hell tomorrow;

How weary and heavy the heart must be to pen such lines

BOOK OF ROSICRUCLE 187
One of Randolph's Acolytes, after the conflict between
justice and injustice, penned these lines of him in which he
found immortal truths and the exposition of the Arcane laws
affecting human existence.
"The heart alone can write of and for the heart. . . . The
heart that has throbbed to the music of its own and other's
anguish—that has sickened at the greed and ingratitude, the
unfeeling rush and scramble, the trampling down of other torn
and bleeding hearts—until it has turned away from the world,
all forgetful of the greatest benefactors, and in solitude showers
upon its enemies thoughts such as only the great and good are
capable of thinking.
"This greatest thought—that which the world will yet build
monuments to—is not so much the corruption and abuse of
society, as it is the remedy for the gigantic evils which stare
civilization and heaven out of countenance.
"Religion has yet to learn the fact which science is slowly
demonstrating, and which Dr. Randolph so well understood;
that salvation must be physical and mental as well as spiritual
[This is Levi's law of the duad, the holy trinity which is part of
all that exists]. There can be no half-way work about it. We
are as much [in very truth, much more], physical as spiritual,
and so long as we remain so, we must have a body and a mind
in addition to spirit.
"Love has its physical moods and modes as well as its spiritual
inclinations. The basis of a full love is health, and the basis of
health is harmony, or a well-balanced union of the body, mind
and spirit—the equilibrium all Philosophic Initiates have taught.

we reach the mind, and through its crystal walls the spirit.
Spirit [the life of the Soul] is God. It rules the world, and in

and how can it use the body if that body be loaded down with
the filth and rubbish of false conditions; false conditions that
are the result of our own follies and acts, likewise with diseases
of the body? I am very well aware of the great hue and cry
about "pre-natal" conditions; but I have yet to learn that the
child in embryo is not the cause of the peculiarities of the
mother while enceinte. In either case, we who love and loathe
cannot shirk the responsibilities and penalties of our acts, no
matter what the cause. The measure of humanity is love—not
the bastard thing accepted by society as love; but the heart's
love based on physical health and mental purity. How many
of those bearing the human form have actually reached the
status of being truly human? The measure of Godhood in man
is his power of je/f-control. How many are there not blown
hither and yon, like dry leaves in an autumn wind, by trifles
beneath the notice of a great mind? Many are tormented to dis-
traction for a new dress, or for the want of something a more
fortunate neighbor has, and making a hell of what is called a
home; where heaven, all smiles and joy, should sit all the year
'round. How devoid of manhood to vend one's way homeward,
nervous and sour of disposition because, forsooth, some one
has over-reached or thwarted him in his business?
"All there is in us worth Immortalizing, worth preserving
and presenting to the Infinite is our love nature and our Will
power; which must begin at home [as does charity], if at all.
By virtue of our Will we control ourselves, and when we are
perfect masters of ourselves—our passions, thoughts, desires,
etc., we will be Masters of God's universe of lesser Nature.
How many are there who can truly say in the face of adverse
storms, and feel what they say: 'Let the winds blow high or
low, the thunders of evil roll, and the lightnings glare, I am
above it all; Do your worst—I was here first!'

love based on physical health and mental purity. How many
of those bearing the human form have actually reached the
status of being truly human? The measure of Godhood in man
is his power of self-control. How many are there not blown
hither and yon, like dry leaves in an autumn wind, by trifles
beneath the notice of a great mind? Many are tormented to dis-
traction for a new dress, or for the want of something a more
fortunate neighbor has, and making a hell of what is called a
home; where heaven, all smiles and joy, should sit all the year
'round. How devoid of manhood to vend one's way homeward,
nervous and sour of disposition because, forsooth, some one
has over-reached or thwarted him in his business?
"All there is in us worth Immortalizing, worth preserving
and presenting to the Infinite is our love nature and our Will
power; which must begin at home [as does charity], if at all.
By virtue of our Will we control ourselves, and when we are
perfect masters of ourselves-our passions, thoughts, desires,
etc., we will be Masters of God's universe of lesser Nature.
How many are there who can truly say in the face of adverse
storms, and feel what they say: 'Let the winds blow high or
low, the thunders of evil roll, and the lightnings glare, I am
above it all; Do your worst-I was here first!'
"Disease and Purity are antagonists; strangers! Do you fool-
ishly believe that death is going to do for you THAT WHICH You
FAILED TO DO FOR YOURSELF AND THAT DEATH WILL ELIMINATE

Foolish thought! We make our summer and winter ourselves,
and you and I will be tomorrow what we make of ourselves
today. Eternity! Today is eternity. A truly healthy [normal]
mind in an impure or diseased body is an impossibility."
Dr. Randolph, like Saint Germain and Cagliostro, both Ini-
tiates of the Orient, in all his writings had very little to say of
the Fraternity over which he had the honor to preside. Perhaps
the most lucid and revealing statement made by him was during
the trial in 1872, when it was necessary to make some mention
of it:
"This Order of men [over which I preside] is divided
into three parts [ the Trinity, or Duad of Levi], correspond-
ing to the UNIVERSAL AND MULTIFORM TRINITY. The first
division is known as Volantia, because its main object is
the culture of the human Will. The Division upon which
this is based is thousands of years old, and in Oriental
lands is known as 'Merek el GebeP or the Gate of Light.3
"The second division is known as Rosicrucia, and in the
East is known as the Door of the Dawn, in the West as
The Door. It is of Ansairetic origin. The distinctive degree
of this division is Decretism, or the culture of the Triple
Will. It is mystic, profound; has as its object the develop-
ment of all inherent and but-little-dreamed-of human ener-
gies and powers, not with reference to things of the fleet-
ing moment, but of stable and eternal principles, having
their rise on earth, their culmination in the eternal beyond.

RESUME
Due to the importance of Dr. Randolph's position as the first
Supreme Grand Master of the Fraternitas Ros<e Crucis of the
Western World, a resume of his activities is not out of order.
Born October 8, 1825, in New York City.
His mother left him an orphan at the age of five.
Enlisted as a sailor boy at the age of fifteen.
Travelled in many countries until he was twenty years old,
/.<?., 1845.
Between the years of 1845 and 1850 he studied medicine and
the Arcane science.
In 1850 he was in Germany and was admitted to the meeting
held by the Fraternitas Ros<e Crucis at Frankfort on Main as a
member of the First degree. There he met General Hitchcock,
who quickly recognized in him the person to become Supreme
Grand Master of the Western World. He was there introduced
to Charles Trinius and Count Guinotti.
In Paris during 1854 he finished his studies in the practice of
skrying by means of water, ink and the magic Mirrors, as
the Soul are as virile and as applicable today as they were in the age in
which he lived and expounded his philosophy.

an early date, and greatly oblige.
"Yours respectfully,
"DON LA VELLE."
Dowd was accepted as a Neophyte by Randolph and shortly
after the foregoing letter was written he entered upon his study
and training. The trials and travail he passed through are
described in his work, THE DOUBLE MAN. Unfortunately, the
republication of the book fell into unfriendly hands and a part
of Chapter Two was substituted with material derogatory to
his instructor and guide. This was later rectified.
In passing, it may be well to state that Dowd's trials and
tribulations were many times multiplied by the fact that he had
previously been imbued with the practice of spiritualism. He
did not at once substitute the teachings of Eulis, hence the maze
through which it was necessary for him to pass in order to
become a free man; a Philosophic Initiate.
Dr. Randolph considered Dowd to be of such great impor-
tance to both the Fraternity and himself that he devoted more
than the ordinary period of time to his instructions and guid-
ance. He helped Dowd not only to free himself from the mesh
in which he had become entangled, but prepared him for the
office of Supreme Grand Master of the Fraternitas. His progress
was such that he was admitted as a full Rose Cross in 1870,
selected by Randolph as his successor and Hierarch of Eulis in
1871, and took his seat of the Triple Order, directly after the
passing of Dr. Randolph.
After succeeding to his high office as Supreme Grand Master
of the Fraternitas and in order to be free to travel and lecture,
Dowd continued his business as a commercial photographer,
dividing his time between writing the various books and his
business.

an early date, and greatly oblige.
"Yours respectfully,
"DON LA VELLE."
Dowd was accepted as a Neophyte by Randolph and shortly
after the foregoing letter was written he entered upon his study
and training. The trials and travail he passed through are
described in his work, THE DouBLE MAN. Unfortunately, the
republication of the book fell into unfriendly hands and a part
of Chapter Two was substituted with material derogatory to
his instructor and guide. This was later rectified.
In passing, it may be well to state that Dowd's trials and
tribulations were many times multiplied by the fact that he had
previously been imbued with the practice of spiritualism. He
did not at once substitute the teachings of Eulis, hence the maze
through which it was necessary for him to pass in order to
become a free man; a Philosophic Initiate.
Dr. Randolph considered Dowd to be of such great impor-
tance to both the Fraternity and himself that he devoted more
than the ordinary period of time to his instructions and guid-
ance. He helped Dowd not only to free himself from the mesh
in which he had become entangled, but prepared him for the
office of Supreme Grand Master of the Fraternitas. His progress
was such that he was admitted as a full Rose Cross in 1870,
selected by Randolph as his successor and Hierarch of Eulis in
1871, and took his seat of the Triple Order, directly after the
passing of Dr. Randolph.
After succeeding to his high office as Supreme Grand Master
of the Fraternitas and in order to be free to travel and lecture,
Dowd continued his business as a commercial photographer,
dividing his time between writing the various books and his
husiness.
Shortly after assuming the office of Supreme Grand Master
BOOK OF ROSICRUCI^E 197
in 1875, members of the Council of Seven residing in Phila-
delphia prevailed upon Dowd to establish a Grand Lodge in
Philadelphia. Dowd complied with their wishes and this was
consummated in 1878 under the title of The Temple of the Rosy
Cross. While living in Philadelphia he devoted his time to the
writing of his book, The Temple of the Rosy Cross, copy-
righted in 1882.
Shortly after the completion of the Temple in Philadelphia,
Dowd started on a lecture tour, travelling a number of years. At
the conclusion of his lecture tour, many of those who had
contacted Dr. Randolph during his stay in San Francisco, pre-
vailed upon Dowd to come to San Francisco and establish a
western center. This second Temple under Dowd was accom-
plished in 1882. While laboring in San Francisco and on the west
coast, Dowd rewrote his Temple of the Rosy Cross and estab-
lished the Rosy Cross Publishing Company for the publication
of his writings.
Following the publication of the enlarged edition of The
Temple of the Rosy Cross, brethren in Denver prevailed upon
him to come to that city to deliver a course of lectures and
establish a center of study. While in Denver he wrote his
Evolution of Immortality, under his Philosophic Initiate name
of Rosicruci<e, and in a special chapter so signed, gives a most
comprehensive review of just what this mystic association of
men is;s of the purposes and teachings of the Fraternity, Tem-
ple, O'.ler lit1d Brotherhood, so known during the various
stager am1 ages of its history.
This work Dowd dedicated to the Queen of the Rosy Cross,
SHE WHO 1s NAMELESS, which will be understood only by those
who have succeeded in attaining Philosophic Initiation.

198 ACTORS IN THE ARCANE DRAMA
Dowd was next called to Texas, where he labored for a
number of years, during which period he lectured and wrote his
book Regeneration, as part two of The Temple of the Rosy
Cross. This was a natural sequence, because Regeneration goes
hand in hand, and is the basis or foundation, of Philosophic
Initiation, John III, 5:7.
"Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot
enter into the Kingdom of God. That which is born of the
flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit,
Marvel not that I said unto thee, ye must be born again."
Dowd's next and last book was The Way, which, as its name
implies, attempts to point out to Neophytes the Way they must
follow if they seek to attain to Philosophic Initiation, to become
Rose Cross.
Freeman B. Dowd resigned as Supreme Grand Master of the
Temple of the Rosy Cross and Hierarch of Eulis, April 15, 1907,
and Edward H. Brown, of Salem, Mass., took his seat.
During the period Dowd was undergoing instructions and
training under Randolph, another great Soul was doing likewise,
this was John Heaney, of Buckley, Illinois.

THE DOOR
John Heaney was an Inconnu, one of the Unknown Initiates
who sought to do his full part to his fellow men but remain
himself unknown. His wishes, like those of others of like nature,
have always been respected and will continue to be respected.
When Dowd took his seat as Supreme Grand Master and
Hierarch of Eulis, he at once selected John Heaney as "The
Door," with his seat at Buckley, Iroquois County, Illinois. Dowd
publicly recognized Heaney's office as such, in the publication
of the authoritative text book, The Temple of the Rosy Cross.

member of the Council was requested to relay these doubts to
his sponsor, Count A. de Guinotti. The reply written by one of
the European Council, is in the Archives of the Fraternitas.
"When Dr. Phelps affiliated with the Ordre Illuminat<e
of which Count A. de Guinotti (the Heliobas of Marie
Corelli's Romance of Two Worlds) was the Hierophant,
Dr. Phelps questioned his fitness and ability to take any
prominent position in its activities, but de Guinotti knew
him better than he knew himself and he was assigned to
the care of the back door, to take charge of those who,
fainting by the way, or discouraged by the apparent ob-
stacles in the way, were given up in despair. We called him
, or 'the Keeper of the Door.' He soon learned
that there was but one door of The Temple, and that the
entrance and exit were the same. Our Master said, 'I am

member of the Council was requested to relay these doubts to
his sponsor, Count A. de Guinotti. The reply written by one of
the European Council, is in the Archives of the Fraternitas.
"When Dr. Phelps affiliated with the Ordre llluminatee
of which Count A. de Guinotti (the Heliobas of Marie
Corelli's Romance of Two JVorlds) was the Hierophant,
Dr. Phelps questioned his fitness and ability to take any
prominent position in its activities, but de Guinotti knew
him better than he knew himself and he was assigned to
the care of the back door, to take charge of those who,
fainting by the way, or discouraged by the apparent ob-
stacles in the way, were given up in despair. We called him
.........., or 'the Keeper of the Door.' He soon learned
that there was but one door of The Temple, and that the
entrance and exit were the same. Our Master said, 'I am
the door, by me if any man enter in he shall be safe, and
go in and go out, and he shall find pasture.' " 1

ALEXANDER WILDER
Alexander Wilder, Physician, Journalist, Philosopher, Writer,
Medical iconoclast, neo-Platonist, friend of man, Philosophic
Initiate and Member of the Council of Three, was born in
Verona, New York, May 14, 1823. He was the son of Abel and
Asenath [Smith] Wilder. Both parents were old American
stock, the Wilder ancestry going back to Thomas Wilder who
came from England to Massachusetts Bay in 1640, and, imbued
with the almost fanatical belief in the right of man to freedom,
both religious and civil, conveyed this idea and desire to his son.
Wilder was brought up on his father's farm, was educated
in the common school and himself became a country school
teacher at the boyhood age of f1fteen. That period between
about 1810 and 1850, may well be called THE AGE OF LIGHT.
Between these years, such men were born as Hitchcock, Ran-
dolph, Wilder, Lippard, Lincoln, Dowd and others in America,
while Europe had a counterpart in Levi and others, all of whom
were Immortalized in the thought of Liberty, Light and Im-
mortality for men. Before Wilder had reached the age of
twenty he had become acquainted with the Hermetic Initiate,
Ethan Allen Hitchcock, then Commandant of the Cadets at
West Point, and became thoroughly imbued in the Arcane. In
1846, when but twenty-three, he published his first treatise, a
pamphlet entitled The Secret Immortality Revealed, Mystical
in nature and showing the tendency of his nature. His progress
in the Arcane was rapid and he prepared himself for the work he
contemplated doing; a work to free men from the many forms
of slavery which permitted man little choice of action, even
as it concerned his own person. For a time Wilder supported
himself by farming, teaching and typesetting. During this
period he also taught himself Latin, Greek and Hebrew so well
that in later years he was recognized as a finished scholar in
these languages.

neo-Platonism in which in later years he was accepted as an
authority.
As an Initiate of the Arcane, a Light as from heaven—
possibly the same Light that descended upon Paracelsus—
came upon him, and pointed out to him that the person of
man, CREATED IN THE IMAGE OF GOD, BY GOD, was Holy and
Sacred and should not be either defiled or polluted; that the
practice in medicine of attempting to prevent or cure
diseases by means of injecting or transmitting vile animal
serums was wholly against the Divine Law and, man being
a free agent, should not only protest against it, but be will-
ing to give his life in defense of his person against such
pollution.
This was, of course, fully in harmony with the teachings of
all who had followed the Biblical injunction "to seek the king-
dom of heaven" and "become the Sons of God," free from all
evil. Though few had gone as far as Wilder in accepting this
dictate as an absolute Law to be obeyed though it meant
revilement and imprisonment.
In order to be free from such pollution and independent of
doctors in matters of health, he, under the guidance of a local
physician, took up the study of medicine and became so en-
grossed in it that he pursued it whole-heartedly and whole-
Soul-ed-ly, as he did all things in which he was interested, and,
having finished this study under proper guidance and instruc-

1850. After graduation, and in order to be more fully pre-
pared for the work he intended to do, he both studied and
lectured on Anatomy and Chemistry in that College.
While in Syracuse he became acquainted with young Ran-

In 1852 he became assistant editor of the Syracuse Star and
later was on the staff of the Syracuse Journal. In all of this
he was following a carefully outlined plan as will be seen later.
In 1854 he was appointed clerk in the newly created state
department of public instruction and for some time he edited
the College Review and the New York Teacher. In 1857 he
moved to New York City, where for thirteen years he held a
position on the editorial staff of the New York Evening Post.
All this time he was engaged in research in the Arcane on the
one hand, and practice of its teachings on the other, no other
Neophyte ever holding himself to as strict a regime as did this
man who believed in thorough preparation. In 1869 he pub-
lished New Platonism and Alchemy, a right-from-the-heart
biographical and expository study of the Neo-Platonists. He
was now recognized as an authority on the subject.
He now felt ready and sufficiently strong to engage in a
crusade he felt called upon by God. The Light had shown him
prior to 1848, that it was unholy to desecrate the body by the
use of animal products such as pus used in vaccination, he
started on his mission by founding the County Botanical Med-

State Eclectic Medical Society, a branch of the National
Eclectic Society formed to promote botanic [Nature's] medi-
cine. He founded and was president of the Eclectic Medical
College of New York from 1867 to 1877.
During the period between 1860 and 1878 he was engaged in
a bitter fight against compulsory vaccination, called by him
"animal pollution," evil if man accepted it of his own free will,
but unbearable when enforced. At times the fight waxed so
bitter that partisans of the practice waited for him when he
tried to leave his home and stoned him.1 Nevertheless, having

His reputation was such in finances (though not possessed of
money or property) and in political science, while on the Staff
of the Evening Post, that he was elected an Alderman of New
York in 1871 on an anti-Tweed ticket.
Despite the efforts of his most bitter enemies, Wilder suc-

the invasion of his sacred blood. He held high positions in the
field of education. For a long time he even held an appointment

Alexander Wilder was one of the most modest men that ever
lived; a man who effaced himself in his work; sought neither
glory nor position, unless it could help him in his work, and he
risked his own liberty and life that others might be free.
Wilder became a member of the Council of Seven under
Randolph, continued such under Dowd, and became a member

PAUL TYNER
Paul Tyner was born March 7, 1860, in the city of Cork,
Ireland. His mother was of an old family, the Sarfields, cele-
brated by Macaulay in his account of the conflict in Ireland
between the Stuart forces and those under William of Orange.
His father was the representative of a London publishing
house.
Tyner was brought to America at the age of four, educated
in the public schools of Albany, N. Y., afterwards taking Law
in the Columbia College, New York City, exchanging Law for
journalism at the age of twenty, at which time he joined the
staff of the New York World. In 1887, Tyner went to Central
America and engaged in mining. After a year in Honduras he
went to Costa Rica, where he published a daily paper, called
"El Comercio," an English-Spanish paper. After six months of
this, Tyner returned to New York and it was at this time that,
as a result of studying Dr. J. C. Street's Hidden Way Across
The Threshold he became interested in the Arcane.
In his desire to contact the Fraternity, he visited Boston
and sought out Dr. Street. Dr. Street was not an accredited
instructor, but was an accepted author. Dr. Street gave Tyner
an introduction to Dowd and he was enrolled, Sorona being
selected as his instructor and guide. Tyner was of a nature
readily able to concentrate on any one subject and by 1895
had attained to Philosophic Initiation, and a year later became
a member of the Council of Three.
Tyner became an enthusiastic worker in the field of the
Rosy Cross. His first work was The Living Christ, an Exposi-
tion of the Immortality of Man in Soul and Body. As a theme
for this work he took Raskin's Immortal words:
"The direct manifestation of Deity to Man is Deity's
own image in Man.... We are not made now in any other
image than God's. There are, indeed, the two states of this

Ireland. His mother was of an old family, the Sarfields, cele-
brated by Macaulay in his account of the conflict in Ireland
between the Stuart forces and those under William of Orange.
His father was the representative of a London publishing
house.
Tyner was brought to America at the age of four, educated
in the public schools of Albany, N. Y., afterwards taking Law
in the Columbia College, New York City, exchanging Law for
jow·nalism at the age of twenty, at which time he joined the
staff of the New York World. In 1887, Tyner went to Central
America and engaged in mining. After a year in Honduras he
went to Costa Rica, where he published a daily paper, called
·'EI Comercio," an English-Spanish paper. After six months of
this, Tyner returned to New York and it was at this time that,
as a result of studying Dr. J. C. Street's Hidden Way Across
The Threshold he became interested in the Arcane.
In his desire to contact the Fraternity, he visited Boston
and sought out Dr. Street. Dr. Street was not an accredited
instructor, but was an accepted author. Dr. Street gave Tyner
an introduction to Dowd and he was enrolled, Sorona being
selected as his instructor and guide. Tyner was of a nature
readily able to concentrate on any one subject and by 1895
had attained to Philosophic Initiation, and a year later became
a member of the Council of Three.
Tyner became an enthusiastic worker in the field of the
Rosy Cross. His first work was The Living Christ, an Exposi-
tion of the Immortality of Man in Soul and Body. As·a theme
for this work he took Ru.skin's Immortal words:
"The direct manifestation of Deity to Man is Deity's
own image in Man.... We are not made now in any other
image than God's. There are, indeed, the two states of this
212 ACTORS IN THE ARCANE DRAMA
image—the earthly and the heavenly, but both Adamite,
both human, both the same likeness; one defiled and one
pure. The Soul of man is a mirror, wherein may be seen,
darkly, the image of the mind of God. These may seem
daring words. I am sorry that they do; but I am helpless
to soften them. Discover any other meaning in the text, if
you are able. . . . The flesh-bound volume is the only
revelation that is, that was, or that can be. In that is the
image of God painted; in that is the Law of God written;
in that is the promise of God revealed. KNOW THYSELF;
for through thyself only canst thou know God."
His other work; Through the Invisible, a story of Initiation
through love, after the theme of Eulis, must be esotericatty
understood.
For a rime Tyner lived in Denver, Colorado. Here he pub-
lished THE TEMPLE, a magazine devoted to Higher Human
Culture and metaphysics. This was issued by the Temple
Publishing Company. In addition to teaching and writing, he
established and conducted the Church of the Risen Christ.
In later years Tyner resided in New York City and con-
ducted lectures. When he was sent on a mission to Europe, he
predicted that he would never return, but pass into the Un-
known unknown. He remained a member of the Council of
Three until the end of life.

EDWARD H. BROWN
Edward H. Brown, Attorney of note, graduate in medicine,
construction engineer, Supreme Grand Master of the
Temple of the Rosy Cross, Hierarch of
Eulis, an Inconnu of the same class as
Dr. Phelps, remained even more com-
pletely unknown than Dr. Phelps, a
member of his Council of Three known
as the Priesthood of Eulis.
Dr. Brown was born in Salem, Mass.,
July 17, 1868. He was educated in the
schools of Salem; the Vireun Military
Academy, Ossing, N. Y.; The Univer-
sity of New York; Law Department of Boston University. In
the Arcane, his sign was that of Equilibrium, which he mani-
fested throughout life. His profession was law, his hobby
machinery, to which he gave a great deal of his time. On the
one side, his nature was completely and thoroughly practical,
as when in the practice of Law, or the designing of an engine;
on the other side, he was spiritual-mystical, devoted to the
Arcane; Mystical, because he was given much to contemplation;
spiritual, because he desired to remain unknown, to live in the
Light behind the Shadow, and for this reason he himself ac-
cepted no Acolytes, but selected properly prepared and ac-
credited guides and teachers for them.
Dr. Brown was enrolled under Dowd, who placed him under
the care of Sorona. The selection was a wise one; Sorona not
only proved a patient instructor and guide, but also a mother in
spirit to him, and for this he showed his gratitude (a rare
quality in these modern days) by faithful study and practice
and a deep, undying affection for her until the end of her days.
Dowd early recognized Dr. Brown's innate ability and
spiritual quality and selected Dr. Brown to succeed him in
office upon his own death.

214 ACTORS IN THE ARCANE DRAMA
To the general public Dr. Brown was known only as a
practicing Attorney and the builder of engines. To the general
students of the Occult as head of the Eulian Publishing Com-
pany; to the very few, as Grand Master of the Temple of the
Rosy Cross and Hierarch of Eulis. This was as he wanted it
to be.
Dr. Brown wrote but one little treatise, this was titled THE
SIGN OF EQUILIBRIUM, and first published in 1917,1 just a few
years before he was called into the Beyond. Those few who
knew, quickly recognized in this an exoteric exposition of his
own final Initiation, and that the Sign of Equilibrium was the
signature of his Initiation.
On April 12, 1907, Dowd, wearied by his years and labors,
resigned his high position in favor of Dr. Brown, and on the
15th of the same month, Dr. Brown took his seat as Supreme
Grand Master, Temple of the Rosy Cross and Hierarch of
Imperial Eulis, positions he held until his departure from this
plane.
Dr. Brown, a true Rose Cross, passed into the realm of Light,
May n, 1922.

Davidson, member of the Council of
Seven and the Order of the Rose, was
born in Morayshire, Scotland, March
14, 1837.
By inclination and his early training
and Initiation he was a Druid of the highest order, having
been received by the Arch Druid personally and instructed in
all the mysteries of the old Druidic Initiation, into which only
a very few of the most select students were received.
Peter Davidson was well educated, reading both Latin and
Greek and an excellent translator of both languages. Until he
came to America, when fifty-nine years of age, he taught
school in Scotland.
While still a very young man he became acquainted with
the Priesthood of Druids, then still active in Scotland, though
known only to a select few. After passing the tests required
and being received by them into their secret Order, he was
given an introduction to the Brethren in England. While stay-
ing in London he made the acquaintance of the Brethren of
the Rosy Cross and was at once recognized as an Initiate of a
very high order and accepted by them into the Fraternity.

On coming to America he brought with him an Introduction
to the Rosy Cross, together with the authority as a member
of the Council of Seven from England. He settled in Louds-

with Supreme (Royal) Initiation, the exposition of the Druidic
philosophy and Initiation, and a monthly magazine called the

Among his publications were:
THE MISTLETOE AND ITS HISTORY. In this book is revealed

"In ancient times, as well as in the middle ages, all the sciences
were included under the generic term Philosophy. Thus the
Alchemists, Occultists and Hermetists were designated as
Philosophers [if Initiates, the Philosophic Initiates]. These
were really such, as, for instance, the Egyptian Initiate ad-
mitting that in all of his operations he practiced Transmutation
of bodies. Thus water heated in an open vessel transformed
itself into air [vapor], and whitish earth [at the end of the
operation], or a pulverulent matter, therefore the water was
changed into air and earth.
"The Alchemist burned in free air [calcination] lead, or
any other metal [gold or silver excepted], and this metal lost
its first qualities, being transformed into ashes, or a kind of
pulverulent earthy substance, designated in the middle ages as
dead metal. If the Alchemist heated anew this so-called dead
metal in a crucible, along with a few grains of wheat, farina,
several seeds of the plant Mirabilis Galapa, and a few other
seeds, he soon saw the metal reborn from its ashes. From this
result the Alchemist concluded that the metal, supposed to be
destroyed by the fire, was again restored to life (redivivus),
revivified by the seeds and action of the heat, by which the

fire, transmutation of evil, is necessary to free the Soul from

though not the only one, why in Egyptian Symbolism, fol-
lowed by the Jewish figurative cult, the seeds of wheat repre-
sent life by extension, life in the beyond, life in the Resurrec-
tion, or the eternity of life.
"In the depths of ancient and sober forests, the Druids [the
BOOK OF ROSICRUCLE 219
Initiated of the Druids] had their retreats and their principal
sanctuaries. They consecrated these to the Supreme, and gave
the name of God to that internal SELF of which they were
naturally [by Initiation] cognizant. They had only to retreat
within themselves to become conscious of God, or if their
Souls mingled with the Anima Mundi (Cosmic), or Soul of
the world, it was to be perfectly conscious of Divinity.
"In their ceremonies, they (the Druids) constructed a tri-
angular altar of wood around the trunk of a tree [the circle of
Eternity about, or as a result of finding the Altar in the midst
of the pyramid; i.e., the Triangle. Note Madathanas, Vol. 1.,
and his True Centre in the Centre of the Triangle]. Unity in
the Circle and Trinity in the Altar,2 from which the Oak
seemed to arise.8 A circular tablet was appended to the tree,
on which were written the mystic letters signifying God the
Father, Sovereign Light,* Principle of Life which He gives to
the world.
"This True Centre in the Centre of the Triangle of the Ini-
tiate Madathanas, the Greek Delta, .'. was typical of the same
symbolism, the name of the Boeotian Deity beginning with this
letter, as well as the Deus of the Latins, the Dieu of the French.
The Tetragrammaton is Isis or Nature [mother, or the
giver], and we find this name of four letters throughout many
nations, in the Egyptian, Teut; the Arabic, Alia; the Persian,
'Altar, triangle, pyramid; triad, trinity and duality in manifestation, all
have the same mean1ng. In them all must be found the True Centre in the
Centre of the Triangle before Initiation is an accomplished fact.
'Always there must be an ascending, a "going upwards." As smoke
arises from the flames of a fire, so must the sp1rit of man, finding the apex
of the triangle in the "centre," arise to meet the spirit of God, the "dove"
or the Holy Ghost.
4 The Sovereign Light is the Light of God and of the Soul of the Initiate
who has become a Brother of Light, a Son of God. This is the theme of
Initiation, and this Light, this Phoenix, cannot arise in a renewal of life,
unless there is transmutation; a burning up or consuming of the gross,
the carnal body.

BOOK OF ROSICRUCUE 219
Initiated of the Druids] had their retreats and their principal
sanctuaries. They consecrated these to the Supreme, and gave
the name of God to that internal SELF of which they were
naturally [by Initiation] cognizant. They had only to retreat
within tbemselves to become conscious of God, or if their
Souls mingled with the Anima Mundi (Cosmic), or Soul of
the world, it was to be perfectly conscious of Divinity.
"In their ceremonies, they (the Druids) constructed a tri-
angular altar of wood around the trunk of a tree [the circle of
Eternity about, or as a result of finding the Altar in the midst
of the pyramid; i.e., the Triangle. Note Madathanas, Vol. 1.,
and his True Centre in the Centre of the Triangle]. Unity in
the Circle and Trinity in the Altar,2
from which the Oak
seemed to arise.8
A circular tablet was appended to the tree,
on which were written the mystic letters signifying God the
Father, Sovereign Light;' Principle of Life which He gives to
the world.
"This True Centre in the Centre of the Triangle of the Ini-
tiate Madathanas, the Greek Delta, : . was typical of the same
symbolism, the name of the Breotian Deity beginning with this
letter, as well as the Deus of the Latins, the Dieu of the French.
The Tetragrammaton is Isis or Nature [mother, or the
giver], and we find this name of four letters throughout many
nations, in the Egyptian, Teut; the Arabic, Alla; the Persian,
•Altar, triangle, P)'I'lUl!id; triad, trinity and duality in manifestation, all
have the same meaning. In them all must be found the True Centre in the
Centre of the Triangle before Initiation is an accomplished fact.
•Always there must be an ascending, a "~oing upwards." As smoke
arises from the flames of a fire. so must the spirit of man, finding the apex
of the triangle in the "centre," arise to meet the spirit of God, the "dove"
or the Holy Ghost.
•The Sovereign Light is the Light of God and of the Soul of the Initiate
who has become a Brother of Light, a Son of God. This is the theme of
Initiation, and this Light, this Phoenix, cannot arise in a renewal of life,
unless there is transmutation; a burning up or consuming of the gross,
the carnal body.

from the TRUE CENTRE IN THE CENTRE OF THE TRIANGLE.
"There is a thrill of conscious exultation, unmistakable, and
utterly beyond any conception of the natural [carnal] man.
The first step towards gaining this vibration is silent medita-
tion alone with Nature; the mind and body in perfect repose,
the thoughts of self banished; musing, by the use of Mantra,
in silent revery on the Divine in Love. This may require only
days to those who have already demonstrated to their own
Souls the efficacy of silent prayer [devotion of Soul]; to others
it may take weeks or months, to some who are unable to stem
the turmoil within, a goodly number of years, much depending
on the life led by the individual.
"The important thing is to forget the [carnal] self, and to
long in calm silence for the revelation of the mystery. In deep
silence is the most potential prayer: 'Be still and know that I
am God,' is a hard lesson for nervous, impetuous, impatient
people to learn.

in different periods and times brings forth the fruitage of the

tion alone with Nature; the mind and body in perfect repose,
the thoughts of self banished; musing, by the use of Mantra,
in silent revery on the Divine in Love. This may require only
days to those who have already demonstrated to their own
Souls the efficacy of silent prayer (devotion of Soul]; to others
it may take weeks or months, to some who are unable to stem
the turmoil within, a goodly number of years, much depending
on the life led by the individual.
"The important thing is to forget the [carnal] self, and to
long in calm silence for the revelation of the mystery. In deep
silence is the most potential prayer: 'Be still and know that I
am God,' is a hard lesson for nervous, impetuous, impatient
people to learn.
"A knowing Indian once said, when asked what constituted
greatness in man: 'He is the Great Chief who speaks little and
does much.' To be born [reborn] of the Spirit requires of man
something much greater than boisterous noise, ecstatic howl-
ings and great pretensions. Philosophic Initiation is not attained
by gabbelism.
"Philosophic Initiation is attained by arousing the Divine
spark or SEED OF THE TREE OF LIFE within and bring it into
fruition.
"In the human Soul is planted a spiritual seed-germ, which
in different periods and times brings forth the fruitage of the
Tree of Life. The little acorn, planted in the bosom of mother
earth ' surrounded by darkness, swells and softens, and at
last bursts from its tiny shell, by the self-acting energy of that

who have read this have given it more than passing thought.
We have reference to the experiences of St. Paul, the Christian
Initiate of long ago. In referring to this, Davidson says:

Paul informs us: 'I knew a man in Christ. . . . Such an one
caught up to the third heaven... whether in the body or outside
of the body, I know not, God knoweth, who was wrapt in
Paradise and heard things ineffable, which it is not lawful for
a man to utter.'—II Corinthians 12:2, 3.
"This is the Beatific vision of an Initiate Seer; and Plato long
ago informed us that before an Initiate could see the Gods in
their purest Light, he had to become like Paul, liberated from
his body [by some means or another as by means of the Sleep
of Death]. The Soul is then placed in direct rapport with
the Divine, and man is enabled for the time being, to become,
as it were, a God upon earth.
"The earthly body can take no share in this solemn cere-
mony, it is beyond cognizance, a mere clod of earthly matter,
and wholly unfit to be the shrine wherein the Divine Presence
can dwell for a single moment. 'No man can see God and live.'

Dr. Odell became an Acolyte in the Fraternitas in 1923 and
made such progress in the Great Work that by 1931 he was
selected to become a member of the Council of Three to fill
the office left vacant by the passing of Paul Tyner.
During 1933 Dr. Odell prepared his thesis on Alchemy. This
was later read before the Chemical Society of which he was a
member. It was to have served as a synopsis of an exhaustive
work on the subject, and in itself indicates extensive research.
In 1936, Dr. Odell traveled through England, Germany,
France, Belgium and other European countries in the interests
of his company. It was also a mission to the numerous centers of
the Fraternitas, contacting the various Grand Masters and
members of the Councils in the countries he visited.

Two leaders of well defined scientific trend also appeared at

"Space does not permit going into a lengthy account of
Alchemy during the Reformation. It is one of the most
interesting and intense periods of its long history, marked by
the rise of numerous enigmatical and short-lived secret societies,
the most important of which, and the one destined to arouse
more attention than any organization before or since, has never
been cleared up to this date, i.e., 1938."
"This was in 1614. The history of Alchemy follows a triple
path from this time. It leads to the formation of the Royal
Society of London in 1647 by a group of honest inquirers, an-
other path leads to those schools of mysticism exemplified by
Jacob Boehme and his followers, while the third is safely hid-
den behind the shadows of the multitude of arcane organiza-
tions, so called Rosicrucians (in most cases probably unrelated
to the original order), Illuminati, etc.13
"Alchemy, as it has pretentions to the making of gold, may
thus be considered to have closed its fifteen hundred years of
existence with the beginning of the nineteenth century, al-
though sporadic instances of its practice were to continue even
up to the present time.14

the native religion and the growing Christianity alike.
"It has long been recognized that chemical practices or Al-
chemy, if one pleases to call it that, existed prior to this time,85
and Strunz has pointed out that such existed in the prehistoric
technology relating to bronze and gold-like alloys.36 Such prac-
tice may be considered the laboratory work carried out em-
pirically, similar to the 'cut and try' method still in use today in
unscientific enterprises. The importance of the empiric art must
have been considerable, commercially, so much so that it was
confined to the priestly caste by the ruler.87 Notwithstanding,
the practice received no study in the current schools. J.
Matter3S states that it is a fact that chemistry was neglected by
the savants of Alexandria before the Christian era, which is
the basis of his opinion that Alchemy as an established art had
its origin subsequent to that time. This will also explain the
absence of manuscripts dating back to the second or third
century A. D.
"The appearance of Alchemy is approximately coin-
cident with the act of Theodosius closing the native
temples and driving the priesthood into exile, the latter
including some of the most promising philosophers of the
schools of Alexandria. The philosophical and educational
institutions became battlegrounds upon which the poly-
theistic mysteries were to yield slowly to the ever en-
croaching dogmas of Christianity [of faith, instead of the
Gnose—to KNOW], the final outcome being foreshadowed

the teachings of the earlier, purer mysteries, and affected both
the native religion and the growing Christianity alike.
"It has long been recognized that chemical practices or Al-
chemy, if one pleases to call it that, existed prior to this time,111
and Strunz has pointed out that such existed in the prehistoric
technology relating to bronze and gold-like alloys.86
Such prac-
tice may be considered the laboratory work carried out em-
pirically, similar to the 'cut and try' method still in use today in
unscientific enterprises. The importance of the empiric art must
have been considerable, commercially, so much so that it was
confined to the priestly caste by the ruler.87
Notwithstanding,
the practice received no study in the current schools. J.
Matter aR states that it is a fact that chemistry was neglected by
the savants of Alexandria before the Christian era, which is
the basis of his opinion that Alchemy as an established art had
its origin subsequent to that time. This will also explain the
absence of manuscripts dating back to the second or third
century A. D.
"The appearance of Alchemy is approximately coin-
cident with the act of Theodosius closing the native
temples and driving the priesthood into exile, the latter
including some of the most promising philosophers of the
schools of Alexandria. The philosophical and educational
institutions became battlegrounds upon which the poly-
theistic mysteries were to yield slowly to the ever en-
croaching dogmas of Christianity [of faith, instead of the
Gnose-to KNOW], the final outcome being foreshadowed

toward the close of the Reformation, there were a number of
men who disavowed any experience with equipment and ap-
paratus, and who at the same time did not belong to the
polemical system currently in vogue, while professing complete
acquaintance with the art. This shows, presumably, that
Alchemy may be a purely mental practice. This would class
it as a mystic practice. This furnishes a possible connection
with the mysteries. To constitute a link of this nature, Alchemy
must furnish a system acceptable to pagan and Christian alike,
as did the mysteries, satisfying the conditions required by minds
raised in the shadow of the most diverse superstitions and
conventions.
"The complete solution of this complex problem can scarcely
be looked for in the Cosmic philosophies of Plato and Aristotle,
for there is seemingly nothing here to be considered of a secret
nature. Yet the connection of these philosophies in such an
intimate manner with the speech of the Alchemists clearly
points to the substance of the secret matter as pertaining to
the Cosmos and Being. This is not an unlooked-for conclusion,
to be sure, after all that has been said on this phase of the
subject, but it satisfies, both in breadth and simplicity, the
conditions required by a relation to the mysteries.
"The influence of Grecian philosophy and Alexandrian neo-
Platonism have often been brought forward as the deterrent
influence upon the more rapid and sensible development of
science, but if Alchemy is fundamentally not chemistry, these
elements should in reality become vantage points from which
to commence the search for a solution.
"To consider Alchemy as essentially mystic, places it in that
no man's land which lies between any two widely divergent
sciences, making it share, unfortunately, the position held, for
instance, by bio-chemistry, and which held back the develop-
ment of the latter for so long; for Alchemy should fall within
the province of experimental psychology. A division of fields
thus will probably long defer its proper study.

Fludd died in 1637 and immediately thereafter Backhouse
assumed his duty as Supreme Grand Master pro tern of the
Fraternity, as a member of the Council of Three and as
instructor and guide of the young Ashmole. In 1646 Ashmole
had succeeded in his own transmutation of the First Water and
the finding of the "Ens" to such a degree that he was inducted
as Supreme Grand Master of the Fraternitas Ros<e Crucis of
England, an office he filled with high honor.
Backhouse desired to be known as an Unknown, and he
was granted his wish in as far as possible. The record shows
that in 1644 Backhouse translated a work entitled The Pleasant
Fountain Knowledge by one John de Fountaine, anno 1413.
This is catalogued as Ashmolean MSS. No. 58. He also trans-
lated a French work called The Golden Fleece, or The Flower
of Treasure, by one Solomon Trismosin. This was catalogued
as No. 1395.
Backhouse wrote a treatise entitled The Way to Bliss, to
which was added a Preface by Ashmole. The book teaches the
way to bliss, i.e., peace of mind, as a result of freeing the
Conscience by good works. This is in truth the Alchemical
work of transmuting the carnal passions, base desires and
unclean thoughts into the kindly emotions such as love, kind-
ness, graciousness, forgiveness and gentleness. It is the spiritual
Alchemy of the Philosophic Initiates. The work clearly indi-

direct if known to him, or 1f not, through some one who did. This appli-
cation would receive the consideration of the Grand Master. If found
acceptable, the Grand Master would then appoint a Teacher-Guide for
the Neophyte and so inform him. From th1s time on, the teacher-guide
would instruct the Neophyte and the Neophyte would make all his reports
to his selected teacher. If, in time, the Neophyte succeeded in attaining to
the first degree, the Teacher-Guide would then gather together all of the
correspondence and notes, together with his own findings and recom-
mendations, and forward these to the Grand Master, who would then
follow the same routine as Judges of the Supreme Court do with the
records of a case in a lower Court. If the Grand Master agreed with the
findings of the Teacher-Guide, he would notify the Neophyte of his
admittance to the ROSY CROSS and urge him to continue his pursuit of the
Greater Mysteries. The Grand Master would then file all the material in
the Archives for any future examination and for record. After 1905 this
method changed somewhat in its method of procedure, though all records
are kept in the manner as before. In Europe, Central and South America
the former method is still generally followed except that now all such
records are kept in the Secret Archives in America.

"This day, being very ill and not certain of my recovery, I
called into my presence my Neophyte, Elias Ashmole, and
questioned him of his experiences. I was happy to know in
these which might be my last hours, that he had succeeded to
bring the Fire to such a degree of Light that the Soul had
gained its second degree of Consciousness. Being Baptized by
this Spiritual Fire known to men as the Holy Ghost from
above, I need have no fear of unveiling to him the whole of
the Arcane secret and the mystery of the ROSY CROSS.

spirit of the Brethren of Light, now is he my Son, for through
my efforts had he become reborn; he has passed the second
birth, that of the spirit IN THE LIGHT, May 13, 1652, in my
earthly home in Fleet Street, over against St. Dustan's Church."
Even so, this record is little less jargon to the uninitiated than
the statements made by Ashmole himself in his records concern-
ing this event, nevertheless, to the seeker it is an Arcanum of
the highest significance.
The misunderstanding so general among profane writers
when dealing with Arcane affairs is due to accepting the letter
and the lack of knowledge concerning Philosophic Initiation.
Thus Ashmole's own entry of the meeting which appeared to
be the last, given in the jargon of the Alchemist, when literally
accepted and lacking full information, is grossly misleading:
"1652, May 13. My father Backhouse lying sick in Fleet
Street, over against St. Dunstan's Church; and not knowing
whether he should live or die, about one of the clock, told me,
in Syllables, the true matter of the Philosopher's Stone, which
he bequeathed to me (as a son) as a legacy"

proceeds to explain in this manner: 'For when He was in the
form of God, He thought it not robbery to be equal with
God.' In order that we may be able to apply this to the
Chymical mystery, it is necessary that we explain a little more
clearly the meaning of the Chymical philosophers, by which

"We must conclude then, that Jesus is the corner-stone of

exalted; as in the time of Solomon, when his prayers [supplica-

him an equal capacity to be good or holy hence, those who are most vile

THOMAS VAUGHAN
THOMAS VAUGHAN was one of the most famous of the
Alchemists, Hermetists and Philosophic Initiates following
the formation of the Fraternitas Rosa
Cructs. For this reason it cannot be
considered Lese Majeste to maintain that
he should be given a seat between Dr.
Fludd of England and Maier of Ger-
many.
Vaughan was born in the year 1621-
23,1 his father being Henry Vaughan, of
Newton, Llansaintsffraid, a Magistrate.
At the age of eleven, Vaughan was
entered in the College of Jesus, Oxford,
and in 1638, at the age of sixteen, he
graduated with the Degree of Arts.
In 1640, or two years later, he was
ordained by a Dr. Mainwaring, then
Bishop of St. Davids, and presented to
the living of Llansaintsffraid by his kinsman, St. George
Vaughan of Wiltshire. He maintained this position until 1649
when he was relieved of his duties, many reasons being given,
none of which were true. The real reason was that in 1645 he
had become interested in Alchemical and Hermetic studies and
became so ardent that the knowledge of this activity became
public.
'The exact date is not given. This omission may have been delib-
erate, as little regard was held for such details. In many instances there
was practiced deliberate confusion because the brethren, while still
unknown—incognito, true Inconnu, for the protection of both, them-
selves and the Fraternity, always having in m1nd the fate of their earlier
brethren in the Arcane, i.e., The Templars. Like later members of the
Fraternitas, he himself made an open disavowal of his connection with
the Fraternity. He sought to remain a true Inconnu, one who labors
for his own advancement for the good of himself and humanity, in the
Light behind the Shadow.

considered Lese Majeste to maintain that
he should be given a seat between Dr.
Fludd of England and Maier of Ger-
many.
Vaughan was born in the year 1621-
23,1 his father being Henry Vaughan, of
Newton, Llansaintsffraid, a Magistrate.
At the age of eleven, Vaughan was
entered in the College of Jesus, Oxford,
and in 1638, at the age of sixteen, he
graduated with the Degree of Arts.

In 1640, or two years later, he was
ordained by a Dr. Mainwaring, then
Bishop of St. Davids, and presented to
the living of Llansaintsffraid by his kinsman, St. George
Vaughan of Wiltshire. He maintained this position until 1649
when he was relieved of his duties, many reasons being given,
none of which were true. The real reason was that in 1645 he
had become interested in Alchemical and Hermetic studies and
became so ardent that the knowledge of this activity became
public.
'The exact date is not given. This omission may have been delib·
erate, as little regard was held for such details. In many instances there
was practiced deliberate confusion because the brethren, while still
unknown-incognito, true lnconnu, for the protection of both, them-
selves and the Fraternity, always having in mmd the fate of their earlier
brethren in the Arcane, i.e., The Templars. Like later members of the
Fraternitas, he himself made an open disavowal of his connection with
the Fraternity. He sought to remain a true lnconnu, one who labors
for his own advancement for the good of himself and humanity, in the
Light behind tbe Shadow.
270 ACTORS IN THE ARCANE DRAMA
In 1651, Vaughan began the publication of tracts and con-
tinued this activity during the years 1652 and 1653. These are
of no special importance to us at this time. During this period,
Vaughan was also devoting his time to intensive study of
Alchemy and Hermeticism, following the routine of Arcane
activity prescribed for him by his instructor and guide. In 1654,
Vaughan undertook a mission to America to consult with
members of the Council of Three and the Great, or World
Council.
This was the beginning of actual activity in the new world
in confirmation of the prophecy of Isaiah that America should
become the home of the free. On his return to England, he
published his work Euphrates, which bears the date of 1655.
After the publication of Euphrates, Vaughan, as a member
of the Great, or World Council, visited the seat (See) of the
Supreme Grand Dome in Germany, thence to Holland where
he consulted with John Frederick Helvetius, another member
of the Great, or World Council, and from there proceeded to
the seat (See) of the Supreme Grand Dome of France, where
he was admitted as a member of L'Ordre du Lis for services
rendered the Fraternitas. On his return to England, his services
were also recognized by being made a member of the Order
of the Rose.
Like many of the old members of the pre-Fraternitas period,
such as the Hermetists, Alchemists, Paracelsians, Magi and
Initiate Platonists, especially those who did not possess Direc-
tive, administrative or authoritative power, Vaughan sought
to be known only by his Initiate name, as conferred upon him
by the Spiritual Hierarchy after having attained a definite
degree of inner development. This explains why he signed his
books Eugenius Philalethes, and as such he was known when he
visited America, as such also he was recognized by a later and
one of the world's greatest Philosophic Alchemists, General
Hitchcock.

In 1667, his work Introitus Apertus ad Occlusum Regis

confusion among the profane, then and since. This work was

down by Madathanas:
The true Centre in the Centre of the Triangle.
"The key to the whole mystery is that to which God
is in the heart of Man" and this "God" in the heart of
man, is first of all Love, for Love is the Law, and in affec-
tion, kindliness, friendliness, generosity, and the other spir-
itual emotions which, when the heart is filled with them,
turn man into a God.
The concepts of Vaughan are second to none of the
Great Initiates. Every statement made by him is proof that
he had attained to supreme Initiation. General Hitchcock
recognized him as such, and he designated him as one of
the greatest of Philosophic Initiates. To do justice to him
would necessitate the sympathetic interpretation of all of his
writings into many volumes.
Like many others who attained to beyond the second
step upon the calvary on which the Cross with the crucified
Rose rests, Vaughan and the life of Vaughan was a baffling
mystery, and failing to understand him, those who came in
contact with him formed their own conclusions which, to
say the least, were not in his favor; even thus it is today in
a far more enlightened and liberal age. This is the penalty
men must willingly pay while on the path to spiritual attain-

wherein I found them to be true philosophers, and there-
fore not chimaeras, as most think, but men.
"Their principles in every way correspond to the an-
cient and primitive wisdom—nay, they are consonant to
our very religion, and confirm every point thereon. . . .
It will be expected, perhaps, that I should say something
about their persons and habitations, but in this my cold
acquaintance will excuse me, or, had I any familiarity
with them, I should no doubt use it with more discretion.
"As for their existence (if I may speak like a school-
man), there is great reason we should believe; neither do
I see how we can deny it, unless we grant that Nature
is studied, and books also written and published, by some
other creatures than men.
"It is true, indeed that their knowledge at first was
not purchased by their own disquisitions, for they re-
ceived it from the Arabians [the Alchemists], amongst
whom it remained as the monument and Legacy of the
children of the East. Nor is this at all improbable, for the
eastern countries have always been famous for magical
and secret societies."
Thomas Vaughan was born just five years before the
English Alchemist and Chemist, Robert Boyle. They were
close friends and both were members of the Council of Three.
This was by no means Vaughan's first work. Among prior
works were:
Anthroposophia Theo Magica; or a Discourse of the Na-
ture of Man and his State after Death. 8 Vo. 1649.

quaintance. I know they are masters of great Mysteries,
and I know withal that nature is so large they may as well
receive as give. I was never so lavish an admirer of them
as to prefer them to all the world ... the acknowledge-
ment I give them was first procured from their books,
wherein I found them to be true philosophers, and there-
fore not chimreras, as most think, but men.

278 ACTORS IN THE ARCANE DRAMA
Anima Magica Abscondita, or a Discourse of the Universal
Spirit of Nature. London, 8 Vo. 1650.
In this work Vaughan shows that the Rosy Cross is not
a pagan but a Christian Society; that the Acolyte accepting
the tenets of the Fraternity must follow the path which will
ultimately Christianize his life; that is, arouse within himself
the Christic or Cosmic spirit and bring it into Consciousness
and manifestation.
HE WHO ACCEPTS THE SPIRIT MUST ULTIMATELY MANIFEST
THE SPIRIT. The WORK is to Find the Christ within.
Magica Adamica, or the Antiquities of Magic, and the
descent thereof from Adam downward proved. To this is
added: A Perfect and Full Discovery of the Ccelum Terr<e.
London, 8 Vo. 1650.
Ccelum Terr<e: The Magician's Heavenly Chaos, Unfold-
ing a Doctrine Concerning the Terrestrial Heaven.
Lumen de Lumine: A New Magical Light discovered and
communicated to the World, with the "Aphorisimi Magici
Eugenianii, London, 8 Vo. 1651.
Aula Lucis: The House of Light. London, 1652.
This House of Light is the same as the Spiritus Sancti of
the Rosicrucians mentioned in the first Fama of the Frater-
nity of the Rosy Cross; i.e., Fraternitas Ros<e Crucis.
Euphrates: The Waters of the East. Being a short dis-
course of that great fountain whose water flows from Fire,
and carries in it the beams of the Sun and Moon. London,
8 Vo. 1655.
This book, like Aula Lucis, has for its entire theme the
Light which is hidden in the Soul of man; must be brought
into manifestation by a personal effort in obedience to an
inner urge and then located, as stated by Madathanas:
AT THE TRUE CENTRE IN THE CENTRE OF THE TRIANGLE.
This is the Great Work.
