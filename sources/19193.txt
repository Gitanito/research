the leader line they called that points
toward the target itself this is what
his altitude and the altitudes that
normal year written down in hundredths
and see that little little dot rated
that thought don&#39;t belong there that&#39;s
the unknown is that dot that&#39;s in front
of that slash he doesn&#39;t belong there
I&#39;m one of those which you would call
the high government official in the FAA
I was a division chief it was only three
or four down from the Admiral I became
the branch chief for the quality control
the quality control branch later on
became a division and I became a
division chief and they called it the
accidents investigations branch and
Washington DC we were we investigated
all the airline incidences all the
accidents I stayed after about six years
and then retired the the way it started
is the there was a 747 at Japanese
airline 747 was coming from the
Northwest going across the Alaskan
territory and he was that either 31 33
or 35,000 feet and it was a I want to
say around 11 o&#39;clock at night but you
can check the real times he called and
asked the controller if the controller
had any traffic at his altitude and the
controller said no basically is a mid
night operation they didn&#39;t have too
much traffic and he said well something
like I have a target at my 11 o&#39;clock
one o&#39;clock position about eight miles
now in the 747 they have radar in the
nose that picks up the weather outside
there so his radar is picking up a
target he sees this target with his with
his eye and the target the way he
described it was a huge ball with the
lights running around it and I think he
said it was like four times as big as a
747 well on today I&#39;m doing PE eyes I
got behind and I told the year secretary
not to bother me I&#39;m doing POS
a few minutes later the phone&#39;s ringing
and then she wouldn&#39;t stop calling so I
asked what was going on she said you got
to talk to the people I&#39;ll ask oh so I
said all right so I&#39;m going I got who it
was it called but he says we got a
problem here I don&#39;t know what to tell
the media the whole office is full of
the media from Alaska what&#39;s the problem
he says well it&#39;s that UFO I said what
UFO he says well we last week we had a
UFO
chase of 747 across the skies up here
for about 30 minutes or so
and we didn&#39;t think too much of it he
says but apparently the word got out we
have all these news people here we want
to know what to tell them so being an
old government employee I told what you
always tell them is dumb it&#39;s under
investigation and then get all that data
together I wanted all the discs that
they had and all the tape the tapes of
they had available and flown overnight
to the Tech Center at wank setting but
they call the military and they told the
military they wanted all their tapes we
also control the FAA controls all the
airspace above the United States hands
territory doesn&#39;t belong to the military
doesn&#39;t belong to the to the guy
shooting the Rockets off it belongs to
the United States government and it&#39;s
controlled by the FAA nobody moves in
his air space unless we give the
approval so I told him to get the
military&#39;s tapes in all their data and
ship that down well they called back an
hour or so later and they said the
military said they were short on the
tapes and they had to put them back in
service and it&#39;s only been 12 days so
the administrators sent my boss was the
associate director javi Sofia sounds
like safer but it&#39;s Sofia send him and
me to Atlantic City to look at this
thing to see if he had something to
worry about so we wouldn&#39;t Olmec we won
this room set up to be just like it was
in Anchorage and we wanted all that data
to come to this scope and we wanted to
see everything to control the same you
wonder he
everything he heard and we wanted that
all tied together the radar the digital
radar and the sound found out later that
some of the people that were working on
that side of the fence that were
displaying this had already reviewed the
tapes and didn&#39;t feel comfortable in
showing us what was on there but they
ran it through when the air traffic
controller had asked the military man do
you see anything the military guy says
yes I have a target at such inside one
o&#39;clock and eight miles from the
Japanese pilot 747 the military man said
something like yeah I see him 35 miles
north of Anchorage and who&#39;s that at
11:00 or 1:00 o&#39;clock and his position
and FAA controller said I don&#39;t have
anybody do you have any buddies it&#39;s not
mine
and he came back and said we have no
traffic here and a couple times during
the operation the Japanese pilot would
say he&#39;s now 11 o&#39;clock he&#39;s not one
o&#39;clock he&#39;s now at 3 o&#39;clock he was
bouncing around this guy year and when
he would say that the military guy would
cut in and say he&#39;s now at 2 o&#39;clock or
three o&#39;clock and he would confirm the
position the military controller has
what they call height finding radar and
they have long-range radar and
short-range radar so if they don&#39;t catch
it on one of their systems they catch it
on the other and if you listen to the
military man and one time he said I have
it on the hight radar on my range radar
he whatever he called it which indicated
that he had a target on his system eyes
wouldn&#39;t record it while they grant
through for the best part of 31 minutes
the UFO would be in one position of the
other following our Japanese 747 after a
while they changed his Alba - it still
stayed with them they gave him a 360
when you know 747 you make a 360 it
takes you a few minutes to turn around
you cover a lot of space it still stayed
with them is either in the front and the
side or by nonzero I approved 1628 to
make deviations as necessary for traffic
the traffic stayed with six
in 28 through turns in the sense in the
vicinity of Fairbanks
I requested 1620 Omega right 3 SEC&#39;s
they would see that the target be at 1
o&#39;clock and 7 or 8 miles and the next it
would be in the next sweep which would
be like 10 seconds later it would be
behind him 7 or 8 miles that always
stayed 7 or 8 miles away from the target
when it was all done and we went back to
Washington next day the administrator
had called on and want to know if he had
a problem or not and my boss had told
him while we took a video of it and it
looks like there might have been
something there well his thing was can
you come up and give us a quick 5-minute
rundown what happened we go up to the
10th floor and in the conversation of a
for 5 minute debriefing the
administrator which was ingen at the
time had rolling it he said well we got
that video with you can you show me the
video and I said Johnny just plug it in
and play it so we plugged it in floor he
started watching it and after about five
minutes he told the staff a cancer my
year we had a meeting with someone in 15
minutes uses first he said I&#39;ll be late
and then next it was a cancel and then
I&#39;m going to be here to listen over so
he watched the whole thing just over
half an hour when they could all be
administrator the administrator the
affair we get all done he says what do
you guys think
well my yeah I guess that&#39;s why he was
the service director and I wasn&#39;t he
gave a good political answer that said
he he wasn&#39;t sure what it was didn&#39;t
know was anything so his take was don&#39;t
talk to anybody don&#39;t talk to anybody
until I give you the okay the next day I
got a call from someone with the
scientific study group or the UCI a much
of who was the first time and they
wanted to know they had some questions
about the the incident and I had said I
don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about you
probably want to call the Admiral a few
minutes later the Admiral calls down
says I set up a briefing tomorrow
morning at nine at ten o&#39;clock love
words in the Ron room bring all the
stuff you have and bring everybody up
there and give them whatever they want
and we want to get out of it just let
them do whatever they want to do with it
so I brought all the people from the
Tech Center we went upstairs we had all
kinds of boxes of data that we had him
print out filled up the room they
brought in three people from the FBI
three people from the CIA and three
people from Reagan&#39;s scientific study
team and I don&#39;t know who the rest of
the people were but they were all
excited we gave them the via the video
let him watch the video then I had the
they had all kinds of questions about
the frequencies the the rate of the
antenna turning on and on and on how
many how many radios how many antennas I
was a data get processed they were all
excited only way a man would be if that
was his job when they got done they
actually swore all these other guys into
this never took place we never had this
meeting and this was never recorded now
when I try to tell you before and I&#39;m
this was one of the guys from the CIA
okay that they were never there this
never happened when I asked them at the
time I don&#39;t know why you&#39;re saying this
I mean it&#39;s if there was something there
and if it&#39;s not the the stealth bomber
then you know so UFO and if it&#39;s UFO why
wouldn&#39;t you want to of the people no oh
they go outside over that you&#39;d only
want to say those words he said it&#39;s the
first time they ever had 30 minutes of
radar data on a UFO and they&#39;re all
itching to get the hands into the data
and to find out what it is and what
really goes and if they come out and
told the American public that they ran
into a UFO out there it would cause
panic across the country so if we can&#39;t
talk about it and they&#39;re taking all
this data so I said okay take all that
data that&#39;s what you want put your
target data the well that group
who went to but that group took it but
they took only what we had there they
didn&#39;t ask me if there was anything else
that I had they said too taken all this
data and I said fine now I had the
original video that I took and I had the
pilots a report that came through the
first report and I had the FA A&#39;s first
report that was all downstairs and my my
table they didn&#39;t ask that so I didn&#39;t
give it to him and later on when I
retired that was the stuff that was in
my office and all that came came with me
and we&#39;ve been sitting on that ever
since so he watched the whole thing what
happened at the end is is the Japanese
747 is leaving the airspace there&#39;s a
United coming up to land in Alaska the
controller says to United we&#39;ve got a
Japanese 747 up here that he&#39;s been is
being chased followed by a UFO we like
you to check them out can we leave you
at the altitude in the united says is
fine or sure so they give him a left
turn 20 degrees or so keep me at his
altitude and they kind of run them in
toward the Japanese 747 once the two
airplanes pass that target follows the
United down through the airspace and
until he gets on final and then
disappears and they read the reports
that can throw the FAA has to protect
themselves so you can&#39;t say you saw a
target even though this is what he said
so they made them change his report to
position symbols which makes it sound
like it wasn&#39;t really a target well if
it&#39;s not a target than a lot of the
other position symbols that were
separating from on targets either and
when I read that I thought out of
something fishy here that somebody&#39;s
worried about something rather than to
trying to cover up
when the CIA told us that this never
happened and we never had this meeting I
believe it was because they didn&#39;t want
the public to know that this was going
on normally we would we would put out
some type of a news release that such
and such happened that I think it was a
mysterious that the military tapes
disappeared it wasn&#39;t right
we went from 30 days to 15 days and the
first indication makes it look like it
must have been a military operation that
they were doing up there or the military
knew more than we did about who the
visitors were and they didn&#39;t want
anybody else to know and of course the
people that are involved at the lower
levels don&#39;t really know what&#39;s going on
above them when someone calls up and
says put those tapes back and service
they just put them back in service they
really don&#39;t care when they asked me
what I thought I told them that it
looked like we had a UFO that was up
there the reason it wasn&#39;t on the faz
types was because it was too larger of
an aircraft and it was picked up as
weather so we wouldn&#39;t record it that
the pilot the Japanese pilots seen it
the Japanese pilot drew pictures of it
eventually they gave the Japanese pilot
a hard time because of what he said he
was embarrassing his country military
controllers said they&#39;d seen it
our FAA controllers said they&#39;d seen it
our FAA controllers after a period of
time came back and said they really
didn&#39;t see a target they saw something
else which makes it sound like somebody
is helping them fill out the reports and
therefore that looked suspicious during
a period of 2030 I was on duty and I was
working the d50 I&#39;m making the statement
to clarify certain points in my original
statement on November 19th this was
January 2/6 my guess is because the way
it was it&#39;s not part of the military&#39;s
operation anymore that it was a UFO but
who do you tell that you were involved
in a UFO incident without them looking
at you like you ain&#39;t wrapped too tight
and this is I think is
the way our country is set up now if
someone comes out and says I saw a UFO
and TV the only ones that see a UFO when
the TV programs are the rednecks out in
the country that that are going
huntin or alligator at night you don&#39;t
find anybody with any kind of spots or
some professional individuals saying hey
last night let me clear what I saw they
don&#39;t display that United States so if
you talk about seeing a UFO you&#39;re
putting yourself in a funny kind of a
category that&#39;s probably one reason why
you don&#39;t hear about it anymore
as far as I&#39;m concerned I saw a UFO
chase a Japanese 747 across the sky for
over half an hour on radar and see all
these little these little hits they&#39;re
something that they have to explain all
the time if you can go within a year it
was a 10-second radar so at one o&#39;clock
in 7 miles you see him and then 10
seconds later or even 19:10 seconds
later it&#39;s less than 10 seconds because
when the system got southwest of the the
sweep could southwest of the Japanese
747 that picked him up again so it would
go from 1 o&#39;clock seven or eight miles
to six seven o&#39;clock seven or eight
miles inside of four or five seconds you
have to be moving pretty quickly and
it&#39;s fascinating that I know of in the
year in our government 236 50
I&#39;ve been involved in a lot of cover-ups
with the FAA when we gave the
presentation to the Reagan staff I was
behind the group that was there and when
they were speaking to the people in the
room they had all those people swear
that this never happened it always
bothered me that we have these things
going on and when you see something or
you hear something on the radio over TV
the news that it&#39;s put down as it&#39;s not
there I have a hard time saying nothing
because it&#39;s not there when I first told
the those that I knew about this it just
died me nothing nothing ever happens so
you look at it kind of funny like in it
it still bothers me that that I&#39;ve seen
all this I know all this and like I&#39;m
walking around like what the answer and
nobody wants to ask the question to get
the answer and it kind of irritates me a
little bit and I don&#39;t believe our
government should be give set up that
way I think when we have something like
this that you could probably find out
more about what&#39;s going on in the world
if they can travel that far that
distance with that type of machinery who
knows what they could do here for the
health of the nation of the people the
food they could give them cancers we
could cure they have to know more than
us to be able to travel that&#39;s be I sure
would like to know what&#39;s going on and
that&#39;s one reason why I&#39;m not afraid to
talk about what&#39;s happening what I can
tell you is what I seen with my own eyes
and I said I&#39;ve got a videotape I&#39;ve got
the law I get the voice tape I&#39;ve got
the reports that were filed that will
confirm what I&#39;ve been telling you those
people that say that if these UFOs
existed then someday would be on radar
and that to be professionals would see
it and I can tell them that in back in
1986 there were enough professional
people that saw her it was brought down
to headquarters FAA headquarters
Washington DC the administrators seen
the
the tape of it the people that we were
debriefing they&#39;ve all seen Reagan&#39;s
scientific study team the three of those
professors or doctors
they&#39;ve seen it as far as I was
concerned they they were the ones that
verified my own thoughts about it they
were very very excited about the data
they had said at that time this was the
was the only time and they had used the
words the UFO was ever recorded on radar
for any length of the time where it&#39;s
30-some minutes and they have all this
data to look at now or 30-minute their
radar return
filled up boxes across the thing and the
boxes were stacked the no two three I
was a lot of a paper day to look at they
knew the frequency now of the radar they
knew how fast a turn they knew where it
was they had the military that confirmed
it and when I gave my god the CIA guy
said you know we&#39;re with the company
they don&#39;t say CIA and the company we
don&#39;t have cards we don&#39;t have company
cards they may have a card but it&#39;s
nothing to do with the company and he
said that there&#39;s there&#39;s nothing we can
give out I&#39;m sure on the Admirals
calendar they have who reserved that or
they should have who reserved the room
and it was there for the day of the
briefing even the Admiral had to talk
about it wherever he went because he
canceled too many meetings to watch this
thing here and it was late at night when
we get back we go back to the 4:30
quarter of 5:00 and you know they well
cancel his meetings and to me that meant
that that he thought it was something to
say we had a government investigator
come by checking just a few weeks ago
checking on a an individual that we know
for his security clearance with the CIA
and she&#39;s with the CIA checking on him
to make sure he&#39;s okay guy and during
this period of time I had said well I&#39;ve
been involved the CIA one other
time and oh what was that so I started
giving to this UFO thing you could see
through her look like she&#39;s in the room
with to coax it open like can I get out
of here safe it&#39;s the only thing you can
see on their face and it was panic and
I&#39;m thinking about that&#39;s the rate of
the world&#39;s but I think that&#39;s the way
the government wants the outside people
to view those that have seen something
like this like they are kook&#39;s they&#39;re
not wrapped too tight and you got to
watch out for them that&#39;s the image that
they put out I guess I really don&#39;t care
about the image but I do feel like they
had something and that we seen it
you
you
