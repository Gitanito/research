  Life Review Description:      Description of life review


    This page contains over 150 near-death experiences (NDEs) that describe a life review.  This is a sampling, and not intended to be a comprehensive listing of all life reviews posted on NDERF.

      Methodology: 

      Experiences were scored as near-death experiencesif they met all of the following:

  1.  A lucid, organized experience occurring at the time of a life-threatening event so severe that there is unconsciousness or clinically apparent death with an absent heartbeat.

  2.  An NDE Scale score of 7 or higher.

  3.  Shared by the individual who personally had the NDE.

  4.  Shared in English via the completed survey form on nderf.org.

  These are NDEs from the most recent version of the NDERF survey (nderf.org). They are sequentially shared NDEs from November 11, 2011 to April 8, 2021. All accounts were scored as NDEs if they met the above criteria and regardless of experience content to avoid bias in studying the content of the NDEs.

    The NDEs posted on the NDERF website are edited to correct obvious spelling and grammar errors. As remarkable as the NDEs are in this list, please remember that they accurately represent the real experiences of near-death experiencers (NDErs) from all walks of life and around the world.  

  We strive to make a collection of life reviews in NDEs available to the world with as comprehensive a collection of such NDEs as possible. We would be delighted to collaborate in this endeavor with anyone with other credible internet sources of life reviews in NDEs.

      This list is public domain and may be used by anyone.

  Substantial efforts are made to minimize the risk of posting fraudulent NDE accounts on nderf.org: See a more detailed explanation. 

  We strive for accuracy in this list. If any NDEs should not be included for any reason, please email us at nderf@nderf.org with the NDE registry number and URL. Thanks!

    This is a compilation of responses to the NDERF survey question, “Did you become aware of past events in your life during your experience?” This was followed by a box for a narrative response asking “If yes or uncertain, describe in detail.  Also, if you later verified that any of the past events in your life that you became aware of during your experience really did not happen or were not real, describe in detail.” The ‘Life Review Description’ column below is the data from the NDERF survey without changing any spelling or grammar errors. Even a quick review of the NDEs below should demonstrate that life reviews in NDEs are common and often include an unearthly acceleration of consciousness.  It is also notable that what is seen in life reviews are virtually always real prior life events, even if they had been forgotten.

Not a &quot;life review&quot;, more of an explaination of why all truely was well and I was perfect for what I was needed for here...  		  		  			6118  			Ana R NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1ana_r_nde_6118.html  			All events were real as they were part of my life review.  		  		  			6125  			Sandy D NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1sandy_d_nde.html  			no all were real  		  		  			6139  			Kirat A NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1kirat_a_nde.html  			I surely did experience past events of my life but they were just passing by in quick succession. I just had a feeling of knowing them all but can't actually remember them.  		  		  			6150  			Karen J NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1karen_j_nde.html  			I just instantly experienced everything I've ever done or felt in my life. It wasn't a movie or a long list, just a feeling that my whole life &quot;flashed before my eyes.&quot; Instantly having everything in my life right there. Not any specific incident or experience... so nothing that didn't really happen.  		  		  			6166  			Jean R NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1jean_r_nde_6166.html  			It was in the life review...but all from the perspective of the other people in my relationships and how they felt towards me during certain events or times  		  		  			6178  			Ellen K NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1ellen_k_nde.html  			i watched a flash movie of my whole life from birth to death.  		  		  			6205  			Isabel R NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1isabel_r_nde.html  			I had forgotten that part. Before I entered the tunnel, I had the life review, but it really wasn't a review. I just reexperienced being four, ten, seven, thirteen, it all went very fast. It was just after that I heard the flute music and realized that I was creating it somehow.  		  		  			6242  			Frances Z NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1frances_z_nde.html  			I was made aware of the people that I hurt with no remorse.  		  		  			6244  			Steve L NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1steve_l_nde.html  			I became aware of the many lives that I had touched with my love, help, a smile, a generous gesture....  		  		  			6246  			Natalie S NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1natalie_s_nde.html  			I retreated to a deep place that I’ll refer to as another vibrational dimension, for lack of a better description, where I could recuperate and restore my energies. Other beings assisted with this, doing most of the work while I entered a sort of spiritual deep resting state. From the physical perspective, this state lasted an equivalent of centuries within less than a moment. During this state, I leisurely wandered through memories of this physical life to date, evaluating things I'd created (criteria: was it fun, was it unusual), noticing connections and links, and generally just wandering down memory lane.  		  		  			6267  			Sheila EP NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1sheila_ep_nde.html  			During the life review. Nothing that I had ever done was judged or minimized. I did not retain full memory of the life review.  		  		  			6289  			Evan B NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1evan_b_nde.html  			Memory of life became compressed to a milli-second.  		  		  			6313  			Frank S NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1frank_s_nde.html  			My whole life up to then was replayed back me all in colour it was amazing  		  		  			6317  			Morgan O NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1morgan_o_nde.html  			My whole life went before my eyes in less than a second, or so it appeared.  		  		  			6336  			Bret B NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1bret_b_nde.html  			My brother and sister as toddlers, little league baseball and winning the championship three out of five years, thanksgiving at my grandparents home, my first french kiss with an older beautiful girl (seriously she was 17 I was 14 and thought along with my friends that she was truly beautiful) riding my dirt bike in the forest, Elton John's music and how much my first love and I loved it, sex with some very special people, my career and my son being born. His mother absolutely glowed and we were so happy then. No bad memories or thoughts, water and snow skiing were special experiences  		  		  			6339  			Odell H NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1odell_h_nde.html  			A giant screen appeared next to us. It was so gigantic that I can naturally compare it to the large screens that used to be in the old drive-in theaters of the 40s, 50s, 60s, and early 70s. On this screen, in random order, different scenes of incidents that had happened in my life, while here on earth, were being played out. Jesus would select one scene, and it would expand to the point that it encompassed almost the whole screen. I could still see other scenes playing in the background around the edges of the main scene that we were reviewing. The scene we were reviewing was a most accurate depiction of an incident that I was involved in at that point in my life, and He questioned me as to why I did the things that I had done.  		  		  			6379  			Mike R NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1mike_r_nde_6379.html  			Like my kids being born again and also like my childhood the fun times I had  		  		  			6396  			Cristael B NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1cristael_b_nde.html  			I became aware of my mother's grief over not being able to have more children. I was an only child. I was aware of how much my grandmother loved me. She enjoyed teaching me how to sew and paint with oils.  		  		  			6409  			Sreenivasa M NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1sreenivasa_m_nde.html  			I have recollected my family and goals of life irrespective of incident form  		  		  			6427  			Sue M NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1sue_m_nde.html  			I can,t give details now Its been to long I just remember stuff that had happene with my sisters or relatives and school events  		  		  			6428  			Chantal L NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1chantal_l_nde.html  			When in the state of total recall, I remembered everything about the life of Chantal (me)but I also became aware that I was not really Chantal. It was like a role I had played.  		  		  			6436  			HD NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1hd_nde.html  			I saw all the bad things that i have done in life like drinking, smoking, talking back to my mom, even not doing my homework.  		  		  			6492  			R.A. NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1ra_nde.html  			A rapid re-experiencing of my life prior to entering the light.  		  		  			6496  			Carol M NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1carol_m_nde_6496.html  			It was a complete life review of everything I had done in my lifetime. And it all happened simultaneously, like a panoramic view.  		  		  			6497  			Bon A NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1bon_a_nde.html  			When I was living THAT life, I was aware of my entire past of THAT life... just like now I'm aware of my past in this life.  		  		  			6503  			Roland B NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1roland_b_nde.html  			Yes I had my life reeled off very quickly as on a movie reel yet I recognized  		  		  			6546  			Josef P NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1josef_p_nde.html  			I think I saw whole my past life. Events which was forgotten long time ago were revived. Childhood etc.  		  		  			6549  			Tamara J NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1tamara_j_nde.html  			I had thoughts of my life and my failures and shame. I was told it was all unimportant I was not going to be condemned. I was to live bravely knowing that God was taking care of me always and I was shown events in my life where He saved me and protected me. I was shown how I worry and that it's all for nothing. I can't change and don't need to change anything in my life.  		  		  			6557  			Barry C NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1barry_c_nde_6557.html  			I seemed to be aware of my whole life but I don't remember any specifics. It was more like if I felt the feeling of betrayal, then all the things that had that emotion came up.  		  		  			6612  			Yves F NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1yves_f_nde.html  			I felt all the good and bad feelings I had and created in everyone I had ever come into contact with during my life up to my heart attack.  		  		  			6615  			Sheryl NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1sheryl_nde.html  			No just that my past wasn't on the path, the beings and I discussed and I have vague memories of running over past events but it was more of an understanding and we agreed I would go back and we also agreed I would have the accident and I would not be badly hurt. It was a wake up call. I ordered the accident because I wanted to shake my life loose from my surroundings.  		  		  			6639  			Corey L NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1corey_l_nde.html  			I saw things that I had done in my life - I remember seeing my best friend Natalie and I playing and I was playing with my friend Alex. I saw images of my life and things I had done.  		  		  			6660  			Jeffery O NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1jeffery_o_nde.html  			I 'knew' my whole life, every event both good and bad, yet standing in the presence of divinity I saw the pure love in all of it. There was NO judgement, only the 'knowing; that it was all perfect. That my entire life was created in love FOR me. Even my choices, good or bad, had served my highest good in every way. For I was only here to learn and God, along with me, had provided the perfect path for my souls progression.  		  		  			6667  			Gary NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1gary_nde.html  			I thought about past events there, but it didn't seem as if they were forced on me.  		  		  			6692  			Samantha H NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1samantha_h_nde.html  			My past events, my whole life was there for me to witness, much like a movie film of pictures filling up in front of me with a solid background. I could not sense anything else but these pictures. I wouldn't call this &quot;my life flashing before me&quot; because it was still and entirely present. The feeling of knowing and experiencing each emotion ALL AT ONE TIME, not one after the other, was the incredible part to me.  		  		  			6694  			Kathy K NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1kathy_k_nde_6694.html  			I had a complete review of all that I had ever done as if I was watching myself reliving my life over again. All that I saw were actually the real life events I had ever experienced. It seemed perfectly normal to me to have this happen even at such a young age.  		  		  			6739  			JB Rene A NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1jb_rene_a_nde.html  			my childhood memories way back in my home town in Kalibo.  		  		  			6776  			Karen R NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1karen_r_nde_6776.html  			Just basically flashbacks, examples but that part wasn't as vivid as a lot of the other stuff I experienced. This is too long, no more time right now.  		  		  			6790  			Shana S NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1shana_s_nde.html  			Fast life review of short eight years.  		  		  			6806  			Tonja BB NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1tonja_bb_nde.html  			I was given the knowledge of many past events that I didn't understand at thge time why they had happened. Now I understand why they had to happen they way they happened. Hard to explain in words. I wish I could show you.  		  		  			6820  			Mukurarinda D NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1mukurarinda_d_nde.html  			I was told whatever I did before since I was born.  		  		  			6823  			Ashutosh S NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1ashutosh_s_nde.html  			in a jiffy i saw my childhood.from a small kid to a teenager with my family enjoying withme  		  		  			6853  			Mattie K NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1mattie_k_nde.html  			my whole life replayd, none of it was not real  		  		  			6861  			Loni C NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1loni_c_nde.html  			I was not so much shown individual life choices, but was instructed on them as a whole.  		  		  			6865  			Hope C NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1hope_c_nde.html  			Yes within the boxes it was like looking at movies of events in my life.  		  		  			6871  			Olivia S NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1olivia_s_nde.html  			I came to be aware that the tiny little bubble of abuse and poverty I lived in was insignificant compared to &quot;what would be&quot; though I dont exactly know what that means in the scheme of things  		  		  			6882  			Avery D NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1avery_d_nde.html  			I seen every thing I did in my life like a slide clip  		  		  			6904  			Merida R NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1merida_r_nde.html  			Nothing horrible just my actions. Had I been a giving and good person? I had been an OK person with rather selfish desires.  		  		  			6925  			Atlanta NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1atlanta_nde.html  			Only general recollections that made me feel unworthy to enter this beautiful place.  		  		  			6936  			Jeff S NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1jeff_s_nde.html  			There was a life review and I acknowledged it. It was what it was when you don't know how to live your live correctly.  		  		  			6992  			Yazmine S NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1yazmine_s_nde.html  			I re-experienced every moment of my life in refined detail including all feelings,thoughts,sounds,smells,people,loves,hates,anger,sorrow,fear,happiness, fun times,food,everything up until I was in the Goldenness.. it was as if I had again lived my life , but from the standpoint of a witness.  		  		  			7057  			Lani K NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1lani_k_nde.html  			Certain childhood memories appeared. Playing outside with my sisters, living in Memphis, TN, enjoying my childhood friends. Happy memories!  		  		  			7060  			Donald C NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1donald_c_nde.html  			Most came wizzing by but the &quot;theft&quot; event was slowed to view.  		  		  			7068  			Walter N NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1walter_n_nde.html  			I was aware of my mother and I going to a spiritualist church years ago.  		  		  			7086  			Jill W NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1jill_w_nde.html  			Events from early in my life to the present, both large and small. They were not sequential.  		  		  			7089  			Sara J NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1sara_j_nde.html  			My whole life history passed quickly before me  		  		  			7111  			Marshall L NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1marshall_l_nde.html  			Flashes of my life like a movie theater reel.  		  		  			7116  			Lauren K NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1lauren_k_nde.html  			It was like a fast moving picture of my life. Nothing stood out in particular but a knowingness that all was ok.  		  		  			7131  			Justin M NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1justin_m_nde_7131.html  			i saw my past and all possible future paths through life  		  		  			7145  			Haze NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1haze_nde.html  			i had a privious experiance at about 14 whick i did flash thru my life  		  		  			7153  			Romy NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1romy_nde.html  			I saw everything that ever happened in my life and every single thought I had. I saw a childhood experience that I forgot ever happened, but than recalled it clearly after the NDE.  		  		  			7157  			Kathy VB NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1kathy_vb_nde.html  			I found myself falling in from the sky, my life passing before my eyes but not exactly in the way I perceived that phrase, not all in pictures (yes, there were flashes of some images) but in a knowing, a sense of everything I had experienced in life all within my mind, body and spirit and all at once.  		  		  			7177  			Rebecca P NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1rebecca_p_nde.html  			I only seemed to become aware of how my previous actions had been negligent to myself and my family.  		  		  			7179  			Maime S NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1maime_s_nde.html  			Please see above remarks. It was all about experiencing events throughout my life but suddenly with my eyes open and acutely aware of the emotions attached to these events.  		  		  			7196  			Rebekah J NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1rebekah_j_nde.html  			It was like flashes but very fast.  		  		  			7202  			Hannah F NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1hannah_f_nde.html  			I think as I traveled down the tunnel there was one image that shocked me of my childhood.  		  		  			7210  			Michael Joseph NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1michael_joseph_nde.html  			Described above. I did a full life review and saw everywhere where I had screwed up and relived the events not just from my perspective but also from the perspective of those I affected, both good and Bad.  		  		  			7219  			Gail A NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1gail_a_nde.html  			As a review.  		  		  			7260  			Glen D NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1glen_d_nde.html  			I was ware that a life-reveiw had begun, but strangely enough I remember it being very brief, and I don't recall many of the details of it at all.  		  		  			7263  			Sonya M NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1sonya_m_nde.html  			I was a rebellious teen drove my parents crazy I felt unworthy because of it  		  		  			7265  			Sally A NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1sally_a_nde_7265.html  			Flahes of things. Hard to describe. Like a very fast moving movie  		  		  			7291  			Karin F NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1karin_f_nde.html  			Yes seeing how I conducted myself at times was painful. I felt more pain when I saw myself inflict pain on another. I think that is the hell people speak of.  		  		  			7313  			Jacqueline HW NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1jacqueline_hw_nde.html  			Just quick flurries of my life and knowing that I am loved and that I am a good person.  		  		  			7316  			Ken D NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1ken_d_nde_7316.html  			I saw my whole life from when I was a baby up until that night  		  		  			7325  			Marie W NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1marie_w_nde.html  			during my experience I was reminded of events that had happened through out my life that explained the design of my life and the occurrences and how they were small parts of the greater whole of my life up to that moment. Such as when I was a child I had fallen thru a large floor vent during a house repair my parents were doing. In my death the angels reminded me of this and helped me remember that when I fell they had visited me and stayed with me and told me how pieces of my life were going to unfold.  		  		  			7336  			Cyanrose J NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1cyanrose_j_nde.html  			A full knowledge of my complete guilt for living immorally as I had.  		  		  			7387  			Lyndall W NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1lyndall_w_nde.html  			I believe that I was shown my life in detail and also given an understanding of why things happened  		  		  			7413  			Elle D NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1elle_d_nde.html  			Again, not so much about past events, other than my parents creating me and being born...more aware of being in the body and psychological stages of a growing child. For example, I saw myself at age 3 and also felt what it was like to be that age, how I perceived the world at that time...and this was repeated with each stage of development up until I became an old woman. I didn't see scenes from my past other than birth...I just saw the world again through the developmental consciousness.  		  		  			7433  			Anna A NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1anna_a_nde.html  			For a mere second... e.g. the life I'd lived on Earth seemed nothing but a second...  		  		  			7456  			Bahman R NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1bahman_r_nde.html  			I really dont remember what was the events but I can say that I reviewd more than half of my life events in my NDE 20 seconds !  		  		  			7474  			Mona Lisa R NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1mona_lisa_r_nde.html  			I had a life review  		  		  			7516  			Jennifer W NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1jennifer_w_nde_7516.html  			I was shown my life like on a screen all at once. It was as though I saw my whole life in a moment, not in flashes or a movie or even scenes, it was all at once. I saw everything and was detached from feelings of the life I lived and instead was filled with great compassion for how hard I had tried to attain perfection and to be kind and not be bitter but I still could not forgive myself for all the wrongs and mistakes, although through the voice, I did but once I came back, I still hated myself, maybe more because I couldn't take care of myself after the NDE.  		  		  			7526  			Leonard K NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1leonard_k_nde.html  			Then Mother pointed to the very center of the tunnel, and she explained there was a powerful light at the far end. Suddenly the light was before us. Mother had me stand alone while the light penetrated every part of me. I felt complete and taken apart at the same time. The best simple explanation I can give for how it felt would be like standing in front of a powerful fan while soaking wet. An incredible warm, penetrating wind entered me like life itself. I glowed with the light now, and I was extremely happy. I was in the form of a toddler, Mother and I were laughing together as she held me. Suddenly there was a vision in front of us that played like a movie of my life. We could see moments that I had actually lived on earth with my living family. Not only was I viewing those moments, but I was feeling them happen again as if I were there. I was very much loved by the living family members who played with me, and I was blessed with a large family that enjoyed spending time together. Mother and I could select any part of time in my life that we wished. I know that I witnessed my birth again. Nothing was said or explained about my birth, but I remember seeing something about it that stuck in my mind. More detail will be explained by me later in this story. I could feel myself being pulled out into the world, and I did not like the way the doctor handled me. One of my favorite visions came at a time when I recognized living members of my family sitting around the kitchen table in my parentÆs home. I cried out with joy when I saw my momÆs parents, Steve &amp; Bess Larkowski. There were other relatives there as well, but grandpa Steve stood out the most as he played a game with me. I was sitting safe and comfortable in my motherÆs arms. I reached my hand out toward grandpa, and he playfully made a face like he was going to gobble down my fingers. He did it in a funny and animated way that made me squeal with delight. I pulled my arm back to hug mom in safety. Then I turned around to stick my arm out again, and grandpa acted like he didnÆt see me, but suddenly my fingers were in his mouth, and he pretended to munch on my hand in a silly way. Once again I squealed with delight before retreating to mom. The whole family was laughing, and it was very pleasant to experience it again. Grandpa Steve truely loved to play with his grandchildren, and we all loved him very much. He could get a baby to laugh and play like nobody I have witnessed before, and there were many babies for him to play with because he had 11 kids of his own. One of my aunts is only a few years older than me. Mother and I held each other many times as we watched the different episodes of my short life. Then she came to one incident that was pointed out as important because I had done something that she wanted to correct. I lost my temper with my older brother, Steve. I remembered it happening because the high level of anger I felt toward him made it easy to lash out. I hit him on the head with a toy baseball bat. It was made of wood, and it hurt him more than I knew at the time. Mother pointed out that losing oneÆs temper to the point of hurting another is wrong, and I should never do it again. I understood completely, and I have never hit or injured another human being since. Not on purpose anyway. I mentioned this episode of my NDE to my earthbound mother many years later, and it baffled her because she had no recollection of me hurting Steve that way. Steve doesnÆt remember the incident either. I do, however, because I could feel the anger inside me at that moment.  		  		  			7545  			Catalina NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1catalina_nde.html  			I saw a &quot;video&quot; of myself, really fast.

There were things about my past life, that was shared with me, but it was also others involved in this.. people I didn't know, as a group gathered, it was shown to me why we have become disconnected with ourselves, the light and our universal connection..  		  		  			7581  			Alan S NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1alan_s_nde.html  			Past, present and future events were shown just after guardian stepped on to bus.  		  		  			7582  			Michael F NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1michael_f_nde.html  			Full life history  		  		  			7602  			Mira S NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1mira_s_nde.html  			It was a very quick flash of 'knowing' of past lives.  		  		  			7617  			Mike M NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1mike_m_nde.html  			We did a life review and I could see how my actions impacted others.  		  		  			7625  			Gray W NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1gray_w_nde.html  			when I was 15, a midday eclipse.

When I was out of my body, in discussion with the counselor, I was aware of my pre-teen insecurities, my abusive Granny (not to be confused with Omama, my loving grandmother on my father's side) and my dysfunctional family, things I would have been glad to be free of if I never went back.  		  		  			7734  			Steven K NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1steven_k_nde.html  			As I went under for the third time and just as the light appeared it seemed as if time slowed and my past flash before my eyes frame by frame.  		  		  			7764  			John D NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1john_d_nde_7764.html  			I kept trying to hold onto my memories and meager achievements, although i cannot remember which ones, or if i was holding onto my life more than my past events.  		  		  			7771  			GaeLawree C NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1gaelawree_c_nde.html  			during the different levels, I believe were past events or time.  		  		  			7772  			Deborah H NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1deborah_h_nde.html  			I was being judged and a binder with big metal rings that held an account of everything that I had ever done wrong.  		  		  			7780  			Joseph C NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1joseph_c_nde.html  			During theplayback aka judgement and saw future events (which are the the past years)  		  		  			7791  			Amber I NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1amber_i_nde.html  			Just before the accident (immediately or as it was happening) my life played before me as a movie.  		  		  			7795  			Katie W NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1katie_w_nde.html  			Jesus showed me events where I was not in love towards others or careless and hateful and how it affected so many people besided just the one person.

We discussed my life while I relived, seems like portions of it, proceeding from oldest to younger and only stopping when I seem to be uncertain of my own actions at the time. There were no condemnation, no right or wrong, complete acceptance and understanding with only one loving 'don't you think you could have done it this way' type of comment.

I later saw a picture of myself, of which I have few pictures of myself as a child, and I recognized that I was in the same park I was in during my NDE. I was about two in the photo. I had to ask my mother to find any photo of me for a class project in 2017, by which I see the pinafore dress I was wearing during my NDE.  		  		  			8617  			Bob H NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1bob_h_nde_8617.html  			Childhood memories, births of my kids, many many life events in vivid detail but NOT my entire life  		  		  			8698  			Edward C NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1edward_c_nde.html  			A flashback of my life was shown to me but it was very fast.  		  		  			8718  			Laurence B NDE  			https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1laurence_b_nde.html  			It was more like I knew everything.
