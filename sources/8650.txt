My husband Jeff   has submitted his NDE story to you. Now, I will add our Soulmate story.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I was a   young child, four years old, I had an imaginary friend. This imaginary friend   had a full name. My family took me to the minister in hopes of resolving this   imaginary friend thing. No one knew what to do. They decided to wait it out.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Time went on,   and it was my eighth year of life, when I felt this overwhelming sadness. My   friend was going away! My family was delighted, took me back to the minister,   who gave me the &quot;all things do pass&quot; speech.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His name was   never far from my thoughts. I went on, married into karmic debt, had children,   and always felt something was missing, and that led me back to wondering about   my imaginary friend, whose name I still remembered.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When my   karmic debt was finished, we parted ways, and I told a few friends about my   experience as a child. Each of them asked me why I had not looked for this man.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I began the   process of looking that very day. How would I go about doing something so   ambitious? It was an entirely new concept...

that I could find   this man, somewhere in the world, and he would be that particular Soul I knew as   a child, and we would know each other.

How do you look   for someone whose name you know, and, yet, there could be many people with that   name?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Interesting   concept. Required some real thinking on my part.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I sent my   Soul out to connect with him, and told him to him me, to find a way to meet me.   I did this daily. I asked all my friends if they knew him, to be aware if they   would meet someone by his name, to know this was the person I was looking for. I   knew I would probably meet him through my Inner Soul Group.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three years   after I began the process to look for this man, a woman came into my life, and   we got into this conversation that had been a yearly discussion for me. I told   her my story, and I told her who I was looking for. And she said she knew this   man and would introduce me to him.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were   complications. He was in a committed relationship of some duration. I put it   back up to my Soul: if this is the person, then let him show me, in some way,   that this is him.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Within a very   short amount of time, circumstances changed in his life, and he was driving out   from California to meet someone he had only a handful of conversations with.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we met,   it was gradual and instant...gradually knowing this person again and instantly   recognizing that this was the person I was looking for. We married within the   year, and it has been fifteen years now.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I told my   friends, who were amazed at how I could even find this person. What I did   worked.    </body>
