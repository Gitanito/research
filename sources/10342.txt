  		              		Experience Description   

    I was intentionally hit by a car on the way to school. The man who did it tried to kill me  on purpose. 
  
  I was hit by the car and sustained a concussion where I  could not speak for a some time after the event. 
  
  When  I could talk again, I told my mum how I had seen two police officers knocking at our door. I saw how she had gotten into their car and was questioned by a neighbor on to why she was getting into a police car. My mum said that what I had said was exactly how it had happened.
  
  After a few more weeks, I remember being in the hospital on a bed drifting in and out of consciousness, knowing the man had tried to kill me and addressing the fact that my life was not very happy at the time anyway.  I decided I did not want to live anymore. I slowed down my breathing, hoping that I would die. Then I remember being on a country lane with a meadow to the left and trestle to the right. There was a gentle breeze.
  
  I had a feelings that are still with me today. I was in total comfort and full of  joy and happiness. I had such  massive feelings of love. I felt no pain. It was incredible and I can’t put words together to explain how wonderful it was.
  
  Next, I remember playing in a stream. I heard a voice of a woman with an Irish accent say to me, 'You can’t stay here.' I said, 'I want to stay  here.'  She asked,  'What about your Mother?' I could not answer.
  
  This is all I remember of the NDE.

  I am a very spiritual person. I have a great ability to know when things are going to happen. I don’t fear death.  I know that the most important thing in life is love. I think the NDE made me this way.

  I see the experience as  a positive event in my life. I really look forward to going back there one day !!!
