I was rushed to the hospital to be operated on. All seemed to go well, then all of my sutures inside broke and I was rushed back to surgery. During emergency surgery, I felt as if I was levitating and I could look down at the operating table and see the surgeons working on me. 

I felt very cold and just wanted to be warm again. I kept levitating higher, the higher I went the warmer I became. Then a woman started towards me, I became very frightened. I said 'Who are you? I don't know you.' She said that she was my grandmother's mother whom I had never met. She said, 'Everything will be okay, come with me.' I told her I did not want to go, she kept telling me to come with her. I kept saying, 'No, I don't want to go,' and started crying. 

She left without me and I started to descend, the further down I went the colder I became.

That is all I remember, but after a long recovery I told my parents and doctors what happened. They dismissed all of it because I was a small child.
