Periodically in the history of the
world it becomes essential for men men­
tally akin to find each other; to know each
other, and in unison deliver a message
of truth to enlighten, to strengthen, to
correct mistakes in an effort to avoid just
what has happened to us all. But how is
this to be done, if not by education ? Not
to condemn the methods of others, but to
substitute a better way that will defend
itself.
All religions embody good and have
bettered the world. There are still two
factors: Faith and Science; two rules,
and both are evidently right. Is it expect­
ing too much that Religion and Science
together create the third principle, result­
ing in the transformation of the world
*
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
into one human family of many children,
each to his own? With Science to pre­
serve order by eliminating fraud and
trickery, there would be no fear of judg­
ing the innocent as guilty.
As man is inclined toward supertti-
tion, he naturally falls an easy pray to
those clever enough to deceive his eye.
In fact, some of the brightest minds of
the nineteenth and twentieth centuries
have been completely deceived in this way.
The possibility of our loved ones return­
ing after having passed away, or at least
of sending us some message or thought,
cannot be doubted. But it is the unreli­
ability of the method used to receive these
messages, as well as the unreliability of
the person receiving them, which gives
rise to a question. The truth is often
exaggerated, and the open-minded victim
easily duped.
2
P R E F A C E
W ithin mankind there is a power
•so great that it would be dangerous to
know it until we are perfect in humility
and self-control. Until then it is hidden
from us by our selfish, animal nature
which causes the mind to become cloudy
and discontented.
Even as trees sleep in the winter and
blossom again in the Spring, so also does
Humanity alternately sleep and blossom:
periodically come the fruits of genius,
great minds and sensitive souls who give
voice, as “human radios”, to the great
Broadcasting of the Ages, the Song oi
Truth. And with their passing, humanity
gradually falls asleep again until the next
“wave” or cycle.
In this spiritual sleep, this ebb of
the Soul, is the “heyday” of false pro­
phets: therein will be found the origin
of Superstition, in “imitation” of that
3
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
which did hold some truth, but is now a
word without meaning, a body without a •
soul.
W hy do supposedly great but false
prophets and teachers flourish for a day
and then die in obscurity, leaving no
flourishing field to prove the fertility of
their teaching?
T he shell of the wheat was there;
the words and phrases — all borrowed
to feed people who do not think for them­
selves: and even when planted, gave up
no fruit because the spirit of God was
lacking, and because they who professed,
denied the Simplicity which was the Soul
itself.
Man slowly approaches the epoch
of the Human Radio. His antenna of im­
agination opens that inner ear that hears
the silent broadcast of the ages. It still
vibrates in the atmosphere. Man’s mortal

ear already hears the music and the
words. . .
We may view this psychologically
rather than from a spiritual or religious
point of view; nevertheless it is clear that
an even greater revelation will accompany
the discovery of a “radio” in the human
mind, than that which took place indus­
trially, internationally and domestically
with the invention and introduction of
radio into our homes.
T he entire universe is within the
human head in the same manner that the
music being broadcasted from various
cities all over the world is within the
radio, or within the room in which it is
being received.
We forget that a well-governed and
trustworthy imagination contains the tools
that make education from the specifi-
5
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
cations of wisdom; that therein also are m
the antennae of man with which he
searches for God: that aerial to receive
the message; the chamber of transforma­
tion in which the “word is made flesh” ;
where thoughts are dramatized in symbols
which are revelations if they be attuned
to “facts”.
W e still have more to learn of the
rooms of man’s mind, to find the doors
leading to that religious ecstasy, the mys­
tery, the frenzy of the aborigines, the bliss
of divinity felt by martyrs and saints, the
hypnotic power of our professional
men — all still in its infancy.
No one will deny facts, unless he
has a subtle purpose to use opportunities
for selfish purposes. Truth is self-evi­
dent, and needs no support. It supports
itself. And if the pillars of a structure
are lies, it will but collapse. Still, the spir-
6
&
P R E F A C E
® it of true support is ever present, so that
a new permanent structure shall rise from
the ashes and dust of falsehood. There
are ever present health germs to continue
life, even among death germs. That is
the law of adjustment, compensation and
^ growth, the manifestation of life.
All that matters most to man is
back of his own eyes, and there he floun­
ders in the dark, thinking he thinks a
thought, but unware of the origin of that
thought, or of its fruits: “imagining”
things without the slightest conception of
the power and mechanism that he is using.
Surely we may learn much by watch­
ing the insect with its antennae moving
in every direction, sensing the danger we
cannot see. It protects itself without that
great gift to man: Imagination. It only
acts upon its inherent power of Instinct.
It uses its antennae to sense approaching
danger which it avoids, but knows not its
7
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
source, without reason. Why should not
man have a more highly developed sense
by the protection of reason, or the cause
with its effect?
If the same amount of energy and
education had been utilized for psycholog- )
ical, mental and spiritual power as for
the comforts of economic, mechanical and
electrical power, what would have been
accomplished to further the progress of
humanity?
J
T here is no excuse for man to un­
derestimate the power of the mind at the
loss of his inheritance from God or Na­
ture. from ancestry, or self-acquired. If
we refuse to use reason and logic as a
foundation to intuition, whom can we j
blame for the failure in evolution; whom
but our own negligence? Nature offers
us her fruits. Why are men ashamed to
admit their belief for or against spirit­
uality?
8
How can anyone judge or give an
opinion of the power of prayer, of Chris­
tianity, or of the prophets, unless he has
given it a lifetime of experience to see the
answer, and then left us the records, by
which we may judge?
T here is much that might be said
of certain facts and truth that would but
compel us to search the Book of Mistakes
made by those who were sincere, but too
enthusiastic to allow Nature to grow in
its own good time; where swords have
been unsheathed without provocation. only
in fear of apparently losing opportunities.
If there be any loss, let us go back and see
whether the purse had a hole in it; wheth­
er the compass was influenced by a nail;
whether the watch kept good time as it
should, or whether we were controlled by
our stomach, our heart or our mind. . .
We are ever traveling toward the
9
future, where all truth is born. Should }
we waste time in disputing the possibility
of truth we think we have not, or be open
to the possibilities that the world shall
know tomorrow, as yesterday gave us for
today?
We have a duty we owe to human­
ity — to those who have knocked upon
doors of empty churches, temples and
schools, but not prisons. We must help
men and women who can do work; not
as missionaries, nor under the flags of -J*
politics, cults or isms, but just pure, clean-
hearted leaders who are handicapped, dis­
couraged, held back — being used as
stepping-stones to respectability by the
profane.
— J
W hy waste time, paper and ink ana­
lyzing flavors, the taste of fruit. Let us
eat what Nature has given for thousands
of years, and turn it into good health,

joy, long life, and normal appreciative
thoughts, so that the real knowledge of
life may be born normally for today and
tomorrow, and not for thousands of years
hence.
We cannot afford to spend much
time considering the opinions or methods
of yesterday; nor stop to harvest their
fruits today, when we must plant for a
new generation, knowing that all those
who do not now understand will grad­
ually do so as time passes: for “Time
proveth all things”.
T he individual awakening and cul­
tivation of intuition is the foremost con­
cern of all leaders and teachers who may

era '■until all education is“prevement edu­
cation” our prohlems as a nation shall

11
Written history contains no rec­
ords of a nation in the position in which
the United States of America now stands,
with the possibilities in its hands for the
manifestation of a spirit of prevenience
that would enable it to liecome the dom­
inating culture of a new epoch by demon­
strating a new level of revolutionary
“warfare” without muscle and bloodshed,
as an example to set before the other
nations of the world.
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
W ho shall plant the seeds of the
new viewpoint in the ground thus made
ready : who but those thinkers and leaders
who prove by their stability, adaptability,
reliability and endurance that they have
been chosen by their own fertility to sur­
vive as the foundations for new structures
and the roots of a new generation?
As Americans should we not fight
for what America represents, as the melt-
12
ing pot of the world, with many laws in­
herited, yet obeying but one law: that of
our pioneering forefathers for freedom
of thought, speech and religion founded
on logic, reason and reality, as well as
("and above all), one supreme Being of
Power that may be clothed in any raiment
desired; but internally one and the same
Hub of that Wheel of Truth, where the
spokes are teachers and exemplifiers; the
rim, those whose personal responsibility
is to protect those who teach; the steel
hoop, the beasts of burden; and the
movements, of the combined machinery
of the world?
T hings have only been partly done.
The mansion still in process. We are all
but workers at the scaffolding (parties
and divisons) of A m erica as well as
Christianity. When a mansion is done,
what happens to the scaffolding? It is
torn down, revealing the completed ex-
13
amples as models for a Universal Christi­
anity and a United Nations of the World.
The two are inseparables, the north
and south poles of each other, the spirit
and the body, the ideals and the nation,
the way of life and the government to
make it possible.
Can we expect to crystalize “Utopia"
and usher in the long-heralded Millen­
nium? That’s not the question. It is the
dream and the vision that point down the
Highway. Tho we fall by the wayside and
never reach it, we must believe in it.
Otherwise we travel in vicious circles. It
is only the hope that leads us on.
T h e pr o b l em s o f t h e ag es still face
us, but today we are better equipped than
ever before to understand them, if we
will only discard the limiting thought-
habits of ancestral education, and adopt
the mental tools and implements offered

us today, with which to understand and
shape tomorrow.
W hat excuse have we to neglect a
Progress that we may further in our own
way? Who should he to Name in the
misunderstanding of a bugle call — the
wounded lii>s that fail to shape the notes,
the bugle, or the man who is supposed to
know the signal and fails to execute?
Someone must hit the gong so the
blind may hear the hour. Another must
turn the hands for the deaf, so they may
see. Why the slate and chalk, memory's
purpose and traces of the Blueprint?
Surely there must he many laborers to
one architect or overseer. Why should
we deny our destiny? If there be an
effect, surely there has been a cause. If
we hear an echo, there must have been
a voice to send it. If you or I have an
Ideal to express, whence came its cause?

G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
Others may try to play music and fail.
Why ? Is it for the want of a piano, a
melody, or trained fingers?
If you have dreams and visions only,
without framing them exposed to eyes
that seek them, you speak a langage which
you alone understand. It is useless to
those called to cooperate with you —
workmen of the temple idle, waiting for
your designs while you sleep, and they
vanish. Whom do you think shall spin,
weave, work in the quarries, or gather
timber to materialize dreams given you.
if you fail to sing your melody?
W hy cannot more men utilize the
gifts they really possess, but which they
do not seem to realize are in their posses­
sion ? Why carry the newly felled trees
to be made into lumber, when beasts of
burden would gladly carry them for a
cast-off meal? Why all the spiritual con-
tfi
P R E F A C E
fusion throughout the world, when there
is no discord where truth exists?
How m a n y fine minds are there hid­
den in obscurity at the front line of Com­
mercialism, shackled to an organization
because of wages and an inferiority com­
plex ; while if but allowed to dream, away
from the grinding note of gears, a new
musician, poet or scientist may be born.
Give men a chance to spread their shallow
or clay roots. The top can always be
pruned from faults. But let their roots
alone, to allow character to prove their
value before we forget why we live, and
how.
Why do no t men of learning come to­
gether to exchange views, as pugilists do
blows; wrestlers, holds; athletes, feats of
endurance: so that monuments of knowl-
^ g e may be like large, fine trees as land­
marks to the wayfaring man who is trav-
17
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
eling through unknown lands, the laby­
rinth of the world’s paths, to his home
and loved ones, whether mortal or im­
mortal, —and do those things for the
sake of truth instead of wealth and glory ?
Truth itself is glorified; and so are they
wiio dispense it.
T he progress of the world's educa­
tion, research and understanding would
be so much more enhanced if we allowed
thinking men to do their thinking with­
out a handicap. Let them be able to think
and do their best while the man with
muscle removes stumbling blocks so the
dreamer may dream visions governed by
thinkers for the doers to give it life.

Still, all are expected to eat from the
same plate the same amount; dress alike,
be punished alike, rewarded alike, and
die alike. Why not examine the tumblers
of these human locks and see who should
be trusted most, and with what responsi­
bility — so that we will find geniuses
to teach us short methods, instead of
waiting for them every century or so?
T he trouble with most of us is that
we shape things to snit ourselves, accord­

should permit truth to come to us, crys-

to come to teach them; all looking in dif­

found a cult or a “system” ? The Master

hot, and it cools him. One is covered
with dust, and it blows away this dust,
fanning the hair from his eyes. One
draws bow at his enemy, and the Breeze
prevents, carrying it back to the sender.

At best we are but cogs in the Wheel
of Time, and call it "History” — which
is hut the echo for philosophers: the
flames, and the smoke rolling away:
cause and effect, blinded by the blind­
ness of man to know neither the begin­
ning nor the end, nor what is one; think­
«> #l
ing mortal what is immortal; feeling the
heat; seeing the smoke; combining noth­
ing as one cause — thinking only in
jets, as the beating and breathing of
heart and lungs. Is it not true?

The only cause a man has for not
realizing his power as a man, is that he
never has tried to select the mental food
his brain should digest to prove how in
all simplicity his Ideals lie at his feet
if he will but select the mental food to
accomplish all his desires which but

G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
cast their shadow before him. Let him
but awaken his gift of logic and reason
to realize that to think a thing is to shape
action, energy and influence to that crea­
tion thought. For we only want those
things made manifest by what we have
allowed our brain to consume.
Thus we arrive at the purpose of these
prefatory and fragmentary paragraphs,
which is to provide a few samples of the
food for thought which has sustained me
in the continuation of that Quest of which
the beginning is subjected to both chron­
icle and commentary in '‘Cates of the
Mind".

INTRODUCTION
-♦*
No man can contribute to the world
more than his own personal experience,
the harvest of his own research and ex­
periment, unless it be the fruit of inspi­
ration or prophetic insight. The works
of Joseph Sadony contain a rich store
of both.
“Gates of the Mind" is one of a
number of manuscript volumes thus far
withheld from publication by the author.
Though its sub-title is “The Autobiog­
raphy of a Man and a 'Feeling' ”, di­
gressions from the narrative reveal that
its purpose is not autobiographical. It is
an introduction to the anatomy of pro­
phetic intuition. The small book here
privately printed is rather less than a
condensation" ; it contains but a small
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
portion of the first volume of this un­
published work.
Underlying and eclipsing the narra­
tive is a rationale of the physiological
foundations and scientific investigation
of mental phenomena considered as tele-
empathic and telepathic phenomena of
the human nervous system.
It is a'conclusion of the author and
his associates in research that most mys­
tic, psychic and occult terms used in de­
scribing mental phenomena are mislead­
ing, that there exist no mysterious “fac­
ulties” of a mystic or occult nature, but
that the imagination, if used correctly,
is capable of portraying past, present or
future events within the limitations im­
posed by the fact that the imagination is
dependent entirely on memory of past
sensory experience to provide the ele­
ments of its portrayal.
For example, the author claims tliat
the term, “thought-transferrence" is a
ii
O
INTRODUCTION

misnomer; that it is impossible for what
is usually designated a “thought” to be
transferred from one mind to another
mind, hut that it is possible and of com­
mon occurrence to induce in another mind
a thought that is similar to one experi­
enced in your own mind, or vice versa.
The exact degree of similarity will de­
pend upon the similarity of past experi­
ence. The induced thought, however, is
entirely the product of the selective stim­
ulation of memory-elements in an activity
of the imagination. The thought is your
own, and has not been “transferred”
from another mind, even though it be
similar in every respect. A phenomena
has taken place, but it is one of thought-
induction, not thought-trajisferrence.
We are living through a crisis the
full extent and meaning of which is re­
alized only by a few. We are and have
lieen witnessing periods of confusion and
revolution not only in world politics, in
iii
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
science, education, industry and art, but
also in psychology, philosophy and re­
ligion.
We are witnessing and sliall witness
the collapse of theories and concepts in
all fields of thought. No science can con­
tinue to stand on its present foundations
without adjustments made necessary by
the confusion and poverty of existing
verbal organization. Neither the philos­
ophies nor the psychologies can with­
stand the critical application of the oper­
ational view with any greater success
tlian the physical sciences. They will be
forced to a more strict correlation of
"Language Logic and Life”.
Thus we have undergone and are
still undergoing a revolution in the phys­
ical sciences. Even now new foundations
are being laid to complete the bridge ex­
tending from atomic to organic, thence
to astronomic dimensions. The biologist
must know his physics and chemistry as
iv
+ j
*
* well as his psychology; and a psycholo­
gist without knowlege of the former is
not worthy of the name. The philosopher
who does not know by first-hand research
and experimentation these fundaments
of life and the physical universe must
resign himself to his own amusement,
for his mental structures can be only
dialectic castles in the air.
The confusion of the age was mani­
fest in the first few sessions of the “Con­
ference on Science, Philosophy and Re­
ligion" at the opening of World War II.
The scholars admitted that they were con­
fused, and that they did hot know how
to “think with a view to action”, or how
to teach each other to the end of reach­
ing mutual understanding and agreement.
As a result they were forced to agree
to disagree, to predict a pluralistic in­
stead of a monolithic civilization.
“Gates of the Mind” is the beginning
of an answer to the scholars on the part

of a student of life and human nature, <
a seeker for truth and an independent
investigator on an experimental basis of
the operations of the human mind in re­
lation to physiological and psychological
consequences. Here for the first time is
the beginning of a detailed account of a 4
personal adventure in the deliberate and
purposive development of prophetic in­
tuition, and its application to problems of
nature and human nature, science, philos­
ophy, religion, education, industry, war
and peace. 4
There has been need for an effort on
the part of someone capable of experi­
encing and demonstrating as well as ob­
serving so-called psychic and mental phe­
nomena to separate the wheat from the
chaff, to paint the picture of just wliat *
can and cannot be expected of it in the
present state of man’s development; to
save the true and the beautiful, the spon­
taneous and natural function of man's
vi
«
sympathetic sensitivities from all the tech­
nical and psychic "racketeering'.’; to en­
courage the individual development of
these sensitivities along healthy and con­
structive lines, and to discourage the
authoritarian capitalization of psycholog­
ical or spiritual truths and the subjuga­
tion of peoples by psychological tricks.
In tliis small book is the beginning of
Mr. Sadony’s answer to this need.

From the view of some a greater im- ^
portance should be attached to the appli­
cation of prophetic intuition to funda­
mental problems of science, philosophy,
education and religion rather than to ele­
ments of mere personal experience. But
to the layman there can be nothing more ^
important than how he can benefit by
personal experience rather than by the
acquisition of knowledge or theory con­
cerning the more abstruse problems of
science or philosophy.
For his benefit, then, who cares little ^
for the deeper problems that might be

My mother was showing me a pic­

She said, “That is where I was born.
Joseph.”
For a minute I looked at it, and it
didn’t seem right.
I said, “But mother, shouldn’t there
be a river over here?” I pointed to the
right. “And shouldn’t there be a barn be­
sides just a house?”
“What makes you say that, Joey? The
artist made this just like it was. No. We
were away from the river. We had no
barn. What makes you say that?”
"Well, anyway,” I said, “1 remember
the river, and a barn and a bridge.”

Mother said, “Joseph, you mustn't
talk like that. You never went as far as
the river. You couldn't possibly remember
it. Besides, that’s where your father was

Suddenly my mother stopped and
looked at me, biting her lower lip. For a
moment she seemed not to see me, though
looking right at me.
I said, “Mother! What’s the matter?”
She said, “Joseph, you couldn’t pos­
sibly remember that, because you were
never there, but that’s where your father
was born, by the river, near a bridge. And
vour grandfather had a barn, because he
had horses. That was on the Rhine, near
Coblens.”

Herman was my only brother, and he
was older than I was. When I was seven
he was twelve. He was a cripple boy from
birth, but he was beautiful and he was
- 2-
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
• good. I always went to Herman when I
didn't understand something and no one
else would talk with me.
It was Spring, and we were watching
a robin build, a nest outside the window.
I said, “Do you think that’s the same
® one that built there last year, the nest that
fell down when the wind blew this win­
ter?”
Herman said, “I think it's maybe one
of the young ones that were born in the
^ old nest.”
1 said, “But how would it know? If it
was bora in the old nest, how would it
know to build a new one? Can a mother
robin teach it?"
Herman said, “A bird doesn't have to
• be taught how to build a nest. It just
knows.”
But how?” I insisted.
WeU, they call it instinct, Joey, but
what that is I can’t tell you. I guess it's

bom in them because the mother and fa- /
ther knew, back and back so far that no­
body knows anything about it.”
“Herman, do you think we know
things because mother and father knew
them, even if they don’t tell us?”
“Well, I think maybe we feel things
and do things like they did, Joey. I’ve
heard father say you are sometimes just
like grandpa Jean Mare Felix Reipert.
He was a Book-binder, like Unde, and an
artist too, always working with his hands
making things like you do.”
I said, “Herman, sometimes I feel as
if I could almost remember things before
I was born. But just when I think I do,
I forget it again. Do you ever feel that
wav?”
Herman said, “Well, I know what
you mean. It’s like a dream. When you
wake up you can’t remember it, but you
know you were dreaming.”
T said, “Yes, only it’s not when I'm
-4-
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
♦
asleep, Herman. It’s when I’m awake,
and when I’ve been thinking and then
stop thinking for a minute. When I start
thinking again, it’s gone.”
Herman looked at me a minute and
said, “You've always been funny that
way, Joey. When you say things without
thinking, you are usually right and every­
one wonders how you know. But when
you think about things you act like you
didn’t know anything at all. I suppose
you know that sometimes worries mother
because she’s afraid father won’t under­
stand it. He doesn’t like that sort of thing
one little bit.”
“But what can I do about it, Her­
man?”
“Well, I wouldn’t say too much with­
out thinking when father is around. It’s
better when he thinks you're dumb than
when he worries wondering what's got
into you. Some day I'll tell you why he
worries about it.”

“Tell me, Herman! Please tell me!”
“Sh! Joey, they'll hear us. I'll tell
you sometime when nobody's home but
you and me."
3.
It was pitch dark and I woke from a
nightmare in a cold sweat. I must have
cried out in niv sleep because mother had
her hand over my mouth, whispering
"He quiet. Joseph! Don't wake your fa­
ther. What were you dreaming?"
I said, "I dreamed that Herman was
hanging on the wall with his arms out,
like on a cross. He was nailed there."
My mother gasped and said, "Joey!
Promise me you won’t tell anyone that!
Don’t tell your father, and don't tell Her­
man or your sisters.”
I promised, and then asked, “Why?”
“Because,” she said, “Your father
doesn’t like such things, and we mustn't
think of them or tell about them. But
- 6-
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
you frighten me.”
“I’m sorry, mother.”
“I’m not blaming you, Joseph. You
can’t help it how strange it is. I dreamed
a dream like that about Herman the
night you were bom, and I didn’t dare
say anything about it, because eight
months before you were bom I started
dreaming strange dreams, and they all
came true. That never happened to me
before, and it has never happened since
you were bom. But during that time all
my dreams came true except that last one
about Herman. You’re the first I’ve told
because now you dream it too! Let us
say a prayer, Joey, and not tell anyone.”
4.
So mother left me, but I didn’t sleep.
Something troubled me, but I did not
know what it was. It was something more
than my dream about Herman; some­
thing that made me feel all alone in the
-7-
G A T E S O F T H E M I X D
world, even with a large family.
I lay in the dark, and then suddenly
something happened to me that I did not
comprehend until years later, in memory.
The vague distress of an internal con­
flict I could not understand suddenly
vanished. In that moment I gained a new
sense of identity. Yet I felt like a stran­
ger in the bosom of my own family. Sud­
denly I didn't know who T was. and lay
there in the dark asking myself, “Who
am I ? Where am I ? How did I get
here?"
But there was no uneasiness in the
sensation; rather a sense of impending
excitement, as if I had entered a new
world and could hardly wait to explore
it. Somewhere in this new world a treas­
ure was hidden, and I would find it. For
some reason my heart was glowing as if
I had fallen in love with something I
couldn't see. All my inner senses were
affected by this, so that I imagined 1

G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
heard music, but it was just my memory
of the organ in church with the choir
singing. I imagined smelling perfume,
hut it was just the memory of a bowl of
red rose petals that we had saved one
time. I imagined that strong, tender arms
picked me up, but I could see no face be­
cause I was suddenly tired, and suddenly
safe. W ien I woke it was morning.
5.
The world was the same, after all;
but something inside of me was different.
I felt happy about something and didn't
know why. I saw more than I usually did.
f stopped to look at things that I usually
]>assed by; and when I looked at the same
old things I had seen every day, I now
saw something 1 hadn’t seen before. I
smelled odors I hadn't noticed before,
and identified them in my mind. I heard
sounds and knew what they meant with­
out turning my head to look. I felt the
-9-
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
urge to go out exploring, but suddenly
felt the need of sharing all this new
world with someone who would under­
stand it. I thought of Herman, but he
was crippled and couldn't go with me.
So I stayed home with Herman. I
couldn't tell him about my dream, so I
asked him. “Herman, can’t you tell me
now why father worries about what gets
into me? Mother is outside now. No one
will hear us. The girls have gone too.
What is father worried about? What
does he think is going to happen to me?”
"Well, he thinks something gets into
you, Joey. And he doesn't know whether
it’s a devil or an angel. Sometimes he’s
sure it’s a devil, and that it’ll lead you to
no good end. Remember how one time
you would run off with his gun and go
shooting by the castle on the Rhine; and
next thing he knew you would be playing
priest with an old soap box for an altar,
serving mass? One day you would be

• catching crabs down by the pond, and
spend hours looking at the worms you
•would break out of those long stick-like
things you found. And next day you
would imitate S t Joseph, and say you
wanted to be a carpenter.”
® “Do I have to be the same all the
time, Herman?”
“Not for my part, Joey. That's what
I like about you. One never knows what
you are going to say or do next”
t j "Doesn't father like that?”
“Well, it isn't just that. It's when you
say things about the future, or when you
seem so positive alwut something you
couldn’t possibly know. And when things
happen to you that are mysterious.”
^ “But nothing mysterious happens to
me, Herman.'’
“Do you remember the time you had
Uncle take you coasting on Montabaur
hill? You didn't have a sled so you took
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
a ladder instead. The hill was all ice, and
at the bottom was the cross-road. Uncle
said a team of horses was coming, but it
was too late for him to stop you, and you
could not stop yourself. He said there
was nothing on earth could keep you
from being killed or badly hurt.”
“But I wasn’t hurt a bit, Herman.”
“That's just the thing, Joey. Ladder
and all you shot right through between
the legs of the horses, entirely unhurt.
How did you do it? You didn't know. No
one knew. That was a mystery. And then
when they asked you if you weren’t
frightened when you saw the team ahead
of you, you said no, you weren’t, because
the minute you saw them you thought
about something else and forgot all about
them.”
“Well, I did, Herman. I closed my
eyes, and saw the picture in the church.”
“Yes, I know, Joey. But you said you
knew you weren't going to he hurt.”

G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
"I did know it. I wasn't hurt.”
“Well, all right. I believe you. But
I'm showing you what worries father.
When they asked you how you knew you
weren’t going to be hurt bad or killed,
you said it was because you were going
to marry a girl named Mary, with black
eyes and dark hair when you were twen­
ty-seven years old, so that’s how you
knew you weren't going to lie killed l>e-
fore then.”
“That's how I did know, Herman.”
“Well, that’s what father doesn't like.
It’s either nonsense, or you know. And if
you know, how do you know? He doesn’t
like it eitlier way, Joey.”
“But I did know, Herman. I saw it
when T was looking at the picture in the
church. Altd when I saw the te;mi of
horses I closed my eyes and saw the pic­
ture. Then I remembered that I was go­
ing to be married when I was twenty-
seven. So how could anything happen to
-13-
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
me now?"
“Well, I’m sure I don't know, Joseph,
and I hope nothing happens to you. But
I think it would he better if you didn’t
say things like that for father to hear."
6.
So that night I lay there again in the
dark feeling like a stranger. I tried to re-
member how it all came about that I was
there, and why I felt like I sometimes
did. It was the “Feeling" that made me
say things and think things like Herman
said father didn’t like, and mother seemed
to understand but hushed me up so he
wouldn’t hear me.
I was six years old and we were still
in Montabaur when there began to be
talk in the family about going to America.
It was then that I began to be conscious
of a world beyond the village limits. I
climbed to the top of the hill to try to
see some of it. I was alone, but I imag-
-14-
♦
*
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
ined that men were walking up the hill
with me, and that I was one of them.
We all had on light, flexible suits of
armor, like fish scales made of metal.
There was a bright red cross on each
breast, a sword in one hand and a Bible
in the other.
It was fifty years before I found out,
inadvertently, that the village of Monta-
baur and the hill I climbed that day, were
originally called Humbach; and that cen­
turies before me the Crusaders had
climbed that hill and looked down over
the beautiful country, calling it “The
Holy Land”. The hill reminded them of
that Mount which Christ had ascended
to pray, with Peter, James and John,
where He was transfigured before them.
So they christened it Mount Tabor, and
henceforth the little village at its foot was
called Montabaur.
I did not know this as I trudged a-
long that day. surrounded by the cre-
-15-
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
ation of my own imagination, a company
of Christian warriors with swords and
Bibles.
When I reached tile top I still could
not see America. So I closed my eyes,
but all I could “see” was a lot of Indians.
That was of course because of what I
had heard about America.
7.
So far as I know now I had no knowl­
edge of the Crusaders, or in any case of
their relation to the Hill at Montabaur.
Of course it is possible there was a foun­
dation for the “image-play” without my
remembering it. The fact is here unim­
portant as the purpose of these early re­
collections is more to provide the back­
ground and to jKirtray the general nature
of early thought-elements as based on ex­
perience.
At present this is merely illustrative
of a later problem: IVhot distinguishes
-16-
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
♦
a “true” imagination from a “false" one
as an element of imaginative experience
when it is regarded as an established fact
that we can think only with what we have
acquired to think with? In other words,
all imaginative experience is made up of
combinations and recombinations of ele­
ments of sensory experience with a phys­
iological foundation. Nevertheless it has
been established by experiment that the
separate parts or memory-elements may
be put together correctly or incorrectly
to form a true or false internal represen­
tation of external events or conditions.
What distinguishes between the "true”
and the “false” when immediate verifi­
cation by observation or experiment is
impossible?
The answer, later to be set forth more
fully, is that the distinguishing charac­
teristic of a "true” imagination is a
"feeling” that must be felt in order to
understand its nature.
-

G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
I did not at first comprehend this, but *
now in looking back at many thousands
of imaginative experiences of childhood
and youth, I see that when the exercise
of the imagination is either unaccompa­
nied by any feeling whatsoever, or when
the imagination produces a feeling as a O
result of its exercise, (e.g. imagining In­
dians is followed by a feeling of excite­
ment and anticipation), the imagination
is not to be trusted unless a train of
thought is followed back to determine its
origin, and unless the logic and reason <
i>
are sufficiently matured and trained to
adjust and retouch the picture in accord­
ance with experience, or reason based on
observation and experiment.
On the other hand if a certain type
of “feeling" (which is a dominant ex­
perience throughout this record) pre­
cedes the exercise of the imagination, and
in fact produces the imagination, by se­
lective stimulation and blending of mem-
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
f
%
ory elements to express, to clothe, to em­
body or to interpret the “feeling", we
have then a type of spiritual inspiration
and mental phenomena that merits fur­
ther investigation to which an introduc­
tion will be found in these pages.
8.
My first experiences of a distinction
in feeling associated with imagination
were largely unrealized at the time, but
preserved in memory. In climbing Mount
Tabor, for example, the “feeling” came
over me first that I was not alone. This
caused me to imagine myself surrounded
with companions all starting out together
for some distant place to fight a battle.
We would have swords but we would al­
so have Bibles. The Cross would be our
armor inside, but outside we would need
armor of steel.
I did not then realize that these de­
tails characterized the Crusaders who
-19-
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
gave the hill historic background and a
name. All the elements were familiar to
me, but not the history. My memory con­
tained swords, Bibles, Crosses, metal ar­
mor and the idea of men who would use
these things. Emphatically, I did not see
the “spirits” of Crusaders walking up
the hill with me. What I “saw” was en­
tirely the product of my own imagination
in which was composited various elements
of memory acquired by previous sensory
experience.
But these memory-elements were se­
lectively stimulated, assembled and im­
bued with life by a “feeling” at a partic­
ular time, under a particular condition,
at a particular place which invested them
with a meaning I did not myself compre­
hend until fifty years later. Whence and
What the ‘‘feeling”? Why the particular
mental imagery evoked by the feeling?
Not in these few childhood cases alone,

G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
extending throughout a lifetime; my own
and the lives of many others whose ex­
periences I have investigated.
That was the Quest in which, sym­
bolically at least. I set forth with a sword
in one hand and a Bible in the other, to
find the answer. I sought the truth, and
as time went on I found that my imag­
ination provided the truth in one instance
and deceived me in another. It deceived
me when I used my own reason and mem-
017 to speculate on things I didn’t know
enough about. It deceived me when I con­
centrated or “tried”. It never deceived me
when I didn’t try. and didn’t care, and
had a “feeling" first which started my
imagination going to piece together in a
flash what was aroused from my memory
by the feeling. What was the Feeling?
9.
I stress this, because as time went on
people who knew more about such things
than I would say, “The l»y is psychic”,
- 21-
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
or “He is clairvoyant”. “It must be tele­
pathy or psychometry”, etcetera.
And I knew they were all wrong, I
possess no special, mystic or occult sense
that other men do not possess. My mental
operations are limited entirely to what I
have acquired and recorded by sensory
experience. My imagination has only my
own memory to draw on. I visualize
something spontaneously, past, present
or future, near or far; it proves correct,
with witnesses to verify it. My records
contain thousands of such witnessed
cases in which I was correct 98 percent
of the time. What did I “see” ? Nothing
hut a composite of my own memory ele­
ments of past experience.
Truly and literally it was “nothing
lmt my imagination”. Still it corresjxmded
with the truth. W hy? Was it a good
guess? Was it “coincidence” ? Was it
“chance” ? These were questions to be
answered by experimental research. At
- 22-

first I did not know. But time ruled out
“chance" beyond all dispute. And I did
soon find out that man’s most important
thinking does not take place in the brain
alone, but with the entire body and ner­
vous system.
Truth is not to be found in man's
memory of words or his reflective visual
or oral thinking. Words and memories of
sights and sounds may be woven together
into endless combinations. What gives
them meaning? What determines the ex­
act words or memory-elements that will
be combined in any given concept or idea
or train of thought? What assurance have
we that our ideas have any correspon­
dence with reality at all?
Our only assurance from a scientific
point of view is one based on experience,
observation and experiment. How then is
it possible to know things in the future,
at a distance in the present and in the
past, without opportunity for experience.
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D

G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
observation or experiment? I can only
say that I have established this fact for
myself; that I am writing this commen­
tary on my early experience to introduce
you to what I did and how I did it, so
you too may establish the facts for your­
self, without taking anyone’s word for it; ®
mine or that of anyone else.
It requires not the use of some mys­
terious faculty you do not possess, but
rather the suspension of the use of your
“intellect” (verbal memory, reason, etc.) £
until after your feeling of intuition has
clothed itself imaginatively. Then harness
it by “logic and reason”, by all means, if
you can. But you must first learn how to
stop thinking at will. You must learn how
to "deconcentrate” instead of concen- ^
trating. You must make no strenuous “ef­
fort”. You can’t “force” it. You can’t
“play” with it. You can’t “practice” it.
Spontaneity is its most essential charac­
teristic. It cannot masiiiest in the realm

of habit or “conditioned reflexes", as ill
the case of instinct.
In the language of the New Testa­
ment, you must not try to move the spirit;
you must let the spirit move you. This
means that you must let the truth shape
you, for the simple reason that you can­
not shape the truth. Your relation to
truth is direct, and not by reflective or
verbal representation. You will find the
truth neither in words nor in memories,
but only in direct nervous coordination
of the whole of your immediate sensory
experience, internal as well as external.
Just as the law of crystallization and
chemical combination in the mineral king­
dom and the inorganic world, so also the
law of selective absorption in the organic
world and vegetable kingdom, preserving
the species, materializing the truth and
meaning of the seed. And so also the se­
lective excitation and conditioning of re­
flexes in the formation and operation of
-25-
instinct in the animal kingdom. And there
is evidence that a similar law is at work
in a more complicated system of self-
conditioning reflexes as manifest in the
vastly superior nervous organization of
man: a mechanism of adaptation not only
to so-called seen or visible environments,
but also to "unseen" environments such
as those manifest in radiant energy and
the specifications of future growth as
manifest in seeds.
10.
All I knew as a child was that I had
.some sort of relation with what I could
neither see, hear, smell, taste nor touch:
and that relation was a “feeling".
But I found that “thinking" and “im­
agining" first, created a false feeling that
lied to me. It was only when the feeling
came first, without thinking, that the
feeling was right. And my thoughts and
imaginations were right only if they were
- 26-
m

induced by the feeling, and not by asso­
ciation of thought resulting from what I
saw or heard. Sometimes there was no­
thing in my experience to fit the feelings
that came to me. Often I could not under­
stand them at all in terms of words or
ideas familiar to me. Still I "knew” ; but
1 couldn’t explain it.
I feel it necessary for the sake of the
intellect of those who have had no such
experiences to explain thus at length the
view from which my own are regarded.
None were regarded as occult or mystic
in nature; none involved mysterious un­
known senses, nor were they “extra­
sensory” or “super-sensory”. Man's re­
lation with his environments, the uni­
verse, the rest of mankind, Deity, or
forms of energy or life beyond his pre­
sent understanding is regarded as a phys­
iological, neurological, sensory relation.
No responsive or imaginative activity is
regarded as possible without a nervous

-27-
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
organization with a physiological foun- *
elation. And I have established to ray own
satisfaction by experiment that if I ap­
parently “see" a vision or dream a dream
that proves to be prophetic, there is no
so-called “faculty” of prevision, or “sec­
ond sight"’’. The "Third Eye” employed ♦>
in such experiences is nothing more nor
less than the “imagination” that every
man. woman and child exercises to a
greater or lesser degree. This “Mind's
Eye” of imagination has never, does not.
cannot and never will “see” anything |>
outside of one’s own physiological organ­
ization. Its sensations are entirely “mem­
ory sensations”. It is strictly limited to
the momentary and fragmentary revival
of past experiences as recorded in mem­
ory. Its one and essential power which ^
distinguishes the complicated nervous
organization of man from the more
simple one of the animal, is the power of
recombination by means of which the
imagination can make new creations out
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
# of the memory-elements of old experi­
ences.
Thus we symbolize; we indulge in
fantasy; we speculate and theorize; we
create works of a rt; we invent; and thus
we produce a culture and a civilization.
0) But as we thus change environments, we
change our “destiny”, and we change the
character of adaptation which operates in
the law of the survival of the fit. It be­
comes necessary to “imagine” correctly.
It becomes necessary to adapt oneself to
f) more subtle and more complicated en­
vironments. It becomes necessary to de­
velop foresight, a knowledge of conse­
quences; to plan, to prepare, to prevent.
We find that only those who do this sur­
vive.

So now we have a law of the sur­
vival of the intuitively fit. But intuition
needs to be redefined, or we shall have
-29-
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
to find a new word for it.
Possibly there was a time when brute
strength survived, but it soon became ev­
ident that a less strong and more sensi­
tive nervous organism better adapted it­
self to environments in the survival of
the instinctively fit.
With the appearance of man there
was a new element: intelligence. Neither
brute strength nor instinct could cope
with it. The intellect that could make a
trap, dig a pitfall for mastadons, and in­
vent a gun soon became king of the
earth.
And then what, as men fight each
other as well as the elements of nature,
to say nothing of man’s own creations
which break his bones and blast him from
the face of the earth? Do the strong
battle and kill themselves off so that the
meek shall inherit the earth?
Man now finds other titan himself
to battle. He builds cities, and the earth
-30-
VI
trembles, opens great jaws and swallows
them up. Volcanoes belch forth and bury
them. Winds blow and lay them low. The
rain falls and great floods sweep all be­
fore them. Lightning strikes and burns
his structures to the ground. He builds
ships and they sink at sea. He makes
fast moving engines and dashes to de­
struction. He digs in the bowels of the
earth for its riches and is buried alive.
The sun dries up his crops and he per­
ishes in famine. Pestilence breaks out
and leaves a city of dead to lie buried un­
known by the sands of ten thousand
years which he later digs up to decipher
its records. And ever and anon, as the
heating pulse of an eternal War-drum,
he goes to battle again, with ever in­
creasing cunning in horrible devices with
which to slay —Himself.
It is the last cycle; the final “Sur­
vival”. And is it the strong who survive?
Is it the cunning? Is it the meek? Is it
- 31-
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
the tyrant? Is it the selfish and arrogant?
It is not. It is they who feel the “Feel­
ing” and act on it. It is they who had a
“hunch” not to buy tickets on the ship
that was going to sink. It is they who did
not build a city where Vesuvius would
belch forth its lava and flames. It is they
who do not buy or build a house below
the future flood-crest of a river. It is
they who packed their belongings and
left the day before an earthquake shat­
tered their home. It is they who do these
things without even thinking "Why".
What is the “Feeling”? If we waited
to use it until we knew what it was, we
would be like the farmer who still uses
kerosene lamps because he doesn’t intend
to use electricity until he knows what it
is. The wren does not know why it flies
South; hut it flies, and thus escapes cold
and starvation. An animal ol>eys a '“feel­
ing" directly, without translating it into
words or thoughts of visual (imagina-
-32-
tive) representation. Man has so far lost
his neural relation with reality (by having
substituted a world of words and sym­
bolic representations) that he regards as
abnormal those who retain it or regain
it. He invests it with an air of mystery,
and represents it by misleading words of
special vocabularies, mystic, occult, theo-
sophical, theological, psychological, psy­
chic.
12.
The mystery is no longer in the phys­
iological and nei-vous organization of man
—not any more than in the construction
of the Geiger counter. The mystery is in
the so-called Cosmic Rays that act on
the Geiger Counter. What are they, and
where are they from? The mystery is in
the source of Energy or Life that acts on
the nervous organization of man to pro­
duce the “Feeling”. What is it, and where
is it from? There need be no other mys-
-33-
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
tery. The organism upon which it acts
is now fairly well known. New ductless
glands will he discovered. Many func­
tions and operations will be better under­
stood. But in all its essentials the phys­
iological foundation and nervous organ­
ization is well enough understood, in the
light of developments in the field of elec­
tronics and radiant energy, to know that
man is capable of experiencing “feelings”
(independent of sight, hearing, smelling,
tasting, touching) whicli emanate from
sources known or unknown. Heat is but
an obvious example, as well as electrical
conditions of the atmosphere.
Beyond this coordinated sensitivity of
the entire nervous system no further or
special sense is required. It is superfluous
and absurd to postulate mysterious powers
of vision, clairvoyance, clairaudience,
“psychic abilities”, etcetera, when the
normal powers and inodus operandi of
of imagination and memory not only suf-

fice in explanation but may be investi­
gated experimentally to establish the fact
that one’s so-called psychic faculties are
entirely limited constituents to the con­
tents of the individual memory, just as
the constituents of words are limited to
® the alphabet employed, and my verbal
representation is limited to my vocabu­
lary, (i.e. my verbal memory) unless I
pause to look up or coin a word for an
idea that has not yet been incorporated
in my verbal organization.
And yet I have had words come to
mind and pass over my tongue in experi­
mental conditions, words entirely unfa­
miliar to me. words in foreign languages,
or technical terms that could he found in

taining information which I did not my­
self know, and which was verified as cor­
rect. I used familiar syllables, however.
I used the familiar alphabet. And even
where I inscribed hieroglyphics entirely
* -35-
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
unfamiliar to me, it was a composition
of familiar smaller elements of lines and
curves, shapes and angles. The fact still
remains that my vision of these things
cannot correctly he described in terms so
vastly misleading and misunderstood as
"psychic”, telepathic, etcetera. It was
nothing whatsoever but imagination com­
positing familiar elements of previous
sensory experience recorded in memory.
I see and correctly describe a scene
ten thousand miles away; (I have done
this under experimental conditions as re­
corded in my files). I see and describe
a future event which occurs exactly as
I described it, with only minor variations.
What is lacking or faulty in my descrip­
tion is lacking in my memory. For what
do I see? Nothing but my own imagina­
tion. Actually I do not see ten thousand
miles away with any form of "vision”
whatsoever. I do not ‘see” the future..
My reception or perception of these

“ things is entirely formless, entirely a
“Feeling”, entirely devoid of image,
word, thought or concept. What makes it
intelligible to myself or someone else is
the activity of my imagination which en­
deavors to symbolize, portray or inter-
• pret the “Feeling”.
And what is the “Feeling” ? That is
the one great Mystery. That is the Quest.
That is the source of all Inspiration, the
Fountain-head of all spiritual gifts, the
heart and life of all Religion. This is the
• foundation that science has provided for
spiritual understanding: a physiological
foundation for a nervous organization
that responds to an unknown source or
sources of energy in the form of “feel­
ings". These feelings are neurological
• and physiological; not the activity of a
special or occult “sense”, but the coor­
dinated activity of the entire nervous or­
ganization. The reaction is one of selec­
tive stimulation of previously experienced
and conditioned reflex arcs of memory.
+ -37-
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
The imagination interprets the “feeling”
in terms of memories associated with
similar feelings. Thus a complex feeling
is broken down into its elements by sym­
bolic representation in an imaginative
composite of memory elements. Thereby
we “understand” it.
13.
With this explanation we may hope
to contribute to a better understanding
of mental phenomena stripped of the de­
ceiving terminology of generations of
“psychic racketeering”. Man's “All-see­
ing Eye” is his imagination, and his im­
agination sees not beyond his own nerve-
ends. Tt sees only the “past”, that has
been recorded in memory. Still by this
means he may j>ortray what has not yet
been recorded (i.e. the future); he may
"see” around the world; and he may ex­
plore the past before his birth in the his­
tory of the human race. And why? Be-
-38-
cause his quivering nerves are open to
the universe and susceptible to innumer­
able Feelings. The feelings stimulate and
thus clothe themselves in reawakened
memory-sensations.
Thus we do not see the past, present
or future beyond the range of our senses
but we “imagine” it. And if our “feeling”
is genuine, our imagination is “true”.
Can there he a “false feeling"? Yes,
when it is merely the echo of a past feel­
ing aroused by suggestion, association of
thought, memory of words: i.e. intellect­
ual activity in general. The “Feeling from
Outside” can bring you information of
a phenomenal nature only when you are
able to suspend all internal activity of
thought. The “Feeling” must have an
empty slate to write on. It must be allowed
to select your memories, to shape them in
your imagination, to choose its own
words. The result will be instantaneous;
and until you understand the language of
-39-
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
Feeling, you may not be able to distin­
guish such formations from your own
thoughts. Or. on the other hand, the ex­
perience may be so pronounced that you
will think you see a “vision”, a “spirit”
or a “ghost”.
You may feel indignant if others call
it an hallucination or “imagination”, but
that is exactly what it is; nothing more.
Still, it may be a genuine experience, and
the “vision” may he true in every detail
within the capacity of your memory to
provide the necessary elements.
To help you understand how this can
he, and to help you to distinguish between
false and true, the wrong and right use
of the imagination, the false echo from
the genuine Feeling, I have taken these
pains both to record and to comment on
my own personal adventures and research
along these lines.
-40-

Not everything is easy to explain, but
we must avoid attaching the “mystery”
to the wrong place. Within all seeds is
the “ design” of what they will become by
growth and development. The creative
• power exists in the unrecorded. What
has been recorded is already “dead”. Thus
the creative and progressive power in
man necessarily manifests as a prophetic
power, active in determining what he
shall l>e, and not what he has been.
® What has been inherited or already
determined as a conditioned reflex, is of
the past. But that which selects or chooses
as in the power of selective absorption
of a seed, or the power of selective stim­
ulation in physiological man, is of the
• “future” in a function of “time” which
exists solely as a biological phenomena
of succession in growth.
Thus there are innumerable sources
of prophetic “ feeling” in man which need
-41-
9
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
not be the occasion of any “mystery”.
In ottr very careless and Inadequate ver­
bal organization we speak of •wishes,
wants, desires, appetites, hunger; of am­
bition, aspiration, ideals; hope, anticipa­
tion. expectations, faith, and so on. These
terms are neither clearly understood, de­
fined nor differentiated; and means lias
not been provided to distinguish between
those sources of prophetic feeling which
are inherent to the structure of our phys­
iological organization, as in the case of
animals whose cycle of progressive ac­
tivity repeats itself each generation, and
those sources of prophetic feeling which
are not inherent to the individual phys­
iological structure but which manifest in
human progress which repeats itself in
cycles extending through several genera­
tions.
To the latter we must attach the “mys­
tery ’. Self-preservation is not a remark­
able phenomena, but race-preservation is.
-42-
C A T E S O F T H E M I N D
The man who will fight to preserve him­
self or his family is not a particularly
interesting object of study, but the man
who will live his life and give his life
for the sake of mankind and human prog­
ress is manifesting the Mystery that is
^ the Religion of Mankind. IVhat is the
source of his “Feelings"f
15.
But to return to my own experiences,
I have found that whereas "memory” is
9 not inherited, (i.e., it is not possible to
“remember” before we were bom in
terms of our ability to recall our own
sensory experience since birth), we do
nevertheless inherit enough of our par­
ents, and through them of past ancestors,
9 to manifest a “feeling” that is capable of
arousing parallel memories in our own
experience. And thus our imagination
may approximate some condition or mem­
ory of a parent or ancestor before our
birth.

I make tliis statement on the basis
of considerable evidence. Often, however,
there is a composite of dements derived
from both father and mother, so that the
feeling is complex and the resulting im­
agination a mixture.
Just what caused my mother to dream
prophetic dreams while bearing me, and
not any of the other children, is some­
thing that I do not even attempt to ex­
plain. What caused me to dream at the
age of seven, going on eight, on a night
when I was “reborn” by a distinct psy­
chological change, a dream similar to one
my mother dreamed the night I was born
one month too soon: that again is some­
thing I cannot explain at this stage of
the record. And why we both should 4)'
have dreamed that Herman was hanging
on the wall, nailed there as if he had been
crucified, might possibly be considered
a coincidence, in view of the fact that
hie symbolism is not unusual in a Catho-

lie family; and if we consider crucifix­
ion to be a symbol of suffering it could
certainly apply to poor Herman, a crip­
pled boy from birth.
Nevertheless I can swear that under
the circumstances neither mother nor I
breathed a word to Herman about that
dream; nor did we tell anyone else on
account of father’s attitude toward such
things.
We could not regard the dream as
prophetic in a literal sense, since it would
be absurd to think that Herman would
ever really be found hanging on the wall.
At most we could regard it as symbolic,
and at worst, as symbolic of death. But
Herman was with us still; so, as mother
said, that was the one dream of a series
that had not come true, and it liad upset
her so much at the time that I was pre­
cipitated into the world in a premature
birth.
Therefore our feelings can be im-
-45-
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
agined when Herman called mother one
day, after a spell of suffering, and said,
“Mother, hang me on the wall here!”
Shocked, and thinking he was perhaps
delerious, she asked, "And why should
I do that?’' •
He answered, “Because I want to die
like Christ died.’’
Mother said, “But you are not going
to die, Herman 1 Don’t talk that way.’’
He answered, “Yes, I am, mother."
She put her arm about him, and they
prayed together.
Then Herman cried himself to sleep.
He never woke up again. tfr

So Herman died just when I felt that
I needed him most.
Now I was the only boy; I had no bro­
ther; and I was indeed alone in the world.
For my father was working all day at the
large paper mill; my mother was kept
busy; the girls had their own interests.
I was sent to a Catholic school; but out­
side of school, had to shift for myself.
And now I made some discoveries;
first, that Herman was not “dead".
How did I know? I could not see him,
nor could I hear his voice. But I very
definitely “felt” his presence. And then,
of course, I could imagine him by remem­
bering him; and in my imagination I
could carry on a conversation with him.
Was this really Herman, or only my
imagination ? Well, in the first place, what'
-47-
is the difference between the first sense-
impression, and the recalling of that
sense-impression as a memory?
When the reflection of light from
Herman which affected my optic nerves
affected instead the silver emulsion of a
photographic film, we look at the result
and say, “That's Herman
I recall the image of Herman in my
memory and say to myself, “It’s Her­
man.''
Certainly I know that it is only my
memory, and only my imagination. But
then I think, “Well, anyway, Herman is
still alive in my mind."
It was that way when Herman was
still alive; when I was off somewhere and
he was home. I could remember him then
too. But now this was different, because
there was a “Feeling". And somehow
Herman, or the thought of Herman,
seemed to be able to put a life into my
-48-
memory and make me imagine things I
never imagined before, all through that
feeling.
The first time 1 felt it was a few days
after Herman was buried. The feeling
came first, and then I thought of Her­
man.
1 imagined him saying, “Well, Joey,
I’m still here in your memory, anyway.”
I thought, “Now you won’t have to
stay home all the time, Herman. You can
play with me.”
And then in my imagination, my mem­
ory of Herman said, “Then don't remem­
ber me this way, Joey! I’m not crippled
any more."
It was then that I realized I was re­
membering Herman just like he was when
I saw him last. So I changed everything
except his face and his eyes and my mem­
ory of his voice. Limb by limb I took my
memory of Herman and made it over in
my imagination, until it could run around
-49-
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
like I did. *'
And then I was so thrilled by the dif­
ference that tears came to my eyes. The
feeling became so strong that it burst out
of my mouth, and I said, “Thanks!”
Then something struck me funny, and »
1 said, “Herman, was that me thanking
you, or you thanking me?”
Suddenly a joyous feeling filled me,
and I laughed with it.
I ran out to play and imagined Her- ^
man running out with me. I began to
show him all the things he hadn’t been
able to see or do when he was crippled.
It did not occur to me to regard it
as anything other than a pure imagination
on my part. I did not think Herman's $>
"spirit” was running around with me.
I had always carried on conversations in
my mind; and now for awhile, instead of
talking with myself, I talked with a re­
constructed memory of Herman in my
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
imagination. The fact that my imaginary
and reconstructed brother occasionally
said things in my imagination which I did
not knowingly put into his mouth was a
fact that passed unnoticed hy me at the
time. I took it for granted as something
^ quite to be expected.
For example, I would go to the woods,
and I would imagine Herman saying,
"Well, Joey, we haven't seen any Indians
yet.”
^ And this would remind me that my
chief anticipation on leaving Montabaur
for the new world was the prospect of
Indians. There was first a long coach
ride. It was night, and I was the only one
of all the passengers who stayed awake.
41 1 imagined Indians stopping the horses
and saying that they would kill me if I
made a sound or woke the rest up.
I thought, “But vou were asleep. Her­
man.''
And my imagination of Herman
• -51-
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
answered, "Not when you were scalped,
Joey. That zvoke me up.’’
And then I laughed, because I had
forgotten that incident; but now I re­
membered that right while I was in the
thick of my imaginary Indians during the
coach ride, someone in the coach dropped
something which hit me on the head. So
vivid were my imaginings that for a mo­
ment I thought 1 had been scalped, and
woke Herman up with my war-whoop.

School made me nervous, sitting so
still. One day I began, to beat a rhythm
with my hands and feet. The teacher told
me to stop and asked me what I was
doing it for. 1 couldn’t answer her.
She said. "Well, if you can do a thing,
you can explain why you were doing it.
Now tell me !"
•Ml I could say was, “T don't know."

So she struck me over the knuckles
with a ruler and said, “Well, don’t do it
again, or this ruler will know a better
place to hit you."
I sat there stunned and humiliated,
with tears blinding my eyes. It was not
just the pain on the knuckles. It was
worse than that. I had not been long in
the school, and I had looked up with
admiration at the teacher. I had wanted
her to like me. and now she had struck
me
Needing some comfort. I imagined
Herman, and said in my mind, "Was that
right, Herman? Was it right for her to
hit me like that?”
I imagined Herman, saying. “Why
didn’t you tell her, Joey? Tell her why
you were doing that. Go after school and
tell her."
*Iiut I don’t know why.”
. '^'es. vou do. "
-53-
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
And then it came to me. On the way
to America we could not afford first
class passage, so we were near the engine
of the ship during the entire trip. For
seventeen days the rhythmic beat of the
engine pounded its way into my system,
so that whenever I became nervous or
restless my feet or fingers unconsciously
tapped out the rhythm of that monotonous
chugging of the ship’s engine.
Then I imagined Herman saying, “Do
vow remember how you tied a tin can to
a string and let it down over the side of
the ship, Joey?"
Then I thought, “Yes, I would draw
it up full of water sometimes. But one
day the water in the can was warm. And
then it was cold again. I wonder why that
was?”
The answer came, “Ask her. Ask the
teacher when you explain about beating
your hands and feet,"
And so I did. She was interested, and
-54-

r-

G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
* talked about it with someone else. Then
she told me that when the water I drew
up was warm, we were crossing the gulf
stream. She said she was sorry she had
struck my knuckles with the ruler, and
would not have done so if I had explained
♦ to her; but I wouldn’t answer her, and
that’s why she struck me.
3.
As time passed I took more and more
0 to wandering through the woods, studying
all living things in tny own way, speaking
to them and making believe that they
answered me.
f thought, “Everything could speak
if ive coaid only interpret it."
4) By this, even as a child, I did not
believe that animals and trees could speak
the English or any other language of
spoken words, or that they had human
qualities. (That would have been anthro­
pomorphic!) But I did believe that every-
-55-
<
1
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
thing- in nature had a “meaning”, like a
word in the Language of Nature; and
that this language which we see through
our eyes, hear through our ears, smell
through our nose, touch with our fingers
and taste with our tongues, was also the
language that was in my head when I
closed niy eyes and ears and “imagined”
things,
This was a language “without words”,
and this, T thought, was the one language
of all the world, the language of thought )
itself, in which all knowledge could be
expressed. T was forced to this language
£or my own understanding, moving from
a country where one language was spo­
ken. to a country where another language
was spoken. ^
So I looked at a tree and understood
it. I heard a sound and knew what made
it without looking to see. I smelled odors
in the woods, and knew what they came
from. And then I found that if l touched
-56- ^
)
something with my fingers, I could tell
whether anyone else had touched it before
me.
How did I know? It was a “feeling”.
And then I found that if 1 let that feeling
make me “imagine” things without think­
ing, I could describe who had touched it,
and other things connected with it in the
past. As time passed someone told me,
“Why that’s psychomctry. You are able
to psychometrize things.”
I answered, “But that's silly. It isn’t
anything but what I feel with my fingers.
And then I try to imagine what the feel­
ing means.”
And then they would say, “But you
described the whole scene exactly, where
this object came from. You must see it
in order to do that.”
But I didn't see it. I saw nothing but
my own imagination; nothing but bits
and fragments of my own past memories.
But what put them together correctly to
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
express the meaning of a •‘feeling” ?
What puts the letters of the alphabet
together to form words ? What puts words
together to form sentences of under­
standing?
No one could answer me. Nor could
I. AH I knew was that if I stroked a
tiling with my fingers until I felt that it
was a part of me, like my foot, I could
'■feel" it, just like my foot.
There is only one way my foot can
talk to me, and that is by a feeling. It
may be pleasant or unpleasant, hot or
cold; comfortable, tired or painful. My
own memory tells me why, and what it
means. I can't see my foot; it’s in my
shoe. I can’t see my foot even if it’s bare.
All I can see is the dead skin outside.
That’s all I can see of anything. All we
ever see is the dead skin of things. We
never see what anything really is. We
can only '“feel” it.
If people were going to insist on
-58-
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
calling that “seeing”, very well then. 1
could “see” better with the ends of my
fingers and with my eyes closed. Also I
could “hear” better that way.
To prove it, and to amuse my friends,
I would hold my hand high, finger-tips
in the direction of a distant railway en­
gine five miles away, that none of my
friends could hear or see. I would say,
“It's whistling, only you can’t hear it
now.” Then, “It's coming closer, closer
— now it’s going to whistle: one, two,
three—” and ivhoooo came the shriek of
the engine just after my third count.
“But how did you know?”
“I saw the engineer reach up to pull
the whistle.”
“But how did you see it ? We couldn't
even see the train yet.”
“With my fingers.”
“But you can't see with your fingers!”
“Of course not. But that’s what you
-59-
J
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
insist on calling it.”
‘‘But you must see it in your mind,
then. It’s second sight. It’s clairvoyance.”
“That’s just words. And what they
mean to you isn’t true. I don’t see that
train and that engineer at all. I’m just
imagining it. What I see in my mind is
a train I remember looking at one time
from close up. The engineer in my mind
is one that waved at me one time. Tliat
may be him, but I don’t think so and I
don’t know. It’s the engineer in my mem­
ory and not the engineer in the train
that starts reaching for the handle to
pull the whistle. When he starts reach­
ing I start counting. That’s all there is
to it.”
“But what makes the engineer in
your imagination start reaching at the
right time?”
“I don’t know.”
“Well, T don't understand it at all.

could do it too, but you don’t try.”
One time I said, “I’ll show you. Let
me put vour coat over your head. Hold
up your hand. A cloud is going to pass
over the sun. You tell me the minute it
does. Then after a few minutes tell me
when the sun breaks through again."
When this was done successfully I
asked, “How did you know?”
j “Because I could feel the warmth of
the sun on my skin. When it was cool I
knew the cloud had covered the sun.
When it was warm again I knew the
cloud had passed.”
“Well, what's strange about that? It
J was a feeling in your hand and you knew
what it meant.”
“But that's different.”
“No, it isn't different. Not in the way
you mean. Of course it’s different, hut
j

G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
it’s the same thing.”
‘‘What a way to talk! It’s the same
thing only different! That’s about as dear
as mud, Joey.”
So I stopped trying to explain things
for awhile. I didn’t know enough about
them myself.
4.
In school things didn’t go so well. Not
that it was hard for me, or that I got
poor marks. But they didn’t teach the
things I wanted to know about, and they
didn’t talk the language I understood best
What I wanted I couldn’t express or
explain at that time. My soul cried out
dumbly what others before me and after
me found words to say: ‘‘Give me the
things, not words about things. Give me
the thoughts, not words about thoughts.”
So I could not bring myself to study
then: and in a whole lifetime of research
-62-
m
>
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
I have never been able to study since; to
study things and nature, yes; but not
words and books.
Thirty years later I dreamed a dream
of being a school-boy again, kneeling in
a dusty comer asleep while the other
<
*
' pupils worked their heads off studying
the essential oils. When recess came, I
went out and had a fine time, but the
rest were too tired.
This was symbolic of my whole life.
. I have seen more lives blasted and stunt­
ed by brain-cramming than by utter ig­
norance. Hence I have always preachel
against tiring out the colt in practice be­
fore the hour set for the race.
Man’s worst enemy is his memory if
j he has misused it. It was never meant to
be a trunk into which to pack a lot of
words and opinions. It was meant to re­
cord experience as a sample-case an al­
phabet of nature’s language, like string­
ing a harp or piano, one string of each
, -63-
I tone. Then any melody in the world of
j music can be played on it. And even from
. a distance the vibration of anotner tone
will produce a vibration in my instrument
if I possess a string of like pitch to re­
spond to it. I do not need to see, hear,
smell, taste or touch it. The string in my
piano is going to vibrate if someone
strikes the same string on another piano
at a distance.
But the string of my piano is not
going to vibrate if I use the piano as a
trunk and pack it full of words. The
words are going to bang around on the
strings so I cannot hear anything else.
As long as I didn't learn from books;
as long as I kept my memory from re­
cording anything but direct experience,
experiment and observation; and as long
as I could seal off a part of my brain for
a vocabulary, but refrain from using it
in my thinking, then my thinking was not
confined to my head. I could think with
-64-
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
my whole body, with every nerve and
organ: then I would know the truth, for
they would not lie to me as men did, and
as books did, using words.
I wanted the truth to select its own
words, and not for men to try to shape
ideas of truth in my brain with their
words. This would not be true, and it
was impossible ever for it to be true; for
that is not what truth is.
Every argument that I ever heard
was because of someone trying to shape
the truth by words instead of allowing
the words to be shaped by truth.
Fervently and deeply I wanted the
truth, and I could see that none of the
teachers knew the truth; none of the
books told the truth. It was nothing but
words, and words about words. Brick by
brick, word by word, I saw the wall being
built around us children to seal us for
life into one room of our brain, with only
two windows, our eyes, safely guarded
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
with prison bars of words stronger than
steel that also kept out most of the light;
with every other gate of the mind care­
fully sealed by a word: so that no feeling
could be arrived at save through a word
first, like putting gloves on our hands,
shoes on our feet, spectacles on our eyes,
muffs on our ears and a woolen padding
on every nerve end so we would be cut off
from the quivering, life-giving pulsations
of direct contact with the truth,
So I revolted; tore down the wall of
words; threw off my shoes, both physi­
cally and mentally, and walked barefoot
even where the stones were sharp and
painful.
I went out alone in rain and thunder
storms, praying to God to let me feel the
truth that no one could tell me in words.
I promised that if He could make me
“feel" the right things to do. I would
- 66-
*)
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
' always obey those feelings, instead of
what other people told me to do when
one person said one thing, and another
said another.
When I got out alone like this, a
strange feeling would sometimes come
over me. When it did, then as far as I
could see, everything instead of being
outside of my head, seemed to l>e inside
my head.
Looking out over a marsh where the
^ frogs were croaking, I would hear them
as if they were inside my head. They
seemed to he a part of me, and I would
amuse myself by pointing in a certain
direction, saying, “One, two, three, —
now!” —and a big bull frog would croak
from where I pointed.
So far as the evidence of personal
experience is concerned, it does not an­
swer the question whether the seeming
ability to “cause” a frog to croak at will
was a real one, or whether I predicted
-67-
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
the croak.
This is merely illustrative. The prob­
lem comes up repeatedly in my records,
as this type of phenomena is now an es­
tablished fact with a sufficient number
of reliable witnesses, so that the solution
to this problem is one of the most funda­
mental considerations in the fields of
science, philosophy aud religion. To what
extent does the mind “make” things hap­
pen, and to what extent does the mind
foresee what is going to happen? Does
the mind create thought, or is it acted
upon by thought?
Has man deceived himself by extend­
ing his conception of biological time be­
yond the sphere of its function in nature?
Does cause precede or follow effect?
Have we perhaps gotten the cart before
the horse in thinking that the cause comes
first because of our manner of recording
biological time in a reflective function of
memory where things are naturally re-

versed as in a mirror or any other phe­
nomena of reflection? How is it, for ex­
ample, that in dreams the sound that
causes a dream wakes you up, and that
the dream precedes the sound that has
“caused” it ?
' 6.
Then, again, here is an acorn. Over­
head I see the oak tree from which it fell.
I know that if I plant it, it will grow into
j another oak tree; and if I gather all the
acorns from that, I can prove that within
my hand at this moment I hold the means
to produce a whole forest of oak trees.
The past is “outside”, over my head;
the acorn has left it forever. Yet in the
J same moment I imagine the future forest
of oak trees; and 1 know that at this very
minute, though the chemical constituents
of that oak tree of the future are in the
air I breathe and in the soil beneath my
feet, I know that the true cause of that
i -69-
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
future forest lies in the palm of my hand,
inside the seed (in the future of that
growth), and not in the tree overhead,
(its past), from which it has departed
forever.
The cause of a thing is an action or
a function, and not a position or sequence
in space or in biological time. The old
oak tree produced the acorn in my hand,
hut now the active cause of the future
oak tree is in that acorn as its own future
which becomes manifest by selective ab­
sorption in growth. The old oak tree is
cut off from any possible function as a
cause of growth in the new tree. The
power of creation is the future biologi­
cally. The past is the memory of the
body, the future is the memory of the
seed. My dream precedes the sound that
causes it, just as my backward is forward
in the mirror; for a dream is a reflex of
memory.
And likewise when by shock of emer-

gency ot will of intent and earnest de­
sire we suspend our logic and reason, and
revolt from our walls of words, then only
our raw nerves are exposed to nature;
we think with our spine, our hands, our
feet, our skin. What is outside of us is
now part of us, inside. We are in a waking
dream; we are conscious on the other
side of the fence; our actions precede
that which causes them.
I say, “One, two„ three —” and the
train whistles. I say, “One, two, three-”
and a Erog croaks. And one time, before
eleven witnesses who are all still living
as I write this, (this was later in life),
I said, in the midst of a storm, “Look at
that tree, if you want to see something.
Suppose I told you that I could make the
lightning strike that tree; would you be­
lieve me? Of course not. But watch it....
One....two....three... ”
And no one was more astonished than
I when a lx>It of lightning split the tree
-71-
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
before our eyes; for I was in a "waking
dream” at the time, having abandoned
myself to the spirit and enjoyment of the
storm. The lightning bolt broke my state
of contemplation, or whatever you may
choose to call i t ; hence I was astonished
at the fulfilment of what I had been only
half conscious of saying.
7.
This may sound incredible, but I as­
sure you that it is a fact of experience
before witnesses, and only one of sev­
eral thousand cases embodying the same
principle. None of my witnesses are of
a type to grant me power to cause a
particular tree to be split by lightning at
the third count of my finger. There are,
therefore, only a few other possible con­
clusions :
(1) That as in a dream, my speech
preceded the sound or event that caused
it; in which case, our conception of and
-72-
relation to “Time” needs deeper investi­
gation and perhaps drastic revision.
(2) That neither my speech nor the
event were the cause of the other, both
being the effect of a common cause; viz.
the power that caused the event also
called my attention to it, and through me
the attention of others before it hap­
pened.
Either (1) or (2) with variations
could be embodied in a theory of prophecy
or prevision. We could state another pos­
sibility,
(3) That the cause of my speech was
not the power that caused the event, but
rather a power in myself, or acting upon
myself, which could foresee the event
without any causal connection whatsoever.
Still further, (2) might be clarified
by limiting the “power” to a purely ma­
terial nature. For example, we say that
“instinct” causes muskrats to “hole in”
-73-
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
J
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
just before a storm; but reflex condi­
tioned by a change or degree of atmos­
pheric pressure associated with a conse­
quence would account for it.
Moreover, I have turned one of my
laboratories into a large electrical con­
denser. with an electronic ohmmeter con­
nected between a metallic roof and the
ground. The radiation resistance of this
portion of space started building up one
rainy day; and as the needle mounted
higher and higher, till it could record no
more, at one hundred million ohms, I
knew without any “mental phenomena”
that lightning was going to strike in the
vicinity. It struck within two minutes
after the capacity of the meter had been
reached . Who is to say that the human
nervous organization is not as sensitive
as one built by man’s hands?
Still, that would not account for pick­
ing the right tree. Nor did the meter tell
me what my nerves now did after the
-74-

V

G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
crash, when I asked, “Did anyone get
the horses in before it started to rain?”
My assistant said, “I don't know.
Why? Shall I go and find out?”
I said, “The bolt was so dose it made
^ me feel as if I were a horse. I imagined
a horse leaping into the air and falling
down dead.”
My assistant went back to the bam
and found that the horses were not in,
j, as the rain had come on so suddenly.
One of the other men was standing in the
barn looking out at the downpour that
followed the crash.
He said, “Yes, I know the horses
should have been brought in, but I was
^ just starting back to the pasture for them
when it started. I’m just waiting for it
to let up a little.”
So both went back to look for the
horses, and found two of them dead. One
of them had leaped a six foot fence and
> -75-
»
was several feet away without any tracks
leading there.
8.
In this case and others like it, I have
had delicate instruments in my laboratory,
in a temperature controlled room, which
correlated in their functions with outdoor
temperature and weather changes, but
slightly in advance of the outdoor effects.
It became evident that the instruments
were being acted upon at once by forces jy
which a little later, sometimes five to
twenty minutes, brought about the out­
door changes; thus enabling us to pre­
dict them by a small margin. Changes in
atmospheric and electrical conditions, for
example, preceded local meteorological ^
effects, as also atmospheric tidal effects
on temperature changes.
Thus it seems reasonable to believe
that the human nervous system might be
able to detect conditions on the same
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D

G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
basis. But this will not account for all the
phenomena observed. The imminence o£
a lightning bolt might be felt, but what
explains pointing to the tree it will strike,
and timing the flash to the second? What
explains the fact that when a real horse
leaped into the air and dropped dead, a
memory of a horse in my imagination
did likewise?
And if that which causes a frog to
croak can act more quickly upon my ner-
vous system when “attuned” to it. giving
me time to count “three” before the frog
Teacts, how does this work with the en­
gineer tooting his -whistle, or a man doing
what I say he is going to do without his
knowledge of the fact so that the power
of direct suggestion is eliminated? Did
I make him do it: did I foresee that he
was going to do it; or were we lx>th acted
upon by some unknown third factor which
caused me to predict the act, and the
other man to fulfill it?
i 77-
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
All that is established experimentally,
(and this I have done thousands of times
in the course of my research), is a re­
lation of sequence with respect to the
biological time of myself and my wit­
nesses, (1) I state what is going to hap­
pen. (2) It happens. Is (1) the cause of
(2)? Is (2) the cause if (1)? Are both
(1) and (2) the effect of a common
cause? Is the relation entirely fortuitous,
i.e. just a matter of “chance” or “coinci­
dence” ? Or is there some other explana­
tion.
For example, is it possible that our
conception of Causality is in error, and
that prevision does not imply Predesti­
nation; that prophecy and “free will”
are perfectly compatible if not identical,
in the sense that free will requires di­
mension in biological time?
If free will on the part of Deity or
man requires the setting in motion of
processes that require or constitute time,
-78- 9
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
1 the determination and the fulfillment of
free will will be separated by a time in­
terval which may vary from an instant
in which you ask your neighbor at table
to pass the butter, up to a lifetime that
( may be cut short if it is your “free will”
f to end it, or to violate the laws of health
in a slow suicide of neglect.
In any case the aim of the bullet can
be altered up to the moment the trigger
is pulled; hut once pulled, the bullet is on
> ) its way to a target that was not predes­
tined until the release of nature’s forces
beyond man’s control.
Since in every case free will does in­
volve a time interval, however short or
long, between its determination and its
& fulfillment, it is perfectly possible that
prophecy is based on immediate knowl­
edge or foreknowledge of the execution
of free will in a determination which thus
permits the manifestation of prophecy in
perfect harmony with free will. Yet this
> -79-
G A T E S O F T H E MI N' D
has been considered a philosophic and
theological difficulty of insurmountable
nature, whereas it is in nature and human
experience no difficulty at all.
The only difference between scienti­
fic and intuitive prediction is that in sci- C
D
ence the execution of an act of free will
is known by observation or intention, and
that in the case of intuition it is “sensed”
or “felt” ill a way no more “occult” or
mysterious than the function of an insect's
antennae, but in man by the coordinated il)
activity and sensitivity of his entire ner­
vous organization. And whereas science
is based on reflective analysis and com­
parison of sensory perceptions and mem­
ories of past sensory perceptions, intui­
tion is based on the automatic and syn- »>
thetic coordination of man's entire phys­
iological organization wherein by selec­
tive stimulation of reflex arcs (called
“memory”) a series of “feelings” is trans­
formed into an activity of imagination
-80- w
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
which constitutes understanding and pro­
vides a basis for responsive activity of
the motor or sympathetic nervous system.
9.
> If thoughts may be changed, environ­
ments may be changed. If environments
may be changed, destiny may be changed,
for there is a constant adaptation to en­
vironments. So “Destiny” may be altered
by one who knows the laws by which to
p, do so intelligently. This knowledge con­
stitutes “free will” and involves “moral
responsibility”. Not everyone acquires or
exercises it, hence the present condition
of the world today.
Most of us do what we do today be-
■J cause of the momentum of yesterday, or
by reaction to stimuli without exercising
the ability to resist or suppress that re­
action. Thus we are governed by past
and present, (i.e. memory and sensory
reaction), which perpetuates vicious cir-
v -81-
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
)
des, retards progress, and prolongs un-
.desirable conditions; whereas the exer­
cise of “free will” consists of and entirely
depends upon a consideration of and prep­
aration for “tomorrow”.
The present moment is too late to )
exercise this prerogative with any expec­
tation of altering the present moment.
We can alter our future in cooperation
with nature's laws, by considering be­
tween two possible courses of action and
choosing not merely the course of action )
leading to the “most desirable” result, but
the criterion by which we shall evaluate
that “desirability”.
The mistake many make is in consid­
ering the “will” and “desire” as simple
things. They are not simple but complex. ty
ft is possible to change the will by “will­
ing to will”, and to change a desire by
“desiring to desire”, (i.e., by changing
one’s criterion).
Man has two sources of desire and
-82-
V
will that are founded in two distinct phys­
iological systems of conditioned reflexes.
One of these he shares in common with
all animals; the other is distinctly the
endowment and distinguishing character­
istic of man. Neither of these two systems
is “free” insofar as the reflexes have
already been formed and conditioned.
The freedom which is denied to animals
and enjoyed by man is the power and the
necessity by reflection to create and mod­
ify the growth and development of fur­
ther reflex arcs, (i.e., to make or modify
tendencies, habits or hopes).
If we call this reflective and repre­
sentative ability “Intellect'', then this is
the seat and source and modus operandi
of individuality and free will. For the
intellect may lend its aid as a modifier
to either one of man's two sources of
will; or man’s two sources of will may
engage in conflict for the possession of
the intellect. The one is the will of ex-
-83-
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
jjerience, habit, instinct; the other, of the ^
selective development of latent possibil­
ities in the seed. One is the voice of the
past; the other of the future. Free Will
is the gift of Prophecy; and the gift of
Prophecy is Free Will.
The moment you lose hope and faith
your destiny is established, regardless of
your will, like a bullet shot from a rifle,
which cannot be turned from its course.
As long as your optimistic hand holds
Opportunity you govern “Fate” ; but if ,j
you drop it through doubt, carelessness
or pessimism, you are in the hand of
Fate’s “destiny”, not your own will.
Thus religion, as the guarantor of
hope and the guardiau of faith, is our
only organized insurance of freedom and O
free will. A whollv dogmatic and authori­
tarian religion, however, is a religion in
name only; a speculative system of be­
liefs, not an operative and phenomenal
function of faith.
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
-84- *J
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
Free Will is the power. What man
believes to be his “will” is but a dam for
the capture and use of this power. All is
right until he uses his willpower the
wrong way.
This is the power of the individual,
of governing the polarity of his desires
by commanding the animal propensities
or the spiritual sentiments. Thus he de­
termines which shall predominate, accord­
ing to whether he allows himself to re­
spond to instinct (past), or to he influ­
enced by intuition or inspiration (future).
Man’s only escape from this funda­
mental conflict of choice has been a dis­
astrous one for him: i.e., to reject both
instinct and intuition, thus confining him­
self to the independent operations of the
intellect, (i.e., to a world of reflective
and verba! representations).
Within this sphere of purely intellec­
tual activity, the truth is entirely irrele-
-85-
G A T E S O F T H E M I N P
vant with respect to the physiological and
psychological consequences of the reflec­
tive and representative activities of the
brain and nervous system. For the multi­
farious combinations of memory-sensa­
tions create states of mind and motivate
action without regard to their “truth"
or “falsity” with respect to any criteria
whatsoever.
Until we embody the physiological
laws of thought in a Logic capable of
correlating Language with Life, mere
philosophic speculation is barren and
without any probability of correspondence
with truth.
l / Our only practical physiological means
of insuring the corespondence of our im­
aginative activity with external conditions
is by the use of special sensory organs in
the acquisition of experience, the exer­
cise of immediate observation, and the
invention and application of apparatus in
experiments. This is science.

of insuring the correspondence of our im­
aginative activity with external or inter­
nal conditions beyond the capacity and
ability of our sensory organs to acquire

to be understood only by the selective
J stimulation of memory-elements in the
activity of imagination from which all
independent operations of the intellect
have been rigidly excluded.
This is the domain of religion, not as

The materialism of science and the
spiritualism of religion are each in them­
selves incapable of embracing the Whole
Man or the Whole Truth. It is only the

It was shortly after the time in my
boyhood when I revolted against the
school-room and turned to nature instead
for my lessons. I would play truant and
go off alone in a storm, talking back at
the thunder as if it were God speaking.
I would say, “If I call upon You,
and still fail to find the truth and the true
religion, it will not be my fault, because
we have been told, ‘Ask and ye shall re­
ceive; seek and ye slmll find; knock and
it shall be opened unto you’.”
I would say to myself, “If there is
such a thing as a Holy Spirit, let me feel
it. I don't want anyone to tell me about
it any more. All I ask is let me feel it
myself, and then I will know.”
I said this, not doubting, not asking
for “proof", but as a hungry child de­
manding food, not words alxmt food and
-89-
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
pictures of good things to eat.
When I thought this way, a tingle
would start in my spine that chilled me
from head to foot, and then a feeling
would go out to the end of every nerve
in my body as if my heart were pumping
warm wine instead of blood. I would feel
a glow all over.
I would say. “Thank You, God!” And
then the tears would come to my eyes
because I was happy. I never told any­
one about this. People wondered why I
was always happy, and always whistling
and singing; and this was Why.
That was in the Spring, and when
summer came I was sent to a farm to
work for a man who was kind to me.
I tended the cows every day, taking
them a long way out on a road where I
staked them to graze. This was the school
for me. I learned more doing this than
I had learned all year in school.
-90-
) When it was time to go lack to school
again I became so nervous and restless
that I was allowed to leave school and
work in a Spring Shop for a dollar and
twenty-five cents per week, to help my
parents.
> Thus I left school at the age of thir­
teen, and have never been inside of one
since, except later ini life as Moderator
and Director of local school boards.

* As for religion, I was absent from
churches as well as school rooms, and
for the same reason: I had found outside
in nature, and within myself, what they
did not or could not give me.
j I have in the course of my life inves­
tigated every religion known to man on
earth, past or present. I have enjoyed
close friendships with leaders and laymen
in all faiths; with priests, rabbis and
ministers of many denominations; and I
-91-
C A T E S O F T H E M I N D
j
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
must say that when I dug beneath the
words and the various intellectual repre­
sentations of doctrines and concepts, I
found the same fundamental, universal
Faith by which man sustains a relation
to his Creator and the Spirit of Truth
in a function of neural activity or con­
sciousness other than “Intellect”.
And when as a scientist I convinced
myself of the irrelevance of truth with
respect to the physiological and psycho­
logical consequences of the operations of
the intellect, a conclusion immediately
follows which dispenses with all argu­
ment. It does not make any difference
whether or not the doctrines, the con­
cepts and verbal representations are true,
so long as the physiological and psycho­
logical consequences are favorable to
man's spiritual progress: i.e., if they lead
the various types of intellect (to which
the various doctrines are helpful) to the
establishment of a relation with truth in

G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
y a function of faith that is more funda­
mental than belief: i.e., an operative, not
a speculative relation with the Creative
Reality of God, or Truth.
I have therefore devoted my life to
the experimental investigation and study
> of the scientific foundations of the spir­
itual verities that are of necessity and
by virtue of the essential unity of man­
kind in common with all religions as the
essence of a universal Christianity.
y Because I have found these spiritual
verities to be operative and not specu­
lative; and because in my own exper­
ience I have found that they operate in
mankind through a physiological function
of faith and not an intellectual function
of speculative belief, I urge the support
of all religions, with emphasis on the
Faith they have in common rather than
the doctrinal beliefs by which they differ,
and which a study of the history of re­
ligion and the history of mankind will
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
reveal to have been the necessary expres­
sions of intellectual variations to insure
the perpetuation of the more essential
elements of man’s physiological relation
with Truth through the non-intellectual
operations of a living, universal Faith.

At the age of fourteen. I went to Chi­
cago with my father. My mother and sis­
ter followed later. This was during the
World’s Fair, and my father was em­
ployed in connection with one of the ex­
hibits. Later my parents had a bakery
and a milk depot in the city. I got up
early every morning when it was still
dark to deliver milk.
By this time my father was a citizen
of the United States, and was employed
at the government appraisal store.
Not going to school, I always had
some time for myself outside of work.
I used it experimenting; and my mechan-
-94-
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
ical, electrical and chemical “inventions”
were a source of great bother and worry
to my mother who was afraid of fires
and explosions.
From time to time I secured work in
various trades, in search of different kinds
of experience. When I was fifteen I
worked for a company that made window
screens. Here I invented and constructed
a machine for stapling the screening onto
the frames.
> I used to dream of having a wonder­
ful shop, fitted out with every tool imag­
inable, so I could make things. I wanted
also a chemical and electrical research
laboratory and workshop. All of these
day-dreams materialized, though some of
j them many years later.

During this time I began to have ex­
periences with regard to which space here
permits the inclusion of only a few ex­
amples.
One time while working for the Hall
Safe & Lock Company, I was sent out
to dismantle the lock of a safe that had
been blown open by safe-breakers. I
placed a drift in position and raised my
hammer to strike it.
Now came the first experience in my
life in which something happened in my
arm which I could not account for as an
act of will or reflex to tny own thoughts.
With hammer in mid-air, something held
my hand so that I could not hit the drift.
The feeling was not as if some outside
force held my arm, but something inside
the muscles. They refused to make the
motion I had instructed them to do by
the impulse of my brain and the reflex
of habit. So I examined the lock to see
-96-
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
» >
b> J
l> V
»
•>
if perhaps I was hitting it in the wrong
place to accomplish what I had to do.
Satisfied that I was hitting it in the
right place, I raised my hammer again
but could not bring myself to strike the
drift. Then down my arm came the “feel­
ing” that there was something there I
shouldn’t hit. So I pulled the drift out
again; and behind it I found a dynamite
cartridge that had been placed there by
the safe-breakers, and that had not yet
been exploded.
This was the first of many similar
experiences. Again and again through­
out my life, I would have lost fingers,
hands, arms, legs and life itself were it
not for an- independent action of my
muscles in making a movement I did not
direct, or in refusing to make a movement
that I did direct.
What was it, within myself or in the
universe that had the power to move my
muscles without my own will, or to pre-
-97-
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
vent them from carrying out what I had
every reason to believe to be my will?
I did not know. All I could swear to was
that it happened not once or twice but
again and again; and at the age of seven­
ty it still happens — but always as a last
extremity. In later years I learned to . go
look for a feeling and to obey it in time
to direct my own course of prevention.
But failing in this, “something else’’ took
over; and as a result of it, in a long life
of activity, of travel, of driving various
kinds of vehicles, operating all kinds of q
}
machinery, I have never had a serious
accident, but innumerable narrow escapes,
all owing to some kind of purposive or
automatic reflex of self-preservation.
S.
Problem: What is it? I have friends,
bless them, who seem to think that such
questions are answered by muttering a
name.
-98-
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
I demonstrate to them the fact that
I can attract and repel a piece of steel
“at a distance” by means of another piece
of steel concealed in my hand.
I say, “There you behold an invisible
force. You can't see it, smell it, taste it,
hear it, or touch it. Yet I can cause that
piece of steel to roll away from me or
roll toward me at will. What is it?”
Secure behind their wall of words,
such people say, “Why any school hoy
knows what that is! It’s magnetism."
"Do you know what magnetism is?”
‘‘ft’s what you’re using to make that
piece of steel move.”
“But you don’t know what it is."
“Well, no. Does anybody?”
“That’s what I’m trying to find out.
Very few admit they don’t know until
I drive them to it. They solve all the
problems of the universe by means of
magic names.”
-99-
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
As long as things have names people ^
are satisfied. As long as they can mutter
a sound or draw signs on a blackboard,
or stir the sign and the sound up out of
their memory, that is all that is necessary.
Look around the world and hear the tor­
rent of mutterings like a perpetual hail g,
storm. See the rivers of ink flowing onto
tons and tons of paper. Man has built
ships for himself out of paper, and sails
out into the universe on a river of ink
blown by the breath of empty words.
Then when the ship of his illusions col- Q
&
lapses, he finds himself in total ignorance.
For now, without words he knows no­
thing; but had he not deceived himself,
lie might now. without words, have known
all.
Some of my friends do not like this ®
line of thought. “You can’t do without
words”, they argue, “You yourself speak
and write every day of your life. You
have written a newspaper column for
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
years, using perhaps four or five million
words. You can’t convey your thoughts
without naming things.”
To this I answer, “But I don’t think
in words, and I don’t think with the part
of my brain that remembers words. I'm
trying to break down the wall of words
that holds you prisoner, and unbar the
gates of your mind that words have
sealed shut. I’m trying to show you that
your fingers, your muscles, your spine,
and every organ and cell in your body
knows more than you do; and that there
is nothing more ignorant in the human
anatomy than an educated brain tliat has
barred every gate of the mind except
that associated with verbal reflex.
A man with such a brain is nothing
more than a piece of machinery; his
voice, but a phonograph record. It is be­
yond his comprehension (because he has
no comprehension; only fixed ideas, con-
cepts anchored to words) ; he cannot be-
- 101-
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
lieve because he cannot personally exper­
ience what it means to stretch out a quiv­
ering- antenna of nerves that pick up feel­
ings and transform them from electric
currents which stir up visual and verbal
memories and reactions, into the echoes of
a past, a living, or a future voice or
scene.”
6.
It is not the knowledge of the brain
which holds the hand from hitting a dy­
namite cartridge that can’t be seen, or
that causes one to hesitate and miss the
plane or train that is going to crash.
What is it? Are we going to “fix” it
with a name'
A name is nothing without a meaning;
a meaning is impossible without under­
standing; and an understanding is im­
possible merely on the basis of a chain-
reaction in our verbal memory. An under­
standing is possible only on the basis of
- 102-
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
' neural activity in direct response to the
object or subject of that understanding;
not merely a twitch in a brain cell which
awakens the memory of a few words,
hut the coordination of the entire phys­
iological and neurological organization.
^ How glibly the vocabularies of phil­
osophies and ideologies, of sciences and
theologies flow from the tongue! And
how many know anything? How many
really understand anything? Very few
can define the words they use; and when
they do, the words are dead.
We speak of hunches, intuition, pre­
sentiments, precognition, extrasensory
perception, inspiration, psychotnelry, spi­
ritualism, clairvoyance, telepathy, divina-
j tion, superstition, faith, the Holy Spirit,
Cod. All these words are used to talk
•'about” something. None of the words,
as defined and understood by anyone I
have ever talked with, adequately repre­
sent what they are talking about, because
x -103-
the words have not been coined by men
who know or understand adequately what
thej- are trying to name.
Public conception of the terms has
been deformed by the operation of “psy­
chic racketeers” who have capitalized on
the credulity and the hunger of the people
for truth, by deceiving them with tricks.
I have investigated these things and I
know all these tricks. One of the pur­
poses of this commentary is to attempt
to rescue the truth, and to restore under­
standing and faith in man’s God-given
spiritual gifts, so that “each may pro­
phesy, that each may be comforted” for
himself without being deceived by char­
latans and false prophets; and without
being dependent upon the self-assumed
authority of others for what he may seek
and find and feel and know for himself.

One day when I was walking down
the street I felt very blue and discouraged
without knowing why. This was unusual
for me, because I was ordinarily con­
tented and cheerful, if not happy, in those
days. This was a new feeling, and I could
see no reason for it. I did not know of
anything that would make me blue. I felt
that way all day, and I could not identify
or interpret the feeling. My imagination
was no help to me now.
That night my father asked me wliat
ailed me. I said I did not know. He in­
sisted that if I was unhappy there must
be a reason for it, and he wanted to know
what it was.
The moment he asked the question
the answer was there. It was something
about my father that made me feel un­
happy. Now my imagination had some­
thing to work on, but I didn't want to
tell him about it, because now in his
-105-
presence I felt and imagined that he was
going to die, and that was what made me
feel so upset and unhappy.
However, he forced me to tell him
that I was afraid he was going to die
suddenly; within two weeks. And then he
punished me for dabbling with such non­
sense, and said he thought I had gotten
over that sort of thing long ago.
For the moment my father convinced
me that I was wrong, because I hoped
I was wrong. So for the next few days
I tried to put it out of my mind. At least
I never spoke of it. But early in the
second week my father came down sud­
denly with a fever which developed into
typhoid pneumonia. At the end of two
weeks he was gone.
Overnight my boyhood was over. I
was now the only man of the family. I
went to work to help support my mother
and sister.

Shortly after my father’s death my
mother met friends who attended “Spir­
itualist'’ meetings. She accompanied them
one time, and told us at home of what
she had heard and seen. I could not be-
) ' lieve her, and was curious to find out
how much of it was true.
So I went to see this medium of
whom my mother and her friends were
speaking so enthusiastically, I was sorely
disappointed. Before the seance was over
I had detected and knew how all of the
tricks were done by which the public was
being deceived.
Here I do not wish to be misunder­
stood. The fact that I found one medium
j fraudulent was not grounds enough to
form a judgment that all mediums were
fraudulent But the fact that the first
medium I ever met was fraudulent is
sufficient to explain why I avoided all
seances on general principles until I made
-107-
J
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
up my mind to investigate and expose
the tricks for the sake of the truth which
did exist, and which I felt needed no
"stage-trimmings”.
Later on I met a number of very sin­
cere mediums whom I judged to be honest
but to some extent self-deceived. Also I
met a few who confessed their tricks, and
justified them by saying, “We use a trick
to make people believe a truth, because
the people cannot understand and will
not believe the truth without the trick."
I cannot here include details of my
later investigations along these lines, but
I must say that while my own personal
experience convinced me absolutely of
the truth of Immortality, the reality of
survival, the fact that death does not end
all, and the reality of a type of communi­
cation based on “Feeling” such as might
take place also between two living per­
sons who are attuned by bonds of love
and affection. I have yet to be convinced
- 108-

€)

Wj
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
of any form of “materialization”, trum­
pet blowing, slate-writing, spirit-photog­
raphy, etcetera. And at the time I am
speaking of, in the city of Chicago, this
is just about all that spiritism consisted
o f; and In every instance where I was a
witness I privately exposed the trick and
revealed how it was done. And I can
assure you it was not done by a “spirit”.
Yet at the same time I frequently
“ felt” the presence of my father; the
feeling revived a memory, and I could
imagine him walking along beside me.
T could “talk” with him by saying some­
thing and “imagining” what he might say
in return,.
If I had been willing to deceive my­
self as some mediums were, I could have
said, “I see my father, and he tells me so
and so.” But I did not see my father.
What I “saw” was a memory of my fa­
ther. He did not speak to me at all. The
words were out of my own verbal mem-
-109-
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
ory, and T put them into the mouth of *
the memory of my father in my imagina­
tion. Then how could I explain it when
the memory of my father in my imag­
ination told me things I did not myself
know, and that only my mother knew?
It all comes back to the “feeling” a- '*
1
gain. So far as I could see the only link
between the living and the dead, the seen
and the unseen, was a “feeling”, just as
the only link between two telegTaph oper­
ators is the current in the wires. The
dick that the receiver hears is not the 1
click that the sender hears. It is a dif­
ferent “click”. You do not hear the voice
of your friend over a telephone; what
you hear is a vibration in your receiver
which sounds like your friend's voice.
9.
Perhaps there do exist people who
think that the voices they hear in their
radio are the voices of the broadcasters
- 110-
a thousand miles away; but of course
that is not true. What we hear is the vi­
bration of a diaphram in the magnavox
and not the vibration of the larynx of the
person who is speaking.
And perhaps people who watch the
images on a television screen are really
under the illusion that they are seeing
the faces, forms and movements of the
players in the broadcasting studio; if so
they are deceiving themselves like the
mediums who think they “see” spirits
and “hear” voices.
You see nothing on a television screen
but the variations of intensity of a spot of
light which is moving with such great
rapidity that it creates the illusion of sus­
tained vision; and the distribution of
light-intensity throughout the field, being
determined by the reflection of light from
the players and scene in the studio, de­
ceives your optic nerves into believing
you “see" the players. But how is this
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
done from a distance, “without any
wires" and “through the air” ?
Answer that and you will have an
adequate explanation of all so-called men­
tal phenomena: with the sympathetic ner­
vous system as antenna, the imagination
as amplifier and television screen: and
what you see in your mind’s eye of im­
agination is nothing but the flickering
composite of your own memory elements.
Whether or not this “means” any­
thing more than your memory depends
entirely on whether you can turn the
switch in your nervous system which re­
verses the current so that the nervous
system is acting on the memory and not
the memory on the nervous system.
If the nervous system is acting on the
memory, then your “feeling” manifests
in imagination by selective stimulation of
memory-elements to form an “image” or
a succession of remembered sounds. Then
- 112-
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
>
?
J
J
just as a seed manifests what it contains
by selective absorption of chemical ele­
ments from the soil and air, so does a
thought or a “truth” or a “spirit”, or
whatever you prefer to call it, manifest
in a “feeling" which translates itself by
selective stimulation of memory elements
or motor elements, into imagination or
action.
At least this was my early under­
standing of the matter. At no time have
I ever had evidence that a “thought” or
a “spirit” could move anything other
than a human organism and nervous sys­
tem. At no time have I ever had evidence
that either a thought or a spirit could be
“seen” or photographed. At .no time have
1 ever "heard” a thought or a spirit. All
I can state from personal experience is
that whenever a feeling originates in my
nervous system without internal cause,
whenever I succeed at the same time in
eliminating all other influence, suspend-
-

l V
ing all other sensory reactions; i.e., when ®
I stop thinking independently and allow
my thought to be “shaped” by the feeling,
then what takes place in my imagination
(though it remains only imagination,
composited of my own |>ast memories)
nevertheless corresponds with some ex- 0
ternal reality or event,-past, present or
future, without any limitation in space
or time save the decided and very trouble­
some and insurmountable limitation of
what my memory contains to contribute
to the visualized representation which 0
is the foundation of my understanding.
10.
If this view disappoints any follower
of fraudulent spiritism, let him then take
comfort in the conclusion that though a ®
"spirit message” may not be a direct con­
tact of a loved one, neither is the voice
over the radio. But you recognize the
voice and understand its intimacy. Why
-114-
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
not the thought of a comforting mother
in the “Beyond” ?
Of course it’s nothing but your “imag­
ination”. But your imagination will tell
you the truth if you seek with a prayer,
(tuning in), and if you will stop thinking
with your brain and offer up every nerve
from the top of your head to the tips of
your fingers and toes, for inspiration.
What is inspiration? First it’s a “Feel­
ing”, and then the feeling paints a pic­
ture, sings a song, writes a book, or solves
a problem that changes the course of
history.
One medium said to me, “I realize all
that, but if I tell my people that I only
imagine what their deceased loved ones
are saying, will they believe me? No, I
have to work a trick, and pretend that the
spirit writes it on a slate directly. I can’t
admit that my finger does the writing.”
But to this view I could not agree.
The search for truth itself is far more
-115-
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
thrilling, more comforting and more prof­
itable here and forever than any imagined
thrill or advantage to be gained by decep­
tion or self-deception.
Nor could I feel that this was some­
thing to “dabble" with, like a plaything.
My friends would talk about books on the
subject, and tell me that I ought to read
this one or that one. But eveiy time I was
tempted to do so, a “feeling” would stop
me, just as I was stopped from hitting
the drift with my hammer when there
was a dynamite cartridge behind it and
I didn't know it.
The only book I was ever able to open
without this feeling was the Bible, and
there I found the whole subject covered
in the 12th chapter of the first epistle
to the Corinthians, “Concerning spirit­
ual gifts"; and the fourth chapter of
John: “Beloved, believe not every spirit
but try ihem ‘
whether they are of God,
- 116-
J
It
a
a
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
for many false prophets have gone forth
into the world.”
11.
So when ray mother and her friends
became interested in “table-tipping;" and
kindred phenomena, I didn't want any
part of it. Later I investigated various
forms of “automatic writing” and the
phenomena of hypnosis and self-hypnosis
to an extent which space does not permit
including in this record; and for reasons
given in that connection I did not feel it
advisable to experiment along those lines.
All hypnosis is fundamentally self­
hypnosis. No man has the power to hyp­
notize another against his will, if one
exerts that will. All that a “hypnotist” is
able to do is to contrive by psychological
tricks to secure the willingness and co­
operation of the subject. The “power” is
in the subject, not in the operator; and
the success of the operator depends large­
'l l 7-
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
ly upon securing the confidence, complete
trust or fear of the subject.
Ninety percent of the people in the
world today have spent the largest por­
tion of their lives in various stages of
self-hypnosis. The production of these
states of mind in the people has been the
objective of organized efforts on an in­
credible scale throughout the world. I
have witnessed two World Wars that
were directly due to states of self-hyp­
nosis induced in masses of people by the
organized efforts and propaganda of small
groups of men. We have lived to witness
the greatest psychological crime of all
history. War would be impossible if we
could break the spell of self-hypnosis
which holds the peoples of the world in
subjection to false ideas, ideologies, per­
sonalities and Words, in a state of hyp­
nosis produced by psychological tricks.
We must expose these psychological
tricks. But that is another story.

So many experiences I had when a
young man made me realize that the ready
response in my make-up was due to my
harp of experience, such as it was; and
that whatever confusion and error came
into the picture was due to what I lacked
in this respect. So I made deliberate ef­
forts to enlarge and perfect this instru­
ment of understanding. Each tool or in­
strument mastered, added so many more
strings, enabling me to give an opinion
based upon absolute knowledge. And as
T continued to add to this supply of
strings, I found a readier response within
myself when seeking knowledge by intui­
tion, or endeavoring to interpret knowl­
edge acquired only through the transfer-
rence of “feelings” from others, or from
sources unknown.
I would meet a stranger, for example,
and as an experiment attempt to describe
his father who would be totally unknown
-119-
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
to me; or some other person he might be '
thinking of. The correct description, of
course, is recorded in his mind; and if I
have registered one thousand faces in my
own memory, there will be one among
these that will now he recalled from my
memory by the “feeling’' I get from the >
stranger. This provides' me with an imag­
inative description as nearly as possible
like the one in his mind, but which I can
sense only in terms of facial character­
istics recorded In my own memory In con­
nection with faces I have seen. •
These things were thus afl clear to
me early in life, and I could demonstrate
them. But there was one thing that long
remained a question-mark in my mind ;
and that was the anatomy of prophetic ^
intuition. For in my own experience the
difference between past and future was
that I appeared to get the information
of the past as an inductive activity of my
mind, while in the case of prophetic in-
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
' tuition it seemed as if I were in the fu­
ture coming back, (deductive), and with
at a sort of reverential awe, a kind of
ecstasy as if just returning from a grand
concert, or a beautiful garden filled with
music, color and perfume: a peculiar
'} feeling akin to what I would imagine
is caused by opium or morphine, as nearly
as I could understand it. Once felt, it is
always craved. But whereas drugs des­
troy in reaction, this seemed to strength­
en, giving greater endurance, greater
-A power, greater precision and command to
all activity, both of body and mind. This
is the “Feeling”, (with a capital F).
13.
j There is a less pronounced sensation
involved in so-called thought-transfer-
rence. I say “so-called” since in reality
no thought, as we ordinarily consider
thought, is transferred at all. Any thought
that f experience originates in my own
- 121-
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
anatomy and not that of anyone else.
I can, however, lie caused to think a
thought similar to that which some one
else has thought, is thinking or will think;
and in the same manner whole masses
of people can be caused to think similar
or parallel thoughts.
There is only one way I know how to
describe to another who has not felt it.
the feeling which distinguishes a thought
thus induced, (i.e., thought-induction ra­
ther than thought-transferrence); and
that is to take him in a car along a street
he has never seen before. I cause him to
lose his sense of direction, and then ask
him to check up on his sense of orienta­
tion. I ask him to make himself believe
that he is going north, say toward his
home. Then I ask him to change the di­
rection mentally, and imagine himself
going south. He feels himself denying a
supposed fact, and acquires the new view­
point only after he has wiped his mental
- 122-

J
slate clean by an effort to eliminate his
previous thought or belief. In so doing
he experiences a mental “sensation" that
is akin to that experienced when a thought
is induced by the transfer of a feeling,
(not of a “thought").
The acceptance and recognition of
mental activity thus not self-originated
requires the voluntary or involuntary
elimination of previous or present self-
originated mental activity. In other terms
you must stop thinking in order to allow
thought to be “induced’’ from external
influences. But whether your mental ac­
tivity is the result of current direct from
your own batteries, or current induced
by the activity of your sympathetic ner­
vous system in response to external in­
fluences, it is nevertheless still your own
memory-elements that are stimulated to
constitute your “thought". Therefore the
term, “thought-transferrence" is a mis­
leading one, involving a conception that

is not in accordance with human exper­

As a young man I began to visit all
the various denominations of Churches in
the city, and to investigate all forms of
religious belief and worship.
There were many questions that I
wished to ask, but hesitated to state be­
cause I did not want to appear unduly
inquisitive. I soon discovered, however,
that if I asked these questions “mental­
ly”, (i.e., in my own mind without put­
ting them in words), I would receive the
answer in one way or another, during a
conversation or discourse of the minis­
ters or speakers.
I experimented with this for awhile,
without anyone knowing what I was do­
ing. I received such strange and direct

answers to my mental questions that I
was led to experiment in having others
ask silent questions of me
The procedure was to start a conver­
sation with the understanding that my
questioner was only to think his ques­
tions; to talk about anything he pleased,
but never to state the question he wished
answered. Afterward we would compare
notes; and I discovered that it was often
easier to answer these unspoken questions
than it was to answer questions put di­
rectly into words. Moreover, my answers
to nine out of every ten questions were
correct. What was functioning here?
In the first place, not knowing the
question, my part of the conversation was
spontaneous and without constraint or
concentration of effort as was the case
when faced with a direct question that
I was expected to answer in the same
direct manner.
In the second place, at no time did I
-125-
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
make an effort to discover what the ques­
tion was, either by questions on my part
or an effort to “sense” it or “read the
mind” of my questioner. I refrained from
this for the simple reason that when I
tried it, I was obliged to “think about it”,
and my best chance of success was not to
think about it at all.
Consequently I never knew when or
if I had answered the question until it
came time to compare notes as to the re­
sult. I would say or talk about whatever
popped up in my mind during the con­
versation. More often than not it was
something entirely foreign to the conver­
sation ; and consequently more often than
not I really didn’t know what I was talk­
ing about at all.
This was the origin of a deliberate
effort on my part to apply the principle
of “effortless thought without thinking”
on an experimental basis.

The result of these early experiments,
however, gradually got me deeper and
deeper into a situation from which I was
later able to extricate myself only by
drastic means of leaving the city and
seeking seclusion. Word got around all
too quickly that alt a person had to do
to get the answers to all their problems
and troubles was to have a little talk with
me.
At first I was glad enough to have
people come to me, without my having
to go to them, to carry on my experiment.
It gave me a chance to learn a lot about
human nature, human thinking and the
troubles and problems of the people at
large. Moreover it gave me a chance to
practice and further develop the rather
unusual art of “talking without thinking”.
Now, instead of being obliged to depend
entirely on “images”, I began to gain a
greater facility in drawing on “words"
-127-
in response to my “feelings”.
But the less fortunate side of this
experience, so far as I was concerned,
was that as many as one hundred people
per day, often more than that, would
come to the place where I lived. This be­
gan to consume all my strength and time
so that it was difficult to earn a liveli­
hood; and I would not “commercialize”
what I felt should be held “without mon­
ey and without price”. Further, many of
the people who came to me were poor
and in real need, with real trouble and
problems of life beyond their capacity to
solve them for themselves.
Also, the main requirement for my
success in helping them was a sensitive,
sympathetic attitude on my part, to which
I submitted to such extent that their
troubles were my troubles. I became
bound to them. I could not refuse them
what comfort it appeared that I could
give. And I shall never attempt to de-
- 128-
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
scribe what I suffered as a consequence
of this; sweating with them, shedding
tears with and for them; keeping my
nerves almost raw so that I would not
fail them; praying for help, if help could
be had from any "higher power” so that
'i> I could meet these demands.
From a casual experiment I was
plunged over my head into the midst of
human woes, with people by the hundreds
looking to me to relieve them from those
woes in a world where war had taken
toll again, and where charlatans had risen
by the score, of all types, to deceive then:.

And still further, advantage was taken
of me at every turn. Many came to me
,> out of curiosity alone. I had not then de­
veloped resistance to this, and did not like
to offend. So when business men came
to me with their troubles, I was often
drawn into considerations with regard to
which I was not prepared by experience
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
to understand the real issues involved.
For example, as the time drew near
for another presidential election in 1900,
William McKinley was nominated for
reelection on the republican ticket, with
Theodore Roosevelt, then governor of
New York, as vice president. William
Jennings Bryan was nominated for pres­
ident on the democratic ticket, and there
were a number of other minor parties,
each with a candidate for president.
For a reason I did not at first under­
stand the outcome of this election was
considered to be “crucial” by many busi­
ness men, officials of various corpora­
tions; and one in particular (within the
circle of my “friends and their friends”),
J.W.A. who was a member of the Board
of Trade in Chicago.
The subject came up continually in
conversations as the election drew near,
and for the first time in my experience
1 found myself being drawn outside of
-130-

j
j
purely personal considerations into the
whirlpool of national politics and affairs.
For the first time too I found myself
wondering about these things. For this
would be my first experience in voting
as a citizen of the United States. At the
time of McKinley’s first election in 1896
I had been only nineteen years old, and
it was only in 1898 that I attained my
majority of derivative citizenship due to
the naturalization of my father before
his death when I was a minor.
So now I took the matter of voting
seriously, and wanted to know whom to
vote for, and why. But the issues of the
election were confusing. From all I knew
previous to that time, they should have
depended largely on questions of principle
and policy in dealing with the colonial
possessions that were taken from Spain
in the Spanish-American war. There were
questions of believing in war or not be­
lieving in war, of the liberties and treat-
-131-
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
merit of peoples, of the principles of de­
mocracy, the spirit of the constitution of
the United States and American ideals
in general.
But now there was talk of a monetary
question again. That had been an issue in
the 1896 election. The democratic party
had sought to introduce a silver standard
and the republican party, taking a stand
for the gold standard, had won out. The
result of this election and subsequent leg­
islation should have settled the matter,
and everyone thought it was settled. Even
the democratic party were willing to re­
gard it as settled and concede iheir cause
as “lost". But Mr. Bryan, as the demo­
cratic nominee, insisted on raising the
issue again. As a result of this there was
an unexpected confusion in the minds of
those who took their responsibilities of
citizenship .seriously.
Many who favored Mr. Bryan’s views
against militarism and existing colonial
-132-
*>
n
n

G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
T policies; and who were also in favor of
his concept of a Christian Americanism,
could not, for practical and economic
reasons affecting- their private interests,
favor his proposal for a silver monetary
standard.
Many who felt it necessary to support
the republican view in regard to the gold
standard did not approve of what they
called “the greedy commercialism” which
dictated the Philippine policy of the re­
publican administration.
The result was that there were many
in both parties who could not wholly ap­
prove of either candidate. As a conse­
quence of this there was great appre­
hension in the commercial and industrial
j world with regard to the probable out­
come of the election. And into this confu­
sion of issues and uneasiness of spirit
I was drawn through the instrumentality
of friends and those who sought to take
advantage of my mental experiments.
What immunity I might have had
through a natural disinterest in politics
was weakened through my own concern
as to how I should vote in this, my first
election; though I had nothing personally
at stake no matter what the outcome might
be. In the first place I was aware that
this time because of the confusion of
issues many would not vote at all. I con­
sidered doing the same myself; but then
I reflected that it would not he a good
way to start my career as a citizen. I
asked myself the question, "‘Are the ma­
jority always rightf Do the people make
the best choice?”
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D

Suddenly I discovered that I wanted
to know who was going to be elected.
I had never asked myself such a question
before, as a mental experiment. But now
I did. E “blanked" my mind and turned
my imagination loose to catch the answer
-134-

from my “feeling”. The result was a men­
tal flash of a newspaper headline bearing
the name of McKinley and containing a
figure somewhat in excess of a half­
million majority. So I felt that while I
was in no position to judge the issues
on the little knowledge I then possessed,
I would assume that the majority were
right and vote for McKinley.
If that had been all, this book would
probably never have been written, and
the whole future course of my life and
thoughts would have been changed. But
it was not all. In the course of my con­
versation with a number of business men
including the above mentioned J.W.A.,
when they asked me questions concerning
the coming election, I forthwith answered
now what I had never been able to “feel''
in their presence: that I thought McKin­
ley would he elected by about a half-mil­
lion majority.
T do not recall any special reaction
-135-
to these conversations except in the case *
of J.W.A. Upon that occasion, however,
I experienced a phenomenon that was
new in my life. After predicting to him
the outcome of the forthcoming election
I became suddenly confused, and felt a
sense of panic and shock followed by *
such a feeling of depletion, shame and
dejection that I thought I was going to
be ill. I could not comprehend it. It was
as if a light in my heart and mind had
suddenly been extinguished, leaving me
in darkness. The “feeling” left me which *
I had come to regard as an ever-present
function, as much “mine” as my sense
of sight or hearing. From that moment I
was unable to “feel” or sense anything.
I could only reason things out. My intui­
tion had died a sudden death. Why?

I cannot hope to describe the feeling
of desolation that came over me. People
came to me with their troubles, and I
could only sympathize with them by com­
mon sense and reason. I walked the streets
so people would not find me home. I went
out alone at night under the stars to shed
tears where none could see me, and to
pray and sweat it out alone to find the
answer. Why? Why?
The election came and went. McKin­
ley won by a little over 800,000 majority.
I bought a copy of the paper with the
headlines I had “seen” in answer to my
mental query that had somehow betrayed
me. Then I found that Mr. J.W.A., as
a member of the Board of Trade, had
cashed in on my prediction to an extent
that netted him a profit of one hundred
and fifty thousand dollars or more.
What was the answer? As days went
into weeks, weeks into months, I was to
-137-
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
ask myself that question a thousand times
until I had written tire answer so deeply
that it was never to be forgotten.
There was only one answer, and I
couldn't squirm out of it, no matter how
I tried to reason it out. My eyes and ears
were mine to use or misuse at will. But
the “Feeling" was a gift that I was not
free to misuse without suffering the pen­
alty of losing it. Perhaps there was some
natural law I did not understand, and
which I had unknowingly violated. Per­
haps it was an operation of a “Spirit of
Truth" or Intelligence, such as the Bible
described.
In any case, whatever I had believed
as a child, whatever I might now assume
from a rational standpoint, coincident
with “coming of age" as an adult citizen
of these United States I was painfully
faced with the fact that my nervous sys­
tem had sustained a relationship with
some unknown “Source" of inspirational
-138-
»
*

G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
energy which operated only on conditions;
that I was still .largely ignorant of those
conditions; that as a child I had not been
expected to know those conditions; but
now as an adult I was responsible for
the violation of those conditions even
through the instrumentality of others.
Ignorance of the law appeared to be no
excuse.
The whole affair appeared to originate
in my conversation with J.W.A. What­
ever the fault, I was to blame, not he.
I did not receive one penny from him
as a result of his profits from my pre­
diction, yet I was paying the price for it.
And he never knew nor could he have
understood the price I [aid.
Other men had profited in one way
or another from the by-products of my
mental experiments; but not to this ex­
tent. Then why, in principle, make an
issue of this case? Was it because I had
given away without discrimination what
-139-
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
had been given me in private as an an­
swer to my own question asked for a
very different reason ?
6.
In any case, here I was with only
logic and reason left to me, forced to
conclusions against which my logic and
reason revolted. What I had regarded as
a physiological operation of my nervous
system, which involved “feelings” as tan­
gible as those of heat and cold and elec­
trical currents, had proven to depend
only in a secondary sense on the physio­
logical and nervous mechanism I pos­
sessed. Primarily it depended upon the
operation or cooperation of something
“Other than myself”, and I was under­
going a reluctant proof of this fact by
having the primary “current” shut off.
My prayers and tears and torture were
of no avail. I had to think my own
thoughts; the thrill of having them in-
-140-
duced by inspiration was mine no more.
It was then that I knew what made
charlatans and fraudulent spiritists, even
granting that they had possessed some
kind of gift. For if and when they lost it
for any reason at all, they were obliged
to go on by “pretending-”. Because they
commercialized it their livelihood de­
pended on it; and when it failed them
they substituted tricks.
It became evident to me that there
was some kind of spiritual ethics that
was not very well understood. So I made
up my mind that I would prepare myself
with a better foundation for making use
of intuition if I should ever succeed in
regaining what I had lost. And this in­
cluded insuring my own future freedom
and independence, with a means of liveli­
hood that would not be incompatible
with a continuation of my research,
though not dependent on it from a psy­
chological angle.
-141-
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
To this end I went to work at any
jobs I could find; spent all the money
I could spare on instruments and appa­
ratus, and all my spare time familiarizing
myself by experiment rather* than text
hooks with the principles of electricity,
chemistry and microscopy. I bought the
finest microscope that I could obtain at
that time; and because it was a better
one than any of my doctor friends pos­
sessed, I worked with them evenings in
return for specimen. Thus T started my
studies of biology and physiology, having
made up my mind that if the gates of my
mind were going to stay closed, I would
take up medicine and become a doctor.
But Tdid not fix my mind too strong­
ly on this thought, because I still had the
vision of workshops and research lab­
oratory where, if my intuition did not
fail me altogether, I would delve into
the mysteries of nature that constituted
the still unsolved problems of science,
-142-

£ and support this dream of pure research
by an occasional invention of a practical
kind.
Thus ended the first twenty-three
years of my life with the loss of the
‘'Feeling” that had led me through all,
J from childhood.
7.
Exactly one year to the day from the
time my "Feeling” left me it returned
again; just as if an electrical switch, long
disconnected, was again turned on.
What this exactitude of period might
mean I did not then know. It was as if I
had been sentenced to one year in "jail” ;
a jail with only two windows, my eyes;
and with all the other gates of my mind
barred shut. For though I could hear,
what I heard meant little. And though
I could still smell the odor of flowers in
spring, the experience stirred no response.
The flavor of food gave me no pleasure;
-143-
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
my appetite was gone. Things that I
touched were cool or warm, rough or
smooth, but I could not feel them a part
of me to interpret their hidden meanings
as I had done since chidhood. My imag­
ination and emotions which had previous­
ly been ever-active, sensitive to respond,
were during this year entirely dormant.
For the first time I felt the defi­
ciency of my education; for now that
which had been the source of my under­
standing was no longer active. I felt that
T knew nothing whatever about anything
at all. So I set out to learn what I could
while working for a living along with
thousands of others who were serving
“sentences’' longer and harder than mine
in the endless treadmill of the civilization
of a large city.
The story of tliat year would be su­
perfluous to this record. Suffice to say
that in that time I was reduced to the
humility of realizing that “in myself I

was nothing”, and that other men in them­
selves were nothing; that without inspi­
ration all men were nothing but electro­
chemical, biophysical mechanisms.
Then what was inspiration ? What was
the “current", and from whence, that
brought life to dormant nerves, vision
and understanding to the mind? I could
see that men did not realize. The blind
followed the blind, and none of them
knew.
8.
What made men great musicians,
great artists, poets, surgeons, scientists,
leaders, prophets? Was it the men them­
selves? What and whence the energy,
the enthusiasm, the ambition, the hope,
the faith, the vision that took the clay
of the earth, the body of an animal, and
raised up out of the mob a great and
lonely man?
And why did men flourish for a sea-
-145-
G A T E S O F T H E M 1 X D
son, rise up inspired and speak their piece
to thrill a nation, only to sink back to
the level of a beast again, with a glaze
over their eyes, a palsied hand, a pathet­
ic ghost of a once-great man?
Only now did I know the answer, in
the only way that one can ever know the
answer to anything, by a personal exper­
ience. My little light hadn't lit up a very
large area; it was the light of a boy, not
a leader. I was not a great musician,
artist, or anything else. Comparatively
few people even knew I existed. But my
light had gone out. And I could see in
the lives of other men that they too had
flashed a greater light than mine, but it
had gone out.
We were the wires and the bulb, the
machine and the motor; but without the
"Current” we were nothing but that. It
required a man plus "Something Else”.
Without the man, the "Something Else”
could not manifest. Without the man the
-146-
4
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
* “
'Something Else" would he without
hands, without voice, without strings to
play a melody. But conversely, without
that "Something Else" men are hut the
clay of the earth and go the way of all
flesh as a herd of educated human ani-
} mals. And I could see that if mail did
not sustain a proper relation with that
'“Something Else” it left him as quickly
as the snapping off of a switch or the
hurning out of a light.
J 9-
Further T could see that it was this
‘‘Something Else" which had been re­
sponsible for all scientific progress; and
still the scientists could only dissect the
mechanism, trace the circuits of the nerves
j and experiment with the functions and
disorders of the organs; but science had
not yet detected the function in its own
progress of that "Something Else” which
caused even the hearts of scientists to
burn with the thrill of great discoveries
-147-
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
which they ignorantly presumed them-
selves to be making because they rightly
assumed that their thoughts and conclu­
sions consisted of happy correlations of
their own observations, experiments and
sensory experience; but they wrongly ig­
nored the function of the very Energy O'
that animated them in the fusion of their
memories as an activity of understanding,
failing to realize that without this in­
spiration they could not have been led
to make the discovery; that it was not
“accidental”, as they thought; and that *»
were it not for the “Something Else”,
they would have gone the way of all the
uninspired on the endless treadmill of
the world’s repetition of routine.
And still further I could see that Re- t
ligion had developed a vocabulary with
which to do a lot of talking and preaching
about this “Something Else” which had
shown what it could do with men now •
dead for centuries, but seemed careful
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
not to imply too strongly or to encourage
the expectations that even granting the
omnipotence of that “Something Else”
it can do the same things today.
If the sun had gone out, whence the
heat and life of earth and man at this
moment? But with my own light out, I
could understand the past tense of re­
ligions from which the light had fled:
living on memories, doctrines and specu­
lative beliefs. What else was left? What
indeed could we do but cling as best we
might to a lost faith that having ceased
to be operative physiologically had be­
come a legend, where people worshipped
at an empty grave that was but a reflec­
tion of their own lives from which the
living, vibrant “Something Else” had fled,
leaving but an echo and a “word” ?
So I who had stayed outside of the
churches that could not feed me with
a living God to fill every nerve with life
and understanding; I who had said, “Fill
-149-.
G A T E S O F T H E ' M I N D
me with the Spirit if there is such a thing;
don’t talk to me about it” —now I could
understand. My heart ached for us all.
I too now lived on a memory that began
to fade like an echo without a voice to
sustain it.

T say all this in hopes of conveying
some understanding of what it meant to
be released again from the prison of my
own scull; the gates of my mind flung
open once more, dormant nerves alive
again, so that the whole universe from
which I had seemed to he a separate thing
now seemed to be inside instead of out-
side of my head. The moon, the sun and
the stars, the trees and the people I saw
in that moment seemed to be as much a
part of me as my own hands and feet.

same time I asked him how he was, and
lie told me he had ruptured himself lift­
ing a heavy packing case.
I was introduced to a man and a wo­
man, total strangers to me. When I looked
at the head of the man I imagined for
an instant that it resembled a long-, high
bridge. When I looked at the woman, for
a moment her face seemed to me to l>e
that of an old man holding a violin under
bis chin. When I laughingly told them
about it, the man said “That is strange.
I am working on the specifications for
a new bridge over the Mississippi River.
I am an engineer.’'
The woman said, “Why, whatever
made you say that? I never heard of such
a thing! I have been thinking of Just such
a man. I met him at a musical in Paris,
and he promised to give me lessons when
f returned, I am planning to go there
now.”
A man was brought to see me by a
-151-
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
friend who said, “Joseph, this man has
heard of your mental experiments and
would like to talk with you about them.’’
When I shook hands with him, a feel­
ing- of cold crept up my arm like a cold
draft that went all through me and chilled
me from head to foot. I was hard put to
it to complete the handshake courteously,
without betraying my revulsion to the
feeling.
During the meaningless formalities of
opening a conversation, I kept asking my- ^
self, “Now what does that mean? What
does that feeling mean?" But my mind
went blank, and produced no answer.
That was the answer, and I didn’t know
it at first.
The man said, “I thought perhaps you »
could tell me something of what I ought
to do. J have become confused in my
mind, and the doctors can't help me with
it. They don’t find anything wrong with
me physically.”

) I said, “Well, I can tell you wliat you
are going to have to do, if you don’t let
up a little, and take better care of your­
self. You are going to have to take a long
rest.”
“Do you think I should quit working
for awhile?”
“Try it for a week,” I said, “And
then let's talk about it again. Take a week
off at once, and just rest. Then come to
see me.”
But I never saw him again. My friend
told me that he dropped dead at his work,
having arranged to finish the week out
before taking a vacation.
11.
Thus began a long period of adjust­
ment between myself as a physiological
mechanism, of which I now had a better
knowledge, and the rest of the universe
in connection with which there was
“Something Else” that appeared to he
-153-
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
establishing a relation with my imagina­
tion and memory through the involuntary
nervous system.
It was not all clear sailing, and I pro-
ceded with a caution I had not exerted
before, as I was determined both to test ^
out its limitations, or perhaps I had better
say my limitations, and still avoid losing
it again.
'There appeared to be a “code” or lan­
guage of “feeling” combined with mental
imagery by which I could learn to extend ^
the range of my interpretation of con­
ditions. For example, the cold draft up
the arm, and the inability to imagine any­
thing when death was near and there was
nothing that could be said or done.
Then too there were lessons to be
learned regarding the conditions neces­
sary to sustain a cooperative relation be­
tween voluntary and involuntary nervous
system. Perhaps it were well not to spend
time theorizing about it, but rather mere-
-154- k

ly to state a few of the facts.
Some of my friends thought that I
had suddenly developed a '‘conscience",
but I had given that considerable thought
and I knew it was not what they meant
by the word. Conscience to most of them
was merely a matter of childhood training
as to what was right or wrong; and later
in life, a social conscience leased on pub­
lic opinion and fear, of criticism, “what
people would think”, and so on.
On the other hand there is a private
conscience of moral arbitration, which
governs conduct even in solitude on the
basis of self-respect, ideals and aspira­
tions. With this type of conscience I was
acquainted from childhood. No, what I
was now experiencing was a period of
systematic training, (call it self-training,
if you wish), in which my voluntary ner­
vous system was obliged to subject itself
in submission to the involuntary nervous
svstem for self-preservative reasons.

The bargain that intuition seems to
drive, is that it will serve you if you
serve it. You must obey your intuition
to cultivate it, to develop it and to retain
the use of it. This is a voluntary act. In
colloquial language, you have a hunch,
and the hunch is an involuntary experi­
ence. Whether or not you obey it is up to
you. If it is a real hunch or intuition you
will inevitably regret it if you do not.
These experiences will increase in fre­
quency if you obey them; and if you don’t
they will cease altogether. This is evident
from case histories.
But to complete the transaction one
must go further than that. One must re­
condition the entire system of reflexes
that constitute habit, so that neither habit
nor sensory stimuli nor the influence or
suggestions of environments, thoughts,
desires or purposes of other people can
interfere with the function or execution
of your intuition or your relation between

your inner self and that universal “Some­
thing Else". That must come before all
else —“or else”, in the final transaction.
If this had not been the case to some
extent with myself previously I would
have hit the drift with my hammer at the
time when it would have exploded the
dynamite cartridge I didn’t know was
there. In that and many other cases where
I was not alert to exercise any caution
of intuition, I would not be here to write
this record if my involuntary nervous
system had not been responsive to “Some­
thing Else” besides my own will, knowl­
edge, experience or senses. My arm re­
fused to obey. On other occasions it had
done just the reverse, by making a sud­
den movement, to my own astonishment,
to prevent an accident that I had failed
to prevent by a voluntary intuitive alert­
ness.

So now tliis proclivity appeared to be
undergoing a period of calisthenics in a
series of minor issues. 1 would start to
smoke, and experience a feeling not to
do so. If I heeded it, well and good. If
not, my hand would drop or throw the
match away before I could light up. I
have never felt required to stop smoking
but I was definitely stopped from in­
haling the smoke, limited in amount, and
prevented upon occasion.
I have never been a drinker, and all
my life have believed and practiced mod­
eration in all things. Therefore an oc­
casional drink was always in order. But
now I had the occasional experience,
(apparently as a sort of involuntary “ex­
ercise”), tltat I would have a glass in my
hand and be unable to drink it.
One day I was asked to join a group
on an excursion into the country, and the
prospect pleased me. A day in the country

away from the city was something that
I would enjoy. I had “Yes, I would be
glad to go” already framed and on the
way to my vocal chords, but it came out,
"No, I’m sorry. I can’t go.”
“Why not?”
That stumped me. There was no log­
ical reason. I wanted to go. I couldn't
answer and did not feel like making false
excuses to the one who was urging me,
so I merely smiled and shook my head.
This met with an argument. Why did I
"spoil the party”, and so on. They thought
me stubborn. I said I would be glad to
go, that I really wanted to go, hut not
just then. If they would wait until day
after tomorrow, I would go; but not the
next day.
So the whole trip was postponed in
order to have me go with them. Next
day the train we would have taken was
derailed in a gulley: three were killed
and many injured.

This was my wages, and countless
other occasions like it, for “playing the
game” that developed and conditioned
involuntary reflex actions to the promp­
tings of an intuitive feeling. If I had not
allowed myself to respond to the reactions
which threw a match away before I could
light a smoke, and stopped my hand be­
fore it could raise a drink to my mouth,
I would have been without that hand
and perhaps my eyes from an explosion,
and I would have said what I tried to
say, “Yes, I would be glad to go’’, and
we would all have been on the train that
was wrecked.
And still, it is interesting to note that
in “playing the game" above mentioned,
I have in the long run never been deprived
of anything, but have been merely re­
duced to moderation in all things. First,
however, I had to demonstrate a willing­
ness to give up anything and everything;

to do things I did not want to do, and
to refrain from things I did want to do:
all to the end of clearing the road for
the greater freedom.
Friends have thought that I was obey­
ing an “impulse”. No, it is not that. It is
an intuitive determination to follow an
inspired thought. The thought is my own,
an activity of my own mind and nervous
system, but an activity which would not
take place unless it were induced by a
feeling which constitutes inspiration and
which emanates from “Something Else”,
not my own.
I have utterly failed from the view­
point of science and psycholog}' to be able
to account for the results of experiment
in field or laboratory without that “Some­
thing Else”. I find by investigation that
men who can do so on a purely mechan­
istic basis are themselves merely talking
machines confined to the electrical re­
cordings of their verbal memory. My
- 161-
radio is mechanistic also, but it has to
have a “ Broadcasting Station” ; and that
is the “something else”.
I confess there are no “call letters”
to the Human Radio "Station”. I do not
know What or Who or Where the “vi­
brations” or radiant energy comes from
which is transformed into ati activity of
the imagination by means of selective
stimulation of memory-elements, but I
do know that so far as I am concerned,
together with my associates through many
years of research, on the basis of exper­
ience, observation and experiment, on an
operational, not a theoretical scientific
basis, we have established the fact for
ourselves that man’s survival and prog­
ress on a level superior to that of an in­
telligent animal depends entirely upon his
rising above the level of a talking machine
and establishing a relation as a “receiver”
to “Something Else”.
Name it what you please, it will still
- 162-
G A T E S O F T H E M I N D
be the source of all inspiration, all great
art, music, literature, culture and scien­
tific discoveries. And it will still be what
lias produced the world’s scriptures and
spiritual concepts. All the evidence we
can educe today tends to establish the
^ fact that one Jesus of Nazareth and His
apostles knew what they were talking
about; and that the mental activity of
those who think otherwise is confined to
the reflective operations of the sensory
and verbal memory. This is indeed a self-
sufficient “mechanism”, and that only,
but without any dependable relation with
truth or the rest of the universe unless it
# is responsive to the “Something Else”
which has the power to shape out of the
sensory and verbal memory an activity
J of the imagination which corresponds
with or portrays not only past and pres­
ent, near and distant, but also future
facts.
This is something that each individ-
) -163-
ual may test out for himself. It is pos­
sible for any and every human being to
“prophesy” if he will fulfill the con­
ditions. The survival of our Christian civ­
ilization depends on it. It cannot survive
on the basis of doctrinal beliefs or a
legendary, speculative faith. It must be
an operative faith, rooted in a physio­
logical inspiration of prophetic intuition
that will restore to mankind his heritage
of spiritual gifts.
This is the inner nature of the present
historic crisis, and I foresaw this crisis
and described it more than fifty years
ago. The survival of our Christian-Amer-
ican civilization and democratic way of
life depends on it. Christianity will sur­
vive, but not the speculative churches, and
not our democratic way of life unless
history is supplemented by prophecy; and
unless a doctrinal God is supplanted by
a living God and a phenomenal “Some­
thing Else" that can enter our lives

through our nervous system on a basis
at least equal to that of the radio broad­
casting which now perpetually enters our
ears.
I have for a half century since the
early period that serves the purpose of
this commentary, lived my life to dis­
cover, to prove and to exemplify this
truth and the conditions that make such
a relation possible. But that is still another
story. And it includes the finding of Mary
Lillian, the building of my home and lab­
oratories in the Valley of the Pines, the
birth of my sons, and the records of my
search and research for the truths we
understand and live by.
