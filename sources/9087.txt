  		              		Experience Description   

    I was young and   during the end of the school day. I remember starting to feel sick, like when  coming down with the flu. My body hurt and I was exhausted. I had no energy and felt a heaviness. I walked home from school. I told my mother that I felt sick and then  went to bed. I slept maybe only a couple of hours. I got up out of bed to go to the bathroom and take some Advil. I remember getting the Advil and a cup of water. 

  My mother said that she heard me hit the floor in the bathroom. When she got in there, I wasn't breathing. That is what I know from my mother as she didn't  talk about this. 

  The next thing I remember was that I was sitting with my legs crossed under me. I was up in the top corner of the bathroom looking down on myself lying on the bathroom floor. I could see my mother moving my body. She was shaking my shoulders and gently slapping my face, as if to get me breathing again. I remember seeing a look of panic and fear on her face that I had never seen before. About as quick as I realized all of this, it was over. I do remember that while I was out of body, I felt a lightness about myself. I felt as if I was emptied of all the heaviness I carried every day. I felt a great sense of calm and peace. 

  I do not know how long I wasn't breathing or if my heart stopped. It must have been a short time, because my mother hadn't even called 911 yet. I really wish I had more detail because I have so many questions myself. After I started breathing again, I remember sitting up on the bathroom floor and I remember a conversation with my mother about going to the doctor. I agreed to go to the doctor, but I  knew that I was fine. I had this great feeling of wellness and health like I couldn't even describe. I still don't know how to describe it. It's like if you took the best you've ever felt and multiplied it by a hundred. I  felt so good, like I could have run a marathon or something. I somehow knew that I wasn't sick anymore and that I was completely fine. I do vaguely remember going to the doctor and being checked out. He didn't find anything wrong with me and couldn't explain why I had been sick. I don't remember any blood draws or those kind of tests being done. I feel like the doctor and my mother must have had private conversations about everything, because I don't remember them saying anything in front of me about anything. I still to this day have no idea what I was sick with or what exactly happened to make me stop breathing.

   Did I choke on the Advil or  was I just that sick with something? I will never know I guess. I have never talked about my out of body experience much. People are skeptical and judgemental and tend to make me feel bad. I think my young age made it difficult to talk about too. Also, everything I have read or heard on TV over the years, people have these long journeys, they see loved ones, etc. Mine was so short and quick. Recently  I was talking to my Doctor and  shared my story with her. She too had an NDE when she was young. She thinks that I probably had a longer journey, but that I don't remember it all.

  Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    Not long after my experience, I shared what happened with my mother. She was indifferent, so I never spoke about it much after that. I tried to tell my husband once and he rolled his eyes at me. I told both of my daughters who were very interested in my story and they completely believe meI recently shared with a friend and she told me to read Anita Moorjani's book, which led me here to your website. I was talking to my doctor about the book, which led to a conversation about my experience and my doctor shared with me that she had her own experience when she was young. We had a very validating conversation about it.  
  
Did you have any knowledge of near-death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       Uncertain   I was 17 when it happened, so I'm not sure if I knew anything about NDE prior to my own experience. I think I must have some knowledge, but I just don't know.  

  What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was probably real.     I wasn't sure if it was real at first. It felt very real, but I was young and I remember being unsure at first. I didn't have anyone to talk to about it or ask questions.  
  
  What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real.     I know my experience was real. I know that because I know more about NDE.  I have related to so much of what I have read/watched over the years. I am 50 years old now, I know it really happened.  
  
At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       No     

Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?         no  

Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?         I don't have any suggestions. I think it is a very thorough questionnaire.
