THE BEGINNING OF
GREEK PHILOSOPHY
Part One
Greek philosophy had its beginning with
the Seven Sophists. Of these Thales was
the foremost, being deeply versed in all na­
tural wisdom, whereas the other six were
honored principally for their eminence in
jurisprudence, morality and ethics. The
Greek word for wisdom was sophia and one
who had raised his soul to an eminent de­
gree of knowledge came to be called a Soph­
ist or a wise man. It was the Seven Sophists
who formulated the laws that resulted in
the establishment of the Greek civilization.
Upon the foundation which they laid the
Hellenic states rose to superlative heights
of culture, giving to the world the greatest
aggregation of thinkers ever produced by a
single people.
Philostratus thus defines the sophistry of
the original Greeks: “We must regard the
ancient sophistic art as philosophic rhetoric.
1
For it discusses the themes that philosophers
treat of, but whereas they, by their method
of questioning, set snares for knowledge,
and advance step by step as they confirm
the minor points of their investigations, but
assert that they have still no sure knowledge,
the sophist of the old school assumes a
knowledge of that whereof he speaks. At
any rate, he introduces his speeches with
such phrases as ‘I know,’ or ‘I am aware,’
or ‘I have long observed,’ or ‘For mankind
there is nothing fixed and sure.’ This kind
of introduction gives a tone of nobility and
self-confidence to a speech and implies a
clear grasp of the truth.”
The opinions of the Sophists were so var­
ied that their thought is not susceptible of
organization into any general body of doc­
trines. In fact, the term as originally ap­
plied, was an honorary title signifying in­
tellectual excellence, but in no way limit­
ing or identifying the nature of the thought.
It is generally acknowledged that many
philosophers of eminent attainments were
termed Sophists, but the w’ord later fell into
disrepute until it came to signify profession­
al teachers or those who taught philosophy
2
for prescribed fees. Most references to the
Sophists which have descended to this day
originated among their adversaries, one of
the chief of whom was Socrates who ac­
cused the Sophists of his time of prostitut­
ing knowledge for gain.
TH ALES of Miletus (5th century B. C.),
of Phoenician extraction, has the distinction
of being the first upon whom the title Sopn-
os or The Wise was conferred. Thales spent
the greater part of his life in travel. He
was initiated into the mysteries of the Cre­
tans, penetrated into Asia and Phoenicia,
and his last and most extensive journey was
to Egypt where he was instructed in the arts
and sciences by the priests of the temple of
Jupiter at Memphis. Being the first of the
Greeks to engage in speculative learning he
was regarded with special veneration, and
in his fifty-ninth year was honored with the
title of The Wise. Though deeply versed
in occult lore, his philosophy was evolved
within his own mind. Having received no
aid in the interpretation of the elaborate
metaphysics of the Eastern nations, he was
dignified with the additional title of the
Self-learned. Cicero acknowledges Thales
3
to be the first author of philosophy; Strabo,
that he was the first of the Greeks to en­
quire into natural causes and mathematics;
Plutarch calls him the inventor of philos­
ophy; Justin Martyr the most ancient of
philosophers; Tertullian, the first of natural
philosophers.
The basic principles of the philosophy of
Thales are as follows:
1— Water is the first principle of all natural
bodies, from which they come, of which
they are composed, upon which they sub­
sist, and to which they will ultimately be
resolved.
2— Humidity, because it is present in the
seed of all living creatures, is the basis of
generation.
3— God is that which hath neither beginning
nor end.
4— The world is full of gods and heroes
which exist invisibly in the air and in their
invisible states these entities are called souls.
5— Soul is a self-moving nature having with­
in itself the power of moving other things.
4
6—The world is alive and God is the Soul
thereof diffused through every part through
the medium of water.
BIOS had the title of The Wise conferred
upon him because he purchased from slave­
ry some captive Messinian girls and reared
them as his own daughters, later giving
them portions of his estate and returning
them to their own parents. Bios was much
given to pleading the cause of the oppressed
and was famed throughout Greece for his
knowledge of jurisprudence. Those who
came to him seeking advice on the problems
of right living invariably received this an­
swer:
“Before you perform any act behold your
own face in a mirror. If your face seems
handsome, do some handsome thing that is
worthy of it. If it seems ill-formed, do some
beautiful deed that will supply the defect of
nature.”
The death of Bios was a dramatic event.
After pleading the cause of a fellow-citizen
in the courts, Bios, who was very old, seated
himself to await the decision of the judges.
The court rendered judgment in favor of
5
Bios and disbanded, only to discover the
aged jurist dead in his seat.
Bios was not the founder of any important
philosophical system, but is honored prin­
cipally because of his deep practical insight
into the issues of daily life.
The following are representative of his
precepts:
1— He is indeed unfortunate who cannot
bear misfortune.
2— It is a disease of the mind to desire after
such things as cannot be reasonably ob­
tained.
3— The most difficult thing to bear courage­
ously is a change for the worse.
A
—It is better to decide a difference between
our enemies than between our friends, for
in the first place one of our enemies will
become a friend, but in the second place
one of our friends will certainly become an
enemy.
5— We should so live that it becomes of no
moment whether life be long or short.
6^-That leader of the state gains most glory
6
who first himself obeys the laws of his state.
7—Those who busy themselves in vain
knowledge resemble owls who see only in
the night {opinions), but are blind in the
light (facts).
PITTACUS combined both military and
judicial power. The people of Mitelene
chose him as general of their armies and
later, by popular vote, elevated him to the
Tyranny, the state of absolute rulership. He
governed the Mitelenaeans for ten years,
greatly improving the laws of the state, and
at the end of that time, feeling his age un­
equal to the burden, resigned the govern­
ment in spite of the protestations of his peo-
pe. He died at the age of a hundred, ac­
cording to Lucian.
Pittacus is remembered chiefly for what
is called his great sentence—two simple but
all powerful words: “Know opportunity.”
His political precepts may be summed up in
his own statement, taken from Plutarch:
“That ruler is indeed happy who has made
his subjects afraid not of him but for him.”
Being a man in high position, sorrow
7
weighed heavily upon the soul of Pittacus.
On one occasion he was moved to say: “Re­
proach not the unhappy, for the hand of
God is upon them.”
Like Socrates, Pittacus was unhappily
married, his wife being of birth and station
above him. On one occasion his wife over­
threw the table where he and some guests
were dining. Seeing that his friends were
troubled, Pittacus remarked: “Each of you
has some misfortune; he is happiest who
has none more serious than a nagging wife.”
The following are representative of his
precepts:
1— The greatest good is to do the present
thing well.
2— It is the duty of a wise man to foresee
evil and to prevent it.
3— It is the duty of a valiant man to over­
come evil when it is at hand.
4— The past is certain; that which is to come
is obscure.
5— He who envies another is mad.
This philosopher pardoned the murderer
8
of his own son, and released him to liberty,
saying: “Pardon is better than penitence.”
CHILON of Lacedaemonian, was a phil­
osopher of such superior wisdom that his
words ranked among the Oracles. Three of
his precepts were, on the authority of Pliny,
placed in the temple at Delphi, inlaid in let­
ters of gold upon marble. These precepts
were: first, that every man should know
himself; second that moderation is the sec­
ret of happiness; and third that money is
the cause of misery. He further declared
that love and hate were the most fierce of
the affections of the soul. He therefore
fashioned the following precept: Love all
things as though some time you might hate
them, and hate all things as though some
time you might love them.
Chilon once asked Aesop what Jupiter
was doing. The famous writer of fables re­
plied, “Jupiter is continually pulling down
the high and raising up the low.”
Chilon died embracing his son, when the
youth was declared victor in the Olymphic
Games. The aged man’s joy was so ex­
cessive that his heart was unable to stand the
strain.
9
Among the moral sentences of Chilon are
the following:
1— The learned differ from the unlearned
in that the wise have a good hope.
2— Three things are difficult: to conceal
secrets; to make good use of leisure; and
to bear the injuries of the unjust.
3— A ruler of the state must not think up­
on any transitory mortal things but only '
upon those things which are eternal and
immortal.
4— If you are strong, behave mildly that you
may be respected rather than feared.
5— Fear that man who is inquisitive into
the business of others.
6— Let not your tongue run more swiftly
than your mind.
7— Prefer honest loss to unjust gain.
8— Go slowly to the feast of your friends,
but go swiftly to their misfortunes.

THE BEGINNING OF
GREEK PHILOSOPHY
PA RT TW O
Periander, Prince of Corinth, came to be
included among the Seven Sophists because
of his great power and the wide sphere of
his influence. He associated himself with
the wisest of the Greek thinkers and became
a patron of learning, both philosophical and
judicial. He was hereditary prince of the
Corinthians and traced his ancestry from
Hercules-through an unbroken line of twen­
ty-two generations. Plutarch declared that
Periander became Tyrant or ruler by an
hereditary disease derived from his father.
By disease Plutarch intimated inherited pow­
er. Being a wise prince, however, Periander
sought to purge himself of this disease by
association with the learned and by cultiva­
tion of democratic relationships with his
subjects.
Two of his most famous precepts were:
first, that a good mind in a human body
■1
was the greatest in the least; second that a
wise man concealed his misfortunes that
they might not gladden the hearts of his
enemies.
With advancing years Periander devel­
oped an excessive melancholy, and at last
ordered his own death in the eightieth year
of his age. He so cunningly devised the
method of his decease that the time and
place of his burial remained unknown, and
the Corinthians erected for him a monu­
ment over an empty tomb.
Of his wisdom the following sentences
have been preserved:
1— A democracy is better than a■tyranny
(.absolute monarchy').
2— Pleasures are mortal, virtues are immor­
tal.
3— In good fortune be moderate, in bad for­
tune be prudent.
4— So conduct yourself that during life you
will be praised and in death beatified.
5— To your friends be the same in prosper­
ity and adversity.
2 .
6— Use new diets but old laws.
7— A successful democracy must have in it
something of aristocracy.
8— hove and not armies must guard the per­
sons of the great.
CLEOBULOS, tyrant of Lindus, was also
lineally descended from Hercules, and is
described by Suidas as, “Excelling in wis­
dom, outward beauty and physical strength
all those of his time.” He was learned in
the philosophy of the Egyptians and pre­
pared many precepts and doctrines for the
consideration of rulers. He wrote consider­
ably and composed verses to the number of
three thousand. His daughter was a most
powerful influence in his life, having re­
ceived every benefit which education could
bestow, a circumstance unusual in his day.
Cleobulos died at over seventy years of age
and his memory was perpetuated by the
grateful citizens of his state.
His most famous precepts were:
1—Do good to your friend that he may be
more your friend, and to your enemy that
he may become your friend, for we should
3
beware of the calumny of friends and of the
treachery of enemies.
2— Marry only those who are of equal social
position for by matching into a higher fam­
ily one procures masters, not kinsmen.
3— Educate your daughters as you do your
sons.
4— Devote your life to something which is
excellent.
5— If a leader of a state is to be happy he
must trust none that are about him.
6— Moderation is the greatest virtue.
7— Rich, be not exalted; poor, be not deject­
ed.
8— Learn to bear unmoved the vicissitudes
of fortune.
9— ‘Tis better to love to listen than it is to
love to speak-
10— T a^ care of the body and of the soul.
11— Listen willingly but believe not all you
hear.
12— When you go forth, consider what you
4
have to do', when you return consider what
you have done.
13—It is better to know a few things than
to be ignorant of all things.
SOLON, Archon of Athens, was one of
the noblest and wisest of the Greeks. He
earned for himself the title of The Eloquent
for in discourse, rhetoric and poetry he was
without a peer. Solon was initiated into
the mysteries of the Egyptians and was the
great law-maker of the Athenians. Of law
Solon wrote: “Laws are like cobwebs which
entangle the weak but through which the
greater break uninjured.” Being asked what
constituted a well ordered city, he answered,
“That in which the citizens obey the magi­
strates and the magistrates obey the laws.”
Solon declared that there was but one
thing that man had to fear, namely that he
would die before he became a philosopher.
Solon shared the philosophic extension of
life for he died at over a hundred years, or­
dering his friends to carry his bones to Sala-
mis, the city of his birth, there burn them
and cause them to be scattered over the
country. Solon loved knowledge to the end
5
and on the day of his death lifted his weary
head to catch the words of some discoursing
friends. Being asked why he did this he
answered, “that I may learn even while I
am departing from this life.”
Herewith are a few fragments from the
wisdom of Solon:
1— If all men should bring their misfortunes
together in one place, each one would carry
his own home again rather than take an
equal share from the common stock-
2— The happiness of the outward life arises
from honest action and temperate living.
3— To one who complained of the weight
and number of his troubles, Solon said:
“Come into this tower and view the build­
ings below and ponder upon the number of
sorrows that heretofore, now, and hence­
forth shall dwell together under these roofs,
and speak not of misery as though you bore
them all.”
A
—Make reason the guide of every action.
5—Reason concerning hidden things from
those things which are apparent.
Solon studied philosophy with Psenophis
6
of Heliopolis and Sonches of Sais, the most
learned and venerated of the Egyptian
priest-philosophers, by whom, according to
Plato, he was taught the language of the
Atlanteans.
