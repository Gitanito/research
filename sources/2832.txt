THE WEB OF THE UNIVERSE
CHAPTER I
"
FATHER-MOTHER SPIN A WEB "
HE Stanzas of Dzyan, from which the title of this
J-
chapter is taken, are reputed to be the most ancient
occult writings in existence. They are described as ". . . an
archaic Manuscript a collection of palm leaves made im-
permeable to water, fire and air, by some unknown process ".
Upon them Madame Blavatsky based her book The Secret
Doctrine and many extracts from them are quoted in both
volumes.
Frequently the term the Web appears in the Stanzas :
"
The Seven were not yet born from the Web of Light. . . .
"
Father-Mother spin a Web whose upper end is fastened
to Spirit, the Light of the One Darkness, and the lower one
to its
shadowy end Matter; and this Web is the Universe,
spun out of the Two Substances made in One. . . .
"
It
expands when the Breath of Fire [spirit] is
upon it; it
contracts when the Breath of the Mother [matter] touches
it. ... When it is
cooling it becomes radiant
"
. . . etc.
(From Stanzas II and III.)
It
may well be that this Web, with spirit and matter for
its
warp and woof, is the parent of the Universal Mind, that
world of Mind which, following the results of recent scien-
tific research into the nature of physical material, is
being
so widely inferred to-day.
As above, so below and the infinitely large may often be
found reflected in the infinitely small, as a whole landscape
in a dewdrop. The cocoon spun by many of the humblest
9
THE WEB OF THE UNIVERSE
of creatures as a sacrificial
provision for the welfare of their
progeny would appear to be itself a minute reflection of
that vast and glorious sacrifice made by the Creator, the
Father-Mother of our Solar Universe, that a planetary system
might be successfully cradled and so become manifest.
The Stanzas proceed to outline a vast scheme of evolu-
tionary processes in which the One becomes Three and then
Seven; the sequences which follow are also based on recur-
rent septenary systems.
The states of consciousness possible to man and the pri-
mary modifications of natural forces, as well as the worlds of
the Solar System with which we are concerned, are each
said to be seven in number. Similarly, septenates are said to
mark every branch of manifestation all are sequences of
seven factors. The seven colours of the light spectrum and
the octaves of music are among the many correspondences
which may be taken as familiar examples.
Accepting the monistic theory of One Life, let us attempt
the contemplation of One becoming Seven. This, if we grant
the possibility of motion and therefore the possibility
of
manifestation within the One, is
comparatively easy. Let a
pencil point touching a paper surface represent One. Move
the point and a line appears. At once the number three is in
evidence, the two termini of the line, themselves two points,
and the line itself. Two extremes are there and the relating
line between them. As the principal permutations of three
factors are numerically seven, the septenate system of mani-
festation seems at least reasonable. Assuming three factors
for example, A, B and C, to be equal in value they can
be arranged in order of dominance as ABC, ACB, BAG,
BCA, CAB, CBA, six in all; to these add their synthesis with
"
no one before the other
"
and we have the seventh. The
formula is 1x2x3 + 1= 7. Within the seven, relation-
ships may be noted of 3 to 4 and of 2 to 5, both of significance.
Another illustration will assist here. Man, as a construc-
tional creator, uses his hands. Though his creations are
10
"
FATHER-MOTHER SPIN A WEB "
extended indefinitely by means of tools and machines, all he
makes derives from the hands; they are the original creative
instruments. Now the whole arm is divisible into three parts
the upper arm, the lower arm and the hand. We have
therefore in this example a main group of three and the
third member of this trinity,
the hand, is divided further
into five, the fingers. This last
group of five is the imme-
diately active creative agent. Such an analogy, or corre-
spondence, affords some assistance to an understanding of
the Three-in-One relationship of the original creative prin-
ciple. The upper arm, for instance, is the seat of power
for its
septenary group; the lower arm is
adaptable and flex-
ible, is
anatomically dual, and is
capable of skilful direction;
the five-fingered hand is the actively creative medium. Here
is a close resemblance to the description of the One becoming
Seven.
From a study of the occult instructions the inference is
irresistible that in the arm and hand of man, viewed as his
means for the creation of forms at the physical level, we have
a true correspondence, as far as it
goes, with the plan of
Creative Manifestation. Of the seven planes and principles
of a Solar System, two are said to be hidden;
"
in Silence
and Darkness
"
are the terms used with reference to them;
five are actively manifest. Hence the statement, so common
in certain eastern philosophies, that we live at present in a
five-fold universe.
In our example, if we assume for a moment the point of
view of one of man's creations, say a piece of sculpture, then
to it the upper and lower arm would be
"
beyond ", out of
view, for the five-fingered hand would appear to be the
immediate and only creative cause of its existence. Similarly,
to us, within and about us is evidence of a five-fold creative
activity. We are conscious (not necessarily self-conscious)
in five different states of consciousness or planes, namely,
physical, emotional, mental, intuitional and volitional; the
corresponding five occult centres in man are more or less
ii
THE WEB OF THE UNIVERSE
active and we have five senses or avenues of contact with the
physical world.
Two planes and two principles, the Divine and Monadic,
(Adi-Anupadaka) are at present beyond, unknown, "in
silence ". But a vast work of theirs, indeed that which makes"
the very field of our five-fold manifestation possible, would
seem to be the Web spun by them within which and by
means of which, as a scriptural phrase has it, we live and
move and have our being. They are the two subtler and
most deeply occult principles of our Solar Universe and are
symbolised by Father-Mother in the Stanzas quoted. They
support the whole as the arm carries the hand. A description
of the pattern and the function of their Web is
attempted in
this book.

CHAPTER II
SOME DESCRIPTIVE DEFINITIONS
IN
the later Stanzas of Dzyan there is a description, heavily
veiled in symbolism, of the process by which forms come
into manifestation and of the elaborate seven-fold scheme of
evolution in which our human consciousness is taking its
assigned part.
In an appendix to this book a summary is
given of the
vast cycles of manifestation known as Chains and Rounds in
modern occult writings. The summary is
necessarily in very
general terms, but a perusal will enable the reader to grasp
in broad outline the nature of some of the closely guarded
secrets imparted in olden times to the initiates of various
Mystery Schools under stringent vows of silence. The veil
of secrecy has been lifted from time to time, as minor cycles
have run their course, and we are to-day at liberty to examine
and analyse and, so far as may be possible, to test some of the
instructions given. Although these are said to be the result
of experienced investigation the student is
invariably advised
to receive the information as hypothetical and theoretical
only, till enabled by his own researches to accept or reject.
Till then a suspended judgment is the wisest course. This
interpretation of the Web of the Universe is submitted in all
sincerity but with the same reservation.
In order to avoid misunderstandings this chapter is devoted
to giving a few descriptive definitions of some more or less
familiar terms that are used in this book and are met with
frequently in occult literature. A chart also is
given (No. I)
which displays the seven-fold and the five-fold relationships
of the Worlds and the Principles of Man.*
*
The reading and study of this chapter and of the appendix may be post-
poned if
preferred. They are both explanatory of terms used and reference can
be made to them as required. They arc not essential, though useful, to the
general exposition.

We are said to be in the Fourth or Middle Round of our Terrene
Chain: hence, during our present occupation of our planet Earth, we are
functioning at the densest levels of our whole Scheme. As four planes
only are normally used in the same Round Cycle it follows that, during
this world-occupation, humanity is consciously engaged actively on the
levels of the Lower Mental, the Astral and the two divisions of the Physical.
Beginning now, however, to climb in consciousness the upward arc of the
cycle, the Higher Mental is the spiritual principle ahead as the next goal
to reach. Thus the following gives the current and immediate relation-

LIFE
Spirit undifferentiated. The One Life. God.
CONSCIOUSNESS
A ray of the One Life separated from the ocean of life
by
association and identification with Forms. Hence awareness,
a vague and diffused consciousness, is awakened. Examples :
The Mineral, Plant and Animal Kingdoms on an increasingly
conscious scale.
SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS
The very definite and clear-cut association of Life or Spirit
with a form-body, a personality, is the means by which con-
sciousness distinguishes between itself in its own separate
abode or body and in all other bodies and thus is individu-
alised and becomes /^//-conscious. Example :
Humanity.
THE POSITION OF OUR EARTH
Four of the seven Chains of our Scheme are shown diagram-
matically on Chart No. 2. This is to illustrate the statement
that the seven globes of Chain IV are manifest in four planes
only and these the densest of our Scheme.
In the first Chain of our Solar Scheme, its one and only
globe was of mental material. The whole vast period of
that first Chain's work, in terms of form, was the creation of
a single planet and its modest contents. The second Chain
had three globes of form and the third had five.
Being
now on the fourth Chain of the Scheme we profit greatly
from the work of our predecessors on the first three Chains
and have seven planets of material form to use, built of the
material of four planes. Chart No. 2 displays this in
a diagram that Mr. A. P. Sinnett* always insisted was the
only correct way to depict the successive Chains of Globes-

publications in the west.

Whether these material globes, in their inter-relations
within each Chain, be regarded as concentric (Steiner) or
spatially separate (Sinnett and Leadbeater) does not here
concern us; the important feature is that the first world to
be built and hence the first and earliest plane of form is
stated to be mental. It
may therefore reasonably be inferred
that all material globes of form arise from modifications of
what Mmc. Blavatsky called Lower Manas (The Lower
Mind or Mental II.). This is the subtlest of the worlds of
form.
FORMS AND THE FORMLESS
As the successive Chains of globes are described as being
always concerned with four planes it is obvious, from Dia-
gram No. 2, that the work of the First Chain, though possess-
ing but one globe of form, is also on three planes above the
lower mental. But all above the lower mental is held to be
of a
"
formless
"
nature. Let us therefore attempt to dispose
of the difficulty which may very naturally arise from the use
of the word
"
formless ".
This word has been frequently used to distinguish the
inner or subtler spiritual planes, that is, the divine life un-
manifested to normal vision, from that of material form
and a rather puzzling conception is
thereby offered to the
16
SOME DESCRIPTIVE DEFINITIONS
student. Formlessness implies no thing, no separated feature
of manifestation whatever, yet several of such planes are
named and these presumably differ! The explanation is
however not far to seek and we need to be at the outset
entirely clear as to the reason for the use of this somewhat
misleading descriptive term. An analogy will most easily
clarify the position. Consider the relation of a pencil point
to paper as an illustration of the connection between the
higher and the lower mental planes. The pencil point can
very reasonably be called formless : but it is
capable of creat-
ing form on paper. Move the pencil point and under a skilled
hand an elaborate form-design emerges. If it be conceived
as moving with extreme rapidity we should witness what
would approximate to an instantaneous drawing, and ap-
parently ex nihilo \ Endow the pencil point in imagination
with the speed of light and we should approach a comparison
with the inter-action of the higher and lower mental prin-
ciples for the higher mental centre apparently can move at
that prodigious speed.
Man, being a reflection of the universe in miniature, also
has his formless spiritual nature, and the bodies of form
which it uses make up his personality. From the point of
view of this personality (for we are at present largely confined
to these slow and ponderous personal bodies of physical, emo-
tional and mental material), we can best picture higher men-
tal
activity as due to a brilliant point of light.
This expresses
the human spiritual self, the spark of the divine flame; this
is the true centre of consciousness of a human being however
much, in ignorance of his true nature, he may be identified
with bodies of form. The human spirit
is formless in itself,
as is the pencil point, but capable readily of creating form on
the screen of the lower mind and a form, too, of three
dimensions that has a considerable
"
lag
"
of persistence, like
the lag of an impression on the retina of the eye.
Many a similar analogy could be employed such as the
light from a cinema lantern and the screen on which the
17 B
THE WEB OF THE UNIVERSE
picture is thrown. The light is formless until it is arrested and
held. Both light and screen are needed for the creation of a
flowing picture. The two together provide the mechanism
for the manifestation of forms. The light symbolises the
higher, the screen represents the lower mind. It is
by the
study of such analogies that the term
"
formless
"
becomes
understandable.
THE ELEMENTS AND TATTVAS
Authorities in occultism describe the three worlds of form,
physical, emotional and mental, as distinguishable by their
specific
"
measure
"
or
"
tattva ". This refers to the mode of
motion, the rhythmic movement, the measure, of their mate-
rial
composition, for the units of each are said to have a
dominant and characteristic tattva. The ancient occult
teaching that material is
really motion or energy, though
commonplace to-day, is less than fifty years old in our western
science. These measures or tattvas have their minor corre-
spondences again on each plane, and those with which we are
most familiar are the sub-states of physical material which
we call solid, liquid and gaseous. Concerning the larger
divisions of our three-fold world the solid (prithivi)
tattva is
dominantly characteristic of the physical, the liquid (apas)
tattva of the astral, and the gaseous (tejas) tattva of the
mental. Another series in correspondence are the so-called
elements of nature earth, water, fire and air. Each has a
significant sign or symbol a square, a crescent, a triangle.
The following chart displays these correspondences :

Element EARTH WATER FIRE
Tattva PRITHIVI APAS TEJAS
Phys. sub-state SOLID LIQUID GASEOUS
Symbol of Tattva SQUARE HALF-CIRCLE TRIANGLE
Geometrical Figure CUBE ICOSAHEDRON OCTAHEDRON
NOTE : With reference to the element
" air ", at present fire and air
are almost interchangeable terms. Cold flame is an occult term for air
on certain occasions, on others air (vayu tattva) is classified as a higher
element than fire. In our own present cycle, the deepest in material form,
air is fire grown cold, hence the correspondence of true fire with the
"
mental "
in this chart.
18
SOME DESCRIPTIVE DEFINITIONS
In The Secret Doctrine, Vol. I, 273, H.P.B. states that the
"
correct order for esoteric purposes is fire, air, water, earth,"
Esoteric purposes means the order in which, in the beginning
of our cycle, they manifested. Fire first and the tejas tattva,
its measure of motion, has a triangle for its
symbol. The tri-
angle in this connection may be taken as the flat
figure repre-
sentative of the octahedron, the occult geometrical
"
unit
"
of
the mental world. The appropriateness of this octahedral
correspondence with the mind will emerge in our study.
OUR THREE-FOLD PLANET
That our familiar material world is not only physical but
has a mental and emotional content too, also of material,
may quite well be inferred from the fact that man has a
mental and emotional nature in addition to a physical body.
But thought and feeling have been so related to and indeed
identified with the brain and nervous systems that the infer-
ence is
by no means universally made.
A difficulty which prevents a general acceptance of this
view is doubtless the concept of a material mind; yet
recorded experiences of consciousness, apart from the phy-
sical brain and body and quite independent of both, are many
and increasingly frequent.
The concept of our world as three-fold means that in com-
bination with the
physical
earth there are also worlds (or
planes) interacting with it of mental and emotional material.
This is a logical assumption to-day in the light of our modern
knowledge concerning material itself, for, resolved into
energy as it is, the long standing materialistic
concept of the
universe disappears.
Energy, Motion, Life, call it what we will, alone remains
and a fuller understanding of many a mental and emotional
problem would follow if the concept of energy was extended
to include extremely subtle varieties of material whose tattvas
or measures of vibratory response were emotional and mental
in quality. As differences in the elements of physical material
THE WEB OF THE UNIVERSE
are now known to be due to differences in wave motions or
energy, an extension of the same concept provides us with
the distinction between one interpenetrating world of experi-
ence and another, which is
relatively easy to comprehend.
In this connection a very appropriate analogy and example
is afforded by the Radio System and a wireless receiving set.
When an efficient set is tuned in to a particular programme
every other is
ignored. Though capable of reproducing
many programmes, all of which are being broadcasted at the
same time, one alone comes through. This obviously de-
pends entirely on the degree of selectivity of the machine.
Very similarly, on the large scale of the planes of nature,
though we live in three material worlds at once we are con-
scious with clarity and precision of one only, the physical.
We are at present, fortunately, unable easily to tune into the
other two. Control and mastery of mind and emotion, that
is, selective skill in listening in to these worlds of experience,
are essential to avoid confusion and its
possible consequence
insanity. Hence though the mental and emotional planes
are interwoven intimately with the physical they are very
naturally translated and interpreted in the terms of our fami-
liar
physical senses and physical brain consciousness. Of
the three worlds separated from each other by differences of
wave motion only, as an examination of the Web will ex-
plain, two are not clearly apprehended and known by them-
selves as yet.
We function in them directly after what we
call
"
death ", and the intermediate periods between physical
incarnations have special value for this reason. While in
physical bodies however this selective skill and distinction
still awaits the development of other faculties probably the
sixth and seventh senses.
PERSONALITY
This term is used in the literal sense of per sona, the mask
behind or within which the real man acts. The personality
technically consists of the abodes or bodies in which a man
20
SOME DESCRIPTIVE DEFINITIONS
normally lives and includes therefore the physical, emotional
and mental bodies of a human being functioning on corre-
sponding planes. These three planes or worlds in combina-
tion, as has just been said, constitute our material earth
planet.
HIGHER AND LOWER SELF (See Chart on page 14)
These terms are convenient and perhaps permissible as dis-
tinguishing the spiritual principles of man from the personal.
But they arc unfortunate in the implied disparagement of the
so-called
"
lower ". The spiritual principles of man, the
spiritual, intuitional and higher mental, derived from the
One Life, owe whatever self-realisation they attain to their
formal projection into the bodies that we call the personality
(the lower self). This latter is the mirror in which alone
spirit
can see, apprehend and hence know itself. To view
the personality as
"
lower
"
in the sense of inferior is as
though we exalted the lantern of a cinema theatre and dis-
paraged the screen which alone enables the picture to be seen
at all. Both the spiritual focus of light, the Ego, and the
Personality that reflects the focused light are equally neces-
sary to the Source of Light, the One Life. Hence we should
not allow the terms higher and lower to connote superiority
and inferiority. With this reservation the terms may be
accepted as conventionally useful.
SUBJECTIVE AND OBJECTIVE
Subjective experiences are those which are interior, or
seemingly interior, to oneself, that is, are within one's own
consciousness, such as experiences of thinking and feeling.
Though every experience may be claimed to be subjective in
essence, as indeed is
obviously the case, it is usual to define
as objective that part of the environment which is
recognised
in experience as being environment. This is to say that, from
a state of complete subjectivity in which we began, humanity
has succeeded in relating clearly a certain group of inner
experiences to an external world, namely, the physical.
21
THE WEB OF THE UNIVERSE
Hence the physical world is
commonly held to be objective.
Further, with many, the physical body itself is
becoming
objective as consciousness, by withdrawal, succeeds in
externalising its reactions. With still further success on these
lines, though it will be much later for most of us, the emo-
tional and mental worlds will become objective and known
as environment.
Objectivity of the emotional and mental worlds is now
called psychism, or psychic faculty, and is often accidental and
embarrassing to the individual if this inner sight has been
opened prematurely without adequate control and under-
standing of the situation. In due course the race will be nor-
mally and rationally psychic, which means that, in their turn,
man's own emotional and mental bodies will be known as
not being the real Self. Thus the process upon which
humanity is at present engaged is
apparently an ordered
withdrawal as the objective environment increases and the
subjective field diminishes.
Consciousness is
amply compensated for this seeming
transfer from subjective to objective by its
increasing sensi-
tiveness and speed of response to contacts made. Put in
another way, consciousness withdraws from a periphery, to
which it has been
"
tempted
"
by the bodies it uses, to a centre,
whence it
emerged from Life as a point of living light, and
brings with it on its return the jewel of great price, the faculty
of responding to the whole content of the objective worlds at
will.
That point of living light, a unit of subjective conscious-
ness, by identifying itself with bodies succeeds in
"
becoming
a sphere ". Then, on the return journey, it
proceeds to
externalise the sphere, beginning with the outermost layers,
and thus breaks down the great illusion of its identification
with matter. The point thus first becomes the sphere and
then re-becomes the point.
By thus realising the material worlds of the physical, the
emotional and the mental as being objective to itself, the
22
SOME DESCRIPTIVE DEFINITIONS
eternal spark regains the tremendous facilities of a point of
life with the whole content of the sphere at its service. That
attainment ultimately spells omnipresence the first of the
divine faculties to be unfolded in man.
PERMANENT ATOMS AND SKANDHAS
Permanent atom is the technical term applied to that atom
or unit of each of the personal planes (mental, astral or phy-
sical) which is retained life after life for the use of the rein-
carnating spirit or ego and which contains within itself the
record of all
past experience. It therefore provides the plan
on which the new body for the use of the egoic consciousness
on each plane may be accurately built for the next incarna-
tion.
For many students the difficulty of this theory has been the
retention of the permanent atom by consciousness while
functioning on higher planes. Where, for instance, is the
physical permanent atom when one is in devachan? How
can an atom of a material plane be held there ?
The difficulty is however more apparent than real, though
in some quarters it has led to a rejection of the whole theory
of the permanent atom as an adequate explanation of con-
tinuity in human evolution. But one would be equally justi-
fied in rejecting the equator or the north pole on the score
that neither has ever been exhibited in support of an explorer's
claim. The answer is of course that these terms all indicate
a locus, a position, a focus of power, not a thing.
In illustration, place an ordinary bar magnet underneath
a paper covered with iron filings and the fragments of iron
will at once display themselves in a formal pattern. They
obey the forces playing within the magnet's sphere of influ-
ence. Move the magnet about and all the iron filings within
the field of the magnet respond. The iron fragments change
but the regular form-pattern continues the same. The mag-
netic forces of the bar determine the response. Similarly
the magnetic field of the human point of life
compels a
23
THE WEB OF THE UNIVERSE
corresponding response at the atomic level of the plane. To
change the simile the skill of an artist in painting does not
reside in his paint and implements, he does not need to carry
a
"
permanent
"
pencil or crayon about with him, the colour
and tools he uses respond to the living magnetic field of his
creative ability. The human aura in devachan displays the
permanent atom in terms of lines of force just as the active
field of a magnet may be seen by a clairvoyant without any
material filings.
Skandhas are those deeply impressed formations, in any
plane, made by human consciousness and held more or less
intact by the elemental life of the same plane over the interval
between lives.
They tend to attach themselves again to their
human creator when next he appears at the same level, as they
naturally are in tune with him and possibly with him alone.
The skandha is thus an artificial form held intact for a more
or less
lengthy period and may function as a mere tendency
and influence or act as a veritable
"
dweller on the threshold ".
The permanent atom and the skandhas are the formal
responses to the behaviour of consciousness; lack of skill is
represented by deficiences and possibly a tendency to distor-
tion. While being a useful convention as a term, the perma-
nent atom really represents a formal pattern imposed by the
electric, magnetic or vital forces which constitute the active
field, the aura, of a human being when using the personal
planes.
THE PLATONIC SOLIDS AND THE OCCULT CROSS
Our sense impressions are normally so direct, precise and
familiar that we take very much for granted that things are
what they seem until maybe an analysis is
prompted by
some startling statement we read or hear concerning the illu-
sions to which our senses are subject. Then perhaps for a
while we ponder the shadowy nature of material things
and, if
introspective, on the unreality of the world we live in.
Matter is said to be very different from that which we believed
SOME DESCRIPTIVE DEFINITIONS
it to be : our physical senses have deceived us thoroughly in
this : material is
really energy exhibiting itself, simply energy
and mental at that !
In recent years the reduction of material things into terms
of the mind has been the theme not only of philosophers,
religiously minded and otherwise, but of the practical and
exacting scientist.
"
The universe shows evidence of a designing or control-
ling power that has something in common with our own
individual minds.'
5 "
The universe can be best pictured as
consisting of pure thought.
" "
If the universe is a universe
of thought then its creation must have been an act of thought."
wrote Sir James Jeans in 1934 in The Mysterious Universe
(pp. 124-137). And Sir J. A. Thompson concluded a contri-
bution to The Great Design, published in 1934, with these
words :
"
we are led from our own mind back and back to the
Supreme mind,
'
without whom there was nothing made that
was made V Similar reflections are to be found in many
current scientific articles.
It is therefore an opportune moment to consider the rele-
vant information at hand from metaphysical and occult
sources and to point to the conclusions which may fairly be
drawn.
First we must touch on the well-known regular figures of
geometry known as the Platonic Solids, five in number,
which have in each case equal facets, equal angles and equal
lines. These five
regular solids are here illustrated (No. 3).
The tetrahedron, or four-sided figure, with which the
series
begins is also their basic form, as the four others may
all be constructed on combinations of the tetrahedron as
shown in the illustration.
Size is of no consequence; minute or huge the characteris-
tics
apply. It is therefore the interior structure that counts
and this is based on a centre whence lines ray out equally
25
THE WEB OF THE UNIVERSE
spaced. Such a figure is shown in No. 4, with six lines spring-
ing from the centre and touching the points of an octahedron,
the interior structure thereby forming a solid cross. About
the same cross a cube also can be built, because the octahedron
and the cube are complementary figures. The cube has six
sides and eight points (vertices) whereas the octahedron has
eight sides and six
points (vertices).
In occult science these regular figures are held to be symbols
of the Five Planes of Nature, thus :
Tetrahedron Atma : Dodecahedron Buddhi : Octahe-
dron Mental : Icosahedron Astral : Hexahedron (Cube)
Physical.
The implication is that the shape of the figure is related
intimately to the mode of motion, the tattva, that differenti-
ates one plane from another. In the definition given of the
tattva it will be remembered that the distinction between the
planes is one of motion, of specific vibratory measure called
a tattva, the planes differing radically in this respect. The
regular figures symbolise this distinction. In the tetrahedron
a flat
equal-armed cross is
suggested by its lines. Place, for
example, two match sticks across each other at right angles
in the middle, then raise one a short distance and in imagina-
tion connect the four extremities of the matches a tetrad is
formed. (Note, for example, the tetrahedron illustrated on
the second line of the illustration opposite). Two tetrahedra,
interlaced together as also shown, give the regular figure of
the cube if the eight points of the two interlocked tetrads be
joined. They indicate the octahedron too if the eight points
are taken as the middle of eight equilateral triangles, for the
triangles will precisely fit
together and an eight-sided regular
figure will be duly formed.
Further, inasmuch as both the icosahedron and dodecahe-
dron are built up on five interlaced tetrads (as shown on the
third line of the illustration), it is clear that all the regular
figures owe their formation to simple or compound crosses.
26
SOME DESCRIPTIVE DEFINITIONS
In other words, in terms of form, all the regular figures owe
their origin to a cruciform base.
The widespread symbolism of the cross, far ante-dating
the Christian era, has been consistently used to typify the
descent of life into matter or form and thus life's crucifixion
or imprisonment. The adoption and use of the cross-symbol
is well justified, for its
origin may be traced, as we shall see, to
the Web woven by Father-Mother, the planetary web that is
itself at the very root of material and hence of form.
Of the regular figures it is the octahedron that is of imme-
diate interest in our study.
Number Four
The six-armed cross inside, with arms of equal length at right
angles to each other, exactly fits each of these solid figures. In the
Octahedron the six arms touch the points and in the Cube the six
arms touch the middle of the facets. The two crosses are of the
same size.
The appropriateness of the eight-sided regular figure, the
octahedron, as representing the mental principle appeals at
once by virtue of its
double-pyramid appearance. No figure
could more aptly indicate the dual character of mind the
THE WEB OF THE UNIVERSE
higher and lower a duality, yet a unity. We need to
examine this regular figure closely.
The Octahedron has eight faces, each an equilateral tri-
angle, and six points. The six points represent the extremities
of a three-dimensional cross formed by three intersecting lines
at right angles to each other. We have therefore in the inte-
rior
supporting structure of the octahedron, at the heart of
and indeed the cause of its
being, three lines of extension
which correspond with what are popularly known as the
three dimensions of space. A central junction-point is
common to the three lines and this point well symbolises the
connecting link or portal between a world of form, repre-
sented by the regular figures, and the higher and formless
planes of life. In the diagram No. 10 this point corresponds
to the junction portal between Mental I and II. In the
division of the mental plane into higher and lower, three
sub-planes are allocated to the higher and four to the lower.
We will number them from the atomic or finest downwards
i, 2, 3, and 4, 5, 6, 7. Those called the 4th, 5th, 6th and yth
sub-planes in this classification constitute the field of the
Lower Mind H.P.B.'s Lower Manas. The intimate rela-
tion of these four sub-planes respectively with the junction-
point and the three intersecting right-angular lines is
very

appropriate, especially as the junction-point the bridge or
link between higher and lower answers exactly to the
characteristics of every
"
4th ", for the fourth term of any
septenary series exercises the function of a bridge. It links
together two opposites, in this case the higher and lower
mental planes. Such a link or bridge is a very important
factor in septenary systems.
Let us now attempt to visualise the truly amazing web or
fabric supporting the mental, the astral and the physical
planes, the substance for all the forms of the three worlds, the
canvas on and within which, as in a mirror, life
projects its
own picture.

CHAPTER III
THE WEB
THE
basic pattern of the Web is the six-armed Cross of
the octahedron, infinitely repeated, and appears as a
maze of exceedingly fine lines, interlaced in an infinitesimal
rectangular texture, ablaze with tiny points of brilliance
where die lines cross, filling,
*
permeating
'
all
space and
serving as the foundational structure for all material a
vision of mystery and wonder.

It
may be reasonably inferred that the Father-Mother (of
the Stanzas of Dzyan) are no other than Adi-Anupadaka
(See No. i, p. 14), the two highest principles of our Solar
Scheme, and that the Web actually represents, is indeed their
personal aspect or Lower Self. Such visions of the immedi-
acy and intimacy of the Divine Spirit as in Tennyson's
"
Closer is He than breathing and nearer than hands and
feet
"
would seem to derive their inspiration from this
omnipresent offspring of Solar parents.
This Web would seem to be the major of

to which H.P.B.
referred (S.D. ///, 592), for it

THE WEB
basic foundation for all manifestation as we know it. The*
junction-points of the three-dimensional crosses very aptly
represent the middle of the mental plane, the junction of
higher and lower manas, the threshold of the form-worlds,
for they are the very portals of approach between spirit
and
matter. The One Life becomes Many in terms of form
as it
alights at these portals of the Web to begin its far-reach-
ing excursion into the realm of separated form experiences.
The mechanism of the Web permits and invites an im-
mensely elaborate oratorio of manifestation yet itself
throughout remaining unaffected, unaffected as the strings
of a harp may be regarded as unchanged by the melody
arising from them. Rigid too as the strings of a well-tuned '
musical instrument yet with an infinitely varied capacity of
vibration.
An examination of the Web reveals that this vast fabric
woven by the Father-Mother of our system is
relatively fixed/
static, immovable. It is a unity which we all share, as rail-
way trains share a permanent way and motor-cars the roads.
Forms, whether of thought pulses, astral waves, or physical
spirals,
all
play through the Web as waves do through water,
wind through grass or corn, as the circling lights of a Picca-
dilly advertisement. The water, the grass and corn, the
light-bulbs of the advertisement, not one of these moves for-
ward though they all
appear so to do. And the forms which
use the Web are similar. All are modifications of the Web,
all use this responsive net-work, and all are, in a certain and
obvious sense, illusory. Thought seems to have the charac-
teristics of electric pulses through a wire, the emotions are
wavelike and undulatory, and physical matter shapes itself in
rings and spirals,
in unclosed spheres something like a thread
of cotton wound round a pencil. Hold a length of cotton at
both ends tightly, take a round pencil and turn the thread
once or twice round it and then move the pencil to and fro,
and the spiral of thread moves retaining accurately its
shape
though flowing along the cotton. Such illustrations and

experiments assist one to build an intellectual conception of
the Web though nothing within the range of our slow-
moving sense apparatus can convey the exquisite perfection
and delicacy of this skeleton framework, the stage on which
the living forms of consciousness dance in the ballet of life.
It must be clearly understood that the Web is sub-stance :
it is not itself that which we know as material but stands
under material. That which we call material is motion of
or within the Web in three characteristic modes. The Web
itself is the necessary and amazingly adequate background;
it
corresponds in purpose to the canvas of the painter, the clay
of the sculptor, language for the poet, the orchestra for the
musician, to the screen at the cinema, the carrier wave for
broadcasting. All these are the sub-stance that is
necessary
for art to manifest, that enables creation to be, to exist, to
stand forth. On the larger scale the Web corresponds to the
Aether of Space, to Mulaprakriti, to the Feminine Aspect.
In relation to the physical, astral and mental planes, the Web
is as the very Root of Matter.
The threejnodes of motion in the Web, the three tattvas,
offer a fascinating field of study. Thought, as initiated by
humanity when the higher-mind plays on the Web, moves
in straight lines and tends to reproduce itself on touching
another mental body much as the lines of light from a lan-
tern slide
reproduce the picture on reaching the screen.
Whether the reproduction is
"
received
"
by another's mind
depends entirely on development and acquired skill. In our
present cycle the reproduction by the large majority is
usually
ignored because of preoccupation, or is received merely as a
quite unconsciously registered influence.
The basic physical units (the occultist's ultimate physical
atoms), which in their aggregate make up what we call
phy-
sical matter, are produced by atmic force operating in spirals.
The wires of the Web do not move but the power current pur-
sues apparently a curved course, leaping spirally from junc-
tion-point to junction-point, dividing into three in between,
33 c
THE WEB OF THE UNIVERSE
passing along three connecting lines, to join up again at the
diagonally opposite corners of the cube.
The path taken by the triple force current is shown in the figures
above. The arrows indicate the three directions taken, which may
be described thus
One Third (say Red) travels Width-Height-Depth
One Third (say Yeo) travels Height-Depth-Width
One Third (say Blue) travels Depth-Width-Height
34
THE WEB
It will be noted that each colour is at right angles to the other two
all the way and each traverses the three dimensions. Further, if a
large number of models, in wire, similar to the above left-hand
figure, are assembled together, then it will be found that a triple
line, of the three colours, is traced in all directions. At the cross
over points only do the colours unite and the dominance of one
causes the spiral bias.
The flashes of light when the junction-points are touched
by the triple current alone mark the path taken, and these
appear like streaming beads of light in lines
spirally curved.
Three lines or pulses of this atmic force play side by side and
occasion in some way, possibly by induction, an additional
group roughly parallel with themselves hence is
produced

the physical atom itself, a complicated group of swiftly turn-
ing wavelets through the Web.
The apas tattva, the astral, is
quite different. This alone
appears to be an actual vibratory movement of the lines as
shown in Nos. 5 and 6. Buddhi-Astral are the life side of
the egoic and personal principles respectively and profoundly
affect the content of the Web. The impetus given at one
junction appears to be transmitted through the elastic frame-
work as a sound-wave is transmitted from one molecule to
another in air or steel. Such waves are those of emotion, which
are longitudinal in the framework of the Web. Electrical
pulses of thought and the spiral units displaying physical
inertia are, so to speak, the boundaries or extremes of the acti-
vity in the Web. Buddhi-Astral impulses constitute the life
side and are the important content of the Web, though very
dominantly astral in this cycle. Man, as the bridge between <
the spiritual
and the personal, has to forge the union
of these two principles, Buddhi-Astral, in himself and this
he must achieve through thought and action, through the
mind and the physical body, on the stage of the Web.
*
The lines of which this intricate mechanism is
composed
are seemingly rigid, taut-strung, yet exquisitely delicate and
fragile.
The fragility is an illusion, however, due to the
superlative sensitiveness of the glowing lines lines which are
not as a continuous thread but are the effect produced by
pulses of force of inconceivable number and rapidity. The
lines are spaced regularly apart, though the spacing must be
far smaller than even the order of atomic measurement.*
The Web appears to be relatively perfect in construction
perfect that is in the sense that a craftsman's tools may be per-
fectly suited to his craft. The trained and the untrained
workman though using exactly the same tools produce very
different results. The quality of the work turned out obviously
depends on the craftsman's skill. The same is it with any

musical instrument, say a finely built organ : the result when
the organ is used turns on the skill of the musician; the organ
is the same for beginner and expert. Applying these analogies
to the Web and our very amateur use of its wonderful con-
tent, the situation becomes clear, especially as we may well
regard the Web as an exquisitely tuned and responsive
musical instrument. It is we who make the disharmonies,
the strains and distortions; these are no more inherent in this
sub-stance of the worlds than faulty discords in the instru-
ments of an orchestra.
Such is a theory of the structure and nature of the under-
lying field, the basic canvas for the pictures of form. It is
this that furnishes the sub-stance on which everything in the
three worlds of the mental, astral and physical is built. For
the material of these worlds consists purely and wholly of
movements within the Web pulses, waves and spirals
which play freely and easily over and through the Web,
governed and limited only by the laws of its construction and
the skill of consciousness.
The figures reproduced overleaf have an interesting bear-
ing on our subject for they illustrate the extensive research
work being devoted to the structure of physical material.
The schematic representation of the atoms in a cubic
crystal such as of rock salt or of potassium chloride are
taken from the Chemical Society's Transactions, by Sir
William Bragg. They show the structure of crystalline
forms. Such forms are said to be based on what are called
space-lattice patterns. It is
significant that a modern theory
of spatially extended physical units should demand a back-
ing, a ground-plan as it were, of the cubic and regular spaced
character described As being that of the Web.

A propos of this and the possibility of something more than
physics being involved, the contribution of the Rt. Hon.
General Smuts to a discussion on The Evolution of the Uni-
verse (Britt. Assoc. 1931) is worth quoting. Referring to die
view a philosopher might take of the recent discoveries in
science, he said :
". . . the physicists, working merely with their own tools
and their own incomparable technique and looking for no
more than the metrical units which subtend this universe,
have indeed, like the man who looked for asses and found a
king, found much more than they have looked for. The
units they have discovered will constitute not only a world of
physics but, in the end and at far removes, also a world of
life and spirit.
. . .
"
These units, particularly the electron and quantum, have
an almost meta-physical aspect :
they are physics infected
with thought. . . .
"
Thus it comes that the ultimate units are not purely phy-
sical or material but point to an undifferentiated primitive
world matrix which includes both the physical and thought
characters of the world."
"
An undifferentiated primitive world matrix
"
surely here
is a finely intuitive grasp and understanding of a vast truth.
38
CHAPTER IV
MAN AND THE ELEMENTAL KINGDOMS
THE Web, described in the last chapter, is viewed as the
field or basic structure in which all involutionary and
evolutionary processes take place. The great waves of Life
from the Solar Logos, pregnant with the urge towards mani-
festation in form, are called during their first three stages of
descent
"
elemental kingdoms ". The relation of these three
kingdoms to those which are further advanced, such as the
mineral and plant, is shown on diagram No. 10. The first
elemental kingdom, shown as at the formless level, from our
point of view is
quite homogeneous in its nature though bear-
ing within it a pulsing, driving urge towards formal experi-
ence.*
The life of the second elemental kingdom, represented in
the same chart as on the way down to the third and the
mineral kingdom, is best viewed as an almost undifferentiated
ocean of consciousness with the divine urge to achieve separa-
tion into units aflame within it. Its field, that is its habitat and
home, is the Web associated with our earth. Its
primary and
impelling function is to seize any and every opportunity
afforded to enclose a movement within the Web with an
envelope that will veil the agitation off from the undifferen-
tiated ocean, and then to appropriate the isolated portion and
intensify its life. Thus is the elemental life enabled to acquire
a temporary abode for independent experiences. A form, any
sort or shape of form, is its
never-ceasing quest.
* As the human kingdom is the only other that touches the same level it is
humanity only that is able adequately to assist the first elemental kingdom to
descend. Every high inspiration to which human expression is
given in con-
crete mental terms also aids the first elemental kingdom. The benefit is mutual
though the goal of each kingdom is very different.

MAN AND THE ELEMENTAL KINGDOMS
The purpose of this diagram is to show the inter-relations of the
kingdoms of nature and the field covered by each. The formless
world of Life is shown as above the horizontal line marking the
middle of the mental plane. The first elemental kingdom (the
name given to Life at the higher mental level before consciousness
or awareness is born) and developed humanity are the only two
kingdoms that share this. Life there is
represented in the diagram
by points of light. Passing across the bridge (the cross at the
middle of the mental plane described in Chapter III),
Life enters
the second elemental kingdom of the lower mental plane, the
subtlest part of the three-fold world of form. The descent is con-
tinued, as shown by the arrows, to the third elemental kingdom
and on to the turning point of the whole vast cycle, the mineral
kingdom. With the stabilising assistance of dense physical bodies
Life becomes more and more consciously aware as it
passes
through plant and animal forms and acquires astral and mental
bodies in addition to the physical. In the human kingdom these
three personal bodies are more or less well defined and self-con-
sciousness is achieved. The difficult task now before man is that
of establishing self-consciousness at the higher mental level and,
with it, the realisation of his true nature.
Throughout, a pioneer humanity, few in number and during
the earlier stages not of our own human hierarchy, lead the way.
On the evolutionary cycle, with individuality achieved, man
again contacts these elemental kingdoms, for they use the same
planes and material forms as those of which his bodies are
made. It is the elemental essence, the life of the first, second
and third elemental kingdoms, which supplies him with his
mental, astral and physical
"
elementals ".
Trained by long association with animal bodies in earlier
cycles it is the
"
elemental
"
which instinctively and with
mechanical precision controls the so-called automatic func-
tions of the body such as digestion, circulation, etc.
The mental body of a human being may be likened to the
disturbed water around a swimmer in a lake. The water
immediately near is thrown into agitation, into small waves,
which travel outwards with diminishing force. The dis-
THE WEB OF THE UNIVERSE
turbed water around the swimmer, though part of the lake
and not really,
of course, to be separated from it, nevertheless
is
comparatively in a state of isolated agitation. The water
so disturbed well serves to illustrate what is meant by a mental
body. This simile is
particularly applicable concerning the
mental plane because of the reaction as described above of the
elemental life.
Seizing the opportunity with eagerness it
isolates and emphasises the locus of disturbance, and this
becomes an enclosed abode, a body, which to human con-
sciousness with mental sight is a perfectly clear mental
form.
In the same fashion every thought, itself an electric genera-
tion within the limits of the mind-body, tends to become
separated, though in the great majority of cases it will be
speedily dissipated because of the slightness of motive and
consequent lack of stability. But if the same type of thought
be repeatedly strengthened it is
quite possible and indeed
common for the elemental life to achieve a semi-independent
department in the mind-body where this specialised activity
may remain isolated. The human mind may thus become
partitioned within itself, indeed frequently is. Hence the
origin of fixed ideas, prejudices, divided personalities, com-
plexes of every kind, which modify and colour anything
received that is allied to that department of thought much as
tinted glasses colour the light seen.
The emotional element in all such happenings and experi-
ences must be included in our understanding of these phe-
nomena, for the third elemental kingdom of the astral plane,
itself one stage nearer its
objective, the mineral kingdom, aids
and abets its brother the elemental life of the second kingdom
(manas) and gains an intense measure of experience itself
by
sharing the forms so diligently manufactured by the human
mind both without and within itself.
In view of the perfectly legitimate drive of these two ele-
mental kingdoms towards separated forms and hence keener
experiences, it is obvious that this downward or outward urge
42
MAN AND THE ELEMENTAL KINGDOMS
of the elemental life of the bodies has to be met and overcome
by human consciousness. Humanity, on the upward arc,
seeking unity and brotherhood, is in an exceedingly difficult
situation. Everything is alive and the life of the very
vehicles he has to use in that upward climb is itself headed
in the opposite and downward direction. Man has not
only to overcome this contrary motion but has himself to
mount by its aid. It is
very much as if one were faced with
the task of walking up an escalator that was moving down !
Doubtless, given a sufficient incentive, such a climb would be
managed readily. But the incentive in the case of man has
to be evoked from within himself, and even when evoked
must be followed by intimate experience and knowledge to
become compelling. An understanding of the meaning of
Good and Evil can arise in those who grapple with and solve
the problem of man's relation to these elemental forces. Both
the elemental life and man are using the mysterious Web; it
is their common field, but their objectives are at opposite
poles.
Including as it does all human and elemental experience,
the emotional and mental content of the Web at large con-
stitutes the equivalent of the term the racial unconscious in
present day psychology. The individual human conscious-
ness establishes a relationship between itself and the content of
the Web through mento-astral activity. This is
greatly
assisted by the isolating agility of the elementals and by their
repetitive habits, which we call automatic thinking. The
relationship is thus secured by means of a floating form, the
individual's own auric body, which moves freely and easily
through the Web. The idea of a relatively fixed shape mov-
ing in changing material has been illustrated already by the
movement of a twist of string around a pencil. A further
illustration is that of the shape given to a quantity of dry
leaves and dust by a scurrying wind. The vortex of air is
outlined clearly by the rapidly changing particles. So does
the auric body of man (his astro-mental body) move through
43
THE WEB OF THE UNIVERSE
the Web, its
shape being determined by his own habitual
reactions to his environment.
Whenever the attention of an individual wanes, and ceases
to vivify any part of his auric body, this drops away from the
field of his immediate conscious perception and becomes more
or less unconscious, though still
potentially linked to his auric
life
through the previous contact. This is the personal uncon-
scious, which can be recalled into direct focus, with greater or
less
difficulty, according to the conditions so much investi-
gated by psycho-therapists.
Light can be thrown upon the intricate nature of the un-
conscious mind if the constitution of the Web and the play of
the individual mind through it are taken into consideration.
All beyond the periphery of the personal mind is in the ocean
of pulsing life in the Web, and yet can play upon the indivi-
dual because mento-emotional contacts between the world-
mind and the individual consciousness are continually being
made at the psychic levels in addition to the familiar sense-
contacts of physical experience.
Any response, slight or vivid, made by the man's own men-
tal and emotional aura to this surrounding ocean would seem
naturally to arise
"
in his mind
"
involuntarily. At present
physical contact by the senses of hearing, touch, sight, taste
and smell alone are easily cognised as external. Yet by a
very little cultivation of one's interior mental and emotional
faculties, as apart from the physical, the existence of this vast
exterior ocean of active thought and emotion can be verified.
And in a very interesting manner too, for one needs only to
concentrate intently on a particular subject of interest and the
mental body becomes tuned in to thought pulses and emo-
tional waves allied to that subject. Distance, though not
negligible, is not very marked under these conditions, but
results depend apparently on the degree of sensitivity to
which the mind is trained. Responding thus to world-
thought on similar lines and wave-lengths one's knowledge
and understanding may expand, theoretically, to an extent
44
MAN AND THE ELEMENTAL KINGDOMS
that is unlimited or rather, limited only by the content of the
world's Web. This exercise is of course something more
than mere introspection, more than an exploration of one's
own mental content.*
Fortunately, perhaps, extreme sensitivity is difficult to
achieve. The world would be a very trying place in which to
live were it
easy ! But the process can be tested amply enough
and proved by anyone exercising some perseverance. We all
share the world's unconscious mind together.
Similarly but conversely man's individual mind can influ-
ence the contents of the Web profoundly. The higher mind
with its
flashing speed can mould forms in mental material
on the responsive and retentive canvas of the Web as readily
and easily as the voice modifies the carrier wave from a broad-
casting studio. As the beam from a lantern illumines the
darkness of night so may the inner light, focused by the
higher mind, illumine and clarify the mental atmosphere of
the Web. Much of this is however for the future, for
thought-power demands the leaven of wisdom and the subtler
worlds still await scientific exploration by man.
The separating veil between a man's mental body and the
ocean of semi-conscious life
composing the second and third
elemental kingdoms is both valuable and necessary, but it
also contributes a serious obstacle to release. Its value is
inestimable during man's earlier incarnations because the veil
isolates consciousness and compels concentration and self-
awareness. This very virtue tends however later to make for
self-assertion, egotism and a generally aggressive attitude if
the separative effort of the elemental life is not understood
and combated.
The reiterated advice given so constantly in truly occult
teachings which urges the cultivation of poise and balance,
the well-known middle way of Buddhism, is
given partly
because the premature breaking down of this protective veil
is
fraught with danger. Even the thinning of the veil risks

a too easy contact with the numerous thought-forms and
emotional surges of the inner planes unless the individual
mind is in some measure already controlled. One of the early
steps in gaining such control appears to be the achievement
of a certain flexibility
of mental habit in place of frozen fixi-
ties, followed by the development of deliberately self-chosen
thinking. One's mind then responds to and entertains
thoughts and feelings only of one's very own choosing. This
is an extremely difficult task because of the intense activity of
the elemental life both within and without the personal veil.
"
As hard to curb as the wind ", exclaimed Arjuna of the
Ehagavad Gita, and all who try it are inclined to echo his
complaint !
But one immense consolation at least emerges from a study
and appreciation of the mysteries of the Web it is that the
normal condition of the Web is static. It is not the* instru-
ment that is
responsible for annoyance or pleasure but the
player. It is not the basic fabric that we have to control but
a fellow-user, to wit, the second elemental kingdom, another
traveller, one moreover who is destined to become the most
obliging and obedient servant conceivable and a marvellously
skilful craftsman under the creative direction of man. The
relationship between humanity and the elemental kingdoms
may become similar to that between a highly skilled con-
ductor and a finely trained orchestra.
The relation of the higher mind to the lower has been de-
scribed as resembling that between a pencil point and paper
the pencil point being formless yet capable of building form.
This relationship is so true that we must pursue it further.
The activity of the higher mental is in fact and deed the
activity of a point, a focused point of light. The appropriated
atom of the mental plane, called the mental permanent atom,
is as a lens, a flashing centre of activity, focusing the buddhic
ray of light from the monad. When a human being is on the
way to a re-incarnation the field of force playing within the
Web assembles a mental sheath or body, which body tends to

MAN AND THE ELEMENTAL KINGDOMS
limit and concentrate the range of the permanent atom and
slow down its tremendous natural speed. But however
highly organised that appropriated mental body may become,
throughout all incarnations and all
experiences the egoic
mental centre remains in itself a free though focused point of
light. This remains true no matter how successful may be
its identification with bodies and a personality.
The identification of the point of mental consciousness with
its forms is
really and merely a deeply printed illusion of con-
sciousness, an illusion that has to be transcended at long last
in the human kingdom by the /^//-imposed discipline of
meditation. As a focus of buddhic light, and hence of the
very nature of light, the higher mental centre can move with
the speed of light. This terrific
speed is the main obstacle to be
overcome in the change from life to consciousness, from mere
life at large to life aware that it is alive. Therefore the value
of the Web, the net, in which the souls of men are caught, as
Egyptian symbology has it.
The limitations imposed and the privations experienced in
the forms of the personality built in the Web compel com-
paratively slow and ponderous responses. The privations at
length achieve the purpose set : life
passes into consciousness
(awareness) and consciousness into self-awareness until, in
humanity, as more and more freedom is achieved, release
from the illusions imposed by forms becomes possible.
From these illusions it is however desperately difficult
entirely to escape. The active higher mental centre is
by now
so supremely skilful in the art of producing forms easily and
readily in the responsive medium of its
department of the
Web that to withdraw, consciously to withdraw, from the
mentally complexed net is
exceedingly hard. For that mat-
ter, in terms of the greater cycles and the unfoldment of the
powers latent in human consciousness, this achievement of
withdrawal is a task quite legitimately to be achieved in
future cycles by the vast majority. But it can undoubtedly
be done now. The physical world for humanity is
already
47
THE WEB OF THE UNIVERSE
objective, the physical body itself is
becoming objective;
release from identification with the astral and mental bodies
will render them objective too and the self can then be
realised as spirit.
Karma, usually translated as the law of cause and effect,
reaction to action, becomes now more readily understand-
able. Every personal activity in the Web, whether mental,
emotional or physical, modifies the corresponding vibra-
tional measure of the Web, the tattva of the plane. And the
law is that every such modification is
subtly and indissolubly
connected with its creator until unravelled and dissipated.
Skandhas, as they are called, are simple or severe distortions
in the Web, held intact and separate by the eager elemental
life, which by their very origin and nature are tuned in to
their creator and tend to react on him. Action and reaction
are equal and opposite and the fruits of his personal action
may be either
"
good
"
or
"
bad ". Strain or distortion is
occasioned if there be any element of personal attachment
to the thought, feeling or deed. It may be of trifling
moment or strongly impressed, easily rectified or of long
duration. Only in the case of action initiated utterly self-
lessly, that is, with no hooking back of the interest or intention
upon its creator, is there no magnetic tie and that means
that the motive is buddhic, i.e., it has its
origin in the uni-
versal consciousness, and such an action is that of a Saviour.*
Yet personally motived action, with a full content of selfish
acquisitiveness, has its
indispensable place in the early stages
of human consciousness to ensure that the mental and
emotional bodies shall be well defined and rigidly limited, in
order firmly to foster and establish clear cut individualisation.
Hence the succession of legitimate incentives cited in the
ancient laws of conduct for the four castes :
(i) Sensory Plea-
sure, (2) Wealth, (3) Fame, (4) Service.
Unless individuality be thoroughly well-founded there is
* "
Having abandoned attachment to the fruit of action . . . he is not
doing anything although doing actions." Bhag. Gita 4.20.
MAN AND THE ELEMENTAL KINGDOMS
apt to be an absence of personal incentive, few

"
and little real experience. The Satanic Hierarchy, the mighty
Asuras, fortunately have successfully guarded against many
failures arising from this cause among our own human hier-
archy by the intensity with which individual consciousness
has been developed under their tutelage; its
price however
is that their very success has bred a momentum from which
we find it hard in this cycle to attain release.

CHAPTER V
CONSCIOUSNESS AND THE DIMENSIONS OF
SPACE
T? NTERING on the cycles of involution and evolution,
XL Life in the first instance alights at the junction-point
portals of the Web and then proceeds to explore and annex its
new and entrancing territory. The procession through the
kingdoms of form is led by skilled human pioneers who, on
the previous Chain of Globes, had had experience in form
mastery. A new land, the dense physical world, has in the
course of this Chain to be entered, inhabited and mastered,
as also the already familiar corridor of approach through the
lower mental, the astral and the etheric.
The mineral, plant and animal forms, built up during
vastly extensive periods of time, permit life to apprehend the
three dimensions of space in succession. Indeed not till the
true archetypal form of the human being is attained is the
whole of spatial extension embraced.
To understand this mystery it is
necessary to pause here and
consider the problem of consciousness in relation to the
dimensions of space. Forms are built from a centre outwards
the first centres to be used being those innumerable junc-
tion-points of the Web prepared by Father-Mother. Here
life
begins its
journey through the forms of the kingdoms
of nature and spends the whole of the first Round in achiev-
ing the unit of organised form the cell. In the second
Round the cell has become the unit of form growth as the
result of the inter-play of the third and second Aspects of
the Solar Logos. Though there is a deal of overlapping, for
life knows no absolute boundaries, we may take it that the
mineral form is dominant in the first Round, the plant form
in the second and the animal form in the third. In the
50
CONSCIOUSNESS AND THE DIMENSIONS OF SPACE
fourth Round, the present one, the human form is at length
achieved though not as we know it till the third and fourth
Races of our own world occupation.
The building and establishment of the earlier kingdoms
is described therefore in Theosophical literature as having
taken the first three Rounds of our Chain to accomplish
and even they are held to be comparatively rapid recapitula-
tions of the vast work of the first three Chains. When in the
fourth Round our world was reached, the first three Root-
Races again rapidly recapitulated the work of the three earlier
Rounds, hence not till the fourth Race was reached on the
earth was positively new work undertaken. And in the
fourth Race, following the successful and long-prepared-for
"
descent
"
of the human form, the whole three-dimensional
world of the mental, astral and physical planes is at length,
through the elaborate mechanism of the truly human being,
for the first time within Life's grasp.
That the succession of the kingdoms described above and
the final arrival of human consciousness in a human form
may be clearly followed it will be useful to trace the successive
advances made by Life through the forms of the kingdoms
to its ultimate victory over the so-called three dimensions of
space. Incidentally the real meaning of what is meant by a
fourth dimension may emerge.
By the term dimensions of space we really mean extensions
of matter, and if we analyse this latter term we shall resolve
it into motion of a point or points motion in three directions
that we call
height, breadth, and depth. These popularly are
the three dimensions of space and mathematically, not
actually, may be regarded as arising in succession height
being due to the motion of a point in one direction, which
we call a line; breadth being due to the motion of this line
at right angles to itself, which we call a surface; and depth
being the movement of this surface, again at right angles
to itself, which we call a solid. These are the three dimen-
sions.
THE WEB OF THE UNIVERSE
The fourth dimension theory is that there may be a further
movement at right angles to the three-dimensional solid
figure, a movement or extension obviously not possible to
trace, but nevertheless, it has been claimed, following as a
natural, reasonable and logical sequence to the first three
movements. A wealth of delightful and fascinating analo-
gies has been built up on the imagined relations of the inhabi-
tants of flatland, i.e., a two-dimensional world with those of
a one-dimensional world on the one hand and our three-
dimensional world on the other. The theory has the air of
being based on the essence of sound reasoning; it is attractive,
explanatory, and at first somewhat captivating.
Yet is it none
the less
misleading and fallacious, for it is an attempt to
identify the attributes of Life with the figures of Form and,
however willingly we grant that behind the words fourth
dimension there stands something that is real, it is of impor-
tance that that reality should be described in terms of Life or
consciousness and not be regarded as a further extension of
matter or Form. (" Time
"
in this connection is another story.)
Without pausing to inquire what becomes of the funda-
mental simplicity of the unity on which the Universe is based
if dimensions are multiplied ad infinitum, let us examine
briefly the popular argument. The approach to the imagin-
ary fourth dimension by its advocates is
usually by way of the
first, second and third. The reader is introduced to an
imaginary linear world and then to a flatland of two dimen-
sions, described in detail and with much ingenuity, and thus
on to our own familiar world the land of solids.
By the
help of numerous analogies the student is instructed to attempt
a conception of a four-dimensional world. At first
sight all
the difficulty appears to reside only in this last effort, but a
little
thought will convince one that the linear world and
flatland are just as impossible of conception! In terms of
form they can themselves have no independent existence. To
picture flatland the reader is invited to imagine a plane sur-
face with paper squares and triangles upon it, or smooth water
CONSCIOUSNESS AND THE DIMENSIONS OF SPACE
with the thinnest of films moving over it. Quite a comfort-
ably easy task, but it is not flatland because all such super-
imposed divisions involve at once a third dimension.
A three-dimensional world of form is indeed the only one
conceivable, for a line is die boundary of a surface and has no
existence apart from a surface; a surface is the boundary of a
solid and has no existence apart from a solid. The solid form
contains the three dimensions, and all manifest not succes-
sively but together, springing equally and simultaneously full-
grown from the Creative Source, for they correspond to the
triune nature of the One Life, to the triple attributes of every
unity.
Now consider the relation of Life to Form and we shall
readily understand the succession of the dimensions in terms
of consciousness and what is meant by the fourth factor.
Life enters the threefold form world impelled, first, to re-
spond to it
through the vehicle adopted achieving conscious-
ness, awareness, in the process and then to master it. Life
may be depicted on the preliminary formless level as centred
in nuclei or points of pure being (jivas) whose Will-to-live
finds its field of expression in Form for all that may be en-
countered within the ring-pass-not of the form worlds is to be
rendered subject to that Will. These points of Being become
units of consciousness on meeting the resistance offered by
material, though the growth of the quality of awareness is
slow.
The whole journey may be regarded as accomplished in
seven stages and the succession is best expounded with the
help of diagram No. n.

the veil of matter. Position is achieved, little else. Concious-
ness is of the slightest for
"
God sleeps in the Mineral ".
This slight consciousness however means a probing in the
three directions or extensions of matter and hence the begin-
nings of mineral form centres, axes of vibration, geometrical
activity. Life in the mineral kingdom has attained localisa-
tion or position and some, but very little, conscious extension.
Hence its
symbol is the point that which has position but no
magnitude.
(J3) Continuing its excursion and succeeding in definitely
appropriating an extension along a single line, the pioneering
Life identifies itself with it and senses one dimension : that
is, it becomes conscious by its
ability, through a single line as
a vehicle, to respond slightly to one mode of motion. This is
linear consciousness and the kingdom of which this is
typical
is the vegetable. We may trace this to-day in the vegetable
life which, starting from a centre (seed), clothes itself in a form
that strikes down and up. Through the earlier progress of
this kingdom these thrusting extremities of root, stem and
branches, traversing one dimension, may be regarded as the
sensitive organs of plant consciousness.
(C) The third stage, C in the chart, corresponds to animal
consciousness, to which two dimensions are objective. Con-
sciousness is
feeling its
way forward, living the more keenly
as sensation increases. Sensation awakens desire and aversion
and these enhance experience so that consciousness tends con-
tinually to identify itself more thoroughly with its instrument
of sensation. The visual organ of the animal body presents
consciousness with only a flat
picture; and, as the average
animal is unaided by any considerable mental development,
perception must necessarily be limited to height and breadth
the conscious outlook being thus practically superficial.
The diagram therefore depicts this consciousness as two-
dimensional.
(D) In the next period of development the three dimensions
are apprehended by virtue of the development of mentality
55
THE WEB OF THE UNIVERSE
height, breadth and depth begin in a measure to be all
objective. Self-consciousness becomes established as the
human form, held at the archetypal level in the Divine Mind,
is
projected outward and descends into formal manifestation.
Life in the human kingdom responds to the three modes of
motion, embraces the three dimensions, functions through
three vehicles, effects relations with the whole of the threefold
world of form and is enabled thereby to distinguish between
its own densest vehicle and others. This achieved awareness
of isolation from other forms spells self-apprehension. The
unit of consciousness itself remains always as a living point
only and is
engaged throughout the outward journey (in the
diagram, A, B, C and half-way through D) in becoming
acquainted and identified with the three-dimensional world
of form, learning through its
appropriated and intimate
vehicle to vibrate in sympathy with its environment. It is
essential to remember that it is awareness, consciousness, that
progresses through the form dimensions and not the forms
themselves; they are, strictly speaking, always three-dimen-
sional.
At this periphery of the form-worlds the attention of the
unit of Consciousness is devoted to externals, i.e., to the
environment. This is the inevitable result of the long and
successful training received in its
journey from the point stage
to an apprehension of the three-dimensional solid, through-
out which the spiritual urge has been outwards. Broadly
speaking, this is the position of humanity to-day. The re-
turn journey has now to be undertaken; for, after the critical
self-conscious stage is
successfully established following the
apprehension of the threefold world, there follows the task
of mastery and subjection.
"
Matter must become the obe-
dient servant of the Spirit."
(E) We come now to the crucial part of this exposition, for
this step is the first on the return journey and corresponds
to that usually associated with a fourth dimension erron-
eously so called, for the process is
clearly one involving the
56
CONSCIOUSNESS AND THE DIMENSIONS OF SPACE
partial mastery of our three-dimensional world of the three
planes and is not a further excursion of consciousness through
another extension of form.
To appreciate this stage it is
necessary to pause in order first
to understand clearly the mechanism involved in sense-res-
ponse. Let us take the sense of sight as typical.
On the phy-
sical level we
"
see
"
because the retina of the eye responds
to light and shade. It is this reproduction made by our appro-
priated
vehicle that enables us to see. And, if we examine it,
we shall find that the visual reproduction amounts only to a
picture in two dimensions, and even this is due entirely to
light reflected from the surface of the object. So much for
the mechanical process which represents but a part of the art
of
"
seeing ". To this part the man applies his mentality and
having by its means acquired three-dimensional perception
at once interprets the simple picture in terms of perspective,
imposing depth by the action of his mind. In other words
the retinal picture is
reproduced in the mind body a
material vehicle as already described and displayed there in
three dimensions; and moreover the object is seen, not by
means of an external light, projecting a flat
picture only, but
by virtue of its own luminosity. At present the vast majority
of humanity see the exterior of the object only; but actually
the content of the whole is
reproduced, for the interior of
the three-dimensional image presented is within the mind
too.
The point of Consciousness, which is the true man, plays
freely within his own vehicle and can view this image in any
part or as a whole at will. The measure of his training will
determine the accuracy of the reproduction and the value of
his
perception. In the process of developing interior sight
there are certain to be many errors of reading. The stand-
point assumed by a trained consciousness whcrefrom to view
such a reproduction within the subtle vehicle of his own mind
is
naturally the centre and the whole interior of the image
is
displayed to such a consciousness at once. Front, back, sides
57
THE WEB OF THE UNIVERSE
and interior are all
equally perceived and hence there is
abundant possibility of confusion and misunderstanding.
Nature provides, however, a valuable corrective, which saves
the situation. Just as in the physical eye there is a minute spot
on the retina affording intense focal definition the enor-
mous benefits of which by the way we hardly appreciate so
in the astro-mental vehicle there is a centre of special visual
sensitiveness. Playing through this localised centre Consci-
ousness gains clarity at the cost of some limitation a cost
very well worth incurring. For instead of attempting the
impossible task of grasping the three dimensions at once, as
might be inferred, Consciousness masters one dimension at a
time. It becomes itself
depth, so to speak, by virtue of the
flashing speed of the
4t
point
"
of life, and thus senses every-
thing displayed in terms of two dimensions. Hence in the
diagram () Consciousness is shown as being the dotted
line
(depth) and as seeing objectively only breadth and
height. This becoming means in practical terms that the
higher mental point of consciousness responds to the whole
of depth very rapidly and yet consciously. The so-called
fourth-dimensional Consciousness is
really
a return to two-
dimensional objectivity with the acquisition of one dimen-
sion mastered. Consciousness in short has become a third
part of its environment and can reproduce this third
correctly, instantaneously and completely at will.
(F) The next step,
the mastery of another dimension
breadth, is
perhaps rather difficult to follow intellectually,
though a simple illustration will assist, for at this step two
dimensions become consciously assimilated, one only remain-
ing objective. Take a page of print and hold it so as to fore-
shorten it to extreme by looking almost at the bottom edge;
the whole of the text of many lines will be foreshortened
apparently into one line one dimension. The experiment
faintly suggests stage F if it be further supposed that the ex-
panded consciousness can read the whole page as if it were the
one line. At this stage two dimensions will have been mas-
58
CONSCIOUSNESS AND THE DIMENSIONS OF SPACE
tered and form phenomena may be comprehended in one
synthetic dimension only.
(G) Consciousness at this stage is
represented as having taken
the final step of the series. Three dimensions are now mas-
tered and the formless level is
again attained. The units of
life are responsive to all within the limits of the ring-pass-not,
they are masters of all the forms of the threefold world, they
can consciously move at the same or a greater speed than can
material and hence can embrace within themselves all the
possibilities
of the three extensions of matter. The Points in
this sense are omnipresent and hence have become the Sphere.
Consciousness is thus shown as having traced its
way
through the kingdoms, encountering and grappling with the
resistances of worlds of form, apprehending their threefold
character in successive stages. At the limit of its outward
sweep Consciousness achieves awareness of itself and proceeds
to the mastery of Forms in similar successive stages, inversely
this time, by transmuting their extensions into conscious
interior experience.
59
CHAPTER VI
MAN'S ORIGINS
THE theory that Man is the product and capital of an
end-on evolutionary column, rising in a more or less
sequential series from earlier kingdoms of nature, held the
field in the nineteenth century. Though challenged now
from many angles, particularly from the results of biological
and anatomical research, the theory has not yet given place
in the popular mind to any other as acceptable nor to any-
thing seemingly so well founded. Yet the many theoretical
structures, based on the facts and inferences of Lamarck's and
Darwin's works, have been found wanting, indeed no wholly
satisfactory edifice has arisen from them.
In the Secret Doctrine',
published in 1889, Mme. Blavatsky
challenged the current theories. She wrote :
"
The esoteric teaching is
absolutely opposed to the Dar-
winian evolution, as applied to man, and partially so with
regard to other species." S.D. II, p. 689.
"
That man was not the last member of the mammalian
family, but the first in this Round, is
something that Science
will be forced to acknowledge one day." II, p. 164.
"
The Occult Doctrine maintains that the mammalians
were a later work of evolution than man." //, p. 190.
"
Man has been on earth, in this Round, from the begin-
ning." //, p. 265.
This is a revolutionary view to-day even though in every other
theory of man's origin many flaws have been found and
exposed.
That the ape is descended from man, is indeed decadent
man, has long been suspected though the more widely held
view still is that man and ape derive from a common stock.
60
MAN'S ORIGINS
Mme. Blavatsky's statements are far more searching. If
they
can be shown to be even theoretically sound a vista opens to
the sources of human origins which may well deserve the
term spiritual. Their revolutionary character need not deter
us in view of the many reversals of opinion that already have
been adopted.
Consider for a moment the reversals we consistently have
made as consciousness functions in an increasing measure at
the higher mental level and hence becomes more detached
from the forms immediately at hand. It is a commonplace
of modern psychology that when an unconscious condition is
genuinely externalised and we see ourselves definitely as
separate from it all its values tend to be altered. So in the
history of human thought. As we have developed the capa-
city for larger views, concepts based on previous experiences
frequently have had to be reversed. The flat earth of our early
personal judgment, for instance, has long become a sphere;
our planet is not, as once was vigorously believed, stationary
and geocentric but circles round the sun ;
the consciousness
of a child is not now regarded as an empty vessel requiring
to be filled so much as an abounding treasure-house needing
release; medical treatment and healing generally are becom-
ing more and more an interior mental and emotional art
concerned with psychological processes, in place of a purely
exterior physical science; the penal code is
beginning to
recognise the need for education in place of mere reprisal; the
very Deity is
vacating the distant skies for the heart of man;
these and many other reversals are evidences of the rectifi-
cation of earlier errors as our view-point advances. To reverse
the position of man on the evolutionary ladder and place him
on the top-most rung, precedent to any form-manifestation as
we know it, may well prove to be the solution of the many
problems relating to his origin.
The occult teaching in its broadest application is indeed
that man himself represents the archetype whence all
nature's forms derive.
61
THE WEB OF THE UNIVERSE
Almost in these words H.P.B. sums up her views on human
origins. In one passage, after lengthy references to many
ancient myths, sagas and legends, most of them claimed to be
concerned with the same mystery teaching, she states :
". . . all have an identical meaning and relate to the pri-
mordial Archetypal Man, the Creative Origin of all
things."
S.D., Vol. I, p. 478.,
and
"
. . . these represent primarily the Archetypal Man,
the Protologos." p. 380.
A note here is
necessary respecting the application of the
term Man. It is used in the Secret Doctrine to include a great
deal more than a human being as we know him. To-day
man is our own fourth Creative Hierarchy and wears the
familiar human form. To the occult student the term man
denotes a state of consciousness and not a particular form.
The man of any period is
given this title because he performs
a particular function, that of bridging the highest forces con-
tacted in that cycle to the lowest. In the chart that follows
an attempt is made to show the work of the various humani-
ties or Creative Hierarchies of the four Chains already mani-
fested in our Solar Scheme. From this it will be seen that the
forms used by each humanity are the pioneer experiment of
the Chain : once achieved they are thrown off by the pioneer
and used by less evolved types of consciousness. The suc-
cessful humanity of the period moves on to other creative
efforts.
This chart shows the relation between members of the
human kingdom and the forms used on the four Chains of
our Scheme. It is said that, though the greater number of a
successful humanity from a Chain of globes may pass on to
other spheres of activity,
a part elects to stay and assist the
Life of the succeeding Chains and fill
particular Offices in
their government, as Asuras, etc.

overlapping demanded by the Life . As the archetypal human form gradually
descended from the higher mental plane to the dense physical frequent
advances were made far beyond the forms related to the Chain cycles above.
On Chain III for instance it is said that human forms on the etheric plane
and verging on the dense physical were achieved by advanced human beings
of that Chain. The above chart should be taken as indicating averages only.
THE WEB OF THE UNIVERSE
The statement that man stands at the head of the stream
of life, is the origin himself of nature's forms, is indeed start-
ling; yet a familiar analogy gives point and reason to this
view. An architect, in process of designing a building, men-
tally pictures a plan and an elevation, with their embellish-
ments, and then reduces these three-dimensional conceptions
to the symbols of line and colour on two-dimensional paper.
Various craftsmen then interpret the design given and
embody it in physical material. The mental creation comes
first, then the design symbolised in line and curve, then the
edifice. The architect begins his proj
ection into obj
ecti
vity by
creation on the mental level, and the mental forms, three-
dimensional on their own plane, are as objective there as the
finished building is in the physical world.
Thought of this nature always precedes physical action and
the occult student recognises that such deliberately created
mental forms are as independently real and self-contained in
the architect's mental field as the later construction in stone
and timber is in the physical world. All this, of course, may
be applied to the creative activity of every artist whatever his
medium. One point in this
analogy needs specially to be
stressed and that is that the artist's mental creation is of the
nature of an archetype. This means that it is an original type
or form-pattern from which certain structures may be pro-
jected by action. Experiments or try-outs with the structure
in a physical medium, whether the artist be architect, painter,
poet or musician, will result in many modifications, many
changes, till the artist achieves some measure of success in
portraying an aspect of his creation. Whatever the final
result the archetype is the mental model from which the
result is derived and is the cause of its
appearance, though a
host of such projected exhibits may be needed adequately to
manifest the original archetype.
The application of this analogy is far reaching, but there is
probably little need to labour it for the sequence of mental
conception to physical expression is within the experience
MAN'S ORIGINS
of all and quite familiar. Substitute for the architect in our
analogy a Super-Being who, having conceived of a solar
system and carried it into manifestation to the stage of a
thought-form of our world, constructs in thought a living
miniature of his own creative capacities, namely archetypal
man, to serve as a progenitor for the living forms of that
world and we have a picture somewhere near the theory
submitted.
A diagram displaying the successive stages of descent of the
archetype and its successful projection at the fourth stage
will assist in following this sequence. (See No. 12).
Let us now look a little more closely at the forms built and
used as bodies by the human hierarchies of the earlier Chains.
The first
globe to be manifested in form was, as already
shown (Chart No. 2), of mental material, based on th*~ Web
and serving the purpose of a planetary mind. This was the
field wherein manifestation began, for it
provided the mirror
in which subjective Life could reflect itself as objective Form.
Life, or Light, became focused therein. It is arrested by this
fabric and gyrates, flashing from focused centres along
radii and around orbits.

The numbers i to 7 indicate the seven successive Rounds of our
Chain. Archetypal man is shown as gradually achieving clear
re-presentation in physical material. In Round I the form that we
now call the mineral was established by pioneer man at the mental
level and was the dominant factor in that Round. In Round II
the plant form at the astral level was the most significant form.
In Round III
similarly the animal up to and including the rep-
tilian
type, at the etheric level, was the focal experiment. In
Round IV the erect human form in physical material is established,
and is maintained through the next three Rounds till the end of
the Chain. Solar energy plays continuously from above and,
after Round II, lunar and terrene energy from below. The centres
awakened and localised in the physical body, itself a miniature
synthesis of the whole, are named in the last column of the diagram.
In the fourth Round the ist, 2nd, 3rd and 4th Root-Races
of our current world occupation were rapid recapitulations
of the completed work of the earlier Rounds. Hence the
figures 5, 6, 7, symbolising the later Rounds, must be understood
as indicating developments very much of the future, and success-
fully to be achieved, for the majority of our human race, only in
the 5th, 6th and 7th Rounds respectively, hence not on this globe
in the present Round except by the adventurous few. Our 5th,
6th and 7th Root-Races are and will be merely brief rehearsals of
the great play set to be staged in the last three Rounds.

SOUND FIGURES PRODUCED BY THE VOICE
Geometrical figures, outlined in sand, produced by the vibra-
tion of a glass or rubber disc will be familiar to many. A violin
bow drawn across the edge of a glass plate or the human voice
sounded into a vessel covered with rubber sheeting are the usual
means employed to obtain the effects illustrated in No. 14 above.
Mrs. Watts Hughes, many years since, carried out some fascinating
experiments in the production of such forms with the voice, in sand
or fine
powder, as also in a semi-fluid medium. The above repro-
duction of voice figures and the beautiful tree form, No. 22, are
from her monograph, Eidophonc Voice Figures. The form build-
ing power of the waves of sound which can be generated by the
human voice is in close illustration of the relation of Life to Form,
of the Cosmic Breath to the fabric of the Web. The resemblance
of these voice-built forms to crystal and plant structures is
very
striking and lends significance and meaning to the many occult
references to the voice as being the real creative agent.
THE WEB OF THE UNIVERSE
The Sons of Light referred to in the Stanzas of Dzyan were
human monads, and their first vahan or body, built in the
first Chain, we should now describe as having the form of the
mineral kingdom, with centres, angles, axes, etc., first con-
structed in a purely mental world on the first and simplest
plan.
Though astral and physical worlds and bodies have since
been added to the mental, we still, as humans, originate
thought on these same principles. In the course of the cycles
we have registered innumerable experiences in the spark-like
centres of the mentally active Web which still
consistently
arrests and reflects our life. At the touch of our attention
these centres light up in our mental bodies and re-display to
us as spectators the scenes and incidents there registered, and
we say
"
I remember
"
this or that. The memory-lag of the
Web resembles the vision-lag of the retina of the eye, though
much more durable.
Thought-forms, humanly created, are based on these cen-
tres and axes of growth and expand or fade as the light of our
attention ensouls them or is withdrawn. Mental propaga-
tion is somewhat analogous to fission, for telepathy tends to
excite in another's mind the same form or feeling as is
experi-
enced by the producer an occurrence, by the way, which is
much more frequent than is
supposed. Our physical means
of communication corresponding to this is, at present, almost
exclusively by the use of language and the pen. The British
Broadcasting Corporation provides an excellent example of
propagation on mental lines though here the medium and
mechanism are at the etheric and physical level. Each active
receiving set reproduces the original "thought" exactly as
thrown out unless the receiver is
faulty, as many a human
mind is, and then the original form is distorted proportion-
ally.
The first ajdumbratipn of archetypal man is thus seen
achieving position in the Web little more. Man is no-
dimensional at this stage.

Blavatsky calls him. (Vol. I, p. 199,) As pioneer he establishes
and endows centres and radii, and passes on, leaving his foot-
steps to guide and assist the younger life to follow. The
mineral form is thus founded.
In the second Chain the Sons of Light, a humanity two
generations earlier than ourselves, had their chief centre of
activity on the astral globe, in addition to the mental, of that
Chain. A clothing of fluidic material with membrane and
envelope is assembled. The plant form appears and a medium
for feeling and warm emotion is added to the mechanism of
cold thinking.
The circulatory and lymphatic systems of the later physical
human body are adumbrated at this stage, for in the early
plant forms of the mento-astral worlds vascular structure is
achieved. The astral world is of such a nature as to permit of

Man's nervous and circulatory systems are obviously suggestive,
on the form side, of plant growths. Roots are represented by the
brain and stem and foliage by the spinal cord with its extensions
and proliferations.
All these are of the plant type in construction.
Coupled with the ancient occult symbol of the Ashvattha-Tree,

significant, for it

set the pattern of vegetable processes and hence was their originator
and creator, is the theory here advanced. The life of the younger
kingdom, following in man's steps, adopted the forms and ela-
borated and specialised them as they

and hardened
into the denser physical medium.

MAN'S ORIGINS
The implication of the foregoing is therefore that the phy-
sical human form as we know it must be regarded itself as
the direct representative of the
"
creative origin of all things ".
The physical body of man is, even to-day, compared with
many plant and animal forms, simple, unextended, unspecial-
ised. Nevertheless it contains within itself
every potentiality.
Not till the physical plane is reached and the fourth hierarchy,
our own, is in action, is the archetypal form brought right
through and projected in the outermost world of our Solar
Scheme.
In each Cycle it is the human archetypal form, manifesting
successively on the mental, astral and etheric planes, whence
all other forms derive.
In the earlier Rounds and Cycles of our Solar Scheme it was
the preceding hierarchies of humanity who played the arche-
typal part. Propagation was by methods of fission on the
mental globe, by budding on the astral world and by sweat-
born extrusion in the etheric (moon) period. These remain
the characteristic methods of mineral, plant and some ani-
mal forms to-day. During the cycles mentioned it must
be noted that the human form, the progenitor, is described
as composed
"
of the most tenuous matter compatible with
objectivity ".
Thus, as man descended gradually into materiality he
periodically threw off from him fragments and essences (the
Sanscrit terms are translated into dust and sweat) which,
seized by junior grades of life, were developed along their
own specialised lines in plant and animal directions. Ulti-
mately arriving in his own completed physical form, more
flexibly constructed and less
prone to specialisation than
many which had been cast aside, man classifies the ani-
mals, plants and minerals as of younger kingdoms of
nature.
When thrown off the younger forms tended to materialise
comparatively rapidly. As the fragments of hot iron falling
in sparks from the smith's forge cool and harden more
71
THE WEB OF THE UNIVERSE
quickly than the hot bar itself, so the younger life, seizing the
extruded substance from the astral and ethereal human
frame, cooled and materialised long before man himself did
in the physical world. Hence the abundant traces in this
world of plant and animal forms prior to those of man.

In the development of animal forms a stage resembling a maze
of lines branching from a central nucleus is a reminder of the
mineral type. An example of such is the illustration of a marine

Much of this early
work in the building of animal forms was done on the third
Chain.
MAN'S RELATION TO THE MAMMALIA
Madame Blavatsky points out that in this Round our own
humanity has been the progenitor of mammalian forms.
(S.D. Vol. //, 164, 265.)
Our humanity, the fourth, has been vastly assisted by stand-
ing, so to
speak, on the shoulders of the preceding; and it is
72
Number Twenty-two

BY THE HUMAN VOICE
MAN'S ORIGINS
always to be remembered that the preceding humanities used
as their densest bodies the forms of what are now the younger
kingdoms. In physical gestation to-day, for instance, a
human being travels the whole of the course traced since the
beginning. Long practice by recapitulation has ensured an
exquisite skill and an amazing expedition. In a few months
of embryonic growth the reincarnating ego, the life force
behind the new physical body, passes through all the stages
from a
"
structureless moneron
"
to the marvellous organism
of a newborn child. Throughout that period of rapid changes
the thrusting pioneer life is human. During these few months
stages are passed through corresponding to plant, fish, reptile
and early mammal, indicative of the time when man, func-
tioning in such forms in a suitable environment, left them
behind to be seized upon and used by the appropriate life-
stream which followed after him.
It is a statement readily accepted to-day that no animal
or plant has in its
bodily anatomy anything other than that
which man similarly possesses.
Bone for bone, muscle for
muscle, nerve for nerve, all are to be found in the human
body though in many an instance undeveloped, unex-
tended. Plant and animal have specialised and extensively
elaborated parts of their human inheritance in a way that
man has never attempted. Prof. Wood Jones pointed out,
many years ago, that the arms of man have never been used
for walking; that the foot of man is a simple structure and
remains so while in many animals it has been immensely
specialised as, for example, in the horse; that the vertebrae at
the base of man's spine have never been extended into a tail;
that the jaw of the human is
typically human and not a retreat
from the projected animal jaw; and that the so-called vesti-
gial organs in the human body are just
as reasonably to be
regarded as original parts which have never been extended.
The Professor's anatomical researches led him to assert
that man has probably always been the contemporary of
the animals and not a successor a very significant state-
73
THE WEB OF THE UNIVERSE
ment though not entirely adequate in the view of occult-
ists.*
Other authorities might be cited concerning the non-
specialised character of the human body. The tendency to
recognise this is
quite marked in current thought. For
instance, in a B.B.C. talk published in the Listener, Nov.
2ist 1934, Gerald Heard spoke on the subject Man, the
Non-Specialist. Mr. Heard pointed out truly enough that
man is a tool-using creature and that tool-making has
adequately served man in providing clothing, shelter, food
produce, locomotion, etc., hence he has never needed to
specialise his limbs.
The principle enunciated, founded on Man as the arche-
typal, original model, covers and relates these views and
explains much more. Man as the archetype bears within
himself the potentiality of all extensions and every user of
the human form shares this immense inheritance. Each
main division of the mineral, plant and animal kingdoms
emerging from the archetypal form at the mental, astral,
etheric or dense physical levels, as the case might be, would
develop and extend its
qualities of specialisation along its own
line to the fullest extent of its vital and partially conscious
drive. Life, being always the driving urge, builds the forms
and extends them each strictly according to the limit of
capacity. Each specialised line, bovine, equine, canine,
feline, etc., achieves a wholeness determined by its
purpose,
each elaborating some aspect of the original human form far
beyond that needed by the unspecialised and hence ever
adaptable human frame.
According therefore to the occult tradition the human sig-
nature is to be found on the forms of the kingdoms of nature
everywhere. As the archetypal author of all, man has
"
named
"
all. His own physical body is a representation in
physical terms of the archetypal man; it is a body of com-

MAN'S ORIGINS
parativcly simple construction and fitted especially, if it can
be said to be specialised at all, to serve as a medium for
human thinking. The stable and yet adaptable physical
body and the dense world in which man is now functioning
enable him to externalise his mental processes by means of
action in the mirror-like Web with precision and so to master
them. In this mastery the stupendous powers of mentality
may be dis-covered and the spiritual nature of his own life
realised.
This is the occult theory of man's origin, reversing the
popular conceptions of evolution by placing man as the
ancestor, in terms of form, of the mineral, vegetable and
animal kingdoms of nature as well as, of course, his own.
"
Occultism teaches that no form can be given to anything
whose ideal type does not already exist on the subjective plane
. . . our human forms have existed in the Eternity as
ethereal prototypes . . . these supersensuous moulds con-
tained, besides their own, the elements of all the vegetable
and animal forms of this globe. Therefore, man's outward
shell passed through every vegetable and animal body before
it assumed the human shape/

CREATIVE ENERGY: LUNAR, TERRENE AND
SOLAR
WEspeak of generating stations and power houses, of the
triumphs of industrial machinery, of the invention of
high explosives and mighty engines of war and need occa-
sionally to be reminded that man can create dc novo no force,
no energy, no power whatever. Not one single foot-pound
of energy can he in truth create. By the skilful use of nature's
elements he can collect and confine existing forces of a certain
order and can then distribute the temporarily imprisoned
power, such as steam and electricity, along specially prepared
channels to do his chosen work. Mdn can create new forms
but never new forces.
Sun, moon and earth provide in exhaustless abundance the
power on which he can draw and by far the larger propor-
tion still remains to be utilised. All is said to be within human
reach, for the occult definition of man is that he is the being,
in any Chain of globes, who links highest spirit
and lowest
matter. Adopting this definition it follows that man is the
focus and provides the vehicle for forces playing both from
lofty heights and deeply involved depths; he stands between
two extremes and his task is the building of a bridge which
shall span the gulf, a bridge that can be no other than himself
in his own perfected consciousness.
The sun, representative in manifestation of the first
Aspect
of the divine Life, is the source of creative energies operating
from
"
above "; the moon and earth, representing the third
Aspect, are the source of creative energies operating from
"
beneath ". Humanity represents the second Aspect and it
is Its task to forge the link which shall achieve the three-fold
re-union.
CREATIVE ENERGY :
LUNAR, TERRENE AND SOLAR
Though the familiar terms moon, earth, sun; lunar, ter-
rene, solar are convenient to use, it is of course the Life mani-
festing through these spheres which is the dominating factor.
The sun is held to be the immediate vehicle of a mighty Being
known as the Solar Logos. His three Aspects in manifesta-
tion within the solar system differ in their importance and
dominance during rhythmic space-time periods. To the first
Aspect is attributed the creative Power of the system; to the
third Aspect the creative Activity concerned with planetary
involution and the production of forms; and the second
Aspect, with Wisdom as its attribute being dual in func-
tion, is said to operate with the third Aspect in the earlier
cycles during the arc of involution, and with the first
Aspect
during the later cycles on the upward arc. It will be noted
that, in the occult view, the sun and the earth and moon
also represent vastly more than the totality
of the physical
properties they exhibit.
The moon, the relic of the one physical planet of Chain III,
is claimed to have been the immediate parent of our earth.
Its
disintegration and the transfer of much of its educated
material to the building of our world is the explanation of
the very intimate relationship between this satellite and the
earth, as also of the very similar qualities of the lunar and
earthborn forces. Indeed lunar and terrene are now prac-
tically synonymous in this connection. The early Rounds of
our Chain witnessed this transference from moon to earth
together with the charging of the huge battery of the earth by
the third Aspect of the One Life.
In Round I the initial
building of the new earth-globe seems
to have been the principal task. Solar energies of the first
Aspect in the character of destroyer assisted in the disintegra-
tion of the moon planet, to be followed by the concentration
of its material around its successor. Then, through the por-
tals of the Web opened by the descending Life, the kingdoms
of nature, led by human craftsmen, slowly developed their
forms, and the electric charging of the earth began. The
77
8
CREATIVE ENERGY :
LUNAR, TERRENE AND SOLAR
mineral form was dominant in Round I and the plant form in
Round II.
Throughout this second Round the charging of
the earth proceeded rapidly and continued during Round III
until the earth became an enormously charged battery of
energy. In Round IV, the present period, the development
of the human form in physical solidity on our earth as we
know it
to-day (a projection of the archetypal human model
in simple terms) has been achieved and the earth battery
now begins slowly to discharge.
In figure 23, the sun, the body of the Solar Logos, is shown
as in the centre of the Web constituting the field of solar manifesta-
tion. For simplicity, our planet the earth alone is included together
with its satellite. The energy stored within the mass of the earth
has been collected during the first three Rounds, mostly during
Round II via the forms of the then plant kingdom. During the
early part of Round IV it has been held and stabilised in the
mineral kingdom and now begins very slowly to be released. In
the Vth, Vlth and Vllth Rounds the release accelerates.
Of the forces .distributed by the sun at the present time
directly to the present-day evolutionary forms of the king-
doms of nature, the less
potent are shared by all in terms of
warmth, prank currents and chemical action. The inner-
most, the finer and more intense, are modified (and to some
extent intercepted) by certain orders of devas.* Humanity
alone can respond to these, and only as the higher mind, the
spiritual principle, awakens.
Diagram No. 25 is an attempt to indicate the vast
cyclic processes whereby this task is
accomplished, coupled
as it
necessarily is with the expansion, or rather release, of
divine powers at present latent in man.
The immense fertility of the earth to-day is due largely to
the gradual release of the energies stored within itself. The
forms used now by mineral, plant and animal life all derive
a sturdy vitality from the earth. From the sun also the forms

of the plant, animal and human kingdoms obtain a fiery sus-
tenance in an increasing measure which each is able to use
according to its
growth and capacity.
Solar energy is here diagrammatically shown as being conducted
through to the earth during the first three Rounds. The solid
arrows touching the periphery of the circles represent solar energy
reaching the earth. Through the early involutionary forms of the
kingdoms of nature, mineral, plant and animal, on the mental,
emotional and etheric planes respectively, the energy was trans-
formed and accumulated in the earth. Therein it became locked
up coiled up is an expression used as in a charged battery.
Lunar and terrene forces together nourish and support the
personal bodies of man and are indispensable to their welfare.
Indeed, just as in the plant kingdom roots are extended down-
wards first to secure a firm hold on the earth and water of
bodily form before the upward thrust into the realm of sun
and air is undertaken, so with man. The forces which
strengthen and secure the grip of consciousness upon the per-
sonal life are the influences to which he first
responds. This
response, the result of a so-called temptation (as a familiar
theological allegory has it) being achieved, human indivi-
dualisation is won and established.
The successful shaping of formal bodies is attained under
the shadow of the Lords of the Moon, the Barhishads, who
were the hierarchical tutors of humanity in the control of phy-
sical forms, and of the Asura Hierarchy, whose tremendously
difficult task of persuading our young hierarchy to enter the
material
"
coats of skin
"
has earned for them the allegorical
title of Satan.
The creative forces derived from the moon and the earth
are by their nature unconscious within humanity; they are
accepted and used primarily by the life of the elemental king-
doms functioning within human and animal bodies, and are
automatic, vegetative and magnetic. Their influence in man's
animal nature is
displayed in the instincts of self-preservation,

possessiveness, jealousy and greed, all accentuated in the early
animal forms used by our hierarchy in Round III and legiti-
mately inherited by the animal kingdom at large.
The numbers i to 7 indicate the successive Rounds of our Chain,
as in diagram No. 12. They also serve on a much smaller scale to
indicate the seven Root-Races of our present world-occupation. (In
this minor correspondence the circles I to 3 will represent in racial
terms a rapid recapitulation of the Rounds and the circles 5 to 7
will represent brief racial rehearsals of the work of the future
Rounds.)
The earth is shown as being charged by the sun during the long
involutionary period and as discharging during the last three
Rounds. In Round 4 a state of comparative stability obtains, for
on the earth during this Round the turning point of the vast cycle
is reached and passed.
The human form becomes dominant on Round 4 and its arrival
is
represented in the diagram by the white spot on the top of the
middle circle. The arrows within this circle point downwards to
mark the strong pressure of the terrene creative forces during this
middle cycle. Nevertheless the solar influence begins to be potent
and is
represented by the dotted line traced directly from the sun
to the human kingdom. In the cycles 5, 6 and 7 (slightly in the
Root-Races, powerfully in Rounds) the solar influence in an
accelerating degree leads to consummation in the human hier-
archy in the 7th Round.
Through the human personal bodies the earth currents cir-
culate by way of the sympathetic nervous system and the
basic chakram of the spine connected with the sexual life.
Rising normally as far as the heart they contribute to bodily
strength and virility,
to a good healthy tone and ample vigour
of body. Their play can be stimulated by certain practices
which may lead to feelings of intense physical well-being and
exaltation. Some risk however lies in this direction notwith-
standing the physical power obtained, because of the strong
reaction of the sensory and instinctual emotions amounting
to glamour. The terrene forces make for the health and
83
THE WEB OF THE UNIVERSE
vigour of the purely animal nature and an excess of them
tends to stimulate the automatism of the elemental tendencies
to the detriment of the truly human.
The position in which humanity finds itself
to-day is some-
what critical in that the two opposite forces, terrene and solar,
both of stimulating vitality and power in the human body, are
nearly balanced. It is, too, increasingly within the range of
human volition to decide as to what proportion of each shall
be used. The lunar and terrene forces however have a tre-
mendous momentum owing to their pressing dominance in
the past on the involutionary arc, and this tends to out-weigh
and obstruct the subtler influences of the solar light.
The power currents derived from the moon and earth as
described are of such an easy flowing, accustomed, every-day
character that they are utilised in the course of ordinary per-
sonal living too naturally and automatically to arouse any
special interest or attention except perhaps in the few who
are philosophically inclined. But they can, unfortunately, be
augmented and increased by adopting certain specific exer-
cises. Some knowledge of such practices, dignified some-
times by the name magic, carries over from far-distant
Atlantean times, and fragments of such information are a
commercialised product that may be purchased even to-day
as witness many an advertisement in our periodicals offer-
ing the secrets of
"
power
"
for sale. The mark that brands
them and informs the inquirer invariably and unmistakably
of their nature is an association with money-making success
and sexuality. A trace of these, early or late in its disclosure
and however disguised, is sufficient evidence to condemn
them as unworthy. The practices belong to the lunar cults of
earlier Races, their value is
outgrown, and the experiences
engendered are retrogressive.
A significant feature introduced into the Mystery cere-
monies by the hierarchical tutors of humanity, when the
solar influences dawned in consciousness, was the symbolic
marriage of solar and terrene energies. The original actors
CREATIVE ENERGY :
LUNAR, TERRENE AND SOLAR
in such a rite were, in the ritual of the true Mysteries, officials
of the highest rank, the lofty nature of the divine fires invoked
being thus emphasised. Therefrom one may trace the idea of
the indissolubility of the marriage tie a veritable truth at the
spiritual
levels to which it referred but of little
application in
purely physical terms. Degeneration into phallic depths has
marked many of those rites which, originally, were of a mag-
nificent and lofty splendour. Even to-day a school of psy-
chology, and one of the most widely popular, traces the
creative fire in man to one source only, namely to the terrene
hence the prominence and overshadowing importance of
sex in its conclusions and teaching; a half-truth. Fortunately,
other schools, of increasing repute, recognise the higher facul-
ties of man, the will and insight, as pertaining to and expres-
sive of the Self, and their definitions of the Self are very close
to a recognition of its
spiritual nature and origin.
The work of the first three Rounds being completed and the
fourth Round being half-way through, it follows that in the
middle of our present world-occupation the turning point of
the whole vast cycle of our Scheme was reached and passed
and the upward arc begun. Individual consciousness having
been established firmly in a body of dense material in the
fourth Race on this earth, release from the bonds of matter
is
begun in our present fifth Race cycle, and the lost word of
spiritual consciousness may again be heard.
A dramatic event of the first
importance accompanied the
turning point of the cycle, according to the occult tradition,
for at this time there came the Lords of the Flame from the
Venusian Planetary Scheme to take over the Inner Govern-
ment of our world and to become the directive force in the
evolution of our planetary life. The spark of mind was sti-
mulated into activity and awakened in man, the higher mind
being the first of his truly spiritual principles to respond.
Their advent is
probably the deeply hidden origin of the
Chrestos and Solar Myths telling of the descent of a Saviour,
an Avatar, a God.
85
THE WEB OF THE UNIVERSE
By this
coming the action of the solar energies in the human
race was profoundly stimulated, for mind was and is the pri-
mary vehicle of the solar forces.
In relation to the physical body, the crown of the head is
the power centre in man where solar energies are focused and
whence they are directed and distributed. Fortunately for us
the high potencies of solar fire can be consciously invoked
and used only by a mind which has been in consider-
able measure disciplined and clarified. Humanity is not
yet widely self-conscious concerning these high contacts,
though their influence is
abundantly registered in the
very numerous charitable and altruistic movements found
in all civilised countries at the present time. The free play
of solar forces waits always on some measure of personal
sacrifice.
The inner solar forces drawn directly from the sun are thus
beginning to function in humanity. Entering through the
head they also reach the heart and there, combining with the
terrene stream, endow humanity with the promise of awaken-
ing powers which may indeed be illimitable in their scope.
In the heart of man is the real at-one-ment made, by the link-
ing of the Life forces of the first and third Aspects, for man,
in his collective capacity as the fourth Creative Hierarchy, is
the living Bridge in our vast Solar Scheme. Of interest-
ing significance here is the story told in the old mystery drama
of the birth of the Christ-Child in a stable or cave, for the cave
of the mystery teaching corresponds to the home of the
animal, the heart of man. Highest and lowest meet in the
heart.
Two sources of creative power are thus within man's con-
scious reach to-day, for he stands midway, so to speak, between
the solar
"
fire
"
and the terrene
"
water ", olden names for
the two cosmic forces. Both are necessary and vital to
humanity, for unless both are accepted, used and balanced,
the true human stature cannot be attained. To distinguish
clearly between solar and terrene sources of power is difficult

LUNAR, TERRENE AND SOLAR
until some lucid and impersonal thinking and feeling have
been practised, coupled with a certain detached analysis of
oneself. The only real test available for a student's use is the
validity of his own experience honestly interpreted. Distinc-
tions on broad lines are easy to classify and the following
tables indicate some of these as examples :
Prompted from lunar and terrene creative sources :
Thinking of an automatic, repetitive character; mechanical
reverie, idle day-dreaming, etc.
Instincts of self-protection, self-interest, acquisitiveness, tend-
ing to fear and cowardice.
Hunger and thirst; sexual desire.
Dictates of the conventional conscience. The passive psychic
medium.
Sympathetic nervous system. Learning by rote. Copying.
In religious discipline, negative precepts such as the Jewish
ten commandments. Penances.
Prompted (inspired) from solar creative sources :
Self-initiated thought.
Intuitive love, loyalty, probity, courage, truthfulness, etc.
Creative art in music, poetry, dancing, etc. Invention.
Controlled psychism of the Seer.
Cerebro-spinal nervous system. Breathing (partially).
In religious discipline, the golden rule. Meditation.
The creative power from the sun is, comparatively, but
slight at present though ultimately to be as readily and natur-
ally accepted as that from
"
beneath ". To strengthen the
solar flow, indeed to recognise it at all for what it is, demands
self-directed and voluntary effort. Such effort has its own
magic and its own specialised methods.
In a search for guidance the student will find a large
variety of ancient myths and cults to interest him, mystery
teachings and ceremonies picturing the relation of sun to
THE WEB OF THE UNIVERSE
moon and man's relation to both, of the sacrifice of solar
energies on the cross of matter, of death and resurrection (or
re-birth), dramatised usually by the help of a liberal cast of
deities who personify god-like and human attributes. Among
them may be traced many a hint and much instruction con-
cerning a practice which appears again and again in later
periods and in all faiths. This is the withdrawal of the
individual consciousness from the dominance of sensa-
tion and emotion and other earth-born stimuli and the
deliberate cultivation of contact with an interior light, an
inner vision, the dis-covery of a spiritual centre, of the God
within. Instruction in this has accompanied the turn of
the cycle of manifestation from the downward to the upward
arc.
The science of the union of individual consciousness and
the solar Life is called to-day, both in east and west, the
science of yoga. It is in effect the science of the union of the
terrene forces with the solar, the re-union of the third and
first
Aspects of the one Life through man for man bears
within himself the sacred fire of the second Aspect which
alone can link the twain. Thus, through man, solar energy
can dominate and control the instinctual life drawn from
lunar and terrene sources. By self-directed and voluntary
effort contact may be established with the solar centre in the
head, the seat (in physical terms) of the higher consciousness,
the higher self. It is in and from this centre, strictly speaking
in the higher mind, that the higher creative powers of the
solar Life are focused, reflected and expressed through our
present human consciousness.
Efforts on these lines have been confined in the past to the
few who were capable of the consistent struggle and selfless-
ness demanded. To-day, since the turn of the cycles is well
past its
half-way mark, many may contact and distribute the
inner light if
they will. The veils of bodily form are begin-
ning to wear thin and the awakening into activity of long
dormant faculties under the influence of the finer grades of
CREATIVE ENERGY :
LUNAR, TERRENE AND SOLAR
the solar light begins. Privation has done its work, com-
pelling concentration, and humanity in many directions is
claiming true self-awareness as its
birthright. Understand-
ing discrimination is the first
step in yoga awakened spiritu-
ality follows close upon its heels.
The theme of all
mystery ceremonies has been and is the
dis-covery and awakening of that centre of spiritual life, the
focus of divinity, in every human being. Though man shares
the one and universal Life pervading all that is manifest and
actually is immersed in it, the birth and realisation in human
consciousness of die immanence of the solar light is
always the discovery as of a light within the centre is a
dis-covered sanctuary of light within one's very being. The
sacrifice by the terrene personality of its
long-accustomed first
place in the interest and attention of consciousness is the
prelude to a release of the solar creative forces, and these, in
the course of the cycle, may make of truly self-conscious man
a Prometheus LTnbound.
"
There is an inmost centre in us all
Where truth abides in fulness; . . . and to know
Rather consists in opening out a way
Whence the imprisoned splendour may escape
Than in effecting entry for a light
Supposed to be without."
Paracelsus, BROWNING
The field of manifestation we have attempted to envisage
presents itself as a stupendous unfoldment of power on a
pattern at once simple and immensely complex. Simple inas-
much as it
proceeds on the lines of a constantly repeated
design and hence can be elucidated with the key of corre-
spondences; yet complex to an infinite degree by reason of the
interweaving and overlapping of its
patterns as consciousness,
born from Life amid the friction of opposing forms, strives to
attain the secret of being. From our study there may emerge
THE WEB OF THE UNIVERSE
perhaps a fuller understanding of the lofty and pioneer role
played by man on a stage of finely tuned sub-stance prepared
and furnished with all the material properties needed for
Life's manifestation and experience.

APPENDIX
OUR SOLAR SCHEME
CHART I
THE Ten Schemes of the Solar System are displayed in the above
Chart diagrammatically. Each Scheme is shown separately with
its seven Chains. The Ten Schemes are all in manifestation to-
gether, each proceeding on its own lines. The seven Chains within
each Scheme are actually successive, only one Chain of globes
being in existence at one time. The globes of these chains are also
displayed separately simply for the sake of clarity; strictly they can
be regarded as
"
separate
"
only in the fourth Chain of each series.
Of the ten Schemes, seven only are represented by physical
globes, hence three are unnamed. The One Solar Life is function-
ing in all, but is at different stages of growth and development in
91
THE WEB OF THE UNIVERSE
the different Schemes, and hence the Schemes differ in age or stage
of development. The Chain of globes in each Scheme that is in
manifestation now is known by the name of its densest planet.
These are the Seven Sacred Planets of occult literature, of which
our earth is one.
Omitting the Vulcan and Neptunian Schemes, about which
little information is
given, the eldest and most advanced appears
to be that of Venus, the second is the Terrene, our own, and
Jupiter comes next.
Though the Life streams of the Schemes are not inter-con-
nected directly these last-named three are related somewhat inti-
mately. In the interests of the cosmic economy of the mighty
Solar System, Venus has vitally assisted and is
assisting our Ter-
rene evolution. We may infer that similar help will be extended
by us to the Jupiterian in due course.
With regard to the differing and special task of each Scheme
very little is intimated. We might possibly and reasonably sur-
mise the principle and plane, or group of both, with which each is
particularly concerned, but it would be largely speculative and
merely academic. So we may turn to the fuller information relat-
ing to our own Scheme and present Chain.
OUR TERRENE SCHEME
In each Planetary Scheme there are seven successive incarnations
or circuits of the great Life Waves from the Solar Logos.
On each Chain, from the first onwards, all the stages of con-
sciousness known as the kingdoms of nature, from the elemental
to the human, are present. The broad rule appears to be that, for
the span of a Chain, a given impulse of the Logoic consciousness
functions through the forms of one kingdom only.
Success with these forms means that in the next succeeding
Chain that same impulse of consciousness qualifies to enter the
forms of the next higher kingdom. It should be always remem-
bered that there are no hard and fast dividing lines and hence con-
siderable over-lapping arises, but the general rule is that the Life
Wave of the Logos overshadows the forms of one kingdom of
nature and then passes on in the next chain to overshadow the next
and more evolved kingdom, e.g.,
the Life Wave that used the
92
APPENDIX
mineral forms in a First Chain will enter and use plant forms in a
Second Chain period.
Owing to varying experiences the step from one kingdom to the
next may occur at any period during a Chain's progress. This
tendency becomes especially pronounced when the middle period
of a Chain is
approached. Such overlapping becomes confusing
unless the flexibility of the evolving life is held in mind together
with the underlying law.
The field of action differs for each Chain, but in each four
planes only are touched.
Chain I. Called Brahmah's Body of Darkness. Field of
Action :
Atma, Buddhi, H. Manas and L. Manas. Lower Mental
was the densest and the crux.
Chain II. The boundaries are lijc planes and the Chain is
known as Brahmah's Body of Light. Field of Action :
Buddhi,
H. Manas, L. Manas, Astral.
Chain III. Bounded by the higher sections of form planes and
called Brahmah's Body of Twilight. Field of Action : H. Manas,
L. Manas, Astral, H. Physical.
Chain IV. Of the seven Chains comprising our Terrene
Scheme, it is the fourth on which we find ourselves to-day. The
present Chain sees the turning point of the Scheme as a whole and
is known as Brahmah's Body of Dawn. Field of Action :
L. Manas, Astral, H. Physical and Dense Physical.
The student should note that the field of experience open to any
one kingdom on a Chain is not identical with that of its successor
on the next. The field differs and hence the experiences are dis-
similar. The consciousness functioning through the plant king-
dom of our second Chain, for instance, would have very different
experiences from the plant consciousness of the third Chain, for
the latter would have a new and denser plane as its basic material.
The life within each of the kingdoms of our planet to-day, there-
fore, has followed its own unique course.
One of the seven paths open to the successful humanity of any
Chain is that of assisting the evolving life of the following Chain.
Indeed, if this
path be chosen it seems that the assistance is ren-
dered to at least the three following Chains of the Scheme. The
humanity of Chain I of the Terrene system for instance, known as
the 5th Creative Hierarchy (vide infra), is still in touch with our
93
THE WEB OF THE UNIVERSE
Scheme. The Asuras, as they are designated owing to the office
they at
present fill, have influenced our humanity through the
mental, particularly the lower mental, principle. The 6th Hier-
archy, the Agnishvattas of the 2nd Chain, influences us through the
emotions and intuitions, the Barhishads of the 3rd Chain assist and
have always assisted us in the building of bodies.
The interest and the application of all this to us lie in its indica-
tion of our responsibilities to the younger kingdoms of the mineral,
plant and animal. For, obviously, applying the Chain-Kingdom
rule, our own relation to the animal kingdom is similar to that of
the Barhishads to us. Our relation to the plant life is that of the
Agnishvattas to us, and to the mineral that of the Asuras to us.
Our present and ordinary attitudes to those lower kingdoms is
evidence of the major law of correspondence stated above. Our
attitude to the mineral life for instance is
quite naturally and un-
affectedly one of cold detached mentality. The emotional nature
is seldom stirred and, except in the case of jewels perhaps, rarely
stimulated. To the flowering plants, and vegetation generally,
our relation is
just as naturally emotional. Concerning the ani-
mals, H.P.B/s statements regarding the bodily legacy humanity
has left to them (S.D. Vol. 77) are illuminating indeed. Thus in
the study of the Chains and the inter-relation of the Hierarchies is
to be found the key to the understanding of our intimate responsi-
bilities to the evolving life of the kingdoms below us.
94
APPENDIX
THE SEVEN CHAINS OF THE EARTH SCHEME
CHART II
Assisted by Chart II our study of the Terrene Scheme can be
continued to better advantage. The seven successive Chains of
globes, expressing the form side of manifestation, are clearly dis-
played, and the periods of pralaya (the life side) are indicated by
the spheres between the Chains.
From a previous Scheme of an earlier System the life com-
mences on Chain I, and all the Kingdoms are therein represented.
The seven kingdoms are the ist, 2nd, and 3rd Elemental King-
doms, Mineral, Plant, Animal and Human. These are all en-
gaged in the work of Chain I. Seven circuits (Rounds) of the
globes in a Chain are made, under the general superintendence
and within the mighty being of the Root-Manu. A Chain of globes
may indeed be regarded as the Root-Manu's bodily form, an incar-
nation as it were.
95
THE WEB OF THE UNIVERSE
At the conclusion of the work of a Chain the Life is
gathered
into the aura of the Seed-Manu for a vast cosmic sleep of assimi-
lation and recuperation. Therein, during the interchain pralaya,
the consciousness of the kingdoms is smoothed out, disentangled
and adjusted, and made ready to engage in the work of the next
Chain of globes. The Seed Manu's aura is sometimes represented
in regular bands of colour to suggest the ordered harmony result-
ing from the pralaya or rest
period.
The following tables epitomise certain information given :
THE OCCULT GOVERNMENT OF THE TERRENE SCHEME :
1. The Logos of the Solar System, the Life of the 10 Schemes.
2. The Ruler of the Earth Scheme. (One of the Spirits before
the Throne.)
3. The Root and Seed Manus of a Chain.
4. The Root and Seed Manus of a single Round.
5. The Lord of the World.
6. The Buddhas.
7. The Manu (form) and the Bodhisattva (life) of a Root-Race.
THE HIERARCHIES AND THEIR CHAINS :
Chain I : The Fifth Creative Hierarchy :
7 Globes Atma
to Lower Mental.
II : The Sixth Creative Hierarchy :
7 Globes
Buddhi to Astral.
III : The Seventh Creative Hierarchy :
7 Globes H.
Mental to H. Physical.
IV: The Fourth Creative Hierarchy: (Our Hu-
manity) 7 Globes L. Mental to Dense
Physical.
THE GOAL SET FOR HUMANITY OF EACH CHAIN :
Chain I : The First Initiation. (4th Hierarchy then in
Mineral Kingdom.)
II : The Third Initiation. (4th Hierarchy then in
Vegetable Kingdom.)
III : The Fourth Initiation. (4th Hierarchy then in
Animal Kingdom.)
IV : The Fifth Initiation. (4th Hierarchy in
Human Kingdom.)
APPENDIX
The attainment of the goal set
qualifies for entrance on one of
the seven paths of service :
THE SEVEN CHOICES BEFORE THE PERFECT MAN :
1. Remains with Humanity as an official of the Hierarchy.
(Form.)
2. Remains with Humanity as a
"
Nirmanakaya ". (Life.)
3. Joins the Devas or Angelic Hosts.
$. Joins the
"
Staff Corps of the Logos ".
5. Prepares the work of the next Chain.
6 & 7. Enters Nirvana.
Though the Chains are successive, each representing practically
a reincarnation of the last, no sudden ending or beginning must
be assumed. On the last Round of a Chain, as the concentrated
effort of the Root-Manu passes from Globe A onwards, the earlier
globes dissolve (instead of retiring merely into obscuration as on
previous Rounds) and their principles are carried over to the con-
struction of corresponding globes of the succeeding Chain. Hence
the work of the new Chain is
begun long before that of the last is
concluded. Even now, for instance, though we are only half-way
through the 4th Chain, the preliminary work of the 5th is already
in hand.
After the period of pralaya the life of the kingdoms passes on
from the Seed-Manu to the Root-Manu in a regular sequence and
a general rule may again be noted. The earlier Rounds of a
Chain furnish the field most suited for the younger and less
advanced grades of consciousness of all the kingdoms and the later
Rounds for the more advanced and older. Hence much of the
more evolved life taken over by the Seed-Manu towards the close
of a Chain is not passed on to incarnation on the succeeding
Chain till a late
period in that Chain. An environment corres-
ponding in a measure to that experienced in the last Chain is
usually first secured. This means that the most advanced indivi-
duals and units of life do not enter a succeeding Chain till its
middle period or even later.
Indeed we may gather, for instance, that some of the most
evolved of the third Chain are only now coming in on the fourth
globe of the fourth Round of this.
97 G
THE WEB OF THE UNIVERSE
The Chain-Kingdom rule referred to earlier (one kingdom for
the term of one Chain) should be understood as meaning in nearly
all cases 7 Rounds, for these 7 Rounds may frequently be spread
over two Chains for the reasons set out in the last
paragraph.
DEVA AND HUMAN :
In the middle period of the mineral kingdom it seems that Life,
having then arrived at its
deepest immersion in form, divides into
two streams. One follows on through the jewels and tl^n,
through grasses and cereals, on to insects, birds and all winged
creatures. Leaving the dense physical plane at this last stage the
next and later steps are taken among the dcva hosts. The other
stream of Life, following through the metals and on through
mosses, shrubs, trees, etc., reaches the mammalia in the animal
kingdom and thence from the seven types of domesticated animals
at length the human. This outline is
given to indicate that a suc-
cessful Hierarchy includes highly developed beings of both the
human and devic (angelic) type.
A very interesting and instructive fact may be inferred from
the occult teaching concerning the relations of the Deva and
Human evolutions. Though parallel streams of life their relative
importance changes. First the Deva, then the Human, in any
cycle seems to be the practice. The dominant life of Chains I, II
and III was that of the Devas and Nature Spirits.
In comparison
the Human throughout appears to have been subordinate, though
tending strongly towards a balance as the Scheme proceeded. In
the 4th Chain this relation becomes gradually reversed and Man
must fill the role of pioneer and leader. The half-way point of
balance is
passed and humanity is
slowly assuming control very
litde conscious at
present, however, of his powers. The present
experiments in harnessing nature, so evident in the machinery
of our current civilisation, are a slight earnest of the future.
The Coming of the Kumaras, members of the humanity of the
Venus Scheme, to take over the charge of the Earth inaugurated
this reversal. We are witnessing the change taking place at this
very period of the 4th Round's course. Its tremendous import
for our humanity cannot be over-estimated and the recognition
and understanding of our task should enlist the attention of every
student of occultism.

The life of the kingdoms is
passed on to the Earth Chain of
globes from the aura of the interchain Seed-Manu. The Root-
Manu in charge of the Chain accepts the younger life first and the
first Round, commencing on globe A, is
begun. The seven globes
appear each to be separate and distinct on this the 4th Chain and
the life stream makes the Round from globe A to G and then
repeats the circuit in the second and subsequent Rounds.
Three Rounds of the globes have been made and the fourth is
in progress now, the life
being concentrated on globe D. Indeed
it is the prodigious concentration of the Root-Manu on the globes
in turn that occasions the circuit. The globes from which the life
has passed on remain in slight activity only in obscuration it is
called till the life stream reaches them again in the next Round.
99
THE WEB OF THE UNIVERSE
A correspondence to much of this is found in our own person-
ality. The sleep of the physical body at night denotes the transfer-
ence of activity to the next subtler vehicle. The physical body is
in obscuration till the morning. Similarly for brief periods during
the day, if the mind be exercised in thought alone, the physical
body is out of focus, obscured. Concentration decides the instru-
ment that shall be active.
A study of the Earth Chain is a study in essence of the whole
Scheme. Just as in embryology one may trace the evolution of
the physical form through all the earlier stages of development
from the simple cell, so in the first three Rounds of our Chain the
work of the first three Chains is
recapitulated. On these Rounds
certain work is done rapidly that took untold ages of effort on the
earlier Chains. The Scheme works onwards to the climax of its
involution in the fourth Round of its fourth Chain.
In the fourth Round our humanity takes a share in the pioneer
task of the building of the new forms. In this
respect the Round
differs from all the preceding, and the narrative outlined in the
S.D., Vol. II, Part III, is of profound interest to-day.
The Rounds are the big and important divisions of a Chain's
manifestation.
During the fourth Round balance and adjustment are achieved
and three final Rounds comprise the synthetic culminating work
of the Chain. The urge of the life on the first three Rounds is
towards the outermost of vehicles and principles the physical;
the urge on the three last is to return towards the innermost. The
middle, the present, Round is involved in the keen struggle attend-
ing the use and mastery of the densest body touched in the whole
Chain.
The fifth Round, the first of the synthetic three, is concerned
with the Mental principle and its
perfection. This entails the com-
plete development and use of the causal body (the spiritual,
the
"
celestial
"
body) as an instrument of self-consciousness and the
unfolding of the divine faculty of omnipresence. The fifth Round
too, it is said, witnesses the
"
day of judgment
"
a period of sort-
ing out and adjustment in which those Egos offering no promise
of attaining the goal of the Chain are withdrawn from further
participation in its work. In the aura of the Seed-Manu they are
said to await the development of the next Chain to a suitable point
100
APPENDIX
Before they can proceed further. The sixth Round is concerned
with the Intuitional principle, and its
perfection leads to omni-
science. The seventh Round similarly with the Will, the per-
fection of which principle means omnipotence within the limits
of our Scheme. Such an attainment as this is so vast as to be in-
comprehensible at present, yet contained in the simple precept
"
Be ye therefore perfect even as your Father . . ." (Matt. V, 48)
and in the promise of another ancient scripture
"
the soul of
man is immortal and its future growth and splendour have no
limits ".
The following table sets out in brief the inter-relations men-
tioned :
7 & 3 Schemes - - - - The Solar System
The Sub-races are like children in a family they are successive
in birth and then are contemporary; for instance, the five sub-races
of the fifth Root-Race are all
numerically represented to-day in
the world.
The Root-Races similarly. The third (Black), fourth (Yellow),
and fifth (White) are the humanity of to-day, in incarnation.
The Globes again similarly, though here the dominance of one
is more pronounced.
The immediate application of all this to our own times is that
just as the first three Races of our earth were recapitulatory of the
earlier Rounds, so the last three Races are anticipatory of the work
to be accomplished on the fifth, sixth and seventh Rounds. That
which will be the common achievement of average humanity in
these later Rounds is
just possible of achievement by individuals
of our humanity to-day. The division of the sexes that occurred
in the third Race corresponded to a similar process in the third
101
THE WEB OF THE UNIVERSE
Round, and the fifth Round will see the complementary reuniqrf
in the divine hermaphrodite. Our fifth Race foreshadows this in
the case only of the loftiest of our humanity.
We are in the fifth Root-Race (and the fifth sub-race of that)
and hence particularly is the principle of Mind dominant with
its limitation and illumination. The lower mind in the previous
Race, in association with the emotional nature (form and life),
was developed to a marvellous degree of automatic responsiveness
to sensation. Everything sensed is recorded indelibly in the lower
mind though we may not realise it in waking consciousness. Tnis
amazing aptitude of the lower mind is the triumphant culmina-
tion of the work of the earlier Rounds in general and of our own
first four Races in particular. The methods employed may be
traced by the student intent on pursuing this
study in greater
detail, assisted by the symbolism of the world religions as set out
in the S.D. The mystery of the subconsciousness (the subject
of so much psychological research to-day) and its
faculty of pas-
sive retentiveness are both revealed in such a study.
The fifth Round task is the realisation by humanity of the
powers of the higher mind in conjunction with the lower their
union in short. That which applies to average humanity in terms
of Rounds may be anticipated by individuals in terms of Races
here and now.
The Mind is the instrument of understanding, and the occult
teaching implies that it must be prepared for its mission of serving
as the channel of wisdom before that sixth Round when Wisdom
will be arrayed in all her glory.
The advent of the sixth sub-race of this the fifth Root-Race and
the fact that from it the great sixth Root-Race will be born makes
the study of the Rounds of immediate application. Evidence of
the spirit
of service and co-operation is not wanting and, though
we live in early times comparatively, the ancient wisdom points
the way of progress unerringly for those who will sec.
