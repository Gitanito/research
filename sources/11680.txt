   Zhi Hu forum (Posted on 12-24-2021) 
  
  It was a very serene feeling that I clearly perceived all my organs ceased function gradually, it started from my feet then one by one up to the lung; no pain. I worried about whether I would experience difficulty breathing when it reached my chest, but it turned out to be pain free. After all the organs were inoperative, I lay flat, rising and floating vertically. At that moment, my only thought was that I had to tell my family I was dead.  

  A chubby woman in a medieval white robe and wearing a white sleeping hat with fungus shaped brim greeted me with a smile. Slowly I flew into a dark space, tilted upward in a steady way, and there was a gleaming light very far away. On the way, there was a set of 3-dimensional shapes that composed of light. Although it was light, I knew that it is some sort of material which is rather a law of the universe. Its appearance is similar to a treble clef, and there is a long, lit arm reaching out from the right side and a three-dimensional spiral line underneath it, which became smaller progressively. Additionally, there were some other complicated structures in the middle that I could not remember.  

  It was a very, very comfortable feeling.  

  Later I thought about my kids being too young so that I have to go back. Instantly I woke up. I was 37 years old then.  

  I am no longer afraid of death ever since, however I cherish every day now. I tried my best to learn as much as I can and work hard effectively that I have no time to waste, not bothered to maintain complex relationships, and not willing to tell any lies.  

  As time went by I remember more of my experience that I had acute asthma which caused me to stop breathing temporarily. I took some Chinese herbal medicine and recovered. My health becomes much better, emotions are stable, and personality is calmer afterward.
