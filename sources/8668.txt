  Experience description: &nbsp;         	Hello,&nbsp; This is a difficult story   	for me to tell, but it is absolutely true.    	
  	I had married a Canadian and had gone from Australia to live with him in   	Canada. We had two small boys.&nbsp; I had been there for four years and our   	marriage was rubbing along.&nbsp; We got on well and although we did have a lot   	of things in common there&nbsp;seemed to be&nbsp;no really deep love or real   	understanding between us.&nbsp; After the birth of my second son my mother   	asked me to come back to Australia, to bring the children for a visit.
  &nbsp;    	She sent me the fare and I came home.   	We lived in a small beachside town and there was no entertainment as such,   	so my mother, my uncle, some friends and I took to going to a small harbor   	side hotel on Saturday&nbsp;evenings, where a friend would play the piano and we   	would have a sing-along and just a couple of drinks in the public lounge.
  &nbsp;    	There was a dart board in the corner   	and one night there were five or six men playing darts for drinks. I walked   	over to watch them and saw this nice looking young man standing before the   	board getting ready to throw the darts. All of a sudden as I looked at him,   	there was a great voice inside me that said&quot; Oh, there you are!&nbsp; I've been   	looking everywhere for you.&quot;&nbsp; I was really shocked and didn't really   	know what had happened, but I looked at him again and told myself that he   	was most likely a sugarcane farmer with a fat wife and half a dozen   	children.&nbsp;&nbsp;
  &nbsp;    	We left shortly after that and I   	didn't think of him again.&nbsp; But the next weekend we went to the same hotel   	and he was there again, playing darts.&nbsp; I have no idea what prompted me to   	do it as I don't play darts, but I went up to him and bet him a pint that I   	would win.&nbsp; Of course I didn't, but after the game he came over to my table   	and introduced himself to my mother and my friends and stayed talking to us   	all.&nbsp; He asked could he see me again and I said &quot;no&quot; as I was married.
  &nbsp;    	Then he invited us all down to visit   	the dredge he was working on the following day.&nbsp; He was a British seaman who   	had come out here to work on the ships as a seaman. We all went to see the   	boat and he gave us a nice lunch.&nbsp; He became friends with my Uncle who lived   	with us and used to come to see us all on the weekends when he wasn't   	working. He used to help my mother around the garden and was very good with   	my two little boys.
  &nbsp;    	After a couple of months the dredge   	work was finished and he went to Brisbane to get another ship, but he kept   	writing to us.&nbsp; He had been away for a month when I had news that my husband   	who was still in Canada had died in a car crash. This was in 1958 and travel   	wasn't as easy then as it is now, so I never did go back to Canada.
  &nbsp;    	The young man came back to visit us   	and after awhile&nbsp;he asked me to marry him&nbsp; I hadn't really wanted to, as he   	was a seaman and would be away from home a lot. But I did.&nbsp; He adopted my   	children, we bought a house and lived and loved together for forty   	years&nbsp;until he died of cancer in 1998.
  &nbsp;    	He is absolutely the love of my life,   	as I was of his.&nbsp; He was a wonderful father to my children and a&nbsp;marvelous   	&nbsp;grandfather to their children. Our only sorrow was that we didn't have more   	children, but we had a wonderful life together and I wouldn't have missed a   	day of it.    	Iris.    	&nbsp;
