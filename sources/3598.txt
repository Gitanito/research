 This was a work of pique produced by a physician whose earlier work on phrenology had been ignored or dismissed out of hand by the British medical establishment.  Hollander (1864-1934) was an Austrian who came to England in 1883 and tried to establish a simplified version of phrenology (11 rather than 35 cerebral organs) on a recognized scientific basis.  He also edited the Phrenological Record (1892-1893), the Ethological Journal (1909-1911, 1922), and the Gall Journal.  Yale University; BL; Wellcome Library.
