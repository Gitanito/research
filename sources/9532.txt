  		              		Experience Description   

    A tunnel opened and  at the end of  was a light such as I had never seen. There were people and deceased family members. I moved swiftly to the light and was very lucky. A figure, who looked like a  a monk, stepped in front of me to  prevent me from going further. I tried to step around him, but he held me back. It became clear that I had to go back. I woke up, disappointed.
