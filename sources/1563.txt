PHYSICAL SÉANCE ROOM RECOLLECTIONS
Compilation Album No. 1 (2014)
Wonderful Memories of Physical Phenomena as told by Senior Spiritualists
CD Review by Steve Hume:
A couple of years ago I had the pleasure of interviewing Mrs Jean Scott, former President of
Cresswell Spiritualist Church in Northumberland. The reason for this was that I had been
asked to review a reissue of A Path Prepared, a short biography of the physical medium Isa
Northage, for The Journal of The Society for Psychical Research. Mrs Northage was alleged
to have produced some quite remarkable and novel phenomena, during the inter-war and post-
war years, by witnesses who had submitted their personal accounts for publication in the
book. Yet she had slipped out of public memory. This was despite the fact that her séances
had, apparently, been widely reported in the Spiritualist press at the time. After remarking to
Leslie Price, who reviewed the book in Psypioneer,1
that it was a shame that, by then,
witnesses of Mrs Northage’s activities would probably be quite difficult to find; I embarked
on what I anticipated would be a long and frustrating search for some. However, by one of
those curious acts of fate that life tends to assault us with sometimes, I discovered, the very
next day, that a friend of my stepmother’s had been a close companion of Isa Northage for
many years – hence the interview with Mrs Scott.
Mrs Scott’s passing in July this year, reminded me of the
attempts by the Noah’s Ark Society for Physical Mediumship
(NAS), to build up an archive of audio recordings of senior
Spiritualists recounting their experiences with the great physical
mediums of yesteryear. During my time in the NAS, I had had
the privilege of hearing one or two of these, and I found them
fascinating. So, the news that Stewart Alexander, a physical
medium of note himself,2
and former President and Archive
officer of the NAS, had decided to release some of these
recorded reminiscences (plus some extra tracks) on a double CD
album, was welcome news indeed.
This collection consists largely of a digitisation of an album previously released by the NAS
on audio cassette in 1995. Eight mediums are covered, ranging from Helen Duncan, through
Ronald Strong and William Olsen, to Alec Harris. There is also a very rare recording (circa
1951) of Gladys Osborne Leonard (the famous trance medium who contributed to the
legendary series of communications involving Sir Oliver Lodge’s deceased son, Raymond,
and who was extensively tested by other SPR researchers.) giving a personal sitting to the
Reverend Charles Drayton Thomas, the well-known psychical researcher. There are also a
number of extra tracks, not included in the original NAS collection. These include an account

by the well-known teaching medium, Ivy Northage, of her experiences with, amongst others,
Helen Duncan and Alec Harris.
I think that it would be fair to say that the audio quality varies greatly between tracks. Indeed,
Stewart remarks on this in his introduction. But this is hardly surprising given that most of the
speakers made their own recordings using (probably) inexpensive equipment onto analogue
cassette tape, which tends to degrade somewhat over time and worsens in quality further with
every subsequent copy away from the original. That said, most of the speakers are easily
understood apart from, in places, the Osborne Leonard recording, which is hardly surprising
given its age.
After an introduction by Stewart, the collection begins with part of a lecture given by Mr
Douglass Lawrence in 1976 at Reading Spiritualist Church. This extract sets the tone for the
following accounts, by concentrating on the moral prerequisites for the successful
development of physical mediumship, and dispels a number of common misconceptions
concerning this. Some of the alleged mechanics of materialisation phenomena are also
covered. Of special interest to me was Lawrence’s contention that, in order to appear in a
recognisable form, spirit entities have to be able to, mentally, hold the details of self-image
that they wish the ectoplasm to form around. The implication is that this is far from easy, and
is sometimes only partially successful. Lawrence also gives an account of being allowed to
handle a sheet of ectoplasm which stretched about ten feet across and five or six feet to the
front, after it had emerged from an unnamed medium. The substance in this form is described
as being ‘translucent, glistening – beautiful’, the texture like ‘finest quality silk’. This
reminded me of Harry Edwards’ description of ectoplasm with the medium Jack Webber and
differs quite markedly from the ‘cheesecloth’ description beloved of sceptics.
Lawrence also speaks of his experiences with Helen Duncan. These include being invited by
Albert, Mrs Duncan’s chief control, to closely examine the interior of the mouth of the
materialised form of an old lady, whereupon Lawrence found saliva, gums (‘top and bottom’),
but no teeth. Lawrence remarks that, at this point in her life, Duncan had almost a full set of
natural teeth and, in any case, one could often (but not always) see the medium at the same
time as the materialised spirit forms.
There follow numerous similar accounts, by others, including more examples of Mrs
Duncan’s mediumship.
Of special interest to me, however, were those who spoke of experiences with Duncan and
Alec Harris; the former because of her very controversial career, and the infamous trial in
1944; the latter because I know personally someone who, as a young man, sat with Harris and
whose account of the spectacular full-form materialisations he witnessed broadly matches the
descriptions given here, and also in Harris’ biography They Walked Among Us.3
As already mentioned, tracks 5-8 on the second CD are devoted to the recollections of Ivy
Northage, the well-known teaching medium who was a close friend of Helen Duncan who
she, nevertheless, describes as ‘rough’, ‘frightening’ and, perhaps most tellingly - capable of
being ‘foolish’. It is for that reason that Mrs Northage’s extremely articulate and frank
account stands out for me. She describes a séance attended in the company of a friend whose
own distinctively marked séance trumpets were apported by Duncan’s guides into the room

from his home one hundred miles away, and also how she witnessed multiple materialised
forms appearing under good red light. But Northage also recounts an occasion when she and
Mrs Duncan were having lunch together in a café, when the medium invited her into the
toilets, disrobed, and showed her extremely severe bruising that covered her abdomen. This,
Mrs Duncan claimed had been the result of white light introduced into a séance the previous
day by a thoughtless sitter which had caused the ectoplasm to instantly whip back into her
body.
With Harris, Mrs Northage describes a séance where around twenty materialised forms
appeared under good red light – from a seven foot tall Red Indian guide, wearing a headdress
that reached to the floor, to a small boy of about seven years of age who performed a
headstand. All the time, Harris was clearly visible as, on this occasion, the cabinet curtains
were open all of the time and the forms did not ‘build up’ as with other mediums, but just
appeared with a ‘shimmer’ and disappeared just as suddenly in like manner. Yet they were
solid enough for the aforementioned Indian (who did not speak) to demonstrate his name by
picking up a flower vase to pour the water on the floor, only for the next materialised spirit
form (a very tall and ‘austere’ looking lady) to loudly berate the unfortunate incarnate
acquaintance that she had come to meet, as to the existence of the resulting large puddle.
With both Helen Duncan and Alec Harris, and the other mediums mentioned, we are told of
multiple materialised forms of wildly differing ages, racial groups, and physical build,
appearing in good red light very close to the sitters – eighteen inches, in one case, with
Duncan. There are also numerous examples of the forms being recognisable to relatives and
also giving evidential information, in various forms, in further support of identity.
Clearly, if one is of a mind to believe the sceptics about all this stuff, then these witnesses
were all cretinous to a quite alarming degree. One could be left wondering how they could be
taken in so easily. Could an addled brain and ‘will to believe’ really produce such astounding
confabulations?
There is simply too much contained in this collection to cover all of the accounts in detail.
Suffice to say, they are mostly of a similar stamp to those just outlined, at least to the extent
that they fly in the face of theories involving regurgitated cheesecloth, hidden wires and
trapdoors, or accomplices dressed in black gimp-suits etc.
Speaking as someone with a fair amount of experience of sitting in physical circles myself; on
listening to these recollections, I was struck by a couple of things: –
Firstly, it is obvious that these earlier mediums were producing phenomena of a much more
advanced order, at least in terms of full form materialisation, than has been apparent in more
recent years, at least with the few modern mediums that have become publicly known. That
is, of course, if the recollections of the witnesses are accurate and truthful.
Secondly, I would agree that most people do not have much of a clue as to how fallible human
cognition (especially related to memory) can be under some circumstances. With regard to
this, for example, I was struck by the fact that some of the witnesses describe materialisations
as exhibiting vivid colours when, in my experience, red light practically renders one colour
blind.
However, I have also witnessed confabulation and exaggeration on the part of sceptics myself,
in the opposite direction, quite recently, where events that were regarded as being ‘suspicious’
269
had actually been pointed out by the medium herself very early on in a séance a number of
times. On this occasion it was the sceptic’s memory that was faulty (he had completely
blanked the medium’s attempts to inform everyone what she’d noticed) and it was only the
audio recording of the event that proved this later.
The account given by the late, and exceptionally cautious, researcher Tony Cornell
concerning his one séance with Alec Harris in the 1950’s, in his book Researching the
Paranormal also springs to mind in this regard.4
Cornell’s account, based on notes he
completed shortly after the event, is truly remarkable for the number of glaring internal
inconsistencies contained within that do not, logically, support his contention that the whole
business was fraud on Harris’ part. When I recently questioned a senior SPR member who
knew Cornell about this I was told that Cornell had admitted privately, in front of witnesses at
an SPR event that, in fact, there was much that he could not explain about the Harris séance
he attended.
A great deal more could be said about this. But, in short, especially as I have witnessed some
of the stronger phenomena myself (including with, ironically, Stewart Alexander) I am not
persuaded that all the contributors to this collection were all either lying or deluded. The
phenomena described are simply too extreme, and the accounts too consistent, to be written
off casually just because people sometimes do not remember things 100% accurately, or are
(in my opinion) often a bit too accepting of weaker phenomena that could have been produced
by ‘normal means’, and are innocently subject to confirmation bias on occasion – as are all
human beings, sceptics included. As has been pointed out more than once by others, if we
were to reject witness testimony in the law courts in like manner, then our legal system would
scarcely be able to function and miscarriages of justice would probably be a lot more common
than they are.
Unfortunately, at the time of writing, it seems unlikely that physical mediumship of such an
advanced nature will become available again. The pressures of modern life, combined with
attendant addictions to facile entertainment, mean that it is exceptionally difficult to find
people who will happily sit in development regularly for the extreme length of time that it can
take to develop genuine physical phenomena to the most advanced stages. Jean Scott’s
husband, John, told me that he knew of circles in rural Northumberland many years ago where
the sitters would cycle or walk many miles after an arduous day’s work to sit for
development. When Dr Barrie Colvin and I attempted to form such a group a few years ago,
we could not even find people who were prepared commit to driving a short distance.
Stewart Alexander has done us all a huge favour by making this collection available. I am
sure that anyone with the slightest genuine interest in this subject, whether they be convinced
Spiritualists, or of a more (non ideological) sceptical bent, will find it compelling listening.

H. N. DE FREMERY AND THE
‘HARRIS AFFAIR’
It is exactly a century ago that this unfortunate
affair developed in the Netherlands and changed
all those involved.
Let me introduce the star players of this drama.
Hendrik (Henry) Nicholaas de Fremery (1868 -
1940) was an important man in the Dutch
spiritistic scene. Author of several books, about 6
brochures for Harmonia, a talented painter and
sculptor, lecturer, a man of great erudition and
dedication to the cause, de Fremery was an asset
to the movement.
(A word about Harmonia: In 1888 the
‘Broederbond (Fraternity) Harmonia’ was founded
in Utrecht, with the object to build a platform for
all the spiritist groups being active in the
Netherlands, and bring together Christian oriented
Spiritualists and Kardec Spiritists. This object was
only partially successful, but Harmonia soon
became influential and membership rose
continually over the years.)
Being the son of the maire of Monster, de Fremery’s religious background was Remonstrant,
a Dutch brand of freethinking Protestantism. But his natural inclination was more towards
Theosophy than to a Christian philosophy. In 1894 de Fremery married Anna, the daughter of
Hendrik Jan Schimmel, (1823-1906) a noted poet, playwright and spiritist in those days,
who had a great influence on the sensitive and philosophically inclined young man.
After a career as artillery officer in the military, kind of obligatory for people of the higher
classes, he quit in 1902 to devote all his talents and time to the cause he came to believe in.
Coming from a well-to-do family, earning money for a living seemed not to have been an
issue.
For a number of years there was an important periodical for all spiritists in the Netherlands,
Het Toekomstig Leven (HTL), founded in 1897 by Johannes Simon Göbel (1847-1916) who
succeeded in maintaining high quality contents till his lamented death in 1916.
In 1902 de Fremery joined him as second editor, and enriched the bi-weekly magazine with
many interesting articles.
Apart from his writing, de Fremery travelled the country to lecture on spiritist subjects; and to
know what he was talking about, he attended a multitude of seances with mediums in Holland
including those visiting from abroad. Occasionally he encountered frauds, which shocked
271
him, but also sharpened his awareness of the tricks involved. De Fremery was a close friend
of Alfred Voût Peters, a well known British psychometric medium who visited Holland on
many occasions, always staying with de Fremery in his villa ‘Meentwijck’ in Bussum. Often
de Fremery accompanied Voût Peters as his interpreter.
Firmly convinced of spiritist truths, de Fremery’s interest in spiritism was nevertheless
predominantly scientific. Although no scientist himself, he was more than interested in
investigating the phenomena. Later in life he became a good friend of famous Dutch
parapsychologist Prof. Dr.W.H.C.Tenhaeff (1894-1981).
In his scientific interests de Fremery stood more or less alone in the spiritist community.
Most people didn’t need scientific proof to believe, and most mediums were not eager to
cooperate in experiments by scientists.
This became painfully clear in 1906, when de Fremery championed Floris Jansen (1881-
1937), a promising ex- medical student who worked out plans for a laboratory in Amsterdam,
to develop strictly scientific experiments. One of Floris’ inspirations came from the French
scientist Paul Joire who developed the ‘Sthenometer’ to measure ‘psychic energy’.
De Fremery was happy to be Floris’ mentor, promoting his plan which suited de Fremery’s
own interests perfectly. Floris Jansen became the first Dutch parapsychologist, decades
before others went into the laboratory to test paranormal phenomena with scientific means.
De Fremery had hoped for support from the readers of HTL, but that never happened. Several
times he explained Jansen’s plans and asked for support in money, and for mediums who
were willing to take part in experiments. The effect was so disappointing that de Fremery
wrote in HTL of October 15, 1906:
“I really start to doubt if the subscribers of HTL are my congenial spirits. I’m ashamed to
admit to it openly. The lack of interest has painfully struck me.”
The laboratory existed from 1906 till 1908, when lack
of support and lack of money meant the end of this
early, worthwhile and unique parapsychological
experimentation. Drs. Wim Kramer has been
researching Floris Jansen extensively.5
I only mention
the case in passing, because it is representative of de
Fremery’s scientific inclination which was, and still is,
exceptional in the spiritist community in Holland.
Another player of importance was J.S. Göbel, ◄
already mentioned. He and de Fremery got along well.
Göbel, 20 years de Fremery’s senior, was a friendly
man with a background in education. He was a natural
peace maker, a man most people liked, a hard worker
with a high standard of integrity.
5
. – For example, Wim Kramer’s paper at 2012 SPR conference “Snapshots of the missing link: the Amsterdam
laboratory of Floris Jansen” (1906-1908).
272
Göbel was one of three people (the others being F.W.H.van Straaten and P.A.J. Nepveu) who
founded ‘de Broederbond Harmonia’ in 1888, the longest existing spiritist organisation in
the Netherlands. As mentioned above, the object of Göbel was an organisation in which
Kardec Spiritists and the spiritists who didn’t believe in reïncarnation would both find a
home. For Göbel these differences of opinion were not the most important; the spiritist
conviction that there is life after death could, he hoped, bridge the differences of opinion.
Others were less tolerant. Göbel battled with his co-founder
F.W.H. van Straaten (1829-1902) ◄ who also founded the
‘Spiritualistisch Weekblad’, the only periodical of standing till
Göbel began HTL in 1897. The ‘Spiritualistisch Weekblad’ of
newspaper format, lost subscribers and HTL, a magazine,
gained many. Van Straaten was a difficult man, not inclined to
work together or respect other people’s opinions. From 1888
till his death in 1902 he was chairman of Harmonia, which
function fell on Göbel after his demise.
In 1906 Göbel's chairmanship of Harmonia had become so
difficult that he left this post to his successor and concentrated
on HTL, a periodical moulded after the best Spiritualistic
magazines of those days in England and America.
F.W.H. van Straaten never became part of the Harris Affair because he died in 1902, but his
son, G.A.W. van Straaten, hiding behind his self proclaimed title as ‘best spiritist ever’,
played an unsavoury role in the 1914 developments.
A further important figure in the spiritist scene and in the
drama that was about to unfold was Piet Goedhart, (1860 -
1935 ) ► a man who comes across from the pages of HTL
as utterly dislikable. He was de Fremery’s nemesis, from a
lower class family, a self-made man, like Göbel a
‘schoolmaster’, undoubtedly clever but with undisguised
aggression against any who dared contradict his inflexible
opinions. He was, as his obituary says, feared by his
enemies. We can only imagine how hard it was for soft
spoken well bred people like de Fremery and Göbel to put
up with Goedhart’s lack of manners.
It must have been a happy moment for Goedhart when the Harris Affair brought him de
Fremery’s head on a plate, a moment of triumph he anticipated and gleefully helped along for
many years, as we can distill from his venomous critiques in HTL on de Fremery’s writings
and person long before 1914. Goedhart loved to inflict hurt on the people who were morally
and intellectually his superior. Parapsychologist Dr. Willem Tenhaeff called him
‘emotionally immature’.
We all know the type. Without Goedhart’s role in bringing about de Fremery’s undeserved
downfall, that would never have happened.
273
After the death of Göbel, Goedhart’s militant fanatism, no longer dampened by moderation,
took over the spirit of HTL and the once so balanced magazine went, in tone and diversity,
into rapid decline.
Goedhart left Harmonia in 1934 – based on a short obituary in Harmonia’s periodical
Spiritische Bladen of 1935 ‘not without incidents’, to start his own magazine
‘Grensgebieden,’ which existed – as far as I know – for 3 years.
Harmonia had to read of Goedhart’s demise in the newspaper; they never got an
announcement of his death.
And then the centerpiece of it all: Rev. Susanna Harris (1854-1932), medium large, invited
in 1914 by Goedhart and his ‘Vereeniging voor Psychisch Onderzoek’, which he founded in
The Hague. (nothing to do with the Dutch SPR).
Harris was at that time a well known direct voice medium, not a very common type of
mediumship. Nandor Fodor in his Encyclopaedia of Psychic Science mentions an accusation
of fraud in Norway (1920). Conan Doyle, in ‘The Wanderings of a Spiritualist’ writes about a
water test: her mouth was filled with coloured water, and still the voices came. He also
mentions how she failed to convince the SPR in Norway. But his evaluation of Harris, based
on his own experience was favorable. A report of this test is found in James Coates’ ‘Is
Spiritualism based on Facts or Fancy’ (1919).
Reading about Harris doesn’t clarify things. Maybe she had her genuine moments but I feel
she definitely knew quite well how to deceive a ‘believing’ public when the spirits didn’t turn
up, which might have happened often, as the extreme precautions she took against getting
exposed seem to testify. When a medium takes exaggarated measures against the possibility
of being found out, some bells are likely to start ringing, but not of the spirit kind. Probably
her extremely imposing figure (mentioned almost in every source) and her widely advertised
actions for womens rights and as ‘apostle for world peace’ (of which there is no proof) played
a part in her success, as it certainly did in Holland. A woman who does so much good can’t
be a cheater, many felt. But human nature is a lot more complicated than that.
Harris visited our country at the end of March 1914. The invitation the Vereeniging voor
Psychisch Onderzoek sent on March 16 mentions several planned seances: from March 31 till
April 7 in The Hague, and two others on April 8 and 9 in Amsterdam. By now we know that
there were several more seances for an undoubtedly not-too-critical public, in pitch dark,
trumpets talking, music box playing, under mainly the guidance of ‘Harmony’, who some of
the articles say was her own deceased child. (In HTL of June 1910 Harris was mentioned as
a relatively new psychometric medium giving an introductory demonstration as the sidekick
of English medium Alfred Voût Peters, who was very well known in Holland. There was no
mention of ‘direct voice’ mediumship, so probably she developed that talent later.)
The seance that rocked the spiritists in Holland was held on April 16 1914.
HTL, always out promptly on the 1st. and 15th of every month, was this time delayed: the
issue of April 15 came a few days later.
The reason was a plea on the 14th from de Fremery to Göbel, as he was in doubt about Mrs
Harris, based on things he had heard and experienced at a Harris seance on April 9. He
274
planned to attend the seance of April 16, to find out if this doubt was misplaced or not. Göbel
was not pleased; his long article on Harris planned for the issue of April 15th was already
written and set. Nevertheless he complied, and the issue of April 15 was therefore a few days
late. Nevertheless there was nothing in the issue of April 15 about Harris. Possibly Göbel saw
a dark cloud coming his way, as Mrs Harris was very much admired all over spiritist Holland
and her seances were well attended. A spot on her reputation would damage not only her, but
the spiritist cause as well, something every spiritist was painfully aware of.
But Göbel could not control the subsequent events. The clouds became a storm of never
before seen proportions.
The issue of May 1 of HTL ▼ came out with a Supplement, both completely filled with the
‘Harris Affair’, as it would be called over time.
The facts.
De Fremery gave his own impressions in a
lengthy article ‘My seances with Rev Mrs
Susanna Harris’, starting with a seance he
attended on April 9, after getting a
notification from de ‘Vereeniging voor
Psychisch Onderzoek’ in The Hague. This
was Goedhart’s society which o invited Mrs
Harris.
De Fremery had never attended a seance with a direct voice medium before, so he was very
interested and happy to pay f 5.- for entrance. The seance was held in Amsterdam, in theater
Odeon, still in existence.
De Fremery described the seance room: pitchblack curtains, doors where not a glimmer of
light could get through.
The evening before, on April 8, one instant the softest light peeped through the windows, not
having any effect on the complete darkness, but nevertheless, according to the medium ‘no
manifestations had been possible’. This was told to de Fremery by Mr. G.J.de Bruin,
chairman of Harmonia Amsterdam and the one responsible for the seance room.
At the seance of April 9, 11 women and 13 gentlemen were present, who were instructed to
hold each others hands; under no circumstances could the circle be broken, or dire
consequences for the medium would follow.
If feeling a trumpet or something else touching one’s body, one was instructed to say ‘thank
you’, and no one was to grip a trumpet. And the most important: no light, or the medium
could die.
These strict instructions must have put the fear of God into those present, and also some mild
wonder about the medium, into the people with more experience. It certainly did arise doubt
in de Fremery and de Bruin.
275
This is how de Fremery graphically describes Harris’s entrance:
“The imposing figure of Mrs Harris, followed by her interpreter, entered the room, and the
first thing she did was re-arrange the circle, by putting the ‘positive and negative elements’
alternately. Then, (like Mary Poppins), she opened her portmanteau from which she took
three folded trumpets and a music box. Unfolded, the trumpets were 1 meter in length and by
pouring water through them she showed that no devices were hidden inside. She put all three
near her knees on the ground. Then she proceeded with an even stronger warning than the
one given by the secretary of the Vereeniging voor Psychisch Onderzoek beforehand,
mentioning a medium gone blind and another losing his memory because of sitters’
misdeeds.”
De Fremery was appointed to sit at Harris’ left side and hold her hand. When everyone was
sufficiently subdued, the seance could begin, with loud singing of our anthem in utter
darkness. Then de Fremery told what happened next, and his scepticism is obvious. A deep
voice next to de Fremery said loudly ‘Good Evening’ and he almost jumped out of his chair.
A falsetto voice, ‘Harmony’, answered. ‘Spirits’ were saying banal things, to sitters who gave
all the information away. De Fremery was, understandably, not at all impressed. It was
obvious to him that the medium was groping for information and that ‘Harmony’ used the
vocal chords of the medium.
But the bass voice changed directions. De Fremery tried to find Harris’s left leg with his
right, but couldn’t. He then felt a trumpet slap his head. A message ‘don’t you dare to doubt
me’, maybe?
De Fremery decided to give the medium, for now,
the benefit of the doubt, but he had clear suspicions.
So he did what every critical sitter should have
done: listen to the medium’s breath, and how that
differed from, or synchonised with the voices,
which proceeded to dialogue alternately. His
listening at the chest of Harris was revealing: as a
voice stopped, she inhaled. The longer the talking,
the deeper the inhalation. For De Fremery there was
no longer any doubt about the voices: they were
Harris’ own.
That evening De Fremery went home, pondering
what he should do. He signed on for the seance of
April 16, and decided to talk it over with G.J. de
Bruin, who was invited in the fateful seance to sit
by her left side. He listened sharply, like de
Fremery had done a week before, and came to
identical conclusions.
De Fremery, knowing that he would, had asked the sitters to stay a while after the seance,
since he planned to confront the medium then and there, without the risk of physical damage
to the medium.
276
All would have gone according to plan, if not a Mr Richter, who had harboured his own
suspicions, had managed to crawl on hand and knees to grab the trumpets, something that
was strictly forbidden. He even took them apart.
No ‘spirit’ protested. The medium, oblivious to what transpired, went on speaking through
the third trumpet. Then Mr. Richter called out to make light. The medium was a fake, he
announced, and to prove it he had taken two of her trumpets without any objections from the
spirits or Mrs Harris. This was about 10 minutes before the planned end of the seance, for
which every sitter paid f 5.-, quite a large amount in those days.
De Bruin, in his capacity of chairman of Harmonia Amsterdam, tried to restore order, and
everybody started singing again. Lights were switched on, the medium ‘awoke’ and was,
mightily distressed.
Mr. Richter, the real ‘culprit’, had his own story. He was a member of a spiritist circle, and
there he heard from a medium friend that Mrs Harris was in the habit of hiding fresh flowers
in her volumous bosom to present them as ‘apports’. Light during a seance would have
exposed her and that the voices were all coming out of her own throat, said that medium, and
Mr. Richter believed her. With a talent for drama he decided to test Harris in his own way.
Later he said that he never planned what he did. He had just acted on the spur of the moment.
It was a deadly test. The happy dialogues continued, and Harris never felt it, till Richter
spoke out loud.
Later de Bruin testified that Harris’ left hand never left his, but her left foot was nowhere to
be found. The woman on the right side of Harris told de Fremery that the medium’s hand
wasn’t in hers most of the time. At strategic moments there were suspicious disappearances
of hands and legs to where nobody could follow, De bruin testified.
The absolute darkness and all the warnings were the conditions to keep the sitters in awe. Mrs
Harris never realised that this darkness was also her undoing, since she couldn’t prove she
wasn’t cheating either. After the seance she left in distress with her interpreter, and obviously
nobody stopped her to confront her.
In fact, I would suggest, only the people who were actually there at that fateful seance, and
who had conceived the idea to listen carefully and from close by, were the ones who had a
right to voice an opinion.
Belief is not proof. Backing up a well known medium, no matter what, is not proof of
anything either. Testifying based on Harris’ many good deeds for charity is the least proof of
all. But things got very much mixed up in what happened after April 16 1914.
The press was informed. De Fremery contacted ‘Het Vaderland’ and ‘Het Leven’,
newspapers normally favorably inclined towards Spiritualism. Mr de Bruin informed the
Telegraaf, a newspaper that was not of the highest moral standard.
Spiritists and other people read to their utter astonishment about the exposure of Mrs Harris.
And spiritists started to write letters, angry letters, to the editor of HTL. Göbel decided these
people needed space, and he gave it to them. The issue of May 1 1914 had a supplement, and
all 35 pages were easily filled with Harris. The issue was 10 days late. Harris must have been
the talk of the day.
277
1000 ‘Extra Extra, Read All About It’ (to paraphrase the musical ‘Tommy’) May 1 issues of
HTL were printed. Göbel was a man with foresight. It must have been the closest to a tabloid
event in our Calvinist country in those years, and how people must have enjoyed the scandal
and the chance to put their own rightous, hypocritical and deeply felt indignation in words,
and see them in print!
Understandably Göbel was not amused. In his opening article he mentions that de Fremery’s
accusation and also a piece by Mr. Richter that had reached, regrettably, several newspapers,
but counter arguments had been refused space in those newspapers. People were interested in
fraudulent mediums, not in their defence. (In hindsight, this informing of the press was
probably the biggest mistake in the whole affair.)
Göbel began the issue of May 1 with a long article about Mrs Harris and her many
accomplishments, meant as a worthy introduction to the medium and written before the
whole unfortunate affair
developed. Maybe this article of
praise and thankfulness to
Goedhart and his Vereeniging for
Psychisch Onderzoek which had
invited Mrs Harris was one of the
reasons Göbel backed her up all
the way, although he must have
known that de Fremery’s powers
of observation stood for
something.
We will never know what
transpired, but Göbel made a
choice, a good one for the peace in
spiritist Holland, but a bad one for
honesty and friendship: he let de
Fremery down, in more ways than
one, as we shall see.
Here is the letter from March 16
sent by the secretary of the
Vereeniging voor Psychisch
onderzoek in The Hague,
announcing the Harris visit and
the planned seances.►
It’s best to follow the many articles in HTL for chronological purposes.
On Sunday, March 29 Harris held a moving speech for a full auditorium in The Hague to
thank her hosts and promote her worthy causes for peace, and she also recalled the times she
was saved from danger by her ‘voices’, for her spirit friends were always with her.
Later seances of the first days of April were also remembered fondly by spiritists who felt
obliged to honor the medium that was ‘so villified and suffered so much’. People chose sides.
278
Harris was the underdog, the poor accused, and had they not all heard the voices of their
loved ones through the trumpets of the medium?
“I know that all the others were satisfied and happy too”, one woman said. And “I write this
alone for the people who are denying these things”, said another.
Of course Goedhart, sharpening his pencil, thought for some time how to place his dynamite
in the most effective way. His article was a frontal attack on de Fremery, who, factually had
not been the one disturbing the seance.
But Goedhart knew ways to blame him anyway, and here are his arguments:
De Fremery ‘should have known’ that Mr Richter was planning an attack, and he ‘should
have kept him from doing so’. He could, according to Goedhart, have ‘anticipated what
Richter had in mind’. (How? Clairvoyantly?) De Fremery also should have made sure the
medium was scientifically searched before the seance began. His listening to Harris’ breath
and his subsequent conclusions were of no scientific value, decided Goedhart, since
obviously de Fremery, “always thinking he knew more than anyone else”, was too
inexperienced to be capable of understanding that what happened was totally normal.
Conclusion: the medium was no fraud at all.
And, Goedhart added, de Fremery’s shallowness and arrogance was, of course, backed up by
an equally shallow and arrogant person, Mr de Bruin, who naturally judged things psychical
like his mentor de Fremery. Goedhart then continued to ‘prove’ that the medium ‘of course’
was completely genuine.
Later Goedhart was accused himself for not having organised a try-out seance before Harris
was set loose in the country, to test her with some scientists present. It was her first visit to
the Netherlands, and Goedhart must have been aware of controversies around her
mediumship in other countries. But Goedhart knew how to divert attention from his own
omissions by blaming someone else. He ended his venomous piece with:
“Mr de Fremery would do best to publicly retract his hasty conclusions, and study diligently
for a number of years before writing about these matters again.”
That was a strange advice to a man who had already written several books and brochures
about spiritism that are still among the best ever written by a Dutch spiritualist. (Goedhart
never wrote a book nor a brochure.)
Back to April 16. Göbel placed a letter in HTL from a woman who actually was there at that
fateful seance. It didn’t go that well, even before the disturbance of Mr Richter.
My own experience with modern Harmonia seances, a medium in front of a hall full of eager
people, is enough to recognise what happened in 1914: the desperate medium plucking
information out of the blue that isn’t recognised and the incompetence covered up by “of
course you didn’t recognise her, you didn’t know her, did you?”
The woman herself was visited by the deceased daughter of a friend, who ‘gives her best to
mother.’ Even William Stead (died in 1912) was using the trumpet. There were rappings.
And a German spirit singing a song (in every seance the same) together with the public,
279
which sang so hard that the trumpet voice was drowned. When our reporter mentioned this,
the trumpet fell on the ground: conditions had been broken.
Then Mr Richter ended it all and everybody was terribly anxious about the medium, and not
to make light before she herself gave permission. When the light was made at last, the
shocked sitters found Harris on the ground, blood trickling from her mouth.
Several people now gave their opinions in HTL, in longer and shorter fashion. R.O. van
Holthe tot Echten, an important man in spiritist Holland, wrote a lengthy article in which he
brought up several other mediums who were genuine and nevertheless something seemed
amiss for the people who were there, one of them being Eusapia Paladino, of whom we now
know that she occasionally took to cheating, but nevertheless she was one of the best physical
mediums ever. Van Holthe tot Echten didn’t seem to realise that ‘proof’ about other mediums
doesn’t constitute ‘proof’ that Harris was in the clear.
Then, again, Goedhart came with accusations that de Fremery was planning to find fault with
Harris from the beginning ‘like he always does when he visits a seance’, because ‘there is
nothing he likes better than exposing mediums’
Goedhart also ‘knew’ what de Bruin and
de Fremery talked about before the
seance, although he was not there to
listen. It was ‘obvious’ to Goedhart that
‘a plot was well under way’. He rambled
on. De Fremery was a coward, an
unscientific nitwit, fantasy prone, a
nobody who had no clue of what a good
medium looked like, and more in the
same vein. In the end his conclusion was
that “the one-sided claims of de Fremery,
with disregard of everything that points
to the great psychic gifts of Mrs Harris,
show us that Mr de Fremery in the field of
psychic investigation can only reap the
laurels of superficially minded people,
like he did before. We (the readers) will
know what to think of his verdict on Mrs
Harris.”
Then a new player in the Harris circus
came with his own arguments, explaining
in many words how wrong de Fremery
was, because he, G.A.W. van Straaten
being the most experienced and
knowledgeble of all, said so.
The arrogance of van Straaten knew no
limits, bringing up the 2000 seances he visited, though surprisingly without apparently
encountering any fraud.
280
Van Straaten never published in HTL till then, nor did he do any useful work for spiritism or
Harmonia that we know of, but suddenly it was suggested de Fremery should listen to him
and do as he, van Straaten ‘advises him to do’.
Some fragments from this letter, were given, by Göbel, in the space of 8 columns:
“You are undoubtedly fallen, dear brother, and therefore you have made yourself impossible
in the spiritist world for a long time. But not we are the ones to punish, for who of us is
without sin and faults? Let me try to give you a hand to lift you up, and do accept this good
advice, given to you not from anger in my heart but in love for a brother who (maybe) out of
an exaggerated feeling of honesty made a faux pas. Take your leave as editor of HTL, in the
interest of this worthy periodical, in respect to the head-editor and in the interest of our
case. This is not fun, I mean it , it is necessary.” And he added: “Administrators are plenty
around to help brother Göbel in your place.”
Administrator, mind you, of a man who had at that point in history done more intelligent and
creative work for spiritism than anyone else, devoting his life and his many talents to the
cause he believed in.
Von Straaten also told de Fremery that he was guilty of putting back the cause of spiritism 10
years, that he had slapped spiritism and the peace movement (!) of England and the USA in
the face, that he had ‘ungentlemanlike’ kicked and insulted a ‘poor, defenseless woman’ who
devoted her whole life to worthy causes, and on top of all that he claimed of ‘brother de
Fremery’ that he ‘always visits seances’ with the sole objective to discover cheating, with his
‘aura of mistrust’ etc .
Knowing what we know about de Fremery’s character, I can only imagine his disgust at this
despicable and false ‘advisor’. who certainly had his own hidden agenda in accusing a man
far superior to himself, of something he didn’t even do, or ever would have wished to happen
the way it did.
Most amazing maybe was that Göbel, a fair and honest man, gave this nobody so much room
to throw his ‘loving’ mud in the face of his friend, while he refused to place a very important
article of the man who was actually there and even presided the seance of April 16: G.J. de
Bruin.
De Bruin was understandably vexed about that, and decided that his voice was worth hearing.
So his planned article ▲ was sent to the subscribers by de Bruin himself, mentioning the fact
that Göbel refused to place it in HTL, and that consequently, although many people favorably
disposed to the medium got plenty of space, the people who were there, de Bruin and
Richter, were never heard about what really transpired. (Göbel’s own excuse for that is at the
end of this article).
In hindsight this is one of the most confusing aspects of the whole affair. What made Göbel
choose sides with the likes of Goedhart and van Straaten? Did he fear an escalation by
printing anti-Harris material? Was he afraid of the venomous pen of the two gentlemen? He
certainly had experience with the father of G.A.W. van Straaten, back from 1888 on, and
maybe his leaving the post of Chairman of Harmonia in 1906, with a lot of painful problems,
281
had something to do with the son, but this is pure speculation. We also know that Goedhart
was craving for more influence, which he accomplished almost the moment Göbel died.
De Bruin’s version of this fateful seance was quite interesting.
He forcefully denied Goedhart’s accusations that there had been a conspiracy, as he also did
in the Telegraaf article of April 29. As mentioned above, Richter had no plan, it just came up
during the seance.
Neither de Fremery, nor de Bruin were informed about
Richter’s plans, simply because there had been no such
thing. De Bruin also stated that he, Richter and de
Fremery were not the only ones with misgivings.
Several others had been to one or more seances and they
had seen enough of Harris, one of them being Dr.
K.H.E. de Jong (1872-1960), ► a noted classicus who
was also a well known active spiritist. De Jong disturbed
one of the earlier seances (April 2) with accusations, as
we read in the May 1 issue of HTL.
The inventory of the Harris Affair papers contains
several letters of de Jong to de Fremery, warning him to
be very alert for deception in Harris’ seances. In de
Jong’s mind there was no doubt about her being a
trickster.
That there was no love lost between de Jong and Goedhart is obvious from a letter to de
Fremery, from May 1, where he writes: “the truth will find her way, and the spiritual scalp of
Mr. Goedhart will be hanged in Meentwijck (de Fremery's villa in Bussum) as a trophy.”
(This wish is a little unexpected, since de Jong became Goedhart’s fellow editor in 1934,
when the periodical ‘Grensgebieden’ was founded.)
Be that as it may, other people with doubts didn’t accumulate real evidence. This was done
by de Fremery, Richter and de Bruin on April 16 and at Harris’ seances in the two weeks
before that date.
Back to de Bruin’s article, where he went deeply into the nonsense the medium kept
producing in her ‘messages,’ and everyone who has some experience with bad or
fraudulentus mediums will smile at his examples, which are still the same now, a century
later, as then.
“I felt myself attending a 2 dimes public seance”, de Bruin said. But these seances were f 5.-
p/p. “Didn’t the sitters have a right to get something for their money?”
Mrs Harris seemed a master in extracting ‘useful’ information from the people ‘receiving’ a
wonderful message. She told de Bruin about Miss K.v.H. (her interpreter) who picked her up
from the train, and in the carriage Harris kept asking questions about a woman S. she knew
282
would be attending a seance. Miss K.v. H gave her the information about S. without
suspicion, later to experience how exactly this information was used!
Maybe we remember Richter’s information about Harris planting flowers in her bosom. That
could well be true, for de Bruin mentioned Harris ‘seeing’ a spirit with a rose in her hand,
meant for one of the sitters, and lo and behold, the spirit left the rose for all to see somewhere
in the seance room. How wonderful. Only, the rose turned out to be withered. So useless it
was that the woman for whom the rose ‘materialised’ didn't even pick it up after the seance.
Another trick de Bruin mentioned: Harris told the public at every seance she was suffering
from blood spitting. When blood came from her mouth at the disturbed seance of April 16, it
was, of course, taken seriously. Was she suffering from tuberculosis? Certainly not. And,
writes de Bruin, “she prevented me from removing the blood from her lips, with my
handkerchief.”
De Bruin is very clear in his verdict of Göbel, who selectively placed letters of pro-Harris
spiritists and refused the ones written by people anti- Harris and pro- de Fremery. This goes,
he says, for the letter of de Bruin, but also for a lengthy letter of Mr. Richter, the man
grabbing the trumpets, who didn’t get space in HTL to explain himself either. (see Göbel's
explanation below)
De Bruin defended de Fremery, whom he deeply admired for his calm, and his merits for
spiritism, and it was very clear that he heartily disliked Goedhart, whom he saw as the main
incentive for the escalation.
He wrote: “I have seen your natural bent to stir up quarrels, like you showed then and there
on the Harmonia board. It would be good for you to stop doing that. You still think you're
standing before a classroom, but you are fighting thinking people, with far more experience
than you have.” And at the end of his lengthy article he encouraged Goedhart to leave
Harmonia, because ‘only then peace will return’. “You succeeded in driving Göbel and de
Fremery apart”, he writes, “leave before you damage even more.” It must have been clear to
de Bruin that this would be the last thing to happen. Harmonia was stuck with Goedhart for
exactly another 20 years, and more damage was indeed done.
Harris, the treacherous medium went
away, and even an amount offered her of f
500.- could not keep her in Holland..
Then, in the May 15 issue of HTL, there
was a very short note by de Fremery ◄:
“Serious difference of opinion with Mr
J.S. Göbel has given me cause to leave
the editorship of Het Toekomstig Leven.
Thanking my readers for the many
signs of sympathy which I received in
the twelve years I have been part of this
magazine, I can give them my assurance
that my spiritist conviction, despite disappointments, is still there, as is my interest in
investigations that is of vital importance for our worldview and philosophy of life.”
283
That’s all. In comparison to all the other lengthy articles very easy to miss. De Fremery
himself wanted it that way, Göbel explained in the issue of July 1.
Still Göbel saw reason to give lots of space to sentimental journeys of, among others, the
‘nurse’ who took care of ‘poor Mrs Harris’ after her ‘terrible experience’ in Amsterdam, and
another who specifically mentions how she kept saying ‘I feel so lonely’, which was plenty of
reason to pity the mistreated medium and villifying de Fremery in the course of their
writings. One may ask if these people were aware of what really transpired that evening, or if
they were floating on the tide that was drowning the voice of reason more with every page in
HTL.
It’s impossible in the space of a single article to go over every letter in the subsequent issues
of HTL. But in the issue of June 1, there was a lenghty article by de Fremery, who had been
contemplating his reactions to all the false accusations over a few weeks, and also licking his
wounds, I imagine.
It is the last time we will hear from him in HTL or in any spiritist periodical for a long time.
In this article he evaluated with characteristic honesty his own part in what happened. He
started with stating that the many writings of his co-spiritists in favour of Mrs Harris made
him think deeply, and even doubt his own conclusions. Could he possibly have been wrong
after all? But, he wrote, “my conviction, in which I seem to stand alone – there’s not one co-
spiritist who stood beside me - is still unchanged. I have reason to regret that the final section
of my article in the Harris issue of HTL, through a misunderstanding was never published. It
should have been: “To ban her (Harris) from our midst is a duty. Her false play should be
proclaimed, she, who has the nerve to bring up people like William Stead, William Booth and
others, hoping to make the impression needed to be believed.”
De Fremery then explained why he sent his article to Het Vaderland and Het Leven; these
two newspapers had already published about Harris. He also wanted make sure that the
negative publicity came from the side of the spiritists themselves, and not from people
outside the movement.
Then de Fremery knelt down, and reflected honestly on a better way of action he could have
taken. Although he spoke about his misgivings with Göbel before the seance of April 16, he
asked Göbel to keep it between them.
“That was wrong”, he writes, “I should have gone to The Hague to talk openly with him and
with the ‘Vereeniging voor Psychisch Onderzoek’ (meaning: Goedhart). I should have told
them my misgivings and ask them to do the same as I did: listen to Mrs Harris breathing.
That should have been comradship between co-spiritists and in the interest of spiritist
investigation. My own position would have been stronger, and I would have more people on
my side than I had now; certainly every one who would have done what I did.”
Then he names the two people with the same experiences: G. J. de Bruin in Amsterdam, and
W.G. Grottendieck in The Hague. We were not yet introduced to Mr Grottendieck, but this
gentleman wrote to de Fremery on May 6, affirming de Fremery’s later observation that
Harris only used one trumpet and only her own voice. Grottendieck had been involved in
investigations of the British SPR, wrote de Fremery.
284
After having fought a losing battle with Goedhart’s accusations and saying that he is “unable
to equal his (Goedhart’s) tone, and in this respect happy to declare myself his inferior” de
Fremery stressed again that only the gentlemen de Bruin, Grottendieck and himself were
qualified to judge, since only the three of them were mindful of checking Mrs Harris
thoroughly during the seance. “All others who were not there and didn’t do any checking may
have heard what transpired from others, they know what is written, but they don’t know from
direct experience. Which in this case makes a colossal difference.”
How right he was. The rest of this long article was written in a style we never before saw in
de Fremery’s writings. He could be a bit ironic, occasionally almost sharp, but, as a man in
perfect command of the Dutch language, never purposefully hurtful. We all know how the
way words are arranged can contain inherent meaning for who reads well. This letter, the last
thing he would write for the readers of HTL, showed that he could be hurtful if he chose. And
at this moment in time de Fremery has nothing to lose, since he had lost everything already.
His venom was directed at Goedhart, which was no surpise. His sarcasm is painful to read,
because we can imagine the hurt lurking behind his words. I wish I could translate the whole
long article but that is impossible.
His conclusion was adamant: “I didn’t find deception because I expected to find any; I
found it because it was there.”
It’s predictable that an answer to this outburst from de Fremery came very soon. First an
article from R.O. v Holten tot Echten, loyal to Goedhart and made from the same mold. He
tried to impress his readers by giving examples from history of all kinds of mediums and the
deceit some saw in their actions, which has nothing to do whatever with the case in question.
But R.O. van Holten tot Echten rambled happily on, ending his piece of muddy thinking with
a renewed accusation of de Fremery, that the writings of de Fremery’s ‘superiors’ (meaning
Goedhart, van Straaten and himself, I imagine) should have been “reason enough to retract
his verdict, since, in doubt, the medium is cleared till real evidence presents itself.”
And then came Goedhart. Seldom a name (good heart) was so misplaced. His letter was again
of the kind that makes the reader sick. Who would have thought otherwise: he used de
Fremery's doubt, his honorably admittance that he could have handled this unfortunate affair
differently by openly talking it through with Göbel and Goedhart before informing the press,
as a means to slap him in the face, again. Goedhart has no problem with interpreting things his
way. His vicious and vocal animosity jumps out of every abusing sentence, and also de Bruin
is insulted, again. It must have been a golden episode for Goedhart.
By now we all know that the medium Harris did succeed in one
thing: to bring out all the underlying conflicts in a very
revealing way, dividing Harmonia and the spiritist community
for years to come.
But the end was not yet there. Next thing was a lengthy article:
‘Mrs Harris Mediumship, Pro and Contra’, by G.P.H.Zahn
(1861-1926), ◄ antiquarian, publisher and magnetiser, who
analyses a number of the arguments given. Based on his own
evaluation of what transpired he came to the conclusion that
285
there is ‘no absolute certainty that Harris was cheating, but also no definitive proof that she
wasn’t’.
He was quite critical about several writers and their flawed logic. Zahn concluded that he was
sure de Fremery had the interest of the spiritist movement at heart, and for him this prevailed
above the interest of medium Harris. But, said Zahn, he could have been more careful and less
rash in his conclusions.
Then Zahn attacked the ridiculous letter of G.A.W. van Straaten, and breaking a lance for de
Fremery’s tireless work for spiritism and his 12 year long succesful editorship of HTL, he
voiced his regret that van Straaten saw cause to hurt de Fremery as deeply as he could, in the
guise of ‘loving advice’ that was not asked for. And he adds: “loving advice can only come
from a loving heart, and someone with love in his heart is unable to write as van Straaten
did.”
Then, at last, came the so much wished for support for de Fremery, from the pen of
Harmonia’s Chairman C. Monod de Froideville. Here we had the voice of reason from inside
Harmonia. De Froideville was very angry. He asked his readers to remember the many good
things de Fremery did over the years, and was indignant that many queued up to criticise and
humiliate de Fremery in every possible way, and almost no one voiced another opinion.
“What has happened to the fraternity of Harmonia”, he wondered. “Disharmonia would be a
better word”. Like Zahn he attacked G.A.W. van Straaten, saying that the so-called
‘brotherhand’ given to de Fremery was in reality one to slap him. Then he adressed van
Straaten: “I was planning to give you on paper a merciless beating.” And he did.
Then he pointed the finger to Goedhart and his Vereeniging voor Psychisch Oonderzoek: “I
really would like to know”, he writes, “what exactly you have done to avoid all this, by, with
‘scientific’ means, testing the medium, and making sure no cheating could possibly happen?”
De Froideville then ended his emotional letter with his regret that de Fremery was no longer
an editor of HTL, and he thanked him for everything he has learned through the many articles
from de Fremery’s hand.
Strangely enough Göbel saw reason to react critically to the things de Froideville wrote, by
disputing de Frioideville’s chronology, but avoiding going into the main contents of de
Froideville’s letter, though he stressed again the inpartiality of himself as an editor.
Why Göbel was so keen to comment on one of the very few letters written by someone with a
positive view on de Fremery, while he never once commented on the mud throwing by
Goedhart, van Straaten and many others, is food for thought. Especially because it happened
again in two subsequent letters from P.L. Thierens and J.C. Heijer, both defending de
Fremery and angrily attacking van Straaten (Heijer), who ended with: “Mr. de Fremery’s
leaving the spiritist movement would mean a disaster for the healthy scientific investigation of
spiritism in our country.”
Göbel obviously was very anxious to defend his own actions in the affair. He must have felt
he had a lot of explaining to do. More surprising even were several notes of Göbel in the
Thierens article. One of which stated that ‘good readers of HTL will know that Goedhart has
been fighting de Fremery’s outlook on spiritism for three years already, but not de Fremery
as a person.’ Which is remarkable, since Goedhart was incapable of making such distinctions,
as ‘every good reader’ would have noticed.
286
In a second note in the same Thierens letter, Göbel broke a lance for Goedhart and van
Straaten, who both were ‘honest, clear and fair’ in their objections.’ Göbel's judgement of
what is ‘honest and fair’ underwent a strange twist over the weeks.
Reading through it all it is amazing how keen people were to ‘teach others a lesson,’ one way
or another, sometimes most likely grabbing their chance to vent their longstanding grudges.
This seems the case with C.J. v. H. t.E.- K.v.H., the wife of van Holthe tot Echten, who
attacked Dr. de Jong, finding fault with him and his disturbance of the seance of April 2.
Sanctimoniously she ended her letter with “The battle we are fighting within our movement is
more painful than the battle against dogma and materialism. The ethical, etherical, lofty
[word missing in original] that should characterize the influence of the unseen world, will
give way more and more as a result of people wallowing ever more deeply in the mud of their
invented accusations.” Invented?
The last contributions in the issue of June 1 came from the wife of Göbel, A. Göbel–
Nierstrasz.
She started with a quote from the Bible, ‘Do Not Judge’ (Joh 7:24) which brings us in the
right mood for everything else she has to say, mainly by lamenting the poor medium again.
“Do the gentlemen not feel that they have slandered the name of a woman, a stranger, being
here without support, without friends? They not only hurt her badly physically, but even more
spiritually.” This rhetoric went on and on, Mrs Göbel was a sentimental woman and her
reasoning was questionable. The rest of her letter was devoted to ruminating many arguments
others have been ruminating already.
The issue of June 15 was almost like normal, filled with articles
about non-Harris subjects. Except a letter from Marcellus Emants
(1848-1923), ◄ a well know writer in those days (still in print),
and very much interested in spiritism. Emants started with
supporting de Fremery. Then he reported his own experiences with
Harris, more or less in the vein of de Bruin’s article on the Harris
affair: the totally meaningless messages, often to the wrong people.
He added his own experience: the medium came up with ‘you have
something to do with Paladino’. Not surprisingly, because Emants
had discussed Eusapia Paladino loudly with a lady, before the
seance started, doors open.
He also related that he asked a question, upon which the ‘control’
threw down the trumpet, indignantly stating that Emants was forbidden to ask questions,
because that meant he was distrustful.
Who wouldn’t be?
His conclusion: “Although I would be happy to accept the truth of the spirit hypothesis,
seances like the one mentioned here are of no value at all. At the seance I had with Eusapia
Paladino (in 1903), the thought of cheating never came up, but at the seance with Mrs Harris
I was unable to put this thought out of my head for a single moment.”
287
Of course Göbel had a comment on Emants’ letter, and apart from other explanations he finds
fault with Emants’ mistrust, which is, Göbel says, “not the means to form an objective
opinion”. Would Göbel really have done otherwise, in the light of Emants’ experience?
The very last mention of the Harris Affair was in the issue of July 1, by Göbel. He finally
referred to the letters of the two people who had an important part in the proceedings of April
16: de Bruin and Richter. Their comments are, as said earlier, absent from the relevant issues
of HTL.
Göbel explained: he had offered both gentlemen the space of 2 columns. Richter refused, but
wanted his lengthy piece in ‘de Telegraaf’ to be copied in HTL, and also another article he
wrote on the matter, which proposal was turned down by Göbel, who “saw no proof of
deception in both articles” (One may ask where the proof to the contrary is in all the
attacking articles he did place!)
The article de Bruin wrote was turned down by Göbel, since “not half a column of the 9
columns was about his own views on the matter, and the rest is about other people and things
not relevant to the case.”
(Having read de Bruin’s article this is a weird way to look at it. It’s possibly one of the most
relevant articles written in the Harris Affair, more so because de Bruin was there, and most
other people were not.)
After being turned down by Göbel both gentlemen turned to de Fremery for advice, who
wrote Göbel that he suggested to them to publish their stories as a brochure, and send it to all
subscribers of HTL.
At this Göbel saw his authority threatened. He more or less forbade de Fremery to use the
addresses of HTL for this purpose, and de Fremery answered that he could send post to
whoever he pleased. This correspondence was part of Göbel's evaluation on the first page of
the issue of July 1. He warned his readers about what was to come, and ended with his
assumption that the readers of HTL will make up their own minds if he was right in refusing
both gentlemen space in HTL.
In the end, as far as I know, only the brochure of de Bruin was distributed, written by him
only. What became of Richter’s plans I don’t know.
What happened after 1914?
The HTL issue of July 1 was the last one in which de Fremery was mentioned. After that:
silence, as if he never existed. It must have been disheartening for a man who served and
spread his spiritist conviction for many years, to have it all taken away from him by his own
friends and fellow spiritists. Accomplishments are soon forgotten but grudges do not easily
die. Many, many years later Goedhart and his comrades brought the Harris affair back to
memory, but without naming de Fremery explicitly. His ‘misdeed’ was used as an example of
the consequences of rash judgement, something Goedhart, of course, had never been guilty of.
J.S. Göbel died on January 1 of 1916, only two days before his 69th birthday. He was
seriously ill for some time and knew he was going to die. There had been an extensive private
correspondence between Göbel and de Fremery around the Harris Affair, some of it being in
288
the archive of Utrecht. But both gentlemen, no longer in contact after the unlucky escalation
in 1914, were reconciled shortly before Göbel’s death.
De Fremery wrote a sympathetic In Memoriam in the January 15 issue of 1916. He said:
“During the 12 years in which I had the honor to work with him, I had ample opportunity to
know and appreciate him, and although our paths didn't go parallel till the end, the sympathy
we had for each other was still there. Across our differences of opinion we reconciled shortly
before his demise: there is far more that connects us than what divides us.” And after having
praised Göbel’s many accomplishments and character he finishes with: “Thankful for what he
did for spiritism, our appreciative thoughts and feelings of sympathy go up to him. God be
with him!”
As for J. Goedhart, too much is already said about him. He died suddenly in his sleep, in
1935, at the age of 75.
As already mentioned, his relationship with
Harmonia and HTL, a periodical that never
recovered from the loss of de Fremery and the
death of Göbel in 1916, came to an end in 1934.
What transpired we don’t know, but things were
never easy around Goedhart. In 1934 he started
his own magazine ‘Grensgebieden”' ◄, under
the pretence of being 'scientific', which, judging
from the contents of the articles, it never was.
One scientist though did contribute: classicist
Dr. K.H.E. de Jong. Of the other editors Mr. S.
de Laat de Kanter, a jurist, was equal to
Goedhart in attacking science, preferably
parapsychology, in his lengthy articles.
Goedhart was missed by his pals, and his
obituary in ‘Grensgebieden’ praised him into
heaven for his merits for spiritism, his honesty
and his wonderful personality. The past tells us
differently. About the dead nothing but good?
There is no evidence in my possession to suggest Grensgebieden did survive its third year.
Reverend Susanna Harris seems to have survived quite well her ‘terrible illness’ as a
consequence of her being accused of fraud.
As said before, she was again very much controversial in 1920, when she was tested by the
SPR in Norway in 25 sittings and accused of fraud, again. She died in 1932. I have no direct
information on her years between 1914 and 1932, but since Nandor Fodor in his
Encyclopaedia only devotes a very short entry to her, it’s probably a sign she wasn’t the great
medium people wanted her to be in 1914.6

H. N. de Fremery went to greener pastures on
November 16, 1940, at the age of 72. His friend
Prof. Dr. Willem Tenhaeff wrote a sympathetic
and informative obituary in het Tijdschrift voor
Parapsychologie of that year. He reminisced
about de Fremery’s merits for the development
of parapsychology in Holland. When in 1920 the
Dutch SPR was founded, de Fremery was one of
the board members. A few times he wrote
articles for het TvP (Tijdschrift voor
Parapsychologie) . Tenhaeff mentioned his own
regret that de Fremery after 1920 never again
became the leading figure in parapsychology he
could have been, and never came to writing
down his rich experiences during his active years
as editor of HTL, during which time he met a
multitude of interesting people, although
Tenhaeff urged him many times to do so.
Probably de Fremery's memories culminating in
the Harris Affair of 1914 were still too painful to
force himself to this task.
Tenhaeff ended his obituary by stating that, although de Fremery never again wished to take a
leading role, his interest in parapsychology in relation to spiritism never waned.
“This may not withhold us from remembering him as a man who worked for many years at
the front of parapsychological research and in that capacity suffered under much bias, from
his fellow spiritists of whom many couldn't appreciate his parapsychological view on the
spiritist question, as well as from others who a priori rejected spiritism because it didn't fit
their world view. His memory will always be honored in our midst.” Here is the
announcement of the cremation of de Fremery in Het Vaderland of 11/21 1940.▲
Personal evaluation
This article is written from my own perspective on this short period in history. I don’t pretend
not to be biased myself. It is almost impossible to read HTL over a number of years, and not
to get a fair impression of the characters in the leading roles of those days. The gap of a
century seems to disappear and one feels as if one knows these people in person.
To me, however, it is obvious that the escalation of this whole unfortunate affair was far more
determined by outspoken characters with long existing grudges and power issues than by the
accounts of seances with Mrs Harris. Noteworthy is a test seance in 1918 whose report was signed by Felicia
Scatcherd, Dr Abraham Wallace and Estelle Stead among others. The report had appeared in LIGHT February 2
1918. It is possible also that Mrs Harris was the medium in the Crookes seances featured in Psypioneer February
2014, which were attended by Miss Scatcherd. In LIGHT for 1913-14, are a number of interesting accounts of
evidence produced by Mrs Harris; among those testifying were Dr Crawford and Admiral Moore. A letter from
Mr De Fremery was published, but the weight of opinion supported the medium, though it was conceded that her
work was uneven. We hope to publish some of this discussion later.
290
importance of the facts. After all, how many well known mediums have been exposed, rightly
or wrongly since 1848 without bringing down the people who did it?
Holland is a small country. Inside the spiritist movement people knew each other, and
choosing sides, preferably the side that is obviously on the winning hand, is human nature.
Had it been otherwise, probably other people had come forward, suddenly remembering
something ‘suspicious’ in their seances with the medium Harris.
We can’t change history. Maybe de Fremery can smile, up there somewhere, in the
knowledge that after a century the man he was is not forgotten. Which is quite an
accomplishment for any human being.

Introductory note: Below is taken from LIGHT, August 14th 1931 page 386, written by
the journal’s former editor David Gow who by this time was advisory editor, under George
Lethem:
“LIGHT” DURING THE WAR—
AND AFTER
By DAVID GOW
LIGHT was born into a world teeming with activities in which I think religion and politics
were most conspicuous, science and philosophy taking very minor places.
Some of the leading figures in the movement so far as LIGHT was concerned were
active forces in either religion or politics, or both. Mr. Rogers, for example, was a political
journalist, the Rev. John Page Hopps (who for some years wrote the editorials in LIGHT)
was a political speaker as well as a leading figure in Nonconformist circles. Psychical
Research included some notable figures in politics—Lord Balfour amongst them.
But all the political and social activities of those days were moving on, as under a
remorseless pressure, to the Great War. A study of LIGHT of pre-war years will show that
the portents and omens of the coming world-calamity were seen by the clearer-minded
amongst its contributors—those who could see below the surface of things. They were
sensitive to the signs of the times—they felt the coming of some great catastrophe which
would arrive as a Nemesis to the social injustice and the political un-wisdom of the
civilised world and its rulers. But they hoped and prayed that the disaster would be in some
way averted.
BITTER YEARS
It was not to be. In August 1914, the first year of my editorship, the blow fell. Things
went from bad to worse, and only the most optimistic of us expected individually to survive
the great ordeal. “Goods and services” became scarcer and scarcer as the war took its
terrific toll of men and materials. LIGHT shrank in size to a bare eight pages, and even
those were produced at an exorbitant cost, for “newsprint” – the paper on which
newspapers are printed – became scarce and costly. Had the war continued much longer
LIGHT might have appeared, if it were published at all, on a single sheet. All our supply of
“blocks” of photographs and other illustrations, in the hands of the printers, was
commandeered by the Government for munitions of war, for copper and zinc were very
scarce, and printing works generally were laid under toll.
Those bitter years from 1914 to 1918 are like a nightmare to look back upon. But
LIGHT survived it all into a time when, after the great purging, Spiritualism came more to
the front than ever it had done before. Whole-sale bereavement had its part in the change,
but only a part. There had been a great national chastening of soul. People had suffered in
mind, body and estate, and the old political shibboleths and theological fallacies had lost
their power.
292
During the war and after it, LIGHT gained many readers and contributors who but for
the experience of the war would never have thought about the subject at all. We gained new
adherents from the Church, from Medicine, from the Press and from the Stage. I met many
of them, during the early stages of their inquiry into the evidences for survival. Some of
them were people of distinction in their various callings.
I found it necessary, as Editor, to make certain changes in the tone and material of
LIGHT. The old dry academics of earlier days had to be greatly modified. Some of the
things with which the thoughtful reader was concerned in the earlier years had lost their
importance. But I had to resist the demand from many quarters that LIGHT should be made
purely popular and propagandist, that it should appeal to the emotions of the reader rather
than to his intelligence. It needed no little resolution to follow the lines originally laid
down, even with some needed modifications.
It was plain that Spiritualism, while it had strong religious implications, was not all a
matter of religion. Science, in fact, was beginning to eclipse the old religious outlook, and
at one time seemed in a fair way of setting up an orthodoxy of its own. Indeed, it was one
of the most striking phenomena of the post-war years that the general reader was taking a
keen interest in Science. The writings and speeches of Lodge, Einstein, Eddington and
jeans were conspicuous items in the press. The man in the street became aware, sometimes
with surprise, that Science was becoming less materialistic in its outlook; indeed that such
revolutionary changes were going on that it seemed as if Science and Religion were making
up their ancient quarrel.
Even before the war there were signs of this coming reconciliation, and many notes and
articles in LIGHT in those days took account of them. To me these great changes in
Religion, Science and Philosophy are amongst the vital things noted and recorded in our
pages. Beside them the many items dealing with séance phenomena, doctrinal differences
in psychical science and philosophy, speculative theories and personalia, however much in
the picture, are apt to look rather small.
Some of the earlier writers in LIGHT looked for and worked towards a synthesis of
Religion and Science, based upon psychical evidences, and their views have been taken up
and continued ever since. They found perhaps their most conspicuous expression in the
lectures and writings of Dr. Ellis Powell, a man of brilliant mind, journalist, lawyer,
scientist and Spiritualist. He was a member of the London Spiritualist Alliance, and a
frequent and valued contributor to our pages. It was plain to him, as to others who made a
study of Spiritualism on its philosophical side, that the message of Spiritualism was not all
expressed in the idea of human survival, infinitely comforting as it is, alike to those who
mourn loved ones who have passed from mortal life and those who view their own
inevitable fate with doubt or dismay.
RELIGION V. SCIENCE
The proof of a spiritual world not only makes the Universe more intelligible, throwing
light on the meaning of mortal life, but also in the form of Spiritualism and Psychic Science
it holds the seeds of the Religion and Science of the future. At present they are so
intermixed that it is hardly surprising if there is some conflict as to whether Spiritualism is
Religion or Science. To LIGHT and its conductors it presents itself as both, at present
293
interfused but later to be separately developed as a dual-unity, supplying a great
interpretation of the mysteries of life and death.
I believe that from the beginning these ideas were present in the minds of those who
founded LIGHT, and those who have conducted the journal since their day. Certainly this
line of reasoning has been expounded many times in our -
pages. For LIGHT has never
limited itself to the presentation of Spiritualism in its narrow and popular sense. It has taken
the larger view and given due weight to the religious, scientific and philosophical values.
These have been conspicuously set forth by such writers as Mr. C. C. Massey, a man of
outstanding intellectual quality, “Quaestor Vitae” (Mr. Oswald Murray) and Sir William
Barrett, as well as by Dr. Ellis Powell and “M.A. Oxon,” not to mention Sir Oliver Lodge
himself.
It was no easy task which fell to the conductors of the journal to deal adequately and
faithfully with a subject so many-sided in its issues, ranging as they did from psychic
faculty and séance phenomena to matters of cosmic importance. The greatest human mind
could not have coped with such a problem without a fault or failure, but I am certain that all
of us who attempted the task could plead that whatever our imperfections we did our best.

DAVID GOW
Poet and Journalist
David Gow took over the editorship of
LIGHT on the death of Edward Wallis in
January 1914, taking the journal through the
Great War years and continued as editor
until April 1931. He then took up the
position as advisory editor, under George
Henderson Lethem, who took over on April
20th, Gow continued for 18 months as
advisory editor, before retiring due to poor
health. He died on Thursday November 2nd,
1939 age 73. His funeral took place at
Golders Green Crematorium on the
following Monday, and was conducted by
Mrs. Barbara Hewat McKenzie of the
British College of Psychic Science.
Previously in the October 1927 issue of
their quarterly journal, its editor Stanley De
Brath, made reference to David Gow:

EDITORIAL NOTES
THE portrait of Mr. David Gow,7
which is the frontispiece to the present
issue,8
will be welcome to many as presenting the photograph of an
indefatigable worker for Spiritualism whose levelheadedness has steered the
movement through many mazes. He took over the editorship of Light in
January, 1914, on the decease of E. W. Wallis, having previously for some
years written the editorials and notes which had before then been supplied by
the Rev. John Page Hopps.
The editorial succession was Stainton Moses (M.A., Oxon); Edmund
Dawson Rogers; E. W. Wallis; and David Gow; but there were brief intervals
when the paper was run by J. S. Farmer and Richard Harte.9
Mr. Gow’s
experience in journalism is a long one, and he was a contemporary of R. L.
Stevenson, Alfred Harmsworth, Richard Le Gallienne, and others who later
became famous. Indeed, all his Press life has been marked by acquaintance or
friendship with famous men and women. He wrote for the provincial Press, for
trade journals, for such papers as “Cassell’s Saturday Journal,” and the
“London Magazine,” a Glasgow paper, and the “London Scotsman.”
In poetry, he is included in anthologies of Scottish writers. He gained most
of his literary education from Scottish sources, under the tutorship of William
Sharp (“Fiona Macleod”) and Professor Robertson, but refers his journalistic
training mostly to E. D. Rogers. He says, “I am nowadays regarded as very
English—except to myself—and the Scottish interests are mainly sentimental
and ancestral, though I am not permitted to forget them, for ancestral Gows
come through occasionally at circles, even when I am not present, to greet me
and to send greeting messages through others that I may not forget the pit from
which I was digged.”
His spiritualistic reminiscences would fill a large book. He knew nearly all
the leading folk right back to the days of Garth Wilkinson, Mrs. Guppy, and
Emma H. Britten, John Lamont, James Robertson, and many other worthies and
pioneers. While editing Light Mr. Gow at one time wrote regularly for a
London paper, and we can agree cordially to his last remark—“Variety is the
spice of life, and it is very essential in Spiritualism, where over-devotion to the
one thing breeds cranks and fanatics.”

On Gow’s resignation, the Spiritualists’ National Union President John B. McIndoe
wrote this tribute to his work, published in their first official journal “The National
Spiritualist,” May 1931 edited by George Berry:
David Gow
What Spiritualism owes to David Gow cannot be expressed in precise terms, it
can be appreciated fully only by those who have been in close contact with him
during his 20 years’ association with Light.
He commenced as a contributor under Mr. Dawson Rogers, and soon became
leader writer. Since 1914 he has been editor. These 17 years include some
anxious and trying times, when faith and courage, wide experience and clear
vision were essential qualities. These he possesses to a peculiar degree, they
have gained for him a wide circle of admirers, while his genial unassuming nature
has endeared him to a host of friends.
In his contributions to Light his leading articles have been instructive,
broadminded and indicative of wide reading and, varied knowledge of men and
affairs, his criticisms have been sane, just, shrewd, but kindly; his advice
invaluable to many an enquirer, while his humorous “Rays and Reflections” have
aroused many a smile.
There is scarcely a phase of journalism in which he has not played his part, he
has been reporter, leader writer, sub-editor, and editor of several journals. He has
written on politics, finance, religion and a host of other topics. He has written
humorous stories and concocted comic sketches and jests. He was a regular
contributor to Judy; Moonshine and other comics of a past generation.
Archaeology and literature have interested him, while his output of poetry has
been considerable. A recent volume, “Four Miles from Anywhere,” has been well
received.
He has made few appearances on the platform as a public speaker. A notable
instance occurred some 10 years ago in connection with the Lambeth Conference,
when he addressed a gathering of Bishops on Spiritualism. His wide knowledge
and experience of every phase of the subject eminently fitted him for the task.
Light and its editor have been held in high esteem in Fleet Street. They have
been a valued source of information and help on all psychic topics, and Mr.
Gow’s personal influence has had a large share in bringing about the marked
change in the attitude of the Press which has occurred during recent years.
Such is the man who has asked to be relieved of the main burden of his
editorial duties. He is being retained as Advisory Editor, and will still instruct us
in leading articles and amuse us in “Rays and Reflections.” May he be long
spared to do so, and to enjoy a. well-earned leisure.
He has met most of the great mediums and the outstanding figures in
Spiritualism and psychic research of recent years. His reminiscences would make
296
interesting reading and be valuable to the future student and historian. Will he do
us this further service by arranging for their early appearance.

Two visitors to Col.
Olcott – a note
In his “Old Diary Leaves” vol. 1 Henry
Olcott recalls of Madame Blavatsky and
himself (p.395ff.)
“Our two hearts drew us towards the
Orient, our dreams were of India, our
chief desire to get into relations with the
Asiatic people. No way, however, had yet
opened on the physical plane, and our
chance of getting out to our Holy Land
seemed very slight, until one evening in
the year 1877 an American traveller, who
had recently been in India, called. He
happened to sit so that, in looking that
way I noticed on the wall above him the
framed photograph of the two Hindû
gentlemen with whom I had made the Atlantic passage in 1870. I took it down,
showed it to him, and asked if he knew either of the two. He did know Moolji
Thackersey and had quite recently met him in Bombay. I got the address, and by the
next mail wrote to Moolji about our Society, our love for India and what caused it. In
due course he replied in quite enthusiastic terms, accepted the offered diploma of
membership, and told me about a great Hindû pandit and reformer, who had begun a
powerful movement for the resuscitation of pure Vedic religion. At the same time he
introduced to my notice, in complimentary terms, one Hurrychund Chintamon,
President of the Bombay Arya Samaj, with whom I chiefly corresponded thereafter;
and whose evil treatment of us on arrival at Bombay is a matter of history.”
There have been doubts about Olcott meeting Indians in 1870, but Paul Johnson recently
informed me.
“Hurrychund Chintamon was the second Indian entered in the Adyar Membership
records now available online from The Art Archive. The first, Toolsidas Jadarjee,
#120 in the entries, precedes #123 Chintamon and has been considerably more
elusive. TS founder Herbert Monachesi gave his name as Tulsidas Jadarjee in an
October 6, 1875 New York Mercury article “Proselyters from India,” claiming that
Thackersey and his travel companion had been on a Hindu missionary journey to the
West, but no evidence had ever appeared in support of this claim.
The November 20, 1869 Louisville Daily Express described the two men on a
business journey that had brought them to Chicago, where they were as of the date of
the story. It reported that they were heading to St. Louis, New Orleans, and Boston.
The mission was clearly a business trip involving their interest in the cotton trade,
which took them to Mobile, Charleston, and Savannah in addition to the above-
named destinations. The Galveston Daily News of November 21 reprinted a story
from the New York Tribune of November 12: “[it is] to open the way for future
direct commerce, that the gentlemen have visited out shores...During their stay in the
Colonel Henry Steel Olcott
298
Fifth Avenue Hotel they have visited at least fifty of our leading merchants to whom
they had letters, and they created much astonishment by their easy manners, and
perfection of English. Both are clothed in European style, with the exception of
handsome Turkish caps.” The New Orleans Daily Picayune ran a first page story on
December 3, noting that they “have been in our city for several days...are to leave to-
day on a tour through the Atlantic States, via Mobile, Montgomery, and Savannah.
The object of their visit is to establish if possible direct trade with this country in the
matter of bagging, etc., and to see the cotton fields of the South.” The Macon Weekly
Telegraph of December 24 noted that they were in Mobile “for the purpose, the
Register says, of obtaining a closer insight into the cotton business as transacted in
this country.” The Charleston Courier of December 26 featured their visit on page 1
as “Distinguished visitors from Afar,” reporting that they had arrived from Savannah
and that “Thackersey is a Barrian or merchant of caste, Jadarjee is a Brahmin of the
priestly caste...he has lost caste, and on his return to his native country will be an
outcast from among the Brahmins. But as he is wealthy he will care little about
this...Our reporter...found them very pleasant in conversation and very
communicative. They speak our language very correctly and very intelligently. Both
are engaged in the purchase and sale of cotton in Bombay, and are on a tour of
inspection through the cotton growing states.” They were noted as “Our Hindoo
Visitors” in the Philadelphia Evening Telegraph of 6 Jan 1870.
The New York Times for January 13, 1870 included the names “Moolja Thackersy,
Toolsidas Jadarzee,” and “Colonel. Hy. S. Olcott” has having departed the previous
day on the steamship Java, bound from New York to Liverpool.”
This last sentence of course confirms Col. Olcott’s memory of having previously met
Thackersey. These 19th
century shipping records are indeed of great value to historians!
