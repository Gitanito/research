you
my name is Don Phillips and I live in
Los Angeles California and it was born
in Los Angeles California and I have
worked with government-sponsored
agencies as well as spent my appropriate
time in the military and as a civilian
but also as a military person I did have
experiences with what we would refer to
as unidentified flying objects
timeframe about 19 or 20 I started to
work for a entered college after high
school but I also went to work for
Lockheed Aircraft Corporation and after
a year of unemployment and the regular
field of aircraft construction and
design I was asked if I would like to go
to a new department or one that was
already in gear for a new project and of
course I said yes
not knowing exactly what it was but I
figured that it was in my best interest
and I did have interest in it because I
got a little inkling of it from the
person the upper management that had
told me about this now my studies had to
do with the design engineering
mechanical electrical and aeronautics I
was a pilot a private pilot at that time
and still AM
and at the time 19 and what would it be
1961-62
I started my new job in what is called
the skunk works and I was introduced to
the various divisions of the skunk works
it was purchasing expediting and
engineering my I served in all of those
during the 60s and this went through
1965 our projects were of course a
contract special aircraft flying
aircraft for the government the United
States government and other agencies of
the government of course supplied pilots
and I say this because it&#39;s important to
the defense of the United States and the
free world free world means those that
believe in the opportunities for all
humankind the projects that I worked on
were ongoing and they when I left the
employment of the skunk works to go into
the military I felt that this is
something I wanted to come back to after
serve
serving my country I I think it was 1965
actually when I first went into the
military and discovered that some of the
assignments that I was put on in Las
Vegas or near Las Vegas Nevada
were very much in close proximity to our
areas where we tested our aircraft and a
lot of commonly known as area 51
we call it the dreamland the hog farm
the lake you know this place would flood
once in awhile and it was really
unusable as far as landing and taking
off but that&#39;s beside the point what
what the site that I know it from is
that it is high security and not really
having to spend too much time in the
area I got a lot of feedback from people
from my division at the skunk works too
as to what is happening out there we&#39;re
testing airplanes and everybody knows
that it tested special aircraft such as
the Blackbird I wish I&#39;m very proud of
because that&#39;s my baby and it holds some
of the world&#39;s records to this day now
the but the thing about being in the
military in that area is that they were
radar sites and we were attached to
Nellis Air Force Base no Nellis is a
flight test pilot testing or pilot
training base for the US military but at
the same time it teaches and brings in
pilots from other countries north of Las
Vegas at the way up at the end of the
northeast of the gunnery range there is
what we know is the area 51 but across
across the highway that goes north from
Las Vegas is a site called angel&#39;s peak
angels peak in itself covered the area
51 covered the demonstration teams the
thunderbirds as we know them but it also
covered a lot of other area like the
Atomic Energy Commission test test
grounds to the west and to the north
Angels peak was a was a classified radar
installation and it&#39;s a lot of radar
installations as we know them we&#39;re up
in the middle of nowhere this one had a
nice setting because it was east of
Mount Charleston so we would monitor the
aircraft coming from Las Vegas into area
51 or whatever passed by and it was
whatever past might that became most
interesting one night in 1908 say
1966-67 somewhere in that area we I
stayed on base most of the time and
heard a lot of commotion about one
o&#39;clock in the morning and being that it
was the summertime I thought well you
know it&#39;s it must be very warm we were
at 8,000 feet the radar domes were at
10,500 approximately and I decided to go
ahead get up and they said wow it sure
is loud the sound is count carries a
long ways on these days so I went out
walked up to the main road and up near
my office which has a short distance to
the chow hall and I thought it maybe it
was time for the crews to come down for
dinner but it was another hour when I
got to the area where the fellows were
standing there was a group of about five
people and they were looking up in the
air and I looked up in the air and saw
these objects lighted objects moving at
tremendous speeds it&#39;s like what we
would know as special effects today and
it was in the area slightly to the north
and northwest of Mount Charleston and
Mount Charleston by the way is over I
think just about 13,000 feet so all of a
sudden I says wow what an aerial show I
didn&#39;t think too much of it because it&#39;s
not something that surprised me that
they were doing these kind of acute
maneuvers but right at that instant when
I saw these things making acute angles
and traveling
maybe I would estimate for three to four
thousand miles per hour and then
immediately making a cute turn I knew
that they weren&#39;t ours and I had a
special background with the skunkworks
Lockheed Aircraft advanced development
in engineering that said these are not
ours and having been a pilot I&#39;m
thinking what kind of forces these the
the if there were people in these craft
what kind of forces their bodies are
taking then I I said well these these
have to be guided by some type of
intelligent pilot if you will having and
being a pilot and I thought wow how long
will this go on so it went on apparently
for my point of view for about another
90 seconds and then all of a sudden they
seemed to group from what would be
hundreds of miles in the sky to the east
or to the west and they came into a
circle rotated in a circle and didn&#39;t
disappeared and I thought wow what a
show so the security sergeant happened
to be on duty and we all looked at each
other and says gee this is really
something and he said well we shouldn&#39;t
really say anything about this and just
let things take their course of events
well I had a buddy that was chief radar
operator named Anthony case our and
Anthony was the first one to get off of
the bust after the door opened and I was
standing right up close to the the doors
when they opened up it&#39;s a
military-style bus air force and I
looked at him and Anthony&#39;s a very large
fellow which is a blond flowing hair and
and a jovial spirit and he was as
serious as anybody could possibly be and
he was almost as white as a sheet as
white as his blond is his hair and he
usually get a good tan as well but this
time he was a different and he first
things they took one step down the steps
and he looked at me and he said did you
see those and I said yeah we&#39;ve been
watching him for the some of them been
the fellas have been watching for
last four to five minutes and I&#39;ve seen
him for a little maybe a little more
than 90 seconds he says we saw them on
the radar screen and we documented them
he says they&#39;re not bogeys they&#39;re not
apparitions they are real solid objects
and of course they would have to be in
order to get affixed with radar the kind
of radar we use there and would have to
be a solid object and it&#39;s not that we
tracked them with the radar they were
they would go in and out of the of the
signal and register that way and there
were I think he finally documented that
there were six or to seven because it
happened very quick and it&#39;s very real
so as far as the inhabitants thereof we
don&#39;t know but the fact that they can
perform the maneuvers and travel at the
speeds that we estimated and also as
estimated by the radar operators and
their scopes they estimated around forty
thirty eight to forty two hundred miles
per hour equivalent ground speed I mean
that&#39;s really quick I mean these things
are darting across the sky first they
look like a star and then they move and
in any direction triangle or make any
kind of any kind of a straight line or
just hover there were let&#39;s say five of
us on the ground that&#39;s including myself
and in the on the radar in the radar
towers on duty that night
I at least four plus the officer of the
day and so you know there&#39;s a couple of
handfuls of people now when there&#39;s an
occurrence such as this in the Air Force
most of us had at least secret most of
us had top secret and then there was a
few that had above top secret clearances
myself I dealt with the documents so of
all types and my and for that bit of
Sirte for might that time period in the
service it was a top secret the people
that would record the information all
this is recorded
and it is documented and then it is
signed off and then it is put in the
archives and our division our radar
squadron was part of the 26th Air
Division which was in Phoenix near
Phoenix Arizona so where they go from
there it could be you know the Pentagon
it could be United States Air Force
Headquarters
they were definitely I mean the way I
pictured then we were bigger something
than some of the closest stars much
bigger you know I would say by the size
of a 50-cent piece you know about you
know I don&#39;t know about ten twelve feet
away that&#39;s what it looked like maybe a
little bigger but but like a silver
dollar there we go and moving across the
sky in a manner that did not leave a
trail okay and not that we could
ascertain but they would just come to a
stop and do do a you know a sixty degree
45 degree 10 degree turn after stopping
and it immediately reversed this action
and there isn&#39;t any you know having been
a pilot and a military search and rescue
pilot along with the flying there isn&#39;t
there isn&#39;t any kind of training that
can that we can take that can bring us
into a realm that can withstand that
kind of a speed and then stop and
immediately go back the opposite
direction and accelerate from zero to
you know up to three thousand miles an
hour when I was working with the
skunkworks
we signed an agreement with the National
Security Agency which had the National
Security Council as well as the CIA and
we kept very quiet about things because
they always knew where we were and what
we were doing and I automatically had
that team spirit and we were a big
family there and I was very proud of
that having worked directly for Kelly
Johnson I&#39;ll put it this way I&#39;ll answer
you this way yes there were new projects
being launched all the time and yes
there were new propulsion systems
at that time and you know you understand
that the sr-71 we took some great risks
and I feel it was internal combustion
well nah yeah it was but it was very
advanced and some of the technologies
that we learned I was asked a question
by a fellow businessman several years
ago 1997 do you think that some of your
the technology that you incorporated
into that aircraft came from outside
sources outside the planet Earth and I
said it&#39;s very possible but I said you
have to remember we came up with some
even it we&#39;d still have to make it work
here on planet earth and yes there&#39;s
this good chance but that nevertheless
everything worked quite well and the
propulsion system that you&#39;re asking
about I heard that there were but the
left hand over knew what the right hand
was doing and for good reason again they
didn&#39;t want us asking questions who
wanted to stay focused on the projects
that we were working on I came in at the
tail end of the YouTube project that
still continues their use of that type
of aircraft and went all the way through
the force for models that I had to do
with design and the construction and
eventual flight tests were not the first
military models they we have another Air
Force in this United States that works
on contract and I won&#39;t identify that
name and dr. Greer if you could if you
have to edit this out would you please
do so it&#39;s of the last it&#39;s a
three-letter agency and I feel that they
worked it with contract pilots very good
pilots so our first four models were for
them there were very special models and
then came the sr-71 otherwise known
properly as the Blackbird so the
propulsion systems yes there were new
ones being developed from what I learned
over a period of years
anti-gravitational actually using the
force that is generated by the
actually by the planet Earth is to
rappel off of it there was research
going on with that with as maybe by
consultants to the skunk works we know
we can safely say that yes there were
some captured craft from 1945 47 was it
in Roswell New Mexico and yeah they were
real and yes we really did get some
technology from them and yes we really
did put it to work and we can thank
people in the United States Army to have
the foresight to put these into industry
for the benefit of the you of the people
of the world I know this to be effect we
put it to use but it took us a long time
to figure out what it was and then
figure out how we can use it and then
what to use it for and are those
products useful for Humanity it wasn&#39;t
it wasn&#39;t until the actually later on in
the eighties and nineties this recent
when I found that a company called light
City Technologies it was a technology
Development Corporation of a secret
nature we work with data signals
avionics computer and as I had talked
with you before we were we knew each
other from certain agencies of the
military and contract with the CIA or
other branches of usually called unseen
industry I would say that&#39;s a good term
we can term it black deep black or
hidden and okay
that might be okay for the popular but
having participated in it and we still
do once in a while on contract because
we might get something useful they can
save lives and save money as well for
everybody not just this country the the
the question that there is advanced
advanced we would some people call them
advanced races
well the knowledge that I have of these
technologies coming with the aircraft or
the craft that were captured here I
didn&#39;t see the craft nor did I see the
bodies but I certainly know some of the
people that did and of course they&#39;re
much you know they&#39;re passed on now from
the earthly bodies but there was no
question that there are people or beings
from outside the planet that have lived
here for a long time and it isn&#39;t just
something new that&#39;s been happening in
the last couple of years there&#39;s been
NATO research conducted joint joint
research joint many many different
countries and this it&#39;s been documented
as to who those races are and their
population at that time and this was
back in the early sixties this is what
what precipitated the need for our
aircraft was the result of these reports
coming out from NATO these reports were
started in the late 50s they were
finished in the early 60s and
disseminated to the appropriate leaders
of various countries I think but they
were kept under lock and key if you will
and if they the prominence or the
greater exposure or greater occurrence
of unidentified flying objects became
would you call the objects became more
known and they actually stopped they
would tide they would communicate we
have records from 1954 that were
meetings between our own leaders of this
country as well as a meeting with the
leaders of our country here in
California and the I as I understand it
from the written documentation that we
were asked if we would allow them to be
here and do research
and the statement I have read was that
well how can we stop you you&#39;re so
advanced and I will say by this camera
and this sound that it was President
Eisenhower that had this meeting and it
was on film sort of like what we&#39;re
doing now bringing it up to date they&#39;re
a NATO report gave that there were 12
races and that the final summary they
had to have contacts to go to these
races in order to understand who they
are what they&#39;re doing and what they
could do and they didn&#39;t get into the
contacts but it certainly did verify
that they haven&#39;t been here for just a
few years maybe hundreds maybe thousands
of years and this was written in the
text getting back to the technology that
we might have used the chips lasers the
night vision the what we call
bulletproof vests and and a few others
these were all used these were all
developed the chips what they called a
central processing units were developed
in great strides now why did that happen
why you put a few things together and do
a bit of research you think wow boy we
did benefit and in several talks these
people it wasn&#39;t because they were
necessarily sharing the technology it&#39;s
because we picked it up and put it into
a what&#39;s called the file cabinet and we
ascertain like Oh are these people safe
are these people that have come in out
from outside are they are they hostile
well if they were hostile I my own
knowledge is and and feeling I don&#39;t
know about all of them is that we could
have been with their weaponry as it
might be used it could have destroyed us
a long time ago
or could have done some damage I think
then it was you listed all these devices
you think those came from studying
extraterrestrial devices yes yes some of
no doubt they came from the Roswell
events i I know that that some of the
technologies that came out of the
Roswell incident the technologies
meaning that which came with the
extraterrestrial craft and the reason
they crash as they are there the
guidance mechanism was interrupted by
our by our radar or by our and by some
equipment that we have I mean it&#39;s quite
by accident I think I don&#39;t know about
that part of it but even more validating
for me was that one of our contract
scientists for our private concern light
City Technologies Incorporated he worked
with him he worked with a couple of
those technologies while he was with a
very prominent Intelligence Agency of
the United States government so that
that was good enough for me because this
what I learned from that all right
anything is possible
you need something let&#39;s build it you
know and it isn&#39;t everything has a
physical shape in this dimension or a
tangibility the ideas everything starts
out with an idea it had to start out
with an idea for these visitors to
Planet Earth and maybe they had maybe
they had color coded what we would call
fiber optics today that could bend light
and that could guide light to one data
location to another data location well
guess what we&#39;ve been talking about it
for six years we have that type of
technology now the one person that I&#39;ve
talked to only outside of the military
or the government level that would
otherwise keep this out of the public
view is dr. Greer and the reason for
that is is because he under he makes it
the professional approach which
more inline with the way we were in the
military yes the the lenses there were
some there was some I actually what we
would call the eyeball coverings that
allowed the inhabitants or the people
inside the craft that made the journey
across space allowed them to see in the
minimal light that we know is now
president president during space travel
and we know that from our own astronauts
as well as astronauts of other countries
these lenses magnified light but also
brought in a certain type of clarity and
my reason for mentioning this was that
it was earth doctors and specialists and
interested in what&#39;s beyond all this
beyond the physical world that got them
into the removal of these lenses I think
there&#39;s a lot of this has been well
documented by Colonel Corso yeah I&#39;m
sure you familiar I maybe you know him
you know who was there with him well
there were a lot of people there with
him but I a lot of the things that are
said in the book are documented in the
book by the how for Corso I can verify
it cooperated by the people that I have
worked with and do work with now so I
can say though what I know about it is
is very true the pathway that it took
that&#39;s another story we talk about
hidden hidden technologies why don&#39;t
they are all these hidden things and why
don&#39;t they let people know about it well
they hide it from hide it from the
public well it&#39;s probably good reason
for some of it they don&#39;t you know I
mean the government didn&#39;t understand it
themselves being in the Air Force maybe
we didn&#39;t fully know what it was take
those technologies from Roswell they
took a while to figure out how they
worked
before we knew what to make from it and
then how to get it into industry how can
it benefit the people the guidance
mechanism were nothing there was no yoke
there was no wheel there was a console
very colorful and they used their hands
and by the thought process and by the
way they moved their hands in rhythm
with their thoughts was the guidance for
the aircraft that was one reason why if
they took their attention off of what
they were doing for their craft and put
it on me it might have upset the flight
pattern for their craft
now I it goes beyond goes beyond just
the way that they actually flew the crab
but they what the meaning behind it is
that they were trained to be one and
used their whole being to flow with an
to work with the natural forces of what
we call the universe that&#39;s within the
planets sphere of influence and perhaps
outside this was very clear and later on
after in the in the 80s when we got in
contact with the equipment from the
Roswell incident this is the way they
discovered that perhaps the craft was
being guided very much the same way well
that&#39;s about a 20 year spread or less
than 20 so I this is just a key point
but we also have where I live my
neighborhood I find out that we have
prominent research people that are
working on what we called in the Foxbat
the movie Foxbat where they had the
helmet to you says oh you think in this
language and you think this and you
guide it with your eyes that way and you
fire it with your thought process and
you know fire your armament from the
aircraft that&#39;s very real it wasn&#39;t
perfected to the point that the movie
made it perfected but my gosh
since that time I think they have come
pretty close these are all available
because we have data signals of data
signals we worked on with our technology
company they
in other words the the the technology
has caught up with the thinking process
humanity has the quickest computer built
into them than any man-made computer can
ever approach and that includes the Cray
computer we whatever we can think of by
the way has already been done by Nature
is just up to us to figure out how
nature did it that allows it to work in
harmony with everything else but the
fact of the matter is when we all come
together if we were to sit down to
dinner we would say oh we&#39;re from this
country in this country and that that
city in that city well it isn&#39;t any
different if we&#39;re in Planet Earth
somebody else might come from a
different location long ways away but we
all sit down and share knowledge maybe
perhaps share food this is the way it
really happens the sensationalism that
reporters and newspapers and writers put
forth it doesn&#39;t do the public any good
it feeds the desire for sensationalism
in people we naturally have a curiosity
but it can be fed with fact and truth or
it can be affected with sensationalism
and half truth or no true was at all how
I came to learn of that NATO report the
research report about you know the the
impetus for doing the report in the
first place is because during that time
period late 50s 60s there the the Cold
War was beginning and there were ships
flying craft intruding upon the Russian
space tour shall we say the Communist
space and then there was flying craft
intruding upon our space and what each
was blaming the other and in doing so we
were ready to push buttons and we became
very we came very close to pushing the
buttons that would annihilate perhaps
both sides especially in the war zone or
in that close proximity zone and before
the buttons were pushed there was a a
secondary type of control where we call
it human reason that&#39;s something that
machines can&#39;t do and we thought wait a
minute we&#39;re both having we can think
very quickly this is what I mean about
computers the humans having the quickest
minds and computers faster than the Cray
they assess the situation and said wait
a minute it&#39;s happening to both sides
something is unusual here maybe we
should do some research and then do a
report because we still have the weapons
we can still push the buttons and thus
the report that was the reason for the
report it was because of the
unidentified craft encroaching on one
another&#39;s airspace it turned out it was
a both same era same unidentified craft
and so it leaded some very interesting
information about civilization how it
occurred here on planet earth that the
these races have been present for a long
time and perhaps they&#39;re referred to as
some of the wise ones that we know about
that helped educate and help train
people here having been employed working
for the CIA and being trained as an
observer there was a when you observe
something and you want you follow the
pathway you follow it back to its source
and then you go back further for the
reason then you get to the crux of the
matter why something may have happened
but then we ascertain why it happened
and the I was studying some information
following the pathway on some
information that had to do with NASA
that had to do with extraterrestrial
visitation and how real was it didn&#39;t
matter about the sensationalism of it
that&#39;s how I came to know of the NATO
report but it was also through the
military channels I had to make some
phone calls and I did
and it was very nice to knock the dust
off of those because we can all say Wow
see where it&#39;s progressed since then if
we were willing to talk about it we
again we worked with the Central
Intelligence Agency as contractors are
that was during the time of the skunk
works during the military I had been in
a few different places around the world
particularly with the combat support in
the Vietnam War that the actual work the
closest the close activity was pre
military it was when with the skunk
works you see the CIA was one of our
best customers and the CIA that has one
of the world&#39;s best air forces it&#39;s not
we have Francis Gary Powers so we knew
him Schumacher a lot of these people
you&#39;re very real people and they were
often the moved around by politics and I
think that we all we can learn something
from all of this we don&#39;t necessarily
have to be and what would you call it
open but we don&#39;t have to lie about it
we just perhaps don&#39;t say so something
we got to keep each other honest and
we&#39;ve been doing that for years the
technologies that I know about that were
removed from the craft and I think my
understanding is that they were moved
removed from the craft at Roswell in a
manner that was not known to the guards
or the I call them wild security people
surrounding the area had to be done
rather quietly by specialists and the I
might I&#39;d like to add to that I feel
that I&#39;m not positive but I think it
would some of this technology came from
crafts of other crashes okay not just
there&#39;s a lot made of Roswell and
they&#39;re not even sure where the things
you know
went into the earth yeah near Roswell
but it&#39;s near Roswell I know that and I
won&#39;t I wouldn&#39;t say we&#39;re the other
areas are but it happened to be in the
area of New Mexico I do know that there
was let me say this that as far as the
validation of these what we call these
little little beans the little beans the
engineer that did some work for the
military was asked to be I&#39;d like to do
a special project and it was at in New
Mexico and it was to build a trainer if
you will
flight trainer and they built the flight
trainer it&#39;s a mechanical engineer
electrical engineer and through the
process a building he discovered that he
was to work with some other people
after got to a certain point the other
people came out and they were these
little guys and not much kind of
startling because they&#39;re all of you
know short short people but very very
intelligence like very intelligent
children super intelligent children and
pretty says pretty soon that became like
just the us sitting here and what they
were building was a trainer for us to
learn how to fly their aircraft it&#39;s a
very interesting approach so back to
your question the technology it comes
about in many different ways we refer to
the crashes the way Colonel Corso
documented those and Colonel general
Trudeau documented those and the input
from our own associate group during the
90s there is it&#39;s the uses I think more
it&#39;s the uses where we can from one
particular technology that supposedly
came from one of the retrievals let&#39;s
call them retrievals retrieved Technol
jeez the computer chip I think is one of
the best examples the computer chip
started out with computers but then it
became used in you know video cameras
then it became used as microcontrollers
in automobiles aircraft I think they had
to they had to figure out what they were
for you know a say well it&#39;s first of
all a silicon and first of all it is or
secondarily it&#39;s a something that looks
like it exists on other in other realms
outside the planet earth perhaps and
also fiber optics fiber optics was went
into these computer chips and mind you
the signal didn&#39;t travel on hard wire as
we know it previously it traveled
through a hollow core and in the form of
light colored light and each each color
had a spectrum and an assignment to do
certain thing color light sound form so
we have fiber optics that we put to you
oh hey what is this spaghetti that is in
these crafts attached to these computer
chips these silicon chips and these what
looks to be electronic equipment and
what is this metal that these craft are
made of or what appears to be metal they
did a lot of research they did reverse
engineer they had to do some testing yes
that&#39;s something that science does and
make it repeatable we get these things I
handheld scanners that we can scan the
body and determine it what is condition
health and also treat from the same
scanner are these things real well I can
tell you personally that we&#39;ve been
working on them and we have them cured
cancer
yes diagnose and cure again politics and
God bless them the FDA and other people
whose financial interests could be
damaged by the release of certain
technologies and this is not a this is
not a
weird statement there or not a slam
obviously can it can it be a win-win-win
situation for everybody this is the way
our technology development group views
the use of technologies I founded the
organization that that became when it
became a corporation in California yeah
I was associated with it six seven years
before so that would be yeah back in the
eighties we were contractors to the CIA
that was six years working for the skunk
works that was then during that time
period working for the skunk works was
five years and the military I was in for
a standard for yes there was
confirmation in 1997 I met some of our
what we called our expert recon people
in the military highly trained and and
you know we could blow up cities and
terminate great thousands number of
people but they did an exercise this is
a confirmation they did an exercise they
were hired by sea security in the United
States is constantly tested that&#39;s the
only way you&#39;re going to find out if
it&#39;s bulletproof or where you need to
improve they were hired this group they
do asset recovery now for people
throughout the world they were asked to
breach the security at area 51 and they
did a wonderful job and they did it and
this is the one way I thought how would
I do it well by gosh this is the way
they&#39;d do it
and they went through and they
disassembled piece by piece and you know
they could take out the pieces piece by
piece and it would send a signal and
alert and they could hide these guys
were experts they were expert recon
people from the military and they still
practice some of their techniques just
because it&#39;s stay in shape what did they
find was that there were many areas at
area 51 and security is as crazy as ever
there
that says something for the security
forces and they&#39;re a little bit nutty
because I think they&#39;re too far out away
from humanity most of the time and
that&#39;s a personal opinion it&#39;s not a
reflection on the management the idea
that there is craft being work on is it
is not just an idea
yes there was craft there I&#39;ve talked to
others that have worked on it there&#39;s
different levels there what you see on
the surface is not representative of all
of the research areas that are there but
where they&#39;re actually located if I were
you ask me can you take me there no I
couldn&#39;t do that I could think of where
the where the hangars are and where the
airfields are in the landing I know
there were two prominent people that to
this day I still know that founded what
we call area 51 there are two friends
right I had no idea it wasn&#39;t until
night 1995 and 96 that we were talking
about all this swapping stories if you
will that they told me that they looked
at me and said do you know who it was
who actually went out there for Kelly
Johnson and they named the names I&#39;d
like to keep those quiet for now because
they&#39;re still related to I mean they&#39;re
for the benefit of their families yeah
well they&#39;re retired but they&#39;re still
involved in yes by contract DuPont Oh
God
IBM what is now I think Western Digital
well I&#39;ve had business dealings with eg
AG they make they make the product for
us they have made products for our
corporation or private sector
corporations hey they&#39;re real they&#39;re a
contractor but good they were
responsible for
the safety delivery and return of
personnel to various work locations but
that isn&#39;t it that&#39;s just a small small
amount of their work he says they&#39;re
here well right over there and look at
the size of those ships and it&#39;s obvious
they don&#39;t like us being here and what
he went on to describe was Michael I
know both military planes only hears
these craft and their people observing
him and he&#39;s observing them Neil
Armstrong they said they don&#39;t want us
to be here no I have the written
communication we&#39;re three caves and
somewhere in the Wasatch Mountains we&#39;re
trying to line up to take a device you
know this recording device like this and
do research they did they eventually did
this the guardians of the caves and the
territory I&#39;ve been in the hands of the
Native American in that area for
hundreds and hundreds and maybe
thousands of years they are taught they
are visited quite often as they said
these people are not you know fringe
friend what I call fringe thinking
they&#39;re very solid they&#39;re they believe
in the great America the Great Spirit a
very solid practice of treating one
another here correctly how you&#39;d want to
be treated they the caretakers as
they&#39;re called or visited by these
extraterrestrials but there&#39;s some big
graves up there with people seven feet
and over blond-haired red hair light
skinned fairly well preserved
I mean you know where do they come from
I don&#39;t mean there&#39;s just one out of
many I&#39;ve seen pictures of them yeah I
saw they brought back still pictures I
don&#39;t need to the new video they brought
back still pictures so how they open up
these caves they they look just like
mountains they I don&#39;t know some who
knows I I don&#39;t know but they got in
there yeah there&#39;s technology weapons or
things that can heal there&#39;s spacecraft
so I&#39;m told
but this travel stone came out of one of
more ancient records are kept and yeah
this ancient language it&#39;s a root race
language it&#39;s what ever came before the
Sanskrit I think maybe senator Orrin
Hatch of Utah you know you getting
pretty close there&#39;s a lot going on in
Utah a lot going on everywhere that&#39;s
where the you know I I don&#39;t know all of
the things I really don&#39;t care
but that&#39;s where some of our associate
scientists are I know what some of the
things are working on well their own
private laboratories this guy yeah I
guess he was the chief master sergeant
the sergeant of sergeants or something
you know the who&#39;s who of stripes he
asked he came into the office one day
and he said I was on the commander staff
and becoming an officer I I&#39;m still on
the commander staff comes in and he
looks at me and I&#39;m I really liked the
guy because he had the depth of his
spirit you know say it&#39;s going to be in
a good military man and I said he looked
at me he said she worked for Kelly and I
knew I knew where the records were
because we know we don&#39;t exist and we
never worked there and the project never
existed and our conversations this
conversation never happened tonight that
kind of thing but when he says you
worked for Kelly that was a way of
saying we&#39;ve looked at your records do
you want to complete
your degree yes Barry Goldwater was my
sponsor
it was the commander&#39;s close buddy but
we knew him as general Goldwater I&#39;m
very proud of that and I served them
served it well I would say he did but he
was focused on developing a job there
were five people in the world of his
caliber and there were three of them
three of that caliber in the United
States one was Kelly Johnson the other
one was Jack Northrop who lived in my
neighborhood
Kelly Johnson lived in our neighborhood
I mean I lived across the Verdugo Valley
you overlooked that you look like a
chipmunk to me the greatest chipmunk in
the world yeah you&#39;re calling the
chipmunk in fact the skunk that&#39;s where
the skunk you know sort of like a
chipmunk
that was our symbol so all of these
things are tied together in some way
linked but not necessarily everybody
knowing each other but were they all
headed in the same direction you know we
don&#39;t we assumed they were but the right
hand and the left hand and our levels of
engineering yeah we knew what we were
working on in what the probabilities
were springing from it and the future
development but where they ultimately
were led where it led and what would
spring from that how it was used I
learned one thing from an associate
scientist development scientist somebody
whom I have the greatest the highest
respect who was with the CIA he says you
know he says the first thing we want to
determine is who&#39;s turning the wheels on
any project
he says that&#39;s when we decide this is
what I did when I was with the CIA he
said this is what I analyzed before I
said yes on taking on a project you see
who&#39;s turning the wheels
whoo what&#39;s the motivation why is it
being done I asked it took me what after
we first talked I analyzed why is dr.
Steven Greer doing this I done my
research some of it or maybe a lot of it
and I&#39;ve watched the happening and
you&#39;ve been very dedicated to what
you&#39;re doing and and professional that&#39;s
why I&#39;m here tonight that&#39;s why I&#39;m
speaking with you and we still have
those contacts around the world that can
verify a lot of things we all have our
agreements that we signed and they&#39;re
still you know to be honored however
there isn&#39;t any reason why certain
information can&#39;t be shared when it&#39;s
for the benefit of humanity one of the
things one of the premises for founding
this technology corporation that I did
in 1998 was to bring forth these
technologies that can help get rid of
the toxics that can clean the air that
help get rid of the need for so much
fossil fuel or help it become more
efficient that can help humanity in the
form of Education that makes it helps
clean up pollution I already said that
in various forms yes it is time and I
can tell you personally that it&#39;s
already started and I can prove what we
have come up with we can prove
the energy generation systems that the
associates have brought forth deal with
using natural energies from planet earth
and there is a natural harmonics of the
planet it&#39;s already been proven one of
our own Air Force Research members I
think out of wright-patterson our Dayton
Ohio pardon me map the energy system of
the of the planet Earth they&#39;ve also
discovered that there are craft
underneath that sand flying craft I&#39;ve
never seen them I don&#39;t know NASA itself
got involved in spending ten million
dollars of our taxpayer money to go in
and get a certain thing it&#39;s only
written about in mythology and history
go back bring it out and try to
duplicate it okay this I know to be true
but when I turned around look right into
the eyes of this little creature
and
you&#39;re seeing it but everything&#39;s being
pulled from your mind pains you felt you
feel that and it&#39;s like a buzz saw going
off on your head he was reading my whole
life
