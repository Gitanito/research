My heart is pounding so hard I KNOW he will hear it as he passes within feet of my face. I placed my hands over my mouth/nose because he is coming back this way, I could feel my throat spasm and totally close off. I felt my body shutting down and then I had a flash of my entire life including pre-birth. Then I was up and looking down at my back and I wasn't scared I just kept thinking that any minute he'd go away and then I'll start to breathe again. I was okay with my body dying. Then I remember looking up and being pulled/sucked toward a great white light. When I got closer to the light, I saw the outline of adults. I was only there for a moment before I was sucked back and then I was breathing again. I looked around and it was now dark out with no sign of that man. I lay for a while just breathing and listening for any sign of him. I got up and RAN for home. I felt really weird after.
