welcome dr greer
thank you great seeing you again pat
yeah good seeing you
um dr greer this has been a very
difficult few weeks for the world uh we
have all watched the conflict unfolding
in the ukraine and with heavy hearts for
all
and i know that many many people have
reached out with questions as one can
imagine
can you share with us some of your
thoughts on this conflict and and maybe
as it relates to
the most questions begin with
why
will the ets not step in and help with
this
yeah well first i want to say that this
is you know of course the worst conflict
the most dangerous one uh since world
war ii in europe
um although certainly not the the only
conflict that you know we&#39;ve witnessed
in recent years
i think that it&#39;s monstrous when any
country is invaded by another country
uh it was monstrous frankly when the
united states invaded iraq uh under
false pretense
senses and i said so then
and it&#39;s now been proven that dick
cheney and his henchmen
uh falsely created uh weapons of mass
destruction evidence that sodom hussein
did not have
to justify going into there for
reasons i&#39;ll get to in a moment
uh now we have a monstrous situation
horrible where we have innocent children
women civilians
being targeted
uh who are mostly defenseless in terms
of their own ability to stop things
raining from the sky
but it&#39;s much more dangerous
and the reason it&#39;s much more dangerous
is that
ukraine is surrounded by or adjacent to
several nato countries
which of course are part of the united
states great britain and france and
other uh you know nuclear powers russia
has one of the biggest if not largest
nuclear arsenals in the world
and so it&#39;s very different than a
situation where
uh
horrific things
have happened in other regions of the
world the iran iraq war
uh back some decades ago a million
innocent civilians were killed during
that conflict
uh and we we&#39;ve had seen this throughout
human history
but now we could this disaster
if it&#39;s not handled properly could put
us on the brink of world war iii a truly
uh catastrophic situation
and the meanwhile
what isn&#39;t being discussed is context
and history of this
and i think that
one of the big problems is that
there is not
global
initiatives
to enforce peace
and that sounds crazy but you have to
enforce a peace
and humans have to have peace on earth
in peace and space and we&#39;ve been going
in the wrong direction uh ever since
world war ii uh of course the united
nations was formed after world war ii
but it&#39;s a toothless paper tiger frankly
uh and so you still are left with uh war
mongers and superpower conflicts and
of their aspirations
and there are grievances on all sides
for example and by what i&#39;m about to say
no way
in no way
justifies the monstrous destruction
and invasion of ukraine going on by
russia right now
however those of you need a history
lesson refresher perhaps
when the soviet union fell apart 30 some
years ago
nato and the united states agreed not to
expand nato eastward
however seven of the eight warsaw pac
countries which were soviet satellite
countries and soviet territories
are now part of nato
and this has upset russia for 30 years
so there&#39;s a history of people on all
sides reneging on their agreements
in this push to full
continuously militarize
the world
and and this is you know it&#39;s
you know it&#39;s funny back in the 90s when
i was meeting with uh butrust but
truscali the u.n secretary general and
his wife and leah golly turned in and
leaned into me talking about all these
conflicts with all these people
manipulating geopolitical situations
staying in a pox on all their houses
because she was so disgusted by it
and i said yes but you know there&#39;s some
root problems to this
that we have we need to start talking
about that&#39;s what we&#39;re going to talk
about tonight and it squarely has to do
with the ufo issue in a way that may
shock people
shocking
and when i first started this process
when i was a very young doctor briefing
people like the director of the cia for
bill clinton and others i brought up the
fact that the geopolitical situation
that is central
to uh the projection of military power
is rooted in the energy system we use
oil
so let me translate for you
when people say our vital national
security interests in the middle east
what are they talking about they&#39;re not
talking about the sand
the camels
or the culture
or the religion
they&#39;re talking about oil
and gas
now we have a situation where western
europe is completely
hostage and dependent on russian oil and
gas
uh we have a situation where the
catastrophe in venezuela
has been empowered by that oil wealth
greg easter brook years ago in the new
republic wrote an article about oil
being the black curse
referring to the fact that these petro
stakes
where there&#39;s a great deal of oil wells
end up being corrupt
kleptocracies where oligarchs and
leaders take the wealth of the nation it
doesn&#39;t really benefit
the man on the street
but it empowers military hunters
militarism etc and so on
uh similarly the countries that don&#39;t
have
enough oil
then become very dependent and will have
to capitulate
to uh tyranny
or to the reality the fact that they
have to keep the lights on and their
house is heated and their factories
running
and unfortunately
this is not possible
unless we bring out the underlying
covert
viciously sequestered secret ufo
technologies we&#39;re going to talk about
this for the next hour
now
what&#39;s happening right now was
predictable
avoidable
and
my frustration you&#39;re hearing in my
voice is that in the briefings i i did
all the way back
when i met with the science advisors to
the presidents
including
vice president al gore science advisor
dr kohlenberg
and begged them begged them
to declassify and get to the bottom of
these technologies even if it was
dangerous to do so even if they were
threatened and they were
because if we do not get off these
uh
oil gas coal
and public utility systems
that lea that only is damaging the
environment and five million people a
year die just from the
particulate matter from lung disease and
heart disease people don&#39;t know this
forget about global warming people are
dying by the millions just from the junk
in the air this is a you&#39;ll look this
statistic up
and so
we have a situation in the ukraine and
with russia
that has been
allowed to happen over a number of
issues not just the oil issue that&#39;s one
of them
but the underlying world order that&#39;s so
dysfunctional
in large part where there&#39;s been
conflict all over the world
has to do with superpower and other
states
jockeying for commodity and resource
control
that translates to energy and oil and
coal and uranium and so forth
so
now that&#39;s a very dangerous situation
it&#39;s one thing when it happens during
world war one and world war ii
and people are hurling you know
uh
artillery and things of this sort are
dropping conventional bombs
but when you have thousands of
thermonuclear weapons
uh each of which are multiple times more
destructive than the ones dropped on
hiroshima and nagasaki
this is a game of chicken that&#39;s been
going on for decades that&#39;s been
avoidable
and so i think that people have to
understand that the geopolitical reality
of the world the militarism in the world
the centralized power
of a number of states
has to do with the energy
and the commodities and the petrodollar
system etc and so forth
so these great power conflicts
are which all
nations have engaged in through human
history are greatly exacerbated
by what
mr easter brook called the black curse
oil and gas and with it coal and all the
all the conventional energy systems
which for 100 years since the time on
nikola tesla we have not needed
now
as far as the extraterrestrial
question
you know we&#39;ve talked about this a lot
pat
i remember back in the 1990s being asked
by a
woman who was from japan
when i was given a presentation and said
why didn&#39;t the et stop
those two bombs from incinerating
hundreds of thousands of people in
hiroshima and nagasaki
i said well they were certainly aware we
were doing this
but
if they were to intervene
a
humanity would learn no lessons
b
we would be portraying them as invaders
this is a huge problem
if you look at the cosmic hoax which we
released about eight months ago nine
months ago
yeah we articulate the reason why
there&#39;s been a 70-year
strategic defense plan
to demonize
the et and ufo presence
because that&#39;s ultimately the last card
quote unquote that verner von braun who
invented the rocket tradeoff that
learned world war ii
warned us about that they would try to
concoct an alien threat now imagine if
there was
a force
from another star system
that came in and intervened on one side
or another
in this kind of squabble
it&#39;s a lose-lose situation unfortunately
and the worst would be the future of
humans and extraterrestrials being
together peacefully because it would
immediately be taken
by these spin artists
like we&#39;ve seen in the last three or
four years since unacknowledged came out
there&#39;s been one
lackey working on behalf of the
intelligence community after another on
60 minutes cnn all over the world
talking about the threat to the national
security by ufos it&#39;s been a constant
drum beat
now imagine in this media
in this environment
there&#39;s an e.t overt intervention
or even covert
and suddenly
you have a situation where
people will then be through the mass
media that&#39;s controlled by the
intelligence community
would pivot to oh my god not only do we
have this conflict going on in an area
the size of texas
ukraine
now we&#39;re being invaded by aliens
and it would be taken and spun in that
direction
faster than the speed of light
i know it
everyone in the intelligence community
i&#39;ve met with knows it
so
if look if we have figured this out and
people i&#39;ve dealt with on the senate
intelligence committee that we&#39;ve had
conversations
if if we have figured this out you know
they
these interstellar civilizations have
and so they&#39;re waiting for humans to
become
civilized
and civilized means we don&#39;t
address our grievances by bombing the
hell out of each other
or killing each other
we can discuss it we can do whatever uh
now once you get to a situation like
this where you have
a relatively poorly armed
country like ukraine being invaded by a
superpower
then you&#39;re on the horns of a dilemma
if there&#39;s enough if there&#39;s a
significant intervention from nato or
the united states
russia
putin and his foreign minister have said
that&#39;s world war three
so if you&#39;re at the pentagon and i&#39;m
dealing with this
as we speak tonight talking to people
then you run the risk of being in world
war iii
but the worst version of world war iii
would be an interplanetary conflict
which would mean if the et&#39;s were to
intervene
now this is a sad situation
but there&#39;s another part of this and
that is
let&#39;s take some recent history
united states after 9 11 invaded not
only iraq but before that
afghanistan
we just catastrophically extricated
ourselves from there
in the most bungled
clumsy mess i&#39;ve ever seen
but the idea was that we were going to
go in there and do nation building
that&#39;s the euphemism we&#39;re going to go
in there
and the warlords and everyone else will
be converted somehow
to western jeffersonian democracies
well how well did that work out
it didn&#39;t
it&#39;s a disaster it&#39;s probably as bad or
worse now than it was when we went in 20
years ago even though we&#39;ve spent two
trillion dollars
and endless hundreds of thousands of of
innocent civilians in afghanistan have
died
now
the et&#39;s know this every world
that has a proclivity towards conflict
has to reach a point where they&#39;re going
to decide are we going to live together
in peace on earth and peace and space
or face annihilation
that&#39;s the question that we have been
facing for 70 years but it has not been
framed properly because the only way
we&#39;re going to get to a peaceful and
enlightened civilization
is collective security where we all
agree that whatever geopolitical
boundaries exist
are inviolate
one country does not invade another or
attack another
and if it does every nation on earth
would do would stop it
but the world is not in that state now
there is no consensus
from every nation on earth to stop
anyone from doing anything
which is why these problems keep
continuing
now there is
i&#39;m just going to call this and
i&#39;ve never really talked about this
explicitly
something that i call the cosmic
organization
there&#39;s an interstellar interplanetary
organization it&#39;s cosmic
that have certain principles and one of
them is that they do not invade
and enforce their level of civilization
on a less developed civilization
they watch
they may do things behind the scenes and
they have
for example 20th anniversary of the
disclosure project everyone saw this
it&#39;s up on our youtube channel now
we had a russian general talking about
how they had a nuclear weapon
overheating and ets went in and sort of
put everyone in sort of a suspended
animation while they went in and fixed
this so it didn&#39;t blow up why because if
that missile had exploded the u.s might
have felt that they were doing a launch
or we were entering into defcon one
defense condition one where all nuclear
missiles would be launched so the et&#39;s
absolutely
have done a few things like that to keep
us from the worst case scenarios
happening
very behind the scenes and that&#39;s not
the only one similar events have
happened in the united states that i
know have personal knowledge of from
disclosure project witnesses
but in terms of an overt intervention
as opposed to doing something just to
buy us time until we grow up
uh no that is not going to happen now
what are the conditions in which there
would be a massive intervention let&#39;s
talk about that
i wrote about this in my 1999 book
extraterrestrial contact the evidence
and implications in my first book
out of five
now i understand it&#39;s not
in fashion to read but if people would
please read this
there
it has a very explicit chapter
on
the ufo extraterrestrial subject
and a comprehensive assessment
now that comprehensive assessment that&#39;s
in that book was done at the request
of a certain three letter agency
and it made its way through the
aerospace industry and i&#39;ll never forget
when dr robert woods who is a
aerospace engineer and subsequent
disclosure of project witness
who worked for mcdonald douglas
of course merged later with boeing
uh he he called me up this is how i met
him he says and he was calling from
mcdonald douglas this is in the 90s he
said this is the most
accurate
assessment of this subject
we have ever read and it had gone
through the intelligence community in
the aerospace industry
and this was before i was too much in
the public eye frankly and i was doing
this as a an emergency doctor shuttling
between north carolina and dc and doing
stuff you know it&#39;s that crazy life i&#39;ve
had
um
but
i said well thank you and he says but
how do you know this
i saw i&#39;ve had contact with the et&#39;s and
i understand what the cosmic
organization&#39;s policies are
and a key policy is
that they do not intervene unless it
gets to something where it would be an
ele
an extinction level event now what are
those
okay
one would be a massive thermonuclear
exchange not one or two
like hiroshima and nagasaki but
something that could literally damage
the entire earth
as being a place where suitable for the
evolution of intelligent life
which is a long-term objective of these
civilizations it goes back millions of
years frankly
on earth
the second would be a geophysical
catastrophe
for example if we continue to degrade
the biosphere
at the rate we&#39;re degrading it and i&#39;ll
remind people that in 1997
25 years ago
i had a about a 10 or 11 hour meeting
with the deputy director of the national
science foundation in charge of studying
climate change
uh dr bob carrell
and dr nancy maynard who was one of the
five directors of nasa
and she was in charge of what was called
the mission to planet earth i thought it
was funny because i had called the et
mission to earth the mission to planet
earth
but they had their own mission to planet
earth and she was a phd satellite
imaging specialist
for nasa
that imaged
the biosphere from space
this is 97
a quarter of a century ago and she
turned to me and she said dr greer if
the public knew
the rate of decay
of the biosphere that is happening there
would be and i&#39;m quoting
wide spread panic
in the streets
now if that continues and we do have
situations happen you could you know
lose lose both polar ice caps that could
destabilize the rotational stability of
the earth and its wobble
goes back and forth it&#39;s called the
seasons right it tilts tilts tilts
you could have a catastrophic situation
i&#39;m not trying to scare anyone i&#39;m just
telling you you know as the chinese
proverb goes unless we change directions
we are likely to end up where we are
going
now the et&#39;s have been warning about
this since the 50s
we&#39;ve been warning about it
it&#39;s fallen on deaf ears from moscow to
washington to beijing to
wherever
now so here we are in 2022 facing this
situation
but people need to understand that the
ets have
assets deployed
around the earth
under the earth
under the oceans out in our solar system
etc
and those are for
these worst case scenarios that i
mentioned in this comprehensive
assessment paper that&#39;s in our first
book
now
i know what i&#39;m talking about tonight&#39;s
bit heavy and it&#39;s kind of intellectual
and i
apologize for it
but
you know but it&#39;s time that we all begin
to speak as adults here um it we&#39;re
getting very long in the game
that verna von braun warned about
of this last card being played
and there&#39;s all kinds of chicanery going
on
uh where various
powers behind the scenes want to see
this spiral further and further out of
control
i know from people i deal with in
washington that certain people
have go backs ready to go
who are dealing with homeland security
and other
um departments
and
it&#39;s it&#39;s a situation that isn&#39;t being
honestly addressed to the american
people
or to the world public but the ets know
exactly what&#39;s going on and this is what
they were concerned about when they met
with uh president eisenhower in 1956 in
murak which did happen
when i was doing the briefings and
putting things together for president
sarkozy the president of france and
doing the ce5 contact demonstration for
their
uh ministry of defense back about 10
years
12 years ago
i got this document that was an account
of someone who was at that meeting that
the french intelligence had
about the meeting with eisenhower
and these et&#39;s out in the desert there
were edwards air force base is now this
is 1956 where they were asking us
to put down arms to become peaceful
to do things that for the earth and its
environment and to be in space
peacefully
eisenhower was inclined to do so
the warmongers the war profiteers the
industrial fascists
said no
and then they further later cut him the
president eisenhower out of the loop
that&#39;s why he gave his famous speech but
where the military industrial complex
in
1961 as he was leaving office today he
left office as president
after being a president for eight years
so i think that and he was a republican
i mean this was not an anti-military
hippie abby hoffman or something in the
60s this is you know a fight that you
know five-star general
and uh
moderately conservative republican
saying this of course everybody was sort
of like what&#39;s this all about
well we know what it was about it was
this issue
so now here we are from 1961 to now how
many years is that right
we&#39;re talking you know 61 years
um
and
almost two-thirds of a century and we&#39;re
still
doing the same behavior
and of course you know the very
definition of insanity he&#39;s doing the
same thing over and over expecting a
different result
uh and and so that&#39;s you know the
context i think people need to have a
big picture
of of of viewing this now it doesn&#39;t
solve that problem i mean my view i&#39;m
not you know a state department official
is that there needs to be an immediate
ceasefire
uh ukraine if i think the wise choice at
this point was to say we&#39;re going to be
neutral the way sweden and finland and
switzerland are and we&#39;re not going to
be a militarized nato country
and
russia has said that that would satisfy
them well
if sweden and finland and and
switzerland who are in the heart of
europe and advanced western democracies
have agreed not to be part of nato so
can the ukraine but
that&#39;s that&#39;s an immediate sort of
tactical political issue i want to get
to the bigger roots problems that we&#39;ve
been talking about here
and and the next thing i want to go into
is
the
technologies
when you have
a civilization
that goes 100 years longer
using a destructive form of energy
that is scarce and relatively expensive
such as oil gas coal public utilities
and also solar and wind very expensive
and
very
low density of energy
you have a situation where the world
geopolitically is vulnerable
to uh the machinations of people who are
controlling those assets
now to give you an idea of the kind of
wealth we&#39;re talking about just on the
chicago board of trade
some years ago i read an economist
article that was talking about
derivatives and instruments for trading
commodities
700
trillion dollars
worth a year
now just the churning of those
instruments you know futures contracts
and all this imagine what that generates
now if you come out with zero point
energy energy that you pull
from
the quantum vacuum of space around us
you have zero cost for the energy
it&#39;s completely decentralized every home
business etc has quote unquote free
energy
what tesla called the infinite energy
field
um
there is no pollution there&#39;s no
radiation
and there&#39;s no cost
but there&#39;s also no centralized power
so let me cut to the chase this is the
world order as it exists is about
massive
and we&#39;re not talking about the budget
of the united states you know a few
trillion dollars hundreds if not
thousands of trillions of dollars in
assets commodities corporations that are
linked directly
into the type of energy that runs the
planet for eight billion people
the other problem with it is that it&#39;s
intrinsically
destabilizing geopolitically as we were
talking about a moment ago with this
situation where western europe is very
dependent on russian gas and oil
and you know how do you bite the hand
that&#39;s feeding you right
like the nine inch nails song you know
how you bite the hand at fiji um
but
it&#39;s something broader than that
you have a situation with those energy
systems that require
a priori
that about half the world&#39;s population
live in terrible poverty and injustice
i was just reading an article that 3
billion with a b billion people
have no gas and no electricity
and that&#39;s why they&#39;re chopping down
woods and brush and old forest and
rainforest to make charcoal and get wood
to cook their food
three billion with a b
now that&#39;s
almost a billion people more than lived
on earth in the 20s
when nikola tesla had free energy
so this is a massive
problem
that we have been discussing and trying
to get people in power to do something
about
there&#39;s only so much one can do through
that the establishment though
because virtually everyone in power
whether it&#39;s in the united states or
moscow or elsewhere
do not want to take on
interests that have a thousand times
more
power let&#39;s say and and money
then the white house can deploy
or 10 downing street can
or
whatever in france anywhere you know so
i think this is a situation where the
industrial fascism that started in the
1800s and early 1900s
that mussolini adopted and then hitler
adopted it never went away it just
became more nuanced
but the world situation we have
the the real power is rooted in
industrial fascism of various sorts
um and that&#39;s true whether it&#39;s a
you know a centralized
sort of totalitarian system like china
or russia
and venezuela or an alleged democracy
like the united states united kingdom
etc
and that&#39;s just the reality of the power
that is a derivative
directly
of the type of energy we use
so
i always tell people bringing out these
new technologies
is about
truly power to the people literally in
terms of energy power
but figuratively
but right now everyone is basically a
sitting duck depending on this stuff
your house my
i have the largest
listen to this
i have the largest legally allowable
solar farm in the state of virginia
right here i&#39;m pointing at it
in my meadow
it will not heat or cool this house at
all
the lights yeah maybe the water for the
pump
but when we had a foot of wet snow in
january
all power went out this region for a
week
we were in this house with 38 degree
temperatures
no heat
in the summer we had a radio come
through we had neighbors with no
electricity for three weeks
and 106 degree heat index
and this is in the united states of
america
in in in the 21st century
now
imagine the desperation of the people in
ukraine
these cities are being bombed they have
no water
yesterday a six-year-old child died in
one of those cities because there was no
water
in the 21st century
in the central part of europe a child
dies because there&#39;s no water to drink
a hundred years after we had the
solution to the environmental energy and
prosperity and justice social justice
issue
so i&#39;m telling people
the governments are not going to fix
this problem
had i thought
washington or other
people
around the world in capitals would have
done anything about it
i would have never come public with the
disclosure project ever
i
did it 20 years 21 years ago because we
had concluded by 1997-98
that the people of the world are going
to have to unite
they&#39;re going to have to fund and
support these technologies they&#39;re going
to have to bring them out open source
and that&#39;s why that&#39;s been one of the
three pillars
that we our project is resting on one is
peaceful
contact and enlightenment
with ets and humans the ce5 contact
initiative and b anyone in the world can
get the ce5 contact app and do this and
people are
the other is the disclosure project
because people have to be educated about
it
and the third is trying to bring the
technologies the physical technologies
out that we have not succeeded at
obviously
now we have a situation 50 60 percent of
the population believe we&#39;re not alone
in the universe
that we have done
there are millions of people doing ce5
contact having peaceful contact but the
world is still a basket case because
it&#39;s still dependent on the black curse
of the old energy system from the 1800s
now i think the solution is is sitting
there for us
but it&#39;s costly
you know we crowdfunded our
documentaries we crowdfunded the app we
crowdfunded the disclosure project
uh we have no office or staff as you
know
um
100 of these pro seeds go in to further
the work and and we would like to see it
further reach the point where we could
actually develop these technologies but
that we&#39;re talking about is tens of
millions of dollars you&#39;re not going to
develop a high energy physics lab for a
few hundred thousand dollars one
workstation is five hundred thousand to
a million dollars
using the kind of equipment you need
so
now you would think in an age of
high-tech silicon valley
unicorns billion-dollar startups doing
frivolity
and ipos behind
you know things like tick tock or
whatever bringing in you know untold
billions
that wouldn&#39;t be so hard but nobody has
wanted to do it yet
now i&#39;m making an appeal tonight people
need to do it and we can prove that
these technologies exist who wants to
fund them
that is an act of courage because it&#39;s
an act of defiance i mean just like the
ukrainian people are trying to defy
this you know brutal invasion
the people of the world need to
unite in an act of peaceful defiance
of the the current world order
of
petro-nazis
fascism based on the current energy
system
and i think that
when you think about this i mean
people new to this who may be just now
watching this youtube channel
you know look at this thing they call
the tic tac that are navy jets i just
had a long conversation with the pilot
of that jet fighter that chased
uh
you know that uh tic tac up because
california some years ago in the early
2000s
and
that thing was moving
up down
vertical
no means of propulsion no jets no
rockets
and they had infrared on it no heat
source like you get from something being
burned
it&#39;s electromagnetic field propulsion
and guess what
those have been developed since before i
was born
that thing flying around when we
mastered gravity control
the top scientists at the naval research
lab was in the quote vault
and saw the unredacted document that
stated that that
was mastered in october of 1954.
so now we&#39;re talking you know 68 years
ago
and so you think okay two-thirds of a
century later
we still are using rockets
jets
cars
coal gas and oil burning power plants
nuclear power which is very
dangerous
and yes we have
20 of our electricity united states
from hydroelectric that&#39;s seven and a
half percent and and wind and solar
the problem is
the other you know if you have a say a
tesla car or an electric car
and you know we have two we have two
that are plug-in electric hybrids
that energy is coming out of a
coal-fired and gas-fired power grid
except for maybe
19-20 percent of that energy
so people think that when you plug in
your electric car it&#39;s magically getting
charged from the ether
no it&#39;s from a very polluting source
and the lithium-ion batteries the
hundreds of pounds of lithium-ion
batteries the pollution that&#39;s created
by manufacturing those is enormous
toxic waste
so
that you know it it makes people feel
good pat but it&#39;s not the solution my
solar farm is great i&#39;m trying to help
it&#39;s not the ultimate solution
um
we know what the solution is
but when the vice president al gore and
al gore did an inconvenient truth and is
this great champion of the environment
but guess what
think about the enormous hypocrisy
of being the vice president of the
united states receiving this information
this positive proof of these
technologies existing
but because it&#39;s too dangerous
to stick your neck out you turn your
back on it and then you just blow
bloviate for decades about the problem
but refuse to endorse the solutions
and that&#39;s true of people on the left
the right the middle the whole thing
so
this is something that i speak of with
authority because i&#39;ve had taken the
meetings with people like this around
the world
and i understand the fear i do i mean i
understand the lethal threats that are
made i under i&#39;ve had them i understand
the people who&#39;ve been killed i have
people on my team that have been
assassinated i&#39;ve almost been
assassinated
but you know you have now you know
a situation where eight billion people
whose lives hang in the balance
not only from the risk of thermonuclear
war
but of environmental collapse
and so i think we have to grow up
and we have to decide that as a people
we&#39;re going to come together
and manifest the courage that obviously
are
unfortunately our leaders lack
so this is where i am 100 non-partisan
and apolitical because i have dealt with
people on all sides of the aisle in
multiple countries
and none of them want to do the right
thing because it&#39;s dangerous and it is
dangerous
and i had a person with an mba say to me
once you know your problem is you&#39;re not
willing to to
you tell the truth about the risks and
the benefits i said well i&#39;m a doctor
you you always disclose what the
benefits and the risks are or you&#39;re
unethical if not assaulting a patient
and i said he says yes but that&#39;s not
how business works
you just sort of like brush over the
risk and then blow up the benefits no i
mean it&#39;s clearly you have to be honest
about this because these people&#39;s lives
are in the balance here
um and i understand that you know all
the hundreds of people who come to me
with top secret documents and
information they are in mortal danger
and they are heroes
but we&#39;re not going to find that kind of
uncommon courage as it&#39;s called
at 1600 pennsylvania avenue under any
president i&#39;ve dealt with since clinton
you&#39;re not if if there&#39;s a member of
congress
that has that kind of courage please
introduce them to us
i&#39;m in washington every week
or someone in some other government
in the meanwhile i wouldn&#39;t bet the farm
on it
i think we the people have got to unite
bring up the definitive solutions which
we have been extant in existence since
before you and i were born and we&#39;re not
spring chickens honey so
i think that&#39;s what we have to do
and
i think that
when you look at how these ufos move the
man-made ones and the e.t ones those
technologies are very elegant because
they&#39;re electromagnetic field propulsion
and they&#39;re pulling energy from
so-called zero point but through what&#39;s
called the quantum vacuum i&#39;m not gonna
get into the physics of this too far
and then you take it to another level
and you can go from point a to b in
space
you know like that
almost like a teleportation well it is
but just the the what i call level one
advanced technology would be something
that sits
in your house like your heat pump it
runs your house with no energy costs and
no pollution
that is what can be
created now and distributed and i had a
conversation with the head of the air
force
in char a colonel in charge of future
technologies
which is a euphemism for this kind of
thing they call them future when they
already have it by the way but remember
the double speaker military and
intelligence people
um
i should do a whole workshop on counter
intelligence and double speak in in
these communities but um and you know
they go to a place called the farm
out here in virginia to learn how to
professionally lie about all this i know
where i know people have been there
um i go buy it every time i go into dc
from my house here and what&#39;s
interesting is that he said to me he
says
don&#39;t it&#39;s too early to bring out the
things that fly because that can be
turned into a missile delivery system
i.e a man-made ufo
but yeah the ones that are the ones that
would run your car or house those you
know we think would be fine if you
brought those out
but he didn&#39;t speak for this
group of psychopaths and sociopaths
that run that are the uber oligarchs of
the planet running the whole petro
dollar in oil and and macroeconomic
system
they do not want that out because they
know they&#39;re going to go the way of all
flesh
because the power they have literally
the physical power but then the
figurative power they have would slip
through their fingers like grains of
sand and they know it
because then every village in africa has
free energy and electrification
refrigeration
even the deserts will bloom as it says
in this in scriptures
because you can then have water
delivered now one of the things that&#39;s
coming out um
some of you have seen this and people
think it&#39;s a film that i did it&#39;s not
it&#39;s called above top secret
um and it&#39;s a nod also to the great book
that timothy good wrote back in the 80s
i believe it was called above top secret
but it&#39;s about these technologies and
it&#39;s coming out april 5th
it&#39;s exciting because it&#39;s coming out
three days before the april
conference we&#39;re doing in scottsdale
which is going to be about all our
community coming together
and meditation and enlightenment and
praying for peace but also acting and
creating peace with humans
and et&#39;s but also on earth and we&#39;re
going to do a big meditation
and go around the world with thousands
of people online i hope millions of
people online and everyone there
creating and seeing through higher
consciousness the world transitioning
very quickly off the path it&#39;s on now
onto this path of enlightenment and
peace on earth and in space and peaceful
energy
uh and i think that&#39;s how we get to a
level one civilization
level one civilization is one that&#39;s
living in peace and that is not damaging
its environment anymore because it&#39;s
adapted
uh adopted i should say since they exist
already
these wonderful wondrous sciences and
technologies
that have been coming through the minds
of humans
for over 100 years in fact i have
documents and information that even in
the mid to late 1800s these
electromagnetic effects were seen
and documented
but they weren&#39;t understood they were
really well understood
by the 1920s to 1950s actually
including so-called anti-gravity
key towns and brown
19 late 1920s had elect high voltage
systems with crystalline materials where
they would levitate
that was then reproduced in germany the
koloski frost experiment we have the
cover of a physics journal that shows
this
so that&#39;s 100 years ago now my friend so
what are what are we doing i mean we
have to have a global awakening and this
is you know a lot of people ask you know
you know people like demi lovato i said
this is one of the reasons why we need
demi and other people who have been
helping us get the word out get the word
out because we need to get the word out
way past the you know few thousand
people who are interested in in the
ufo&#39;s subculture let&#39;s say it&#39;s got to
go mainstream
and now that you know a billion people
have heard and seen the fact that
there&#39;s
there are ufos and we have footage and
the pentagon has acknowledged they&#39;re
real although
they pretend they don&#39;t know what they
are and they&#39;re a threat to the national
security that part of it&#39;s false but at
least
it&#39;s it&#39;s a dialogue now
and this is why we can engage in a
dialogue as we are doing in washington
with with senior members of the congress
and in government
but that&#39;s a very slow process
and usually it gets worded
and this is why the default
it&#39;s really resting on your shoulders
and my show everyone&#39;s
who is a civilian who understands this
because the people in the system
this is an interesting thing
i i&#39;ve only told this story a couple
times but back in the early night it was
1992
and
the head of army intelligence had
intercepted me and after we had the four
eet craft appear in the sky in florida
near gulf breeze in pensacola
and
general stubblebine was there with some
of his associates with from the ci nsa
about a month later in atlanta
and they pulled me aside and threatened
me frankly
and a month later
offered me two billion dollars if i
would
shut up and join their committee and i
said no thank you
they went to my wife tried to convince
her to convince me
but during the course of that
event which was shocking to me frankly
there was a woman who i don&#39;t want to
name who&#39;s the good friend with prince
charles and the royal family in the
united kingdom who was there
and i was sort of very young to this i
was 92
i&#39;d only been on the scene doing this
for a year and a half or something and
she says you know
the reason they&#39;re so angry with you
is that
they can&#39;t do what you&#39;re doing
i said oh i&#39;m sure they could i could
teach them to meditate and do no no it&#39;s
not that
they&#39;re lifers
they&#39;re owned by this system
they&#39;re in that system and they&#39;ll never
be able to get out and you&#39;re free
she says you don&#39;t know where you&#39;re
lucky
you&#39;re lucky because you&#39;re nobody
you&#39;re lucky because you&#39;re not in that
system you&#39;re lucky because you&#39;re a
country doctor rattling around in an
emergency department in north carolina
and i i looked at her and i said well
i&#39;ve never thought of it that way he
says well you should think of it that
way
so that&#39;s what i&#39;m saying to everyone
tonight view yourselves as being lucky
that you&#39;re empowered to be free
and to do what is right and follow your
conscience but also you&#39;ve got to put
one foot in front of the other
and make a difference because
we are entering into a very
writ large dangerous phase of human
civilization
and we are going to be faced with these
existential life and death extinction
or going forward
choices
they&#39;ve been coming at us for 50 60 70
years they&#39;re going to come at us much
more quickly now
and i think this is a call to action
for people to come together
and you know um whenever we talk about
this in groups
the first thing that people say is what
can i do i mean they all feel like
they&#39;re just one person
they&#39;re one person in in this sea of
of whatever and they think that they&#39;re
completely
irrelevant right and they they
they have no power and it&#39;s amazing for
me to see this in people they have no
idea the power that they have oh every
human being has infinite power yes and
so i mean literally literally this is
what they will ask what can i do what is
step number one for me what would you
say to them
number one
connect to the aspect of yourself that
is the infinite self
that i mean my
my lucky situation was that i
grew up very poor and very in a
difficult situation but then i was lucky
enough to die when i was 17 and had this
beautiful experience you know
um
and
of the aspect of ourselves of all of us
that&#39;s the singularity of oneness the
oneness of pure consciousness that&#39;s at
the root of our being awake you&#39;re awake
now i&#39;m awake anyone listening to this
is conscious
if you&#39;re a sentient awake being
you have the totality
of that infinite field
of consciousness and energy
and power within you
now
thinking intellectually about it don&#39;t
make it so
you&#39;ve got to practice meditation you
need to introspection
then you have to act
and the action is where everyone drops
the ball
because you will be guided and get
intuitions and then you&#39;ll go ah i&#39;m not
going to do that that&#39;s crazy
now everything i&#39;ve done in my life
that&#39;s been meaningful
has been against
the conventional wisdom
you know and it&#39;s it&#39;s very personal i
mean i literally have had to
do the opposite of what everyone told me
i could do and should do so
i think that now i&#39;m a bit of a
cantankerous son of a people who
know me well i mean i take no prisoners
and you know i&#39;m a nice guy until i&#39;m
not nice and then it&#39;s
i&#39;m a bit of a bull but you know
but the truth is everyone has their
god-given temperament and gifts
and everyone has to ask themselves not
me or you
what can i do what can i contribute at a
time like this
and everyone has enough
if if everyone contributed what they
could
and came together the world would be
changed in a fortnight
yeah people have a lot of doubt um
they&#39;ll get to that
yes that&#39;s the first thing you have to
overcome you have to yeah because i i
had that too look i was raised in a
family where we were told we were
worthless you know
i i went home every day we couldn&#39;t go
to kindergarten only rich people could
afford kindergarten back then
but i went home every day of first grade
sent home crying i was told i could
never read i could never do anything
that that i was worthless so i started
solo
and had to kind of overcome that which i
think was
in the long run probably good for me it
was not easy
but i think that that&#39;s why people have
to look at themselves and go you know if
if a guy who came out of the background
i came out
can do what you know i became a doctor
who cares
you can do anything but you have to see
you can do it you have to believe in
yourself
and you have to not listen to the
naysayers
either your own inner voice that&#39;s
saying no or the external ones that
saying this isn&#39;t possible right
luckily by about fourth or fifth grade i
realized that i would have to just you
know take my own path and march to my
own drummer and i did
um
for better or for worse not always for
better you know sometimes for worse
because
i&#39;m a willful person and you know you
you know you can make mistakes but i
think that
ultimately you you have to
actualize and realize yourself
and i think the thing that gave me the
best grounding for that
first was my spirituality i think from
my native i&#39;m 5 16 cherokee native
american
connection to earth and my first great
love spiritually was earth
the gaia
and then when i had the near-death
experience i realized this cosmic
consciousness
and experience and realized that&#39;s what
we and who we really are we have this
infinite aspect of ourself as well as
our individual self and it&#39;s all woven
together
so when that happened i was 17 but i
think that everyone through meditation
can realize this aspect of themselves
because that&#39;s also how you
have uncommon courage
because
if you realize
that your individuality is a wave form
that is emerging from this infinite
ocean of conscious cell
but that that infinite ocean is you you
are that
being as well
then
and there is no death
so if someone threatens me i go well
make my day and kill me i&#39;m gonna you
know what i said to the head of army
intelligence
i said i&#39;ll be so much more trouble to
you on the other side
in the worlds of light than i will be on
this plane make my day and kill me i
literally said that
you know that&#39;s how i am
do you know me i mean i&#39;m saying these
things i mean it&#39;s outrageous i guess
but it&#39;s true everything i&#39;m telling you
was 100 true but
and he looked you&#39;re like oh my god you
know i said yeah
that&#39;s the way it is
but
i think that&#39;s how you develop courage
too because
courage is not folly courage is comes
from the french word heart
and it&#39;s the feeling and the love and
the consciousness of this higher
consciousness and spirituality and as
almost a divine level of love
not necessarily religious i mean
religiosity bothers me sometimes a lot
but but spirituality on a deep level and
that gives you
the courage to do the right thing
in the face of
tyranny i mean look at look at the
people who have who stood up like
vollenberg who stood up to adolf hitler
and and saved all those jewish children
um
look at what&#39;s going on with the heroes
in ukraine right now
uh look at look at the the people who
have done this throughout history
and and did uh
amazing
feats of courage
there is an aspect of them that they
could tap now all of us have to do that
not only to become ambassadors to these
extraterrestrial civilizations so that
they have a point of contact
and let me explain to you
and i never talk about this in a form
this big but time is getting short
if worse if some of these worst case
scenarios play out
and there is an intervention that&#39;s very
large
from this
cosmic organization
they&#39;re going to need people here
humans
to interface with
i doubt it&#39;s going to be at 1600
pennsylvania avenue or at the pentagon
it&#39;s going to be you
and whoever many hundreds of thousands
of people are going to see this
you need to own that responsibility
because what i&#39;ve learned from the ets
is that
when they had the betrayals and the
things that happened in the 40s and 50s
they have turned increasingly
to the masses the people in contact
that&#39;s why contact is happening
because they are everywhere everywhere
everywhere it&#39;s happening everywhere
it&#39;s happening everywhere and so if you
just make a little effort in that
direction you know get the ce5 contact
app
adapt it to your own needs and interests
i mean i have no
attachment to
it&#39;s the concepts and the intent that&#39;s
important
but that&#39;s a starting point it works
um
and then let&#39;s put yourself at service
to the universe put yourself at service
to humanity
um that&#39;s what i&#39;ve always tried to do
uh you know to the extent of my frailty
of being a human
and i think that that&#39;s what everyone
should aspire to do and actually then do
it
um you know it&#39;s time to get out of the
headspace and intellect and actually
get into the deeper heart and spirit of
this and act uh and for that we&#39;re going
to need another face and that says we&#39;re
i&#39;m seriously talking to some people
because i really think the big money
people and the governments and
corporations are not going to support
the change that we need i think we may
have to go to the root of
i don&#39;t know
a nft or a cryptocurrency or something
of course you know
as you know i can barely turn a computer
on so
i&#39;m a real idiot with stuff like that
but um
you know hey you know i was born in 55
we&#39;re not exactly the children of
digital age but um
we need help with that because i
actually think there&#39;s enough goodwill
out there
that we could do that and raise the
funds and then have the resources to
create these technologies
bypass the system and release them open
source open source means no patent no
intellectual property
blockchain boom out to the world
um because i think that that it&#39;s an
emergency now
uh and
you know when i first emerged on the
scene
i
said
to the people in in the white house and
others that
i&#39;m an emergency doctor and i can
identify an emergency that&#39;s em that&#39;s
about to happen
in an individual i sense there&#39;s an
emergency
situation on earth with the body of
humanity and the earth receptor the
biosphere
and i said so we have to act accordingly
we have to be skilled all of us skilled
physicians for gaia
and humanity
you want to be a medical doctor to do
that i mean but um
but you do need to have the will to do
it and recognize there&#39;s a problem and
that it is urgent
and emergent and of course i think with
watching
the great powers
posturing over ukraine
where on every news network they&#39;re
openly talking about the possibility of
armageddon with nuclear weapons i mean
this is the honestly
now
this i haven&#39;t said publicly
but this is the most dangerous situation
i have seen since i was ducking under my
desk
in second or third grade during the
cuban missile crisis
i lived through the cuban missile crisis
of 1963 and literally it was duck and
cover
you know they thought that you if you
hit under your desk you&#39;d be protected
from a thermonuclear bomb i mean go
figure how stupid
um but
that was what we were trained to do
because we were in the strike zone
from the russian missiles that were in
cuba the soviet missiles in cuba where i
lived in north carolina in charlotte and
which had a missile
factory and we were a
strike city
so we were literally being herded on the
school bus and practicing evacuations
and hiding under deaths
this that was a very dangerous situation
it was during kennedy&#39;s term
this situation
is approaching that level of danger and
we need everyone praying for peace
manifesting peace but then doing
practical steps working for peace
right and then
the the plan b
if
things get out of control and it&#39;s like
doc you know colonel
bearden who did all the work on these
energy devices and he said i have this
wonderful interview with him it&#39;s on our
youtube channel
he says now friends don&#39;t get me wrong
the fools may blow it yet he&#39;s from
louisiana
hilarious i love being at his home in
huntsville
near the redstone arsenal marshall space
flight center and
you know and he said i said yes and
that&#39;s why we need uh other plants you
know we we don&#39;t want to put all our
eggs in the basket
of the political leaders and these
geopolitical
uh superpowers
that the people need to come together in
consciousness and meditation and in
action
to start providing the solutions
right because i think this top-down
model
you know where we expect everything to
somehow percolate from on high and out
of washington or london or moscow never
going to happen that i i&#39;m
excuse me i think that&#39;s a fool&#39;s errand
if you you know i would not put the
future of the planet in those hands i&#39;ve
dealt with these people for too many
years
uh there are many good people in
government but the system is
rigged
to
stop anything
positive
really happening that would upset
the
power oligarchs the elites of the world
right um and and that&#39;s just
unfortunately the way it is but i do
think
large numbers of people acting together
and in unity that is going to be that&#39;s
a different story
right and that&#39;s how we that that&#39;s how
we did the civil rights movement i mean
i i lived through
uh you know the civil rights movement
the gay rights movement women&#39;s rights i
mean i was born in 55.
and and uh you know i shared this story
on demi lovato&#39;s podcast i mean i had a
black girlfriend
in high school
and was hit and tried to be killed by a
car by a bunch of racists because i had
a black girlfriend that&#39;s how dangerous
having a black girlfriend was in 1972 in
1973 in north carolina
but
i think that you know
these big changes that happen
that change did not happen
from washington down it happened in
on the grassroots
non-violent
civil disobedience non-violent action
i&#39;m not in favor of anything rioting
burning looting none of that
not we can do it gandhi overthrew the
entire british empire
and liberated india
non-violently
so
we can do this
and i think
i do think a lot of people are getting
literally there&#39;s a lot of contact
people are getting a lot of messages
yes and and they&#39;re they&#39;re speaking out
and saying okay i&#39;m getting this
constant message and what do i do with
this and
i&#39;m saying ask ask what to do with it
and keep your eyes and ears open and the
path will unfold in front of you all you
need to do
is step onto it
and move forward but i think it&#39;s people
are getting messages because you and i
have talked about this
there are so many
of these beings
who are watching this and who are
interacting and who are taking an active
look at all of this and they&#39;re they&#39;re
helping they&#39;re reaching out to help
people
and guide people who are want to help
yeah on many dimensions it&#39;s not just
extraterrestrial it&#39;s spiritual beings
it&#39;s in many many levels
um and our ancestors and
i&#39;ll step way out on a limb here are
our descendants
our descendants yes
our descendants from half a million
years in the future are also helping us
yes that&#39;ll blow people&#39;s mind but i
know that to be a fact
um so
so in here we sit right in 2022. so it&#39;s
a beautiful thing and you know i want to
mention this this film again
just for clarity it&#39;s not
my film i didn&#39;t produce it um
the cousin brothers wanted to interview
me and uh have me sort of present the
information uh michael schrad sent it
jim goodall who&#39;s very famous aerospace
illustrator is in it i met him
there was a one yeah he was at the 20th
anniversary of our uh disclosure project
um he was the last man uh one of the
last people to talk to the
lockheed skunk works uh ben rich
um and
so and it&#39;s good it&#39;s focuses really on
these technologies and the existence of
them and the covert programs
i think it&#39;s very timely but we need to
connect it
and we can actually take a pause if you
want to see the trailer
trailer so
let&#39;s take a quick look at that
okay
if the crash retrievals are true
then all bets are off
it&#39;s very hard for people to get their
minds around where the real power is
and it&#39;s not at 1600 pennsylvania avenue
the reality is something much more stark
they&#39;ve been working on this for 60 70
perhaps 80 years
the reason why the government is talking
about these ufos now they&#39;re getting
ready for the next level of war are
these objects a national security
concern
they&#39;re proffering a narrative of a
national security threat that doesn&#39;t
exist
i call them alien reproduction vehicles
they&#39;re made by private corporations
somewhere on this planet technology from
roswell from 1947
has largely been held back from us
portal technology teleportation whatever
you can imagine it&#39;s already been done
the biggest secrets are not the zero
point energy and electrogravitics
it&#39;s the science of consciousness all
their communication systems are moving
through the consciousness field and are
thought actuated the people of the cia
call it wsfm weird science and freaking
magic
the trans-dimensional interstellar
technology
will benefit humanity
that has been tremendous disinformation
the media is keeping secrets with the
government
these are lethal vicious people and i&#39;m
focused on exposing the extraordinary
technologies that they want to keep
secret no aspect of life on earth will
be unaffected by it
now can you talk a little bit about your
your i interrupted you there you were
connecting something now that we&#39;ve
watched the trailer uh say a few words
about what you hope that people will
take away from us
look at all of that and look at i know
because there&#39;s a lot of jargon and a
lot of physics and a lot of evidence
just look at all of it as an alternative
energy and propulsion system to replace
everything that&#39;s destroying the world
everything that&#39;s caused these
geopolitical imbalances with oil and
petrol states
look at it as a huge collection of
solutions
that have been sitting around for 100
years on black shelves and covert
programs that need to be liberated they
need to be brought out and brought to
bear to benefit humanity but only to be
used for peaceful purposes
the you know i always warned the people
every technology is a double-edged sword
you can use it for good or for harm
you can take
uh
a knife and put butter on your bread or
you can slit someone&#39;s throat
unfortunately i&#39;ve unfortunately have
seen both so um no matter how primitive
the technology or how advanced
what is critical
is the consciousness that wields it the
wisdom
the behind its use right and so as you
look at those technologies
you also have to understand as einstein
said no problem has been solved by the
level of consciousness that created it
the creation of the the consciousness of
conquest
of domination
of aggression of war of militarism
that&#39;s got to go away and then all these
technologies
all of them including the ones that fly
can come out and be used peacefully if
we&#39;re not in a consciousness of peace
and we don&#39;t evolve to that
any of these technologies can also be
used as a fierce
weapon system so that again gets into
this sort of existential crisis and
decision
the choice i got the choice the big
choice
humanity is facing do we choose
annihilation do we choose enlightenment
peace
universal peace on earth and in space
and then become a people that travel
amongst the stars
that&#39;s the choice
and that&#39;s how clearly we need to
articulate it to our fellow brothers and
sisters on earth right
and that would be the choice i would
make
it&#39;s the choice we&#39;re all wanting to
make but we have to actually take action
and do it so
well thank you pat i know it&#39;s getting
late
we appreciate you weighing in on all
this and explaining and your unique uh
viewpoint for this um yes you&#39;re welcome
thank you and never nev everyone never
give up hope just work and keep your
keep your vision on that horizon of this
transition the transformation to this
good future that&#39;s how i get up every
day and how i keep going don&#39;t get
bogged down there are a lot of things
that are frightening and negative but
stay connected to your inner higher self
and keep your vision on that horizon of
transformation enlightenment not only
for yourselves but for the planet that&#39;s
what you need to focus on and that get
overwhelmed with the negativity
great
thank you again thank you thank you good
night good night
