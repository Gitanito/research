Suddenly, I was aware of myself and I was getting up from the surgery table.  As I was rising, I found myself hovering upward and I turned only to see myself lying on the surgery table. There was copious bleeding on the floor and a rush of nurses and physicians around my body on the table. I could see everything from above. I felt nothing, no emotions or thoughts. I was moving in the air endowed with the conscience of BEING. Later, I awoke in a bed and I was receiving a blood transfusion. The doctor said that during my intervention a hemorrhage, which they could not stop, took them by surprise. That was why I was under intravenous treatment now. They were transferring several liters of blood into my body.  I told the doctor that I knew it because I had seen it all. He stood puzzled, for he said, while in surgery, I was under total anesthesia.
