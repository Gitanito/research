see how you said hey good morning good
morning thank you so much joining us
today we were just so incredibly excited
to have you here and I know that there&#39;s
a lot of questions I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve been
asking them to get ready you&#39;re getting
a lot of welcomes and I think that if
you wanted to just kind of start off and
tell us a little bit about you and about
working with dr. Greer making the
amazing films that you have that might
be a good place to start
yeah of course hello everybody and thank
you Laurie Michael for setting this up
it was an absolute honor to to get to be
part of this movie and unacknowledged
you know most people come into this
field because they had some sort of
incredible sighting or paranormal
experience or near-death experience or
something like that I I didn&#39;t have
anything like that I was I was actually
a die-hard skeptic for a really long
time and you know I loved arguing with
people and you know proving that I was
right about everything and then you know
I started looking at arguments against
my position and my the moment I did that
my position collapsed and I realized
that you know I had to take
responsibility for this information and
and do something about it and the only
thing I know how to do is is tell
stories and make movies and so you know
I got involved with dr. Greer it started
with you know I was a donor to the film
serious and got to go to the premiere
and you know started meeting folks in
the space and one thing led to another
and you know all of a sudden I mean I&#39;m
in DC and in dr. Brewers
basement going through CIA documents and
you know and it&#39;s been an incredible
transformational journey and you know
I&#39;m excited to answer whatever questions
people have so let&#39;s jump into it
all right who&#39;s first we&#39;ve got one
that&#39;s typed out in the chat so we&#39;ll go
with that one the first question what
does Michael think happen to david icke
fleet the question was what do i think
happened to David Icke of late yep you
don&#39;t have an opinion by that we&#39;ll just
can move on well I assume you&#39;re talking
about him getting D platform by YouTube
and and Facebook I mean
you know I I wasn&#39;t following it too
closely but it seems pretty obvious to
me that you know as soon as you censor
something it makes it a lot more
attractive to people so I think
ultimately you know they&#39;re they&#39;re just
pre you know the powers that be are just
creating an underdog and basic human
psychology to to sort of root for the
underdog and it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s just going
to draw a lot of attention to to what
he&#39;s talking about the same thing
happened with planned emic which is a
documentary that&#39;s going viral right now
so but I don&#39;t know too much about
what&#39;s going on with David unfortunately
I haven&#39;t followed it too closely
alright does someone have a question
they want to ask
there are some more in the show
okay then I&#39;ll go ahead and read the
next one here from California asks do
you think it is an advantage not to has
many personal et experiences this
ability to see the big picture this is
the part it&#39;s library now so this is the
part I hate when somebody gets on there
and they give you this much of all of
that evil things their boyfriend ditch
them and you tell them you know this
person is gonna hurt you I&#39;m sorry sorry
about that we got them you did there is
some some side chat happening there that
question from Steve yeah please restate
the question okay it&#39;s an advantage not
to have many personal et experiences
does it assist your ability to see the
big picture I think the most important
thing when you&#39;re when you&#39;re starting
this kind of practice any kind of
meditative or spiritual practice is to
not compare yourself to other people you
know if you know these sorts of beliefs
and expectations about how the
experience is supposed to be is going to
really hinder you from having the full
experience and going going deeper into
the experience you really want to try to
keep at bay those kinds of judgments and
expectations and beliefs about how it&#39;s
supposed to be and the more you&#39;re able
to do that and just be open to whatever
comes the deeper you&#39;re going to go and
the more profound your experience is
going to be
thank you very much for that what would
be the likelihood of dr. Greer sharing
his opinion regarding Plan demmick
that&#39;s from Phil
the likelihood of dr. Greer sharing his
opinion on planned emic all I&#39;ll ask him
I mean I can&#39;t speak for him obviously
but you know if you&#39;ve been paying
attention to some of his recent you know
YouTube live broadcasts you you you
probably figure out that there are some
common ground between what he&#39;s been
saying and what&#39;s in that film and I
really enjoyed planned emic and I think
it&#39;s worth I think it&#39;s worth watching
but I will certainly ask dr. Greer if
he&#39;s willing to you know chime in on
that conversation because I know that
that has sort of taken over the internet
right now which is cut which is kind of
cool I will say this everybody you know
as terrifying as this whole situation is
you know with this massive power grab
that we&#39;re witnessing this the situation
is backfiring to a certain extent on the
powers that be because so many people
are getting red pills during this
pandemic I mean even even my my mom and
dad have been sending me you know they
sent me Plan Demick you know my mom
called me and said oh yeah I have to
show you this thing that you know the
Rockefeller was published in 2010 and
they predicted the whole thing and it&#39;s
you know people who are typically like
my parents very irritated by
quote-unquote conspiracy theories and
dismissive are now you know really
jumping into the conversation and waking
up so it&#39;s it&#39;s really becoming this
crisis has become an opportunity for a
lot of people to to kind of transform
their worldview so we can be grateful
for that
I think thankful that one more question
here now this is from John he couldn&#39;t
make it today he&#39;s really bummed out but
his question was for you Michael and
what what is the best way to get into
the official training program you know
there&#39;s a playlist on YouTube is it
going live to a cec-5 event what would
you recommend the official ce-5 training
program yeah when it in your opinion
what is the what is the best way to get
the the most concise type of ce-5
training according to dr. Greer&#39;s
protocols they have data that is a
really really good question well apart
from apart from going on a training
which I know is prohibitively expensive
for a lot of people I would I would
suggest grabbing the AK it&#39;s kind of
like your own cg5 starter kit I know
that dr. Greer has mentioned to me you
know he&#39;s flirting with the idea of
creating some kind of you know teacher
training program in the future but you
know the way that he has set up this
this organization is deliberately very
decentralized he&#39;s seen firsthand how
you know having this you know superconn
centralized control and standardization
of everything can become really
bureaucratic and lose the you know the
original spirit of the organization
especially after you know the founder
dies you know if you were to pass away
it could become very sort of like
cult-like and you know we&#39;ve seen this
with other organizations that I won&#39;t
mention so you know he wants to avoid
that as much as possible you know
when I&#39;m talking to people about cg5 I
always tell people you know learn
learn dr. Brewers technique because we
know it works
but then you know adapted and
personalize it for what for what works
for you you&#39;re gonna find your own style
and don&#39;t feel like you know oh you&#39;re
not doing exactly as dr. Greer taught
it&#39;s not it&#39;s not the right thing you&#39;ll
know if you&#39;re doing it right if you&#39;re
achieving these transcendent states of
consciousness or if you are you know
obviously making contact you&#39;re doing it
right and you&#39;ve got to just you know
trust yourself and I know the last thing
dr. Greer wants is for you know is for
people to sort of rely too heavily on
him as the ultimate authority on this
you know this is DC this organization is
decentralized for a reason
well said
but for you did you feel like there was
in one particular event piece of
information or experience or was it a
series of them that made you go from an
ardent skeptic to an open-minded or to
be more open-minded in general yeah
that&#39;s a good question
so when I was when I was first
confronted with all these wild claims of
not just the et reality but the science
of consciousness the reality of psychic
phenomenon near-death experiences the
the existence of human spirit you know I
was very very resistant to all of this
and I had friends who were also diehard
skeptics and atheists and they would say
I wish I could believe but I just can&#39;t
you know there&#39;s not enough evidence and
I would say to them why do you want to
believe why would you want any of this
to be true I I didn&#39;t get why anyone
would even want this to be true I was
very very happy with like my materialist
reductionist view of reality we live in
a cold impersonal mechanical universe
and that might have been depressing to
my fellow skeptics but I thought it was
great and I didn&#39;t want the stuff to be
real it was so it was it wasn&#39;t one
thing or one experience to change my
mind it was me you know sort of
confronting the entire you know wealth
of research and evidence and you know
trying to debunk it and and having to
accept that I couldn&#39;t and then I had to
ask myself once I accepted that I was
completely wrong I had to ask myself
well why was I so resistant to this why
was I so biased against this being true
and the answer the best answer I could
come up with is you know this stuff is
true you know you have to take
responsibility for the information you
have to take responsibility for the
thoughts you&#39;re putting out into the
universe you
take responsibility for your unhappiness
yo you&#39;re no longer you know just a
victim of circumstance and a cold
impersonal universe but you&#39;re you know
co-creator of every moment and I think
that this community seriously
underestimates that you know the you
know how terrifying that can be to
non-believers we think we tend to think
that this is an argument that&#39;s going to
be won on the strength of the evidence
and if we keep just presenting the data
and the evidence then we&#39;re gonna win
people over and and you know I believe
that if this was really about evidence
and data the debate would have been over
decades ago we would have won it instead
I think that this is really about
personal resistance of people not being
able to confront the implications of
this and the amount of responsibility
that people have to take if this stuff
is real and so we should have empathy
for people and not beat them over the
head with facts and tell them that
they&#39;re stupid maybe you&#39;re trying to
recognize if that&#39;s really where the
resistance is coming from and then be an
example to those people that you know
this is actually a very beautiful way of
living you can be very happy and joyful
you know accepting this responsibility
and you know I don&#39;t hear a lot of
people talking about this so I bring it
up in every interview that I do
because I think it&#39;s a William it was a
it was a really big insight into my own
resistance and I have a feeling that
this is what&#39;s going on for a lot of
so-called skeptics
I have have a question as well if that&#39;s
okay yeah yeah I know you mentioned that
you know dr. Steven gray doesn&#39;t want to
you know be there you know let&#39;s say
they&#39;re the one and all teacher of c-5
and stuff like that he doesn&#39;t want it
centralized however what&#39;s being put
into place to prevent other entities and
organization taking the c-5 name and
protocols and actually creating sort of
a centralized point by themselves and
it&#39;ll be like what&#39;s happened with
Transcendental Meditation and stuff like
that you know it&#39;s definitely it&#39;s
definitely a fine line and see study is
is not my organization it&#39;s it&#39;s Steve&#39;s
organization i-i-i don&#39;t really know the
answer to that i I think it&#39;s it&#39;s just
his goal at least what he has said to me
is she just wants to get enough
individuals and groups doing this where
and this is quoting him he says you know
where I could drop dead tomorrow and
they&#39;re all going to continue this work
and yeah some people are gonna form
organizations and they&#39;re gonna turn
into you know cults or whatever but you
know but we&#39;re hoping that most people
are going to just keep it you know loose
and decentralized and just it&#39;s all
about the experience the community and
and you know we&#39;re trying to reach that
kind of threshold you know because you
know you know if anything is a threat to
this kind of stuff it&#39;s some kind of
terrible bureaucracy that would form
around this and we don&#39;t want that we
want people to be just completely free
to experience this
hey thank you yeah of course um I I
didn&#39;t have a better answer no it&#39;s okay
it&#39;s Simon Caillou was worried about
capitalism Norman against that teeth
into new stuff like this so it&#39;s only a
matter of time well you know what when
you see those kinds of organizations
popping up it means that dr. Greer has
like really you know hit a certain
milestone to rip them off so it you know
there&#39;s different ways of looking at it
it&#39;s like okay we got big enough that
now we&#39;re being imitated and people are
trying to monetize it so I&#39;m sorry I
don&#39;t have a better answer for you
that&#39;s you know these questions I don&#39;t
have good answers too I will ask Steve
and if we end up doing with discord ask
me this stuff again I will have an
answer for you
yeah Michael um have you uh attempted c5
or are you just happy knowing that you
know listen ah that&#39;s a really really
good question I have done cg5 I am I&#39;m
very I was very late to the cg5 party I
didn&#39;t try ce-5 until after
unacknowledged came out and my first cg5
was actually in Los Angeles with Jim
Martin who&#39;s the producer of both of
those films and he&#39;s actually in ce-5
he&#39;s the one who shot that he shot a lot
of really good footage in the movie but
the one you might remember is he&#39;s
following the craft as it flies up into
the clouds and he says please don&#39;t go
away and it just stops dead and then
comes back down so that&#39;s that&#39;s Jim so
he you know he does ce-5 in his backyard
in Long Beach and shoots the most
amazing stuff and so and he&#39;s got a
really cool community here in LA so I
started I started doing it with them and
it was absolutely amazing life-changing
transformational experience and so yeah
I do it on a regular basis and I&#39;m
always looking for new people to do it
with so if you got if any of you were in
LA hit me up on Twitter and you know
let&#39;s set it played it thank you
as a director can you tell us what your
favorite process is throughout making a
movie
absolutely it&#39;s it&#39;s definitely in the
editing room documentaries are in my
opinion directed in the in the editing
room and that&#39;s where you know I can
just you know I don&#39;t have to deal with
managing you know crews and you know all
kinds of craziness and stress you know
from production I can just you know sit
alone in a dark room and and try to try
to put the puzzle piece together and I
feel like that&#39;s where the creativity
really really starts on a documentary
awesome does anyone in the chat have any
questions for Michael
you
alright here&#39;s another one mr. Missoula
when did you when did you meet dr. Greer
did you say it was after you were you
were a donor for one of the movies is
that correct yeah yeah I met him I met
him very very briefly at the serious
premiere but my first like real you know
deep dive with him was when you know I
went out to meet him in I think it was
December of 2015 and we were discussing
his vision for unacknowledged and it was
I remember the meeting very well because
while you know we agreed that
unacknowledged was the right movie for
that moment in time he was very clear
that the movie he always dreamt of
making was Close Encounters of the fifth
kind and he saw unacknowledged as the
necessary stepping-stone to kind of
prepare people for the real you know the
real crazy stuff in Close Encounters so
you know we deliberately you know left
all of the contact stuff out of
unacknowledged so we knew it was just
going to be way too much for average
people to handle that movies like
disclosure potty-training
and then you know ce-5 is is where the
will the real fun begins
very cool can are you able to discuss
any future projects that you and dr.
Greer may be working on I wish I will
say that we are kicking around ideas and
some of them are more developed than
others and we&#39;re you know the the
success of this film thanks to all of
you guys is opening up new opportunities
you know it&#39;s
it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of it&#39;s kind of new
territory it&#39;s kind of surreal to see a
movie about you know telepathically
communicating with extraterrestrials you
know be trending on these on these you
know big platforms and it shows that
we&#39;re really we&#39;re really starting to
penetrate the the mainstream and it was
you know it&#39;s really hard to kind of you
know to kind of you know get there
because typically these kinds of movies
they just they kind of live on YouTube
or Vimeo and you know we really wanted
to show these big companies that you
know there is an interest in this there
is an audience for this and you know
they should allow people to make this
kind of content so we are we are working
on some stuff but I can&#39;t talk about it
but you might see a press release within
the next you know three to six month
other than the work that you&#39;ve been
doing with Steven Greer and the movies
you&#39;ve worked on what other sort of
pieces of work would you say you&#39;re most
proud of
ah there&#39;s a guy named Adam Michael
Curry who was in series and in Close
Encounters of the fifth kind he&#39;s you
know the inventor entrepreneur scientist
who worked at the prison parrot lab I
met him at the serious after party and I
quit my job in Hollywood to co-found a
quantum physics R&amp;D company with him
which is still running in in Orange
County so we&#39;re working on developing
you know stuff like apps and hardware
that you can you know that responds to
your subconscious mind you know when he
was you know at the Princeton para lab
he actually built this lamp called the
mind lamp or you could think of a color
it comes that collar we&#39;re doing way
more advanced than that now just to sort
of show people the power of their mind
so that&#39;s something I&#39;ve been working on
for and you know I I develop other other
film and TV projects there in various
levels of development and hopefully I&#39;ll
get to share those with the world pretty
soon
a couple people in chata would have
combined some questions here Michael
they have a close sprint or a relative
family member that it&#39;s afraid to try c5
what would you what would you say to
somebody to try to work their mind and
and help with those alleviate those
fears yeah I mean that&#39;s a really really
good question it&#39;s definitely not
something you want to go into feeling
scared or nervous what and a lot of
people feel that way you&#39;re not you&#39;re
not alone um it&#39;s it&#39;s not uncommon so I
would what I typically do is I refer
people to the ce-5 Facebook group so to
get some sort of social validation from
other people who&#39;ve been doing it for a
long time to see the kinds of beautiful
experiences that that they&#39;ve had and I
also like to remind people that you know
people most people start doing ce-5
because they want to see an alien
because that would be so cool but the
reason they stick around and do it for
thirty years and it kind of becomes
their life is because of the
transcendence states of consciousness
that they experience and the sort of
spiritual transformation that takes
place and it is just uniformly described
as you know beautiful loving you know
just absolutely wonderful way of being
in the world and experiencing life and
so you know I would just remind them
that it&#39;s not just about contacting an
entity and but also just refer them to
the people who&#39;ve been doing it for a
long time I&#39;m sorry that&#39;s the best
answer I have I get that a lot and
that&#39;s you know that&#39;s how I deal with
it
and you going to in chair have a
question for Michael
hey there&#39;s another one from from
earlier what&#39;s your opinion Michael on
the rule of the space horse and it
starting up in the last few years and
well we&#39;ll just start with that what
you&#39;re saying about the space force yeah
a great question for me this is a way
for them to finally declassify
infrastructure that&#39;s been in place for
a very very long time but they can&#39;t say
hey look you know we&#39;ve we&#39;ve had a
space force or whatever they call it you
know we&#39;ve had this you know for 30
years you know sorry we lied about it
they&#39;re gonna act like they&#39;re just
creating it just like you know Elon Musk
saying you know we&#39;re gonna build a
facility on Mars within you know a few
years you know they can&#39;t tell you you
know we hey we&#39;ve had structures there
since the 80s or whatever it&#39;s been you
know this is a way of revealing
infrastructure that&#39;s been in place for
a very very long time and what we just
have to be very wary of and it&#39;s why in
these films you know we&#39;re always
reminding people about the worst
possible outcome of the fake disclosure
narrative which would you know which is
you know this this fake ET threat is you
know that is that&#39;s still a very strong
possibility with how these could you
know unfold with the controlled
disclosure that we&#39;re seeing and we just
have to look for the signs and be aware
of it and you know if it ramps up we
have to be able to we have to have
enough people who are informed about
this that we can kind of hold the space
for people who are freaking out and so
yeah there&#39;s my answer
very good and how&#39;s the hell is close
encounters of the fifth time doing so
far in terms of competition against
other documentaries rental sales I don&#39;t
know what the sales figures are I don&#39;t
have access to that but I&#39;ve been
tracking
I&#39;ve been tracking see five on you know
iTunes charts and until I think two days
ago we were we were like number one
we&#39;re number one documentary for almost
four weeks just crazy because you know
for for like half of that time you know
I think the movie was was you know like
at almost twenty dollars competing with
$0.99 rentals you know I know that in a
perfect world this would just be put out
for free and eventually this is going to
be available on platforms where people
you know we have a subscription or there
be other ways of watching it do I just
want to say if I see so many comments
and questions all the time about you
know why is it it free so I say nobody
no one&#39;s getting rich off of this movie
you know we if we want to be able to
reach the people who need to see this
you know average people who aren&#39;t
visiting doctor careers YouTube page on
a regular basis you know we have to be
on the platforms where average people
discover content and in order to be on
those platforms it has to be a
commercial endeavor and we have to show
these companies hey you can make money
with this kind of content and but all of
it is reinvested into marketing and
outreach and education nobody&#39;s getting
rich off of this we really really really
really appreciate everyone who has
supported the film by buying it or
renting it thank you because that allows
us to just reach so many more people
well said I mean if you could if you
could make it if you could direct a film
for free I&#39;m sure you would but
unfortunately none of us are in that
position of most of us here yeah I mean
I wish right but you know it&#39;s like it&#39;s
it you know the most of this money is
going to the platform to toast it on and
it&#39;s going to distributors it&#39;s going to
marketing people and so if there&#39;s
anything left it goes into education and
outreach through see savvy that&#39;s it you
know so we really really appreciate it
and just know that you know it&#39;s it&#39;s
going to a good use it&#39;s allowing us to
stay on these platforms and it&#39;s really
really important because that&#39;s where
most people are discovering contact
and the people that donate the films are
essentially like the corporate funders
in the major motion picture so what you
do is absolutely instrumental and the
same for people to purchase the movie
not only are you supporting their that
work and research but you also do get to
own the movie and you have bonus
features that people that are going to
rent the film or eventually see it on
Netflix don&#39;t get to enjoy this
kuroh absolutely yes
hundred percent
if you could make if you had an
unlimited budget what would be the next
movie that you would direct what type
would it be uh it would have to be it
would have to be the Daniel Sheehan
story you know Danny was an
unacknowledged and in close encounters
he&#39;s constitutional attorney
you know we blew through his background
so fast because we blew everything so
quickly in the movie because there&#39;s
just too much stuff to try to cram into
two hours but you know Danny was the he
represented the New York Times during
pentagon papers he uncovered a Ron
contra he represents the tribes at
Standing Rock a man an absolutely
amazing i if you have Amazon Prime
account you can read his memoir for free
on Kindle it&#39;s called the people&#39;s
advocate it is probably the best book I
have ever read it is incredible so check
that out his story needs to be told to
and you know he was an original
disclosure project witness he was the
attorney for the disclosure project but
you he also you know he he was asked by
the Carter Administration to try to get
him access to the UFO files because you
know Jimmy Carter had seen a UFO and so
when he became president the first thing
he said was hey I want to see you know
the UFO FILES
and his CIA director you know George
Bush senior&#39;s you know she said you know
we&#39;re not gonna show that to you and you
know so he had to find a way to go
around it so it ended up falling on
Danny she hands shoulders to try to get
in there so and he did and so he became
a witness and as well as the attorney
for the disclosure project he&#39;s an
amazing guy so I I strongly recommend
you all go check him out incredible
incredible story about the secret
history of the United States
and say personally that Danny she ends
one of the coolest guys I&#39;ve met one of
the nicest people
oh absolutely
you
anyone anyone in the chat have a
question for Michael I&#39;ve kind of been
dominating it yeah go on please hey um
we mentioned that the the secret space
force and all that stuff about how
they&#39;ve been you know pushing it off and
then saying hey you know we&#39;re gonna
create this I got a question about that
Ruby oh so if if
if the government&#39;s have been you know
up there doing things and created
technology and use it up there for a
while and they claim to be mornings in
space the question comes to my Anders
is our technology gonna be harmful for
the entities that that this group is
trying to you know come into contact
with and are they trying to bully their
way through you know and just basically
you know keep us from even knowing more
and more so it was breaking up a little
bit so the question is are in our
infrastructure and space our you know
our whole weapons infrastructure is that
a is that a threat to the entities who
were trying to contact receive five that
was the question pretty much yeah
yeah that&#39;s a really really good
question and the answer is absolutely
it&#39;s a threat that is why they will
appear when it is safe for them to do so
and that&#39;s what a lot of the time also
you know they&#39;ll only materialize for a
second or two and then blink out of our
dimension they&#39;re not going to put
themselves in danger and you don&#39;t need
to feel like you&#39;re putting anybody in
danger or that you yourself are ending
because you&#39;re not they will appear when
it is safe or actually if it is safe for
them and for you so you don&#39;t have to
worry about that they worry about that
just to sort of touch upon what you&#39;ve
said I run a small circle with a group
of friends here in the southwest of
England and I was actually out last
night on the moors and there was some
cool stuff happening lots of flashes but
something that I experienced was kind of
like a kind of look like a satellite
moving at a constant pace but then you
had this like slow power it was like a
pulse and then slowly kind of faded out
then disappeared is there anything in in
in space that could sort of explain that
other than contact uh off the top of my
head no there she what you described the
way I imagined it sounds very similar to
some genuine contact footage that I&#39;ve
seen but you know if you have hmm trying
to think of where I can send you to show
you some similar videos it kind of it
kind of actually sounds like what Logan
Paul just witnessed over his mouth a
couple weeks ago you can find that on
his to page I think it was sort of
pulsing and moving across the sky and
then they just sort of faded out I got
really light and then it disappeared you
know if you can you know I would look
through some of the footage that dr.
Greer is released and and see if you
could find something comparable because
what you described sounds like it could
be contact I can&#39;t easily dismiss it
yeah fine okay
you
hey Michael what drew you to dr. Greer
specifically when you when you did
become a believer
right so I discovered the disclosure
project witness testimony on YouTube
before I knew who dr. Pierre was and
that&#39;s what really woke me up when I was
you know starting to do this research
then I saw his I saw you know some of
his lectures on YouTube but the one that
blew my mind was his three and a half
hour expose of the national security
state he did in early 2015
you know I have been a fan of his
already I donated a serious at that
point but I didn&#39;t realize just how deep
this went and how brilliant he was until
I saw that that expose of the national
security state in 2015 that&#39;s when I saw
that I said this needs to be a movie and
I heard that he was looking for someone
to kind of adapt that presentation into
a film and that actually was the basis
fraud acknowledged was that three and a
half hour PowerPoint presentation that
he did so for me that was it&#39;s one of
the best UFO videos on the on the web
and you know dr. gray is probably the
most misunderstood person in you know in
all of you apology but he truly he truly
is a brilliant and and sincere guy who
has you know who has made a lot of
sacrifices to bring us all this
information and you know I&#39;m very
grateful to him
take someone with extreme mental
toughness to endure what he&#39;s done
throughout his research when you think
about 20-plus years of of this correct
jumping movies but someone asked it in
chat and I thought it was a pretty good
wish have you met James Fox and what do
you think of his upcoming movie
phenomenon ok so I haven&#39;t met James Fox
in person but I can&#39;t wait to meet him
because he is incredible out of the blue
and I know what I saw are my favorite
UFO documentaries knows the ones that I
send to the skeptics I don&#39;t send them
on a knowledge I showed them
unacknowledged after they&#39;ve seen James
Fox&#39;s movies and I have seen an advanced
screening of the phenomenon and I gotta
tell you this is the movie that
at least I have been waiting for that
you can absolutely put in front of the
most close minded person and they cannot
deny it anymore
it is beautiful it is the guy is
absolutely brilliant and I&#39;m such a huge
fan of his you guys had a love the
phenomenon it is gonna be the ultimate
evangelism tool and it&#39;s just so
beautifully made the man is such an
artist he takes a really long time
making movies I wish I had I wish I had
that luxury when I found out how well he
was working on the phenomena like oh my
god but yeah he&#39;s awesome and I can&#39;t
wait to be
when you started describing the movie
the hair started standing up on my arms
because I&#39;ve been lucky enough to see a
screener as well and it it&#39;s a
mind-blower it&#39;s it&#39;s for the for the
for the skeptics for people that maybe
have just dabbled in this from sound
bites on the news it&#39;s going to is going
to open some eyes for sure
yeah the phenomenon is the greatest UFO
documentary ever made you know I&#39;m gonna
have to retire from making these kinds
of movies because I&#39;ll never make
anything as good as the phenomenon it&#39;s
so fantastic you are all going to love
it the number one documentary director
of the summer yeah yeah but it&#39;s true
it&#39;s true it&#39;s it is it&#39;s just it is a
film that&#39;s going to make this community
so proud
because we get a lot of ridicule we get
a lot of eye rolling we get a lot of
nastiness and shade thrown our way and I
think this film is going to do a lot to
curb that permanently so just my opinion
because I long did you work in Hollywood
for
Oh Oh God uh so let&#39;s see I I went to
film school in New York I came back here
in 2011 I was working in script
development and in documentaries and for
feature films then I kind of got
disillusioned went off and I started the
the consciousness quantum physics
company Adam my attorney was still you
know developing scripts and stuff like
that but kind of doing it part-time then
I jumped into um acknowledged and and
now film is like my all-time thing I
reason I ask is I&#39;m just wondering if
you familiar with some of the sort of
bigger theories going around about
Hollywood regarding sort of child
trafficking and adrenochrome stuff and I
was just wondering if you at all
familiar with those and I don&#39;t know
about I I don&#39;t know if the adrenochrome
stuff is true yeah I can&#39;t verify that I
can say there are absolutely powerful
pedophiles in Hollywood and I think that
me to the me to movement was was an
effort to and I&#39;m not saying didn&#39;t the
good things didn&#39;t compliment a lot of
great things have come from me too and
it has the beginning of an awakening but
I think an attempt to push it into a
narrow Bock to make it about powerful
men abusing powerless women he when the
truth is it&#39;s really more about powerful
men abusing powerless women men and
children yes exactly so I think that me
to need the conversation needs to be
expanded and I can&#39;t elaborate
beyond that but yet there&#39;s definitely
some really ugly stuff I&#39;ve I&#39;ve hung
out with enough enough Hollywood
veterans you know and you know you get a
little drunk and they tell you where
some of the skeletons are buried and
it&#39;s you know a lot of that stuff is
very very real what&#39;s also surprising is
that there&#39;s a lot of people in
Hollywood who are also waking up to this
and they&#39;re horrified you know I have
been in the industry who were sending me
out of shadows yeah and and so it&#39;s not
like everyone in Hollywood is part of
this evil you know monolithic group and
everyone&#39;s part of the agenda the truth
is you know to have a conspiracy you
really only need you don&#39;t need them
everyone to be on the same page no you
just need key people to be on the same
page and you know a lot of people in
Hollywood are waking up they&#39;re
disgusted by this kind of stuff and
they&#39;re not afraid to talk about it
no we&#39;re living through a big awakening
here
oh I really appreciate you answering
that question answer
Mike well how do you feel the success of
the current movie Close Encounters and
the fifth kind is going compared to
unacknowledged Wow
here&#39;s the depends on how you measure
success right I mean I I look at all of
the torrents the torrent downloads for
unacknowledged that reach 650 million
across something like you know 600
different websites and I say and for me
I&#39;m like yeah that&#39;s you know that is
that he could count the piracy it&#39;s the
most-watched documentary in history you
know in my mind that&#39;s a success right
now I am told by our distributor that
Close Encounters is on track to do as
well as unacknowledged ed in terms of
you know sales and stuff like that and I
know I can&#39;t say too much but I know
that there are some some big entities
that are paying attention and they&#39;re
very very interested in what we&#39;re doing
with CD 5 and there&#39;s going to be more
opportunities for this kind of content
that&#39;s all I can say so I think we&#39;re I
think we&#39;re I&#39;m really surprised because
unacknowledged was the movie you could
put in front of your mom or your your
friend and and read kill them really
quick you know I thought that this movie
was just gonna be way too obscure that
you know this is really just gonna find
a very niche audience but so far we&#39;re
actually finding a really decent sized
audience and I&#39;m very excited about that
I think I really underestimated how
ready people are to confront this kind
of stuff and so it&#39;s very very exciting
to see
do you think that free energy is going
to be available to the human race in our
lifetimes Michael
um I believe so yes I unfortunately I
can&#39;t elaborate on it but there
there are there are people put it this
way there are devices out there and
which we know because you know people
there are people who create this but
then they get shut down right but there
are devices out there now and there are
people trying to bring it out who are
approaching it in the correct way where
they&#39;re not doing it as a you know a
commercial endeavor well they&#39;re gonna
patent it they&#39;re gonna make trillions
of dollars and all this stuff they&#39;re
really approaching it from the right
level of consciousness and I&#39;m really
really really rooting for them in a big
way I think it I think we&#39;re absolutely
going to see it in our lifetime just the
you know dr. Greer says the
civilizations level of technology
matches their level of consciousness and
I love that mine and I use it all the
time it is so true so just with the
awakening that we&#39;re seeing in the last
two months with this pandemic I think
that you know if we follow the this
trend continues we&#39;re gonna get there
very very quickly and we can&#39;t afford
not to and I think you know things are
gonna get a lot worse I think we&#39;re
going to be presented with a more
obvious choice as a civilization and I
think it I think we&#39;re going to make the
right decision that&#39;s what that&#39;s what
my gut says
awesome I have another question going
back to when you said about your other
work with quantum stuff and when you
mentioned about using consciousness to
turn on light bulbs and stuff like that
do you think that consciousness
technology crossover has been
reverse-engineered a weaponized yet and
if so what do you think that looks like
so that&#39;s that&#39;s a question that Adam
gets asked a lot and he&#39;s the he&#39;s this
he&#39;s the scientist not me of course
there&#39;s been attempts to weaponize this
kind of consciousness technology
interface you know he&#39;s doing it with
random number generators and so of
course this is always an attempt to
weaponize everything but was interesting
in what what they found in trying to do
that is that it doesn&#39;t work it doesn&#39;t
work when you try to weaponize it so
it&#39;s like there&#39;s a there&#39;s like you
know a fail-safe built into into
consciousness so that&#39;s not something
this isn&#39;t like inordinately elaborate
on it so people find through the fill in
the blank with their imagination this
isn&#39;t like a creepy you know Elon Musk
neuro-link
kind of thing this is just more of a way
of giving people of just showing people
power of their subconscious minds
hopefully getting them to you know even
though we&#39;re doing it in an app one
we&#39;re trying to be able to engage less
with technology and sort of you know
realize the impact that behind from the
world around us so it&#39;s just kind of a
cool kind of like a cool little feedback
tool will give you more information
coming out soon it&#39;s been in development
for a very long time and we&#39;re very
close
yeah
that integrated question chat about the
development status of the app I have one
for you Michael outside of dr. Greer
because if I go to travels and you&#39;ve
probably been in some pretty small UFO
community circles who are some of your
other favorite researchers oh okay so
definitely Joe Martino over at
Collective evolution I think he&#39;s he&#39;s
so he&#39;s so brilliant and so
underappreciated you know here&#39;s someone
who is is trying to you know create a a
category of news where you know in
instead of arranging people it&#39;s kind of
meeting people where they are and then
taking them to some more of a holistic
consciousness perspective on whatever
whatever is happening and it&#39;s it&#39;s
really he&#39;s really changed the way I
think about so many things I definitely
recommend checking out Collective
evolution I really think that Susan
manna which is awesome
she&#39;s lesser-known she&#39;s really amazing
she actually has done some interviews
for Collective evolution I really love
her
definitely Richard Dolan is fantastic
and and Katherine Austin Fitz even
though she&#39;s not technically a UFO
researcher she works with Dolan a lot
but she you know she was the former had
a former you know deputy head of the
Department of Housing and Urban
Development HUD which is the second
largest budget item in the u.s. budget
after defense and she blew the whistle
on it being you know 40 trillion dollar
slush fund and so she you know basically
shows you how all of this stuff is
funded how all of these secret projects
are funded
through what she calls the financial
harvesting of the American people it&#39;s
really really fascinating but my my
absolute favorite besides dr. Greer has
to be Daniel Sheehan and Danny Sheehan
isn&#39;t known as the UFO guy no the
Pentagon Papers guy I&#39;m sorry
did you ask me something teen that was
just someone didn&#39;t have the mic
immediately you know I recommend
everyone check out Daniel sheehan&#39;s new
paradigm Institute he&#39;s got some amazing
videos talking about you know why people
have the world views that they have I&#39;m
actually I&#39;m gonna post a video that we
I don&#39;t think we ever released I&#39;m gonna
post it on my on my Twitter page it&#39;s
about 15 minutes of him sort and talk
about this but you know he basically
talks about and we&#39;ll end it on this how
somebody&#39;s worldview is based on their
answer to four questions which is where
the where&#39;d the universe come from where
is it going how can we know that
something is true and what is it what is
the nature of being or what is the
nature of consciousness and you know the
way that we answer these four questions
you know even if it&#39;s just sort of
subconsciously what we assume about the
world this is what forms our worldview
in these there&#39;s seven of these
worldviews from authoritarianism
reactionary moderate conservative
liberal utopian progressive yeah but
then he says we need an eighth worldview
we need an eighth paradigm worldview for
a post disclosure world and I think that
if we could get the word out about
Danny&#39;s research we can really move the
needle on not talking past people
anymore because we can understand that
you know the reason why people just
can&#39;t understand what we&#39;re saying
whether we&#39;re you know having a debate
about politics or extraterrestrials or
whatever it is is that they&#39;re literally
in a different paradigm and it&#39;s their
answer to those four questions that I
mentioned that&#39;s really it&#39;s it&#39;s really
informing their answer to questions like
hey what kind of political systems you
have or you know our aliens gonna be
hostile or than be benevolent or they
did not exist would be impossible so
he&#39;s really getting that the root of the
dysfunction in our society and it&#39;s
unbelievably profound work so I
encourage everyone to check it out
perfect we will end on that note and
anyone there&#39;s missed question we&#39;re
gonna try to do this again down the road
keep in mind that mr. Missoula also has
a media schedule right now and in an
interview tour so we will try to do this
down the road again if you&#39;re if you&#39;re
up for this Michael I hope you enjoyed
it yeah this was super fun um I I don&#39;t
know how to use discord so I can&#39;t I&#39;ve
just been looking at the the rules of
the pay for the server the whole time I
can&#39;t see where anyone&#39;s posting
anything
unfortunately so you have to show me how
to do this this is the group who
basically held our hands and walked us
into this as well
guys like planet extreme and others have
been instrumental in this it truly is a
welcoming community it&#39;s really cool if
I could say coming into this I didn&#39;t
I&#39;d never tried any ce-5 protocols
anything like that I have horrible of
meditating I can never get my brain shut
down to work like that and I actually
tried it myself
after talking one late night we came to
a couple guys in the group and actually
had a experience someday I&#39;ll have the
courage to share it but this is a really
great group probably one of my favorite
parts of social media on all of doctor
Greer&#39;s
platforms is the discord chat discord
group because of their knowledge and
their ability to listen to different
opinions without attacking them so it&#39;s
a special place
awesome I love it yeah I&#39;ll totally come
back and don&#39;t call me mr. Rizzoli
I&#39;m just Michael thank you so much
everybody thanks for participating yeah
thanks for answering my questions
Michael Kenneth yeah
Horace thank you guys thank you all
right guys thanks again everybody
that I recorded I should probably end
the recording now
