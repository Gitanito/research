Courte9us Read,er, .··
' . l Now enjoy the great pleasure of
l>resenting unt_o· you a treqsnrc of immense value,
in this book, called the Universal-Fortune Teller,
which will (if duly observed) initiata;y,ou into.the
J~igbest · and . ~ost honourable ~cc _under the .
Son; fot: to be able to' do that, which 1s vnlgarly
ca\led telling' _fortU1fltfi., is to be most fully ena-
. bled to fortell tJ1ings which a.re yet to cotne, ancl
thereby become euabled to prophecy. _
Now in:order to.be duly qualified for this most
gi;:eat and important ·work, you must receive,
Jiave, and enjoy, " tlut spirit of wisdom ,and un-
tlerstMding; the spirit of counsel; st~engeh, know-
ledge,' am\ ·the foar of the' .Cord·; and also the
i;piri~ of truth/' &c. · All these said 1
gifts yoll
must recci,v.c from the great Creator of heaven
and earth, which may ,be duly .obtai.ned by,.fer-
:vent prayer; otherwise our writings will not yield
much profit un.to you; ; For· tihere , have been a
~reat number Qf :vc:ry :good, pious learned men,
m .all age• of t.he )world, who have likewise ob-
tained great gifts, graces aqd privileges-, yet have
not been favoured with gitls'of this nainre; which
are only given to a few., for many just reasons,
since we read, that " to one is given the word of
wisdom, to another the word of knowlcdg.e, to
another faith, to another the gift of healing, to
another the working of miracles, to another· pro-
phecy, to another the discerning of spirits, to
another divers kinds of tongues, to another in-
terpretation of tongues. But all these worketh

fhat one and the self same spirit, clivid ing unfo-
every man severally as h~ will." But some will
aay,.that all these miracles .ta.au gifts have abso-
lutely ceased, and have been of no effect at all
11ince the days of o.ur ~r and his Apost1es;
which said assertion I do positively deny; others
Jiave said that it is unlawful, and !ik.ewise a sin,
to · presume to rea:d the heit vens, ·'us' ·tliercby ti;}
judge of the fnie of any person'whatsoever. Th.,
same chal'acte:fl tnay ns well ~H me.it is ·a sin to
;read the Bible: I should ,believe ;them jost ns
1oon ; for.I look upon one.of them to be.equally
as holy aod ilS sacred:in ;CVITTY respt-ct what-soe.ver
as the other, seeing that , tln~y both: cbntdin the
voole will and word of the< .King of Kings and
L.otd of Lords. · The onl'i was ·printed by th·e
hand of mau,. while tpe ·oth~.r was'written by the
1ingerof the most high God, aud this is. the prin-
cipal reason why the ·chHdrenlof thie \\·.or.Id, the
:ffesh and .~he devil cannot read it. " ' ' ·

What il is, tuilk- the Nature and Ust of tlu: Sip1 _

AsTROLOGY is- a Celestial Science, that treats of the
Doctrine of the Stars, which,are placed in the firmament.
of heaven, for the us!l-aJJd benefit of man, ''"' fot signs :
and for seaso11&, -and for ·days and years."*. We h_ave .
likewise clnly . observed, by manifeBt experience, that.·.
those said Stars are duly 'inhabited by se.reral Legions of .
AngelB, Ast1itl aod Olympic Spirits,,who are by divine
appoiqttnent (by the order and direction of the_great
Creator of the Universe) the governors of kjogdoma,
state!!, cities. people, «nd private persons; for if 7011
_ take all that is. truly _spiritual from the body of a man, '
there is notbiug left except a dead corpse: so it·would .
he exactly 11·ith.the Stars of Heaven; Were they ditest-1 ·
of all th~iMpiritual powers, strength and energy; there-
fore it can never .be understood .that the bodies of the
stars and ,1aaets thems.elves can have any power or in.a
fluence on any thing Ii.ere be!ow, any farther than what
is.derived frolfi..,th~ spiritual p~_rt of the same,- or other-,

wise, how could .it have been said, fl1at ~' the morning
:·stat's sang together, when all the Sons of God shouted
for joy.',. It was never understood that the bodies of
.
the ste,rs made u.p any part in the celestial chorus : no
rational .being can ever ' s·uppose any such thiog.-Well
tlie.ri·, 't,his (as weli as all other operations) 'must ha~e
J>een performed and duly ·executed by the spiritual part
of the same, as I said before. In like manner, we also
fin!f, that " they fought from heaven: the stars i~ their
cou~&eS foug'ht again&t Sisera," + as they ha_
ve and wall
contin11e to do, both agl\in&t you and me, and every
body else, at .their own pr_oper appointed times, and
seasons. · But we -~re not going to ·suppos~ that any Of
thes~ various operations were performed by the bodi~ll
of the stars, -0r that they had any part in th,e same.
You m~y find another subject of this nature more fully
explained iq the Holy ·Scriptures. :j: Now all th-cse things .
.and most wonderfitl operJtions were duly performed by
the angels of the Lord ; the devil had no hand in them.
as some have understood, r~ecting this most excellent
celestial. science; for it '!as God that made the stars,
. alld ptllced them in tire nr01ament of heaven, as a great,
. large, and voluminous boQk, whereiri _the . particular
' fates, life, death, prosperity .and adversity,._sickness and
beahh, &c•. &c. of CVt'fY. person iri exi&tence, is mast
clearly writtc'il by the finger of God. Hut none 'Can

of it when .I haTe d11i)e. TJiese iaid stars have hot only

her iuclinations to love never unreasc.nable ; her con:.

QUESTION.
Whether ire m~st give Judgment b!J the Big4t Hantl
or b9 the Left.
It is certain, that in one hand the lines and other si~­
llatures are very often more manifest, and are thus more.
plain fo be seen and perspicuous than in the other, aa
well in the hands of gentleman as ·ladies. Wherefore, a
question hence arises, whether in both sexes the right
or left hand is to be taken, or whether the right hand
of a gentleman (as some teach) and the left of a lady
only. · · ·
ANSWER.
That band (in both sexes) which shews and exhibits
· the lines thereof most clearly, and· abounds with a series
of cbaraders and signs; yet so, as that the other, whose
· lines are·more obscure, may ·pay its contribution. If in
both hands they consent and appear to be fair and
comely; they declare a constancy of fortune and health.
The cause of whkh said diversity ia this: He who is born
in .the day time, and hath a masculine planet (the Sun,
Saturn, -;Jupiter or Mars} Lord of his Geniture, bears
the more remarkable signs in his right hand, especially
when the sign afcending is also masculine. The contrary
happens to them that are born by njght, as often as a
feminine planet predominates, and the sign- ascending is
also feminine. If both hands agree, it must be, that in
a·diurnal nativity the feminine pl.mets rul~; or that there
falls out a mixture of·masculine and feminine; so in the
night by the contrary reason, which diversity must ue-
cessarily be obaerved.

some inauspicious characters; unhappily, if he ~hew con·

bones and bladde.r. When he is fortunate; · he makus
men silent, provident, of good a·nd 1•rofQund counsels,
•~ch as· think and study much, and ·are somewhat sor.
rowful; men that are puffed up with a silent spirit, and
whose aim is honours. And these are slender of body,
&Qmewbat tall, pale aud foebl~, their hair blackish, eyes
hollow;. they are fortunate in tilling of ground, and in
metals of all sorts, yet more careless of their wives, an4
kn addicted to the pkasures of Jove ; fooli~hly laughing

Dien sorrowful, labcrrfous, &ordid, humble, covetous,
· liars, malicious, envious, &c. and incumbered with per.
·petual griefs and anxieties; thus also he aftlicteth •ith
dangerous diseases, catarrhs, coughs, melancholy, hy'!'
pochondriacal intirmities, dropsy, gout, falling sickness,
hectic and quaTtan fevers and ag11ea; he caueeth i!Dpri.
looments, falls from horses, and· endangering of life by

Shewing_tAe SU¥ation of Moles; and the l111lication th9
girJe of a Person's Disposition and future Lot in ~ife.
'J..,HOUGH moles are, in their substances, nolhi~~
else than excrescences, or ebullitions which pro1~eed from
the state of the blood whilst the fmtus is confined in the
womb, yet they are not given in vain, as they are gen~
rally characteristic of the disposition and temper of those
that. bear them ; and it is also proved by daily experience,
that from the shape, situation, and other circumstances;
they heir a strong analogy to the eve'nts which, are to
happen to a pcrfon in future life.. llut before I presume
to give a.uy directions to those who arc to form the prog•
nostic, who are de~irous to be duly enabled to pronounce
an infallible judgment, I shall, in the first place, teach
you how to t1·il, ·and duly inform any peTsou whom you
never saw iu your life, ~ve'n at an hundred or ten thou.
sand miles di>tauce, on what particular marks of the body
they have any
MARKS, SC.ARS1 OR MOLES,
from and by the figure of the heavens at tl)e time of their
·birth, without having any other communication ·or refer-
. enee whatsoever_
.In rhe. first place, you must observe what sign that is·
which is upon th" cusp of the asct!ndaut, and in that part
of the native'b body which that 'ign governs, there will·
be a mole. l<,or instanct·: if Aries be the sign _
ascending
at tho lime of birth, the mole will be on the head or ~cei

T~IE UNIVJUtUL
if Taurus,,on the neck or throat; if Gemini, on the arms
or shoulders;·if Cancer, Go the breast ; and upon any
other part of the body which the sign ascending shaU go-·
Tern. Observe next, in which of the twelve houses the
Lord of the A_
scendant is' posited, and in that part of
, the body tbe sign governs which happens to fall upon the
cu1p of that hou1e_, the native will have another mol<'.
Next observe the sign descending on the cusp of the sixth
house, and in whatever part of the body that sign go.
Terns, t,he native will find another mole; -and upon that
member also wliich is signified by the sii;n, wherein tile
Lord of the sixth house is pO&ited, will be found another.
Observe also what sign the moon is posited in, and in
that part .of die b_od}" which is governed by it, shall the
native or querent find another mole. If ·the .planet Sa.
turn be .
the signi.ficator, the ~olc is bither black or of a
·dark colour. IfMars be thcsignificatoP, and in a.fiery sign,
itthen resembles a scar, cut, or dent in the flesh, but in
any other sign it is a red mole. If Jupiter be thesiguifi-
cator, the mole is ·of a purple or bluish cut. If the S.un,
it is of an olive.or chc1mut colour. If Vcous, it is yeJ.·
low; if. Mercury, of a pale foad colour; if the Moon, it
is whitish, or participates of the colour of that planet
with which she happens to be in aspect. And if the
planet which gives the mole be much impedited or af-
fiicted,. the mark or mole will then be larger and more
Tisible. . . ·
If the sigu and planet whiclt gives the mark or mole be
1DA9(:ulioe; it is then situated on the ri~ht side of the bo-
dy ; but if feminine, on the left side. If the sign.ificaror
or planet which giv11s the' mole, be found ahove the ho-
rizon, that is, from the cusp of the :osr.cndant to the cusp ·
of the· seventh, eithe.i: iu the twelllh, eleventh, te~th,
ninth, eighth, or scYt:nth house, the niar.k or mole will be
on the fore part of the .body; bnt if lht> si~uiJicator be
undei: the Earth, th.at is, in citl1el' the first, ~ccond, third,
four!h, fifth, or sixth house, it ·wlll be hituated on the
back or hinder part of the body. If only a few dega--eea.
of the sign ascend upon the horoscope, or descend on tho
. sixth, or if the Lord of the Ascendant, J~ord of the sixth,
or the Moon be posited ira the bC&ion~ng of any sigu, t~e
.FORTUNE•TBLLER. 61
said mole or mark will be found upon the upper part of
the member those aign8 govern. If half the drgrecs of a
sign ascend, or the significators arc po;lited in the middle
of any sign, the mole or mark will then be in the mid.
die of the member; but if the last degrees of a sigrt ascend,
or tlte significators are in the latter degrees ef a sign, the
said mark or mole will then he situated .on the -lower part
ofthe membel' such sign governs.
These observations arc of excellent use, in .order to
know whether a question be radical, fit and propec to be
judged; for if the question be found thus radical, $he
time rightly taken; 11Dd the quercnt sincere and <>f suf.
ficient age, this rule will never be found to fail. And it
is also of excellent use and utility in ascertaining the true
and exact time of any person's nativity, or of rectifying
the same; that ii, bringing the given from the supposed
time of birth, by this means, to the true and real time·o(
birth, of any person whatsoever.
I shall now proceed to give you bert'in the common
prognosti,ations by moles found in all tbe various parts
of the body, according to the doctrine of the Ancients..
.And first, it is·essentially neressary to know the i;ize of
the mole, its colour, 'whether if- be perfectly round, ob-
long, or angular; because each of these will add to, or
diminish the force of the indication. The l.arger the
mole, the grta.ter will be the prosperity or adver~ity of
the person; the smaller the mole, the less will. be his
good or evil fate. II' the mole is ru1rnd, it indicates good;
ifoblong,. a mut.lerate share of fortunate c•elltS; if angu..
Jar, it g.ives a mixture of ~ood and evil; the dreper thQ.
• colour, the more it announces favour or disgrace; the
lighter, the Jess of either. Hit is vt·ry hairy, much mis-
fortu!lc may be opl'Cl\·d; if. l!ut few long h.1irs grow
upon it, it <l:.:notes that your undcrta.kiugs will be pros•
pc.roes.
I shall further remark only, That moles of.a middling
.aDd _common size and cq)our, are those which I am now
~oing to speak of. The re11t may be gathered from what
I have just above mentioned; but as it may frequently
happen that modesty will sometimes hinder persons from

. Various are the opinions of authors. respecting this

judge th eamc by their whole assemblage of features,
contained in the never failin1h and well es.tablished rulea

judgment upon all the past, present and future events of.-
their natural lives, by ~hat admirable and most w-Onder-

reipcct to their several accounts wh!ch are thus to be

to premise before the casting of the lot, some sacred
performances, in which they called upon God by prayer,
that he would by some dhine intelUgence ·or 'holy spirit,
conduct and duly diltect tha.t.saht lot aright. Therefore
whatsoever kind of presag6 these sort of lots portend an!l

gion; Much more could I say on this important sub.
ject, .but as my present limits will not admit of it, I now
must immediately come to
1'HE EXPL.ANATION OF THE CARDS;,
And how to .divine by them.
In the first place, take a pack of cards and shuftle them
w11ll three times ewer, aiid making your aignificator which
.queen you please (if a lady performs the operations for
herself, orkiogif a gentleman); then proceed to lay them
_on a table, niue in a row, and wherever you.find yourself
placed, count nine cards -eTery way, not forgetting your
said significator,·and then you will see what card your
_aignificator comes in. company with, and w.hatev;er it is,
so it will happen· to you , .
If two red te1111 come against your said significator, it
is a sign,of marriage or prosperity; the ace of diamonds
i1 a riug, .the ace of hearts is your hou.11e; the ace of
clubs is _a Jetter, the ,ace .of spadea is death, Qr aome
grievous afft.iction, spite, or quarrelling (for that .is. the
,wor11t card in the pack). The ten of.diao1-0uds_ is a jour-
ney. The tray of hea.rts is a salute,_ the tray of spades
b tears, the ten of spades is sic)p1.ess, .the nine of spades
is a sad dis.appoif!ltnent or . trouble, the uiue of clubs
shews a j~via.1 entertainment .or revelling, the nine of
hearts feasting, the ten of clubs travelling by wablr
the ten of hearts some p,lace· of amusement, the five of
hearts a present, the five of clubs a bundle, the six of
spades a child, the seTen of spades a removal, the trllj..
*Acta i. ill. +Jonah i. 'I'.
FOR.T17KE•TBLLB&. 69
o( clob• fighting, the eight of clubs confusion, the eight
of spades a road-way, the four of clubs a strange bed,
the nine of diamonds business, the fife. ·Of diamonds a
tettlement, the five of apades a surprne, the two . reel
eights new clothes, the tray of diamonds speaking with
a friend, the four of spades a sick bed, the aeven of clulH
a prison, the !-leuce o( spades a false friend, the four of,
hearts a marriage bed. When several diamonds.come
together, it .is a sign that you will soon receive some
money, sever~! bearti; love, several,cl11bs drink and noisy
troublesome company, and several spades troable and
'Vexation, &c. . .
If a married lady doth lay_ the cards, .she must then
make her l).u•b11od the king of the same suit she is queen
of; but if a sh:igle lady doth llUlke use of this science,
she must make her lover what king she may think pf()o. ·
per ; the knav" of the· same suit are the. mens' thought•;·
so that they may know ~.hat they are thinking of,..by
counting nine cards from w™sre they are lllaced; and if
any lady should wish to know whether she shall obtain
her desires in any particular. adbject, matter, or thiog
whatsaever, let her tihufile the cards well, most seriou8ly.
.and earnestly wishing all the time for some one thing,
•he must then cut them once, particularly ob11ervilig at
the same tirre what card that ia which she cuts, then
shuffle them again, and then deal them out into three
parcels, which being done, look ·carefully over every
parce~, and if that said particular card which you havo
just cut doth come next yourseJf, or oe:itt the ace of
hearts you will have your wish-, but if the nine of spades
is next tu you, you must then judge the contrary, for
that is a disappointment; however you may try it three
times, taking the major number of testimonies for a
ground whereon to place your judglftent.
Thi>. method of using the cards is both innocent and
will also afford you a fund of amusement, whtle that

Now having made these said sixteeo lines of points,
they did not count the number of points in each line as

any necessity to give you any further explanation of
them ; there are a great n.um'!>er of.other valuable secrets
belonging unto this science, but as my present limits will
not admit of our placing them hereio, I will now proceed
to give you one example, and teach you how to duly
place th.u above mentioned figures in the twelve house•

How lo reulve OR;JCLES '19 DRE.AMS. .
I Call that a dr~am which proceeds either from the
·•pirit of .the phantasy and intellect united together,
or by the illustration of th·e agent intellect aboYe our
souls, or by the true revelation of some divine power in
·& quiet and purified mind ; for by this our soul receives
trne oracles, and abunda11tly yield• prophecies to us; as
in Dream• we seem both to ask questions, and "learn to
find them ont. Also many .doubtful things, many poli-
cies, many things unknown, unwished for, and never at.
'tempted by our minds, are manifested to us in dreams;
also· the representation of things unknown, and un.
known places; also appear to us, and the images of men,
both alive and ~ead ; and thing! to come are foretold,
and also which at any time have happened are revealed,
which we know not by any report. And these kind of
dreams need not any art of interpretation, as those which
belong to divination, not to foreknowledge; and it
comes to pass that they wJio hHe dreams for the most
part understand them not, for as to have dreams is from
the strength of imagination, so to .understand them is
from the strength of under5tanding. They, -therefore,
whose intellect· being overwhelmed by too much com-
merce of the ftcRh1 is in a dead sleep, or fantastic power,
or spirit iii too dull and unpolished, so that· it cannot
receive the species and repre:icntation which Hows from
the aupt!rior intellect; this man, I_ say, is altogether unfit
for the receiving of dreams and prop_hesying by them.
Therefore it is necessary that ho who would receive true
dreams, should keep a pure, undisturbed, and im·agina.
tife spirit; and so compose it, that it may be made wor.
thy of the knowledge and government by the mind and.
undefstaudin1; for such a spirit is mo.st fit for prophesy..
..
fog. and is a most clear glass of all the images which fiow
.(every wfi..ere) from all things. WheA. therefore, we are
.sound in body, not disturbed in mind, our intellect not
made· dull by heavy meais and strong drink, not slMI
through poverty, not proYoked through lust~ not incited -
by any vice, nor stirred up by wrath or·anger, not be-.
ing .irreligionsly and profanelyJnclined, not given-to Jc..
vity, nor lost in drunkenness; but chastely going to b~~
fall asleep, then our pure and divine soul being free from,
~11 the evils above recited, and separated from all hurtful
thoughts, and now freed, by dreaming is endowed _
with·
this divine spirit as an instrument, and doth receive those
beams and representations which are darted down·as it
were, and shine forth from the divine mind into .it--
self, in a deifying glass. It does more .certainly, more ·
clearly and efficaciously behold all things, tJian by the ·
vulgar inquiry or. the intelleet and by the discours•·.
of reason. The divine person instrueting the soul,;
being invited to their society by the opportunity of the
,nocturnal solitariness, neither will that spirit or gobius-
bc wanting to hiin when he is aw-ake, which.rulea all. ·
our actions. Whosoever, therefore, by quiet and re--
ligious meditation, and by diet temperate and.moderate-
according to.nature, .preserves his spirit pore) shall very ·
much prepare himself, aod by this means become io a
®~rec divine, and knowing all things justly merit the ·
same. But whosoever, on the contrary languishes with .
a fantastic spirit, he receives not pcrspieuous and distaot
vi~ions; but even ag the di,ine sight l>y reason of its vi~
sion being weakei'led and impaired_., doth judge con• .
fuscdly and indistinc&ly•; so also .when we are overcom,
with strong liquor and drunkenneH, theu Ojlr· spirit
being- oppressed with ·noxious vapours (a• a· troubled .
water is apt to appear in various forms) is deceived, and
waxes dull. Therefore all those who would receive ora..
clcs by dreams, and those said oracles·true-and .certain,
I would advise him to ab~tain one whole day from meat,
and three days from wine or any-other strong liquors,
and drink nothing but pure water; for to sober and re-
ligious minds the pure spirits are adhe,-ent, but 1ly from ·
all those who are drowned in clrunk.enneSI &Dd surfeit.iog..

82 THE UNtvlmsAL
Although impure spirits do •ery often administer no.
table 'Secrets to those who are apparently be~ted with
ttroog- liquors, yet all such communications are to be
contemned and avoided. But there are four kinds of
true :dreams, viz. the firsc matuline, i; e. between sleeping,
and waking; the secon'd that which one sees co1u;ernin~ .
another; the third, that whose interpretation is shewn to
the same dreamer in the naeturnal vision; and lastly,
that whioh is repeated to the same dreamer in the DOC•
turnal vision. But natural thinp;s and their own co111.
miXtUrCfl do likewise belong 11DtO wise m•m, and WC orten
use such to receive oracles from a spirit by a dream,
which are either by pertumeE, unctions, meats, drinks,
rings, seals, &c. Now those who are desirous to re.
ceive -0rac:les in or through a dream, let 'them make
themselves a -
ring of the Sun or Saturn-for this purpose,
There are like11·isc images of dreams, which beiti~ put
under the head when he goes to sleep, doth effectually
p;ive true dreams of whatever the mind hath before .
det~nnined or consulted upon. The practke of which ii
as foUom.
Tb.ou shalt make an image of th!'l Sun, the figure where.
of must be a man sleeping upon the bosom of an -angel ;
·w-hich thou shalt make when I~co.ascends, the Sun_being
in the ninth ho11s~ in Aries; then you must write opc1n
the figure the name of the effect desired, and in the hand
of theangel'the name and charac~er or the intelligeuce of
the Sun, which i1 Mjchael.
Let the sameimage be madein Virgoascending; Mercury
being fortunate ill Aries in the ninth, or Gemio~ ascend.,
hg; Mercury being -fortumrtc in the ninth house in
Aquarius; and kt him be received by Saturn with a for-
tunate ·aspect, and let the name or the spirit (which is
Raphael) be written upon ,it. Let the same likewise be
matle, Libra ascending, Vcnus being received from Mer-
cury in Gemini in the 11iuth house, and write upon It
the name-of the angel of Venus (which is An~cl). Again
-
you may make the same image; Aquarius ascending, s.:..
tllr• fortunately possessing the ninth in 'his exaltation,
which is Libra, and let there bP, written upon it the

eame may be made with Cancer ascen,iing, the MooQ ·
being received by Juplter and_Venus in Pisces, and being
fortunately placed .in the ninth house, and write upoll ·
it the spirit of the Moon, who is Gabriel. ' ·
~rhere arc likewise made ring' of dre.ams of wonderful
efficacy, and there are rings of the Sun and Satum, ani
the conswllation of them is, when the Sun or Saturn
ascend in their exaltations in the .ninth, and when the
Moon is joined to Saturn in the ninth, and in ·thatsigia
which was the ninth·house oftbe nativity, and write and ·
engrave upon the rings the name uf.tbe spirit of the Sua ·
or Saturn, and by these rules youmay know bow and by
what means to .constitute more of youl'Self. But know
this, ·that such images work nothing, (as they are simply
images) except they are vivified.by a -viritual and celes.
tial virtue, and chiefly .by the ardent desire and firm inA
tent of the soul of the operator. But who can give a ·
soul to lUl image, or make a stone, or metal, or clay, QI'
wood, or wax, or paper to live?·Certainly no man what..
soever; for this arcanum .doth not enter into on artist
of a stiff neck; he only hath it, who transcends the pro.
gress of angels, and comes.to the very ·Arcbtype himself.
The tables of numbers likewise <:Dufer to the receiviog of
OTacles, being duly formed uuder their own constellations.
Holy tables and papers likewise serve to this effect, being
especially .composed and duly consecrated, such as the'
Almual of Solomon, and the table or the revolution of
' t~e name Tetragrammatoo, and all those things which ·
are ofthis kiod,'8nd .written to produce these effects, out
of various figures, numbers, holy scriptnres and picture&) · ·., )
with inscriptions of the divine names of God, and names
of holy ar•_gels, the:_somposition wkereor is taken ont of
divers places of the Holy Scriptures, Psalms, and Versi.
cles,and other certain promises out of the divine re•ela... _
tion and prophecies. . · '
To the. same effect do conduCfl likewise holy prayen
and deprecations, as well to God as to the bles;ed angell,
1he deprt·cations of which prayers are to be composed, as
-we have before shewn, according to som'e religious.
aim~litude, makJng mention of, thoae things which we
intend to do, a1 out of the Old Testament of the dreaa ~

' THE U.NIVEIUAL
Jacob, Joseph, Pharoh, Daniel, and Nebuchadnezzar;
if oot of the New Testament, of the dream of Jbseph, of
the th.ree wise men, or 111~i, of John the evangelist sleep-
ing upon tlie breast of our Lord, 1tnd whatevu of the like
kind can be found in rdip;ioo, miracles, and reJel•tian ;
according to which the deprecation may IJe:compqaed,
i( when h'e goea to sleep it be with a firm intention, and
then without doubt they will afford ii wonderful effect.
Therefore he who is desirons of rereiYing true oracles by
dreams, let him abstain from supper, from driok, and be .
. otherwisewelldisposed,so his brain will be free from turbu-
lent vapours; Jet.him also hue his bed chamber fair nod
clean, exorcised and consecrated, thtm let l\im perfume the
same with some conYrnicnt fumigation, and let him anoint
h!s tcD1ples with aqp1e unguent efficacious hereuuto, and
put a ring of .dreams upon his finger; then let him
u~ke one of the images we have 1pokca of, or ~ome holy
tal,1le or paper, and place the Fame under hiS head; then
Jt~ving mad.ca deyout prayer, let him address himself to
sleep, meditatin~ upon that thing which he deiires to
know. So shall he receive a most certain and undoubted
oracle by a dream, \I hen the Moon gt.>es througla that
!ign which was in the ninth house of his nathity ; and
also when she goes through the ~ign of the ainth of the
revolution of his nativity, and when she is in the ninth
.Mgn froru the sign of perfection.
This is the way whereby we may obtain all soicnccs
and arts whatsoever, whether, astrology, occult philo.
sophy, phy~ic, &c. or el8c sucldcnly and perfectly with
a true illumination of our intellect, although all inferior
famili11r spirits .whatsoever l'Oodut:c to thia ·effect, and
sqmotimes also evil spirits scn~iuly inform us, iotz:insically
and _
extrinsically.
I shall now proceed to treat you with the common In-
terpretations of Dre.ams in the follo\~ing .Alphabetical

may be .certain that some secret enemy is at-work to
compa~s your ruin ; if they are totally destroyed, ·you
may exp.t•ct some fatal re.verse in your affairs; if you are
sick when you dream of ants, expect a lingering reco.
Yery ; but you may hasten it by moderate exercise and

use of to that·purpose.
Appllrel. Should you chance to dream that you are
"fcry genteelly dressed, and .in good company, it declares

aod los~ of gooJs; if you dream you are drt•ssed in white,
you will succeed in the first thing you undertake; if yoor.
apparel is black, beware of a quarrel, a lawsui~ a fit ot

What NUMBERS arc attributed to I~ETTERS and

Aristotle and Ptolemy are of an opillion fb!lt the 'f'ery
. e1emf'nts of lelters have some certain drvine .numbers,
by which collectf!d from pi:oper n'ames or tkings, we are
duly informed r.oncerning ~cull thiugs to come. Whence
'they ·call this kind of divination arithmancy, bt'cause it
is. performed by numbers; as Terentiaous hath men1ioned
it ill the foll«?wiog verse. . ' . ; -
Nantes are, they say, made of but Jet~ers few,
Unfortunate of many do foresbew , ·
Success-:-Ro Hector did ~3trm:lu9' slay,
So Heetor to A_chillcs was .a prey.
The anCient philosophers by their experience in this
art, · an uneven number of vowels of imposed names,
which did betoken lameness, &c. _
and m:iny .mi~fortU:nei.,
' jf they are assigned to the right side parts, but an e1cn
number ta.. those· of the J'eft; and they have further
t:wght, how that by the numbn of lr;Ucrs we rnay find
out the ruJiog star of any penon ~batsoever that ts born,_
' and whether the husband .or wife &hall die first, &c. and

Now ifyou ies;rc to know the ruling star in the na-

_and also tile name of bQth his parents,- through ·each let-
ter, 'llrcording to -,th~ 'Dlimbet abov!' written, and then
divide:the sum:9f the whole (being _added- together) by
nine, subtracting it as oft~n as you cae ; and if there
remains an unity oi:, fo11r, both signify the Sun; if two '
or se¥en, both ifgnify the Moon ; hut three, Jupiter ;
five, Mercury; six, Venus; eigh(, Salum; niI1e, Mars..
Io like manner, if you desire to know the-. horosc.ope of
any_ person that is botn, then compute his name, au4
also the name of bis mother and father, .and t~n _divide
the whole (being first added together)' by twelve: If
there remain an unity, it signifies Leo; if two, Aqnaries;
if tbree, Capricorn; if four, Sa!iUarins; if five, Capcer;

that ha those said numbers, do lie certain occult mys•

created' all tliings by number, weight and measure, from
w~ence the truth orfetters and names had their original,
-which were.not iostit11ted casually, bot by a ce?tain rule.

here in this place, that every such perso~ making use
of the same, should absolutely feel, within themselves a
real anxiety and most fervent desire a.nd solicitude to be

her you please, so that it doth not exceed :m, to which
add the numben of the · day of the' 11eek, and the planet
ruling that said day, aud also the number you find in
the wheel over the first Jetter of your name together,
and· then divide the sum total by 30, and look for the
remainder in the wheel, and if it happens to be in tl1e
up11cr half of the !i6me, the matter or business will the11
&ucc.eed ; but if found in the lower half, it will be evil;

resolve .any question, I woold first fix upon any number
in 1hi5 said whel'I, or otherwis.c, the first that cometh
into my mind, suppose it is number l; then as it ia

that being the number belongiug unto the day of the

as abovemeuiiou<·d; to which also I must add the num-
. ber found l.n the wheel over the first letter of my nam<',
