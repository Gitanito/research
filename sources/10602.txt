Hello, this is something that I thought was a dream.


In the summer of 1974 around 11PM, I fell asleep at the wheel of the car.  I slammed into the rear end of a tractor trailer that was parked alongside of a highway.  It jammed the 1967 Ford Mustang I was driving between the rear axles and the bottom of the trailer.


When I woke up, I was in a room on a stretcher with a hospital employee dressed in white who was taking off my clothes.  I asked, ''What's going on?'' He said, ''I have to go get a doctor, don't move.''  I laid there until the doctor came in and wheeled me into another room that appeared to be an emergency room.  They started checking me out.


While I was in there, a State Trooper said, ''Do you realize what happened to you?'' I said, ''No, but I had a dream that I was standing next to my car trying to look into it while most of it was jammed under this tractor trailer rig.  I couldn't really see much more than the back of the drivers bucket seat and figured that I had dreamed that someone had stolen my car and was in a bad accident.  I figured as bad as the car was wrecked, the driver had to have been killed.''  The trooper about turned white and said, ''That was no dream you had, what you described is exactly what happened.''


Then he showed me some pictures they took at the scene of exactly what I had seen in my dream.  He said, ''If I'd thought there was a chance of you being alive or showing any signs of life I would have told the rescue crews to hurry it up.''  It took us 2-1/2 hours to get the car out from between the axels and the bottom of the trailer and you out of the car.  The paramedics said, ''Forget it, he's gone.'' They loaded me up and brought me to the Hospital where I later woke up.


It took me years to realize that it had to be me in the car I was trying to look into.  I might have possibly been pretty near dead; I suffered a broken arm, wrist, nose, jaw, and internal injuries and urinated blood for a few days afterwards.  It took a few months before I felt like my old self again.  30 years ago, I never heard of NDEs, nor was it something you heard about.  I thought it was really just a dream.  When I think back on the experience, I still don't know for sure if I was dead.  I do not believe in life after death either, to me dead is dead.

I was just looking around for the article and found it.  It is old and worn, but the picture of the car is clear.  It has the state trooper standing next to the mangled car along with a bystander.  The article has my name, age, and address printed under the picture.  The rest of the right side of the article isn't readable.  I was off a little on the date of the accident.  The article was printed in the June 4, 1974 edition of the newspaper.  I actually took the steering wheel off from the impact with my upper torso and face.  I took the full impact of the center of the steering column dead center of my chest.  Had I seen that coming and tensed up, it probably would have killed me for sure.  My father thinks being asleep, limp, and just flying into everything without being tensed up saved me.


I'm not sure if I'm still in the car or not in this picture.  Probably not, since all I remember is standing by the driver's side rear window trying to look in but it was dark out and I couldn't see inside well enough to see who it was. There wasn't anybody there but me at the time.  After thinking about this a little more, I don't recall any sense of feeling, air temperature, or smell.  I guess my dream or NDE was immediately after the accident.  One thing I do remember is there was steam from hot antifreeze and engine oil, making it more difficult to see inside.  I was standing there alone wondering what's going on.  After that, there was nothing else to dream or remember until I woke up in the hospital.  I don't remember being removed from the car or being loaded up for transport to the hospital.  I guess the reason I thought it was a dream is because I woke up like I normally would; except I was being stripped of my clothes in an open-spaced hospital room with no apparent medical equipment around and in a bit of pain.
