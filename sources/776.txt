This functioned as the lodge bulletin of and as propaganda for the D.O.G. (Deutsche okkulte Gemeinschaft), a provincial occult organization with a grade system and a Grand Lodge in Augsburg. The order seems to have featured a mixture of reincarnation, astrology, magnetism, and “praktischer Okkultismus.”  Jean Paar, who described himself as an occultist and painter, was a frequent contributor (and also offered a 25% discount on his sepia paintings for those contributing to the D.O.G.'s building fund).  Bruno Noah, the correspondence editor for the journal and General Secretary of the D.O.G., also published Phönix, and Die Astrologie, as the D.O.G. published Okkkultische Rundschau (1919) and Mitteilungen of the D.O.G.  ZDB: Freiburg Inst Grenzgeb Psychol; Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin. The journal is now available digitally from  Freiburg i. B.: Institut für Grenzgebiete der Psychologie und Psychohygiene, online at  http://www3.ub.uni-freiburg.de.
