I was saying to myself, 'I need air' and I cannot breathe at all. Then suddenly, I felt so peaceful, warm, and calm.  It lasted about 15 seconds. I never felt anything like that in my life before.  Everything was dark and I was so peaceful, warm, and calm and didn't care about anything in the world.  I feel like I wasn't even in my body at all and have neither pain nor feeling of sickness at all. It was a great feeling!
