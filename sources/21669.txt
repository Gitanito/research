PREFACE
Read not to contradict and refute
Nor to believe and take for granted,
Nor to find, talk and discourse,
But to weigh and consider.
—Sir Francis Bacon.
"Woe unto you who are satisfied."—Jesus.
"The best that can be said of a book on the subject is
that by its aid, the reader was enabled to pass beyond it.
For the more profoundly one catches the idea, the more per
sistently one will investigate. Not books but the living real
ity itself." —Dresser.
It is of the greatest privilege and joy I am able to share
in part my experiences of truth I have gleaned on the path
of progress with those who are aspiring to find a clearer
concept of cosmic life.
The attempt to investigate the inner life in this practical
spirit, is no doubt subject to difficulties. Many objections
are likely to arise.
In fact the production of this volume was begun with
the conviction that the truth of the philosophy of life may
be brought nearer and clearer. For the conventional sys
tems often fail to make clear precisely how man should begin
to live the better life.
In its pages you will find simple statements of the general
theory of the inner life explained.
Great problems are only touched upon. There is a vast
scope for study and scientific investigation to be found in
modern science and psychological study of religion, —with its
experimental research, it is creating new interest in solving
the art or philosophy.
The farther the student travels on the path of investiga
tion, he discovers co-operation with the law imperative.

10 ON THE PATH
I have given you something of the Truth, as viewed
from my concept, on traveling the path. Incidentally, it is
hoped the facts gleaned from personal experience, will be the
means of shedding more light upon the path of others, also
helping to mold the outer tabernacle as well as the inner,
for those ready to start upon the journey of the soul's
evolution.
Through the practical art of science, of the inner life in
vestigation, have I been enabled to glean from the tree of
knowledge the golden fruits of reality, through this applied
psychology you will discover a renewed interest pertaining
to Divine Law of life and religion.
Those who attempt to investigate the inner life, first, will
feel perhaps, the path of the ascension wrought with diffi
culties.
Books which are the thoughts of others enable the stu
dent to press onward on the path, acting as first aid for
them, or a primary school. It is for this reason only that I
am sharing some of my experiences I have encountered and
solved with others. That the path of the soul's evolution
will not be quite so difficult for those to travel—coming
after. I assure you it is an enticingly interesting, as well as
a beneficial path to travel.
It is through suffering, many times, that starts the investi
gation on the path of light. It was through physical illness
that was my peremptory, for seeking a greater knowledge of
self-analysis and of natural laws.
For this reason I am desirous to assist and enable others
to improve their talents to get a greater understanding of self
analysis, by broadening and molding their character anew.
This will be found throughout every page.
Investigation in the fields of Truth will be a joyous one,
if you keep your mind centered upon the goal you have set
out to reach and your motto be, "Not for self, but for oth
ers." Victory will be your reward.
You will find in its pages, that God exists and he is good
—no longer is there a wrathful God. He who desires per
ception will easily find the master physician —you will find
man is immortal —there is no limit to the heights of attain
ment. You learn every thought, word and action, produces
a definite result—the relation of cause and effect is definitely
connected and interwoven throughout all life. You will

team when we die, we are not dead when we know we stilt
live, We will want to live more intelligently, becoming of
greater service while here—that Christ is in the heart of every
man. It is the duty of all to discover this Christ and recog
nize his oneness.
You find another can aid you, in discovering the path.
But you must walk therein alone. Another great lesson you
will discover, is a new conception of Heaven and Hell, that
they are states of consciousness, arising from the right or
wrong path of life chosen. You will learn on the path of
progression, are different grades of Heaven and Hell, all de
pends on your progression and the operation of Divine Law.
You will find service is power. It is through observation
and experiences. Universal Truth is found. That God
causes no poverty, no lack. We ourselves, set in motion,
causes by our obedience or disobedience to Divine Law. You
will find you become like what you think; "what you sow
you reap."
You learn character and thought, make men what they
are. You will find to worship God, is to love God; you
learn to look within, for power. You learn the law of right
thinking governs your life entirely. One must keep evolving,
for if you are satisfied, you are at a standstill In order to
contact life fully, one must seek each moment to express life
fully. Have a desire for this, then your great urge will be
to push onward and upward toward a greater path of light.
When you start for the promised land, the land of dark
ness must be forsaken, forgotten —we must leave the dark
and start toward the light.
For the science of forgetting is: we must forget the things
we do not wish to remember, and remember only the things
we wish to retain, and know "the deep things of God are the
real things of life here and hereafter."
I have written this book in such a manner as to convey a
lesson of realism in every page.
It should be studied, as one would mathematical problems,
for each time one reads and premeditates, as they read, there
will be gleaned from its pages, clearer and a more compre
hensive understanding of each problem or lesson. I would
suggest, where a statement appeals to one with more validity,
they have a pencil and paper and write it down. That it
may be more completely retained, much profitable study is

INTRODUCTION
The cry ever goes up from human souls, "Show us the
■way, what and where is Heaven?"
They are eagerly inquiring the way to Heaven. Few ever
think of looking within to find it. Ever looking outward
and beyond their reach for the peaceful bowers of Eden.
They are, as you have heard of, a small group of people
out in a ship for days, tossed about without a compass,
finally sighting a large vessel in the distance, sent out a call
for help, saying "We are dying of thirst." Clear and dis
tinct came back the cry across the water, "Let down your
buckets, you are in the mouth of the great Amazon. In the
midst of plenty of fresh water."
For those who have lost the way and are thirsting for
truth, this book is written. For those who long to believe,
but who have hitherto wandered in the vale of the vast ocean
of wonder and doubt, I have endeavored to give to you the
truth of your own power that you may no longer ask,
"Show me the way."
For in it the crooked is made straight, and darkness cleared
away by the fundamental truths so plainly set forth that
those who read may clearly understand and so clothed in its
loving coat, giving the truths to humanity in such a manner,
it renders it invulnerable to the darts of the adverse thinkers.
"We are all on the path to the ascension." It is my duty,
being convinced of a great Truth, that any revelation I re
ceive must be handed on to others; otherwise I am not
filling my obligation to God and Man, or the great cosmic
power of this vast realm of life.
All are here to assist in the great evolutionary plan. As
the light comes, show others the way; that is what you
are here for.
The period of this earth plane is all too short to grasp the
millions of wonderful truths that are here for Man.

16 ON THE PATH
Let down your buckets and drink in the fresh waters of
Divine truths, or when too late you may cry, "I am dying
of spiritual thirst." i
Time is valuable. Take some of your time apart from
material duties and pick up often "On the Path." In it you
will find you are power unto yourself, that can take you on
ward in every venture of life. You will realize the facts
concerning mind, how you can draw to yourself any condi
tion, by creating the corresponding conditions in your con
sciousness.
You will find your life is a simplilcation and reflection of
your predominant thoughts.
When you work in harmony with Divine Law, making
it a part of your daily thoughts and actions, will you enjoy
to the fullest degree, life with its magnanimous possibilities.
You will learn to think for yourself, becoming your own
Great Master Thinker. You will become a mental power
house, knowing how to re-charge the battery daily.
Progression is the law of life. It leads onward for all
who realize they are on the threshold of Eternity, for it is
here and now.
By degrees you reach spiritual advancement, it becomes a
joyful search as you recognize life and truth to be eternal
progression. You are in the procession, push forward, though
the balance of humanity loiter away the jeweled moments,
given them by their creator to improve each talent, that they
may be better able to help others.
Love has been the inspiration that has guided my hand
in this service of the Master, in compiling "On the Path."
I have also been inspired to continue on by the love and co
operation of my beloved Son and Husband, who have been
a great aid in its progress.
My earnest prayer is that the fragrance of its petals may
encourage you to press onward on the path of the Soul's
Evolution, turning often to its pages, to glean from the
petals of truth to sustain and comfort. If only a few Souls
have been aided to see just a little clearer the path all Souls
must travel, my aim has been accomplished.

ON THE PATH
CHAPTER I
PSYCHOLOGY, METAPHYSICS, OCCULTISM
FILLING THE SOUL LAMP
Then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be likened unto ten
Virgins, who took their lamps and went forth to meet the
Bridegroom.
We find throughout this vast earth realm the same condi
tion prevailing today, as the five wise and the five foolish
Virgins. Humanity living and rushing on so fast, they have
no time to seek the higher understanding and knowledge1 of
that which means and is the greatest thing of all—knowing
self. They »re impoverished for they are unprepared, with
out a light to guide them.
This is why you find the great unrest, the inharmony,
the strife and woe. It is from the lack of knowledge of
Divine Laws causing and disturbing the otherwise peaceful
vibrations.
You also find those who are about their Father's business.
Busy with the various problems of trying to help their fel
low man.
They are doing what they can with the talents they have.
They are "keeping their lamps trimmed and burning" with
the purest of oil.
The student may ask what does these ten Virgins with
their lamps and oil signify? And in what manner does it
compare to us?
Jesus spoke in parables, then would interpret to his disci
ples and followers.
The lamps referred to in this particular lesson is your own
soul-self. Have you a soul purified and filled with the pur

est of oil? The oil meaning, "purity, love of charity and
forbearance, that your lamp may be trimmed and burning
"with its Golden Glow of Spirituality." I call your atten
tion here to go within for an introspection. A mental and
soul vision will convince you if you are prepared. God is
no respector of persons, every living soul can have what
they will. You have the keys within your own hands of
self attainment toward "Mastership."
Have you students of truth, cultivated the mind, by glean
ing from all avenues where truth may be found, the fruits
of the Spirit? Go out upon your observation train and gather
the sweet aroma of wisdom and Divine understanding. If
you do, the sweet angel of wisdom is your aid, bearing the
illumined torch lighted by the Christed love. Then your
soul-lamp will always be shining even in darkest night cf
deepest despair, the purified oil of the soul will lead you
through, know then that the soul, when prepared by purifi
cation and enlightenment, will do the bidding of the higher
mind, the mind of God.
Make gbod use of your talents, be they five or but one,
forge forth, be not afraid. Jesus said, "I am with you
always, even unto the end." In this manner you are making
use of the talents or gifts the Master of the household has
given you.
Now we go back to the foolish Virgins who were careless.
They did not prepare for emergencies. They left their lamps
untrimmed and without oil.
Here is where you can look about you on every hand and
find this deplorable condition. Not only materially, but
worse still, spiritually neglectful. Then again, on the other
hand, you find those who work and study hard, putting into
application the knowledge and wisdom gained, profiting
daily by the application of at-one-ment with Divine Law
until they make for themselves success, on all planes of life.
They have, through observation and application, prepared
themselves for the Bridegroom.
Then along comes the foolish Virgin in times of emer
gency, when conditions deplorable pile up thick and fast.
They know not what to do, with no knowledge of nature's
laws—asking for help, although they had opportunities,
many of them, yet they neglected to prepare themselves for
this emergency. They preferred to loiter along by the way

side. There are plenty of this kind. They buried their
talents, thinking it not worthwhile or bother to cultivate
the gifts that would have doubled had they made use of them,
but now they have come to those who have worked long
and hard in preparing themselves for the harvest. "For ye
know not when the oil may be needed."
It is now for the student to learn how to fill their lamps
and keep them filled with the purest of oil. The use of the
occult exercises and breathing are a great aid in raising the
vibration, where you feel the pure inflow of Divine power.
Inhale to the count of 7, then hold while you repeat some
powerful affirmation. Such as (I, a living soul, am filled
with Divine power.) Then exhale to same count of seven;
do this seven times. This raises your vibration quickly,
purifying the mind by discarding all the old worthless matter
of inharmony and dregs, then going into the silence and
communing with the Father. Go carefully and prayerfully
into this silence.
Matt. 6:6. But then when thou prayest, enter into thine
INNER CHAMBER, and, having shut the door, pray to thy
Father who is in secret. Then the Father, the higher mind,
the super-conscious mind, does not need the spoken word,
but sees all the secrets of the soul. Where you let go of all
the material conditions and commune with the Higher self,
you find the sweet aroma of spiritual comfort stealing ovet
you.
Here you receive the beautiful reward of communication
with your Father in Heaven. Then all that is in any way
destructive to the body or mind fall away. You find Health
and Happiness in this vibration; this is purifying of the oil
of the soul—you rejoice and experience in a full measure,
that you are in truth a child of God. Realize as you sit
in the silence and let go of the physical and inharmonious
conditions, that you have filled your lamp, or prepared your
being to receive the Divine inspiration, the inflow of power
and wisdom from the masters of light.
Here is where you will realize just where your supply
house is. Where you learn t'o visualize —reaching outward
and upward into the great universal consciousness. You are
tuning in with the Divine supply house. Receiving your
strength, power and revitalization. You hear the music of

the spheres and the Heavenly voices. If you tune in prop
erly with the universal, you realize your at-one-ment with
the powerful forces of nature; all this is for the student,
when you reach a true understanding of nature's law.
RULE OF SILENCE
Relax —let go, forget you are in possession of a physical
body. "Refer to Matt. 6:6." Be so still that you can hear
the heart beat and feel the pulsing of every atom of your
being. In an incredibly short space of time you will find
you are getting full control of body and mind. (This is
absolutely necessary.) )Then you will find you are becoming
your own great master. This is the key to health and hap
piness. Here is where you will realize your relationship to
the five? wise Virgins.
You find how indispensable is this knowledge of purify
ing and filling your soul lamp, and keeping it filled. Where
you are at all times, prepared for whatever comes along your
pathway. You can truly say, "I am ready. I can meet
it with courage, for I am contacting the Divine Principle,
the Divine supply. I know I have faith that the pure, sweet
radiation of the soul is acquired through work and study. It
cannot be procured with money. I alone must work to
acquire; it. I shall endeavor to stay always near this filling
station, that is the Divine supply house that recharges this
Temple of God, that which keeps my soul lamp trimmed
and lustrous with Divine love.
When the Master calls, "I am prepared. I am ready."
What a glorious awakening to one who has never before
understood the "Tapping of this deific fountain of truth for
their supply." This awakening of the consciousness, is a
grand revelation. To know you can be what you will to
be, to know it all depends upon self alone. Know the
source from which all things come, through your own great
soul development comes this force and power. It depends
wholly upon the student how far they get along the pathway
of understanding, for it is by the application and use they
make of the law.
This law must be conscientiously and lovingly applied
for thought power can be used in many directions, either
good or otherwise. Know the seed you sow will pro
duce the fruit in kind. This must be remembered, if you

sow thistles, you cannot hope to reap rich fruits of the
spirit. The old saying, "As ye sow so shall you also reap"
is entirely true.
Then, dear student, watch your word—make each one
a power as spoken.
Someone has said, "Your thoughts speak so loud I can
not hear what you say."
"Cultivate your thoughts that will produce the right kind
of harvest." Make them go out from your Radio Station
in power and force to work for you, then whoever is tuning
in, will catch the vibrations of upliftment, making them say
a prayer of "God bless you" from their heart.
Keep your receiving station well attuned, your lamp well
filled with the purest of oil that you may be a reflector for
good, then you will be doubling your talents. Becoming a
powerful giver and receiver of light, with the radiation of
the Christ power that who-so-ever may come your way
will feel the Healing Rays as did the woman who touched
Christ's garment and was healed.
"But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant,
and who-so-ever exalt himself shall be humbled and who
shall ever humble himself shall be exalted."
AFFIRMATION OF POWER FOR HEALTH
HARMONY AND SUCCESS
I will become a magnet of love and power. I draw Mag
netic power to me—it surrounds me on all sides, I now am
Health, Harmony and Success.
The Kingdom of Heaven is within me as I realize this
truth, I find my source of Divine supply — through this
truth I am made whole —I am success —all that the Father
has is mine.
Every soul who pours out their love of God to all hu
manity, is increasing their own supply. Freely give —
Freely you receive. You can give only of what you have.

CHAPTER II
RELIGION
If you have what satisfies you in religion put some life
into it.
God never intended you to go around with a long face.
"If you love God (Life) Smile," then you will attract to
you those who are also a pathfinder. But know there is
no easy path to the goal of perfection. At least few have
found it. Some may think they are perfect, but they are
very much mistaken. Some are very much satisfied with the
religion of creeds handed down to them for generations. Are
you? If you are I am sorry for you. We know the famil
iar word KARMA, few know its meaning, but I find it
means work. Religion means work, no one escapes it, al
though it may come in many different forms.
We are working out our life. If done with an under
standing of its laws it will be much easier. Give the soul
freedom, this will give it power to rise above environment,
or conditions, and reach its realization. It is our Divinity,
where we may dring of the waters of life everlasting.
Emerson said, 'Hitch your wagon to a star," but what
star? Are we to believe by this that all the hope, assurance
and faith must be placed upon a certain goal and keep it
there?
Yes, if you are sure it is right, then you have something
substantial to work toward.
The thing to do is forget creeds first, no creed ever has or
ever will take you to a paradise. Although we have been
taught this for generations past.
Religion is principally as the psalmist, who walketh up
rightly and worketh righteousness, who speaketh the truth
in his heart, who neither slandereth or doeth evil, nor taketh
advantage of his fellowman.
Dr. Peebles tells us: "It does not matter what your creed,
race or nationality, nor whether your sabbath is on Sunday
or on Saturday or any other day in the week, or your church

If you do not lose sight of the golden rule, giving bread
to the hungry, comforting the sorrowing, caring for the
afflicted, clothing the naked, knowing you are your broth
er's keeper he says, "It is the deeds, character and ideals and
not the creeds, that determine a person's religion."
The trouble has been too much perplexing and confusing
of theology with religion. Look about you and see the
great number of people of a church trying to persuade
themselves they are religious, yet these same people possess
little religion and ethics. If you have observed closely you
have found there are those who have little understanding of
theology and less observance of formality, have God con
stantly showing in their every action and whose hands are
never weary of good deeds and are every ready with kind
words of love and courage.
Look about you, observe the human race, you find some
surrounded with wealth with luxurious extravagance, in
dulging in pleasures of sense, anything for material enjoy
ment, striving and struggling for high positions in the world
of glitter and tinsel, but what of the soul-man? —nothing
accumulated for Eternity. On the other hand we find those
who are struggling for their daily bread, and many more in
this lowly position. Why are they in the former position?
Are they brighter in intellect and greater in power? They
are greater in power just now because their wealth made
them so. Their intellect may be dwarfed, only to the extent
of making money, but no better as far as soul culture. But
the majority do not think this way. Many do not stop to,
or want to think; they forget all about having a soul in
their present vainglory, and chasing the dollar, or rather
they crush it out by the glamor of gold. "All is not gold
that glitters."
You must learn to renounce personality. We do not
profit by anything of this world. "For what shall it profit
a man if he gain the whole world and lose sight of his soul-
self?" We talk about our knowledge of Jesus, yet we can
be swayed by personal prejudice, discriminating between
wealth and poverty. We want people to be religious, yet
we manifest little of human kindness, expressing little broth
erly love. We talk of religion or salvation, yet are afraid

to come in touch with these who are lowly and poor. Jesus
brought with him the Spirit of love and equality.
"You are your brother's keeper." You must become
fully conscious of this fact. You have the pattern set for
you by the Nazarene. He said, "Sell all thy goods and give
to the poor and come and follow me." Do good to them
that hate and despitefully use you, comfort and cheer those
less fortunate than yourself. When you have learned to do
all these things, you have really hitched your wagon to a
star. This star will shine forth for you, wherever you are,
for it will be as a shining light of hope and faith, that
points the way even as the star in the east, that guided the
wise men to the lowly manger of the Nazarene, to find
the Christ-Child in its purity.
This same Christ-spirit is found within the human soul
when you are cleansed and purified. Through life's experi
ences, which are Gethsemanes, all must go through in their
purifying and cleansing process in the upward journey on
the path to the ascension. So Religion is to the individual
soul whatsoever we make it. Religion is to love, to bind, to
hold together the golden nuggets from the divine fields that
are so rich with spiritual ore.
But much work must be done to mine out and produce
these golden nuggets of true righteousness. Open the win
dows of your soul and let the Star you have hitched your
wagon to shine forth in splendor and beauty to guide your
ship of life safely across the bar to that haven of rest and
peace that is awaiting those who have their feet safely planted
upon the path of "the broad highway of truth" where you
can be a friend and counsellor to all.
GOLDEN DIVIDENDS
Are you searching in foreign fields for the jewels of truth?
Search within your own soul. There you will find Golden
Dividends of precious worth that will last through eternity.
Search the undiscovered fields of the soul. There you will
find the precious wealth untold. The Diamonds of the
deserts the gold of the mountains, are as dross compared with
the riches found within.
Go prospecting out upon your observation train with
your implements, which are prayer and service; then from the

soul will pour the wealth that will be envied by rich and
poor. The wealth of a clean, pure character, burnished and
garnished by deeds of mercy and love for humanity.
Jesus said feed my lambs, feed them with the riches of
the spirit. Light their pathway with the message he left
for you. "Love ye one another." He did not say love a
selected few, but one another. This is where character tells.
Bought not with gold nor silver, but adorned with that
which you can lay up in your safety deposit vault when you
reach the city of everlasting life; what a wealth you will
have to share with others, and by sharing with others in
this life of your storehouse, it multiplies and grows.
"In my father's house are many mansions." Send ma
terial on ahead, that its walls will be studded with gems
from loving service.
If you have followed well after the pattern or teachings
of the Nazarene, you will have no fear of where or what
your future home will be.
Your mind is the steering wheel, guiding you upward to
the heights of spiritual attainment, or it will draw you un
erringly over the precipice.
You can cultivate your mind, that it will be the master
physician. Not only over the physical, but over all mate
rial conditions.
THE LILY BEAUTIFUL
"Consider the lilies of the fields. How they grow. They
toil not neither do they spin; yet I say unto you that even
Solomon, in all his glory, was not arrayed like one of these."
Trust and obey the law. You will then never lose sight of
the guiding star.
Many souls we can compare to' the beautiful water lily.
Did you ever observe one on a stagnant swamp with scum
and slime upon the water, green from stagnation, that even
an insect could not stand the atmosphere of it? Yet here
upon these same stagnant waters, I have seen the beautiful
white lily come forth in all its purity, a thing unsurpassed
in its wonderful symmetrical beauty.
Can you stop in your mad race onward to, you know not
where? Long enough to analyze the how, why, and where
of this thing of beauty? What is the force that produced

out from the degradation and slimy waters, such a wonder
ful thing, the product of nature, God's handiwork?
Many a human soul has come forth from the slums of
great cities who, when getting out therefrom, into the light
of the spiritual atmosphere and purity of divine under
standing, became freed from bondage; released from the
imprisoned thoughts and vibrations of the sewerage of the
mental sea around them, —become cleansed and purged by
a renewing of the mind —or this expiatory process, where
the soul has the power to concieve the glories of the inner
world as well as the outer world.
On emerging from this bondage the soul reawakened, em
bracing this light—love and purity of understanding is
emblematic of the beautiful, pure white lily. The body
must be cleansed and purified and this comes readily with a
purified soul, for your body is the temple of the holy spirit,
and must be a fit dwelling place for God.
Take care of this temple, make it as beautiful as you can,
look your best, then you will not look too good. You find
real joy in the right relationship to God. But the way of
purity comes by way of the cross—all have their Gethsem-
anes and through them find their SAVIOR. It is by the
way of the cross one finds salvation of the soul. They find
purification and realization. The stations of the cross are
many and the journey rough many times, but through trials
and tribulations are found peace at last, for "with no tears,
there would be no rainbows in the soul." These are the
ones that have come out from the swamps as the water lily.
When you walk the road of your Gethsemanes, with a
head high, your soul's experiences burnished and cleansed
through life's pains and sorrows, "It is on this road the
SAVIOR is found," not on smooth, calm and peaceful seas,
but by the way of the old rugged cross, and your burdens
will become lighter as you climb the steep and rough road
to the stations of the cross. We thank God for the resting
places in between for we can again take up our cross and
carry it onward to the end.
You will then find when the last long stretch is finished,
the choir of Heavenly voices singing, "Oh, there will be
glory for me," then you will understand .the old proverb
"No Cross, no Crown." This is being born again.

THE SENSITIVE PLANT
A Soul in the mire and swamp of earth conditions, you
may compare, and find them much as a sensitive plant. You
find this plant coming up through the earth, with its deli
cate foliage. Some one comes along and brushes a leaf and
it droops, another is touched and it droops, but left alone,
it in time will right itself and become normal. Something
touches it again, and it once more droops its beautiful sensi
tive leaves and again in time it rights itself and looks re
freshed and beautiful. Keep disturbing this sensitive plant,
it will finally droop and die.
Just as the soul, so sensitive to vibrations of all sorts,
will survive many downfalls and come up again out of the
mire of earth conditions, but kept too long in this environ
ment and vibration of a low nature, they are completely
swamped and have not the courage or strength to rise again,
and fall to the depths of degradation, shame and despair.
THROW OUT THE LIFE LINE
Here is work for you, for the harvest is long ripe, the
laborers are few, go out into God's great vineyard and gar
ner and glean. The cry goes forth for the reapers to step
out on the fields of SERVICE. This is what you are here
for; for the secret of your SPIRITUAL success and awak
ening is unselfish and loving SERVICE. The master is
asking for you today, "to seek where you may find the lost
sheep."
The shepherd did not seek the ninety-nine sheep that were
safe within the fold; but went out on the hills to find the
one lost sheep. Go into the silence and look within and see,
what do you find there? Are you one of the five foolish
Virgins found without your lamp? Seek ye now the King
dom of Heaven. Through purification, the oil of righteous
living, and doing "unto others as you would that they do
unto you." This is religion, and preparation. Learn to find
your soul center. Stop looking out and beyond self, but
look now within. Here is where you find all you hope to
be. "Are your hypnotizing yourself?" That you are
doing all you can toward your share of carrying on the work
the Master left to be done.

THE CULMINATION OF RELIGION
Not what we have.
But what we use;
Not what we see
But what we choose;
These are the things that mar or bless
The sum of human happiness.
The things near by,
Not things afar;
Not what we seem
But what we are;
These are the things that make or break
That gives the heart its joy or ache.
Not what seems fair,
But what is true;
Not what we dream,
But the good we do;
These are the things that shine like gems,
Like stars in fortune's diamen.
Not as we take,
But as we give;
Not as we pray,
But as we live;
These are the things that make for peace
Both now and after time shall cease.

CHAPTER III
SCIENCE, MAN AND RELIGION
"Remember that though a thousand men agree upon a
subject, if they know nothing about that subject their opin
ion is of no value."
"He who would walk upon the path must think for him
self." (Feet of the Master.)
Go on and upward, seeking out the places where your
vineyard is needing the weeding out of old conditions. Prun
ing away the old dogmas and ideas which have for years
retarded the growth of humanity; let in the clear light and
wisdom of God's purifying and glorified love. For of all
the qualifications the greatest and the one most needed and
the least sought after is love.
Not understanding the laws of God, the masses of people
grope in darkness and superstition. Fearing to branch out
into the great broad fields of light and truth, preferring to
follow in the footsteps of their ancestors rather than venture
into new paths of thought and endeavor. If the human
family were also willing to use the same old implements of
service their forefathers used, where would be the progres
sion we have today? So it is with the great fields of funda
mentalists, fearing to tread on new soil.
The modernists today are seeking the wherefore of things,
what are we here for, whence did we come and where are
we going? It is no sin to search for greater truths than "The
old time religion is good enough for me."
Did not Jesus say, "seek and ye shall find, knock and the
door will open unto you." Seek knowledge and wisdom
but above all get wisdom. We are today standing upon
shallow soil, the crust is thin, and soon it will burst through
and the world will awaken unto a new day, a new age. The
day of investigation is here and a clearer understanding after
two thousand years of dark groveling of "blind lead the
blind."

30 ON THE PATH
The liberalists and students of psychological lore, and
those of scientific minds are discovering that one need not
go far for knowledge-power-healing and soul communion.
The wireless station of the celestial spheres are ready when
a soul who is attuned to God's love and wisdom, is found
to be the receiving station. Many have been found, to be
attuned to this Divine consciousness.
The fundamentalists and non-progressive church members
and ministers, are finding gradually, their platforms are
crumbling under them. The boomerang they have been
hurling at the truth-loving souls, who know whereof they
speak, will surely return unto its own.
For the scientific students know, for they have first-hand
evidence of the truth of immortality of the soul. They have
the proof, that to die, is to live on, always.
The change called death is only laying aside the old gar
ment to put on a new and progressive cloak of immortality.
So the truth is what you want to ask for at all times, and
as you believe you will receive; "ask in faith believing and
it will be given unto you." The highest science and reli
gion is inseparable, but no church has a mortgage, as it were,
on the highest truth and science.
Jesus did not belong to any given church, but to the
brotherhood of man, and fatherhood of God, and no better
rule has been formulated than the one he gave to his disciples
to love one another and their neighbor as themselves and to
do unto others as they would be done by, and by their neigh
bor was meant, all with whom they came in contact and you
know he also said, "The first shall be last and the last shall
be first," meaning that not all that stand in front of the
people and give out voice knowledge, and no service, stand
as high on the Pathway of Light, as some who have not
such a high understanding, but who, in their hearts, are will
ing to do the best they can according to their light and under
standing and who are ever reaching upward and onward
toward the Light at the top of the mountain.
Not all can stand on the mountain top; the light is too
strong and powerful for them, but remember you are needed
just where you are or you would not be there, so brighten
the corner where you are and know that by your loving
service to all that come your way, will you yourself be lifted
to higher and higher knowledge and understanding of the

Brotherhood of Man and the Fatherhood of God. Then be
of good cheer, you in your turn will be able to help someone
else that is groping toward the light of peace, knowledge and
understanding.
My thought and great desire is to awaken within your
minds the desire to co-operate with Divine Law, and learn
the law of love, then you will learn the law of receiving
and giving. "To reap, we must sow." If you hope to reap
health and supply you must be an open channel, for the law
to work through.
Today, you must know, you alone can become your own
master. You can do this only when you learn to accept
the Light of Truth through awakened faculties. Faith steps
in as gradually your mind expands and you comprehend the
vastness of what you, as a human being, are capable of ac
complishing.
STRENGTHENING THE POWER OF THOUGHT
Are you living in discontent and inharmony, making your
own Hell by negative discordant thoughts, or are you living
in a Heaven made by positive masterful thoughts of good
will to all? The choice is yours for the taking. In this
manner you are exercising your own great force of will.
Make silent demand upon the mind that you will become
superior in power and intellect. It is easy to succumb to
the weakness that is ready to hold you down, if the mind
becomes negative; your demand cannot be made too often.
Affirm, "I will arouse myself; I am determined to de
velop power, faith and strength of will, to express love and
take an interest in humanity. I will be interested in others'
joys, and their life's expression as well as my own." "Freely
give—freely you receive."
You will never be happy by living for self and its grati
fications alone. It is only as you share with others that you
are happy.
When you begin to be interested in another's success or
pleasure as well as your own, then you will learn the give-
and-take plan.
You will wonder why this has anything to do with health,
with wealth, with religion. It has all to do with it. Only
as you live and love and be for others, are you radiating

healing colors of yellow rays.
Open the windows of your soul and express the joy and
love that is hidden within. In this manner you keep in the
high-rate vibration where you will find you are drawing
value received, your physical wellbeing will be wonderfully
benefited, also material conditions will adjust themselves
for you.
Try it, and I will guarantee you get twice the work from
your employees, and you will have the self-satisfaction of
knowing you have the good will and respect of everyone.
This is where you get satisfaction out of living, even though
your work may be strenuous and hard.
There is really a joy in knowing you are liked, did you
know it? Yes you do. It gives you an incentive to live on
and work for others. You love to be near the ones you
know respect and love you. All this brings you into the
rate of vibration where you are tuning in on the Radio
Activity of other minds, this brings you also into success
vibrations. Like attracts like, just as the magnet attracts
steel, the waves of good thought vibrations are attracted by
others of the same wave length.
You grow rich in power as you give. Your talents will
increase, your power develop, health and happiness will be
your rich inheritance, "For love paves the way, it lights the
path that leads to supernal heights of knowledge and Divine
Wisdom." Do not linger with those who are dealing with
discord, hate and inharmonious vibrations. Find your place
among those who are courting the High Priestess Divine
light and love of truth. If love becomes your ruling star,
your every act, naught can come to harm you. Then be
sure your wagon is hitched to the right star, the star of hope.
Breathe the air of love always, see in everything you do
the touch of love: the vibrations around you which form
the aura will then be a blending of harmonious love color
ing. Nothing that is best for you will be withheld.
Health and success will sing a song of peace in yenr soul.

SCIENCE, MAN AND RELIGION
Science has conquered time and space. The world has
been going forward in the last fifty years in leaps and bounds.
In every endeavor from underground and subterrannean,
conquering air, time and space.
Out to the distant nebulae in space. Science h»s found the
means of photographing the heavens satisfactorily. Man,
through Science, "has found in the vo»texian currents in the
nebulae — Their results in the Formation of Runs — The
formation of Aerolites in the Solar Envelope —*he condens
ation of Aerolites into Planets — The Sun, the Mother of
Planets—the Electric Force, the generative source of Forms
from the Primordeal Substance of Nature —Its manifestation
in Magnetism in Planetary bodies. Polarity of Magnetism
the basis of Form in the three dimensions as seen in crystals,
cells and their resultants. Life forms one of these resultants,
—Electric Energy the basis of all living structures in Plan
etary bodies. Living Bodies capable of the reproduction of
new species through Electric Energy and new arrangements
of cellular structure by changes of Environment —Planetary
changes the natural sources of Evolutionary development
from primitive forms." On upward to the perfect develop
ment of Man—Physically.
When it comes to the development of the Spiritual man,
he is not much better and no happier, that I can see, than in
past centuries of less developed state and almost as barbarous.
When they yet take a life for a life, when wrong has been
committed, something is radically wrong with the thoughts
of the race. The old, but never worn out saying, "Man
know thyself" is far from being practiced.
It is very important today that man begins to develop
his soul nature or spiritual faculties, that this great old world
with its fast progression may be handled by capable minds
and developed souls with understanding of how to work
and co-operate with the invisible power and forces of nature,
and with the love of God awakened.
Many may laugh at this statement; but it is entirely true,
it is only those who have lost sight of Jesus' teachings

through commercialism, greed, forged-power for self and
power over others, to the extent that their souls are warped
to the real Truth, for they have no time to think of the real
man, the majority have lost sight of this being which is the
God within. This greatest commandment, he left: "Love
ye one another," but how many do?
Stop just a moment now and then, to be still and listen
to God's voice speaking to your soul. There is no use try
ing to camouflage yourself, for no one can hide from the all-
seeing eye of God, no matter how persistent they try.
Are you who have plenty, looking about you to see where
you can help someone else, or have you time? If not, there
will come a day when you will have to part with it all. Then
go out into the unknown realms to explore and try to find
the lost Soul that you would give all you have possessed to
find.
This is where there is nothing to take with you to what
seems the far country, but your character: it alone will
speak for your passport, whether it will be a reserved seat in
the front rows of the Heavenly spheres above or a seat in
the back gallery.
Will you think? If you will, I am repaid for this is my
desire in giving my services, to endeavor to awaken the
sleeping consciousness of the Christ within; attempting to
reach some of God's people by this method.
If I reach only a few Souls—quickening their conscious
ness to see and learn of the high road to Spiritual Progress,
then I have acquired that which I sought to accomplish.
Christ said, "I come not to save the righteous, neither am
I seeking those who already know the path, but only those
who are yet blind, and are desirous of finding the way, do
I hope to touch their eyes of the soul, that they may have
the magnificent beauty and joy that are theirs for the taking
for there are none so blind as those who will not see or
try to understand God's truths."
I know my effort will not be lost for the power that is
given me to pen these thoughts, are Christened by annointed
power that I may give in as far as I am unfolded in Christ
consciousness to you, "God's children," the Divine message.
This is why I am trying to teach your minds to think, to
know what it means to think, to know you can cultivate
your thoughts where you can be anything you wish to be.

Awaken from this apathetic influence, while you have
plenty of time, to think things out for yourself.
"Your thoughts will take you to the heights or the depths."
Remember you are far on the path when you become ac
customed to this method of thinking scientifically.
A candidate on the path will learn they are in a great
measure responsible for the well-being of those about them.
If you haven't made the world better or brighter than
you found it, you are living in vain. Have you rescued a
Soul from the brands of the burning? Have you learned to
look always for the best in others? Given the best you had
always? Made some Soul really happy? Helped to laugh
away fears? Loved all others, knowing they also belong to
God's great family? Have you tried to improve each shin
ing hour? Working to fill up the vacant spaces in the
brain with knowledge and wisdom? Gleaning from obser
vation and study, with malice toward none? Knowing all
are on the path with you, that some are ahead, some behind
you, but all equal as to spirit. If you have observed well
these formulas, you will leave behind you a benediction and
find awaiting you a beautiful home by the material sent
ahead —this is science and religion.
We know timber is not used until well seasoned. Earth
life is a seasoning time, also, you gain knowledge as you
meet the many experiences on the path, and only can you
give an assured knowledge when you have received it first
hand.
"Wisdom is the principal thing, therefore get wisdom: and
with all thy getting, get understanding. She will give to thy
head a chaplet of grace. A crown of beauty will she deliver
to thee."
"Dost thou love life? Then do not squander time, for
that is the stuff life is made of."—Franklin.
When once you are awakened to Truth's call, your con
stant cry will be—"Show me the way." For your greatest
joy, will be in loving service. You will find service is
power.

children of God, then they can lay all actions, like flowers,
on the altar of God."
As the candidate gets well on the Journey's path; on
survey will find the realization that the obligations are at
least partly met.
Then we shall escape from reactionary bondage, and all
the actions we perform will lead us towards freedom, even
in this life.
"Beneath the blue of azure sky,
We sow our seed upon life's hill,
These quiet, silent seed will wake,
Obedient to the soul's awakened will."
It matters not what you sow or whether you are con
sciously or unconsciously aware of the fact you alone must
reap or bear the fruits of it.
Opportunities are never lacking, but one is not always
ready to profit by them. If you do all you can with the
present, make the best possible use of it, you will not then
hamper your progression.
If you live in the present, the very best you can, then
your future will be secure; it will take care of itself; today
is all you or I are sure of.
Why then trouble the Soul, with worrying over the
future? You have lived up to the present, in some way
or another; perhaps as well as you could under the condi
tions.
If your path has been a rough one, you have no doubt
disobeyed some natural law of the Universe; ignorance of
the law excuses no one; do not try to shirk your life's duty
by courting death, neither try to draw upon yourself destruc
tion by the works of your hands.
"Because God made not death, Neither delighteth He when
the living perish." For righteousness is immortal. A great
error is committed when one deliberately severs the cord that
binds them to this physical. Drawing to themselves, far
greater suffering by the act for they are here for a purpose
and that is growth, or Soul development."
Trying to avoid their Gethsemanes prolongs their growth
on, evolution's train.

Have faith, recognize no lack or limitation, but know
your relationship with Divine supply will provide what you
need.
Observation and experience lead you to know the great
Universal Truth of Things. If you want perfect expression
of abundance on all planes you must early on the path be
gin to build through your own great thought forces per
sistently hold onto your desires, recognizing no limitations.
"Ask and ye shall receive." There is no limitation in
this promise. You must hold fast to Faith and know that
everyone born upon this great planet is heir to the best that
the world can give.
"All that my Father has is mine," the Master Teacher
said. He who is fully conscious of this law, receives from
the universe their portion of the substance which is needed
to perfect, round out and prepare their selfhood for the next
state of existence. You are joint heirs with God. Every
one is born heir to the best, that the world can give. Know
you are in the center of unlimited Supply, and apply it to
your needs.
. "If you are always
Good and true
Naught but the best
Can come to you."
You become a magnet and draw to yourself your own.
You become like that you think; everyone is more or less
a sponge absorbing from their surroundings. Live the life
so the atmosphere around you will vibrate as a finely at
tuned instrument, in perfect harmony and rhythm.
"With wisdom there came to me all good things together,
and in her hands innumerable riches. To think upon her
is perfection, and he that watcheth for her sake shall quickly
be free from care."—Solomon.
We are now living in a new age. Many are realizing
their object and aim must be to elevate the race, not to
leave millions ignorant, neglected, abused, or feel they are
seemingly lost. What are we here for, but to help others?
It is not to gain honor, fame, and a material harvest, but
for service in the masters vinyard.
The Spiritual side is of far greateT importance. What

one put their whole heart and soul to earnest endeavor to
serve struggling humanity with the inspiration gleaned from
the higher laws which are hidden from the majority of the
race through ignorance. Only through misunderstanding
of causes and effects, of Universal principles necessary to our
everyday life, of energy, power, force and polarity and the
many beautiful treasures hidden in our nature, our real self —
the individuality—the I am.
Many are searching for lost and unknown continents, these
many years, following the minds and ideas of others. Fail
ing to discover their own possibilities. Learn to affirm the
/ am. In this manner one builds a solid foundation for the
Temple in which the spirit dwells; and a new condition will
soon manifest. The race must learn of the power within.
A new world will be discovered, and when explored, will
give untold treasures to the mind of man.
God wants all to be equal. It is the character and the
thoughts harbored within, that make men what they are.
It matters not what color or race you are. Everyone has
a perfect right to exist here and now in peace and plenty.
The explorers on the path are striving to learn and compre
hend the purpose of this existence.
The aspirations of the majority are for advancement;
reaching out for either material or spiritual gain, seeking
freedom from bondage. What is needed is the recognition
of, and surrender to the God or the I am within, then you
will know to worship God is to serve God in Man, and you
are responsible only to this Soul-self or God within.
It has taken centuries to bring about the present stage of
evolution and it will rest with the present age, how long
before this planet will become a Paradise.
"Sacrifice and service" will draw the world into quick
recognition that all are his brother's keeper.
Kindness lifts the shadows. Try today to disperse the
gloom for some Soul. An unselfish act, means more than
you may realize, not only to the recipient, but to yourself.
Do not let pride stand in the way. You may regain a life
long friendship by going a little more than halfway—for
no one wishes to have enemies. We love to be loved, don't
we? Everyone does, altho many do not like to admit it.

Too many sacrifice a friend to gain selfish ends, but this
cannot be a permanent gain. Appreciate your friendships by
treating them as you would wish to be treated.
Jesus said, "Love them that hate you and despitefully use
you." When you have gained self-mastery, you will find
this not so hard to do. Realize they are on the path along
with you, for experience and development. Think as kindly
as you can toward them. Surround yourself with the Christ
atmosphere, then you will attract good currents. Becoming
a receiving station for the Infinite power to flow through.
The deeds done in the body, are seeds sown in the furrows
of time, where the harvest of eternity appears.
"He prayeth best who understands God's greatness best."
"We must not forget that we live now to live again.
Every one has his mission to perform. It is our duty to
search and find it. Each bird has its song to sing, each flow
er its gentle mission, each poet his lesson of the good and
beautiful —each philosopher his contribution of discoveries,
and every teacher his sublime instructions; each is a Mes
siah of some great thought and will breathe it forth before
he leaves the form." —A. J. Davis.
Impatience and relative conditions fill one's thoughts to
the exclusion of the will and of the positive thoughts one
would choose otherwise.
"Have the consciousness of your Divine Guidance and
the realization that you are following in His steps." With
your Soul illumined with Divine Truth, you can keep all
negative thoughts that become things, if held long enough
in the mind, away. Look deep within the wells of thy
heart. Do not accuse yourself of anything, but know you
are a Christ in the making. Eternity is before you, live the
Christed life of goodness and uprightness. You will then
love and be loved for what you really are, not what you
seem to be. This love will draw a circle, and keep none
out, but a circle that will keep all in with love in the watch
tower.

CHAPTER IV
PERSONALITY AND POWER
In this life there is always an indwelling desire for some
thing. We long for strength, power, conquest, fulfillment
and deep down in the heart all long for love.
Two persons may be seated beside each other in a street
car, drawing room or business place. They are breathing
the same air; they are perhaps in equality the same, but one
may radiate forth much greater force and power than the
other.
Everyone is sending out some radiation from their per
sonality, although, some seem to give very little.
To possess a charming and strong personality, one's aim
must be unselfish, this reigning feature is the giving plan,
ninety per cent, need to create, and cultivate this art of living.
Break the shell that has formerly seemed to hold you under
some overmastering influence and reach out into the great
universal where you find the inexhaustible supply. For ex
pansion, learn the necessity of thinking right, then you will
find rapid growth and the days will be filled with happiness
and the exhilaration of living will be your reward.
These two persons we have spoken of as sitting beside each
other, one can be in Heaven, the other in Hell, all created by
the power of thoughts they may be thinking at the time.
This is where one must learn the fine art of scientific
thinking, living a fuller and much freer life, becoming hap
pier because you learn the art of giving well, as you live,
projecting Divine Truth into daily living.
This is how you can organize your life to make your
fondest dreams a reality.
Living unselfish lives, becoming interested in those whom
you daily contact, will bring an entirely new condition in
your daily life. Becoming a radiant and soul-inspiring in
dividuality. Making a personality an assemblage of grace
and loveliness, that no one can deny.
One must make a thorough study of constructive psychol
ogy to gain these wonderful traits of character.

All can possess them and much more. Plenty of con
structive work is necessary, but all is invokingly interesting
to the student who is consciously striving to gain the heights
of unfolded beauty of personality and the shining light of
the Christ within.
From my own personal view, life is tremendously worth
while, for life is one great opportunity, to really do things,
but it is best to have a definite aim, one that can be so in
spiring that nothing but death can deprive you from attain
ing. With this aim or goal, ever in the foreground of your
consciousness, you are then visualizing, building and creating
all the way through.
One would go backward if they did not desire or will, we
want to have clear desires, know what we want. Too many
have a hazy or lazy desire that gets one nowhere.
Just know you are born to create something great and
worth while. If you know your own power, you will have
poise. Calm knowledge is the power back of the machine
that is the creator of your greatest aim or Desire.
There is stored within the sub-conscious mind treasures
untold, for it is really the chemical laboratory of your being.
We are told that only 2 per cent of a person sleeps. 98
per cent is your sub-conscious mind that never sleeps. Give
your desires and aims to the sub-conscious which is ever busy
for you when you ask it to perform a duty. Know it will
do it. Know that your ideals are the dreams that will come
true. Do not be afraid, for it is fear that holds you back
from bringing into realization your ideals. Just find the
right thing, don't try to do the things you know you can
not do. Know your great and noble desires come from
within. Your ideals are ever struggling for fulfillment.
When retiring, ask the sub-conscious to get busy and work
for you while you sleep. Rebuilding your physical body and
bringing into manifestation the things needed for your
growth here in this expression.
Do not make the mistake there is any separation, there is
none, all is one continuous life of progression here and here
after.
Here again I say to you, the universe is made by receiving
and giving. Keep your personal power radiant, by this open
avenue, keep constructive thinking well in the foreground

of your mind. Destructive thinking is Hell. Constructive
thinking is Heaven. This I would make clear to you and all
who have stopped in their mad rush downward. By this
destructive method of thinking, you will readily observe this
is absolutely true. Change your thoughts, then you imme
diately put into motion the machinery that will alter your
conditions. Today you may be out of tune, tomorrow in
tune with the Infinite by constructive thinking.
Begin to study the present and the future, then you will
not hate the past, but will realize all is the working out of
the soul's salvation. You're on the path with millions of
others. It is a long, hard climb but a profitable one to the
soul.
We all have testing out times. No one can ever escape in
their progressive path of Soul's Evolution.
Then do your duty well, when it comes to you on the
path. Praying for strength, never doubting, nor grumbling,
for if God sent his angels, or a master to earth, to do a duty,
they would know it was the place they must fill just at that
time. Then learn to become master of conditions by the
example that Jesus taught of loving sacrifices.
If all could but know the truth, they would all try to do
and be as the master taught, the secret of social peace and
fellowship through the example of his golden rule formula,
which will never fail. Then your personality will radiate
with the light of the Christ consciousness, with power, the
connecting link between you and the Father of light.
With simplicity and fidelity, keep his glorious image al
ways in advance of you on the path, caring not for the
hardships, but living the life in the faith the Christ taught,
passing on through the ages, as time goes on, with your face
pressing onward toward the light of the sun that never sets —
the sun of righteousness.

CHAPTER V
EMOTIONALISM, POISE, POWER
Emotion stops the activity of the stomach and causes in-
harmony in all the organs of the body. In fact emotion has
killed many times, observation teaches—anger causes sick
ness. Many times very bad headaches are caused from be
coming angry, the mental is disturbed, therefore the thoughts
poison the whole anatomy.
If you want this physical house complete, and beautiful
in itself, you are the only one that can make it so; just as
you are the one that suffers when you let the bars down,
letting go of the will, here you find discord, sickness and un-
happiness.
Learn to control the mind, you are the master, make it
obey you; if you do not, you know the old saying, "If we
dance, we must pay the fiddler." This is true in all we do,
we are forever reaping the effects of a cause, created by our
own making. Shakespeare said, "There is nothing good or
bad but thinking makes it so." You will see then that it is
necessary to have full control of your temper. (Thinking
rules the emotional).
Good temper, or we will say poise and evenness of mind,
creates for you a body and soul of sweetness and whole-
someness inside and out. It matters not what may touch
your soul and tear it asunder, if you can keep an even mind,
through it all and "keep silent," you alone have gained the
victory. It makes no difference how much the party of the
second part may storm and rave, you are the master, for re
member this always, things hurt you just to the extent you
let them. Think this over well in your silent meditation
hour, then when returning again into the material world of
things you will be master of circumstances. Try it out the
first opportunity you have. There will be plenty of chances
to practice it, for we have many testing out times, as if
tried by fire; then if once you conquer and curb your emo
tion you can do it again and again. Through this persis

tent practice you soon will be having full control of your
self and will rejoice and be glad, for this is one of the great
est victories over self and your emotions.
Occult Students must, early on the path, study well to
accomplish this great achievement; unless you can, you will
never be an occultist.
Read the lives of the old Masters, then you will see where
and how they learned self mastery.
FEAR EMOTION—NEGLECTED OPPORTUNITIES
You will find those who are very emotional, are forever
getting out of harmony, usually they are possessed with a
manU of fear. Job said, "The thing I feared has come
upon me."
In this manner of thinking they are drawing to them
selves the things they least desire. (Every candidate that
seeks self Mastery, must learn to curb their emotion.) This
is a long, laborious climb but when they finally reach the
realization on the path, all power in the Heavens or earth
are waiting for recognition and unfoldment within
himself. They will find what has seemed a lost art, has
been resurrected through the knowledge of the wonderful
manipulation of the law.
Through Divine Law you learn when emotionalism and
fear are well curbed; you will readily find where you can
begin the process of controlling disease and exercise chief
authority over environment, conditions and circumstances,
demanding health and success. (For your mind is the mas
ter physician.) This is curbing emotion.
Becoming poised and self centered through concept of the
will, or the power of thought force, this is self mastery. All
this can and must be gained through self alone. No one can
reach this height for you; only can you reach the top of the
highest peak by this one path. Slowly but surely will you
reach it, if you keep going step by step, onward and upward.
Why so many fail to reach the extreme heights, where
they can get the evidence first hand, they let the great oppor
tunities slip past them, thinking it not worth the bother.
"The golden moments in the stream of life rush past us,
and we see nothing but sand. The angels come to visit us.

EMOTIONALISM, POISE, POWER 45
and we only know them when they are gone." — George
Elliott.
How true this is, we cry when too late, of lost opportu
nities. Here is a great lesson of lost opportunities in this
little story I once read of twin brothers. Each had a
way of their own. Ted was the ambitious one, alive to
everything around him; when he was not busy at his studies,
he was building castles in his imagination of the great things
he would do some day. While Tip with his studies never
finished, would play baseball or football until it was too
dark to see.
A favorite uncle passed away and left the boys the bulk of
his large fortune.
On finishing school Ted took good care, his money was
put to good use, going to college and studying to be a phy
sician, the rest of his sioney he had a lawyer invest it where
it would bring the best results.
While Tip with a don't care air, of what the future may
bring, said be would see the world first and settle down
afterwards to work.
So the brothers bade each other goodby and went their
separate ways. Years passed. Ted became a successful sur
geon at the head of a large hospital.
One day there was carried into the hospital a drunken in
jured wreck of what was once a man, money all gone, health
gone, also that which carries men through the greatest storms
of life, character, and upon the white bed of the hospital
ward, he opened his eyes to look upon the face of his manly,
stalwart brother.
Breathing hard he grasped his brother's hand, saving,
"If I had another chance I would follow in your footsteps,
but that chance is now gone. Oh! To erase the pages of
the past and start upon a new book, but it is too late."
We see all through life, as we turn the pages, lost oppor
tunities and in this little story of the brothers, we find nearly
every day the same thing enacted in real life.
We wonder why humanity does not profit more by others
experiences, permitting them to be a stepping stone to fur
ther their growth in an easier manner, but all must have their
own life's lesson.

46 ON THE PATH
No one escapes, it seems, even the ones who appear to get
by, when you touch their inner life, you find they too have
their Gethsemane.
Search as you will, there is no easy road to mastership, no
one at least has found it, yet you can, through controlling
your emotions and learning the law, help yourself greatly in
the controlling of your destiny. Jesus the Christ did not
find it an easy road, yet he knew the great law. His life was
not all sunshine by any means. For he had many burdens
to carry, for his people.
Go onward, along the path
The master trod.
With cheerful song,
The night may be long
And dreary.
But with morning,
Comes the day,
Of light and eternal Truth,
If you watch, work and pray.

CHAPTER VI
KINGDOM OF HEAVEN
You find the Kingdom of Heaven through poise and
calmness of soul, but you must work daily to keep in this
Kingdom. It is yours, if you earn it. First you must become
loving, sacrificing and considerate of others. It will not be
hard to discard the old pleasures for the new, for you will
not care for the former, when you see and know there is a
light that shines brighter for you. The old things pass away.
New conditions are made, through the change of vibrations.
Jesus said, "You must become as a little child if you hope
to reach the Kingdom of Heaven."
Is this hard for you to do, dear ones? Not when your
soul is filled with love, for with it all things are made easy
and possible.
The light that shines bright as the sun, the sun of right-
ousness will surround you, the radiations of its rays, will burn
the barriers of all inharmonies. You will vibrate on the plane
away from the mire of earthly thoughts and conditions, there
you will feel the poise and peace "that passeth understand
ing."
"You must work out your own salvation," by what
ever means comes to you on the path and never lose sight of
the fact that you are your brother's keeper.
Labor in the vineyard, where the harvest is waiting for
you, "whatever you sow, you must reap," but it depends
upon the seed, whether it is the choicest, or whether it is a
mixture of undesirable seed. Look within and take an in
ventory of yourself. What kind of soil have you there?
This must be prepared first of all—Pray this prayer for
light and purification.
"May the great intellectual light of the great minds of
spirit inspire my mind with knowledge and wisdom. Breath
into me the essence of thy great truths, that I may likewise
give to others the knowledge and wisdom I receive."

48 ON THE PATH
Perhaps yesterday the sensitive strings of Thy soul were
out of tune. The strings were running down from neglect
or carelessness. Therefore, there was discord and inharmony
playing upon the sensitive strings of thy being, everything
that touched you effected you in a disagreeable manner, the
vibrations around you were low, from lack of strength and
power to harmonize yourself with conditions physically or
mentally and the greatest lack was spiritual harmony. Per
haps you see nothing pleasant in your surroundings. You
are spiritually blind to it all for there is no one so blind
as those who will not see.
But today comes, you are in the same house, the same
people surround you, the sunshines just the same, the same
flowers are sending out their glorious perfume, the soft
breezes blow their fragrance to you, no change in anything,
but self, all is now attuned in perfect rhythm. You know the
law, of cause and effect, so you get busy putting into appli
cation this law.
First what do you do? You begin to empty out the old
thoughts that have come in uninvited when the bars were
down. Coming from you know not where. Netative thoughts
that you would not think of inviting to dwell in your house.
You demand them to leave your consciousness immediately
and to aid them to depart quickly. You begin to breath
deeply from your solar plexus to the count of seven, rais
ing your arms above your head, as you slowly count your
seven, at the finish of the count, hold breath firmly in solar
plexus, with arms straight above the head; while you carry
this positive and powerful affirmation.— -"This body is the
temple of God. —This mind is the Mind of God, —and I
demand it to think only thoughts of purity and love.—I am
a child of the living God." —Then slowly lower arms, as
you do so exhale breath to count of seven, keeping the mind
centered well upon the Solar Plexus.
By the time you are through with the seven counts, your
Solar Plexus, or the King Brain, (many occultists and teach•
ers call it) will relax and take its rightful place. You will
feel an exalted adoration for all. The atmosphere or vibra
tions will be entirely changed. Why? Because you are now
vibrating in a high rate vibration where everything is en
tirely altered through thought vibrations.

KINGDOM OF HEAVEN 49
The instrument has been re-attuned and has reached the
ascending scale into this exalted state through thinking,
breathing, exercising, and now the instrument is playing in
perfect harmony to the perfect rhythm of God in nature.
One of the first things to do now, when you have reached
this high state in the vibration, is to radiate your love and
good will which you are now permiated with, outward to
the world. Remember God is no respector of persons. You
must be the same, take in and encircle the whole world in
this love vibration, then it will be well distributed.
Cor. 13:3. "Though I bestow all my goods to feed the
poor and though I give my body to be burned, and have
not love, it profiteth me nothing."
Robert Browning says, "Love is the only good in the
world. Henceforth be loved as heart can love, or brain di-
vise or hand approve."
If the world had that which Divine love truly represents,
there would be no paupers, neither would there be million
aires, made through the downfall of another, all would be
doing their best to eliminate physical and mental suffering
of the human family. This is imperative.
Not only living and permitting others to live also, but
living and helping others to live, as you would desire to
live, this is a puritanical order of thinking that will help to
revolutionize the race.
"THE SUPPLY HOUSE"
You find the Supply House is the creative force, or Di
vine Law, where you tap the Well Spring of power in giv
ing and receiving.
You must observe and practice this law by making appli
cation daily. It is by experience, work and study, you
acquire knowledge and by slow stages you learn the opera
tive ability of the law. It then becomes a part of you.
This may seem a long, hard road to travel toward mas
tership, but it is a Divine road, when you finally get upon
it, you will discover magnificent dividends, with natural
law, your gmiding star. It will lead you correctly, it never
fails. If anything goes wrong it is you that makes the mis
take, God's laws are ever the same.

50 ON THE PATH
Go carefully step by step up the Spiritual Alps, starting
on the very lowest round, no half-way up to the top start
ing will do, one must begin at the basic principles. As you
climb, take all you can with you. "Do not forget the law
of compensation, as you give, so shall you receive," it will
not retard your progress, but rather you will find it hastens
and aids your growth and understanding. You will be build
ing your corner-stones and foundation more securely by un
selfishness. "You cannot live by bread alone." This is the
key to all success.
"Lead and be lead" is the road to victory.
Selfishness is the quick fire that burns the rounds of the
ladder of progress ahead of you. Keep the door of your con
sciousness closed, that no selfish spirit of envy or malice can
creep in, for these are the enemies that undermine your Holy
Temple.
Be glad of others progress, for when you get to the place
where you can be just as pleased to see another's success as
you are your own, then you have cleansed your Temple of
all Selfishness, by love and devotion for your fellow man
you are keeping your soul lamp well filled with the purest
of oil and receiving daily spiritual strength.
Never disturb the vibrations with strong emotionalism.
For health is found through the law of calm, peaceful vibra
tions. Talk to yourself, speak peace to thy soul, see that it
obeys thy will, and that the vibrations remain undisturbed.
The important factor is to think right, keep your thoughts
purified, then your soul will be filled with love for all hu
manity, you are sure then of radiating light and power, this
is one of the chief stepping stones to perfect health, happi
ness and success, for then you are on the ascending scale,
you have a spiritual crutch that helps you over the rough
places that are in every pathway, sometime in life.
Love is the great Healer, the Physician. Take a goodly
dose of it on arising in the morning by breathing deeply from
the solar plexus, at the same time filling the body and mind
with the thought force of love, for you must have it before
you can give.
If you have negative thoughts of doubt or discourage
ment, as you are bound to have, if you let the bars down, to
receive them, you will find, most anything can enter your
consciousness unawares.

KINGDOM OF HEAVEN 51
You must build a wall of protection, by following the
laws of nature, then when something comes in to disturb or
distress your peace and comfort you will be able to desolve
it by the knowledge of your own awakeaed soul. Go often
into the deep introspection, and there you will find your
own failure, and know you can perfect every limitation.
You will find there the Goddess of love, who sits in the
Heavenly Kingdom within and in the silent chamber of the
new Jerusalem, in devoted service you can apply the Key of
Love.
Each one must manufacture and mould their own key, no
two seem to have quite the same gift or understanding, just
as no two people are moulded alike in personality, individu
ality or temperament. (Give thanks to the Infinite Intelligence
of the allness of the all for your realization of this truth).
Know that the gates of the New Jerusalem are invitingly
ajar, you need only to apply the key to enter into the quiet
restful nooks; drinking at the fountain of knowledge and
healing power.
Let your deep abiding love, your aims, aspirations and
longings be always pointing upward, never look down
ward. Press onward toward the Hills of Truth, knowing
every miss step was a lesson for you, but you must be going
onward if you hope to reach the goal of Mastery. Please
do not waste time in thinking of your wasted opportunities,
but rather see your duty in life, doing that duty to the best
of your ability, identify yourself with the Master of Light,
doing his bidding today, then tomorrow will care for its own.
Then pressing onward, do not stop long in any one har
bor, for the barnacles to attach themselves to your ship of
life. Keep sailing on and on, gathering greater power as
you float toward this New Jerusalem that awaits you.
Labor is life, the still water faileth.
Idleness ever despaireth, bewaileth;
Keep the watch wound, for the dark rust assaileth;
Flowers droop and die in the stillness of noon;
Labor is glory! the flying cloud lightens;
Only the waving wing changes and brightens;
Idle hearts only the dark future frightens;
Play the sweet keys wouldest thou keep them in tune.
FRANCIS ASGOOD.

52 ON THE PATH
(When you have gained self Mastery. You have gained
the greatest art).
Emotional people are forever crying self-depreciation and
discouragements.
The more you study and make application of the laws
as you travel the path, the greater will be your blessing.
This is true in all walks of life, be it material or spiritual
understanding. Put the very best you have to the front,
you will never be disappointed, no difference how small the
task, but will reap a rich harvest for you have sown good
«eed and cultivated the soil and rich will be your harvest.
This Divine spark, or the God within, makes the dis
crimination, —as you travel the path of progression you de
velop perceptibility and discrimination.
This life is wonderful and beautiful if you will learn to
understand self first, then you can know better how to un
derstand others. There will be many a mountain to en
counter, but you alone must learn the way over or around
it. You must penetrate the "Seeming Mysteries" of the life
on the path, alone.
No need to ask another to do your climbing, they can
show you the way, but you must walk alone for only by
this method can an anetiate gain the proper experience on
evolutions pathway. But what a joy you will find climb
ing the Spiritual Alps, as you go step by step, even with
its initiatory hardships which you are sure to encounter as
you penetrate the depths, for it is only by trials and Geth-
semanes that you grow strong.
Remember it is only by personal experience, you can
place another's feet safely upon the path of knowledge —
that they, too, may reach the summit alone.
This teaches them self mastery. You can teach and di
rect, as the masters of old all down through the ages, but
they also taught the student how to overcome their own
deficiencies.
It is all left to the initiate, how far they get on the as
cending scale. They get out just what they put into it.
They are weighed in the balance and may they not be found
wanting.
What a joy when you reach this great achievement,
REALIZATION. Life then becomes a glad sweet song,
bubbling forth in a fountain of Love.

CHAPTER VII
REALIZATION VIA THE NIGHT SHADES
Before reaching this height you will find your initiation
a long, hard one, with many a rugged cross. Oh! there are
so many rough places to overcome on this path of the Soul,
but it must be so, less you would not appreciate the bright,
sunny, quiet nooks of joy and peace. When you reach
them be encouraged and help others as there are many on
the rugged path with you. If you will but open your eyes
to see.
All traveling as their soul dictates. All in different stages
of progression.
There are those who are tearing down, while others are
building up, all by the process of right or wrong thinking.
You find through close observation of life, when wrong
has been done toward another, when guilt is within, the
soul longs to draw the night shades about them. Well,
they may fear the scrutiny of God's ex-Ray, for they can
hide from those on the moral plane but not from the im
mortal.
When the Christ Light is developed from right thinking
and living, the shades of delight are rolled high and the
rays shines outward from the well-springs of the Soul Life
in helpfulness. For wrong doers fear the light, right doers
rejoice in the light. It is well for each one to turn the
searchlight within and often take an inventory. —See that
your Soul registers the radiations of God's goodness.
Then you will be strong to withstand all the variations
and conditions you must meet on the path. With calm
fortitude you will be better able to solve life's problems, if
they do not seem to meet with your approval; you will
know they are the lessons you need at this particular time
in working out your carmic condition.

54 ON THE PATH
When understanding the Divine Law of things, you will
know "God works in a mysterious way many times his
wonders to perform." Nature's laws brings many great up
heavals on land and sea, also in the lives of his loved chil
dren of earth. (In the final reckoning all is for the Glory
of God).
APPLICATION OF THE LAW
In this you learn to have a creative mind. You discover a
comprehensive understanding of your own power. The forces
and energies of the power of mind you put to work. By
creating for yourself what you need materially, mentally
or spiritually, for you learn to put your thoughts into ac
tive use creating all the needs of life for the pathway is
made easier through scientific understanding of life's great
problems. Today you find science works on everything from
making automobiles to making over your mental faculties
until they become attuned to the Divine vibrations where
you are touched by the universal mind of Spirit, that give to
you the truth from every plane of life, discovering eternal
progression is the evolution of the new age, where every
thing evolves, for in progression there must be a constant
going onward and upward, of giving and taking —for it is as
we give that we grow in greater knowledge.
Each day should have in it something that you can feel
you have profited by, and better still to help another. This
is real achievement that will bring you untold success, for
you cannot grow by living for self. You learn this when
you have reached the plane of realization, for through the
study of Divine Law you soon find it teaches you are your
brother's keeper.
Through it all you find the power of thought governs
your life entirely. The radio activity of the mind is ever
busy doing its work. It is either building for you or de
stroying what you previously have built. Be very careful
of the suggestions you are giving yourself, as well as others,
let them always be constructive.
Through the old method of thinking, many have been
suggested into their graves.
We find a child is easily molded, therefore the sugges
tions given them should be very carefully worded. Their

brain is pliable. Early training in the understanding of the
use of "thot force" should be given them. — This is one
of the greatest things coming in the present age of child
training.
We are forever tuning in on thot force, either con
sciously or unconsciously. Mental telepathy will soon be
universally understood and practiced. Many, today whose
minds are attuned and trained in metaphysical understand
ing of the use of mind can transfer thots to others at
great distances for we have learned distance is no barrier to
It is connecting the radio with this sending station of the
mind. It is universal tuning in.
Many times our thots will instantly think of some friend
and you will immediately say, "Well! I wonder why I thot
of them just at this particular time?" You no doubt tuned
in with their thot of you at the same time. I have thot so
strongly of friends until I would say, "I will call them over
the phone." When in a short time the door bell would ring
and there stood the one I had been thinking so forcibly of.
So we find our minds when developed in the understanding
of nature's laws today, are a human radio or broadcasting
station.
When fully realizing this fact, one can do universal good
on both planes of life.
If you are a teacher or healer, here is where you can help
others whom you think of at a distance, as their thot
touches you in mind to mind. Send out over the Radio ac
tivity of your mind, a God Bless you, whatever their need,
if any, this will readily touch them. As a teacher we never
know when we may be called mentally. Since the Radio has
come into universal use we find it is like the music, lectures,
etc., that we realize is in the air all the time, but unless we
tune in we are not conscious of it. Our minds must be
attuned to catch these finer vibrations whenever needed.
THE ORTHODOX WORLD
We find the orthodox world, as a rule, praying to a God
to teach them how to die, but the metaphysical student
psychologist and the Truth students of the world today,
ask their God to teach them how to live, if you live right,
you will die right. The beginning of death is only real

life. Ask yourself here, "Am I living right?" Take this
personal analysis once each day, and see where you can
improve yourself. There is always room for improvement
in every one, look for the good always, and you will be
sure to find it. If you go out looking for trouble, you are
mighty sure to discover it also.
We build our own world by our thoughts —is yours
beautiful or at variance by inharmonious thinking. For as
you think so are you. Think, so that your surroundings
may be as God's flower garden. Watered and cultivated by
loving thoughts and deeds toward your neighbor, your
friends, and better still toward your enemies. Please do not
think you have no enemies. It is said you don't amount to
much unless you have.
Jesus, the Christ, went about doing all the good he could
for everyone, and his enemies murdered him. You all are
Christs in the making. For you are here to help not self, but
others. In helping others, you are benefiting yourselves.
Jesus' greatest commandment was "Love yea one another."
And another, "And as you do it, unto the least of these my
children. Yea have done it unto me."
CARRY YOUR CROSS WITH A SMILE,
FOR NO CROSS, THERE WILL BE NO CROWN.
If you do you will be a real servant in the vineyard for
the Master.
"When the shadows thickly gather, or your days be
fraught with grief and care, you can find some other soul
with a burden—you know well, then, how theirs to share."
Do not shrink from the duty imposed upon you.
We were put here to work out our own salvation. And
the earlier we begin the sooner we will be through. As you
study humanity, you will find no one escapes. If they
shirk their responsibilities, they only prolong their progres
sion.
Excuses may be made to the satisfaction of the human
family, but there is no camouflaging, for you are just as
an open book to the all seeing eye. (Your obligation to
God is your first and last duty.) This demands steadfast
ness, courage, strength and perseverance, it will all be given
you if you but trust him.

You are placed where you are for your earth experience,

—others will take courage from your steadfastness to duty.
Love your duty imposed upon you, if you learn to love
your work, the work grows lighter, every one finds their
tasks grow lighter when they are working for their loved
ones.
Love lifts you out of the depths of the sinking sand and
places your feet upon the pathway of duty. "Love teaches

God knows your strength and just how much you can

alone and all the world go free?"
"No cross, no crown."
All must pay the price some time, some where, to the last
farthering, before entering upon the real satisfying reality
of the path of the soul.
Every cloud will have a silver lining if your heart is filled
with love of duty. Ask only for strength for the day, for
some times the clouds be-dim the skys around us, sorrows
seem to fall, but reach upward in consciousness and prayer,
the light and peace will be given you, and when the clouds
roll away, the sunlight of peace is all the sweeter. "If the
storms never come, we would not realize our blessings."
Can anyone go with me into the memory chamber for a

What do you find there? Is it all joys? All Sorrows? All

but a mixture of all.
In the lives of God's Children, it is said no one is given
a greater burden than they can carry. Take a look as you
lift the shades of night, for a moment, that hides a bleed
ing soul. It may give you a shudder of despair and horror,
yet it must be so. Some need greater lessons than others,
but many is the soul that stands the crucible and lives on,
smiling through, hiding from the world their trials and sor

trials of earth into the real life and find how well you
adapt yourself to your new surroundings.
You will see then, and know why as the daylight of
some joy fadeth into deep night shades of sorrow or sick
ness unto death comes, that God was ever near, for it mat
ters not how far away from home, friends or on the ocean
wild. He speaks in silent and tenderest whispers to you, if
you will but listen for the sound of the still voice of com
fort. Learn to pray, this is your greatest solace in all your
Gethsemanes, bear your own burdens cheerfully, then bear
a portion of your neighbors', soon you will forget your

be intermingled with the more serious things that are needed
on our path to the assention, and the Christ consciousness
will radiate its rays of healing peace and power around you.
Go forth upon your mission, giving and receiving. As
far as you give, so far you receive. We are all weighed in
the balance, to the degree of development. For everyone is
emitting rays of light, this going forth on the vibration will
be reflected back to you, if you are vibrating in gloom, the
atmosphere around you will be saturated with it. Those
who come into your environment will surely be affected.
For gloom, like happiness, is contagious. If we cultivate
happiness, it will grow into a beautiful flower garden.
Although many hearts may ache, they have on the out
side assumed the appearance of happiness, for those you meet
on life's road have their own burdens to carry, then don't
load them down with your own. Meet them with a smile
of encouragement, your own burdens will be lightened before
you scarcely realize it.
Stop and look about you, then you will soon see thou

then yours will diminish. In years past when I thought I
was having unnecessary burdens to carry, but what I now
know were only lessons in life's book of experience, my
mother would always quote this saying, "When great trials
come, it's never so bad, my child, but what it could be
worse," and I find it always true, then bear your trials as
they come to you the best you can, ask for strength it will
be yours, for they are your problems to solve, your barriers
to burn away, meet them on the path couragiously.
Be brave and love and live on with a determination to
surmount every doubt and fear. You are then burning the
barriers. Be loyal to yourself then, you soon will conquer
self and conditions.
The night shades will gradually be drawn upward and
the sunlight of a greater awakening will be yours. Divine
guidance will be your star of hope.
"Only that day dawns, to which we are awake." —
Thoreau.
The path to realization is a long one. But when the
storms of life are under control the night shades are forever
lifted. You see the vision clear, and all nature speaks to you.
Through the song of the birds, the voice of the wind, the
roar of the ocean, the grass in the fields, the lowing of dis
tant herds, the language of the flowers, are all speaking for
you see clearly and know, for you hear the voice of God in
realism. It makes one feel with Moore's lines 'After the
Storm.'
"How calm—how beautiful comes on the stilly hour.
When storms have gone. When warring winds have died
away and clouds, beneath the dancing ray, melt off and
leave the land and sea. Sleeping in bright tranquility."

CHAPTER VIII
CHARACTER BUILDING
"A wise man builds for the future. A foolish man for
the day."
We find as we make a thorough survey and analysis of
character building that the old aphorism ("as a man think-
eth in his heart so is he") not only embraces the personal
being, but reaches out and embraces the complete compre
hensive scope of every circumstance of his life, for in a com
plete analysis, his character and circumstances are literally
the arithmatical problem of the summing up of his thoughts.
The failure to survey or take an inventory of these very
problems or thoughts has caused many a man to fail because
he found, when too late, he was not a real man with strength
of purpose and firm resolve back of him before he under
took to be a Banker, a Lawyer or Politician. Character was
not the predominating factor in his life.
You must be superior to your position, you must be a
man, behind your transactions, be they material or of a
spiritual nature —it is all the same, if you are not larger
than what you undertake the world will look with scorn
upon your pretension.
Charles Hannel in the Master Key, tells us, "We must
'be' before we can 'do,' and we can 'do' only to the extent
which we 'are' and what we 'are' depends upon what we
'think,'—for we cannot express powers which we do not
possess."
No matter how much money you may have, money does
not always talk; when it does it too often talks in the wrong
direction, and reaps a whirlwind.
Math. 1:19-21. Lay not up for yourselves, treasures
upon earth, where moths and rust consume and where thieves
break through and steal: For where thy treasure is there will
thy heart be also.
"Land and Gold have no place in your spiritual growth."
If I were allowed to choose, I would rather have a noble,

upright character than be a millionaire, if the million robbed
my Soul and shut out God's sunlight.
"Character is the only thing that goes on with you when
through with the earth-existence. This alone you take to
the shores of the Infinite Sea."
God does not care if you are a peasant or millionaire,
your character is all that counts in the sight of the creator
of all good. He is no respector of persons, he draws no line,
no distinction.
As near as possible you must try to be master of every
condition in life, be it great or small. Your thoughts are
your weapon, for good or to destroy, or betray, it is your
armour to stay the onward march of enemies, your thoughts
build you Heavenly Mansions or Hovels, or they are tools
that fashion beauty, ugliness or Divine perfection.
"It is all in your own hands —courage is your weapon.
If it stays with you, the race can be won, the goal will not
be denied you, when discouraged and your troubles seem
without remedy, turn often to God's omnipresent strength
for comfort through every trial of life. This thought should
enable you to press onward on the path, patiently and
gently, for his love allows you to be tried, that life's les
sons may prepare you for blessings yet to come."
"You are expressing through your physical body daily,
that all life and action, come through character building. It
determines the quality and quantity of your life's success or
failure."
Your character is capable of weaving for you beautiful
surroundings, desirable companions, a beautiful countenance,
a perfect body. It determines through your thought force
how perfect you mold your present life.
In creating new conditions in your body and mind you
must first learn the process of transforming your Soul; in
this the thought polisher must be kept constantly busy; in
this you will find, "Old things will pass away, all things be
come new."
By a transformation of your thoughts you build not only
character, but a future Haven, not made by hands.
What a wonderful transformation and realization this
all can be accomplished by the renewing of your mind. I

When in Romans 12-2, He said, "Be Ye therefore trans

A simple remedy, one if followed, will bring you into
the full realization that all old conditions, thoughts and
environments will pass away, and all things become new.
By this transformation, you become transfigured into the
image of Divine perfection.
You will feel you are surrounded and pervaded by the
love and protecting presence of the Christ consciousness.

nipotent and omnipresent is always near. In this conscious
realization you can draw upon the inexhaustable source of
supply for your needs of life. Get upon this path of light
and draw from the reservoir of thought, it will build you a
noble character of refinement, wisdom and power.
Life is a real picture show, we are the actors, throwing
upon the screen the things we are daily creating. Are these
creations what they should be? Are we willing and ready
for the screen Test that the world may see? Can we bear
the critics' searching scrutiny? We are pretty sure to know
if we are satisfied or willing this should be done.
Turn your searchlight within. "You are to be your own
Judge. God within will make no mistake, when your final
judgment day comes."
Character building is a slow and wonderful process. One
earth-life is all too short a space of time to round out and
perfect it. Age old Philosophers will tell you this; you
should ask yourselves daily, "What do I think of Myself?"
You are a perfect picture of yourselves within. You are
a walking, living, moving picture in your every mannerism.
As you impress yourself, you will find you are daily im
pressing others.
"The sensitive plate registers every flaw. You are in this
earth-life real creators, daily acting before the camera, creat
ing daily character —for the future. Then it is very neces
sary for you to be creators of Truth."
Keep thy Soul close to God. This is the recipe I give
you! You are a part of God, but you let the battery run
low for lack of recharging, then the physical body becomes
more or less depleted, the mental powers then begin to run

lose sight of entirely and that is the Spiritual body.
"Be your character what it will, it will be known and
nobody will take it upon your own word. Never imagine
that anything you can say yourself will varnish your de
fects or add luster to your perfections, but on the contrary
it may, and nine times out of ten will make the former
more glaring and the latter obscure. If you are silent upon
your self, neither envy, indignation nor ridicule will ob

but if you publish your own panegyric upon any occasion
or in any shape whatsoever and however artfully dressed or
disguised, they will all conspire against you and you will
be disappointed." —Chesterfield.
Did it ever occur to you that "Every walk in life is
noble, if you are striving the best you can with the material,

"It is an evidence, of greatness of Soul, when one is en

Because one's manner is not polished, as a gentleman who
graces the platform, who is Master of Arts, or a College
Professor, is not inferior, only in the eyes of those who have
not the Christ consciousness developed. One may be rough
and seemingly course in exterior, but hive a strong, healthy
energized mind in life's battle can march ahead of the throng,
being able to overthrow thousands of those who are as the
polished butterflies of drawing rooms and of fashion's select
circles. These are diamonds in the rough, but within they
are of the choicest metal, with the kindest, loving soul hid
beneath that rough exterior.
When one is well on the path of light, one is able to de

but yourself. The development of the power of thought is
leading you on the path of Evolution.
One can renew their ideals daily by patient perserverance,
when they realize they are not leading them upon the right
path, the high road of Truth. Turn around and start again
and again. It is never too late to rectify mistakes. Have
High aspirations, for what one consciously aspires to be
come they are in a measure that already. In changing the
thoughts to high ideals, they are beginning to realize their
own greatness.
When one awakens to the consciousness that they wish
to change their character, the majority think they must pray
to their God to make the radical change at once, while others
perceive they must gradually and painstakingly mold their
character by the process of righteous living.
Life is much like every other occupation that is learned
—an art—and it all depends upon how much you put into
it, how beautiful and useful it becomes. No Art was ever
learned well in a day, a month or a year. It is a process of
gradual understanding of every technical point gradually
coming into the knowledge and full growth of that which
one constantly studys.
New principles must be learned and molded into the life,
as you discard the old beliefs, ideas and customs you have
out grown. The new growth necessarily must follow. For
comparison, take a fruit tree, we know the roots are silently
working out of sight below the ground. As these are culti
vated, gather and send upward, strength, even out to the
minutist end of the branches we find this creates new growth
which in turn creates strength that makes and produces the
fruit upon the tree. If old dead branches appear, they are
pruned away giving room for new growth. But we alone
do our own pruning. In order to grow we must obtain that
which is necessary for growth.
For no one can do your growing or transforming for you,
you, as an individual, must prepare your own soil, do your
own individual growing to the degree; you accept this new
method indicating in a large measure your capacity for en

CHARACTER BUILDING 65
"All else is gone from those great eyes, the Soul has fled
When faith is lost, when honor dies, the man is dead." —
Ichabod Crane.
To accomplish the great things of life, one must have
Faith in the thing they undertake. Know you have faith
and courage undaunted, looking forward to the goal. The
building of a strong, powerful character, one great problem
that must be solved is "Self Mastery," on this great path.
It is imperative that you get well on the path of Self Mas
tery, before you can master conditions that are surrounding
you, you are then better able to control your own Destiny.
See to it that Divine love is interwoven throughout all
you undertake to do, materially as well as spiritually, for
as you walk hand in hand with it, you will be lead through
the roughest places in comparative Safety. It must direct
every difficulty, solve every problem, be interwoven in every
act, thought and deed. Only when you lay everything on
the alter of Love and Faith, are you entirely safe from the
breakers that roll high to engulf you, for life's greatest
storms are calmed by it.
Only when you can anchor your ship of life to this Di
vine power, trusting it implicity, to govern all your affairs,
are you master of your fate, the captain of your Soul. —
Without it you are as a ship floating out upon life's great
ocean without a rudder.
Many think deeds they done years ago should even up
their account now. If this be true, when checking up on
their account at the final, will find disappointment, for very
little will be showing to their credit.
The main thing to boil down and sum up is this: Will
we have anything worth while checked up on our account?
We will not have unless we begin soon to register deeds
of service, for those less fortunate than ourself, this will be
character building that will take one through all the way.
"It is folly to say I will not try again and again, when
once you have failed. Failure should spur you onward to
greater action, have courage, try again, for it is the stepping
stone that molds great character.

CHAPTER IX
THE KEY TO SUCCESS
ETERNAL VIGILANCE IS THE PRICE OF SUCCESS
To be a success, it means work, lots of it, much self sac
rificing, saving, using mind, force and power, that denotes
much energy.
All this combined, comparatively signifies doing some
thing worth while; if you have tried with the utmost en
deavor, 'that is far more than many others have done.' Bet
ter experiment though you fail, time and again, than not
to have made an effort.
Hidden from the world outside is the best part of you.
No one, not even your closest companion, knows all that is
stored there, of hidden energy, of desire, anticipation, ambi
tions. All you have hoped and longed to be, and can be,
when the hidden fires that smolder within, are fanned into
flame, by your will force, or power of mind, to try at any
cost, to win or with the encouragement of a kind friend, or
some one else still nearer, to urge you onward to the goal
that is waiting before all who are willing to try in the race
for success and fortune.
On the road to success, you must not lose sight of the
great principle, the mediator, for within you is the mech
anism, the Divine urge, your hope and help, your greatest
boon companion, in all your efforts, if you invite its co
operation; that is the God within, ever waiting to be rec
ognized.
A great aid to a successful goal is good habits, this is a
very important factor in an individuals life, for life is one
great habit. It is easy to form habits, and easy to immitate
another's habits, in words and mannerisms, but "get the
habit of work." One finds punctuality is one of the greatest
aids towards a successful goal.

age, if he forgoes all habits of dissipation and idleness, keep
ing upon the upward road that always leads to SUCCESS.
Fully make up your mind what you want to do, then
do it. Stick-to-itiveness is the key to SUCCESS. Then you
will be self-qualified, and can say I have done my best.
Many would make God their business agent, dealing out
certificates as a passports on the road to SUCCESS, for sal
vation, and everything else known to man, not fully . realiz
ing that the material experiences and work is the greatest
salvation of man.
This is a new world to which all are moving, new
thoughts must take the place of the old, progression in every
line of endeavor is swinging into its place, the old thoughts
are discarded for new and progressive ideas fill the mentality.
The progressive people are not inferior by any means, be
cause their thoughts have given them a new version of a
God of love, instead of the old revengeful God of War and
an eye for an eye, etc.
As one unfolds in the I am or God consciousness, under
standing they are three in one. Soul, Spirit and Mind, they
begin to see their own perfection, realizing their own great
power to attract all things pertaining to a successful life to
themselves.
In this realization, they can radiate good to all the world,
attracting SUCCESS, goodness and power to themselves, in
like measure they give forth to the world.
SUCCESS is not always easy. If it were, every man
would have it. Centering the mind upon work, then doing
it, is not easy, although it teaches the will to concentrate
on a definite purpose.
Many think opportunity should hunt them, this is fail
ure, the attitude of "go get it" if you hope to find SUC
CESS, this will never be found in a drawing room or bil
liard hall, keep watch for something better than your pres
ent position, realizing your will power must be your think
ing capacity to forge ahead to greater achievement.

on, taking things as they come, each day the same, no
thought of tomorrow, while these are loitering you have

THE KEY TO SUCCESS 69
SUCCESS and failure is the difference between using your
will power where the other permits it to lie idle. If more
men were intent upon making themselves masters of their
work than in getting the most they can in the way of wages
and giving the least they can in the way of labor and de
votion there would be a greater addition to the ranks of
those workers who are both successful and happy. Do not
look through a telescope to what lies in the far distance,
do what lies closets at hand. You will more quickly come
to that which you covet afar off.
One pauses, wondering how are we going to succeed?
Not by sitting down and folding the hands can one hope
to accomplish SUCCESS. Work for the big things, for high
and noble attainment. Begin today.
Emerson says:
"For never will come back the hour,
Of splendor in the grass
Of Glory in the Flower."
If this be true, the one great opportunity may be lost if
you hesitate or falter. Persistence and stick-to-itiveness will
surely win you reward. The old maxim, "If you don't
first succeed, try, try again." By your courageous efforts,
you find victory.
When meeting with SUCCESS, one turns their back on
the disappointments and discouragements, turning about face,
with renewed courage and efforts in other channels, finding
other opportunities, waiting to be taken up, it is probable
you will succeed again in another endeavor for one begins
to have more confidence in themselves. These are usually
the ones who SUCCEED.
A great step on the ladder that leads to SUCCESS is a
firm determination to SUCCEED. Another is the posses
sion of moral and physical courage that will enable one to
mount the ladder rung by rung, until the top most one is
reached. You look back upon the path to find that your
reward was earned through hard earned effort.
There is no excuse today for the ignorant man. For the
man who can use his eyes and remain ignorant, no matter
what his condition may be, remains ignorant by choice, not
by necessity. No man need leave his work in order to gain
an education, he can educate himself while he works, many
a man has done this.

70 ON THE PATH
Many of the wealthiest and most progressive men of
today have turned their working life into a continuous
school, receiving widening knowledge with steadily increas
ing efficiency in various trades and occupations.
Each man must determine for himself how large or how
small a man he will be, and how important he will make
himself to his employer, or his vocation.
"Hope need never be dead, refuse to admit failure, great
thinkers can accomplish much."
Many a one have been down to the depths, but have
through striving hard finally triumphed, coming to the top
victorious. Edison says: "Genius is ten per cent inspira
tion and ninety per cent perspiration."
Many times it takes bitter self-denial and suffering to en
able one to get ahead. Keep the mind open for greater
learning, try to be interested in your surroundings, "In
the thing that you are doing."
Never imagine you can reach SUCCESS by leaving one
position and start to look for a better one. You will never
reach achievement by leaving your work. Develop your
mind as you work, you will see a change take place within
you, then you will be ready for something greater when it
presents itself.
If you are in the tread-mill of mental habit get out of it
as quickly as possible for there is no progress there.
If a man takes up a line of business, it is very essential
he understands its technical methods and all practical details
to make a thorough SUCCESS.
It is the man who carefully goes step by step, permitting
his mind to broaden into channels of usefullness as he works,
he then becomes progressively efficient to grapple with dif
ficult situations.
"Perseverance and concentrated effort is one of the sur
est, safest and shortest routes to reach the mile post marked,
'This is the road that leads to SUCCESS.'
"
Even a small SUCCESS helps to boost upward the man
who takes a job seriously, conscientiously and discharges his
duty, is sure to be a winner. He knows virtue and abil
ity will be recognized, he is usually the man who is willing
to fight his battles alone, admits his mistakes, seeks no
evasion nor makes false excuses.

THE KEY TO SUCCESS 71
"A man working only for self, gets neither rest for him
self, here or reward for his work in after life."
Permit us to speak of spiritual SUCCESS, for with it is
found the law of Divine supply. When the spiritual law of
progress is taken into consideration, when familiar with its
Divine workings, will realize the magnetic currents attracts
the supply through Divine mind co-operating.
You mount the ladder of progress rung by rung, from
earth upward from sphere to sphere. The human race in
variably must climb on evolution's step ladder. At the
very base is the proper place to begin to learn the truth of
all things, people, etc., for the lessons at the bottom are as
conformable to Divine or human laws, therefore as neces
sary, as the ones at the utmost heights, in fact more so.
You are in the procession, push forward though the bal
ance of Humanity loiter. It is your duty to get as far as
you can in the climbing process, then you may be enabled
to assist others in their less developed state, to find the open
door of knowledge.
It is waiting the acceptance of who-so-ever will. The
only way to keep from going backward is to keep going
forward, this is the great evolutionary problem solved, ON
WARD AND UPWARD.
By permitting the spiritual man to lead the material, the
open door to Divine supply will be invitingly opened.
Each individual is writing his own biography in the
book of life. Is your record one of misgivings, or is it
spiced with optimism? Do you understand the real inner
workings of your life? This life that so many seem unable
to control and the only thing you really possess? You
should be taught the laws of life that you may control and
govern your own destiny.
Be free to choose your own possessions and your final
abode; by cultivation of your mind and thought power,
you reach the pinnacle of SUCCESS, both materially and
spiritually.
Science tells us that no vibration ever ceases, but the in
fluence goes on forever. By attractive vibratory powers,
you can improve your conditions, bringing to you SUC

sciously or unconsciously. It will always be found that
men attribute their SUCCESS to external causes rather than
give any cosmic force or law credit. But when they learn
the law governing SUCCESS, they find a shorter route to
their goal.
Learn the law of visualization, the process of imaging
through concentration, bringing the thing you desire into
manifestation, for one can be what they will to be.
By the process and right manipulation of the law,
through the will and by proper thinking, "when one is
willing to think," one then requires the knowledge of be
coming his own Divine thinker, controlling his own
thoughts, becoming master of conditions. These are the
ones who have the key to SUCCESS.
In the great battle of life, one finds it is through scien
tific thinking and education of the mind forces that count
for many of the great victorious achievements, and of the
rapid progress; this is applied psychology.
These great classified achievements are becoming more
noticeable. All advanced thinkers will verify this statement,
that is, the general public is beginning at last to use their
own brain to think for themselves.
This stride in evolutions train is driving old superstitions
and ignorance from the minds of those who too long have
listened to others dictations, whims and ideas.
Today, larger ideas are forming in the minds of man,
because they are learning to think scientifically.
They are learning to know every passing hour brings
special opportunity and privileges. Make life a glad activ
ity, do the things that presents itself now, then one will be
capable of mastering greater things. There will be greater
opportunities ahead of you to master and learn.
An old philosopher on giving good advice to his son,
said, "We cannot all be cap'uns and gin'ruls, my son."
Providence has so fixed it that somebody must lead and
somebody must follow. "The hill-top looks good to us,
but we're closer to the thunder up there, and if we cannot
stand steady on our feet, it's mighty apt to shake us down."
This is good logic. For you have found, as one climbs the
upward pathway, those who have, through undeveloped
will power, and lack of concentrated effort failed, because
their foundation was not layed properly.

THE KEY TO SUCCESS 73
A verse in a little poem by Kaufman says:
Come prove our viewpoint isn't true;
Results are all that we will count,
If you can climb, begin and mount,
Present your case—we're the Jury,
But all of us are from Missouri.
Its results only that count on the progressive ladder.
Cause and effect is interwoven in the law of SUCCESS. Ia
our desire for betterment, we reach out for the cause,
which means the storehouse of supply.
It is found through the psychology of SUCCESS, that
all must have their rough and rugged places to surmount
on the path of the souls evolution, no one escapes, other
wise one would not appreciate the bright and sunny nooks
when they come to them.
Know that riches in dollars and cents can never be equiv
alent to the riches of God's great love that carrys you on
throughout Eternity.
Love, Law, God and Energy is the cause, man the effect.
Therefore, man cannot entirely get away from this cause,
for it is the principle of life. Your desire for better things
helps you to reach out for the cause, that means the allness
of God, the Fatherhood of God, the storehouse of supply,
it is for all.
One should strive to make life more complete, too many
only half live. Without usefulness —pleasure without duties
—these are incomplete and not satisfying elements of living.
Emerson says: "If we will take the good we find, asking
no questions, we shall have heaping measures, everything
good is on the highway."
We value things too lightly if they come too cheaply, so
what we work hardest for, we usually appreciate most.
As the poet truely says: The only wealth a man enjoys
for long, without remorse, is that which he himself has
earned, which cost him time and force.

CHAPTER X
THE ART OF TRUE HAPPINESS
"LIFE WITHOUT OPTIMISM IS A LIFE
WITHOUT FAITH"
Today is the time to be happy, tomorrow may never
come. Then today should be the big day, the happiest day,
and will be if all will strive to live up to the highest and
best within them.
One should not permit the sun to go down without
something done worthwhile.
On awakening in the morning, project your thoughts
toward the great invisable power in prayer—"Today, God
help me to do my portion of good for someone, to give
assistance where needed; just so, God, I can feel today is
not entirely wasted, and a soul is made happier for my hav
ing lived."
I have found it never failed when the night closed upon
me, and I took an inventory of the day I could say—
"Thank you, Father, for this day, I am happy for having
been of some service to humanity." This brings the great
est happiness.
The majority are either living in the past or in the future.
In so doing they lose sight of the most important time of
all, the Happiness that might be derived from today.
If today is lived well, the yesterdays may be forgotten,
and tomorrow will be well taken care of.
Many miss the road that leads to happiness in their vain
searching for that something they can never hope to possess.
If you are efficient in making the most of the conditions
that surround you, there is no doubt of finding your por
tion of true happiness.
We understand the search for Happiness to be that some
thing seemingly beyond the reach of all, yet one must stop
right at their own doorstep to find, this is not searching

for the impossible. Look for it and see how soon you will
discover it.
Get what happiness you can from what you have. Have
you not something to be happy for? Oh, yes, of course
you have! But there is a limited few that make the most
of what they possess. In their anxiety to increase their
pleasures they fail to extract all the joy from their present
environment.
One should educate themselves to prevent unpleasant
things and emotions from gaining access to the mind for
the consciousness is forever picking up, as the radio, when
not in perfect tune, catching undesirable vibrations.
One must cultivate a strong will. Mental culture teaches
mind must be the master physician.
Many people in their effort to be happy, or find en
joyment, lose it by the arduous work they make in "dis
covering" it.
I have a relative who says it is impossible to be still.
When I tell her to stop and let go of the high tension and
quiet her nerves, she says, "I could nojt, I would die." She
is gradually killing herself in a vain pursuit, searching for
something to make her happy, at the same time crushing
out the life and substance that creates happiness.
Samuel Johnson says, "The fountain of contentment
must spring up in the mind, and he who has so little knowl
edge of human nature, as to seek happiness by changing
anything, but his own disposition, will waste his life in his
own fruitless efforts."
There are numerous ones who are self-centered. Afraid
to attempt new experiences or to penetrate new fields for
better, happier conditions. Their capacity becomes limited
or dwarfed. When it comes to looking for the realization
of life, or the key that will unlock to them higher ideals
of potential power; the path that is the means to content
ment or happiness, they baracade themselves by their 'lim
ited consciousness, and unwillingness to try. True happiness,
like all other higher attributes, must come from within.
Then one should be Happy when they find this new art

of life. For Happiness is found through work. Idleness
means a hollowed existence. Activity means success. In
success, is found Happiness. In Happiness love is found.
In God we find Faith, hope and love. In all again Happi
ness is found, then help others in bringing happiness to
their tired eyes and smiles to their sad lips.
This is no new discovery. If we make those near us
more comfortable, more contented; if we daily minister to
their Happiness, or to those away from us, we will be
happy ourselves.
Give to all those near you love and respect, for Happi
ness must begin in the home.
Forget the sorrow and the painful things that are past
and gone. No necessity to live them over again and again,
renewing and keeping fresh in the mind old bygone trials
that do not make you happy, but keeps you miserable,
drawing a sad vibration about you of gloom and depres
sion. "Forget it." As the old saying goes, "Get thee be
hind me Satan." For the present is the only thing that
one really has. Get all the sweetness from it by industrious
squeezing. You will then find that happiness is really
contagious.
There should be no other place quite like the interest
and love that intermingles in and around the inner sanc
tuary of the home, yet many leave it to try and find Happi
ness, traveling to foreign lands in search of it, then they
return, saying, with these lines:
I went in search of happiness
I sought her high and low.
O'er seas and plains, I traveled far;
I searched where crowded cities are,
Where tropic breezes blow,
Then deeming Heaven pittiless,
I journeyed home once more,
I looked on fortune with distrust
Thought Happiness, a shrew unjust
And found her footprints in the dust,
There all about the door.
—ANON.
Through experience all will find that is the way to Hap
piness. It is not to be found in things. There is no excuse

for one saying, "I am not Happy now, but sometime I
shall be. After I become independent with plenty of money
or when I get into a modern home or after 'I get my home
paid for. When I have a bank account to draw from for
my daily needs, or the children are grown up and through
college, at which time I shall be able to take a trip abroad."
You will never find it in things. If we do not get any
Happiness for ourselves just now right in our present cir
cumstances we shall never possess the thing the whole world
is striving to attain.
You have now found Happiness comes from the state
of mind. Shakespeare wrote many wonderful things and
one is, "All things are ready, if our minds be so." Stu
dents of constructive psychology understand this. For con
structive thinking is the key to Happiness.
Sometime you thought yourself abused or imposed dread
fully upon, you were the victim of ingratitude, you were
misunderstood. Unkindness was offered you.
Now let us see about it, the vibrations are changed, you
are living in the same house, nothing is altered except your
mind, you feel first-rate, you think, Oh, never mind. It
isn't worth while to bother. I shall not permit anything
to get the mastery of me. Then you become Happy again.
Matters have not materially changed, but your mind has
been undergoing a variation of changes, you have had a
mental house-cleaning and what a blessing. Haven't we all
found this entirely true many times?
Tho' the way may dreary be;
^
Dark with many a sorrow,
Clouds will not forever stay,
The sun will shine tomorrow.
Remember the sun always shines, but we do not con
stantly have the sunshine. If we did we would not always
appreciate it. There is intervals of storms and sunshine in
every life; valued lessons are gained in this manner.
Some people seem to find pleasure in sighing over the
non-possession of what is deemed unattainable, something
beyond the reach. But why not be Happy in our own pos
sessions. If we do, we will soon have more cause for Hap
piness.

78 ON THE PATH
"Meanwhile opinion gilds, with varying rays.
These painted clouds that beautify our days;
Each want of Happiness by hope supplied,
And each vacuity of sense, by pride.
Hope builds as fast as knowledge can destroy,
In folly's cup, still laughs the bubble, Joy,
One pleasure past, another still we gain,
And not a vanity is given in vain."
—POPE.
From close observation one finds their happiest moments
were when they forgot self, doing for others. In making
them comfortable and Happy. They realized the exalted
feeling of real Happiness themselves.
At all ages of life, on the path, and all people of every
race and creed, are seeking Happiness and contentment. No
difference how laborious one's work may be, or what they
do, they are to a great degree searching for one of the
greatest things in the world, HAPPINESS. Trying to get
enough material gathered about them that in their later
days they may sit down and enjoy peace of mind and be
Happy. But it is forever a struggle, looking ahead for that
something they have not as yet obtained and never will
get from without, it must come first from within.
Consciously or unconsciously, our greatest endeavor has
been to find it wherever it is. One will find happiness per
haps in various things. The thing you find Happiness in
may not satisfy others at all. There are those who seem to
find Happiness for a time in a new frock, or another in
sacrificing some pleasure to make another Happy or by a
priceless gift, something you treasured highly. Many in the
churches think it a sin to be real Happy, in something per
taining to pleasures outside of the church. I have had
them say to me: But do you think God would want us
to enjoy these pleasures? Why not? God permits you to
get all the enjoyment out of this life possible, as long as it
is good, wholesome pleasure, and when it is not at the ex
pense of another's happiness.
Through the long period of searching and working to
find Happiness many become impatient, but there must
be a planting of the seed before the fruitage time.

THE ART OF TRUE HAPPINESS 79
In whatever your mind leads toward, be it a poet, an
artist, a sculptor, or any line of endeavor, you are sacrific
ing to gain your goal in the line of art that appeals to you,
when you succeed, it makes you happy.
"Some are finding Happiness, then permitting it to slip
from their grasp. Perhaps they were not willing to share
a portion of their Joy with another. For selfishness can
not find and hold Happiness."
A selfish person is usually miserable. They have few
friends or associates, no one solicites the friendships of sel
fish souls.
You must know people and understand them thoroughly
to love them.
An unselfish person carries with them a vibration of at
traction, a selfish person repells.
To be in tune with your environment is to have trusted .
friends and associates. This adds to your Happiness. Though
you will find your greatest source of supply in your own
mental attitude toward things about you, that speaks hap
piness or unhappiness to your innerself.
Show the world the generous side of your nature by
giving of your abundant store of magnetic personality that
is yours when you have erudited the law of giving.
When you find peace within you have a greater amount
of magnetism, found through the law of attraction toward
others, then you find HAPPINESS.
It matters not where you may go, never look for flaws,
but rather try to see within each soul a possible good.
A busy mind makes a contented heart. They have not
time to think of the might have beens. When busy climb
ing the mountain we rise above the dark over-hanging
clouds that were over-head, coming into the sunshine we
look beneath us and see the clouds golden, for the upper
side is always bright. Just as we climb, we rise mentally,
reaching an exalted station where we emerge on the bright
side.
Keep making others HAPPY. You will find it con
tagious.
As the light of the rising sun dissolves the heavy atmos
phere, so will your smiles and Joyousness dispurse the dark
ness and gloom.

80 ON THE PATH
Do you know sorrow and despair comes to make us fit
for Heaven? For if it never came we would not know
what HAPPINESS was, therefore, the Joy would be lost.
Start the morning with kindness as your purpose and
hope in your heart. If the day is dark and gloomy, you
can brighten it with a song or a hearty laugh. If it is a
bright day you can add to its beauty.
"Look not upon the yesterdays that hold your sorrows.
"If there isn't any star within your sky,
Pretend it's there!
Why, a make-believe one, swinging white and high.
Is just as fair!
If you put it where you'll see it every night,
Just where the sky's particularly Bright,
Your star is sure to guide your steps Aright.
If there isn't any sunshine in your Day,
Why, put some in!
If you've never tried to make your sun that way.
Oh, do begin!
This sunshine-making's hard, but you won't mind.
Keep on, and when it's done, you're apt to find
The home-made brand's the very nicest kind!
—Mary Carolyn Davies.
Give kind words and a handclasp that means a warmth
of friendliness in its grasp. If you meet an enemy, breath
a prayer, for peace, as you pass them by, and forgive and
forget. Know that the sun shines on forever, for those who
can easily forgive.
Be always alert for new ways to grow. For HAPPI
NESS consists in growing great in consciousness.
Then your soul knows the true art of giving and receiv
ing. Never shut true affection out; too many try to steel
themselves against any emotion, when if they would let
their love nature respond to the ever increasing demand of
the Human family —for love and sympathy —their HAP
PINESS would increase tenfold.
If you are HAPPY, help someone else to find it too,
for every bend on the mountain side, there lies the road
leading to HAPPINESS.

THE ART OF TRUE HAPPINESS 81
Emerson says: "Most of the shadows of this life are
caused by standing in our own sunshine."
"Count your blessings. Then your troubles will seem
to dwindle into nothing."
For this world is viewed through many eyes, many see
it evil; more see it good. Some think it a wise old world,
while others see no world at all, but their view and man
ner is possessing all wisdom. In their egotism, they forfeit
their real JOY and HAPPINESS, these souls are undevel
oped spiritually, and need to be awakened to see that they
are on the path with every other individual.
"I will sing with the Spirit and I will sing with un
derstanding."
The rain and sunshine visit every heart. Fortune and
fame brings luxuries, but many times causes HAPPINESS
to FLEE.
Losing sight of the glorious sunsets, the sweet music
poured from the golden throated birds of the forest and
the beautiful wild flowers blooming in the glens, for one
never heard a bird sing without feeling the bird was happy,
or you never heard a boy whistle but you sensed the feel
ing they were HAPPY.
HAPPINESS is not a luxury. It is for all who are will
ing to abide by its rules, for it is very necessary in one's
daily life.
It can come as quickly to an inn-keeper as to a king in
his palace, for it is an authentic fact that HAPPINESS
comes from within, for one must depend entirely upon
their own resources for their pleasures in life.
"HAPPINESS is something Gold cannot buy." It is
then in reach of all. If one is healthy, they can be really
HAPPY. Without health all the wealth in the world could
not make you HAPPY. Work for health, it is secured by
a clean mind and pure heart. With the bloom of health
upon the cheeks and God within the heart, there is mirth
and JOY bubbling out in pure, wholesome laughter and
merriment. A home will be a paradise with souls like
these to live beside. HAPPINESS can be cultivated in spite
of deprivations. Optimism is the road leading to this path
way. It will increase the power to see good in everything
and everyone, and make the best of everything that con
fronts you on the path.

82 ON THE PATH
One with a spontaneous smile, we have reason to know,
is a welcome and valued guest most anywhere. For a
HAPPY disposition is something to be envied, it is too
scarce an article to be brushed aside carelessly.
A contented mind
Is HAPPINESS defined;
Then bar the door,
Throw away the key.
That naught but JOY
Can come to Thee.
Cultivate the constructive attitude. You will then get a
good measurement anyway, but the real test of JOY is in
the giving.
The choicest blessings are those which no external cir
cumstances can deprive us. The real lasting pleasures come
from within.
If ever you find yourself feeling pompous in the knowl
edge of your diminutive world, it is time to stop and take
into consideration who and what you really are.
Your greatest JOY should be in giving to those less for
tunate, but you say I have worked arduous and long to ob
tain my present position, what should I give to another?
Be grateful for your fortunate place you have reached on
the path, realize the power working back of all you un
dertake, never feel secure in what you already possess, you
have eternity ahead of you. Thrust aside the boulders of
doubts, worries and fears for your neighbors —this leads to
HAPPINESS.
"Possessions is not HAPPINESS, but loving and caring
much for humanity, one finds the portal to HAPPINESS.
Beyond all skill and all that it achieves,
Beyond the charm which radiant beauty gives,
Beyond the work that every master leaves,
Beyond the life of every one who lives,
The spirit must continue to progress,
Or vain is every dream of HAPPINESS.
—Guest.

PINESS and contentment, unlock the door, enter into the

and fret and flurry. Then hang at the door of your heart
a sign that says, "Come in," to pleasure, to peace and

CHAPTER XI
THE ART OF SMILING
A spontaneous smile is one of the greatest assets toward
personal charm one could possess. Question yourself, "Do
I smile often enough?" Begin today. You will prove
through experiment that to smile more frequently will
make not only yourself happy, it will also make you popu
lar. A smiling personality is always sought out from
among the throngs, at home or abroad, the smiling face will
always be a welcomed visitor. It usually brings success
and invaribly brings sweet peace of mind and soul, filling
your life with greater cheerfulness.
The vibrations you thus fill with helpfulness also for
those you come into contact with in your daily life. Some
may think they can invent a reason for worry. Can you
find anything good that worry ever has or ever will create?
Then smile, and the world will smile with you.
Many people worry over things that happened years
ago, and bring them to their minds as vividly as if they
had recently transpired. "Let us forget it," stop crossing
old bridges ancj worn-out hobbies, and to the utmost, en
deavor to live the best you can today, and smile.
Begin to do some constructive thinking by remembering
the wonderful things that have come into your life; of the
things you hope to do for yourself and for others. No need
of regret for past failures.
Whittier says, "Forget it. Look not back upon the yes
terday that hold your failures, nor on the tomorrow that
hold your Joys, but today let us live."
This is constructive thinking. This helps the smiles to
come and stay. If you have spilled the cream, at least let
the cat come and lap it up. It is a true saying, "It's a poor
wind that blows no one good."
Many people love those best with the largest bank roll,
with pomp and worldly fame, but give me the one with
the loving smile of courage and good fellowship that share

our Joys, that stand by in sorrow, and when the rainy or
sunny days come, we found them just the same. These we
love, if they never had a dollar, this is a priceless friend,
their value is greater than gold or precious gems. They
cannot be measured by money value. Their smile of un
spoken courage is a silent blessing at any hearthstone.
Sow the seeds of cheerfulness and love around you. A
rich harvest will be your returns, with no thistles in your
pathway to mar the bliss that comes through the sunshine
and radiation of your ready smile, that is like the rainbow
after a heavy shower, it brightens and illuminates the heart;
then look for the silver lining behind every cloud, you will
be sure to discover it just as you bring the smiling face to
the mirror, you will always get a smile in return, or like
the sunflower in its golden glow, its face drawn toward the
light of the sun; so we are drawn toward that we most
desire and in the finish the final reward, according to the
race we have run.
"The pleasures that lasts longest are the ones we give
away, for there is nothing worth while which we can keep
to ourself. The love we receive is the reflection of the love
we give again.
The sweetest memory is perfected when we see the re
sults of our sharing influence.
"Keep smiling then the troubles and cares like the airy
bubbles will soon fade away."
"Moral blindness shuts out the inner light whereby the
beauty of the world comes."
Be content with the pleasures that are at your feet, in
stead of reaching outward in the vain effort for that which
still lies beyond thy reach, less you lose the pleasure at
hand in the vain effort to grasp that which lies beyond.
The old familiar and time-worn adage, "A bird in the
hand is worth two in the bush," is very true. Enjoy the
pleasures that are already yours and be thankful for these
blessings, although they be small ones. As others come, or
the ones formally visualized at a distance appear, the pleas
ure will be intensified, as the waves are touched that bring
from the great universal, all things great and small, for
greater good and development along the path, all must
travel in life's evolutionary plan.

CHAPTER XII
WILL
A powerful WILL means a strong determination to con
quer, then on a turn of the path, your victory.
One has often heard the psychology student say, "We
WILL, because we WILL."
One finds through serious thought that SATAN is the
rebellious WILL of those who have never learned Self-
mastery.
When WILL is defined it is the faculty of the mind by
which one chooses and determines or commands Divine de
termination. Choice desire, Decree, and many other defini
tions. This is sufficient to show that the WILL must be
cultivated. There must be a strong determined WILL de
veloped to resist the opposing powers of thought, both from
your own consciousness and from the thoughts of others
reaching you.
The WILL is the very depth and essence of personality.
It marks and individualizes man.
The one with the strongest WILL is pointed out as hav
ing a marked individuality.
Individuality is not what we see, only through actions,
for it is the image and likeness of God. On the other hand,
when one studies personality, it is found to be more of the
likeness of the earthly father and mother, the outer appear
ance resembling the material man.
INTUITION
It is through INTUITION and feeling you find a true
guide to character reading. You get the impression it is
registered upon the mind, or the WILL determines that you
know them. When this INTUITION is thoroughly de
veloped, you find who rings true and who does not. You

reason out things through the developed will. The WILL
POWER is reasoning power.
We travel in thought through space where-so-ever we
WILL. Our WILL is the propeller if our WILL stops, our
propeller is dead, or inactive. Our capacity to think deter
mines how and where we go in a moment's time. We pro
ject ourselves outward.
Our thoughts carry us to foreign lands, ejecting ourselves
into India or Japan. Building homes and temples with our
minds, through verification it has been found INTUITION
so developed, when in the sacred silent moments can see
and hear and enjoy these flights, for we will call them,
soul travels out into space, our astral body is capable of
projection out to a great distance and to possess the power
of occupying two places at the same time.
A great many travel out in their sleep in this manner,
visiting numerous places of interest and on awakening, re
member, bringing back in the subconscious with them the
scenes and places visited. In this state they have been seen
and recognized by others as they travel, perhaps, to a sick
friend or loved one in the quiet of the night. Thoughts
are things and are known to take form. These thought
forms are not a myth, but a reality.
How can man save himself from the assaults of the pow
erful and persistent adversary? He can be conquered by the
masterful force of power and will from within.
Evil conduct is the result of evil thought, as taught, all
Human activity is the result of thought. What is called
evil, originated in the mind of man. It has no existence
in the mind of God. Before the readjustment of the outer
man his thought activities must be readjusted. The indi
vidual is not evil, but it is the thoughts back of the indi
vidual must be dealt with directly. There are mental hab
its and physical habits, mental habit is infinitely more im
portant, for it is the mind that controlls both physical and
mental.
It is very important to exercise the WILL, to form good
habits. Though work need not be made of it, physically,
materially, morally, spiritually.

CHAPTER XIII
THE ASCENSION TO THE PATH OF LIGHT
On analyzing the history of human existence, one should
not lose sight of logical reasoning and inductional process
all the way through. This is only right, for the Bible tells
us to prove all things, then hold fast to that which is good,
for it is said where there is no vision the people perish.
If one has the ability to grasp a great stupendous truth,
like that which has been proven through scientific investi
gation given to the world today, yet so few are able to
comprehend the truth that there are no miracles, for all is
the working out of Divine Law. Then through cause and
effect, one reaps what they sow.
It is quite necessary that students of science and phil
osophy should demonstrate and teach the truth, as they re
ceive enlightenment and knowledge of the laws of life, to the
world of earnest seekers who are searching for greater light
on the path.
Those who have for ages past groped in darkness of dis
belief and superstition are now in a greater degree prepared
to receive through the enlightening agencies the truth of
the continuity of life.
The world is fast awakening from its Rip Van Winkle
period. Daily inquiries are coming from those who are con
scientiously and earnestly seeking knowledge that show pro
gressive minds are constantly and actively engaged in the pur
suit of enlightenment, thinking perhaps after all they were
put here for some great purpose. This purpose to discover
all they can about themselves, taking initiatory steps toward
spiritual perfection and also of where they came from;
a greater problem for them to solve is, why are they here?
If we do not know why we are here, and do not know
where we are going, it is certainly time to discover some
thing about our destiny, for wide-awake people today are
questioning.
Then they, too, wonder if they shall go to a tangible
place upon leaving this mortal existence? Then if they do,

what kind of a place will they find? Will it correspond
in likeness to their earthly habitation? Shall it be a place
shrouded in mystery? Will they have a harp immediately
placed in their hands and be expected to play and sing
psalms all through eternity?
•It is quite likely, a few at least, would drive the ma
jority of the Saints out of paradise. They prefering to take
up their abode in Hades rather than to listen to the in
harmonious notes for long if they corresponded with the
talents some of them possessed while upon the earth plane.
We find many, although living in a busy world who
are, in all sincerity, asking just such questions as these.
Those of today have the advantage of preceding genera
tions. They had no idea of what we would call the mod
ern Heaven. They had the old Heaven and Hell idea and
the eleventh hour attonement instructions.
"One would be a coward to wait until the eleventh hour
of life, then ask to be forgiven for all the wrong and un
thinkable things they have committed, then expect to en
ter into paradise and find the promised land. What of the
conscience, or the still small voice within? Stop, is this
justice? To those whose whole life has been given to service
in the master's vineyard, while another has done nothing
but lived for selfish pleasures only, then expect at the last
minute to slip by, as a small boy slipping under the circus
tent.
There are plenty of avenues open through which correct
and convincing information can be gleaned. If one's mind is
analytically inclined, they can receive for themselves through
study, or through teachers of light, who are keyed to higher
rates of vibration, with the great universal minds and
thought forces, to assist in the search to know more of the
great purpose and cosmic force.
Those gone before are ready to swing wide the door be
tween mortal and immortal spheres beckoning to all to take
the key and unlock the door of superstition and prejudice
ideas and drink at the delightful fountain of light and new
understanding.
If one will, in all sincerity and supplication, solicit this
valued assistance, the information will readily and gladly be
imparted to the inquiring minds.

THE ASCENSION TO THE PATH OF LIGHT 9 1
Endeavor to test and prove the truth of immortality, as
many scientists, inventors, great men of letters have, such as
Professor James of Harvard, Professor Hyslop, Sir William
Crooks, Sir Oliver Lodge, Sir Arthur Connon Doyle, Mar
coni and scores of others. They proved the truth through
strictest tests and scientific investigation that immortality is
a fact through communication of souls from the unseen
spheres of life. This is a great stride in the Soul's evolution.
It will be well worth your while to try it out, for one
can never conscientiously say a thing is not true until it is
proven otherwise.
When one makes the test themselves they are sure then
to place full confidence in the discovery, the test will pay
splendid dividends in spiritual reality.
This life is SWEET, though it has its BITTER trials,
when one meditates upon the giving up of all that life
holds dear, to go out into the mysterious somewhere, grop
ing in the darkness of uncertainty knowing not and fearing
what the abode of their spirit and of the other life will be.
Read and study, search through the book shelves of
libraries for the truths of Divine sceinces, or learn the truths
from those awakened in Soul consciousness, from those who
are so finely keyed and attuned they are permitted to tune
in on the Radio activity of sensitive forces, from the land
of Souls, to voice the Divine Message of immortality to
those upon the earth sphere.
Seek those who have heard the call of the voices of the
so-called dead, of friends and loved ones coming back across
the great Divide, with the message that they still live and
love nd have their associations, likes and dislikes, longings
and natural tendencies.
Their thought power and perception is keener to dis
cern things as they go onward on the path toward greater
achievements and greater progression, they are stilly desirous
of assisting those left for a season behind for the mentality
and character go on. It is all they take into what the un
enlightened, think, is such a dreaded and mysterious condi
tion or place of existence.
"ACCUMULATION OF RUBBISH" of the earth must
be left behind.

92 ON THE PATH
The gross accumulations of earth are as nothing when
the final move comes. There is no need of a drayman or
caravan to carry across accumulated possessions.
That there will be many who will not be able to even
find their Soul will be true, it will be so swiveled and
dwarfed through unpreparedness and of the accumulation
process of making the almighty dollar, when they hope
to enter the Spheres of the Heavenly Kingdom, will not find
even a hovel for themselves, they will be so clothed in
sack-cloth and ashes of past accumulation of rubbish.
There is no necessity of this when one discovers the per
ceptibility of the truth; of life's great problems that death
is life, and life is eternal. Oh, but you say this all sounds
so complicated and mysterious, hard to find Heaven or
place. Does it seem difficult to locate this Heaven within?
Go into the silence of your room, still the physical and
mental, then look within, for all there is, one will find
stored away there.
A simple but true statement on the path of progression
and one the close observer will find, as they travel forth
on their observation train, is the discovery that all the way
to Heaven is Heaven. When one follows closely the path
of the searchlight, this leads to Divine truths, which are
indestructible, for that pathway will be strewn with happy
surprises and peaceful nooks where you can rest the weary
soul from the tumult of the world's rebuffs and sorrows.
Always keep in view the basic principles, which should be
thoroughly understood, for the foundation of truth should
be cemented in the mind. This is very essential before one
can build the super-structure of power that is to endure
throughout eternity.
There are sufficient guide posts to direct one, although
when ones own intuitive powers are developed they are
their own High Priest. The path is one of Joy when the
rough places are smoothed, although the path of the soul's
evolution is not paved with gold. For there are manifold
bypaths paved with counterfeit tempting to the uninitiated
on the path where on investigation may merely be strewn
with thorns and thistles of unhappiness and discouragement.
But when a student gets into the thorny bypaths of life
they know they are having their Gethsemanes and the crown
of thorns no one can lift but themselves.

THE ASCENSION TO THE PATH OF LIGHT 93
If one is not willing to sacrifice the pleasures to go forth
in the Master's steps, to help Jew or Gentile, friend or foe
on the path, they are not conscientiously ready to take upon
their shoulders the Master's burdens.
Spiritual achievement and success comes through sacri
fices and service. If one can voluntarily do this they are
on the path that leads to the mountain of spiritual attain
ment.
Do not attempt to climb too quickly to the summit of
Divine wisdom. Experience teaches all the way to Heaven
is Heaven. It may appear to be a long distance off; those
who are analytically studious to Divine Law will discover
it very near.
Watch and pray that thy feet may be planted upon the
solid rock at the feet of the Master. Be diligent, be delib
erate, familiarizing yourself with the basic principles of
natural law; this is the infallible guide that leads to the
Heaven within.
There may appear to be numerous short cuts to reach
all knowledge on the path. Do not be tempted by these.
The safeguard warrants only the course that takes eternal
progress to reach the path to all wisdom, for the safeguard
is the slow advancement that signifies lasting growth.
Valued fruits of the spirit are discovered and an exulta
tion and satisfaction is felt as one discovers more luxuriant
fruits of the spirit, as higher one journeys toward the sum
mit of realization.
Have no fear of being contaminated by the contact of
other vibrations, conditions and things, annoy or distress
exactly to the extent one permits. Jesus drew no line, no
distinction. He was our greatest beloved teacher and healzr
of the ages. A perfect pattern He left for all to follow in
his steps. He waits with his great strength and peace, com
fort and wisdom upon us, for we feel his indwelling and
inspired spirit, serge within us when we are in at-one-ment
with his power. If in the footsteps of this great mystic,
one will turn when they feel tempted and their own re
sources fail them, becoming discouraged with the struggle
of life, never will you wander far from the rose strewn
path of light. You are gaining ground, as you ascend from
the foothills to the higher mountain peaks in knowledge of
cosmic life.

Remember Jesus drew no party, no sect, creed or color
line. No one has the power to be a true disciple of light
except they who follow in His steps. They will discover
then the way of the cross will be illuminated with Divine
light.
One gains valued knowledge through all these different
avenues and experiences they meet on this path. Wisdom
draws nearer, fear and superstition fall away and a pure
garment of white and purity will be earned by deeds of
loving service toward God's children, who are our BROTH
ERS and SISTERS. If all could realize this stupendous
fact it would go a great way toward a world Brother
hood and one big family. There are many obstacles toward
this end, yes, but the greatest and most formal barrier is
religious antagonism. This is gradually becoming less as.
the mind of man broadens into channels of clearer vision
and understanding of that greater love that the loving
Christ demonstrated toward all humanity.
Our thoughts are the rudder that steers our life boat.
They will either take one into calm, peaceful waters, or
out into depths of a stormy sea, up unto the heights of
the mountain tops, or down into the mire and slush of
earthly conditions. They may lead you into the fields of
briers and thistles of inharmony and discontent. Think big
thoughts, get into the full current of enthusiasm that the
mental powers will keep active for greater good. One's,
capacity is limitless. Keep the thoughts upon the high road,
where smoothness, calmness and joy are always your guests.
Napoleon said, "I have only one counsel for you, be master."
The most illuminating light that ever shed its silvery rays,
upon the human heart is the light of understanding that
comes to the person who has banished hatred, strife, envy,
fear and selfishness. This light shines forth from the face,
chimes forth in silvery echoes from the voice and sows the
golden seed of loving kindness to every passer by. This
leads to mastery.
Wonderful changes are rapidly taking place of the old,
the curtain that divides the socalled dead from the living is
gradually dissolving. The material world and the world of
Spirit are gradually blending into each other.
The teachers of science are springing up everywhere. Stu
dents are preparing themselves for this new Era. They are

waiting in breathless expectancy for a brighter, better way,
still of receiving the truth, regarding their inner life and
•definition of God and his Laws.
Too long the truth has been suppressed. Other forms
and creeds have crowded it out, as the world advances now,
in this new age, no longer will the thinkers stand by and
permit the MAN MADE religions to hold them. They are
seeking, searching, demanding the dawn of a new day. That
day must bring about the practice of "Love You One An
other." This was his command, and when it is faithfully
practiced the establishment of the religion that he taught
nearly 2000 years ago will be revived. This is the new
dispensation, go ye forth in the vineyard with clean hands
and pure hearts and establish this great but simple truth
among God's children.
Permit this truth to echo through the corridors of this
new dispensation. Then know if you have done a wrong
to some one, ask not God to forgive you, seek out first the
•one you have harmed, ask their pardon, then thy own soul
will find the forgiveness.
There in the secret place of the most high where all the
higher attributes are knocking for admittance, Health, Hap
piness and Wealth are all locked within. Take the Golden
Key, unlock the door and walk in God's great corridor of
love, peace and plenty.

CHAPTER XIV
DEFINITION OF GOD
"HE WHO SERVES MAN BEST, SERVES GOD BEST"
When one is in union with God, God is in union with
them. With this comes a clearer conception of all things.
The TRUTH becomes gradually apparent for one becomes
consciously aware of their true Christ-hood within.
To come into union with God, one has authoritive com
mand of the Divine essence of God, for they are one and
a part of it.
In committing some crime or misdemeanor, it is said,
one has lost sight of God. They have lost sight of God,
but God has never lost sight of them, for the spark of the
Divine Father is smoldering within them, waiting for rec
ognition.
Whether they are in the darkest dungeon or in deepest
dispare, whether they are high or low, when this spark is
fanned into its God-hood, they are again in union and per
ceive their oneness with God.
When one is in union with God, they need no interme
diate, nor perceptor, for they become their own High
Priest or Priestess. They come into their own heritage
through the Divine Union with the Father. Where there is
no fear of sin, poverty, sickness nor death, for God is the
greatest physician, the great positive mind that encompasses
the Universe.
For a short period, study nature. Nature is rhythmetical,
is always in time and tune, ever the same, never hurried,
because she cannot afford to, although many times when
nature needs relief, catostrophes and seeming calamities,
take place, it will be found nature is only being relieved
through these incidents. If it were not so, still greater
catastrophes would occur. It does its work perfectly, nature
makes no mistakes.
Can the human race say as much? No, but the race
should strive toward this perfection to get in tune with this

universal reality. Thomas Paine says In Age of Reason,
"The word of God is the creation we behold, and it is in
this word which no human invention can counterfeit or
alter, that God speaketh universally to Man."
Follow nature, go straight ahead, seeking the path of
light. There are many by-paths but stick to your purpose,
do not be lead here and there by every wind that blows.
Paul said, "Prove all things, hold fast to that which is
good." Then in Romans 12:2, again said, "Be ye there
fore transformed by the RENEWING of your mind." This
is regeneration out of the darkness into the light of clear
vision and broader perception.
One can see and hear God or nature speak as they look
about them, beholding in its beauty as one reaches forth
the hand to touch a beautiful flower, hearing God in the
sweet notes of a song bird, seeing him in the green foliage
or the golden beams or sunshine, the rippling, babbling
brook, the great ocean, the majestic mountains, the flower
covered valleys. Why try to search out a God of person
ality, when one may discover him within all things.
God cannot be bound in a personality, for God is too
universal to be limited. Stop searching and know God is
and you apart. For God is absolute cosmic consciousness,
there is no separation.
Jesus said, "I and my Father are one."
I pray the consciousness of the people will awaken soon
to this glorious reality. Then the realization will come
rushing in upon one, that God is infinite, unlimited, omni
scient, omnipotent, omnipresent. Thank this Infinite Father
of love for this knowledge and Divine wisdom." That no
longer does one need fear a wrathful or revengeful God of
Judgment.
For this judgment seat of God is found within THE
SOUL of man. This discovery has been long in reaching
the human race and of the minds and hearts of the people
for many yet still cling to the old anthropomorphic God,
sitting upon a throne to judge or condemn.
1st John 4:12-13. No man hath beheld God at any
time; if we love one another, God abideth in us, and his
LOVE is perfected in us. Hereby we know that WE abide
in HIM and HE in US, because he hath given US of his
SPIRIT.

98 ON THE PATH
The race concept in general is forever criticising God's
glorious work of nature, but one must confess that nature
is exhibiting knowledge in her work. Science today is teach
ing there is vast treasures stored in the universe. We little
dream how gradually one is discovering more and more this
stupendous truth.
Great thinkers, scientists and inventors are almost daily
making these vast discoveries. This is what we call evolu
tion, for now we discover the world is gradually evolving
out from the old concept of past ages to this new age con
ception.
As the world advances, our ideas must advance also to do
this, we must keep abreast with the times, this makes one
no less a christian, for the God of our forefathers is our
God of love still, but today one merely sees God with a
clearer vision. "For as once we saw HIM through a glass
darkly, we now see him face to face."
How is one to make the presence of God known? It is
to enter into the secret place of the most high. The inner
most depths of the soul invisible. In this manner one may
practice the presence of God, knowing they are never alone,
when lonely, keep saying, "I am not alone, for the Father
is always with me." This will fill your hearts with a
deeper, purer love and trust in God's eternal presence.
Love is Unity. This is one of the greatest laws of our
vast universe, with God ever on the throne, love is there.
In the book, "Teachings of the Masters of the Far East,"
the question is asked, what is God? The very power to ask
the question, what is God? The power to realize God is
God. It brings our mind in immediate contact with God.
Free from any mental conception it gives us the quickest
realization of God that we can have. I am birthless, death
less, changeless, indestructible Spirit, untouched by any
seeming manifestation or condition forever, whole, perfect
and free."
Then one discovers God is spirit. Infinite mind, the
eminent force and intelligence, everywhere manifested ia
nature. God is the highest expression of all things.
Then Andrew Jackson Davis says, "God lives in the
Soul of every animated thing and in the proportion as his
life. Essence is eminent therein, so is that living object a
receptacle of God's truth. An exponent of his goodness.

a prophet of his love and an expounder of his inspiration,
"Where God is, there is Illumination."
When wearied Souls who are acutely alive to impres
sions from external objects find frequently earth's grievious
trials press unyieldingly upon them or pleasures that satisfy
for the time only the senses pulling upon the sensitive soul
so grieviously, perceiving no balm therein, if they will then
turn the thoughts inward there they will discover the con
solation and peace as the sweet spiritual balm of Gilead from
the outward storms and stress of life in God's loving refuge.
The key to God's great treasure house, one has in their
own possession, to unlock the door and invite God to en
ter in to ever remain and become their co-partner and clos
est companion to partake of all his possessions. To be all
in all with Him, then through all He will manifest his
cosmic life, in at-one-ment, with the creative force of con-
scious life which is unending.
God has long been called by various names, when in
petition or prayer. (Which draws one nearer the throne of
his love.) We have said God the Father, Great Spirit, God
almighty, creator and so on throughout generations past and
present, all according to their concept, however one calls.
He is Universal, impersonal and perfect in nature, all su

in Divine Wisdom God is the creator.

God's Divine wisdom one recognizes his nearness as he blos
soms forth in beauty and sweetness within each Soul.
Not until then will one be sure to perpetual growth, free
from the biting frosts of winters of bitterness —we all desire
the sweet breezes, perfumed from nature's flowers about us,
then the smile which speaks through nature God will be
upon the face of all who follow the compass leading all
who will to come and find the truth of God that, "All are
but parts of one stupendous whole, whose body, nature is,
and God the soul."—Pope.
This is not sacrilegious but Divine truth, the fact is too
long the orthodox world has built a wall around themselves
and see nothing on the other side of it or rather refuse to
go beyond it, where they can discover still greater and more
beautiful and convincing light.
The indwelling God will be the truest guide. It is our
privilege in this new and progressive age to be free to do
our own thinking, but all must know all things through
Divine Law, come and go in God's own good time. As
the Sun has its own time to come up and go down, the
silvery moon, then to rise, the myriads of stars to twinkle
in the sky, so the seasons come and go, seeding time then
the golden harvest.
To progress with the fast growing truths, one must be
strong in mind and character, keeping well poised as one
progresses in truth, never imagine it takes too long, for time
is Eternity.
In studying the great old masters' philosophy, one dis
covers it has lived on throughout generations and centuries.
But today, we discover many of the thoughts of yesterday
may be discarded; they served their apprenticeship, their
day and place. In this new aquarian age, to our vision and
senses, comes more and greater advanced and enlighted
truths supplanting the old.
Gradually one lays aside the old garment of doubt and
superstition and man made creeds, putting on the new ad
vanced garment of modern ideas of this new era, yet ever
keeping in sight our God which we discover is a more
loving and forgiving Father than the old perception of Him
that was taught a generation ago.

unable to alter them through their former traditional super

All along through the past ages is found progress, pro

new growth in time and in season in like manner or degree
one gradually adopts a new and more progressive cloak
that is necessary for every philanthropic Soul of the new age.
On discovering new and more progressive ideas with
fuller realization, they wonder why they did not always
see from this mountain top, but one must realize they could
not, for the simplest reason they had not climbed far
enough up the path of knowledge to see. They were not
strong enough in consciousness nor had they prepared them
selves, therefore they would have stumbled before reach
ing the greater path of light. Later they may be stronger
and more able to tackle the next peak a little higher up,
seeing beyond with still clearer vision, where broader and
more advanced ideas will be stamped indelably upon the
consciousness.
On and on one must climb this progressive mountain it
will be a joy to travel it, when one realizes this labor is

it is progression that leads to light and wisdom, like unto

upon the past pages of their life for a time and try to dis
cover, if they can, whether they have turned to good ac

If it falls to one's lot to lead, to be captain of the march,
do it cheerfully. If it is to follow, they should be con

Tennyson tells us in these beautiful lines:
Speak to Him, Thou for he hears.

"THE DAWN OF A NEW DAY IS HERE."
The world as never before needs the love of Human

Life is one eternal progression. As one gives of their

Love is a magic word. It heals the broken heart and calms

Love is the master key that opens the door that binds all

The Poet said:

No one should grieve over things that are but seeming loses

But I hear some say, "I work hard for all I get." That
may be true, but the very air you breath is Gods. There is
a law all must work for blessings. If you aid a chick from
its shell, you cripple it in an effort to free God's law of mak
ing it strong. Through its own battle it fights for freedom.
The same with the Human family, every one appreciates
the blessings they work hardest for and usually know better
how to hold possession of them.
The wealth of nature is given to man. How can man
be so blind, in his little dwarfed conceit, he closes up the
avenue whence God's great blessings flow.
Science tells us, the earth is so vast there is enough on it
and in it to furnish one with problems to study and solve
for ages.
Too often man in their narrow gauge vision, through
ignorance, are blind and in their conceit, think they know
about all there is to be known, but through the study of
natural laws one can climb to supernatural heights of God's
great truths. The open book of nature is worthy of inves
tigation and He has invitingly opened it up for your inspec
tion and acceptance, for one need not go far to see God's
unsurpaSsing beauty everywhere.
I must give to you in part, "God's measure" by our
own. —Ella Wheeler Wilcox. For they fit in so beautifully
with my own definition of God. He who sits and looks
out on the pulsating world, and feels his heart swell in him
large enough to hold all men within it He is near his great

creators standard, though he dwells outside the pale of
churches and knows not a feast day from a fast day, or a
line of scripture even. What God wants of us is that out-
reaching bigness that ignores all littleness of aims, or loves,
or creeds and clasps all earth and Heaven in its embrace.
As one gets into the finer vibrations, their mind becomes
attuned to, and catches the whisperings of love wafted over
the sensitive wires to the Soul. They note the song of the
birds, or the roar of the sea, for all seem to have the voice
of sweetest music.
One becomes alive to all nature, for it speaks to the Soul
of God and Love. In natures beauty one can see a living
reality of God's great and wonderful plan. Our earth is
only one of the innumerable worlds in space. If one will
ponder they would become appalled at the magnitude of
nature in its wonderful progress of evolution.
Life is a clock work, ticking time each minute, each hour
and day brings a fuller realization that the hands go around,
counting our days fewer on earth to dwell. How many are
building for the future? For the next real birth? Is the
clock of time ticking off usefullness, that means progres
sion and a higher realization of life for you?
In service for humanity one finds real solace and food
for the Soul. Follow the golden rule, through it is dis
covered Soul building. This brings one into a higher rate
of vibration, becoming a real builder, each brick shining
with a golden luster as it fits itself into place.
Making earth life worth-while for having lived upon it,
eternity will not seem too long, for it will be like a Joyous
new song when laboring for love of humanity. The God
we are related to, we know and love, knowing that He is
large enough to embrace all mankind, all nations, everything.
Whether black or white, no color line is drawn. The
only line that must be drawn is that one reaching out and
embracing every living creature. Leave not one on the out
side of brotherly love.
Blessing the unfortunates and rolling up the sleeves of
loving consciousness and reaching down, down to the depths
of sin and woe, helping them until they, too, find the
Kingdom of God within, this is rightousness.
Seek this Kingdom of Heaven, through this path of serv
ice. Do not shirk but work and labor in the vineyard of

voice within, it doth tell Thee of Thy duty to lead all
from doubt, dark superstition and sin. Labor is a blessed
privilege to those who have this Kingdom found, for treas

One's environment changes when the consciousness is re
newed. Attracting those that correspond to the new mode
of thinking.
We have not discarded our Father's God, but progression
has shown him on a higher plane of consciousness, we find
God within the Soul of man.
Those who wish for higher proofs of God must awaken
to a higher unfoldment to bring them into realization where
higher hopes live. Claim this inheritance, it is yours for
the asking, seek this light where you can say, "I know that
my redeemer liveth, for in my flesh I see God."
What of the sweet perfume of the flowers, the orange
blossoms and pure white lillies fair? What colors one rose
red, another white, with all the beautiful colors of rainbow
hue coming forth from the same black earth.
Some poverty stricken Souls findeth God is none of these
beautiful things. Denying there is any such a being in the
universe. One usually finds these Souls are restless and un
happy. Then a Soul who dscovers God in the allness of
all, these find sweetest peace dwelling around about them
and are one with God, seek then to discover God, not in the
darkness that knoweth him not, but by the path illu
minated by a light that proclaims him forever.
Then come and walk in God's great corridors, taking
down from the shelves of the mind God's wisdom, waiting
there for your acceptance, to dissect and analyze. For all
the great fundamental and higher truths are stored there in
the limitless reservoir to be tapped and made use of at your
own will and pleasure.
One can never hope to get all wisdom, for it is an ever
boundless and never ending pathway studded with rich
Jewels, for the mind of man to partake of as he daily
journeys onward in the observation train of truth, gradually
leading one onward and ever nearer the path of the Soul's
evolution.

Those who live in the midst of strife and struggle are
those who live a godless life. They are forever doing their

When one lives in the conscious understanding of God they
know God's way is best, living in the fullness of peace and

When recognizing the fullness of God within, then one

CHAPTER XV
BECOME A MASTER MIND
If the race could fully understand what the mind of Man
is capable of, they would be amazed. Direct the attention
for a moment to the wonderful inventions, all are the result
of the mind of Man and his capacity to think.
Here is the trouble and it is a deplorable one. "They
haven't time to think." Take time, you'll readily find it
conceivable that the Mind of Man is capable of accomplish
ing.
Not only do you conceive the handiwork of Man in all
its wonderful mechanism, but when the application of the
Mind to acquisition of knowledge is developed, will ascer
tain how the Mind is capable of controlling their whole
destiny. It controls the physical body, molding the char
acter and places one in the environment they are in today.
People are often placed in their present conditions of en
vironment by cause, the effect they are now reaping. There
is a cause back of every effect. Many see the effect of their
present condition, produced by a cause set in motion back
many years, perhaps before they were born, into this life's
expression. Did you ever stop to consider the conditions in
which you were brought into life here upon earth. Perhaps
not because wanted, without any preparation by your par
ents, or any thought as to what they hoped you would
become.
This is the cause many times of so much HUMAN DIS
TRESS. I believe in birth control until people learn to
know how to bring about right conditions, to mold the
little buds that come forth into this lifes existence. A Soul
of God-likeness, purity and Greatness, one to help uplift
Humanity when reaching maturity, instead of a hindrance,
not only to its parents, but the thousands it comes in con
tact with.
When real child birth is understood a new race will be
born. A race of intelligence, purity and uprightness. Those

who will be of service and have a love of duty. These
Minds can be developed to be Masters and Teachers of the
race, not conforming to life only to the extent of self grati
fication, but living to help others to live, to see they are
fed, clothed and cared for.
The time is coming, if not in the present generation,
that shall see this Father-hood of God and Brother-hood of
Man here upon earth, which will signify, "We are our
brother's keeper."
Oh, ye teachers, and Souls of Truth, impart the knowl
edge that the Mind of Man is the Master. That it is up
to them, not only to bring to themselves through their own
mentality the things necessary for their development, phy
sically, mentally, spiritually and also materially, but to help
all races, even though it be the colored races, this 'Truth'
that their Soul, when developed in 'Christ Consciousness'
is as pure and white as their own.
Again I say, the cause of so much HUMAN DISTRESS
is ignorance of natural laws. Not understanding or know
ing self, for when you do "old things will have passed
away. All things will become new." You will have free
dom co-relating with natural Laws. This implys you are
Master of your Destiny.
The great philosophers perceived this law. Jesus, the
Christ, had a full understanding through his occult teach
ings and adeptship.
He knew Divine Law so well he made no mistake. His
Mind was the Master Teacher and obeyed every principle.
When will the race realize the indispensability of looking
within, to find the gold mine of Truth and Wisdom that
slumbers there instead of traveling the world over to find
that which lies within their own consciousness of Power
and Spirituality.
This Spiritual ore is smoldering and waiting to be
fanned into recognition. Go after it with pick and shovel.
Light the torch of your Mind with God's love. Then
search out the hidden gems of Truth that lie within. It
will be to you your bread of life. The Golden nuggets
from Divine fields are there, rich and pure, with the spir
itual knowledge and wisdom of the ages.

MIND, THE MASTER
(Self analysis)
"All things first have their origin in the mind." Then
when you change a condition you have changed your
thoughts. If you have harmonious conditions, it goes with
out saying, you have harmonious thoughts. Then it is up
to the individual to make or to mar their own life by the
attitude of Mind they live in daily.
Think big thoughts, visualize the things you require for
your good or the good of others. Be sure you make the
picture clear, then hold it with powerful affirmations for its
success, soon you will realize your desire, but you must
learn to go about it in a scientific manner with the love of
justice in your heart.
"Mind is the Master, the body is the servant of the
Mind," says Eleanor Kirk.
When we learn the truth of these statements we realize
we alone are the Master of this physical Temple to its full
est extent.
Then a great load will be lifted from the physical, for
the body will learn to obey the thoughts given it by the
developed mind.
If in a low rate of vibrations you are disturbed in some
mental form or another. If vibrating in a high rate of vibra
tions one is not very apt to absorb or contact disease. You
can demand the body to obey you. "Your thoughts are
the greatest controlling force today, the greatest discovery
of all times," for all things have first originated in the
mind of man.
In this manner, one is drawing to themselves, in corre
sponding degree of vibration environments and conditions
that mold your life.
Loved ones, try to be conscious of the power and force
of your own mind, the God power that is within, that
you may at all times be master of circumstances.
"Keep the watch-tower of the mind on guard that you
do not lower your vibrations, thereby absorbing negative
thoughts of others."
At all times, learn to keep your self positive. If you fail
to do this other forces will be trying to master and tear
down, perhaps what has taken years for you to build up.

DEFINITION OF GOD 110
When you feel these negative thoughts trying to enter
keep repeating, "I am positive and powerful. I am master
of this temple. Nothing can enter or dwell here but good
and pure thoughts. I am master of my own Destiny. I
am a child of God."
When you are thoroughly developed in Christ conscious
ness, you too can also be a Daniel, surrounding yourself
with the same powers and Christly light as Daniel mani
fested in the lions den where nothing can penetrate the aura
and vibrations built around yourself. But daily you must
seek that Kingdom of Heaven, the God within must be ever
on the throne of your consciousness, as a shield in times of
turbulent Seas, then God will cover you as the fishes of
the Seas are covered with the waters.
There seems to be, I am sorry to relate, forces ever try
ing to tear down excellent qualities and good work by
others, many times, through some word carelessly spoken
one makes a mountain of discord out of it, instead of clos
ing it out of the mind, an undeveloped Soul will hold and
nourish the thought until, in time, it undermines beyond
the comprehension of man, something it took months and
years to accomplish.
This may be the work of one jealous, envious Soul,
undeveloped, which produces an ever-ready fire that burns
out more of their brain force causing inharmony in their
Soul tearing down their physical body and disrupting con
ditions in general.
•In this present state the mind is far from being the Mas
ter Physician, letting undeveloped thought-forces enter the
Mind to the extent, many times that causes, unbalancing of
the Mental Forces, where otherwise, if controlled, would
get a stronghold upon the power behind the throne, becom
ing a power for good in the world. "Watch your steps,
that you do not get off the path the Master Trod."
As the stars light up in glory,
In the darkest of the night,
God's truths come to help you,
When you seek and search for light.

SELF ANALYSIS
"Many times the cause of so much Human Distress is
found through neglecting the give and take plan." If you
put nothing in the bank you certainly can take nothing out.
All can be bankers with wealth untold. Not of Material
wealth alone, but preferably of the Spiritual supply which
increases as you give. Practice and observe, giving of your
love and sympathy, that is your real self the God within.
Observe Divine Law is ever co-operating aiding you in
depositing to your savings account the wealth that death
cannot deprive you of "A glorious life eternal."
This is the only Security Bank and worthwhile one, the
stepping stones to Spiritual success, where one can deposit
treasures, "where moth nor rust doth not corrupt, nor
thieves break through and steal." These are the golden
nuggets of power and of peaceful assurance that far out
shine and surpass the gold and silver of earthly treasures.
Never permit an opportunity to do good to pass by un
heeded, then when the account is checked up on reaching
the end of earth's existence, you will have excellent quali
ties, contributing toward your future happiness, on the high
road throughout eternity. "For as you sow, so shall you
also reap." Self analysis will convince you this is true.
If one works diligently and earnestly, they are sending
by the route of LOVING SERVICE material sufficient to
build at least a comfortable dwelling place in the world of
Souls.
"In my Father's house are many mansions." You may
possess the one you will, it all depends on the material you
send forth for its construction.
Permit no earthly enjoyment or wealth to become a detri
ment, that you forfeit the exhilaration that comes with the
Soul's progression on the path, becoming pitiably poor as
to place of habitation on reaching the world of Souls for
this will greet those who neglect their opportunities, those
who step aside from the path of light.

Goodness, generosity and love, shared with others while on
earth. On the other hand, the rich man will stand in aston
ishment, viewing the hovel he has been drawn to as a mag
net, if he has not done HIS DUTY TO GOD AND MAN.
He will discover a poverty stricken SUPPLY SPIRIT
UALLY.
Cast is not known there. It MATTERS not if you are
a King or Queen or President upon earth. In the world of
Spirit it is the reckoning of CHARACTER only.
How many have lost sight of God's opportunity or the
things that would really count in the bank of Eternity.
"While these are reveling in riotous luxury and idleness
the poor and needy are forgotten or brushed aside, they have
no time for CHARITY and good deeds, all too soon these
unenlightened or unawakened Souls may discover their mis
takes with the reversing of conditions facing them as they
enter the Spirit world.
With no bank account in the city of the Angels to draw
upon, they may be glad of the light and strength of their
lowly servant who they may have scorned and thought un
worthy of their notice, except to order about at their bid
ing for their comfort and enjoyment.
The stepping-stones to the Spiritual Mansion is easy to
climb if you get upon the ascending scale. Commence by
doing the things nearest to you to comfort a neighbor in
sorrow or give a helping hand where it is greatly needed.
If you have a kindness shown you pass it on, keep the ave
nues open, or if a burden you can bear, help shoulder it,
then soon you will be astonished at the lightness and feel
ing of peace that comes with this service of love for it is
this manner of service that one finds the stepping-stones to
the Christ.
It is surprising how many things one discovers to do
when the desire is there and the desire will be there when
the Christ consciousness is fully awakened.
Soon one WILL begin to understand and love Human
ity. Then they become builders and will find ALL NA
TURE, opening and unfolding in beauty unsurpassed to
anything they dreamed could be possible to exist; for they
see with new eyes and hear with new ears, therefore dis
covering new found joys of HAPPINESS AND CON
TENTMENT.

"If you RECEIVE you MUST keep the avenue open by
giving. This is nature's law, for it is forever being replen
ished."
"Nature speaks loud its loving expression of God. If
one will look and listen to that SOUNDLESS SOUND,
they will soon hear the music of the spheres for love will
be there and God is ever on the Throne."
Fill the Soul full of love then listen in the silenre for
one will not need to watch nor listen long to hear the voice
of God speak.
Whittier says:
I heard the voice of the silence
Speak with a soundless word,
And from the inward ear alone,
The Spirit voice is heard.
The spoken word seemed written
On air and Sea and Sod,
And the bending walls of sapphire,
Blazed with the thought of God.
"Such peace that denotes harmony and contentment
comes to these big Souls, who are willing to GIVE and
willing to TAKE. They have found the KINGDOM OF
HEAVEN. The glories that are within. These are the
ones who are willing to give their full supply of love and
wisdom to the passer by, be they who they may, they are
willing to share any of their Joy or to help lighten an
other's burden. There are many incomparable Souls who
have grown ripe in this Christ awakened consciousness of
giving.
They remind me forcibly of the poem by Sam Walter
Foss.
It also applies to many dear and intimate acquaintances
and we should be truly grateful to the Author, for giving
this delightful poem to the world.
"THE HOUSE BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD."
There are hermit Souls that live withdrawn.
In the place of their self -content;
There are souls like Stars that dwell apart
In a fellowless firament.

Let me live in the house by the side of the road.
Where the race of men go by—
The men who are good and the men who are bad.
As good and as bad as I—
I would not sit in the scorner's seat,
Or hurl the cynic's ban;
Let me live in a house by the side of the road,

I see from my house by the side of the road.
By the side of the highway of life,
The man who press with the ardor of hope,
The men who are faint with the strife.
But I turn not away, from their smiles nor their tears.
Both parts of an Infinite plan—
Let me live in my house by the side of the road
And be a friend to man.
Each one have their separate place to fill. Each their
duty to perform. Each Soul should solve their own prob
lems if another is permitted to do YOUR problems that
would not be growth. If a teacher in school solved all the
mathematical problems for the scholars where would be
their growth? It is the same with all problems of life.
Experience is growth.
Each can work only according to the material on hand,
remember, there is no easy road to MASTERSHIP.
Yet there are those who idle away their precious hours,
with no thought of developing their talents GOD has be
stowed upon them, if it is only a word dropped in the
cause of truth it never dies. It may be spurned and tramped
upon, it can never be entirely crushed, springing again into

As one gives from the pitcher of love and truth, it is ever
replenished by the Divine Supply for God's bountious store
house of health, success and knowledge is endless. "But one
can only become an open channel to receive by GIVING."
Tap the well-spring, "Ask, you will receive." Again I
say to you, Seek Ye the Kingdom of Heaven, the God
within, then all these things will be constantly increased.
It is in conformability with all Divine or Human laws;
to develop this Christ consciousness within. There will be
NO LIMIT when possessed of this power for one is work
ing in conjunction with the law.
"The cause of so much Human Distress" will be prac

come established in the mind of humanity. When this be
comes established there will be no necessity for Alms-houses
for the needy, for every one will be looked after, clothed
and fed properly as they should be, for there is sufficient
unto every need when one discovers they are rightfully
their brother's keeper.
Through physical and mental trials, it awakens the God
principle within, and when discovered one becomes givers
as the Christ gives.
It is a great pity that wealth so often blinds and sepa
rates the Soul from the very things that count for real
worthwhile things. The Spirit becomes shrouded to a com
parative degree with worldly glitter then consequently not
having sufficient strength and power to express its Spiritual
being.
But there is always that something, hidden within the
Soul, which is not entirely forgotten and dead, for there is
constantly that still, small voice of God—the conscience —
knocking for admittance. Open the door and let him in to
dwell there and be your boon companion.
Many there are who close their eyes and ears to the call.
They may go on unheeding, perhaps until dropping the
physical body before awakening, then the veil will be lifted
and their eyes become opened to what they left, which
were merely "husks," for all was shallowness, in compari

was "the God within."
They become conscious of being face to face with their
REAL SELF, the I AM. They may wish to hide from
Self, but they can never hide from God. Is it too late to
rectify their numerous mistakes they now see stareing them
in the face? On taking an inventory of what they have
taken with them into the other life. Sad it is, for the great
multitude who will discover they have absolutely nothing to
their bank account for life eternal.
Their Soul is poverty stricken, their light is dim and
flickering for it has been sorely neglected from lack of the
oil of Human kindness, thoughtfulness and love for those
less fortunate Souls than themselves, where they could have
done their share toward eliminating Human suffering.
Money does manifold good toward helping a burdened
Soul. Yet so much CAN be done by sympathy and under
standing which comes from the Soul, who is awakened in
Divine consciousness or the Christ principles.
"BANKING YOUR ASSETS"
The Master Teacher Jesus had a bank account greater
than any other, one that was always running over with Di
vine Supply, it could be drawn upon at any time. No one
that ask of the Christ need go away empty-handed.
If one will fill their treasure chest with this "Christ
Principle," then give to all who are seeking to know of the
bread of life. The manna will come from the Heaven
within, for therein lies the inexhaustible supply. As one
draws upon the universal bank they are co-partners with
it,
just so long as they keep their accounts correctly. Others
must not be forgotten, but forget Self. When one can
reach .this height on the path, they will be supplied with
out the asking, they will have conquered the erudition of
the law.
One may be
a
millionaire, but
it
calls for
a
price of name
and fame materially, but
a
poor price indeed, unless one
gives of their supply assisting the poor and needy; that
is
doing real worthwhile things. They will be

character."
"GIVING"
The children of the earth must awaken to their full obli
gations of the giving plan, if they do, they will find it a
joy, when they get into the HABIT, for that is the only
real satisfaction there is that which comes from reciprocation.
Remember the very air one breaths is GIVEN by the
Universal Supply. Then why not keep the avenue open,
as you RECEIVE of the good things of life pass it on.
"This life is made up of obligations one toward the
other. Live and help others to live. The very bells of
Heaven ring in joyous thanksgiving as one makes the inter
change."
One cannot fully realize the magnitude and results of
this giving plan until one reaches the world of Spirit, or
until one becomes really aroused from their inactivity to
their duty of worthwhile living.
Every kind deed, every loving thought, or every time one
is thankful for another's good fortune. All is recorded in
their autobiography album of life, there to be opened at the
stepping out of the Home of clay, to pick up the thread of
life on the path where leaving off here to go still on and
on through aeons of time.
Will our name be written on the autographic pages,
white and fair? It will be, if we keep well the thought in
mind, first and foremost the reciprocation plan of life.
Give, do and live to help others that there may be no
dark blot upon the pages of life's book.
NARROW GAUGE ROAD
Too many are willing to forever live on the narrow-
gauge road, afraid to step out on the broad, high road of
progression. Many afraid of criticism, these are hoarding up
their liabilities. This is all chaff and by a breath of wind
is swept away. Many are foolish enough to hoard up, for
those who are to come after to step in their shoes when
they step out; this causes idleness and decay. Work is the
savior of man-kind.

118 ON THE PATH
The great King Tut' of centuries past, when his tomb
was opened, there was found his mummyfied body, with
the treasures buried around him, the same as placed there
thousands of years ago. But only the good that was within
his Soul, his character, was the degree he had to carry with
him, for his passport to the land of Souls may have been
very small, the Kings of the old days were for the most
part cruel and wicked.
God has called us stewards, therefore has chosen us as
precious vessels to carry the message of truth it is while
carrying the Divine message to others that we ourselves can
be filled.
It is hard for a dwarfed Soul to smile or speak even
kindly to others, they are not happy and do not care to see
any one else so.
One can read in their faces disapproval of all things Joy
ous. Any Psychologist or Character Analysist will readily
tell you this is true, their Soul is unawakened in Christ
consciousness.
There is volumes in a kindly word or smile that comes
from the heart. It cannot be measured in dollars and cents,
one who is a comforter and gives cheer in any manner will
discover large receipts awaiting them in their home over
there; likewise, will experience a great pleasure and joy
while yet living upon the physical plane.
Smiles help one through many tight places. It disarms
malice and hatred. There are too few smiles and too many
frowns, too much hurry, too little sympathy, too much
fear, too little real courage. All this closes out the real
things that make for the banking account of life eternal.
Live today the very best you can. Tomorrow never comes.
One day well lived is worth many spent in idleness.
Be not a doubting Thomas. Awaken and be resurrected
today. The key is in the lock, open the door of Divine
Supply, for every day is a resurrection day is God's day.
"Seek this day whom Thou will serve." Work and pray.
One will be filled with such power, they can remove moun
tains of doubt and fear from their own mentality also from
the minds of others. This is because one ascends into the
great white way of understanding the intellectual ocean, the
Christ way of Truth.

BECOME A MASTER MIND 119
One becomes a great personal magnet when they become
a highly developed Soul, drawing right conditions, people
and things to themselves. If they should draw what seems
to be undesirable they can still be gaining a lesson thereby,
for it may be, the very thing for their future development.
Then whither you are, or what you are, just know it is the
place for you at that particular time. Placed there by your
own thought power.
If one is desirous of happier and more prosperous sur
roundings, get busy, build, by this SAME thought force,
for one can be what they will to be.
The temple must first be prepared by a thorough house
cleaning. That is, dissolve all negative thoughts, filling the
mind with high ideals.
■If you have a strong desire to accomplish something;
that very desire sets in motion the vibrations that assists it
to come into manifestation through the recognition of this
law. A new civilization is being born, thought is being lib
erated. The world is recognizing natural laws.
Remember, through this law, one finds a give and take
world always. "We get what we give." It is measured on
the scales to an equal balance. Those who think they get
nothing, give nothing.
"The things I hold are the things I loose. The things
I give are the things I hold." —Emerson.
The happiest times of my life were when making others
happy, when giving of my time, my home, laboring in the
effort of giving the very best within me. And afterward
ascertained by experience that I myself was securing the
greatest blessing and also pleasure. A reward, if one wishes
to call it so, of all the others. This is the explanation of
the things I give are the things I hold. And the state
ment of "It is more blessed to give than to receive."
Unselfishness means interest in others. Their advance
ment and their joys. All this is blazing the trail toward the
path of eternal progress. What a consolation on entering
the home of Souls to know one is worthy of the words,
"Well done, Thou good and faithful Servant, enter into
thy reward." Reward of what? Why reward of sacrifice
and service for others, it builds a great picture in the Spirit
world. This is the Golden rule plan that never fails. Take
it, loved ones, walk with
it,

will hear the bells of Heaven ring in Thanksgiving, we
hope for the good Shepard that tendeth his sheep well, for
Christ said, "Feed my sheep."
This is the food; Loyalty, unselfishness, faithfulness in
well doing, untiring in Thy efforts, awakening to the need
of the hour then thy lamp will be trimmed and burning,
ready when the bridegroom calls. "Come up higher." Thy
work is well done and finished, to begin upon the real life
eternal.
Be loyal to the truth one represents, if it is TRUTH, it
is what all need and it matters not how many spurn you,
for when they reject the truth, they are disdainfully reject
ing God.
The boomerang they are hurling at the torch-bearers will
return. Then it is they who will cry out for mercy and
help. The boomerang seeks its own.
From Emerson, I quote again, "For out of the mire and
slooth of things, there is always something sings." There
must be a weeding out time before the real harvest. The
chaff is obliged to be separated from the wheat. Be glean
ers, these are so precious in the sight of God.
Those who are left unnoticed, unappreciated, because of
their unassuming unpretentious, retiring natures, when awak
ened, become pearls of greatest price in their transformed
state, they are illuminating agents on the path of truth.
Be not only a leader, but a follower. Be willing to be
lead to greater heights than the station you now occupy.
Realize the Father and I are one, then you will understand
the transcendental power that is yours for the taking. When
one is no longer inclined to be lead to greater heights, the
growth is checked for they are limiting self.
All need the pruning process frequently, discarding the
old branches of thought that served for the time as stepping
stones, but now taking on a new and more progressive
growth.
For this earth-life is a growing stage from the cradle to
to the stepping out of the present life. Use the five sense
ladder to climb with. Never say, "I do not believe this or
that." For if one does not comprehend a certain truth or
ism, it is preferably to say, I do not understand. For when
pruning away certain conditions, taking a thorough inven
tory of the problems under consideration, one probably will

discover it is the very truth and of greatest value for one's
present growth.
The new aquarian age, now being entered into, is
one of progression and enlightenment. Concentration upon
all great problems should be well considered and weighed.
It is the age requiring powerful thought, for thought force
is the most powerful means of obtaining knowledge. Think
out all problems, sifting out the wheat from the chaff.
Learn to concentrate and visualize, the result is, one be
comes builders, by visualizing gradually but surely, one will
create their ideals. In concentrating one must become so
identified with the object they are thinking upon that they
become conscious of nothing else. In this manner, you are
setting in motion conditions in correspondence with the
thing they are concentrating upon. In this manner of scien
tific thinking, there is nothing to prevent one accomplish
ing their desire.
Chas. Hannel, in Master Key System, part 18, says,
"Thought is the invisible link by which the individual
comes into communication with the Universal, the finite
with the infinite, the seen with the unseen. Thought is the
magic by which the human is transformed into a being who
thinks and knows and feels and acts."
One should be conscious of the power behind the throne,
recognizing their own great worth. One is growing in this
manner and diffusing their light and power, touching other
Souls, strengthening their minds to enlarge upon their re
sources, thus becoming an endless chain.
Selfishness and jealousy are the cause to a great degree of
SO MUCH HUMAN DISTRESS. Empty the pitcher that
it may be refilled with still greater things from the Uni
versal storehouse. One will find good measure to overflow
ing in return for all generosity.
All will be weighed in a balance, no one will be found
wanting in equal portion.
Life is just what we make it by our thoughts, when one
fully becomes conscious of this truth, they will know the
greatest power they possess is the POWER TO THINK;
then if one starts something, they should go through with
it. Eventually they will not only be able to control them
selves, but others will respond to them without any appar
ent effort on their part.

122 ON THE PATH
One should begin TO THINK. The day may not be far
off when they are rushed out of the physical, perhaps with
out any warning and without any idea where they are,
blinded by false teachings of a one Heaven and Hell place.
Know Ye, that one makes their own Heaven or Hell, by
the thoughts they think. This is entirely true. One will go
to just such a Heaven as they have prepared for before leav
ing here, or a Hell by neglecting and leaving undone that
which would have made others better and happier, as well
as themselves.
Ask yourself this question today. Are you prepared to
step out of this house of clay? It may be your time. Do
not think the call will be postponed indefinitely because it
is you. Divine Law, over which we have no control, is no
respector of persons. If all would BEGIN DOING, THINK
ING and LIVING as THOUGH this day were the last, I
assure you, there would be no unkind words spoken, no
one would cheat his brother man, no one would permit the
sun of this last day to go down out of sight until they had
forgiven all wrongs or until the one who had been wronged
would be made right.
If the whole world would believe and trust each other,
believe each Soul pure and good, the prison doors would
swing wide; capital punishment would be abolished; all
would be praising the great Divine plan for teaching them
to put love and TRUST in each other, this illumined light
on the path and the power to understand, that all are parts
of one stupendous universe. All thy brother's keeper. Each
a link in the universal chain. Then THE CAUSE OF SO
MUCH HUMAN DISTRESS would be eliminated forever.
Live the life Jesus of Nazareth taught, for you can preach
the greatest sermon of all others "by living the life." As
exemplified by him who taught us of the inner radiations,
which through the great sunbeams of LOVE go out on the
path to all God's children.
If I take the wings of the morning
And dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea;
Even there shall thy hand lead me.
And thy right hand shall hold me."
—PSALMS.

CHAPTER XVI
"TIME IS JEWELED MOMENTS"
"Precious time is fleeting. Studded with Jewels are the
moments of every passing hour," but few there are who
find them. Though sometime, each jeweled moment must
be accounted for, it is only when one's hours are num
bered do they fully appreciate and pray to be given another
chance to make good the wasted hours for which they now
can give no account.
When one is on the brink of what is termed death,
which is only the beginning of the real life eternal, when
they are well-nigh across the bars are they conscious of or
really appreciate what is to them now, JEWELED mo
ments that seem now to have been wasted opportunities.
When permitted to step back from the brink for another
season, one should no longer permit the stream of life to
rush past them, viewing merely the sands, but count every
ripple and storm on its surface as an experience well learned
and needed on the path of the Soul.
Thus as the sands of time begin to ebb to and fro does
many earnestly think of taking the initiatory step toward
preparation for the journey.
When the bar is finally crossed, the voyage finished, one
finds themselves on the launch that sails on and on through
eternity. It is joy to look back upon earth's experience
when one can view with satisfaction of knowing they left
JEWELS of great price in the many things left behind well
finished and rounded out through loving service in God's
great vineyard.
The breezes that ripple and seem to disturb the waters of
life about you are performed with God's LOVE, even
though it appears that God does not see nor hear, yet does
Divine law weave its web of protecting power over all.
■If one took their own course, endeavoring to govern
their own life entirely, sad would be the plight and few in
this manner could hope to find the finished Kingdom, or
the last voyage accompanied by JOY; accomplished by real

service, for only through service does one discover power
and Soul comfort.
Jesus' life was one long line of service, hence his great
occult power was manifested in healing the sick and com
forting the sorrowing. He never lost sight of the Christ
love, it was a part of his daily life for his greatest com
mandment was, "LjOve ye one another."
Forget self and selfish motives, permit your being to
blend and interblend into other lives about you. Have their
JOY and success enter into your life, becoming interested in
others around you, in this manner only can you be actually
HAPPY. One should not try to live by bread alone, but
by service rendered unto God's children.
One may toil laboriously to earn their living, yet one
need not permit material conditions to obscure their vision
from grand and nobler things, for the Soul possessing power
of an individual can keep them on the path of knowledge
and wisdom where they can intelligently and lovingly give
assistance to others.
"No one need ever be so oppressed by their own burdens,
where they cannot find time to help lighten another's."
If you have never tryed it, it is time to begin now. Yon
will ascertain by experiment yourself, stopping in amaze
ment to discover how HAPPY you have become, "All
through Service."
If truth be known the majority of the earth people are
longing for the dawning of this new day, the time when
strife shall cease and the manifestation of the Christ life
may be felt throughout the world.
Are you prepared? Shall we resolve to begin this new
born life, the process of ushering in this new Kingdom? It
is already upon us, for the new aquarian age is dawning,
thousands of Students of Truth all over the world are fully
conscious of this fact; these are the ones who are prepared
to meet emergencies or trials however great, when that time
comes their feet will be planted upon the solid foundation,
the Truth, that cannot be washed away. It matters not how
tempestuously the storms of doubt and opposition may rage.
They have found the path that the Master so lovingly
blazed the trail 2000 years ago for them, but many have
wandered far from the path, lost in the maze of the world's

the path of gold only that leads often to sin and degrada
tion, they lose sight of the path the Master trod, one that
leads on and upward to the Kingdom of light.
No one possesses power to measure the worth of the
Soul of man, there are so many types. Hidden beneath
rough exteriors and traits that seem to deteriorate character
may be sleeping an illustrious Soul. Be careful of your
critcism of your neighbors and your friends, look for the
■good in others, you will be sure to find it.
"For he that would love life and see good days let him
refrain his tongue from evil and his lips that they speak no
■guile. And let him turn away from evil and do good, let
him seek peace and pursue it."
(WHAT IS THE EQUIVALENT TO
MONEY VALUE?)
Money is very necessary for it brings the things that
mean comfort and luxuries of life, keeping one from the
dreaded debt that come many times to those with moderate
means.
Money cannot liquidate all debts, for many debts are not
incurred by lack of money, although numerous ones ap
parently think their obligation terminates there.
More valuable than gold or silver is the obligation met
largely through personal and loving sacrifice.
Service is power, observation will teach one this is true
when going out of the way to help others their advance
ment on the path is more rapid, gathering a greater collec
tion of spiritual treasures.
Those who are not awakened to the truth that we are
our brother's keeper and since all have a debt they alone
must pay are hording up and accumulating more debts that
sometime must be met either here or hereafter.
One is often tempted to take life easy, just drift along,
not thinking or caring much about the other fellow. Then
what of yourself? If you take nothing out of a vessel you
cannot hope to put anything in, there must be an even ex
change, our obligations must all be met, if we fail in this,
we fail in our Soul's salvation. One finds in the study of
natural law nature is forever producing an even exchange.

Spring, summer, autumn and winter—animation, growth
decline and rest. Rain is given to the earth, then comes
the warm sunshine upon it. Then comes forth grain, fruits
and vegetables. Without these we could not hope to exist.
Then through grateful hearts one should show appreciation
to the giver of all great gifts by reciprocation through de
voted service, that something which is more than equivalent
to the value of money. The Christ devotion and at-one-
ment with the Father through loving and devoted service
rendered to Humanity.
You require no material eyes to see, nor ears to hear,
that which comes through a mind attuned to the Divine
harmonies of the Spheres. The source whence one may

greater awakening of this Divine truth, that death is life
and life is immortal.

CHAPTER XVII
THE TREATISE ON HEALING SELF AND OTHERS
Seventy important questions on healing answered, with
many affirmations of tremendous power, that bring to
the soul Vibrations of Strength and Courage.
What keeps the doctor working overtime?
Ignorance of Divine or natural laws, carelessness, willful
neglect, for everything in the universe is under law. Health
is the result of obedience to law.
Condense in your encyclopedia of knowledge the Divine
law of healing gained, the main points hold their consecu
tively until you absorb in every fibre of your being the
truth you especially need.
(1) How can 1 rhythmically attune the physical and
mental to the harmony of the Universe?
There are five essentials to promote and to keep in tune
with perfect health. They are:
EAT right, BATH right, EXERCISE right, BREATH
right and THINK right. The human body is made up of
single cells and is a chemical composition of the elements. It
is the lack of some one or many of these that cause sick
ness and inharmony.
When EATING, think you are eating to live, not live to
eat, as the majority do. Watch closely your mastication of
food, do not expect your stomach to perform the act your
teeth were given for.
BATH often, keep the thought of purification in your
mind of the outer tabernacle as well as the inner man clean.
Keep the colon clean. Drink quarts of water every day.
EXERCISE right, with proper thought of breathing
deeply to rhythmic counts of 7, carrying some thought you
need most, as "Freedom poise new life," "This is the temple
of God. I am recharged with healing power." Deep
rhythmic BREATHING from the solar plexus should be
come a habit.

128 ON THE PATH
THINK right, is the greatest of all these with proper
thoughts all these things will come to you as freely as you
BREATH to live.
You have observed how at the blacksmith shop the bel
lows are filled with air that fans the fire into brightness
and beauty—likewise if one constantly fills the lungs with
God's purifying, vivifying and refreshing air the mind is
keen and the body will keep fit, you will be in trim to
function on all planes of consciousness.
(2) Is it God's will, all be healthy?
Most assuredly. His will is all be healthy and happy.
The old idea of thinking was that however ill or deformed,
or if one is taken out early from life, it was God's will.
Even yet, when a precious beautiful bud in early life goes
out, many say it is God's way, his will be done.
(All that you inherit from your Heavenly Father is per
fection.)
The awakened soul finds that God does not desire that
any one should suffer, but all should live and express the
God-hood of perfection. Going through this life's expres
sion to gain and to grow through life's experiences. It is
through disobedience of the laws of nature and oftener
through ignorance of the natural laws that illness comes to
the human family.
On observation one finds illness is caused from careless
ness. Colds, fevers, etc., are caused from a lowering of
vibration through over-work, worry and many things too
numerous to mention. When the physical is so depleted,
the vitality at a low ebb, there is less resisting force, then
one is unable to master self, permitting the opening of the
door of the physical to disease. One understanding and
working witht he law know how much they can stand and
usually calls a halt in time, otherwise they, too, must suffer
the consequences.
Through proper directing of thought-forces, with deep
BREATHING, accompanied with powerful thoughts and
affirmations of health, is a great crutch to help one over
the rough places.
Will-power and determination are the implements the
Master has given freely to use for this purpose. He has
shown the way, He demonstrated and expressed the great
power in his daily life, teaching his disciples the law.

THE TREATISE ON HEALING 129
Many may think it too much like work and would
rather have doctors and nurses bills beside the suffering en
tailed. No one gets something for nothing. The law of
compensation works according to absolute Justice.
Those familiar with the Laws of Nature, obeying them
throughout, are constantly in rapport with the law of per
fect health.
(3) What is the result of transgression of the law in
any form?
It is causing the sensitive strings of the body and mind
to become out of tune. Just so sure as the vibrations are
lowered in this manner so sure is the physical impaired.
Discord is disease, "Lack of ease." For perfect harmony
cannot be drawn from inharmonious notes of an instru
ment; therefore to maintain an equilibrium, one should
keep the watchman at the door, KEEPING WELL POISED
WITH CALM DEMEANOR and true harmony, where the
vibrations are free and beautiful, this is HEALTH and
WEALTH.
(4) On close observation, what does one discover?
That there are numerous reasons for sickness. A very
grievous one is inharmonious vibrations in the home sur
roundings which may cause illness in many different forms
also causing unhappiness.
(5) What is the sensitive body compared with?
It is like a harp with a thousand strings constantly be
ing played upon. If the body becomes tense, it closes out
the perfect and free circulation of the blood through the
physical body. Then the instrument is in grievous need of
retuning.
(6) If a patient needs mental quietude, what must be
done?
Instill courage by positive, loving words of faith for
quietude and strength. This closes out their fear and as
sists the patient to gradually rise into the vibrations where
they themselves can become master of their own temple of
God.
Mathew 24:42. For know this, that if the master of
the household had known in what watch the thief was
coming, he would have watched.
Then watch that the vibrations are kept FREE FROM
FEAR, lest the thief steals your good health unawares.

130 ON THE PATH
That which means more than riches when good health is
gone, for disease is a mental factor as well as a physical
factor.
One speaks of nervous exhaustion, low nervous vitality,
physical energy, nervous energy. The body and mind must
be free from fear, for fear burns out vital force and energy
with no strength to resist disease.
All this can be remedied by pure high rate of vibration
which generates an equilibrium of new energy. This energy
seems a mystery because it is unseen. One does not see life,
but life is. And we are apart of this all pervading life.
"God Himself cannot give you that which you are unwill
ing to accept," the Master said to one who needed healing.
"Will Thou be made whole." Then again He said, "Be
hold I stand at the door and knock." Call into expression
this great unseen, hidden force, energy and pour out your
blessing for the good things already yours in that stillness
and sacred silence.
Emerson, the great soul, great because of his developed
power, said, "Power is in silent moments."
Go into this silence, speak to him and he hears, for he is
nearer than hands or feet. Open the door and let God in.
Then you find FREEDOM from fears, for your soul is
vibrating in that glorious reality of the Christ presence.
(7) What is the Meteria Medica world fast discovering?
That the art of the spoken positive word, through sug
gestion, helps to close out fear and does much toward keep
ing up the courage and the will strong in the patient.
(8) What does the weakening of the will do?
When the will becomes weakened by fear, it immediately
lowers to a greater degree still the vibrations of the patient.
In numerous cases it is courage to hold fast, and with
this lackage of will-power it is weakening the vibrations,
then the door is opened that invites more inharmonious
conditions.
(9) What is a good, silent affirmation to help close out
fear and for peace and healing love for a patient to use,
also to strengthen the will?
Have specified times for the silence and concentration.
This is a necessary requisite for bringing healing force and
hidden power into activity. "Every atom of my being is
filled with love and peace. I have no fear. Just now, I am

radiant with the newness of life. All the cells in my body
are free and I rejoice in freedom and boundless peace. I
am revitalized and rechemicalized by the knowledge of my
oneness with God's healing, purifying love. 1 am bathed
in this healing force, knowing every day is God's day filled
with his goodness. I am a part of this allness. I am now
radiating this all powerful force of healing love balm out to
the world."
Concentrate on this thought, "I AM FREE. I believe
and know I am now abiding in the heart of the Spiritual
universe, with HARMONY, POISE, POWER, SERVICE,
WISDOM, SPIRITUAL SUNSHINE, LIGHT, HEALTH
all surrounds me. I now am in loving service of giving and
receiving."
1 give my own experience in demonstrating absent treat
ments. In a former lesson on the WILL, I have told you
of the power of sending out your thought-force, co-oper
ating with the Divine healing forces. In this manner your
thought can be clothed in any dress required by the quality
of thought sent forth by the sender. (It is a demonstrated
fact thoughts take form.)
(10) How do you treat an absent patient?
In this case in particular, I was called just before sitting
down to write to the telephone. The patient needed im
mediate help. They were in physical and mental distress.
(11) Now for this immediate contact with the patient
what was to be done?
(12) Being called from other duties was I fully pre
pared on an instant to contact the spiritual forces for Heal
ing? Was I quite in Union? God is ever in union with
us when we recognize him.
(13) In this case what was to be done?
This is my method and should be all healers' method.
First, get into the silence, still the inner as well as outer
vibrations then I can contact the finer forces of nature.
(14) But how can I do this quickly?
Music is a quick aid, with deep, rhythmic breathing to
count of seven, for music is one of God's great blessings
to man and a great connecting link for me, just now in
this particular case of absent treatment then calling upon
the Divine Healing forces of God.

132 ON THE PATH
You may not have a musical instrument! I have seen a
whole audience become attuned to the Spiritual vibrations
through a harmonica. Anyone can have one. Although not
playing any particular tune, can produce and strike har
monious cords or sing softly, this lifts your vibrations
quickly. For both absent and physical contact with the
patient, 1 use the piano.
This particular patient for treatment, I take now with
me in thought to the piano. Visualizing them sitting in a
chair by my side, perfect, knowing God is perfect and is
omnipotent, omnicient and omnipresent with them. They
apart of this great cosmic consciousness (which is universal
reality, absolute and perfect in creation).
I in the allness of the all, am ready now to contact the
Spiritual forces through the God consciousness.
(15) Then what must be done?
I become conscious of this union by attuning the sensi
tive strings of my nature to the Spiritual healing vibrations
with the allness of God.
(16) What does this do?
I arise as it were, in this manner above the flesh concept
of life, where conditions cannot effect me, then the God of
my being is the great physician. The instrument used for
the Father's work, my mind, is the great dynamo of God,
all used by the Divine healing forces. In this vibration I
have instantly reached and touched my patient, through co
operation with God's loving forces, knowing the work is
done.
(17) Through me?
Through my willingness to loan my receptive instrumen
tality to God's finer forces. I have been the instrument to
lift their trolley again into higher vibrations of conscious
life where they make their Divine Contact. Remember I
have found this simple method a good one, for the simple
things of life are the real things of God. You may discover
a still better way to reach those who need your aid for
there are numerous methods, all are good. The one that
reaches your patient with the best results is the method for
you to use.
(18) What is the most important thing?
It is to be SPIRITUALLY AND PHYSICALLY FIT
to be the instrument in God's service of healing the sick.

THE TREATISE ON HEALING 133
Longfellow knew of this great need of contact with the
finer forces, through the silence he recognized the power
of silent meditation when he gave to us these wonderful
lines of power for healing:
Enter into that inner stillness,
That inner stillness, for that inner healing,
That perfect silence, where the lips and heart are stilled,
Where I no longer entertain my own imperfect thoughts
And vain opinions,
But God alone speaks in us.
And we wait in singleness of heart, to know Thy will
And in the silence of the Spirit, to do thy will,
And to do it only.
I often repeat this for the patient I am treating, also
have them repeat it with me.
(19) What benefit is it?
Thus they become in closer union with the healer and
the forces working through the healer.
It is in this perfect stillness, calmness, peace of Soul and
At-one-ment that your patient is retuned, by the Divine
forces and healing power, from those who work it is, to
come to the aid of distressed humanity. Then like the balm
of Gilead flows the electric and magnetic currents through
the dynamo freely to the patient either present or absent.
(20) What aid is knowledge of Divine Law toward
perfect health?
It is the open doorway aiding all to become superior in
power, learning the secret the art of healing self and others.
(21. What should the patient first do to aid the healer
and themselves?
To LET GO and relax.
The patient must LET GO of the abdominal walls and
solar plexus and learn to breath from the solar plexus
rhythmically. An occultist will soon discover the deepest
sorrows and the greatest joys effect this physical anatomy.
(22) Can one learn to send the thought-force to any
part of the body out of harmony?
One can learn through practice to do this (by breathing
through rhythmic counts of seven) thinking and suggest
ing to the effected part through powerful affirmations and
suggestions.

134 ON THE PATH
(23) What does this accomplish?
You are rebuilding and recharging with new life energy,
through yo«r own great mind forces. THIS IS APPLIED
PSYCHOLOGY.
(24) What else is needed?
To RELAX, LET GO. Freedom is what is needed.
Use this affirmation for freedom and malignant growth:
"I AM just now at peace with ALL the world. I AM
receiving the healing currents of Spiritual life. New life
and energy is flowing through me, with perfect circulation.
The nerve cells are giving perfect STRENGTH, VITAL
ITY and ENERGY to (naming the organ of the body out
of harmony.. I feel the inflow of healing love permeating
my WHOLE BEING. I dissolve all inharmony and disease
by my concentrated thought-force and the co-operation of
God's great agencies.
This must be repeated as often as possible. Seeing the
body in perfect wholeness. Keep this affirmation up long
enough, it will dissolve any inharmonious condition. I have
demonstrated this fact.
TREATMENT OF THE PATIENT— present)
As in absent treatment, I harmonize with the music,
some beautiful thought or prayer is also very good, for one
must be attuned to healing force*.
(25) What of the personal contact with your patient?
The first thing I do is to seat them comfortably. Then
ask them to LET GO AND RELAX. That they may
come up higher in consciousness. Many say they cannot do
this; yet they have LET GO of their Divine supply the
real thing that keeps them in contact with God conscious
ness. Through WORRY AND FEAR of what might be.
(26) Is it necessary to get the patient in a cheerful
frame of mind?
It is very necessary to change the vibrations as quickly
as possible. Suggest something of cheerful conversation to
cause them to laugh if possible, that they may forget them
selves. This is where music or a song appropriate for heal
ing is good, all the time commanding them to LET GO of
the physical body, for when in mental or physical distress,
they have unconsciously tensed the whole body, especially
the solar plexus this center of their being is pitiably cramped.

THE TREATISE ON HEALING 135
(27) What benefit is music in healing mentally or phy
sically?
It assists your patient to LET GO. They gradually rise
upward in consciousness where they can more readily feel
the real contact with the healing vibrations, where they LET
GO of the unreal, to grasp the real —where they discover
their treasure house of energy and Divine supply. Where
they LET GO of the outer world of things to enter into that
inner world where is found health, wealth, peace and joy,
that comes from the fountain of at-one-ment with God.
(28) When the patient is quieted and they have LET
GO and relaxed, what step is taken?
The Healer must become conscious of the flow of new
life and healing power through their hands.
For a Healer knows that the hands and finger tips con
tain grey matter-intelligence, and that they are connecting
links or wires with the brain and solar plexus; then say with
Job, with His lamp shining upon my head and by his light,
I walk through darkness. Job: 29:3.
And John 4:4. Greater is he that is in you; than he
that is in the world.
With this knowledge of God's greatness, you are prepared
and attuned to the spiritual scale with the Divine enflow of
healing forces of spirit at hand to recharge the patient,
through rechemicalization. Knowing you do nothing from
your own individuality, but from the power of the great
infinite. The words of faith and of courage must be spoken,
affirm you are one with this all ominipotent power, one
with the healing currents, etc., this Jesus meant when he
caid, "I of myself do nothing."
(29) Should the Divine Healer inspire faith in the
patient?
By all means. Paul said, "Faith is the substance of
THINGS HOPED for the evidence of things not seen."
A practitioner or Healer knows well how necessary it is
to instill Faith in a patient. Those of the Materia Medica
profession are realizing what it means to give the POSI
TIVE THOUGHT and mental suggestions to their pa
tients. "The tongue may speak to human ears, but Souls
are reached by Souls that speak to Souls through the Di
vine. The Divine Healer becomes through their own de
veloped intuition and God consciousness infused with nec

essary faith; thus trying to impart the same to the patient,
bringing about a transformation by the renewing of your
mind. Reaching this height of realization they know their
own and the patients need.
(30) Is faith always needed?
No, there are times not even faith is needed to accom
plish the healing, although it is a very good thing for the
patient to have faith in their physician or Healer.
(31) When you have calmed the patient and have them
prepared for the healing treatment what step do you then
take?
Stand behind the patient with the tips of the fingers
placed in center of forehead. Bring them gently backward
over top of ears to base of brain, then downward to should
ers following the arms, throwing off at the hands.
(32) Should one stop at the joints of any part of the
body?
No, it is very necessary to continue the strokes onward
beyond the joints always. Do this several times, then down
the spine, over the kidneys and spleen. Then treat the front
of the body in same manner—the vital organs, making
passes on down to the feet.
(33) Is it necessary to touch the patient in these treat
ments?
Many desire it, and it is very beneficial. Others can pro-•
duce the same lasting results without contacting the patient.
(34) Should one use their mental forces in these treat
ments?
By all means. I find the silent demand for freedom is
very necessary, as well as the powerful spoken words of
affirmations, as you heal instill through the spoken word
courage and faith in the power through suggestion. Thus:
you are immortal, you are strong and powerful. You have
strong will power to desolve all inharmony. You have free
dom and energy in every atom of your being and power
to desolve inharmony, bondage and limitations (all the time
realizing the God power in you). The God that speaks,
you then have no fear. Thus you instill in yourself and the
patient faith in your power to heal. (Know of myself I
do nothing but through God and the great HEALING;
powers, that work through me doeth the work of him who
sent me.)

THE TREATISE ON HEALING 137
(35) What should determine the length of treatment?
One should watch and be guided by intuition and that
power which works through you. When the force seems
to leave or lessen, quit immediately.
(36) Should a Healer be a Teacher?
Most certainly. They should ever be enlightening the
patient. Giving instructions —teaching them that the great
est need lies in their own mental powers to conceive their
own great need of co-operation with Divine law and how
to co-relate themselves with it for their own good. To es
tablish freedom, energy and fearlessness.
(37) When a Healer has eliminated fear from the pa
tient's mind, what is accomplished?
A great deal has been accomplished toward perfect heal
ing. Enumerate to them the many things THEY CAN do
to help themselves.
(38) Do many patients expect too much of a Healer?
They most certainly do. This is where they must be
taught the truth that "God helps those who help them
selves. This is where they must realize their own power
that they can become master of their own temple of God.
(39) How can the patient be taught how to increase
their own ability?
They should learn to use powerful affirmations of self-
suggestions, such as I have given in this lesson on healing.
There is nothing so harmful as discouraging self-suggestions,
such as thinking they are not going to get well and that
the physician, Metaphysician or Healer, will never be able to
.reach their particular case. In this manner the patient is
gradually building a wall around them, by their negative
thoughts, closing out the good and perfect healing by their
constant mental suggestions.
Fill the mind with positive statements of courage daily.
This will close the door of the conscious mind to adverse
thoughts of failure. Practice positive thoughts for what one
constantly thinks they can do, they surely can do.
This life is one big habit and immitation is another.
(40) Name a good habit for health suggestion.
A good habit is—think I AM going to be well, I WILL
be a success, THAT ALL WILL turn out best for MY
GOOD. The psychology for the business world and the
successful person is to expect big things. Never see defeat.

To hold tenaciously to the Faith in the thing they have
started out to accomplish. These are the ones who are sure
to win against ALL odds, who demands big things and
gets them, to know I AM success. To know I CAN BE
WELL and happy; it is my birthright. This is the mental
attitude and formula for daily thoughts and also to take
to your Healer and Physician.
(41) What has vibration to do with Healing?
It has everything. If you are in high rate vibration, yon
are well and usually prosperous and consequently you will
have a contented mind, that also brings you into Happy
vibrations. This also makes those around you happy, thus
vibrating in a successful mental atmosphere. Then, on the
other hand, the low mental rate of vibration one contacts
invariably attracts all opposite conditions bringing ill-health,
inharmonious conditions, in fact, attracting people and
things undesirable. Becoming out of rhythm with self and
the world they are in contact with.
(42) What is the psychological key to the Holy Temple?
Try each day to smile all things down. Determine on
arising in the morning to meet this day with a smile, clos
ing every negative thought or word from your conscious
ness. Give a smile to the solicitor at your door, wish them
success in their walk of life. They, too, are on the path
with you, even though you are ahead. More REASON to
thank God for the position you occupy. Forget the differ
ence in station of ALL you meet. See ALL on an equal,
if not superior. Rise above all discouragements and see
only the bright things which are many. If one will stop to
enumerate them, then be thankful and smile. Rise above all
petty things, say something nice to someone, try to make
them glad.
(43) Can I do ALL this?
Of course you can and much more. Try this receipt to
day, then you will so enjoy it and the fact you are master
of self for one day, you will want to try it another and
so on until you form this big habit, and others will want
to imitate you, then you will be starting a new link in the
chain of life that will be welded together by love and of
good fellowship for your neighbor, friends and all you
meet on the path of life.

accomplish THESE BIG THINGS for YOU are needed

THE RHYTHM OF LIFE
(44) What is necessary?
Rhythmic vibrations. Then "take time to be Holy."
When this is all summed up by the crystalization of the
thoughts by the many powerful affirmation, this is a great
aid toward helping in concentration of forces, which is not
only crystalizing and welding together the thoughts for
health. It is essential in success or any venture of life.
Without ostentation keep faith in God's infinitude, which
means unlimited. Knowing we are Finite and are LIM
ITED. Therefore, must work within God's LAWS. Teach
ers and Metaphysicians must reveal to the patient their possi
bilities of their own great being and their own power to
overcome.
(45) What happens to those who are forever thinking
of self?
These usually are the ones who are forever sick, nervous
and discouraged, for they are FOREVER THINKING and
talking of their troubles, their own unhappy conditions.
These are forever banking their own numerous LIABILI
TIES and not their assets.
This is where rhythm comes to the aid of those who
are willing to accept it in its fullness.
If you want to be morally, physically and mentally
healthy, one must LET GO of all these every-day worries
that bother the sensitive strings of life, never nurse them
but LET THEM GO.
(46) How can one reach this rhythmic vibration?
To get into rhythm with God's great universe, one must
learn TO FORGET. To do this is to LET GO of malice,
Jealousy and envy. Use a vacuum on the mind making a
thorough house-cleaning, for if you do not you are accu

mulating that which is like deadly poison to the physical
body.
(47) What of the tragedies in my life, you will say?
I cannot impress too forcibly this thought of LETTING
GO. LET GO of all the tragedies of life, you can and yon
must, if you hope to get your portion of Joy out of life.
I have told you life . is a bundle of habits. Get out of
the habit of clinging to trouble. LET IT GO. (But you
say I can't.) Oh, yes you can. Go out on your observation
train and you will find far greater tragedies in other lives,
making yours dwindle into nothingness. Too many are so
busy holding on to their own—fearing to LET GO of
them. They become too selfish in their trials and thought
of self to help some one else less fortunate than themselves.
(48) FEAR. What does that do to the health?
It tears down rhythm, poise and vibration. Many fear
the physical heredity of their ancestors until they actually
contract the malady. These must be taught to LET GO of
the thought of physical infirmity and establish in the mind
the thought of FREEDOM, realizing their oneness with the
God power and healing currents that surround them.
I cannot emphasize too forcibly upon your minds the
necessity of closing out FEAR. When the patient has per
fect trust in God, thus do they cast out FEAR, for then the
Spiritual consciousness is quickened into the realization of
their oneness with the Divine power and that God is omni
present.
(49) How many know what love means?
What real sacrifice means and many other things in the
esoteric meaning? This is why I emphasize the thought of
gaining daily more knowledge of Divine laws that one may
know themselves.
(50) What benefit is derived from this knowledge?
They will acquire knowledge of how to become creators
of harmony and of rhythm. Learn to harmonize the phy
sical body by filling the mind with thoughts of love for all
humanity, only then will thy own Soul learn to live in
rich fullness, filling their Soul with Divine essence of love,
goodness and consideration for others.

can of myself do nothing. The Father abideth in me,
does the work." Make your image clear and distinct, per
fect and symmetrical. This is imperative, whether it is
a thought-form for physical perfection for a home, auto
mobile, etc., if the thought-form is carried strong enough
and long enough, you can draw the thing to you, but be
sure it is something for your own good or good of an-
others, otherwise one may draw disaster to themselves,
there is a law, do not disobey it.
(52) What does disease mean?
It is lack of ease, caused by a lowering of vibration and
from the disobeying of some NATURAL LAW causing
inharmonious conditions. Learn to manifest freedom by
living a rhythmic life. LET GO of FEAR and WORRY.
This is a formula and foundation for health and perpetual
youth. Disease will not attack one whose mind is centered
upon the greatness of God's Divine Love and whose feet
are planted on the solid rock of FREEDOM'S rhythmic
shores, where the incoming of God's mighty tide washes
FEARS of coming trials and disasters from the mind,
bringing an INFLUX of precious peace and poise as the
choicest rhythmical music can calm and sooth a tired and
wearied Soul.
(53) How may I keep in rhythm with God's universe?
How can this be accomplished?
Hush the thunder of the tumultuous winds of strife,
seek the quietude of the vales. Learn to enjoy the hush of
night the beauties of the noonday, the trailing moonbeams
or the ocean's waves, the stars of night that shine as bright
for the poor and lowly as for the rich. Even God's beasts
in the forest with the soft tread. Learn to put the arms of
compassion around those in sorrow and distress and just
know, you are a link in the great chain with it all.
Silence the throbbing of the body. LET GO, say to
yourself through it all, be still in the depths of my Soul,
keeping in rhythm. Learn the art of TALKING in
RHYTHM, WALKING in RHYTHM, BREATHING in
RHYTHM. Permit every moment to be RHYTHMIC,

142 ON THE PATH
Jesus, whose intuition was so developed, HE KNEW who
was true and who was false, and where pretended love be
came a mockery.
An old Chinese Philosopher said, "Leave all things to
take their natural cause." For then only will things be
righted in time and in season. The darkest, muddy pool of
water if left quiet will clear itself. LET GO of all the ex
cess baggage carried so long. You will discover FREEDOM
of Soul never dreamed of, for looking upward beyond the
dark storm clouds will be seen God's sunlight still shining.
(54) What is THE DIRECT KEY?
Love is the key. The Master Jesus taught this always,
yet so few have it. It seems many have lost sight of
it in this mad rapid whirl of living. LET GO of this
whirl, ere it sweeps you outward, then you will discover
this KEY Jesus left, "Love ye one another." Apply it in
the lock that will open the door to the Kingdom of FREE
DOM and PEACE. Get to yourself, enter into the closet
that Jesus tells us and shut the door of the mind, FOR IN
THE GOLDEN MOMENTS of silence does God speak to
our tired Souls, peace and comfort. Go here often where
you can realize your oneness with God, and LET GO,
■where Divine Love can flow freely through you. Where
you liberate the mind from all thoughts of the outer world
and look within. There you will discover all, for what is
found within you, will be reflected to the outer world.
See yourself a perfect child. A Divine image in the Father's
love. This is where you LET GO, going higher where you
are above the storms and strife of earth conditions.
(55) Can I get into the habit of rhythmic breathing?
You easily can form this habit if you observe closely.
Let the thought of rhythm penetrate through and through
and exhibit it in all you do. SING, WALK, DANCE,
TALK, BREATH, all in rhythm, this is health. Those
constantly in the battle of life are at war with themselves,
but those who keep in perfect harmony and rhythm through
it all are the ones who succeed, becoming also a tremendous
aid to other people.
(56) How can I create?
One must recreate and rebuild daily by LETTING GO
and seeking the rhythmic law. All feel a deep impulse some
time in life to be of service. He who will love and give

service has the making of a Master. When one automati
cally becomes rhythmic in their daily walk of life, smiling
at this existance with a song in the heart. It not only in
spires and helps self but others also, for one must acquire
knowledge to tune their own instrument before they can
retune others. As you walk and talk in rhythm, you gain
strength and poise. The voice throws out greater strength,
then acquire knowledge of the science of rhythm of life
through vibrations, then you learn the road to health.
Genius never thinks it is great. Then permit yourself to
acquire the simple loving method of living through follow
ing the example the Christ demonstrated in his daily life.
(57) When one discovers the true definition and loca
tion of God, what is found?
Then one can easily discover the SOURCE of Divine
Supply and the road to perfect health and happiness.
There are a multiplicity of methods and ideas on heal
ing. ALL ARE GOOD. It is all Divine Healing, for all
originates from God.
(58) When the final analysis is taken, what does one
discover?
That the MIND (which should be the Master) has a
stupendous part to perform in the perfecting of the physical
body.
This seems not a marvelous fact to the students of psy
chology. This very necessary truth was discovered thou
sands of years ago, when the old philosophers said, "As a
man thinketh so is he."
The new applied psychology defines and analyzes its
vastness. "Make the mind work for you, not to pay Doc
tor bills, but to perfect the body by right thinking, then
one becomes their own physician."
These connecting links and methods of healing are numer
ous and called by various names, some healing by mental
telepathy, others by auto-suggestions, thought transference,
psythotherapy, some call it science of psychology, spiritual
healing, Divine healing, healing by laying on of hands,
mental science, self healing, etc. Whatever method used, it
must be acknowledged it is a great truth, for marvelous re
sults have been demonstrated.
Christ, the Healer, used various methods. Follow His
ideals, then one need have no fear of going wrong. The

144 ON THE PATH
Bible has a history of marvelous healings called miracles.
Here are just a few of them. Healing by magnetized articles
will be found in II Kings 4:29, Acts 19:11-2. In the
New Testament are many experiences. A few are Mathew
8:5-13, also 12:10-13, Mark 2:2-5, Luke 5:17-25, John
4:47-54 and Luke 9:11.
Old Testament:
Numbers 21:8-9; II Kings 5:1-14, I Kings 17:17-24.
Revelations 1:10, II Kings 4:18-37, and numerous other
places will be found in the Bible of healing. "Read your
Bible." The disciples were charged to heal the sick. In
Mathew 5:8, Luke 9:2, also 10:9, disciples heal the sick.
Acts 14:8-10, also 3:18. Gifts of Healing, I Corinthians
12:9-28.
Prepare Thy own temple first by prayer, powerful affir
mations, with high and lofty ideals, thus making it a fit
habitation for God, then put into practice any method of
healing that appeals to you most. Close out all fear, for
you do nothing of yourself but the complete form of heal
ing is given through you, not by you.
Realize that PERFECT FAITH AND TRUST will cast
out ALL DOUBT OR FEAR of results. The more ex
alted one becomes at this particular time, the easier and
free'er the healing power and force can do the work through
you. (Meditate on these Bible quotations for HEALING
when in silence.) Whatsoever things are true, honorable,
just, pure, lovely, of good report. Think on these things,
and the GOD of peace shall be with you. —Paul phil. 4:8.
Greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world
—John 4:4.
(The first thing in all HEALING is to recognize the all-
prevading presence and the all-powerful mind of GOD; is
able to heal any and all disease, both of mind and body.)
Learn what the mission of the solar plexus is and its re
lation to the Soul. (Awakening it into new life.)
(59) Have you perfect and full control of the physical
when you sit down in quietude, closing out the world?
If you have, the next step is—go further, be perfectly
still. Relax, LET GO, let every muscle take their normal
place and breath rhythmically, thinking constructively, for
only with proper thinking do you breath.

(For do you know you can only live four minutes with
out breathing.)
(60) But forty days without food? Then practice to
breath deeply and eat less. This means longevity and new
ness of life.)
This removes all pressure from the nerves and eliminates
that tention which so frequently produces physical exhaus
tion and mental defection.
(61) What does tention do?
TENTION leads to mental unrest, worry, care, fear
and anxiety, closing out the free circulation of blood from
millions of life cells.
(62) What must you do then?
Learn to relax, LET GO of the abdominal walls and let
the solar plexus breath, then daily and hourly you will be
building a new body.
(63) What does relaxation do?
It allows the solar plexus a chance to breath, the mental
faculties to exercise greater freedom. This is an absolute
necessity.
(64) Why is this true?
This is in order to allow the solar plexus really to func
tion. You will be surprised at the result of freedom and
rest your tired nerves receive.
(65) When the solar plexus contracts what does it do?
It withdraws the life giving force from the body. A con
tinued contraction of the nerves results in nervous tention,
causing many times nervous collapse and other dangerous
maladies.
(66) What does a great shock do to the solar plexus?
It contracts, shutting out the source of supply, unless
understanding the great laws governing the physical body,
for the solar plexus is the point where life is born. Love
radiates from this center. The contracting of the solar plexus
closes out the outflow by inharmonious condition, caused
by inharmonious thinking.
(67) What benefit is occult breaths and exercises?
They awaken the solar plexus, allowing it to shine forth
as a great Sun. Keep shining and no unkind words or ac
tions will disturb your peace of mind. Keep positively radi
ant—it wields an immense power for good to those less
positive than yourself. A radiant presence without the

spoken word often stills the turbulent minds that ar»
touched and distressed by earth's sorrows.
(68) What is the first great aid to breathing?
Thinking. You must form new habits of thinking and
breathing. You will find it hard at first to form this new
habit of deep rhythmic breaths. KEEP ON BREATHING
UNTIL YOU HAVE THE HABIT OF FULL RHYTH
MIC BREATHING. Those who are forever sick are those
who fail to breath correctly.
This thought I want to impress upon the student.
If you hope to reach the Kingdom of Health and Happi
ness, breathe right, until you form the habit.
This will become the most profitable of anything you
ever did. This will be a new habit of thought. Practice
breathing deeply and be sure you have plenty of fresh air
while doing it.
"Practice rhythmic breathing like you meant it." You
will soon discover the road to perfect health.
(69) Can one claim to give spiritual development to
another?
No—only a Soul ITSELF can earn it.
"Talk happiness and smile, it becomes habitual. Talk
health and practice optimism, it's contagious. It will be
come a part of your daily life. The world is already sad
enough."
"The Master Key," by Chas. Hannel, tells us, "In HIM,
we move and have our being" and we are told that He
"Is Spirit" and again that HE "Is Love." So that every
time we breath, we breath this life, love and spirit. This
is Pranic Energy, or Pranic Ether, we could not exist a
moment without it. It is cosmic energy; it is the life of
the solar plexus.
Every time we breath we fill our lungs with air and at
the same time vitalize our body with Pranic Ether, which
is life itself, so that we have the opportunity of making a
conscious connection with ALL LIFE, ALL INTELLI
GENCE AND ALL SUBSTANCE. "Let your soul out
of its shell and grow."

of love and healing power, through which the Infinite
healing power can focus a ray of healing Wisdom, which
gives me dominion over every state of body and mind
through which I may become MASTER. I will broad
cast over the radio activity of my mind HEALTH TO
ALL THE WORLD WITH SUCCESS TO ALL, MA
TERIALLY AND SPIRITUALLY.
Go now, dear students of truth, carefully and prayer
fully, out on your observation car and psychologically study
self with this foremost thought that "I see encompassed
about me (as you pass this way but once) health, wealth
and success. On every side I am viewing unsurpassing beau
ties for me to utilize as my own."
Familiarize yourself in passing with all the things that
are yours to have and to hold knowing "All the Father
hath is mine."
There is but one great power in the Universe, a vast
reservoir of HEALTH, STRENGTH and NEWNESS OF
LIFE, whereby, on this "Path of Life" all can make tang
ible connection but do not expect all roses, unless there
were some briars one WOULD NOT thoroughly enjoy the
beauty, fragrance and fullness of life. For the rose needs
constant cultivation to bloom and give forth to you its
sweetest fragrance.
If one travels onward with undaunted courage toward
this rising sun of a new day, still a greater heritage and
knowledge of limitless power and ability will meet you on
reaching the end of this life's journey. Then one will step
forth from earth's observation car, transfering to one of
greater beauty and splendor, traveling onward through eter
nity on evolution's train, striving still to reach the meridian
of truth. Be not afraid to put your loving arms of com
passion around those needing you. For your fare must be
payed THROUGH SERVICE. Heal the sick, comfort the
sorrowing, do not weary in well doing, God's storehouse
is full for those who give.
Light will be upon the path to guide your footsteps in
the right direction. You should have NO FEAR, for God's
great power and protection surrounds you, for the Christ
CONSCIOUSNESS well developed enlists myriads of forces
to aid in constructive useful activity "upon the path" of
the Souls' Evolution.

(AFFIRMATIONS)
Have a specified time each day to relax, LET GO, and
silence the throbbing body. Meditate on your powerful
affirmations.

Through awakened Soul intuition:
I BECOME a self centered generator,
IN THIS Christ consciousness,
I AM full of love and healing power,
THROUGH WHICH the Infinite Healing
POWER CAN focus a ray of
HEALING WISDOM,
WHICH GIVES me dominion over
EVERY STATE of body and mind
THROUGH WHICH I may become Master.

RHYTHMIC BREATHS
With deep, slow inhalation and exhalation to count of
seven for each line:
I have freedom from fear for I have INCREASING

THE TREATISE ON HEALING 149
From out this temple I speak peace to the world with
loving service —
I AM in at-one-ment with the Master physician.
In these stated periods for meditation, affirmations and
prayer, one gets a firmer grip of self-possession and poise,
coming forth to contact the outer world and its activities
with greater calmness and generosity.
"EVENING AFFIRMATION"
I know there is a sacred shrine within my mental world.
I must look often therein and see what I have hanging upon
its walls.
If I would dwell in this Sacred Shrine, this inner room
of the Soul, and rest, I must BE STILL and know, I
must enter this room in sacred silence. I must keep it in
order. To do so, I must LET GO, relax and look within,
knowing God is ever present, therefore, I have no fear, for
this sacred room is a pure, sweet avenue for my soul to
manifest through my physical to the world. Out of the
DEPTHS of the stillness I THANK THEE, Oh Infinite
Father, for the day and Divine protection through this
night, for strength and peace that now keeps this TEMPLE
in perfect order. I now am at PERFECT PEACE, LOV
ING ALL, FORGIVING ALL. I speak peace to all the
world.
Expect healing and see how quickly you are benefited.
Emile Coue's affirmation was "Day by day, in every way,
I am getting better and better," but to it should be added,
"But I must work for it."
Just as you work for Realization, Illumination, Health,
Peace and Spiritual Sunshine.
AFFIRMATION FOR MIND POWER
I AM an awakened Soul because I AM formed of the
Soul substance of the Eternal One. I CAN no more die
than my Father God; therefore, I speak the words of
HEALTH, PEACE, FREEDOM AND NEW LIFE, I AM
MASTER of this physical body for MY MIND now be
comes master.

150 ON THE PATH
Through willingness to do Thy Divine will obeying the
law, hath made my body whole.
I will now keep my thoughts in a channel that will help
me to love, work and study elevating literature, that I may
renew my mind daily and fill my consciousness with re
newed courage and higher ideals.
Through thought affirmations 'I will acquire a firmer
hold of the LIGHT that radiates from the Great SOLAR
PLEXUS of PEACE, POWER and NEW LIFE."
HEALTH AFFIRMATION
Emphasize the I AM—I AM power, I AM health, I
AM success, materially, physically, spiritually. Father free
me from bondage of the flesh, from all limitations or illu
sions of any kind, "All that the Father hath is mine," and
the Father's supply is unlimited.
To be well in body I must also be pure and noble in
mind and consciousness.
My thoughts must travel on the path of purity and up
rightness, thinking all Souls are traveling on the path in like
manner. If I AM permitted, on the pilgrimage of the Soul's
Evolution to pass them, I will offer up a prayer for
strength and light to aid their pilgrimage on the path.
(A mind that is easily charmed by false flattery and ap
pearances cannot see the better things when the Soul is on
the path of Divine light can they discriminate correctly.)

LESSON FOR SILENT MEDITATION AND PEACE
AND FOR DETERMINATION, CONCEN
TRATION AND FREEDOM
Go alone into the silence, RELAX, LET GO, permitting
the mind to lead, breathing deeply as you do so, to the
rhythmic count of seven. (For every sentence) this is
VERY necessary and beneficial.
Before entering the silence, stand erect, raise the arms
upward above the head, one deep inhalation as you do so
to the count of seven, then gently lower arms, touching
floor (as near as you can) to the same rhythmic count of

seven, exhaling breath, speaking the word, peace, as you
do so.
(70) What does this accomplish?
This is very necessary to raise the vibration above the
sewerage of the mental sea one contacts in their daily life,
here you sense greater freedom and peace, freeing the mind
of all mental cob-webs. Be not satisfied with self lest you
stop progressing. "Woe to him who is fully satisfied."
(SILENT AFFIRMATION)
Now enter the silence with a prayer, for all good to
FLOW TO YOU. Concentrate for a time on PEACE
AND HARMONY: Then slowly affirm.
I KNOW there is no limit to the heights I can attain.
I HAVE STRENGTH, FORCE and POWER equal to my
DEMAND.
■
In this manner I AM in the fmllness of life,
expecting the best to come to me.
Through this realization, do I ever draw the refreshing
waters from the deific fountain of life—with the realiza
tion of still greater possibilities —seeking always this path
way that leads me onward toward the rising sun, on its
horizon, do I see greater promises for me and for all who
are willing to take and to hold. Only now do I really
live, seeing by its brightness, to walk on life's path, for
health and wealth are my Divine heritage. In this do I
discover how to live scientifically. Then keeping my mind
closed to all negative thoughts; thus becoming receptive to
all pure, ennobling thoughts.
This is cosmic life (the allness of the all), for it unites
me with the Universe and the laws governing it. I AM
NOW keyed to the perfect RHYTHM of life, in TIME
and TUNE. In this vibration I AM in harmonious rela
tionship with the higher spheres. Through nature I hear
God's music and His secrets are revealed to me. Through
my awakened consciousness I AM in co-operation with
God's universal laws. The sensitive strings of my nature
are now keyed to the harmony of the spheres and ALL
LIFE. ILLUMINATION NOW LIGHTS MY PATH
WAY. ALL IS PEACE.
A splendid lesson on HEALTH IS—
"Give your body the benefit of plenty fresh AIR, SUN
SHINE and WATER. This is the greatest and safest tonic.

152 ON THE PATH
With a rest period occasionally, where all cares, worries and
work are forgotten, living in God's great out-of-doors with
nature, remember, just reading these affirmations will get
you no where. It is in practical application only will you
get value received. As in everything else worth while.
We discover on first investigation, there are so many
beautiful principles ON THE PATH of truth that it is dif
ficult to decide where to begin, although the only scientific
method is—"start at the basic principles," to gain full
knowledge of the law, then there will gradually be un
folded and revealed, the great powers inherent and dormant
in each Soul that need only the creative thought to awaken
them to greater possibilities. Ignorance and superstition is
fast disappearing, progressive people are thus lifting human
ity out of the old conventionalism placing their feet UPON
THE PATH of a greater realism.
Through the higher psychology of self unfoldment one
is given the key, but the Soul alone must have the knowl
edge of how to correctly apply it; to know self and the
limitless possibilities of thought power is to have the key
to the Kingdom of life that leads all Souls to still greater
possibilities ON THE PATH.
One gets out of anything just to the measure of inter
est, desire, hope and aspiration manifested. Everything in
life worth while is accomplished through work.
Store all the affirmations and constructive thoughts
throughout the lessons in the sub-conscious to be tapped
when needed.
If you permit your thoughts to be unprejudiced with
out condemnation, laying aside bias and preconceived ideas
until you have gone through these pages, with unreserved
opinion, you will discover many facts of helpfulness that no
longer are hidden as you familiarize yourself with the Uni
versal laws of life. Glean all you can from the thoughts
expressed in its pages, then keep going onward and beyond
with still a greater urge for TRUTH. Tuning into greater
currents of thought to higher and still nobler ideals ON
THE PATH.

onward ON THE PATH," even though sorrows visit my
door or privation enter, nor permit the relentless steel of

I thought were trusted friends, wound my soul.
Yet will I walk with head erect;
AND STILL KEEP LIVING ON.
NOT UNDERSTOOD
We move along asunder,
Our paths grow wider,
As the seasons creep along the years.
We marvel and we wonder.
Why life is life and then w«r fall asleep,
NOT UNDERSTOOD.
We gather false impressions,
And hug them closer,
As the years go by,
Till virtue oft' times seem to us transgression.
And thus men rise and fall and live and die,
NOT UNDERSTOOD.
The secret springs of action,
Which lie beneath the surface and the show are disregarded,
And with self satisfaction,
We judge our neighbor and they often go,
NOT UNDERSTOOD.
Not understood? How trifles often change us,
The thoughtless sentence, or the fancied slight.
Destroy long years of friendship and estrange us,
And on our Souls there falls a freezing blight,
NOT UNDERSTOOD.
Poor Souls with stunted visions.
Oft measure giants by their narrow gage,
The poisoness shafts of falsehood and diresion,
Are oft' impelled against those,
Who mold the age,
NOT UNDERSTOOD.
How many hearts are breaking,
For lack of Sympathy —-Ah day by day,
How many cheerless, lonely hearts are aching,
How many noble spirits pass away,
NOT UNDERSTOOD.
