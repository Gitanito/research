FOREWORD
In presenting this analysis of the experiences of Mr. G. W.
Ballard I have endeavored to be accurate and fair. I have
disregarded reports and rumors about the Ballards, and have,
instead, taken their published writings and their actual
statements in a sincere effort to decide whether they are what
they claim to be. It is in no sense a personal attack on Mr. and
Mrs. Ballard, but it is published to help those who care to read
it to decide whether they are willing "to forget everything
else they have ever studied" (as the Ballards insist they do)
and follow only the Way of Life as given by the "Author
ized Messengers" of Jesus the Christ and Saint Germain the
Ascended Master.
I have, therefore, directed the searchlight of reason and
analysis upon their statements (something they urge their
students not to do) in an endeavor to find whether they are
worthy to be followed. I would prefer to keep this analysis
to myself and use it for my own purpose; in fact, much of
it was originally written to prove to myself whether the
transcendental things that Mr. Ballard tells about could be
true.
Finding so much that was wanting from the standpoint of
accuracy and truth, and knowing that many thousands of
people were following the teachings without question on the
word of two individuals, I, in time, came to the decision
that it was my duty to let others read
it,
for many people
would not have the time nor aptitude for such analysis.
One of the reasons that influenced me to publish this com
mentary on the Ballard teachings was the statement of
a
valued friend, who said in substance:
"If you were following
a
certain teaching which seemed
to bear the stamp of truth and had decided to give up every

thing else, and someone better informed than you showed you
unmistakably the errors it would lead you into, perhaps for
many lives, wouldn't you be everlastingly grateful to that
individual for enlightening you?"
"Why, yes, I would," I had to reply.
"Well, then," she said, "why don't you do the same thing
for others? You have certain startling disclosures which
would be invaluable in helping striving souls to discriminate
between Truth and Error. Why keep this information only
for yourself or for an intimate few?"
Therefore I am sending it out. Some will take
it,
no doubt,
as an attack on the personality of the Ballards and will
promptly say that
I
am an agent of the "sinister force." Or
they may think that
I
am attacking the idea of the "I AM
Presence" within. Neither
is
true.
I
am only interested in dis
covering the TRUTH, the "Way of Life," as
I
believe many
who read this analysis will be. With
it
goes compassion, and
a
prayer to Mr. and Mrs. Ballard, and their son, Donald, that
they may always face the Light and Truth of their "Mighty
I
AM Presence."

THE "TRUTH" STANDS EVERY TEST
In the great heterogeneous mixing-bowl of life there are
many ingredients which are not always able to endure the fires
of analysis and testing.
But real Truth, like pure gold, fears no testing. It will hold
up under the most rigid inspection. It will bear the acid test
of criticism without flinching. It will cry out in vibrant
voice: "Test Me! for I am Truth." It will never seek to pre
vent investigation.
Seekers after the Gold of the Spirit as we are, we must
apply certain tests, as does the dealer in precious stones and
metals. Foolish would be the connoisseur of precious things
if he didn't. He would have many blemishes in his gems and
alloy in his gold. So would we if we accepted any teaching or
philosophy blindly without applying the tests of reason,
analysis, and intuition, which are divine gifts of God to man.
It is characteristic of all truly great teachers in these West
ern lands that they encourage their students to seek for Truth
in their own individual way, never to have them follow
blindly any doctrine or teaching. They know that Truth is
many-sided like a diamond of many facets, and they never
say they have the only truth. Even the Christ stood mute
before Pilate when he was asked, "What is Truth?" This great
Master knew that Truth could not be revealed in its entirety
to others; that Pilate had to find it within himself, as do we,
and not from any outside Master, ascended or unascended;
that it could not be handed on a "silver platter."
Will you follow with me, reader, to apply these tests to the
Ballard teaching? If it is the Truth it can do no harm; if it is
not, the sooner we know it the better.

HOW DATES DISPROVE MR. BALLARD'S
EXPERIENCES
In Mr. G. W. Ballard's first book, "unveiled mysteries,"
written under the 110m de plume of Godfre Ray King, he tells
of the beginning of his extraordinary experiences with the
spiritual Being whom he calls Saint Germain. He says in the
Foreword of that book, Page XII, that:
"... these experiences are as Real and True as
mankind's existence on this earth today, and
that they all occurred during August, Sep
tember, and October of 1930 upon Mount
Shasta, California, U. S. A."*
In Mr. Ballard's second book, the "magic presence,"
Page XI of the Foreword, he says:
"This book contains the second group of
experiences ..."
We get a clue to the years that the "magic presence"
covers from Page 132 of that book. Here Saint Germain is
quoted as saying:
"One year from today, July 28, 1931, we shall
all meet again in the Cave of Symbols, and
Daniel Rayborn will complete the raising into
his electronic body ..."
Saint Germain spoke the above words on July 28, 1931.
One year after that date Daniel Rayborn was to make his
ascension. Accordingly we find on Pages 287 and 288 that
*The dates, quotations, and page numbers are taken from the first editions of the
Ballard books. Later editions may or may not have page numbers corresponding with
these quotations.
The italicized and bold-face type in the quotations are our own, as also the use of
small capitals in the presentment of contrasting passages.

he made his ascension on the night of July 27, just as Saint
Germain said he would. The year necessarily had to be 1932
(one year after July 28, 1931).
Then it is related in this book how Mr. Ballard, Rex and
Nada Rayborn, Bob and Pearl Singleton, began their long
trip to the Far East, and on Page 297 it is recorded:
"At four o'clock in the afternoon of the twenty-
eighth, we boarded the S. S. Majestic ..."
By reading Pages 292 and 293 it is discovered that the
month was unquestionably August, and the year had to be
1932.
NOW THE STRANGE, CONTRADICTORY, AND
UNEXPLAINABLE THING ABOUT THESE DATES IS
THAT IN THE THIRD BOOK OF THE SAINT GER
MAIN SERIES, THE "I AM DISCOURSES" (Page XV
of the Foreword), MR. BALLARD WRITES:
"The Thirty-three Discourses contained in this
book were dictated over a Visible Light and
Sound Ray in our home during 1932!!!!"
Remember that these thirty-three discourses were received
by both Mr. and Mrs. Ballard at their home in Chicago after
Mr. Ballard's return from the Far East.
NOW IF MR. BALLARD SAILED FOR INDIA IN
AUGUST OF 1932 TO BE GONE FOR MONTHS (as
the "Magic Presence" unquestionably indicates), HOW IN
THE WORLD COULD HE HAVE RECEIVED THE
"DISCOURSES" AT HIS HOME IN CHICAGO DUR
ING THE SUMMER AND FALL OF 1932?
The Arcturus Discourse in this third book (Page 357) was
given on July 4, 1932, and of course, like the others, at
Mr. Ballard's home in Chicago. The amazing thing is that

at this time Mr. Ballard was hundreds of miles from Chicago,
for the "Magic Presence" (Page 274) says:
"We made the trip to the mine [in Colorado]
with the Livingstons on the morning of July
seventh ..."
The year of course was 1932, for this trip to the mine
was made twenty days before the asserted ascension of Daniel
Rayborn (July 27, 1932), and before Mr. Ballard's Far East
trip.
Now let us take another discourse, and check it by means
of the dates. The first of the Saint Germain discourses listed
in the book is the one given on Page 1 under date of October
3, 1932. This, too, is impossible, for if the "Magic Presence"
is correct, Mr. Ballard was at that time thousands of miles
from Chicago on his way to the Far East, having sailed
August 28 [1932], as stated on Page 297 of the "Magic
Presence."
And so it is with practically all the "I AM Discourses"
appearing in this third book. They were supposed to have
been given during the months of October, November, and
December of 1932 (see Page XIX of the contents for con
firmation of this) , and were dictated at Mr. Ballard's home
in Chicago while he was personally present in the flesh. Yet,
the "Magic Presence" says that he was during those same
months traveling (as you and I might travel) in the Far East
with Bob, Rex, Pearl, Nada, and others of the party.
Taking another date, the date that Mr. Ballard was sup
posed to have been present at the Ascension of Daniel Ray-
born in Wyoming (quite definitely stated in the "Magic
Presence" as July 27, 1932), he simply could NOT have
been there, for if the "I AM Discourses" are correct, he had

already by that date received the Arcturus Discourse of July
4, 1932, at his home in Chicago.
On Page 336 of the "Magic Presence," Mr. Ballard and his
party were told, while at the Arabian Retreat, that they would
"go to India for a stay of ten months' training." This
would mean that if he left as he said he did, August 28
(1932), it would be well into 1933 before he could return
to America. Yet he was receiving the discourses in Chicago
in 1932!
There is no denying that there is damaging discrepancy of
the time element in these three books. Mr. Ballard writes a
narrative of personal experiences beginning August, 1930,
on Mount Shasta and running through date after date "in the
order in which the events occurred" (as it is said in the Edi
tor's Note in the second edition of "Unveiled Mysteries"),
until he received the discourses over the Light and Sound Ray
in his home in Chicago during the Summer and Fall of
1932 â€”a period of just two years. And yet if his various
experiences are followed through and carefully checked, they
embrace a period of three yearsâ€”from August, 1930,
to the time that he should have received the discourses after his
Far East trip, which should have been in 193 3 and not 1932.
It will be noticed that all through this analysis we have
used the date given on Page 132 of the "Magic Presence" as
one of the chief "key" dates. There Saint Germain is quoted
as saying:
"One year from today, July 28, 1931, we shall
all meet again in the Cave of Symbols, and
Daniel Rayborn will complete the raising into
his electronic body ..."
Now if it is argued that the day Saint Germain was speak
ing was really July 28, 1930, and not 1931, then that, too,

would be an impossible date, for Mr. Ballard on July 28,
1930, had not even contacted Saint Germain. His experi
ences with Saint Germain "occurred during August, Sep
tember, and October of 1930 upon Mount Shasta," says
his first book, "Unveiled Mysteries." The correctness of the
year (1930) is verified on Page 244 of "Unveiled Mysteries,"
where Mr. Ballard says:
"... the morning of December thirty-first,
nineteen hundred thirty, came ..."
Also on Page 260 of this same book, in the Royal Teton
at the close of the old year, 1930, he says:
"All passed before Lanto, and received individual
instruction for the work of nineteen thirty-
one ..." (which of course was the new year) .
These same dates appear in the second edition of "Unveiled
Mysteries." Although the book has been completely reprinted
and punctuation marks changed, there has been no change
in these dates, so the dates could hardly have been a mistake
or a typographical error.
It is simply impossible to explain this discrepancy of dates,
and we are brought to the conclusion that despite Mr. Bal
lard's repeated and earnest assertions that "every word re
corded in these books is true," the dates themselves prove that
this is not so. One cannot crowd three years of actual experi
ences into two years of time.

MR. BALLARD DID NOT SAIL ON THE S. S. MAJES
TIC DURING AUGUST OF 1931 OR 1932!!!
Another damaging piece of evidence against the truth of
Mr. Ballard's experiences is that furnished by the Cunard
White Star Line of 2 5 Broadway, New York City. The fol
lowing is a verbatim copy of their letter:
June 19th, 1936.
Dr. G. B. Bryan,
109 J2 Weyburn Ave.,
Westwood, California.
Dear Sir:
We would thank you to kindly refer to your
communication of June 1 1th relative to informa
tion concerning a certain passenger allegedly to
have sailed in the "Majestic" which we find left
New York on August 24th, 1931, and August
19th, 1932, calling in both instances at
Cherbourg.
We have checked up our list for these sailings,
but cannot find that the names of G. W. BAL
LARD, GODFRE RAY KING, Robert Liv
ingston, Bob Ray born nor Pearl Ray born appear
thereon.
If you should have any further information
that might help us we will be glad indeed to check
up the matter for you again.
Very truly yours,
CUNARD-WHITE STAR LIMITED.
Cabin Dept.
GWR/AS
It will be recalled that Mr. Ballard said he sailed for the
Far East on August 28 (Page 297, "Magic Presence") . The
steamer did not sail on that date!

"SAINT GERMAIN" OF THE BALLARDS
Perhaps the reader will begin to wonder at this point about
the Being whom Mr. Ballard refers to as "Saint Germain"
and who assertedly has dictated most of the discourses appear
ing in the third book: "The I AM Discourses."
And he will ask: "Considering the inaccuracies of the first
two books, is it safe to put any reliance upon the third book
which Mr. Ballard said Saint Germain dictated over the Light
and Sound Ray?"
Personally, I believe it is well to read the "I AM Discourses"
in the same way as the intelligent person reads any other piece
of literatureâ€”with a proper degree of discrimination. Even
the Bible, among discriminating persons, is not accepted one
hundred per cent as the Word of God.
Students of the Ballards have, during the past year or two,
built up in their minds a love and a devotion for Saint Ger
main second only, or equal, to Jesus. This they have done
simply on the word of two individuals.
Mr. Ballard, writing in "Unveiled Mysteries," says that
when Saint Germain was King and Emperor of the Sahara
civilization 70,000 years ago, he was a Being of marvelous
power, and was referred to on Page 5 J as one of the "Great
Selfless Ones." On Pages 149 and 152 he is called "Master
Saint Germain," during the Inca Civilization 14,000 years
ago.
Writing in the March issue of their monthly magazine, the
"voice of the i am," Page 5, the Ballards say of Saint
Germain:
"His last embodiment was that of Lord Francis
Bacon, who was the son of Queen Elizabeth ..."

Now if Saint Germain was such a marvelous and powerful
Being thousands of years ago, it is difficult to picture him in
his last embodiment as Francis Bacon, one who, despite his
splendid abilities, was quite human, as the following historical
account will show; quoting from "Myers General History"
(Ginn & Co.) :
"The close of the life of the great philosopher
Francis Bacon was scarcely less sad than that of
Sir Walter Raleigh. He held the office of Lord
Chancellor, and yielding to the temptations of
the corrupt times upon which he had fallen,
accepted bribes from the suitors who brought
cases before him. He was impeached and
brought to the bar of the House of Lords, where
he confessed his guilt, pathetically appealing to
his judges 'to be merciful to a broken reed.' He
was sentenced to pay a heavy fine, and to im
prisonment in the Tower. But the king in pity
released him from all the penalty, and even con
ferred a pension upon him. He lived only five
years after his fall and disgrace, dying in 1 626."
I quote this in no way offering a criticism of Francis Bacon
and his splendid achievements, but merely to show the differ
ence between Jesus the Christ and Lord Bacon whom the
Ballards say made his ascension in that life, and was Saint
Germain.
Great as he was (and perhaps history has misjudged him)
it is certainly true that Lord Bacon was a human being with
faults and failings. Jesus, on the other hand, was a powerful
personality, who, if we are to believe the Gospels, had power
over the elements, and made such an impression upon the
world that the calendar of Western peoples was changed and

for 1900 years His life and teachings have given inspiration
to untold millions of striving souls. Therefore, it seems dis
tinctly out of place to raise Saint Germain (Lord Bacon)
to the status of Jesus the Christ.
Another unbelievable â€”or rather, impossible â€”thing is the
following. On Page 7 of the March, 1936, issue of the "Voice
of the I AM" the Ballards write:
"Saint Germain illumined and raised His body in
1684 ..."
Now, according to history, Francis Bacon died in the year
1626: And yet the Ballards say that he (as Saint Germain)
made his Ascension in 1684.
Mr. Ballard has frequently stated that the Ascension has
to be made in the physical body. How, then, could Lord
Bacon have made his Ascension 58 years after the re
corded DEATH OF THAT BODY?
In "Unveiled Mysteries" and the "Magic Presence" is
printed a picture of "The Ascended Master Saint Ger
main." Later, a well-known Los Angeles artist made another
picture of him, which appeared in the "I AM Discourses,"
and of which Mr. Ballard says it is: "an exact likeness as He
has appeared on many occasions in the Retreat." Comparing
these two pictures it is strange that there should be such a
difference between them. One would never think they repre
sented the same person.
The Theosophical and Rosicrucian Societies recognize an
Initiate into the Mysteries known as Saint Germain. How
ever, so far as the writer has been able to find out, there is no
official recognition from these Societies of the "Saint Ger
main" of the Ballards.

CONTRADICTIONS OF AN ALLEGED "ASCENDED
MASTER"
Let us at this time take the published statements of the
Ballards' "Saint Germain" and see whether they measure up
to our conception of what a Perfected Being might say.
On Page 92 of the "I AM Discourses," Saint Germain is
quoted as saying:
"To be aware of what is a thousand years in
advance is as easily and readily attained, in fact
more so, as going to your library in search of a
book."
Naturally, Saint Germain infers by this that he has this
power, and the same applies to other Ascended Masters,
because they are Perfected Beings. We would expect infalli
bility of prophecy by this statement. Yet it would appear
by another statement he makes that this is not so. I quote
from Pages 213-214 of the "Discourses":
"Until this focus of Radiation began, it was
doubted by most, except Nada and myself, the
possibility of establishing such a focus in this
busy Western World, but they did not know
what I did, it not having been revealed to
them, the fact of our long association [with the
Ballards of course] ... I said to them: 'The
time has come when there are those outside of
the Retreats, who can be made True Messengers
of the Light.' Thanks to you, I have been proved
right . . . Most of the time I have stood alone

We have a further proof of an alleged "Ascended Master's"
fallibility and inaccuracy of statement in the following two
statements:
On Pages 214-15 of the "Discourses" Saint Germain says:
"This good Brother [Mr. Ballard], until recently
of course has not known it, but for thirty
years he has been being prepared for it."
The other statement he makes eleven days later, on Page
244, which contradicts the first:
"This beloved Sister and Brother [Mr. and Mrs.
Ballard] have gone through thirty years of
strenuous, conscious preparation for this
work."
How in the world could a great Ascended Master say at
one time that the preparation was unconsciously made, and a
short time later say that it was consciously done?
And it was Saint Germain himself who said on Page 157
of the "Magic Presence":
"An Ascended Master makes no mistakes, of that
I can assure you."
Just to mention another mistake, or inaccuracy of state
ment (and there are many of them), I quote from his New
Year's Day Discourse, given January 1, 1936, at Los Angeles,
as recorded in the February issue of the "Voice of the I AM,"
Page 12:
"Seven thousand seven hundred students were
guests of the Ascended Masters at the Royal
Teton from ten o'clock last evening to four
o'clock this morning. Not in 200,000 years
has such a wonderous event taken place."

And in the same discourse (Page 14) he says:
"Not in over four hundred thousand years,
have so many students been prepared and per
mitted to visit a single retreat, as was experi
enced last night in the Royal Teton, showing
how very great is the expansion of the Light
within the hearts of mankind ..."
Here Saint Germain makes a mistake of 200,000 years in
dealing with the same event. But then, what can one expect
when decrees of TIMELESSNESS and SPACELESSNESS
are continually being made!
Saint Germain seemingly is always at Mr. Ballard's "beck
and call." In this respect, and many others, he is different
from most of the great Teachers and Masters. He instructs
Mr. Ballard in many of the ordinary things of life. So much
so that one would think that he would surely have told
Mr. Ballard about the erroneous dates in the books and the
typographical and grammatical mistakes. Particularly
so, when one remembers that the real Saint Germain was a
master of many languages. Surely a Being who is so infallible
and perfect as Mr. Ballard says he
is,
would not have per
mitted his teaching to go out in such
a
form, to become the
object of such
a
revealing analysis as this.
THE ASTRONOMY OF "SAINT GERMAIN"
Mrs. Ballard on the platform has frequently commented
on the statement of Saint Germain to the effect that "the
sun
is
NOT 93 million miles away, but less than
2
MILLION."

Material science is far from being infallible, but at the
same time one can hardly accept this statement of Saint Ger
main's without some little evidence that it is true.
It is strange that with the earth traveling around the sun
365 days in one year with a known rate of speed that it
could do so on such a short radius of less than two million
miles, when astronomers the world over are agreed that this
radius would have to be at least ninety-three million miles to
account for certain exact and regular stellar happenings and
the appearance of eclipses, lunations, and comets.
Working with the formula of 93,000,000 miles, our
astronomers never miss a sunrise to the exact split second, or
a new moon, or even such an irregular visitor as a comet.
Their system certainly works, and if the sun ISN'T ninety-
three million miles away, it seems that the burden of proof
should lie upon the shoulders of those of a different mathe
matical belief.
Even the Egyptian astrologers of the Great Pyramid times
(of whom we are given to understand that they had consid
erable occult information) figured the sun to be approxi
mately the same distance from the earth that our modern
astronomers do.
SOME EXAGGERATIONS
"Saint Germain" of the Ballards is also gifted with the
capacity for making exaggerated statements. Below I quote
just a few samples:
"You can just as easily find $10,000 in your
pocket as TEN CENTS." (Page 10, July,
1936, "Voice of the I AM.")

"You can renew any nerve, any organ, and build
any member of the body into its Perfection
almost immediately" (Page 42, "Discourses.")
"Your ability to illumine a room is just as easy
as physically illumining it through the electric
lamp." (Pages 59-60, "Discourses.")
"... with persistent effort and determination,
they would open the door and step through into
this great Inner Chamber, filled with such
Dazzling Light, jewels, gold, and substance
from which every kind of food in the Universe
can be precipitated." (Page 68, "Discourses.")
As yet there is no evidence that these powers are so easily
attained, even by the most sincere and persistent efforts of the
Ballard students, nor for that matter, by the "Messengers"
themselves.
Oh, let us not deceive ourselves, friends. Such powers as
mentioned above are only given after many, many lives of
arduous training and living the life. We certainly today
with all our greed, selfishness, and intolerance are not entitled
to them.
The ideal for us to live by is the example given by Jesus
the Christ. He, too, was tried, as we are being tried, by the
power and glory and riches of the world. But He rejected
them in no uncertain terms, and chose the pathway of service.
When He did any "precipitating" it was for others, not for
Himself.
Can there still be any comparison of equality between these
two individuals?

"JESUS" OF THE BALLARDS
Many sincere students of the Ballards have earnestly asked
themselves whether the Christ of the Gospels is really reveal
ing Himself at this time to the world through the Ballards.
Did He actually dictate some of the discourses, as the Ballards
say He did?
They fear to question this point, because they have been
warned repeatedly in no uncertain way that it is dangerous
for their soul's advancement to doubt or question. "Jesus"
of the Ballards tells them on Page 351 of the "Discourses":
"Let no one be so foolish as to doubt, for I AM
the Jesus, the Christ of Galilee, that you have
known of for the past two thousand years, that
is dictating this discourse and offering this assis
tance to you."
On Page 199 of the "Discourses" Saint Germain adds his
warning:
"Better were the students stoned in the streets
than to condemn, criticise, or judge the Light
that is given them ..."
Also on Page 337 of the "Discourses" Saint Germain says:
"Unfortunate indeed are those who criticise the
Messengers or the work. Better had they
never been born in this embodiment."
This intimidation by supposedly "Ascended Masters" is
absolutely contrary to the statements of Christ and many of
the Gospel writers, where we are warned, and warned re
peatedly, to be on our guard against false Christs and proph
ets. Paul says:

"Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the
spirits whether they are of God: because many
false prophets are gone out into the world."
(I John 4:1.)
Jesus Himself, adds His warning:
"... Take heed that no man deceive you. For
many shall come in my name, saying, I am
Christ; and shall deceive many." (Matt. 24:
4-5.)
"... If any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is
the Christ, or here; believe it not. For there
shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and
shall show great signs and wonders ; so as to lead
astray, if possible, even the elect. Behold, I have
told you beforehand." (Matt. 24: 23-25.)
In these nineteen hundred years this has literally come to
pass. There has been an array of "Christs" appearing in
human form throughout the centuries, and a goodly number
who have as "spirits" appeared in mediumistic circles. But
where are these "Christs" today?
In the name of God and of Humanity we should challenge
these "Christs" to prove themselves. "By their fruits ye shall
know them."

THE "I AM" CLOSED CORPORATION
Do you, reader, believe that the Christ of the Gospels
would select one lone individual (or two) to be His duly
appointed "Messenger" today when this same Mighty Being
said 1900 years ago:
"And lo, I am with you always, even unto the
end of the world" (Matt. 28: 20)?
Do you think that this Universal Soul could have said
what the Ballards say He said, in the April "Voice of the I
AM," page 26:
"Saint Germain, Myself [Jesus], or any other
Ascended Masters are not giving out teachings
of the "I AM" in the Western World, except
through Mr. and Mrs. G. W. Ballard and
their son Donald and those named to them and
under them"?
Do you think that Jesus the Christ would make a "family
affair" of His Teaching?
Do you think that the Christ of the Gospels would select
any "closed corporation" to tell the world about the
MIGHTY PRESENCE WITHIN when He speaks to ALL
by means of this same Presence, which IS the Christ Self?
He needs no external herald, no theatrical appearance, no
servitude to a few individuals; for this same Christ Presence
speaks to all in the gentle stillness of our own hearts if we will
but listen to HIM.
How can Christ then limit the "I AM" teachings to the
Ballards or any other family? And suppose he could, do you
think that He would select individuals who would have so

little appreciation of Truth or Accuracy as we have shown
the "Messengers" to have?
I ask you, "Do some of the statements of the 'Christ of the
Ballards' sound as though coming from the 'Man of Galilee'?"
For instance:
"I urge the students everywhere, with all the
love at my command, to forget everything
else you have ever studied." (Feb., 1936,
"Voice," Page J.)
In other words, Jesus is quoted as telling the student to
forget His own ministry given 1900 years ago. He is not
to read the Bible and other sacred books. He is no longer to
"hold fast to that which he has proven to be good" (as Paul
urges us to) , but he is to junk the whole works, burn his books
if he feels it necessary for his Salvation (Ascension) , and pin
his abiding faith to books that we have proved to be filled with
so much human error. "Jesus" of the Ballards says:
"The students will be wise indeed, no matter how
great their inspiration, to stand steadfast in their
use of 'Unveiled Mysteries,' the 'Magic
Presence,' the 'I AM Discourses,' and the
'I AM Adorations and Affirmations' . . .
there is naught else in the outer world today,
that will carry this conviction with so great a
power." (Feb., 1936, "Voice," Page 8.)
Also he says in same discourse, Page 7:
"Let no one desire to transcend or replace these
Beloved Messengers . . . They have proven
their ability to stand in the Light and with no
personal desire, carry unselfishly the Pure Un
adulterated Message of the 'Mighty I AM Pres

ence,' and until the Ascended Masters come
forth in their tangible, visible bodies, they will
remain the Direct Messengers of Saint Germain,
Myself, and Others of the Ascended Masters."
And toward the last of this discourse he says:
"We shall endeavor to make 'The Voice of the
I AM' the most sought after periodical of the
day ... It is my wish and that of the Host of
Ascended Masters, that all students of the 'I AM'
firmly decree this and stand by it."
I simply have to marvel at the audacity of printing such
evident ballyhoo for the Ballards and their publications, but
the greatest marvel of all is the way thousands of their stu
dents accept it as the Gospel truth and without question, as
though these are really the words of the gentle Christ of
Galilee.
In another discourse (Page 351-2 of the "I AM Dis
courses") Jesus is quoted as saying:
"... This work of Saint Germain and Myself is
entirely different from anything that has been
given forth to the Western World, because in
this work there are no human concepts or
opinions."
Of human concepts there are plenty, as we have shown.
Just another little sample is the following. In the Feb., 1936,
"Discourse" Page 6 of the "Voice of the I AM"), Jesus is
quoted as saying:
"Having before you the tremendous accom
plishment IN THE PAST FORTY YEARS, then
you must know, in the ever increasing intensity

of the greater creative activity, what must be
accomplished in the next two years."
But Saint Germain in the June, 1936, "Voice of the I AM,"
Page 10, says:
"There has been a great lull in the activ
ity OF OCCULT STUDENTS IN THE LAST FORTY
YEARS ..."
Which one of these "Ascended Masters" is right? One
says that there has been "tremendous accomplishment" in the
past forty years. The other, that there has been a "great lull."
Dear reader, run through the Gospel story again and com
pare the statements there with those made here. See whether
Jesus at any time told His students to read only certain books
or to make decrees for certain publications. Sad as it is to
contemplate, the Bible prophecy has again come true. Jesus
the Christ did not say these words.

THE MYSTERY OF MR. BALLARD'S BODIES
There are many contradictions regarding the bodies that
Mr. Ballard claims he used. He said on the platform many
times that he used a special body prepared by Saint Germain
when he went to Arabia and India, and that his own physical
body was left on a bed in a room at Denver. Considering the
fact that Mr. Ballard was (according to the "Magic Pres
ence") away in far-off India at least ten months, it seems
doubtful whether his unconscious body in Denver could have
lasted that long without food or drink.
The special body that Mr. Ballard used to go to Arabia
and India was, as Mr. Ballard has often said, a visible, tangible
body, "tangible enough to buy a railway ticket," and that in
this body he was able to drive an automobile, although in his
ordinary physical body he could not drive. This statement
is flatly contradicted on Page 42 of the "Magic Presence,"
where it said: "We took turns at the wheel . . . and drove
into camp." This was at the mine in Colorado, and he was
in his ordinary physical body. A few days after that, when
they returned to the ranch in Wyoming he again drove,
according to Page 54, where Mr. Ballard says: "Rex and I
took turns in driving." Yet on the platform he said he could
NOT drive!
It is strange that none of Mr. Ballard's books makes any
mention of the special body that Mr. Ballard said he used to
go to India. They read as if he went there in his ordinary
physical body, just like Bob, Rex, Nada, and Pearl did. Yet
on the platform (where he had to use his own name, Ballard,
instead of the nom de plume godfre ray king) he made
special mention of the fact that he had gone to India in a
special body that Saint Germain had prepared for him.

We wonder why Mr. Ballard brought up this idea of a
special body on the platform when his books do not mention
it? Can it be that he realized that his friends in America knew
that he had not gone to India physically during the time he
said he had, and so he had to tell the story of going there in a
sort of spirit body?
Is Mr. Ballard now living in the special body that Saint
Germain prepared for him, or has he gotten back into his own
body which was supposed to have been left in Denver when
he went to India? Sometimes he speaks as though he had
returned to his old body, and sometimes as if he hadn't.
If Mr. Ballard has gotten back into his own body, why
should he have had so much difficulty in living in it after his
return from India (as he said he had) , until "Saint Germain
lowered its vibratory rate to the physical octave"? His own
or old body did not have its vibratory rate "raised" in India,
so why did it have to be lowered in Chicago?
While in India, the "Magic Presence" says certain marvel
ous work was done on the body he had there, which, remem
ber, was the special body that Saint Germain had prepared
for him. It is strange that this special body would need any
work done on it, as it had been created by an Ascended Master
and could not have impurities. And yet a lot of "purification"
was done, as the following quotations will show. The Great
Divine Director speaks to Mr. Ballard and his party:
"... We shall give them bodies, such as have not
been manifest before upon earth; that they may
stand before the world a living example
. . . Shadow after shadow passed off like sheaths,
and the moment they left our bodies, were con
sumed." (Pages 387-8, "Magic Presence.")

Evidently it was the Great Divine Director's intention to
have Mr. Ballard retain this "purified body," and to have him
"stand before the world a living example" as he stated above.
So if Mr. Ballard is today in this "purified" body, one
would expect the utmost of perfection, a body as has "not
been manifest before upon earth," as stated above.
Now we hesitate to bring anything really personal into this
analysis, but such grandiloquent remarks as above really
justify one using the God-given power of sight to see whether
the body that "stood before the world" at the Shrine Class
in Los Angeles and elsewhere really measured up to the
perfection indicated by the Great Divine Director's remarks.
You be the judge in this.
Also at that same time in India, Mr. Ballard and his party
were told by the Great Divine Director:
"Under their control shall come the unlimited use
of the Cosmic Energy and the direction of the
Mighty Light Rays." (Page 387, "Magic
Presence.")
Mr. Ballard remarks:
"Our Inner sight and hearing were forever
cleared, and made our permanent servants."
(Page 388.)
Lastly, "a Voice from the ethers" spoke:
"All who enter here leave â€” forever â€” their
earthly garments behind." (Page 390.)
And Mr. Ballard says:
"Two days and two nights later, we emerged
from the 'Eternal Flame,' wearing our new
bodies of Immortal Endurance." (Page 390.)

According to these statements, Mr. Ballard has forever
left his earthly garments behind and is wearing a new-
body of immortal endurance. At the Shrine Class in Los
Angeles he said he was "living on extended time."
Now, if this be true, what has happened to his own body,
the body that he was born with, the one which was left on a
bed in Denver when he went to India in his special body
over four years ago?
Mr. Ballard says he is still "un-Ascended." Then, should
not Mr. Ballard's Ascension necessarily be made in his own
body, the one in Denver?
If that body is "dead," then Mr. Ballard cannot make his
Ascension in this life (as he says he will) because "Ascension
can only be made from one's own physical body."
If the Denver body is still "alive," what is going to happen
to his new body of "immortal endurance" when he goes back
to his own body for his Ascension in this life? It will endure
forever. Besides, should not the Denver body have been used
a little during these last four years, if it has to be prepared
for Mr. Ballard's Ascension?
If Mr. Ballard is in the body that he was born with (as we
confess we really think he
is,
despite all the above)
,
then the
Great Divine Director made
a
mistake in saying Mr. Ballard
would "stand before the world
a
living example" in his "body
of
immortal endurance." And yet we are told that "Ascended
Masters never make mistakes."
And what about Mr. Ballard's body that
is
being preserved
at the Royal Teton in
a
crystal casket? (See Page 123 of
"Unveiled Mysteries.")
It
is
simply TOO much to accept all these statements.
There are so many contradictions that the intelligent mind

must cast the matter of these bodies out as absurd. The fact
is that Mr. Ballard is in a body that is as human as ours. He
has to eat, drink, sleep, bathe, and attend to all the other
normal human functions. There is no "mystery" about his
body. The mystery lies in how a human being could imagine
all of it.

THE "LIGHT AND SOUND RAY" EPISODE
Why did Mr. Ballard on the platform make so much over
the coming of the "Light and Sound Ray" to his home in
Chicago in 1932 after his "return" from the Far East? On
the platform he tells about the "Light and Sound Ray" as
though it appeared to him for the first time in Chicago in
1932. He said that when it appeared he knew then that "at
last he had come home" and it changed his life.
Yet two years before this Chicago experience (if we be
lieve his writings) he had witnessed this same "Light and
Sound Ray" every day at the home of his friend in the
"Secret Valley."
"Every day" said Eriel, "you shall witness the use
of the Light and Sound Rays that annihilate
time and space, and which mankind is destined
to use in the near future ..." (Page 214,
"Unveiled Mysteries.")
Also, from his remarks on the platform, it seems that he
knew practically nothing about the "I AM" until Saint
Germain explained it to him for the first time in the "Dis
courses" over the "Light and Sound Ray" at his home in
Chicago in 1932.
Yet a year before this, while at the ranch in Wyoming, he
said of himself and party:
"Each one could clearly see his own 'Mighty I AM
Presence' smiling down upon him serenely."
("Magic Presence," Page 162.)
Also, when in Washington, D. C, before going to India,
he had spent three months of intensive training (so he says)
with Saint Germain, in actual physical study and contact.
(See Page 264, "Magic Presences.")

And then in India, you remember what wonderful things
happened to him. He even was given a "new body of im
mortal endurance" and his "inner sight and hearing were
forever cleared."
In the face of all these wonderful prior experiences it is
difficult to understand why he stresses the Chicago 1932
episode so much, unless it be that the entire group of
spiritual experiences began at that time. In other words,
Mr. and Mrs. Ballard, perhaps, went through some sort of
"psychical" experience at or following that time in their
home in Chicago, when certain information about the power
of the "I AM" came to them, either from a "Spirit" Being
whom they called "Saint Germain" or from other sources.
And the books were conceived or written following the Chi
cago episode.
Seemingly, the spiritual phenomena at Mr. Ballard's Chi
cago home so stimulated his mind and imaginative faculties
that he set about writing the first two books, and put in a lot
of fantastic experiences and erroneous dates which absolutely
do not check up with facts and reason. On Page 245 of
"Unveiled Mysteries" he mentions that there was a period
during which he and Mrs. Ballard "had not been together on
the physical plane for some two years." Therefore, he could
easily fill in the gap of two years with the experiences he tells
about.
The statement, however, on Page X of the Foreword of
"Unveiled Mysteries" would seemingly contradict this theory,
if true:
"This book is written in the embrace of the
majestic, towering presence of Mount Shasta."
( . . . that
is,
during August, September, and
October of 1930.)

However it may be, it is strange that having received these
teachings from Saint Germain in 1930 he did not publish
them until 1934. Why the delay in getting such an impor
tant message to the world? Certainly it could not have been
financial, if, as he said, he was promised by Saint Germain
unlimited assistance and financial support.

THE "PROOFS" OF TPiE BALLARD TEACHINGS
Mr. Ballard reiterated on the platform that "every word
in these books is true," yet he offered absolutely no proof
of it being so. The whole of it, with its inaccuracies and
transcendental experiences, must be taken on the word of
one man.
Where are the various personalities whom Mr. Ballard
mentions in his books? Why don't they come forward to help
him substantiate his claims?
Mr. and Mrs. Arthur Livingston and their daughter, Zara,
according to the books, are living in the United States. Why
don't they give their testimony about their association with
Saint Germain and Mr. Ballard?
Where is the President of the University mentioned on
Page 266 of the "Magic Presence," who was a member of the
Great White Brotherhood? It would be helpful to know
where his University is in America so that "I AM" students
might go there.
Gaylord, another member of the Brotherhood, has not
come forward to substantiate Mr. Ballard's claims. Neither
has Mr. Ballard's friend who took him to the Secret Valley
in Arizona.
And what has happened to Bob and Rex, Nada and Pearl?
They were due back years ago. Mr. Ballard sees them psychi
cally on the platform, but they are never present physically.
Where are the precipitated robes and the indestructible or
unbreakable dishes that were given by Saint Germain to
Mr. Ballard and to the other students?
Surely there should be some means of offering a little proof
to the world beside the written or spoken word.

WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THE THREE
GOLD MINES?
There was first of all the Rayborn Mine, of which Rayborn
said:
"We have had this mine for about twelve years
. . . We have taken out millions of dollars in
value." (Pages 44-45, "Magic Presence.")
Then Saint Germain indicated to Mr. Ballard where there
was:
"
. . . a deposit immensely richer, that has been
passed . . . contains over twenty million dol
lars in gold, clear and above all operating
expenses." (Page 40, "Magic Presence.") He
called this mine the "Master Discovery."
On Page 273 of the "Magic Presence" Saint Germain
speaks to Rex, Bob, and Mr. Ballard of a third wonderful
deposit:
"I wish to say, there is another great ore-body
not half a mile from the 'Master Discovery'
... As the claims are all patented and the
deeds in your hands, they will be safe, until
your return from the East in two years."
And he says on Page 281 regarding this mine:
"After your return from the Far East, it will be
opened up ..."
The above statement was made in July of 1932. Four
years have gone by, and there is no evidence that this wonder
ful store of gold has been "opened up." Mr. Ballard on the
platform insists that he does not own anything but his "per
sonal effects," and that the "I AM" lecture work is supported

by voluntary contributions and from sale of books. What
has happened to this immense store of gold?
Then where are the miners who knew of the location
of the first two mines, and had been sent there to mine them?
These miners knew of the strange disappearance of Rayborn,
the owner of one of them, and that of Bob Singleton the
superintendent; also of Rex the son. Would not all these
things cause comment and a rush of people to the mines in
Colorado?
But we hear nothing about these "gold strikes" out in the
worldâ€”only in Mr. Ballard's books and his statements.
WHY NOT ACTUAL PHOTOGRAPHS AND REC
ORDS OF THE ASCENDED MASTERS?
At their classes Mr. and Mrs. Ballard showed drawings
and sketches (taken from various sources) of the Ascended
Masters. Now, if permission had been given to show draw
ings, why not the actual photographs? It would have given
additional weight to the Ballards' claims of tangible and
physical contact with the Great Ones. But as usual, there is
no proof other than their statements, and this is no proof.
It is the same way with the Discourses given over the
"Light and Sound Ray." Why not an actual phonographic
reproduction of Saint Germain's voice? This would have
certainly been possible to do, for on Page XV in the Foreword
of the "I AM Discourses," speaking of Saint Germain, it says:
"The sound of His voice was physically audible
to everyone in the room."
So instead of the modern scientific way of recording sound
on a phonographic disc, Mrs. Ballard had laboriously to record

Saint Germain's discourses in longhand, necessitating him
spending from two and a-half to five hours with the Bal-
lards each time he came, according to Mr. Ballard's statement
made on the platform. What a prodigal spending of time by a
Perfected Being!
It would seem that an "Ascended Master" should have
more efficient ways of getting his message through to the
world. Mrs. Ballard, an un-Ascended being, records her
own discourses on a modern phonographic record, but the
"Ascended Master Saint Germain" is still "old fashioned," as
he says.
THE "ASCENDED LADY MASTER" NADA SPEAKS
TO A WASHINGTON AUDIENCE
On Pages 245-6 of the "Magic Presence" it is recorded
how the Ascended Lady Master Nada, "wearing a gown
glittering with jewels," both sang and talked to an entire
audience on Christmas Eve in Washington, D. C, when "the
great auditorium was packed to capacity."
Now, if it was permissible and possible for an Ascended
Master to do that for a mixed and unenlightened audience,
why was not the same thing done for the beautifully sym
pathetic and worshipful audience that greeted the Ballards
at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles and in other cities?
Surely, considering all the love and devotion that was poured
out to the Ballards, these audiences deserve as much as the
uninstructed audience in Washington. But as usual, these
"marvels" only occur in the Ballard books, with no more
evidence than their written or spoken word.

THE FICTIONAL NATURE OF MR. BALLARD'S
BOOKS
Mr. Ballard has given birth to an extravaganza of romantic
and transcendental literature, fantastically picturing the
ideal, with himself playing the part of the hero. The charac
ters he writes about are largely representative of Mr. Ballard
at various stages of development. They seemingly are drawn
from his own mundane experiences in life, and then embel
lished and exalted by imaginative fancy to the highest ideals
that he is capable of weaving. It is a psychological study,
which might interest the psycho-analyst.
For instance, Mr. Ballard's early life was spent on a ranch,
where it is said he raised hogs and cattle. Rayborn, his chief
hero, was also a rancher, and raised cattle for the market.
(Note the occurrence of "Ray" in both names, Godfre Ray
King and R<ryborn, showing the identity between the two
characters.)
Mr. Ballard said in the "Magic Presence" (Page 139) :
"I could not help but wonder several times, while
at the ranch, how it was possible for Rayborn
to be engaged in such a line of business."
Then Saint Germain sets his mind at rest by telling him of
the use of the Violet Consuming Flame in consuming such
human creation. Therefore, the hero, Rayborn, was able to
make his Ascension despite the killing of animals, just as
Mr. Ballard hopes to do despite his former activity, which in
his present enlightenment seems a terrible thing.
Mr. Ballard part of his life was a mining man, but poor.
Rayborn, his ideal, was also a mining man, but rich. He dis
covers an immense amount of gold, just as Mr. Ballard had
hoped he would all his life. He confessed on the platform

that he had always a "greed for money" up to the time of his
experiences with Saint Germain. Therefore, gold, jewels, and
Spanish coins play a dominant part in his two books.
Mr. Ballard by type is an idealist, living in a world that is
impregnated with realism. He earnestly desired youth,
beauty, and the transcendental things of life. Therefore, his
ideal characters are always young and beautiful, tall and
stately, and practically always with "violet-blue eyes" and
"flawing golden hair." His men are all "six feet one or two
inches in height" with perfect physiques. His villains are
"dark eyed" and of "dominating character." Ordinary
human love is exalted to union of "Twin Rays" or Twin
Souls. And so on. The fictional touch is unmistakable.
Mr. Ballard quotes long dissertations from Saint Germain
and the other Ascended Masters, which purport to be their
exact words. Of course, he could not have remembered
these long speeches, word for word; and they were taken
under conditions where he had little chance to take them down
in writing. If Saint Germain went over the manuscript with
him (as it is said he did) , then it is just as difficult to see how
an Ascended Master could have permitted so many errors of
dates and subject matter to creep in when: "an Ascended
Master makes no mistakes ... Is absolutely Infallible at all
times." (Pages 157-8, "Magic Presence.")
This phenomenal memory of Mr. Ballard again shows the
fictional character of his work. You know, it is easy to use
quotation marks in FICTION, but I wonder who can quote
the exact words of last Sunday's sermon, or, for that matter,
the last discourse of Saint Germain in the "Voice of the I
AM"? Would you dare give it out as an absolutely correct
transcription, and insist as Mr. Ballard does, that "every
word of it is true" and "there are no human concepts or
opinions" in it?

THE "PANTHER STORY" AND OTHER
INCONSISTENCIES
On Page 75 of "Unveiled Mysteries," it is recorded that a
panther guarded Mr. Ballard's body while he was away on a
soul flight. The panther was in reality no protection to the
body, for on Page 233 of the same book it is related how a
mountain lion killed the panther.
It is also recorded here that this same mountain lion sprang
at Mr. Ballard, and then it and the panther "locked in mortal
combat." Why did Mr. Ballard need the protection of the
panther? He was able a short time previously to prevent the
panther from killing him by looking it in the eye. Why was
lie not also able to tame the mountain lion in the same
way?
On Page 1 of "Unveiled Mysteries," Mr. Ballard mentions
that he had previously traveled in the Far East. He has never
to the writer's knowledge referred to these earlier travels.
Mr. Ballard describes in detail all about a retreat in the
mountains known as the Grand or Royal Teton, and yet he
tells nothing about the more generally known mt. shasta
retreat, although he was physically staying in the town at
the foot of the mountain, and dedicated his first book, among
others, to "the Brotherhood of Mount Shasta."
On Page 87 of the "Magic Presence" it is stated that while
at the Cave of Symbols near the Rayborn Ranch in Wyoming,
Saint Germain spoke "directly to Nada, Pearl, Rex, and Bob
Singleton." BUT, Bob was not there; he was left at the mine
in Colorado, five hundred miles away, as you will find stated
on Page 5 3 , where they said good-bye to him.
It is stated in the "Magic Presence" that Gaylord, a mem
ber of the Great White Brotherhood, had power to leave

his body consciously ; also to see through walls (see Pages 180
and 211). Yet he permitted himself to be kidnapped by two
men and one woman, and was taken to France without the
authorities on the boat or at the French port knowing any
thing about the kidnapping. And Mr. Ballard himself was on
this same boat, having followed the kidnappers from the New
York pier without a passport. (It seems that at a moment's
notice he and the others could get passage to foreign countries.
See Page 226, "Magic Presence.") And he did not intervene
until after the boat reached France, not even when the two
men left the stateroom, leaving only the woman to guard
Gaylord. Why didn't Gaylord himself escape at that time?
Why wasn't he able to see through the walls of his stateroom
into the adjoining one where Mr. Ballard was? Why should
a "member of the Great White Brotherhood" be so powerless
in the face of danger, more so than an ordinary human being?
On Page 3 58 of the "Magic Presence" it is related how the
boy, Rex, while in India, discovers a spy at one of the secret
meetings of the Great White Brotherhood where two hundred
members of that Great Order had assembled. It is absolutely
inconceivable that these great Masters would not know of
this spy and that it remained for a mere neophyte to discover
him and thus save the day for the Brotherhood.
We wonder why the two "rattlesnake stories" were
introduced in the second book, the "Magic Presence" â€” (See
Pages 55 and 176)
â€”"a work of the Great Ascended
Masters." We cannot imagine how the actual killing of
snakes has any occult or spiritual value.

THE GOOD IN THE BALLARD TEACHINGS
We come now to the positive and happier side of this
analysis.
It seems to me that the most helpful thing about the work
of Mr. and Mrs. Ballard is their insistence on complete har
mony in the thought and feeling worlds of their students.
Over and over again is this stressed. Harmony and happiness
in the home, office, and world. And it is noteworthy that
many people who have attended their classes have done much
to bring this about in their environment. It has helped them
to get hold of themselves, as perhaps no other teaching in
recent years has done for so many, and has given them an
incentive to work for their success in life through the power
of the "Magic Presence" within.
Other metaphysical schools, of course, have taught of
this same "Mighty I AM Presence." But the Ballards came
at a time when people were earnestly looking for a solution
to their financial problems and for a real understanding of
the meaning of life. Coming with magnetic personalities
and a showmanship which has hardly been equaled, they told
their audiences how they could obtain three inherently desir
able things:
1. OPULENCE, not necessarily by working
with hands and brains, but by decreeing it into
existence from the Universal Source of Supply.
2. POWER AND GLORY. Association
with Mighty Spiritual Beings to bring about great
changes upon the earth and the development of
marvelous powers of seership.
3. THE ASCENSION. Lastly, when the
life's course has been run, the absolute freedom

from the "Wheel of Birth and Rebirth" in this
very embodiment â€”and no Karmic Debts to pay.
I ask you, reader, what three things in life have more
motivating influence than these? Not only is one practically
promised his financial freedom, and raised to a higher social
level than all the honors of earth by association with the
Mighty Ones in the Retreats, but, when the course of life is
over, the certainty of permanent happiness in the "Golden
Etheric City" with no return ticket!
The surprising thing is that intelligent people who ordi
narily would analyze a business proposition presented to them,
will, without any investigation whatever, accept without
question everything that the Ballards have said or written.
The point is NOT that there is no Good in the Ballard
teachings. The Good is there. But without discrimination,
a good idea or principle may be used to wrong ends and
purposes. For instance, the idea of "The Ascension" is a
wonderful concept and an undoubted consummation of life's
victories on earth. But whether we should decree and demand
our Ascension NOWâ€”in this lifeâ€”before we are half-way
through with this School of Experience, is a very questionable
procedure. We should ask ourselves whether we are really
ready to graduate from this earth school; whether we have
complete mastery over our body, mind, and environment. If
we haven't, then there are still lessons for us to learn. At no
time in our evolutionary journey can we afford to dispense
with our "Discriminating Intelligence." It will save us many
griefs.
There is much that is worthy in Mr. Ballard's books and
in the Discourses of Saint Germain. It is unfortunate that
there are so many other things that are so questionable as to
their ultimate good. Many of the quotations and statements

are enlightening and inspiring. The poems and songs are
beautiful, and may be used just like any other inspirational
creations. Out of the strivings of the Soul, whatever the mis
takes of the human personality, may come the most transcen
dent wisdom. We should be able to approach any piece of
literature in this way, in an unbiased, tolerant attitude, and
extract the essence of Truth which it contains.
It is my earnest and sincere hope that this analysis will
help you do this. I send it forth with the prayer that it will
not undo any GOOD that these teachings have accomplished
and that it will tend to correct any evil that might come
through a blind and unquestioning adherence to what is
taught. And lastly, there goes forth from my heart and mind
a prayer to Mr. and Mrs. Ballard and their son Donald
that the Good they have done and the Harmony they have
brought to homes and families may grow and grow, and offset
any evils which might result from human errors and mis
understandings of Truth.

A TRIBUTE TO THE "I AM" CLASS LEADERS
AND STUDENTS
This commentary offers no criticism of the many faithful
"I AM" class leaders who have carried on so sincerely and
trustfully in the "I AM" work. Their implicit faith in the
source and truth of their information has been worthy of a
more sacred trust.
May they still carry the Torch of Truth to others and be
guided by their own inner sense of Reality to follow the
"Mighty Christ Presence Within," and never again,
blindly, unquestioningly, to follow any human personality
on the face of the earth.
And to the tens of thousands of faithful, conscientious
"I AM" students throughout the land who may for a time be
disheartened and disillusioned: Do not let your experience
dampen your ardor to know and experience Truth.
Truth is the most precious possession of mankind, and
therefore the most difficult to find. It is a precious metal that
is found not on the surface of things, but deep down in the
hearts of things. And for this reason the quest for Truth is
that much more intense and inspiring.
You will find a little of it every day, sometimes in the most
unexpected places. It does not occur in great flowing, glow
ing masses like the coke out of a great furnace. It would then
not be so valuable. But it resides deeply in all of God's crea
tion, in people, creatures, birds, and flowers â€”in the heart of
the Universe, and us.
Know, therefore, and feel, that there is still present in
God's great Cosmos â€”Truth, Righteousness, and Infinite
Goodness.

CONCLUSION
We come now to the close of this analysis of Mr. Ballard's
experiences. Much more could be brought out showing the
contradictory nature of most of them, but if there is still an
uncertainty in the minds of readers about their truth or
falsity, I am afraid no amount of evidence would prove it
for them.
I desire to differentiate sharply between Mr. Ballard's
experiences and his philosophical comments. I am frank in
saying that I believe Mr. Ballard "imagined" most of these
experiences. But one can hardly read his books without realiz
ing that there is much in them of a philosophical nature that
is quite fine. However, there is also much philosophy in them
that
is,
in my opinion, as fantastic as his experiences.
I
am getting together another brochure setting forth the
reasons why
I
believe this way.
It
will discuss such matters as
the Gas Belts, Catastrophes, the Wrong Use of Decrees,
the Dangers of Demanding Money, the Animal Creation
Question, the Violet Flame, the Ascension, Physical
Remedies, Comparison With Other "I AM" Teachings
and Occult Philosophies, Astrology, "Twin Rays," and
many additional matters which may be confusing.
Just because Mr. Ballard's experiences may have been only
in his "mind"
is
no reason to throw up the entire "I AM"
work, or to think that other individuals may not have authen
tic occult experiences. The great body
of
occult facts and
theories that have been presented to the world the past fifty
years or so,
is
not shaken because
of
the evident fallacy
of
some
of
the Ballard teachings. We should ever remember the
exhortation of Paul:
"Prove all things; hold fast that which
is
good."
