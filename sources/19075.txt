Thank You Vera one from Netherlands and
America UK
thank you for tuning in and we this was
almost 10 years in the making so happy
to finally be able to do this that Damir
thank you so much for being here it&#39;s a
pleasure you know let&#39;s take the beaker
and thank you all for participating and
supporting the project as you are in
Japan it&#39;s wonderful so this this is a
webinar we called it the founders
meeting because it&#39;s the first your
first seminar ever in Japan and Asia and
giving a new take on some very very
important material you are the founder
of the disc worldwide disclosure
movement and the c-5 initiative and also
the founder it means that we&#39;re
continuing to create things together
this time the new film c5 contact which
will be released later this year so this
is a workshop seminar and a crowdfunding
effort all rolled into one
great I know we&#39;ve had some amazing
developments with some third-party proof
that&#39;s been leaked regarding a person
about was in the unacknowledged movie
and also serious will tell Wilson do you
want to give us a quick just a quick
thumbnail about what happened with those
documents well Admiral Wilson is had
been the head of intelligence Joint
Chiefs of Staff for the u.s. Pentagon
which means he was the guy who did the
intelligence assessments for the Joint
Chiefs of Staff of America yes so in
1997 I did a stand-up briefing for the
Admiral at the Pentagon when I brought
also astronaut Edgar Mitchell for the
sixth man to walk on the moon Apollo 14
was on our team he&#39;s since passed away
and it was a briefing to provide this
critical information about UFOs to the
Admiral because he was being blocked
from finding out the truth even though
he was one of the most senior people in
the US military
there&#39;s recently been a release of some
comments from the Admiral talking to a
man named Eric Davis dr. Davis about
this meeting that has confirmed what we
have been saying for about 20 years and
that is that the fund acknowledged
special access projects usaps that are
in the United States are being run
criminally illegally and this document
that&#39;s just been released proves that
one of the points that was made in the
document which we have maintained for
many years is that there is a
clandestine or covert group that deals
with UFOs that&#39;s not just in America but
it&#39;s around the world that has been
running illegally without the oversight
the legal constitutional oversight of
key people in the government it is a
rogue and illegal operation it&#39;s also
important because he actually uses
Admiral Wilson uses the term
unacknowledged special access project in
these notes and that is the proper term
for projects that are not being
acknowledged a to key people in the
government who normally would know about
top secret operations I am a medical
doctor emergency and trauma doctor but
beginning in 1992 and 93
I began briefing very senior US
government officials including the
director of the CIA for Bill Clinton our
james Woolsey I&#39;m actually here in
Washington right now it&#39;s July 5th here
so we just had our July 4th Independence
Day celebration and what I have found
over working on this project for about
30 years is that most of the people that
you would think who should know about
these projects including the Japanese
Prime Minister the US president were
often not told the truth and so we have
set up excuse me an alternative way for
these leaders to get information through
the briefings we
do we just have the g20 here last week
in Osaka and of course you&#39;ve seen Trump
being asked about UFOs here and there in
the media this meeting and briefing was
in the 90s and you mentioned that
Woolsey had been positioned in next to
trump there&#39;s been a I know a few things
with that can you talk about how a
sitting president actually is really not
at the top of the food chain how
democracy has been compromised with this
issue a little bit sure so I have put a
briefing together for every US president
since Bill Clinton I have no official
capacity I&#39;m doing this as a service as
a civilian so when Donald Trump was
nominated by the Republicans in 2016 one
of his delegates to the Republican
National Convention asked me to put a
briefing together for candidate Trump in
August of 2019
I&#39;m sorry 2016 and it was given to him
in September of 2016
however within about 12 hours of this
briefing being provided to candidate
Trump the CIA director that I had
briefed for Clinton
Woolsey who had turned and betrayed what
we were doing for disclosure became the
national security adviser to then
candidate Donald Trump to ensure that he
would not do the right thing on this
issue the way this system works it&#39;s a
very corrupt and this is why disclosure
on this subject is unlikely to come from
the government&#39;s it&#39;s like it has to
come from the people we the people for
example recently President Trump has
called for the creation of a space force
so he has been manipulated into trying
to militarize the relationship between
humans and extraterrestrial intelligence
and of course this is a very big mistake
and very dangerous but this is what you
expect
people who are benefiting from war and
from very large military expenditures
yeah I don&#39;t know in Japan but in
America in the last year and a half
there have been many reports in the
media the New York Times Washington Post
CNN about military encounters with UFOs
however the big problem is that they are
spinning it they&#39;re trying to make it
seem like they are a threat that the
UFOs are a threat and we know they are
not and this is part of the
counterintelligence narrative to
manufacture a threat from space when
there is none most people would ask why
would they do this and the answer is
obvious is to maintain control over the
populace and to continue to expand the
military-industrial complex through a
weaponizing space most of the world has
called for banning weapons in space
including China and Russia I am Not sure
the policy of Japan however the United
States has not agreed to this because
covertly we know that they have already
put satellites in space that have very
powerful classified weapon systems on
them which is why it&#39;s so important to
do Close Encounters of the fifth kind
which is civilians like you and me
making direct contact with these et
civilizations it is too important a
matter to leave into the hands of
corrupt governments or people who have
other agendas besides peace
so the ce-5 film if you go to we have a
website ce-5 film comm we are in the
process of creating a new documentary to
follow unacknowledged that will get
people to become involved in making
direct contact with these civilizations
as ambassadors to the
universe but as civilians and it&#39;s
nongovernmental organizations we
actually had a little run-in on our
first night field during a fishbowl c5
contact training that occurred in
southern Arizona where what we had what
looked to be a flotilla and this brings
up several issues but just regarding
your comment about advanced weapon
systems you felt that they&#39;re very could
well be some other things within this
space X star link system that we saw do
you want to come in what that please
well we know that a lot of satellite
systems are dual purpose they are used
for one purpose that the public knows
about and then they have a covert
application we know for example there is
a man who has recently defected from the
Pentagon who&#39;s on my team who has told
us about these satellite systems he
worked for 10 years in the technology
management office TMO of the
sub-basement of the Pentagon
and he was read into or briefed on
satellite systems that can target any
object in space or on the earth and
obliterate it so this is why it is very
important the people of the planet Earth
need to understand we have to rise up
peacefully and make contact with these
civilizations directly because the
government&#39;s are either in a state of
inertia and ignorance or they are
involved in corrupt enterprises a lot of
these satellite systems utilize
electromagnetic weapons that are
so-called scalar or longitudinal and
these systems operate at multiples of
the speed of light
conventional speed of light for this
reason we are in need of millions of
people becoming aware of how to make
contact using ce-5 protocols and
establish a different relationship with
these visitors
from other star systems that is based in
peace and enlightenment beautiful and
that is such the revolutionary approach
that you&#39;ve connected the deep insider
information with this peaceful approach
to becoming an international and
interstellar race you know on earth I
think people find it so difficult to
connect the mass media they see everyday
and the the so-called regular world with
such covert operations and such black
ops and all this what seems to be
assigned email like science fiction in
many people&#39;s minds could you break down
your understanding of that term
counterintelligence yes it says
counterintelligence is basically one key
aspect is disinformation where false
information will be put out through the
mainstream media and some of it may be
true but there&#39;ll be a message that will
be false for example in America there
were recent encounters released by
people in the Pentagon between our jet
fighters and a UFO but they spun it in
the direction of it being a threat when
it wasn&#39;t it was just an innocent
encounter these use apps are
unacknowledged special access projects
also often will folks events they will
create something that looks like it&#39;s
alien but it isn&#39;t and this involves
things such as abductions mutilations
frightening scenarios that they have
been perfecting for the last 60 years
unfortunately I would estimate at least
90% of all the information out on the
internet and through the media on this
subject is in fact disinformation that
has been tailor-made to create a
narrative of fear or to hide the truth
on the subject exactly so the
intelligence is the natural witnessing
and the contact that&#39;s happening all
around the world and the counter is the
part that&#39;s trying to cover it up or
destroy it and you had an amazing essay
called DDT which might have I think it
was
this book right here is show contact
right oh yeah and that is one of the
that is unnecessary I always give to
people in the media or something that
work when we have the chance to and and
that again isn&#39;t it was written so long
ago but these themes you&#39;ve cut you&#39;ve
covered the foundations that will be
continued to be essential you know would
you men recapping what the DDT means I
think those are really three key
techniques in the field yeah I learned a
concept from the man who was the main
assistant to the director of the
National Security Agency and it stands
for you set up a decoy event that is a
distraction those are the D and D and
then they you trash the subject by how
you spin it
so it&#39;s called a DDT operation like the
poison insecticide bloom a pesticide yet
there&#39;s another way out of this and that
is the corruption that takes place in
the media I&#39;ll give you an example one
of our military witnesses who came
forward in the movie unacknowledged
confirmed that he used to carry bags of
cash to editors and senior people in the
media to alter stories about UFOs so
this gentleman agent Richard Doty was in
the Air Force Office of Special
Investigations and he admitted to not
only influencing and corrupting media
coverage but also that the
counterintelligence programs had hoaxed
abductions and other events that look
like alien events but they are not there
completely military man-made the reason
for this is that they want people to be
afraid of the extraterrestrials when
there&#39;s nothing to be afraid of and if
they are afraid they can be controlled
just like 9/11 we were so frightened in
America we went into Iraq which was a
very big mistake
they want to do the same thing with
space and with the ETS
I&#39;ll give you an immediate example of
this
the documentary unacknowledged which
forces on Netflix and other platforms
iTunes has been seen by around 300
million people around the world and yet
the mainstream media will not report
that it even exists it is on a blacklist
it is blacklisted there&#39;s a new wave of
counterintelligence we might say so the
topics you know the mutilations and the
the kind of x-files stuff from the 80s
and early 90s that we&#39;ve hit rock bottom
I think with those techniques and the
ideas behind them when we met in January
I was kind of inspired to to get a
comment about the actual vetting of the
whistleblowers so now the actual
whistleblower phenomenon itself has been
in kind of hijacked and we won&#39;t go into
any specifics but we know through the
UFO subculture and sort of your lone
wolf whistleblower and why that&#39;s
dangerous and and why how how is the
disclosure project when it&#39;s several
hundred witnesses a whole different
ballgame from that kind of posing well
with several distinctions first I have
over 950 top secret whistleblowers who
provided us information and before I put
anything out to the public from an
individual they have to have their
credentials sent to me and verified of
proving they were in the military or the
CIA etc where they were proof of their
employment etc moreover if it&#39;s some
extraordinary information that I have
not heard from another source we do not
disclose it until I have had multiple
other people who are very credible
corroborate the information the other
part of this is that even if you take
something like the UFOs that have been
seen at intercontinental ballistic
missile facilities nuclear missile
facilities you&#39;ll find that we have put
people together who
that story other people will come
forward take those same information and
say it was a threat to our national
security when the men who were there
have told me they felt that the ETS were
saying please don&#39;t blow up this
beautiful planet in a nuclear holocaust
so the point is you can take the same
set of facts let&#39;s say Minot North
Dakota in the 80s when in UFOs took 18
ICBMs intercontinental ballistic
missiles offline and rendered them
unlaunchable the people who were
actually there felt that the ETS were
trying to warn us not to blow up the
planet in a nuclear war
those same witnesses have been taken by
charlatans in the UFO community you know
crackpots and they&#39;ve been presenting
them as proofs that were being attacked
by aliens
so you can take the same set of facts
and spin it in a different way in fact I
have to tell you that in 1993 in
preparation for briefing the CIA
director for Bill Clinton the man who
set that meeting up for me sent me a
letter warning that anything we would do
to bring this forward would be hijacked
by people with their own agendas and in
fact it that did happen and it continues
to happen as recently as the last few
months with these military cases that
have been on the mainstream media but
they&#39;re being presented by people like
Chris melon and Lois Elizondo these are
operatives from inside the government as
a proof of our national security threat
which is ridiculous because these
civilizations are no threat to us they
view humans who are still worrying like
savages as a threat I think this is you
know I I founded the global disclosure
movement what people don&#39;t realize is
that before that was known by the public
we had something called Project
starlight
which was a code name for a briefing
process that I initiated to brief senior
people in the military and the White
House and other governments the United
Nations about this issue to try to get
them to do disclosure but they wouldn&#39;t
do it and so we did it to give you an
idea how corrupt powerful the group is
it wants to keep this secret I was in
1992 May of 1992 was offered by the head
of army intelligence and some of his
people personally to me personally to
billion would be billion US dollars to
be quiet and not do what we&#39;ve been
doing I of course refused it but they
after I refused it then they began to
threaten me and to defame me and to
assassinate my character which of course
goes on to this day but I tell people
that the powerful interests that want to
keeps a secret are by far the most
powerful group in the world so you know
I&#39;ve gone through a look over 30 years
of at the very highest levels of
governments around the world what I have
concluded is that this whole matter
rests in the hands of We the People
where it should and that if the people
do nothing they&#39;re going to be very
disappointed with what&#39;s going to happen
in the next few years and it&#39;s time for
the people to organize in an effort not
only to move forward disclosure and to
bring forward the technologies that are
running the UFOs so we can get off of
oil and gas and coal but also to develop
a relationship with these civilizations
that&#39;s peaceful because I do not see
that that is right now happening in the
government&#39;s speaking of those getting
over those technologies we don&#39;t even
have to reinvent them because you know
we have they&#39;ve been proven to be in
existence even with something like the
ARV one of the questions we&#39;ve gotten
from viewers regarding the man-made UFOs
um do you think do you want to cover
what that is briefly and then there
any countries in your opinion that
besides the US that have those ready to
go so first of all everyone needs to
realize that gravity control let&#39;s say
being able to control mass so the people
call it anti-gravity that was mastered
in October of 1954 the senior scientists
at the naval research labs here in
Washington which is the largest
Department of Defense lab in the United
States was in a vault and saw the
documents that establish this fact and
this means that there have been manmade
UFOs let&#39;s call them since the 50s
forward these are very classified
aircraft they have been used in
clandestine operations and we know that
a consortium of companies involving the
Lockheed Martin skunk works and SAIC
science applications international
corporation Booz Allen Hamilton or AJ ng
Raytheon and others have been working on
these for more than 60 years and I know
this transnational
effort has them stationed all over the
world but um so I think the question
that came in was was there other
countries besides the u.s. in possession
of them first of all forget about
countries the way you and I talked about
it so the group we were dealing with
here is not just us but is transnational
not international I will describe this
in a moment this is a very secret group
that transcends normal geopolitical
boundaries but they have covert
counterparts in various countries that
work with this committee called the
majority intelligence committee or magic
maj I see so there are assets in Japan
South Korea China Russia Great Britain
France Australia and other countries
are connected to this group but I would
say the center of gravity the center of
power is is certainly in the United
States I&#39;ve met with a number of these
members of this committee in the US and
elsewhere and what I have found is that
it operates in a way that is outside the
normal governmental channels and in
these unacknowledged special access
projects thank you and that ties
beautifully into my next point was what
is the the next part of this is the the
UFO button those craft stationed all
over what was the UFO button well in the
1990s I learned of a covert plan to
basically stage using these man-made
UFOs an attack that would look like it&#39;s
aliens I have many people that I have
met with who had been involved in the
planning and operations for that false
flag as it&#39;s called Operation dating
back to the 60s and 70s for example one
man who is on an interagency committee
in 1974 was at the briefings we did for
Congress here in the United States that
I put on that I invited astronaut Edgar
Mitchell to in 1997 and this man was on
a committee that had fully operational
in 1974 the ability to hit a button and
they would launch a what would look like
an alien attack or a hostile alien event
that would be a hundred percent covert
military operation this gentleman was
actually twist away out of the hotel in
Georgetown the night before the
congressman joined us for this briefing
that was a closed private briefing
because his handlers were desperate for
him not
to share this story with members of
Congress you know could this was of
course he had been involved in 1974
that&#39;s 45 years ago but he told me the
assets and the technologies to hoax a
threat from outer space had in fact been
developed long before he was there in
1974 and what this means is were very
vulnerable to an event happening that
would fool almost everyone on earth that
it was alien when in fact it is not this
is actually a key reason why I continue
to do high-level briefings here in
Washington and elsewhere because most of
the people in government do not know of
these capabilities and they would be
completely tricked into thinking it was
alien when in fact it&#39;s a covert human
operation so but that timeline is
actually kind of speeding up to right
one of the other elements is that we&#39;re
seeing this programming and what do you
think about the intensification in the
last few years as well that&#39;s also in
direct response to the film&#39;s if you
look at what has been happening in the
media in the last year and a half it&#39;s
quite clear that they are increasing the
pace of this fake disclosure when I say
fake disclosure I mean it&#39;s the
disclosure that would use real evidence
but they would then spin it in the
direction of a threat and they will
eventually begin to release events that
they will claim were violent events from
aliens when in fact the
counterintelligence community haven&#39;t
have hoax them for example I mean if you
look at unacknowledged the film you&#39;ll
see where Bernhard von Braun who
invented the rocket tradeoff Hitler on
his deathbed warned of this and said
that they would in fact it in the future
hoax an alien threat and that it&#39;s all a
lie and he said that in the 70s prior to
his death to Carol rosin who is on my
team
thank you the tricky thing is that when
we see these reports them out there also
it&#39;s you know people are interested in
the topic and they&#39;re using they&#39;re
manipulating our interests as well so of
course yes we should be neutral or
skeptical at first is that right when we
see when we see a report that comes out
on CNN Yahoo Japan BBC all they&#39;ve got
that top-line access that normally means
that it&#39;s cabal or that&#39;s disinformation
what I would say right yeah well
obviously if it&#39;s in the mainstream
media its most likely to be something
that it&#39;s part information and part
disinformation so I liken this to a
poison pill that you put a sugar coating
on the outside so it tastes very nice
and then people take it and inside the
pill is this poisonous narrative of
there being a threat from outer space
and this is what we&#39;re seeing happening
right now exactly that and one of the
antidotes to that is raising
consciousness through contact I would
say well that&#39;s what you&#39;ve given when a
major solution is to see if I&#39;m a
contact work well they&#39;re two anecdotes
one is we have the alternative media
like the internet and YouTube we have a
YouTube channel that&#39;s had tens of
millions of people see items on it
youtube.com slash s disclosure and what
I have found with these documentaries
like unacknowledged is that we can reach
hundreds of millions of people that way
so we have to find and continue to find
ways to reach the public without going
through the big news media and
mainstream media that are going to
sanitize a message if it&#39;s based around
peace so this is where the word of mouth
from person to person is very important
we have put all the evidence together we
need people to help to build the network
that is bigger than the mainstream media
to get the truth out the number the
second thing is we can make direct
contact
so everyone can go out with a few people
doesn&#39;t have to be a large number and go
and make contact because and we&#39;ll talk
about this in the second half is that
the power of mass consciousness working
together and change the whole direction
of the future excellent how would you
like see if I was been in existence for
well over 20 years now in Annecy City as
a si city as an MPO how has the content
itself devolved how have events in the
field and and during the workshops
changed over the years if at all well I
think the kind of contact we&#39;ve had has
been very personal and amazing for 30
years I founded C city in 1990 so next
year will be 30 years but what is new is
that there are tens of thousands of
people around the world doing it now
which causes a shift in consciousness
but also there are new et civilizations
being brought in and introduced to us at
these expeditions where we&#39;re having
completely new civilizations that have
never been introduced to humans yet
being introduced to humans through these
contact expeditions were doing and that
is something that has evolved in the
last five years or so very remarkably
the other thing that is quite remarkable
are the new technologies and digital
cameras where we are getting et
phenomenon documented that 10 or 20
years ago would have been impossible for
example we had an Oracle Arizona a
couple of years ago a man who had very
severe hearing loss who had the wear
hearing aids and an e key flashed into
the circle and it looked like a red ruby
red teardrop oval shaped object but in
the digital lens you could see this et
that had a triangular shaped head
standing beside the man
who had been healed of his hearing loss
and he&#39;s permanently been healed and we
have a photograph of this ET it will be
in the ce-5 film additional story it is
amazing yeah so we have had events like
that before but now we have cameras that
can actually capture the et standing
beside the man and that is something
which is amazing and beautiful and I
think when millions of people see this
new film they&#39;re going to realize the
potential we have to make contact and
without the government doing it for us
one of the points in the PR for this
event was about Oracle and I just want
to know when we I&#39;d like to ask you
about the film in a second but yeah I
just wanted to say that that every night
the work was just so mind-blowing and
and I was deeply moved and so much
energy work happening and that spot
itself is a really powerful sacred site
and and we had all sorts of beings and
groups from all different kinds of
timelines coming in and out of there do
you want to do this comment really
briefly about this last time in Oracle
about what you felt was a pertinent well
first I want to point out that any place
where you go into deep pure
consciousness become sacred so in deep
meditation that is the great purifier
and it is brings its own sacredness when
you are in deep meditation for in
universal consciousness it but this past
time in an Oracle I have been on these
for 30 years and what I was remember it
was remarkable to me were the number of
ET craft that surrounded the field where
we were that would pop in and out of
this dimension but that numerous people
would see shimmering out in the field
around us and they would appear and then
D materialize and disappear mainly
because there were a lot military jets
and what have you going over and to
understand this
you have to understand the nature of an
interstellar civilization and by
definition they go beyond the speed of
light and if they go beyond the speed of
light they are crossing through other
dimensions as they go from one star
system or galaxy to earth so an actual
ET spacecraft can be fully materialized
partially materialized or not seen at
all because it is resonating around you
in another dimension I remember the one
ship with him we had so many mil crap
aircraft in the area circling and there
was that one night I think it was the
third night perhaps then and we knew and
I perhaps had we&#39;re just talking and a
back and forth there and I was sharing
something or vice versa and on you had
this night vision and all of a sudden
this gigantic craft kind of zapped the
entire area with this protective energy
right we&#39;ve had this happen many times
where an ET object comes in and the way
you know it is entered is a blinding
flash in all directions and we actually
have some of these on videotape and the
craft is moving into this dimension and
stepping down from trans dimensional
space-time into 3d and they may just
create a huge energetic burst all around
us and sometimes a light that comes
straight into the circle there we had 30
people in our circle this past time
thank you
yes yeah it was so powerful I just
continues to resonate dr. Greer one
other thing would you mind going over
the topics of the film like you did in
the workshop and then you see if I film
one of the chapters that you&#39;ve
described to us please yes sure there&#39;s
a there&#39;s a good description at ce-5
film.com but we have a we&#39;re wanting to
focus on three major areas one is the
science of consciousness how the
conscious mind and thought can interface
with an electronic device
such as an ET communication device but
also the science on that we have from
Princeton University and other
universities where people have done
experiments with random number
generators and thought where it&#39;s
affected so one key area is going to be
an expose of the science of
consciousness and how the mind and
consciousness isn&#39;t limited by space or
time
and the XK so the others which we&#39;ll get
into unpacking each of these but the
other is dealing with the contact that
people all over the world have had and
what is the evidence what&#39;s the CD 5
evidence and experiences people from all
over the world have had so that it will
be one part of the film as well
including all these photos and videos of
the encounters we&#39;ve had and then
another section will be about what I
call behind the alien mask so there&#39;s a
caricature of the aliens and just
visualize the alien face that&#39;s the
caricature you see and it being a
masking you pull it off and there&#39;s an
old man there&#39;s an old man at the CIA
and Pentagon pulling strings to hoax
things so part of is going to be an
expose of why people are afraid and why
they should not be afraid so I think
this part of it is very important
because people will not go out under the
stars to make contact if they believe
they&#39;re going to be harmed so we have to
expose the big lie
that there&#39;s a threat from these
civilizations because we know there is
not a threat and the public however
won&#39;t go out to do contact themselves if
they were afraid so we need to have
something in the film that explains why
they should not be afraid and how
counterintelligence has hoaxed and
created all the fear there is on this
subject it&#39;s the culmination of a lot of
work and there&#39;s there must be so many
amazing clips that have been hundreds
there are hundreds of amazing photos
videos and things that we will only have
to a few it&#39;s a two-hour film so you
know the other part of this film that I
didn&#39;t mention which is sort of like the
narrative thread that ties it all
together is sort of my own personal
story of how you know how a medical
doctor like myself got involved at this
level and what happened to me when I was
a young
when I was 18 and I had contact with
these ETS and created these ce-5
techniques based in higher consciousness
so that will be a big part of the film
as well just so people understand the
origins of the ce-5 techniques it date
back to 1973 this is in the Japan
version of the hidden truth forbidden
knowledge all now cool yeah all that was
detailed in this book yeah just showing
that for that so this was the first book
that was in Japanese for a long time and
then finally serious came out but yeah
so if anyone hasn&#39;t read hidden truth
yet that&#39;s the you know Ground Zero for
sure well yes it&#39;s it&#39;s more of a
personal story yeah the truth is going
to be more mind-blowing than any science
fiction film anyone&#39;s ever seen
with consciousness and make contact
through these techniques and there&#39;s a
saying in medicine where you&#39;re being
trained as a doctor see one do one teach
one it means the first time you see
someone do it the second time you&#39;re
actually doing it yourself and then the
third time you&#39;re teaching someone else
to do it so that&#39;s the model for ce-5 is
if people learn it from somebody or app
they then do it and then they try to
teach other people to do it but it&#39;s
very not centralized it&#39;s all very
grassroots and this is really important
because they&#39;ve done studies with people
doing remote viewing which is when you
use consciousness to see a remote place
with your intuitive mind or with a
random number generator like at
Princeton where they would have a
machine that would generate zeros and
ones and just people would come in and
put their mind towards it intending it
to be more ones and it was shift to be
more ones and zeros statistically
significant and they found that people
who do these techniques with
consciousness who are just ordinary
people off the street or actually often
as good or better than people who hold
themselves up to be so good at it and I
have a philosophy that everyone because
we are humans like the 80s and are
conscious and awake sentient we all have
this ability within us it&#39;s all a
natural state for everyone so it&#39;s very
important is that everyone can learn to
sit quietly and meditate and as they
practice it they become better just like
any other skill but everyone has that
ability locked within them it isn&#39;t as
if somebody can do it another cannot so
I always tell people it&#39;s a incorrect -
when when people try to arrogate to
themselves or say I
better than you are at this or that I
think everyone has this ability it&#39;s a
better it&#39;s about developing the skill
obviously anything that you develop the
skill that you have to practice
including meditation and remote viewing
and doing ce-5 but everyone has that
ability within them and they should view
themselves as being fully capable of
doing all of these techniques you&#39;ve
proposed an amazing middle way dr. Greer
which is halfway between the extreme of
fear and the fear factor and then on the
other end idolatry and making EE T&#39;s
into some sort of gods so they the
direct experiences online right between
those two I think is what I&#39;ve gathered
from your materials and then our
experience this year and then finally
the training last in May it&#39;s very
important people understand that these
civilizations are very developed both
spiritually and materially however they
certainly do not want to be worshipped
or be viewed as gods of some type they
also don&#39;t want to be demonized or
feared so yes it&#39;s a it&#39;s a balance of
it&#39;s an enlightened balance of
understanding that there&#39;s one universe
and one people and that at the deep
level of the conscious mind or is a
singularity and we are that singularity
all of us humans and ETS and yeah in the
training materials there&#39;s a you know
guidelines for the contact work it&#39;s I
think one of the key words that comes
out as almost counterintuitive it&#39;s very
simple but a lot of times we run into so
many human error components we&#39;re
getting a little deep right now into the
applications of it but there&#39;s a couple
pages in the training materials that
describe the qualities of a working
group leader or a ideal working group
leader and those are you know something
those are extremely high you know this
connects into like a higher morality to
wouldn&#39;t you say
that&#39;s why I mean I think you ought to
get into the human politics I mean look
humans are always gonna try to make a
ridiculous political ego trip out of
everything what I&#39;ve tried to do is put
the information out that I know is true
and hope people act wisely with it I by
sort of abhor human political and
organizational strife so I find it
counterproductive and unnecessary and
you look at humans you know someone in
Japan leaves very different in many
respects culturally than someone from
Italy or the Congo in Africa however
we&#39;re all conscious and awake sentient
beings so this is true if you expand
that paradigm on a cosmic infinite level
it&#39;s true with humans and
extraterrestrial civilizations there&#39;s
gonna be a lot of diversity and a lot of
differences but we are all conscious and
intelligent and that consciousness is
itself been proven scientifically to be
a singularity there&#39;s actually only one
conscious mind in the cosmos radiating
within each person so I think what we
need to really go into here is what is
the foundation for contact and both in
terms of the philosophy but also
operationally the key thing is
understanding the nature of
consciousness or the nature of the mind
because after we get all of these free
energy technologies and anti-gravity
technologies out that should have been
out for 60 years or more and the big
science of the next thousand years or
more
is going to be the science of
consciousness you see all 80
civilizations that are interstellar have
communication technologies that
interface directly with coherent thought
clear intended thought they interface
with
their technologies as easily as our cell
phones are interfacing with a cell phone
tower using radio waves this is really a
key point and that is if we&#39;re just
thinking about communicating with these
civilizations using technologies we have
in 2019 but we&#39;re you we&#39;re contacting
civilizations that are 100,000 or a
million or maybe a billion years more
developed than we are we&#39;re going to be
completely lost so we have to understand
the sciences that evolve when you become
interstellar that are consciousness
based and thought based technologies and
when you understand the nature of your
own self your own conscious being you
realize that even though we&#39;re very
different we&#39;re really all one at the
same time and unfortunately humans
confuse equality with sameness we don&#39;t
have to be the same but we can be equal
spiritually people are very different
humans are very different from some of
these eg civilizations however there is
a go I call it the golden thread that
weaves all of us together and all of
life together is this deep understanding
and experience of consciousness that is
beyond ourselves and beyond space and
time which is that silent state within
ourselves and deep meditation
keep in mind when an interstellar
vehicle is going beyond the speed of
light and it is resonantly beyond the
speed of matter space and time electrons
etc it&#39;s traversing increasingly
conscious based dimensions because of
this the spacecraft included as well as
everyone onboard the spacecraft are
connected into a deeper aspect of
reality that is increasingly
consciousness based as opposed to
material however they have the ability
to go from being a solid material object
to these other energetic forms that are
increasingly like our for lack of a
better word our astral body or our body
of light that we experience in a lucid
dream or in a near-death experience so
all the technologies that an
interstellar civilization has ranges
from material technologies anti-gravity
into these other dimensions that include
the world of consciousness and the
worlds of so called astral light that
are beyond the speed of conventional
light and this is where people get very
confused with some extraterrestrial
phenomenon and things from we call
metaphysical or things from another
dimension
purely and we&#39;re getting into some deep
issues here but it&#39;s very important for
people to understand that eg
civilizations have the ability to be
both physical and material but then as
they resonantly go beyond the speed of
light they&#39;re crossing through these
other dimensions
that is where people get so confused and
my questions here are referring the
enormous amount of pre-programming and
front-loading and UFO mythology even on
the positive development so what about
the these fifties and sixties period of
contact that said that kind of is very
physical and the craft lands I meet to
get salad you shake your hand how does
that differ or contrast to what what
we&#39;re talking about with the
interdimensional stuff well certainly
that can happen we have had for example
we were a Joshua Tree National Park and
we had a craft fully materialized about
15 feet above us and fully 3d material
very close encounter we have had et
genes in their bodies appear right near
our groups and have been touched by them
actually so that can certainly happen
but you could have to understand that it
ranges from that experience to the more
common experience is that these
civilizations because of security
concerns from our military are gonna
stay in a more transcendent form a more
transdimensional form which means we
have to be educated on all of it you
know if that&#39;s really the experience the
non experience versus experience and
then those those issues start to get
cleared up as you have actual experience
of your own yes well I want to clarify
it it&#39;s in reality it&#39;s all on a
spectrum of reality in other words it&#39;s
it&#39;s everyone wants to put hard lines
between material and transdimensional
and spiritual in reality that&#39;s not how
the universe operates it&#39;s not even how
we operate
but our intellect and our Western
orientation is to chop everything into
pieces that isn&#39;t how the cosmos is
constructed so to be more specific
actually every single human is a
conscious quantum holograph
and has the entire cosmos and the
entirety of creation unfolded within
them within the structure of their own
being and their own consciousness which
it it&#39;s deep level is infinite so if you
understand the reality of your own self
you can certainly understand the reality
of these other civilizations and the
differences are actually quite trivial
at this level of enlightened
consciousness and spirituality is not
only the foundation for peace on earth
but peace throughout the cosmos and is
the number one thing that people should
be developing an understanding of and an
experience of and that is that deep
meditative state and the understanding
that the conscious mind that allows
everyone to be awake right now who&#39;s
hearing my voice that conscious mind we
think of it as being ours or his or
someone else&#39;s it&#39;s actually a
singularity is a singularity the mind
itself is a single infinite field of
awareness it&#39;s beautiful to share
something we just had a six point nine
earthquake outside of LA as we were
doing this women are just about ten
minutes ago and I got a message a
question Kalev about that but yeah
that&#39;s speaking of the global field as I
was saying I felt this big energy shift
just about ten minutes ago it looks like
we just had a huge earthquake in Central
Southern California basically Ridge
Bookfest ridge crest is where the one
happened a couple days ago which is in
there China Lakes Naval facility or
weapons lab this is the singularity and
your comments are I&#39;m you know keeping
focused on the goal is sort of best and
so connecting and that&#39;s what connected
to these higher ETS is so hard for us at
times well actually that&#39;s why it
shouldn&#39;t be hard because this the
simplest thing is for people to sit
quietly and do nothing and be awake and
then become aware of the
awareness and before I was a doctor I
was a meditation teacher and so what I
found is people just need to have an
understanding of the nature of mind and
then techniques to experience that state
of mind and practice it and then the ETS
are very very interested in people
experiencing that state Bible I&#39;ve loved
it in this high vibration here we&#39;re
gonna go into the next topic we&#39;re
covering a lot of different bases here
um I have a slide that I show in a
lecture that covers the some of the core
reasons for the cover-up and thumbnails
that and then you were obviously
instrumental in and revealing the energy
component but we could say if there was
four core elements of society been
opposed the disclosure one would be the
military aspect military-industrial
complex to a medical element and
advanced medical technology and healing
technologies and then third would be the
obviously the energy sector and the
petrodollar for being the one that came
out and hit in truth that I don&#39;t think
if this if your books were not
self-published that this this wouldn&#39;t
have been able to be published was the
whole astrological element and the
religious component and especially
modern quote unquote cult religions
including Mormon Church what what is
this Couture eschatology and how does it
relate to the UFO issue well first of
all I don&#39;t think the medical part of it
is is that critical I think the
macroeconomic and banking financial
aspect of the secrecy is much more
important than any medical the medical
would be a sideshow so keep in mind that
the reserve currency of the world is the
petro dollar if you bring out these
technologies
you don&#39;t need petrol we don&#39;t need oil
so it is a very large macroeconomic
chain change that this sort of banking
empires would not want to see happen so
that that is much more critical and I
think more
even in the military or intelligence
community as for religion per se I have
no problem with the foundations or the
origins of any religion it&#39;s what men
have done to them to corrupt them that&#39;s
the problem
as the philosopher George Santayana said
fanaticism consists of redoubling your
effort when you&#39;ve forgotten your goal
but for example in America you have
about 25% of the population who thinks
the world is six to ten thousand years
old and that humans grow dinosaurs like
horses a few thousand years ago this is
of course stupidity and I&#39;m embarrassed
to admit that many people in America
would have such crazy ideas but that&#39;s
one of the problems with religion is
that people who are completely
unenlightened spread ridiculous ideas
that make a mockery of the teachings of
Christ or any other enlightened being so
I think that the problem isn&#39;t the
origins of religion it&#39;s what ignorant
men have done to them so specifically
there are fanatics and a number of
religions that are always obsessed with
how the world&#39;s going to end and what
they don&#39;t understand it&#39;s not the end
of the world it&#39;s the end of one era of
human development and the opening of
another so we are at the closing of one
era and the opening of another right now
it&#39;s a five hundred thousand year cycle
that is opening and about a four hundred
and fifty thousand year cycle closing so
we&#39;re in the middle of this 1 million
year transition point and I think that
many of the religious fanatics that are
involved in the secrecy around UFOs
wants to present it as a sort of
Armageddon situation because they want
their prophecies to come true about the
end of the world it&#39;s it&#39;s actually
quite
disturbing and bizarre to any rational
person but unfortunately they have their
own agendas in in 1994 I had a meeting
with the Crown Prince of Liechtenstein
Prince hans-adam von Lichtenstein where
he explained to me the reason he and
others had worth funding the abduction
abduction groups in the United States
and elsewhere was so that the public
would hate the aliens enough to go to an
interplanetary war so that the end of
the world would happen so that Christ
would return so when he told me this I
was you know gobsmacked I mean just I
could not believe it but this I found is
a very common fanatical view within some
of these secret cults one of the reasons
to et&#39;s remain usually behind the scene
is that they&#39;re waiting for enough
humans to become peaceful and
enlightened to justify more open contact
which is I&#39;ve calculated we need about
1% of the world population doing what
we&#39;re doing which would be around 75
million people so in Japan you have 120
million people you would only need 1.2
million people to be aware of these
issues and be in a state of meditation
and contact and it would shift the
entire country so and it does this if
you look at the studies in consciousness
and quantum physics when you have about
1 percent of the population who begin to
do something very positive it
automatically shifts the other 99
percent it&#39;s it&#39;s the fact that you know
this weight is so enormous that even
when we have our positive experience
they&#39;re trying to at times when you try
and tell I shared that with others they
think you&#39;ve had a religious experience
or or you&#39;re getting and you&#39;re stepping
on their religious toes you know
regarding um like the earth changes the
question came in just in response to the
earthquake in California and obviously
we&#39;re shaking all the time here and
Japan is up the meaning of the four
major tectonic plates of the earth do
you have any comments with you know your
connections with Gaia or I know in
you&#39;ve had visions of the different
timelines of the future how do you feel
about this changing of one era there are
going to be shifts that might be
physical - right well there&#39;s a
wonderful saying attributed to Asia that
said those unless we change directions
were likely to end up where we&#39;re going
so people need to understand we&#39;re about
a hundred years past the time when we
should have had world peace and also
free energy and no pollution and no
poverty so if we continue on the path
were on then things are only going to
get worse so I left my medical career as
an emergency doctor because I viewed the
state of the world is in a greater
emergency than even what I saw in the
emergency room and this includes the
earth which is a conscious living being
and our civilization so it&#39;s very
important that we understand that a
peaceful disclosure that we&#39;re not alone
in the universe and bringing out these
technologies but also most importantly
people in consciousness making contact
is in small groups with these ETS is
something that is critical for now and
also you&#39;re going to see in the future
it&#39;s going to be very critical because
if we continue to have global
instability geo physically climate etc
it could get to a situation that is so
bad that these et civilizations will
need to have people in each community
here on earth to be cooperatively
working with them
so certainly in Japan there should be
very conscious and dedicated cd5 contact
teams in every community perhaps when
this next film is out we could do a
premiere in Japan love to have you in
2020 along with the Olympics - yes great
year to come if it&#39;s ok I&#39;d like to
share a couple of these videos we have
on standby
it&#39;s sort of like we&#39;ve almost tasted
the future here and this is not this is
simply to inform not to alarm but the
you know Japanese coherence level how
everyone is so they learn group group
behavior and and their their societies
intrinsically less egocentric and more
of a group mind in both positive and
negative ways the fact it seems like
someone&#39;s afraid of them waking up too
fast because the global impact it would
have so we&#39;ve experienced just enormous
unbelievable interference especially on
the mass media level where this topic
was in the graveyard that was completely
being active when we started jasonandrhe
then have gone up to seeing very direct
checkpoints and counter counter activity
related to the especially releasing your
information so one of those things is a
brand new topic with these very advanced
drones so I&#39;m going to share the screen
now and we have an amazing video here
donated by a person in Okinawa right
next to I believe it was the Kadena Air
Force Base and here&#39;s a picture of their
base and their view from there they&#39;re
right up against the base I know that&#39;s
Okinawa here the Hawaii of Japan here&#39;s
the ocean right here and then they gave
us this amazing video of what looks to
be some sort of light display in
maneuvers here we go
so there&#39;s a string of Lights it&#39;s
almost it&#39;s not in the V but it&#39;s in a
curve here in the center of the screen
there&#39;s a helicopter right here and
dealing the event right above the base
and then all of a sudden the second line
starts to appear above them and so they
immediately they say it&#39;s a UFO so so
you&#39;ll see this again a second string of
lines appearing very mechanically when
you start to see the ET craft
you notice the difference in the
luminosity and the quality of light and
it&#39;s just this demonstration
they&#39;re testing these craft I believe
and why this video is so special is
because no one in the media so here and
there in our research we&#39;ve seen these
objects and one of the clips we got was
also from Thailand and you&#39;ve seen these
they they look like they almost
ironically look like a sea City logo
where they have these three globes you
can see it can you see the screen here
they have the string of balls connected
by some sort of wire and they&#39;ve used
these technologies to deep-six rc5
efforts here with sort of inactive x sky
watchers and and sort of people who the
media have used who are in the bullpen
and then in many times they&#39;ll use them
to to kind of what like maybe call could
call cannonballing and blow out our the
real left rather out of the water I&#39;d
like to hear your response and also
there&#39;s that document that you mentioned
in with a using analyst amateur
astronomers and sky watchers to kind of
spread the gospel as it said and this is
a sort of another layer and that same
old theme you know with new tools new
toys well this has been going on the
document you&#39;re referring to dates from
1950s
and we know that counterintelligence has
hoaxed events in order to divert people
like a DDT
from actual et events or to confuse the
picture just make people very confused
so you have to be very educated on all
of these subjects to go out and do what
we&#39;re doing so you can tell the
difference between something that is
being staged by humans versus something
that&#39;s actually extraterrestrial one of
the key things to keep in mind is the
actual ET craft and beings are able to
interface with coherent thought meaning
very directed clear thought from an
expanded state of consciousness and will
interact with it and this is very
distinct from just some machine that may
be up in the sky that may or may not be
VT it could very well be human so keep
in mind that an extraterrestrial object
and the contact we do is very
interactive with the thought and
conscious field because that is the main
way that they are communicating across
distances where the speed of light is
too slow and I&#39;ll just Rivlin just real
quickly how the StarLink look at oracle
there that was luckily we had the charts
on hand because that that would have you
know it was fully for the first I can
bear um well yeah but we had a meaty
craft cross over at first and that&#39;s
what kind of singer hears the craft
coming across suddenly here&#39;s the line a
string of pearls what I thought was a
flotilla could you see that with the
naked eye dr. rear yes yeah
no could you I know a singer but about I
need kilos together which I get the kind
of souvenir I eat Chuck send me he don&#39;t
hate the mascara okay she could be that
tonight yeah I was happy that we confirm
that but it was disappointing because
that looked like the mothership about to
land well we are we I knew the week
before Elon Musk SpaceX
had released 60 satellites off of one
rocket and they were in a formation and
it&#39;s very important for this reason that
you go out with a app on your iPad or
phone that shows all the satellites that
are up in the sky so you don&#39;t get
confused by this sort of phenomenon
these things are not always coincidences
that that happened on the first night of
a cv5 like that&#39;s the level that you&#39;re
that you&#39;re operating in this this work
is threatening them well this is exactly
why it&#39;s very important that everyone
listening understand how important the
ce-5 film.com is right now we need to
have millions of people who create a
shift in consciousness a morphogenetic
field shift that moves our civilization
forward and quite frankly I&#39;m never
doing anything without the intelligence
community tracking my every movement and
what I&#39;m doing and where I am so for
unfortunately for myself I don&#39;t have
the freedom of anonymity which millions
of people doing this on their own can
have and so I think it&#39;s very important
that people do this and at this point my
life you read between the lines of what
I&#39;ve been doing there&#39;s certainly no way
I&#39;m gonna go anywhere and do anything
without it being monitored it&#39;s very
important also that people understand
that when a group of people get together
to do this and they are centered in this
conscious space that is very deep and
universal it&#39;s like a magnet that
attracts the ETS to you because they
want to connect with awake enlighten
people not violent and let&#39;s say
ignorant people so this is a really key
thing it&#39;s not only an operating system
for remote viewing in contact
it&#39;s also what the ETS are looking for
within us as people who are ready for
contact I always point out to people
that what we were all doing is very
important but I am NOT important and I
tell people the story of being very poor
growing up in the south of the United
States and when I had this contact
experience when I was 18 the ETS didn&#39;t
care that I was poor and from a very
poor impoverished family in the south
they cared that I understood
consciousness and that I was doing it
and and was in a state of deep
consciousness and that they knew I could
relate to them from in a universal way
so that&#39;s what they&#39;re looking for they
don&#39;t care if you&#39;re rich or poor a
medical doctor or a mechanic they care
about that your state of consciousness
and what&#39;s in your intention in your
heart
thank you and tomorrow is a global c5 so
you well today we&#39;ve all gathered and
this is a another great foundational
step towards the next wave of this film
and what&#39;s going to come after it next
year and how could you describe what the
global sea se5 fum is yes what we&#39;ve
been doing this for a few years where we
pick one day a month it&#39;s usually the
first Saturday of each month and
everyone is linked up globally doing
ce-5 and hopefully in the future when
millions of people see this next film
will have millions of people doing it
because it creates a force of change
that&#39;s very powerful all over the world
and an fact throughout the cosmos when
people are doing things together in a
positive way so once a month we have a
night where we encourage people to go
out with their team
two or three or four or five people
doesn&#39;t matter and do the ce-5 contact
and even though you may not know that
there are thousands of other people
doing it they are and it creates this
huge force in consciousness for change
in a very positive way
just a circle back on the earth element
one of the I&#39;m in the question we
received from a viewer regards the
philosophy of leaving Earth and I just
watched a show hosted by Will Smith the
National Geographic series on Netflix
somewhere he and the astronauts were
going on and on about how we&#39;re going to
leave Earth and colonize Mars and we
need a backup backup civilization all
this stuff the effort to ditch Gaia as a
closing question how do you feel about
that well I think it&#39;s you know very
important for people to understand that
these civilizations are not interested
in humans going out into space very far
at all until we become civilized at
least a level one civilization as it&#39;s
called a Michio Kaku where we are not
fighting we are in balance with nature
we are not destroying our biosphere so
the entry ticket to being able to do
what these folks are talking about is
that we become marginally minimally
civilized right now we&#39;re not a
civilization at all where we&#39;re living
in a state of complete chaos and we have
not established a peaceful planet we
have not established a sustainable
environmentally sustainable planet
that&#39;s the we have to do that before we
will be welcomed to go traversing far
away out into space I think also it&#39;s
important to realize that the ETS are
not here to do this for us they are here
to assist in a secondary way they&#39;re
here to observe
but the children of Earth have to take
the lead and fixing the mess we&#39;ve made
on this planet excellent okay great
thank you
well we&#39;re nearing the top of the hour
here any closing remarks dr. Greer so I
think and what I&#39;d like to say in
closing is I really appreciate you and
everyone in Japan who are working on
