    This is a three-part experience involving an STE and two NDEs. Two of the three experiences were remitted many years ago under my pre-married name, and are recorded as STE 6511 & SOBE 6510 (Shared Below). The third experience has not been previously submitted.        

It has been nearly 20 years since my first out-of-body experience; I have since decoded the purpose behind these interventions. This account details includes the context of life in which the events occurred. It took these three successive lessons for me to finally choose to be my greatest self. Life has been as steady rise into bliss ever since.        

This excerpt is from my book Be Your Greatest Self: The Guidebook to Enlightenment and Realizing the Legendary Life.        

When spirit leaves the body        

This experience, which lasted for months, occurred when my wife of ten years admitted engaging in multiple affairs and stated that she was now pregnant by another man. I had three young children and was not prepared for the life changes this entailed. She expressed distress, as she did not know how to proceed, but her actions up to and after that point showed me that our relationship had ended.        

While we were talking about her being pregnant, I found my consciousness floating above my body, to the right and slightly above my shoulder. This experience of floating was not a sensation. There was no 'feeling' of floating, only the fact that I was. I felt empathy and overwhelming compassion for the despair I saw in my physical self, but the pain evident within that body was not felt by this aspect of me.        

I was within the room, but I wasn't confined to my body; it was as though I was everywhere and anywhere within the room all at once. For a few moments, I oriented myself with this new freedom, moving about the room and observing the environment from various angles. I remember darting below the dresser to where no body would fit, knowing I would be able to see from that perspective and loving the effortlessness by which I moved. Out of body exploration was short lived though, because my attention was needed.        

My conscious self started coaching my physical self on how to get through what was going on. I observed my ‘self’ crying, and instructed my ‘self’ to drop my chin lower 'so the anguish would be more apparent.' I could see that my physical self was suffering immensely, but my conscious self was experiencing no pain. In fact, I felt very empowered and elated, as my consciousness filled the room and I could observe everything within it from all angles. I knew my task was to coach my physical self through this experience.        

I remember questioning the reason behind showing my emotional pain. I had the inclination that sharing those feelings would be hurtful to my wife; and besides, the aspect in control was elated and feeling quite wonderful outside of the suffering body. It was immediately within me that I needed to facilitate my wife’s journey by bringing awareness to the effects of her choices. My responsibility was beyond question, an obligation, and so I did not hide what my worldly self was feeling.        

My physical self was operating like a puppet. Everything I told that self to do, it did. When the conversation had ended, I told my physical self it was time to leave and reflected on whether 'it' could drive. I watched until I was certain it could manage the trip, compassionately observing as it drove the twenty minutes to town.        

My conscious self was rarely in the vehicle during the trip. Instead, it floated above, witnessing each turn and feeling comfortable that my physical self would make it to the city. I recall thinking the words 'you will be fine' as I floated above the vehicle. My thoughts still guided my physical self, but I was aware it could cease to function. I would best describe the body as a reflection of self and the spirit as the conscious self. It was as though the reflection could navigate pattern, while unquestioningly accepting thought-based instruction. While in attendance, the spiritual, conscious self was fully in charge.        

Floating above my moving vehicle was an empowering sensation. Moving was effortless; I simply thought myself to be where I wished to be and there I was. I felt no motion or touch sensations of any kind. As I followed the vehicle, I could see objects on both sides of the road as though I were in a low-flying plane. My van appeared to be about the size of a quarter, so you can imagine what my peripheral vision was like. The odd thing was that I saw objects that I had never seen before, set way back from the side roads. The view was complete and accurate to every minute detail, even though I never had been down those roads. After the experience, I drove down those side roads and examined a map, witnessing in awe what I had seen from above.        

When I arrived in town, I went to my workplace. I don't remember much of what took place there, save one girl who provided counseling. It was not her role, but she did it for me as a friend and it helped a lot. I recall while she spoke with me, that I was flitting in and out of my physical self. I could feel the emotional distress within my body and could not bear to return to it completely at that time.        

I remember being out-of-body as both the most empowering and most devastating experience of my life. I remember the awe I felt in realizing that my physical self was only a husk through which I experienced life; that it wasn't 'me.' At the same time, I could feel neither the pain of that body, nor the joy. I would hug my children but not feel the love which I so desperately wanted to feel. This went on for months, where my conscious self was only marginally attached to my physical body.        

I recall reflecting on the irritation and frustration I felt because I could not become 'whole' within my body again. I estimate that it was more than nine months before I could experience a genuine emotion as a whole self. It was years before I fully returned to my body to experience life as one being. Until that time, I spent much of my worldly existence as a marginally attached spirit. I want to be clear, however, that this spirit was fully me and fully whole in itself.        

It was difficult being outside of the body for an extended period. Initially, I felt bliss, awe, and amazement for the revelations one has while out-of-body. Great understanding came over me, for I knew that the self exists apart from the physical; however, I neither moved on to the afterlife nor back to the physical life. Instead, I found myself remaining in stasis as an observer guiding a puppet. I did not see God or any spiritual beings, perhaps because I really wasn't seeking to.        

I felt as though I had a duty to see my physical body through this traumatic experience. At many times the pain was too much for the body and it would break down in a convulsive display of tears and agony. My spiritual self would feel compassion for that other self, comforting and caring for the emotional needs of the body, and providing understanding and reassurance. When the body was not tormented, my spiritual self would busy itself on logic puzzles, and sometimes it would travel from room to room exploring the environment in more depth than was possible while working. That too was very liberating, and I learned a lot about my workplace that surprised me.        

My spiritual self attempted to rejoin the physical several times. The pain of this world was beyond what it could handle, and on more than one occasion, the attempt at rejoining my body resulted in suicidal contemplation. I envisioned my death many times, picked the method and place, and then fear brought me bawling to a doctor who found me help.        

Note that the spiritual self isn't accustomed to experiencing the pain we go through in life. It tends to feel much more compassion and love. It cannot process the pain humans can experience or inflict upon others.        

Of possession and dragons        

The enlightened experience of the spirit is very apparent in that account, but for greater understanding, we need more.        

For many years, I was blessed by memories of only my spiritual journey; there was no memory of the earthly body. There were two distinct sets of experiences. There was a physical self living on earth, and a spiritual self of perfect freedom that lived elated but was unbound. This part is critical; it was just as life is for so many, wherein the spirit and body are not one.        

It wasn't until many years later, after writing my 2009 account, that my spirit and body became fully unified and memories of body were reinstated. It is only now as a whole being that I can detail the account of both aspects of self.        

The torment of earthly pain was too much for the body to endure, and it would break down into fits of agony. This means it had feelings, even if my spiritual self didn't experience them. There was honorable behavior; it was engrained, or autonomous. I remember many times hearing of how my body's choices were aligned. Absent the spirit's guidance, the body simply operated from memory and unconscious action. On earth it didn't appear different from regular life, for the body was the same and the actions so starkly similar that evidence of spiritual departure was scarce. Agony of the body continued and my spiritual self, which I would term my authentic self, remained as a loving guide. I was supporting and encouraging when needed, and adventurous when not.        

It is very apparent that there were two experiences. At the time of divergence between spirit and body, alignment between the two was strong. The body was at the gates of hell, the spirit was blissful and in heaven, and both were experiences were genuine. The choices of both were aligned.        

The tearing apart of earthly life took time and so the pain of body endured. Spirit and body did not unify in that discord. Spirit used free will to remain separated. It still loved, but it distanced itself from the pain, a pain it would equate to as hell. In other words, the spirit ‘I am’ never entered into hell. The body went about its routine absent spirit. Recall that spirit is love, and so the body was absent of love.        

The body was living a loveless life, heart-broken. Holding my children and feeling an empty heart was entirely devastating. No matter how hard I tried to love, all I could muster was the physical expression therein, no feeling. As this went on, the body went through further fits of agony, honoring all and being true, but not recovering. This continued and some poor choices were made, such as distancing myself, which only brought more grief.        

Eventually, after a couple years of agony, something cracked. It was as though the body accepted being in hell. The true demon came out at that time. It hurt those I love and became self-serving; desperate for love, it would do anything just to feel the least bit of warmth. It manipulated and dominated, desperate to hold onto any tiny speck of love. It wasn't human and it controlled the body.        

That is what is meant by the term possession. To be possessed by evil is to be willing to do anything, anything at all, in hopes of finding light. My spirit was not attending. When desperation became possession, the light of life was absent.        

That is where many dragons come from my friend. They come from beings so lost and desperate for light that they lose their humanity, their decency, their love. Dragons are borne of the emptiness.        

Do you feel compassion for that being, so desperate and destroyed? Can you see how successive torment brought him to that choice? That being was me, or at least an aspect of me. The choice to hurt others in hopes of my salvation threw open the gates of hell and I strode confidently in. The spirit was not present; it does not reside in hell. It was experiencing an alternate life in heaven, awaiting its chance to return in loving kindness.        

The second intervention        

Through all my poor choices, I was still loved unconditionally. But we can only feel that which we make real within ourselves. And so, despite the great intensity with which I am loved, the experience was devoid. Eventually, it became apparent that I wasn't progressing and so there was a second intervention.        

I was pulling out of a side street onto a four-lane road. The traffic was stopped. A driver indicated he would let me cross his lane, unaware that there was a cube van coming down the lane next to his. As soon as I entered that lane, I was broadsided by the van. My driver's side window was down, so I did not hit my head on it during the impact.        

When I looked up and saw the van barreling toward me, I realized that there was nowhere for the driver to go other than through me. I remember thinking I'd be hit and might die, but I wasn't afraid. I was upset because my children were at the beach and would be in need of a ride home. I was concerned for them, not for me.        

When the vehicles collided, time stopped. I felt exceptionally alert, and recognized right away that I was not in my body. I was still inside the vehicle, above and to the right of my form. It felt perfectly normal to be in this state, as real, or perhaps more real than when I'd been inside my body.        

Now, having time stop when you are in an accident proves to be a very interesting experience! The first thing I did was view what was going on within the vehicle. Every shard of glass from the broken windows was suspended in the air; not falling. I was caught up in the beauty of the moment, admiring how each shard was refracting the sunlight differently. They looked no different from other shards of glass from a wreck, but these were all alive with light, shimmering in the air. I could perceive every shard in its entirety.        

My spirit moved darted the suspended shards, admiring them for a few moments, and then turned to the 'task at hand.' This body (to which I felt no emotional attachment) had just been in an accident, and I wasn't sure it was still inhabitable. I know that sounds odd, but that was my question; was this body still intact - could I still 'use' it? My consciousness positioned itself in front of the body to examine it, to scan it from top to bottom: no damage.        

I was pleased because I needed to pick up my children. I knew they would be confused if it was time for them to leave and I wasn't there. When I realized I would need time to arrange alternate transportation, there was an instant 'blip' of urgency to return to the body and I was immediately inside it again.        

The part of this that amazes me is that everything I described in the previous paragraphs happened during the instant that I was hit. There was no passage of time; all of what I experienced had simply happened in that instant.        

The driver of the cube van was certain he had killed me. He ran over and I greeted him in a more or less jovial way, so that he would not be concerned. I told him I was not injured. Though my mind was still in shock and I hadn't fully checked for injuries, I was certain there was no damage because I'd checked during that moment of suspended time. Police and medics arrived and I assured them I was fine. For whatever reason, they did not attempt to check me for internal injuries and I was able to retrieve my children from their swim.        

A realignment of character        

My second intervention was a powerful turning point. I'd not changed my beliefs and I was still living old destructive patterns of my past. But faced with the threat of my death, I realized that my true love wasn't just for me, it was for my children and all others. It was for the glass shards, so alive and shimmering in splendour. It was for all of life, without exception, and it was for me. Life, from that point, had to be lived true to All That Is.        

I remember a question I was asked when time stopped. I was told I could leave earth if I wished, and that I'd be known as a victim of an unfortunate accident, or I could stay and be there for those I loved. I immediately felt intense compassion toward all three of my children. I had to be there for them. I loved them as I love life itself. It was at this time that I realized I'd need to arrange alternate transportation, the small flit occurred, and I was back.        

It is impossible to recognize true love until one has invested in developing their heart, for it is through development on this level that we shift from desiring others as our means of fulfillment, to loving them irrespective of what they do for us. It is when we reach that higher level, loving others as they are and not because of ourselves, that we love unconditionally. Our mental images lose their hue and present us with the accurate picture that forms the foundation for true love. This is knowing the heart, and it results in us understanding how we can accept everyone, flaws and all. It took this accident to show me the love that lived within, for me to be restored to wholeness. It was through this event that I realized how much I loved my children and that I'd have to reform my life.        

At this point, I was able to love anyone in the world except myself. I was burdened by the guilt of past choices, unable to change them and unwilling to forgive myself. My memories had not been restored; my spirit and body were not yet fully integrated. I was however, aware of what had happened, at least categorically. I remember moving into my past and being horrified by what I found. That's when grief set in; it was shortly afterward that I started to experience debilitating pain in my chest.        

I saw several doctors, but none were able to determine the cause of the problem. Multiple times a day, I would be doubled over in agony, expecting a death that would not come. I prayed. I called out to God and spoke from the depths of my heart that I would 'die a thousand deaths if it would undo the pain I'd caused.'        

For three years I had the attacks, and about three times a day I would be doubled over in more pain than any being can endure. I'd cry and ask God to take care of my children, each time knowing this day was my last. I'd pray for them, not for me. They were my life, my treasure, my everything. Eventually, when the pains did not end, I said a new prayer. I said 'I empty my vessel of all I have known to be me. Take it as your own, God. Do with me what you will.'        

My attacks continued, but only for a few more days. In the midst of a most debilitating attack, something changed. The intensity didn't lessen, but the pain vanished. I was out of body again.        

My body moved, but not of my accord. Form rose, walked to my mother's house a block away, rang her doorbell and collapsed on her step. She answered the door and it was all I could do to look pleadingly upward and cry in agony 'please mom, help me.' She maintained composure, called into the house that she was taking me to the hospital, and did so.        

To be or not to be        

My out-of-body experience continued. The attacks were spaced only minutes apart as she drove. I would double over or clench right up, scarcely able to breathe. The intensity was beyond worldly measure and the body was steeped in pain, but I experienced none. It was then that I realized I was looking toward my mother’s form and my own from a central position on the windshield.        

My mother kept me speaking, inquiring as to how I was doing. My body would respond automatically with its own words, or with the words of my spirit if my non-physical self chose to provide a response; the body rested between attacks. I remember a choice that crept into my soul; you have a beautiful life ahead. You can leave if you wish; heart attacks will be the cause of your death. Or you can stay. Come, let me show you what is to be.        

I was shown pictures of the highest of mountaintops as viewed from the alpine. I saw myself hiking behind a small female form dressed in green snow pants, or in shorts and a black cut-off top. I saw adventure beyond the finest of dreams and felt love wider than the vastest sky. I was shown children, and grandchildren, and a beautiful lady practicing Zen with me atop a mountain. I didn't know her at the time, but it was she who would become my wife. I was shown that this wasn't the first time this future had been revealed; it was the reason I continued my journey after reaching hell's door and contemplating suicide. I was totally enamoured by the life that was foretold; those feelings were my choice to stay.        

I received an operation. They removed my gallbladder and three gallstones, one as large as a ping-pong ball. I recall waking and thinking in peace that the pain is gone and hearing a voice 'It is done.' I realized my vow. I'd promised to die a thousand deaths if it would undo the pain I'd caused, and indeed I had. Three years, three times a day, I died. My honor was restored, my vessel emptied, and there was peace.        

Finding oneness        

Each of our histories contain vast experiences that cross the gamut from intense pain and suffering to supreme happiness and bliss. Within that history are events we appreciate and others we are not prepared to accept. These unacceptable events are often damaging and usually in contrast to our ethics, values, morals, and core beliefs. Healing comes through understanding and acceptance, but how do we move past these points of pain? How do we accept that which is not acceptable?        

First, let us understand something about self. As an aligned being, you are not your past deeds, nor are you the person of the past to which you may relate, the person to whom your memories seem to belong. You are the soul who was purified and has come out the other side. A memory which conflicts with your inner being does so precisely because it does not fit who you are.        

Life is a journey through experiences by which we come to know ourselves. We make mistakes and grow through them. We come to know who we are by being who we are and who we are not, realizing our genuine nature through success and error. The pasts we know were a means of growth and learning; if we recognize our mistakes and would not repeat them, we have healed our misalignment.        

Some pain is not our doing; it is instead inflicted upon us. To understand how such transgression fits into the world, let us look at the dynamic of life in cooperation. We live in concert with a vast number of others who choose and live autonomously as we do. Each of us makes decisions which impact others. Sometimes, our choices involve a cost borne by another. At other times, there are costs imposed upon us by the choices of another. We may suffer for the want of another just as others may suffer our wants. Likewise, we may benefit others and others may benefit us even when it seems unwarranted. To live in concert means that we all affect each other. There is no difference between the pain we experience helping another grow and the pain we have inflicted while on our path to becoming.        

It is through contrast and introspection that beings grow, both us and others. All of life is contrast. We know the writing on a page for the contrast, for if it were white writing on a white page, we could not read it. There is no pure sound, instead there are sound waves. There is sound silence, and it is the contrast or intensity and frequency of this vibration that we detect. We know touch because when we touch, sensation replaces voidness. It is so for all senses, but there are other forms of contrast by which we also grow.        

The combination of our sensory experience is what we constitute as life, and we take it personally. This creates contrast, for there is how things are and how we wish them to be. We can accept what is and respect the contrast, even if we do not like it. We move past a challenge by not personalizing it, or into a challenge by personalizing and exploring it as an opportunity to realize who and how we are.        

The most intense contrast involves emotion and often proves difficult to grow through. When we have pain in our past, inflicted upon or by us, know that it is personal. We have chosen to make it personal and so we relate to it and suffer. But take a moment to consider this pain; what is the contrast for which we punish ourselves? Does punishment serve anyone and for what reason do we submit to suffering?        

Too often we forget who we are; the voice of reason in your head is you. The moral upstanding being who is your internal compass, this is you. Divinity is you and you are beautiful. Your past contains events that are not beautiful, but the being who knows this and lives in accordance with learned values and goodness, that person is beautiful indeed. In knowing this we can see that the contrast in our lives, while not always personally acceptable, can be accepted. It is as it is; we cannot judge the path; we can only accept and be better for it.        

If you explore your past or the past I've shared thus far, you will see that there was no point in which judgement spurred healing. It was always faith, love, and joy that led to the recovery of spirit. This is where compassion comes in. When we look at times we've healed and times we've spurred healing, we can see that compassion and love restore the soul.        

This is why your journey through healing is delightful, loving, and entertaining. It is why our lessons focus on the joys of becoming. It is why every tool I reveal is of empowerment, and it is why I entrust you with my journey. All I do, I do to serve; I am living my purpose. You will likewise live your purpose. But first, you must reveal and be your greatest self.        

You are but two chapters from realizing your final skills and defeating your dragons. I hope you’re getting excited. You should be. The answers to being your greatest self, living the legendary life, and unshakable faith live now in you!

Date NDE Occurred:        May 2001    

NDE Elements:        

At the time of your experience, was there an associated life-threatening event?        Yes  Accident         Life threatening event, but not clinical death    The first experience was a STE involving intense emotional duress and a high risk of suicide.    The second was an NDE wherein a cube van broadsided my car. The vehicle was written off but I was unscathed.    The third incident was a medical concern. In my NDE, I was given the choice to pass on, in which case my cause of death would be cardiac arrest, or to continue. I chose to continue and was diagnosed with gallbladder attacks.    

How do you consider the content of your experience?        Entirely pleasant    

Did you feel separated from your body?      Yes  I saw the shape of a river that flowed behind my home. I looked it up online afterwards and confirmed that it matched what I'd seen from above.    I visited a white house while out of body. It had white painted siding, while the garage next to it had wider white siding. There were unique decorative windows, and a rope swing hung from an oak tree in the front yard, despite the fact that oaks don't natively grow in that part of the world. The driveway was in need of new gravel, and there was nobody home. I remember that my spirit was intrigued by the home but that I wouldn't dream of entering because it was someone's private space. I drove to this home after the experience, and it was EXACTLY as envisioned, right down to the brown rope supporting the unpainted wooden swing.    My spirit traveled to the programmer's room where I worked, a place I'd never seen in form. I saw the layout of the desks, where each programmer sat, and even a prescription bottle on one desk. I asked a friend about the bottle and he confirmed it. He then took me into the room and it was exactly as I'd seen in spirit.    I clearly left my body and existed outside it    

How did your highest level of consciousness and alertness during the experience compare to your normal everyday consciousness and alertness?        More consciousness and alertness than normal   Imagine the most glorious love and freedom you can fathom, and accept that nothing you can know with mind will ever be as vibrant as the actual reality. What I experienced cannot be processed by mind. No concept can even approximate this level of completeness.    

At what time during the experience were you at your highest level of consciousness and alertness?         From the moment spirit separated from form, until the time it reintegrated, I realized a level of aware alertness to which all of life pales in comparison. All time out of body was this heightened aliveness.    

Were your thoughts speeded up?         Incredibly fast    

Did time seem to speed up or slow down?         Everything seemed to be happening at once; or time stopped or lost all meaning    When I was tending to body and there was no emergency situation, time flowed normally. When I needed time during the collision with the cube van, time stopped. It seems that time was malleable in accordance to the situation.    

Were your senses More vivid than usual?         Incredibly more vivid    

Please compare your vision during the experience to your everyday vision that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.       I could see in all directions at once, including up and down. It wasn't like earthly vision, where one thing is focal and everything else is periphery. Everything was clear and awareness was where I focused my attention. It was like being aware of All That Is, as opposed to looking from a third-party perspective.    

Please compare your hearing during the experience to your everyday hearing that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.      I think in sound, so noise can be a considerable distraction for me. Out of body, my capacity was so increased that I could process the many streams of audio without effort.    There were times when I would have expected to hear sound and did not. For example, I heard and felt no wind when I was above the vehicle, despite moving at highway speeds. I now realize that the me that was above the van was non-physical; it had no form and thus did not cause wind resistance.    

Did you seem to be aware of things going on elsewhere, as if by ESP?       Yes, and the facts have been checked out    

Did you pass into or through a tunnel?         No        

Did you see any beings in your experience?         I sensed their presence    

Did you encounter or become aware of any deceased (or alive) beings?         No        

Did you see, or feel surrounded by, a brilliant light?         No    

Did you see an unearthly light?         No      

Did you seem to enter some other, unearthly world?         No        

What emotions did you feel during the experience?         Intense elation, belonging, acceptance, and Happiness.    

Did you have a feeling of peace or pleasantness?         Incredible peace or pleasantness    

Did you have a feeling of joy?         Incredible joy    

Did you feel a sense of harmony or unity with the universe?       I felt united or one with the world    

Did you suddenly seem to understand everything?         Everything about the universe     I'd always been a very curious person, but not when I was out of body. Anything I wondered came to me; it was as though I could call upon the wisdom of All That Is and instantly receive my answers. They weren't in me, but they weren't separate either. In the absence of uncertainty, I became a free explorer. Life was about realizing and embracing appreciation for All That Is.    

Did scenes from your past come back to you?         No     I was told that my life to the point of my first out of body experience had been lived honorably, with alignment. This was an important affirmation. It revealed that how we live on earth does matter, that we are to be aligned as right beings.    

Did scenes from the future come to you?         Scenes from my personal future     I met my current wife in my out of body visions where my future was revealed. This initially happened 16 years before we met in person, and it happened again in another NDE 6 years before we met.    When I was an out of body explorer, I traveled to glorious alpine meadows, immense waterfalls, and astounding peaks. I have since been to dozens of these places in person. This is the legendary life I remained for, and I am living it.    The future that was shown to me was only partially revealed. Often times now, I see a few unique but uneventful clues that a profound moment is coming, and will comment to my wife that we are approaching a special time. I know the feeling the time will involve, but not the event. As one example, we were on the highway traveling to a hike (which is common) and I told her this one was different... that something important was about to happen. Two hours later we were on the mountainside with a blown tire and we worked together to fix it. This was a bonding time; it was our first unanticipated challenge where we learned how we both deal with stress.    

Did you come to a border or point of no return?         No      

God, Spiritual and Religion:        

What was your religion prior to your experience?      Unaffiliated- Atheist   I considered notions of God to be sheer foolishness.    

Have your religious practices changed since your experience?         Yes     God is All That Is, and there is nothing that is not God. This means that I live within a church, and how magnificent it is. I don't need to go to a building to express my love for All That Is. I need to be in nature, embracing the splendor that is God. It's where my heart comes alive. It's where I find connection.    

What is your religion now?         Other faiths- New age   God is All That Is; there is nothing that is not God. This was given to me during my STE and NDE experiences. This has formed the essence of my faith, an understanding God has built upon through countless lessons and communications.    

Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was entirely not consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience     I lived 100% in the physical, and rejected spiritual notions with fervor. I remember hearing about people who had been out of body and thinking they were quite delusional... playing with a partial deck. Imagine my shock when I realized they were right, and that I was the one that was delusional! To a scientific mind, spiritual adventures seem impossible, but to one who has experienced them there can be no other truth.    

Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         Yes     I have learned what it is to love All That Is with the entirety of heart and mind. I have for God, the love God expressed toward me.    

Did you seem to encounter a mystical being or presence, or hear an unidentifiable voice?         I encountered a definite being, or a voice clearly of mystical or unearthly origin   I did not see a being, but was in communication. I was shown what my future would hold if I chose to stay. God revealed my current wife years before we physically knew of each other. I was given the choice to live or pass on in each of my three experiences, and chose to remain.    

Did you see deceased or religious spirits?         I sensed their presence    

Did you encounter or become aware of any beings who previously lived on earth who are described by name in religions (for example: Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, etc.)?         No      

During your experience, did you gain information about premortal existence?         Yes     Separated from body in the vehicle accident, I examined my form from head to toe and was pleased to see it was undamaged, that I could still use it. This indicates life outside of body. I was very aware of the fact that I'm not my form. I create form by means of all I embrace and do, and then experience life through my creation.    

During your experience, did you gain information about universal connection or oneness?         Yes     I was one with All That Is. Information I sought arrived automatically.    

During your experience, did you gain information about the existence of God?         Yes     It was given to me directly that God is All That Is, and there is nothing that is not God.    

Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:        

During your experience, did you gain special knowledge or information about your purpose?      Yes   In a recent intervention, it was revealed to me that I am to share how God healed my life, so that others may likewise be healed.    

During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?         Yes     We are here to be our greatest selves. Over our years, we move ever more expansively into love. Virtue and right being are core to divinity, and we are divine beings. Being our greatest selves means aligning with the divine nature of All That Is, our source and that which sustains us.    

During your experience, did you gain information about an afterlife?         An afterlife definitely exists     Yes     I was before time and will be after it. This can be said likewise of you. We are all an aspect of All That Is, essential and immortal. Form may fall away, but the essence of being remains.    

Did you gain information about how to live our lives?         Yes     A legendary life awaits all who align as their greatest self.    

During your experience, did you gain information about life's difficulties, challenges and hardships?         Yes     When my wife of ten years admitted she was pregnant, I felt I should cushion the blow I'd been dealt by not showing my full emotion. It was immediately within me that I had to share my anguish so she could learn from her choice and grow. Were I to deny her the understanding of how her choices had affected me, I would have prevented her evolution. Right behavior in this case meant recognizing my role and providing her feedback so she could align.    

During your experience, did you gain information about love?         Yes     Love as God loves, unconditionally.    

What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         Large changes in my life     Before my experiences, I was trying to make my way in the world. I sought to prove my worth... to earn the house, car, have a spouse, and children. I wanted the dream so many of us were told to believe in as children.    After my experiences, my sole objective is to be my greatest self and live true to the one who lives in me. I endeavor every day to be the living embodiment of virtue, to love unconditionally, and to teach others how to likewise align in rightness. The legendary life accompanies right being, as do self-esteem, bliss, and sublime peace of mind. All of this, simply for being our authentic divine selves.    

Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          Yes Relationships don’t fail due to a lack of love; they fail due to a lack of attendance. There is no mindless love.    We think of relationships as things we have, when in fact they are our every interaction. All of relationship comes down to simple questions of how we give and receive value. Are we mindful of our opportunities and the gifts we are given? Are we embracing what it is to serve and be served? Are we appreciative and loving?    

After the NDE:        

Was the experience difficult to express in words?        Yes   It has taken me 20 years to find the meaning and words to fully share the wisdom of how God healed me.    

How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  My recollection was etched into my mind for years. It was only when I deciphered the meaning that the experience began to fade. It's still more vibrant than any other memory from those times, but it is no longer defining of who I am. I've learned what my lessons taught, and have grown in expression as my greatest self.    

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         Yes     Clairsentience, clairvoyance, being a channel of divine love, redivining spiritual myth. I have also realized the ability to explain the truth of All That Is, defining God in terms of logic and reason, explaining the ancient truths we have forgotten. I've also realized the ability to speak with God, a natural innate gift we all have when we align in unconditional love and right being.    

Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          My three experiences preceded dozens of conversations with God. I'd not be who I am now, were it not for the compassionate guidance and understanding that was shown to me during my times of tribulation. I don't think I could have developed the relationship I have now with God, had I not had the profound shaking up of my NDE and SOBE experiences.    

Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    I shared my initial experiences with a few people, but I didn't understand their deeper meaning and so there were few who could relate. I've since realized the depth of lessons God shared about right being, and people respond very well to that message. Deep inside, we all want to be our greatest self.    

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       Yes   I'd heard a little about it, but discounted it out of hand as it was apparent those people had lost it. Their cheese had slid off their cracker, so to speak. If the accounts had any effect at all, it was to suggest that the world contains some seriously delusional people. And then I had the experiences and had to admit... it was me who had been delusional all along.    

What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real     The revelations I had out of body were in sharp contrast to the reality I accepted. They were not a logical progression of my thought processes, which I now see as very limited. From the enhanced perception, to the vast number of verifiable realizations about the world and those around me, every sign showed the experience to be genuine.    

What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real     I was given a gift of life. Before I knew God and the purpose of life, I was lost. I could have spent my entire life pursuing things that don't matter, instead of living the legendary life and being proud to be who I am. Serving others and helping all be great... well, it's the finest life there is for me. It is mine because I listened to the lessons which started with my SOBE. Such transformational experiences are divine, and divinity is their source.    

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       Yes   The more vast the love is that I express, the closer I get to the divine love I experienced in my out of body and near death experiences. The more I realize my love for All That Is, the more bliss that enters into me. Every choice I make to align moves me closer to the heaven I experienced when out of body.    

Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?         I have been given some most remarkable gifts. Where most know God through faith alone, I know through logic and reason, and am able to pass this wisdom on. I know spiritual truths that have flowed from our source through my hands. It's delightful to have such closeness with God.    I have created two books to help all beings be their greatest selves. They teach the truths God used to heal my life. They are found through these two links:    getbook.at/BYGS_Guide_Paperback    getbook.at/BYGS_Journal    For anyone who would like to start their journey without investment, I've also created a website containing many of the lessons that redivined my life. This journey begins for free at www.TheInnerBuddha.com. Be sure to check out our enlightened quotations for inspiration and to help others find their way. www.TheInnerBuddha.com/social-media/    Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?      It would be wonderful if there was a social media sharing feature on the publishing page. Your readership is immense, and it would grow if people who are moved by what they read could share this easily. A Facebook and Twitter share link would increase your readership dramatically, adding to the quality and quantity of information you have to work with.            



Experience Description 6511: 

    This experience, which lasted for months, occurred when my wife of ten years admitted she had been cheating and was pregnant. I had three young children and was not prepared for the life changes this entailed. She expressed distress, as she did not know how to proceed, but her actions up to and after that point showed me that our relationship had ended.

While we were talking about her being pregnant, I found my consciousness floating above my body, to the right and slightly above my shoulder. My conscious self then started coaching my physical self on how to get through what was going on. I observed myself crying, and instructed myself to drop my chin lower 'so the anguish would be more apparent.' I could see that my physical self was suffering immensely, but my conscious self was experiencing no pain. In fact, I felt very empowered and elated, as my consciousness filled the room and I could observe all that was within it from all angles. I knew my task was to coach my physical self through this experience. 

The experience of floating was not a sensation. There was no 'feeling' of floating, only the fact that I was. I felt empathy and overwhelming compassion for my physical self, but the pain evident within that body was not felt by this part of me. I was within the room, but I wasn't confined to my body; it was as though I was everywhere and anywhere within the room all at once. For a few moments, I oriented myself with this new freedom, moving about the room and observing the environment from various angles. That was short lived, though, because my attention was needed.

My physical self was operating like a puppet. Everything I told that self to do, it did. When the conversation had ended, I told my physical self it was time to leave and reflected on whether 'it' could drive. I watched until I was certain it could manage the trip, and so it drove the twenty minutes to town. My conscious self was rarely in the vehicle during the trip. Instead, it floated above, observing the turns and feeling comfortable that my physical self would make it to the city. I recall thinking the words 'you will be fine' as I floated above the vehicle. My thoughts still guided my physical self, but I was aware it could cease to function. I would best describe the body as 'the habitual self' and the spirit as 'the conscious self.' It was as though the habitual self could operate from memory, while unquestioningly accepting thought-based instruction. The spiritual, 'conscious self' was fully in charge. 

Floating above my moving vehicle was an empowering sensation. Moving was effortless; I simply thought myself to be where I wished to be, and there I was. I felt no motion or touch sensations of any kind. As I followed the vehicle, I could see objects on both sides of the road, as though I were in a low-flying plane. My van appeared to be about the size of a quarter, so you can imagine what my peripheral vision was like. The odd thing was that I saw objects that I had never seen before, set way back from the side roads. The view was complete and accurate to every minute detail, even though I never had been down those roads. (After the experience, I drove down those side roads to confirm what I had seen.)  

When I got to town, I went to my workplace (not recommended, but I had support there and nowhere else nearby.) I don't remember much of what took place there, save one girl who provided counseling. It was not her role at the workplace, but she did it for me and it helped me a lot. I recall while she spoke with me, that I was flitting in and out of my physical self. I could feel the emotional distress within my body and did not want to return to it completely at that time. 

I remember being out-of-body as both the most empowering and most devastating experience of my life. I remember the awe I felt in realizing that my physical self was only a husk through which I experienced my life; that it wasn't 'me.' At the same time, I could feel neither the pain of that body, nor the joy. I would hug my children but not feel the love, which I so desperately wanted to feel. This went on for months, where my conscious self was only marginally attached to my physical body. I recall reflecting on the anger and frustration I felt because I could not become 'whole' within my body again. I would estimate that it was more than nine months before I could experience a genuine emotion as a whole self. It was years before I fully returned to my body to experience life as one being. Until that time, I spent much of my worldly existence as a marginally attached spirit. I want to be clear, however, that this spirit was fully me and fully whole in itself.  

It was difficult, being outside of the body for an extended period. Initially, I felt bliss, awe, and amazement for the revelations that one has while out-of-body. Great understanding came over me, for I knew that the self exists apart from the physical. However, I neither moved on to the afterlife nor back to the physical life. Instead, I found myself remaining in stasis as an observer guiding a puppet. I did not see God, or any spiritual beings, perhaps because I really wasn't seeking to. 

I felt as though I had a duty to see the body through this traumatic experience. At many times the pain was too much for the body, and it would break down in a convulsive display of tears and agony. My spiritual self would feel compassion for that other self, comforting and caring for the emotional needs of the body, and providing understanding and reassurance. When the body was not tormented, my spiritual self would busy itself on logic puzzles, and sometimes it would travel from room to room exploring the environment in more depth than was possible while working. That too, was very liberating, and I learned a lot about my workplace that surprised me. 

At a few points, my spiritual attempted to rejoin the physical. The pain of this world was tremendous, and on more than one occasion, the attempt at rejoining my body resulted in suicidal contemplation. I envisioned my death many times, picked the method and place, and one time fear brought me bawling to a doctor, who in turn found me help. Note here that the spiritual self isn't accustomed to experiencing the pain we go through in life. It tends to feel much more compassion and love. It cannot process the pain humans can experience or inflict upon others.        

Background Information:       

Gender:     Male    

Date NDE Occurred:      'May, 2001'    

NDE Elements:       

At the time of your experience, was there an associated life-threatening event?       Yes      'Illness, trauma or other condition not considered life threatening'    My experience lasted nine or more months, involving both extreme emotional trauma and a high probability of suicide.    

How do you consider the content of your experience?      Both pleasant AND distressing    

The experience included:      Out of body experience    

Did you feel separated from your body?    Yes  I stayed near my body through most of the event. I coached it from above, and experienced life through two mediums at once.    I clearly left my body and existed outside it    

How did your highest level of consciousness and alertness during the experience compare to your normal everyday consciousness and alertness?      More consciousness and alertness than normal   Everything was crisp and clear. There was no physical or emotional fog to impair thoughts and perception. My physical self needs glasses, but my spiritual self does not    

At what time during the experience were you at your highest level of consciousness and alertness?       I was at my highest level while traveling above the van. I knew the body within the van could get to town without issue, so I explored the surroundings from above. I viewed the hills, path of the river, side streets, and some of the buildings set back from the highway. It was most astounding, because I was able to visit these new places later, and indeed they were exactly as I had perceived them to be.    

Were your thoughts speeded up?       No    

Did time seem to speed up or slow down?       No      

Were your senses more vivid than usual?       Incredibly more vivid    

Please compare your vision during the experience to your everyday vision that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.     I had full 720 degree vision. I could see all above, below, and around me at once. Everything was clear, unlike in life, where little of what meets your eyes is actually 'in focus.'    

Please compare your hearing during the experience to your everyday hearing that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.    Hearing was not different when I was in the vicinity of my body. When I moved about outside of the body, there was no sound, but I was aware of no apparent absence of sound either.    

Did you seem to be aware of things going on elsewhere?     Yes, and the facts have been checked out    

Did you pass into or through a tunnel?       No        

Did you see any beings in your experience?       No    

Did you encounter or become aware of any deceased (or alive) beings?       No        

Did you see, or feel surrounded by, a brilliant light?       No    

Did you see an unearthly light?       No      

Did you seem to enter some other, unearthly world?       A clearly mystical or unearthly realm     I remained within this world, but it was nothing like what we usually experience, because my consciousness was separate from my body. I could travel through walls to visit other parts of my workplace. I could think of a place and instantly be there, triggered by even the most minuscule of desires to be there. While I was out of my body, I explored houses within the community; traveling down streets I'd never been on, to admire the craftsmanship and artistry of the homes, other structures, and creations there. I explored nature, consciously strolling through parkways, and I often visited the wilder parts of the mountainsides. I had never daydreamed in my life, as I cannot visualize things with my eyes closed. These events could not have been dreams, unless I had been able to dream differently in the out-of-body state than I do while in it. I'll add that I reviewed many of the more unexpected discoveries again afterwards, and what I viewed with my consciousness was repeatedly confirmed.    

What emotions did you feel during the experience?       The feeling while coaching my physical self through the breakup was glorious. I felt great compassion for my physical self in such pain, but my surroundings left me in awe.    

Did you have a feeling of peace or pleasantness?       Incredible peace or pleasantness    

Did you have a feeling of joy?       incredible joy    

Did you feel a sense of harmony or unity with the universe?     I felt united or one with the world    

Did you suddenly seem to understand everything?       Everything about the universe     I became an explorer during the event. During my life, I have felt compelled to understand most things. Freed of my body, my nature changed significantly. I no longer wondered why, but instead experienced and explored. The desire to understand was very weak while within that new freedom. There just wasn't a need. I understood.    

Did scenes from your past come back to you?       No        

Did scenes from the future come to you?       No        

Did you come to a border or point of no return?       No      

God, Spiritual and Religion:       

What importance did you place on your religious/spiritual life prior to your experience?       Slightly important to me    

What was your religion prior to your experience?    Christian- Other Christian      

Have your religious practices changed since your experience?       No     I used to appreciate God, but not understand. Now I understand, and the appreciation has grown one hundred fold. I thank 'All That Is' because I appreciate using prayers of my own words. I do my best to treat every living being, as I would want to be treated. I have always cared, but now my love shines. It is more wonderful than words can say.    

What importance do you place on your religious/spiritual life after your experience?       Greatly important to me    

What is your religion now?       Other or several faiths   I am spiritual but have shed the religious dogma that surrounds my beliefs. I do study to become more, and find the lessons in Buddhism hold great knowledge.    

Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?       Content that was entirely not consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience     I lived 100% in the physical, and rejected spiritual notions with fervor. I remember hearing about people who had been out of body and thinking they were quite delusional... playing with a partial deck. Imagine my shock when I realized they were right, and that I was the one that was delusional! To a scientific mind, spiritual adventures seem impossible, but to one who has experienced them there can be no other truth.    

Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?       Yes     My spiritual beliefs remain, but the religious dogma surrounding them is gone. In my mind, God has been redefined as 'All That Is' (and there is nothing else.) This is truth, and it is the core of spiritual understanding.    

Did you seem to encounter a mystical being or presence, or hear an unidentifiable voice?       No      

Did you see deceased or religious spirits?       No    

Did you encounter or become aware of any beings who previously lived on earth who are described by name in religions (for example: Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, etc.)?       No      

During your experience, did you gain information about premortal existence?       No        

During your experience, did you gain information about universal connection or oneness?       Yes     I returned knowing we are all one. I do not know how I came to understand, only that I do. I had no notions of such prior to being out of body.    

Did you believe in the existence of God prior to your experience?       I was uncertain if God exists    

During your experience, did you gain information about the existence of God?       Yes     I became very aware that the belief we have of individuality is wrong. We perceive as individuals, so that we can express free will. But we are a part of All That Is. What was once faith is now fact. I went into the event without the question, returning with new beliefs and understanding. I do not know where the understanding originated, as my experience was many months long. I do not recall any specific discussions with God or spiritual entities, and yet my entire experience was spiritual.    

Do you believe in the existence of God after your experience?       God definitely exists    

Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:       

During your experience, did you gain special knowledge or information about your purpose?    Yes   My new understanding entirely changed my life, but this occurred through reflection on the experience; it was not information I received during my experience, if that makes sense.    

Did you believe that our earthly lives are meaningful and significant prior to your experience?       Unknown    

During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?       No        

Did you believe in an afterlife prior to your experience?       An afterlife probably exists    

Do you believe in an afterlife after your experience?       An afterlife definitely exists     Yes     Specific awareness that life exists apart from the body. We identify with and experience through our material selves, but we are not our material selves. We do not cease to be when the body dies.    

Did you fear death prior to your experience?       I greatly feared death    

Do you fear death after your experience?       I do not fear death    

Were you fearful living your life prior to your experience?       Not fearful in living my earthly life    

Were you fearful living your life after your experience?       Not fearful in living my earthly life    

Did you believe that our earthly lives are meaningful and significant prior to your experience?       Unknown    

Did you believe that our earthly lives are meaningful and significant after your experience?       Are meaningful and significant    

Did you gain information about how to live our lives?       Yes     I experienced what might be described as nine months of lucid dreaming in chains, containing countless events that were confirmed in life afterwards. It showed me that our lives on this world are not as we perceive them in body, and it also showed me that the self and body are separable. I now realize that the body is a part of me, rather than me being a part of the body. The spiritual self is the true entity and the body is a manifestation of that greater self.    

During your experience, did you gain information about life's difficulties, challenges and hardships?       Yes     There was personal validation from my spirit that my decisions in times during trial and tribulation had been appropriate, and that I was living true to my values.    

Were you compassionate prior to your experience?       Moderately compassionate toward others    

During your experience, did you gain information about love?       Yes     Life without love is tormenting. Countless times I hugged my children and felt desperate to feel the love between us, but I could not do so until my selves reunited.    

Were you compassionate after your experience?       Greatly compassionate toward others    

What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?       Large changes in my life     I changed careers, finding a leadership role where I can help leaders help others. I have lost my desire for material wealth. I have lost my ability to work having only money as a motivator. I love people more, and have learned to suspend judgment, as those who perform the actions will provide all the judgment necessary; judging themselves in the long run. I have realized there is no evil to oppose good; there is good and there is a lack of understanding (or need for growth and knowledge of goodness.)    

Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?     Yes   Yes I used to be comfortable around people who were scientifically grounded, and I didn't believe in spirit. I now believe fully in spirit, and have trouble relating to those who do not. I could never be close to anyone that is heavily focused on material life.    

After the NDE:       

Was the experience difficult to express in words?      Yes   The mechanics are easy to explain, but words do not do justice to the emotions and the tremendous freedoms felt during the experience.    

How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?     I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience   My recollection is crystal clear, like pictures etched into my mind. Which is odd, because I don't remember anything else in picture form.    

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?       No        

Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?        My understanding of 'All That Is' as well as of life, purpose, and truth, are invaluable. I would not have them if not for this experience.    

Have you ever shared this experience with others?     Yes    I have shared it with a few who are close to me. Most people aren't prepared to understand, so I don't bring it up often. I mention it when I see others that need healing, or who seek understanding that I can help bring to them.    

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?     No   I had only heard a few sparsely detailed stories which didn't interest me, as, in my opinion, the people telling them had clearly 'lost it.'    

What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?       Experience was definitely real     My experience was a gift. It showed me that there is so much more to life than we take for granted in our material state. It was joyful, and quite wonderful to explore the world, free of my body!    

What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?       Experience was definitely real     I am grateful for the understanding this has brought me. In a way, I feel as if I have cheated. While others live their lives without knowing the truth, I am fully aware. This creates a great and constant tribulation, for I now know the importance of living true to ones values (the good side) and I also understand that living true to values is essential (but I miss the 'get out of guilt free cards.')    

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?     No      

Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?       Only that for all the pain, I am happy to have experienced this part of life. I believe it would be more difficult to live in a world where the pain is real, and believing that there is nothing at the end of life. Knowing there is more has made all the difference. I'll also add that being out of body is a fantastic experience! If death is anything like what I experienced while out-of-body, it will be a most adventurous ride!        



Experience Description 6510: 

    I was pulling out of a side street onto a four-lane road. The traffic was stopped. A driver indicated he would let me cross his lane, unaware that there was a cube van coming down the lane next to his. As soon as I entered that lane, I was broadsided by the van. My driver's side window was down, so I did not hit my head on it during the impact. 

When I looked up and saw the van barreling toward me, I realized that there was nowhere for the driver to go other than through me. I remember thinking I'd be hit and might die, but I wasn't afraid. I was upset because my children were at the beach and would be in need of a ride home. I was worried for them, not for me. 

When the vehicles collided, time stopped. I felt exceptionally alert, but I recognized right away that I was not in my body! I was still inside the vehicle, above and to the right of my body. It felt perfectly normal to be in this state, as real, or perhaps more real, than when I'd been inside my body. 

Now, having time stop when you are in an accident proves to be a very interesting experience! The first thing I did was view what was going on within the vehicle. Every shard of glass from the broken windows was suspended in the air; not falling. I was caught up in the beauty of the moment, admiring how each shard of glass was refracting the sunlight differently. They looked no different from other shards of glass from a wreck, but these were all alive with light, shimmering in the air. I could perceive every shard in its entirety. 

My spirit moved around the suspended shards, admiring them for a few moments, and then I turned to the 'task at hand.' This body (to which I felt no emotional attachment) had just been in an accident, and I wasn't sure it was still inhabitable. I know that sounds odd, but that was my question; was this body still intact, could I still 'use' it?  My consciousness positioned itself in front of the body to examine it, to scan it, from top to bottom no damage.  

I was pleased, because I needed to pick up my children. I knew they would be confused if it was time for them to leave and I wasn't there to pick them up. When I realized I would need time to arrange alternate transportation, there was an instant 'blip' of urgency to return to the body, and immediately I was inside it again. 

The part of this that amazes me is that everything I described in the previous paragraph happened during the instant that I was hit. There was no passage of time; all of what I experienced had simply happened in that one instant. 

The driver of the cube van was certain he had killed me. He ran over and I greeted him in a more or less jovial way, so that he would not be concerned. I told him I was not injured. Though my mind was still in shock and I hadn't fully checked for injuries, I was pretty sure there was no damage because I'd checked during that moment of suspended time. Police and medics arrived, and I assured them I was fine. For whatever reason, they did not attempt to check me for internal injuries, and I was able to retrieve my children from their swim.            

Background Information:   

Gender:     Male

Date NDE Occurred:      Summer 2007

    NDE Elements:   

At the time of your experience, was there an associated life-threatening event?       Yes  Accident    'Life threatening event, but not clinical death'    I was t-boned by a cube van while driving a small car. The impact was on the driver's side and, though the car was written off for damages, I was not physically injured.    

How do you consider the content of your experience?      Entirely pleasant    

The experience included:      Out of body experience    

Did you feel separated from your body?    Yes  There was no passage of time, so nothing happened on earth during this event. I was able to view my body, and was aware of the precise nature of the damage to my vehicle. Things that I could not have known before I was hit were exceptionally clear within that exact moment.    I clearly left my body and existed outside it    

How did your highest level of consciousness and alertness during the experience compare to your normal everyday consciousness and alertness?      More consciousness and alertness than normal   Every sense was amplified while time was stopped. During that full moment, I could perceive everything, such as the suspended glass shards, from all angles. This freedom to move about let me see the effects of the bright sunlight through multiple perspectives at once. We cannot do this in-body, and as a result, we experience only a small portion of the glory that is.    

At what time during the experience were you at your highest level of consciousness and alertness?       I was more alert and alive while out of my body than I ever was while in it. The event was short and my senses remained heightened for that full moment in which there was no time.    

Were your thoughts speeded up?       Incredibly fast    

Did time seem to speed up or slow down?       Everything seemed to be happening at once; or time stopped or lost all meaning    Time simply didn't pass. When I examined the body and made the determination I could continue to use it, time resumed.    

Were your senses more vivid than usual?       Incredibly more vivid    

Please compare your vision during the experience to your everyday vision that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.     In that one instant, I could see everything with perfect clarity to the finest detail. My vision was '720 degrees,' meaning I could see the full 360 degrees around me, and everything beneath and above me, all at the same time. There was always a 'focal point' toward which my attention was directed, but the other surroundings looked perfectly clear as well. It was not like when you look at something with your earthly vision and you can see what you focus on clearly, while all else around it is a blur. Everything was in focus, and I would choose what to direct my attention to.    

Please compare your hearing during the experience to your everyday hearing that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.    There was no sound, save the thoughts in my head.    

Did you seem to be aware of things going on elsewhere?     No    

Did you pass into or through a tunnel?       No        

Did you see any beings in your experience?       No    

Did you encounter or become aware of any deceased (or alive) beings?       No        

Did you see, or feel surrounded by, a brilliant light?       No    

Did you see an unearthly light?       No      

Did you seem to enter some other, unearthly world?       No        

The experience included:       Strong emotional tone    

What emotions did you feel during the experience?       I was calm and collected, much as I am in life. Viewing the body was for determining the course of action I would need to take next. There was no worry, nor was there fear. I was concerned about the confusion my children would feel if they finished swimming and I wasn't there to pick them up. I felt compassion for my children, and love for them.    

Did you have a feeling of peace or pleasantness?       Relief or calmness    

Did you have a feeling of joy?       No    

Did you feel a sense of harmony or unity with the universe?     I felt united or one with the world    

Did you suddenly seem to understand everything?       No        

Did scenes from your past come back to you?       No        

Did scenes from the future come to you?       No        

Did you come to a border or point of no return?       No      

God, Spiritual and Religion:       

What importance did you place on your religious/spiritual life prior to your experience?       Slightly important to me    

What was your religion prior to your experience?    Christian- Other Christian      

Have your religious practices changed since your experience?       No     I have shed the religious dogma that surrounded my spirituality. I realized that religion is a tool used to educate those who have not had personal experience, and to offer guidance so that we can be more proud of our lives when we reflect back upon them. It has, unfortunately, ceased to be the great avenue for understanding that it was created to be, as people focus too much on the rituals and not enough on the spiritual lessons within.    

What importance do you place on your religious/spiritual life after your experience?       Greatly important to me    

What is your religion now?       Other or several faiths   Spiritual but not religious    

Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?       Content that was both consistent and not consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience     I had been out of body once before, so that part of the experience was not new. My prior event was very different though, as time did not stop during that event. My life was changed by this experience, because it explained some of what I'd thought from my prior experience.    

Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?       No        

Did you seem to encounter a mystical being or presence, or hear an unidentifiable voice?       No      

Did you see deceased or religious spirits?       No    

Did you encounter or become aware of any beings who previously lived on earth who are described by name in religions (for example: Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, etc.)?       No      

During your experience, did you gain information about premortal existence?       No        

During your experience, did you gain information about universal connection or oneness?       Yes     I returned with a new understanding. We are one. Perception of isolation is the myth. One cannot be isolated from God, when one is one with God.    

Did you believe in the existence of God prior to your experience?       God probably exists    

During your experience, did you gain information about the existence of God?       Uncertain     I realized that the spiritual nature of the world is ignored in our society. I realized there is infinitely more to existence than what the sciences suggest. I did not return knowing there was a 'God' but rather that our concept of God is incorrect. God is All That Is, and we are a part of All That Is. All thoughts we have of separation from God are illogical, because we are a part of God.        I cannot explain the origin of this understanding, except that my views of God and spirituality changed when I returned to my body. What I understood when I left my body was not what I understood upon my return.    

Do you believe in the existence of God after your experience?       God definitely exists    

Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:       

During your experience, did you gain special knowledge or information about your purpose?    No      

Did you believe that our earthly lives are meaningful and significant prior to your experience?       Are possibly meaningful and significant    

During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?       No        

Did you believe in an afterlife prior to your experience?       An afterlife definitely exists    

Do you believe in an afterlife after your experience?       An afterlife definitely exists     Yes     It was very apparent that I am not my body. The body is a mode of experience, not a source of existence.    

Did you fear death prior to your experience?       I did not fear death    

Do you fear death after your experience?       I do not fear death    

Were you fearful living your life prior to your experience?       Not fearful in living my earthly life    

Were you fearful living your life after your experience?       Not fearful in living my earthly life    

Did you believe that our earthly lives are meaningful and significant prior to your experience?       Are possibly meaningful and significant    

Did you believe that our earthly lives are meaningful and significant after your experience?       Are meaningful and significant    

Did you gain information about how to live our lives?       No        

During your experience, did you gain information about life's difficulties, challenges and hardships?       No        

Were you compassionate prior to your experience?       Moderately compassionate toward others    

During your experience, did you gain information about love?       No        

Were you compassionate after your experience?       Greatly compassionate toward others    

What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?       Slight changes in my life     I returned with the understanding that God is 'All That Is'.  My spiritual beliefs seem to have been cleansed, in the sense that I have shed the religious dogma that used to surround my beliefs.    

Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?     No   No    

After the NDE:       

Was the experience difficult to express in words?      No      

How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?     I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience   This memory does not fade.    

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?       No        

Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?        Time stopping was very significant to me. It showed me that time is not a prerequisite for thought, nor is it necessary to experience time in order to experience life. Being out of body was important because it showed me that I was not the same as my body.  I am not my body. The emotional detachment from the body was significant because it was such a stark shift from what we experience in life. I realized that the overall importance of the spirit is greater than that of the body.    

Have you ever shared this experience with others?     Yes    I do not recall how long it was after the accident that I shared it. I have shared it with very few people. Most people do not understand, so I only share it with those I am closest to.    

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?     Yes   This was my second experience, so I knew what it was like to be out of my body. I did not read about others' near death experiences until recently. Both my experiences were genuine, and I returned to this world with elation over the fact there is more to existence than I had thought.    

What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?       Experience was definitely real        

What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?       Experience was definitely real        

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?     No      

Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?       The experience of returning to my body was two-fold. Out-of-body I had a tremendous sensation of freedom and empowerment that I wished I would not have to lose by returning to my body. However, once I had returned, I continued to feel buoyant, elated by what I had experienced and learned.
