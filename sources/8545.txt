  IANDS ANNUAL CONFERENCE 
  NDE &amp; HEALING PRESENTATION
  by Jody Long

As you may already know, the theme   of the January IANDS 2003 annual conference was &quot;healing.&quot;&nbsp; In preparation for   our talk, I sent out a survey via e-mail and the U.S. Postal Service.&nbsp; The   survey went to 315 NDErs and 467 people who had paranormal experiences but that   did not fit the NDERF definition of NDE, which is &quot;a lucid experience associated   with perceived consciousness apart from the body occurring at the time of actual   or threatened imminent death.&quot;&nbsp; Out of this mailing, we had a response rate of   124 (39.4%) NDErs and 75 (16.1%) non-NDErs.&nbsp; If any of the participants are   reading this article, I want to extend my sincere thanks for all your help!&nbsp;

My portion of the talk was geared   more for entertainment than for rigid scientific mind.&nbsp; However, I didn't leave   the scientists out of the loop.&nbsp; I drafted a formal scientific study and had   copies available for interested parties to pick up on their way out of the   talk.&nbsp; A copy of this study can also be found at     https://www.nderf.org/healing.htm&nbsp; In the areas of   &quot;definition,&quot; &quot;physical,&quot; and &quot;emotional&quot; healing, there was no statistically   significant differences between the way that NDErs and non-NDErs answered the   questions.&nbsp; The only statistically significant difference was that NDErs were   more apt to be sensitive to medicines or substances after their experience.

Throughout the conference there   were a lot of problems with computer logistics and the mysterious electrical   anomalies with lights.&nbsp; Some accepted it as a normal phenomena, others turned to   sources like PMH Atwater who has a reputation for causing these electrical   disturbances, while still others started talking about Mercury in retrograde.&nbsp;   Our talk was no exception.&nbsp; PowerPoint decided to take on a life of its own and   there were also some problems with microphone positioning.&nbsp;

That didn't pose too great of a   hurdle since the first demonstration was to have the audience write down or   think about their definition of healing.&nbsp; The audience could then independently   and subjectively verify the main point of the study.&nbsp; What I found was that   researchers and survey participants tend to view &quot;healing&quot; and its efficacy   depending on how they subjectively define the word &quot;healing.&quot;&nbsp; The definition of   healing is not normally confined to a word, but is more of a concept that can   extend as far as a life style choice.&nbsp; Moreover, there are no &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot;   answers.&nbsp; Generally, those whose definitions were more focused on physical   healing, were more pragmatic in their approach to medicine.&nbsp; Those who defined   healing in holistic terms, were more likely to be open to alternative healing.&nbsp;

One way to test this theory was to   have a physical demonstration.&nbsp; Linda Jacquin, who is on the IANDS board, helped   me out.&nbsp; It turns out that Linda's NDE was caused by an allergic reaction to   prednisone and she does hands on healing.&nbsp; Prednisone is the only drug that will   save me when my asthma acts up and I can do hands on healing.&nbsp; Last year as we   made this discovery we were wondering what would happen if we put out hands   together and then tried to channel energy.&nbsp; The discovery was like plugging into   a light socket.&nbsp; We were instantly energized and refreshed.&nbsp; Linda agreed to   replicate this phenomena with me, only this time we would have two people from   the audience put their hand in between our hands and tell us what the saw or   felt.&nbsp;

The first participant was Dr. Kent   Lin, from Taiwan.&nbsp; He described feeling heat.&nbsp; His definition was much like Dr.   Jeff Long's definition of healing &quot;To restore towards health by reducing or   eliminating a physical, emotional or spiritual imperfection.&quot;&nbsp; The second   participant was Diane Schmidt, a NDEr.&nbsp; She actually started falling backwards   and reported feeling &quot;zapped.&quot;&nbsp; She also described seeing a color much like a   bright turquoise blue.&nbsp; Her definition of healing was closer to a holistic   concept.

This was amazing to me, since   Linda and I had recently had our pictures taken by the Aura photographer.&nbsp; Diane   was unaware of the pictures prior to the demonstration.&nbsp; The photographer took   one of Linda first.&nbsp; The second picture taken about a minute after the first   one, Linda did not move.&nbsp; I, however, came from behind and placed my hands over   hers.&nbsp; The picture was purple, white, and had the blue that Diane described that   she saw!&nbsp; Just to see if my energy had somehow superimposed on Linda's, I had my   picture taken about 20 minutes later.&nbsp; What we found is that Linda's and my   individual picture were strikingly similar with the reds and golds.&nbsp; There was   green on her right hand and green around my left hand.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   LINDA&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both of   us&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JODY

For the study, participants   usually described physical healing in terms of &quot;hands on healing&quot; the laying of   hands,&quot; or &quot;channeling of energy.&quot;&nbsp; Frequently, the description of physical   healing includes elements of prayer, visualization, and guidance from a higher   source.&nbsp; Described is a transfer of energy, primarily through the hands.&nbsp; There   are elements that the recipient be receptive to the energy transfer and that the   giver of the energy be sensitive enough to direct the energy appropriately.&nbsp;   Many will connect to spirit either by directly praying for divine intervention   or by altering their mental state to be more receptive to energy transfer.

NDErs bring a most interesting   spin on the traditional meaning of healing.&nbsp; As one fellow put it, &quot;I don't even   take medicine because when it's my time to go, so what?&quot;&nbsp; Which begs the   question inherent in our definition of healing, &quot;What are we healing?&quot;&nbsp; It is a   very different view when looking at healing through the lens of immortality.

The other large part of the study   turned out to be about emotional healing. &nbsp;When asked if individuals had   abilities to heal another person, 38.8% of respondents described emotional   components of healing.&nbsp; They felt they could heal be being empathic, giving   encouragement, nurturing, in tune, more aware, and full of love towards others.

When asked if they had experienced   emotional healing attributable to their experience, I was a bit surprised by the   two largest categories of answers.&nbsp; Emotional healing is described as becoming   more peaceful or more relaxed.&nbsp; Additionally emotional healing is described as   losing the fear of dying and being certain of the continuity of mortal life.&nbsp;   Although I know that this is a feature characteristic to NDErs, I never   correlated it with emotional healing or being such a powerful healer.&nbsp;

We had a hugging demonstration to   show the power of emotional healing.&nbsp; Those who wanted to participate could stay   in the center of the room and those who didn't want to participate could move   out towards the edges.&nbsp; Participation was purely optional.&nbsp; After invoking Lee   Campbell's name and describing her full-meal deal hugs, I told the audience   those were the hugs we were looking for.&nbsp; Due to time constraints, hug 3 people   instead of 10.&nbsp; I consider the experiment a total success.&nbsp; The audience was   having such a good time, I couldn't get them to stop!&nbsp; It was truly magnificent   how the energy of the room changed.&nbsp; There was more connection between members   of the audience and there was so much love and goodwill.&nbsp;

Not only did the talk go well   despite the electrical and computer problems, there was an additional blessing   conferred upon NDErs right before the banquet dinner.&nbsp; IANDS president, Bill   Taylor, was pulled aside by an NDEr who was adamant about the need for a prayer   circle.&nbsp; Spiritually, we were placed in the proper position.&nbsp; Everyone present   in the room formed a circle and then linked arms around their neighbors.&nbsp; During   the prayer, I was a bit surprised to get an emerald the size of a brick shoved   into my consciousness.&nbsp; It was placed on the left side over my heart.&nbsp; Oddly,   there was a tear-shaped void or area of darkness to the bottom right hand side   of the emerald.&nbsp; I said, &quot;Oh, I guess I have to fill that with light.&quot;&nbsp; I then   noticed two strong, large bands of light went flowing from the emerald, through   my arms and out like a wide ribbon through the rest of the circle.&nbsp; I fully   expected the ribbon of light to stop when it joined itself on the opposite end   of the circle.&nbsp; It didn't.&nbsp; Rather it kept going and returned back to me,   thereby making two full circles of light through the group. &nbsp;I talked to   Margaret Burwell, an NDEr from Richland, Washington.&nbsp; She was kind enough to   help me realize that this was a tremendous spiritual healing gift for the whole   group ' individually and collectively.
