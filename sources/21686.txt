these ten ways. All versi~ns o~
Ag~less Wisdom,·Ea$tern and Westernt
agree on this. ·
The one, living, conscious Light
2- knows itself perfectly. I ts perfec~
self..,knowledge is represented by 2,
because that. knowle.dge is the per-
fect duplication cif th~ real B•ing
of the One, in that· One's compl~te
self~awareness. To this Qabalis ts
give the name iTO.'.ln, Chokmah~ Ylisdoin.
They add th~ title lN,· Ab~ Fath~r,
becau~e th~ One knows itself .to be
the perfe~~ion of all that is- .:mascu-
line and in{tiative.
·Again, Chokmah is. called n•,oo,

Q~hal:i.sts call Binah ltOlt, Amo# the

Aima, the ·bright, pregnant Mother.

cause this aspect of Reality is the

Volition is not an individual or !""
personal power. When Jesus said,
''I have no will, save to do the
wi H of h im that sent me , ' • he an -
nounced a discovery. His words Wel;'e
not a mere proclamation as to hi.s
personal at: ti tude to~ard the One

Something. Of I I .their OWn 0 ' t t .
~very human being is sent into

Every man or woman is an organ of
·ex:pression for that Self. The Vo.Ii'.'.'
tion of that Self is perfectly free.•
Thus we' are c~rrect when we feel
.wi.thin us a fountain of free•will.
~e·are wrong when we suppose th~
will~sour~e to be personal.
Because •til{tion tends always
to~ard action and transformation, it
is related to the idea ·behind the
word ''law.•• In an absolu~e m~n­
ar·~ny_, law is the will o.f the king.
In a demecracy1 law is ·the will of

necessitates des true ti on of useless
fQrms, to make room .for. hetter ones,
both .Voli.tion and Law are atti:ihuted
to the fifth Sephirah•
. This has three names. .The first is
in~, Pach~d, Fear, and represents
the emotion induced in many'.minds by
t;he mere presence of men or women.in
wnom the will-force ,flows powerfully.
The same emotion is aroused by. law
in the hearts of law-breakers.
The seeond nam.e .is ii1,~l, Ge burah,
which signifies •'Streng.th,'' though
it is often translated ~'Severity~'•
It requires no explanation.
The third name is P1, Deen, Jus-
tice. This rep.resents the highes·t
aspect of Law and of Volition. In-
cidentally, it gives us' a standa~d.
No unjust regulation is a real law.
No unjust volition is true will.
Thus he who exercises what he sup-
poses to be ''will'' in dis~egard
of the rights of others, deludes
hifuself, and demonsi~at~~ to wi~er
men th~t he is a~iually a sl~~e io
his own delusiotls. .
Its association with poWH"r voli-
tion and action makes Sephirah 5 the
Sphere ·of Mars (in He brew,· 0 '11t0,
Madim, powe~s, force.a, Mars}. Here
it :i.s well to remeinhef that Mars has
other functions thajl those connected
-9-

THE MASTEILPATl'ERN 1
with war. In· Roman times. Mars ..was
worshipped as the protector of
agriculture, ~nd the gu~rdian of
cattle. He was supposed to give
fertility to fields. Traces of this
are found in the astrological ideas
about Mars, and these, we should
remember, have their basis in the
co lle ctive subc.o.nsciousness of man-
kind, witk its store of remembered
experience •. All myths are drawn
from this same treasure-house, and
all.have an indes~ructible vitality
and _worth for us' if we' have wit to
see· throu.gh "their veils to the .ttuth
behind. . .
· The human Ego _is a direct reflec -
tion of the One.Self. It is that
One Self, at work in an individual-
1zed field of expr-ession. It ·i~. a
point.of concentration for p~wers
which.are above. beh1nd and w:lthin
it. It is also a point through
which these po~ers ar~ radiated to
the four aspeets of Reality which
are below (or subordinate), iri front
of (as a ma•k hide~ a face, or a
dress clothes a body). nnd apparent-
! y outside it. ·
T~e primary function of the Ego i,s
the formation of mental-images. I&

signifies ••breath,'' hut mea~s als~

just what St Paul and-' other New
Testament writ·ers ·indicate by
pne uma. In the En.glish Bible, both
pneuma· and -Ruach ·are transhlted
• I Spirit~ I I -The Spirit is the focus
o-f · pow·ers descending to it· from
higher cente·rs, -. and it is ·also the
point of control over subordinat~
powers ·of personality. :
Just as the Supernal ~riad·i~
eternal, ~6 is its-reffection, the
Triad of IndividuaHty. ·(See the
diagram· accomp.anying this lesson.)
This Egoic Triad is the Higher Mind,
and the Ego or Hi gh~r Soul is the
point in which the powers of this
Triad are concent'rated. ·
The Ego never was born. It will
neve·r die. The -Ego~ moreover, is
One, like the S:el'f it reflects, and
wi t h whi c h i t -: ·i s · in an e t er n a 1
union. Thus the Ego is what the 'New
Testament mystery-term ·-4 -'Chri-st' t
really signifies. ~
.. • 'Ch~is'..t'' is .t.he- English £.or
Xptcn6c;, Christos_. aGr~ek noun ~ig­
nifying I I &DOiD ted-I I (and by impli-
C~t iOD, ''royal~' or ''kiQgly''),
which is the meaning also of the
H~hrew Mruo, /.less iach or M-us iah.
Thus. the esotedc>t:eaching is that
men' -and women do·not:·have se'p-arate
pers'onal e·gos, any more than' they·
-11-

have separate personal wills; or
separate .·per.sonal memories.,· This
delusion of separateness is at the
bottom of the ilb which beset suf-
fe.ring humanity. Whea a human being
succeeds in shifting bis center of
consciousness from the lower centers
to the.true Ego, these d-elusions are
dissipated, and with them goeis the
suffering ~hey cause.
All s~viors and king-priests are,
in the myths of mankind, asseciat'ed
with the Sun.· Thus we ·find that th~
sixth Sephirah on the Tree of Li.le-
is also ilO.n, Khamt4aV1, or WIX', Shea-.
esh, the Sphere of the Sun.
Sun~gods are gods of justice and
its administ.ration. ·.·Thus Apollo,.
among the Greeks, was the l'ewarder ·
and punisher, as well as patron of c
,the al'.ts, esp.eeiaUy of music.· The
Egyptian deity Osiris is also a .dis• ·.
pen.ser of ·rewards and ·pun:ishmen•s, .a·
god o·f fertility, and ' sun-god. In
th.e New Testament the ••son of Man''
is a judge, a king, a fertility
souree (for from him Bows the w•ter ~
of life), and is called "Sun ~f
righteousne.s:~.' • ·
.·Apel lo was venerat•d by th.e Greek$ ,

of Revelation shows ChJ:'ist as· th.e
founder of a new world-order, and
symholiz es thoe per fee-ti~n of His
reign as a city, the New Jerusalem,
which- is also ~he- Bride of Christ;.•
One might go throug}l t;~e myths-of
the other world-religions, a~d find'
endless repetitions and variati_ons
of the same theme. In our Master
Pattern, all th.ese a-~e asso<:iated

Th-ere is only one Ego. - 1 'Your'' Ego

••their' • Ego. As ~e sun warms the
-world, so the One Ego sends its pow-
er into human liv.es. As. The Bhaga-
tlad-Gita says, t-his Ego dwells in
the he.arts of men, but no sin~le

THE·MAS'il:Jl PATtERN.1
Desire is based on memory. We
desire to repeat past experiences,
even th-0ugh the memories be wholly
subconscious. Th-en the desires man-
iJest as instinctive promptings to ~
action.. Memory is behind it all.
The personal mind often distorts
desire. ~t presents ~s with mi~­
tak~n forms of desire, and with
mistaken notions of what means we
should use-in order to make-our de-
sires work out as actualities. Y.e..t
it is· fµndame.n:tally true that the
inner essencecof every desire is
go()d.
The religions of the ~orld; ~~en
so ·severe a religion. a$ Buddhism, do
no.t ·condemn desire itself. Inter~ .·
pi'eters .f.>f ·Buddhism have fallen int.o
t-his e-rr,or-, .and there are ·sects of
Buddhis~s wh-0 condemn desire. Not
so lhe Buddha himself. What he
taught was what all great seers and
prophets have taught, the q.uenching
of desire by ·fulfilment, the overco~­
ing of thirst by comple.te satisfac-
. tion. r-
Every desire is a promise. De-
sires make their first appearance as .,;1
feelings of lack, hunger, or the
state of not having or enjoyin.g what
is desired. Actually t'here is no
lack. ·na imperfection·, n-0 shortcom.- ·
-14-
ing, in th·e One Life. Nothing is
wanting to· its perfecti'On. Omnipo• ·
te·nce never fails. We are marii fes-
t a·t ions of a suc-Cess pr-o·cess.
Thel'efo·re is it written that before
we call w·e al'e answered~'. Ou-I' de-
sires are budding realizations of
w~at •e really are, and what we
J;"eally can he •.
Hence; ia the Ma.-ter: Pattern.~ the
des·irie·n•ture is· attrihut·ed to ·the
Sephirah taamecl Jul·, Ne tzoch, Vic.;·

The Roman Venus is also identified
with -the Grecian goddess .t\phr-odite,
and Aphrodite, in turn, was a Greek
adaptatic:m of powers personified in
Semitic religion by Astarte or Ash-

- V"icttix, ,or Victorious, and this
links -her with the seventh Sephira,h,
since Netzac1i means Victory.

through Yiddish,· comes the slang r
term •'goof,'' to describe a ··dul- '-

·There is no such thing as a !Jep-
arat:e body •. Every physic.al body,
whether it be that of mineral,
plant, or human being, is actually
a focus of 'various energie·s. Phys -

The form of.a body is re.latively·
stable, but its component parts are
continually changing. A body is
like a whirlpool, o.r a waterspout,
or the cone of a 'cyclone. It h~s

to the Ego, the latter can, .and

ha·ve power to integrate and disinte:O
grate their phys.ical bodies. Tlms
they are free from the necessity for
either death or birth.
When· a human consciousness is per-
fectly identified with the true Ego,
and the Ego is the director of the
entir'e field of personal embodiment;
this unbroken maintenance of the
structure of the physic~l body
becomes.possible. So long as the
cente~ of human consciousness re-
main.s ·fixed in Nephesh, the Vlta1
SouJ1 death: and· rebirth are inevit-
able. The lowest.degree of command

meant by being '" 'lifted up.•' For
the •·•heaven'' into which Jesus as-
cended is this same interior heart
of exteinalized being. Even the
garbled accounts in our· fragmentary
Gospels make this clear.· -
Religious painters who picture
Jesus flying up into the sky use a
crude symbol, to represent the rais-
ing of vibfatory rate, whereb~ an
adept is able t6 make his physical
body seem to demateriali~e. When
this is done, there is an intermedi-
ate stage, wherein· the dematerializ-
ing body appears like a cloud.
Hence one Gospel story of the ascen-
sion says~ ''A cloud received him
out of their sight·.''.·
Religious persecution, on the one
hand, and inadequate science, on the
other, have kept these doctrines of
Agel~as Wisdom more or less esoter-
·ic;. A time has now come when they
must he proclaimed more widely, or
we are in danger of a return to the

nm MASTER PATTERN
LESSON nmEE
IN Turba Philoaophorum~ or The
Assembly' of the Sages, an ancient
Latin alchemical treatise. we read:
''Know that no true tincture is
made ex£ept from our copper. Do
not, therefore, exhaust your brains
and your money, lest you fill your
hearts with sorrow. Unless you turn
the aforesaid copper into white, and
make visible coins, and then after-
wards turn it again into redness
until a tincture results, ye accom-
plish· nothing. Burn therefore the
copper, break it up, deprive it of
its blackness by cooking, imbuing
and washing, until the same becomes
white. Then rule it.,..
Copper is the metal.of Venus. Its
English name is from a Greek word
which is also the root of the p·lace-
name ' 'Cyprus, ' ' given to the island
where Venus is fabled to have risen
at.., from the sea. In Cyprus were copper
mines which supplied the ancient
world. Hence th& association be-
tween Venus or Aphrodite, and the
metal. This is the alchemical at-
tribution of the seventh Sephirah,
Netzach, the seat of the desire
nature, and the Sphere of Venus.
-1-
A
MASTER PATTERN 3
Alchemical copper is not the metal
of the mines. Hence the quotation
says ''our'' copper, jusi as'alchem-
ists speak elsewhere of ''our••
matter, ''our'' Mercury, and so on.
It is ''ours'' because it is found
inside us. f""4
In the human body, one of the most
active centers related to desire and
emotion is the Venus center in the
throat. It is a group of organs,
rather than a si~gle nerve center~
/
This group includes the pharyngeal
plexus behind the Adam's apple,
together with the thyroid and para-
thyroid glands. When this center is
disturbed by a wave of -strong feel-
ing, we choke with emotion. Always
the emotion is related to so~ething
we want to happen, or to something
we desire intens~ly to avoid or
avert. ~en there is any disease of
the thyroid, emotional instability
is an invariable symptom.
The quotation from Turba Philoso-
phorum gives another valuable hint
when it says: ,. 'Do not exhaust your
brains and &U your hearts with sor-
row.•• One reason for the sterility
of many modern intellectual move~
ments concerned with human weliare.

that they have too much head and too

real amelioration of the· lot -0f hu-
man being·s.
Such -transformation, or power to
bring it about,- is what alchemists
mean by tincture. Furthermore, ,they
distinguish two kinds of tincture•-
that which soaks into a substance,
and ·changes its nature through and
through, and that which produces no
more than a superficial coloring.
For this .second k:lnd of tinctu,re
they ~ave only condemnation, and
declare it to be the agency of im-
posture.
Turba goes on to describe the pro-
cess. The first step is to work on
our desires; so as to change them
into white. White is the color
assigned to Kether on the Tree of
Life. In the raw or green state in
which desires firs·t take form, their
essential whiteness is difficult to
perceive. That is, it is not •lways
easy to see the connection between
what fo.rms itself in our .minds as a
desire, and the outward-moving i~­
i:Julse from the Central Self which is
the real. cause of that desire. @e-
s ires do not origi_nate in the per-
sonal consciousness. Behind ever:y
desire is the outward ~nd dow,nward
m•~ement of an impulse from the -
Primal Eill-to-good.~
To the question, ''What is the
meaning ofhuman_f:rsonality?'' we
MASTER PATIERN 3
answer that every one of us exists
here on earth for something. We are
here to give expression to the Pri-
mal Will-to-good. Through the
working of the desire nature we be-
come aware·~f the specific forms of
expression which constitute what may
be called our personal vocation•
.· This is what we meari by saying
thatThuman desires are really. the
promi:'ses of God:} Th~y come to us--
like the Venus_~tscribed in alehemi-
cal writing~--disguised as beggars
dressed in filthy rags. They make
their appearance as ••wants,'' and
whenever we want something, it al-
ways seems ~e do not have it. When
our stomachs are empty, we are hun-
gry. Empty hearts long for love.
Empty purses make us desire wealth.
Empty heads seek to be filled with
all manner of external amusements
and distractions. Even those de-
sires called ''low'' by persons of
small understanding--even the de-
sires which drive us into ''sin''~­
they are promises, too.
· Not one but has its use. Not one /9
bu~ may be p~rified to whiteness,
when we trace its origin to the Pri-
mal Will. (Not one we must suppre!!;J
No, the victory comes directly in
consequence of what alchemists-mean
by ''turning crude copper into
whiteness.''
-4-
This is by no means the end of the
work. The next step is tomake that
purified white copper into ''visible
coins.''
Tarot gives us a clue. On the Ma-
gician's table lies a coin. Among
the minor trumps there is a suit of
Coins or Pentacles. They represent
the ~ctual things of the physical
plane; and, with the exception of
thin·gs spontaneous!y produced by na-
ture, there is not one physical
object which is not the embodirnent
of human desire.
However truly we may relate -it to
the Primal Will, no desire has any
real effect until it makes a ·differ-
ence here on the physical plane.
Something must be transformed.
Something must be. brought out, into
tangible actuality, in. th.e field of
the human senses.
:·Desire health as much as we may.
even though we know clearly that
this desire is a direct reftection of
the One Self's will to wbolenes$,
(our work is not complete until it is
made manifest in a heal thy body) and
in various instrumentalities for the
transformation of sick bodies into
heal~hy ones~ Hospitals, machines
for harnessing and directing subtle
radiations of the Limitless Light·-
even drugs, and the like, .for those
who c~n find no better way.

MASTF...R PATI'ERN 3
So with all desires. They must be
more than wishes. They must be cast
into defi~ite patterns of physical
things. This is one -reason s-0 many
persons fail to get beyond occult
theory into satisfactory and useful
demonstration ef occult practice.
They do not learn the great lesson
of the Book of Nature, the lesson
that the Life-power never ceases to
drive toward physical embodiment.
Whatever else we know or do not
know, we have. sensory evidence that
God is a power bringing solid,
tangible 'things into physical lei,ng,
and in our more fortunate times, the
mask of terror Nature wore for more
primitive men and women is less
frightening. Storm and desert, sea
and jungle, are no longer taken for
evidences of Natur.e' s cruelty and
malice. Even the worst failures of
unaided Nature may be transformed
into shining successes, when her
foices are overcome from within by
the balanced powers of desire and
intellect, Venus and Mercury, heart
and brain.

MASTER.PATIEBN3
In this identification of personal
desires with wha~ amounts to a ~ni­
versa-1 tendency, back~d by irresi·s·t-
ible power, we find the meaning of
bringing our Venus to whiteness.
Yet the work we are now considering
does not end with this. Having-made
our· crude Venus white, we must make
it into ' 1 visible ~oins,'' as al-
ready explain~d. These clear pat-
terns must then be turned again to
' •redness.''
On the Tree of Life, red is the
color assigned to Mars, both the
planet itself, and its"Spbere,
·Geburah, the seat of Volition. The
same color is assigned to th~ path
of the sign Ar1es, ruled by Mars,
and represented in. Tarot by. Key 4,
the Emperor•
.When our clear vision and defini-
tion (Heh, Sight, Aries, Emperor)
have fashioned our Venus into s~e~
cific, adequate forms, we rid our-
sel'!'es of the sense of lack implied
by the verb ''want.'' Fo~ it we
substitute the confident expectation
of certain fulfilment, and then.we
are well on our way"to making the
tincture.
Then our intention, ou·r volition,
comes into play. W-e use our self~
conscious intell~ctual powers to
keep the vision before us, to deepen
-11-
----------------
.
MASTERPATfERN3
our intent.ion. to ·focus our purpose.
By use of the same self-conscious
powers, we finish and perfect our
vision.
Here we must keep in mind one par•
ticular thing. No matter what our
desire may he, no matter how per;.
fectly we may have succeeded in
purifying it, ou~ steady purpose
must be ~lways toward the ou~ward,
visible expression of the desire, in
appropriate physical embodiment. In
practical experience we shall find
that this includes not only some
change for the better in our ideas.
and in our emotional expr~ssion, but
also some direct modification of our
. physical structure, and some change
in our surroundings.
In the main, what is called ''al-
chemy~' .is the transformation of the
operator himself. Always from with;.
in outward. In this, de~ire and
intellect are the principal iristru~
ments. Yet the work is by no means
complete until the astr~l, etheric
and physical bodies of the operator
have been changed. Thus the primary
aim of alchemy is.~he transfiguration
of the al~hemist himself.
His -0wn personality is the true
subject of -the Great Work. He him~
self becomes the true Philosophers'

By ~his it is meant that often,

must endeavor, by the exercise of
reason and imagination, to relate

"' Again, the Sphere of. Mercury, Hod

Thus In-tellect reflects Volition,

controls the activities of the Vital
Soul directly, through the operation
~f ihe force at work in the path
corresponding to the letter Samekh,
which is represented i~ Tarot by

A desire may take.a distorted form,
Just as the form taken by a. crystal
may be imperfect. when the crysul-
li zing substance is placed in an
unfavorable envir~nment. Few per-
fect crystals. are found in -nature.
Reduce a crystal to its essential
solution, and place it in a favor-
able situation,· and you get-a

will be perfect.
From this we may learn a great
deal. Habit, upbringing. mistaken

social or physical environment, may
distort our dasires, and make them
take imperfect shapes. But if we

In the clarified mind of an adept,
the kingdom of stone, or mineral
kingdom, assumes an appearance very
different from the aspect of stubborn
resistance and dead lethargy it
wears in the mind of a tyro.· In-
stead of its being an obstacl~, it
is perceived as a means to the ful-
filment of desire. It is se.en to be
of the same fundamental substance as
thought and feeling. The laws which
manifest themselves in physics and
chemistry are seen to be mental
laws.
The substance of the physical
world is no longer thought of as
being something alien to man's spir-
itual life. It is simply another
aspect of that life, and. more than
this, an aspect which is naturally
responsive to control and direction
from the self-conscious level.

assure himself intellectual)~ that
this is true. He changes his body,
so· that it is able to act as an
instrument wh~reby the Central Self
brings to bear, ·U:pon all level~ of
m~nifestation below man, the inRu-
ence of spiritual forces above the .~
plane of human personality. \
Man is the mediator between what
is below and what is above, even as
pictured in Key 1 of Tar~t •. He
shapes his desires into coheren~
patterns, which agree with the basic ·
tendencies of the cosmic order.. By
the same laws ·whereby. the Life"'!pow-
e:r manifests and mai~tains the p'1ys-
ical universe, man is then enabled
to modify the forms taken by that
manifestation.
Beginning.with his own body, and
extending his administration of cos-
mic law, step· by step, he grows into
a· being who-is more than ''natur•l
man,'' mastering himself and ·nature.

The answers to these questions
provide· also the answer to a 'fourth
and culminating inquiry:
4. Where am I going?'
The answers are. not beliefs. They
are not con.victions. They-are as-
sured and definite knowledge, and
they lead to a mos( impo~tant dis-
covery. Man,._ ~f all the inhabitants
of the earth, is the only being able
to participate consciously in the
evolutiona~y process~
Ants herd their insect cows, but
no ant colony ever bred a new· type
of aphis. Man is able to transform
wolves and jackals into friends and
companions, and can develop new
strains at will. Man tr•nsmutes
grass in to wheat, and fills· the world

ment. Fewer still, watching more
closely, have hit on yet another way
to participate in con$cious evolu-
tion--but even in tiis supposedly
enlightened age, only a minority are
capable of grasping the bare idea--
let alone the technique for carrying
it out.
By•this we m~an that a small num-
ber of persons in any generation are
able., not only to conceive the pos-
sibility of the-development of genus
homo into something beyond the natu--
ral man, but have power also to
effect that transformation and trans-
mutation in themselves. -Having done
so, they wield powers greater even
than those attributed to them by
wild romance. ·
Greater, but· not quite the same.
Hence they who know the marks of a
genuine adept or Master will never
be deceived by tales written by pre-
tenders to higher knowledge. The
outstanding account of a real Master .
is the life of Jesus, fragmentary as
the Gospel record is.
Compare the simple, yet compelling
Gospel history with the marvels re-
counted in some :.of the New Testament
Apocrypha, espeeially those written
to mee·t the demand for fuller knowl-
edge of Jesus' childhood. Then you
will understand, if you have any
critical sense, why the canon of the
-8-
-
MASTER PATTERN 4
New Testament rejects these products
of a not very vivid imagination.
Yet mo~t of the Apocryph·a are su-
perior to some modern· stories about
Masters. When one has grasped the
s ignilicanc·e of Jesus' life and
works, the ''Shasta side-shows''
seem tawdry indeed; and the vague
accounts of • :'initiations'' which
serve as escape literature for a
certain type of ~ind •ufter sadly by
comparis~n with the narrative of the
initiation--mis-called temptation--
in the wilderness.
Masters there are, and their mas-
tery consists in their perfect
-response to the impul•es coming to
them from the archetypal Ego which
is the nucleus of every human Higher
Soul. They who have attained -to
conscious union with that Ego have
the Philosophers• Stone, the great
secret of transmutation. This they
attain by three pr.ocesses, illus-
trated in Tarot by three Keys, which
we shall consider in-this and the
two following lessons.
The first step toward union with
the Higher Soul is represented in
Tarot by Key 15. This Key corre- .
sponds to the pa:th lea<lj.ng upward on .
the Tree of Life, .from. the eigh·th

LESSON FIVE
SOMETHING WHICH needs repeating
again and again is. that in spite of
all figures of speech about ' 'scaling
the heights,'' or ••seeking higher
things,'' the Way of Discovery trav-
ersed by occultists leads nowhere
but within.
Some readers of ttia l~s$~n may
know a pra~tice c~ll~d ··rising in
the planes.'' One sits in a chair.
He imagines he has a body of light.
Having formulated his image of .this
body, he endeavors to send it
straight upward, by an inte,nse act
of will. When he attains proficiency
in this, he finds himself on anoth.er
plane of exist~nce.
This result is not a mere reaction
to suggestion. It is by no means
wholly a subjective experience.
The experimenter visits what can
be described in .no other way than .as
definite localities~ They hue their
own characteristic features. They
have scenery, including vegetation,
rivers,. trees, mo~ntains, plains,
buildings, and the like. Their
inhabitants include human beings,
animal's like those we know, and oth-
er creatures, both animal and human-
-1-
MASTER PATfERN 5
liket ~iBerent from anything on
earth.
Repeated experiments make it clear
that the~e 11 localities 1 • may be re-
visited again and again. Conditions
there are different from those we -~
know here; but, in their way, they
are stable as those of the physical
plane. . .
This is the field of existence as•
s ociated with the ninth Seph.i r.ah,.
110"', Yesod. This Sephirah is named
Yesod, Foundation, because the inner
p laiie corresponding to it ia the ac-
i.u·aJ basis of dl physical manifes..;
tation. It is the astral plane of
mod~rn theo~ophy, the.Sheol of the
Hebrews, the Hades of the Greeks,
which we call the ••hereafter.'' ' It
is the ''spirit world'' whence come
all mediumistic manif~stations,
good, bad, and indifferent.· Finally•
it is the natural habitat of the
Vital Soul.
This world of the living dead·-and
of· others besides them--is not some..-
whe~e els~. It is right here. We
are living in it now, just as truly
as we shall be after we discard
these physic~l bodies. We hav•
liv~d in it ~uring many periods ~f
discarnate life. We have- emerged
from it into incarnation, again and
again. We are in iti and of it.-
this very moment, and always.

t·here -is no need for detaching your
astral vehicle fre.m your physical
h~dy. -
In physical space and time, such
detachment is possible, but it is
aost· dangerous. Physical time and
space, however, have nothing to do
with the •'other world;'' and even
for such astral "'journeys'-' as
apparently tra~elling from Califor-_
nia to some distant place, say, New
York, and bringing back a correct
report of conditions in the locality
visited, there is_ no need for an ac-
tual detachment of the higher bodies
from the physical vehicle. What
really occurs is that th~ center of
consciousness is sbif-ted from aware-
nea s of the physical plane to
QW&reness of the Vital Soul.
The Vital Soul is the collective
sub-consciousness of the whole human
race. Every human being is a center
of this collective ac~ivity. To
per.cei~e what is hatppening at a dis-
tance, one need not t:r•vel at all.
On.e simply tunes in on the wave-
length, so to say, -.of som~ person•
or perhaps of several pe-rsons, liv-

they do receive and respond to the

The Vital Soul makes us omnipres-

have even a wider range., including
the whole solar system. for though
there is little in the way of pos-

and women who are fully conscious of
both astral and physical planes.
They a~e not discarnate •ntities.
~ Some discarnate entit'ies are engaged
in teaching, and sometimes they give
out excellent instruction, when they
find a suitable conscious medium of
high type. The B. O. T. A. 1n-

inc~rnate hu~an beings. Of th~se,
so~e are fully awake on the physical

the spiritual pl~ne ~rirresponding io

includes yet others 1 who have con-
scious access to still higher planes
corresponding to the Sephiroth
above Tiphareth.
Just as some of us have establis·h-
ed conscious contact with Teachers
awake on both ~stral and physical

Our Teachers do not pretend to be
infallible.- Tltey know a great deal
more than we. . They have solved most
of the problems which puzzle a~d
dismay the average human being.
They have found the angels hidden
behind the masks of most ef the dev-
ils we fear. Yet ~hey confess to
having problems of their own. ·Fur-
thermore, they have theories~ as yet
not fully verified, just as do our
exoteric scienti~~s~
On matters of theory, therefore,
there are some .differences of opin-
ion, even among members ()f the Inne.r
School, though _all agree on mattei-s
of' knowledge. ·Some the.ories held so
recently as about a hundred years
ago, or a little more, have been ex-
ploded by research.
Hence it ia unwise to place too
much reliance on the doctrines of
ancient writers. if they be theoret-
ical or abstract. The true spirit
of science has no finer representa-
tives than the Teachers of the Inner
School. They .insist that all genu-
ine knowledg~ may be ~erified, and
that the experiments leading to ver-
i 6cat ion may always be rep~ated
under suitable conditions.

use among advanced occultists, who
have gained much knowledge concern-
ing the astral plane.
In the opinion of our Teachers,
rieither· rising in the planes, not
the cultivation of psychic receptiv-
ity to astral inftuences, are desir- ~
able methods of research. There is
a better w~y~ We can master the
forces, and, to some .extent, the
inhabitafits, of the astral plane,
through the use of creative imagina-
tion. The best preparation for this
is to gain skill in the use of im-
agination by applying it to the
concrete affairs of this incarnate
life. SJ<ill is what we need, and if
we gain. it here, we shall have lit-
tle to learn about applying it at
higher, ~ore interior levels. -
Remember, all exercise of creative
imagination produces even its·physi-
cal effects by shaping the subtle
substance of the astral plane. Art-
ists, composers, writers, architects
and designers of all sorts~ dev~lop
skill which enables them to make
easy adju~tment to the situation in
•hich they find themselves after.the
death of the physical body.
They who waste their lives in
quest .of dis-traction or sensation,
they w·ho· cannot bear to be alone
with their thoughts (perhaps because
human nature, like the rest of na-

The method preferred by our Teach-
ers is sometimes called· "Th·e Knowl-
~dge and Cqnversation of·the Holy
Guardian·Angel.'' This angel is
really the single Ego of all human-
ity, ·•entioned in ~h~ preceding
lesson. Yei, for practical par~
poses, we may take as our basis for
expetiment th~ old notion tb~t to
every man and woman is appointed a
sp-ecial guardian. Our knowledge
that th~ angel of on~ is also the
a~.gel of all should not deter- us
from. taking advantage of his pres-
ence..
What is imp~itant i~ that the
Divine Presence is already over-
shadowin~ and guiding us. ·.Does.it
matter, when you understan.d the
A~gel best, that yo_tJ ·learn f~om Him

an_ of all you~ brothers and sisters?

direction diminished for you because
He leads them too? Of course not.
The Knowledge and Conversation of
the Holy Gua~dian Angel must he
practiced. Begin by inviting the
Pi:e.sence. This does not really call
the' Angel to you. He has been with
you forever. He is with you always.
Your mental invitation is really an
acknowledgement of His presence.
That est~blished, the next thing t~
do is to list~n. .
Readers who know Tarot will ob-
serye that the number of the Key
which represents the Angel is 14.
Its digits add to 5, the number of
the Hierophant,-or revealer cif mys-
teries. Both Keys represent your
central Ego.
Thus the angel wears the solar
disk which identifies him as Michael.
the great archangel of the sun, and
the archangel of the sixth Sephirah,
Tipha,reth. On his breast• is written
the divine name n'~'. specially
attributed ~o Tiph~reth.
When we invite his presence, we
are really asking to be shown his
special opetation.in the events of
our lives. There is no need to ask
for specjal ''occult experiences.''
The commonplace events of daily life
will serve. No event is really c~m­
monplace. All are tinged with mys-
tery and wonder.

LESSON SIX
IN LESSON 29 of our course on
~ . TAROT FUNDAMENTALS, we have written:
11 Man fears death because he does
not know the meaning of this trans-
~ formation. 'Dissolution is the
secret of the Great Work.'' The dis-·
solution of form is imperative for
growth. When forms br~ak down,
energy is released; a~d is utilized
for further development•
.••stone disintegrates to 'form
soil, and from soil springs the
vegetable kingdom. Animals eat the
vegetables, and incorporate their
essences into a higher type of or-
ganization. Man eats both animals
and vegetables, and builds the chem-
ical energy of their cells into his
own body. If he learns a secret
which is available for all who have
ears to hear, and are willing to
work, man does more than this. He
liberates himself from the condi-
tions of physical existence, and by
so doing, becomes master of the
energies which build his body.
''When he has achieved this mas-
tery he is able to maintain his
-1-

physical body for many years beyond
the ordinary span of human life.
Furthermore, in the full perfection
of this mastery, man is able to dis-
integrate his physical body at will,
and able also to reintegrate it.
For such a man, death, as the world
knows death, is at an end.•'
We do not ask you to give uncriti•
cal assent to this statement. We
simply point out that it is neither
unreasonable, nor does it run coun-
ter to any known fact of science.
Science tells us all matter is con-
densed energy. The stuff of whieh
physical bodie$ are composed is the
Limitless Light. It is subject to
the modifications of int~lligence, as
Eliphas Levi told us, almost a bun~
dred years ago. The only objection
which can be made is that most of us
have no first-hand knowledge of any
person who has reached the degree
of attainment which enables him to
integrate or disintegrate his body
at will.
Yet it takes very little research
to discover the existence of well-
attested ac.counts of precisely this
kind of mastery. Nor are they by
any means restricted to the accounts
which are the basis of the Christian
-2-
·_· :.·
~
THE MASTER PATTERN 6
religion. The quantity of evidence
is amazing. Some of it is concerned
with events of comparatively recent
~ceurrence. It goes to show that
mert ~nd wo$en now living on our
planet were living before the gov-
ernment of the United States was
lounded--living in flesh-and-blood
bodies, remember, and by no means to
be confused with those inhabitants
of the astral plane who make them-
selves known ,through mediums.
What is more impo~tant, howeve~,
is the fact that even before any hu-
man being is able to reach this high
grade of attainmeni, he must con-
vince himself that such mastery is
~easonable and po~sible. Here we
approach the difficult topic of
faith. If there is anything more
~isunderstood by mbst persons, it
would be hard to say what it is.
The average person thinks of faith
as being uncritical acceptance of
some religious dogma--of some state-
ment made by persons in authority.
To this idea we may concede a meas-
"" ure of truth. Faith certainly has
at least one of its roots i~ ~on­
fidence irt what somebody says or
writes. At bottom, this is con-
fidence in a personality. We believe
-3-
nm MASTER PATTERN 6
in the man first, and then have faith
in his words. It was the presence
of Jesus. and the impression made by
that presence which aroused the
faith he invariably credited with
his healings. •'Thy faith hath made
thee whole,'' he said, again and ~
again. He understood also that
faith has a personal basis. ''Be-
lieve in me,'' was often on his
1 ip s.
Now, faith which can make ~ body
whole, or lead to any other henefi-
cen t result, is rooted in desire.
~obody ever gets well unless he
really wants to be free from the
limitations of disease.. Nobody ever
makes progress in any sci~nce -0r in
any art unless he has a strong de-
sire to know and do. Thus the path
we are studying in this lesson is
one which leads upward and inward,
from the seventh Sephirah, seat of
the desire nature, to the place of
the Ego in the sixth Sephirah.
One might almost say there are two
kinds of faith, one positive, the
other negative. The essence of true
faith is expectancy, and fear is
inverted faith. Deeper than this,
though some may dispute it, is the
truth that we get e%actly what we
-4-
THE MASTER·PATTERN 6
3' a zr nat 't' whct we want. Extreme
instances make this evident.
You have read of cases of psychic
blindness and psychic· deafness.
They occur often in war. A man goes
blind. He responds to .none of the
usual t~sts. He sees n~thing what-
ever. Yet examination of his eyes
and brain shows no trace of anything
wrong with the physical apparatus of
v1s1on. As a· rule, careful investi-
gation brings to light the fact that
such cases are men who have seen so
many horrors they simply can• t bear
to look at any more.
Psychic deafnes.s is similar. The
writer knew a man whose hearing
became worse and worse as years
passed. Nothing was wrong with his
ears. He lived in a house which was
the scene of daily wranglings and
disputes. His family fought one
another like so many snarling wild
beasts. So he shut himself out from
the unwelcome sounds, and took ref-
uge in books. Eventually he became
stone-deaf, but a divorce and a
change of environment cured him.
These in.stances illustrate a prin-
ciple. Psychic simulations of
disease, functional derangements,
and sometimes actual organic le-
-5-
THE MASmR PATTERN 6
sions, have been traced ~o_the suf-
ferer's repudiation of some aspect
·of his life. To be sick is to at-
tract attention. Everybody, even
the shyset of us, likes to be no-
t iced. To be sick is to escape
responsibilities. We all have days
when we'd like to be rid of our bur-
dens. For adults, whether they know
it or not, to be sick is often the
expression of a subconscious desire
to die. It is a perverted faith--a
faith that by getting out of our
bodies we shall be free from re-
sponsibilities and consequences.
Often this desire is fed by a
sense of failu2e and futility. The
old-fashioned word for this was
''conviction of sin.'' Some very
fantastic doctrines in vogue among
the ''lunatic fringe'' of adherents
of New Thought owe their popularity
to the fact that they serve as men-
tal release from the burden of sin.
The trouble is that these remedies
are worse than the disease. The ir-
rationality of such doctrines is, in
the long run, a greater danger than
the fears they replace.
We need only read the ~~counts of
healings performed by Jesus, in
order to see how often healing and
-6-
1llE MASTER PATTERN6
forrivenes~ go toeether. In the
case of the paralytic, whose illness
was-very likely a conseq~ence of
syphilis, the connection is ol.-vious.
In every case of true spiritual
healicr, there wust be something
~ akin to absolution, or the ailment
will return with greater intensity.
This is w~y we rerrind you SQ often
t_hat your personal conditions and
circumstances are of your own mak-
ing. To put the blame on environ-
ment, to say the fault for misery or
failure lies with others, is to be
caught in a psychological trap. To
say, ':'I made this, and having made
it, I can make its opposite,'' is
essential to right understanding,
and is indispensable- to the achieve-
ment of mastery such as we mentioned
at the beginning of this lesson.
Nor is this all. True as are the
words, '•I made this,'' their value
in aiding us to make better condi-
tions is determined by what we mean
when we say • 'I. ' ' .When we begin to
see what the ••1•• really is, we are
~ ready to effect a permanent cure of
all our disabilities.
To be sure, in saying this we
approach a mystery. A mystery which
nee4s more than the logical pro-
-7.
----'
-
THE MASTER·PATTERN 6
cesses of intellect for its full
apprehension. A mystery indicated,
rather than explained. when we say:
••The Ego, or 'I.' in every one of
us, is our point of personal con~act
with the universal Self.'' Yet
even mere intellectual grasp of this
truth is of some value. For logic
leads to a conclusion which. ~ore
than anything else. has forced ad-
herents of Ageless Wisdom to adopt
various subterfuges to conceal their
real opinions from followers of
traditional orthodoxy.
When one sees that the ••1•• he
means when he says, •'I made this,''
~eaning by ''this'' whatever misery
he suffera, is identical with the
Creator, Preserver and Transformer
of ~he universe. the ''blame'' is
shifted straightway from the suffer-
ing person to God Himself. Openly,
in some passages, and obscurely. in
many others. the Scriptures of the
great religions agree that this is
true.
A good example of open st~tement
is Isaiah's declaration that Jehovah ,-
does everything. evil as well as
good. Much the same thing is said
by the prophet Amos. The same idea
is behind the words: ••cast thy bur-
-8-

THE MASTER PATTERN 6
den on Jehovah, and he sh~ll sustain
thee'' (·Psalm 55: 22L. Jehovah is
responsible for the burden. Stop
trying to carry it yourself. It is
his. Let him have it.
For Qabalists, the Hebrew text of
these words has further meaning.
Their numeral value is 666, the
famous Number of the Beast, which is
also the number of a man, and has
direct connection in occult arith-
metic with the Sephirah Tiphareth,
the Sphere of the Sun, at the center
of the Tree of Life•
.
Yet another example of the arcane
doctrine is the statement that Jesus
was led by the Spirit into the wil-
derness, to be tempted by the devil.
Another, which has occasioned great
pain to many ~arnest Christians is
in the Lord's Prayer--''Lead us not
into temptation.''
How can a good God be author of
temptation? So protest those who
pbject to this phrase in the Lord's
Prayer. The answer is another ques-
tion. How can it be otherwise?
Some of these good souls accept
the Genesis allegory, with its em-
bodied temptation in the shape of
the serpent. They do not know that
-9-
THE MASTER PATTERN 6
Na.chash, the tempter, and Mes.s ia.ch
(Messiah), the redeemer, are Qabal-
istically identical. But is a
teacher evil because we fail at his
examination? La·zy schoolboys often
think so, yet they are mistaken. ls
a psychologist evil because he de-
vises tests which reveal tendencies
toward self-deception or dishonesty
in some who take them? Of course
not, though it is common ~or the
subjects of such tests to get very
angry with the psychologist who is
trying his best to help them. Our
rise from the mineral kingdom to
this moment has been a series of
such tests. During this age-long
evolution the only Actor has been
the one Ego, the Christos seated in
the human heart. When we realize
this, we put the burden where it
truly h elongs.
We do more than this. We prepare
ourselves to understand that there
never has been a real failure. Our
worst sins have put us in situations
where the healing power can operate.
They serve to educate us. They have
their uses. The better we under-
stand this, the less room is there
in our minds for any wish to fix
blame, to find scapegoats for con-

condemnation has been exorcised from
their minds.
Let us recapitulate. Whatever men
call ''evil'' is as certainly the.
work of God as is what they are
pleased to call ''good.'' We all
kno.w that fashions in "good'' and
''evil'' alter with the times, as
with geography. Being the work of
God, Who is both omniscient and
omnipotent, no tiniest part of the
process of manifestation (of which
all human actions are parts) can be
tinged with failure. There is no
blame to be fixed, no condemnation to
be made. What'we have mistakenly
believed to be an adversary is a
power working always for our good.
Man has no enemy but ignorance.
Thus it is written that the last
enemy to be overcome is death. To
overcome anything is to bring it
over to your side, t~ make an ally
of it. This was not understood by
the makers of the Versailles treaty.
The Germans were punished, as being
responsible for the first World War,
-1.1-
THE MASTER PATl'ERN 6
when nationals of all countries were
in some measure responsible.
This time we must do better, but
sometimes it appears.that we have no
real awareness of the true causes of
the rise of Hitler and Mussolini to
power. Fascist totalitarianism sur-
vives in Argentina, Spain and Portu-
gal. ''Communist'' totalitarianism
is represented by the Soviet and her
satellites. The present state of
affairs in the United States clearly
indicates a strong tendency toward
an American totalitarianism which,
in power, would be no less brutal
than the worst of Hitler's, or Mus-
solini's, or Stalin's ''purges.''
There is, moreover, another form of
authoritarian totalitarianism, one
of the ''kingdoms of this world,''
yet international in scope and in-
fluence, which would, if it could,
prohibit all such writings as these,
and, wherever possible, as the eu-
phemism puts it, would ''liquidate''
both writers and readers.
Only blind fools will underesti-
mate the dangers of totalitarianism,
in whatever forms it presents it-
self. Only blinder fools will think
of it as an unmixed ''evil,'' to be
feared, hated, suppressed and wiped
-12-
THE MASTER PATTERN 6
out by force. No, this ''evil'' has
to be overcome, brought over to our
side. So long as we fear it, or are
under the impression .that the way to
deal with it is to kill off everyone
who favors it, we are in error.
~ This is riot the place to elaborate
this particular theme. But there is
a principle involved which, when ap-
plied, will lead to a peaceful solu-
tion of the problem. The One Self
acts through totalitarians just as
truly as it does through persons who
are ~ore or less inspired by the
ideals of the Founders of the United
States. When somebody begins to ask
what makes totalitarians, and begins
to study the deeper drives behiDd
all such political m~vements, then
we may expect to find in those very
drives just what is needed to make
our long-cheri$hed dieam of democ-
racy come true ..
As for death, we need first of all
to see how useful it is. Our lives
are founded on the passing away of
outworn forms,. to make room for bet-
ter on~s. This is no idealistic
philosophizing. Hard-headed busi-
ness men r~cogniz~ and use this
principle. Here is a quota~ion from

ancl for our refusal to look this
greatest of our problems in the
-14-
TIIE MASTER PATIERN 6
face. Like every other problem, it
is an opportunity. Like every other
veiled opportunity, it puzzles us
because we are ignorant. It fright-
ens us, and we refuse to give it
careful consideration. When we
study it, we understand it, and our
fear vanishes.
One of the worst mistakes we make
is that of thinking of death as be-
ing something ahead of us. We hope
to postpone it. We dread it, be-
cause we think it is outside the
range of our daily experience. It
never occurs to most of us that
de~th has been part of that daily
experjence, from the moment we drew
our first breath. Death is an in•
eradicable part of the m¥stery of
life. It is not even the Great Adven-
ture. On the contrary, it is a.
daily commonplace, so familiar, so
much a part of us, that we never
ha•e identified it.
Among vai-ious computations of the
number of cells in the human body,
no two agree; but there is full
agreement as to the fact that about
one-third of them perish daily in
order that we may carry on the day's
work and play. During the night,
while we sleep, their places are
-15-
THE MASTER PATTEBN 6
filled by a_new army, ready to die
tomorrow. Yet many of us hang on so
hard to our beloved status quo that
we do not eliminate the useless
corpses of yesterday•s generation of
cells. Little by little, we turn
our bodies into cemeteries. Instead
of letting the dead cells goe, we
hold fast to them, and pack them
away in our joints, to produce the
painful symptoms of arthritis; store
them in our eyes to harden the eye-
balls and dim the sight; embalm them
in the linings of our arteries,
which should be more elastic than
virgin rubber, to set up the condi-
tions necessary for weakening these
channels of the life-stream.
Behind this is a mental condition.
It is the desire to keep ourselves,
today, just what we were yesterday.
It is the desire, incidentally,
which made World War II inevitable.
It is the desire which expressed it-
self in the military policy of Bis-
marck and Prussia, in the building
of the useless Maginot Line, in the
folly of American isolationism. For
nations, as for men and women, it is
fatal.
This nonsense takes all manner of
ridiculous forms. We need to real-
-16-
THE MASTER PATl'ERN 6
ize that they are ridiculous, and
laugh hard at them. When we know
what d~ath is, we .cannot fear it,
and it becomes our ally. The very
processes in our bodies which bring
them ~o untimely gr~ves are those
11' which, in the bodies of the unusual
persons mentioned at the beginning
of this lesson, bring about their
extraordinary longevity.
. It is not that the d~ath process
is n~llified, ~r counteracted by
something else. On the contrary, it
is that what has negative and degen-
~rative manifestations in physical
tlisease and death is what members of
th~ better informed minority use
positively to bring about physical
regeneration.
To accomplish this, we must change
our desires. Instead of wishing to
keepourselves and our circumstances
unchanged, we mu.st welcome change.
We must desire perpetual and pro-
gressive transformation, instead of
wishing to embalm ourselves in some
set form of existence which we be-
lieve to be ~ood.
Observation.will enable us to
become so familiar with the fact of
~'dying-daily'' that all fear of
-17-
THE MASTER PATfERN 6
what so evidently works for our
good will be banished. Then ~e
shall· see clearly what Tarot Key 13
declares by its strange symbolism.
It is this. What men call death is
the framework of all existence, is
what makes possible all mutations of
human activity.
Miracles are effected by this
change in our outlook. Old men and wo-
men have renewed themselves, without
any nonsense of transplanted goat or
monkey glands.
Yet this is a great secret, care-
fully preserved by those who know
it. We have not revealed the se-
cret. What we have done is t-0 show
you how to discover the secret for
yourself. When you do, you will
keep it close. Not because you will
be a miser of knowledge, for those
who know are anything but that. A
better reason counsels extreme cir-
cumspection as to the revelation of
the mystery. The secret involves
something which would be dangerous
in the hands of the unprepared.
Let us be even more explicit. At
this very moment there is available
enough specific knowledge to enable
any person, no matter what sort of
fool or tyrant he might he, to main-
-18-
11fE MASTER PATTERN 6
tain his physical existence many
decades beyond the present average.
Knowledge which might be used, as
most of us employ knowledge of elec-
tricity, wi~hout any real under-
standing of the principles behind
it. To give such knowledge to the
world would be to perpetuate this
gen~ration of mankind. Who dares to
be responsible for prolonging unduly
the lives of so many moral idiots,
so many greedy money-grubbers, so
many dictators, so many blindly am-
bitious men and women? Be very sure
that they who have this knowledge
will guard it securely.
~ Our part is to help you put your-
self in a position to receive it.
The first step is to do some thinking
of your own. Think about what makes
bodies die. Think about what makes
them live. Give special thought to
how they get here. This lesson is
full of plain hints. Take t.hem•
. Begin to examine your desires.
Get rid of the desire to ''stay
pu~,'' whatever forms it may take.
Substitute the desire to make your-
self more and more useful to the One
Life, Soon you will rid yourself of
fear. Turn over every detail of
your personal existence to guidance

Remember, the doctrine of the

·LESSON SEVEN
was the ••son'' of the Egyptian Holy
Family. Moreover, Khoor, or Horus,
as the Greeks called him, was said
to have been conceived by Isis after
the death of his father, Osiris.
Thus Horus was believed by the
Egyptians to be ''conceived by the
Holy Ghost,'' and born of a virgin
mother.
The central figure in the legend
of Freemasonry, Hiram Abin, was
named Khurum in Hebrew, and there is
good reason for thinking he repre~
sents the same Khoor who was vener~
ated b~c the Egyptians. For the name
Khurum is a merging of two Hebrew
nouns.: The. first, Khoor, means 46 to
be splendid, to be dazzling white,
to shine, to be noble, •' The second
is Ram, a very ancient word, derived
from Sanskrit, signifying ·,•to be
high.:'' Thus Khurum (Hiram) means
..11'
••the noble splendor on, high, • • and r
this is a designation for the sun~
god Horus. According to the Bible
story about Hiram Abiff, his mother

was, like Isis, a widow, of the·
tribe- of Naphtali, which tribe cor-
responds to the zodiacal sign Virgo, ·
the Virgin.· Thus, like the mothers'
of Krishna and Horus, Khurum's moth-
er is associated with the idea of
virginity.·
In Christian symbolism, Clirist is
often represented by the monogram
·Chi-Rho, which combines two Greek
letters representing the sounds
.which, in Egyptian hieroglyphs,
spell Khoor.: Thus from India, Egypt
and Greece, be.fore Christianity as
we know it was formulated, come tes-
timonies· to the existence of a sin..

this.: Among other things, St- Aug"
ustine must have had this in mind
when he declared the true religion

tion of the world, and only began to
be called ''Christian'' after the
time of Jesus.
The Western School says the same_
All its members are Ch:r istians. In
this, the Western School is distinct
from the TransgHimalayan Brotherhood
which has done so much to awaken the
world to occult truth,
The Western School holds that,
just as the Wright Brothers were the
first to fly a machine heavier than

perfect the incandescent lamp, so
was [Jesus of Nazareth the fir st to
arrive at perfect identification of
his personal consciousness with the

realization of the perfect union of (""""

thermore, the occult doctrin~ of the
Western School is that Jesus of

the last of a series of avatars, or
incarnations of a high human soul.
This soul was the core of the per~
sonality which appeared in other
periods· of· history as Melchizedek,
as Krishna, as Horus, and later,as
Hermes· Trismegistus.•.
Myths were woven round these per=
sonalities, but they were· also real
men, who were successive incarna=
t ions of a single soul.: In its
earlier incarnations, this soul
attained an increasing awareness of
the true nature of the ONE EGO.: Its
final, perfect identification with
that EGO was made in the life of
Jesus Christ,

easy to reconcile the identification
of Jesus with the Logos, or WORD"

clearly that though Jesus was the
first to achieve complete identificaD
tion with the archetypal M\N, he was
also quite aware of the limitations

Today we have airplanes the
Wright Brothers coul~ never have·
imagined, when they flew at Kitty··
hawk. Our electric lamps are better
than the first one made by Edison,
with its life of eight hours. Even
so, it is possible for the ONE EGO,
working· through men and women fully
aware of their identity with it, to
effect changes in human life,· in
human society, and in human environ°
ment which could never have been
made by Jesus in his own day, and
which may never have entered his
mind as he walked the length and
breadth of Palestine on his great
mission.·
On the other hand, Jesus, the
man, gained full, conscious immor~
tality as the result of identifying
himself with the Christt the ONE EGO.:
Thus there never has been a moment
of time since he began his ministry

more perfect union with the ONE EGO,
we enter also l:!tO a more pe1 f E::ct

union with his mind we become par-
takers in a still higher ufd.on, his
union with the Indivisible On~,

This doctrine of the Wes~ern
School was veiled by the enigmas and
cryptic utterznces of the Rosicru-

gory, Fama Fraternitatis, they told.
the story of the "'founding•• of

the more recondite relationships of

the number of Chokmah is 2, and this

that the path of Beth is- distinct

is truly prophe~ic .. Every Magus is
a seer and a prophet. Not always
does !he personal man understand the

prophetic writings cai;efully, and
you will find evidence of this.. Yet
there. is no lack of certitude about
the vision itself, They who see

LESSON ELEVEN
When you have completed the
recitation of The Pattern, close
your eyes, and use your imagination
to help you realize that hundreds
of other persons are keeping this
same quiet hour with you. They
seem to be absent, but in truth
they are with you, and you with
them.· Perhaps only a few are known
to you Yet, all over the world,
men and women whose aims are essen
. tially the same as yours are doing
just what you are
All over the world, they are
entering into the inward life which
transcends the limits of physical
time and space Many have no
official connection with the Build
ers of the Adytum. Yet they are
engaged in the same work, are in
touch with the same sources of en·
lightenment and power, are dedicat
ed to the same great objectives,
are inspired by the same ideals,
Before long, your practice
should make you aware of your inner

contact with this wide-flung com-
pany If you have few personal
friends with whom to share your oc-
cult interests, your practice will
convince you that you are never
really alone.
Possibly you are already aware
that some particular person is
helping you. Some know their
''guardian angels-'' Others do
not. Yet there is not one of us
who is not under the loving super--
vision of somebody wiser than we,-
On this account, after devoting a
little iime to intensifying your
awareness of the Great Companion
ship, turn your thought toward your
special director,·
Whether or not you know the per
son does not matter. Nor is it
advisable to indulge curiosity,· Do
not speculate on your director's
personal identity, The main point
to keep in mind is that·you really
do have such a guide, who is not a
discarnate personality, not a being

:By the very nature of your human
existence, you are receptive to
direction from stronger, wiser
better minds than your own, Wise
men and women never coerce, never
interfere By the very nature of
man, those persons who have a more
vivid and definite awareness of the
ONE EGO do, by this realization,
become broadcasters of power and
wisdom to others not so far ad-
vanced,
Some of us establish a strong
personal contact with our direc-
tors This seems to be the excep-
t ion, rather than the rule. Such
intense personal relations should
never be sought,· They may even
become obstacles to balanced,
harmonious development. Remember,

greater power, bring them into re-

from the one Central Source, It is
contact with the latter which is
basically valuable
On the other hand, only very
advanced persons establish direct
~ contact with th~ EGO of all human
ity, the Christ. This EGO is truly
the One Mediator between humanity
and the.cosmic SELF,. the Father of
all~ It is the spiritual sun of
our lives; but the radiance of that
sun is too bright for the average
mind, darkened by ignorance, preju-
dice and superstition.· Nor may any
of us lay clai~ to being wholly
free from this darkness. So it re-
mains true for us all that, whether
we recognize it or not, our awaken°
ing, and our progress along the
Path,-are in large measure due to
some actual person whose superior
attainment includes his power to
aid and guide us.
Thus, when you have finished your
endeavor to realize that you are
part of the Great Companionship,

of ·the desire nature cescends into
Yesod, ~he &eld ~f ~h~ automatic
consciousness.;,
What we realty want is what we
me~itate upon, and our mediiation
goes on just below the surface of
consciousness, all da~ long, and
through ~he »ight. Thus subcon-
sciousness is continually influenced
by iur ~esires, and unless the
desires, be in harmony with our con-
sci•usly formulated purposes, the
latter will never come to· fruition.
Again, the channel of the letter
Qophr the Co~poreal ln.t.elligence
represented ,by Ke.y .18, shows that
our desires tend always to modify
ou.r physical bod~es. Desire is th~
pattern of embodiment, and desire
force is what determines structure.

In this lesson little is give~ in
the way of set exercises, because
what you need is grasp of the prin-
ciples involved. Study the lessons
of this series which deal with the
seventh, eighth, ninth and tenth
Sephiroth. This will aid you in
gaining right unders·tanding .of th~
nature of the work before you. Then ~
use your own ingenuity to appl~
these principles to your daily prac-
tice.
The main thing is to make your
practice part of your whQle waking
a.ctivity. Do this, and THE MA$TER
PATTERN will enable you to shape
your 1 ife closer to ybur innermost
heart's desire, and in more accurate
conformity to the purpo.se. of your
central Will-to-good.

Seph.irot.h.. Another .dj.~gr4lll, showing
them as cQric~ntri.c circles. is given
in many o-f ·-the older Qabal.istic

The cent.ral cirCle is Kether, ·and
then the· sµccessive concentric' cir..
des· a're att·rihuted ta- the remaining
- Sephi-rot-h. This is .made• clear by
the text in th•.· upper part of each
·of -the ten circles. ·
The circle corresponding to Mal.
kuthis divided into•fou"r parts, and
these ~ear the names of the fo~r
elements, and also· ~he names of the
kingdoms of nature corresponding toe
those elements.
-To man is attributed the element
of fi·re; because man is the only be-
in:g who can utilize this elemen"t, .
dreaded by all other ereatu-res on
this planet. e:iu:ept a few types of
domesticated animals, wh4 have -lost
their fear of fire through associa-
tion with man, without gainingi

Our modern method of extracting

The center of the· peTsonal system
is·. t'he EGO in 'l'iphareth. Thus: the
constitution ~·r p.erso·nality is rep-
resented by the -concentric dotted
circles sur·rounding the small circle
representing the· !goic· Body., 'Note·
that there are ''ni> cire-les· ·repJ;e.;.

·There are th~·refor~ severi vehicles
indica te-d by this diagram: 1. n:e
Causal Body, corre.sponding to Chai·
ah, the Life.force; 2.· The Buddhic
Body. Y-ehicle· of the Divine Soui;
3. The Egoic Body, vehicle of Ruach;
4. The Desire Body; 5. The Mental
Body; 6. The Astral Body; 7. The
Physical Body.
Some occult systems speak also ·of
an ethe'ric body, but the Qabalistic
s·~hooh hold that this is narmally
O"Jte of the subtler aspects of the
physical body, and d~ not count it
as a separa·te vehicle. ·
This diagram shows clearly how the
one Cosmic SELF, Yekhidah, is the
single SELF of ~ll pers~nalitie~.

In this scheme, the personality sys-
·tem is repre.sented by small circle-s,.
strung along a tadius -of th~ grea.t
system of circles, No matter how
many such radii there may be, and an
infinite number is possibl-, every
one of them beg_ins at the center of
Kether. Thus Yekhidah, though it is
one and indivisible, may be, and is, ~
the Cosmic SELF o1 every personality or
system, how~ver many there may be.
We have purposely coafin-ed our re-
marks on this diagram to jus-t enough
to mak• it intelligible. Taken in
coajunction with the lessons of this
co-U·rse, it should-repay careful con•
sideratiQn wi&h ~ great deal of
light on the coniltitutfon of man. An
elaborate explanation would rob you
of the benefits to be derived from
making a deep s~udy of this figure.
