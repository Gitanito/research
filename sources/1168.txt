SHORT H IST O R Y OF THE A R T.-
IN the year 1785, Dr. De Mainanduc
pubUfbed his propolids to the ladte/, for
eflabl Ihing an Hygean fociety, or fociety
of health, ro be incorporated with that al­
ready eilablifbed at Paris. In this paper
the Doctor informs us, that Mr. Meffmer
revived the Icience of Animal Magnetifm
from the obfeurity of the antients; that
whi e he was in France, it being the gene­
ral topic of converfation, he wilhed to be­
come acqu inted with the art, and offered
that gentleman two hundred guineas for
his iecret, but had the mortification ro be
refuied; but this event proved at laft very
fortunate for hur>, for it procured him the
acquaintance of a Doflor D ’Ellbn, that
this dodlor being oppofed bv the faculty
of France applied co tne magidrates for
commifiioners to examine his methodof

treatment, and to report what they fliould
obferve worthy of notice: the commif-
fioners, though'men of perfpicuity, of
judgmenr, and. aflifted by the philolo-
phical Dr. Franklin, made nocwitiiltand-
ing.a very unfavourable report.
The fubjedt gained ground, although
perlecuted and accufed of being the ef-
fedl of magic, and began to rile under the
indefatigable labours of Dr. DT lfon, and
a few others, from the confufed date in
which Mr. MefiTmer the reviver had left it j
inlomuch, that it became praftifed in al-
moft every town in France. The Swe-
9
denborg doftrines aflifting it not a little,
it fpread wider, and Dr. De Mainanduc
brought it to tingland in 1787.
Dr. De Mainanduc is a man mid-wife,
and this eaftly accounts for his firll ad­
drefling the ladies on the fubjeft of this
becoming falhionable practice ; and as foon
as twenty ladies fliould join their names
to form a lociety, the day fliould be ap­
pointed for the firft meeting at his houfe,
where they paid fifteen guineas each,which
was to include the expence of exhibition and
treatment. Mr. Mefliner’s theory, though
the original one was now laid afide, and
Dr. de Mainanduc went further into the
fcience, and added, as we are informed,
dignity.
W O N D E R S OF
a n i m a l m a g n e t i s m . 5
dignity to the art, for the former’s method
favoured much of fuperftitious juggling
in natural things.
It is true, that want of proper (kill in
the kno ledge of difeafes, and o f the
means of conducting a patient through a
crifis, was the caufe of fome objections
from inch as could not diftinguifh between
the art and the operator, but blamed the
former for the blunders of the latter.
Dr. de Mainanduc had fuch fuccefs that
he role ins courle of inftruCtion to twenty-
five guineas, and fometime after to one
hundred and fifty for the whole courfe,
with a N. B. at the bottom of his propo-
fals, exprcffing, that the fubfcription was
to be paid when the name was given in.
For treatment and confultation from one
guinea to fifteen, and each month’s treat­
ment to be paid for at its commencement.
Magnetifts multiplied upon the world
in an incredible manner, and the fcicnce
ieemed to have arrived at a great degree
of perfection. In 1785, Mr. Meffmer
had taught his fecret to three hundred
pupils, and Dr. d’Elfon had inftruCted one
hundred and fixty phyficians before the
clofe of 1786, befides fome hundreds of
unprofeflional difciples; to which might
be added an incredible number of perfons
B 3 who
6 W O N D E R S OF
who either from their own Rudies, or from'
inftruCtiens given them by others, not only
acquired a knowledge of, but praCtifed
this method, lo that as early as 1786, the
number of thefe practitioners was infinite,
and Ipread the character of the art far and
wide, but we are forry to fay, without
equally railing it in the fcale of perfec­
tion.
It cannot be expeCted in a brief treatife
like this, to enumerate the tenth part of
the profefiors of abilities j we fhall only
fet down here a few in alphabetical order.
Mr. Cue, Mr. Holloway, Mr. Louther-
bourg, Mr. Parker, Mrs. Prat, and the
American Dr: Yeldal of Moorfields, have
been the inoft famous, and likewife the
molt generous and dilinterefted in per­
forming that art upon objects who had not
the ability to reward their labours in the
manner they deferved.
Magnetifm was now at its height. Mrs.
Prat informs us that 3000 perlons have
waited at one time, to gain admiflion at
Mr. de Loutherbourg’s at Hammerfmith,
and file very juftly complains of fome per-
fons felling their tickers, for two, three,
and even five guineas each.
The progrtfs of Magnetifm was at
this time (1789) much accelerated by
Mr.

Mr. Holloway’s* lcflures, which he read
for a reafonabie premium to a considerable
number of pupils, and it is laid he has
realifed a fortune of two ihoufand pounds.
Some time fince, he publilhed propofals
for a fcientific treatife on this lubje<5t, but
his difciples remonftrating upon the in-
jutlice of publishing to the world what
they had paid a valuable confideration for,
he generoufly withdrew the fchemej and
here we conclude the hiftory, though in
the courfe of the work we fhall give fuch
anecdotes as fhall iiluftrate the fubjefl to
our readers, and conclude the hiftory with
obferving, that thofe who wifh to become
prpficients, (hould read Agrippa’s fourth
book, Digby on Sympathy, Bafil Valen­
tine’s laft will, Fludd’s Molaie Philo*

Helmont’s Chymiftry, Maxwell’s works,
Paracell’us, Gadbury, Salmon, Culpeper,
Lilly, Coley, Sanders, the works of Dr.
Henry More, Dr. Norris’s pamphlets on
Divine Love, and many others, which
their own enquiries will lead them to the
knowledge of.
* Mr. Holloway's terms were never more than five
guineas, and the learner’s promife, neither directly,
nor indirectly, to reveal the fec.ee. Yet ilrange as it
may appear, iiis true, io,oool. under bond have been
demanded and given'!

ANIMAL MAGNETISM EXPLAINED.
T H E doftrine of a vacuum has long
been exploded with the fables of antiquity.
Modern philofophy has admitted a plenum
or tiniverfal principle of fluid matter
which occupies all /pace j and that as all
bodies moving in the world, abound with
pores, this fluid matter introduces itfclf
through the interllices and returns back­
wards and forwards, flowing through one
body by the currents which iflue there­
from to another, as in a magnet, which
produces that phenomenon we call Animal
Magnetilm. This fluid conlifts of fire,
air, and fpirit, and like all other fluids
tends to an equilibrium, therefore it is
eafy to conceive how the efforts which the
bodies make to each other produce animal
cleftricity, which in faft is no more than
the efFeft produced between two bodies,
one of which has more motion than the
other j a phenomena ferving to prove that
the body which has molt motion commu­
nicates it to the other, until the medium of
motion becomes anequilibrium between the
two bodies, when this equality produces
animal
A N I M A L M A G N E T I S M . 9
animal eleCtricity. But equality and reci­
procity of motion produce Animal Mag-
netifin, while it is the purpofe of nature
that animal eleCtricity fhould exift only to
produce (as tinder does fire' Animal Mag-
netifm; thus the former ends where the
latter begins. Philofophers have com­
pared the human body to an eleCtrical ma­
chine, they have fuppofed the arms the
conductors, the fingers the pointers, which
anyone may experience by trying. Hold
the fingers of both hands for lbme time
towards the patients pericardium, and
you may eafily perceive all the effects of
eleftricity on the invalid’s body.
Continue the motion till the electrical
fluid begins to be more agitated, and it
will foon flow with greater rapidity from
your fingers, but this will only be in pro­
portion as your mental faculties are en­
gaged in the work. Earneltnefs to exe­
cute the utmoft that your abilities will per­
form, is the only method that can be re­
commended, nor can any further direc­
tions be given towards accomplishing the
bufiiKls, than juft to obferve, that, as na­
ture does not aCt beyond herfelf, yours
mull be the endeavours to work up the
plaftic powers of fancy to a proper pitch,
and this you will foon be able to perceive
by
IO W O N D E R S OF
by the degree of fit or crifis, the patient
is put into. But if the treatment does
not produce the alteration required, you
may depend upon it, his continuance is
entirely owing to an obftinate mind and
mode of realoning, for a man may be
foolifh enough to withftand the ftrongeft
conviftion that can be brought againft
him, and in fuch a cafe, his reftoration
can never be brought about by the means
of this fcience.
Notwithltanding the cloud and myf-
lery that has been call: over this fcience,
to keep it concealed from the multitude,,
and great fums have been given for the
knowledge of it, it has ftill been known
and prailifed by eminent men inevery age.
Not to recur to more remote times, Sir
Kenelm Oigby knew the fecret, and his
fympaxhetic powder was no other than a
vehicle to convey the power. The-dTen-
tial efficacy of the royal touch in ferophu-
lous cafes is intirely owing to Animal
Magnetilm, and a penny barber can as
well do away the evil, as a fovereign on
his throne. Valentine Greatacre, the
ftroaker, performed in London feveral
cures to the altonifhment of many of the
faculty, nor could they account how they
were done, any more than the Laris com-
mifiioners in what manner modern magne-
tical operators affedted their patients.
In the following pages, the different
inodes of treatment, with proper exam­
ples, are laid down in as plain a manner
and in as few words as the fubjedt will ad­
mit of, and fome few cafes are reported.
The author of this little treatife, is one
of the few inftahces of exception from the
general myfterious oath of fecrecy; yet
he has the happinefs of being fully in-
ftrudted in this wonderful fyftem, by a
profeffor of the firft rate abilities, and
who has treated, many days, more than a
hundred diurnally, and with great fuccefs
in many inltances. And as he was not
taught it under any reftridtion, he can,
therefore with the utmoft freedom and
pleafure, communicate to others what he
has received, and he doubts nor, but any
perfonof even a common capacity, by at­
tending clofely to the rules here laid down,
may become as ufeful an operator, as
thofe that have paid fifty guineas, or a
larger fum for their knowledge* But let
not young beginners be difcouraged ; let
them perfevere and exert themfelves in the
uniform pradtice of it, and they will foon
find fuch inftances of fuccefs as will doubt-
lefs give them fpirits to go on, and en-

ence.
In the enfuing chapter we lhall lay
down the necefiary rules and directions
for treating patients in either commoh or
extra cafes.

MODE OF TREATMENT.
ACCORDIN G to Dr. De Mainanduc,
it is within the capacity of every one to
become a perfeft mafter of this molt ef-
fential fcience, and what is mod wonder­
ful, without a teacher too, for as every
branch of fcience proceeds from princi­
ples, the elements of the corpufcular phi—
lolophy evidently evince the exiftence of
Animal Magnetifm. It requires no me­
dical underftanding to profefs it with fuc-
cefs, and the knowledge of difeafes is not
necefiary to couduct a perfon through a
crifis. Mrs. Pratt has given us a lift of
cures performed without a medicine:
though Mr. Loutherburg has often con-
defeended to preferibe to his patients.
Mr. Cue is very much againft the faculty,
infomuch that he recommends rubbing
your-
yourfelf all over with a coarfe cloth every
morning, to which he adds, drink no fpi-
rituous liquors. Dr. Graham in his lec­
ture on generation gave the fame advice.
It is from analogy and aflociation that
magnetifm derives its chief origin. T ho’
animal magnetifm was from the begin­
ning of the world, it has been known and
praCtifed but by few, and loft and forgot­
ten alternately, from the time of Adam to
the prefent day. Solomon, the wife king
of the Jews, knew that difeafes might be
mitigated and cured, by exciting parti­
cular affections and paflions of the mindj
and Ariftotle fufpeCts that hyfterical cafes
may be produced to a dangerous degree
of convulfion j now this evidently proves
the exiftence of fomething beyond the
line of medical power to remove. Too
intenfe ftudy will produce epileptic fits,
which are certainly affeCtions of the mind,
and, which cannot be removed in the
courfe of common or fpecial medical
practice.

MODE OF TREATMENT FARTHER CONSI­
DERED.
IF you would wifh to treat patients
■ w
ith fuccefs, obl'erve the following direc­
tions.
Firfl. Be as much abjiracted as pof-
fible; put every other thought and idea
out of your mind, and feek to enter in,
and for a time take pofiefiion of the fub-
jeft, which you are about to treat.
Secondly. Let your mind be filled with
affection and benevolence towards the iub-
jeft that you are treating. Let all the
energy of your foul be fixed on the relief
of your patient, and generally fuccefs will
follow.
Thirdly. Let there be a confhnt in­
tention within you; keep up 'an idea of
the complaint you wifh to remove; be
earneftly defirous to give all the afliftancc
in your power towards the relief of the
fubje£h Kindnefs, pity, conftant inten­
tion and companion, are great promoters
of fuccefs in this matter. Strange as this
may feem, you will find it true, and thofe
who
A N I M A L M A G N E T I S M . rS
who have confidered the amazing powers
of fympathy and antipathy will eafily l'ee
it reafonable.
Fourthly. Exert the ftrong internal fa­
culty of volition, or our will, towards the
fut|eCt that you are called to treat; deter­
mine to do good to the difeafed; and vcu
will find oftentimes a ftrange connection
with thofe whom you are treating.— This
is produced by the incorporation of the
atmofpheres, and as each body has an at-
mofphere around it, they have a ftronger
power over each other. And as the prin­
ciples of this lcience, are in themfelves
very powerful. the more they are combined
and exerted, the greater will be.their force,
and the more conlpicuous the effects of the
treatment w.ll be.
If the power of the mental faculties in
men were known, they would be furprized
at themfelves; but thel'e powers lie latent
till they are proved by fcnfible operations
really to exiflr. It has been frequently ob-
lerved, that when perfons are fpoken of
' they are near, and loon come into fight,
and when you think on abfent perfons, it
is often found they are at the fame time aa
earnellly engaged in thinking on you.
Many inftances of the amazing power of
fympathy mull have been manifelied to all
B 2 atten-
W O N D E R S OF
attentive obfejvers. Confider this, and
apply it with all your might to the prefent
fubjeft, according to the above directions.
Having explained briefly the principles
of .this wonderful fcience, 1 fhall next con­
fider the modes of treatment. Different
people have different modes ; but I need
only mention two, as they are enough for
the purpofe. One is by the lcience itlelf
without any motion of the hands; this is
an act of the mind, and the ftronger the
mental powers are in any operator, and the
more they are exerted, the more effectual
the treatment will be.
In .this method you muff be quite ab-
ftra'ffed, be abfent from all other things j
place your thoughts intenfely upon the
fubjeCt on which you wiffi to operate. Let
the intention of your mind be kept to the
work as cloielv as poffible, accompanied
with the utmoll exertions of defire, or the
fttongeff powers of your will and affec­
tions. Put forth all your internal powers
in the moll energic manner. It is afionifh-
ing what fenfible effects will refult from
this operation, even fo as fometimes to
raife a hand from a table. But the fub-
je«5t upon whofn you would make your
16
trial, Ihould be one who will make no re-
liltance, nor drive againft you.
In whatever cafe you are called to ope­
rate, have a proper confidence j and do not
be difcouraged if your expectations fhould
not be fully anl'wered at firft, but perfe-
vere, and make frequent trials; for in this,
as in every thing elfe, it is a good rule
that practice makes perfetl, and the more
you enter into the fpirit of the fcience, and
the more frequently and earneftly you
praCtife it, the more likely you will be to
have both confidence and fuccefs.
The other method of treating, is by
tiling the hands according to fcience; for
both mult concur together. The motion
of the hands may be ufeful to keep up the
attention of the operator, and give a kind
of force to the mind; befides, the fingers
are a kind of natural conductors, by which
the effluvia is conveyed from one body to
another ; and you will perceive the com­
plaints of the patients by your fingers,,
iooner than by any other means.
When you move your hands properly
and fervently, with full intention, and fer­
vent wilhes to do good to the patient, ex­
erting all your faculties to produce the moll
lalutary effeCts, you will foon perceive the
eonlequences, both in yourfelf, and chofe
B j whom.
A N I M A L M A G N E T I S M . 17
whom you treat. Some will be much
fooner affe&ed than others, and much more
fenfibly. The patient will frequently feel
a kind of warm and glowing fenl'ation, un­
der the treatment, though fometimes the
contrary l'enfation will be perceived ; and
the operator will often find his hands and
fingers feized with a fenfation of heat, pain,
numbnefs, or pricking, as when any part
is afieep, and frequently by the power of
fympathy, he will feel pain in the lame
part of his body as the patient has it.
It is neceflary now to mention fome of
thofe diforders to which the body is fub-
jedt, and which this operation is moft likely
to remove.
Many difeafes at firfl: arife from ob-
fiructions, and the want of a proper circu­
lation of the blood and juices. Perfpira-
tion l'uddenly checked produces colds, and
thefe often lay the foundation of incurable
diforders, as confumptions, coughs, &c.
This fcience is of great ufe in removing
all thefe obftructions, efpecially in their be­
ginning. When either by the complaint
of the patienr, or your own fympathetic
feelings, you perceive an obftrudtion, and
find where it lies, apply all the ftrength
and power of your mind and will to the
part affedled, with the utmoft energy that
you are matter o f: Let all your mental
powers
IS W O N D E R S OF
powers be engaged therein, according to
the foregoing rules. The diforders of
the bead deferve a particular place here;
for all that are affe&ed with any com­
plaint in that part of the body, muft be
fenfiblethatwhen the bead is fick, theZ>^r/
is faint, and the whole frame difordered.
The head ach, is frequently caufed by a
foul ftomach; in that cafe it will be pro­
per to treat the ftomach moft, moving
the hands up and down, by which the
bile will be agitated, and the patient fen-
fibly relieved. When this pain is caufed
by obftrudtions in the head, that part muft
be chiefly treated; and that treatment will
moft commonly give immediate eafe, and
help nature te overcome the complaint.
Deafnefs, is a troublefome complaint;
and thofe who are affli&ed with ir, are
generally very defirous of being relieved ;
let not fuch defpair; for there have been
feveral inftances where deafnefs has been
cured, after fome years continuance, by
frequent treatments. Great care fhould be
oblerved left the party Ihould take cold
loon after the treatment, and thus the dis­
order be made worle inftead of being rea­
dily cured. This was the cafe of a young
lady not far from London, who had from
her childhood been inclining to deafnefs,
A N I M A L M A G N E T I S M . 19.
]» W O N D E R S OP
and of lace years was very deaf indeed.
She was cured I'o far as to hear che leaft
noife, and was quite difturbed at the con-
veri'ation which before the could not hear,
and this continued fome weeks : but by
taking cold, her deafneis returned as bad
as before.
Tn order to treat for this complaint, let
the patient be placed at a little diftance
with the ear inclining a fmall degree to­
wards you; think intensely on the part af-
fedted, as if you would have your thoughts
or ideas enter into and pal's through the
head; moving your hands backwards and
forwards, pointing to the part affedted.
Continue this treatment for fome time,
and generally good effects will follow.
* The locked jaw is a dreadful and dan­
gerous complaint, by which many have
loft their lives; yet this has been lately
removed from a young lady in London,
by the treatment, when the phyfician
judged her utterly incurable.
The firft time the was treated, foon af­
ter the treatment began, Ihe was able to
open her mouth fo as to receive the han­
dle of a tea-fpoon, and prefently after the
bowl, though before lhe was not able to
open her teeth in the fmalleft degree. She
was afterwards treated till the took in the
handle
%
A N I M A L M A G N E T I S M . 21
•
handle and then the bowl of a larger
fpoon, and open her mouth wide enough
.for any -ptirpol'e ; and the whole within
the fpace of twenty minutes.
In order to treat a pcrion in this terri­
ble diforder, place the patient before you,
and diredt your attention to the mouth,
as before diredted for deafnefs, &c„
Inflammation of the eyes, has been fre­
quently treated with fuccefs: during the
operation, engage youf whole attention to
the part afFedted, and endeavour with all
your mind to draw out the inflammation.
Always keep in memory that the mind
mud be wholly employed, as this is much
more neceflary than the motion of the
hands; but I think the treatment is mod
efficacious when both go together as they
fhould.
Pain in the limbs, or in any other part
of the body, may be mitigated, relieved,
and in many inftancts totally removed,
by this method of treatment. Old and
ftubborn pains, require frequent and long
treating, and the practitioner fhould not
be dilcouraged, but perfevere, dill ho­
ping for fuccels.
Fevers, may be greatly relieved by this
method. T would all'o advile to try it in
drains, bruiles, bums, l'caids, fores of
all
22 w o n d e r s o r
all kinds, and in almoft ail diforders
of the human frame.
The fcience is at prefent but in its
beginning, and therefore it is not yet
reduced to a certainty whether or not ic
will prove generally efficacious in tits;
foire few have been cured and more re­
lieved, but in moft jnUances, as far as T
have known, no univerfal fervice has yet
been done, neither in epileptic norconvul-
five fits, nor paralytic cafes.
Removing obftructions of all kinds ap­
pears to be its principal ufe ; and when it
is conlidered that moft diforders proceed
therefrom, it will evidently appear, that
the treatment ought not to be neglefted
in any common cafe. There is this far­
ther to be faid in favour of it, that it
cannot do harm in any cafe; and, may
be productive of very great good in all.
I have laid down the matter in fo plain
and clear a Itvle, that any pcrl’on may be
capable of pra&iling it with luccel's, by the
bit-fling cf God.
Wl.at has brought the fcience into great
difrepute, has been the almoft univerlal
practice of making a lucrative trade of
teaching and pradtifing it, which it is the
great intention of this pamphlet to put a
ltop to, by faying the whole fcience, fo
far as refpects practice, open to all, and
. thereby putting it into their power to
treat their friends and neighbours in the
inoft effectual manner.
But T would recommend all invalids
who apply for relief to attend to the fol­
lowing rules. Firft to avoid all fpiritous
liquors. Secondly, rub themfelves well
with a very courfe towel ; and likewife
make life of that exercife lb much recom­
mended by the late celebrated Dr. Lobb,
which is to lift up one hand and one leg
alternately, pretty brilkly, for about half
an hour together, as often as you can,
which will greatly promote the perfpi-
ration, and univerfally affeCt the whole
habit.

ON A CRISIS, AND ABSENT T R E A T M E N T .
IN the courfe of the treatment as di­
rected, Ihould the patients be thrown into
a crifis, or ftate of infenfibility, be not
difcouraged, however terrifying luch a
ftate may feem; it is only nature and the
diforder in violent conflict, which w;]j
very often happen if the ftomach is oU
£
W O N D E R S OF
of order. In this cafe be lure to con­
tinue the treatment till the paroxylm is
quite ceafed, and they are perfectly com-
pofed. You will then, in general, find
them in a great mcafure freed from all
thole pains and complaints they came to
you to be relieved from.
1 have known fome put into mod vio­
lent agitation, and who continued in the
fame, apparently in very great agonies for
fome time ; but have come out quite eafy
and free from any diforder, without know­
ing that they had been in fuch a (late at
all.
There is an effedt very often produced,
lefs powerful than the crifis, which I have
feen attended with very great and good
confequences, called by fome a commoto,
from the Latin commotus, which caufes the
invalid to be much agitated, without af-
fedting the mental faculties; but I have
feen many relieved from their diforders
without any of thefe effedls. And I can
fay with the ftridteft regard to truth, That
I never knew an invalid, let his or her
pain have been ever fo excruciating, that
went from the treatment without great
relief therefrom.
It may be necefiary to fay fortieth!ng
about abient treatment. This may ap­
pear
. *4
pear to Tome incredible; and indeed this
part of the fcience is more difficult to ex­
plain, than that which has been already
treated of.
But whoever confiders the nature o f the
human mind, and the amazing ftrong
powers of which it is pofleft, fuch as in-
tenfe thought, reflexion, fenfation, voli­
tion, &c. will hefitate before they will pe­
remptorily deny the fa&. I have already
obferved that the mind is the great agent
in producing thofe furprizing effedls,
which frequently attend the treatment.
And the thoughts can fix as ftrongly upon
an abfentas a prefent objeft.
A gentleman of undoubted veracity
lately allured me, that he went into the
country, having at the fame time fome
patients under his care, and he told them
to fit at certain hours, and he treated them
though abfent, and they experienced nearly
the fame effects as when he was prefent
with them.
Diftance is nothing to the mind, and
fince thoughts in many inftances have
great influence, why may they not have
power over the diforders of abfent perfons
as well as thofe that are prefent ?
In order to treat abfent perfons, retire
and fit down by yourfelf for a little time;
C collect
a6 W O N D E R S OF
eolledt your thoughts, and be as much ab-
ftradted as poflible. Refleft on the incon­
ceivable powers with which God has en­
dued you, and on the benefit you with to
■ d
o to your abfenc friend, or acquaintance.
Let the idea of him be ftrongl v fixed in
your mind. After thinking intenfely of
him for i'ome time, begin at his head, and
in your mind proceed downward to his
feet; till by i'ymparhetic power, you per­
ceive yourfelf in union with him, and find
whether he has pain, and what and where
it is, and treat him accordingly. But if
you are informed of his complaint, and
are ddirous of relieving him, then fit
down, and be collected, and begin and
treat him in the fame manner as though
you were perfonally with him. Do this
with all polfiblc energy, as before directed,
and enquire what effedts are produced
thereby : for fometimes very wonderful
alterations have been perceived by the ab-
fent party. Who is there that fully knows
the wonderful powers of which he is pof-
feft, and how much good he may do, if
he employs it all to the belt purpofes ?
Should what has been here offered feem
but an idle tale, or a-mere phantom of the
brain to any, let not fuch be too lufty in
denying what they have not proved but
let
a n i m a l m a g n e t i s m . 2?
let them fairly and impartially try the
power of this wonderful fcience, for their
cwn iatisfadtion, according to the rules
here laid down, and let them endeavour
-to enter into the fpirit and practice of it,
and fee for themfelves what effedls wili be
produced thereby. And doubtlefs in a
little time they will be convinced of the
reality of what T have written, and per­
haps will have reafon to exclaim, tbe cat
half has not yet been told them.

ABSENT T R E A T M E N T .
W E ncrw advance another ftep in the
fcience of Animal Magnetifm ; that o f
abfervt treatment is the mod curious in the
whole art, and depends much upon the
attention of the practitioner. T o the ig­
norant and prejudiced part o f mankind it
appears in a more irrational and obfeure
point of view; but why Pnculd this be
thought wonderful, fince expanfion or dif-
rance is allowed to be a relative idea,
which belongs on'y to body, and has no-
C 2 thing
thing to do with fpirit; the foul is pof-
fetfed with intellectual powers and affixa­
tions, fuch as thought, reflcdtion, fenfation,
volition, or willing, I can as eafily fix my
mind upon St. Peter’s at Rome as on St.
Paul’s in London. Diftance belongs to
body, as obferved before, but thought can­
not be confined, it can travel backward
into the paft or forward into the future; it
can afpire to things above as well as re­
flect on things beneath ; when we want to
recolledt any thing, we travel back into
the paff, we exercife a wifli to recoiled!-,
and often our wifhes are effectual, and the
thing we wilh to recoiled!: is brought back
to our mind. Thoughts are in many ca­
fes influencial, why they may not affed! and
remove difeafes from perfons at a diftance,
as well as thofe at hand, is more than our
mod lupercilious enemies can deny, who
are in them(elv.es well aware of the cfFedts
of the communication of fpirits.
Fludd' furnamed theJeeker, lays it down
for a rui e that ftrong intention is thecaufe
of the vifibility of fpirits being reveala-
ble. In our times, Lavater, the amiable
theorill of phyliognomy, has a theory
fimilar to this in his work. The Abbe
Nollet was of the fame opinion ; and the
Jefuit Nicetas in his aphorifms upon the
human
2* W O N D E R S OF
human will, very ingenioufly accounts for
the vifible manifeftation of forms when
no real or corporeal body can be intro­
duced.
Dr. Henry More, who is mentioned to
be the laft philofopher of note who un-
derftood and praCtifed animal magnetifm,
in his letters to Dr. Napier, recommends
ftrong intellectual endeavours, and accord­
ing to Mr. Aubrey in his Mifcellanies, the
laid Dr. Napier performed many wonder­
ful cures by the mental power of prayer
only, which (hews that this fcience has
been aflifted with divine blefllngs and fpi-
ritual auxilianfm.
In order to perform abfent treatment,
retire, fit down for a few minutes, be per­
fectly collected, and as much abitraCted
as poffible; confider the wonderful pow­
ers you are pofllfied of, and wh..r you
with to perform to your abfent friend j
form his idea in vour mind, fix on it for
lome time, and delcend fiowly and gradu­
ally from the head downward, till by the
power of fympathy you feel vourfilf, as ic
were in contact with him, and find a cor-
refpondent pai; which you mud endea­
vour to remove. But if you know the
complaint your patient labours under, and
lincerely would relieve him, fit dovyi, col-

left yourfelf, and then treat him, though*
abfenr, in the fame manner you would if
you faw him before you.
If upon reading thefe directions the fei-
ence fhould appear a chimera, the reader
is requefted not to cenfure and condemn
it, until he has tried the power of it for his
own fatisfaftion and convi&ion j and if he
find it effectual in one cafe, let him fufpend
his judgment till he has efiayed it in
others, and I am perfuaded he will not be
dilappointed. Let him make trial of his
fk.il! and perfeverance upon a fubjeft who
will not obftinately refill: the operation,
and the more delicate the perfon the more
eafily will this operation be performed.
Whatever cafe you are about to treat, be
not dilheartened, nor weary; if your expec­
tation fliould not, at firft, be fully anfwer-
ed, perfevere, make repeated trials, the
more you praftice the greater will be your
confidence, and the more fuccefsful your
treatment; and thus you fliall have expe­
rimental and give occular demonftration
of the power of the fcience.

DEFENCE OF A N IM A L M A G N E T IS M .
IT lias been obferved in the vain pre-
fumption of fclf-fuffi- ient philofophy,
that animal magnetil'm is the tlfedt o f
magic, and the operation of the devil. If
fo, how conies good to mankind ? Are
wicked means ever employed to perforin
the welfare of others ? arc there not fuf-
ficient men of fenfe in the world to invef-
tigate the fecret, and make a fair report ?
And whence the filende of iht faculty ?
Doth their referve on this new fcience pro­
ceed from contempt of the profef-
lbrs? If it does, is the welfare of the
public below their notice too?
The common objedtion, that they are in-
terefted, and therefore partial judges, is
without foundation. For what is called
animal magnetil'm, if it will not bear in-
fpedtion, why is it not exploded ? I know
a filly, empty, and fcurrilous pamphk-t
has been lately published by a man, who
ftiles himfelf a Dr. Stern •
, but wnat opi­
nion can be formed of a. man who at his
firlt

firft fctting out in a work, ronfeftes him-
fclf perfectly ignorant of the fcicnce it-
feif and the proftflors of it ? Bcfides the
vanity of placing his own portrait, like
the figure of fdf importance, before a
former work of his which does not fell,
this muft be the Kreateft folly. In order
to be accurate in our refearches, let us
confider what animal magnetifm is, and
what it really appears to be in the courfe
of common and of fpecial pra&ice.
Tn general it is known to be the ope­
ration of one animal upon another, to
excite a fympathetic affection j and al­
ways produces lenfible efte&s, both in the
patient, and the operator, by that kind of
treatment which th« art requires.
Magnetifm is both mechanical and
mental, and who dare aver the efficacy of
the power is not encreafed by piety and
prayer ? Are we not affured in Scripture,
that our prayers (hall be heard, elfe whence
the utility of praying ? And I would a(k,
were not the miraculous powers of heal­
ing retained among the firil chriftians, for
more than two centuries, by the power of
prayer ? whoever would deny this, muft
1 fhew his want of faith an’d ecclefialtical
knov. ledge.
The mechanical operation of this fci­
cnce .

ence confifts chiefly in motion. For it
mud be conftft, no man can move his
hand with defign, without a will, volition,
or motive, which proceeding from the
mind are not mechanical, but, in faff, ma­
nual operations, and therefore may be .
properly defined the mechanical part of
the fcience.
The world has long been bubbled by
artifice and cunning- but if this fcience
is the produce and exertions of decer,
who lhall fay “ There is an upright man in
the city !” The pradtifers of this novel
mode, or rather revived method of heal­
ing, aremoltly men of property, therefore
one would think, above the mean attempt
to purloin a fordid gain by artificial deceit:
fome of them belong to the faculty, and
others are pallors of note in London.
From a letter which has lately been received
frcin Bolton, it has been luccefsfully
pradtifed there by -three eminent minif-
ters, who write, that the effects produ­
ced thereby were likely to be of the
greatelt confequence and good to reli­
gion and fociety among the Indians.
It is firnple in its operations, and may
be eafilv learned from example. Do as
you fee me do,” was the only preccnt of
a celebrated magnetilt, in the neighbour­
hood

hood of St. f uke’s, when he found hts
bufinefs incre.ift* fo much upon his hands
as to need afiiitancrj and tins was his
only in(lr.iclion. They did as they were
*taughr, to the great content and fatis-
fiuifion of many patients j they pei formed
before the world— It is a notorious fadt,
and facts arc ftubborn things.
Without: recurring too far bach, it has
long been a notion with the people,
that the evil can be removed by the royal
touch, and fuch has been the belief of
the thing, that the regifterof the royal
chapel in England exhibits a lift of
92107 .perfons relieved during the reign
of Charles the Second, by himfelf. At
moft executions we fee people caufe them-
felves or their friends to be rubbed with
the dead man’s hand, to remove or relieve
certain fwcHings,* and other extraneous
diforders, which have already eluded the
power of medicine. Neither is fympathy
confined to the human body: 1 have
known the ague cured, by burying in a
field a certain piece of fle(h, which had
been worn about the patient’s body.
l;r. Falconer, in his diflertation on the
influence ot the paflrms 01 the dilbrders
of the bodv, relates the wonderful efFedts
to
of»the fympathetic aifeclior.s on the frame
A N I M A L M A G N E T I S M . 3;
and conflitution, and very candidly con-
felTes, they are of greater power than any
may imagine at firft without, and require
the greatcft caution in the application of
them to their particular difeafcs.
