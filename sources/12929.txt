  		              		Experience Description   

    This NDE happened a long time ago when I was 23 years old. Now, I am 58, but this experience has never left my mind. In  the beginning, I only told  my wife because  I knew that she would understand. With time I talked more and more about my experience. I still have fear that I will be considered crazy even though I know I'm not.   I still feel very connected, philosophically, spiritually to the others and especially to the music  that takes an enormous space in my personal well-being.
  
  I could see that the doctor was having trouble with giving me the shot after I had been stung by a bee.  When I felt myself leaving my body at  the doctor's office,  I started to rise above my body. I could clearly see despite my eyes being swelled shut due to anaphylactic shock. I remember having the perception of seeing in 360-degrees, a a bit like the eyes of a fly. I was able to float around. I could see my  wife, the doctor and my body below 'myself'. I heard the doctor panicking, but at no moment was I scared. I felt no pain as I relaxed  in a state of intense tranquility and softness. It was as if I were extraneous to what was happening, while at the same time being aware that it was definitely concerned about my body.

   Then I saw a white light that was beautiful and intense as it  surrounded me. I couldn't say if this had the shape of a tunnel,  but I can say that  the light had  this absolute sensation of calm and well-being. I remember having to make a choice, to continue on my way or to turn back. I remember that I was thinking that I had to return for my wife and my 6 month old baby.  I chose to come back. I didn't talk to anybody over there, but somewhere this decision to go on or to come back  seemed to be the result of  questioning by somebody else. This memory is very blurred. 

  The doctor finally succeeded in  giving me the shot that brought  me back to life.  Then I started a procedure of desensitization at the hospital. Today, I don't have to worry about such a shock anymore.
  
  There have been other events since this NDE happened:
  
  In 2008,  I just started  a new job.  I went to Thailand to join all my work-mates for an off-site job. At the first common dinner, I was seated next to  an American colleague whom  I had never met before. After a only a few minutes of a conversation when out of the blue, she asked me if I had ever had an NDE. She explained to me that she had experienced one and that she could sense those having gone through such an experience.  I never talked again about this with her. I still have her name, even though she is now retired. Many  times, I wondered if I shouldn't contact her once again to continue with this discussion.
  
  In June 2019, I had a strange situation. I have been practicing Qi Gong for about a year. The professor  urged me to take part in a meditation session. I hesitated much for a reason that I ignore. I told myself that this was something that was nothing for me.  Through persuasion, I ended up agreeing.
  
  During this one and a half hour  session, we were into the meditation for about  fifteen minutes.  I first had difficulties to enter this state of meditation, resisting because my inner voice told me not to enter. Then I found myself  connected to myNDE, that I somehow had been burying in my subconscious. This was a violent memory, so violent that I  was crying and feeling ashamed in front of all those people who hardly knew me. I was talking the next day to a priest, after passing hours of being completely upturned. He advised me to read the book from Patrick Theillier about NDEs called 'A sign from heaven which is opening us up for the invisible'. This is how I got to know the existence of your website and I now want to know more.

  Even if my experience has been somewhat limited when I compared to  other experiences that are much more complete and detailed than my own in the outcome, only the fact of having known this out of body experience, the light and the choice of return, was transforming me. I think that I'm not scared to die anymore; me, the one fearing to go on a plane when I was young. This feeling disappeared completely. I don't know if this NDE strengthened my way of Catholic practicing, I'm unable to determine this. Unconsciously I believe that I don't want this because it would mean considering this NDE as a sign, which would mean that I now believe more because I got this sign.    					  


Background Information:       

Gender:   	Male  

Date NDE Occurred:   	 1983  

NDE Elements:       

At the time of your experience, was there an associated life-threatening event?        Yes    Allergic Reaction       Life threatening event, but not clinical death   I had an anaphylactic shock after a bee sting. In my childhood (around the age of 7-8 years) during an accident when, due to a gust of wind, a swarm of bees fell down to my feet and I had been stung several times, I went into a coma; I didn't experience an NDE at that time. It's only when I got stung many years after that I had this anaphylactic shock where my body reacted.  My eyes disappeared with the swelling, my lips expanded, my body became hard as stone and my blood pressure fell dangerously. When my wife was driving me to our doctor (who was also a brother in law of my brother) I was practically unable to breath and felt myself leaving.  

How do you consider the content of your experience?        Both pleasant AND distressing  

Did you feel separated from your body?      Yes  My wife could be a witness of what happened while I was out of body, that the doctor felt that I was passing, my body stiffened by the shock, while I clearly heard their conversation.  I clearly left my body and existed outside it  

How did your highest level of consciousness and alertness during the experience compare to your normal everyday consciousness and alertness?        More consciousness and alertness than normal   As I said, the fact of being able to see 360 degrees without my eyes was absolutely extraordinary, and the calm, me being of a disposition of not keeping my mind cool, was also surprising.  

At what time during the experience were you at your highest level of consciousness and alertness?         After the OBE  

Were your thoughts speeded up?         Faster than usual  

Did time seem to speed up or slow down?         Everything seemed to be happening at once; or time stopped or lost all meaning     No notion of time, I didn't have the impression that there was concomitance between what happened below and above.  

Were your senses More vivid than usual?         Incredibly more vivid  

Please compare your vision during the experience to your everyday vision that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.       I explained it above, a vision out of the ordinary.  

Please compare your hearing during the experience to your everyday hearing that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.      I did hear everything perfectly what happened, the conversation between my wife and the doctor.  

Did you seem to be aware of things going on elsewhere, as if by ESP?       Yes, and the facts have been checked out  

Did you pass into or through a tunnel?         Uncertain     I don't remember precisely a tunnel, but an intense and very pleasant light surrounding me.  

Did you see any beings in your experience?         No  

Did you encounter or become aware of any deceased (or alive) beings?         No       

Did you see, or feel surrounded by, a brilliant light?         A light clearly of mystical or other-worldly origin  

Did you see an unearthly light?         Yes   Yes, because it was very intense but not blinding.  

Did you seem to enter some other, unearthly world?         A clearly mystical or unearthly realm     For sure I wasn't on earth anymore, I was in an 'elsewhere' that I never had experienced.  

What emotions did you feel during the experience?         n absolute serenity, as if what was happening below me didn't really concern me.  

Did you have a feeling of peace or pleasantness?         Incredible peace or pleasantness  

Did you have a feeling of joy?         No  

Did you feel a sense of harmony or unity with the universe?       No  

Did you suddenly seem to understand everything?         Everything about myself or others     I don't know if I understood everything, but everything seemed very clear without emotional interferences.  

Did scenes from your past come back to you?         No       

Did scenes from the future come to you?         No       

Did you come to a border or point of no return?         I came to a definite conscious decision to return to life   As I explained in my account, I remember that I had to make the decision to come back. It was not imposed on me, at least that's what I remember, and I did this for my wife and my son, even if the light was attracting me unbelievably.  

God, Spiritual and Religion:       

What was your religion prior to your experience?      Christian- Catholic   At the time I was not practicing but was open for the catholic religion. My wife was very practicing.  

Have your religious practices changed since your experience?         Yes     I already have explained this above, nothing else to add.  

What is your religion now?         Christian- Catholic   I became a regular churchgoer, liturgical animator and give time to my parish.  

Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was entirely not consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience       

Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         Yes     I already explained that I think that the NDE contributed against my own will to the strengthening of my faith.  

Did you seem to encounter a mystical being or presence, or hear an unidentifiable voice?         No     

Did you see deceased or religious spirits?         No  

Did you encounter or become aware of any beings who previously lived on earth who are described by name in religions (for example: Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, etc.)?         No     

During your experience, did you gain information about premortal existence?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about universal connection or oneness?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about the existence of God?         Uncertain     Of course I connected this information to the fact that there is a supreme being without however having an infallible proof. I'm telling myself that maybe this is a normal reaction of the brain when there is danger of death....  

Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:       

During your experience, did you gain special knowledge or information about your purpose?      No     

During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about an afterlife?         An afterlife definitely exists    The existence of the light and the fact that one could be out of body have been two new things for me in my human experience.  

Did you gain information about how to live our lives?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about life's difficulties, challenges and hardships?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about love?         No       

What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         Moderate changes in my life     I believe that I indicated in my account about the changes that this NDE produced in myself, in a way that is rather unconscious. Today I'm diving back into all this as I need to progress with what happened to me. I think that this contributed to a certain psychological vulnerability.  

Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          Yes For sure with those whom I have shared my experience with. It's a great sign of trust.  

After the NDE:       

Was the experience difficult to express in words?        No     

How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  No other event in my life struck me as much as this one. I'm thinking that the memory that I have about this experience is based on other mechanics than memories of real life.  

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         No       

Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    It's only today that I'm speaking in an open way of this and not with everybody, only with those having a spiritual sensitivity.   Reactions are very varied, but now I know whom I can talk to about this without bringing about incredulity.  

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       No     

What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real     At the time I was burying it, I didn't want to talk about for fear of being considered as mad.  

What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real       

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       Uncertain   I explained above that a recent session of meditation violently put this experience back into my mind.  

Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?         No
