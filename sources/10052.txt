  					 I was driving home and doing about 60mph in my Chevy van and not wearing my seatbelt, when my steering would not steer the van any more. The gearbox went, the wheels stuck in one direction and the van flipped three or four times in mid-air landing back on its wheels.


Then, for me, everything was so nice and peaceful…not dark…nice temperature. I opened my eyes to see the brightest light I had ever seen. I was at a gate-like opening in the light and this nice voice said, “It is not your time, you have something to do yet”. At that moment, I was turned around so I could see the van and through it. I saw my body slumped over the steering wheel. Then I was flying back down to my body. When I got back in my body, that's when I came around [became physically conscious], and went and got some help.
