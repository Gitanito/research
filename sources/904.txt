     Summary:  From Pat Deveney's journal database:

 Talisman (and Occult Review), The.
 A Monthly Magazine Devoted To Practical Idealism.
 1903--1904  Monthly
 Harrogate, England.  Publisher: Albert Osborne Eaves.  Editor: George H. Bratley.  Succeeded by: The New Thought Journal and Occult Review-->New Thought Journal-->Applied Psychology

 1/1, May 1903-2/19, November 1904.  16 pp.  This was the first of a series of New Thought/occultist journals put out by Eaves and Bratley.  On them and their journals generally see the note under New Thought Journal and Occult Review.  Eaves (1866-1944) introduced to Britain American New Thought, with all its bells and whistles (lessons and books, clubs, leagues, talismans, and the like), with varied come-ons to promote the enterprise.  In its first issue it proclaimed:  "To ensure the popularity of the Magazine, all yearly subscribers will be entitled to free reading by Astrology, Palmistry, or Astro-Physiognomy.  Subscribers inducing three others to become subscribers will be entitled to have their names entered on our Occult Bureau, or as an alternative to the above benefits, a unique offer is made to annual subscribers, to each of whom will be presented each month a hektographed copy of a Talisman, with typewritten explanation, which will enable anyone following the instructions to select the proper materials, time, and hours for making Talismans for various purposes."  This initial journal was largely written by Eaves and Bratley, in contrast with its later incarnations which were largely composed of material from a whoâ€™s who of New Thought figures, mainly American.
