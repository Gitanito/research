I lay on the bed for about two hours and bled. I got up with a flashlight and went to the bathroom to see if I could stop the bleeding. As I was trying to stitch the lesion, I noticed that I was getting very weak throughout my upper body.

Very soon all light faded away and my body collapsed to the floor. I saw the face of the woman that I was in love with, and I saw my own face simultaneously, next to hers. (She is still alive, just to let you know.) The background behind us was like a vortex. I felt very serene. She may have been my merit that saved me from death.
