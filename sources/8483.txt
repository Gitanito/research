  &nbsp;Attitudes Toward and Possible Explanations   for the Near-Death Experience

  A 55-year-old married White truck driver was   admitted to the hospital with irregular heartbeat, and during diagnostic   angiography suffered a coronary occlusion. He then underwent emergency quadruple   bypass surgery, following which he reported having had a clear sensation of   leaving his body and observing the operating room from above. He reported   accurately certain idiosyncratic behaviors of the cardiovascular surgeon,   pinpointing when they had occurred during the operation. He also described being   distracted from the operating room scene by a brilliant light and following it   through a tunnel to a region of warmth, love, and peace, where he experienced an   apparent encounter with his deceased mother and brother in law, who communicated   to him, without speaking, that he should return to his body. He awoke with an   intense passion for helping others and a desire to talk about his experience,   much to the dismay of his embarrassed wife.&nbsp;(Greyson, 2000, p. 315)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cases of   people having come close to death and reporting unusual experiences during this   time have been with us throughout history. However, these near-death experiences   (NDEs) did not receive a great deal of attention from the popular culture or the   scientific community until Raymond Moody's (1975) Life After Life came   onto the scene. Life After Life features case studies of people who have   had what Moody termed near-death experiences. Soon after the publication of   Moody's book, several other researchers undertook studies to see if they could   verify his findings.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From   1980-1982 two such researchers, Kenneth Ring, a psychologist, and Michael Sabom,   a cardiologist published detailed studies about NDEs with a statistical   orientation that Life After Life had lacked. To their surprise, the   results of their studies largely replicated Moody's findings. Ring (1980)   identified five stages of what he referred to as the 'core experience'. These   stages included a feeling of peace, separation from the body, entering the   tunnel, seeing the light and entering the light. Although not all stages are   always present, Ring found a pattern. He found feelings of peace to be the most   common, occurring in 60 percent of his sample, following, in order, body   separation, entering the tunnel, seeing the light, and entering the light, which   occurred in 10 percent of his sample. Other phenomena associated with the NDE   include being greeted by friendly voices, people or beings, seeing a panoramic   review of the life just lived, a different sense of time and space, a reluctance   to return to the earth plane and disappointment at being revived (Atwater,   1994), and ineffability when trying to describe it (Sabom, 1982).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NDEs have   been present in other time periods and exist across cultures (Zaleski, 1987).   The incidence of the NDE does not seem to fluctuate much among various   demographic categories such as gender, socioeconomic status or race. However,   there are individual differences as well as cultural differences. Although   people who undergo a life review do not usually feel judged as they view their   life, at least one person has. (Serdahely, 1995). NDEs almost invariably   temporarily free the experiencer from any pain. Yet, a return from this   experience usually means a return in physical pain, but this pain did not return   in at least one case (Serdahely, 1995).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is   also important to mention that not all NDEs are pleasant. While frightening NDEs   in general are significantly less common than pleasant NDEs, it is important to   be aware that they may be greatly underrepresented due to the stigmatism that   would be associated in volunteering or agreeing to relate such an experience. P.   M. H. Atwater (1994), a near-death researcher and NDEer herself, listed some   aspects of hellish NDEs including encountering lifeless or threatening   apparitions, barren or ugly expanses, threats, screams or silence and feelings   of danger and the possibility of violence and/or torture.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not   surprisingly, there is a good deal of skepticism toward near-death experiences.   This skepticism has much to do with the culture we live in today. A short glance   at the transformation that has occurred in thought and science will help   illuminate how we have arrived at a mindset that tends to be in opposition with   phenomena such as the NDE.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the   past few centuries there have been vast changes in the way we view nature and   reality. The focus has been on using the scientific method and studying only   that which is measurable. These general methods have stressed empirical analysis   in which we have experienced exponential advances in our understanding of   nature. This has extended from discoveries of the very small such as the atom   and its constituents, the electron, neutron and proton to the very large such as   galaxies, clusters and super clusters.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have   made great strides in our understanding of the various forces in which matter   appears to operate. First, Isaac Newton explained the activity of everything   from the apple to the planets through his description of gravity. Later, Albert   Einstein furthered this principle through his special and general theories of   relativity. The special theory stresses an equality of all reference points   while the general theory extends this principle to include accelerating motion   and the interaction of speed, mass and time. Einstein's work has helped to give   us everything from the television to the atomic bomb.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The   scientific revolution has had practical benefits that have improved the quality   of life for many people as well. During the Middle Ages in Europe, disease was   rampant. This was most apparent during the time of the Black Plague. Living   conditions in Europe preceding and during the time of the Black Plague were very   poor. Most villagers lived in wooden huts. Even villagers who lived in stone   houses with no windows. It was common for farm animals to spend the nights in   the houses of their owners. Conditions for the nobility were almost as poor.   Stables were located in the same place in which bread was baked. In the kitchen,   flies were free to come and go as they pleased. The noble family spent most of   their time in a hall, which they used for eating, sleeping, banquets and even   relieving themselves (Marks, 1971).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the   above description, it is no wonder that fleas and other vermin were able to   carry diseases so easily. The devastation of the plague, which wiped out   250,000,000 people of one-fourth the population of Europe from 137-1351 (Marks,   1971), was only compounded by the people's ignorance of the principles involved   with spreading the disease. Would this tragedy have been as great if vaccines   and other medical technology advances and better hygienic practices that   followed the scientific revolution already been in place? One can only   speculate.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such   advances and have given us confidence that we can manipulate and improve our   world by understanding physical nature and processes. Emerging from the 'Dark   Ages' has given us a sense of freedom from relying on a higher power to control   our destiny. We have become very good at studying the physical world.&nbsp; So when   we are encountered with a phenomenon of a non-physical nature, many become   skeptical. How can NDEs be measured when they are merely subjective events?   There are no testable, measurable facets within NDEs, are there?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These   questions have plagued the field of near-death studies from being considered   legitimate in the eyes of many. However, a vast body of evidence has lent   support to the existence of NDEs. Some of this evidence comes from apparent   vision in the blind, corroboration from others and facts that the NDEer couldn't   have known if unconscious.

  NDEs appear to be a relatively common   phenomenon. As indicated in the beginning of this paper, they have been present   throughout history. NDEs occur in about 5 percent of the population. A Gallup   and Proctor (1982) poll arrived at this estimate in a survey of 1500 American   adults. This is consistent with an examination of an elderly population (Olson   and Dulaney, 1993). This is also fairly consistent with an unpublished study I   have completed recently (Linzmeier, 2001). I arrived at an overall incidence   rate of 7.5 percent with incidence being higher in those 55 or older (17.4   percent) than those younger than 55 (4.7 percent). It is worth noting that I had   far more non-elderly participants (84) than elderly participants (23). One   reason for a higher percentage in elderly people is that they have been around   longer and have had more chances to have an NDE. The literature definitely   indicates that NDEs do exist, although their interpretation is greatly debated.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kenneth   Ring and Sharon Cooper (1997) conducted a study of 31 blind people, many of who   reported vision during their NDEs. 21 of these people had had an NDE while the   remaining 10 had had an out-of-body experience (OBE), but no NDE. It was found   that in the NDE sample, about half had been blind from birth. In all, 15 of the   21 NDEers and 9 of the 10 OBEers could see during their experience while the   remaining participants either claimed that they did not see or were not sure   whether or not they had seen. Almost all of the non-seeing or unsure blind   people had been blind from birth. The blind people who apparently did see   reported NDEs that included similar aspects to the traditional NDE such as   watching doctors operate on them and otherworldly perceptions such as radiant   light, angels or religious figures, deceased relatives, etc. (Ring &amp; Cooper,   1997).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet   skeptics would argue that reported vision in the blind as well as NDEs in   general are meaningless without evidence to back up their claims. In fact, some   tentative evidence toward the validity of these claims exists in corroborative   evidence.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ring and   Cooper (1997) present one such case of corroboration. A woman who became blind   following a botched surgical procedure was being rushed through a corridor on a   gurney. One of the attendants accidentally slammed her into a closed elevator.   At this point, she had an OBE in which she was able to see her own body from   above as well as the father of her son and her current lover, both of whom were   down the hall.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later,   the former lover, who had not had contact with the woman for seven years prior   to being interviewed, provided a similar description of what had happened that   day including standing next to the father of the woman's child and the   disturbance at the elevator (Ring &amp; Cooper, 1997).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though   documented accounts of corroboration are less common than anecdotal accounts of   corroboration and are deemed more important, the anecdotal accounts can be   illuminating in describing the nature of such incidents.&nbsp;

  When I woke up after the accident, my father   was there, and I didn't even want to know what sort of shape I was in, or how I   was or how the doctors thought I would be. All I wanted to talk about was the   experience I had been through. I told my father who had dragged my body out of   the building, and even what color clothes the person had on, and how they got me   out, and even about all the conversation that had been going on in the area. And   my father said, 'Well, yes, these things were true.' Yet my body was physically   out this whole time, and there was no way I could have seen or heard these   things without being outside of my body.&nbsp; (Moody, 1975, p. 122-123)&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There   have been more direct attempts at trying to prove the existence of NDEs. Greyson   (2000) notes that some studies have been undertaken in which 'targets' are   placed near the ceiling in emergency rooms. In one study, colored pieces of   cardboard were randomly selected and placed in various corners of the room. In   another, a light emitting diode display projected a different nonsense phrase   each day. The studies were conducted for one year and six months, respectively.   However, neither study encountered any NDEers.&nbsp;

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is apparent that researchers in the   field of near-death studies and the research they conduct will be highly   scrutinized and in some cases dismissed by skeptics and other researchers. This   is to be expected. Yet, what about the NDEers themselves?&nbsp; What responses do   they receive to their incredible stories?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Unfortunately, NDEers have frequently received criticism or dismissal when   recounting their stories. This can be especially devastating to people when   loved ones or people they are very close to treat them in this fashion. Very   often, the first person the NDEer speaks to following their NDE is a nurse of   doctor or some sort of medic. These people can have a great effect on the NDEer   as well, however as is evidenced in this passage.&nbsp;

  [Did you try to communicate to anyone   anything of the experience?] Yeah, I told the nurse the next morning that I left   the bed, that I came out into the hall and she told me that it's impossible,   that I was hallucinating and just dropped the subject. And had no time for silly   things like that. [Did you try to tell anybody else?] Yeah, I tried to tell my   internist. When nobody would listen to me about all this, I asked my internist   if I could see a psychiatrist and he told me, no, that I was doing just fine.   They just kept telling me that I was doing just fine'. They were just passing   over the experience. I was the only one that wasn't just passing over it. I   wanted to see a psychiatrist very badly. [For what reason?] Because things were   happening that I just couldn't understand and I thought that maybe the   psychiatrist could help me to understand'. I really thought the psychiatrist at   that point would be the answer to all of my confusion and nobody understood,   nobody wanted me. [How did that make you feel?] I just kept withdrawing more and   more into my own world. I really didn't have much desire to go on living. I   really wanted to go back to the tunnel'. I really wanted to die'.(Ring, 1984,   pg. 93)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  This passage illustrates how important some   degree of understanding and empathy is to the NDEer. It must be realized that   for the NDEer, their experience is not merely a hallucination as some people   frequently claim. In fact, NDEers who have also experienced hallucinations   consider their NDE to be 'more real' than ordinary reality which, in turn is   'more real' than hallucinations they have experienced (Greyson, 2000).   Fortunately, the recent popularity of the NDE in the media has helped to create   greater awareness among professionals and lay people alike than there was two   decades ago.&nbsp;

  Ketzenberger and Keim (2001) noted that,   despite the numerous studies that have been done regarding NDEers and their   beliefs and values, little research has been conducted on the same topic in non-NDE   populations. There appears to be a correlation between knowledge of NDEs and   attitudes toward them. People who have a greater knowledge of NDEs tend to have   more positive attitudes (Ketzenberger &amp; Keim, 2001).

  There seem to be great cultural differences   in beliefs about NDEs. In an Australian study, 58 percent of participants   interpreted an NDE vignette as possible evidence of life after death and 15   percent thought they were dreams or hallucinations. (Kellehear &amp; Heaven, 1989).   This is in stark contrast to a Chinese study in which 58 percent believed they   were dreams or hallucinations and 9 percent believed they were evidence of life   after death (Kellehear, Heaven, &amp; Gao, 1990).

  In my study I looked at familiarity of NDE   and explanation for them in a non-NDE population. In the non-NDE population who   were very familiar with NDEs, 64 percent believed that they were transcendent in   nature.&nbsp; Of those who were somewhat familiar with them, 66 percent believed they   were transcendent in nature. Of those who were not familiar with them, 44   percent believed they were transcendent in nature. Although these statistics are   not overwhelming, they do seem to indicate that if there is some knowledge of   NDEs there is a greater likelihood that they will be viewed as transcendent in   nature. Other explanations that were available included a psychological   explanation and a physiological explanation which were selected with similar,   although lesser frequency (Linzmeier, 2001).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Must we   be solely focused on absolutely proving the existence of NDEs within the   construct of current Western science? Bohm and Peat (2000) talk of a 'creative   play' which can be utilized in order to promote original thought and new   connections among existing ideas. Unfortunately, they note, creative play is   greatly underutilized in the scientific establishment today.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The lack   of creative play and the adherence to established paradigms grows until the   scientist is unaware of his or her limited position (Bohm &amp; Peat, 2000). The   current infrastructure of scientific thought relies on specialization often at   the expense of creativity and novel thought. True, specialists gain greater   knowledge of their respective fields, but at what cost? Might these people be   unaware of the greater picture as they delve deeper and deeper into their own   fields?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creative   play would allow for those in the field of near-death studies to examine   features of the experience, even those of a transcendent nature without proving   absolutely the existence of NDEs. Perhaps by doing so, a method for proving or   disproving their existence might even arise.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is   apparent that NDEs do occur, although their interpretations and explanations   vary. The NDE is very real to the NDEer and the reactions that they encounter   from friends, family and medics have a great effect on how they cope with their   new outlook on life. Although NDEers have traditionally been treated with either   malice or indifference upon telling their stories, an increasing popularity with   NDEs in the media as well as in academia has helped to create greater   understanding. For instance, in my study only 25 percent of participants were   not familiar with the NDE (Linzmeier, 2001).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although   research in near-death studies relies largely on validation of their actual   existence, a deeper analysis into their nature is still warranted. Regardless of   whether NDEs are of a transcendent nature or if they can be explained as a   psychological or physiological phenomenon, they are still of great importance.   The idea of creative play mentioned by Bohm and Peat (2000) should be utilized   in order to further our knowledge of NDEs. Near-death studies may also inform or   be informed by other disciplines such as physics, neurology and psychology so   that we gain a better understanding of the nature of science and reality.
