  		              		Experience Description:   

  					  I was walking with my granddad and two dogs on leads.  It was very icy. I remember my granddad taking the dogs and skidding on the ice on his heels. When I tried to do that with only one dog, I fell hard on my back and just lay there, on the ice. I remember seeing a very bright light and my life flashing before my eyes. I felt peaceful. I then woke up on the sofa in my grandparent's house, with my parents around me talking, and holding my hand. This experience wasn't an NDE I don't think, but it was weird and unexplainable, unless I just knocked myself out and that's why my life flashed in front of me with a bright light around.
