 The journal is notable for having gone through three distinct phases.  Eileen Jeanette Vancho Lyttle-Garrett (1893-1970), the creator and publisher of this journal for most of its existence, was born, if her autobiographical snippets are to be believed, in County Meath, Ireland, of The Ascendancy.  She was orphaned early and apparently was left sufficiently well-off financially, supplemented perhaps by her various marriages (and by the later philanthropy of Francis P. Bolton, a wealthy member of Congress), to divide her time between London, the south of France, and and a penthouse in New York, and to support this journal and the Parapsychology Foundation in New York, which she founded with others in 1951.  From her youth she displayed psychic abilities (pre-cognition, telepathy, psychometry, healing at a distance, etc.) and developed various oriental "trance controls" ("Uvani," "Abdul Latif," et al.), who communicated, they said, messages from the departed and prescient words of coming events.  She impressed Harry Price, Hereward Carrington and other parapsychologists of the time, and was even brought to the United States in 1934 to be tested, successfully it is said, by J.B. Rhine and William McDougall.  Curiously (and uncomfortably for establishment spiritualism), Garrett never accepted the fundamental beliefs of spirit survival and communication with the dead; she continued to attribute her abilities to a vague magnetic propensity inherent in her and to elevated states of consciousness inherent in all men.  She came to the United States at the beginning of World War II and in 1941 started Creative Edge Press and this journal.  The press was apparently successful but the journal, while a highly regarded literary and intellectual effort, never prospered.  It published a who's-who of the public intellectuals and notables/personages of the era, like Pablo Neruda, Rainer Maria Rilke, Lord Dunsany, Christopher Isherwood, Robert Graves, Salvador de Madariaga, Andre Maurois, Theodor Reik, Graham Green, Chester Bowles, William Saroyan, and many others.  Although it was primarily literary and intellectual, the journal did not shy away from the more "occult" subjects, advertising Garrett's own books and books on Nostradamus, as well as articles by Dane Rudhyar, Gerald Heard (on "Mediumship and Mysticism‚Äù) and Dean W.R. Inge.

 Although the journal had a maximum circulation of 25,000, it had never shown a profit, and in Autumn 1952 Garrett transformed it into a quarterly, with new volume and issue numbering, subtitled "The International Digest of Psychical Research and Occult Studies."   To introduce the new concept, she announced in the first issue:  "The purpose of this magazine is not merely to entertain or to startle the reader though you will find, we hope, the contents of this first issue both startling and entertaining. We will not attempt to convert you to extra-sensory or occult practices although we expect the reader to admit that all the subjects discussed . . . exist as vital and palpable facts. Our primary ambition is to open for a new pattern of life and experience" -- a new paradigm, in other words, based on the discoveries of modern parapsychology.  To accomplish this goal, the journal, rather pretentiously, carried in the first issue an article by Albert Schweizer ("Old Black Magic Reborn:"), and followed this with articles by Eric Partridge ("The Language of Witchcraft and Magic," Robert Amadou, Nandor Fodor, Kenneth Rexroth on "The Holy Kabbalah," Eric J. Dingwall,  Martin Ebon (who later was one of the journal's many editors), Aldous Huxley, et al.  It also excerpted and reprinted odds and ends of of filler gathered from a lifetime of reading around the occult, and  advertised Garrett's own books and her Parapsychology Foundation and the occult books of her Creative Edge Press, as well as prominent advertisements for Dianetics (300,000 sold!).

 The journal's third transformation came about in 1962 when friends/disciples of Frithof Schuon in England took over the journal and transformed it into the vehicle for the ideas of Rene Guenon and the neo-Traditionalists, notably Schuon, Marco Pallis, Whitall N. Perry, Martin Lings, and Titus Burkhardt.  Guenon (1886-1951) had reintroduced into western religion and metaphysics the fundamental notion the perennial tradition, the original revelation of universal wisdom that now survives, in more or less garbled form, in all the religions and symbols of the world.  Tradition was coupled with "initiation," the effective entrance onto a traditional path to true realization.  For Guenon, and for many of his disciples, this path was Islam, although several sought initiation in Eastern Catholicism and Hinduism and in Freemasonry.  The journal included articles by the likes of Thomas Merton, Kathleen Raine, Trevor Hall, and Eileen Garrett, sympathetic reviews of the books of  Pierre Teilhard de Chardin and Idries Shah, and lengthy articles translated from the works of Guenon and Schuon.
