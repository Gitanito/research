  		              		Experience Description   

    After leaving my school bus and walking toward my home,  I fell over on my lawn. Suddenly, I found myself looking down onto my body.  I thought, 'Must be my diabetes, I must be going low.'  I felt a purpose to life and understood that I cannot 'float' upwards anymore. I  should head back down and go back into my body.  I felt sadness about my state of being, as I was lying on the face of the earth.

  Since then I have felt a powerful calling in my life: don't ask me what that calling is I have yet to find out!
