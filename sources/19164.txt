so what I&#39;d like to discuss now is an
overview of the consciousness the
science of consciousness specifically is
that applies to training and meditation
and the phases of development for remote
viewing and doing the coherent oh
sequencing so do you have a very clear
understanding of it what is that orange
orange orange object look up oh whoa oh
my god well just don&#39;t don&#39;t pop too
much please crouch down and locals your
block our cameras Wow those behind me
may move and stand up because okay that
you see that color no no oh no
no that&#39;s absolutely thank them for
coming Wow and it&#39;s above the sea level
turn off your night scope Charles off
someone&#39;s infrared or whatever that&#39;s
Charles oh whoa oh here they come or to
whoever&#39;s right in the front if you can
kind of just stay low because your head
is right you can get on your knees and
front yeah look at this how Gorgon as&#39;
okay so I&#39;m looking with the night
scopes there&#39;s no smoke there&#39;s no
trails these are not flares and oh my
okay let&#39;s welcome them here oh they&#39;re
so beautifully they were waiting for us
to arrive Wally&#39;s photograph all cameras
should be filming so connect to them in
your consciousness and invite them here
these are the golden ones I talked about
CL gold particles the horizon is only 7
to 10 miles sent on the condition so
it&#39;s probably a couple miles everybody
see them yeah they&#39;re so beautiful
let&#39;s welcome their beans on board to
join us in meditation
that is such a beautiful color so you&#39;ll
never forget that color yeah this is a
major event so we are grateful so open
your heart chakra and send them the
beauty of humanity and if you can see
what I&#39;m doing you connect with your
palms out like this and your third eye
and your heart making like a tetrahedron
radiating our pureness and love towards
them they emerge from the sky but
they&#39;re very very close to the ocean
they&#39;re just hovering they&#39;re not um
whoever&#39;s just right in front of the
yellow kind of blue jacket your heads no
no yeah you&#39;re just kind of in to go
down okay you know what I&#39;m I&#39;m gonna
move we should be filming I am filming
it&#39;s just kind of goes in front if you
can get on your knees or sit on the
ground and look in front of your chairs
but stay low thank you
just going to reposition you need a
higher tripod I can bring it high just
on it well don&#39;t wait we&#39;re going to
lose it yeah yeah another time for that
okay that&#39;s clear air it just sort of
vanished the one on the right
they&#39;ve stayed pretty much the same
altitude though Wow let&#39;s invite them to
come as close as they can safely I need
a time mark damn time 9:15 9:15 so the
market time 9 to 26 oh that&#39;s gone into
the ocean see what it did
okay there is still an object there very
faint I can see with the night scope
right here yeah let&#39;s we&#39;re recording
now the way that you know that that&#39;s
not like something like a flare first of
all there&#39;s no it didn&#39;t shoot up and
then come down and didn&#39;t problem
and the first thing that has to be
understood is the nature of awareness so
awareness is as you&#39;re all listening to
my voice take up just a moment to watch
yourself listening so as I&#39;m speaking
just look at how it is that you&#39;re awake
listening and hearing my voice what is
that you&#39;re conscious
you&#39;re awake okay now subtract my voice
what you&#39;re seeing with your eyes your
thoughts your perception of your body
your perception of your ego your
individuality they&#39;re still awareness
they&#39;re that&#39;s all it is that&#39;s all it
is it&#39;s very zen so you&#39;re awake and
it&#39;s really about becoming aware of
awareness
aircraft up there not far
seven miles
it&#39;s probably a couple of miles there
right season yeah
let&#39;s welcome there
that is such a beautiful color so you&#39;ll
never forget that color
we&#39;re grateful so open your heart chakra
and send them the beauty of humanity and
if you can see what I&#39;m doing you can
connect to your palms out like this and
your third eye and your heart making
like a tetrahedron radiating our
pureness and love towards them they
emerge from the sky but they&#39;re very
very close to the ocean
they&#39;re just hovering they&#39;re not
whoever is just right in front of the
yellow kind of blue jogging your heads
that&#39;s no no God you just kind of go
down
those in front if you can get on your
knees or sit on the ground look running
for chairs
don&#39;t wait
one go away together
today it&#39;s okay that in their hair it
just sort of vanish the one on the right
he&#39;s color he&#39;s dumped I got a feeling
he&#39;s
cool stays pretty much the same altitude
so pretty limited like them to coming
close with a hand
I need a time mark
9:15 so the marked time
losing it oh that&#39;s gone into the ocean
see what it did serious okay are still
an object there there
with the mind becoming as it were pure
and clear and empty of any distractions
and so then you&#39;re just there immersed
in quiet mind without the perceptions of
discrete objects of perception whether
it be thoughts self material body sounds
any other
now all meditation techniques if they
are effective are intended to allow the
practitioner to experience the state of
being awake within pure awareness
without any perception of a relative
discrete perception meaning you&#39;re only
aware of awareness and nothing else
