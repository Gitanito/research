  		              		Experience Description   

  During a prayer session at our school, I fell over. I had an intense sense of flying through a bright white mist or fog. The deeper I flew into the fog, the more intense the sense of comfort and wellbeing I felt.  I also distinctly felt more and more tired, like an intense need to sleep. I just wanted to get deeper into this mist.  I also recall that I was flying into this mist at a gradient from above toward the 'ground'.
  
  I even remember someone calling my name and this irritated me  because it kept me from moving deeper into the mist and eventually I felt like I was being shaken. I woke up and a friend was slapping me and calling my name. I remember how unhappy I was to be back, for many years afterwards. I remembered the wonderful feeling of peace I had felt and could not wait for that to happen again.     					  

Background Information:

NDE Elements:       

  At the time of your experience, was there an associated life-threatening event?        Uncertain         I  passed out, probably due to dehydration and low blood sugar.  Life threatening event, but not clinical death.   There seemed to be nothing obvious and I was taken to a doctor. However, it seemed that I was extremely dehydrated and had a low blood sugar level.  
  
How do you consider the content of your experience?        Entirely pleasant  

  Did you feel separated from your body?      Yes  I could hear my friend call out my name and felt him slap my face. I do know that when I felt and heard these things, I felt like I was above and beyond my body. Somehow, I was hearing and feeling all of this but I was not in my body and that every time my name was called or that my face was slapped, it tugged at my flying spirit. This tugging sensation was what irritated me the most. It felt like I was being pulled down.  I clearly left my body and existed outside it  
  
  How did your highest level of consciousness and alertness during the experience compare to your normal everyday consciousness and alertness?        More consciousness and alertness than normal.   It was very vivid and to this day I remember the colour of the mist and the intense feeling of comfort that I had felt as well as he urge to get deeper into that mist.

Were your thoughts speeded up?         No  

Did time seem to speed up or slow down?         No     

Were your senses More vivid than usual?         More vivid than usual  

  Please compare your vision during the experience to your everyday vision that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.       It was vivid. Every sense sight, hearing and physical sensations was extremely vivid.  
  
  Please compare your hearing during the experience to your everyday hearing that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.      Intensely vivid, I also found the voice of my friend extremely annoying purely because it was preventing me from going  into the mist.

Did you pass into or through a tunnel?         No

Did you encounter or become aware of any deceased (or alive) beings?         No       

Did you see, or feel surrounded by, a brilliant light?         A light clearly of mystical or other-worldly origin  

  Did you see an unearthly light?         Uncertain   I just remember the bright, white mist but the deeper I got into it; it got grey, especially toward the end just before I woke up.  
  
  Did you seem to enter some other, unearthly world?         Some unfamiliar and strange place     I knew that I was not 'here.' I was flying above somewhere but that I was moving down a gradient toward something.  
  
What emotions did you feel during the experience?         Peace, a growing sense of tiredness and absolute need to sleep. I also felt this wonderful sense of comfort.  

Did you have a feeling of peace or pleasantness?         Incredible peace or pleasantness  

Did you have a feeling of joy?         Happiness

Did scenes from your past come back to you?         No       

Did scenes from the future come to you?         No       

Did you come to a border or point of no return?         No     

God, Spiritual and Religion:       

  What was your religion prior to your experience?      Hindu.   I was deeply religious.  
  
Have your religious practices changed since your experience?         Yes     I believed in eastern religious through when I was younger, after that I found my belief gravitate towards Christianity  

What is your religion now?         Christian- Protestant     

  Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was entirely not consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience.     The mist, the sense of tiredness and bliss that I had felt was something unexpected.  It still sticks with me today, especially the tiredness and the need to sleep coupled with the sense of bliss.  
  
  Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         Yes     My path in life changed after that, my religious beliefs also changed.  I am very sure that my sense of independence grew stronger.  
  
Did you seem to encounter a mystical being or presence, or hear an unidentifiable voice?         No     

Did you see deceased or religious spirits?         No  

Did you encounter or become aware of any beings who previously lived on earth who are described by name in religions (for example: Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, etc.)?         No     

During your experience, did you gain information about premortal existence?         Yes     There was an after life and that it was blissful.  

During your experience, did you gain information about universal connection or oneness?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about the existence of God?         No       

Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:       

During your experience, did you gain special knowledge or information about your purpose?      No     

During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?         No       

  During your experience, did you gain information about an afterlife?         An afterlife definitely exists.          I knew from the moment I entered that mist that this was another place, as real as the living world.  
  
Did you gain information about how to live our lives?         Yes     I wanted to return to that place, I felt immensely annoyed to have been brought back. For years afterwards, I yearned to go back there.  

During your experience, did you gain information about life's difficulties, challenges and hardships?         Yes     The life on Earth felt hard, harsh, unpleasant and I remember that it felt painful to come back. Everything felt wrong.  

  During your experience, did you gain information about love?         Uncertain     I felt an intense tiredness, need to sleep. Yet, it felt more pleasant and blissful the deeper I flew into the mist. I did not feel love or loved.  
  
  What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         Large changes in my life.     I wanted to go back to that place. I now realize that I was not alone in there and whatever was there with me is with me now, there have been too many inexplicable events since that experience that makes me sure of this.  
  
  Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          Yes I am more of a loner since that time.
  
After the NDE:       

Was the experience difficult to express in words?        No     

  How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  I still remember the several events.  I remember the strange sensations of tiredness, need for sleep and bliss. I never remember sensations. 5 years ago, I had surgery and I can't remember the pain afterwards. This experience is different.  
  
  Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         Yes     There have been both good and some unpleasant experiences since, some that have and still terrify me. But there is one overriding sense that there was something powerfully good in that mist that I was flying toward. It is with me and it has been my guide  
  
  Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          The sense of something that I was flying toward. I had this deep need to get to it.  I felt that once I was with it everything would be perfect,  
  
Have you ever shared this experience with others?       No      

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       No     

  What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real.     I knew instinctively what it was, the feelings of comfort and bliss made me want to go back there.  
  
  What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real.     I known it was real and there have been events in my life since that event that confirm it.  
  
At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       Uncertain   

  Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?         I feel that it was a key event. In my life and in hindsight, I can say that a lot changed from then on.  
  
  Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?         I think that this has helped me in a way to put into context my experiences. Please ask questions about 'things' that have transpired after the events and if one has had a sense of not being alone since.  I would like to know if other people have also had these experiences.
