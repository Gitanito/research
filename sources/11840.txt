At the beginning, there was a horizontal, very quick flight in complete darkness followed by sudden move up towards a very bright light. The feeling of time disappeared (no time existed there). Anger and all unpleasant emotions disappeared. What remained was overwhelming love for everything. All secrets of world's creation and meaning of life were revealed. I wanted to remember everything. Later some being took me by the right hand.  I was led around to places that possessed fairytale like beauty and was explaining something very patiently to me. I was trying to remember everything. Upon returning to the body, my right hand for a while had extrasensory abilities (I unintentionally caused first degree burns on my relative's back while trying to remove her back ache.) Right after being discharged from the hospital, I had to attend a funeral where I physically felt the closeness of invisible substance. Later on all my abilities disappeared.
