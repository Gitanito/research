                                          I seemed to be standing on a brink of a vast outer world unseen because the whole of your being was focused on a Great, White, Steady All-curing and embracing Light that I felt a wondrous Love emanating from it. I longed to jump into the Light but was not allowed. Instead it spoke to me, ‘YOU are a being in which a spirit lives, bound to the earth, which has to rise through your feelings to God.’ I was shown the purpose of life, the reason for suffering and was told I had a purpose to perform before I could pass on. I must return to earth for childbirth. I was then taken to a Second Place. There seemed to be a preparing Place or lesser Heaven, embedded behind the Light. I could hear the voices of the Spirits who had gone before. My Mother’s voice was one of those voices. She spoke to the Light, begging it to explain about the purpose of the Preparing or Resting Place. She begged for the end of all family quarrels and unkindness’s. 
 
 Then I was shown a wondrous thing. I saw people who had been allowed to dive into the Light and as they passed through, they seemed to give off many lesser lights or Spirits: this was the rebirth of their spirit children from their kind or unkind deeds on earth. It seemed as if the person broke apart and yet I knew the person was still whole and that only the power of their deeds would break apart. It was explained that kindly actions give larger spiritual energy to the new mortals while unkindness resulted in lesser spiritual force.  
 
 The conclusion I reached was that I needed to lead a life of love and kindly deeds on this earth. I would receive more energy that is spiritual, for those I love and help. It is by Love that I can reach the spiritual heights, because God is the greatest and purest Love.  
 
 After a child is born, one cannot affect the Spirit Atom of the child. The Spirit Atom is the soul sent straight from God. I was told that our children’s spirits are not part of ours because they are of our flesh. Their spirits are the result of some other soul that has gone on to be re-birthed from its own Spiritual Atoms.  
 
 Although I was told my purpose for coming back, I still longed to die. I kept half-recovering from the anesthetic and then sinking back into unconsciousness again. But the angels and Spirits that had ‘passed over’ surrounded me. I had a descending feeling of being followed by unseen hosts and they kept on saying ‘Go back and see your baby. Just go back and see your baby first.’ 
 
 Just as I had finished writing, The doctor came into my room. I gave him my writings and asked him to read them. 
 
 A few days later Gwen’s temperature went up again and her pains seemed to be getting worse. She had another examination under anesthetic. This was then followed by a final operation to prevent the possibility of more children.

What was your religion prior to your experience?    Christian- Protestant   Christian, Protestant (Anglican with Quaker tradition in her motherâ€™s family). Intermittent  church attendance  in years immediately before 1930, but in the few weeks prior to her miscarriage and hospitalization it happened that she had been challenged to think about what she believed. She studied the Gospels carefully and gave a talk on her perception of the kind of person Jesus was.

What is your religion now?       Christian- Protestant   Gwen remained an Anglican  (Christian Protestant) but took her religion more seriously, prayed and attended church more regularly  and had a deeper and more spiritual faith in God than before.

Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?       Content that was both consistent and not consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience     The purpose of life and the nature of God is Love. The formation of our spirits, created by the deeds of others who have lived before us, and sent to us directly from God, rather than being inherited. Our deeds of kindness here on earth help the spirits in the Waiting Place to move on to the Final Heaven.

During your experience, did you gain information about premortal existence?       Uncertain     Gwen was told our spirits come from God and are the results of the kind or unkind actions of others who have passed on. Our spirit itself retains its individuality and may have wait in the waiting place until its spirit children can help him or her on to the final Heaven.  'And then I was shown a wondrous thing. I saw people who had been allowed to dive into the â€˜Lightâ€™ and as they passed through it they seemed to give off many lesser lights or Spirits: this was the rebirth of their Spirit children from their kind or unkind deeds on earthâ€¦  these people did not lose their individuality- they went on  it was only that they left behind the results of their actions on earth by the rebirth of their spirit children. â€¦'

During your experience, did you gain information about universal connection or oneness?       Yes     She knew the Light was God and that God was Love. The Final Heaven is to unite in the Light itself; one with God, into his likeness and help in his work.

Did you believe in the existence of God prior to your experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of th

During your experience, did you gain information about the existence of God?       Yes     A Great White Steady All-curing and embracing Light. I felt a wondrous Love from radiating from the light. It radiated feeling, sympathy, and everything you desired. It was like the Greatest Comforter. 
 
  Mary cannot answer this with certainty for her mother but Knows that she wrote notes and made a sketch immediately, and wrote them up a year later. They were a vivid and important part of her life still in the 1950s, when she resumed her writing. Her last attempt to get it published was in 1975. But she also always remembered the interesting things she saw on her journey back to the United Kingdom after her recovery, summer 1930, which was via north China and then across Canada by rail. However, she was not propelled to write about these, though I (Mary) recall her talking about it.

Do you believe in the existence of God after your experience?       Mary  cannot answer this with certainty for her  mother but Knows that she wrote notes and made a sketch immediately, and wrote them up a year later.  They were a vivid and important part of her life still in the 1950s, when she resumed her writing.  Her  

Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:

During your experience, did you gain special knowledge or information about your purpose?    as they will swing you on twofold to the Heaven of Final Desire'  [through your spirit childrenâ€™s good deeds which will free you from the waiting place   Your spirit children’s good deeds will free you from the waiting place while your own kind deeds have helped someone who died before you.

During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?       Yes     We have spirit children resulting from our kind or unkind deeds. Our kind actions here can help on the progress of those waiting to join the Final Heaven and to help in the great work of Comforting Love, and Bettering the World of Spirits so that they could finally join the Light.

Did you believe in an afterlife prior to your experience?       God definitely exists

Do you believe in an afterlife after your experience?       God definitely exists     Yes     See experience

Did you fear death prior to your experience?       An afterlife probably exists

Did you gain information about how to live our lives?       Yes     ‘The conclusion I reached is that we need to lead lives of Love and kind deeds on this earth. It does not matter if the deeds of kindness ae not returned on earth.’

During your experience, did you gain information about life's difficulties, challenges and hardships?       Uncertain     Fulfilling the purpose for which she was born might cause death so proving that the desire to return to God’s Love is even greater than her earthly desires.

During your experience, did you gain information about love?       Yes     The Great White Steady, all curing and embracing Light. She could not touch the Light and yet felt a wondrous Love emanating from it. Everything seemed so worthwhile. All one’s suffering seemed so small and worth it. I remember saying to myself ‘Why, this is the Love beyond understanding!’  

After the NDE:

Was the experience difficult to express in words?      Uncertain   She remembered the messages clearly but seems to have struggled a bit with spacial aspects and how she moved from one place to another. She did a sketch that helps. This is in her book.

How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?     Content that was both consistent and not consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience  Gwen always believed in God and the afterlife, but the detail of its nature and of its stages was new.

Did the questions asked and information that you provided accurately and comprehensively describe your experience?       Uncertain
