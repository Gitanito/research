I fell into the river at the foot of a bridge. It was in summer and I had boots on. I couldn't swim. After a short panic underwater, I no longer felt my body and started to experience a feeling of happiness. In a moment that seemed very short to me, I reviewed the happy events of the life I had led. Then I was floating in a white light. Next, I had the feeling that I was asked very gently to make a choice between living or not living. I experienced that state of weightlessness as very pleasant. Then I regained consciousness because someone had dived in the water and had gotten me out. On the bank of the river I felt very cold.
