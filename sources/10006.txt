  		              		Experience Description   

    I saw the movie 'Mary Poppins' and thought how much I hated myself and my life. My dad had just had knee surgery. My mom had high-blood pressure and many other health issues. I went to my parent's house and they weren't home. So, I took every pill in the house. I went to bed with the expectation that I wouldn't wake up. Unfortunately, I did wake up around noon the next day. I was very groggy and very upset. My mom calling for me  to get up because we had guests. I couldn't fully wake-up. I phoned a friend, and all I could say was, 'I am sorry.' He phoned my parents and told them I had taken the pills.

  I was taken to the hospital and  was almost unconscious. They couldn't pump my stomach because all the drugs were in my bloodstream.  They didn't do a blood transfusion because they were afraid of sending me into shock.  I was had a high fever and the nurses kept checking on me.  My mom kept my fever down by giving me  sponge baths all night long.

   I lost consciousness during the night.  I went up a white tunnel and saw my Godfather who sent me back.  He said, 'It is not your time yet.' Then, I was floating above the hospital room. I saw my mom and her best friend,  who had come to offer support. They were both very upset. 

  I woke up on the table and was wheeled up to the upper floor of the hospital. I was in the hallway and the orderly woke me up by tapping my shoulder.   He said, You took enough pills to kill an elephant. Don't do that again!' I nodded as much as I was able. He replied, 'Promise me.' He made me nod again.  I was in critical condition for three days. I don't remember after that until the next day.  

  The next day, I woke up and couldn't hear because I had taken so much aspirin. My heart rate was low, but strong. The medical personel concluded that the exercise induced by the medications had made my heart super-fit because it had been beating so fast and so hard for so many days. They were asking me cognitive questions to determine my mental status.  I told a nurse about my experience in the tunnel. She said to not say anything like that to anyone because  they would think I was crazy. I didn't mention it again.

  I made sense of my experience eventually and decided that God is in control. I have had waxing and waning faith over the years but because of my experience, my faith is strong today.
