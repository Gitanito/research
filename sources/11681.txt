    Momentarily, the feelings I was out of body during my two NDEs  

  Yi-Ming 2017-08-08 21:10 5,759     

    Hi, everyone, I am a thirty-year-old, ordinary person for what I had experienced something that I am not sure if it was the reality or only an illusion. I had two near-death experiences so let me share the first one. To protect my own privacy, I am not going to reveal what the cause of my NDE, but it did happen. I was poisoned and lost consciousness. I became difficult to breath, my mind was hazy, blood flow was still, and my whole body was cold. Though I felt nothing of my chronic shoulder and spine pains that bothered me for years, and I was at ease. It felt like I had lost five senses. Then after without knowing how long the time had passed, I felt I was floating up in air without seeing anything. It seemed like I was engulfed and flying in a black hole. I was unemotional, immobile, and mute. Not knowing how long I had been flying, then there were pictures appeared in front of me from my adulthood to childhood and it sped up fast until I saw some unfamiliar pictures. Finally, I reached to the universe where there are galaxies and unknown stars. Suddenly, I felt a heavy pull downward back to the black hole prior. I felt myself like a meteor in a full speed moving towards the ground. Vaguely, I knew I was above the ground, and saw lights were flickering for I fell down in such a high speed that everything seemed to be blurry. Then I was blackout, stomach nauseating, and body shivering. I heard a woman yelling said, “He is responding, he is back.” Later, I found out I was resuscitated at the hospital and the sensation of stomachache was due to tracheal intubation and stomach pumping as well.  Gradually, I regained consciousness from the verge of death, and my body and mind were exhausted. It took several days for me to recuperate from this state.     

    My second NDE initiated in an internet bar while playing video games. I had been playing the games for two days straight that I was going too much of it and felt fatigued. Around 11 o’clock, I laid back on a chair and half-closed my eyes to take a break, then suddenly I lost body sensations. It felt great though. The familiarity of the blood flow cessation occurred again. However, this time I got a feeling that I was pull out of my body by an unknown force. It became so dark that I could see nothing, yet I could hear people’s thoughts from far away. I was shaken by my friend next to me and he asked, “What happened to you?” His voice was amplified as loud as a thunder and I could feel his uneasiness in fear. I also felt people in this place playing video games, some are happy, others are sad or angry. I heard the keyboard stroked sounds while they played the games. I could even clearly hear cars’ honking from outsides. I was so afraid that I am dying. Although I could see nothing, I sensed there were two human-shaped silhouettes in front of me. One of them was extremely dark who merged into the dark surroundings, and the other emitted red light that looked like a pale-red lantern in the night. I felt the red silhouette was not he because the voices were feminine. Finally, I resumed consciousness and it felt like I was stuck back to my body. Feeling exceedingly worn out and stiffness so my friends asked, “What had happened to you?” I thought he would not understand what I had been through, so I decided not telling him the truth. I felt horrible and went home hastily. They are legitimate experiences that I had undergone. I am not going after the fame and fortune, instead I only wanted to vent, so I would feel better because I dared not telling this to friends and family due to, they will think I am lunatic.
