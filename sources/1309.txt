PREFACE
The present third supplementary Library Catalogue covers the
additions made to the Library from October 1929 to December
1930. The period from July 1927 to June 1928 was covered by
the first supplement, and that from July 1928 to September 1929
by the second supplement ; these are published as Parts 108 and
113 of Proceedings respectively, and as separate pamphlets. The
main catalogue, complete to June 1927, forms Part 104, volume
xxxvii, of Proceedings, and is also published as a separate volume.
The organisation of the Library is briefly explained in the
Preface to the first supplement, and the Library Rules are
reprinted on the next page.
The larger part of the books described in the following pages
has been bought out of the grant made to the Society's Library
by the Carnegie United Kingdom Trust.

FURTHER INQUIRIES INTO THE ELEMENT OF
CHANCE IN BOOKTESTS
By Theodore Besterman
The nature and origin of booktests have been fully described by
Mrs Sidgwick in the introduction to her paper on this subject. 1
Throughout her paper she emphasises the complexity of the phen-
omenon and the difficulties involved in evaluating it. As is the case
with all such " free " material, that is, such as cannot be statistically
investigated in the same way as numbers and playing cards, the
evidential value of booktests can only be definitely established by
means of control experiments. Consequently Mrs Sidgwick con-
ducted a limited investigation of this kind. She took an actual test
given in a sitting with Mrs Leonard and checked it against twelve
books selected by her at random.2
The experiment, however, was
on too small a scale to provide adequate material for comparison.
A little later, therefore, a larger experiment was undertaken, though
on different lines. Sixty people were asked to choose ten books each,
at random. After they had chosen the books they were asked to
verify from each book three tests devised for the purpose. The 1800
passages thus obtained produced, according to the late Colonel
Baddeley's analysis, an average of 4-7 per cent, of success, as against
36 per cent, obtained by Mrs Leonard over the whole of such of her
actual booktests as were examined by Mrs Sidgwick. 3
The objection could be raised against this experiment that it was
wholly artificial, having no relation to a genuine booktest, as had
Mrs Sidgwick's original investigation of chance, and that it was con-
ducted under conditions having no resemblance to those of an actual
booktest. Under those circumstances chance was not, as it were,
given a fair trial. It seemed useful, therefore, to repeat Mrs Sidg-
wick's experiment on a larger scale, and also to supplement it with
an experiment in which persons claiming supernormal powers, or
having some experience of booktests, or having considerable literary

(iO Further Inquiries into Element of Chance in Booldests [part
knowledge, should attempt to give booktests in the ordinary way.
Thus, the dice would be heavily loaded in favour of chance. The
present paper reports the result of these two small investigations.
I
The form taken by the last-mentioned experiment was as follows.
A number of members and others were invited to take part, and
those who agreed to do so were sent the following circular :
"4 February 1931.
" Thank you for having kindly agreed to take part in our experi-
mental investigation of booktests.
" The object of the experiment is to discover whether individuals
(other than mediums) who are thought to have some supernormal
faculty or who are successful in sittings with mediums, can produce
booktests which are at all comparable with those given by mediums.
" What we ask you to do is to try, when you feel in the mood (so
as to give the subconscious as free play as possible) at any time
during the week from Sunday, the 8th of February to Saturday, the
14th of February (both dates inclusive), to imagine that you are in
Mr Besterman's flat on the second floor of 47 Great Ormond Street,
Bloomsbury, W.C. 1, and to give a booktest from it. I hope that
the procedure is known to all the experimenters.
" Replies should be addressed to the Secretary, Society for Psychi-
cal Research, 31 Tavistock Square, London, W.C. 1, and should
reach me not later than Monday, the 16th of February. Please mark
your envelope with a '
B '
in the top left-hand corner."
Owing to absence, delay, and other causes, only a small number
of replies that could be used was received, eighteen in all. Miss
Carruthers then very kindly co-operated by allowing the unopened
envelopes to be handed to her by Miss Newton, and by bringing
them to my flat, there opening them, and verifying the references
from my shelves. The results are set out below. In view of the
disappointingly small number of replies, I have not thought it worth
while to make elaborate analyses, and have contented myself with
a minimum number of laconic annotations, which appear in italics
within square brackets. It will be seen that some of the numbers
are missing. This is due to the fact that the unopened envelopes
received before the final date were numbered on the outside for
identification, and that some of them, on being opened, were found
to contain only apologies for inability to take part, and the like.

" I see a bookcase opposite a window [no]. On the second
shelf or row of books from the ground, 4th book from left (facing
bookcase). A book with a greenish or bluish cover [not correct of the
corresponding book in any bookcase]. Page 14 I get impressions of
travel or of description of foreign scenes. Not so much in the East
as nearer at home in Europe. Perhaps Germany or Switzerland [no,
as before]. Name of a town beginning with B or St somewhere on
this page (14) or the opposite page opening on this [no, as before].
Also something on p. 14 to do with light or brightness or shining
[no, as before]."

four lots [three]. Take the first lot as you go round the room to the
left on entering. Third shelf up, fifth book from the left. Page 37,
in the upper part of the page. Something about a citadel, a fortress,
an idea of high walls, very strong [no]. An impression of a small
statue somewhere near the books [no]. Also an impression of some-
thing bright blue [yes, the covers of the book]." Herbert Jenkins,

two thin pamphlets, neither having 37 pages, which are almost
invisible when the shelf is inspected.

" After about five minutes, I found myself thinking of an
alcove with a curved top, about the height of a door I thought [yes,
a recessed doorway, but it has not a curved top]. Got the impression
of green paper [no] and white paint [no] connected with the alcove.
There were a good many shelves [yes], and they went up to about
the height of a frieze in a room [yes, but there is no frieze]. Then
I got the idea that the paint was cream, not white [no]. And I
became not sure whether the green was due to paper, or was the
colour of books in the top row [yes, but not in the room with the alcove].
I thought it might be a batch of green books. A soft green [yes].
From left to right the books seemed smallish at first [no] and then
became the size of good sized novels [yes] and these were a soft green
colour. I thought they were Thackeray at first, and then began to
62 Further Inquiries into Element of Chance in Booktests [part
wonder if the colour had made me think that, as it was much the
colour of our Thackerays. I decided in the end that the green was
a dull green, like a slightly faded reseda [no], and that Jane Austen
was the author [no]. But I '
got ' nothing from inside any book.
We have green Jane Austens !
" The top shelf in question contains
only S.P.R. Proceedings.
[8].
" After two vain attempts for the book-test I got the follow-
ing quite vividly. I saw an oblong room [yes, but only slightly] —
all the colours in it seemed green [yes] and brown [yes, the furniture].
To the left-hand side of the room was a high shelf book-case [yes]—
no glass doors [no, i.e. it has glass doors]. Above it was a very small
convex mirror in a gilt frame [no]. (The odd thing was I saw this
convex mirror every time T tried to visualise the flat.) On the top
shelf of the book-case, the 4th or 5th volume from the left I saw a
book—it seemed in dark green [no] but I saw no name on it. On
page 87 on the fifth line I saw the word augur [no]. This was all
I got and it is rather meagre, but the word '
augur '
came in a flash,
most deeply from my subconscious self."

" Enter the room and take second shelves from door as one
turns left. Third shelf from floor " [what follows consists of three
distinct tests which have been divided accordingly].
(A) .
" 5th book from left end ; on p. 54 see reference to South
Africa and the climate there [no]. P. 74, description of a fight [wo]."
H. G. Wells, The Dream : 3rd impression, London 1924.
(B) .
" 7th book from left end ; p. 5, descriptions towards the
bottom which might apply to Mr Besterman's adventures while
travelling on the Continent for the S.P.R. [no]. On pp. 7 and 8
names of his parents and of a sister now passed on [wo]." H. G.
Wells, The Invisible Man : London 1897.
(C) .
" 10th book from left end ; p. 84, reference to political con-
troversies of last century [there is an allusion to suffragettes]." H. G.
Wells, Marriage : London 1912.
[10].
" Go to the bookcase nearest the fireplace and to the left of
it. Take the second row from the left, and the third book from the
right-hand end. On p. 113 you will find a reference to the sea [no]
(or to something beginning with the letter C 1) [yes, the name Crofts].
I get the name Lynton [no]—or is it Bournemouth ? [wo]." Bernard
Shaw, Mrs Warren's Profession : London 1913. This book is paged
[ii]. xxxvi. [157]-235. The success indicated occurs when the pages
are counted from p. [i] ; counted from p. i there is no success ; counted
from p. [157] there is no p. 113.
[11]. "I have no confidence in this myself—but there may be
something in it. At one period of '
abstraction '
it came to me that
121] Further Inquiries into Element of Chance in Boohtests 63
on the 2nd shelf (from bottom) on page 73 of the 3rd book from left
wall, facing North, some relevant message would be found. I don't
know Mr Besterman's library at all, but the position seemed clear.
Later I tried again to get the sort of message, and what came to me
was either (1) some reference, direct or indirect, to the late Edward
Clodd or his line of thought, (2) or to the conquest of mind over
matter, (3) or some thought generally relevant to your investiga-
tions." [It is impossible to determine which bookcase corresponds most
closely to the indications given ; but the tests do not apply to the appro-
priate booh in any bookcase.]
[12].
" I much regret that I have practically nothing of interest
to report. I find that when one consciously tries to do these things,
the faculty won't work ! The only suo-conscious impressions I have
had are, that one of Mr Besterman's bookcases is on the right of the
window in the front room [yes]. And the names '
Sophonisba '
(a
poem) and '
Pbny '
have floated about in my mind. When trying
the experiment consciously I would make a guess that there is a book
on a shelf about 4 feet 6" up from the floor—near the middle
page 52—right hand side, half way down, which has to do with the
aforesaid names [no]."
[13].
" Oval—orphan. Case right of fireplace well bound leather
books [no]. 3rd shelf from top, 2nd book from right, 10th line, p. 36.
I think oval to do with an orphan [no]." Edgar Allan Poe, Tales
of Mystery and Imagination : Everyman's Library, London 1912.
[14]. " Single shelf of books in a sitting-room, rather high up on
the wall [no]. 4th book from the left. Green cover. On page 41,
reference to stars and anemones."
[15]. " Bookshelves on right of fireplace. Third shelf from bottom,
third book from the left end, p. 57—(or p. 348) about one third of
page from bottom. Mention of a subject of great mutual interest
to self and a departed friend [no]." H. Gr. Wells, Ann Veronica :
London 1909.
[16 (A)]. " There are three lots of books in the room [yes], one
large bookcase and two smaller lots of shelves [yes]. The test is
from the large bookcase, and I think this case stands between a
door and a window, against the wall that runs between the door
and a window [yes].
" The test book is on the second shelf from the bottom, the second
row of books, there are mostly dark coloured books in that shelf,
a lot of dark blue and black books [no]. The test book is a red book
or is close to a bright red book. It may be a dark red book close
to a bright red one or it may be bright red itself. It is the ninth
(9th) book counting from the left end of the shelf ; it is a largish
64 Further Inquiries into Element of Chance in Booktests [part
book, the size of a '
memoir '
or of Axel Munthe's '
Story of San
Michele '
and not a thin book either, it is rather bulky [all these
particulars are true of the 9th book from the right]. The test is at the
very top of the 14th page, not more than half an inch from the top
in any case ; a reference to something sour, acid, perhaps fruit or
an acid drink [no] and on the 111th (one hundred and eleventh) page,
half way down, an allusion to the Last Judgment [no]. Quite near
the test book, or it may even be touching it, a small thin dark book
with a white spine label is lying along the top of the other books,
poetry, I think [true again, calculated from the 9th book from the
riglit]."
[17]. " A row of books in Mr Besterman's flat, on a level with
his shoulder. The sixth book from the extreme left of the row.
Page sixty-one—about the middle of the page. A reference to a
tree or trees, or to a picture of a tree or trees [not correct of any
bookcase].
[19]. "I once had an impression of a book with an unusual blue
cloth binding—and if anything else was indicated it would be the
second shelf down—3rd book from left—but it was all very vague
[not correct of any bookcase].
1 '
[20]. " I entered the room and made my way across it to the wall
facing the door where there were books. I had noticed gaps on the
lower shelves [yes] but I looked along a row of books between 5 and
6 feet from the ground from which I noticed a book had been taken
[no]. Next to the gap and to the right of it I took a book and turned
it over to page 27. Hitherto the feeling of heat or cold had not
occurred to me but reading down the page of which I remember
nothing I had the feeling of extreme warmth. I noticed some music
being played somewhere, and, as I was leaving, the word Taormina
suddenly occurred to me, but it seemed to have no connection with
anything at all."
[24]. " Her only idea was '
A book about roses, lying on a big
round table '
[no]."
It will be seen that in this experiment, although it was conducted
with subjects who, for one reason or another, might be expected to
score successes above the average, in only three instances were any
hits made at all approaching an evidential standard. These are
numbers 5 (Mrs Salter), 9 (the Rev. C. Drayton Thomas), and 16
(Lady Troubridge). 1
These three percipients were therefore asked
to give a further series of tests under similar conditions, and kindly
agreed to do so. Mrs Salter's further tests were as follows :
1
It is to be noted that these three percipients are amongst those who have
had the widest experience of booktests.

(B) .
" The 23rd book from the left on the same shelf as the book
of my first test, the 60th page [there is none], at the top—about

(F). " At the very top shelf of bookcase is a small, fat, black,
book, like a prayer book, or bible, but I think a prayer book, very
bulgy and shabby and stuffed in between larger books [wo]."
(Gr). " A red book, the binding not shiny or smooth—rather rough
to the touch ; on pages 6 and seven facing each other, half way
down page and almost touching two references to affection, union
[no] ;
possibly the words '
love '
and '
friendship '
[no]. This is a
book of a rather spiritistic tendency dealing with belief in reunion
after death. I do not know what shelf this book is on, only that it
is in that bookcase [there are two books in the bookcase answering to
the general description : Lydia W. Allison, Leonard and Soule Experi-
ments in Psychical Research (1929) and John F. Thomas, Case
Studies bearing upon Survival (1929)].
It is very difficult to estimate in concrete terms the results of this
experiment, and to compare them with those obtained in actual
booktests. This difficulty is chiefly due to the very vague and general
nature of most of the experimental tests quoted above. We can,
however, note that of the 38 booktests, comprising, so far as it is
possible to count them, 113 separate indications, only five can be
described as evidential hits. These are 5A (colour of book), 5E
(earthenware and cups), 9C (suffragettes), 9D (old-time feuds and
sea), and 16A (general description of bookcase and inverted descrip-
tion of book). Of these, the only one that is comparable with a good
Leonard booktest is 5E. It is obvious, in short (especially when it
is remembered that Mrs Sidgwick estimated Feda's booktests to be
successful to the extent of about 36%),1
that in this experiment
chance, even under the most favourable circumstances, did not pro-
duce results even remotely approaching those obtained by Mrs
Leonard. 2
II
The other experiment alluded to, that in which Mrs Sidgwick's
original inquiry into chance was repeated on a larger scale, has now
to be described. This was also carried out with the books in my
flat. I sent a list of the numbers 1 to 26, the number of full shelves
in my flat, to three members of the Society, Miss Ina Jephson, Mr
C. E. Bechhofer Roberts, and Mr H. F. Saltmarsh. Without telling
1 Mrs Henry Sidgwick, op. ext., xxxi. 245-6 n.
2
This, of course, is simply another way of saying that the odds against the
purely chance occurrence of Feda's results are very heavy.
68 Further Inquiries into Element of Chance in Booldests [part
them the object of the request, I asked them to place against each
number a figure not higher than twenty, followed by an L or an K.
In this way I obtained 78 references, the number 26, for instance,
followed by 9L, meaning the ninth book from the left on shelf
number 26. Miss Newton then came to my flat with the three lists,
determined at random to which shelves the numbers should apply,
and performed the laborious task of writing against each reference
the name of the book to which it was found to apply.
In the meanwhile I had asked Mrs Salter to select three actual
booktests suitable for the purpose of the experiment. The three
tests she chose are all from Mrs Sidgwick's paper, and are here
summarised for convenience.
Booldest i
Feda said that in the second paragraph of page 71, or about the
middle of the page, would be found a message, of which she said
that
" ( 1
) It refers to a past condition.
" (2) But has also an application to the present.
" (3) It is an answer to a thought which was much more in your
mind at one time than it is now,—a question which was once much
in your mind, but is not now, especially since you have known Feda.
" (4) On the opposite page [p. 70] is a reference to fire.
" (5) On the opposite side [p. 72] is a reference to light.
" (6) On the opposite side is a reference to olden times.—These
have nothing to do with the message but are just tests that you have
the right page.
" (7) On the same page or opposite page or perhaps over the leaf
[pp. 70-72] a very important word beginning with S."
In the original experiment all these seven indications were verified.
The second paragraph (stanza) proved to be part of a poem by
Oliver Wendell Holmes :
" The weary pilgrim slumbers,
His resting place unknown,
His hands were crossed, his lids were closed,
The dust was o'er him strown ;
The drifting soil, the mouldering leaf
Along the sod were blown,
His mound has melted into Earth
His memory lives alone."
These lines
(1) Pv-efer to early settlers in America, that is, to " a past con-
dition."
12l] Further Inquiries into Element of Chance in Booktests 69
(2) They have an application to the present, in that they answer
the sitter's doubts about the burial of the communicator.
(3) The sitter wrote :
" It was a question in my mind constantly
at one time whether it would be possible to identify the spot with
the help of the officers present, and when the war was over to mark
it with a cross. I have thought very little of that lately and have
not felt concerned as I did at first that his grave was unmarked and
unknown."
(4) On the opposite page occur the lines :
" Still shall the fiery pillar's ray
Along the pathway shine."
(5) There are several references to light on p. 72 :
" flaming,"
" sunlight," and others.
(6) The whole page contains a poem descriptive of a paddle
steamer. 1
(7) The above-mentioned poem, called " The Steamboat." 2
For the purpose of the experiment I have assumed that (3) applies
to me, and that the test of importance in (7) should be importance
in the context.
Boohtest ii
This test ran as follows :
" On page what is called one four of
this book, fourteen, wait a minute, something made her feel, gave
her a feeling of heat, something hot, heat, half way down that page.
But she'd better explain, it might come from two sources, it might
come from a mention of heat, like a hot sun, or a hot fire, or it might
come from a mention of great anger, but spoken of as heat ; . . .
"
In the actual booktest Feda's indications were verified by the
occurrence of the words " ardent patriot." 3
Booktest Hi
In this test Feda said :
" Page 15 of the same book, half way down or a little above
perhaps, it speaks—wait a minute, speaks—do you want to give
the position exactly 1 He's making a line across half way down the
1
My verification of (5) and (6) differs from that of the sitter. This is due
to the fact that the latter treated " opposite page " and " opposite side " as
synonymous, whereas I think that the former refers to p. 70 and the latter to
p. 72. However, I examined a copy of the book in question in the British
Museum, and found, as can be seen above, that Feda's indications apply
almost as well to p. 72 as to p. 70. The score is not affected. In the next
item (7) there is another difference, and this time one that does affect the score,
in Feda's favour. The sitter regarded this as a failure, but I agree with Mrs
Sidgwick in thinking that it may reasonably be regarded as a success.

page, and the position is about a quarter of an inch above that line,
he's got a reason for doing that, on that line, a quarter of an inch
above half way down that page, there is a word or words ... a long
pole . . . I've got to say those words, and he's pretending to show
me a long, long pole in his hand. (Feda indicates by gesture with
extended arm some one grasping a long upright pole or stick.)
[Sitter: Like a staff ?] It's sticking up and it looks straight. (Again
indicates holding on to a perpendicular stick.) But there's some-
thing at the top what takes off the straightness ..."
At the place indicated was foimd the word " pole," which the
context showed to be a long alpenstock ; but there is no reference
to anything at the top taking away from the straightness.1
It will be seen that these three booktests are particularly suitable
for the purpose of our experiment. The first one contains seven
separate indications, none of them particularly evidential, spread
over three pages. The second test gives a specific but abstract and
not very evidential indication on a particular part of a page. And
in the third booktest a concrete and highly evidential indication is
given referring to a very exactly described position on the page.
The results of submitting these three actual booktests to chance
verification in the manner explained, are now tabulated.

Q
92 Further Inquiries into Element of Chance in Booktests [part
It is possible to bring out the meaning of these results in a more
or less accurate way. To do so it is only necessary to determine
the estimated odds against Feda's indications (pp. 68-70 above) being
verified by chance, to determine the relative value of the successes
obtained in the actual booktests, and similarly to evaluate the
successes obtained by chance, as set out in the above table. This
has been done in Tables II and III. In the former of these the
seven separate indications of booktest i are dealt with, and in the
latter Table booktests i (as a whole), ii, and iii are considered. The
values of the various tests have been estimated as accurately as
possible with the available data. 1
But it must be emphasised that
the comparative value of the figures obtained in this way is not
affected by the accuracy of the estimated odds, since the same odds
are applied to the actual booktests and to the 80 artificial ones.
1
If the experiment had been on a larger scale it would have been necessary
to take various points into consideration which have been here ignored. It
might then be doubtful, for instance, whether the seven indications in book-
test i should be combined by simple multiplication.

Thus we see that in this experiment also chance produces far
worse results than does Feda, even though the chance results have
been scored very lavishly.
A subsidiary use, though a very interesting and significant one,
which can be made of these Tables, is a comparison of the estimated
chance probabilities, shown at the head of Tables II and III, with
the actual probabilities indicated by the eighty chance booktests.
The comparison is set out below.

From this comparison we see first that in each of the seven indi-
cations of booktest i, and in booktest ii, the chance probabilities
were estimated with very fair accuracy, indeed, in several cases
with striking accuracy. On the other hand, the value of the long
pole indication (booktest iii) was so difficult to estimate that I con-
sulted several experts, all of whose estimated values greatly ex-
ceeded my own estimate of 1/300. Yet we see that in 89 chance
tests a complete success 1
was obtained in two instances (producing
a chance probability of 1/44-5), while in three other cases some
approximate success was obtained. This tends to show, I think,
that whereas it is possible to trust to commonsense in scoring
matters of common observation, this is not so in more unusual tests,
in which it is consequently impossible to be too conservative. 2
I think we may reasonably sum up by saying that all the control
experiments in booktests so far devised strongly indicate the pre-
sence of some extra-chance factor in the booktests given by Mrs
Leonard.
1
A complete success, that is, if we score chance on the generous lines I have
followed. In fact, the word " pole " does not actually occur in either of these
two hits.
2
Table II also illustrates the inadequacy of a mere enumeration of successes
without giving the successes a value. Thus, over the whole of the 560 indica-
tions analysed in Table II, chance has been successful in about 28% of cases.
But when we realise that the figure is made up of successes most of which
have a very small value, this percentage loses its impressiveness.
REVIEW
Transactions of the Fourth International Congress for Psychical
Research. Edited by Theodore Besterman. 8vo, pp. iii. 259,
2 plates. London : Society for Psychical Research, 1930.
Price 7s. 6d. net.
The series of International Congresses for Psychical Research, as
objectively perpetuated in their Transactions, appears more and
more clearly to be serving a real purpose in the advancement of our
subject. The first Congress in 1921 may have suggested that the
desire for marvels was stronger than the desire for research. The
excellent report of the Groningen psychologists on their experiments
in telepathy seemed, for example, strangely out of tune with the
general trend. At the second Congress, the dread of creating a
similar impression resulted in the passing of a resolution protesting
against the popular confusion of spiritualism with psychical research.
It is to be doubted whether this declaration served the intended
purpose. But that Brugmans, representing the Groningen group,
again presented a detailed report, and that a few serious papers were
read, served to save this Congress also from absolute failure. That
the third, held in Paris in 1927, was able to lift itself from this level,
is attributable in large part to the wisdom of certain French col-
leagues, especially, I believe, to the astuteness of M. Warcollier's
analysis of telepathic phenomena. This Congress gave definite
promise that such meetings might help to keep us nearer together.
The fourth Congress, as judged from its Transactions, has done
better still. There are not many papers which betray that non-
chalance so evident at the first two Congresses. The theoretical
papers are offered by competent philosophers and scientists, who
understand the intricate problems with which they deal. Several
reports of cases are vivid, interesting, and cogent ; and some of the
reports of experimental work are serious contributions, inviting the
closest perusal and the most serious analysis and reflection.
Philosophical papers are presented by Driesch, Oesterreich, and
Schneider, among others ; these undertake to show the implications
of contemporary biology, psychology, and epistemology for the inter-
pretation of supernormal phenomena. Oesterreich's papers are
particularly able presentations of epistemological and psychological
theory. The fact that the transference of an idea which is not at
99
100 Review [part
the time in the agent's consciousness involves more difficulties than
can at present be solved either by brain-wave, spiritistic, or Kantian
theories is cogently shown in a few of Oesterreich's sentences ; the
same problem arises later in reading Tanagra's paper on telepathic
impressions received from an unconscious stratum of the agent's
mind. It is of interest to see that really serious philosophers have
here been willing to give our problems time and thought. In par-
ticular, Husserl's phenomenology is sketched by Oesterreich in such
a way as to suggest that serious consideration of the problem of the
nature of knowledge is in order even in the most immediately
pressing aspects of our work.
Among the papers on method and procedure, the most impressive
is Mr Salter's direct challenge to all who know of any physical
phenomena the serious investigation of which they desire. He pro-
poses nothing less than that the International Congress Committee
should formulate standard conditions of control applicable to the
different classes of controllable phenomena, by which the bona fides
of mediums can be ascertained and conditions for serious research
for students of physical phenomena made available ;
furthermore,
that mediums refusing to work under control conditions be no longer
discussed in psychical publications. That this would fulfil a crying
need can scarcely be doubted by anyone who has followed the dismal
story of the physical phenomena of the last dozen years. Disagree-
able facts about the Schneider brothers have been getting more and
more plentiful, and by 1927 the Valiantine and Margery cases had
gone their way into that limbo to which the repeatedly exposed
medium is assigned, since no more torrid region is available. The
importance of Mr Salter's suggestions can only be realized by one
who will peruse any of the various journals in which physical pheno-
mena play a large part, or by those few distressing articles in the
present Transactions which proceed exactly as if the last dozen
years had taught us nothing. Reports on various marvels appear
to have been offered at the Athens Congress without so much as a
description of the control used, the aching void being plugged with
phrases to the effect that the persons making the inquiry were of
the utmost scientific integrity, or that the person reading the report
had seen the phenomena himself. Among the many new cases
which are reported are one involving supernormal knowledge about
the details of a murder, one regarding levitation among the der-
vishes, and one on prolonged experiments with Frau S. of Breslau.
The cases are reported too inadequately to justify any definite im-
pression. Mr Salter's comment on the desirability of excluding
unauthenticated cases from psychic publications might, I think, be
held to apply to the transactions of psychic congresses.
These strictures are perhaps a little too severe in relation to the
121] Review 101
exciting poltergeist reported by Baron von Winterstein. The
account is a typical and a good poltergeist story. One finishes the
reading of it without any idea in the world how the. dry plaster got
into the hair of the sitters, how the saucer was broken without the
cup being moved, how objects were hurled and faces drenched.
True, but one also conies away from a performance by a good con-
jurer, having seen such things in full light and not knowing how
they happened except that they did not happen supernormally. I
do not argue that the lady in question was a fraud ; in fact, I am
unable to believe she was. But to report and to publish such a case
adds nothing whatever to our science.
Were the circumstances but slightly different, I should have to
say the same about Mr Feilding's account of the bleeding pictures
and the bleeding Host of the Abbe Vachere. How the things could
have happened which Mr Feilding saw happen, or which his friend
saw happen, is entirely beyond my imagination. Did pictures of
Christ actually ooze blood, in quantities frequently copious, or did
the Host upon the Altar pour forth so much blood that it had to
be soaked up with cloths ? The water-pot which appears in one
part of the narrative as the guilty party seems too weak an accom-
plice to have done much. I venture to think that cases of this sort,
at which we throw up our hands in the knowledge that any con-
clusion whatever is unwarranted, are probably good for us in the
present state of our ignorance. One such case competently and
patiently pursued, as this was, is valuable if for no other reason
than to remind us of the complexity of the kinds of evidence with
which we have to deal.
Sir Oliver Lodge and Mr Besterman discuss the status of psychical
research and the reasons for its failure to gain recognition from the
majority of the scientific world. Both seem to incline to the opinion
that the phenomena are so complicated as to have precluded the
possibility of rapid and definitive advances from one stage to another,
such as marks the orderly progress of most sciences. Mr Besterman,
in fact, undertakes to show most concretely that public sentiment
during the half century has gradually become more friendly. His
case, in relation to the attitude of the reading public, is strong ; but
as regards the existence of any visible trend of this sort in the
scientific world, I must sadly dissent. Surely the science most
directly related to psychical research is psychology. I doubt whether
a daily visitor to laboratories of psychology, with an opportunity
to live in and breathe their intellectual atmosphere, would venture
to suggest that the academic halls echo with gentler taunts than
those which greeted Sidgwick and Myers in 1882. Mr Besterman
implies that the situation is better in the United States, reporting
that " the psychological departments of two American universities
102 Review [part
(Harvard and Leland Stanford) have sections specifically dealing
with psychical research, and another (Clark) recently organised a
course of lectures on the case for and against our subject "
(p. 119).
Having participated in two of the three academic adventures de-
scribed here, I beg to be allowed my gasp of protest. A small fellow-
ship does exist in Harvard, enough to give half-time work to a
graduate student, but for several reasons which will occur to the
reader, it is vacant a good deal of the time. If Mr Besterman has
studied the publications resulting from the Stanford inquiries, I
wonder why he avoided reference to the peculiar circumstances
attending the fellowship there 1 The lectures at Clark included dis-
courses by such authorities as Dr L. R. G. Crandon. Psychical
researchers may be grateful that the series attracted no more atten-
tion than it did.
Psychical research, as Sir Oliver Lodge's candid title makes clear,
is not generally recognized by scientists, and he points out some of
the reasons. Probably the first reason is the attempt of science to
get a unified view of the world, and the desire of psychologists to
assimilate their data to those of the systematized physical and bio-
logical sciences. Psychology, one might say, is a closed fortress
which casual arrows are not likely to penetrate, and new towers are
constantly being built which are harder and harder to hit. In the
second place, psychical research, with all respect to the many fine
minds which have contributed to it, presents a bewildering mass of
authenticated and half-authenticated odds and ends, the basic laws
of which can only be dimly divined. We play upon corners of a
vast and bewildering domain, conceiving that the accumulation of
more facts will somehow advance our subject. New cases are con-
stantly published while we forget those published earlier. Psychical
research would, under favourable circumstances, be regarded by the
scientific world as ethnology would be regarded if it consisted chiefly
of accounts of the megaliths or spades of particular peoples, or the
way in which they form the pluperfect tense in ceremonial language.
We suffer from a plethora of undigested and indigestible data.
Such progress as we have made is, for the most part, directly
attributable to the systematic thinking-out and testing of hypo-
theses. Consider, for example, Mrs Sidgwick's early hypotheses
regarding haimtings, and regarding the nature of trance communi-
cation, and the several hypotheses regarding telepathy published in
Phantasms of the Living and in Myers's Human Personality. Such
hypotheses have constantly guided and systematized investigations
regarding telepathic and mediumistic phenomena. In the same
connection must be reported the remarkable series of methodical
hypotheses and testings of hypotheses characteristic of the work of
Warcollier during the last twenty years. All these hypotheses are
121] Review 103
incompletely verified, but they, rather than bundles of detached
facts, underlie most of the progress we have made.
In the same connection it is to be noted that the present Trans-
actions report long-distance telepathic experiments, conducted by
groups at Paris, Warsaw, Vienna and Athens, which achieved a level
of brilliance hardly ever surpassed in well-authenticated work. In
the analysis of the results Dr Konstantinides has shown that he is
alert to an array of psychological problems which usually appear
in connection with telepathic phenomena, presenting the data in
such form as to permit the reader to verify for himself some of the
interesting points which Warcollier and earlier workers have empha-
sized. Of special interest is the fragmentation of the telepathic
image, the " contagion " among percipients, the substitution of con-
crete for abstract elements, and the appearance, through some link
on a subconscious level, of items associated with the object chosen
for transmission. In other words, the present series is not a mere
reporting of facts ; it is a critical consideration of the special psycho-
logical phenomena manifesting themselves through these facts. On
the other hand, it is most regrettable that the investigators appear
to have been indifferent to the special mental and physical con-
ditions of individual persons from one experiment to another, and
have made no effort to discover the reasons for successes in some
cases and failures in others. The difficulty is accentuated by the
fact that statistical control of the results is not undertaken at all.
Certain implications of all this seem pertinent to the plans for the
Congress to be held in London next year. If the international com-
mittees, and the British Committee in particular, merely undertake
to improve slightly upon the general scientific level of the Fourth
Congress, the result will be disheartening. If, in a generous desire
to further international co-operation, the S.P.R. permits badly con-
trolled or incompletely reported phenomena to be described, the
reaction of the British public will, of course, be unfavourable. From
a scientific point of view, there is a further problem, namely, the
danger that mere observations of cases, disjecta membra thrown out
in some spasm of nature and failing to give us any new insight, be
given preference over material which permits such interpretation as
would serve definitely to credit or discredit some working hypo-
thesis. I have already indicated personal partiality for some of the
theories of Myers and of Mrs Sidgwick, but I should not wish to
suggest that any hypothesis seriously thought out and pertinent to
any group of facts should be taboo. Such bewildering data as con-
front us justify leaps in the dark, and even a poor hypothesis,
honestly pursued, should, it seems to me, be given precedence over
papers which merely report more observations. I am aware that
this plea will arouse dissent ; I ask only that it receive a hearing.
104 Review [part 121
If one corner of our vast terrain were explored in truly workmanlike
fashion with order and thoroughness, and its laws experimentally or
statistically ascertained, we should do a very great deal for psychical
research. The present Transactions show that we are doing too
much and not doing it well.
Would it not be wise to consider now whether the scientific
standards for papers to be admitted should not be considerably
raised ? If first-class research work with experimental or other pro-
perly observed phenomena were presented in such fashion as to lay
bare the principles underlying them, the repercussion upon the
scientific world would be considerable. As indicated above, one such
new contribution has been offered at each of the four congresses.
Would it not be appropriate that the jubilee of the S.P.R. should
be marked by a greater abundance of reports of this sort ? Serious
scientific work could make up the entire programme at London if
so desired ;
or, if there is really not enough such work, could not
the programme be made short and the remaining time be given to
round-table discussions of methods of research ? Our obligation to
avoid olfence to certain individuals or groups is very much less
pressing than our obligation to make clear to critical and scientific
minds "what sort of scientific standards we aim to achieve.

IS PROOF OF SURVIVAL POSSIBLE ?
I. IS PROOF OF SURVIVAL POSSIBLE ?
1
By H. F. Saltmarsh.
The object of this paper is to inquire how far any type of evidence
dealt with in psychical research can afford proof of the survival
of human personality if it were to be found in an ideally perfect
form.
I am going to suppose that there is an example of each particular
type of phenomenon so well established from the evidential point
of view, so clear cut and free from embarrassing complications, that
no question as to the facts can be raised. For example, if we speak
of telekinesis I shall assume that a material object has actually been
moved without contact, if we attribute supernormal knowledge to
a medium I shall take it for granted that all normal channels whereby
the knowledge might have been acquired were completely blocked.
That this is not so in actual experience few will be disposed to
deny : our grain is always mixed with chaff and requires much
sifting and cleansing before being fit to use, but by making the
above assumptions the purely logical critique of the position is
rendered easier.
There is one preliminary point which requires attention. In what
sense do we use the word proof ?
It is a word of great elasticity of meaning, ranging from the
absolute or apodeictic proof such as some claim to find in mathe-
matics, down to the legal meaning, as when counsel says that a
witness will " prove " so and so.
Nowadays absolute or apodeictic proof is somewhat out of
fashion ; mathematical physicists, and even some mathematicians,
have abated their pretensions to attain to absolute truth and are
satisfied with, in fact prefer, the high probability afforded by
statistical law.
This is not the place to enter into any discussion of the question
whether absolute proof is ever attainable, more particularly so as
truth derived from the data of experience can never claim a higher
validity than extreme probability.
I am perfectly convinced that I see an object in the sky (called
the moon), yet it is theoretically possible that I may be hallucinated,
that everybody who tells me that they also see this object may also
1

h 105
106 H. F. Saltmarsh [part
be hallucinated or else deliberately lying, that all confirmatory
evidence, such as photographs of the object in question, which I
think I see, are either hallucinations or fakes. It is highly improbable
that this is so, but as it is theoretically possible, it follows that
absolute certainty is not attainable.
In the same way, so long as it is theoretically possible for a man
to lie and to be hallucinated or otherwise deceived, no evidence of
survival can possibly afford absolute proof. The nearest approach
which I could attain to this would be for me actually to find myself
surviving after death, yet even then I should presumably have to
rely on my memory of having undergone physical death, and
memory often plays false. Anyhow I could not communicate the
proof to anyone else. It would be a purely subjective proof, hence
not of scientific validity. The only fact of which I am absolutely
certain is that I am conscious at the present moment. This I cannot
doubt, for the fact of doubting in itself involves or implies conscious-
ness. I can, however, if I please, doubt all else.
High probability, then, is all that we can hope for in this as in
all other matters, but we need not be disturbed by this fact, since,
as Eddington says, " Proof is an idol before whom the pure mathe-
matician tortures himself. In physics we are generally content to
sacrifice before the lesser shrine of Plausibility." 1
What we have to see, then, is not whether the phenomena
investigated by psychical research prove survival, but how far they
establish its plausibility. Alternative explanations are always
theoretically possible ; what we have to decide is how far they are
probable.
We can start the inquiry by dividing the. phenomena into two
classes, the physical and the mental. We will consider the physical
first.
These are the phenomena where some event happens involving
a physical object, such as the movement of a solid body, the pro-
duction of light, sound or heat waves, the extrusion of teleplasm,
and so on. There must also be included in the physical group those
cases where the only material object involved is the body of the
medium ;
examples of these would be levitation, immunity from
hurt when handling hot coals, etc., also such phenomena as changes
of voice, gesture and handwriting.
Now it is clear that in order that events of this kind should have
any value as evidence of survival they must possess some char-
acteristic which will connect them with some deceased person. The
bare fact that a material object is moved in a way we cannot account
for by normal means does not afford any clue to the identity of
the agent. All we could say in the most favourable circumstances
1
Nature of the Physical Universe, p. 337.
122] Is Proof of Survival Possible ? 107
would be that some unknown agency is involved and that that
agency exhibits intelligence ; we could not argue that it was, or
ever had been, human, still less that it was connected with some
one particular person.
Thus when any special characteristics which might connect them
with a deceased person are absent, we can rule out physical phe-
nomena as completely unevidential of survival. Where, however,
the phenomena show some special characteristics which connect
them with some definite deceased person, any evidential value for
survival rests entirely on those characteristics.
The chief forms of special characteristics are when teleplasm
forms some recognisable likeness such as a face, when the matter is
impressed in a recognisable way as with a fingerprint, when the
direct writing reproduces a recognised handwriting or signature,
and the direct voice a recognised voice. The two last may be
paralleled in the type of phenomenon in which the medium's body
alone is involved, as when the medium's hand writes in a recognisable
handwriting or her voice reproduces a recognisable voice. To these
may be added those cases where the medium uses recognisable
gestures.
The argument for survival from such phenomena would apparently
run somewhat as follows. Special characteristics, such as facial
features, fingerprints, handwriting, voice and gesture, belonging to
a deceased person, are reproduced by a medium who is normally
ignorant of these details ; the source of the knowledge must there-
fore be outside her ; and the original owner is most likely to be that
source.
Now the most ardent enthusiast for physical phenomena would
hardly claim that this argument is a strong one, and I think that a
little criticism will suffice to deprive it of most of what cogency it
appears at first sight to possess.
First of all, there must always be an alternative source from
which the medium might draw the information, allowing, of course,
the use of telepathy and clairvoyance. The characteristics to be
evidential must be verifiable ; it follows, therefore, that the infor-
mation concerning them must be in the possession of some one
living or else recorded somewhere. A more detailed discussion of
this point may be postponed until mental phenomena are under
discussion. Secondly, the evidential characteristics are all repro-
ductions, the original having presumably been destroyed by death.
Now there are in existence several agencies of reproduction, e.g. an
artist can reproduce a face, as in a picture, photography can be
employed for the same end or to reproduce fingerprints, hand-
writing can be imitated by a forger, voice and gesture by a clever
mimic.
108 H. F. Saltmarsh [part
On. the assumption that such phenomena occur it cannot be
denied that the medium has the power to produce teleplasm in the
form of faces, for she actually does do so, just as an artist has the
power to produce pictures of faces. If the teleplasm can take the
form of a face it can presumably take the form of any face. If the
medium can make the imprint of a hand, other than her own,
appear on a mould, she can presumably form that imprint how she
pleases. We have no idea of the mechanism employed and there
may be conditions which limit the medium's powers in this matter,
but we cannot legitimately use our ignorance of the conditions as
premises in an argument to establish a definite proposition, i.e. the
agency of a surviving personality.
There is one further point. All these characteristics originally
depended on a highly complex arrangement of the skin, muscles,
nerves, etc., of the living body of the deceased person. This arrange-
ment was broken up at death and the material scattered. In order
to be reproduced this material must be reassembled in its original
form or a facsimile made out of other material. Is there any reason
for holding that the person who originally owned that body is the
only or even the most likely agent who could do this reassembling ?
I am inclined to think that this is not so.
Those about me must have a much greater familiarity with my
facial appearance than I have myself, my habitual gestures are
largely unconscious, and I doubt very much whether I should not
experience surprise at hearing my voice on a gramophone. I
certainly should not recognise my own fingerprint. As regards
handwriting the case is different. I myself am much more familiar
with my own writing than anyone else can be, but my familiarity
is with the appearance of it, not with the mechanism of its pro-
duction, which is largely unconscious. This may be an individual
peculiarity of my own, but I find that if I purposely think of the
movements of my hand in signing my name I almost invariably
make a bad signature, also that when writing normally my thoughts
are concentrated on the matter about which I am writing, and not
at all on the formation of the letters. The experience of others may
possibly be different in this matter.
Were it possible for me to use an unfamiliar mechanism, such as
the organism of a medium, I see no reason to suppose that my
handwriting would be unchanged. In actual fact we know that
lesion of the nerves or muscles of the writing hand may cause
complete change in the writing. It seems to me that there are
weighty/arguments against the proposition that the agency which
enables the medium to reproduce these characteristics of a deceased
human being is the surviving consciousness of that person. That
consciousness would probably not possess the requisite knowledge.
122] Is Proof of Survival Possible ? 109
The only hypothesis which, in my opinion, renders it at all plausible
is the theosophical theory of " etheric doubles ". These are said
to be exact replicas of the material body constructed of some
rarefied material stuff, called ether : they persist for some time after
physical death and can be partially revitalised.
I must not give space to go further into the details of this theory
but will simply point out that there is, so far as I know, not one jot
of reliable independent evidence of the existence of etheric doubles,
and that to create ad hoc an entirely new type of entity solely for
the purpose of bolstering up an otherwise wobbly hypothesis is
logically inadmissible. As a result of these considerations I conclude
that the evidence for survival derivable from any of the types of
physical phenomena here mentioned is of the slightest description ;
it amounts to no more than a suggestion.
I turn now to the mental phenomena.
These consist in the communication by the medium of in-
formation not normally accessible to him, or the reproduction or
description of psychological characteristics of some personality alien
to him.
Seeing that the hypothesis of survival postulates the continued
existence of the personality of the deceased and that personality
implies some continuity of memory and psychological character-
istics, the objections raised in the discussion on physical phenomena
do not apply. If the possibility of direct communication between
mind and mind, as in telepathy, is admitted, there is no logical
objection to holding that the agency which enables the medium to
produce these phenomena is the surviving personality. It would
have the requisite knowledge.
We can subdivide the mental phenomena into two types, viz., the
giving of information and the reproduction of psychological char-
acteristics. Information can be of past, present or future events,
psychological characteristics can be either forms of thought, which
would include habitual associations of ideas, or forms of speech.
Description of mental and moral characteristics would, of course,
be included under the heading of information. Consider first
information.
The argument for survival would be somewhat as follows. The
medium exhibits knowledge normally inaccessible to him ; we
admit the possibility of telepathy by means of which information
can be transferred direct from mind to mind and that the deceased
possessed the requisite knowledge ; therefore if consciousness
survives, it would be a possible source from which the medium
derived the information. Provided there is no other possible
source, it follows that mind, or some fragment of mind such as
memory, survives death.
110 H. F. Saltmarsh [part
In my report on the Warren Elliott sittings (Proceedings, xxxix.
172 ff.), I put forward my reasons for not accepting the theory that
what, if anything, survives is only the memory or a fragment of
the memory of the deceased. It is unnecessary to repeat these
here, and I will assume that the theory is rejected.
It is obvious that the proviso as to other possible sources of the
information is the crux of the whole argument.
Now it is logically impossible to prove a negative in such matters,
for to do so one would need a thorough knowledge of all possibility,
which is equivalent to omniscience. The most we could do is to
show that no other possibility is actually known and that it is
unlikely that, did it exist, it would be overlooked.
In actual fact other possible sources of the information must
always, from the nature of the case, be available. For the facts to
be evidential must be verifiable, that is to say, the information
must be capable of being checked from some independent source
and could, therefore, have been derived from that source.
A strong case for survival, however, could still be made out if it
could be shown that derivation from this alternative source was
unlikely. The strength of the case would then depend on the
degree of unlikeliness. It should, however, be noted that there is
another hypothesis covering the facts which does not appear to
imply survival in the usual sense. This is based on the suggested
relaxation of the temporal conditions under which some strata of
the minds of the sitter or medium function. For example, the
specious present of the subconsciousness might cover a much longer
period than that of the normal supraliminal consciousness and
extend back into the past over a considerable period of " time ".
This hypothesis is of a somewhat speculative nature, and what
evidence there is in support of any arguments for or against it, also
all consequences arising from its acceptance, come rather within
the province of psychology and metaphysics than of psychical
research. It will therefore be left aside.
Let us leave information concerning the past until the other two
classes have been discussed.
It is pretty clear that information concerning present events,
even if normally inaccessible to the medium, can by itself afford no
proof of survival. If the information be verifiable then there must
either be some spectators of the events and telepathy from them
could account for the facts, or else subsequent observation must
enable us to infer their occurrence. In this latter case, i.e. where
there were no actual spectators, the fact that the events were
known to the medium implies the exercise of some sort of clairvoyant
faculty on the part of some one. I do not see that there is any
strong reason for supposing it to be more likely that such a faculty
122] Is Proof of Survival Possible ? HI
should be possessed by the surviving consciousness of a deceased
person than by a consciousness still functioning through a physical
body. We have a certain amount of fairly good evidence of living
persons exercising clairvoyance, while we know nothing of the
powers of the hypothetical surviving consciousness.
It is, however, perhaps possible to bring forward some rather
speculative arguments in support of the theory that operating
through a physical organism limits the powers of the psychical
entity which is the true man, and that, therefore, one might expect
that a disembodied mind would exhibit wider powers than one
embodied.
Even if this were admitted, it would not prove that the disem-
bodied mind had ever been embodied and had survived physical
death. Clairvoyance would not be evidence of survival but only of
spirit agency.
As regards prediction, except in cases of prediction based on
inference from the past, it is so difficult to form any idea of how
this can be possible that even if the fact were established little use
could be made of it as a datum. It is a phenomenon so inexplicable,
so utterly out of joint with the rest of our experience, that it stands
alone ; we cannot establish connections between it and any other
phenomenon.
It might perhaps be argued with some show of reason that the
temporal conditions governing a disembodied mind must be less
rigid than those under which an embodied mind functions, but this
would not prove that the source of the prediction is a surviving
human consciousness, but only that it is a disembodied one. Pre-
diction by inference from past or present events is a phenomenon
with which we are well acquainted. It is a power possessed by
living men and rests on well known logical grounds. It may be
suggested that the apparently supernormal predictions which we
assume to have been made by the medium are due to an extended
knowledge of the data and a heightened power of inference. But
here again there is little reason for ascribing these wider faculties to
disembodied rather than to embodied minds, and none whatever
for holding that the disembodied minds, if they exist, are neces-
sarily those of deceased human beings.
The utmost we can say, then, is that supernormal knowledge of
present or future events may possibly suggest, but does not prove,
spirit agency, while affording no evidence of survival.
Let us now turn to the case where the medium gives information
concerning past events, knowledge of which was definitely inacces-
sible to him and was definitely known to have been in the possession
of the deceased person. Provided that means of communication
with the medium exist, the surviving mind of the deceased is a
112 H. F. Saltmarsh [part
possible source of the information. We have to assume telepathy,
or something like it. We have good evidence that telepathy occurs
between living persons, and it is not a very great extension to hold
that there may be direct communication between an embodied and
a disembodied mind.
But where the information is in the possession of a living person
an explanation of the phenomenon not requiring even this extension
is always available as an alternative to the survival hypothesis.
The question of psychical linkage is of importance in this con-
nection and it is on this point that the value of evidence for survival
turns. If the living person who possesses the knowledge is the actual
sitter there is an obvious link with the medium, they are already in
normal communication, and telepathy may be assumed to occur
between them. Information concerning facts within the knowledge
of the sitter is, then, of little value as evidence for survival.
Where the knowledge necessary for verification is not in the
possession of the sitter but is acquired subsequently from other
sources, the evidence for survival may be considerably stronger.
It turns on the question of the probability of the necessary con-
necting links between the medium and the possessor of the know-
ledge. If this linkage is very complex, very unlikely to occur, then
it might be argued that the balance of probability lies on the side of
the survival hypothesis. In this hypothesis we assume that the
conscious mind persists after physical death, retaining some part
of its normal memory and of its psychical characteristics, also that
it has some power of communication with embodied minds. We
must also assume that it is to some extent cognisant of, and inter-
ested in, the doings of persons still living on earth. The fact,
therefore, that a relative or friend has a sitting with a medium could
constitute the requisite link between the surviving mind and those
present at the sitting. The linkage is simple and direct, corre-
sponding, mutatis mutandis, to that between the sitter and the
medium.
On the other hand the linkage between the medium and the
living source of verification may be complex and indirect. Suppose,
for example, that the medium makes a statement which purports
to be derived from the memory of a deceased person, none of the
sitters can verify it, and inquiry among friends produces no results ;
then, by a series of unlikely and unpredictable coincidences, the
sitter becomes acquainted with a stranger who in the past had
known the deceased and obtains the desired verification from him.
The stranger had no knowledge of the sitting taking place nor of
any persons connected with it.
Now unless we are prepared to credit the medium, the sitter or
the stranger or some person en route between them, with what
122] Is Proof of Survival Possible ? 113
amounts to potential omniscience, we have to postulate a very
complex and unlikely series of links to account for the phenomenon.
If we hold that the mind of the medium goes out, as it were, in
search of information and invades the memories of living persons,
we still have to explain the fact that he discovered this hidden
source. He had the whole world in which to search and nothing to
guide him, or at least, that is how it appears to us with our very
limited, almost non-existent knowledge of the conditions.
If, on the other hand, we hold that the telepathic impulse arises
from the agent—in this case the stranger—we still have to explain
how he came to know that the sitting was taking place, what
directed his telepathic faculty to the medium and determined him
to send that particular message at that particular moment.
The value of such phenomena as evidence for survival depends,
then, on the relation between the probabilities of the two alternative
explanations, and this is a matter in which it seems that each
individual must exercise his own judgment. Estimates of the
probabilities will vary immensely. For example, anyone who had
already espoused the Behaviourist creed would place the probability
of survival at almost nil, thus prejudging the whole case, while those
who preserve an open mind on the matter will vary very much
among themselves according to their dispositions, desires, and so
on. Thus it seems to follow that to some people evidence of this
kind would appear to afford extremely high probability of survival,
for others it will give no more than a suggestion.
This arises from the fact that the value of the evidence is a
function of two independent variables, for one of which, viz. the
probability of the necessary linkage between the medium and the
source of the verification, there may be substantial agreement,
while for the other, viz. the probability of survival and the other
assumptions necessary for the application of that hypothesis,
estimates will vary to an almost unlimited degree, these estimates
depending on individual idiosyncrasy. This analysis appears to me
to account for the extraordinary difference in the interpretations
placed on the same set of facts by equally competent and honest
thinkers.
I want to make this point quite clear, as I think it is important.
If psychical phenomena could afford crucial proof of survival there
would be nothing more to be said once we had satisfied ourselves as
to the validity of the proof. But, as I have endeavoured to show,
this is not the case, the best we can expect is a probability, more or
less strong.
Now the plausibility of any hypothesis is measured by the ratio
between its probability and that of the various possible alterna-
tives.
114 H. F. Saltmarsh [part
We have, therefore, in the balance the psychical evidence affording
a certain probability to the survival hypothesis, but we have also
in the scales all arguments for and against survival derived from
other sources, also all our preconceived notions, our desires, hopes,
fears and prejudices.
Thus it may be that the psychical evidence has to force its way
against overwhelming obstacles.
There is another possible explanation which must also be borne
in mind, viz. the possibility of the information having been conveyed
telepathically by the deceased person prior to his death to some
other person, possibly the sitter, in whose subconscious mind it has
lain latent until drawn therefrom by the medium. Though this
other person were subconsciously aware of the facts, knowledge of
them would never rise into his normal consciousness ; for verifi-
cation, therefore, another source would have to be depended upon.
Our knowledge of the possibilities of the subconscious is so
limited that it is impossible to form any estimate of the probability
of this explanation in any particular case. All we can say is that it
is theoretically possible. In such cases as that known as the
Chafhn Will case, this alternative must be considered. If a sealed
envelope containing a message is deposited before death and the
contents correctly given in a purporting communication from the
deceased writer, one could explain the facts by this hypothesis of
latency. If the message were in cypher and the keyword nowhere
actually recorded, the translation of the message would appear at
first sight to constitute almost irrefragable evidence, for the
verification would depend on the success of the translation. Such a
case, which so far as I know has never yet happened, would, it is
true, bar out clairvoyance on the part of the medium or sitter but
would not exclude the latency hypothesis.
Communication of the whereabouts of objects hidden by the
deceased prior to death could also be explained on these lines ; in
fact once we admit the possibility of knowledge remaining latent in
the subconsciousness and being somehow conveyed to the medium,
no evidence based on past history can be held to point conclusively
to survival.
To make the tale complete we must also take into account the
possibility of clairvoyance on the part of the medium or sitter.
Where the information is recorded in writing, where actual physical
facts exist which could convey it or from which it might be deduced,
it is always possible to attribute the medium's acquisition of the
knowledge to clairvoyance. Here again our knowledge of the
nature, conditions and limitations of clairvoyance is so small that
we can form no estimate of the plausibility of this hypothesis ; we
can only say that there is some evidence which seems to point to
122] Is Proof of Survival Possible ? 115
the occasional existence of the clairvoyant faculty. The question of
linkage is, however, of importance and may in certain cases establish
an antecedent improbability against the clairvoyance hypothesis.
Unless we are prepared to equate the clairvoyant faculty to " the
all-seeing eye " we have to give some account of what turned the
medium's clairvoyant attention in the right direction. The faculty
may exist and the physical fact may be there, but there must be
some linkage to bring them together. This linkage may be as
complex and inherently unlikely as was seen possible in the case
of verification by " the stranger ". Such linkage would reduce very
much the probability of clairvoyance as an alternative explanation.
The position, therefore, seems to be that in all cases where the
evidence consists of communication of information concerning the
past there are always at least two alternatives to the survival
theory, first, the medium may derive the information from the
source whence verification ultimately comes either by telepathy or
clairvoyance ;
second, the information may have been conveyed
telepathically before death to some person in whose subconscious
memory it has lain latent until emerging at the sitting. The
respective probabilities of all possible explanations are extremely
difficult, if not impossible, to estimate even very roughly. It seems
to follow that, even if we do get evidence for survival, we can never
know how strong or how weak it is.
A word about cross-correspondences. These, even in their
ideally perfect form, can only afford evidence of a source extraneous
to one of the mediums employed, and perhaps of a definite purpose
or plan. It is a bare theoretical possibility that the subconsciousness
of one of the mediums is the source, but it appears more likely that
the messages originate from some independent mind. There is,
however, nothing to indicate whether this mind is embodied or
disembodied. It may, of course, be that the matter of the message
gives a clue to the identity of the author, but this is nothing to do
with the cross-correspondence as such.
We may now turn to the other type of mental phenomena, viz.
reproduction or description of psychological characteristics. It is
here that we may hope to find the most convincing, if not the most
logically conclusive, evidence for survival.
Apart from the prima facie recognition of physical appearance,
we know our friends mainly by their psychological characteristics,
in fact, these, together with memory, may be said to constitute the
person.
Now where a medium consistently reproduces the psychological
characteristics of a deceased person this fact undoubtedly carries a
considerable weight, though, of course, the fact that these charac-
teristics are recognisable shows that a knowledge of them is
116 H. F. Saltmarsh [part
possessed by some living person. The necessity for the evidence to
be verified carries with it all the same inherent weakness for this
type of phenomenon as in other cases.
There are two sides of the matter to be considered. First, the
medium's power to reproduce. We know from normal experience
that a clever actor or mimic can give a convincing reproduction of
another person. As a rule we know very little of the medium's
powers as an actor, more particularly so when we bear in mind that
we have to take into account subconscious as well as conscious
powers. Here again we have an apparently insuperable difficulty
in estimating probabilities.
The second side of the matter is the nature of the information.
This is far more nebulous and indefinite than in the case of informa-
tion concerning past, present or future events. From this it arises
that verification is less certain, also that the conviction which is
carried is to a large extent subjective and individual.
I might feel that the reproduction was convincing, but another
person who had not known the deceased so well or had known
another side of his character, might feel very differently. My
conviction then is subjective and incommunicable ;
you can only
take my word for it.
However, were a large number of independent competent
observers of separate cases to be convinced, this objection would be
to a great extent overcome ; we could not suppose that so many
people would honestly make the same mistake, and we should be
bound to accept their testimony. This, however, affects only the
question of recognition, not that of the source of the information.
It cannot be repeated too often that our almost complete lack of
knowledge of the nature of telepathy and clairvoyance, of their
conditions and limitations, is sufficient of itself to introduce a very
great weakness, from the logical point of view, into all our arguments.
It is like trying to solve an equation which contains two independent
unknowns.
We may make the assumption that there is some analogy between
telepathy and normal communication, though there is very little
to support such an assumption.
If we assume this we can say that communication of definite
information of past or present facts would be easier than of psycho-
logical characteristics. I could in a short conversation give another
person information concerning many facts of the past history of a
deceased friend, but it would require a very much longer description
to enable even a first-class actor to give a convincing reproduction
of his psychological characteristics. It is probable that this
assumption is always tacitly made to some extent, and it thus
arises that evidence of this kind carries with it a greater feeling of
Is Proof of Survival Possible ? 117
conviction than mere information concerning facts of history, but
until the grounds of the assumption are established it remains an
open question whether the conviction is justified.
Of the two varieties of psychological characteristics mentioned,
knowledge of habitual forms of speech would be easier to convey
telepathically, hence evidence of this nature is of somewhat lower
value. Habitual forms of thought and association of ideas are one
of the most individual characteristics of any person, and it seems to
me that if a large number of instances of reproductions of this
nature by mediums under good evidential conditions could be
collected, a fairly strong presumptive case for survival might be
established, though it would fall far short of logical conclusiveness
and the conviction it carried would vary widely with each individual.
For the sake of completeness a brief mention of certain spon-
taneous phenomena must be made.
Phantasms of the living, taken by themselves, would appear to
have little or no direct bearing on the question of survival, although
as forming an important part of the evidence of communion between
mind and mind independent of the normal sensory channels, they
may help to refute the hypothesis of the physical nature of mind
and thus remove a serious a priori obstacle to acceptance of sur-
vival.
Phantasms of the dead appear at first sight to form the basis of
a fairly strong argument for survival, which might be stated some-
what as follows. It is found that phantasms of the living tend to
occur with greater frequency when the person whose phantasm
appears is in a state of crisis ; it is probable, therefore, that such a
state is an efficient factor in the production of a phantasm. If this
be so the agency lies to some extent with the person whose phantasm
appears.
When phantasms of the dead appear, if we may assume that the
conditions of production are the same, the agency of the deceased
is a requisite part of the phenomenon and such agency may be held
to imply survival.
It is obvious that a weak part of this argument is the assumption
that the conditions of production of a phantasm of the dead are the
same as those of one of the living ; our knowledge of the mechanism
is so slight that it is impossible to say if this assumption is justifiable.
Also it might be objected that the agency required for the pro-
duction of a phantasm does not necessarily involve the activity of
any factor inherent in personality. As a general rule, in cases of
phantasms of the living, the part played by the agent is a quite
unconscious one so far as we know. Moreover there is an even
greater weakness arising from the possibility of latency ; the
percipient may have received the impression while the agent was
118 H. F. Saltmarsh [part
still alive and it may have remained latent in the subconsciousness
until a favourable opportunity for emergence occurred. The fact
that the frequency of phantasms decreases rapidly from the time
of death of the agent seems to point to this explanation.
It is sometimes claimed that death-bed visions form a peculiarly
evidential type of this class of case, but it seems, a priori, that a
dying person can hardly be considered as good a witness as one in
good health. There appears some ground for thinking that the
dying are rather more than normally suggestible, and the unques-
tionable fact that there is a widespread expectation of death-bed
visions renders it probable that such will frequently occur, though
they may be entirely subjective in character.
Among certain classes of the population it is thought to be only
right and proper that the dying person should have visions of heaven
and of their departed friends and relatives. When an expectation
with so strong a sentiment attached impinges on a person in a
highly suggestible state, it is small wonder that it is fulfilled.
It is sometimes stated that these death-bed visions consist only
of persons already dead, and where there is included among those
seen someone of whose death the percipient is normally unaware,
this is held to be evidence of the agency and hence survival of that
person. But I suggest that there is no evidence that death-bed
visions consist solely of persons already dead. In fact, there are
cases of a dying mother apparently seeing her living children. That
they should mainly so consist, I consider sufficiently explained by
the strong pre-existing expectation.
Where information not normally known to the percipient is
conveyed by the phantasm then the case becomes subject to the
same criticisms and rules as where the information is communicated
through a medium and its evidential value must be assessed accord-
ingly. The value is not affected by the fact that the percipient is
dying.
Were a perfectly satisfactory poltergeist case to occur we might
argue therefrom the existence of an extraneous agency, but there
is nothing to indicate or even suggest that that agency is or ever
was human. Where a haunt exhibits human characteristics it
might be thought that the surviving mind was implicated in the
agency. Here again, however, our ignorance of the conditions is
so profound that no valid argument can be established.
There remain two further points to be considered. First, whether
any combination of the various types of phenomena would afford
more conclusive evidence than when taken separately ;
second, the
" faggot theory ".
Now I think that there is little doubt that were a medium to give
information known to have been in the possession of a deceased
122] Is Proof of Survival Possible ? 119
person and verifiable only by means of a complex series of linkages,
and at the same time to reproduce the psychological and perhaps
some of the physical characteristics of the same deceased person,
the evidence would be as strong as it is possible to get. If we accept
the survival hypothesis we have one single though possibly internally
complex explanation of all the facts ; if we reject it we have to
assume the combination of several separate explanations. Even if
we estimate the probability of survival at a lower figure than that
of any of the events involved in the alternative explanations the
combined probability of these latter may very likely be considerably
less.
In simple cases probabilities are combined by mulitplication, so
that supposing that we had on one side a single explanation with
probability 1/100, and on the other three combined events with each
a probability of 1/10, we should get a final ratio of 1/100 for the
single explanation to 1/1000 for the combined.
However, the case under discussion is not so simple as this and
the combination of probabilities would not be by plain multipli-
cation, because we do not know how far the various alternative
hypotheses are independent of each other ; for example, the
reception of a telepathic message from some living person giving
information of past events with which the ostensible communicator
was concerned may, of itself, strengthen the rapport between that
person and the medium and thus render the transmission of infor-
mation concerning the physical and psychological characteristics
easier. Thus supposing the independent probability of telepathy
from the living person concerning the past is 1/m, and concerning
psychical characteristics \ jn, after rapport has been established by
the first telepathic message the probability ljn may become Ijn-x.
We do not know that this actually is so but it is possible.
We have two separate difficulties : in the first place we cannot
form any reliable estimates of the individual probabilities, in the
second we do not know the formula for their combination. It seems
therefore that though a case such as described, if it could be found,
would give apparently strong evidence, we cannot say how strong it
would be.
The faggot theory is that while an isolated case may afford but
slender support for the survival theory, the whole bulk of cases
taken together supplies evidence of almost irresistible strength, the
analogy being, of course, with the weakness of a single stick as
compared with the strength of a faggot.
When all the cases are of a similar nature this theory is, I think,
demonstrably false. We are not dealing here with the probability
of a certain event happening or not happening ; had this been the
point at issue, multiplication of examples would have been relevant.
120 H. F. Saltmarsh [part
The accumulation of masses of evidence is desirable for the purpose
of establishing the existence of the phenomena, but it does not help
in the interpretation when it is all of the same kind.
In putting forward an hypothesis we are ascribing an event
which has actually happened to one particular cause among alter-
native possible causes. The probability of this explanation being
correct is a function of the combined probabilities of the etiological
factors which have gone to produce the event, and is the same
whether it occurs only once or a hundred times. It is on the ratio
of this probability to that of the other possible alternatives that
the plausibility of the hypothesis rests. Where the evidence is not
all of a similar nature the case is not quite so simple, but even here
the faggot theory fails to afford the increase of strength which is
claimed for it by some of its supporters.
Suppose we have four alternative possible causes for an event
and that the probability is the same for each, say 1/4, then, whatever
number of similar cases we have, any selected cause will have a
plausibility represented by the fraction 1/4. But if out of one
hundred such cases there are reasons for excluding two out of the
alternatives in 20 instances and the probability of the remaining
two remains equal, the combined probability of either of them over
the whole number of cases becomes 3/10, for in the 80 cases the
most probable number of times we should expect to find the selected
cause is 80 x 1/4 = 20, in the remaining 20 cases it is 20 x \ = 10,
thus giving in all 30 times in 100 = probability 3/10.
This is a slight accession of strength, but far short of that claimed
by the faggot theory ;
moreover, it applies equally well to the other
cause which remained in the 20 cases.
One can imagine circumstances when the multiplication of the
number of cases would increase the plausibility of the survival
hypothesis to a very great extent, but these are always instances of
competition between a single and relatively simple hypothesis
which will cover all the facts of every case without stretching and
a series of more or less complex combinations of alternative ex-
planations, combinations moreover which differ each from the
other and require a variety of chance coincidences to bring them
about.
The following is an attempt to represent the matter symbolically.
Let there be a number of alternative possible causes, A, B, C, D,
and assume that the relative probabilities of each are known.
When the case stands thus : Either A ,
B, C or D, then the
number of instances has no effect on the strength of the evidence.
Example : Suppose that^a medium gives me some information
which could not have been normally acquired and I can account for
it either by the survival hypothesis or by telepathy from the living
122] Is Proof of Survival Possible ? 121
or by clairvoyance on the part of the medium, then however many
times this happens it will not affect the strength of the evidence for
any of the alternative explanations.
When it stands :
n cases either A, B, C or D
nx ,, „ A, C or D
n2 „ „ A,BotD,
and so on, the strength of the evidence is somewhat increased in
the manner shown in the example given above.
Example : Suppose I have a number of cases of supernormal
information as above and I can account for some of them either by
survival or by telepathy or by clairvoyance, but for others telepathy
is barred out, while for the rest clairvoyance is not available as an
alternative, then the strength of the evidence for survival is slightly
increased by the increase of the number of cases.
When it stands : Either A or B and 0 and D combined in the
same way, the number of instances has no effect on the strength of
the evidence.
Example : Suppose that I have a number of cases and they can
all be explained either by survival or else by telepathy combined
with clairvoyance in a certain manner, then the number of cases
has no effect on the strength of the evidence.
But when it stands :
n cases either A or xB and yC and zD
nx ,, ,, A or xx
B and y-fi and z^D
»2 j, A or x%
B and y2C and z2
D
where x, xv y, yv etc., stand for different modes of combination,
chance coincidence, assumptions, stretchings and variations of
hypothesis in different directions, then the theory holds good and
the strength of the evidence for A is increased.
Example : Suppose that all of the cases can be explained by
survival, some of them alternatively by a combination of telepathy
and clairvoyance involving certain coincidences, others by a
different combination of telepathy and clairvoyance involving
other coincidences, and so on, then the increase of the number of
cases may, if they are all different, largely increase the strength of
the evidence for survival.
But in this, as elsewhere, until we have put definite estimates on
the various probabilities involved, we cannot say what the increase
amounts to. The conclusion, then, to which I arrive from this
analysis is that no logical proof of survival is at present possible
from the evidence studied by psychical research, though I particu-
larly do not desire to be dogmatic and say that it will never be
122 H. F. Saltmarsh [PART 122]
possible. A fairly strong presumptive case might conceivably be
made out were the evidence to be forthcoming in a sufficiently
perfect state, but owing to the difficulties in estimating the prob-
abilities of the various alternatives, no agreement as to its actual
strength is likely to be reached ; conviction will be, and seems
likely to remain, completely subjective and dependent on individual
idiosyncrasy. It is conceivable, however, that a case might occur
where the probability of the hypotheses alternative to survival was
obviously and incontestably so infinitesimally minute that the
unlikeliness of any of these hypotheses being correct could only be
overcome by absolute disproof of survival, which, as we have seen,
is not forthcoming.
I do not at present know of such a case, but if one could be found
it would be sheer prejudice and obstinacy to withhold a provisional
acceptance of some form of survival. It should be noted that such
acceptance can only be provisional and subject to withdrawal,
because it is always possible that some ingenious sceptic may
sometime discover a totally fresh alternative hypothesis which will
account for the facts in a more plausible manner.
II. ON THE DIFFICULTY OF PROVING
INDIVIDUAL SURVIVAL.
By Sir Oliver Lodge.
I was not able to be present when Mr Saltmarsh read his Paper.
He sets out clearly the many alternative hypotheses that could be
said to account for certain kinds of experience. Proof after all is a
question of probabilities. I do not suppose that a sledge-hammer
proof which knocks down all opposing theories and finally exter-
minates them is ever attainable by us, even in physics. It has
occasionally happened that a theory has been adopted and has held
the field for nearly a century, and yet has been modified at the end
and incorporated with some opposition theory which had seemed
extinct. What we need in science is a working hypothesis that we
can test, getting results from it that we can verify, until ultimately
its probability becomes so great that we may have confidence in it
as an approach to certainty.
If we grant the possession by a medium of an extensive faculty
for telepathy and clairvoyance, no record of the past is safe from
the application of those powers. Yet there is a limit to our credulity
in those directions, and, after time and much experience, one may
feel that our only escape from accepting the straightforward appear-
ance is to strain the alternative hypothesis unduly. An extensive
faculty of clairvoyance can hardly be attributed to an extension
of the normal faculty of the medium without the intervention of
some other intelligence, of whose activity many phenomena contain
more than an indication : and I think Mr Saltmarsh would agree
that the amount of evidence available for establishing the existence
and activity of some intelligence, other than that of incarnate
humanity, may be said to amount to proof. But as he points out,
this does not establish the activity of any specified individual.
What we have established, I consider, is the existence of a
spiritual world. To establish personal identity in connexion with
such a world is a more difficult problem. The faculty of reading a
closed book can hardly be attributed to the powers of a person
encased in the flesh and using his bodily sense-organs : it involves
something more. And so does the perception of a bodily apparition
or representation of some deceased person. The Ancients used to
attribute an apparition or phantasm, not to the person immediately
123
124 Sir Oliver Lodge [part
represented, but to a messenger from the gods, who could put on
the appearance of that person for the purpose of conveying a
message. Witness the legend of Ceyx and Alcyone in the Eleventh
Book of Ovid's " Metamorphoses," where Morpheus impersonates
the dead husband, and gives a message to his sorrowing wife.
It becomes therefore a question which can legitimately be asked
whether any plan can be devised whereby personal identity can be
proven, or at least rendered more probable as an explanation than
any other hypothesis that can be suggested. Anticipation of the
future has been suggested ; but that is more than we ought to
expect from any deceased relative of our own. The power may
sometimes be exhibited, but it suggests a knowledge more likely to
be attained by some intelligence who has had time and opportunity
to go beyond common experience, and to transcend any powers
possessed by ordinary humanity.
The point or crux about which Mr Saltmarsh raises the difficulty
is the establishment of the personal identity of some quite ordinary
person. Facts in his life, or documents recorded by him in the
past, would seem to be useless, since they can be arrived at or
deciphered by other means. I want to ask therefore whether there
are any steps that could be taken by, say, an individual member of
the S.P.R., interested in the subject, and anxious to do his best to
prove his own survival, that would be accepted by Mr Saltmarsh,
or any other experienced critic, as conclusive, or as raising the
probability in favour of that view to so high a degree that for all
practical purposes it amounts to certainty.
Let me therefore take an imaginary case, and see what flaws can
be found in it. The test most approved seems to be some personal
habit or idiosyncrasy, not too well known or capable of imitation,
and preferably not known at all, but recorded by the individual
before his death in such a way that the record can be deciphered
afterwards and be accepted as reasonable. Suppose for instance
that a person whom I will call A has had an obsession since childhood
of some absurd childish verse or short poem, which has frequently
recurred to him throughout life, but which, being entirely frivolous,
has never been spoken about or mentioned to a soul, the insignifi-
cance of it being such that A is rather ashamed of it than otherwise,
and sees no meaning in mentioning it. The supposed poem or
verse must be quite meaningless, not forming any part of daily
life, and not having the least interest even for himself, but yet one
which has been so frequently recalled as to be permanently ingrained
in his memory, so that he may hope to remember it sufficiently to
recall it in full detail even after he has lost his bodily organs and
passed through the transition called death ;
assuming, as we are
bound to, that such a state of things is any way feasible, for if we
122] On the Difficulty of Proving Individual Survival 125
start with, the initial impossibility, no proof can be given us.
Suppose further that A has sufficient sense to perceive that the
mere recital of the poem as recorded in his posthumous document
would not suffice ; for it would have to be assumed that a medium
could read that, even in a closed envelope. Let us suppose therefore
that he takes pains to enter into further detail, having had a lifelong
opportunity of doing so. He has noticed, let us say, that the verse
contains seventeen words of one syllable, nine words of two
syllables, four words of three syllables, and one of four ; and that as
a preliminary he gives through several mediums hereafter the
meaningless jumble of figures 17, 9, 4, 1, and then in due time
amplifies the meaning of these figures, and says what they are
intended to signify ; and that, foreseeing this attempt that he will
make hereafter, he has recorded in his deposited document the
fact that he will send these figures, and will afterwards expand
their meaning. He might take some further steps, and record why
or under what circumstances the trivial verse took such a hold on
him. It must not be a verse of any importance, or one that
could be called a quotation. It might be a portion of a Bab-
ballad, for instance ;
though even these are familiar to several
people, and are too well known to be suitable. I would rather
suppose that the thing he has thus thoroughly memorised is quite
uninteresting and meaningless, even to himself, that he cannot
explain why it has stuck in his memory and been analysed in almost
a physiological manner ; the details of which analysis could hardly
be imagined by the most expert clairvoyant, but which nevertheless,
in the case I am imagining, is to be given through several mediums
by the person who thus intends to establish his identity, and will
likewise be found recorded in the posthumous document that is to
be ultimately opened and read.
If this experiment could be carried out thoroughly, both by the
deceased person who thinks the object sufficient to justify him in
taking all that trouble, and by the survivors who have been
entrusted with the document and who must be supposed to act
wisely,—not to be in a hurry, but to wait until they get the assent
of A himself as to what they think they will find in the deposited
document, before they open it, —then to me the hypothesis that
that individual is still functioning, and that the messages really
come from him and from no one else, seems to me the only one that
meets the case. There may be loopholes for scepticism even in
such an imaginary case as that. It requires rather an exceptional
concatenation of circumstances to make the test possible. But if
that would not be a proof that would satisfy a reasonable critic,
then I don't see how anyone anxious to prove his identity hereafter
could proceed with the task.
III. REPLY TO SIR OLIVER LODGE.
By H. F. Saltmarsh.
Before making any comment on the imaginary case which Sir
Oliver Lodge suggests, may I first say that I agree that sufficient
evidence is available to establish as a sound working hypothesis the
existence of a spiritual world. Accepting telepathy as a fact and
holding, as I consider that there is reasonable empirical and theor-
etical grounds to hold, that it is a purely psychical process, it is for
me a short step from embodied minds functioning in a non-physical
environment to inhabitants, that is to say disembodied minds, in
that environment. As regards Sir Oliver's imaginary case, this
would, I admit, set up a strong presumptive case for personal
survival, the more so as it exhibits a post-mortem conative factor
as well as the persistence of memory, thus excluding the hypothesis
of persistence of mnemic fragments as suggested by Dr Walter
Leaf and Dr C. D. Broad.
Yet I think that the captious critic might pick holes even in such
a case. For example, it might be pointed out that A planned the
experiment before his death and might, therefore, have unconsci-
ously conveyed the information concerning it to someone who has
survived him, in whose subconscious memory it has lain latent until
drawn upon by the mediums. I admit that the requisite linkages
would be complex and unlikely but not, under favourable circum-
stances, wildly impossible.
Or again, in the posthumous document A has recorded his intention
to give the figures as a preliminary test, and if it were possible for a
medium clairvoyantly to read the verse contained in this document,
the record of the intention to give the preliminary test could also
be read. The verse itself would supply the figures.
The ingenious combination of a cross-correspondence~with a
sealed message case undoubtedly strengthens the evidence, and
were the figures to be given at a sitting at which no one connected
with A was present and the connection with the A case to arise
only in a subsequent comparison of records, I think that the personal
survival hypothesis would show a probability considerably higher
than that of the several alternatives.
The main point which I wished to bring out in my paper is,
126
[PART 122] Reply to Sir Oliver Lodge 127
however, that the probability set up by any of the types of psychical
evidence mentioned is only one factor in establishing the plausibility
of the survival hypothesis. It has to go into the scales together with
all sorts of preconceived ideas and prejudices, desires, hopes and
fears, also arguments and evidence, for and against, based on physical,
psychological, ethical and religious grounds. The weight of these
factors varies with each individual and is as a rule absolutely
incalculable, besides being by no means constant. It is true, as
Sir Oliver says, that even in physical science sledge-hammer proof
is unattainable, but the order of magnitude of the probabilities with
which the physicist has to deal is incomparably greater than
anything we can hope for in psychical research. Probabilities of
magnitudes such as 1 to 1040
or 1060
can force their way into the
mind with almost irresistible force, moreover there is, as a rule, an
almost complete absence of any emotional obstacle.
Thus, while whatever my mood I never doubt the Second Law
of Thermodynamics, I may to-day feel that Sir Oliver's case would
give me a substantial assurance of survival, yet to-morrow, if ill
and depressed, I might be inclined to stress the objections.
May I suggest an imaginary case ; it is one which seems to be not
beyond the possibility of realisation seeing that very similar
experiments have actually been carried out. In order to make it
clear I will take characters from Dickens.
Suppose that David Copperfield had a son, whom I will call
David Junior. After his father's death he gets into ostensible
communication with him through a medium and finds that the
contents of sealed envelopes can be read.
He proposes an experiment to his father and selects twelve
photographs of old family friends and relatives. These he hands to
a total stranger who seals them in opaque envelopes. The sealed
envelopes are then handed to a second stranger who shuffles them
and selects one at random. At the next sitting the father is asked
to give identifying details of the person whose photograph has been
selected. He says, " She would not allow donkeys on her green ".
David Junior then opens the envelope and finds the photograph of
Miss Betsy Trotwood but cannot understand the reference.
However, he inquires among surviving friends of his father and
learns from one of them about Miss Trotwood's objection to donkeys
going on the green in front of her house, a fact of which he was
himself unaware.
Now the medium, even if she could by clairvoyance see the
photograph in the sealed envelope, could not identify it as Miss
Trotwood, nor would she know about the donkeys. The only
living persons who could identify the photograph would be David
Junior or some surviving friend of his father.
128 H. F. Saltmarsh [PART 122]
While there is nothing to suggest that any of these possess
clairvoyant faculty, it is possible that they may do so. One cannot
prove a negative in such cases, although prolonged experiment
might establish a strong probability. Anyhow, David Junior did
not know about the donkeys and the friend who supplied the
information had no knowledge of the experiment. The person who
could comply with all the conditions would be David Senior.
I suggest that this would be extremely strong evidence of identity,
although I can find alternative explanations.
The message might come from Betsy Trotwood herself or some
other spiritual personality who knew the circumstances, but owing
to our almost complete ignorance of the conditions of post-mortem
existence, if such there be, we cannot say how far this is probable.
Or again, David Junior might have clairvoyantly recognised the
photograph and, knowing the conditions of the experiment, have
subconsciously tapped the mind of his father's surviving friends for
some identifying details. And finally there may exist some con-
ditions of which we are totally unaware by means of which a
knowledge of the past may be obtained by certain supernormally
endowed persons. Such, for example, as the " akashic records
"
of the Theosophists.
My first alternative, while not definitely proving the survival of
David Senior, implies most probably his survival or that of Betsy
Trotwood or some of her friends, though the communication might
have come from a non-human intelligence masquerading as David
Senior. The second would require a set of conditions and linkages
which, to my mindr are extremely improbable, while the third is
simply explanation of " ignotum per ignotius ".
Should such a case be forthcoming, particularly if arising during
the course of a long series of communications in which the ostensible
communicator gives evidence of identity of the usual kind and
behaves in a manner consistent with the personality purported, I
should, as a matter of purely personal conviction, feel myself bound
to accept the personal survival hypothesis as substantially proved,
though always subject to reconsideration in the light of fresh facts.
EVIDENTIAL EXTEACTS FROM SITTINGS WITH
MRS LEONARD.
By the Rev. W. S. Irving and Theodore Besterman.
Part I.
TESTS OF VARIOUS KINDS.
By the Rev. W. S. Irving.
In venturing to publish the following extracts, mainly taken from
my recent sittings with Mrs Leonard, I do so in the hope that they
will be of interest not only to other regular Leonard sitters, enabling
them to compare their results with mine, but also to that larger
body of our members who have no opportunity of having sittings
of their own with this medium. Except when otherwise stated, the
extracts are verbatim, save that repetitions are cut out, as also are
the continual interjections of " Wait a bit !
", " Wait a minute !
",
with which Feda's sentences are interspersed. It would seem as
though it were necessary that the flow of material should not be
interrupted by pauses, yet the speed with which the material is
given makes it, at times, almost impossible to get it down ; this
difficulty is surmounted, therefore, by the continual repetition of
sentences, which enables us to keep pace with the Communicator,
and to obtain a complete record of the sitting. To give all these
repetitions in a report would be to spoil the even flow of the script
and to cause confusion.
1. Booktests and Impressions.
My Communicator, Dora, who purports to be my wife and has at
various times given evidence of her identity, claims to be able to go
to houses with which I am unacquainted, and to get booktests and
impressions from those houses. In the first of these extracts, she
has gone to the house of Mrs Kingsley Tarpey, where she would
seem to have been on several occasions before. It is, I think,
several years since I have met Mrs Tarpey, and then I knew nothing
whatever about her. She was so kind as to take notes for me once
at a sitting with Miss McCreadie, though I did not know her name
at the time, and I have several times seen Mrs Tarpey at the S.P.R.
129
130 Rev. W. 8. Irving and Theodore Besterman [part
Rooms. That is as far as my acquaintance with her goes. I have
never been to her flat. Mrs Tarpey has, however, I understand,
had some Leonard sittings herself.
Note by Mrs Kingsley Tarpey, 22 August 1931. " Neither Mrs
Leonard nor Mr Irving have ever been to my flat. Mr Irving was
not personally known to me, for though I had taken notes for him
at a sitting with Miss McCreadie, he was anonymous on that
occasion, and I only heard his name accidentally some months later.
About six years ago Feda said, referring to my Communicator,
'
He's been helping Dora and Dora has been to your flat '. As I
have a sister Dora I thought it referred to her. At a later sitting
there was another reference and I showed some surprise. Feda then
said :
'
It's not the Dora you are thinking of, it's Mr Bill's Dora '.
I asked Miss Newton if she could tell me anything of Mr Bill and
Dora, and, on explaining why, she said she thought it would be
better to tell me nothing for fear of spoiling evidence. Several
booktests at my flat followed. The next year I was away some
months and lent my flat to a friend. Feda mentioned at my next
sitting that Dora had been, but could get nothing. '
It was like a
feather bed '."
Extract from a Sitting with Mrs Leonard, 28 April 1931. Sitter :
Rev. W. S. Irving. Recorder : Mr Theodore Besterman.
. . . Now, Mr Bill, are you ready, 'cos she going to Mrs William's
—what she call " The Tarpauline One ". Mr Bill ! Same room as
before. What she call there " the nice light room ". [Note 1.]
Mr Bill ! Books again walking round to the left. She's taken the
third shelf, and the second book from the left. [Note 2.]
This book felt to her to be a book of the imagination. A book of
the what ? Of the imagination, she says. By that I mean, not a
historical work, or collection of facts, but a book of the imagination.
I felt, you know, strange thoughts in it—strange thoughts—mental
wanderings of an interesting and happy kind, but, I should say, all
on the plane of imagination. [Notes 3, 4, 13.]
I want page seven, she says, thejproper page seven that you
asked her for [at the sitting not long before this test was given, we
had managed to persuade the Communicator, at last, to go by the
actual numbers on the page], 'cos on page seven, there's a reference
to a happy land, a happy state, which I think is meant for our
world. It certainly fits it, describes it. I want you to think of this
in that way. There's rather an unusually large margin at the sides
of the printing. I wonder if it is poetry, or blank verse. It may
not be, but its spaced and arranged on the page rather in that way.
Oh ! Such a funny word beginning with an 0. Like a foreign word.
She's trying to write it up for me. Seems to be connected with
122] Evidential Extracts from Sittings with Mrs Leonard 131
this same page—like a foreign word. One Feda knows ? Are you
sure it isn't Osteopath ? No, it isn't. Only, I know what an Osteo-
path is ! . . . Dora says " It's nothing to do with that at all, quite
different, but it is a peculiar word, an uncommon word, beginning
with 0, and the interpretation of it, you see, means "
—oh Dora—
" interpretation of it means a soldier ", [I put down " soldier " at
the time as being the nearest word I could think of to the sound
made by Feda, and so have, of course, left it in the script, but the
word should obviously be " sojourn ", as I recognised immediately
after at the sitting], "place, condition where one can stay. It fits
in—works in—with the rest of the thing—a happy place ". It's
no good saying it to him—" a happy place that I told you of ".
[Note 14.] It's not the facing page—the page through. Do you
know what I mean ? Holding this page in your hand, [Feda
illustrates] the other side of it—sunsets, describing sunsets. [Note
15.] Beginning of the book, at the beginning of the book, there's
a mention of, what she would call, something reminded her, made
her think, of Roman Solecism—Catholicism. That's right. [Note
16.] . . . It's only a reference to it. Something that made her
immediately feel the condition. She felt it so strongly. She knows
you'll recognise it when you see it too.
Oh ! Ask if a book has been lately placed in there—near there
where she's taken the book from ? She felt it had. [Note 5.] " The
lady has been "
—been what ? Rubbing something very hard-
rubbing something with her hand, so hard, just by these books.
Put good deal of vigour into it. [Note 6.] There's something very
pretty, sort of blue colour, near the books, too. Not the wall. Not
all blue—fleckings—touches of clear, lightest, blue—fleckings—on
or against the wall near the books. [Note 7.]
And she does like, will you tell her, the picture of the little
bridge with the broken handrail. Will you say that ? (Yes.) She
likes that. [Note 8.]
And the yellow flowers, the small yellow flowers, that has been
in the room recently. Were they out of season, out of their time,
very much ? Something said about their being a little before, or
after, their time. [Note 9.]
Oh ! Is there a ledge outside this room, a ledge ? It seemed to
me I could step out, you know, she says. Not usual is it, in London,
or near London, but felt I could step out, and I felt as if someone
had been stepping out—reaching out—and saying :
" It's growing
—it's growing." Have you got that, Mr Bill ? (No.) No, he says,
he hasn't got it ! That's right, Mr Bill, you say so ! (All right now.)
Did you get : Someone had been stepping out, reaching out, and
saying " It's growing ?
" (Yes.) Dora think something near the
window, and yet outside. [Note 10.]
132 Rev. W. S. Irving and Theodore Besterman [part
And ask her please if she has hurt her hand by or with this
window, recently, will you ? (Yes.) By or with this window.
Standing, you see, close to it, and saying " Oh ! Oh ! I've hurt
myself. How awkward ! How very awkward !
" That was, I
think, the word used. What, Dora, I don't understand !
" But
awkward." [Note 11.] A prayer has been offered in this room
recently—a prayer offered—for someone who is ill, very ill—
woman. Definite prayer has been given in this room, lately, asking
that this person should be relieved of pain. Evidently the person
was not only ill, but in pain. Tell her I got a feeling of some kind
of inflammation, I think of nerves—an inflammation of the nerves.
Tell her I took up the prayer, doubled it, strengthened it. Hope it
may do good. Our thoughts do help definitely. Tell her I took it
up. I think she'll understand, she says, she'll understand. That's
right, Mr Bill. . . . [Note 12.]
Mrs Tarpey's notes.
[Note 1.] On Tuesday, April 28th, I received a telegram from
Mr Irving saying that a booktest had been given ;
by the last
post I had the first notes of the " impressions ". The books in the
bookcases were not disturbed before the examination of them by
the official of the S.P.R.
[Note 2.] A small bookcase has been put on the left, between
writing-table and bureau, since Dora's last visit to this fiat to get
tests. ... Mr Bill's first note said third shelf up.
[Note 3.] The book referred to, Laughing Boy, was bought in
January 1931. It has only been in this bookcase five or six weeks.
[Note 4.] It is a book full of imagination, and the theme is
unusual, an attempt to get at the psychology of an American
Indian, retaining his racial traditions, and yet in touch with modern
ideas.
[Note 5.] The books in this case were rearranged about three
or four weeks ago to make room for a book of reference received as
a present.
[Note 6.] On Thursday, April 23rd, a very vigorous rubbing and
brushing of a garment took place on the table close to this bookcase ;
the previous week the room was spring-cleaned, but not by myself.
[Note. When Mrs Tarpey told me of the incident of rubbing she
said she herself had cleaned and rubbed a velvet coat, which she
showed me. I. Newton.]
[Note 7.] Covering an ottoman near the bookcase is an Indian
embroidery with talc discs. Sitting where I am writing the talc
looks blue and the pattern is " flecked ". There is also blue in the
carpet, but flecking does accurately describe the drapery. The
ottoman is against the wall. [Confirmed, I. Newton.]
122] Evidential Extracts from Sittings with Mrs Leonard 133
[Note 8.] No picture of bridge in this room, except one giving
the Arno and the extreme end of the Ponte Vecchio. No handrail.
[Note 9.] Close to the window, outside, a Forsythia flowered
fully six weeks before the usual time.
[Note 10.] There is a wide stone parapet or ledge outside the
window, with a space on a lower level where one can step out.
Plants in pots and boxes which have survived the winter. I have
frequently both stepped out and leant out during the past two or
three months, and have been surprised and pleased to find appar-
ently dead wood showing buds. I must have said " It's growing
"
more than once to my maid, who corroborates this.
[Note 11.] My maid hurt her hand (scraped two fingers) and had
them bandaged, on Tuesday, the 28th, not in this room, but was in
the room later. She did show me her hand and say, " I've hurt
myself ". I did say about the bandage and her work, " How very
awkward, be sure you keep it well covered."
[Note 12.] On April 14th I had a sitting in this room with a
medium, Miss Anne Geddes. When it was over I told her of the
serious illness of my niece, whom she knew and liked very much.
She was deeply affected, and offered a silent prayer for her recovery.
She saw her, clairvoyantly, surrounded by light and free from all
pain, and, very naturally, interpreted this as meaning she would
survive, but I knew that my niece's illness was of so grave a nature
that there was no hope, and I thought the vision meant release. I
did not say so to Miss Geddes. Next morning my niece died. The
illness was scarlet fever, and the lungs became septic. There had
also been much pain from the heart.

Miss Newton's Notes.
The test was verified by the Secretary, who went to Mrs Tarpey's
on Thursday, April 30th, 1931, and later made the following notes :
[Note 13.] The second book from the left on the third shelf up,
in the bookcase on the left, was Laughing Boy, by Oliver La Farge.
Extracts from Introductory Note, pp. vii-viii
" This book is a work of fiction. I have tried to be as true as I
knew how to the general spirit of Navajo things, to customs and
character, but all personages and incidents in the story are fictitious,
as well as places. I have used some real place-names applied to
imaginary places. . . . This story is meant neither to instruct nor
to prove a point, but to amuse. . .
."
[Note 14.] On page 7, there are nine lines completing Chapter
1. Towards the middle of the page Chapter 2 begins :
134 Rev. W. S. Irving and Theodore Besterman [part
" A small drum beating rapidly concentrated the mixed noises
with a staccato unison. Young men gathered about the drummer.
Laughing Boy might have eaten more, but he left the fire immediately
with Jesting Squaw's son. Someone led off high-pitched at full
voice, '
Yo-o galeana, yo-o galeana '. By the end of the second word
the crowd was with him ; more young men hurried up to join the
diapason, '
Galeana ena, galeana eno, yo-o ay-e hena ena '. They put
their arms over each other's shoulders, swaying in time to the one
drum that ran like a dull, glowing thread through the singing, four
hundred young men turning loose everything they had ".
On page 6, facing page 7, there are the following words :
" Hozho hogahn ladin nasha woyen. . . .
In the house of Happiness there I wander . .
.".
[Note 15.] On the back of this page (p. 8) there is a description
of a bonfire, 20 feet long, and of the figures of the Indians showing
up against the night sky with here and there a reflection of firelight
on their dark faces or horses' eyes. There is no mention of a sunset.
(Compare with this the following on page 4 : ..." showed a distant
bonfire in the dusk with mounted Indians moving in on it like
spokes of a wheel .... Now they all lined up, with the dull, red
sunset behind their black figures. . . . Over by the fire was shouting,
and another line tearing towards them.) ..."
[Note 16.] There is nothing at the beginning of the book that
suggests Roman Catholicism, or the Pope. . . .
[Signed] I. Newton.
To me, however, the word " bonfire " which occurs on both page
4 and page 8 is reminiscent of " gunpowder, treason and plot "
and anti-popery celebrations on the fifth of November.
While on the subject of tests from Mrs Tarpey's, I will include
two little " impressions " taken from her house on an earlier
occasion :
Extract from a Sitting with Mrs Leonard, 3 May 1927. Sitter :
Rev. W. S. Irving. Recorder : Mrs Brackenbury.
[Feda]. ... Is there fish in this room—fish, fish, fish ? Mr Bill
I don't think there could possibly be fish in a room—not a respect-
able room ! Dora says " There's been something done with special
reference to fish lately, fish. The atmosphere seemed full of fish ".
She says " Mentally, I mean ". What ? I don't think that's a nice
test !
" Well," Dora says, " I always like to notice the unusual ". . . .
[Note 1.]
Mr Bill ! Will you see if there's a picture with trees very pro-
nounced—especially trees, so that you'd have to say " It's a picture
of trees, not country, but trees " in this room ? Dora says " 'course
122] Evidential Extracts from Sittings with Mrs Leonard 135
many pictures have got trees in them but you would look at them
and say '
It's a picture of a garden/ or '
of the country '
—but
this you would have to call '
a picture of trees '. They're in the
foreground. They're very pronounced—very pronounced ". . .
[Note 2.]
[Note 1.] These tests were verified for me by Miss M. Wallace,
who was at this time working at the Rooms, and who kindly went
to Mrs Tarpey's on the following evening, 4 May 1927. The following
is from Miss Wallace's notes on the tests :
" This [fish test] Mrs Tarpey considered quite extraordinary.
She has a favourite Persian cat who is a fastidious feeder, and great
pains are taken to give him fish meals. Special fish is bought for
him, and this fish he always eats in this sitting-room on a plate
under a small table that stands almost next to the bookshelves
referred to. . . .
[Note 2.] " There are altogether five of Mrs Tarpey's paintings
in the room containing trees. Among these there is one that could
be said to be '
a picture of a garden,' another '
of the country,' but
one is of trees only, and could only possibly be called '
a picture of
trees '.
There are two large firs, or pines, right in the foreground,
and the only background is a rather golden sky effect—nothing else
in the picture. This picture caught my eye on entering the room,
and I could see at once it was the one referred to."
My next extract is from a series of tests taken from The Crown
House, Newport. It is a booktest

[Feda]. . . . This is at Mrs Nelly's [Feda's name for Mrs Salter]
and it's a room on the ground floor, one to which she has been
several times before, Mr Bill. She usually goes to the same room
in Mrs Nelly's . . . You remember she told you there are more than
one lot of books in this room, so she has to do the going round to
the left thing, and she wants to take the very first section of books
on the left, walking round the room on the left. Now she counted
the shelves very carefully, and she counted the third shelf from the
bottom. . . . She went on to the fifth book—fifth—on this same
shelf. . . . This fifth book, on page thirty-one, see if there's anything
about sweet smells, Mr Bill, sweet smells. Page thirty-one. Feel
like sweet smells. . . . And what did you say, Dora ? Dora says
"Do you remember her noticing, when she was here on the earth,
Rosemary,—Rosemary," she says, Mr Bill ? I think roses is nicer,
but she says, Mr Bill, that she was fond of rosemary when she was
here. She wondered if you remembered her speaking of it, and
136 Rev. W. S. Irving and Theodore Besterman [part
thinking of it ? Now, she's not sure that rosemary is mentioned on
the page. . . . Mr Bill ! It certainly does speak of sweet scents on
this page, and it reminded her of one or two things she liked when
she was here herself, and the rosemary was one of them. And
lavender, Mr Bill, and lavender. She used to be very fond of these
two things when she was here. And do you remember the sweet—
sweet briar ? (Yes.) Oh, Mr Bill ! Did she have a bush of it ? She
showing me a bush like a branch.
W. S. I. I don't remember the sweet briar.
Feda. She's holding up a branch. Oh, Mr Bill ! I'm not sure
whether she means when she was with you. You may have had to
ask someone else about this. She must have had a bush or tree of
it which she was fond of. It isn't in a bottle. It's growing what
she's showing me—so you may have to ask about that, Mr Bill.
You got something in your garden that smell, Mr Bill, that Dora
used to like. Something with a sweet scent, not roses or anything,
but more like a bush, but it's [Here a voice said " untidy "] become
rather untidy. She says " untidy ", Mr Bill, as if you've neglected
it a bit. Isn't it naughty ! But it's got the smell all the same, Mr
Bill
Mrs. Salter wrote to me concerning these tests :
" The bookcase
in question from which tests have been taken at several of Mr
Irving's earlier sittings is in the drawing-room at The Crown
House. It should be noted that the room was spring-cleaned about
a fortnight ago and the books have been replaced in the shelves
by the servants in quite a different order from the order in which
they were at the time of the last test. . . . The fifth book from the
left in the third shelf up was Ballads & Sonnets by D. G. Rossetti.
The words '
Rose Mary ', the title of the poem, occurs at the top of
p. 31. . . . [Signed] H. de G. S. May 7, 1930."
Ballads and Sonnets is published by Ellis and White, 1881. It
should be noted that the words " Rose Mary " form the heading of
a large number of other pages in this book also. It is correct that
my wife was very fond of rosemary and lavender when she was
here. I still have old bushes of both these plants in my Vicarage
garden here, which were there, I think, in my wife's time, and may
have been when we first came to this Parish in 1913. The latter
point is uncertain though, as my wife used to take cuttings, and
plant them out, so that the present bushes may be from her cuttings.
She used also to dry the lavender and use it for scent. In view of
the importance of this test, I got my neighbour, Mr Frank Summers,
to come over and inspect the bushes, and witness to their age and
condition. Both the rosemary and the lavender are now very
untidy and straggling. The former has a gooseberry bush growing
122] Evidential Extracts from Sittings with Mrs Leonard 137
up with it. " Sweetbriar " I cannot place, though I think I have
heard my wife speak of it. I don't think there is any in the garden
here.
The following impressions are also from The Crown House, but
not given at the above sitting. They are selected as interesting
types :
Extract from a Sitting ivith Mrs Leonard, 29 July 1930. Sitter :
Rev. W. S. Irving. Recorder : Mr N. C. Fonnereau.
[Feda]. . . . Oh, Oh ! She just forgotten something she ought
to have said. Not in connection with books, but it is with Mrs
Nelly. Please ask her, Has she been discussing her father's hats
lately, 'cos she said she'd been both thinking of them, and noticing
them in rather a special way. Dora says " I expect she'll laugh
when she remembers. .
."
Note by Mrs Salter : "I myself have not discussed or mentioned
my father's hats lately, but the following incident seems relevant :
Friday, 25 July 1930, was Prize Day at our local grammar school,
of which my husband is a Governor. There was a special service in
the morning to which all the boys walked in procession, followed by
the Headmaster (a D.Sc. of Cambridge University) in his scarlet
gown and black velvet doctor's hat. A neighbour, walking with
my husband to the service, remarked that she always thought the
hat rather a funny one, to which my husband replied (in effect) :
'
It's a hat with which I'm very familiar. Amongst other people
my father-in-law wore one.' My father was a Litt.D. of Cambridge.
I did not attend the service myself and knew nothing of this incident,
until my husband related it to me on 31 July. It was at once
called to his mind when I asked him if he had talked or thought
lately of my father's hats." [To the above Mr Salter adds :
" I
confirm this. W.H.Salter. 31/7/30."]
Extract from a Sitting with Mrs Leonard, 28 April 1931. Sitter :
Rev. W. S. Irving. Recorder : Mr Theodore Besterman.
[Feda]. . . . She's asking me " Has Mrs Nelly had a sitting for a
long time ?
" I told her no, Mr Bill, I haven't seen Mrs Nelly for
a long time—long, long, long time—only she wanted to be careful
about something she said. She says, " It's this : When I went
into the usual room, on the ground floor, that I, and Mr Arthur
that's Mrs Nelly's father—have used before, I felt as if she had
been talking about going away—not a short journey, a few miles,
but the possibility of a fairly long journey, for which she'd been
consulting a map. It seemed as if she was rather uncertain of the
position of some place to where she thought she might go ; and she
must have been thinking of the map, and the place, in this room."

" Tell her, also, the house isn't falling down. It's only
the hinges of the door. It isn't the sinking of the house at all—it
isn't sinking. It's only hinges. I felt the thought, and you know
we have a peculiar faculty which we can't always use on your plane
—only occasionally. We can only occasionally use it on the earth
'cos of the baffling, complicated thought-currents that interfere
with us, but it's this : it's the ability to know whether a thing is
right or wrong apart from your thoughts about it. Mrs Nelly, as I
call her, evidently had the suggestion something was sinking
dropping—out of place. Apart from her mind altogether, I sensed
she was wrong in her thought. It's simply what I have said, '
the
hinges '." That what she says, Mr Bill. [Note 2.]
. . . There's another thing she doesn't think she's ever remarked
on before : the inside of this door is different to outside. Doors is
generally cut and panelled, they matches inside and out. She feels
a difference with this one—not quite matches. And, at the top, or
perhaps I ought to say " over the top ", there's something that
juts, sticks out, juts out. Here—you look ! [Feda illustrates by
drawing in the air high above her head]. " As she's putting her
hand something sticks out, like that, from top of door, peculiar
rather, and would be, she thinks, peculiar to the house. Not a
curtain-rod, or hanger, or something ordinary, that you'd find on
any door—it's more." I'll bust in a minute !
" It's peculiar to the
house, or the room, to the formation of it," she says. [Note 3.]
" Yes. And new birds too, new birds, they haven't seen before
there they've been remarking on." They are new birds, Mr Bill,
new birds . . . New species or breed of birds " '
breed '
is perhaps
best ", she says, " breed ". That right, Mr Bill. [Note 4.]
Mrs Nelly was what ? Worried about the children, one of the
children ? Will you ask Mrs Nelly if she was thinking about one of
the children, about its ear, Mr Bill, ear—ear ? That's right, Mr
Bill, she got something so distinctly :
" child's ear ". . . . [Note 5.]
Notes by Mrs Salter.
[Note 1.] My husband and I have once or twice lately discussed
in the drawing-room (from which the booktests are taken) plans for
a Swiss holiday we think of taking this summer. On at least one
occasion we looked at maps of Switzerland. We had not been
abroad together since the summer of 1928.
[Note 2.] Our house, which is old, has a distinct tilt forwards to
the road, as a result of which most of the doors do not hang level
on their hinges and have a marked tendency to swing open or shut,
as the case may be. This peculiarity has been familiar to us ever
since we lived in the house. We did at one time (some years ago)
consider whether there was any danger of further subsidence
122] Evidential Extracts from Sittings with Mrs Leonard 139
(especially in connection with the porch which is a distinctive
feature of the house), but came to the conclusion there was no
danger. I cannot remember thinking of this matter lately. [21.xii.
31. When reading this paper in typescript I was reminded that
the door in question had sunk noticeably on its hinges a few months
after the sitting, so that it had to be pared at the bottom to prevent
rubbing on the carpet. It is impossible to say just when this
sinking began. H. de G. S.].
[Note 3.] It is true that the drawing-room door is different
inside and out. Inside it is white to match the rest of the drawing-
room panelling. Outside it is dark to match the oak panelling of
the hall. There is also a difference in the way the panels are cut
inside and out. The only suggestion I can make as to something
jutting out is that just over the door on the inside there runs a
heavy oak beam supporting the ceiling. The beam being dark is
in strong contrast to the white door.
[Note 4.] It is true that we have been talking about a new
breed of birds lately. We have been hatching some Leghorns—for
the first time for some years—and as they have not been very
satisfactory, there has been a good deal of talk about them.
[Note 5.] I cannot remember noticing anything about the
children's ears lately. More than a year ago, Martin's ears showed
a tendency to stick out and for a time he wore a night-cap to prevent
this. But the tendency is cured now. There was an appropriate
reference to the matter some time ago in one of my own sittings.
Perhaps the present remark is a reminiscence. [Signed] H. de G. S.
Mrs Salter tells me that her last sitting with Mrs Leonard was on
13 May 1930.

[Feda]. ..." There's something unequal running all round this
room." Perhaps mouses !
" No, no ! On the wall—something
unequal. Something traced on the wall, and it wasn't put on
equally. Gives one the feeling one side's lower than the other, a
queer feeling—funny ! You might think the whole thing had been
dropped a little on one side." Dora didn't like things not equal on
the earth. She'd notice them and think, Why wasn't that like that ?
She was, what you would call, observuant [sic] of things like that.
[Correct] Mr Bill ! I think Dora would have had, what you call
good eye for funny things, like lines being straight and what you
call regularity. . . . [Note 1.] [Here followed booktests from the
first and fifth books on the lowest shelf in the drawing-room. I am
not including them in this paper as they are not of special interest.]
" Wonder why as I stood facing the fifth book got a curious feeling
140 Rev. W. S. Irving and Theodore Besterman [part
as of most wonderful sun, a sunny sky, a burst of sun. I think
there must be a book with title meaning sunburst, or the full sun.
A curious feeling as if I was looking at a golden glow—sunny
golden. I shall be so interested if you will find this out for me?"
(Yes) " And when you do . . . speak to me and tell me what it is,
will you ? I don't quite know myself, but it's something there . . .
It helps me when I understand after what it was." [Note 2.]
Extracts from Mrs Salter's notes.
[Note 1.] As to "something unequal"—between the white
panelled walls of the drawing-room and the ceiling there are oak
beams. The line of these is irregular and dips noticeably at several
points, especially at the front of the room near the window. . . .
[Note 2.] In the third shelf from the bottom a little to the right
of the second testbook there is a volume of poems by Swinburne,
Songs before Sunrise. The volume has a representation of the rising
sun stamped in gold on the back of the book.
Another place from which my Communicator claims that she
finds it easy to get tests is Miss Newton's flat. Here are some recent
impressions :
Extract from a Sitting with Mrs Leonard, 30 April 1931. Sitter :
Rev. W. S. Irving. Recorder : Mr Theodore Besterman.
[Feda.] . . . Will you tell Mrs Isabel [Feda's name for Miss
Newton]—she laugh—but tell her that Dora thinks the front of her
coat does hang right. Is it a joke, Dora ? Yes, it is, in a way, but
Mrs Isabel was thinking so much about the front of a coat. Thought
it wasn't right in line—wasn't in line. Dora thinks it's all right,
but you'd better not say that, for if Mrs Isabel thinks it isn't—it
isn't. Mrs Isabel rather positive. If she thinks a thing is so, it is
so. If you argue with Mrs Isabel, and make her admit she's wrong,
she doesn't really think she's wrong inside her, she says. . . .
Note by Miss Newton.
" This is rather a joke. I went with a friend to a Polytechnic
dressmaking class on April 23rd and drafted by instructions as to
lines and measurements which I did not understand at all, a pattern
for a bridge coat. In the Vogue Illustration, which I was supposed
to be copying, the fronts of the coat were narrow, and the fronts in
my '
block pattern '
were wide, and the instructress insisted on
them being so. I felt very rebellious, disapproved to my friend of
Polytechnic patterns, preferred Vogue, but decided I must go through
with the '
block '
pattern, and so cut it out, and proceeded to make
it. I still prefer Vogue patterns."

[Feda.] . . . She wants you to ask Mrs Isabel something : Does
Mrs'Isabel want to change her beds round ? Dora tried to get in
touch with her, and the moment she did she got bed, beds, beds,
turning them round, changing them about. . . .
[Note.] I understand from Miss Newton that at Whitsuntide
she went to stay with her sister at Stow-on-the-Wold. Miss Newton
did not like the way the beds were arranged in one room, and said
it was like a hospital ward. There was in consequence a changing
round of beds.

[Feda.] . . . Dora says :
" It's rather early days to plan holidays,
but that's what she was thinking of when she was writing a letter
just a very little while ago." She says, " Not a plan for an immediate
holiday, but later on in the Summer. In this holiday she will be

—Dora says :
" I don't know how to put this ! Linking up with an
old condition on new lines." Rather 'portant, Mr Bill, to get it just
as she says it. . . .
Note by Miss Newton. " In the early afternoon of 19 April
1926, a friend and I booked berths for a cruise leaving on 7 August.
The only other cruise I have been was in 1912. When discussing
with my friend the coming cruise, I had the other in mind, and
referred to it several times. This friend does not live in London . . .
nor does she know anyone who has ever had a sitting with Mrs
Leonard, or other mediums."
2. An Experiment ivith books in a box.
The following experiment was suggested by my Communicator,
through Feda, as follows :
Extract from a Sitting with Mrs Leonard, 21 November 1929.
Sitter : Rev. W. S. Irving. Recorder : Mr N. C. Eonnereau.
[Feda.] . . . Hasn't the scribe got any books ? I think she had
her eye on the scribe's books 'cos she was looking at him in a very
sort of longing way. 'Cos, you see, Dora's dreadful interested in
'em, and I think she's got the idea of trying him. . . . Has he got
any locked up ? Oh ! What do you mean, Dora, did you want him
to lock some up ? Mr Bill ! She wondered if he could get somebody
—not himself 'cos he comes to the sittings—but get somebody, who
hasn't been here at all, to put some books in a box.
[W. S. I.] Could you ? [to notetaker.]
[N. C. F.] Yes—certainly.
142 Rev. W. S. Irving and Theodore Besterman [part
[Feda.] She wondered if lie could put some in a box, and lock
them up, and him not to have the key, but the person who put
them in to have the key. She would think that if he had three
Mr Bill, look ! I'll have to be a bit careful ! If he lay them like
[Feda illustrates horizontally] on top of each other. She doesn't
mind what kind of books, but she doesn't think timetables would
be good. She says " Not any variety of subject ". . . . She think
she would like a wooden box best, or a leather one would do. She's
not sure about metal. It might be all right, she's not quite sure,
but she would like to do that in time for your next sitting, Mr Bill.
Following out the above suggestion, I placed the matter in Miss
Newton's hands saying that if, in addition, she could manage to
have books placed in the box of which nobody knew the titles it
might be an improvement on the original plan. The following shows
what was done :
" The books were contributed by Miss Horsell, Miss Newton and
Mr Besterman, none of whom knew what the other two had con-
tributed. The housekeeper, Mrs Tolhurst, was instructed on the
afternoon of 14 January to take the collection of books into the
seance-ioom, and without looking at the titles of any, to place three
horizontally in a wooden box which was then given her for the
purpose, to lock the box, and give the key at once to the Secretary,
and the box to Tolhurst, who took it at once to Mr Fonnereau's
house, and to take the rest of the books and keep them until after
28 January. [Signed] Th. B., I. Newton, E. M. Horsell."
Attempts to give tests from this box were made on 30 January
1930, 8 May 1930, and 25 September 1930, the box being taken
back to the Rooms on each occasion on the day after the sitting, and
opened in the presence of one or more of the S.P.B,. officials. On
each occasion a certain measure of correspondence may be said to
have been found, I think, with what was stated through Feda, but
whether beyond what chance-coincidence might give is a matter
for criticism. I mention this because I am only describing one of
the above results—the third. In this case, I understand that the
test was again prepared for in the manner described above, three
fresh books being placed in the box by Mrs Tolhurst from the store,
and the box was sent to Mr Fonnereau's house in July as it was
hoped that tests might be given at a sitting on 29 July 1930. No
tests were given from the box however on that date, nor was any
attempt made to do so. In answer to my question to the Personal
Control as to whether we should " do the box " next time, D. G. I.
replied :
" He'd better keep the box in the same place. Sometimes
if a thing is altered I don't know what it is—it confuses me." The
box therefore remained at Mr Fonnereau's house until 26 September
122] Evidential Extracts from Sittings with Mrs Leonard 143
1930, and during that time it was not opened by anyone. It was
eventually opened, as described below, by Miss Newton, and at the
time of the sitting the box had not been seen by me since it was
opened at the S.P.R. rooms on 9 May 1930. So far as we know,
Mrs Leonard is ignorant of Mr Fonnereau's identity.
Extract from a Sitting with Mrs Leonard, 25 September 1930.
Sitter : Rev. W. S. Irving. Recorder : Mr N. C. Fonnereau.
[Feda.] .... She wants to say something about the box first.
[W. S. I.] Yes.
[Feda.] It's awful difficult, Mr Bill, describing to you what she
feels, and what she giving me about the box. Look !
[W. S. I.] Yes.
[Feda.] It doesn't feel as if the box is full, Mr Bill. She got, like,
what you call, vacancies in it—vacancies. Puzzled her very much,
Mr Bill. Like blank places. Think the books must have been put
such a way that they didn't like, fill the box, properly. [Note 1.]
Why does she get a feeling of pictures in connection with the box,
pictures ? She didn't see this, Mr Bill, but she got the feeling of
pictures, illustrations, very much, while she was feeling what one
can only call the top layer—the top layer—of the box. [Note 2.]
Isn't it funny, Mr Bill ! She can't get a booktest the ordinary way
from it. She gets more like impressions about it than an ordinary
booktest. Is there anything in this box, near the top of the box,
make you think of very old people—very old people ? She got such a
strong feeling of elderly people, especially a very old man. [Note 3.]
And the initial T comes with it, T, T. Mr Bill ! It's so funny the
way she has to get that : she got it from the top of the box. She
says " If it's from books it must be the top book inside." It's
something like that 'cos she says " the top ". She's moving her
hand a bit towards the left too. [Note 4.]
What creaks so about the box ? She finds it's a noisy box. Some-
thing makes a sort of creaking, rather unusually noisy sound—this
box. Something to do with the opening, she thinks. It couldn't
make a noise by itself, Dora. " You wouldn't expect it to be," she
says, " you would expect it to be a quite well-behaved box, it isn't.
There's something makes an unusual sound about it." She's sure
she's right. Is it the same box as before ? Got a different condition
feels different to her. Perhaps someone has used it, or some different
magnetism put in it, something different about it. [Note 5.]
Hayward or Hereward. As you open this box can you see the
name Hayward, or Hereward ? A name sounding very much like
that. Is it on something inside the box—name in the box ? Name
came to her so strongly sounding like Hereward—Hereward
Hereward—Hereward. [Note 6.]
144 Rev. W. S. Irving and Theodore Besterman [paet
Have you got that, Mr Bill ? She says " It's awfully funny doing
this box, it's like sensing an area more than doing an ordinary
booktest." Sensing an area, what you mean, Dora, sensing an
area ? She didn't know how else to describe it : tapping, sensing,
a small area, and seeing what you can get from it. What you call
it ? Barrel—barrel ? All right. Well, it sounds as if it must be
wrong ! Is anything shaped like a barrel in this room ? She seemed
so sure about it. Anything shaped like barrel in this room ? Either
a barrel, or something connected with, or shaped like a barrel in
the room. Dora says " I expected you to say '
no, no ', but I
should like you to look and see before you say no." " I feel I'm
right about it," she says, " Yes, I feel I'm right." [Note 7.]
Is there something white, rather large and white, near the box ?
Seemed to get a lot of white—rather large expanse of white. Not a
white curtain, or white cloth—felt like white wood, might be metal
painted white. It felt like white, hard wood. [Note 8.] Oh ! And
there's something close to it with a round knob on. [Note 9.]
Something has been falling down here—slipping down. Someone's
been talking about it, and saying "That slips down, falls down."
By where the box is, something's been slipping down. Yes ! That's
all she could get about it.
[W. S. I.] Sorry.
[Feda.] She couldn't get any more. Wasn't it a noosance !
" Most peculiar," she says. [Note 10.]
On the day after this sitting the box was taken as usual by the
notetaker to the S.P.R. Rooms, and it was opened by Miss Newton
in the presence of Mr Fonnereau and myself.
Note by Miss Newton on the contents of the box :
" Tales of Old
Japan was on the top, underneath was The Return, and at the side,
almost horizontal, was The Burden of the Balkans."
The following notes are mine :
[Note 1.] Two of the above-named books are small books, Tales
of Old Japan being 6| inches by 4§ inches, and The Burden of the
Balkans, 6| inches by 4| inches, so that the box was not nearly
full. The former of these, which was the top book, " the top layer
"
is by Lord Redesdale, Macmillan, 1910.
[Note 2.] Tales of Old Japan is distinguished by its thirty-eight
pictures by Japanese artists. They are not commonplace. On the
first page of Preface, numbered vii, attention is drawn to them as
being of an exceptional nature :
" For the illustrations, at least, I
feel that I need make no apology. Drawn, in the first instance, by
one Odake, an artist in my employ, they were cut on wood by a
famous wood engraver at Yedo, and are therefore genuine specimens
of Japanese art. Messrs Dalziel, on examining the woodblocks,
122] Evidential Extracts from Sittings ivith Mrs Leonard 145
pointed out to me, as an interesting fact, that the lines are cut with
the grain of the wood, after the manner of Albert Durer, and some
of the old German masters—a process which has been abandoned
by modern European wood-engravers." I do not recall any
illustrations (apart from a possible Frontispiece) in the books of
the former tests.
[Note 3.] Tales of Old Japan deals largely with elderly people,
though " old " may of course be taken in a two-fold sense. The
frontispiece represents nine Japanese warriors with spears and
swords gathered around an elderly Japanese who is seated. Under-
neath is written :
" The Eonins invite Kotsuke No Suke to perform
Hara-Eiri." E.N.S. is described on page 13 as " some sixty years
of age." On the first page of Contents (numbered ix) I found :
" The Story of the old man who made withered trees to blossom."
In List of Elustrations (numbered xi) I found :
..." The old
man who caused withered trees to flower. ..." On page 3 : . . .
" Some are venerable men, with thin grey hair. . .
."
[Note 4.] The title of the top book begins with the initial T,
Tales.
[Note 5.] The box was the same as that used in the two former
experiments. On two sides of the box are brass handles which
rattle when the box is lifted. This latter point would be known to
the notetaker.
[Note 6.] On the last page but two of the testbook Tales of Old
Japan (omitting blank fly-leaves) I found :
" Hereward the Wake."
There is, of course, much more chance of the result being due
to coincidence when a numbered page is not given—nevertheless,
it must be noted that in this case the word " Hereward " was found
on one of the pages examined first by me in the top book, for,
having failed to find it at the beginning of the book, I turned, as
my custom is, to the end to see if it was there. The word " Here-
ward " is conspicuous as it is in good black type, as are the other
words on this page.
[Note 7.] Mr Fonnereau told us that on his dressing-table, about
2—3 yards from the box, there was a round box shaped much like
a barrel. He brought the box for us to see. It is small, approxi-
mately 4 inches in height, and has bands round it which enhance
the resemblance to a barrel.
[Note 8.] We were told by Mr Fonnereau that it would seem
probable that what is here referred to is the white marble slab on
the wash-stand which was close to where he kept the box in his
room.
[Note 9.] Mr Fonnereau wrote later :
" The knob mentioned in
my tests is the knob on a little hand blotter—the closest object (I
should think) to the '
white expanse '
of my washing stand."
146 Rev. W. S. Irving and Theodore Besterman [part
[Note 10.] On Mr Fonnereau's recent return from his holidays
he tells me that the maid apologised for not having a curtain over
his wardrobe. The maid said that the curtain rod kept slipping
down.
A copy of my notes 7, 8 and 10, given above, were sent by me to
Mr Fonnereau for confirmation on 13 October 1931. He replied :
" I am glad to endorse the three statements given in your letter
dated 13 Oct. 1931. The date of my return from my holiday in
1930 was Tuesday, 2 September 1930. [Signed] N. C. Fonnereau."
3. A question of resemblance.
Extract from a Sitting with Mrs Leonard, 22 September 1930.
Sitter : Rev. W. S. Irving. Recorder : Mr N. C. Fonnereau.
[Feda.] . . . The Tarpauline One. . . . I'll go into the same room,
a bright, good-sized sitting-room. . . . Oh ! There's a table in this
room, Mr Bill, that interests Dora. " It's rather similar to one that
you've got at home, and it isn't a common table, it isn't the sort of
pattern that you'd find in anybody's home. It's not a new one
it's a good many years old, and "
—oh well ! I'll just explain that
to him ! Mr Bill ! She was trying to feel it, and she felt as if it had
either a ledge on it, or a drawer in it, in which things are kept. She
felt paper, Mr Bill, paper. And string, Dora ? That is what she
says, Mr Bill. Paper and string were two of the things she felt
under it, do you see ? Paper and string. There's something too
on the ledge, or in the drawer, whichever it is she's not quite certain,
looks to her like a small ball, Mr Bill, a round circular object that
you can roll about, so she suppose that you can call that " a ball ",
Mr Bill, do you see ? Dora very serious about it, Mr Bill, 'cos there's
plenty of round things called by some special name, isn't there ? . . .
[Note 1.]
She wouldn't have noticed the table, Mr Bill, but it was like one
of her's. You mean, Mr Bill's, Dora ! She says, what's yours are
her's. This table, though it isn't a very small one, gets moved
about—shifted about, Mr Bill. It gets shifted about. She doesn't
mean just like when a place is being cleaned in the ordinary way,
but a rather peculiar way. Something has to be got at near this
table, Mr Bill. . . . [Note 2.] There's a photo of someone passed
over close to this table. As you're standing against the table you
can feel it. The person is a man, and he's not one who's gone
recently, he's gone some time ago, some years ago. Not the Com-
municator of the Tarpauline lady—not her regular Communicator.
[W. S. I.] Right.
[Feda.] Impression from her mind was that the man whose
photo was there had been a sort of teacher, or instructor, Mr Bill.
122] Evidential Extracts from Sittings with Mrs Leonard 147
[Note 3.] What's the bar doing there ?
[W. S. I.J Bar ?
[Feda.] Like a rod, or bar's been left there. Mr Bill ! There's
a rod or bar close to the table there, just as if somebody had brought
a long bar or rod into the room, and had put it down there just by
the table, just as if they'd laid it there, Mr Bill, and she says she
doesn't know what the thing's for, but she knows it's there. . . .
[Note 4.]
The above tests, which are from Mrs Kingsley Tarpey's flat, are
given because they are all more or less concerned with the table
they followed some booktests not given here. The tests were
kindly verified for me by Miss Newton on 23 September 1930.
Further information was given to Miss Newton, by Mrs Tarpey,
later, in letters.
Extract from Miss Newton's notes.
[Note 1.] "Table: Chippendale period, old oak, flaps with
rounded corners. Legs fluted. One drawer, containing much
string. Until recently Mrs Tarpey said, labels. Something rolled
as we opened the drawer—a small wooden pepper-mill lying on its
side ; circular top and bottom ; rolls every time the drawer is
moved."
Extract from a letter by Mrs Kingsley Tarpey.
" The table described is said to be Chippendale, and is about of
that period. It has a drawer at one end in which string, labels,
cork-screws and some oddments are kept. I used the last luggage
label from there recently. There is paper far back in the drawer
wrapping some tapers : also there is paper lining it. . . . The table
had leaves that drop, with rounded corners, and the legs have a
long sparse fluted pattern." [Mrs Tarpey sent a sketch of the
table, which is described there as Antique Pembroke Table. . . .
The table, when leaves are up, is almost square.]
Extracts from Miss Newton's notes.
[Note 2.] " [The table] gets moved about nearly every time they
have a sitting."
[Note 3.] " Standing by the table one faces a portrait of Mrs
Tarpey's father. Put your hand out and you touch it."
Extract from Mrs Tarpey's letter.
" Above the table is a life-size portrait of my father in pastel,
done after his death from a photograph. He died in 1888. . . . The
latter years of his life he gave a great deal of his time to public
148 Rev. W. 8. Irving and Theodore Besterman [part
speaking, doing definitely educative work on the Irish question,
and the Eastern question, in working men's clubs, and generally
among working class audiences. ... I think it would be quite
right to speak of him as a teacher, as many younger men in our
circle sat at his feet."
Extract from Miss Newton's notes.
[Note 4.]
" There was no rod or bar near. Mrs Tarpey showed
me a window rod which is often in the room and was much used
for hanging pictures from about the middle of August for about a
fortnight."
It will be remembered that I have never been to Mrs Tarpey'
flat, and have therefore no knowledge of what her furniture is like.
After her verification, Miss Newton wrote to me for a description
of such tables of mine as might be in question. In reply, I sent
sketches of four of my tables and a brief description of each. I
understand that Mrs Tarpey and Miss Newton, having indepen-
dently looked at my sketches, came to the same conclusion as to the
table most like the one at Mrs Tarpey's, and it was not until after
this that I was allowed to see the sketch, and description of that
table. In certain particulars it resembles somewhat closely my
wife's own writing-table in my drawing-room. Our table is of
rose-wood, length 39| inches, width 18 inches, height 28| inches.
The chief resemblance is in the flaps, rounded corners, thin carved
legs—I think you would call them fluted—they have grooves down
the two front legs, and there being one drawer.
Note by Mrs Kingsley Tarpey, 22 August 1931.
" None of the subjects referred to in Mr Irving's sittings have
come up in my sittings with Mrs Leonard. Feda has mentioned
that she had been to the flat, and that she liked the room, " the
nice light room that Dora likes." One other attempt, not very
successful, has been made by another Communicator through Feda
to give a booktest at the flat. There has been no conversation
between Mrs Leonard and myself about the room or the flowers or
the balcony. Mrs Leonard knows that I am a painter, and has a
picture of mine, but so far as I know, that would be the whole
extent of her knowledge."
4. The paper about the dentist.
This test differs from most of the other tests in this paper in that
it may be said to have been taken from my mind, i.e. there is
nothing given that may not have been known to me years ago and
122] Evidential Extracts from Sittings with Mrs Leonard 149
long since forgotten. It is, however, I think, original and interesting
enough to be worth recording.
Extract from a Sitting with Mrs Leonard, 29 January 1931.
Sitter : Rev. W. S. Irving. Recorder : Mr Theodore
Besterman.
[Feda.] . . . She's got blue on this morning, Dora has. Oh ! She
put it on rather specially. She hoped it would make you remember
something you used to be fond of seeing her in. Journey ? She
says, " Journeys—journeys—journeys," Mr Bill.
[W. S. I.] I remember.
[Feda.] And you were thinking of a special journey which she
wore this thing—the blue. You were reminded of it and thinking of
it, and something that worried her about a teeth [sic], at that time,
that you will probably have forgotten but that you'll remember
after. Have you got that, Mr Bill ?
" The journey, the blue dress,
and teeth." She's almost sure you'll have forgotten. You'll have
to think back about the teeth. She thought a lot at the time. She
hadn't wanted it to happen just then. It was a noosance just then.
That's why she remembers it, but she didn't expect you to, Mr
Bill. While I'm talking about that—Whatever did you keep the
paper about the dentist for so long at home—at home ? You don't
want it now. You kept it a long time at home. You've still got
it. 'Tisn't any good. Thinks there's an eight on it.
[W. S. I.] Eight ?
[Feda.] Eight. Have you got that, Mr Bill ? Now she had to
bring these in then, in case she forgot them. . . .
[Note.] It is correct that I had recently been recalling a visit to
a dentist which I had once made with my wife when she had gone
there to have a tooth out with gas. When I pass near Clarence
Street in Gloucester where the dentist lives, I often recall this
visit, for my wife was not bothered as a rule with tooth trouble,
and I can only recall this one occasion on which I went with her to
have one out. She seemed to me long in coming round and I was
nervous. My recollection, at the time of the sitting, as to the year
or time of year when the above took place was vague, simply that
it was not so very long before my wife's death. When I came to
verify the test I hunted through my wife's personal receipts, account
book, writing-table, etc., but could find nothing like the paper
described. It seemed very doubtful whether any such paper was in
existence, as we generally paid at the time for matters of this kind,
—I always did myself. Having exhausted my wife's belongings, I
turned to the house-file of receipts, which dates back to 1912.
Starting then and working forwards through, I suppose, some
hundreds of papers, I at last discovered the following :
150 Rev. W. 8. Irving and Theodore Besterman [part
"12 Clarence Street, Gloucester.
December 1914.
Mrs Irving, Oxenhall Vicarage, nr. Newent.
Nov. 16 Repairing and stopping 2s. 6d.
Dec. 8 Gas and Drs Fee - - £1 Is. Qd.
£1 3s. 6d.
Received with thanks,
C. Fox, 2 January 1915."
It will be seen from the above that the " eight " said to be on the
paper shows the actual date of the month on which the visit to the
dentist of which I had been thinking took place. And further, the
fact that this was in December makes it practically certain that my
wife would be wearing her blue coat lined with fur. She only had
one, and always wore it on " journeys " in winter. We live about
ten miles from the dentist's and probably went there and back by
train. Motor buses did not, I think, run then. The receipt has
been handed to Miss Newton.
5. A letter test.
Extract from a Sitting with Mrs Leonard, 30 April 1925. Sitter :
Rev. W. S. Irving. Recorder : Mrs Dingwall.
[Feda.] . . . She's got another little test for you, but the one she
mean now is to welcome you when you get home.
[W. S. I.] Very nice.
[Feda.] Mr Bill ! You're not to go and look for it in a case or
anything, it will be in front of your eyes . . . when you get home.
It is something that you'll have to read because she sees a name
that will remind you of very happy times that you used to have with
Dora, a name of a place. It'll be facing you when you get in. It's
like a booktest, but it isn't from a book, but something that will
be awaiting you and which will be—No !
—and which you will pick
up and look at. You'll have to, Mr Bill. You'll do it in the ordinary
course of events. Now, Mr Bill, on this paper there's a little sign
—don't think I've got it quite right, Mr Bill, but it looks a little
bit like, a cross or a letter X. Time is mentioned on it too. A
question of time is mentioned on this paper, too, like a date or an
o'clock.
[W. S. I.] Old clock ?
[Feda.] O'clock. What means time of day ! You know what
an o'clock means ! That's all about that, Mr Bill, but it will be a
curious connecting link with you and Dora, and a place. Not the
place you're living in now, but another place where you were happy
together. . . .:
122] Evidential Extracts from Sittings with Mrs Leonard 151
[Note.] Before leaving home I had arranged with the Newent
Post Office people that my letters should be forwarded to me in
London from Monday, 27 April, after the first delivery, to Thursday,
30 April 1925 inclusive, but that letters arriving after that date
on the Friday or Saturday—should not be forwarded. On my
return home, on Saturday, 2 May 1925, I found on my dining-room
table some half a dozen letters and two newspapers. One of these
letters—a circular—to some extent tallies with Feda's description.
It was addressed to Mrs Irving and, perhaps for that reason, was
not forwarded to me early in the week, though it bears the post-
mark Cheltenham, Paid |d, 3.30 p.m. 28 April 1925. Inside was
merely a printed card advertising the Spring and Summer models
of a Cheltenham tradesman named Ayris, at whose shop my wife
often used to make purchases. A monogram in gilded letters was
at the top of the card. This monogram, which is approximately
f inches by | inches at extreme points, appears to be of the letters
W.A. or M.A., though it is not certain. In the centre of the mono-
gram, two curved lines bisect one another making a figure something
like a cross, X. In the bottom left-hand corner were the words
" Telephone 820." In the bottom right-hand corner " Promenade,
Cheltenham." Cheltenham has fuller happy associations for my
wife and me than any other town, as so much of our time has been
spent in it, or within easy reach of it. A curious point about this
test is that the postman tells me this letter was not delivered at
my Vicarage till the morning of my return—2 May—so that at the
time of the sitting, the circular was at the Newent Post Office.
Assuming that this circular is what was referred to through Feda,
it is important to note that Ayris' s circulars seem to be still sent
to my house periodically, i.e. I remember having received them
before. Unless, however, these Spring adverts are always sent out
on the same date, it is difficult to believe that my subconscious
mind can have anticipated the receipt of the circular—though not
perhaps impossible. The circular has been sent to the S.P.K.
Rooms with the script.
Part II.
A SERIES OF IMPRESSIONS FROM A HOUSE UNKNOWN TO
THE MEDIUM, SITTER, AND RECORDER.
By Theodore Besterman.
The house here referred to is that of Mr and Mrs C. E. Stansfield,
70 Northcourt Avenue, Reading. Mrs Stansfield became a member
of the Society at the end of 1929. During Mr Irving's sitting with
Mrs Leonard of 20 November 1930 he received communications
apparently connected with Mrs Stansfield's brother. Mr and Mrs
Stansfield were not mentioned, but Mr Irving wrote to Mrs Stansfield,
who is his cousin, to verify the date of her brother's death, which
occurred thirteen days after the sitting. On 2 January 1931 Mr
Irving wrote that he thought (though the reference was not definite)
that Mrs Stansfield had been referred to at a sitting with Mrs Leonard
on 8 May 1930, as being possibly willing to allow a booktest to be
taken from her house. Mr and Mrs Stansfield consented to the
attempt being made.
Mr Irving had not seen Mrs Stansfield or any member of her family
for between thirty and forty years, and had never met Mr Stansfield
or been in Reading. 1
He met Mr Stansfield for the first time in
London on 1 May 1931. Neither on this occasion nor at the second
meeting mentioned below was any description given of Mr and Mrs
Stansfield's house.
On the day before, 30 April, Mr Irving had a sitting with Mrs
Leonard. At this sitting, during the Personal Control, the Com-
municator, in the midst of much else, spoke the following words :
" Wilt ! Another name I want you to think of too. A name starting
with Stan. I feel that name so near you now. I think it's linked
up with you. (Mr Irving : Follow him up and take a booktest.) Yes.
I'd like to. Will ! it's a nice condition, quite a nice one, quite a nice
one. The impression I get is of someone who would be interested in
the subject. Not quite as we are, from a different standpoint."
Mr Irving read this passage the following day to Mr Stansfield,
who expressed the hope that a test would be given from his house
at the next sitting. This took place on 23 July 1931, when Feda
said :
" She went to two other places, Dora did, two, and found
she couldn't get anything. Something in both conditions held her
up. One of the places she went to felt quite empty, quite empty."
It is not unreasonable to interpret this as a reference to the house
of Mr Stansfield, who was at that time in hospital.
1
1 myself did not meet Mr and Mrs Stansfield until after the sitting of 24
September 1931, and knew nothing whatever about them.
152
[part 122] Extracts from Sittings with Mrs Leonard 153
Early in September 1931 Mr Irving wrote to Mr Stansfield asking
bim to arrange for his books not to be moved, in the bope tbat
booktests might be given in forthcoming sittings, the dates of
which were not given. On 19 September Mr Irving met Mr Stans-
field for the second time, in London. During the sitting on 22
September no tests were given from Reading as expected. Con-
sequently Mr Irving asked the communicator during the Personal
Control :
" (Will you try to go to the house of the person I men-
tioned the one I 2
called Stan and try and give the test on Thursday?)
Yes. Will ! I think it was thought about before." The sitting
here referred to was that of 24 September 1931, an extract from
which now follows.
Passages in which Feda appears to be quoting the Communicator
are placed in inverted commas. Words in round brackets were
spoken at the sitting by Mr Irving. Editorial comments in the
record are in square brackets ; those distinguished in addition by my
initials show variations between Mr Irving's record and mine. The
punctuation and division into paragraphs have been supplied by me.
Extract from a Sitting with Mrs Leonard on 21 September 1931.
Sitter : Rev. W. S. Irving. Recorder : Theodore Besterman.
[Feda:] [1.] . . . Mr Bill, she's
been to a place for some books,
not in boxes or anything, Mr
Bill, but just ordinary booktest.
To a place that you have been
wanting her to go to for some
time. You mentioned it last
sitting, she say, last sitting she
think, and you mentioned it also
at a previous sitting when you
were here before. (I remember.)
She is building up an S, S.
[2.] And isn't there a B to do
with it too ? Mr Bill, she is
building up an S, but there is a
name beginning with B con-
nected too. Perhaps you have
forgotten. It is possible you
don't even know it, but Dora is
right. Bur, bur, bur [Beh, beh,
beh. Th.B. Mr Irving's spelling
gives the sound better, but the
[1.] This is clearly a reference
to the Stansfield house.
[2.] Edward Vipond Ballard,
a friend and former colleague of
Mr Stansfield (quite unknown to
Mr Irving), died in January 1931.
Mr Stansfield saw him the night
before his death, helped his
widow with the necessary
arrangements, took control of
the funeral, raised a fund for Mrs
Ballard, and, in short, had been
2
This was a slip of the tongue for " the person you mentioned, the one you
called Stan ..."
154 Rev. W. S. Irving and Theodore Besterman [part
terminal r was not sounded]. It
isn't B, u, y, [by. Th. B.] or B
[Be. Th. B.] but like as if you
were going to say bull or but
[boott. Th. B. ;
boot, to rhyme
with soot]. Like that way,
Have you got that 1 The B per-
son is very much connected, but
he's passed over, Mr Bill. A
person interested in the place,
and the what you call the in-
mates. Those is lunatics ! No,
these people isn't lunatics, they'se
'markably sensible.
[3.] She says " the B person is
very interested with these indeed
and has a connection, link," she
call it, " with some books there.
B. The B isn't a christian name,
it's a surname." She says " I
think about seven letters in it,
about seven letters in it. Sur-
name Murrad, Murrad, Murrad,
Murrad [Barrett, Barrass, Bar-
rett, Berard. Th.B. ] I can't get
this quite. Murrad, Mallard
[Burrard. Th. B.]." Another
name she's giving. She's not
giving me a proper idea of the
beginning. Marrad [Barrard.
Th. B.]. No, I'll wait a minute
and see if she does it better.
[4.] Mr Bill, she know that you
know the place, you see, and she
showing me a room. Mr Bill, I
think there are two or three lots
of books in this room, not just
like a few books. You see there
are books in more than one part,
position, in the room. I dunno
what you mean, Dora ? In two
parts ? Dora say in two parts of
the room the books are put in
rather systematic position, sys-
tematic position. There are
very closely connected with the
name Ballard for several months
up to and beyond the time of the
sitting. It will be seen that this
name corresponds very closely
with the forms Mallard and Bar-
rard, as shown in the next para-
graph. Ballard, as stated in the
record, has seven letters in it.
[3.] The " connection with
some books there " is probably
an allusion to the fact that about
ten days before the sitting Mrs
Ballard brought to Mr Stans-
field's house three volumes of a
school magazine formerly edited
by Mr Ballard. These volumes
were in the house until the day
before the sitting.
[4.] It is not correct that Mr
Irving knows the place ; but the
statement may reasonably be
taken to mean, as it would in
ordinary conversation, " You
know of the place," or " You
know what place I'm talking
about." This is not, of course, a
separate point, but part of [1]
above.
It is clear from what follows
that the dining-room is intended,
but it is not correct that there
122] Evidential Extracts from Sittings with Mrs Leonard 155
some others that are placed
different, different form, differ-
ent position altogether.
[5.] Mr Bill, this feel like a
comfortable room, quite com-
fortable, as if someone had put
rather nice comfortable chairs in
it. Not a lot, Mr Bill, the chairs,
but just a few like comfortable
ones.
[6.] There's a, I think it's a
table in the room ; the one she
showing me not very big, heavy,
lumpy for its size, as if it would
weigh as much as a much bigger
table, really much bigger.
[7.] You know, Mr Bill, most
people in a room tries to get all
the wood the same like the furni-
ture, like Gladys [Mrs Leonard].
She like oak. You got some oak
too, Mr Bill. She like everything
all the same. In this room, the
one room, they hasn't matched
the wood like that ;
they'se got
two different kinds of wood alto-
gether in this room. " Three
kinds," Dora says, " to be cor-
rect." Yes, you got to be
correct ! Three kinds, three
kinds. (Yes.) Two very much
alike, but not the same wood ;
the third very unlike, very
different. Two browns and a
black, two browns and a black.
Mr" Bill, I don't think people
would notice it if they just enter
the room, perhaps even sat in it.
Have you got that ? (Yes.)
" But of course I try to notice
something," she says, " I try to,
something special."
are books in two (or more than
two) places, except that there
are a few on a table in addition
to those in the bookcase. Mr
Stansfield states that the books
are systematically arranged.
[5.] Mr Stansfield states that
his favourite armchair is in this
room, but that there are no
other specially comfortable
chairs in it.
[6.] There is a gate-legged
table in the room, which Mr
Stansfield states to be heavy for
its size.
[7.] There are two kinds of
wood in the room, from the
point of view of colour, black
oak and brown woods of different
kinds. But " to be correct
"
these two kinds are really three,
since the brown furniture con-
sists of oak and bentwood ("two
browns "). It must be added,
however, to be absolutely cor-
rect, that there are really four
kinds of wood, for the " oak
"
itself is of two kinds, genuine oak
and deal stained to match it.

in this room, a dog with rather a
long, fairly long face, long nose,
long nose. Not a what ? I know
what you mean. Not a Pamal-
anean [Pomeranian]. No. She
say, " I got the feeling of more
what you call a sporting dog. A
man's dog, you might call it.
Intelligent head, very intelligent
head. Long nose." (Right [This
expression is used by Mr Irving
simply as an encouraging way of
saying, " I've got that, go on."]).

Something ought to run on rol-
lers. I can't understand what

the thought, and I know I am
right." (Good [See the note at

Herbert Dicksee, in which a
shepherd and his collie are the

tion of course applies to a collie.
[9.] On 20 September 1931,
four days before the sitting, a
friend was telling Mr Stansfield
about the transportation of the
monument to the Duke of Well-
ington by road through Reading
on its way to Strathfieldsaye.
Mr Stansfield remarked, " How-
ever was it brought in one piece ;
it must have been brought on
rollers.
'
' This conversation took
place on the lawn just outside
the dining-room, and, according
to a statement signed by Mrs
Stansfield and Miss Mary Stans-
field, the remarks about the
moving of the monument on
rollers were repeated in the
dining-room. Mr Stansfield has
no recollection of this repetition.
The relevant details of the con-
versation on the lawn have been
corroborated in a signed state-
ment made by the friend above
referred to, who prefers to renrain
anonymous.
[10.] It is clear from points 5,
6, 7, 8, 17, that the room from
which the tests are taken is the
dining-room. Unfortunately,
the booktests are not clear.
122] Evidential Extracts from Sittings with Mrs Leonard 157
why I put it like that," she says.
(Yes.) " I took the lowest shelf
I could find. I didn't attempt to
go higher. I just took, counting
from the floor, the first shelf with
books on going upwards. 5th
volume, 5th. And I took the
5th book from the left, the 5th."
Wait a minute, Dora, 4. I've
got 4. Now wait a minute,
what's the other one % 4, is that
all ? No, oh, I see, Mr Bill ! I
was a bit puzzled ! She kept
building up a 4, and then she
done it again. She mean 4, 4,
forty-four. " On the 44th page
I feel there is a reference to
pictures, pictures, portraits, and
should remind you of some
pictures, portraits, you have at
home, an allusion to one, a
special one that you have at
home, you think a great deal of."
(Right.)
[11.] "On the same page as
the reference to pictures, will you
see if there are some words lower
on the page, lower, referring to
foreign titles, foreign royalties,
foreign titles, have you got that?
'
(Yes.)
There is no difficulty about the
shelf intended, as there is only
one set of shelves in the room.
But this is not divided into
sections.
Another difficulty occurs in
connection with the volume on
the shelf, for at its extreme left
is a pile of notebooks. In ac-
cordance with the usual practice
this pile must be counted as one
volume, especially as the adjoin-
ing books are big ones. On this
plan the fifth volume from the
left is an album of family photo-
graphs. The thick cardboard
" pages " are not numbered, and
the portrait in p. [44] is of .no
special interest to Mr Irving. On
the other hand, in the back of
this page, that is, in p. [43] is a
photograph of Mr Irving' s grand-
father. Now another portrait of
this grandfather hangs in the
dining-room of Mr Irving's sister,
with whom he had been staying
from 7-16 September, that is,
a few days before the sitting.
These particulars are corrobor-
ated in a signed statement by
Miss Irving. However, this does
not fully bear out the statement
in the record, which refers to Mr
Irving's own home, not to Miss
Irving's.
[11.] When the picture in page
[44] of the album is withdrawn,
the back of the portrait in page
[43] becomes visible. On it are
printed the words " Under the
patronage of Her Majesty the
Queen, H.R.H. The Prince of
Wales," followed by their re-
spective Coats of Arms (with the
mottoes in French and German),

[12.] Now will you take the
next book but one, going along
towards the right. That will be
the 7th book from the left side of
shelf, 7th. At the beginning, the
very beginning, the opening
page, I mean the opening page
refers to matters that the scribe
—him—[Feda points to Th.B.]
would be very interested in, has
been very much interested just
now, will be interested in im-
mediately just now, matters
affecting him just now at the
moment ; a kind of description
of conditions and things round
him at the moment. Have you
got that, Mr Bill ? (Yes.)
[13.] Wait a minute. "Violet,
violet. Will you see if there is
a mention of violet on this page,
the same page ?
" Dora say
" while I was getting this, I kept
getting the idea of the word
violet, violet, violet. Didn't see
it, felt it. May be a name," she
says, " but got it so strongly."
(Did you say, got it so strongly?)
" Yes."
and the photographer's name.
This is the nearest approach to
the statement in the record.
[12.] This is Mr Stansfield's
family Bible (London, Eyre and
Strahan, 1813). In the Trans-
lators^ Address to the King
(which apart from the titlepage,
is on the opening page) occurs
the well-known passage about
the " censures of ill-meaning and
discontented persons," the " cal-
umniations and hard interpreta-
tions of other men," and the
" bitter censures and unchari-
table imputations," against
which the Translators felt them-
selves to be " supported within
by the truth and innocency of a
good conscience." These words
appear to me not inappropriate
to recent foreign attacks on me
in connection with my work.
See, for instance, Count Perov-
sky's quotation in the Journal
(xxvii. 175) of an article in
which I am accused of being an
emissary of the " atheistic Inter-
national ", and cp. Journal,
xxvii. 124.
[13.] There is nothing about
violets on this page, but it is
clear from the record that this
word is not necessarily a book-
test. The only sense in which it
would appear to apply to Mr and
Mrs Stansfield's house would be
a prophetic one. At about 12.30
on the day of the sitting, that is,
actually during the sitting, but
about an hour after the relevant
words were spoken, Mrs Stans-
field brought Mr Stansfield a
bunch of violets to smell, and
they had some conversation
122] Evidential Extracts from Sittings with Mrs Leonard 159
[14.]
" Within a span of this
book, it seems to me there's a
book that deals with theology,
theology ;
something to do with
a modern view, modern view
description given, the title given
on the outside would lead you to
believe it was a new light, a new
light on religion, yet the book
itself didn't appear to be very
recent or new to me." (Right.)
[15.] Moving a little back to-
wards the left on the same shelf
—there are not many, she says,
to look at—between the 1st book
she gave you on the left, the first
book was the 5th, you know ;
between this and beginning of
shelf on outside there's an allu-
sion to a joke, something that
would remind you of a great joke
that you and Dora used to have
together, a joke, a joke, a joke
that you and Dora used to have
together. A joke, a joke, a joke.
The joke, of course, is an old one
now, but it is one you have been
thinking of recently, so she
thinks you will be reminded of it
at once.
[16.] Now, Mr Bill, ask if there
is a light in this room. She mean
an artificial light that can't be
used ; she felt there is a light
here that should affect those
books ; it must be near them
it can't be used [repeated four
times]. And it can't be used, Mr

about them, as it seemed unusual
and unexpected to gather violets
in September.
[14.] This just misses being a
good hit. On the second shelf
up is a copy of Dr James Moff-
att's translation of the Bible
(first published in 1913), of
which it is very true to say that
it is not a new book, but that it
throws " a new light " on reli-
gion. The words " a new trans-
lation " appear on the covers of
the three volumes. Unfortun-
ately these volumes are more
than a span from the Bible, 2 ft.
7 inches, to be precise.
[15.] Counting on the method
described in [9] above, the 2nd
and 3rd volumes on the shelf,
that is, between the beginning of
the shelf and the 5th volume, are
two volumes of Pictures from
Punch. These volumes did re-
mind Mr Irving of a joke of
which the Communicator was
very fond (though he cannot say
when he thought of it last),
especially as Mrs Irving had been
very fond of Punch.
[16.] This does not appear to
apply to anything in the room.
160 Rev. W. 8. Irving and Theodore Besterman [part
[17.] Mr Bill, when you look
out of this window I get a feeling
—Dora is making me feel this
there is something if you look
one way, something is blocking
the view, you can only see a
short distance ;
by turning your
head and looking the other way
you can see a long way.
[18.] Is it that house, Dora, or
one near it ? Mr Bill, right up
close to this house, is there some-
thing to be sold, do you know ?
Dora says, for sale, for sale. And
it feels something close, right up
where I am, close.
[19.] What you talking about,
Dora, slissiter ? What's a solici-
tor to do with this house just
now? Dora wonders if they have
been talking a great deal about
a solicitor in this house just now.
Seem very strong there indeed.
[20.] Will you ask if the name
—it's a common name—but will
you ask if the name Evans has
been mentioned there, talked of
there at all ? Evans, Evans.
Have you got that, Mr Bill ?
(Yes.)
Now, Mr Bill, that's all from
that place. It's all she could be
sure of getting. (A nice lot.)
[17.] In this room a person
standing with his back to the
stove would have on his left a
small window, the view through
which is blocked by a tree, facing
him a large window, the view
from which is blocked partly by
a garage and partly by a fence
with trees beyond, and on his
right two windows with a glazed
door between, through which
there is a fine distant view ex-
tending to ten miles.
[18.] The house next door but
one and at least two nearly op-
posite are for sale and have
boards up to that effect.
[19.] There had been occa-
sional conversation about solici-
tors in connection with the
Ballard fund and in connection
with the affairs of Mr Stans-
field's sister, whose husband had
died during the summer. Letters
referring to solicitors in both
cases were lying on the desk.
[20.] The wedding of Mr and
Mrs Stansfield's friend M. Evans,
which took place three days
after the sitting, had been men-
tioned several times during the
weeks before the sitting.
All the above statements referring to Mr and Mrs Stanfield's
house are based on signed statements by Mr Stansfield, corroborated,
so far as they are concerned, by Mrs Stansfield and Mrs Ballard.
The books (except for the album) were verified in the presence of
a medical man whose name is known to me.
122] Evidential Extracts from Sittings with Mrs Leonard 161
It will be seen, to sum up, that of the above 20 statements, ten
are correct (nos. 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 9, 17, 18, 19, 20), six were partly correct
(nos. 4, 5, 7, 10, 14, 15), three are doubtful (nos. 11, 12, 13), and
only one appears to be wrong (no. 16). Not all the hits are of equal
value, of course, but several are decidedly striking, particularly
the approximation to the name Ballard, the name Evans, and the
reference to rollers. On the whole, taking the circumstances into
consideration, this series of 20 impressions provides good evidence
that knowledge of Mr and Mrs StansflekTs house was obtained m
some supernormal manner. The important point in this connection
is the fact that there is no direct link between the medium and the
Stansfields' house, since the house is unknown to medium, sitter
and recorder, and nobody in the Stansneld family has sat with
Mrs Leonard. If the result be due to telepathy, it is in part telepathy
of a very unusual, if not unique kind, since the medium would on
this hypothesis have received an impression of conversations in a
house unknown to her and not even having any connection with
that house.

Olivier Leroy, Les hommes salamandres. Recherches et reflexions
sur Vincomhustibilite du corps humain. 8vo, pp. 93. Paris :
Desclee de Brouwer et Cie., 1931. Price 7 fr.
To M. Olivier Leroy we are already indebted for a book on levitation
which may well, I think, be regarded as a standard work on the
subject ; in the present little book we have a valuable contribution
to the study of another also much disputed, though perhaps less dis-
puted phenomenon: human " incombustibility " or " fire-proofness"
in exceptional circumstances.
M. Leroy is a devout Roman Catholic ; no wonder therefore that
among the evidence he ably marshals lives of saints figure con-
spicuously. Now I am far from denying that in this domain as in
that of levitation hagiography may—perhaps does—supply us with
evidence which must not always be lightly set aside. But why refer
to " martyrs' lives " as to which the writer himself admits that in
them " everything occurs in an epic atmosphere where history
suffocates "
(p. 16) ? The author's thesis, favourable to occasional
human " incombustibility ", gains nothing by such testimony—if we
may call it " testimony "
—but rather the reverse.
In the next chapter, on medieval fire-ordeals, we meet with the
extraordinary case of Emma, daughter of Richard II., duke of
Normandy, and mother of St Edward, who undertook to refute
rumours current as to the character of her relations with the Bishop
of Winchester by walking barefooted over nine (possibly fourteen)
red-hot coulters. The experiment succeeded. What is the evidential
value of this " life " I do not know, but it is perhaps significant that,
as pointed out by M. Leroy, the very sceptical Bayle seems, in his
Dictionary, to be ready to believe in such facts.
In chapter 3 we meet with D. D. Home, an Englishman called
Richardson (end of 17th century), whose performances at Lady
Sunderland's are described by John Evelyn, Bruno Kiong, a
Chinese, and others.
Marie Sonnet, nicknamed the Salamander, is the subject of the
next chapter. This lady flourished in the second quarter of the
18th century, was connected with the Saint Medard " convulsionists"
162
[PART 122] Review 163
in Paris, if not one of them, and figures in a protocol, dated 1 May
1731 and signed by eleven persons, which M. Leroy quotes. An
English peer (" milord Edouard de Rumond Perth "), two priests,
Carre de Montgeron, and other persons of position are among the
signatories. Marie Sonnet is alleged to have remained lying for
thirty-six minutes (with intervals) over a very fierce chimney-fire,
her head resting on one footstool and her feet on the other, without
any harm being done either to her body or to the sheet in which
she was wrapped (she had no clothes on). " Sometimes the flames
rose over her, which seemed to us quite supernatural ". How, I
wonder, can we explain in a " normal " way such an account,
unless we impugn the authenticity of the protocol ?
In chapter 5 we are brought in touch with the fire-walk, Polynesian
and Indian. Here we have before us an eye-witness's testimony
whose value can hardly be over-estimated. Mgr Despatures, (now)
Roman Catholic bishop of Mysore, narrates in detail an extra-
ordinary performance of the kind witnessed by him in 1921 in the
Park of the Royal palace of Mysore. The performer was a Turk
who did not enter the names himself, but many people present did.
As the Royal musicians were passing through them the Bishop
noticed that the flames seemed to avoid the instruments they were
carrying " et effleuraient les feuilles de musique sans les enrlammer
"
(p. 42). M. Leroy has obtained valuable corroborative evidence
from four other eye-witnesses. Their statements confirm in a
general way Mgr Despatures's account, and the fact that they are
not free from discrepancies, though unfortunate, is after all of
secondary importance.
The list of references to cases of " fire-walking " given in various
publications which the reader will find on pp. 72-3 of M. Leroy's
little book is not quite complete. A recent and very striking case
described in our Journal (xxiv. 278-84) has remained unknown to
him. However, it is satisfactory to note that he refers more than
once to the S.P.R. publications.
After a chapter on " theories " and some fifteen pages of " notes
and documents ", the book closes with a letter of Abbe Journet's
to the writer. Both the latter and the Abbe are chiefly interested,
so far as the theoretic aspect of the problem is concerned, in the
examination of the question whether human incombustibility is of
a " natural " or a " supernatural " origin. And if " supernatural ",
of what character : whether angelic, diabolical or divine. Into
this side of the question I will not enter.
I cannot however refrain from quoting a significant passage.
"Everywhere and always," M. Leroy says, "the supernatural is
characterised by a certain shyness. % Man's incombustibility is
undeniable ; it remains however relative both in time and as to
164 Review [part 122]
the violence of the fire. . . . Wounds close themselves at Lourdes, but
new limbs do not grow [my italics]. The body of those levitated does
not rise high nor go far "
(p. 75).
To me this is prima facie evidence (I do not say absolute evidence)
that the so-called religious supernatural—supposing it to exist—
is not supernatural in the strict sense of the word, but that we have
here to deal with facts at best supernormal and subject to laws
which we may hope to fathom—if not to master—some day. The
simplest explanation is not always the right one, it is true, but
surely there is a good deal to be said in support of such a suggestion.
For otherwise such a " shyness "—a shyness much to be regretted
—would be much harder to explain.

EXPERIMENTS IN SUPERNORMAL PERCEPTION
AT A DISTANCE 1
By S. G. Soal
PART I
PRELIMINARY EXPERIMENTS
Introduction. Experiments in telepathy in which the agent and
percipient are separated by a distance of many miles possess one
indisputable advantage over those where agent and percipient work
in the same room or in adjoining rooms. In the latter type of ex-
periment it is extremely difficult to rule out entirely the possibility
that the agent or transmitter may imwittingly and unintentionally
convey information to the percipient or guesser by means of slight
movements, changes of tone, facial expression and the like. In a
word, the guesser may be getting clues through his ordinary channels
of sense though neither he nor the agent may be aware of it.
Such accidental conveyance of knowledge is hardly to be assumed
in cases where the agent and percipient are miles apart at the time
of the experiment provided always that reasonable precautions have
been taken in selecting and guarding the objects intended for
transmission. Deliberate collusion between the experimenters and
percipients is still, of course, a contingency to be reckoned with, but
for reasons which will be apparent later I feel perfectly certain will
not be suspected in the present experiments.
In spite of their indubitable advantage in excluding a direct
transfer of ideas by normal means experiments at a distance are
relatively rare in comparison with those in which the parties con-
cerned are in close proximity. Nor can it be claimed, I think, that
such experiments as are on record have been remarkably successful
or for the most part conclusive in any way. There are, of course,
scattered throughout the annals of the society numerous cases of
apparent spontaneous perception at a distance and in certain of
these the wealth and convergence of detail are so circumstantial as
to make chance coincidence an unlikely explanation.
1
[As in the case of the recently published report on experiments in clair-
voyance (Proceedings, xxxix. 375-414), the reader must be warned that the
results of the experiments have been entirely negative. Hon. Ed.]
m 165
166 8. G. Soal [part
Next to the spontaneous cases we have a type of experimentation
which is best illustrated by the Miles-Ramsden 1
and Wales-
Samuels 2
records. In the latter example the agent, here represented
by Mr Hubert Wales, did not as a rule deliberately choose an object
or event to be transmitted at a definite time, but allowed the
percipient, Miss Samuels, to post him details of her dreams which
were then compared with any appropriate events that had happened
in Mr Wales's environment during the preceding day. A similar
procedure was adopted in many of the Miles-Ramsden experiments.
The scope for chance coincidence under such conditions is of course
extremely large and practically incalculable, and moreover in cases
where the percipient can picture the type of scenery in which the
agent is situated, he or she has a tolerable chance of scoring hits by
imagining events natural to that scenery. A propos of Mr Wales's
experiments I must mention that during the months of August-
September 1926, at Miss Samuels's suggestion, I assumed the role
of Mr Wales and received every day from Miss Samuels a copy of
her dreams and impressions. During the whole of this experiment
I was staving near Bettws-y-Coed in North Wales, while Miss
Samuels, whom at that period I had corresponded with but never
met in the flesh, remained in London. The result was practically
a complete failure. I must add, however, in fairness to Miss
Samuels, that while she might easily have seen me climbing moun-
tains and peering down precipices, she in fact did nothing of the
kind, and the type of dream she described would I believe have had
an equal chance of being realised in the flats of Essex or on the
hills of Wales.
So far as my own experiments with Miss Samuels are concerned,
I should declare unhesitatingly that there was no supernormal
perception on her part, but I confess that when I came to read Mr
Wales's long report, I felt curiously unable to make up my mind
whether the most striking coincidences there recorded were genuine
cases of telepathy or only very lucky hits. But in such cases as
the " Hannah Blodgett " case of Mrs Piper and in many of my own
experiences with Mrs Cooper, I have never entertained any serious
doubt that the coincidences were due to something more than the
blind play of chance.
My recent experience with the guessing capabilities of over 600
people for a period of over a year has only confirmed me in the view
that the success of such mediums as Mrs Piper, Mrs Leonard, and
Mrs Cooper, cannot, whatever else their explanation, be ascribed
totally to chance.
I have found that the average guesser experimenting over many

weeks under conditions which I shall presently describe, wins indeed
a partial success at long intervals, but does not succeed in piling
up one sharply defined success upon another.
But in the Wales-Samuels records, as in so much of the work in
experimental telepathy with objects ill-adapted to statistical
computation, there is a vague intangible quality about even the
best hits. Many of the remarks of the percipient can indeed be
made to apply to circumstances in the environment of the specified
agent if a too rigid time limit is not imposed, but one feels that one
could fit these same remarks to the day's experience of many
another individual in the world. In short, one feels that the
coincidences are not sufficiently detailed to produce a conviction
that they are uniquely applicable to one set of circumstances and
to no other. The same observation, of course, would apply to a fair
amount of the material obtained at Mrs Leonard's sittings at which
the time limit is often so wide as to be practically non-existent, but
I feel certain that in a series of sittings like the Troubridge-Eadclyfi'e-
Hall series, the ensemble of statements furnished over the entire
period would not be applicable to any other persons than the actual
sitters or their immediate circle.
Experiments in telepathy at a distance in which the conditions
are more rigid and sharply defined than those described in the Miles-
Ramsden or Wales-Samuels reports have been recorded from time
to time during the past twenty years. We have, for instance, the
experiments of Usher and Burt 1
in 1907, in which an agent in
Bristol attempted to transmit drawings and playing cards tele-
pathically to a percipient in London at pre-arranged times. In
a second series by the same authors the agent was in Prague and
the percipient in London. The resemblance between the drawings
of percipient and agent claimed by Messrs Usher and Burt as
" successes " appears in my judgment to have been so occasional
and so slight as to be practically non-existent. Thirty attempts
were made to transmit the image of a playing card, and here the
experimenters seem to have been more successful. I have scored
the first 25 of these guesses on Fisher's system, and the mean score
is 16-11, which gives a deviation from the theoretical mean (11-18)
corresponding to 2-46 x standard deviation. Such a result might
be expected to occur by chance about once in 33 such sets of 25
guesses. The result is suggestive, but of course inconclusive.
Of recent years various experiments of a similar kind have been
carried out by individual members of M. Rene Warcollier's group
for experimental telepathy, the agents and percipients being in
1
Annates des Sciences Psychiques (1910), xx. 14-21, 40-53. One saving
virtue of the work of Usher and Burt is the detailed description of every
experiment. We are not given snippets.
168 8. G. Soal [part
different parts of France. A number of attempts at transmission
of ideas and drawings from New York to Paris and vice versa were
made in 1924 between an American group under the direction of
Professor Gardner Murphy, and a French group under M. Rene
Warcollier.
To form a critical estimate of either Warcollier's home experi-
ments (carried out in Paris at the Institut International Meta-
psychique or elsewhere) or of his trans-Atlantic attempts, is ex-
tremely difficult for several reasons. M. Warcollier is an inde-
fatigable experimenter, extremely ingenious in planning new
experiments, and his enthusiasm has given a great stimulus to the
study of telepathy on the Continent and in America. Moreover,
he has brought considerable powers of introspection and psycho-
logical insight to bear on the interpretation of his results. But as
M. Warcollier's methods and conclusions diverge very considerably
from those of the present investigation, a few suggestions and
friendly criticisms will not, I hope, be out of place. 1
In the first place it does not seem to me that M. Warcollier has
paid quite sufficient attention to the work of demonstrating beyond
cavil the basic fact of telepathy. He has perhaps been a little too
occupied with the psychological mechanism of the process. His
various reports consist largely of collections of favourable examples
which seem to be expressly chosen to illustrate various aspects of
the mechanism of transmission and reception. Some of these
examples of telepathy are certainly striking, but I do not think
their individual quality is sufficiently high to compel belief in their
supernormal character. Although the subject matter chosen for
transmission—consisting as it does of complicated sketches,
grotesque combinations of objects, gestures, etc.—precludes a
strict application of the laws of probability, yet I do not think this
need prevent M. Warcollier from instituting a series of control
experiments to test his fundamental hypothesis of telepathy.
A large number of drawings executed by his various agents and
percipients might be copied on to similar slips of cardboard and
these mixed in a bag. A committee could then draw out a con-
siderable number of pairs or trios of sketches from the bag and
adjudicate marks according to the amount of resemblance shown
by each pair or group of sketches. Corresponding pairs or groups
could then be chosen from Warcollier's actual experiments and
scored in a similar way. This is, of course, merely intended as a
very rough suggestion of the way in which a control might be
organised.
Another suggestion I would make is that M. Warcollier should, in
his reports, give us more information as to the exact conditions
1
See also my letter in the Journal 8.P.R. (1931), xxvii. 130-5.
123] Experiments in Supernormal Perception 169
under which each evening's work is carried out. I can perhaps best
illustrate my meaning by an example. On p. 42 (Plate 1) of his
Conference sur la Telepathic. Experimentale (1926) M. Warcollier
records that on 24 October 1925 M. De. drew a sketch resembling
part of a flight of stairs, while on the same evening Mme M. drew
an outline which bears a certain resemblance to the drawing of
M. De. One would like to be told (a) whether the drawings were
executed at the same time and, if not, what was the interval of time
between them, (b) how many sketches were made by M. De. and
Mme M. in the course of the evening, (c) if several sketches were
made by one or both, what was the guiding principle of selection ?
It is, of course, certain that if vast numbers of experiments are
made week after week and year after year, chance alone will produce
coincidences of varying degrees of complexity, and a judicious
selection of suitable cases could doubtless be made which would
appear to illustrate a theory of telepathy previously held by the
experimenter or even suggest to his mind a novel theory. But if
these cases are not really cases of telepathy, what becomes of the
theory ?
Moreover, it appears to me that many of the psychological
phenomena noted by M. Warcollier are quite consistent with other
hypotheses than that of telepathy. When, for instance, two
members of M. Warcollier's group draw sketches on the same
evening which show a considerable degree of resemblance, this may
be due to supernormal contagion it is true, but it may also be due to
a variety of normal causes. It may be that these two persons had,
in the morning, been both impressed by some striking advertisement
in the same newspaper or on a hoarding. They would perhaps be
entirely unable to recognise the common source of their inspiration
when they came to make their drawings.
Speaking of his experiments carried out at the Institut Meta-
psychique, in which the agents and percipients were in different
rooms, M. Warcollier states :
1
"At the beginning of our experi-
ments we obtained only 6 per cent, of successes, then we passed to
25 per cent, and to 35 per cent., not absolute successes but relative
ones supplying evidence sufficient to maintain scientific curiosity in
us." We have, of course, no exact definition of the term " success
"
here, and we can only form a rough judgment from the specimens
cited by the author in his various reports.
For instance, it is not clear whether M. Warcollier claims as a
success a coincidence not predetermined by the experimenter. He
certainly quotes many cases in which the percipient's impression
does not correspond with the object selected by the agent but with
some incident which happened in the agent's environment previous

to the experiment. Are these coincidences counted in the 35 per-
cent, of successes ?
It would appear, in the large majority of cases, that the material
for transmission is chosen by personal preference and not on a
chance basis. That is, the objects are not chosen at random from
a large collection of varied types but by individual caprice or as
being suitable for testing a certain psychological theory. Now,
may not the increase from 6 per cent, to 35 per cent, in the number
of successes be due to the fact that the members of the little group
are becoming familiar with one another's mental preferences ? If
A knows that B has a passion for drawing cats, he has more chance
of making successful hits than C who is a stranger to B. Of course,
if coincidences are admitted with events not predetermined by the
experimenter, the scope of chance is indefinitely enlarged. It is as
if a man, aiming at a target, missed, and then claimed that at least
he had hit a neighbouring tree.
M. Warcollier tells us that his percipients are seldom very success-
ful in guessing numbers, letters of the alphabet and playing cards.
Now this is very disconcerting when we remember that many of
the earlier experiments of the S.P.R. showed a good deal of apparent
success with just such material. It may be, of course, as M. War-
collier suggests, that when the percipient is asked to guess a number,
the conscious action of his mind and his predilections for particular
numbers, inhibit the telepathic impression from emerging ; but
another explanation appears to be equally probable. Letters and
numbers are perfectly clear cut and, as a rule, the alternative to
success is absolute failure. But with concrete objects, pictures,
etc., it is not so. Even when the percipient has not guessed the
object chosen by the agent, it is often possible for the experimenter
to claim a partial success on the grounds that there is some associa-
tive connection between the percipient's impression and the actual
object. In cases where the association is obvious to everyone as,
for instance (Agent : Australia—Percipient : Kangaroo) no one
could object to the scoring of a success, but the association may be
of a much vaguer sort, as for example (Agent : Cobra—Percipient
a Tropical Scene). If we admit such coincidences as the last, the
scope of chance is, of course, much widened. And when we consider
cases in which the associative link is obvious only to the percipient
himself, we are on very precarious ground, as it is so easy to discover
associations in one's own mind even between, apparently, incon-
gruous ideas. If, as M. Warcollier seems to believe, telepathy often
works by very obscure associations apparent only to the per-
cipient himself, then it is difficult to see how science is going to deal
with it objectively at all.
It is hoped that M. Warcollier will in the near future, while still
123] Experiments in Supernormal Perception 171
retaining the material which appears to yield him the most success,
organise such a series of control experiments as will confirm or
confute his fundamental hypothesis of telepathy.
The origin of the present experiments. The first use of wireless as
an aid to the organisation of mass experiments in telepathy was
made by Professor Gardner Murphy of Columbia University.
Professor Murphy carried out on 3 March 1924 an experiment in
which a group of forty agents operated from Chicago. The experi-
ment appears to have been highly inconclusive, owing perhaps to
the lack of control tests and statistical standards of comparison.
On 16 February 19*27 the British Broadcasting Corporation kindly
allowed the use of their organisation for the carrying out of an
experiment in long-distance telepathy by the Society under the
direction of Dr Woolley, Sir Oliver Lodge acting as announcer. In
this experiment a small group of agents, one of whom was the
writer, attempted to broadcast telepathic impressions of objects
shown to them by Dr Woolley for a period of three minutes each.
Replies from 24,659 listeners were received and examined by the
Society. The impossibility of securing a second evening for the
purpose of a control experiment caused the subsequent evaluation
of the results to be somewhat inconclusive.
When, therefore, Dr Woolley suggested in July 1927 that I should
carry out a series of further experiments with a batch of the appa-
rently successful of the B.B.C. percipients, I readily agreed. In
the second week of September 1927 a notice was drafted and sent
out to some 150 persons who had scored partial successes 1
in the
February experiment, asking them if they would be willing to
devote half-an-hour each Wednesday evening in their own homes
for at least three months to recording their impressions of objects
which would be shown to a group of agents meeting each week at
the Rooms of the Society. Each person who expressed willingness to
co-operate, was on 30 September sent a copy of the general instruc-
tions which follow.
General Instructions
1 . The experiments will take place each week on Wednesday evening
between 8.30 and 9 p.m., beginning on Wednesday, October 5th, 1927,
this time suiting the maj ority of those who have consented to take part.
2. The attempts at transmission will in general be made from the
Society's headquarters at 31 Tavistock Square, London, W.C. 1,
but on certain evenings the agents may attempt to transmit from
their own homes.
3. Three experiments will, as a rule, be attempted during the
half-hour, ten minutes being devoted to each experiment.
1
For examples of these see Dr Woolley's paper in Proceedings (1928),
xxxviii. 1-9.
172 8. G. Soal [part
4. On the day of the experiment, please see that your watch or
timepiece is adjusted to Greenwich Mean Time. Whenever possible,
this adjustment should be made by means of the wireless time-signal
of the same day as the experiment.
5. You will probably find it advantageous to work in a darkened
room, reclining comfortably on a couch or easy chair. In the past
the best results would appear to have been obtained by using this
method. Try to shut out all sense impressions from outside. This
is best done by working in a quiet dark room. Having made
yourself comfortable, endeavour to compose your mind to a state
which resembles that immediately preceding sleep. Do not let
your mind dwell on the events of the day, but try to keep it as passive
as possible while holding fast to the simple idea that you are going
to visualise something, or if you work by mental hearing, you will
keep your mind awake only to the idea that you are going to hear
something.
6. When you receive impressions that you feel to be telepathic,
in order not to disturb and break up your passive state, you will find
it best to call out your impressions aloud to a friend who, sitting at
a table with a torch and a watch, will note down each impression
together with the exact time at which it occurs.
7. All impressions whether of sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch,
emotion, or mental pictures, should be noted together with the
corresponding times.
8. At the end of the experiments copy your notes on to a postcard
if there is room for them. Otherwise use a letter. Underline those
impressions which seem to you to be most telepathic. The postcard or
letter should contain your full name and address, and should be
witnessed by the friend who assisted you by making the notes.
9. In general you will not be told what is the nature of the object
or idea the agents are trying to transmit, i.e. whether it is a playing
card, picture, etc. The reason for this is that it is not advisable
for your imagination to be switched off on to any definite track.
In certain experiments, however, detailed instructions may have to
be given, and you will be duly notified of these before the experiment.
10. If on the morning following the experiment you remember
any striking or curious dream which you think may have a telepathic
origin (a deferred or latent impression), the Society will be very
grateful if you can kindly send them an account of it.
11. Please post your cards or letters (witnessed and bearing full
name and address) to :
The Society for Psychical Research,
31 Tavistock Square,
London, W.C. 1.
Please mark the envelope or postcard
—" Telepathy."
123] Experiments in Supernormal Perception 173
All letters and postcards should be posted if possible on the same
evening as the experiment, or at latest should leave by the first post
on the following morning.
We hope that you will not be discouraged by not hearing immedi-
ately the results of each experiment. By withholding the results
until the end of a series it is hoped not to interfere with the experi-
ment as a whole. Although it will not be advisable to post to you
details of successes week by week, you will be furnished with a com-
plete account of your impressions at the end of the series.
Statistics of percipients, October 1927-July 1928. Leaving aside
8 members of M. Rene Warcollier's group for experimental tele-
pathy who joined the present experiment in February 1928, there
were 127 persons who acted as percipients during the first year s
work. Of these 127, 118 resided in England and Wales and the
remaining nine were distributed as follows : five in Scotland and
the Shetland Isles, three in Ireland, and one in Budapest (no. 45a).
Only two of the 127 percipients (nos. 75 and 37) were personally
acquainted with me in October 1927, but two others (nos. 13 and
36a) made my acquaintance during the year.
The first year's work extended over 36 weekly sessions, and
the percipients may be classified as follows : four percipients took
part in 30 or more weeks' work, 16 in 20 or more, 39 in 12 or more,
90 in four or more, and 37 in less than four weeks' work.
The personnel of the agents, 1927-1928. The first 22 sittings
(5 October 1927-14 March 1928) were held at the Society's Rooms
at 31 Tavistock Square. In addition to myself, the agents during
the first 12 weeks (5 October-21 December 1927) were Mr and Mrs
Fernald, Miss Hood, and Mr Odell, the last of whom joined the
group on 2 November. All these ladies and gentlemen, with the
exception of Mr Odell, had acted as agents on the occasion of
the B.B.C. experiment of February 1927, and the best thanks of
the Society are due to them for the large amount of time they gave
up to the present experiment.
After December 1927 Mr and Mrs Fernald and Miss Hood were
unfortunately unable to continue their valuable assistance owing
to pressure of other work. Between 11 January and 1 February
Miss Newton, Miss Carruthers, Col. Hayward, Mr Robertson, and
a friend, very kindly stepped in to fill the gap, and the Society
wishes to thank these for their kind interest in the experiment.
Between 8 February and 4 July 1928 the work of transmission was
carried out in the main by a new group consisting of Prof, and
Mrs J. Mackenzie, Mr and Mrs Hughes, Mr Odell, and myself.
On 21 March the place of transmission was, mainly for the con-
venience of Prof, and Mrs Mackenzie, transferred from 31 Tavistock
Square to their house at 2 Adelaide Road, Chalk Farm, N.W. To
174 S. G. Soal [part
Prof, and Mrs Mackenzie the warmest thanks of the Society are
due for their kindness in providing a home for the experiment for
upwards of two years. Not only have Prof, and Mrs Mackenzie
taken part regularly in the weekly transmissions ;
they have also
on several occasions taken charge of the experiment on evenings
when I was unavoidably absent. To Mr Odell, a Member of the
Society, we owe a special debt of gratitude. This gentleman not
only attended a large number of the 1927-1928 sittings but also
assisted at the majority of the 1928-1929 meetings, from which he
had to travel to his residence at Kingston-on-Thames at the late
hour of 11 p.m.
In addition to the above-mentioned names, we would thank Mr
Theodore Besterman for taking an active part in the sitting on
19 October 1927 ; Miss Wallace for attending a sitting on 18
January 1928 ; Miss Boucher James for attending sittings on
22 February 1928 and 7 March 1928 ; Miss B. J. King for attending
a sitting on 4 July 1928 ; Mrs Lewis and Mrs Hall-Haines and her
sister, who were present on 30 January 1929.
Psychic qualifications of the principal agents. In the opinion of
many investigators it is not everyone who can act successfully as
the agent in telepathic experiments. From the records of sittings
with good mental percipients like Mrs Leonard it would certainly
appear that the minds of some individuals are more easily " pene-
trated " by the medium than those of others. Certain persons
seem to be given a very considerable amount of supernormal
information at sittings while others come away from every sitting
totally unconvinced that the medium has made any real contact
with their present or past environments. In the opinion of Dr
T. W. Mitchell it is those persons who possess a slight degree of
mental dissociation that will be most accessible to penetration
by a good percipient. Such persons are often those whose minds
possess strong undercurrents of activity which are never consciously
brought to bear upon the pressing needs of everyday life. People
of this type often possess stores of useful mental goods which they
are unable to bring at a moment's notice into the mental shop-
window of consciousness. We all of course possess a vast number
of mental impressions which at any given moment lie far beneath
the threshold of consciousness. But in certain individuals this
hidden material would appear to be more organised and active
than in others. Not infrequently these mental streams cut off
from the main river of conscious life find an outlet by means of
automatic writing. Poems, literary compositions, answers to ques-
tions upon topics of interest, passages from books read in childhood,
are written without hesitation by the subject whose conscious
mind is only vaguely aware of the movements his hand is making.
123] Experiments in Supernormal Perception 175
It is most probably these mental undercurrents that are perceived
by the trance consciousness of a psychic medium. If this theory
is correct the people who are capable of producing automatisms
ought to make the best agents in telepathic experiments.
It must be remembered, however, that mediums seldom seem
to divine the thoughts that are in one's mind at the moment. They
give us rather details of incidents which have impressed us in the
past—most often in the recent past—but which are not occupying
our thoughts at the precise hour when we visit the medium. I
personally have found that it was difficult for a medium to give me
a name when I was holding that name in my mind. A little later
in the sitting when I was thinking of something else the name was
given correctly. We ought therefore in telepathic experiments
always to make allowance for the possibility that ideas may be
capable of being transferred to a percipient only when they have
ceased to occupy the conscious mind of the agent. In the present
experiments, in cases where two or more objects were concentrated
on during the same evening opportunity was given for the per-
cipients to record impressions relating to object no. 1 in the interval
when object no. 2 was being thought of by the agents.
We must now enquire whether or not there was any a priori
reason to believe that the persons who acted as agents in the present
series of experiments possessed any special qualifications for this
role. The agents who took part regularly in the main experiment
(1928-1929) were Prof. J. S. Mackenzie, Mrs Mackenzie, Mr Odell
and myself. Prof. Mackenzie has informed me in writing that in
the year 1925 he carried out ten or more experiments with a friend,
Miss Fox, Prof. Mackenzie acting as agent. In all these experi-
ments Miss Fox was the percipient and remained at Clifton (near
Bristol). For approximately the first two-thirds of this series of
ten experiments Prof. Mackenzie was at Brockweir near Tintern,
and for the remaining experiments he was at Cambridge. As to
the results of these experiments I will quote Prof. Mackenzie's
own words from his letter to me (13 September 1931) :
" Un-
doubtedly the successes were much too detailed to be due to chance."
Prof. Mackenzie, I should mention, is Emeritus Professor of Logic
and Moral Philosophy in the University of South Wales. He was
a Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, and is a distinguished
writer on ethics and philosophy. In a book published within the
last few months on Cosmic Problems he makes some reference to
his psychic experiences. Prof. Mackenzie has only once consulted
a (well-known) medium. Two intimate friends who have both
been dead several years purported to communicate. " Their
communications," says Prof. Mackenzie, " were very characteristic
but comparatively trivial."
176 S. G. Soal [part
Mrs Mackenzie " considers that she has had some success with
mediums, but thinks it best not to give names or particulars. She
may be writing on the subject herself." As regards experiments
in telepathy Mrs Mackenzie " has nothing to report." Mrs Mac-
kenzie, I should add, is a distinguished educationalist and very
well known. Though I am not at liberty to give any details of
Mrs Mackenzie's experiences with mediums I may venture to say
that a year or two ago she mentioned some incidents which im-
pressed me very favourably.
I need hardly say that Prof. Mackenzie's judgment upon his
experiments with Miss Fox, coming as it does from so cautious and
critical a thinker, must be accorded great weight.
Miss Fox (Percipient no. 31a = 622) took part in both the 1927-
1928 experiments and in the 1928-1929 series. It will be seen by
reference to Table I that no. 31a=622 did thirteen weeks' work in
the session 1927-1928, scoring two successes—one on 8 February
1928 and the other on 16 May 1928. One of these successes is of
the " previsional " type (16 May), and on this occasion Prof.
Mackenzie was present as agent. On the other occasion (8 Feb-
ruary) only Mrs Mackenzie was present. In the 1928-1929 series
the percipient did only three weeks' work and did not score any
success (score = 0/1 80). She was at Bristol during these experi-
ments and possibly her psychic powers were temporarily in abeyance.
I have known Mr Odell for several years. A man of scientific
attainments and cautious critical habits of mind, he is keenly
interested in psychical research. He informs me that he has never
sat with a medium but that he has acted as agent sometimes in
telepathic experiments. He has had one or two successes as agent
but he does not consider these to be beyond what chance could
have produced. He considers that he has no special psychic powers.
Of this I am not able to judge, but I can say that his genial and
sympathetic personality made him a most valuable asset at our
weekly meetings. If Mr Odell was absent things never seemed
quite the same.
Lastly there remains myself to account for. I am, I believe, the
only one of the little group that has ever been afflicted with the
mental distemper of automatism. I first discovered in the summer
of 1923 that if I closed my eyes and concentrated hard upon some
trivial fonmila of mathematics and then abandoned conscious
control of my hand to a nervous impulse, I could produce coherent
writing. This writing sometimes differed in character from my
normal handwriting. It could only be produced, I found, while
my mind was intensely distracted by hard conscious effort, and
when I brought my mind back to what my hand was doing the
writing would cease abruptly. There was never any real com-
123] Experiments in Supernormal Perception 177
pulsion to write, for I was able to stop whenever I wished. More-
over, I often found a very great difficulty in getting started. Almost
invariably the writing took the form of literary composition, and
essays, verses, etc., were produced. Many of these purported to
emanate from deceased authors. I need only mention the Oscar
Wilde " scripts. I consider it in the highest degree probable that
manv of the facts contained in these writings could never have been
normallv known to me even after allowing for the omnivorous
quality of my reading. Since December 1928 I have abandoned
this strange form of amusement, especially as I became increasingly
conscious that it was followed by lassitude and nervous irritation.
I mention it here for the sole purpose of recording that to some
slight extent at any rate I might be supposed to possess some of
the characteristics of an " agent."
But in point of fact I may claim to have had a considerable
amount of success with certain mediums, especially with Mrs
Blanche Cooper and Mrs Leonard. Many readers will be familiar
with the case of
" John Ferguson " contained m my report on
Mrs Cooper 1
The most rational interpretation of this case is to be
found in the hypothesis that the medium had during the sittings
intermittent access to the subconscious levels of my mind. It is
true that throughout my sittings with Mrs Cooper my right hand
held one of the medium's hands ;
that is to say, there was contact
Nevertheless it would be a far-fetched explanation to suppose that
complicated messages such as are recorded in my report could have
been communicated to the medium involuntarily by the mere
pressure of fingers and without any pre-arranged code.
Unconscious whispering on my part seems also a far-fetched
assumption, and I doubt if the case of " Gordon Davis could be
satisfactorily accounted for without the hypothesis of clairvoyance.
In the case of
" John Ferguson " at least some form of telepathy
from the subconscious levels of my own mind to those of Mrs Cooper
seems the most rational supposition. Whether discarnate human
beings played any part in the mechanism of this transfer 1 do not
know. Nor do I feel competent to express an opinion on questions
so vast and difficult. I will merely say that on occasions it certainly
seemed as if I were an " agent " and Mrs Cooper had partial access
to my memories. But it was hardly ever those thoughts that were
in clear conscious focus at the moment which were picked up by
the medium. T ,
A
In sittings with Mrs Leonard, where there was no contact 1 noted
one or two cases in which telepathy from my mind to that of Mrs
Leonard seemed on the whole the most probable explanation. One
i
See my "
A Report on some communications received through Mrs Blanche
Cooper," Proceedings (1925), xxxv. 471-594.
178 S. G. Soal
such instance I have given in my Report on Mrs Cooper (p. 483).
A name of a village which I had been discussing with Mr Davis in
the train on the way to the sitting was given with approximate
accuracy by Feda half-an-hour later. There was another incident
of a similar nature given at my second Leonard sitting which would
take too long to detail here.
Turning now to the principal agents in the preliminary (1927-1928)
series, these were Mr C. B. Fernald, the dramatist, Mrs Fernald,
Miss P. Hood, and myself. In a letter dated 18 September 1931,
Mrs Fernald states that in her sittings with Mrs Leonard and Mrs
Warren Elliott she was definitely given information that was super-
normal and beyond chance. A case of apparent precognition
obtained by Mrs Fernald at a Leonard sitting was published in
Proceedings (xxxvi. 327-32). Mrs Fernald also states that both
Mr Fernald and Miss Hood have had supernormal information given
them at sittings with mediums. Mr and Mrs Fernald have practised
a form of automatism in their own home, using a kind of ouija
board with pointer and alphabet. At many of these sittings Miss
Hood was present. Mrs Fernald found that with her hand resting
on the slider she was able to cause the pointer to move by herself
without assistance from the others. Mrs Fernald and Miss Hood
with their hands on the slider were able to obtain messages. In the
earlier attempts with the board it was thought that Mr Fernald
was the prime agent in causing the pointer to move, but this view
was modified when Mrs Fernald and Miss Hood obtained messages
without his assistance. Mrs Fernald does not think that Miss
Hood ever tried to work the pointer alone. I gather that the
communications received through the board purported to be
messages from deceased persons who were known to the sitters
in life.
The additional agents. Besides the regular group a certain
number of the 579 percipients were asked to play the part of
transmitters each week in the 1928-1929 series of experiments.
Between 5 December 1928 and 6 March 1929, between 20 and
30 such additional agents were employed each week for one ten-
minute interval. On 20 March and 27 March the numbers of
these additional agents were 43 and 68 respectively. As a rule
the same 20-30 agents acted for three or four consecutive weeks,
after which period a fresh batch of persons were asked to co-operate.
Exceptions arose, however, through people unexpectedly dropping
out or being unable to take part on account of other engage-
ments. During the whole period 105 persons acted as additional
agents. Of these 37 claimed to have had psychic experiences
through their own faculties of perception. One or two claimed
to have had successes in previous telepathic experiments in which
123] Experiments in Supernormal Perception 179
they had acted as agents, but in the vast majority of cases the
experiences described were experiences of psychic perception.
The object on which these additional agents were asked to con-
centrate in their own homes was of course the same as that shown to
the principal group at Adelaide Road. In all cases it consisted of
a postcard inscribed with a picture, number, letter or playing card,
which was enclosed in a sealed envelope. Whenever possible this
envelope was despatched to reach the agent on the day of the
experiment in which it was to be used.
Accompanying the sealed envelope were instructions to the
effect that the envelope was to be kept in a safe place unopened
till 10 p.m., when it was to be opened in the presence of a witness.
(For a copy of these instructions see below, p. 289.) The envelope
bearing the signature of the witness was to be returned to the
Society.
The choice of the batch of additional agents each week was made
by Miss Carruthers, subject to certain instructions from me. Our
579 percipients appeared to belong to very varied cultural types,
and we had of course absolutely no reason to suppose that any
individuals or class of individuals would prove untrustworthy.
We knew practically nothing about the occupations, etc., of the
majority of the percipients except what had been given us in their
letters. But broadly speaking, with the very limited information
at our disposal we were able to recognise two classes : (a) private
individuals, and (b) persons known to be in positions of public
trust. Class (b) consisted of medical men, clergymen, army officers,
naval officers, J.P.'s, university professors and graduates, barristers,
etc. Without intending the slightest reflection on any members
of class (a) it will be admitted by all that there are no more trust-
worthy people in the world than our English public men of whom
class (b) is a sample. I asked Miss Carruthers to make her first
selection of agents as far as possible from class (b). But so far as
our records went class (6) was a small one and comprised only
some 30-40 persons at most. Moreover, all the people asked were
unable to take part on certain evenings. It was therefore found
necessary to ask a good many private individuals to assist us by
acting as agents.
To any one individual percipient the vast majority of the re-
mainder must have been utter strangers, the names and addresses
of whom he or she could not know. But it not infrequently
happened that even in the provinces two or more percipients lived
within a few miles of one another. To avoid therefore any suspicion
of accidental leakage Miss Carruthers was careful to choose the
agents from districts in which they were well isolated from other-
people taking part in the experiment.
180 S. G. Soal [part
But actually there are not the slightest grounds for believing that
any leakage resulted from the use of these additional agents. The
object tables, etc., show no statistical superiority in the experiments
where additional agents were used. Further, there are no cases of
individuals producing brilliant successes in such experiments.
General Scope of the Experiments, 1927-1928
The main object of the 1927-1928 experiments was to make a
preliminary survey of the ground before attempting a statistical
investigation of the subject on a larger scale. The objects of
experiment were seldom adapted to statistical computation but
consisted largely of picturesque toys, working models, animals,
flowers. Playing cards, numbers, geometrical drawings, were
hardly ever used, since the small numbers of percipients (19-62)
who took part each evening precluded any serious statistical
analysis. It was hoped, moreover, that a greater degree of success
might attend the employment of material that was amusing and
exciting to the agents. Common everyday objects which could
be named by a single word, such as cup, plate, fork, were as a rule
avoided, and the objects chosen were for the most part familiar
objects in unfamiliar associations that were not likely to be guessed
by chance. An example is (XXVII, 2 May [C]) when a toy bear
pushed a ball between its forepaws. There was, in fact, nearly
always plenty of scope for complex attempts at delineation on the
part of the percipients.
Three such objects, referred to as (A), (B) and (C), were as a rule
gazed at by the agents for ten minutes each, between 8.30 and 9 p.m.
The percipients were generally given no indication whatever of
the nature of the three objects to be guessed, but they each received
by post (on the day of the experiment if possible) a copy of the
following notice.
Wednesday [Date] 1928
Three different objects will be shown, one each from
8.30—8.40 p.m.
8.40—8.50 p.m.
8.50—9.0 p.m.
Please record all impressions.
(Sgd.) [V. J. Woollby or S. G. Soal].
On two occasions, 2 November 1927 and 26 October 1927, the
whole half-hour was devoted by the agents to reading aloud an ex-
citing or gruesome story. On these two occasions, the usual notice
to percipients was varied to read :
" Please record all impressions
between 8.30 and 9 p.m."
123] Experiments in Supernormal Perception 181
There were also attempts to transmit the ideas of exciting modern
poems on 30 November 1927 (C) ; 7 December 1927 (B) ;
25
January 1928 (C) ; 14 December 1927 (C).
Two attempts, 14 December 1927 (B) ; 7 December 1927 (A),
were made to transmit the tingling sensation of a high-frequency-
current. These seem to have failed entirely.
Two attempts to transmit a strong odour, on 21 December 1927
(C) and 20 June 1928 (B), also failed.'
In all these variations of the usual routine, the wording of the
warning notice to percipients differed in no way from the usual
wording when three ordinary objects were the subject of experiment.
The objects used in the 1927-1928 experiments were purchased by
myself at the most irregular times and in the most diverse parts of
London and Southend. On some occasions the objects were bought
on the afternoon of the day of experiment, in which case they
remained in a locked attache case which never left my sight till the
hour of the experiment. But on several other occasions the objects
were purchased by me three or four clays previous to the day of the
experiment, and after purchase they were carried home in my
attache case and there kept under lock and key till the following
Wednesday, on which day they were carefully wrapped in paper,
tied up with string and taken to town in my case. During the
whole of the morning these parcels remained in the locked case,
which was left on the staff-room table of East London College. For
large objects a suit-case was used. Once having left East London
College, the attache or suit-case was never out of my observation,
and the parcels remained unopened till the time of experiment.
In selecting the objects for experiment, I sought after variety,
distinctness of detail, humorous or striking combinations that mere
guess-work would seldom hit upon. In this, I certainly succeeded,
as the list of objects will show. We have now to examine how far
the percipients succeeded in divining the ideas I had chosen.
Summary of Results of Experiments, 1927-1928
Except in the case of perhaps half-a-dozen percipients in all,
there was no link of acquaintance between the regular groups of
agents and the 127 guessers living in all parts of the United King-
dom. The percipients were not even provided with a photograph
of the agents and could be expected to know nothing at the com-
mencement of the experiment except that a group of persons, of
whom I was one, would try to transmit ideas from a definite place
at a definite time.
At the end of the first twelve weeks' work, a typewritten copy of
a report of the first term's work was sent to each percipient. In this
report appeared the initials of the agents for each week, together
N
182 8. G. Soal [part
with a full description of the objects of experiment and the results
obtained. A second and similar report on the next twelve weeks'
work was sent to each percipient shortly after Easter 1928. No
further reports were issued till this paper was read before the Society
in October 1930.
The recording of the results. The letters from percipients which
arrived at 31 Tavistock Square, were opened personally by me every
Friday afternoon, and the impressions recorded by each percipient
were copied on to a large card bearing his or her name, address
and identification number. On these cards special columns were
allotted to the recording of the date and, wherever possible, exact
time of each impression. As a rule, whenever a percipient scored
any measure of success, I addressed to him a personal letter asking
for further details, without of course, giving him any clue to the
actual subject chosen by the agents. I also made a point of enquir-
ing whether or not anything had happened during the past day or
two in the percipient's environment to suggest such and such an idea
to him, or whether he was able to account in any normal way for
getting the impression.
Statistics of Successful Hits, 1927-1928. It has been possible to
list all the successful hits in Table I. A few words of explanation
regarding this table are necessary. In the first column we have the
percipient's identity number, and where this particular percipient
took part in the second series (1928-1929) his new number (always
between 600 and 700) is added thus : 3 = 604, for convenience of
reference. In the second column is a fraction the numerator of
which gives the number of successful hits and the denominator the
number of weeks' work carried out by the percipient. Thus the
fraction T
:
v means that the percipient recorded impressions for
18 weeks and scored three successful hits. In the third column is
given the date of the successful hit, and the object A, B or C to which
it would appear to be relevant.
The last column shows the percipient's impression, and where
possible, the interval A, B, C, in which the impression was recorded.
Thus, if the two letters in the third and fourth columns are the
same, A A or B B or C C, this implies that the percipient noted his
impression during the same ten minutes as the object to which it
relates was exhibited to the agents. C in the third column and B in
the fourth column would imply that the successful hit was appa-
rently of the nature of a " previsional " impression, while the order
A-B indicates a deferred impression.
The letter N after an impression means that the percipient was
able to account in a normal way for the emergence of the impression
in his mind, while the letters N N indicate that he failed to rind any
obvious normal explanation.
123] Experiments in Supernormal Perception 183
Table I is of course to be read in conjunction with the list of
objects (1927-1928) to which the corresponding references are
attached. Percipients who did not score a single successful hit are
omitted entirely from Table I.
Excluding for the moment the few percipients of M. Rene War-
collier's group who joined the experiment in February 1928, we
have 127 percipients in all. Of these : (a) 75 failed to obtain a
single successful hit ; (6) 26 obtained one successful hit only ;
(c) 20 obtained two successful hits ;
(d) four obtained three success-
ful hits ;
(e) two obtained four successful hits.
Of group (a) 10 had taken part in 12 or more weeks' work ; 43 had
taken part in four or more weeks' work, and 32 had taken part in
less than four weeks' work. Of group (b) three had taken part in
20 or more weeks' work and eight had taken part in 12 or more
weeks' work. Only one had taken part in less than four weeks'
work. Of group (c) five had taken part in 20 or more weeks' work
and eight in 12 or more weeks' work. The four percipients in
group (d) had all done 18 or more weeks' work. The two percipients
in group (e) had done 24 and 30 weeks' work respectively.
The quality of the impressions. About the vast majority of these
impressions there is seldom anything so detailed as forcibly to
convince the reader that the percipient has really " seen " the
object on which the agents were concentrating. A simple object
is sometimes named correctly, but the really important details are
almost invariably lacking. Perhaps the most interesting case is
that of no. 72. He wins only two successes, but he scores these
two hits in only four weeks' work, and both are rather remarkable
coincidences. The detailed description of the saucer and pipe
(23 November 1927 [C]) used for blowing bubbles and the mention
of the " Claw-like hands " on 2 November 1927, if mere guesses,
are very extraordinary ones. It is unfortunate that this percipient
(from Barnsley) was unable to continue with the experiments.
The impressions of no. 3 = 604 are also rather striking. This
percipient, who obtained three interesting hits in 18 weeks' work,
did not, however, justify his promise in the second year's work, in
which his percentage score was 7T per cent., this being quite an
average one.
Coincidence in time. Among the successful hits given in Table I
there are 65 cases in which the coincidence or non-coincidence in
time between the exposure of the object to the agents and the
percipient's guess, is more or less definitely ascertainable—that is,
cases in which we are able to say with fair certainty whether or not
the percipient recorded his impression in the ten minutes A, B or C
during which the object was being concentrated on. Of these
65 cases, there are 33 cases of coincidence {i.e. AA, BB or CO). By
184 8. G. Soal [part
chance we might expect about ^ x 65 = 22 such coincidences. This
result is slightly favourable to the existence of an extra chance
influence, but it is scarcely to be stressed.1
M. Rcve Warcollier's group. At my invitation, M. Rene War-
collier in February 1928 very kindly arranged for his group for the
study of experimental telepathy to take part in the Wednesday
experiments, commencing on 15 February 1928. The same weekly
notice was sent to M. Warcollier as to the British percipients ;
eight
members of his group acted as percipients in the Wednesday
experiments, sometimes meeting at the Institut Metapsychique in
Paris to record their impressions. Unfortunately, with the excep-
tion of one member, Mme de Z., Wednesday proved to be an
inconvenient evening for the members of the group, and a special
experiment had to be arranged for Saturday afternoons, in place of
the Wednesday experiment. I do not propose in this paper to give
any account of these Saturday experiments. Possibly a separate
report may be written on these experiments. In the present report
I shall confine myself to the few experiments which the members
were able to undertake on Wednesday evenings. I shall refer to
M. Warcollier's percipients only by their initials.
These follow, with the number of weeks' work done by them in
the session of 1927-1928 shown in brackets : Mile L. (3), Mme C. (2),
Mile T. (1), M. R. W. (4), M. B. (1), M. J. B. (6), M. de S. (4),
Mme de Z. (12). The only remarkable series of successful hits in
the Wednesday experiments was obtained by Mme de Z., an auto-
matic writer, who in 12 weekly experiments scored five hits, which
were fairly interesting (see Table I).
During the second session (1928-1929) the Warcollier percipients
continued with the Saturday afternoon experiments, but were
generally unable to take part in the Wednesday evening work. It
is, therefore, impossible to make any serious comparison between
the results obtained by this group, and those of the English
percipients.
Coincidences between percipients' impressions. It frequently
happened that two percipients living widely apart recorded similar
impressions at approximately the same time, though these impres-
sions appeared to be in no way related to the object chosen by the
agents. I give a few of the more interesting examples from the
1927-1928 experiments.
(a) 1 February 1928.
No. 88 (8.40-8.50) :
" A Japanese woman reclining and holding up
an umbrella."
1
See, however, p. 238 below, where the same problem is discussed on a
larger scale.
123] Experiments in Supernormal Perception 185
No. 89 (8.50) :
" Japanese umbrella."
(This is the kind of case which can possibly be disregarded, since
no. 88 and no. 89 were in the same room.)
{b) 8 February 1928.
No. 45a (Budapest) :
" Bunch of beautiful Bed flowers."
No. 48 (England) :
" Bunch of Bed flowers."
(Here the percipients are remotely separated, but the common
impression is, after all, a very ordinary one.)
In the following instances, the correspondences, though not
particularly complex, are much more out of the way.
(c) 25 January 1928.
No. 34 (8.40 p.m., Sevenoaks, Kent) :
" Messenger with wand,
perhaps Hermes."
No. '92 (8.54 p.m., Basingstoke, Hants.) :
" Shoulder of sculpture
bust, male head. Idea of Hermes of Praxiteles."
No. 34 in a letter (13 February) said that shortly before 25
January he was revising the proofs of an article for a new dictionary,
in which proof there was a short notice of the word Caduceus, and
it was the wand or Caduceus that suggested Hermes. No. 92 in a
letter (18 February) said that it was the visual idea of an antique
piece of sculpture that caused him to get the literary idea of Hermes
as being most in keeping. He is familiar with many of the antique
torsos, having drawn them a lot thirty years ago.
{d) 15 February 1928.
No. 76 (8.53-9.0 p.m., Northwich, Cheshire) :
" A gipsy woman."
No. 65 (8.30 p.m., Birmingham) :
" Impression of Gipsy."
(e) 9 May 1928.
No. 52 (8.30-8.40 p.m., London, S.E.) :
" Impressions connected
with being at a great height ;
probably on a mountain or in a
plane."
No. 71 (8.55 p.m., Coventry) :
" Champagne, country field view as
from an aeroplane and sense of great height."
if) 25 April 1928.
No. 20 (8.30-8.40 p.m., London, W. 13) :
" Thinking of Moses in
the burning bush ; perhaps bush fire intended."
No. 14b (8.30-8.40 p.m., London, W. 8) : "A burning torch—which
afterwards changed into something writhing round a stick, perhaps
remembrance of some Biblical ficture" [See Exodus, iii, v.]
(g) 8 February 1928.
No. 32 (8.30-8.45, Southsea, Hants.) :
" Impression of English
Kings being mentioned, particularly Henry VIII."
ISC, S. G. Soal [part
No. 89 (8.50-9.0 p.m., Loudon, N. 8) :
" Picture of King; Henry
VIII."
(h) 28 March 1928.
No. 20 (8.52 p.m., London, W. 13) :
" Very large sunflower with
usual black centre."
No. 53 (8.50-9.0 p.m., London, N.W. 5) :
" Spidery thing like a
sunflower of the single variety."
(i) 11 January 1928.
No. 14a (No time, Leamington Spa) :
" A straight road on a moor."
No. 28 (No time, Nuneaton) :
" Sensation of rushing along a per-
fectly straight road."
(j) 7 December 1927.
No. 57 (8.50-9.0 p.m., Chelsea, London) :
" Smallish house' in
country with two trees and a high brick wall."
No. 93 (8.50-9.0 p.m., London, S.W. 1) :
" Walled garden of an old
red brick house."
(k) 9 November 1927.
No. 4 (Weston-super-Mare, 8.40 p.m.) :
" Felt restless. Could only
think of a woman. She seemed to be moving silently, dressed in
white, somewhat ghastly."
No. 39 (8.43 p.m., Catterick, Yorks.) :
" Woman dressed in white
flowing robe. Walking against a dark background."
A few other similar examples could be cited, but these will suffice.
It will be noticed that the coincidence in time is not always even
approximately exact. If we found the same pairs of percipients
recording week after week, impressions of the degree of similitude
represented by say, examples (e), (i), (j), (k), we might reasonably
conclude that such a pair of percipients were subject to some
common influence (e.g. reading the same weekly story magazine on
the day of the experiment) or that they were in some sort of mental
communication, either normal or supernormal. But while we find
that two or three pairs of such coincidences occurred almost every
week, they did not occur between the same pairs of percipients.
But even if the same pair of percipients were found to record similar
impressions at about the same time, we should find it almost im-
possible to prove that the cause of the coincidence was not some
common influence which operated at about the same time on both
percipients. In a civilised modern community thousands read the
same newspapers evening after evening, listen to the same pro-
gramme on the radio, take in the same magazine, etc. M. Rene
Warcollier claims to have established the phenomenon of " mental
123] Experiments in Supernormal Perception 187"
contagion " between percipients. In my opinion, he has not suffi-
ciently taken into account the influences of common environment,
common mental habits, and the universal power of suggestion of the
modern newspaper and the modern advertisement. In Part II of
my report, I shall return to this possibility of " mental contagion
"
among percipients, treating it from rather a different standpoint.
The Dictionary control. Noting the tendency of pairs of perci-
pients to record similar impressions, such as " sunflower," " cater-
pillar," etc., I was curious to try an experiment with the dictionary,
in which the percipients should be asked to pick out a concrete
word at random. To this effect, I issued to percipients in February
1928 the following notice :
Long-Distance Telepathy
Each week after you have recorded your usual impressions, will
you kindly carry out the following little experiment. Take an
English Dictionary and, closing your eyes, open it at random,
striking the page anywhere with a pencil. Note the name of an
object nearest to the word on which your pencil falls. Do this as
Many Times as the Number of Impressions you have recorded.
Add these names at the end of your list of impressions each week,
noting them thus :
Control : Squirrel, river, building, table.
Ignore abstract names such as " kindness," " intelligence," etc.,
choosing each time the nearest concrete object.
On no account perform this test until the telepathy experiment is
finished, i.e. until after 9 p.m. S. Gr. Soal.
It was a fortnight later (29 February) explained to percipients
that an impression such as " white elephant " would require two
control words instead of one, as it comprised two distinct ideas.
A list of the " control " words obtained from all the percipients
was made each week, and the pairs of percipients who selected the
same word or synonymous or closely associated words, were noted
and the number of such coincidences counted each week. Using
an Ogilvie and Annandale's English Dictionary it was found that if
the dictionary is divided into three equal parts, about 50 per cent, of
the words chosen each week were taken from the middle third
(beginning of E to PO) of the book, while the remaining 50 per cent,
were about equally divided between the other two-thirds of the
dictionary. As the number of concrete names in any ordinary
dictionary must considerably exceed the number of concrete words
used in ordinary life by the average person, one might expect that
chance coincidences between pairs of percipients during the actual
telepathy experiment would be far more frequent than the coinci-
dences obtained by means of the dictionary.
188 S. G. Soal [part
It was found as a matter of fact, that the coincidences due to the
dictionary were usually far in excess of those noted during the
actual experiment, but it must be remembered that the two experi-
ments are not precisely comparable. Two percipients giving the
word " white " in the dictionary control, would register a coinci-
dence, whereas, in the actual experiment two percipients who
obtained the respective impressions " white sea " and " white
paper " could hardly be considered to score a coincidence. The
Dictionary Control, therefore, is clearly of very limited application,
but the following examples will show that simple " single word
"
coincidences such as " gypsy," " sunflower," occur quite as fre-
quently in the case of the dictionary as in the actual experiment.
29 February 1928. Number of percipients, 34. Number of words
chosen from dictionary, 153.

Coincidences between percipients' impressions. No. 64 (8.40), A
Rainbow ; no. 14a (8.35), Rainbow Colours.
A remarkable success by the dictionary. On one occasion (22
February, Expt. XIX) a curious " double " success was scored by
the dictionary. We recall that on this particular evening, the
objects of experiment were (A) Artificial Dragon Fly, (B) Toy Snake,
and (C) Firework Lights in the darkness. There were 42 per-
cipients, including seven of M. Warcollier's group, and the total
number of control words was 170.
The results of the " Control " were : (A) No word applicable ;
(B) Adder (M. J. B.) ;
(B) Serpent (M. de S.) ;
(C) Lights (M. de S.).
The two words "Serpent" and "Lights" followed each other in
order. On this evening, the dictionary more than equalled the joint
efforts of the 42 percipients, there being only one snake mentioned
altogether (cp. Table I : 30=189, 65 = 601, 76 = 666).
Impressions relating to the environment of the agents, but not to the
actual objects of experiment. It very occasionally happened that a
percipient recorded an impression which, though not appbcable to
the subject of experiment, was yet related to something which
occurred in the seance-room during the experiments. As I have
explained in the Introduction to this paper, little importance can
123] Experiments in Supernormal Perception 189
be attached to such incidents, unless the coincidence shows an
almost photographic accuracy of detail.
The following is the best incident of this kind, but I am not
convinced by it. On 2 November 1927, percipient no. 20, noted
(no exact time), " Something being lighted that would give a bad
smell. A dazzling light. A bad smell again ;
perhaps an explosion.
A hissing or gas-escaping sound." Mrs Fernald, one of the agents,
wrote the following note two days after the experiment :
" Between
7 and 8 p.m. J. H. F. [i.e. Mrs Fernald] twice let the gas escape
while making coffee. The second time the tap was turned on for
several minutes before the gas was discovered to be unlighted, and
filling the room. We all exclaimed, '
there might have been an
explosion.'
"
During the same evening (2 November 1927) percipient no. 87
records, " A bunch of violets—a bowl of water." Mrs Fernald
again adds the following note :
" Miss Hood had put a bunch of
violets in water in the bowl of the wash-hand stand, where they
remained from 7-9 p.m. The wash-hand stand was just outside the
door of the room in which we were sitting for the experiment."
I can corroborate seeing the bunch of violets, which struck me as a
fine bunch.
Case of apparent anticipation of the experimenter's intentions. The
following curious coincidence is worthy of note.
On 5 October 1927, the first evening of the experiments, a toy
rabbit was shown to the agents during the third interval (8.50-
9.0 p.m.). On Tuesday, 4 October, I had bought some concentrated
sulphuric acid and potassium chlorate from the chemist in Prittle-
well, Essex. My intention was to make preparations for a little
chemical experiment to startle the agents during the last ten
minutes of the half-hour. On the morning of 5 October, I carried
to town in my attache case, a small bottle of sulphuric acid, a glass
rod and a packet containing a mixture of sugar and potassium
chlorate. I was intending to make a small white pyramid of this
mixture and to place it on a tray in the seance-room. While the
agents were watching, I would suddenly let fall a single drop of
the concentrated acid on to the mixture from the end of the glass
rod. There would have been a spluttering, crackling conflagration,
rising almost to the ceiling, and acrid fumes of chlorine peroxide
would fill the room as well as smoke. About midday on the day
of the experiment, 5 October, however, I decided that the smoke
might damage the ceiling, and that the project must be abandoned.
I therefore purchased the toy rabbit, which ultimately formed the
subject of experiment in the third interval.
No. 28 noted on 5 October (8.50-9.0 p.m.) :
" Something crackling
or spluttering as water dropped on to acid. Irritating fumes. Idea
L90 S. G. Soal [part
of Ammonia." In a letter dated 27 November no. 28 wrote :
" I
can safely say that I had been engaged in no experiments of a
chemical nature for at least four years—that is, since I left school.
As it happens I have absolutely nothing to do with chemistry either
in my daily occupation or in my hobby—wireless. . . . The
impression was the most sudden and unexpected of any I have as
yet received. I can distinctly remember it occurring. Nothing
was further from my thoughts at the commencement of the test."
No. 28 continued with the experiments for eleven weeks, but ob-
tained only one other success. He did not take part in the 1928-
1929 series.
List of Objects used in the Experiment, 1927-1928 1
I. 5 October 1927 ; 58 percipients took part ;
agents : Mr and
Mrs Fernald, Miss P. Hood and S. G. S.
A. 8-30-8.40 p.m. : The agents looked at a large quantity of the
scarlet berries and foliage of the wild guelder rose {Viburnum opulus).
See Table I, no. 19.
B. 8.40-8.50 p.m. : A bright horseshoe. See Table I, nos.
65 = 661, 76 = 666.
C. 8.50-9.0 p.m. : A large toy rabbit with long ears, brilliant
scarlet back and white woolly breast. See Table I, nos. 13, 23,
71 = 664.
II. 12 October 1927 ; 62 percipients ;
agents : same as in I.
A notice had been sent to the percipients to the effect that for all
three objects the agents would attempt to transmit the name of a
town or village.
A. 8.30-8.40 p.m. : Attempt to transmit the name Hornchurch,
a village in Essex. I produced a tasselled horn and blew blasts on
it, and then drew a church on a sheet of paper.2
See Table I,
no. 26 = 165.
B. 8.40-8.50 p.m. : Attempt to transmit the word Dartmouth.
I used a small feather dart like a little arrow and sketched a mouth.
See Table I, no. 54.
C. 8.50-9.0 p.m. : I showed in rapid succession the names
1
Except when stated otherwise experiments I-XXII were conducted from
31 Tavistock Square, XXIII-XXXVI from 2 Adelaide Road.
2
Although no percipient obtained an impression of a horn on 12 October
when the word Hornchurch was visualised, it is curious that on the following
week, 19 October (control) three percipients out of the total 57 obtained
impressions of a horn. These impressions are as follows : no. 65 (8.30), " A
horn and sounds and sights of hunting " ; no. 61 (8.54), " A small horn . . .
with fancy cord " ; no. 50 (8.50), " A voice kept saying . . . Home or
Haurne." None of the three were able to account normally for their im-
pressions.
123] Experiments in Supernormal Perception I'M
Ramsgate, Brackenbury, Bath, Saltash, Maidstone, Barmouth,
Barrow, Thornbury, Manningtree, Hatfield, each, name being
written on a strip of cardboard. Each name was exposed to view
for about fifteen seconds and the agents were asked to visualise the
objects suggested by the names but to make no attempt to hold the
names in their minds longer than the fifteen seconds. See Table I,
no. 52 = 650.
III. 19 October 1927 (control experiment) ; 57 percipients.
This was the only control experiment in the present series. The
usual notice had been sent out to the percipients. The agents,
however, did not meet, but I was present at an S.P.R. Conversazione
on this evening held at 31 Tavistock Square. At 9.30 p.m. I asked
Miss Ina Jephson in the presence of Miss Newton to think of three
objects and to label them A, B, C. The three objects chosen were :
(A) An open book, (B) A globe of the world, (C) A red lacquered
Box.
Fifty-seven percipients sent in records of their impressions. If
we apply the percipients' impressions to the three objects suggested
by Miss Jephson we have to note the following partial successes :
(A) No. 79 (8.50-9.0 p.m.) :
" An open book." Five other
percipients mentioned books of various kinds.
(B) No. 53 (8.40) saw " a small globe, greeny blue, on ring or
stand." No. 92 also mentioned a globe.
(C) No. 83 (No time) saw " a black and gold lacquered box."
Eight other percipients mentioned or described boxes of various
kinds, but unlacquered.
At 9.28 a.m. on the following morning Mr F. T. Cooper of East
London College in the presence of Mr W. F. S. Churchill and myself
at my request suggested three objects.
He thought of in order : (A) A waste-paper basket, drawing
special attention to the wickerwork, (B) A red triangle (as a red
motor sign), (C) A motor lamp.
Applying this control to the percipient's impressions obtained
on the previous evening we may note the following successes :
(A) No. 28 (8.30 p.m.) :
" A needlework basket. Could smell the
wickerwork."
(B) No. 45 (8.40-8.50) :
" Triangle."
(C) Nil.
I have recorded this experiment but it is of no real importance.
Probably a sounder procedure would be to choose the three
" control " objects at random from a dictionary. This was actually
done two days later at the S.P.R. rooms. Miss Newton and I took
an English dictionary and closing our eyes chose a word by opening
the dictionary at random and striking a page with a pencil. The
192 S. G. Soal [part
nearest concrete word to the spot struck by the pencil point was
chosen. This was repeated three times by Miss Newton and myself
taking turns with the pencil. The three words chosen were
(A) Glove, (B) Lizard, (C) Barometer. Applied to the percipients'
impressions for 19 October there would be no success with these
three objects. Applied to the results sent in on 9 November there
would have been one success, since no. 5 records (8.40-8.50) " Lizard
or similar reptile."
IV. 26 October 1927 ; 51 percipients ;
agents : Mrs F., Miss H.,
Mr B., S. G. S.
The following notice had previously been sent to each percipient
" Please record all impressions between 8.30 and 9.0 p.m."
8.30-9.4 p.m. : Mr B. read aloud a story by Wilkie Collins entitled
" A terribly strange Bed." It is a story of a young man who
narrowly escapes death from suffocation by a mattress which,
worked by a press in the room above, descends from the ceiling on
to his bed. The scene is a Paris gaming house. The thrilling
moments of the story were reached between 8.50 and 8.55 p.m. See
Table I, nos. 3 = 604, 9, 10 = 610, 40 = 634, 53 = 652, 55.
V. 2 November 1927 ; 46 percipients ;
agents : Mr and Mrs F.,
Miss H., Mr 0., S. G. S.
The following notice had previously been sent to each percipient
" Please record all impressions between 8.30 and 9 p.m."
8.30-9.10 p.m. : Mr O. read H. G. Wells's " The strange Story of
Mr Evesham." This is a rather weird story in which a decrepit old
man gains possession of the body of a young man and transfers his
own memories to it. On p. 37 occur the words, " Gripping my hand
with his long bony claw that was disengaged." 1
On p. 40, " I
gripped his shrivelled claw." See Table I, nos. 7 = 607, 13, 50, 72,
92 = 686.
VI. 9 November 1927 ; 46 percipients.
As two of the agents had stated on 2 November that they would
be prevented from coming to Tavistock Square on 9 November, I
suggested that all should remain at home and think of the Moon and
its associations in literature, between 8.30 and 9.0 p.m. During
this time on 9 November, I was in a train and called to mind various
quotations from Chesterton, Wilde, Lindsay Vachell, J. C. Squire,
and others, in which the Moon was the object of simile. See
Table I, no. 9.

VII. 16 November 1927 ; 35 percipients ;
agents : Miss N. and
Mr 0.
Percipients had been asked, "Please record all impressions
between 8.30 and 9.0 p.m."
A. 8.30-8.40 p.m. : The agents looked at a photograph of the
Venus de Milo. The agents spoke of the outline of the figure and
were impressed by the effect of white statuary on a dark background.
They also mentioned Paris. See Table I, no. 35. 1
B. 8.40-8.50 p.m. : The agents tried to transmit the idea of a
jungle, which they thought of as thick, hot, stifling, dark, silent till
sunset when it awoke into life. Columns of trees meeting overhead,
shutting out the light. A tiger, silent with glowing eyes. See
Table I, no. 35.1
C. 8.50-9.0 p.m. : The figures 26 written in white chalk on a
blackboard. No success.
VIII. 23 November 1927 ; 45 percipients ;
agents : Mrs P., Mr.
0., and S. G. S.
A. 8.30-8.40 p.m. : A toy jumping frog, worked by an air bulb
at the end of a tube let into the frog's back. The frog was painted
a bright green, with yellow stripes, and black spots and brilliant
golden eyes. I made it hop along the floor. No success.2
B. 8.40-8.50 p.m. : A small toy brown camel, with a blue nose.
I mentioned that the camel was " Ship of the desert " and an ugly-
tempered beast. See Table I, nos. 33 = 625, 89.
C. 8.50-9.15 p.m. : At about 7.30 in the evening, I had made some
soap solution in a basin from a special preparation bought at
Gamage's, for bubble blowing. With two small trumpet-shaped
tubes of white wood I blew large soap bubbles from 8.50-9.15 p.m.,
letting the bubbles sink gently to the floor and bounce on the carpet.
The company remarked on the beautiful iridescence of the bubbles
and also on the reflections of the electric lights in them. See
Table I, nos. 72, 87 = 676.
minutes I was unable to gather any definite impression at all. I felt that the
object of concentration was no common or material object. If I gathered
rightly it was something stupendous, subtle, vast in extent. Perhaps an invisible
element. Something astronomical, universal, international or a phase of
history. I was led step by step to Rome or Greece, the object being something
pertaining to Art and Literature—too difficult or subtle for me to express."
1
This is one of the very rare cases (almost the only one in the 1927-1928
series) in which a percipient obtains impressions which apply to two of the
three objects shown to the agents.
2
Curiously enough, a fortnight later, on 7 December, no. 23 (a medical man)
records, " . ! . toys including a jumping frog." No. 23 was unable to account
normally for the impression, but suggested that about a month ago (his letter
is dated 21 December) he might have seen a jumping frog in one of Gamage's
Christmas catalogues. There is no mention of any kind of frog in the 1927-
1928 series by any other sitter.

IX. 30 November 1927; 44 percipients ;
agents: Mrs F., Miss H.,
Mr 0., and S. G. S.
A. 8.30-8.40 p.m. : An artificial rose-coloured starfish with
frosted spines and a small picture of a woman's head at its gilded
centre. No success.
B. 8.40-8.50 p.m. : A toy " skipping girl " with yellow metal hair
and yellow feet, dressed in flowered muslin. When wound up with
a small key the girl skipped rapidly on the floor with a rope, and
turned slowly round, often falling over. No success. 1
C. 8.50-8.55 p.m. : I read aloud Ralph Hodgson's poem " The
Bull," which tells the story of an old bull, abandoned by the herd
he led, and left to die in the forest. No success.
X. 7 December 1927 ; 46 percipients ;
agents : Mr and Mrs F.,
Miss H., Mr O., and S. G. S.
A. 8.30-8.37 p.m. : I connected up with a dry battery a small
green shocking coil and let the agents hold hands and experience the
sensation of the high frequency current. No success.
B. 8.37-8.52 p.m. : I read aloud to the company Martin Arm-
strong's poem " Miss Thompson goes shopping," from the red
volume of Georgian poetry. No success.
C. At 8.52 p.m., having no other object to show, I asked the
agents to suggest something. Miss H. suggested that we should
each take off a boot and lay it on the hearth. This we did in
imagination only. No success.
XL 14 December 1927 ; 40 percipients ;
agents : Mrs F. and
S. G. S.
A. 8.30-8.40 p.m. : A mechanical toy windmill with red sails on
a green pillar. A little toy miller climbed the pillar while working
his arms and legs, and on reaching the door of the mill, promptly
descended with a sack of flour on his head. I made him climb up
and down several times. No success.
B. 8.40-8.45 p.m. : Mrs F. and S. G. S. experienced the high
frequency current in hands and wrists. No success.
C. 8.45-8.48 p.m. : I read aloud J. C. Squire's poem " Meditation
in Lamplight," describing the varieties of horrible deaths a man
may die. There are mentions of lions, sharks, strychnine, the rack,
falling over cliff, etc., in the poem. No success.
XII. 21 December 1927 ; 35 percipients ;
agent : S. G. S.
A. 8.30-8.40 p.m. : I wore a conical Pierrot's cap with yellow

Although no success was obtained by any percipient for object B on this
date it is curious that a fortnight later, 14 December, no. 6 recorded the
impression " A child skipping with a rope in brilliant light." No. 6 was
unable to account normally for this impression.

See Table I, nos. 75 = 665, 95.
B. 8.40-8.50 p.m. : A small toy railway signal complete with
lever and real toy lamp. See Table I, no. 59 = 656.
C. 8.50-9.0 p.m. : I put out the lights in the room and smelled
two square pieces of camphor for ten minutes.
Immediately after the experiment had concluded at 9 p.m., I
wrote a description of the objects of transmission and placed it in
an envelope which was addressed to Miss Newton and placed in the
Society's letter box. No success.
XIII. 11 January, 1928 ; 43 percipients ;
agents : Mr R., Mr S.,
and S. G. S.
A. 8.30-8.40 p.m. : I asked the agents to visualise from memory
a mushroom. The pink gills, the satin skin, and the white stalk
were recalled. Horse-mushrooms " as large as dinner plates " and
young " button " mushrooms were mentioned. No success.
B. 8.40-8.50 p.m. : The agents were asked to visualise the figure
of Father Time as an old bearded man, mowing down ranks of men
with his scythe. The drawings of Father Time in Eno's Fruit Salts
advertisements were also mentioned. See Table I, nos. 51 = 649a,
64 = 660.
C. 8.50-9.0 p.m. : I read aloud from Georgian Poetry, Edmund
Blunden's poem, " The Giant Puffball," in which is told the story
of an ambitious puffball that wanted to go on growing till it touched
the sky, but which was uprooted and left to perish. No success.1
XIV. 18 January 1928 ; 40 percipients ;
agents : Mr R., Mr S.,
Miss W., Miss N., and S. G. S.
A. 8.30-8.40 p.m. : I asked the agents to visualise the Bible story
of David slaying the giant Goliath. I also read aloud Robert
Graves's poem, " Goliath and David." No success.
B. 8.40-8.50 p.m. : Mr S. read aloud the Norwegian story of " The
Smith who could not get into Hell." In this story, a smith made a
certain pact with the Devil, who used to come to visit him in his
smithy with the object of taking him back with him to Hell. The
smith, however, outwits the Devil every time and gives him so much
trouble that in the end the Devil bolts and bars Hell against the
smith in case he should get in and create a disturbance. No success.
C. 8.50-9.0 p.m. I asked the agents to visualise a mason's trowel,
a sketch of which was drawn roughly on a piece of paper. There
was some conversation on the subject of bricklaying. No success.

No. 61 (8.40J p.m.) saw " A metal coffee pot which had a wooden handle
and a white knob on the lid." This description very accurately fitted the
coffee pot that was in the room during the experiment,

XV. 25 January 1928 ; 43 percipients ;
agents : Mr K., Mr S.,
Miss N., and S. G. S.
A. 8.30-8.40 p.m. : I showed a model of an icosahedron in amber-
coloured glass. The icosahedron, it will be remembered, is a regular
solid figure, each of whose 20 faces is an equilateral triangle. It
has 12 corners, the space at each corner being filled up with the
angles of five equilateral triangles whose bases form a regular
pentagon. There are 12 such pentagons, and I pointed out these
12 pentagons and 20 equilateral triangles as the predominant geo-
metrical figures associated with the icosahedron. See Table I,
nos. 34, 95.
B. 8.40-8.50 p.m. : I supplied each agent with a picture postcard
photograph of the statue of a nude Amazon woman seated on horse-
back with an axe in her hand. The statuary was white on a black
background. The agents remarked that the horse's neck seemed too
straight and long—too much like that of a giraffe. See Table I,
no. 45a.
C. 8.50-9.0 p.m. : Mr S. read aloud the first three-quarters of
Wilfrid Gibson's poem, " Bloodybush Edge," which depicts a chance
meeting between a tramp and a local poacher on a wild and desolate
moor in the borderland between England and Scotland. The poem
contains a good deal about ghosts. See Table I, nos. 28, 37.
XVI. 1 February 1928 ; 33 percipients ;
agents : Miss C, Col. H.,
Miss N., and S. G. S.
A. 8.26-8.40 p.m. : The lights were switched off, and at Miss N.'s
suggestion we told creepy stories in turn. Miss X. began by
imagining banshees and their wailings outside, trying to get in at
the window. I described an imaginary experience of being shut up
all night in a tiger's cage. I also described imaginary experiences of
being lost in the catacombs. Col. H. described dreams of being
pursued through passages by enemies. See Table I, nos. 5 = 605,
50, 53a, 92 = 686.
B, C. 8.40-9.0 p.m. : The agents watched Miss Xewton make
coffee in an apparatus like a glass retort, surmounted by a receptacle
that contained the coffee. They watched the water boil above the
flame of a small glass spirit lamp and rise up the tube into the coffee
container. See Table I, no. 24.
XVII. 8 February 1928 ; 35 percipients ;
agents : Mrs M. and
S. G. S.
A. 8.30-8.40 p.m. : I exhibited a dark blue toy policeman wdth
ginger hair and enormous white-gloved hand in the attitude of hold-
ing up the traffic. This large white right hand could be made to
move up and down. Mrs M. and I pictured ourselves in a bus
123] Experiments in Supernormal Perception 197
waiting impatiently for the policeman's signal to release the traffic.
See Table I, nos. 24, 31a = 622, 55a.1
B. 8.40-8.50 p.m. : I showed a postcard of a golden eagle (Zoo
series). We remarked that the eagle was the symbol of the West.
We also mentioned the Roman eagle and the eagle in the heavens as
well as the Austrian and German eagles. Allusion was made to the
exploits of the eagle as a bird of prey. See Table I, no. 30 = 189.
C. 8.50-9.0 p.m. : I showed a postcard of two tortoises (Zoo
series) with their necks protruding from their shells. The fable of
the hare and tortoise was mentioned and remarks were made on the
long lives of tortoises and on the tortoise as a useful garden pet.
No success.
XVIII. 15 February 1928; 34 percipients; and in addition 5
members of M. Warcollier's group ;
agents : Mrs M. and S. G. S.
On this date the improved dictionary control first came into
operation.
A. 8.30-8.40 p.m. : I showed a small " weather bird " whose body
was made out of a fir cone. It was painted a slatey blue and had a
whitish breast, black yellow-rimmed eyes and a small red top-knot.
The two feet, which stood very close together were large and webbed.
See Table I, M. J. B.
B. 8.40-8.50 p.m. : A small toy sign-post painted white and
standing on a patch of green sward. Its two arms bore the direc-
tions Norwich to Yarmouth, and Norwich to Ipswich. We men-
tioned the " open road " and George Borrow's feats as a pedestrian.
No success.
C. 8.50-9.0 p.m. : A toy acrobat who performed on a wire
trapeze, describing somersaults and swinging his legs and body in
the most realistic manner. The model was provided with a piece of
elastic, which, when twisted up and released, provided the energy of
motion. Some time before the experiment and earlier in the
evening, I broke the elastic by winding it up too tight, and had to
procure a fresh strip. See Table I, nos. 50, 52 = 650, 53 = 652.2
1
In a letter (14 February 1928) no. 24 writes, " The hand I saw was rather
small and delicately made and this made me think it might be a woman's
hand." These additional details somewhat diminish the value of the coin-
cidence. No. 55a wrote (17 February), " I felt the waiting was for some
kind of race or competition." This information again diminishes the value
of the coincidence. We may note that on three succeeding weeks, 7, 14, 21
March, there are solitary references to a moving hand.
2
It is interesting to note that in the following week, 22 February, M. J. B.
(Paris) notes, " A semicircle of metal turning very quickly, which appears as
a sphere on account of its rapid movement. An impression of dancing in the
air, lifting in turn my left leg and my right leg." On the same evening Mile L.
(Paris) records, " Looping the loop." Both the impressions of M. J. B. and
Mile L. would apply very well to the experiment of 15 February (C).

members of M. Warcollier's group ;

and Mrs H., Miss B. J., S. Gr. S.
A. 8.30-8.40 p.m. : An artificial dragon fly poised on outspread
wings on a copper wire above a bunch of imitation green leaves.
We noted the brilliant rainbow colours and veins on the wings and
also the long slender iridescent body. I mentioned that the dragon
fly was first a caddis worm, living in a house of sticks. No success.
B. 8.40-8.50 p.m. : A toy snake made from pieces of wood jointed
together with a tape running through them. The snake was painted
green and black and yellow, and could be made to wriggle in a
realistic manner by holding its tail and working its joints. It had
a red open mouth, no fangs, and small white glass eyes. Sensations
of horror were induced in one or two of the ladies present by the
life-like movements of the snake. See Table I, nos. 30 = 189, 65 = 661.
C. 8.50-9.0 p.m. : I switched off the lights and applied a match
to some firework sticks which, held in the hand, emitted showers of
silver stars and sparks. See Table I, no. 76 = 666.
XX. 29 February 1928 ; 34 percipients, and in addition five
members of M. Warcollier's group ;
agents : Prof, and Mrs M., Mrs
H., and myself.
A notice had been sent out to the percipients reading as follows :
" Please record all impressions between 8.30 and 9 p.m."
The agents met at 8.15 p.m. at 31 Tavistock Square, and then took
a taxi to the Royalty Theatre, where we saw a play " The Crooked
Billet," from seats in the upper circle. The play began at 8.45 p.m.
and as soon as the curtain was up, a well-dressed man crept down
some stairs into the common room of an inn, where a rough-looking
man stood in his shirt-sleeves. The first man closed with the
ruffian and knocked him down with a candlestick, but the fallen
man whipped out a pistol and fired on the first man, who fell appa-
rently dead. Another man entered the room from the door leading
to the stairs and with the assistance of the assassin, carried away the
shot man's body through the door. It turned out later that the
man shot was a retired Scotland Yard official who was engaged in
tracking a gang of criminals. I left the theatre at 9.15 p.m., but
the other agents remained. The shot was fired at 8.46 p.m. See
Table I, nos. 4, 48a = 647. 1
1
The impression of 48a is an interesting revelation of the way in which a
pseudo-success may result through the agents choosing a subject which
happens to coincide with a mental hobby of some particular percipient. We
find that no. 48a has a penchant for impressions relating to crime. Thus
14 March, " Munsden Mystery quickly solved in an unusual manner "
;
28 March, " Scotland Yard official overcoming an attack by a lunatic "
2 May, " Attempt to burn down a large public building. Reds at work but
prevented " ; 16 May, " Mr Lloyd George having to struggle out of danger."

A. 8.30-8.40 p.m. : A postcard of a zebra (Zoo series). No success.
B. 8.40-8.50 p.m. : A grey rubber elephant with tusks and a red
cloth on its back. The elephant could be inflated by blowing down
its trunk. Mr H. made a sketch of it. See Table I, no. 63.
C. 8.50-9.0 p.m. : A small toy clockwork car on three wheels.
In the car was seated a Japanese lady holding a fan, while behind
her stood a man with a large umbrella, on the top of which was
painted a map of the arctic regions. When wound up the car
described circles on the floor, the top of the sunshade or umbrella
revolving at the same time. No success.
XXII. 14 March 1928; 32 percipients, and in addition 3 members of
M. Warcollier's group ;
agents: Mrs M., Miss B. J., Mr 0., and S. G. S.
A photo of the Warcollier group was shown for the first time to the
agents.
A. 8.30-8.40 p.m. : A postcard of a peacock with spread tail.
This was drawn by all the agents. See Table I, nos. 26 = 165, 57,
52a, 71 = 664.
B. 8.40-8.50 p.m. : Each agent smelled a ball of naphthaline.
There was mention of naphtha soap and moths. See Table I, no. 50.1
C. 8.50-9.0 p.m. : I exhibited a small toy man with a clown's face.
When wound up, the figure drew his bow across the strings of a large
fiddle or 'cello, producing a phrase of six or seven notes. At each
motion of the bow across the fiddle, the man jerked out his tongue
and drew it in again. No success.2
1
We must note that no. 50 obtained impressions of odours on ten other
occasions and that none of these impressions had any relation to any odour
arising in the seemce-roorn. Moreover on the one other occasion (21 December
1927) when the odour of camphor was the object of experiment, no. 50 failed
to get any impression of odour. The percipient did not take part on 20 June
(Ammonia).
2
Although no success was obtained with this object on this date a remark-
able success was obtained in a Saturday experiment with the same object by
M. R. Warcollier. I quote this success because although strictly outside the
scope of the present report it is perhaps the most curious success in the whole
of the experiments. The object described in C above was the subject of an
experiment with the Warcollier group on 10 March 1928, 3.30-3.40 p.m. Full
details of the object were posted to Miss Newton immediately after the con-
clusion of the concentration from my own home, the sole agent being myself,
though other members of the family were present. There were only two
percipients. M. Warcollier (Paris) records 3.30-3.40 p.m., 10 March :
" Face
with mobile grinning features, winking eyes, mouth open, putting out its
tongue from moment to moment. Movement in jerks." The impression is
correct in three important particulars : (1) The grinning features (suggesting
a clown's face) ; (2) The putting out of the tongue ; (3) The movement of the
tongue by jerks.

A. 8.30-8.40 p.m. : A large coloured tortoiseshell butterfly poised
on a wire with wings outspread above a group of artificial leaves.
There were five spear-head leaves and three water-lily leaves,
together with a wax yellow water-lily and bud. The wings of the
butterfly had dark green tips, and the insect had two glinting gold
eyes. See Table I, Mme de Z.
B. 8.40-8.50 p.m. : A comic cloth " Judy " with a rubber face
and wearing black spectacles. By inserting one's thumb and little
finger inside the hands of the figure she could be made to move her
arms, nod her head and make grimacing faces. See Table I,
no. 60 = 657.
C. 8.50-9.0 p.m. : A small toy porter who, when wound up,
walked along the floor pushing before him a barrow on which was a
yellow trunk. The porter wore a red cap. The natural walking
motion of the legs was very striking. No success.
XXIV. 28 March 1928; 27 percipients, and in addition two
members of M. Warcollier's group ;
agents : Prof, and Mrs M.,
Mr 0., and S. G. S.
A. 8.30-8.40 p.m. : A small tennis racket with paper-covered
handle to represent oak grain. A small ball, half orange, half green
with a belt of red. Attention was concentrated on the meshwork
of the tennis racket. See Table I, Mme de Z.
B. 8.40-8.50 p.m. : A toy man with a chicken's head and wide
gaping tawny bill. The figure wore a yellow coat and blue trousers
and carried a drum on which it played a tattoo with two green
drum-sticks when wound up. On its back it carried a kind of fish-
basket. The figure had broad black iron feet. No success.
0. 8.50-9.0 p.m. : A toy man with a red peaked hat, green coat
and yellow trousers, driving a pair of dogs. When wound up the
team ran across the floor on four wheels and the dogs' bodies
plunged backwards and forwards in a realistic manner, the toy man
holding the reins. No success.
XXV. 18 April 1928 ; 21 percipients ;
agents : Prof, and Mrs M.
The subjects of experiment were chosen on the spot by Prof, and
Mrs M. The Warcollier group photograph was looked at by the
agents.
A. 8.30-8.40 p.m. : A black and white kitten played with a cotton
reel at the end of a string. See Table I, no. 86 = 675.x

This example of a " double " success is somewhat discounted by the
percipient's statement that on the morning of 18 April she had received a
circular relating to the East.

A. 8.30-8.40 p.m. : I showed sprays of artificial oak-leaves
coloured green, red, brown, yellow and splashed with autumn tints.
See Table I, no. 32 = 624.
B. 8.40-8.50 p.m. : A small pair of toy scales, each scale pan being
carried by three small chains. There was a drawer for weights.
See Table I, no. 53 = 652.
C. 8.50-9.0 p.m. : I made a buff-coloured clockwork hen run
across the floor. As it ran on wheels it flapped its wings, sometimes
falling over. No success.
XXVII. 2 May 1928 ; 24 percipients : agents : Prof, and Mrs M.
and S. G. S.
A. 8.30-8.40 p.m. : I exhibited a grey plaster ass seated. Part
of its neck consisted of a spiral spring so that the head could be made
to twist and waggle. The ass showed the whites of its eyes and
looked very ugly. Mrs M.'s cat smelled it and played with it. See
Table I, no. 89.
B. 8.40-8.50 p.m. : A toy figure with only one leg, which was a
wooden one. The figure had two heads, one a clown's head with
chalky white face and red spots and red cap on it, the other a coffee-
coloured negro's head. By pulling a string which passed up the
wooden leg, the two heads could be made to alternate, one head
being hidden under a blue cloth, while the other was in view. See
Table I, no. 86 = 675. 2
C. 8.50-9.0 p.m. : A toy brown bear with soft fur. The bear held
a pink ball meshed in white worsted thread between its front paws.
By means of an airball attached to a tube let into the bear's back, the
creature could be made to hop along the table pushing the ball
before it. Mrs M.'s cat got very excited, and having decided the
animal was not to be feared, struck it repeatedly with her paws,
trying to grab its fur in her teeth. A stick of incense was burned
by Prof. M. See Table I, Mme de Z.
XXVIII. 9 May 1928 ; 16 percipients ;
agents : Prof, and Mrs M.,
Mr 0., and S. G. S.
A. 8.30-8.40 p.m. : A small Union Jack about 1' by 1' 6". Men-

feathers. See Table I, no. 60 = 657.
C. 8.50-9.0 p.m. : A rose-scarlet and cream-coloured paper
Jockey's Cap, the flap being half red and half cream ; the divisions
being separated by thin gilt borders. A gilt paper badge on the
front showed a horse's head inside a horseshoe. There was a small
cream button on the cap. See Table I, no. 79 = 669.
XXIX. 16 May 1928 ; 20 percipients ;
agents : Prof, and Mrs
M., Mr O., and S. G. S.
A. 8.30-8.40 p.m. : I wore a mortar board hat. Mention of
academic costumes, colour of hoods, etc. See Table I, no. 5 = 605.
B. 8.40-8.50 p.m. : A small toy roundabout with three small
aeroplane boats which swung outwards from the vertical when a
little lever was pressed. The boats revolved at a great speed. There
was a central red pillar and each boat was supported by a copper
wire from a sky-blue revolving roof. See Table I, Mme de Z.
C. 8.50-9.0 p.m. : A toy contortionist with a Roman helmet and
two chocolate-coloured clubs in his hands and dressed in blue and
white muslin and yellow trousers. When wound up the man turned
somersaults and wriggled his body on the floor. See Table I,
no. 31 a = 622.
XXX. 23 May 1928 ; 36 percipients ;
agents : Prof, and Mrs M.,
Mr O.
A. 8.30-8.40 p.m. : A peacock and small peahen embroidered on
a large greyish square of silk. The peacock had a blue neck and in
its tail were yellow eyes dotted with blue. See Table I, nos. 48a
= 634, 92 = 686.
B. 8.40-8.50 p.m. : A pack of Tarot cards. Agents played at
gypsy fortune telling. Mr O. drew the King of Wands. See
Table I, nos. 3 = 604, 7, 59, 96.
C. 8.50-9.0 p.m. : A seamless unpainted wooden boat from Japan
(a cochin boat for running through the surf). See Table I, no.
51 = 649a.
XXXI. 30 May 1928 ; 21 percipients ;
agents : Prof, and Mrs
M., Mr O., and S. G. S.
A. 8.30-8.40 p.m. : A cardboard disc of 5-|-" radius, divided into
eight equal sectors by radii from the centre. The sectors were
coloured red, white and green. No success.
B. 8.40-8.50 p.m. : A square piece of white cardboard 9" side

with, a blue circle in the centre 2|" radius. At each corner of the
square a triangle was marked off and coloured red so that the white
portion was a regular octagon with a blue circle in the centre. No
success.
C. 8.50-9.0 p.m. : A circular disc of cardboard of 5f" radius
divided into concentric rings coloured violet, black and red starting
from the innermost annulus ; an orange spot was left in the centre.
See Table I, nos. 1b, Mme de Z.
XXXII. 6 June 1928 ; 19 percipients ;
agents : Prof, and Mrs
M., Mr 0., and S. G. S.
A. 8.30-8.40 p.m. : A small kidney-shaped Ceylonese fan made of
palm fibre. See Table I, nos. 3 = 604, 5 = 605, 34c = 628.

Mme de Z.
C. 8.50-9.0 p.m. : A black wooden cylinder with a square prism
penetrating it, the axes of the two solids being at right angles. No
success.
XXXIII. 13 June 1928 ; 20 percipients ;
agents : Prof, and Mrs
M., and sister, Mr 0., and S. G. S.
A. 8.30-8.40 p.m. : A rectangular strip of white cardboard
coloured and notched at the end to represent the arm of a railway
signal. No success.1
B. 8.40-8.50 p.m. : A postcard of the " Alpha " Novelty series
showing two white mice with red pieces of coloured glass for eyes
and white tails of spiral wire, which quivered when the card was held
in the end. I showed also a grey-black rubber mouse. No success.
C. 8.50-9.0 p.m. : Each agent looked at a postcard of a group of
statuary representing Laocoon and his two sons wrestling with the
serpent. The statuary was white on a black background. It was
remarked that the boys were disproportionately small, compared
with the giant Laocoon, and that the serpent was a very involved
and complicated creature. No success.
XXXIV. 20 June 1928 ; 19 percipients ;
agents : Prof, and Mrs
M., Mr 0., and S. G. S.
A. 8.30-8.40 p.m. : A postcard of the statue of Peter Pan in
Kensington Gardens ; mention that Peter Pan would never need to
pass examinations as he did not grow up. No success.

The two impressions (2, 23 November) obtained by this percipient
(Barnsley, Yorks) are perhaps the most remarkable of the whole of the
present series. With regard to 23 November (C) the description is extremely
suggestive of my gestures in blowing the bubbles (cf. p. 193). The pipe was
certainly " held like a pen " and my head was constantly being turned to the
right in order to disengage the bubble. The soap solution used, however, was
in a white basin and not a coloured saucer. The impression of the percipient
clearly preceded the actual experiment by several minutes. I had, however,
rehearsed the performance at 7.30 in the evening when alone in the Tavistock
Square sea/ice-room with locked doors (the room has no windows). No. 72,
perhaps the most successful of all the percipients, did only four weeks' work
and did not take part in the 1928-1929 series.

In a letter dated 14 February this percipient writes :
" The triangle came
•
—the bounding line that is—in a lightish golden yellow on a dark background.
So did the other things—I cannot account normally for the emergency of the
impression. Years ago I taught elementary mathematics." It will be seen
(p. 196, above) that the icosahedron shown was of golden glass. This per-
cipient continued in the 1928-1929 series, but achieved no outstanding success,
his score being 18/440=4-1 per cent.
2
This percipient actually obtained the greatest number of successes (5)
in the 1927-1928 series. Moreover it should be noted that whereas Mme de Z.
did only 12 weeks' work the two English percipients who secured four successes
each did 24 and 30 weeks respectively. Mme de Z. recorded an average of
2-6 visualisations per 10-minute interval, which is not at all exceptionally
high.
PART II
STATISTICAL EXPERIMENTS 1928-1929
By the end of July 1928 it became clear to me that little definite
progress was to be made on the preceding lines of experiment.
While there was a small residuum of material that was suggestive
of supernormality, the coincidences obtained were not sufficiently
striking or detailed to compel belief in the operation of a supernormal
faculty. One of the most disappointing features of the work was
the failure of the percipients to repeat their successes with any
degree of frequency or regularity.
I determined, therefore, to work each week with a much larger
number of percipients than had been hitherto possible and to use
material that would be adapted to statistical computation. To this
end I approached the Council, and it was arranged that Prof. Julian
Huxley should, on 19 September 1928, give a talk on the wireless,
based on some notes furnished by me. Prof. Huxley gave some
account of the results of the 1927-1928 experiments and asked for
volunteers who would be willing to devote half an hour each Wednes-
day evening for at least four months. He appealed specially to all
who had had personal experience of telepathy or clairvoyance and
to those who possessed the faculty of automatic writing or planchette
writing, and he invited them to communicate with the Society and
relate their experiences. Any blind people willing to co-operate
were also asked to write.
As a result of this appeal by Prof. Huxley, upwards of 600 letters
were received from interested persons ; 470 of the writers actually
took part in the new series of experiments. In addition 55 of the
1927-1928 percipients (including five psychics) continued with the
second series. During the succeeding six months the total number
of percipients was increased by the addition of friends, etc., to 579
(including six further psychics). No such body of percipients has
ever in the history of psychical research taken part in experiments
extending over such a prolonged period as six months, and the best
thanks of the Society is due to all these persons who gave of their
time and service so willingly.
Geographical distribution of the percipients. The 579 percipients
were distributed as follows : 143 lived in the London Postal Area ;
66 in the Home Counties of Kent, Essex, Surrey, Herts., and
211
212 S. G. Soal [part
Middlesex ; 305 in the remainder of England ; 21 in Wales ; 22 in
Scotland ; 15 in Ireland ; two in the Channel Islands ; and one each
in India, New Zealand, Holland, France (not in M. Warcollier's
group) and California.
Analysis of letters from prospective percipients. Of the 470
letters received from persons who afterwards took part in the
experiment, 353 of the writers claimed to have had psychic ex-
periences 1
of one kind or another, through the exercise of their own
supposed supernormal faculties. The remaining 117 letters make
no mention of personal experiences or faculties and of these 117
there are 30 that definitely disclaim the possession of any super-
normal experiences or psychic powers.
Of the 364 psychics 59 stated that at one period or other of their
lives they had been able to produce automatic writing or to obtain
messages by means of a planchette or ouija or by " glass and
letters " (19 of these 59 automatists apparently used some form of
automatic writing to divine the obj ects shown in the present experi-
ment) ; 138 of them claimed to have had successful experiences in
telepathy of either the spontaneous or experimental variety, some
acting as agents and others as percipients ; 53 claimed to have
had premonitions of future events or premonitory dreams which
were realised ; four claimed to have seen visions in a crystal ; two
claimed to be dowsers ; one claimed the power of making her astral
form visible at a distance ; four claimed to be influenced by " spirit
"
controls and to be spirit mediums ; 16 of the 470 percipients were
totally blind and two others nearly blind, and of these blind per-
cipients six claimed to have had psychic experiences.
It is noteworthy that none of the well-known professional mediums
could be induced to take part in the experiment. I personally
wrote to four of these who were known to me. Two urged lack of
time, one of them stating that " her form of telepathy was telepathy
from the spirit world and that she could not hope to succeed with
mine." The two other mediums did not answer my letters.
To some extent the above psychic classes overlap. That is to say,
certain of the telepathic class were also automatic writers, and so on.
Many of the experiences related by the 364 psychics were ex-
tremely curious, and while there is no reason for doubting the
authenticity of the majority of them, I am convinced that none of
them would repay a close investigation with a view to publication.
Adequate records of strange happenings seem seldom to have
been made at the time of their occurrence, and corroborative evi-
dence of any value would have been extremely difficult to obtain.
1
Many of these experiences would appear to have been very slight. The
most interesting are to be found in the groups of " telepatkists " and " auto-
matists."
123] Experiments in Supernormal Perception 213
The following extracts from letters written by percipients show
a considerable variety in the reasons they give for believing them-
selves to have telepathic powers :
" During my army service when I have been asleep on guard I
could always rely on being awakened by a voice calling my name
whenever any officer or N.C.O. was visiting my post."
" I find people can't lie to me. I read their thoughts and they
bungle the lie."
" Sir, having proved telepathy to be positive in a small room
and having found that my dog can read my thoughts I would be
favoured, etc."
" Astrologically I should be sensitive to any such experiments.
I was born with the sun posited in the fourth house under the sign
Pisces ;
Scorpio was in the ascendant ; the moon was posited in
the 9th house under the sign Cancer."
" Between my husband and me there was an intense communica-
tion without words. During the last months of his life I was
afraid to think when near him."
" I possess some psychic powers and a pair of eyes that flash fire
when they please."
" I never dream silly dreams or have nightmares but I dream
whole histories at long intervals."
General instructions to percipients. It was found necessary to
change the time of the weekly transmission to suit the majority
of the percipients. The half-hour was now fixed for Wednesday
evening 10.0 p.m. -10. 30 p.m., and it was arranged that the sittings
should be regularly held at 2 Adelaide Road, the home of Prof, and
Mrs Mackenzie. Except for the necessary changes affecting time
and place and a suggestion with regard to the use of a photograph
of the agents, the General Instructions sent out to prospective
percipients were practically identical with the 1927-1928 instruc-
tions (see p. 171, above).
The agents. The agents who regularly carried out the transmission
from 2 Adelaide Road, N.W., were Prof, and Mrs Mackenzie, Mr
Odell and S. G. S. Each intending percipient was supplied with
a copy of a photograph of the agents taken at a studio in Camden
Town. (Owing to the poorness of the lighting facilities at Adelaide
Road, it was found impracticable to secure a good photograph of
the group standing in the actual room where the meetings were to
be held.) The percipients were instructed to look at this photograph
for a few minutes before 10.0 p.m., and then to lay it aside. Mrs
Hughes appears in the group, as it was hoped that she would have
been able to assist at the meetings, but unhappily a serious illness
intervened and Mrs Hughes was unable to attend a single sitting.
p
214 S. G. Soal
The percipients were left unenlightened on the absence of Mrs
Hughes, and it is a curious fact that among their impressions there
are more statements referring to Mrs Hughes than to any other
agent of the group.
The recording of results. Owing to the large number of percipients
who sent in their impressions each week it was impossible for me
to open all the letters personally or to undertake the large amount
of clerical work involved in copying the contents of the letters
on to the record cards, the preparation of notices, and the answer-
ing of correspondence. Miss Helen Carruthers, a member of the
Society, was therefore engaged to do this work, and I should like
to pay here a tribute to the efficiency and business-like manner in
which she carried out her considerable task. Not only did Miss
Carruthers copy every letter on to its appropriate card, supervise
the sending out of notices, address letters of enquiry to large
numbers of individuals, but she also made a tolerably complete and
detailed classification of the impressions of the percipients relating
to the 27 material objects shown to the agents. This was an
extensive and most useful piece of work by which the percipients'
guesses were exhaustively grouped under numerous heads each
week.
The general method of procedure was as follows. By Friday
morning of each week the great bulk of the postcards and letters
had reached the S.P.R. office. A large card bearing his identity
number, name and address, was allotted to each of the 579 per-
cipients. Miss Carruthers opened each letter and copied the
contents on to the appropriate card, inserting the date and the
times of each impression. A separate record was kept of the
" Control Words." I spent the afternoons of Thursday, Friday
and Wednesday reading through the cards and classifying on
separate cards the percipients' impressions under suitable headings,
this classification having reference not only to the objects of experi-
ment of the current week but also to those of all the preceding
weeks. After the completion of the experiment in April 1929
many weeks were spent by Miss Carruthers in making independent
detailed lists connected with each object of experiment. In the
year 1929-1930 the whole of the 579 record cards and supplementary
cards were gone through personally by myself and entirely new
lists compiled which were compared with and checked by the
original lists made by Miss Carruthers. These supplemented and
corrected lists were used as a basis for the construction of the Object
Table XXXIII. Very considerable labour and hundreds of hours
have been expended on these Tables alone, and it is hoped and
believed that they are now practically free from error. 1

Table XXXIII is printed at the end of the report (pp. 303-349, below).
123] Experiments in Supernormal Perception 215
General scheme of experiments. The general plan of the experi-
ments is set out in the chart in which are given the numbers of
percipients and of additional agents, and a brief description of
each object shown to the agents. A more detailed description of
each evening's meeting is contained in the lists at pp. 280-302, below.
In these lists are to be found also the exact forms of the notices sent
out each week to the percipients and to the additional agents.
It will be seen from the chart that the experiments may be
classified as follows :
A. Twenty-seven attempts to transmit impressions of material
objects. In two of these, 7 November (i) and 28 November (i), the
main design was to attempt to convey impressions of the colours
Red and Yellow respectively.
B. Six attempts to convey impressions of simple geometrical
figures, together with five control experiments designed to provide
a statistical standard of comparison. In the five control experi-
ments no actual attempt was made to transmit any geometrical
figure, but the percipients received the same notice as in the six
bona fide attempts at transmission. This notice invariably read :
" The third object will be a geometrical sketch. Please draw your
impressions."
C. Eight attempts to convey impressions of a three figure number,
together with six control experiments serving as statistical standards
of comparison. In each of these 14 experiments the following notice
was issued to percipients :
" The [first, etc.] object will be a number
of three figures. Please record only your strongest impression."
D. Four attempts to convey impressions of a capital letter of
the alphabet, together with five control experiments. In each
of these nine experiments the notice issued to percipients was the
following :
" The [first, etc.] object will be a capital letter of the
alphabet."
E. Five attempts to convey impressions of a playing card together
with three control experiments. In each of these eight experiments
the notice to percipients read :
" The [first, etc.] object will be a
playing card."
In addition to these 69 experiments there was also an attempt on
6 March (i) to transmit the first verse of William Blake's poem
" Tiger."
It will be seen from the chart that three distinct transmissions
were attempted on each evening. There is an exception on 20
March when four transmissions were attempted. The period
devoted to each object, etc., was therefore as a rule 10 minutes, and
throughout the following work the three intervals 10.0-10.10 p.m.,
10.10-10.20 p.m., and 10.20-10.30 p.m., are referred to in order as
I, II, and III, instead of A, B, C, as in the 1927-1928 experiments.

123] Experiments in Supernormal Perception 219
Each percipient was allotted an identity number, and the 55 per-
cipients who had previously taken part in the 1927-1928 tests were
given numbers all lying between 600 and 700, to distinguish them
from the newcomers.
A reference such as 19 December (ii) 355 " A butterfly on a skull,"
must be read to mean that percipient no. 355 obtained the above
impression on 19 December 1928 in the second interval, i.e. between
10.10 p.m. and 10.20 p.m. In the cases where a percipient recorded
his impression at the exact end of an interval, e.g. at 10.10 or
10.20 p.m., the interval to which the impression was to be considered
to belong was settled by tossing a coin.
Methods of transmission. The object, playing card, geometrical
sketch, number, etc., was placed in a position in which it could be
clearly seen by all the agents. If a working model it was set in
motion. As a rule, silence was observed during the 10 minutes
of transmission but, when remarks were made bearing on the object
looked at, their gist was carefully noted by me. While one object
was being shown the other objects remained in my attache case or
suit-case till the time came for using them. Each object was
replaced in the attache case as soon as the period of transmission
was over.
In certain experiments, e.g. 12 December (i) alligator, the object
was exposed to the agents for one minute only and was then removed
and the agents were asked to forget about it entirely for the remain-
ing nine minutes. The object of this was to test the theory that
telepathic transmission of ideas takes place only when they have
ceased to occupy the field of consciousness of the agent but are still
active in his subconscious mind.
In cases when additional agents were employed a similar method
was sometimes used (e.g. on 16 January, when 23 additional agents
concentrated on the number 555 between 10.0 and 10.5 p.m.,
whereas the percipients did not begin to " listen in " for a three
figure number till 10.10 p.m.).
Group A. The twenty-seven material objects
Material objects such as toys, pictures, flowers, etc., when used
as subjects for telepathic experiments are less amenable to statistical
treatment than, say, numbers or letters of the alphabet. Certain
experimenters, however, including Warcollier, affirm that when a
person is asked to guess a number or a playing card that person is
apt to conjure up a mental image of his lucky number or favourite
suit, and that this conscious activity inhibits the emergency of
genuine telepathic impressions. According to Warcollier the best
results are obtained when the percipient is given no hint of the
nature of the impression he is expected to receive. Bearing in
220 S. G. Soal [part
mind these objections of Warcollier, I judged it wise not to eliminate
entirely the " free " type of material from my experiments. At
least one experiment, therefore, was as a rule arranged each week,
in which the listeners-in were given no inkling of what the agents
intended to transmit. In such cases the percipients were advised,
e.fj. :
" 10.0-10.10 p.m., please record all impressions."
The selection of the objects. The first six objects (10, 17 October)
were purchased on 4 October at three different London shops. They
were wrapped up and carried home and then put under lock and key.
On the evening of the 9th the six objects were labelled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
Three dice were thrown together and the three objects corresponding
to the numbers thrown were used in the experiment of the 10th,
the numbers chosen for the intervals i, ii, iii, being in ascending
order of magnitude. As explained in my description of the 1927-
1928 experiments the three objects selected were wrapped in paper
sealed up and carried to town in my attache case, which was locked
and left in the staff room of East London College during the morning.
After 1.30 p.m. the case was continuously under my observation
till the time of the experiment.
A similar procedure was adopted with most of the remaining
objects, which were purchased in batches of four or six. An
exception is the purchase of the postcards for 5 and 12 December
and 23 January. These were usually purchased in the week
preceding that in which they were required. They were handed
by me to Miss Carruthers, who kept them under lock and key till
the time arrived to post them to the " additional " agents. A
similar exception occurred in the case of the " Skull and Bird
"
reprints, which were obtained by Miss Carruthers from Robert
MacLehose and Co., Ltd., Glasgow, the Society's printers.
Not all the objects were purchased in London. The Calendar,
for instance, of 13 February (iii) was bought by me in Kingston-on-
Thames. In short, the locality was varied as much as possible as
well as the day and hour of purchase.
Explanations of Table XXXIII.1
The principle on which these
" Object " Tables are devised is as follows. Each of the 27 objects
has a Table devoted to it. The object is analysed into its essential
components and any obvious associations with it are noted. Guesses
of different degrees of approximation to the object are also given a
place in the Table. It will be seen by reference to any of the
Tables that each approximation or associated idea or partial com-
ponent has three lines devoted to it, and that at the end of the
1
The enumeration of the items connected with each of the twenty- seven
objects given in Table XXXIII differs somewhat from that given in Appen-
dix III for the Individual Scoring system. In the latter the analysis is
generally carried to greater detail. It is believed, however, that the classifica-
tion in Table XXXIII is quite sufficient for all practical purposes.
123] Experiments in Supernormal Perception 221
second and third lines are the words Peev.( = Previsional) and Post
respectively.
Now all objects employed in the experiments were shown to the
agents in either the first, second, or third ten minutes of the half-
hour. An object shown in interval (i) {i.e. 10.0-10.10 p.m.) will be
called a " first place " object, one shown in interval (ii) (i.e. 10.10-
10.20 p.m.) a " second place " object, and so on. The chief aim
of the Tables is to compare the number of impressions of a particular
type obtained during the ten minutes of the evening on which a
certain object was exhibited with numbers of the same type obtained
during the ten minutes intervals of other evenings when a quite
different object was being shown. To illustrate the procedure
adopted we may take Table XXXIII, 19 December (ii). Here the
object shown (a dog, etc.) was a " second place " object. While
the agents were looking at the postcard of the " dog and pipe
"
from 10.10-10.20 p.m. on this date, there was one impression of a
dog recorded by percipients between 10.10 and 10.20 p.m. This
one is therefore recorded under 19 December in the first or principal
line of the first item (" Mention of any hind of dog "). But there
was also one impression recorded between 10.0 and 10.10 p.m., and
this is recorded in the second or " previsional " line. One dog
also was recorded between 10.20 and 10.30 p.m., and this is noted in
the third or " post " line.
Now on the evenings of 21, 28 November, 5, 12 December, 9, 16,
23, 30 January, 13, 20 March, one object only was shown, and this
object was a " first place " object. Hence to form as wide a basis
of comparison as possible the numbers of dogs recorded on these
evenings are brought into the principal or first line even though the
impressions were all noted in interval (i), i.e. 10.0-10.10 p.m.
On 10, 17 October, there were three objects shown. On each
of these dates the first or principal line gives the numbers of dogs
recorded in interval (ii) (10.10-10.20). Those in interval (i) occur
in the previsional or second line, and those impressions of dogs
recorded in interval (iii) (10.20-10.30 p.m.) are to be found in the
" Post " or third line. On 13 February there was only one object,
and this was a " third place " object. Hence for comparison, the
number of dogs obtained between 10.20 and 10.30 is brought into
the first or principal place.
Again on 7, 14 November, 24, 31 October respectively, two objects
only were shown, these being first place and second place objects.
On each of these dates, therefore, it is the number of dogs recorded
in interval (ii) (10.10-10.20 p.m.) which is put in the principal or
first place, while the numbers recorded in the first interval (10.0-
10.10 p.m.) are to be found in the previsional or second line. On
these dates there are no impressions of dogs in the third or " Post
"
222 8. G. Soal [part
line since the third interval was devoted to a geometrical or number
or capital letter test.
Table XXXIII, 13 February (iii), illustrates the case of a " third
place object." On dates when there were first and second place
objects but no third place objects, the number of impressions
obtained while the " second place object " was being shown are
brought up into the principal or first line, while those obtained
while the first place object was being shown occupy the " pro-
visional " or second line. On 10, 17 October, when there is a third
place object the numbers of impressions occurring in the third
interval (10.20-10.30) are recorded in the first or principal line. In
this case the numbers which occur in the first and second intervals
are added together and the sum is placed in the second or " pre-
visional " line. On 10, 17 October there will be no impressions in
the " post " line.
On dates like 9, 16 January, etc., where only one object (a " first
place " object) is shown, the impressions recorded in the first interval
(10.0-10.10 p.m.) are brought up into the principal line, while the
" post " and previsional lines will be empty.1
We have then these facts to bear in mind in studying these Tables.
In all Tables where the object of experiment is a " first place
"
object all the " previsional " or second lines will be empty, while
on 10, 17 October, and on these dates only, the numbers occupying
the third or " post place " will represent the numbers of impressions
obtained in the twenty minutes (10.10-10.30) instead of in the usual
ten minutes. These twenty minute intervals are distinguished in
the Tables by being printed in heavy type. On dates like 7 Novem-
ber, where a first and second place object were shown the impressions
recorded in interval (i) will of course occupy the principal line.
In all Tables where the object shown is a " third place " object,
the third or post lines will be empty on all dates while on 10, 17 Octo-
ber and these dates only the number in the second or " previsional
"
line will represent numbers of impression obtained in the first
twenty minutes instead of in the usual ten minutes. These twenty
minute intervals are distinguished in the Tables by being printed
in heavy type.
It will be noted that the dates 6, 20, 27 February, 6, 27 March,
are omitted from the Tables. On these evenings no material object
was exhibited.

Occasionally solitary impressions occur in a line or position that should
normally be empty. These stray impressions arise through a percipient
recording a successful impression relating to a material object in a geometrical
or number test.
123] Experiments in Supernormal Perception 223
pients it will be apparent from an inspection of these Tables that
very rarely indeed is there a superiority in the numbers of impres-
sions for the different items on the evening on which a certain
object was exhibited over the other evenings when the object was
not shown. There is perhaps only one notable exception. On
10 October (i) there appears to be a definite superiority in the
numbers of flowers and even of red flowers. This is the only really
marked case that could be construed as being favourable to the
supernormal. There are also very slight superiorities on 17 Octo-
ber (i) (Explosion of Bomb), and on 21 November (i) (Wheels and
Rotation). Perhaps also on 13 February (iii) (Dogs) there is a very
slight superiority, and on 13 March (i) (Ducks).
So far as can be judged from these Tables the introduction of the
25 or so additional agents seems to have produced no perceptible
effect upon the number of successes.
The special experiments, 19 December (i), 9 January (i), 16
January (i), in which the percipients were asked to imagine the
object concealed under a black cloth, and also the similar experiment
13 March (i) with the attache case, were for the purpose of testing
a theory of M. Rene Warcollier. According to this investigator
when a number of persons fix their minds on the same or similar
objects they may be put into telepathic communication among
themselves. It was hoped that to provide the percipients with a
common starting point for their thoughts might either conduce to
successful guessing of the object beneath the cloth, etc., or failing
this cause a considerable number of percipients to think of similar
objects or even of the same three figure numbers in the succeeding
intervals (ii) or (iii), that is produce " mental contagion " among
the listeners-in of a supernormal and not merely suggestive variety.
Neither of these hopes has been realised. The chief effect of
using the black cloth on 19 December was to produce, obviously by
contrast, an exceptional crop of impressions of white objects such
as eggs, skulls, ivory models of famous buildings, white statuary
and also be it noted of canaries and bird-cages. These effects were
not so marked on 9 January, when the black cloth was used for the
second time, but they were still appreciable.
If the reader will turn to the " number coincidence " Table
(Table XXIV) he will see that there was no sudden increase on
9 and 16 January in experiment (ii) in the three figure numbers
which were guessed two or more times. Thus we find that the
only kind of " mental contagion " noted on these occasions was
that of simple ideas naturally associated with a black cloth.
In a similar way the focussing of attention on the attache case
(13 March (i) )
appears to have caused an unusual number of
percipients to think of books, parcels and articles of toilet or dress.
224 S. G. Soal [part
Special experiment on 19 December 1928. I am greatly indebted
to M. Rene Warcollier for arranging a novel experiment on 19
December. On that evening M. Pascal Forthuny was giving a
public demonstration of clairvoyance to an audience of 300 people
in Paris. Shortly before 10 p.m. M. Warcollier read aloud the
weekly instructions to percipients for 19 December, and explained
that experiments (i) and (hi) only would be attempted. The
audience wrote their impressions on scraps of paper and signed
them. I received, however, from M. J. Buraud only 58 papers ;
apparently the remainder of the audience had not thought it worth
while to hand in their impressions.
Only experiment (i) need concern us since it happened that (iii)
was a geometrical " control." The object shown in (i) was the
organ-grinder and monkey revealed by raising the black cloth.
The impressions sent in by the 58 Paris percipients were for the
most part names of common objects such as " bird-cage," " violin,"
"teaspoon," "book," "crystal ball," "skull," "bottle," etc.
The experiment was a complete failure. The impression of M.
Pascal Forthuny, one of the percipients, read " Objet metallique
pointu d'un bout. Brilliant." 1
Influence of seasons, etc. As might be expected the numbers in
Table XXXIII are to some extent subject to seasonal and occa-
sional influence. Thus Table XXXIII, 28 November (i), we note
that the popularity of chrysanthemums is greatest in October and
November, but tends to diminish after Christmas, while during
February and March the impressions of yellow flowers increase
owing to the blooming of the jonquils and daffodils. In the same
way there is a little cluster of " poppy " impressions (Table XXXIII,
10 October (i) between 7 and 21 November) due doubtless to the
proximity of Armistice Day.
Suggested use of Table XXXIII. It is hoped that these Tables
will be useful in future telepathic experiments, since from them
may be derived the approximate probabilities that the average
person will guess by chance a large variety of objects if he remains
passive for about ten minutes and records about 1-85 distinct
impressions, 2
this being about the average number of separate
impressions recorded by each percipient during the ten minutes in
which an object was concentrated upon.
Let us take for instance 19 December (i) (dog in cap with pipe).
The total records of all the percipients in the 27 object experiments
are equivalent to 8784 ten minute intervals. The total number of
1
The organ-grinder was certainly made of metal, but the description is too
vague to have any value.

For a discussion and investigation of the " average number of impressions
"
in the ten minute interval please see Appendix IV of this paper.
123] Experiments in Supernormal Perception 225
dogs guessed during the 27 experiments is 111. Hence the chance
that a single average percipient under these circumstances should
guess a dog of any kind is about sVVtj *- e- about 1 in 79. Simi-
larly the chance of guessing a cap, hat, turban or helmet is
= 1 in 75 about. Hence the chance of an average percipient
mentioning both a dog and some sort of head-covering in the same
ten minutes is about ^T x TV= 5-9V"s-
Actually we find on referring to Table XXXIII, 19 December (i),
Item 2, that one percipient (no. 451, 20 March (i)) recorded the
impression " Postcard of bull dog with sailor cap on head and
Union Jack on back." As there are 8784 distinct ten minute trials
the mention of dog and head-covering might be expected to occur
at least once.1
Here, of course, they are not only mentioned
separately but associated.
The individual scoring system. By the use of Table XXXIII, as
explained in the last section, it would be possible to construct for
each object an approximate scoring scheme by allocating to each
successful guess a score of - log p where p = the probability of an
individual percipient guessing the item correctly in the ten minute
interval.
I have not, however, carried out this plan for the reason that I
had scored the whole of the individual percipients' records on an
arbitrary scoring system before Table XXXIII was completed,
and re-scoring would involve very great labour. This arbitrary
scheme, of which full details are given at page 280 below, is carefully
graded and serves well enough to compare the achievements of
one group of percipients with that of another. Sixty marks are
allotted for each evening's work, i.e. twenty marks for each experi-
ment (i), (ii), and (iii) in which an object, three figure number,
capital letter, etc., was actually shown to the agents. Hence
omitting the control experiments which were not scored, the
greatest possible score any one percipient could obtain would be
1020. To get this score the percipient would have had to do 23
weeks' work and never to have acted as an additional agent. The
percentage score of a percipient is obtained by multiplying 100 by
the ratio of his actual score to his possible score, which latter
represents the full marks the percipient could have obtained on
the actual experiments in which he took part, those in which he
acted as an additional agent not being scored. As the scoring
system is not constructed on any strict statistical principles the
distribution of scores among the percipients is not precisely a
normal distribution. Moreover, the present system cannot be
1
In the above argument a simplified view is taken of the question as it is
assumed that the guessing of a dog and of a hat are mutually independent
events. This may not really be the ease.
226 8. G. Soal [part
used to determine whether any particular percipient's achievement
is due to chance or not ; but it does serve to compare the joint
achievement of one large group with that of another.
Distribution of the experiments among the 579 percipients. One
to four weeks' work was done by 172 percipients, five to nine
weeks' by 100, 10-14 weeks' by 91, 15-19 weeks' by 109, 20 weeks'
by 28, 21 weeks' by 22, 22 weeks' by 32, and the full number of
23 weeks' work was done by 25 percipients.
Comparison of Different Groups
In the following analysis I have thought it worth while to consider
only the 374 percipients whose possible scores equal or exceed 300,
which is roughly the equivalent of five weeks' work. The object
of this restriction is to allow each percipient time to " settle down "
to his average or normal performance.
The distribution of these 374 actual percentage scores is not
precisely a normal distribution. Nor had we any reason to expect
a quite normal distribution on so arbitrary a system of scoring.
If we take as the score of a percipient the percentage ratio of his
actual numerical marks to his total possible marks, we find that the
mean score of a percipient is 6-48. The mode of the distribution
is 5-50 and the standard deviation is 3-07. Employing the notation
given in D. Caradog Jones's A First Course of Statistics (1927),
p. 205, we find for our distribution : -225 ;
/i
2
= 2-95 ; K = - -230.
(For a normal distribution /3, should be about three, which is nearly
correct, but should be about zero.) Perfect normality is, there-
fore, destroyed by a certain skewness which can be calculated in
terms of /3X
and /?2
from Mr Jones's formula (16, p. 205). This
skewness works out to be -32 and equals [Mean - Mode] -f- Standard
Deviation. From this result we deduce the value 5-50 for the
mode,1
which agrees fairly with that found from the Graph.
We find that 65 per cent, of the scores lie within the range
Mean ±Standard Deviation, i.e. between 3-41 and 9-55, and 95 per
cent, lie within the range Mean ±2 x Standard Deviation, i.e.
between 0-34 and 12-62. These results would agree pretty closely
with those expected from a normal distribution.
We may consider that the number of observations (374) is suffi-
cient to determine the type of distribution within the limits,
Mean ±2 x Standard Deviation but insufficient to give trustworthy
information outside those limits. For the actual tabulation of the
distribution see Table II and the graphs.
In order to investigate whether or not any sub-sample of the

distribution the mode would be identical with the mean or average.

374 percipients is abnormal when compared with the whole we may-
make use of a formula given in Biometrilca, v. 182, and the data of
the distribution given above are consistent with the use of this
formula (see A. L. Bowley, Elements of Statistics).
The formula is as follows : If a distribution is known only by a
sample n, the mean being x and the standard deviation s, and if
for a sub-sample nv the mean is xv and the standard deviation sa ,
then the standard deviation of the difference x^x1
denoted by a is
given by the result

The last term will usually be so small that it can be neglected. In
our case
n=374, a>=6-48, * = 3-07.
nx
may be taken, for example, to be the number of percipients
who were automatic writers or the number of premonitionists as
the case may be.
We are now in a position to compare the performances of the
different sub-groups of percipients.
Psychics v. Remainder. Of the 364 persons who mentioned
having had psychic experiences there were 160 with possible scores
5:300. The mean score x1
of this group was found to be 6-45 with
a standard deviation Sj = 3-00. Hence ftj = 160, a;

cc = 6-48, s = 3-07, and using the above formulae we find a=-18.
-j ,- oo cc-% *03 1
Hence - —> = —= - .
a -18 6
On the whole, therefore, the average performance of the " psy-
chics " is neither better nor worse in any significant sense than that
of the whole group of 374 percipients.
Automatists v. Remainder. There were 46 automatists (plan-
chette or automatic writers) with possible scores 5=300. The mean
score of this group was 5-90 with a standard deviation sx
= 2-66.
Hence with «1

=2-66, x = 6-48, s =3-07, we find
x — x -58
cr=-37. Hence 1=—=1-6. Again the deviation is without
significance.
Telepathists v. Remainder. There were 99 percipients who claimed
to have had experiences in telepathy and whose possible scores were
5; 300. For this group the mean 3^ = 6-53, the standard deviation
s1
= 2-96. Hence with w1
= 99, n = 374, cc = 6-48, we find a=-26.
Hence — =—= - (nearly). Hence result is without significance. 1

For significance the ratio — 1 should exceed 2 at least.

Premonitionists v. Remainder. There were 43 percipients with
possible scores 5=300 who claimed to have had previsions or pre-
monitory dreams. For this group the mean 0^ = 6-50. The

Effect, of practice. Of the 55 percipients who took part in the
1927-1928 experiments and carried on with the new series, only
33 did enough work to obtain possible scores of 5=300. For this
group the mean score x1

Hence with w, = 33 we find a=-50. Hence ——= =- (approx.).

Hence result is without significance, and practice appears to have
had no influence on success.
The blind percipients. Of the 18 blind percipients only nine had
possible scores 5:300. For this group the mean score 0^ = 6-89,
s1
=l-72. Hence cr= -58. Hence ——?= —= ? (nearly). Hence
result is without significance.

Men v. Women. Of the 374 persons with possible scores 5=300,
156 were men and 218 women. For the men the mean score

possible scores 5=300 was 93. The mean score of this group was

The close approximation of the means of all these sub-groups to
the mean of the whole is an argument against the existence of any
supernormal perception in the mass. The separate Tables showing
the evaluation of sx

inspected at the S.P.R. Rooms by anyone wishing to do so.

The graph. The dotted curve shows the distribution of percentage
mean scores among the 374 percipients with possible scores ^300.
The percentage mean scores are represented along the horizontal
axis and the area included between the graph, the horizontal axis
and two vertical lines through any two points on the percentage
score axis (e.g. 3 and 7) is proportional to the number of percipients
whose scores lay between these two values (i.e. 3 per cent, and 7 per
cent.). A similar curve (broken) is drawn for the 160 " psychics
"
with possible scores ^300 and a ruled curve for the remaining
214 " non-psychics." The vertical scales of the three curves are
so adjusted that the total area underneath each graph is the same.

The notation employed in the above computations is that given by Jones,
op. cit., pp. 213-4,
123] Experiments in Supernormal Perception 231
It will be seen that the three curves follow each other very closely
on the whole, and there seems no justification for assuming that the
distribution for the "psychics" differs from that for the "non-
psychics," or from that of the whole.
Further Note on Individual Scoring of the 27 Objects
It should be noted that in cases where a percipient recorded more
than one visualisation or distinct impression on an evening such as
9 January when only one material object was shown, the impression
to be scored was chosen by the throw of dice as explained fully in
Appendix IV. On an evening such as 10 October on which more
than one material object was looked at, in cases where a percipient
recorded a successful impression in the same ten minute period as
that in which the relevant object was shown, the impression to be
scored was selected from this interval. If, however, the percipient
noted a successful guess in a ten minute interval other than that in
which the corresponding object was shown dice were first thrown
to decide from which interval an impression was to be chosen for
scoring. A percipient, therefore, who gave a right guess in the
wrong ten minute interval had a certain chance of gaining marks
for his guess but not such a good chance as one who recorded his
impression in the correct interval. Such restrictions as these were
necessary in order to put all the percipients on a common basis as
far as possible.
Distribution of successful contemporaneous hits on the 27 objects
by the 579 percipients
By a " contemporaneous " successful hit is meant any correct
impression of an object recorded in the same ten minutes during
which the agents looked at the object. It must be mentioned,
however, that in what follows the successful guess was allowed
to count even when the percipient had recorded more than one
distinct visualisation in the same ten minutes. That is to say, there
was no selection by dice.
(a) Four percipients obtained five successful contemporaneous
hits each. These were nos. 118, 255, 338 and 421. Their total
possible scores were 1020, 920, 860 and 960 respectively. Their
average 1
numbers of visualisations or sensations recorded per ten
minute interval were 3-19, 3-04, 2-42, 1-48. Their percentage mean
scores were 11-2%, 13-5%, 15-2% and 11-5% respectively.
(b) Two percipients (8 and 557) obtained four successful con-
temporaneous hits each. Their total possible scores were 1020 and
1
This average per ten minute interval for the whole of the 579 percipients
is 1-85. The averages for groups (c) and (d) were 2-81 and 2-18 respectively.
232 S. G. Soal [part

sensations recorded per ten minute interval were 2-52 and 3-44
respectively. Their percentage mean scores were 10-6% and

'
(c) Thirteen percipients obtained three successful contempo-
raneous hits each. The average possible score of this group was
884, and the mean percentage score of the group was 9-1%.
(d) Thirty-nine percipients obtained two successful contempo-
raneous hits. The average possible score of these was 741. The
mean percentage score of this group was 8-3%.
A successful hit, of course, may be a very slight success indeed,
and may therefore receive only a low mark. It by no means
follows that the percipients with the most successful hits with the
27 objects obtained the highest percentage scores. Moreover, a
high percentage score on the whole series may be the result of
exceptional success with the statistical material (i.e. numbers,
playing cards, etc.) rather than with the objects.

The distribution of high scores. Of the 374 percipients whose
possible scores equal or exceed 300, the distribution of the higher
percentage scores is as follows :

It is noteworthy that the three percipients who obtained the
highest scores were not particularly successful with the 27 objects,
but obtained a considerable number of partial successes with three
figure numbers, capital letters, etc.
It will be sufficient as specimens to quote the successes of
percipients nos. 338, 519 and 382.

A few typical impressions. We may conclude our discussion of
the 27 objects by citing a few of the more interesting impressions
obtained under various dates. It will be seen that the great
majority of these are isolated successes, which are obtained by
percipients with only an average score on their total output.

Concluding remarks on the 27 objects. While a careful study of
Tables XXXIII gives no indication of any constantly operating
faculty of supernormal perception among the mass of the percipients,
it must be freely admitted that the accuracy of certain isolated
impressions, or in some cases small groups of impressions, baffle all
analysis. If certain of the successes described in the preceding
sections are due to telepathy, we can only conclude that this faculty
is so occasional, so sporadic in its operation, as to be indiscoverable
by statistical analysis.

It is an instructive illustration of the scope of chance to compare this
impression with one obtained by no. 317 on 23 January (i), which reads :
" Burning paper. Girl with cigarette. Air balloon. Flash of light."
123] Experiments in Supernormal Perception 237
Special experiment on 6 March. Between 10.0 and 10.10 on
6 March 1929 a special attempt was made by the agents to transmit
the idea of the first verse of Blake's poem " The Tiger " :
" Tiger, tiger burning bright,
In the forests of the night,
What immortal hand or eye
Could frame thy fearful symmetry ?
"
A sealed envelope was sent to 23 additional agents, containing a
white card on which the above verse was written in red ink. The
notice sent out to the 230 percipients who took part was as follows :
" 10.0 p.m. Think over and write out a verse of poetry of not more
than 5 lines and record all impressions." The 23 additional
agents were requested to break the seal at 10.0 p.m. on 6 March
and to concentrate on the contents from 10.0-10.5 p.m. Concentra-
tion was to cease at 10.5 p.m. The agents at 2 Adelaide Road
chanted the poem together from 10.0-10.10 p.m. There was men-
tion of the ferocity of tigers and of poking the tiger at the Zoo with
an umbrella.
As a result none of the 230 percipients quoted any verse from the
poem in question, and no percipient mentioned a tiger. A few
percipients quoted poems in which " night " was mentioned, but
there were no close approximations to the idea of a fire in the
darkness. Perhaps the percipient who got nearest to the " spirit
"
of the poem was no. 232, who is cited in connection with the 27
objects (p. 235, above). His verse ran :
" God of the granite and the rose,
Soul of the sparrow and the bee,
Thy mighty tide of being flows
Through all thy creatures back to thee."
We may note a few poems quoted by percipients in order of
popularity. Undoubtedly the most popular poem was Longfellow's
" Psalm of Life," from which no less than seven persons quoted a
verse :
" Tell me not in mournful numbers . .
." nos. 152 (Letch-
worth) and 380 (Palmer's Green) ;
" Life is real, life is earnest . .
."
nos. 321 (Basingstoke) and 472 (Dudley) ;
" Lives of great men all
remind us," nos. 454 (Ireland) and 486 (Herefordshire) ;
" Let us
then be up and doing," no. 249 (Oxford).
Next there were six quotations from Gray's " Elegy," four
quotations from Wordsworth's " Intimations of Immortality"—these
being mostly the lines beginning " Our birth is but a sleep and a
forgetting," three from the " Ancient Mariner," etc. Two per-
cipients (163 and 628) cited the not very well known verse from
Fitzgerald's " Omar " :
" Lo ! some we loved, the loveliest and the
best . .
."
8. G. Soal [part
Coincidence in time for the " object " impressions. Taking the
dates 10, 17, 24, 31 October, 7, 14 November, and 19 December,
on each, of which more than one concrete object was shown, we
find from the Object Tables XXXIII that there were altogether
501 distinct successful hits. Care has been taken to count each
successful hit only once, as some hits are enumerated in the tables
under more than one heading. On evenings like 10 October,
where three objects were shown, we might expect by chance that
the successful hits would be about equally distributed among the
three intervals of ten minutes, so that if on such an evening there
were x successful hits in all, the expected number for each interval
would be xjZ. Similarly, on an evening like 7 November, on which
two concrete objects only were exhibited, the chance expectation
for each of the two ten minute intervals would be y/2 where y is the
total of successful hits on this evening.
We are thus able to calculate what number of the 501 successful
hits would on a chance basis happen to be guessed in the same
ten minute interval as that in which the corresponding object was
shown to the agents. This chance expectation of hits which are
neither " post " nor " previsional " is found to be 209-2. The
actual number of such hits is 210. Thus the agreement is unexpec-
tedly close and furnishes us with one more argument in favour of
the view that the successful hits have no special relation to the
particular time interval in which the corresponding objects were
shown. (The details of the counts have been preserved and can be
seen by anyone wishing to verify them.)
B. Geometrical Figures
The figures the agents attempted to transmit in the six geo-
metrical experiments are shown in Table VIII (Analysis of geo-
metrical transmission experiments). The notice sent out to
percipients is given on p. 215, above. When a percipient drew
more than one distinct drawing, the first in order from left to right
or from top to bottom was chosen for the purpose of scoring and
of classification. 1
The number of geometrical impressions sent in
was as a rule considerably less than the weekly total of percipients,
since a certain number of percipients seemed to shirk this type of
experiment. No additional agents were used in any of the geo-
metrical tests. The figure chosen for transmission each week was
deliberately selected by myself and drawn by me in the presence of
the other agents.
1
When, however, a percipient underlined one of two drawings as being a
stronger impression than the other, the stronger impression was chosen.
Where a percipient made more than two distinct drawings his impressions were
ignored.
123] Experiments in Supernormal Perception 239
Classification of the drawings. The sketches were divided into
two main classes : (a) " straight line " figures,, and (b) curved figures.
The class (a) comprised triangles, pyramids, prisms, quadrilaterals,
polygons and all other figures formed entirely or almost entirely of
straight lines. Class (b) comprised complete circles, ovals, arcs
of circles, spheres, cones, cylinders, crescents and other figures
composed almost entirely or entirely of curved lines. In the case
of a "mixed" drawing, in which straight lines and curves equally
predominate, one-half was counted to belong to class (a) and one-half
to class (b). Drawings of this type are, for example, a triangle in-
scribed in a circle, a circle (not excessively minute) inscribed in a tri-
angle, a sector of a circle or a quadrilateral or polygon inscribed in a
circle (or vice versa), a segment of a circle, a bounded semicircle, and
so on.
These two classes (a) and (b) were then sub-divided into smaller
classes such as quadrilaterals, complete circles, triangles and
pyramids, ovals, sectors, polygons, cones, cylinders, curved im-
pressions unclassified, linear impressions not classified, and so on.1
In Tables VII and VIII we are concerned with only three of these
sub-classes, viz. : (i) triangles and pyramids, (ii) complete circles,
(iii) pentagons and higher polygons such as hexagons, octagons, etc.
Class (ii) includes single circles, concentric circles, two or more
intersecting or non-intersecting complete circles, but excludes
sectors, semicircles, etc. Class (i) includes single triangles, tetra-
hedrons, a pair of triangles base to base or vertex to vertex, Maltese
crosses formed of four triangles, and also figures formed by a pair
of distinct interlacing triangles or of one triangle inscribed in another.
DO O
Pyramids with a square or polygonal base counted for only one-half
in the triangular class and one-half in the quadrilateral or polygon
class. Drawings of a triangle inscribed in a circle counted for one-
half in the triangular class and one-half in the complete circle class.
A similar partition was used in the case of a polygon inscribed in a
circle or a circle inscribed in a polygon.
Table VII gives the numbers of impressions in each class under
the appropriate headings in each of the five " control " experiments,
where no drawing was looked at by the agents. From the totals
the average frequency for each class is found. Thus the frequency
for the
1;
triangular " class (i) is found by dividing the total number
(259-5) of triangles and pyramids by the total number (1161) of dis-
tinct drawings. The result is 259-5 '1161 = -224, and so on for the
remaining classes (Table VII). These frequencies are then used to
calculate the expected numbers of each class in the other six geo-
metrical tests. The standard deviations are also calculated on the

S.P.R. Rooms.
240 S. G. Soal [part
assumption of a binomial distribution. In Table VIII these
expected numbers are compared with the corresponding " actual
numbers.
It will be seen that with one single exception (28 November,
complete circles and triangular classes) the actual deviations are
all numerically less than twice the corresponding standard devia-
tions. The deviation on 28 November just exceeds 2 x S.D. in
the complete circle class, but since this deviation is negative it pro-
vides no evidence for supernormal perception. It appears, in fact,
that the frequencies found from the control experiments apply
extremely well to the results of the remaining experiments, and there
is no evidence that when the agents have thought of a triangle, for
instance, the numbers in the triangular class show any significant
increase.
Table IX gives the numbers of times which the actual drawings
shown in the six experiments were guessed on each date. Here
again there is no evidence that the agents have augmented these
numbers on certain weeks by their concentration.

the influence of some common suggestion in this particular week.

C. The Three Figure Number Experiments
There were eight attempts to transmit a three figure number and
six control experiments. The notices sent out to percipients on each
occasion are to be found on p. 215, above.
On three occasions, viz. 9 January (ii), 16 January (ii) and
30 January (ii), between 20 and 30 additional agents were employed
to assist in the transmission.
The instructions sent to these agents is to be found on pp. 293-4,
296 below. It will be seen by a reference to the chart that on 9
January and 16 January the additional agents had finished their
concentration before the percipients began to record their impressions
of three figure numbers. This was arranged to test the " sub-
conscious " or " latent " transmission theory.
The selection of the numbers. On 21 November and 9 and 23
January the numbers were chosen by myself in private by drawing
123] Experiments in Supernormal Perception 243
from a bag a piece of cardboard on which was inscribed one of the nine
digits. The digits were replaced in the bag together with another
piece of cardboard bearing the figure 0, and the operation of
drawing was repeated twice. The three figure number was thus
constructed.
For the five remaining experiments I decided to employ numbers
in which all three digits were the same, and subject to this restriction
and the further restriction that no such number should be used
twice on different dates, the method of selection was by drawing
from a bag. The number was usually selected some days before
the date of the experiment in which it was required, and was drawn
by me in black or blue crayon on several postcards, one of which
! was handed to each agent. In cases where the percipient made an
extra guess,1
the first in order of recording was chosen for the
purposes of scoring and analysis except when the percipient had
underlined one impression as being stronger than the other, in
which case the impression underlined was chosen.
Explanation of Tables X to XIII. Table X gives the individual
percipients who guessed the number correctly and also those who
guessed the first two digits correctly. It will be seen that even
with the " popular " numbers 555, 777, etc. the amount of success
is negligible. Moreover, no individual percipient guessed more
than a single one of the eight numbers correctly.

The values in heavy type should be compared with the remaining
values in the same vertical column under the headings 222, 444, 555,
777, 888 respectively. Under heading 222, for instance, we find the
numbers of times 222 was guessed on each of the fourteen weeks. Look-
ing opposite 30 January we find that on this date 222 was not guessed
at all.

Note.—In each column we read opposite any date the number of
percipients who on that date specially underlined or emphasised the
particular digit given at the head of the column.
In Table XI 1
we investigate whether there is any general tendency
to get the first two digits correct. If the numbers in heavy type
in this table are compared with the other numbers in the same
column it will be obvious that there is absolutely no significant
superiority whatever in any case.
Table XII investigates the amount of general success obtained
with the numbers consisting of three repeated digits. Here again
if the numbers in heavy type are compared with those in the same
column as the one in heavy type it will he seen that there is obviously
no superiority whatever on any occasion.
Table XIII deals with those single digits specially stressed by
percipients. It often happened that a percipient guessed a three
1
In all the tables, by the total number of guesses each week is meant the
number of complete three figure numbers, one of course being recorded for each
percipient. A considerable proportion of the guesses each week, however,
were incomplete.
123] Experiments in Supernormal Perception 247
figure number and underlined say the first digit. In other cases
a percipient would say, "I see the figure 5 very strongly," or " I
see hosts of 8's," etc. Table XIII has been constructed to discover
if there is any correlation between these " specially strong " digital
impressions and the numbers shown to the agents. On 21 and 28
November the digit 4 in the numbers 444 and 424 was exhibited to
the agents as shown here : 4. Certain percipients wrote 4 instead
of ^. In the case of 4, if we look down the column under this
heading we find a certain superiority on 21 November, but none
whatever on 28 November. Moreover, on 5 December the number of
percipients who wrote 4 is only slightly inferior to the number on 21
November. Hence there does not appear to be much in the matter.
The only other case of a superiority is in the stressed digit " 8
"
on 5 December and 9 January. But here again it is doubtful if
the superiority is large enough to warrant serious attention. In
the case of digits 1, 2, 7, there is no superiority.
Explanation of Tables XIV to XXI. We have now to investigate
whether there is any general tendency to get the digit correct in the
hundreds place alone, or in the tens place alone, or in the units
place alone, or in the case of numbers like 777 in all three places.
To solve this problem I have constructed first 29 tables, of which
it will be sufficient to give the four for the date 16 January,1
on
which day the number shown to the agents was 555.
We can confine our attention to 16 January, hundreds place
(Table XIV). The second column under the heading Ns gives the
total number of times in which each of the digits 1, 2, 3 ... 9 occurs
in the hundreds place in all the six control experiments pooled
together. IV = 1371 is the sum of these numbers. In the third
N
column is found the value of for each digit, this representing,
therefore, the frequency ratio of each digit in the control series.
Column 7 under the heading IV,.
1
gives the actual number of times
in which each of the digits 1, 2, ... 9 occurs in the hundreds place
for the guesses obtained on the date 16 January. In column 6 is
N 1
to be found the value of -^j- for each digit, IV1
being the total
N 1
number of guesses on 16 January = 235. The values of ^j- are
therefore the actual frequency ratios for the digits 1, 2, 3, ... 9 on
16 January. Columns 4 and 5 are merely convenient steps in the
calculation of the numbers in the last column under the heading
The other twenty-five tables may be inspected at the S.P.R. Rooms.

The square root Ys of this quantity can be shown to represent
. N N 1
the ratio of the difference of the two frequency ratios ~ and
to the standard error of this difference.1
Now if in the majority of experiments the value of Y 2
con-
siderably exceeded 4 for the particular digit s in the hundreds
place that was being visualised by the agents, we should have
evidence that the agents' concentration was affecting the distribu-
tion of this digit. In the example chosen 16 January (hundreds
place) it is clear that for s = 5 (number 555) the value of Y 2
is "75,
which is very much less than 4.
The sum of the numbers in the last column, that is
^j!=i ^s
2
>
is called y
2
, and in the example considered (16 January) ^
2
= 4-88.
The magnitude of y
2
determines the degree of " closeness of fit
"
between the actual distribution (16 January) and the " control
"
series.
In the particular case considered by reference to Karl Pearson's
tables for statisticians we find for nine groups corresponding to
^
2 = 4-88 a value Px
a=-76. This must be interpreted to mean that
by chance alone a worse fit than the present one (16 January) would
occur on the average 76 times out of every 100 trials. We conclude
then that the distribution of digits in the hundreds place on
16 January agrees pretty well with the distribution in the control
series and that the fit is a good one.
In the long run the value of PX
2 should as often exceed -5 as be
below -5.
The values of Ys
2
in each of the eight experiments for the hundreds
place digit have all been tabulated in Table XVIII, and the value
corresponding to the digit concentrated upon by the agents on each
date is in heavy type. Not one of these stressed values of Y 2
even approaches 4, the largest being 1-50.
The last two rows of Table XVIII give the values of y
2
and PX
2
respectively. It is seen that the best fit Px
%= -93 is on 23 January
and the worst Px
2=-02 on 30 January. Five of the eight values
exceed -5 and three are less than -5. In the whole table there are
64 values of Y 2
, and by chance alone about 5% of these might
be expected to exceed 4, i.e. about three values. Actually there are
two such values, 5-67 and 9-81. Neither of these, however, corre-
spond to a digit selected by the agents.

Similar tables (XV and XIX and XVI and XX) have been
constructed for the digit in the tens and units places. Again, in
the tens place table (Table XIX) we find that the greatest of the
heavy type values is 1-24, so that none of these approach 4.
Of the 80 entries in the "tens digit" table (XIX), we might
expect by chance alone 5% of 80 = 4 values of Ys
2
to exceed 4.
There are actually four such values. Of the values of Px
* there
are three exceeding -5 and five less than -5. Three of the fits are
extremely close (-90, -94, -94).
In Table XX for the units digit the greatest of the heavy type
values of Y 2
is 1-27, so that none of them approach 4. In the whole
table there is only one value exceeding 4, which is less even than
chance would predict. Of the values of Px
* four exceed -5 and four
are less than -5.
In Table XXI for all three digits again none of the heavy type
values even approach 4 in magnitude. There are four values of Y 2
(slightly) exceeding 4 in the whole 50 entries, whereas chance would
123] Experiments in Supernormal Perception 255
predict 2-5 such values. Two values of P^ exceed -5 and three are
less than -5.
To sum up, there is an excellent agreement between the control
series and the series in which numbers were actually exhibited to
the agents. In no single case is there any evidence that the distribu-
tion of digits in any one of the three places has been affected by
the concentration of the agents. The experiments in " unconscious"
transmission (9 and 16 January) have equally failed.
The eight number experiments considered as a whole. We have in
all 2076 complete guesses in the eight experiments in which a three-
figure number was shown. Using for each week the control fre-
quencies NJN given in the third columns of Tables XIV, XV and
XVI, the reader may verify that the total expected numbers of
correct guesses in the hundreds, tens, and units place will be 215-3,
208-2 and 201-0 respectively. The numbers actually obtained from
Tables XIV, XV, XVI, and the twenty-one unpublished similar
tables are found to be 213 (hundreds place), 206 (tens place), and
201 (units place). The reader may with some labour verify that
the joint standard deviations for the hundreds, tens and units place
are 13-9, 13-7 and 13-4 respectively. The close agreement between
the actual and expected numbers in each case is a testimony to the
reliability of the control series.
Had there been as many as even thirty cases of telepathy among
the 2076 guesses in, say, the hundreds place, we should in all
probability have detected it.
Frequencies of the different digits. The following frequencies are
based upon the whole 14 experiments, i.e. on a total of 3447 guesses.
(a) Hundreds place.
Digit 3 7 1 2, 45 6 9 8
Frequency - -197 -129 -127 -105 -100 -088 -075 -074
(b) Tens place.
Digit - 3 2 7 0 9 4 1,6, 85
Frequency -123 -116 -115 -097 -094 -093 -091 -090
(c) Units place.
Digit - 7 3 9 1 5 6 2,8 4,0
Frequency -131 -129 -114 -108 -100 -094 -086 -076
(d) Total frequency of each digit.
Digit - 37 1 2 5 9 4,6 8 0
Frequency -150 -125 -109 -102 -097 -094 -091 -084 -058
It will be seen that on the whole 3, 7 are the most popular digits
and 4, 6, 8 the least popular. In the tens place there is a tendency
to equalisation of the different frequencies and a rise in the popularity
256 S. G. Soal [part
of two, perhaps owing to an unconscious association with the idea
of " second digit." The great popularity of 3 may be in part due
to the wording of the instructions to the percipients to record
impressions of a three figure number. The low total frequency of 0
is of course due to the fact that it cannot occur in the hundreds place.
Study of mental contagion among percipients. In Part I (p. 185,
above) of my report I gave several examples of pairs of percipients
who recorded identical or very similar impressions at approximately
the same time. Coincidences of this kind relating to material
objects have of course continued throughout the 1928-1929 series,
but curiously few of these are of any special complexity, and on the
whole the coincidences are less interesting than in the preliminary
experiments. It occurred to me that the three figure number
experiments might provide a means of testing this theory of mental
contagion.
The problem was as follows : Given r persons who each guess a
three figure number, how many of these 900 numbers (100-999
inclusive) would one expect to be not guessed at all, guessed only
once, twice, three times, etc. ? Mental contagion between pairs of
percipients would presumably increase the number of three figure
numbers guessed twice or more often. Two things therefore were
required. First a formula for calculating the expected numbers
of each class on a chance basis and next a criterion for testing
significance of deviations from the expected numbers. Dr R. A.
Fisher, F.R.S., has very kindly supplied me with a solution to both
these problems, and suggests that as his method may prove useful in
similar investigations, it should be printed as an appendix to the
present report.
If there are r percipients and m=r/900, Dr Fisher's formula 1
gives
the expected number of numbers guessed
0 times = 900 xe~m
1 „ =900xe-m xm
2 „ =900 xe~
3 „ =900xe~

m3
s times =
1x2x3
900 x e~
m . m'
1x2x3 . .s
and so on (e as usual is the base of Naperian logarithms).
This formula was first applied to the total 3447 guesses in the
14 experiments, so that m=%Vr with unexpected results shown
by the following table.
1
For the demonstration of this formula see Appendix I.

Total - 900-00 900
The above table shows that not only is there a small class of
numbers which are favoured by the percipients, but there is also
another class which is avoided. In fact the differences between
the expected numbers and the actual numbers counted in the
experiment for " 0 times guessed " and " 1 time guessed " are far
too great to be mere chance variations.
Table XXIII
In order of popularity the most highly favoured numbers are the
following :

555 and 321 20 each
365 and 369 19 each
100 and 357 18 each
237, 371, 567 16 each
It will be seen that the most popular numbers are numbers with
three repeated digits and certain numbers whose digits are in
arithmetical progression ; 365 of course represents the number of
days in the year.
258 S. G. Soal [part
Of the 98 numbers not guessed at all by the percipients, there
are 58 mumbers which have two digits the same and the third digit
different e.g. 886, 933, 808. The chance expectation is about 26-5.
This feature therefore would appear to be a characteristic of the
numbers avoided.
Only 3 of the 98 avoided numbers commence with the digit 3,
whereas 21 commence with 8 and 19 with 9.
Owing to the considerable divergence of the expected numbers
from the actual numbers in Table XXII, it does not seem possible
to utilise Dr Fisher's formula to investigate the question of mental
contagion among the percipients. In Table XXIV, however, I have
calculated for 13 out of the 14 weeks the expected numbers of three
figure numbers which are guessed 0 times, 1 time, 2 times, etc. (in
the line opposite E) and have set under these the actual observed
numbers (in the line opposite A). It will be seen that the number of
numbers guessed twice generally agrees very closely with the ex-
pected number and seldom seriously exceeds it. This is a point
which tells against the existence of mental contagion between any
considerable number of pairs of percipients.
Taking a group of percipients who have all made the same
number of guesses (say 12) of three figure numbers I have examined
whether there is any tendency for certain individuals to be asso-
ciated in more than the average number of coincidences with the
other percipients. For all the groups I have examined (14, 13, 12,
11, 10 guesses respectively) I find no such tendency on the part of
any particular individuals.

260 S. G. Soal [part
Other investigations in connection with mental contagion, (a) I have
also constructed tables to examine whether there is any tendency
for pairs of percipients who guess the same three figure number on
a particular week to coincide in their capital letter or playing card
guesses on the same evening. Such cases are extremely rare, but
they occasionally occur. Certainly they are not sufficiently
frequent to suggest anything beyond chance coincidence.
Example
Date : 27 February. Percipient : no. 337. Percipient : no. 518.
Three figure number : 428. Capital letter : H.
A comparison of the records of percipients 337 and 518 reveals
little evidence of mental contagion on other evenings on which both
took part.
In the following example there is not only coincidence in the
three figure number and capital letter experiments, but also approxi-
mate coincidence in the case of the playing card.
Date: 27 February. Percipient: no. 133. Three figure number :
355. Capital letter : G. Playing card : 6 of Clubs.
Date : 27 February. Percipient : no. 208 (automatic writer).
Three figure number : 355. Capital letter : G. Playing card :
6 of Spades.
Here again though there are slight minor coincidences between
nos. 133 and 208 on other dates, there is no convincing evidence
that these percipients were in telepathic communication.
(b) Tables have also been drawn up to determine whether there
was any tendency for the additional agents who concentrated on
the same object for the first five or ten minutes to be put into mental
rapport during the second and third ten minutes when they acted
as percipients. One hundred and five of the 579 percipients acted
as additional agents between 5 December 1928 and 27 March 1929,
and the average number of transmissions done by each agent was
about four, although certain persons did as many as eight or nine
transmissions. From these tables made out for each week I find
no serious evidence of mental contagion, either "telepathic" or
" suggestive," among the agents with regard to objects, geometrical
drawings, capital letters, three figure numbers or playing cards.
These tables can be seen by anyone wishing to consult them.
(c) As regards the "object " guesses, there were of course numerous
cases each week of two or more percipients guessing the same
object but the coincidences seldom showed any degree of complexity
in detail. For some 200 of the 579 percipients Miss Carruthers
made out for each percipient a complete list of all the coincidences
between the impressions of the percipient and those of all the
123] Experiments in Supernormal Perception 261
remaining percipients who took part on the same evening. The
coincidences for the most part are of a very simple and commonplace
kind, such as "Fan," " Basket," " Yellow flowers," "Ladies' shoes,"
" Polar bear," etc. Only very occasionally is there anything a
little more complex, e.g.
12 Dec W G^mdeman swinging small weight at end of string.
'
(203 (i) A small ball swinging by a thread.
21 Nov W Gentleman measuring with a tape measure.
'\193 (hi) Old gentleman with measuring tape.
In the last example it was revealed by further correspondence
that no. 193 imagined his gentleman to be measuring " ground,"
while no. 199 saw his gentleman measuring another man along the
back, presumably for a suit. But even the examples we have quoted
are almost the only ones worthy of note. Moreover, such interesting
coincidences as these never occur twice between the same pair of
percipients. Between nos. 199 and 203, for instance, I find no
further coincidences of even a simple kind. The same is true for
nos. 199 and 193.
It must be confessed in conclusion that throughout the present
extensive series of experiments I find no satisfactory evidence of
what Warcollier has called "mental contagion" that cannot be
reasonably explained away as pointing to either a definite suggestion
from the agents conveyed normally to the percipients or to the
influences of a common civilised environment. And there I must
leave the question.
D. Capital Letters
There were four attempts to transmit the impression of a capital
letter of the English alphabet, together with five control experi-
ments. On each of the four occasions the letter was selected by
me by striking a page of print at random with the point of a pencil,
the eyes being closed. The letter chosen was drawn on a postcard.
Statistical analysis. No single percipient guessed more than one
of the four letters correctly. The method adopted is precisely
similar to that used in the three figure number experiments. It
will suffice to give a single table 1
—that for 30 January, when the
letter H was shown. In the second column Table XXV we find
the aggregate number of times each letter was guessed in all five
control experiments. In the last column but one is recorded the
number of times each letter was guessed on 30 January. It will
be seen that certain letters like N, I, Y, U are so unpopular that it
has been necessary to collect them into a single group.

The remaining tables are available to anyone who cares to inspect them
at the S.P.R. Rooms.

It is seen that the value of Y 2
never even approaches 4. In all
four tables (82 entries) the value of Y 2
exceeds 4 on two occasions,
once (5-14) on 5 December and once (4-67) on 13 February.
It will be seen that two values of Px
* exceed -5 and the other two
are less than -5, which is what we should expect under normal
circumstances. Two of the fits (12 December and 30 January) are
very fair.
Popularity of the different letters. Taking all nine experiments
we have a total of 2394 guesses. It will be seen from the following
list that the most favoured letters are A, the labials B, M, P, the
sibilant S and the aspirant H. The least popular are the nasal N
and the letters Y, I, U.
The letters A, B were guessed 175 times each ;
S, 145 times ;
M, 141 times ;
P, 122 times ;
H, 118 times ;
G, C, 117 times each ;

E. Experiments with Playing Cards
There were five attempts to convey impressions of a playing card,
and in addition three control experiments. The card was chosen
by myself on each occasion by cutting from a full pack. As addi-
tional agents were frequently employed this selection generally
took place in the presence of Miss Carruthers, a few days before the
date of the experiment.

cipients are given below. The notation used is that of Dr Fisher's

A further test was organised for these six most successful per-
cipients. On the five Wednesday evenings commencing 2 October
and ending 6 November 1929 it was arranged that I alone should
concentrate on five playing cards between 10.0 p.m. and 10.25 p.m.
Five minutes were allowed for the transmission of each card, the
method of transmission being active concentration and visualisation
for the first three cards and the " glance and forget " method for the
remaining two. The five cards for each evening were drawn by
Col. Hayward at 31 Tavistock Square, in the sole presence of Miss
Carruthers, who noted their values and posted each card to me
in a sealed envelope, which arrived on the morning of the experiment.
The seals were broken at home or elsewhere by me at the times
indicated on the envelopes, 10.0 p.m., 10.5 p.m., etc., in the presence
of a witness who duly affixed his signature.
The six percipients received the usual notice with the appropriate
times inserted and sent in their impressions to the S.P.R. Office
in the usual way. These impressions were received by Miss Car-
ruthers, who kept a record of them.
Each percipient thus did 25 guesses. These sets of 25 were scored
on Fisher's system.
The scores were as follows :
It will be seen that all these scores are well under 15-18 and
there is no suggestion of supernormal faculty on the part of any
percipient.
Investigation of colour and suit. As the total number of card
guesses (1083 in all) is comparatively small I have thought it worth

while to make an analysis only of colour and suit. In Table XXIX
1 have worked out the expected preference factors 1
for red and
black on the basis of the 6317 guesses obtained in the card-guessing
experiment carried out with Miss Jephson and Mr Besterman
(Proceedings, xxxix. 375). I thus obtain j9^=-513 and ^> B =-487.
The factors obtained on the basis of the three control experiments
agree pretty well with the above values, being pK = -521 and pB = -479,
even although the control series is a somewhat small one. I have
based my preference factors on the joint experiment rather than
on the B.B.C. experiment, since the conditions of the former experi-
ment more nearly approach those of the actual series in which the
card guessed one week probably to some extent influences the choice
in the succeeding week. It will be seen from Table XXIX that all
the deviations with the exception of that on 6 February are less than
2 x S.D. This particular week (6 February) does not, however,
furnish any evidence in favour of the supernormal since the deviation
is negative. But what is really important is the fact that on the
whole series the deviation (
- 25) is well under 2 x S.D. = 32-8.

Acknowledgments. In concluding these statistical sections I
especially wish to thank Dr E. S. Pearson of the Biometric Labora-
tory, University College, for his very valuable assistance in connec-
tion with the Px
2 tables and the problem of " mental contagion."
Not only has Dr Pearson spent several hours discussing these
matters with me, but he has also taken the trouble to work out in
detail the table for letter " F " as a specimen. He has also kindly
allowed me to copy out data from Karl Pearson's tables for
statisticians in the library of the laboratory.
I have already had occasion to mention the valuable assistance
rendered me by Dr Fisher, F.R.S., in solving the problem of the
number coincidences, and the best thanks of the Society are due to
this gentleman, as well as to Dr Pearson, for the unfailing courtesy
123] Experiments in Supernormal Perception 267
and patience with which they have met the difficulties of a mere
beginner in statistics.
I must also thank my friend Dr A. E. Church, another statistician,
for very useful advice relating to the graph showing the distribution
of scores.
The dictionary tests, 1928-1929. The dictionary "control"
was continued throughout the year 1928-1929 under the conditions
described in Part I. Many percipients, however, omitted to carry
out the dictionary test and most others erred in choosing an in-
sufficient number of words to tally with the number of distinct ideas
contained in their impressions. Some excuse must, of course, be
allowed as opinions as to what constituted a distinct idea must
naturally vary. An impression such as " saw man tossing a ball
"
would, according to my intention, require three " control words
"
corresponding to the three different ideas of " man," " tossing
"
and " ball," whereas many percipients would content themselves
with only one word.
The only use I have made of the control in the present series of
experiments is to examine, for the sake of curiosity, the number of
successful hits scored by the dictionary each week on the objects
shown to the agents. Here are a few specimen weeks chosen quite
at random.

chance coincidence when a large number of guesses are made.

123] Experiments in Supernormal Perception 269
The only case at all interesting is that of percipient 118, who in
the card-guessing experiment obtained a success exceeding 3 x stan-
dard deviation. Although in the present series his total percentage
score is only 11-2%, he is the most successful of all the percipients
in guessing the colour of the object (cf. p. 233). However, in the
card-guessing experiment his forte was decidedly not colour or suit,
but number. The coincidence, therefore, is probablv only a mere
fluke.
Similarly, of the eight percipients with possible scores 5=300 who
obtained the highest percentage mean scores in the present experi-
ment (15-2 - 14-0%), only one obtained a mean score in the card-
guessing experiment exceeding 12 (12-7). The other seven were
below even the average (11-18). There appears, therefore, no sort
of correlation between successful guessing in the two experiments.
Conclusion. At the end of an elaborate and somewhat minute
examination which has occupied a considerable portion of the leisure
time of four years we may conclude without hesitation that we fail
to discover on the scale of the present experiments any general
mass faculty of supernormal perception. And this is true for each
of the five classes of objects which have been made the material of
experiment. Increasing the number of agents even until it reaches
30 per cent, of the number of the percipients produces no observable
effect on the result. Similarly we fail to find any serious evidence
whatever for what Warcollier has called " la contagion mentale
"
or telepathic rapport between pairs or among groups of percipients.
But though I have spent weeks searching for such things as
cross-correspondences, I have not found them. What does seem
to emerge from the present experiments is the real existence of
mass preference factors for certain simple geometrical figures
letters of the alphabet, colours, numbers, etc. That these factors
are subject to a certain limited fluctuation is only to be expected,
but when the same group of people work week after week under the
same conditions they appear to remain fairly constant. The same
is probably true within wider limits of common objects, such as
cats, dogs, flowers, birds, etc., though, as we have seen in the experi-
ments with the black cloth, a simple suggestion from the experimenter
will readily disturb the distribution and cause certain classes of
objects to be guessed with more than the usual frequency.
How far the determination and use of such preference factors
will be an aid in appraising the value of successful hits in future
experiments practice can alone determine. From the data of the
present experiment I have worked out such preference factors for
more than 150 different objects. The value of p = l in N given for
each object may be taken to represent (with fair approximation
when p is greater than 1 /100 but only roughly where p is less than
270 S. 0. Soal [part
1 /1000) the chance that the average person who keeps his mind
passive for ten minutes and records during that interval an average
of 1-85 distinct visualisations shall note the object in question.
For the object " flowers of any description " the " average " person
of the particular class who did the experiments might be expected
to note a flower or flowers about once in 18 sittings in the long run.
But this " average " person probably does not exist as an indi-
vidual, since each person in the world will have a bias towards
certain specific classes of objects. Yet even when dealing with
an individual one might reasonably expect that his preferences
would be abnormal only with respect to a small percentage of the
objects catalogued in the present lists, covering as these do an
extremely wide and representative field.
At the same time the tables of preference factors will be better
adapted for testing considerable groups of people than individuals.
Needless to add that the persons subjected to these " stan-
dardised " object tests should not be those who have studied the
present lists, for with such persons the tests might fail as igno-
miniously as the standardised Binet-Simon tests of intelligence
if applied to a group of schoolboys who had learned the answers
to all the questions given in Mr Burt's book.
But to return to the main conclusions of this report. If we have
failed on the present scale of numbers to obtain evidence of a mass
faculty of supernormal perception, we have failed equally to discover
individual percipients with indisputable claims to a supernormal
power. Two or three isolated cases in which the evidence is
suggestive, but very far from conclusive in any way, is all we are
able to record.
This almost universal paucity of continued success in our opinion
greatly enhances the claims of a few exceptional people in the world
(such as Mrs Piper and Mrs Leonard) to be considered possessors
of supernormal faculties. For these individuals have succeeded
in producing extraordinarily complex coincidences week after
week and year after year. Between the work of say Mrs Leonard
and that of any percipient who took part in the present experiments
there is a wide and unbridgeable gulf. That does not, of course,
imply that had Mrs Leonard taken part in the present series she
would have done immeasurably better than the average, for it may
be that the conditions of the present experiment are not those
under which supernormal knowledge makes its appearance. Possibly
some special state of mind such as hypnosis or trance in combination
with faculties that cannot be cultivated but are innate is required
before perception at a distance takes place. Possibly also the
co-operation of the discarnate is necessary for the production of
telepathy among the living. And even when, as in the case of Mrs
123] Experiments in Supernormal Perception 271
Leonard, such a combination is realised some sort of personal link
may be necessary, such as a glove, etc., belonging to the person
whose environment the psychic is trying to penetrate. Or again,
some strong emotional stimulus, such as belief in the spirit hypo-
thesis provides, may be an important factor.
In the case of normal or almost normal persons, we may doubt
if they ever have experiences of telepathic perception, except when
in some state of peculiar mental stress or crisis.
It is hoped that the present report will at least do something to
combat a growing tendency on the part of many psychical re-
searchers to assume, and apparently to believe, that psychic ex-
periences are as common as blackberries. One constantly hears
of little groups of people, apparently the possessors of no exceptional
or outstanding psychic gifts, describing experiments in telepathy
among themselves, and success is almost invariably claimed for
such experiments. Such accounts will seldom bear a critical
examination. The usual method is to select a few of the more
striking coincidences from large numbers of failures. Then follows
a vaguely worded reference to percentages of successes, in which the
term " success " is often allowed the most elastic interpretation,
not infrequently being applied to objects not even selected by the
experimenter. But mere percentages of successes are not very
useful unless we have definite and precise expectations with which
to compare them. In such experiments as I am alluding to these
standards of comparison are almost invariably lacking, or at any
rate inadequate. Moreover, instead of being given an exact
account of the precise conditions under which each experiment was
carried out, we are regaled with "samples" of successes generally
chosen to illustrate preconceived theories of the way in which
telepathy is supposed to work. I believe this inveterate deter-
mination to find the supernormal at all costs in every series of
experiments to be the most injurious influence in psychical research
to-day. The scepticism of the open-minded man of science who
has not given much attention to the subject is an entirely wholesome
thing compared with the " will to believe " shown by the class of
psychical researchers whose real aim appears to be not the investiga-
tion of the conditions under which telepathy and clairvoyance
occur, or the question whether they occur at all, but the production
of examples of these faculties for the purpose of bolstering up beliefs
they hold on the destiny and spiritual nature of man or for the purpose
of confuting the spirit hyjMhesis. It is easy to understand how
the psychic researcher actuated by such motives becomes the
prey to self-deception, as it is easy to understand his innate dislike
of statistical methods, and in fact of all minute and dispassionate
threshing out and weighing up of evidence. His desire is for
272 S. G. Soal [PART 123]
supernormal happenings, and he is not disposed to look too critically
at the methods by which these supposedly supernormal facts were
established. And experiments in telepathy and clairvoyance
unfortunately are the easiest in the world to manipulate so as to
give the illusion of success.
But in the present obscure position of psychical research, when
even the occurrence of telepathy is granted by only a small minority
of men of science, it is just as important to investigate conditions
under which telepathy does not occur as to produce specific examples
of its occurrence. It is because I have felt that the methods we
employ in estimating our results are at least as important as the
results themselves that I have thought it worth while to carry out
this investigation to the bitter end of a negative conclusion.
APPENDIX I
Dr K. A. Fisher, F.R.S., has very kindly communicated to me the
following investigation of the theoretical distribution of iV random
guesses at three figure numbers. I give Dr Fisher's demonstration
in his own words. I alone am responsible for the illustration of the
use of the formulae in the section beginning "As an illustration
we may apply the above formula . . . etc."
Dr Fisher writes :
" First as to the theoretical distribution for N really random

"If n1; n2 , . . • W900 are ^e number of times the individual 900

Hence we find

This is of course an excellent fit, as would be expected, since the
values in line " E " are calculated values.
Taking now the observed values for the same date opposite line
"A" (27 February) we have .^ = 709, jt2 =158, 7r3

and higher values =0.
Hence y2

Hence

Standard Deviation 1
Here we have a suggestion of interference with the normal distri-
bution, due to the fact that the guesses are not random but biassed
in favour of special types of three figure numbers.

Suppose we have a set of N individuals each of which can be
assigned to one of k groups according to certain characteristics.
Let the numbers of individuals which belong to the k groups be

The proportion of individuals in the sth group will then be -A

The proportion in the sth group will be ~j .

The proportions ^ and ^ will not usually be quite the same.
The question arises : Can the two sets of N and N1
be regarded
merely as two samples of a large common population and are the
differences in proportion ^ ~
]yi
merely chance differences ?
Or on the other hand are the two groups N and N1
fundamentally
n. n}
different and the discrepancy in the ratios y , too large to be
explained by chance 1
Now assuming that N, N1
are mere samples of a larger common
population let us suppose that the true value of the proportion for
the sth group is
ps
. Then for the group N the standard deviation
11 I in M try \
of the ratio ~ will be
V N ^e stanc* ar(* deviation of
the ratio ^ will be JPs{1

Hence the standard deviation of the difference ~ - will be

123] Experiments in Supernormal Perception 211
The true value of ps
is of course unknown, but we might take as
our best approximation the value ffs
=
jy ^ jyi •
Now if the number of groups k is large the value of ps
will gener-
ally be small and Jps
{l —ps ) will be nearly equal to Jps .
Hence an approximation to the standard error of the difference

Hence we see that the difference ^-^f, divided by the esti-

mated standard deviation of this difference is equal to

say).
•Jns +
For there to be a serious discrepancy in say the sth group of the
two sets N and iV1
the value of Ys
should considerably exceed 2.
Or Fs
2
should exceed 4.
But it is possible to go further and to institute a comparison of
the two sets N and N1
,
considering them as wholes. The following
method is due to the genius of Prof. Karl Pearson.
The quantity formed by adding together the squares of the values
of Ys
for all the different groups,
i.e. + F2
2
+ Y3
2
+ . . . Yk
2
, is known as %
2
and is a sort of measure of the discrepancy between the two sets
N, N1 considered as wholes.
Now provided that the values of ns and ns
x
are not too small (say
when all the values ns, are each ^10 or thereabouts), Prof.
Pearson has shown that it is possible to estimate theoretically the
probability, in drawing two random samples N, N1
from a large
common population classed in k groups, of obtaining a value of yj-
greater than or equal to some observed value. Tables have been
constructed on the double entry principle in which the values of
X
2
are tabulated horizontally at unit intervals and k the number of
groups tabulated vertically. For each pair of values of y
2
and k
we read from the table a decimal called Px
z. This quantity Px
t
represents the chance or probabibty that if the two sets N, N1
were random samples of a common population a value of y
2
as
great or greater than the actual value would be obtained.
Let us illustrate by taking Table XVI. On 16 January the
number 555 is shown to the agents in London. At the same time
235 persons in different parts of the country each guess a three figure
number. A certain proportion of the guesses registered will have
5 as the last figure, i.e. in the units place. What we wish to know
278 S. G. Soal [part
is : Is the proportion of 5's in the last place greater than it would
have been if the agents had not concentrated on any number at all ?
We can only test this by finding out what the proportion of 5's is
on an evening when the agents do not think of any three figure
number. But it is obviously better to take six such evenings and
pool the numbers obtained and so obtain a more truly representative
proportion than could be obtained from a single evening. Now
since the last figure may be 0, 1, 2, ... 9 there are altogether ten
groups, so that k= 10. We therefore count the numbers each week
which fall into each of these ten groups, and by pooling the six
weeks' contributions to each group we obtain ten larger groups.
The numbers nv n2 ,
... nl0 in these control groups are tabulated
opposite the corresponding digits in the second column of Table
XVI. The sum of the values in the ten groups, i.e. w1 + M2 + n3 + ...n10,
is equal to 1371, which is our N of the first set. The proportions
for each group fthat is the values of ^) are tabulated in the third
column.
Now our second set N1 consists of the 235 guesses obtained on
16 January, and in Col. 7, under the heading (16 January), are
tabulated the number of guesses which fall in each of the ten groups.
Thus iV1
= 235 and « 5
1 = 20. The proportions for each group, that
is the values of are tabulated in Col. 5 under this heading.
Thus #-£-0*5.
Col. 4 gives the values of the difference ~ -
^ for each group.
In this particular example it happens that the proportion
n i
6
1
N
•085 is actually less than the proportion ^ in the control
experiments, so that there can be no question of the concentration
of the agents having increased the proportion of 5's.
Still this is not always the case, and by examining the value of
Ys
2
in the last column we can see in the case of any digit whether
the difference in the two proportions is probably due to chance or
not. In this example we look in the last column opposite the
digit 5 and find F5
2
= 1-27.
This shows that F5 is considerably less than 2 and no significance
can be attached to the difference in proportions of the given experi-
ment and the control for this particular digit. But the same holds
good for each of the other digits, since each value of Ys
2
in the last
column is considerably less than 4. If, however, we wish to see
123] Experiments in Supernormal Perception 279
how the series for 16 January compares as a whole with the control
series (i.e. whether or not they can be regarded as two samples
drawn from a much larger series) we add up the values of Ys
2
in
the last column and thus obtain y
2
= 1\
2
+ Y. 2
+ Yz
2
+ ---^io
2
-
(f here = 8-61, with k =10.)
Turning now to the last two rows of Table XX, under the date
16 January we read #
2
= 8-61, Px
a = 47.
This must be interpreted to mean that if we made a pair of
control experiments employing no agents, and if in the first experi-
ment 1371 guesses were obtained and in the second only 235 guesses,
then if we kept on repeating this pair of experiments (taking care
that the batch of guesses and other general conditions did not vary)
we might expect to get a value of y
2
as large as or greater than
8-67 on the average about 47 times "in every 100 trials. In other
words the divergence of the series on 16 January from the combined
control series is so commonplace that it would be about even odds
that you would get a divergence as great on a single trial.
As explained on p. 247 tables similar to Table XVI were con-
structed for each three figure number experiment, separate tables
being made for the hundreds, tens and units digits.
To have published all these tables, 29 in number, would, however,
have been very expensive, and, moreover, unnecessary, since the only
vital part of each table is the last column giving the values of 1 3
2
for each digit.
I have thought it wise to give these last columns in full, since
obviously it was important to demonstrate that the experiments on
individual weeks really are close fits with the control series.
If the general fits had been bad we might have had to conclude
that mass preferences for numbers, capital letters, etc. were so
fluctuating and unreliable as to defy any attempts at statistical
evaluation. In such an event, of course, the controls would have
been useless.
The last columns of the 29 three figure number tables have been
collected under each date in Tables XVIII-XXI. From these
tables we can find the value of Y 2
for any digit in the hundreds,
tens or units places for each date on which the agents concentrated
on a three figure number. The sum of the numbers in each column
gives the value of %
2
, and under this is tabulated the corresponding
value of Px
2. In each column the value in heavy type is the value
of Y 2
corresponding to the special digit exhibited to the agents
on the date at the head of the column. Had there been any con-
siderable occurrence of mass telepathy a good proportion of these
heavy type values (considerably exceeding say 30 per cent.) would
have been greater than 4, whereas not even a single value in any of
the four tables even approaches 4.

It will be observed that no place in the scheme is allocated for an impression
bearing upon item (a) " His great pentecostal tongue," etc., or for a mention of
poetry or sleep. It must be inferred that no percipients mentioned any of these
items on 19 October. In every case the scheme for each object was amplified
and modified to meet the actual guesses made by the percipients. So that
when on examining the percipients' records a fresh guess arose which was
relevant to the object of the experiment, but unprovided for by the existing
tariff, an appropriate place was made for it in the scheme. In each case I
commenced with a skeleton scheme, which was gradually filled in as I read more
and more records.

containing a picture postcard (Zoo series) showing a kangaroo. The
envelope was posted together with an accompanying notice to reach
the agent as far as possible on 5 December. The envelope was
marked " To be opened at 10.0 p.m. in the presence of a witness."
The notice read as follows :
" Special experiment for 5 December
1928. For the first ten minutes, from 10.0-10.10 p.m., we are asking
you kindly to act this week as agent instead of percipient. Will
you therefore please keep the enclosed envelope in a safe place and
unopened till 10.0 p.m. on Wednesday, 5 December. It should then be
opened in the presence of a witness. Will you therefore concentrate
on the subject of the enclosure and from 10.0-10.10 p.m. try to
transmit instead of receive impressions. (A number of people in
different parts of the country will be concentrating on the same
subject.) At the end of ten minutes cease to concentrate and
continue recording impressions in the usual way for the rest of the
half hour. When sending your impressions will you also kindly
return the envelope in which you receive this, with the signature
of the witness as to the time when it was opened.

The following notice was sent out to all percipients : "Wednesday,
5 December 1928. Three different objects will be shown : 10.0 p.m.
Please record all impressions. 10.10 p.m. The second object will be
a number of three figures. Please give only the strongest impression.

tion. The scoring scheme in fact was in all cases amplified to meet the different
types of guesses that were met with in examining the percipients' records.
Had I come across such a combination as that mentioned above, a special
place in the scheme would have been arranged for it and the tariff thus
allocated applied to any other similar case that arose.

Could frame thy fearful symmetry ?

APPENDIX IV
(a) In the case of the 27 concrete objects I judged it unwise to
ask the percipients to record only a single impression for each
ten minute interval. It was obviously important that I should be
able to examine all the impressions they thought it worth while to
send me. On the other hand, for the purpose of scoring each
individual performance it was clearly essential that all percipients
should be put, as far as possible, on a common basis. Otherwise a
percipient who crowded a large number of impressions into the
ten minute interval would have an undue advantage over another
who made only a solitary guess.
There naturally arises the question as to what is to be considered
as a single impression. After some consideration it seemed that
the most natural unit to take was a visualisation or sensation. In
what follows I have taken as a distinct impression a group of objects
that appear to have been grasped by the percipient as a single mental
picture. For instance I have counted examples like the following
as single impressions, even though there may be more than one
object mentioned :
(a) Small branch of holly with red berries.
(b) High white peaks against a dark blue sky.
(c) An elephant wearing spectacles.
(d) Pricking sensation in right knee and arm.
In the majority of instances there was no difficulty in counting
in this scheme the number of distinct impressions recorded in each
ten minute period. A record like the following :
No. 509, 12 December—(i) A chubby child ;
a piano ; a melon
would be taken to comprise three distinct pictures or impressions.
In a small percentage of cases, however, the matter was not so
simple and I have had to use my judgment as to what constituted
a single impression. Such an example as " A stone archway which
afterwards changed into a bright horseshoe " I have generally
counted as two distinct guesses, since there seem to have been two
separate mental pictures.
350
[part 123] Experiments in Supernormal Perception 351
In cases where a percipient recorded more than one distinct
visualisation or sensation the following procedure was adopted for
the purpose of allocating the individual score. Two dice (one large,
one small) were shaken together in a bone cup. In the case where
the percipient gave two distinct visualisations or sensations in the
same ten minute interval the first of the two impressions was chosen
for scoring if the large die turned up an odd number. If the per-
cipient gave three distinct impressions in the ten minutes the first,
second or third was scored, according as the large die turned up a
number from the three pairs, 1,6; 2, 4 ; or 3, 5. In the case of
four impressions the first, second, third or last was scored, according
as the pair of dice showed the combinations Oo, Ee, Oe and Eo, the
letters 0, o referring to the odd faces of the large and small dice
respectively and the letters E, e to the even faces. In the case of
five or six impressions being given in the same ten minute interval
the impression chosen for scoring was determined by the number
turned up by the large die. In the case where there were two concrete
objects shown on the same evening a preliminary throw of the dice was
made for the purpose of deciding which of the two ten minute intervals
was to be chosen for scoring the object in question. When, however, a
correct impression was recorded in the same ten minute interval as that
in which the corresponding object was shown, this preliminary throw
toas dispensed with and the guess to be scored was chosen as explained
above from this same ten minute interval. This was done in con-
formity with my plan to give previsional or post impressions a
certain chance with the contemporary ones. Thus it might
happen that the two impressions chosen for scoring, although refer-
ring to different objects, were contained in the same ten minute
interval.
It must be clearly understood that the above scheme only applies
to the allocation of the individual numerical scores and that no
such restrictions of choice were made in constructing the Object
Tables XXXIII. In making these tables all the guesses ivere included
that occurred in the same ten minute interval. Moreover, in the
sections entitled " Further consideration of the 27 objects "
(p. 232)
and " A few typical impressions "
(p. 235) all guesses have been
taken into consideration in choosing the successes.
In view of the fact that all impressions recorded in the same
ten minutes were included in the object tables, it was necessary to
make some further investigations on the average number of im-
pressions recorded in a ten minute interval. There were altogether
with the whole 579 percipients 8784 ten minute intervals in which
impressions were recorded bearing on the 27 objects. The average
number of impressions noted per ten minute interval was 1-85.
The distribution of these numbers of visualisations is not at all of
352 S. G. Soal [part
the normal type. It is roughly indicated by the following per-
centages :
Number of impressions per Percentage number
ten minute interval. of intervals.
0 6-3%
1 44-3%
2 25-2%
3 12-2%
4 6-3%
5 3-0%
6 1-5%
Exceeding 6 impressions 1*1%
8784 = 100%
The tables showing the analysis for each individual percipient
have been preserved and may be examined by anyone wishing to
do so. The variability of the distribution, it will be seen, is very
wide (S.D. = l-4 approximately).
The average number of impressions per ten minute interval varies
considerably week by week. The highest is 2-48 on 13 February
and the lowest 1-49 on 16 January and 24 October (each date). As
regards the numbers given in the object tables, it will be obvious
that the average guessing chance per percipient is considerably
higher on say 13 February than it is on 24 October. It is therefore
necessary to reduce the actual numbers of percipients who took part
each week to the corresponding effective numbers as regards
guessing power. We have seen that the average number of impres-
sions per ten minute interval is 1-85. This is also the average for
the week 13 March. We may take the number of actual percipients
on 13 March (252) as our standard number and modify the remaining
actual numbers in a proportion varying with the average weekly
guessing power. We thus obtain the following table :

(b) Additional statistics.—I record here very briefly the results of
a few other counts I have made in connection with the 374 per-
cipients with possible scores ^ 300.
1. Average possible score for the 374 percipients =682
160 psychics =705
214 non-psychics = 665.
It will be seen that the psychics have done slightly more work
than the remainder of the group.
2. I have worked out the average number of visualisations per
ten minute interval for each of the 374 percipients on the object
intervals.
The mean average per percipient = 1-64.
The distribution of the 374 averages is of the normal type with a
certain skewness (S.D. = -85).
For the 160 psychics the mean of the averages is 1-97. There
seems definite evidence that on the whole the psychics tend to
give more impressions per ten minute interval than the remainder
of the group.
3. The average number of impressions (visualisations, auditions,
etc.) for the 374 percipients on the objects is 33-5 (S.D. = 20). For
the men the average is 33-2 (S.D. = 21).
For the 160 psychics the average is 38-0.
Again, we see that on the 27 objects the psychics appear to have
averaged more guesses than the remainder. This is a sign of keener
enthusiasm among those who claim to psychic powers.
(c) Explanation of tables.—These preference tables are based on
the 8784 ten minute intervals in which objects guesses were made,
the 2705 geometrical impressions selected for scoring, and the 2394
capital letter guesses.
Let us take first the Tables A-G. The numbers given in the second
column under the heading p = l in are obtained by dividing 8784
by the total number of times each item is mentioned by the 579
354 S. G. Soal [part
percipients. 1
It will of course be understood that if a percipient
mentioned the same item more than once in the same ten minute
interval his impression would only be counted once. If, however,
the percipient registered say " flowers " in two ten minute intervals
on the same evening, two impressions would be contributed to the
total count for Item 1 (flowers).
The number 18 in the second column opposite Item 1 for instance
gives the average chance of guessing any sort of flower or flowers
in a ten minute interval as 1/18.
This value 1/18, however, is merely that obtained by observing
the guesses of a limited number of people (579) spread over a limited
interval of time. To get the true value of p, the chance of guessing
a flower we should have to experiment with a whole population at
varying times of the year. The value p = 1/18 therefore can only
be considered as an approximation obtained from a sample of the
population. And even this sample may not be a truly representative
one. But assuming that it is a fairly representative sample we may
deduce from this observed value limits between which the true value
probably lies.
Let p be the observed chance (Column 2). Then if the true value
of p is p
1
the observed value p obtained from N observations will
not often lie outside the limits
IpHl-v1
)
p

±2<\J jy
'
* -6. ^±2 x standard deviation.
The limits for the true value are therefore the roots of the quadratic
{N + 4)(^)
2 - 2(pN + 2)p
l
+ Np* = 0.
If N is large (say 2000) a good approximation is given by
and from this formula with iV = 8784 the limits between which the
true value of p
1
for each item most probably lies have been calcu-
lated. These limits are given in Column 3.
In cases where the observed value of p is less than 1 in 1757 I
have thought it not worth while to give either the observed value
or the limits, as these would be too wide and inaccurate to be of any
value. A blank has therefore been left opposite items where p
works out to be less than 1/1757.
The above tables (A-G) are constructed on the assumption that
on an average each percipient makes 1-85 visualisations or sensations
1
In counting the number of mentions for any particular item in Table
XXXIII the numbers in italics are omitted since they correspond to stray
impressions recorded during a geometrical or three-figure test, etc.
123] Experiments in Supernormal Perception 355
per ten minute interval. If it is required to find what is the chance
of guessing any given item with a solitary visualisation there will
be no serious error if the limits in Column 3 are divided by 1-85.
In the case of Tables H and I the assumption is that each per-
cipient makes a solitary guess at a geometrical sketch or capital
letter, since where two guesses were made by a percipient only the
first was chosen.
The numbers given opposite each item in the last column under
the heading - 10 log10 p are intended to be used as scores for
successful guesses if this experiment is ever repeated, using the
objects given in the table and under similar conditions. Such a
system of scores, it is believed, will prove more rational than the
arbitrary system employed in the present experiment.
In conclusion, it should be borne in mind that the present tables
cannot be accepted in any sense as final. They represent merely
the best I have been able to do with the material at my disposal.
Many assumptions have been admitted as to the independence of
the different object guesses, but such assumptions are almost un-
avoidable under existing circumstances.
But even with these manifold limitations it is hoped that they will
enable future experimenters to give a rough estimate of the prob-
ability of an average person successfully guessing an object
concentrated on by an agent.

THE PSYCHOLOGY OF TESTIMONY IN RELATION TO
PARAPHYSICAL PHENOMENA : REPORT OF AN EX-
PERIMENT 1
By Theodore Besterman
Experiments in the psychology of testimony were initiated by
Binet.2
With a view to obtaining data illustrative of individual
psychological differences and of psychological types he submitted
groups of children and young people to simple tests. For instance,
he displayed a picture for two minutes and then asked for a descrip-
tion of it. Valuable work was also done by Claparede and his
pupils,3
but in recent years the most important researches in this
field have been done in Germany, largely under the inspiration of
Professor William Stern and of the Beitrdge zur Psychologie der
Aussage founded by him.4
The investigation has been given a
strong legal bias, the primary object of the experiments being to
inquire into the validity of testimony given in proceedings at law,
particularly in criminal cases. A typical experiment is that con-
ducted in Professor Stern's criminological seminary in Berlin.
During the course of a discussion two of the participators, by private
arrangement, simulated a violent quarrel. The witnesses were then
asked to draw up reports of what they had seen, with a view to
giving evidence in court. 5
It is to be noted that the object of such
experiments is not to test vision, perception generally, memory,
observation, etc., but rather the complex of all these and other
elements which go to make up the reporting of an experienced fact,
in short, the giving of testimony. To achieve this the investigator
reproduces as closely as possible the sort of event into the testimony
concerning which he is inquiring, and then studies the reports
obtained of this event.

this experiment would not have been carried out ; and to Miss Jephson, for

All these experiments were to some extent anticipated by psychi-
cal research, in which the problem of the value of testimony was
naturally one of the first to be considered. Mr S. J. Davey, an
amateur conjuror, gave performances in slate-writing in imitation
of those given by the medium William Eglinton, and succeeded in
convincing many sitters that they had witnessed supernormal pheno-
mena.1
It was a valuable beginning, but curiously enough no
further work on these lines has been done since that date (1886).
I had therefore for some years been anxious to make some
investigations into testimony in relation to paraphysical phenomena
generally. I made a beginning in June 1928, taking advantage of
the presence in London of a self-avowed fraudulent medium.2
It was
arranged for this medium to go through his usual performance in the
Society's seance-room. Five sitters were invited, three of whom
were left under the impression that they were to witness a genuine
sitting. This is the ideal form in which an experiment of this kind
should be conducted, since only thus can the conditions of an
ordinary sitting be reproduced subjectively as well as objectively.
I was also anxious to test such points as the effect of fatigue in a
long sitting and of progressive familiarity with certain phenomena
in a series of sittings. It soon became clear, however, that on those
lines it would be impossible to carry out the experiment on a suffi-
ciently large scale. Eventually, in October 1931, the following letter
was sent by Mrs Salter to a selected list of members of the Society :
" With the approval of the Council a series of experimental
sittings is shortly to be held in the Society's seance-room for the
purpose of investigating the most favourable conditions for observa-
tion in sittings for physical phenomena. It is proposed for this
purpose to reproduce the conditions of an average sitting and to
cause a few simple phenomena to take place by normal means.
The sitters will then be asked to fill up a short questionnaire dealing
with the events of the sitting. It is hoped to obtain in this way
valuable material bearing on the conduct of sittings for physical
phenomena.
"Will you kindly let me know whether you are willing to participate
in this experiment by attending one of the sittings ? This would
take up only an hour or so of your time. Your name will not be
published without your consent. I shall be happy to send you,
on request, any further information you may like to have."
A sufficient number of members agreed to take part and six
sittings were accordingly arranged, in which forty-two sitters took

part, each attending one sitting. The procedure was exactly the
same at each sitting, with one accidental exception noted below.
The time-table follows.

The sitters were shown to their seats in the seance-room, which was
arranged as shown in the accompanying plan, and the " medium "
took her place. 1
I then said,
0.0 " The sitting has now begun," closed the door with a bang,
and switched off the bright wall-light, leaving full on the central

ceiling white and red lights. Moving to the " medium's " table
and standing by it I said, " There is really very little to explain.
A few simple phenomena will be gone through and you will after-
wards be asked to answer some questions about them. These
questions will relate only to facts and not to interpretations, so that
you needn't worry how anything happens, but only try and observe
carefully what happens. The lady in the medium's chair is not of
course a real medium, but a Member of the Society who is kindly
taking the part. I will now show you what lighting we have."
On this I sat down and slowly reduced, extinguished, and put on
again, by means of the rheostat, the white and red ceiling lights.
Immediately after
0.2 I switched on the gramophone and said, " You are of course
quite at liberty to talk as much as you please."
0.7 I switched off the gramophone.
0.10 There was a knock on the outside of the door. I rose and
went to the door. As I put my hand on the handle of the door
to open it, the " medium " put out her right hand and moved the
bell from its first position (as shown on the plan) to the other end
of the table, behind the tambourine (as shown on the photograph).
When this was done I had begun to open the door, which I then
opened wide, leaving the room and at once returning, putting a
white card (5x3 in.) in my pocket. On returning I sat down and
at once put out all the lights and re-started the gramophone. In
the darkness I said, " You will see that all the objects on the table
are luminous." Then the " medium " removed the drumstick
which lay on the table at her left and placed it in the opening of
the curtains just over and behind her head ; moved the bell back to
its original position ;
pinned a prepared cloth over her face ; and
took the trumpet in her hand. Unfortunately the larger opening
of the trumpet then pointed by an oversight at some sittings to
the " medium's " left and at others to her right. No account is
therefore taken of this point in the scoring.
0.15 I said, " I ought to warn you that in a few minutes I shall
make a flashlight exposure, so please observe everything as closely
as you can during the flash. I will give you another warning
immediately before the flash." At the same time I put on a dim
red light, which threw an appreciable amount of red light on the
ceiling but gave no visibility below.
0.19 I stopped the gramophone, said, " I'm now going to make
the flash," and did so, immediately thereafter starting the gramo-
phone again. The " medium " then replaced the trumpet in its
original position and hid the drumstick and cloth.
0.24 I stopped the gramophone, put on the red and white lights
in turn, left them on for a minute, and said.

0. 25 " That's the end of the sitting, thank you. If you will now-
kindly follow me into another room there is a sheet with a few
questions for you to answer." The sitters were accordingly shown
into Miss Newton's room, where they completed the questionnaire in
silence.
This questionnaire now follows, each question being followed by
the correct answer and, in round brackets, by the marks obtainable :

1. Describe the position of your chair. [This varied from sitting
to sitting ; the chairs were arranged in two rows, one behind the
other, with 3-5 chairs in each row. A typical reply would be
" second from the left, back row."] (10).
2. How many persons were in the seance-mom during the sitting ?
[The correct answer ranges from seven to eleven.] (20 ; a mistake
of one : 10).
3. Early in the sitting there was a disturbance. Describe what
happened. There was a knock at the door (10), Th. B. went to the
door (10), opened it (5) wide (5), went out (10), and returned to his
seat (10), putting a white card in his pocket (30). Total (80).
4. Give a list of the articles lying on the table at the beginning of
the sitting, in their order from left to right. Xylophone,1
bell,
drumstick, zither, drumstick, tambourine, trumpet. (10 for each
article, if sufficiently described or drawn, plus 10 if it is given in its
correct position. Total 140.)
5. Early in the sitting the " medium " touched an article lying
on the table. What was the article ? The bell (10).
6. With what hand did the " medium " touch it ? The right
hand (10).
7. What light was there at the time ? Medium (10) white light
(10). Total (20).
8. Was there silence at the time ? Yes (10).
9. During the sitting a flashlight photograph of the " medium "
was taken. What interval of time had elapsed since the beginning
of the sitting ? Nineteen minutes (for 18-20 minutes, 20 ; for
16-22 minutes, 10 ; for a time such as 20-30 minutes, one member
of which falls within 16-22 minutes, 5).
10. State in full detail what you saw during the flash, in other
words, everything that will appear on the photograph. The
medium's face was covered with a white cloth (10) on which could be
seen the marks of horizontal and vertical folding (10), as well as thick
1

bars.

black markings forming the rudimentary (10) design of a face (10) in
profile (10). The objects on the table were as stated in reply to ques-
tion 4, with the following exceptions : the bell (10) was in the position
behind the tambourine (10) to -which it had been moved earlier in the
sitting (see question 5) ; the trumpet (10) was now held horizontally
(5) in the medium's hand (5) ; and the second drumstick had vanished.
(10). What seemed to be the head of this drumstick (10) appeared in
the opening of the curtains above the medium's head (20). Total (130).
11. What light was there immediately before the flash ? Faint
(10) red light (10), but no visibility (20). Total (40).
12. What light was there immediately after the flash ? Faint (10)
red light (10), but no visibility (20). Total (40).
13. Was there silence at the time of the flash ? Yes (10).
14. Give a list of the articles lying on the table at the end of the
sitting, in their order from left to right. The same as in reply to
question 4, except that the second drumstick was still missing. (As
before, the second drumstick scoring 20 if reported as missing ;
sitters who said " The same as in reply to question 4," were given
the same marks as they obtained in the earlier question, so far as
consistent with the disappearance of the second dramstick ; total
140.)
15. Add anything you wish, especially particulars of any incidents
or phenomena not mentioned in the above questions. (No addi-
tional marks ;
grand total 680.)
It will be seen that the questionnaire combines the method of
direct questions with that of spontaneous narrative. The object of
this was partly to compare the two methods, but no significant
results were obtained, except in so far as the notion now generally
accepted by psychologists that spontaneous narrative gives better
results than cross-examination was not supported by the results.
In particular, as I was anxious to give the sitter every possible
advantage, apart from testing the opinion just mentioned, I added
Question 15 with a view to giving sitters full credit for any correct
testimony given in this way, supplementing or correcting previous
answers. But in the case of only one sitter was there any need to
do so. On the other hand, since the questions were all simple and
straightforward and related to actual facts or occurrences, there was
little room for the free play of imagination, etc., in replying to them.
In this connection also Question 15 was of importance, for it was
here that most of the sitters' illusions came to light. We will return
to these later.
It must be noted also that neither in the sitting nor in the ques-
tions was any experiment made with such misleading suggestions as
fraudulent physical mediums often know how to use. There was a
single exception, my remark that all the objects on the table were
124] The Psyihihjy jf Testimony 339
luminous, which was not true of the two drumsticks. There is no
clear evidence in the replies given that this false suggestion affected
the testimony. In any case, it must be remembered that all the
objects on the table were in full sight in medium white light for ten
minutes at the beginning of the sitting, and also during the flash
and for a minute in medium white light at the end of the sitting.
Further, partly because it was not found possible to get the lumino-
sity of the articles on the table uniform from sitting to sitting and
from the angle of vision of each sitter, no questions were asked
relating to anything that occurred hi the dark. Sitters who wanted
to take notes were allowed to do so, but they were so few that no
distinctions have been made in the scoring and analysis.
It is only necessary to add at this point that the scoring was all
done with a definite bias in favour of the sitter, who was always
given the benefit of the doubt. Thus, credit was given, though not,
of course, full credit, if a reply implied even indirectly a correct
answer to another question. For instance, this was done if a sitter
did not mention the trumpet in reply to Question 4, but later said
" The medium took the trumpet from the table."
The method of scoring is far from perfect, but it is at any rate an
improvement on the usual method of psychologists in experiments
of this kind. They treat replies simply as right or wrong : a method
which fails to distinguish between the important and unimportant
elements of an event. My method was of course worked out before
the answers of the questionnaire came into my hands.
The complete results are given in Table I, each sitter being given
a number in the alphabetical order of his name.
It will be seen from Table I that the sitters' testimony was correct
in proportions ranging from 5-9% to 61%, averaging 33-9%. In
other words, the 42 sitters as a whole gave correct testimony to the
extent of only one-third. Only one sitter (no. 42, ranked seventh)
obtained some success in reply to every question. Two sitters
(nos. 4 and 6) secured marks in reply to only three questions. On
the other hand, there was only one point that every sitter failed to
report, though it transpired in conversation after the sittings that
several had actually observed it. This was the drumstick-head over
the " medium's " head during the flash. The absence of references
to this is all the more surprising since, as can be seen from the
photograph, it was brilliantly illuminated by the flash and was
missing from the table after it.

NOS. OF SITTERS.
In the last column but one is shown the rank of the sitters, in the
order of their total scores. It will be seen that only seven sitters
obtained more than half marks, and that fourteen sitters obtained
a quarter of the total marks or less. The sharp curve of the scores
when set out in graphical form shows the wide range between the
worst and best sitters ; while its smoothness strongly suggests the
absence of any mode, i.e. that there is no such thing as a typical
sitter. It must be noted that the sitters who obtained the biggest
scores, and therefore rank highest, are not necessarily the best
sitters. This is because it was necessary under the circumstances
to concentrate both the phenomena and the questions on the visual
aspects of the sitting, the most important in a sitting for para-
physical phenomena. The replies suggest that in an all round test
sitter no. 7 might come into her own.
124] The Psychology of Testimony 373
Table I can be analysed, for our purpose, from two points of view,
with reference to the classes of sitters and with reference to the
types of phenomena. Let us consider the latter first.
The replies to Question 1 obtained an average score of 8 (80%
of full marks). The chief fault in the replies is lack of precision.
This is illustrated by such replies as "In the centre " (for the
second of four chairs), " In the front row," etc. On the whole the
sitters were more successful with this question than with any other.
Question 2 provided a surprise. Although the number of persons
in the seance-room never exceeded eleven, the scores obtained
average only 14-6 (73%). Only twenty-six sitters answered
correctly. Four gave no effective answer. The amount of error of
the remaining sitters is shown in Table II.
Table II
The Amount of Error in the Inaccurate Eeplies to
Question 2.
No. of Amount of No. of Amount of No. of Amount of
Sitter. Error. Sitter. Error. Sitter. Error.
1 -3 15 - 3 or - 1 26 -1
3 -1 17 -1 31 + 2
11 + 1 23 -1 35 -1
12 -1 25 -1 39 + 1
It thus appears that there was a slight tendency to underrate the
number of persons present in the seance-room.
With the replies to Question 3 we begin to find the more serious
flaws in the sitters' testimony. The complete scores are shown in
Table III (p. 374).
This Table reveals some interesting points. Of the 42 sitters
11 failed to give any account of the disturbance. The remaining
31 report more or less accurately its earliest stage, the knock on the
door. But of these 31 sitters five do not mention the fact that I
went to the door, 13 do not report the opening of the door, 21 do
not refer to my leaving the seance-room, and only four sitters report
the crucial point of the performance, the fact that I put something
into my pocket on returning. And in connection with these four
sitters it is important to note a point that is not brought out by
the scoring. Two of these sitters attended the third sitting and
two the sixth. On each occasion I noted that one sitter took pains
to follow my actions, being observed in this, and imitated, by one
other sitter. No sitter reports correctly what it was I put into my
pocket, though one gets very near it. The most unexpected result,
374 Theodore Besterman [part
however, is that no sitter reports the fact that I opened the door
wide, although in doing so I admitted a good deal of additional light
into the seance-room. The highest marks for the question as a whole
are obtained by nos. 12 and 29 (ranking 19th and 12th) with 60
marks (70%). The average score for all the sitters is 21-3, equi-
valent to 26-6% of the possible score of 80.

We may take next the replies to Question 5, as the movement of
the bell took place during part of the disturbance just analysed.
The answers to this question could be only right or wrong. In
three cases, however, the sitter has been given five marks because
he indicates the bell with reasonable accuracy but describes it
inadequately. Apart from these three sitters there are 18 correct
answers, while 21 sitters give wrong answers or fail to reply. The
average score is thus 4-6 (46%). Since the bell was moved in good
light and in full sight of the sitters, this result is poor. The pheno-
mena dealt with in Questions 3 and 5 were arranged in such a way
that the sitters could witness both : the moving of the bell occupied
only the time it took me to turn the handle and begin to open the
door. And in fact there is no significant correlation between failure
in Question 3 and success in Question 5. Of the 11 persons who
completely fail in replying to the former question eight also fail in
the latter. Of the 21 sitters who answer Question 5 more or less
correctly, 18 also obtain some success in Question 3.
A comparison of the replies to Question 5 with those to Question 6
yields a surprising result. Of the 21 sitters who more or less accu-
rately report the movements of the bell, only seven, or one-third,
were able to say with which hand the medium had moved it. On
the other hand, three sitters correctly report the hand, but fail in
regard to the object moved. So that only 10 sitters were able to
testify correctly to a deliberate and pronounced movement of the
arm made in good light. The average score is 2-4 (24%).
The objects lying on the " medium's " table are dealt with in
Questions 4 and 14. The details of the replies to these are set out
in Tables IV and V.

These Tables show that the degree of accuracy of the sitters'
reports as between the different objects is governed chiefly by their
size. The biggest of them is the trumpet (when erect on the table),
which obtains 64% of the possible marks ; the next biggest is the
tambourine, and this comes second in the scoring also, with 56% ;
the two smallest objects, the drumsticks, obtained the lowest
scores. The drawing of the sitters' special attention to the bell
by the " medium's " movement of it also influenced the sitters'
reports. Hence the bell, which would have been expected by size
alone to rank after the xylophone and the zither, actually comes
third, with 47%. Finally, the position of the objects apparently
influenced the reports. By size alone the xylophone and zither
might have been expected to obtain about the same score, and the
two drumsticks (in Question 4 only) exactly the same score. Actually
the xylophone obtains 41% of the possible marks against the
zither's 35%, while the first drumstick scores 25% against the 16%
of the second one (in Question 4 only). Both these results illustrate
the tendency (in the Western world) to read from left to right.
124] The Psychology of Testimony :!7<)
A comparison of Tables IV and V does not yield much of interest.
Two tendencies might have been expected in the replies to Question
14 as compared with those to Question 4 : on the one hand, improved
results owing to the further opportunities for observation and to
the fact, when answering the questionnaire, that the objects had
been seen more recently in their final state ;
and, on the other hand,
worse results owing to fatigue. These two tendencies, if present,
appear more or less to have cancelled each other out. Apart from
the second drumstick there is no significant difference between the
two sets of replies. It will be seen that the absence of the second
drumstick at the eud of the sitting was reported by only five sitters.
The highest scores obtained by the replies to Question 4 are 135
(96-4%) and 130 (92-9%), earned respectively by nos. 30 and 32
(ranked 5th and 3rd). In Question 14 the highest scores are 130
(92-9%) and 120 (85-8%), obtained respectively by nos. 32 and 26
(ranked 3rd and 2nd). For both questions together the highest
scores are 260 (92-9%), obtained by no. 32 (ranked 3rd), and 250
(89%), obtained by no. 30 (ranked 5th).
There are three questions (7, 11 and 12) relating to the important
matter of visibility. These may conveniently be taken together.
In scoring the replies I have borne in mind that we are concerned
here with a problem in psychical research and not primarily with
one in psychology. Hence the greater emphasis laid on the report-
ing of the degree of visibility as against the actual amount of light.
The replies are set out in Table VII (p. 380).
It thus appears that only 16 sitters obtain marks in Question 7,
of whom only two earn full marks. The figures improve consider-
ably for the much easier Question 11, in which such a reply as
" Complete darkness " earns half the possible marks. Even here,
however, the average score is only 17-7 out of 40 (44-2%). The
replies to Question 12 show, as was to be expected, that after the
flash the conditions of light were less accurately reported ; in this
question (though such a reply as " The same as before " earns the
full marks obtained in the previous question), only 23-7% of success
was obtained. It is interesting to note that of the three sitters who
obtained full marks for Question 11, two were quite unsuccessful
in Question 12. No sitter obtained full marks for all three ques-
tions. The best reply, that is, the one most nearly approaching
accuracy in all three questions, is that of no. 24 (ranked 20th). It
would have been interesting to investigate the direction in which
sitters tend to err in reporting conditions of light, but this was
impossible in such a short sitting.
Conditions of hearing were tested by Questions 8 and 13. The
gramophone played continuously from 0.2 to 0.24, with the exception
of one period of over three minutes, during which came the

This result is rather surprising. The question relating to the
period of silence of three seconds is more than twice as successfully
answered as that relating to the period of over three minutes.
The former period, it is true, was more sharply defined and the
sitters were more definitely on the qui vive owing to the warning
given just before. But the stopping of the gramophone was partly
masked by the sound of the flash, almost immediately after which
the music was started again. While the termination, at any rate,
of the longer period, was also strongly marked by the simultan-
eous complete turning out of the lights. And in any case the
outstanding fact is that the less successful period was 60 times
longer than the more successful one. It seems difficult to find an
adequate explanation of the marked superiority of the replies to
Question 13.
In Question 9 the sitters were asked what interval of time had
elapsed between the beginning of the sitting and the flash. Both
points were very distinctly marked : the beginning by my statement
that the sitting had now begun, by the banging of the door, the
switching off of the wall light, and the starting of the gramophone ;
the end, of course, by the flash. Yet, the actual time being 19
minutes, the replies obtained were as shown in Table IX.

The average estimate of the 35 sitters who replied effectively is
18-5 minutes, a close approximation to the correct time. But this
close approximation is not due to a general but small degree of
error. On the contrary, the average score obtained by all the
124] The Psychology of Testimony 383
sitters in reply to this question is 3-5, a percentage of only 17-5 of
full marks. In fact, the replies range from 5 to 40 minutes.
There is thus both a tendency greatly to underrate and greatly to
exaggerate, these tendencies cancelling each other out. No sitter
gave the correct time, but the reply of no. 27 (ranked 4th), who
gave 18-20 minutes, is practically correct. This sitter was the only
one who hit upon the obvious method of calculating the passage
of time by counting the number of times the gramophone record
was played. For the method of awarding marks, see the Question-
naire above. Full marks were obtained by only six sitters, even
though the nearest round figure, 20 minutes, fell into this period.
Contrary to expectation the most popular figure was easily 15
minutes, and not the nearest round number. The ten marks given
for a reply falling within 16-22 minutes were earned by only one
sitter.
Finally, we have the sitters' reports (in reply to Question 10)
of the scene photographed at the moment of the flash (see the
accompanying plate). The replies are set out in Table X (p. 384).
The replies to this question are the worst of all. A fair number
of sitters report the presence over the " medium's " face of a
white cloth or paper ; a few also mention the marks of folding
on it ; but beyond this there is very little success. The presence of
a design on the cloth, the nature of that design, the changes on the
table, all these remain substantially unreported. The disappearance
of the second drumstick from the table is reported by only one sitter,
while the presence of the head of this drumstick in the curtain over
the " medium's " head is not mentioned by a single one. Yet it
formed a brilliant circular white disc, 21 mm. in diameter (see
photograph). It must also be remembered that the flash was not
made unexpectedly : two warnings were given and the sitters were
particularly asked to observe carefully during the flash. Further,
the flash itself was of longer duration and brighter than is usual in
normal photographic work. It was produced by the fusing of a
length of -008" (no. 33, Birmingham wire gauge) pure aluminium
wire, in the Society's electrical flashlight apparatus.
Let us now turn to a brief consideration of the sitters themselves.
A total of 42 sitters does not justify us in going into great detail,
but we may compare the results obtained by a few obvious groups.
Thus the scores of men and women have been compared and so have
those of Spiritualists and non-Spiritualists. In neither case has any
significant difference been found. No comparison could be made
between age-groups, as most of the sitters were middle-aged. In
Table XI are compared the results obtained by sitters with previous
experience of physical phenomena and inexperienced sitters. The
figures would be suggestive if the numbers were larger. As it is

Thirteen sitters experienced illusions of one kind or another. In
view of the small number of cases involved I here use the term
" illusion " to include all such phenomena, ranging from extreme
instances of mal-observation to true hallucinations.
Sitter no. 1 reports both the bell and the trumpet as bottles.
No. 17 three times describes the bell as a glass bottle, but finally
writes of a " bottle which now appeared opaque and like a hand
bell." No. 42 twice refers to the bell as a glass of water, but finally
writes of " a bell in place of the original glass of water." In this
last case the illusion was so persuasive as to resist retrospectively
even the final recognition of the object for what it actually was.
No. 10 twice refers to a candle on the table, presumably for the
trumpet, which was, however, 13| inches in height. No. 33 refers
to a " tray of pens " on the table, no doubt for the xylophone.
Two sitters, nos. 17 and 37, report holes in the cloth over the
" medium's " face.
No. 20 writes that he saw the xylophone " glowing with a pink
colour for some time." No. 39 reports that " a small, narrow,
vertical light . . . seemed to hang vertically in the air." The same
sitter adds a description of the coloured lights she usually sees in the
dark.
Sitter no. 16 heard " a slight noise which appeared to come from
behind the curtain." No. 17 writes that " There was a bang on the
wall [the knock on the door ?] and later a noise behind the gramo-
phone." No 25 reports that " Two raps were heard on ceiling, the
first louder than the second—both sounded metallic in quality."
No. 38 twice states that I spoke at the door on answering it.
Finally, there is an interesting series of illusions of movement.
Sitter no. 12 writes, " Immediately after the flashlight photograph
four objects jerked up and down twice, not in parallel pattern, but
in zig-zag pattern, the ends of the objects nearer to each other being
386 Theodore Beslerman [part
depressed simultaneously." No. 20 reports that " The whole of
the articles on the table appeared to move slightly before the flash,
but always in a block, i.e., they did not change their relative
positions." One or two passages from the answers of no. 26 (a
psychologist, ranked 4th) are worth quoting in full. In reply to
Question 10 he writes :
" The table in front of the medium seemed
not to be in the same position but higher from the floor than before,
i.e., higher up or nearer to the medium's head . . . than at the
beginning of the session. The table seemed inclined so that the
edge nearest to the figure was higher than the edge nearest to the
audience. I have however the impression that this was an optical
illusion due to the sudden alteration of the light." In reply to
Question 15 this sitter writes in part :
" The '
lights '
from the right
hand percussion instrument with slats [this is intended for the
zither] were obscured by an opaque object moving between it and
my eyes. I only noticed this once. Twice I thought the table
swayed from right to left and back." No. 38 twice reports a slight
movement of the table or " medium's " chair. No. 39 writes that
" the table appeared to shake."
Table XII compares the 13 sitters who experienced illusions with
the remaining sitters. The result is rather surprising, but again
inconclusive because of the small number of sitters.

1 . There is a slight tendency to underrate the number of persons
present at a sitting.
2. Sitters largely ignore disturbances that appear to be irrelevant
to the sitting.
3. Sitters are to a considerable extent unable to report with which
hand a movement has been performed.
4. The degree to which sitters correctly report the objects used in
a sitting is primarily governed, apart from special circumstances,
by the size of these objects.
5. Sitters are able only to a very limited extent to report under
what conditions of visibility a phenomenon took place.
6. Sitters' reports of auditory conditions at the time of a pheno-
menon are untrustworthy and erratic.
7. There is a tendency greatly to underrate and greatly to
exaggerate a short period of time.
8. Sitters are almost entirely unable to report correctly the scene
revealed by a flash.
9. Of the illusions that occur the most extreme are those of
movement.
THE HISTORY OF GEORGE VALIANTINE 1
By Mrs W. H. Salter
George Valiantine is held by those who accept his phenomena as
genuine to be a remarkable example of " direct voice " or trumpet
mediumship. It is claimed that in the presence of certain specially
endowed persons, of whom Valiantine is one, communicating spirits
are able to speak in their own recognisable voices ; the power
whereby they do this is derived from the medium, but his vocal
organs are not brought into play ; the voice we hear is the voice of
the spirit. The purpose of the trumpet which usually figures in
records of this phenomenon is to increase the power of these spirit-
voices, which might otherwise be inaudible.
I do not propose to discuss the evidence for the " direct voice
"
in a general way ; I will only mention that this particular pheno-
menon appears to have become much more frequent in recent years,
although a claim for its occurrence was made at least as far back as
1872 in the case of Stainton Moses.
Turning now to Valiantine—we may consider his mediumship in
two aspects, physical and mental ; on the physical side is it possible
to substantiate his claim to supernormal powers as shown by direct
voices and telekinetic movements of the trumpet, which is said to be
wafted about the room without any human agency ; on the mental
side is there anything in the content of the words uttered by the
spirit-voices which seems to give evidence of knowledge supernor-
mally acquired ? It will not always be convenient to keep these two
threads absolutely distinct, but so far as possible I propose to dis-
entangle them and to consider the physical aspect first.
I should perhaps at this point meet the possible objection that in
devoting time and attention to a medium whom some may think to
be so thoroughly discredited as Valiantine, I am beating a dead horse,
which in one of the famous Margery-Valiantine cross-correspondences
we are told that no one ever stops to do. To that objection I have
two answers to make :
(1) even those who are ready to dismiss all
Valiantine's claims to genuine mediumship may derive pleasure and
profit, as I have done myself, from a study of the psychological
aspects of the case ; (2) the discrediting of Valiantine is by no means
complete. In a review of Mr Dennis Bradley's book And After in
the Times Literary Supplement (22 October 1931, p. 815) the writer,
while accepting Mr Bradley's " conclusive demonstration " of fraud,
1
Read at a Private Meeting of the Society, 30 December 1931.
2d 389
390 Mrs W. H. Salter [part
speaks of the " evidence of Valiantine's supernormal faculties which,
no sceptic, as it seems to us, can reasonably call in question." The
reviewer's identity is unknown to me, but the Literary Supplement
is a paper of good standing, in no way pledged to a belief in psychical
phenomena ;
many readers will therefore be inclined to accept its
verdict as justifying them in the conclusion that Valiantine is still
among the great mediums of the day.
I do not claim to have made an exhaustive study of the records of
Valiantine's mediumship ; he appears to have been well known for
some years in America (his native land) before he came much to the
notice of any one in this country. The earliest record I propose to
quote is of some test-sittings which took place in 1923 under the
auspices of The Scientific American. The persons responsible for the
conduct of these sittings were Dr Walter Prince, Dr Hereward Car-
rington, and the famous conjurer Houdini, Mr Malcolm Bird, then
of the Scientific American and afterwards of the American Society
for Psychical Research, being associated with them. I have not seen
the full report published in The Scientific American, but the following
abstract appeared in the Journal of the A.S.P.R. (1923), xvii. 586 :
" In the columns of the magazine which had the tests in charge a
full account of the results may be found, and only the briefest sum-
mary is necessary here. At the final sitting on May 26th, special
apparatus were installed. There was an electrical connection with
the chair in which the medium sat, so arranged that it ceased the
moment his body was lifted from it, whereupon a light in an ad-
joining room went out. There was also a dictograph, and steno-
graphers in the adjoining room took down all that was uttered and
also established the relation in point of time between the acts of the
supposed spirits and the periods when the lights vanished. It was
determined that the medium left his chair fifteen times, sometimes
for as long as eighteen seconds, and that these periods corresponded
with those when persons present were touched at a distance from the
chair. The subsequent claim of the medium that it was the shifting
of his body in the chair which caused the light to go out will be seen
to be ludicrous by anyone who will try shifting in such a manner as
to relieve the chair of his weight for eighteen seconds by the watch."
It is clear from this statement that there was in the opinion of
these investigators a strong presumption at least of fraud, and a
point to which I wish specially to call attention is that it is not
possible to maintain, as Mr Bradley tries to do, that Valiantine pur-
sued a path of strict, blameless rectitude for many years and has only
recently been led astray by the excessive adulation and generosity
of his supporters. As long ago as 1923, perhaps longer, Valiantine's
phenomena were suspect and they have been suspect on more than
one occasion since.
125] The History of George Valiantine 391
It was in the same year, 1923, that Mr Bradley, still one of the
principal witnesses for the defence of Valiantine in spite of his own
recent disclosures, had his first sitting at the house of Mr De Wyckoff
Arlena Towers, New Jersey. If any of my readers are inclined to
think that in anything I say here I am a little hard on Mr Bradley,
I would remind them that he has not minced his own words. He has
publicly accused the Officers of this Society of every sort and kind
of crass incompetence, and that after all is a game that two can play
at ! Of the personal evidence Mr Bradley believes himself to have
obtained through Valiantine I shall not say much, partly because it
is so inadequately recorded that its value cannot be properly esti-
mated, but I will refer briefly to a passage from the report of his first
sitting (Toivards the Stars, p. 8) for the light it throws on Mr Bradley's
mentality and his claim to be a critical observer. After describing
how he came to attend the sitting at Mr De Wyckoff's invitation, and
emphasising his own scepticism in regard to anything that was likely
to occur, he tells us that a woman's voice addressed him, saying, " I
love you I, love you " ; this voice gave the name Annie and claimed
to be his sister. Upon this evidence Mr Bradley at once accepted the
communicator's identity, and a long and intimate conversation
followed, of which no details are given.
Now this was Mr Bradley's first contact with the medium and it
should therefore have been obvious to any competent investigator
that it was essential to record accurately everything that was said
on either side. And yet what do we find % Mr Bradley had fifteen
minutes' conversation with a voice claiming to be his sister, and all
he tells us of what took place is that the conversation was of things
which only these two could have known and they were " things of
wondrous joy." How completely Mr Bradley gave himself away in
that fifteen minutes is left to our imagination and a sceptic can
hardly be blamed if he suspects the worst. We may also note that
although Mr Bradley subsequently tells us that his sister had a dis-
tinctive voice and manner of speech which were accurately repro-
duced at the sitting, he did not recognise the voice until the name
Annie was given ; he searched his memory and " could find no clue."
Mr Bradley's identification of the voice would have been more im-
pressive if it had been immediate.
The resemblance of the voices heard at Valiantine' s sittings to
those of the communicators purporting to be present is a point often
insisted on by Mr Bradley and others. I think it likely that an im-
portant part is played here by suggestion, helped out by the distor-
tion and indistinctness of utterance consequent on the use of a
trumpet, and I am strengthened in this belief by the ^observation of
two experienced investigators, Una, Lady Troubridge and Miss
Kadclyffe Hall (see below, p. 407).
392 Mrs W. H. Salter [part
A few months after this series of sittings at Arlena Towers Vali-
antine seems to have been detected in fraud by Mr De Wyckoff him-
self. An account of this episode is given in Toivards the Stars, p. Ill :
Valiantine brought Mr De Wyckoff some notes alleged to be the
" direct writing " of Bert Everett and Dr Barnett, two of his habitual
Controls, and relating to a suggested visit by Valiantine and Mr De
Wyckoff to Guiana. These notes were submitted to a handwriting
expert together with a specimen of Valiantine's own writing, and he
pronounced them to be by Valiantine's own hand. Valiantine denied
this accusation and Mr De Wyckoff said he would give him another
chance. A test-sitting was held at Arlena Towers at which Valian-
tine was tied up with a rope ; no phenomena occurred. Mr Bradley
dismisses this episode as of no importance, but the reasons for this
seem to lie in his own prejudice rather than in the facts of the case.
In the following year, 1924, Valiantine came to England and gave
a series of sittings at Mr Bradley's house, Dorincourt. Various
members of Mr Bradley's family and a number of his friends took
part in these sittings, which he describes in Toivards the Stars. Little
or no attempt was made to impose any control on the medium and
the records are again inadequate. I shall not therefore discuss them,
except for one curious episode of which I shall have something to say
later.
In 1925 Valiantine was again in England and the Society tried to
arrange for a series of test-sittings in our own seance-room. This
plan fell through largely owing to the attitude taken up by Mr
Bradley (for an account see Dr Woolley's report in Proceedings,
xxxvi. 52, 53). A few sittings, however, were held at Dorincourt at
which representatives of the Society were present. These sittings
are described by Lady Troubridge and Miss Radclyffe Hall in Pro-
ceedings, xxxvi, and I shall discuss their report later. For the
moment it will be convenient to turn to a series of sittings held in
1929 in Berlin. I take these German sittings out of their order in
time because I want to refer to some observations made at Berlin in
discussing a point raised by Lady Troubridge.
The report of the Berlin investigations is not to my mind very
satisfactory or conclusive (I can well imagine that the investigators
laboured under many difficulties), but it includes a number of obser-
vations which are very suggestive if we consider them in conjunction
with observations made elsewhere. The report will be found printed
in the Zeitschrift fiir Parapsychologie (1929), lvi, under the title
" Valiantines Entlarvung," by Dr Walther Kroner. With regard to
the question of controlling the medium it is noted (p. 595) that a
suggestion was made that Valiantine should wear luminous bands
on his wrists. He objected on the ground that if he wore bands, all
the sitters must wear them also and then there would be too much
125] The History of George Valiantine 393
light. Mr Bradley in his report on the first sittings he had with
Valiantine at Arlena Towers mentions (Towards the Stars, p. 7) that
Valiantine wore luminous bands ; he makes, however, no statement
as to how they were attached. This point is of importance, for if they
were detachable by Valiantine during the sitting, so far from being
helpful, they might actually confuse the issue, by producing in the
minds of the sitters the illusion that the medium's hands were on his
knees, when in point of fact one hand at least was free to move about
in the dark and handle a trumpet.
The trumpet used at Berlin was of the type habitually employed
at sittings with Valiantine, a metal trumpet in three sections painted
with a luminous band at the broad end. Scattered through the
report are a number of observations strongly suggesting that Vali-
antine had at his disposal a non-luminous trumpet. For instance
(p. 603), Frau Kroner, sitting on the medium's left, raised her foot
in front of her (an action by the way which is strictly forbidden to
Valiantine's sitters) and felt " a metallic object " apparently held in
the medium's hand. Baroness von P. (p. 650) was touched by a hard
object on her knee. She put out her hand and touched something
which seemed to be of hollow tin and gave out a metallic sound ; she
called out that it must be the trumpet. The ostensible trumpet
(with a luminous band) had, however, remained motionless in the
middle of the circle. Baroness von P. is positive there was a second
trumpet.
Frau von Dirksen, who was Valiantine's hostess in Berlin, and
appears at the outset to have been well-disposed towards him, had
a private sitting at which she alone was present. This sitting was
held as usual in darkness, but Frau von Dirksen alleges that there
was a little light coming through a crack in the door, and against this
light she saw Valiantine lean forward to speak into the trumpet
standing on the floor, that is, the usual seance-trumpet with a lumi-
nous band at the broad end. She also saw, she asserts, a second
(non-luminous) trumpet, silhouetted against the light, and this
trumpet was raised or lowered according as the voice of the Control
seemed to come from the floor or the ceiling (p. 604.)
Another sitter, Dr Quade, notes (p. 654) that at the first sitting he
had with Valiantine on 2 May 1929 he painted the trumpet with
luminous paint at its narrow end round the mouth-piece, and on this
occasion the usual sweeping movements of the trumpet did not
occur. At his second sitting on 11 May 1929 the luminous ring round
the mouth-piece had faded and movements of the trumpet did occur.
It is interesting to observe what Mr Bradley has to say about Dr
Quade's report. Mr Bradley is exceedingly angry with anyone who
professes to have exposed Valiantine before he himself exposed him,
and he pours the vials of his wrath and contempt on all the Berlin
394 Mrs W. H. Salter [part
circle except Dr Quade, of whom he speaks more kindly. He asserts
(And After, p. 166) that Dr Quade refrained " from making any alle-
gations of fraud whatever against Valiantine " and supports this
statement by an alleged quotation from Dr Quade's report, as
follows :
" By my placing a luminous ring on the small end of the
trumpet one should have been able to observe a hand touching that
portion of the instrument. The darkening of this luminous band by
the touching of a hand was not observed during the sitting, although
the trumpet was wafted round in a very wide circle."
This is what Dr Quade actually says :
" As a result of this upper
band of luminous paint it must have been observable if a hand had
grasped the top of the trumpet. The darkening of this band by the
interposition of a hand did not occur at the sitting, but neither did
the widely sweeping movements of the trumpet, which were habitual
at other sittings and in the absolute darkness of the room might be
fraudulently produced by someone seizing the trumpet, and turning
and moving it about." 1
I present this to my readers as an example of Mr Bradley's accur-
acy of mind and consequent reliability as a witness.
So far as I have been able to discover, this sitting in Berlin was the
only occasion when the trumpet was painted at the mouth-piece ; Mr
Bradley records several occasions when it was painted for a certain
distance up one side, but not within nine or ten inches of the top.
Dr Hans Driesch (p. 653) comments on the fact that at the sitting
he attended the trumpet had a luminous ring only at the wide end ;
the addition of a luminous ring at the mouth-piece was refused. He
suggests that Valiantine may have detached the upper non-luminous
sections of the trumpet and used them to speak through, leaving the
lower luminous section standing on the floor, where it would be
visible to the sitters and produce an illusion that the trumpet had
not moved from its place. I have never myself had an opportunity
of handling Valiantine's trumpets, but on p. 93 of And After I came
upon a statement which seems to imply that they are so constructed
that the upper sections are easily detachable from the lower sections.
This statement occurs in some observations by Mr C. V. L. Hooman,
a believer in the genuineness of Valiantine's phenomena. He re-
marks :
" Several times during the sitting the spirits, when replacing
the trumpets, seemed to lose control, with the result the trumpets
fell over, the upper movable ends becoming detached."

125] The History of George Valiantine 395
I had occasion to write to Dr Driesch about these German sittings
and in his reply he remarked : "It was the greatest swindle I have
ever seen. All those who were present at this seance (and twelve
others) were of the same opinion—even convinced spiritualists."
In this same year, 1929, some sittings were held in Italy at the house
of the Marquis Centurione Scotto. The Marquis is himself alleged to
be a powerful medium. An account of his mediumship was given by
Mrs Kelley Hack in Modern Psychic Mysteries, Millesimo Castle,
Italy, and a review of this book was printed on our Journal, xxvi.
10 ff. These Italian sittings with Valiantine are described by Mr
Bradley in And After.
At one of them which took place on 18 May 1929 {op. cit., p. 179)
special test-conditions were imposed ; Valiantine was bound to his
chair and the sitters were tied to one another. On p. 190 appears an
account by Signor Bozzano, who was responsible for the tying, of
the method used. His report does not seem to me satisfactory, it
leaves several important questions unanswered ; but the point I
wish to make here is that the tying together of the sitters could
certainly have been made nugatory by collusion between any two of
them, and probably by mala fides on the part of any one sitter. In
these circumstances it is essential that we should know who all the
sitters were, but no complete list is given. According to Signor
Bozzano's report the various cords by which Valiantine was tied
were found unbroken at the end of the sitting.
Another sitting was held next day, also " under complete control ;
"
we are not told in detail what the conditions of control were on this
occasion, but are left to assume that they were similar to the con-
ditions obtaining at the earlier sitting. At the end of this second
sitting " it was found that the cords [that is the cords binding the
medium] with the exception of those round Valiantine's left leg had
been rent," ostensibly by the spirits.
Only a few days later one of these Italian investigators, Signor
Rossi, alleged that he " had placed his hand on the back of Valian-
tine's right arm and shoulder, and found that Valiantine was leaning
forward " to speak into the trumpet (p. 187), and at the same time
what was tantamount to an accusation of fraud was brought by one
of this group of sitters against another, when Dr Castellani alleged
that he had caught hold of Mrs Bradley's hand which was touching
his head. I am not concerned here with the truth of Dr Castellani's
imputations, but if sitters begin to question one another's integrity,
they cannot wonder at other people's questioning. Incidentally this
is not the first time that an accusation of fraud has been brought
against a sitter in Mr Bradley's circle. In 1924 a sitting at which
Valiantine was not present took place at the house of some friends
of Mr Bradley's ; the circle consisted of nine persons, including Mr
396 Mrs W. H. Salter [part
and Mrs Bradley. The trumpet was wafted about in the usual way
and two days later one of the sitters alleged that she had put out her
hand in the darkness and had felt another hand holding the end of
the trumpet. The only moral to be drawn from such incidents is that
investigations of this kind, if they are to serve any useful purpose,
must be carried out by a carefully constituted group of investigators
who trust each other and whom the public is likely to trust ; the
sittings should be so conducted that the validity of the conclusions
does not depend on the good faith of any one sitter. It is fatal to give
any reasonable grounds for the question : quis custodiet ipsos cus-
todes ?
I turn now to the report published in vol. xxxvi of our Proceedings
by Lady Troubridge and Miss Radclyffe Hall. The sittings in
question took place at Dorincourt in the presence of Mr and Mrs
Bradley, and Lady Troubridge comments on the fact that no attempt
was made to control the medium in any way, which makes it difficult
to estimate the phenomena ; she suggests, however, that Valiantine
" did on several occasions speak from his chair so immediately after
a voice had spoken through a trumpet or at the other side of the
circle or high up in the far corner of the room, as in our opinion to
preclude the possibility of his having spoken in these positions and
regained his chair," and she thinks that " the total phenomena pro-
duced at this sitting were beyond what could have been obtained by
the fraudulent efforts of the medium unaided by any accomplice
"
(pp. 55, 56). I doubt myself whether the difficulty of producing such
phenomena as Lady Troubridge describes without the help of an
accomplice is as great as she suggests. It appears from a later state-
ment in her report (p. 57) that many of the voices heard did not
ostensibly use a trumpet. There were two trumpets available at the
sittings, both in three sections, and one having no illumination
beyond a band at its broad end. Has Lady Troubridge sufficiently
taken into account the possibility raised at the German sittings that
Valiantine was using the upper sections of one of the trumpets with-
out the knowledge of the sitters ? I think in this way, with the help
perhaps of some knowledge of the art of misdirection, he might
produce the illusion of a voice speaking at some distance from himself.
The question of an accomplice is not one I can usefully discuss,
but the following comment is, I think, permissible. Mr and Mrs
Bradley—according to Mr Bradley's own report—have obtained
very remarkable " direct-voice " phenomena by the power of their
own joint mediumship. Either these phenomena are genuine, or
they are not. If they are not, the question as to a possible accom-
plice is answered ; if they are genuine, then obviously Mr and Mrs
Bradley are not suitable people to take part in sittings designed to
test the powers of another medium for physical phenomena ; it is a
125] The History of George Valiantine 397
case of " too many cooks." The same objection applies to sittings
which took place in the presence of the Marquis Centurione Scotto.
Lady Troubridge and Miss Eadclyffe Hall also describe a daylight
sitting they had with Valiantine at Dorincourt. The procedure on
this occasion was that Valiantine sat with his back to the window
holding a trumpet in his hands, the broad end towards himself ; the
sitter sat facing him and held the narrow end of the trumpet to her
ear. The phenomena consisted in small taps on or in the trumpet
and a whispering voice. The taps were heard by both sitters simul-
taneously, the voices were only heard by one or other of them sitting
alone, a suggestive circumstance. 1
Both Lady Troubridge and Miss
Radclyffe Hall record the fact that they heard a voice at a time when
they could see the medium's face and could detect no movement of
his lips ; it is evident, however, from what they say that the speech
was often indistinct, and it does not seem at all certain that with
practice a man might not produce all the effects they observed with-
out any movement of the face that would be apparent to a single
sitter partly occupied in listening to the sound of the voice.
Two interesting questions are raised by Lady Troubridge in her
final comments :
" The first point is why, in view of the fact that at
the dark seances the trumpets are used with the wide end towards
the sitter's ear and the narrow or mouthpiece end towards the
supposed communicators, the reverse should be the case at the day-
light sittings ? . . .
" The second point is : In view of the fact that we were told it
was important to concentrate darkness within the trumpet, why does
Mr Valiantine sit so that the wide end of the trumpet—the least easy
to cover—should be towards the strong light of the window ? . . .
Also the wide end of the trumpet being towards the medium tends
to collect extraneous sounds such as the movements of the medium,
rustling of his clothes."
One might also add that it would collect the medium's extraneous
utterances, should he make any, and direct them to the sitter's ear.
That the medium sat with his back to the window (the day we are
told was sunny) must have made observation of his face more
difficult.
This report by Lady Troubridge and Miss Eadclyffe Hall, which is
refreshingly free from the obscurity and superficiality of most
reports on Valiantine, is the nearest approach I have found to
evidence for his possession of supernormal physical powers, and I
am sure the writers would be the first to admit that it does not give
1
Dr Woolley and Mr E. J. Dingwall, each of whom has had a daylight sitting
with Valiantine, agree that it is impossible for a sitter with his ear to the
trumpet to keep a continuous and close watch on the medium's face. And see
also the observations made by Lord Charles Hope, p. 416.
398 Mrs W. H. Salter [part
us much to weight in the balance against a heavy presumption of
fraud.
I have mentioned that a curious episode occurred at the sittings
held at Dorincourt in 1924. Before turning to Valiantine's final
exposure by Mr Bradley I will briefly describe this episode, which
took place on 3 February 1924 and is described in Towards the Stars.
It happened that contrary to instructions a strong light was turned
on in the garage-yard during the seance and some light " came
through the windows over the top of the curtains, and in sufficient
quantity for one to see dimly the faces of the sitters." A trumpet
was seen in the air " without visible means of support," but as it fell
to the ground at the moment the light came on it is obvious that there
may have been some support which the sitters did not have time to
see. Valiantine appeared to be distressed and complained of his
stomach ; after about ten minutes Mr De Wyckoff got up to turn on
the light, when the voice of Bert Everett was heard in great agitation
asking him not to do this.
" De Wyckoff went to Valiantine's assistance and said that Valian-
tine was enveloped in a whitish sort of film. Mr Caradoc Evans then
crossed over and later described this substance as a slimy, frothy
bladder '
into which you could dig your finger but through which
you could not pierce.' I felt the face and hands, and they were dead
cold."
After sitting in the dark for another half-hour Valiantine appar-
ently recovered sufficiently to be put to bed. There he remained
next day and a doctor was called in. On the following day " with
the exception of a black bruise on his stomach, measuring about
two inches by three—evidently caused by the shock of the returning
ectoplasm—he was quite well."
In the absence of any further evidence this incident is likely to
remain unexplained. Mr Bradley himself, who accepts the ecto-
plasmic theory in general, and at that time accepted Valiantine's
bona fides without reserve, has no difficulty in explaining it ; but I
do not find myself able to follow Mr Bradley. Even if we assume
that some persons have a faculty of extruding ectoplasm from their
bodies, we have, so far as I can see, no adequate ground for supposing
that Valiantine possesses this faculty. The convenient hypothesis
that if one supernormal phenomenon occurs in a medium's presence,
every other kind of supernormal phenomenon may occur, and the
less likely a thing is to happen the better reason for believing it did,
is one I do not find myself able to accept. It is true that there is talk
now and again of materialised spirit-hands at Valiantine's sittings,
but so far as I have been able to ascertain, no adequate steps were
ever taken to prove that they were not his own. Frau von Dirksen
(Z. /. Paraps. lvi. 605) states that at her private sitting, to which
125] The History of George Valiantine 399
reference lias already been made, she saw what was alleged to be a
materialised hand about a yard away. Owing to the light coming
through the crack in the door she could see the sleeve of Valiantine's
coat attached to this hand. She describes this episode as a piece of
" shameless " trickery.
If we assume, as on the evidence of Valiantine's frequent recourse
to trickery I think we are bound to assume, that at the moment when
the garage light was so inconveniently turned on, he was trying to
deceive his sitters, just what was he " up to "? The " whitish sort
of film " in which he appeared to be enveloped may have been an
illusion. As I noticed myself in the sittings I had with Eva C, in
almost complete darkness curious illusions of luminosity do occur,
especially when the eyes become fatigued. But what of the frothy
bladder 1 What part was this destined to play ? What would the
sitters have seen if Mr De Wyckoff had not been dissuaded by Bert
Everett from turning on the light ? Was the bruise on Valiantine's
stomach genuine, and, if so, what caused it ? These questions must,
as the evidence stands at present, remain unanswered.
I now turn to the evidence of fraud obtained by Mr Bradley against
VaUantine in 1931. I do not propose to describe this evidence in
full ; it should be studied in Mr Bradley's own detailed and docu-
mented report {And After, p. 287 ff.). Briefly, it was shown beyond
any reasonable doubt that at a series of sittings held at Dorincourt
Valiantine had made use of various parts of his own body, fingers,
toes and elbow-joint, to produce on wax and on smoked paper im-
prints of what were alleged to be spirit-hands. But there is one point
in connection with this evidence which is worth careful consideration
Mr Bradley, who is deeply committed to a belief in the genuineness
of Valiantine's earlier phenomena and especially the genuineness of
the " spirit-voices," is much concerned to dissociate these voices so
far as he possibly can from phenomena which he admits to be fraudu-
lent. The shifts and evasions to which this attempt reduces him
illustrate the troubles which beset a man who prides himself on his
honesty, when he refuses to face an unpalatable truth.
The truth of the matter is that Valiantine's spirit-voices committed
themselves to the genuineness of Valiantine's spirit-imprints time
and time again. The evidence for this is worth giving in some detail,
as it has an important bearing on our final estimate of Valiantine's
mediumship.
At the sitting of 20 February 1931, the first of the finger-print
series, the following voices took part : Dr Barnett, one of Valiantine's
regular controls ;
Honey, the spirit-guide of another medium, Mrs
Barkell ; Conan Doyle, who said, " I am trying to give an imprint "
;
George Gregory, a friend who had " manifested " at one of Mr
Bradley's private sittings when Valiantine was not present ; Dan
400 Mrs W. H. Salter [part
Bradley, Mr Bradley's father, of whom he says on this occasion, " His
'
voice '
was characteristic and recognisable." At this sitting two
imprints on smoked paper were obtained, one of which was after-
wards found to be the imprint of Valiantine's big toe.
At the sitting of 21 February Conan Doyle was again said to be
trying to get an imprint through ; Mr Jaquin, a sitter who played
a very important part in obtaining proof of fraud, said, " Sir Arthur,
would you try to give an imprint of your index finger instead of a
thumb %
" To this the " Doyle " voice replied, " I will try to do so."
Another imprint was obtained at this sitting, which also proved to
be made by Valiantine's right great toe.
At the sitting of 22 February only Mr and Mrs Bradley and
Valiantine were present, and the voices were extremely fluent. Dr
Barnett asked that the modelling wax should be made softer. He
was questioned concerning a little blood which Valiantine had
brought up in a fit of coughing after the sitting of 21 February, and
said that the blood had been used for making the imprints and had
not been completely re-absorbed into the medium's body. He was
also asked why Valiantine had sweated freely during the sittings of
20 and 21 February and said that the medium's sweat-glands had been
used to make the imprints. The " late Lord Dewar " spoke in a faint
whisper and said he had " tried to get his index-finger on the wax."
At the sitting of 23 February " Lord Dewar " again spoke in a
whisper. On this occasion two imprints were obtained on smoked
paper and one on wax. After the sitting impressions were taken of
the big toes of all present. A similarity was observed between the
imprints obtained at the sitting and the imprints of Valiantine's left
big toe. In the case of one of these imprints the identification is
confirmed by ex-Chief Inspector Bell, of the Finger-Print Depart-
ment, Scotland Yard.
At the sitting of 25 February several members of the Doyle family
were present and Conan Doyle was alleged to communicate. These
communications appear to be accepted as genuine by the family.
Three imprints were obtained, two of papillary ridges (which have
not been traced), and one apparently of an elbow-joint.
For the sitting of 27 February some special wax had been prepared
impregnated with methylene green (a fact unknown to Valiantine).
At the beginning of the sitting Valiantine as usual said the Lord's
Prayer, upon which Mr Bradley comments that " in view of what
transpired this seemed a somewhat ironic procedure." On another
occasion when a fraudulent medium, to whose bona fides Mr Bradley
was in no way committed, did exactly the same thing, he calls it " a
nauseating blasphemy."
Mr Bradley, wishing, as I have said, to dissociate voices and fraud,
comments on the fact that at this sitting very few voices were heard
125] The History of George Valiantine 401
and the sitting seemed " dead." That things did not " go with a
swing " on this occasion seems to me amply accounted for by the
fact that Valiantine had been made aware of an atmosphere of sus-
picion (although the sitters did their best to reassure him) and was
probably nervous. But the voices were not entirely silent. " Pat
O'Brien," being asked whether spirits could see in the dark replied,
" To be sure, or how could they see to give imprints \
" The voice
of Bert Everett asserted that the imprint obtained that day was that
of the late Sir Henry Segrave. " Abraham Wallace " also said a few
words.
At the conclusion of the sitting two imprints were found on smoked
paper and one on the special wax. The imprints on paper are almost
certainly identifiable with the right side of the middle finger of
Valiantine's left hand. The imprint on wax was apparently of an
elbow-joint. Valiantine was stripped then and there and a strain of
methylene green was found on his left elbow-joint.
Finally it is worth noting that the production of these fraudulent
imprints was not confined to the particular sittings which Mr
Bradley reports. At a sitting held a month or so earlier at the house
of a certain " Mr X " an imprint was obtained which was alleged to
be that of Walter Stinson, Margery's Control. This imprint was
identified with the middle finger of Valiantine's left hand. Moreover
in 1925 some imprints were obtained at Mr Bradley's house, which in
the light of subsequent discoveries are highly suspect. These will be
found discussed in The Wisdom of the Gods.
Now it seems to me established beyond all possible denial that in
these sittings of 1931 Valiantine's spirit-voices committed themselves
irretrievably to the production of fraudulent phenomena. But some
of these voices, Dr Barnett's, for instance, and Bert Everett's, have
played a leading part in Valiantine's mediumship for many years,
and taken as a whole these later manifestations, associated with
fraud, differ in degree perhaps, but not in kind from the earlier mani-
festations in which Mr Bradley still asks us to believe. Moreover,
as I have shown, suspicious circumstances have again and again been
observed at Valiantine's sittings, and we have reason to believe that
at least as far back as 1923 he was resorting to fraudulent practices.
That being so, and taking into account the very unsatisfactory con-
ditions which habitually obtain at his sittings, we are bound to con-
clude that the whole of Valiantine's mediumship in its physical aspect
is suspect, and his claims to supernormal physical powers unproven.
There remains only one hope for Valiantine ; it might be possible to
establish that the content of these spirit-messages was supernormal,
in other words, that Valiantine possesses genuine mental powers of a
supernormal order, which he habitually ekes out by physical fraud.
To the mental aspect of his mediumship I will therefore turn.
402 Mrs W. H. Salter [part
One of the most remarkable of the mental phenomena alleged to
occur at sittings with Valiantine is " speaking with tongues " ; it is
said that the spirit-voices converse fluently in a great number of
languages with which Valiantine himself is quite unacquainted.
Among the languages cited are French, German, Italian, including
a Sicilian dialect, Spanish, Basque, Portuguese, Welsh, Russian,
Hindustani, Arabic, Japanese, and last, but not least, " archaic-
Chinese," the communicating spirit in this case being Confucius him-
self. For this remarkable linguistic range there appears at first sight
to be a great wealth of testimony, but on a closer inspection this
wealth dwindles to a few poor farthings, and these, I suspect, are
brass.
When I was reviewing the available evidence one point which
struck me as curious was that there is a much better prima facie case
for knowledge of such a remote language as ancient Chinese—as to
which not above two or three of all the people who have ever sat with
Valiantine are capable of forming an independent judgment—than
for such widely known languages as French and German, and it would
almost seem as though the better the sitters understand any parti-
cular language the less are the spirits who come to that sitting able
to speak it.
It is impossible without being tedious to discuss all the occasions
upon which foreign languages are said to have been spoken, but I
will give a number of typical examples, from which it is possible to
form a general estimate of the evidence, taking the various languages
one by one.
French. The evidence for any knowledge of this language, pro-
bably after English the most widely known among Valiantine's
sitters, seems to be very scanty. On p. 389 of The Wisdom of the
Gods, it is said that Countess Ahlefeldt-Laurvig had a daylight
sitting, at which she alone was present, and her brother communi-
cated with her in French. There is no first-hand statement by the
sitter and no record of what was said ; it is therefore impossible to
form any judgment as to the value of this incident. 1
Spanish. At a sitting held at Arlena Towers in 1923 (Towards the
Stars, p. 33) a Spanish cook of Mr De Wyckoff's was present. It is
said that her husband spoke with her in " a mixture of Basque and
corrupt Spanish." It is also said that he spoke " in good Spanish
"
to Mr De Wyckoff. All this is given at second-hand ; Mr Bradley
does not himself know Spanish, and not a word of any conversation
is quoted in the original. The cook is obviously a bad witness, very
emotional and excited.
At Dorincourt in 1924 (Towards the Stars, p. 197), Lady Grey of
Fallodon and Mr William Archer being present, we are told that
1
Cf. Lord Charles Hope's observations, below, p. 415.
125] The History of George Valiantine 403
" at a later stage a spirit endeavoured to hold a conversation with
Lady Grey and Mr Archer in Spanish." From the use of the word
" endeavoured " we may infer that these two sitters, whose joint
testimony would have carried considerable weight, did not find the
spirit very fluent or intelligible on this occasion.
Italian. At Dorincourt in 1924 (Towards the Stars, p. 218),
Senator Marconi being present, " the voice spoke to him in Italian
a language I [Mr Bradley] cannot follow—and addressed him as
'
Guglielmo.' The voice was rather indistinct, but Senator Marconi
kept the conversation going for over ten minutes, and he was
answered throughout in the Italian language. Senator Marconi
afterwards said that the spirit voice announced itself as his father,
but he had not been successful in acquiring sufficient evidence to
establish his identity." It is interesting to be told that Senator
Marconi kept the conversation going for over ten minutes, but no
one is likely to question his knowledge of Italian. We are not told
what impression the spirit-voice made on him beyond the fact that
it spoke indistinctly and he was not satisfied with the evidence of
identity it offered.
On another occasion (The Wisdom of the Gods, p. 368) Mr Harry
Price reports that at a sitting at which he was present in 1925
Italian was spoken, and he quotes a few short phrases. The best
evidence for the speaking of Italian at Valiantine's sittings is to be
found in the reports published in the spiritualistic magazine Luce e
Ombra, of the sittings held in Italy (see, for example, Luce e Ombra,
xxx. 27 ff.). If the integrity of the sitters can be assumed—I have
no grounds for doubting it, but the point is essential, for it would
have been perfectly easy in the darkness of the seance-room for any
one of them to act the part of a supposed communicator—it would
certainly appear that a fair knowledge of conversational Italian was
shown. Voices are said to have spoken in Sicilian and Piedmontese
dialects, but no quotations are given. It is also said (p. 33) that
Imperator, whom " some called Peter and some Malachi," communi-
cated and " intoned a liturgical chant in Latin " which greatly im-
pressed his hearers. On being asked to repeat it slowly, in order that
it might be written down, he said he would give it in Italian, as
follows :
" Un Mondo d'argento sara pieno di spiriti. Cristo non vuole
piu guerra. Cristo vuole che gli spiriti vengano sempre per stabilire
communicazioni colla terra."
It is unfortunate that Imperator did not realise how much more
valuable a record of his liturgical Latin would have been.
The difficulty of assessing the value of these reports in Luce e
Ombra, written of course in Italian, is increased by the fact that it is
not always made clear in what language the voices actually spoke.
404 Mrs W. H. Salter [part
On p. 28, for example, Bert Everett is represented as saying, " Ogni
cosa e squisita." Did Bert Everett speak in Italian ?
" Exquisite
"
is one of his regular catch-words.
Of all foreign languages Italian seems the one most likely to be
known conversationally to Valiantine, for it is widely spoken in
America by Italian immigrants. Mr Bradley tells us (And After,
p. 165) that from his own " absolute knowledge " he can assert that
Valiantine does not speak Italian. But how can he tell us this from
his own knowledge, when he has told us more than once that he does
not himself speak Italian ? Incidentally it is very much easier to
discover that a man does not know a language when he is pretending
he does, than to discover that he does know it when he is pretending
he does not. I think many of Valiantine's sitters have been much
too ready to take his simplicity and ignorance for granted, for if he
is fraudulent, an appearance of simplicity and ignorance will obvi-
ously be a part of his stock-in-trade.
German. In Towards the Stars, p. 193, we are told that at a sitting
held at the British College for Psychic Science in February 1924 an
Austrian lady, Miss Eisner, was present and a spirit communicated
purporting to be her grandmother. " The conversation opened in
English and drifted into German. Later the Austrian lady's mother
came and conversed with her also in German." No details of the
conversation and no quotations are given. With this statement may
be compared the evidence obtained at the Berlin sittings :
On one occasion (Z. /. Paraps. lvi. 503) we are told that " a
whispering voice, hardly intelligible, said several times to Frau von
Dirksen, '
Dein Mann, ja, ja, sehr gut.' To every question put by
Frau von Dirksen the answer was, '
Ja, ja, sehr gut.' ... A
similar voice spoke later to Princess Y. The communications were
just as poor as in Frau von Dirksen's case, and also in the case of
every other German-speaking intelligence which manifested in the
course of the enquiry."
With this we may compare Frau von Dirksen's report of the
private sitting she had with Valiantine (p. 604). Her husband pur-
ported to communicate and spoke in English. Valiantine having
ascertained, as she tells us, that he could speak English when alive.
For the first time the communications were intelligible and coherent,
although nothing evidential was said.
On p. 599 we are told that a voice addressed a nephew of Frau von
Dirksen's and spoke the words " Vater, Mutter "
;
they were pro-
nounced " Vatter, Motter." Both this young man's parents were
living. Dr Driesch (p. 653) testifies to the fact that in his hearing
only one or two words of German were spoken. Dr Quade (p. 655)
notes the foreign accent :
" Ich sprekke Deutsch."
Russian. In Towards the Stars, p. 219, we are told that at a
125] The History of George Valiantine 405
sitting in February 1924 " a voice talked to Mrs Mollo, in what
sounded like Russian. . . . The voice, during the conversation,
addressed Mrs Mollo as Anna Gregorievna and stated that it was the
son of her husband. I [Mr Bradley] ascertained afterwards that
Mrs Mollo's husband had a son by a previous marriage and he had
passed away. This stepson had always addressed Mrs Mollo as
Anna Gregorievna." Here again no quotations are given and no
first-hand corroboration, so that the value of the incident cannot be
assessed.
Welsh. In Towards the Stars, p. 210, Mr Caradoc Evans reports
a conversation he had during a sitting at Dorincourt with a com-
municator purporting to be his father. A quotation is given which,
if it is accurate, indicates that some knowledge of Welsh was shown.
But is it accurate ? As the sittings take place in complete darkness,
one assumes in the absence of any statement to the contrary, that no
notes were made at the time. When were the notes of the conversa-
tion made : that is, how long after the sitting ? This we are not told,
and in a case where verbal accuracy is the whole root of the matter,
it is a point of great importance. Mr Bradley's own standard in such
matters may be judged from some criticisms he passes (Towards the
Stars, p. 314) on a report by Mr Malcohn Bird of the sittings held
under the auspices of the Scientific American. " He [Mr Bird] says
that ' even with a poverty of phenomena, we could not remember the
sequence of the sitting sufficiently well.' Why could he not re-
member the sequence ? Any intelligent mind can not only record a
short sequence of the occurrences of two hours, but can memorize
the gist of a dozen conversations practically word for word."
I will make so bold as to say that I believe the accuracy of my
memory to be at least equal to Mr Bradley's, but I would not under-
take without the help of contemporary notes to record a complete
sequence " of the occurrences of two hours," or " the gist of a dozen
conversations practically word for word."
As to Mr Caradoc Evans's testimony, it is perhaps mere prejudice
on my part, but I should attach more weight to it if he had not
asserted (The Wisdom of the Gods, p. 40) that at a private sitting at
Dorincourt, at which neither Valiantine nor any other professional
medium was present, Mrs Leonard's Control, Feda, sat on his knees
" substantially " and kissed him with " lips that were warm with
the warmth of life." To make such a statement on such evidence as
Mr Caradoc Evans had, seems to me to argue either unlimited
credulity, or a complete indifference to truth !
An Indian Dialect. At a sitting in 1925 (The Wisdom of the Gods,
p. 238) at which two Indians were present, a voice was heard speaking
" a foreign language." The Indian sitters addressed this voice in an
" Indian dialect," but they could not understand the answers.
2e
406 Mrs W. H. Salter [part
Japanese. At a sitting in March 1925 (The Wisdom of the Gods,
p. 274) the Japanese poet Gonnoske Komai was present. A voice
addressed him in what was alleged to be Japanese. Mr Komai said
that the voice volunteered certain names and places, and also said
that the speaker had committed " hari-kari." In a polite letter of
thanks to Mr Bradley Mr Komai says, " I greatly regret that I could
not recognise the gentleman who tried so hard to communicate with
me in my native tongue." We may infer from this guarded state-
ment that the attempt was not in Mr Komai's opinion successful. 1
Chinese. This is prima, facie the most remarkable example of
speaking in a foreign language which has been reported at Valian-
tine's sittings. A communicator who represents himself to be
Confucius, is said to have conversed fluently and intelligently " in
archaic Chinese." Now it is first to be observed that the evidence
for this phenomenon depends on the testimony of only one witness
whose opinion is of any value at all, Dr Neville Whymant, who
attended a number of sittings with Valiantine in New York and has
published a report of his observations entitled Psychic Adventures in
New York. It is obviously impossible for any one who was not
present at these sittings and who has absolutely no knowledge of
Chinese to dispute with Dr Whymant, but in view of the startling
claims he makes it is certainly unfortunate that he offers so little but
his own assertions to support them ; there is no attempt to set out
in detail the evidence upon which these assertions are based. At-
tempts to obtain the corroborative testimony of other scholars have
failed. For example, at a sitting held in London Lord Charles Hope
obtained a gramophone record of a voice speaking in what purports
to be Chinese. This record, though it bears a general resemblance in
sound to Chinese, is untranslatable, a fact which Dr Whymant him-
self admits (see below, p. 41 9). To attribute this fact to bad recording
is to beg the question at issue.
Without in any way impugning Dr Whymant's good faith one may
question whether he has made sufficient allowance for the liability of
the ear to be deceived when straining to catch the indistinct whispers
of which these trumpet communications mainly consist. My own
impression that suggestibility may have played a considerable part
in the conclusions to which Dr Whymant has come is strengthened
by the observations made by Lord Charles Hope in the Phoenix
sittings (see below, p. 427). It there appears that Dr Whymant
believed himself to have heard a number of words in various Oriental
languages on occasions when Mr Yih, a Chinaman from the School
of Oriental Studies, " could not catch a single word of any language
except English." In the case of Phoenix also recourse to fraud has
been clearly proved.
1
8ee also Lord Charles Hope's report below, p. 415,
125] The History of George Valiantine 407
The whole crux of the matter in Valiantine's case is the question
whether the voices displayed any accurate or scholarly knowledge
of Chinese such as is alleged by Dr Whymant. That Valiantine
should be able to produce a passable imitation of Chinese, including
perhaps a few actual words of the language, would not be remarkable
in view of the fact that America is full of Chinamen.
Turning now to another aspect of Valiantine's mental phenomena,
we are told that through his mediumship a great multitude of com-
municating spirits have given evidence of their personal identity.
Here again, as in the case of foreign languages, the enquirer finds
himself confronted by an immense amount of paper currency, but
very little hard cash ; he is reminded of those disastrous conse-
quences of inflation to which our attention has been lately called. I
will not assert dogmatically that Valiantine has no supernormal
powers at all, for I cannot prove a negative ; it may be that he has,
but the fact has yet to be established. In this matter, as in every
other, Mr Bradley's records are so superficial as to be all but useless.
Lady Troubridge, in the report from which I have already quoted,
discusses some communications received by Miss Radclyffe Hall and
herself in which knowledge was shown which it did not seem likely
Valiantine would normally possess. At the same time it was not
impossible for him to obtain it by judicious enquiry, and one or two
mistakes were made which are easily explained on the supposition
that Valiantine was using information obtained from normal sources,
but not likely to have been made by a genuine communicator. On
one occasion, for example, a communicator announced her intention
of going home with Lady Troubridge and said she had often been
with her in Sterling Street, Lady Troubridge had left Sterling
Street about a year before the sitting, although she still appeared in
the telephone booh as resident at that address ; the purporting com-
municator had never visited Lady Troubridge at Sterling Street and
would have been unlikely to speak of going home with her, there or
anywhere else, since her personal acquaintance with Lady Trou-
bridge was slight. Generally speaking, Lady Troubridge and Miss
Radclyffe Hall do not seem to have been favourably impressed with
what we may call the psychological atmosphere of the communica-
tions, and contrast them unfavourably in this respect with communi-
cations received through Mrs Leonard (Proceedings, xxxvi. 56 ff.).
One other point in this report is worth noting, for it shows the need
of caution in regard to the resemblance so frequently claimed
between the trumpet-voices and the living voices of the persons said
to be communicating. At one of the sittings at which Lady Trou-
bridge and Miss Radclyffe Hall were present Mrs Leonard's Control,
Feda, purported to speak, as she often does at sittings with Valian-
tine. " The other sitters . . . exclaimed that the '
Feda-Valiantine
'
408 Mrs W. H. Salter [part
voice was exactly like its prototype," but neither Lady Troubridge
nor Miss Radclyffe Hall thought that " the voice or accents bore
any resemblance to the '
Feda '
voice familiar to [them] at Mrs
Leonard's."
A suggestive point in regard to the recognition of voices is also to
be found in one of the reports in Luce e Ombra to which I have already
referred. In vol. xxx, p. 212, there appears a " declaration " signed
by a number of sitters concerning phenomena obtained at some
sittings held at Venice in 1929. Signora Nunes-Vais did not sign this
declaration " perche, pur essendosi dichiarata entusiasta dei risultati
ottenuti, fece una riserva sulla '
voce '
di suo Padre che non ha
riconosciuta " ; that is to say, Signora Nunes-Vais was enthusiastic
about communications from persons she did not know well ; in
regard to communications from her own father she reserved her
opinion, because she did not recognise his voice !
I have said that Mr Bradley's records are inadequate for any
scientific purposes ; I will justify this statement by an example,
taken from The Wisdom of the Gods, p. 211. At the same sitting at
which Welsh is said to have been spoken, Mr Harold Wimbury, a
journalist by profession, was present, and a voice addressed him,
speaking a word which he did not at first catch. Another member
of the circle said the word sounded like " Walter." A conversation
followed in the course of which, according to Mr Wimbury's report,
the communicator said that Mr Wimbury had known him twenty
years ago in Birmingham and that his other name was " Downing."
Mr Wimbury tells us that he had in fact been on very friendly terms
with a fellow-journalist called Walter Downing, since dead, in Bir-
mingham many years before the sitting. In reply to the question,
" Do you remember Sally 1
" the communicator said, " Yes, re-
member me to him and all of them." Asked whether he could say
where he and the sitter had lived together, he replied, " Over the
hotel." Both these answers were correct. Sally was " the nickname
for a man name Sanders not afemale," and Mr Wimbury had at one
time shared a room with Walter Downing over the Crown Hotel,
Birmingham.
Now this incident affords some primafacie evidence for knowledge
supernormally acquired, but, as reported by Mr Bradley, it con-
stitutes a case for further enquiry and nothing more. As in the case
of the conversation in Welsh, we are not told how long after the
sitting Mr Wimbury made his notes, nor are we told whether any
other sitters can corroborate his statement as to the answers given
to his questions or the form in which these questions were asked ; in
particular we are not told whether the name " Downing " was clearly
heard by any one to whom its relevance was not known, an im-
portant point, in view of the indistinctness with which on Mr
125] The History of George Valiantine 400
Bradley's own admission these trumpet-voices often speak.1
Nor
and this is perhaps the most important point of all—are we given
any means of assessing the probability that Valiantine might have
derived the knowledge shown at the sitting from some normal source.
Will students of psychical phenomena never learn that we have no
right, scientifically speaking, to claim a supernormal origin for an
occurrence until we have established the improbability of any normal
origin ?
Whether in view of Valiantine's proved trickery any further
enquiry into his phenomena on the mental side is likely to be worth
the trouble it would entail may be open to doubt, but one thing is
certain : if such an enquiry is to serve any useful purpose, it must
be held under the most rigid test-conditions ; there must be an
accurate record of all that is said at the sittings, and the anonymity
of the sitters must be assured.
There remains yet one aspect of Valiantine's mediumship to con-
sider : the part he played in the cross-correspondences with Margery,
for in several of the most striking cases his co-operation was essential
to the result. I cannot here attempt to describe or discuss these
cross-correspondences in detail ; I will only remind my readers of
two important points :
(1) It was claimed in Dr Richardson's report that the evidence was
not dependent for its value on the good faith of the mediums con-
cerned, but upon the fraud-proof technique used in the selection of
the subject-matter of the cross-correspondences. Dr Richardson
explicitly admits that apart from this technique they " could have
been a matter of pre-arrangement between the mediums " (Psychic
Research, xxii. 355).
(2) The technique as described by Dr Richardson has been criti-
cised by Mr Besterman (Proceedings, xxxviii. 399 ff.), who shows that
it is far from being fraud-proof, and therefore the good faith of the
various people concerned is a vital element in tfte case. Another
cross-correspondence between Margery in Boston and Valiantine in
Venice, which Mr Bradley reports in And After is open to the same
objection.
What are we to think of these phenomena in the light of Valian-
tine's record as a medium in other fields % The cross-correspond-
ences, if genuine, argue supernormal powers of an astonishingly high
order ; in their perfect precision of result they stand unrivalled. Can
we suppose such powers to have been shown on some half-a-dozen
occasions by a man who has unquestionably resorted to fraud in the
production of physical phenomena, and whose claim to the possession
of any supernormal powers, apart from the cross-correspondences,
can be shown to rest upon a most unstable foundation ?
1
Cp. Lord Charles Hope's observations on this point below, p. 413.
410 Mrs W. H. Salter [PART 125]
If we answer this question in the negative, it follows that the
knowledge necessary to Valiantine's part in the cross-correspondences
must have been obtained from a normal source. We are then faced
with a further problem as to the source from which it was obtained ;
and upon that reflexion I will close.
:
APPENDIX
REPORT ON SOME SITTINGS WITH VALIANTINE
AND PHOENIX IN 1927 1
By Lord Charles Hope
I
The usual conditions at the Valiantine sittings held in my flat, were
as follows : the medium sat on an ordinary chair at one end of the
room, which was narrow but fairly long, and a rough circle was
completed by the sitters. On an average there was about two feet
and a half clear between the chairs, sometimes rather less. Two
aluminium trumpets spotted with luminous paint were usually
placed on the floor some few feet from the medium. The aluminium
trumpets were made in three segments one fitting inside the other,
and were thus collapsible. They had been brought by the medium
from America.
The circle of sitters was arranged so that the backs of at least two
chairs were each hard up against a wall, making it impossible for the
medium to get round outside the circle, although there was a clear
space of about two feet behind his own chair, and it would usually
have been possible for him to have stood behind the chairs of the two
sitters directly next to him. Behind the sitter immediately opposite
him there was a considerable clear space.
The darkness was complete, as any light filtering in through the
window or under the door was at once remarked upon by the medium
or on one or two occasions by the " voices " and deemed to inhibit
the " phenomena."
No one, as far as I know, held hands with the person next to him.
After I had had my first two sittings with Valiantine, these being
held at Mr Bradley's house, I suggested to Mr Bradley that some kind
of test sittings should be held. Mr Bradley became considerably
disturbed and informed the medium of my request. I was told that
Valiantine considered he had got past the stage when such tests could
be thought necessary and that the nature of the mental evidence
given at the sittings was a sufficient guarantee in itself.
I was disappointed, but as I had returned from abroad specially
for the experience of sitting with Valiantine I was naturally loath to
miss the opportunity.
1
Abridged from a paper read at a Private Meeting of the Society, 30 March
1932.
411
412 Lord Charles Hope [part
I will not attempt to go into details about each sitting, but I will
endeavour to give examples of the best and the worst of the pheno-
mena experienced.
First of all, I should say, the " voices " attributed to various
" guides " of the medium were usually loud and fairly clear, whereas
the communicating " voices," attributed to other spirits (the friends
and relations of the sitters) were usually very low and indistinct.
This was unfortunate as it was from these communicators that
evidence for survival could be expected.
The first phenomenon which occurred at the sittings was in almost
every case the voice of " Dr Barnett," Valiantine's chief guide, which
seemed to come from a trumpet still placed on its big end on the
floor in front of the medium. This voice was usually loud and clear
and had a distinct Scottish accent, although the accent was not always
constant, sometimes lapsing into Americanisms. This, I was told,
was to be expected, as " Dr Barnett " had come with his family to
America from Scotland as a small boy.
I will now endeavour to give some idea of the most impressive
communications received at the sittings I attended. I quote from
notes either written by me immediately after the sitting, or taken
down at the time by a professional notetaker.
During my first four Valiantine sittings three names of guides were
given. These names had been given to me previously, one at a
private sitting and the other two by professional mediums. This
was a point distinctly in favour of Valiantine's mediumship, pro-
vided, as he afterwards assured me, he had had no normal knowledge
of these names. Unfortunately the subsequent history of these
alleged guides was not satisfactory, although that would not rule out
a telepathic explanation of my having received these names through
Valiantine's mediumship.
I will divide the phenomena into five sections, taking favourable
and unfavourable examples of each. The first is my own personal
evidence. As I have already stated three names of alleged " guides
"
were given correctly. Also at my earlier sittings a communicator
spoke, purporting to be an Aunt of mine. The name given at first
was a common one but conveyed nothing to me until I remembered
I had had an Aunt of that name who was always called by another
name. To encourage this " voice " I spoke, giving the name by
which my Aunt had really been called. This was immediately
accepted by the " voice " which continued to speak at most of the
subsequent sittings. Unfortunately, although this voice gained in
strength and assurance, nothing of an evidential kind was ever given
although I supplied many opportunities for it to do so. Before the
end of my Valiantine sittings I felt I could have got this " voice " to
acquiesce and repeat any nonsense I cared to suggest, but I did not
125] Report on Some Sittings with Valiantine and Phoenix 413
do so, as I wished to give the " voice " the fullest chance to make
good. A Father and a Grandfather voice also spoke, but absolutely
nothing which could be considered evidential was said to me.
One point of interest I noticed in connection with these alleged
voices of my relations was that they gradually grew in strength and
volubility, and when presented in a more developed form, so to speak,
to some relations of mine who came to some later sittings, created
quite a good impression. Only 7 could see that this improvement
was really due to my former conversations with these " voices."
Names which I had mentioned during the sittings, the address
abroad of a near relative to whom I was constantly writing, and one
or two names I had mentioned to the medium, all came out quite
" pat," and this of course impressed me unfavourably. A name,
however, was mentioned suddenly one day by a voice which pur-
ported to be the Aunt of a girl whose name was given. It stated cor-
rectly that this girl was at the moment in India with some relations
of mine and said it wished to speak to her when she returned. There
again, it was impossible to be sure the medium had not overheard
some one mention this name casually before a sitting, although I
certainly had not done so myself.
Now to turn to communications made to other sitters. It was of
course in those cases harder for me to judge of their value. One lady,
a foreigner, came several times and received messages which favour-
ably impressed her. These were usually given in French and some-
times in Russian but, to be candid, I felt uneasy lest she might have
thought she was hearing more than was actually the case, inasmuch
as the voice was weak and she a little deaf.
On one occasion she carried on quite a long conversation in English
with an entity purporting to be a friend of hers, and I was told the
replies given to her questions were quite satisfactory. The com-
munications in French and Russian, on the other hand, were very
brief and disjointed. Although most of the communications to other
sitters also were of a fleeting order one or two things were said which,
if heard correctly, would point to at least some telepathic power
being possessed by the medium.
A Christian name and surname were given to a sitter which were
in fact the names of a likely communicator. The sitter was unknown
to the medium and there seemed no likely normal means by which
the medium could have learnt this name. Here again the question
arises whether or not the sitter really did hear the name given
correctly or whether a two-syllabled murmur merely gave him the
idea of that name which he was half expecting.
Several other sitters were also favourably impressed but when I later
endeavoured to learn what facts or names had been volunteered, the
evidence furnished seemed always to have been of the slenderest kind.

Fathers and Grandfathers predominated among the list of alleged
communicators, and unfortunately, as the medium had usually been
introduced by name to the sitters just before the sittings, references
to " Father Smith " or " Grandfather Smith " were not evidential.
One sitter at his one and only experience of Valiantine's medium-
ship was addressed by a voice claiming to be his father. He asked
this voice to give its own Christian name. Reply, " You know it
very well." The sitter agreed, but said he required it as a proof of
identity. The voice, " I can give it, but is that all you have to say to
me ? Your brother is here." The sitter replied, " Do you mean my
brother Arthur ?
" The father voice then said the brother would
speak later.
Towards the end of this sitting the trumpet went over to this
sitter and was laid on his head. A voice then loudly said, " Arthur.
Why can't you say something to me ?
" The sitter became agitated
and the sitting had to be closed, and it was not until I pointed it out
later that he remembered that he had himself furnished the name
" Arthur " as being that of his brother.
I am making a point of this particular case because I think it is a
good example of how an inexperienced sitter can so easily be much
impressed for no good reason. This sitter was a medical man, and
I should say well above the average in intelligence.
Now for " foreign- speaking voices." As I have already mentioned
the so-called guide voices were much louder and clearer than the
other voices. The outstanding case of a foreign-speaking voice was
the guide " Christo di Angelo " who spoke loudly in Italian. I think
there is no doubt that some Italian really was spoken by this voice
although, not knowing the language, I cannot personally vouch
for it.
On one occasion a friend of mine whose knowledge of Italian is
considerable but not profound, carried on quite a long conversation
with this voice which said he, " di Angelo," had been born near
Palermo, had been 80 years old when he died, and that had been
44 years previously. My friend translated to us what had been said,
and the trumpet again rose and one detail was corrected—showing
the intelligence at work had been listening.
A seeming attempt was made in this communication to give the
exact locality in which this Italian guide was supposed to have lived
but, as far as I know, nothing has ever been done to try and verify
this statement. It would obviously be difficult to do so after so long,
and even if the statement were verified, the possibility of the medium
having gained information normally about a real personage could
not be ruled out.
There were at least two guide " voices " who were said on occa-
sion to speak in American Indian dialects, but unfortunately no one
125] Report on Some Sittings with Valiantine and Phoenix 415
was ever present who was capable of checking these languages.
Mostly they confined themselves to war whoops and other loud and
terrifying noises.
Several times a voice spoke saying it was " Martin Luther." This
voice, although it spoke in English, was in a way impressive, inso-
much that the words could easily be distinguished and the accent
showed no trace of American, and was indeed quite unlike the
medium's ordinary voice and also unlike the guide " voices."
On my asking this Martin Luther voice whether he had spoken
English during his earth life, he replied, No, he had learnt it since.
He said he had spoken German and Latin. I asked this voice to
speak German to a lady present (the same lady to whom the Russian
had been spoken), and she afterwards assured us it was good German
of an old-fashioned type.1
At one sitting there were present a Dutchman, his wife and
daughter, who had come over specially to sit with Valiantine. They
were, they told me, convinced spiritualists. No voice spoke at this
sitting and they were very much disappointed. The medium then
offered to sit for them again later that day, when I was not able to
be present.
By this later sitting they seem to have been favourably impressed,
but I gathered that four unconnected words of Dutch were all they
claimed to have heard.
A Japanese gentleman, Mr Komai, who had sat previously with
Valiantine at Mr Bradley's house, came three times to my sittings.
At the first a voice spoke telling him, so he afterwards said, that he
should return to see his family in Japan. Actually he had not been
back for fourteen years. Mr Komai was undoubtedly favourably
impressed with what he had heard. At his next sitting no voice spoke
to him, but it is only fair to say that he was told his brother was
waiting to speak. Actually the sitting came to an abrupt end owing
to an electric recording machine with which I was experimenting,
having gone wrong in a particularly noisy fashion.
At his third sitting again no voice spoke to Mr Komai. Few
phenomena occurred that day. We were told the medium had been
overworked and the power was low. A few words were spoken to
a Dane one day. He thought he caught one or two Danish words,
and he then tried German and heard " Grandmother " and " Brother
is here."
The few words I heard spoken in French did not impress me favour-
ably. They were disjointed and badly pronounced.
A voice on two occasions spoke what was said to be Portuguese.
No one present on either occasion knew any Portuguese.
1
Compare with this the almost complete inability to speak German shown
at the Berlin sittings, above, p. 404. Ed.
416 Lord Charles Hope [part
Apart from the question of the gramophone records, with which I
will deal later, these cases complete my experience of foreign
languages spoken at Valiantine's sittings.
The next section includes physical phenomena, seeing in the dark,
daylight sittings, approts and direct writing.
It was impossible to vouch for any of the physical phenomena
owing to the complete lack of control of the medium. The move-
ments of the trumpets, however, were on occasions very impressive
and on one occasion a trumpet spotted with luminous paint seemed
to rise very high and strike something sounding like the ceiling, which
was 11 feet 6 inches from the floor. Sometimes two trumpets were
in the air at the same time.
If the effects were obtained by normal means the medium's sense
of direction must have been exceptionally good. On one occasion
something which felt like a large hand was placed on my head with-
out any preliminary fumbling. Another time I bent forward to set
up a trumpet which had fallen over and having done so I was lightly
touched on the face by something not a trumpet.
The gramophone was slowed down on several occasions when it
had been placed at a considerable distance from the medium's chair,
and on one occasion the table on which the gramophone stood was
moved quite a foot from a position where it would have been very
difficult for the medium to have reached it.
One day a lady brought a large sea shell which she had got in China.
Shells like these, I was told, are sometimes used as horns to blow.
This shell was certainly blown through ostensibly by a Chinese
" spirit." Some of us tried afterwards and could not make a sound
with it, but the medium may have been more skilled.
I did not have sufficient opportunities to test the claim of some of
the voices that they could see in the dark. There was a distinct
resistance to that kind of test as there was indeed to any kind of test.
I had one daylight sitting, but the fact that the small end of the
trumpet was held to the sitter's ear while the medium held his hand
over the big end was not conducive to good observation.
Later, acting on a remark of the medium's, I placed a looking glass
opposite the sitter when Valiantine one day gave daylight sittings to
three of my friends, one after another. These sitters were favourably
impressed although the communications were not of an evidential
nature. Another day a lady who is a keen observer was not favour-
ably impressed. Her account follows :
" Mr V. and I sat and talked for some time about his forthcoming
visit to Italy and other matters. After about five minutes he put the
trumpet to my ear, and after a few seconds asked me if I did not hear
sounds. I then heard gentle murmuiings. I asked various questions,
if I knew the '
spirit' etc., and so on, and got 'yes' quite clearly.
125] Report on Some Sittings with Valiantine and Phoenix 417
At intervals I asked for a name, but never got more than a two-
syllabled murmur. I tried quite genuinely to catch, the name and to
help by keeping the conversation going. Then V. said '
Doesn't it
sound like father '
and I said, '
Yes, I believe it does,' whereupon I
got ' Father '
quite clearly down the trumpet. I went on talking and
was asked to give a message about being happy. I asked who the
message was for but got no name until I suggested it was for Mother,
when at once I got
1
Mother '
quite clearly down the trumpet. I
asked '
Father ' if he was alone and he said no, he was with and
then a double-syllabled murmur. I said I knew names were hard to
get through and found out it was a man who was with '
Father,' but
got no name. I asked various questions and then tried again for the
name. Mr V. suggested the next murmur I got was '
Ada '
(the name
which was right for a lady at our last sitting) but I reminded him
it was a man speaking and so the name did not come through the
trumpet. There seemed no hope of getting more than a murmur
unless I helped, so after a bit I said, '
Is it Harry who is with you ?
'
and at once got the clear reply '
Yes, Harry, he wants to speak to
you.' I then carried on some sort of conversation and was again told
there was a message for me to give. Again the same murmur when
I asked for a name, so after a bit I said, '
It sounds like Morley but I
can't believe you really want to send a message to Morley, so do say
the name very clearly if Morley is right.' At once " Yes, Morley,"
came down the trumpet as clear as a whisper can be. Both Harry
and Morley are pure inventions. I have never heard of either of
them. During the sitting I could see V.'s face in the looking glass but
nearly all the time my view of his mouth was blocked by the wide
end of the trumpet. I said my arm ached, and shifted my position
once, but still failed to get a continuous view of his mouth."
This lady's father was at that time alive and in good health.
After that I got another lady to have a sitting while I was in the
room, and I then pointed out to Valiantine that his hand was not
completely covering the big end of the trumpet and so letting in the
light. I gave him a small bit of black cloth to cover it over with. No
voice was heard by this sitter but only a few indistinct sounds which
might have been caused by the medium's nails scratching the surface
of the trumpet.
The medium seemed to be " off " daylight sittings after that ex-
perience.
There were four so-called apports, but these were quite incon-
clusive.
There were two cases of writing done at sittings held in the dark.
On one occasion a small block of writing-paper was moved, during a
sitting, from the lower ledge of the table on which stood the gramo-
phone and some Oriental characters were drawn on two pages. These
418 Lord Charles Hope [part
were later translated by Mr Komai and read " Ban-Zai " and
" 10,000," " 8 " and " 16th day of the . . . month." The characters,
so he told me, were well formed but some seemed incomplete.
Some days later a similar incident occurred. A page of the same
block of paper, the first sheets of which I had previously numbered
in case they were required for taking notes, was found on the floor
almost covered with Oriental characters.
I had numbered these sheets of paper just before this sitting, and
it seems improbable the medium could have substituted another
similar piece of paper, as the piece used had my numbering on it and
that numbered page was missing from the block. At the same time
this block was the same one that had been used on the previous
occasion and it is just possible that the medium might have secreted
a page from it. The characters, therefore, were probably written in
complete darkness during the sitting. An expert at the British
Museum afterwards told me he did not think he could have done it
himself in the dark, but then of course he had never attempted to do
so, or practised doing so, which the medium might have done.
The translation of these characters ran " Outline of the History
of the Middle Kingdom," which sounds like the title of a book. The
expert looked up a list of Chinese books but could find no such
title.
I must not forget to touch on the important question of whether
or not the " voices " ever overlapped either each other or the normal
voice of the medium. No definite answer can be given. Some people
said " yes," some "no." I thought I heard overlapping two or three
times, but was doubtful. At one sitting one very keen observer
concentrated on that one point and later wrote to me to say he was
sure it had not taken place that day although several people had
remarked on it as having occurred that day.
The special sitting for recording the voices was held in the usual
room in my flat. There were present the medium, Mr and Mrs
Bradley and myself. Six records in all were made by the Columbia
Gramophone Company, but of this number we were only allowed to
choose the four we considered most interesting.
On one record the guide " Bert " sang, and " Blackfoot " and
" Kokuni "—two American Indians—spoke (presumedly) in their
different dialects. On the second record " Confucius " spoke a few
words, and at the end of the record there was a short sentence from
" Dr Barnett."
The next record began with a voice supposed to be my guide
speaking in Hindustani and Sanskrit, and this was followed by
" Christo di Angelo " the Italian guide voice, making a short oration
in Italian. On the fourth record were snatches of song and a sentence
or two from " Shung Wee," another Chinese voice. He was supposed
125] Report on Some Sittings with Valiantine and Phoenix 419
to be a modern Chinese and on one occasion had spoken in rather
unconvincing pidgin English.
A copy of the " Confucius " record was in the possession of Dr
Whymant for some time. He told me he found it impossible to make
a full translation although he thought he could catch a few words here
and there. He seemed to think it took the form of a greeting spoken
in archaic Chinese and he even wrote down provisionally a few
sentences, but I do not feel justified in quoting these as Dr Whymant
assured me at the time that owing to the imperfection of the re-
cording any full translation would be guesswork.
That completes my experiences with Valiantine. I was dis-
appointed at the lack of evidence for survival which the voices had
given me. I was left uncertain whether Valiantine was a genuine
medium or not.
My position was that I had been somewhat impressed by the so-
called physical phenomena, but owing to the complete lack of any
kind of test conditions permitted by the medium, and the complete
darkness insisted upon by him, I had only my impressions to go upon,
and no proof whatsoever that the phenomena in question were
genuine.
II
I will now pass on to some experiences I had with another " voice
"
medium, Mr William Phoenix of Glasgow.
Previous to my Valiantine sittings I had had three sittings with
Phoenix at his house in Glasgow, and had been favourably impressed
by the loudness and clarity of the " voices " and the good accounts
I had heard of this medium's powers from other sitters, although I
had not myself obtained anything of evidential value. I had also
been told he had given satisfactory sittings at the British College of
Psychic Science in London. He was, and is still, I understand, a
professional medium although he also had other employment.
The conditions pertaining at Phoenix's sittings were similar to
those at Valiantine's except that there was no luminous paint on the
trumpet. I made some guarded inquiries from some of Phoenix's
regular sitters and was told he would not submit to " tests," but that
the mental phenomena alone were sufficient to carry conviction.
One of this medium's guides was supposed to be an Italian who
had been an ice-cream vendor in Glasgow. I was assured he had
spoken Italian on occasions and that there had been several other
instances of languages unknown to the medium being spoken at the
sittings.
After reading of Dr Whymant's startling experiences in New York
with Valiantine, and after my subsequent experiences with the same
420 Lord Charles Hope [part
medium in London, I was anxious to see whether Dr Whymant
would have similar experiences with another medium.
Dr Whymant kindly consented to travel to Glasgow and I met
him there, having previously arranged with Phoenix to give us two
sittings. I merely told him I was bringing a friend who was much
interested in " voice " phenomena. It is possible that Phoenix may
have recognised Dr Whymant from having seen a photograph of
him published in connection with the Valiantine sittings in New
York. If so there was no sign of any such recognition.
There were present at this first sitting the medium, his wife and
two lady friends, besides Dr Whymant and myself. I will confine
myself chiefly to reporting what was said to Dr Whymant.
At first there were several attempts by " voices " to speak to him
in English. These were not at all satisfactory—one voice was repre-
sented by a guide voice as having been his wife, who in point of fact
was alive.
A " voice " then spoke, muttering some unintelligible words. This
was greeted as being Phoenix's Hindu guide. I asked that this
" voice " should speak again and suggested that my friend might be
able to understand what was said even if I could not. The " voice
"
and Dr Whymant then spoke in some language I could not
understand.
I will now quote from Dr Whymant's own account. I am
quoting in full that part which concerns the speaking of foreign
languages.
" Suddenly a voice addressed Lord Charles, the '
voice ' of an
Indian guide of the circle. He suggested that the Indian came to me
speaking in his own tongue. The '
voice '
swerved in my direction
and rapped out a sentence which I did not catch. I asked for it to
be repeated, and then came the words, '
Dost Bidam ' (I am a friend).
This was not a repetition of the first sentence. I asked '
Chi-chiz-ast 1
'
(Who art thou?) and the voice replied '
Biradar-Bidam '
(I am thy
brother)—this being a greeting—not intended as a literal statement
of fact. I then asked from what part of the world came the speaker,
and the force failing, caught only the word '
Hind-I . . .
'
The voice
seemed to be that of an Indian attempting to speak a variety of
Persian."
I was naturally encouraged by this result and expressed the hope
to Dr Whymant that at our next sitting we might get better results,
but at the same time I warned him that at this same sitting / had
received a very unsatisfactory communication from a " voice."
At our second Phoenix sitting held two days later (7 September
1927), attempts to speak in foreign languages were again much the
most notable phenomena. I will quote Dr Whymant's own account
from his notes taken during the sitting :
125] Report on Some Sittings with Valiantine and Phoenix 421
From the beginning I was obsessed with a feeling that I had to
speak in Italian ; even when Luke and another voice spoke to me in
English I felt that Italian was on my lips. More voices than before
(5/9/27), addressed me definitely and the voices seemed to come from
under my feet. Not all, of course. Some indeed seemed to originate
from some height above my head. There was much singing and a
few attempted communications which I did not catch. There seemed
an indefiniteness about all the voices on this occasion although there
was a great effort made to indicate something or other. I had some
numbered pages of a writing pad on my knee and from time to time
made notes of the actual words spoken in foreign tongues (I made no
notes of the English communications). Frequently during the
sitting the pencil was tugged very strongly and I noticed two efforts
to get the paper away from me. Once this was heard by the other
sitters (the rustling of the paper as it was suddenly seized).
Towards the end of the sitting a voice spoke in Italian but I could
get nothing from it at all. Although the voices were quite unsatis-
factory in that they told nothing, they definitely gave the impression
of working up to a good conversation of real import when the power
failed. There seems to be little doubt that some real efforts at con-
versation were being made, as the following records of words spoken
will show :
The modern Greek words heard were :
(The Voice) : xoii? elcrde ; How are you 1
(My reply) : Me-rp/w?. T ovo/xa <ra<s ;
Fairly well. What is your
name %
(The Voice) : Evvoeire ; Do you understand ?
(I) : Nat, reAe/w?, iroio? ehe ; Yes perfectly. Who's that ?
(The Voice) : yatpw fiXeTrwv uprt? ; I am happy to see you.
(I) : Evxapia-TU), r ovofia eras ;
I thank you. What is your name ?
(The Voice) : "AXXrjv <popav ; Another time.
It is only fair to say that this voice said several things at the be-
ginning which I did not catch as I was not conscious of the fact that
modern Greek was being spoken.
The Persian voice was very little more explicit than on the
previous occasion (5/9/27). The words easily distinguishable were :
(The Voice) : Safd avurdid. You have brought happiness.
(I) : Ahval-i sherif chi tur act ? How are you ?
(The Voice) : Al Hamdn Vlllah. I thank you. Well
(I) : Ism-i tu chi chiz ast ? What is thy name ?
(The Voice) : 'Eib na-darad. It does not matter.
There were isolated words or short phrases rapidly spoken which
I could not hear. The above takes in all that was heard definitely.
2 v
422 Lord Charles Hope [paet
The Chinese voice was that of a scribe or commentator apparently.
He had little to say. It is impossible to represent in Roman tran-
scription the words used, but my version is as follows :
Is the honourable first-born 1
well ?
Yes, this unworthy one is in good health. What is your honour-
able name ?
This uncultured menial wrote characters for the wise ones and
copied their work. (No name given.)
Is this the voice of him I heard aforetime in a distant city ?
2
No ; he will come again . . . about a moon from this time. . . .
I did not clearly understand. What is your honourable name ?
(No answer.)
A Japanese voice spoke in the modern tongue, but died away as
soon as greetings had been exchanged, and names asked.
(Voice) : Annta loa Donata sama desk ha ? What is your name ?
(I) : Boku was O-bun-shi to moshimasu. Anata no namae wa ?
My name is, 0 Bunshi. What do men call you ?
(Voice) : Watakushi . . . toTcoro in . . . no toki ni . . . . I ... in
(the )
place ... at the time of ... .
The Italian voice said Buona sera but I do not know whether this
was heard generally. I replied with the same greeting and asked Ed
il tuo nome 1 without any result at all. There was some hurried
chatter of which I merely understood enough to know that there was
no name in it. After another buona sera the voice ceased.
Neville Whymant.
Although these Glasgow sittings had not resulted in any communi-
cations of the order of importance of Dr Whymant's experience in
New York, they had apparently established a strong case for the
speaking of languages unknown to the medium.
I thought, therefore, it would have been a pity to leave the ex-
periment unfinished, and so at considerable expense I arranged that
Phoenix should come, together with his wife, to give a longer series
of sittings in London.
These took place in September and October 1927 and were six
in number. Dr Whymant attended four of these. Of these four
sittings Mr Gonnoske Komai attended one and a Mr Yih of the
School of Oriental Studies (a Chinaman) attended the other
three.
1
A polite form of the second person pronoun.
2
This was a test question. I knew the voice was not the same.
125] Report on Some Sittings with Valiantine and Phoenix 423
I will now quote Dr Whymant's account of the first of these
sittings :
After the lights had been put out the Lord's Prayer was said, and
there was much singing.
Lord Charles played several pieces on the gramophone and lights
in the form of balls floated about freely. . . .
A voice then burst in rapidly, speaking so quickly and with
apparent breathlessness, that it was impossible at first to recognise
even the type of speech. Then I recognised it as Chinese, and at the
same moment, Gonnosuhe Komai, sitting almost opposite me, called
out, " Oh yes ! Very clear. That is Chinese all right." I asked him
if he understood anything of what was said, but unfortunately he did
not. The voice was still very hurried and spoke so rapidly that my
questions in Chinese passed unheeded, and I cannot truthfully say
that I gathered anything at all from this voice. It seemed to be
over-anxious to tell me something and probably the keenness of its
desire prevented its being understood.
Shortly after this another voice was heard, and on being ques-
tioned by Komai as to whether it wished to speak with him, gave
three raps. He then spoke in Japanese as follows :
Donata : Who (is it) ? repeated several times.
Molto hakkiri hanashite kudarai : Please speak a little more clearly.
(This also was said twice or_thrice.)
The voice gave the name Oki, but this is all. Komai said he could
get nothing out of what was said. Nor could I understand anything.
Other voices struggled for expression without achieving more than
whisperings and trumpet taps. Then came a voice speaking a queer
idiom ; it sounded almost like a jargon of some kind, and I called out
that it sounded like an Indo-Chinese border dialect—later getting
the impression that it might have been badly spoken Yunnanese.
The voice gave bugle calls of a military nature easily recognised, and
several people suggested that he might have been a soldier.
The word Singgapura (pronounced like that) was repeated several
times and I tried to draw the voice into Malay speech. This failed and
I used one or two dialect forms of the Federated Malay States
languages, also without success. There seemed to be no rapport
between us, and I offer the following notes (on what I think was said)
with great diffidence.
It seemed to me that the voice was that of a Straits Chinese who
had lived in Singapore. He had travelled in Northern India, China,
Burma and some parts of Europe. I distinctly heard the sound
Fa-koo (France), but although I asked a question on this repeatedly,
I could get no answer. This voice also spoke to Komai, but he could
make nothing of it at all. . . .
Neville Whymant.
424 Lord Charles Hope [part
I will quote the part of Dr Whymant's account of the sitting of
3 October which had to do with the speaking of foreign languages :
It seemed, soon after this, as though two voices were talking
together in some foreign tongue immediately in front of me. I tried
hard to gather something from it but could not pick up a single word.
The voices then just died away. Again a voice addressed Mrs A.
who was disappointed. This was followed by an unmistakeable invo-
cation—I have heard it too many times to be mistaken on the point.
It was part of an invocation used in India and Persia and was intoned.
The words were not always distinct but the rhythm and tone were
there. Then a voice spoke in an Indo-Iranian dialect similar to the
Gujarati language, but of its purity or academic accuracy I cannot
speak, as I do not know the language well enough. . . .
After this a very soft voice came, reminiscent, after a time, of one
I had heard in the Valiantine sittings in New York. I listened care-
fully and heard the word '
Odoi.' This is an uncommon surname in
Japanese, so I replied in that language, but was not answered.
Extracts from Dr Whymant's notes on sitting of 4 October 1927 :
Then came a voice speaking in the same type of language as that
mentioned in the notes of the 3 October sitting : a quasi-Persian
idiom which was yet not Persian nor any dialect thereof unless it
were one of the Northern Indian dialects with which I am not
familiar. This voice both spoke and sang, but I could glean nothing
from either activity. Then came a voice speaking Kore-Kure (in
Japanese—this, this) ; and answering in the same tongue I said,
'
What this ?
'
but no satisfactory answer was forthcoming. The
name RissJio which is a Japanese personal name, was given, but again
my inquiries elicited no response.
A peculiar point about the above voices is this. Whenever I
addressed any words at all to these voices using foreign tongues, the
voices began talking again, beginning with the last few syllables I had
used. None but one acquainted with the languages could appreciate
how inappropriate (and occasionally ridiculous) this proceeding is.
Then a voice addressed Mr Yih. He answered but did not under-
stand a single word. He sang a Chinese song reminiscent of the
Chinese theatre to encourage any lurking voices, but his effort was
not rewarded. Then a voice came speaking what at first sounded
like Greek.
I asked: " 'O/uiXeire "EXXrji'iKa " (Do you speak Greek ?), but
could get no intelligible answer beyond the first word which was in
each case
" r
'EAA>;i'(/ca."
Neville Whymant.
125] Report on Some Sittings icith Valiantine and Phoenix 425
This completes Dr Whymant's accounts of his experiences with
Phoenix. Mr Komai had unfortunately not been able to under-
stand any of the apparent attempts to speak to him in foreign
languages, but on the occasion on which he attended, Dr Whymant
did not hear any Japanese spoken.
Unfortunately, try as he might and apparently did, Mr Yih could
not catch a single word of any language except English.
By this time I had become convinced that, at any rate on most
occasions, the medium left his chair before " voices " spoke to the
sitters. I had sat next to the medium on several occasions and had
distinctly heard sounds like a creaking boot. After the sitting at
which I had first heard these sounds I noticed that one of the
medium's boots creaked as he walked. The sounds were similar.
At subsequent sittings I heard this sound on several occasions.
One of my friends also heard it, and one sitter reported being bumped
into by something as though the medium was walking about in the
circle of sitters and had lost his sense of direction. As the full number
of sittings arranged for had been almost completed, I decided to try
and find out definitely whether or not my suspicions were well
founded.
A friend of mine, Mr Noel Jaquin, whose knowledge of finger
prints is very considerable, had been at several of these Phoenix
sittings held in London. It was the same Mr Jaquin who helped
Mr Bradley to test Valiantine with the result already known.
At a previous sitting with Phoenix we had already obtained a
promise from the " voices " to co-operate in an experiment for the
making of fingerprints.
I will now quote from my notes made directly after this final
sitting. A lady whom I shall call Mrs B. was a friend of the medium's
but I feel sure had no part in producing the phenomena and enter-
tained no suspicions of him. I could not have excluded her from the
sitting without the risk of alarming the medium.
The cabinet mentioned in the notes had not been prepared for the
sitting but was in the corner of the room at the back and well to the
left of the medium's chair. It consisted of two curtains across the
corner of the room.
Phoenix Sitting No. 6 and Last.
6 October, 11.30 to 1.45. Conditions—All sitting free, total dark-
ness, and no luminous paint on the trumpets. Left to right : the
Medium (Mr W. Phoenix), Lord Charles Hope (worked gramophone),
Mrs Phoenix, Mr Noel Jaquin, Mrs B., the Medium.
I had already informed Mr Jaquin of my suspicions. He brought
several pieces of smoked paper for imprints and these, with the
426 Lord Charles Hope [part
permission of the medium, were placed on the floor ; the medium
suggested that one which was immediately in front of his chair should
be moved to one side.
While the " Luke " voice was speaking from the middle of the
circle I cautiously put out a folded newspaper and felt that the
medium's chair was empty. I then felt with my hand to make sure.
During the sitting I put my hand quite six times in his chair and about
two-thirds of the way through the sitting, acting on a sudden impulse,
I removed the cushion from the chair. Later, thinking it would be
better to leave things to take their normal course, I placed the
cushion against the front of the chair so that the medium should
think it had fallen accidentally. Later I felt again and found that it
had been moved. . . . About half way through the sitting we heard
movements of the cabinet curtains in the corner behind Mrs B. and
then quite loud soimds as though someone was moving about in the
cabinet. Mrs B. remarked on this, and we all encouraged the
" spirits." I put my hand in the medium's chair while this was going
on and found it empty. No " voices " spoke in the circle while this
was going on. . . . During the sitting a luminous hand which was
seemingly on some flat surface was shown to each sitter in turn, and
we urged that this should be pressed on a piece of smoked paper, but
we were told that " they " had not succeeded in doing this. . . .
" Luke " (the medium's guide) now as usual closed the sitting with
an oration and a well worded prayer, and the medium " came back
"
and the light was put on.
We then found some rather smudged fingerprints on one piece of
paper in the circle, and on another piece of paper in the cabinet the
clear imprint of the toes and ball of a naked human foot. We then
got Mr and Mrs Phoenix and Mrs B. to make their fingerprints on
the other pieces of paper. I then asked Mrs B. to leave the room and
told Phoenix that he had been out of his chair during a great part of
the sitting and said I had felt repeatedly in his chair while the
" voices " were being produced and had also removed the cushion
in his absence. He professed great surprise and said he had been
" under control " all the time and therefore had no idea of what had
taken place. ... I then suggested that he should turn out his
pockets to prove that he had not got any appliances with which to
produce the " psychic " lights (which appeared at each sitting).
He refused this suggestion. . . . After the medium and his friends
had left we found a good fingerprint on the piece of paper on which
the foot imprint had been made, and this imprint, and also one of the
partly smudged imprints on the other paper, coincided with the
medium's own fingerprints made after the sitting. Mr Jaquin in-
formed me after the sitting that at one moment while a " voice
"
was speaking to Mrs B. he had caught hold lightly of the coat tails
125] Report on Some Sittings with Valiantine and Phoenix 427
of the medium who must have thus beeu standing almost facing his
own chair. Later the same day I requested Phoenix to come and
make imprints of his own feet to prove, if possible, their dissimilarity
to the imprint found on the smoked paper. He refused to comply
with my request. Some days later I made a similar request to some
friends of his, but without success.
I have gone to considerable length in describing the results
obtained with Phoenix because in my opinion they tend to show a
certain susceptibility on the part of Dr Whymant to the suggestive
conditions pertaining to seances held in complete darkness.
Relectantly I had to come to the conclusion that Phoenix was at
least in part a fraud.
Could he have been in part a true medium 1 That is the question
we must ask ourselves. Could he in a trance have spoken words of
several languages which he could not normally have known ? Or,
could Dr Whymant who knows so many languages, both ancient and
modern, have been deluded into thinking he heard certain snatches
of conversation coming from a trumpet held near him in complete
darkness ? Could the sounds he heard have been really indefinite
sounds produced by the medium, in the hope that they would be
mistaken for real words ?
I cannot say—but judging from my experience of what sounds I
have heard other people accept as being detailed messages given in
English, whereas to me they seemed only incoherent murmurs
I do not think it is impossible.
In this case, too, we must remember Dr Whymant did not know
what language he might be expected to hear, and that must have
very considerably increased the difficulty of his task.
On the other hand in his sittings with Valiantine in New York,
after the first sitting, he knew that ancient Chinese was the language
he might be expected to hear, and therefore too close a parallel
should not be drawn between his experiences with Valiantine and his
subsequent experiences with Phoenix. Perhaps, too, the startling
nature of the conversations he held with the " Confucius " voice may
have made him more ready to accept such experiences as possible
and so rendered him more liable to self-deception.
THE MEDIUMSHIP OF RUDI SCHNEIDER
By Theodore Besterman
The time lias not yet come for a critical account of Rudi Schneider's
mediumship, since it is still in active progress, but the publication of
an important report of recent sittings in Paris with this medium
makes it desirable briefly to survey his previous history. This is
done below, and a review of the French report follows in the second
section.
I
According to Rudi Schneider's own account the mediumship of
his elder brother Willy was accidentally discovered in 1918. The
father of these two mediums, Josef Schneider, is a compositor in the
little Austrian frontier town of Braunau, about 70 miles due east
from Munich. Officers of the Braunau garrison came to the printing
works at which he was and still is employed, to buy sheets of paper.
They explained that these were wanted for planchette-writing. In
this way members of the Schneider family were led to try planchette-
writing for themselves, and it was discovered that Willy succeeded
in producing results under the purporting Control of " Olga Lintner."
Gradually various physical phenomena developed and early in 1919
Willy first went into trance. One evening in March 1
no phenomena
occurred and Olga said that she wanted Rudi, at that time eleven
years of age. He was brought in and phenomena began. Since that
time Rudi has been a medium, producing phenomena similar to
those of Willy, who secured a new Control, Mina, while Rudi took
over Olga.2
Rudi's trance resembles Willy's in every respect. So
far Rudi's own account.3
In 1919 Baron von Schrenck-Notzing first sat in Braunau and no
doubt then made the acquaintance of Rudi. But for the next few
1
According to Mr Harry Price, Rudi Schneider (1932), p. ix, this occurred in
November 1919, though possibly a different sitting is referred to. Elsewhere
(Journ. Amer. S.P.R. [1926], xx. 20, 642), Mr Price gives 1921 as the date of
the beginning of Rudi's mediurnslup. According to Captain F. Kogelnik, in
Journ. Amer. S.P.R. (1926), xx. 146, Rudi was only eight years of age in 1919.
2
This point is confirmed by Baron von Schrenck-Notzing, Materialisations-
phaenomene 2
(1923), p. 548, according to whom, however, the beginning of
mediumship in Rudi, and the transfer of the Control, occurred when Rudi was
thirteen, that is, two years later.

[part 125] The Mediumship of Rudi Schneider 429
years the Baron was occupied by the study chiefly of the medium-
ship of Willy Schneider. Reports of his investigation of Rudi have
not yet been published (though it is understood that records of 88
sittings are in the possession of Baroness von Schrenck-Notzing),1
but his regular sittings with this medium do not appear to have
begun until about 1924. In the meanwhile Rudi had given a great
many sittings to others, both at Braunau and elsewhere. He first
went to Vienna at the end of 1922,2
and for some years thereafter
gave numerous sittings in various parts of Austria, before spirit-
ualistic societies, in haunted houses, and privately, including a series
under the conduct of Herr Erich von Czernin-Dirkenau,3
as well as
at the (since defunct) Metapsychologisches Institut.4
I will now give a summary account of the specific sittings of which
printed reports are known to me (ignoring newspaper accounts).
On 26 January 1924 Rudi gave a sitting in the house of Major von
Baranski, in Vienna, Among those present were Professors Karl
Przibram and Stefan Meyer. They were not impressed by the
phenomena and thought that they could imitate them by normal
means. They apparently did so in February, with Professor Przi-
bram as medium.5
This was announced in the newspapers as an
exposure, but it is hardly necessary to point out that, failing a
detailed account of the conditions at both sittings, the incident is of
no particular significance.
According to Prof. Meyer, Rudi was also exposed at this time by
Dr Lothar Lenkei.6
No particulars are available.
There is an affirmative report of four sittings between 21 and 27
July 1924, at Braunau, at which a variety of phenomena occurred.7
On 6 September 1924 Rudi gave a sitting at Baron von Schrenck's
house in Munich, of which we have two reports, one non-committal 8
and the other rather aggressively affirmative.9

430 Theodore Besterman [part
There is a brief affirmative report of a sitting in October 1924 in
the bouse of Prof. E. Hoffmann in Vienna.1
In tbe autumn of 1925 Mr Dingwall witnessed some " interesting
and suggestive phenomena " in Braunau.2
To this period possibly belongs an undated sitting, reported anony-
mously, but introduced and therefore presumably authenticated by
Dr Hans Rosenbusch. In this sitting an object had been secretly
painted, it was levitated, and the medium's hand afterwards bore
traces of the paint. 3
In March 1926 Rudi was in Prague, where he gave five sittings. 4
During a sitting on the 21st an interesting form of control was tried.
The medium's right hand was tied to the left hand of his right-hand
neighbour with a silk cord bearing three luminous balls, and his left
hand was controlled in a similar way. Unfortunately we are not told
how and in what position the cord was tied to the medium's hand,
nor given the names of the sitters. Numerous phenomena occurred.5
On 28 and 29 April there were two sittings at Braunau, of which
we have two more or less independent affirmative reports.6
Between 30 July and 19 August 1926 Mr W. J. Vinton had six
sittings with Rudi in Braunau, four at the house of the Schneiders
and two at the Hotel Mittendorfer. In his report he attributes the
phenomena to conspiracy between various members of the family.7
This allegation was replied to by Baron von Schrenck,8
whose re-
marks were criticised by Graf von Klinckowstroem.9
In the spring of 1927 we have another report of a sitting, this time
non-committal.10
Dr Prince had ten sittings, 12-24 August 1927, at the home of

Between 1 and 6 September be
bad tbree further sittings at Braunau.2
Dr Prince's conclusion is
expressed by him in these words : "I could not truthfully express
any belief in the genuineness of the phenomena." 3
His report
aroused much interest. It is only necessary to mention a detailed
criticism by Dr Gerda Walther,4
the replies of Dr Prince 5
and Herr
Lambert,6
which Dr Walther in turn answered,7
and a commentary
by Graf Klinckowstroem.8
We have a superficial account of an unspecified number of sittings
in the autumn of 1927 at Baron von Schrenck's.9
Unfortunately the
writer was as much impressed by the fraudulent Oscar Schlag as by
the Schneider brothers.
On 11 October 1927 Mr Bird had a sitting in Braunau, of which he
gives us a detailed account.10 He attributes the phenomena to
fraudulent conspiracy and this conclusion led to a discussion with
Miss May Walker,11
Major Kalifius,12
and Dr Gerda Walther. 13
We have a brief account of a sitting in Braunau on 29 April 1928,
directed to show that Mr Vinton's theories are untenable.14
During October 1928 four representatives of the S.P.R. had several
completely negative sittings at Baron von Schrenck's.15
Later in the same month I had three further sittings there, which
were also entirely negative. 16

432 Theodore Besterman [part
On 21 March 1929 Mr Price had a fairly successful sitting in the
home of Rudi's friend Karl Amereller, in Munich.1
Between 12 and 22 April 1929 Rudi gave five sittings at the
National Laboratory of Psychical Research, London. At these
sittings Baron von Schrenck-Notzing's method of electrical control
of the medium was extended to all the sitters.2
Unfortunately this
method is very defective and deprives the series, and that next
mentioned, of much, though by no means of all, their value. This
method of control was criticised by Count Perovsky-Petrovo-
Solovovo 3
and Dr Woolley,4
and defended by Professor Schiller 5
and Mr Price.6
Between 14 November 1929 and 20 January 1930 Rudi gave a
further series of twenty-one sittings at the National Laboratory.7
Mr Price's book includes various independent reports, of which only
two need be mentioned, those of Captain F. McDermott 8
and of
Lord Charles Hope.9
. Dr Brack has published some theoretical con-
siderations arising out of these sittings. 10
Between 10 October and 14 November 1930 Rudi gave a series of
sixteen sittings at the Institut Metapsychique, Paris, where he also
spent the whole of 1931, with intervals, giving seventy-four further
sittings. These ninety sittings form the subject of the valuable
report 11
which is reviewed in the following pages.
On 31 July 1931 Mr Price and others had a sitting at Braunau.
All the doors and windows were sealed and numerous phenomena
occurred. 12

125] The Mednimship of Rudi Schneider 433
II
The sittings at the Institut began very properly with a series
of preliminary sittings "pour voir." Nothing of special interest
occurred during the first thirteen sittings, with the following excep-
tion. At the third sitting Dr Osty observed coming towards the
seance-table from the direction opposite to that of the medium, a
thick greyish fog about 30 centimetres wide. When this fog reached
the edge of the table top the table moved slowly for more than 20
centimetres. Dr Osty, bent over this phenomenon, clearly observed
that the moment the table stopped moving the fog-like mass became
instantly invisible (p. 25).
During the fourteenth sitting was first accidentally made the dis-
covery which eventually directed the entire course of this series of
sittings. For purposes of control Dr Osty (for the sake of brevity
I will abstain from saying each time Dr Osty and his collaborators)
had installed an apparatus which will be familiar to most readers
from its use during the recent international exhibitions at Burlington
House. Across the space to be guarded an infra-red (and hence
invisible) ray is directed at a suitable cell, which is placed in an
electrical circuit with, for instance, a bell, in such a way that if the
invisible ray ceases to impinge on the cell, as by the interposition of
one's hand, the circuit is completed and the bell rings. The same
apparatus can be connected with, for instance, a camera and flash-
light, so that an interruption of the beam causes the flashlight to be
set off, thus exposing a previously prepared plate. Such a ray Dr
Osty caused to be directed over the seance-room table, on which a
handkerchief had been placed with a view to obtaining telekinetic
phenomena. It would thus have been impossible to obtain normal
access to the handkerchief without interrupting the ray and thus
revealing the fraud or accident.
Under these circumstances was held the fourteenth sitting, the
cell being connected with the photographic apparatus. On two
occasions during this sitting two sets of photographs (four cameras
were in use) were automatically taken by the interruption of the
infra-red ray. But when the eight negatives were examined nothing
in the least abnormal was observed on them. In other words, the
cause of the production of the instantaneous photographs was non-
photographable. The conclusion was inevitable that on these two
occasions a " substance " had been present on the table, which
" substance," though not photographable, was capable of absorbing
or refracting not less that 30% of the infra-red ray, this being the
degree of absorption or refraction necessary to put the apparatus
into operation (pp. 31-5). For the sake of brevity only absorption
434 Theodore Besterman [part
will be spoken of ;
but, in fact, probably both, refraction and
absorption were at work.
This important discovery naturally opened the way to various
lines of investigation. The first was to ascertain whether the absorp-
tion of the infra-red ray was really due to the presence of a non-
photographable substance. This was achieved by connecting the
cell with a bell which would ring during the whole time that 30% or
more of the ray was absorbed. The photographic apparatus was
placed in a self-contained circuit so that a flash could be made at will.
During the fifteenth sitting, under these conditions, the bell rang
repeatedly for various periods up to 100 seconds. Photographs were
taken during these periods (that is, during the interruption of the
infra-red ray), without anything abnormal being recorded on the
plates. Another point was established during this sitting : that the
medium has a degree of control over the entry of the substance into
the ray. He repeatedly announced that the force (as he calls it)
was about to operate, and these announcements were usually
followed by ringing (pp. 36-41).
The next step was to register graphically the disturbances of the
infra-red ray. This was achieved in the following manner. In the
electric circuit producing the ringing there was inserted a small
electric lamp which was directed at a narrow slit in a box, behind
which slit there passed continuously a roll of photographic paper.
Accordingly, whenever 30% or more of the infra-red beam was
absorbed a circuit was completed which at the same time rang a bell
and lit the lamp, which thus produced a line on the photographic
paper. This amplified apparatus was put into use in the sixteenth
sitting, and the previous results were confirmed. Again an addi-
tional point was established : that the substance in question is
invisible, for a part of the sitting was held in good red light, during
which the usual disturbances of the infra-red ray occurred without
anything been seen (pp. 41-8).
I now propose to pass over a long series of sittings, during which
various experiments were conducted, some satisfactory, others in-
conclusive, with a view to localising the substance, measuring the
duration of its presence in the ray, and its density or volume, study-
ing the influence on it of various kinds of light, and the mental con-
trol over it of the medium. The account of these experiments
should be read at pages 51-110 of the report under review.
I proceed to the experiments in which it was discovered that the
substance does not usually enter into the infra-red ray, absorb a
certain percentage of it, and remain constant, but rather that,
during its presence in the ray, the substance as a rule oscillates very
rapidly. This was established by the use of a sensitive galvano-
meter, which records minute changes in the electric current set up
125] The Mediumship of Rudi Schneider 435
by the absorption of the infra-red beam. It was found that the
oscillations of the substance in the infra-red ray range from 120 to
420 per minute (pp. 111-6).
Next a pneumograph was installed to measure and record the
medium's rate and volume of respiration. The volume showed
nothing very exceptional. The rate of respiration, which, even
without instruments, must have struck everyone who has sat with
Rudi, showed itself to be very remarkable. Whereas Rudi's ordinary
rate of respiration is 12 to 14 per minute (which is quite normal), in
trance the rate is usually between 120 and 300 per minute, rising as
high as 350. These two instruments, measuring the rate and vibra-
tion of the substance in the infra-red ray and Rudi's rate of respira-
tion, were then connected with a single recording apparatus, so that
they became available on one roll as parallel graphs. This led to a
very striking discovery : that the rate of vibration of the substance
in the infra-red ray is always exactly double the medium's rate of
respiration. And as each respiratory cycle comprises two muscular
acts (inspiration and expiration), it follows that the vibration of the
substance in the infra-red ray synchronises with the medium's
muscular action in respiration (pp. 117-30). This fact clearly opens
the way to a vast field of research.
I have so far said nothing about the evidential standing of these
results, nor do I propose to say much. MM. Osty describe at length
in their report the precautions taken against fraud and accident (as
by the use of a fixed screen between medium and sitters on the one
hand and the apparatus on the other), and it is quite clear that fraud
in the ordinary sense may be ruled out. There remains the possi-
bility that Dr Osty and his collaborators are engaged in a fraudulent
conspiracy. I have carefully examined the report under review from
this point of view and I have also had the opportunity of inspecting
the apparatus in situ and of putting a series of questions to Dr Osty.
As a result I am quite satisfied that even if Dr Osty and his colla-
borators were engaged in a fraudulent conspiracy (an assumption
it is a little difficult to discuss seriously) they would not have been
able, under the conditions of these sittings, to reproduce the results
obtained. To take only one example, it would appear to be to all
intents and purposes impossible for the ordinary person to maintain
for hours on end (with short intervals) a rate of respiration in the
average fifteen times greater than normal. In congratulating MM.
Osty on this contribution of capital importance to the study of para-
physical phenomena, I should like to thank them and Mile Galloy,
who took the notes at the sittings, for the kind and courteous way
in which they answered all my questions.
If it is not improper to end on a personal note, I should like to put
it clearly on record, as I have not hesitated to express myself in
436 Theodore Besterman [part 125]
print on several occasions in terms very critical of all paraphysical
phenomena, that I am satisfied, failing the discovery by the investi-
gators of unforeseen circumstances, that the medium Rudi Schneider
did during the sittings under review extrude under partial mental
control an invisible and non-photographable substance capable of
partly absorbing and/or refracting an infra-red ray and of oscillating
in it at a rate double that of his rate of respiration. At the same
time, in view of the revolutionary nature of the discovery, it would
be as well to suspend a final judgment until MM. Osty have had
an opportunity of completing their investigations, and until the
necessary control experiments have been carried out.
