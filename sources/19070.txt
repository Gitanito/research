how many people had a flying dream were
you it&#39;s like full color and you&#39;re
flying along alright that&#39;s your astral
body and then the Mystics culture astral
body it&#39;s actually part it&#39;s it&#39;s part
and parcel woven into your physical body
but you can have experiences where it
separates and you can travel through
that modality so they&#39;re places other
dimensions and this has been done for
thousands of years there&#39;s many many
accounts in the literature about people
doing this and many people will confuse
that with their actual physical body
because it looks very similar in shape
and size but then within that astral
body is the sort of the essence of your
yourself your thought essence and then
within that is pure consciousness so if
you look at it every single individual
human being has folded within them all
the dimensions of the cosmos so when
people say how do I explore and find
these other dimensions I said there&#39;s
already folded within you they&#39;re there
which is that we you just need to have
someone explain that that&#39;s what that is
so anyway so this military this
skunkworks guy that Lockheed skunkworks
was very happy to finally figure out
what happened but then we had this
discussion and I said you know this
hasn&#39;t you know really profound
implications for you understanding
what&#39;s going on at dreamland MOC and you
know what dreamland MOC is dream okay so
it said I have I brought with me the
thing I put together when Obama got
elected the very first document in this
this briefing is the one from Nellis Air
Force Base you know what the public hall
area 51 nobody calls it that and it
talks about the dreamland MOC in it
dreamland and all the different
different compartments out at that
facility and the reason there was an
area called dreamland is that when the
pilots who are piloting these
anti-gravity devices and they were
taking them to the edge of the crossing
point of light
all right to the right to the edge of
going beyond the light barrier
resonantly there is this phenomenon of
beginning to dematerialize and you find
that you have shifted your body and the
craft and everything in it and it feels
like a lucid dream when you&#39;re awake in
a lucid dream and that&#39;s why it was
called dreamland military operating
center MOC and a lot of people always
wonder how they got dreamland so the now
you know and but the this is something
that if you begin to look at if you do
an ethnography of different cultures for
example the aboriginals in Australia
where they have something called dream
time and I know a man who worked for O&amp;I
officer Naval Intelligence and State
Department and has covered with State
Department was really oh and I and he
went over there to study this and he
went out into the outback is back in the
70s of thing and he kind of embedded
himself with a group of aboriginals who
were still in touch with that ability
and they were talking to him about
dreams so you know one night they you
know were in some encampment and they
were very nomadic went to sleep and one
of the members of the tribe one of the
Aboriginal so the next morning said oh
well I had a very lucid and in the dream
I met some of so-and-so I don&#39;t know the
person&#39;s name and we&#39;re going to we need
to walk did it and meet at whatever time
here and of course this guy who is a
state department / naval intelligence
person studying this weird high
strangeness didn&#39;t quite believe it and
so they started trekking trekking Trek
and sure enough at the exact place and
time they he met this person who and
they didn&#39;t have cell phones nothing and
it just meant and he said this is you
know so it was when they think for this
is their normal state and many African
tribes have described doing this and
Native American peoples and you know
they call them fears or visionaries but
it&#39;s really does just the capability of
the conscious
mind to be disciplined who in the dream
state wait to the sleep state to awaken
into this dream and then be in control
while you&#39;re having it that&#39;s the lucid
part and begin to explore and you can
explore things in this world or other
worlds that way now really what we do
when we do the Close Encounters of the
fifth kind protocols is that we&#39;re going
into deep meditation and doing it
consciously and we&#39;re not going to sleep
well some people go to sleep because
we&#39;re also 2:00 in the morning
but we&#39;re doing this and through a
technique a meditative technique and a
protocol which you know you can all use
and and practice and practice makes
perfect I&#39;ll tell you you need to
practice it for its really work
effectively but the concept is what you
need to understand well how does it work
well if you&#39;re talking about connecting
to an interstellar civilization they may
or may not be in the area and not in
this linear dimension maybe their D
materialized and they&#39;re hovering over
the white house could be why not who
would detect it nobody were detectives
shifted far enough out of this dimension
but it could pop into view instantly so
it&#39;s not just that they&#39;re traveling
faster than the speed of light they can
be shifted beyond the speed of light and
be quote stationary but kind of
superimposed around this space but
beyond 3d space does that make sense
so it could be in this room it could be
anywhere no the effect it becomes
something that doesn&#39;t make a lot of
sense to people unless they understand
the basis basic concepts I&#39;m sharing now
and then you say well what happens when
it&#39;s only partially here so let&#39;s say
there&#39;s a spacecraft and it&#39;s not quite
3d but it&#39;s near but it&#39;s shifting it&#39;s
bumping up against the fabric of
space-time well this is where you get
all kinds of epiphenomenon
all kinds of other phenomenon such as
electromagnetic signals coming through
our systems that we detect a sphere that
floats right by us out in the desert
which happened to Joshua Tree a few
years ago stopped and we heard four
voices speaking in the desert and clear
air empty way at night scopes and then
all of a sudden we took a photograph and
here&#39;s this extraterrestrial all Bisou
who&#39;s from the andromeda galaxy
who&#39;s there waving it&#39;s on the website
okay that&#39;s how that happened but it
actually so the understanding of this
it&#39;s really key to going out and doing
the contact protocols because you&#39;re
using consciousness but you&#39;re also
using thought and electromagnetic
systems and all of this is coming
together in a nexus and there can be all
degrees of the manifestation or how
something materializes it can be 3d
where you really would bump into it
solid or it may look like it&#39;s 3d but
you could walk right through it
wonderful story from Altus Air Force
Base of a friend of ours who lives out
in the mountains he worked for the Air
Force back in the 60s and he was a guard
at a nuclear bomb squadron out in
Oklahoma and if you read his account
it&#39;s very interesting because there was
a roughly Chevron or triangular shaped
object that was cobalt blue gorgeous
that came in two and they were
investigating our nuclear capabilities I
think this was in 1968 I have to look it
up but it&#39;s in the testimony you can
look but whether it was interesting is
that he said it was translucent cobalt
blue it wasn&#39;t solid but you can see the
shape of it but it wasn&#39;t fully like
that that makes sense so it moved over
and of course they have what they call
the hot areas that are marked off in red
no one can go into his hot areas except
the pilots for the nuclear
bombers and equities were hot ready to
go they were kept ready to go all the
time in those days and we sell some that
are hot ready to go but the hot areas
were and they had sensors
electromagnetic sensors well as this
thing moved across that area it set the
sensors off so even though it wasn&#39;t 3d
totally physical it visually you could
see this outline of this cobalt blue
ship and it was enough in this dimension
to put off electromagnetic fields that
the electronic sensors went off which
ended up being a disaster because they
went to a full alert and had to scramble
those Jets and move them off the base
which is what happened but the craft was
never 3d fully 3d does it make sense so
many times people will see something and
they&#39;ll go well I saw it I&#39;m not sure
and in fact that&#39;s how this guy
approached me I&#39;m not sure what I and I
said we just described it don&#39;t
editorialize it and he described I said
well I know exactly what that is that
was a craft of that shape and dimension
that was still shifted its molecular and
atomic structure resonant field was
still shifted high enough that it wasn&#39;t
totally 3d but you could see the glow
and outline of it kind of like an astral
body or ghost cool stuff oh there&#39;s too
much information too quickly okay so
we&#39;re going to have a whole hour and a
half a question and answer for later
anyway so make notes on your little
tablets or whatever you want to do if
you have questions that come to your
mind the reality is when we&#39;re observing
ETS their physical bodies can also do
the same thing so if you look at this et
we call bu that appeared at Joshua Tree
National Park we&#39;re probably going to do
a week training there in April if you
want to come we go to this place it&#39;s
amazing in this heart of this 800,000
acre park and was that with the naked
eye nothing was seen now the ears could
hear four
or et speaking oh no what language they
were speaking Andromedan I don&#39;t know
but when the person took the photo Raven
a member of our team took the photo she
get she just held her breath and had the
butt open for three or four seconds and
here is this glowing their field of
energy and this being standing there
turned like this waving at us and on the
top of his head if you look very
carefully is what looks like a yarmulke
it&#39;s not I don&#39;t think he&#39;s Jewish
you might be there&#39;s a rabbi from
Andromeda no but but it&#39;s this thick
it&#39;s about this it looks about that
thick and it&#39;s a white and it&#39;s a
basically a teleportation the assisting
device so it holds that field so their
physical body can phase in and out of 3
D or 5 day 10 D whatever resonantly
shifting makes sense I&#39;m looking around
see if I&#39;ve lost everyone yet because
understanding all of this I&#39;m trying to
give examples of things that are really
big lessons to understand what you&#39;re
gonna go out under the stars with your
team in Largo or wherever or California
or wherever you&#39;re from now the other
more fascinating part of this is that
interstellar civilizations utilize what
I call coherent thought thought
emanating from a deep level of quiet
mind that&#39;s very directional very
specific the way we would utilize a
laser and a laser disc or a fiber optic
system with lasers or you know a laser
tracking system
you
you
