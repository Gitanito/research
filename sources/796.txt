HE Holy Ghoft tells
us, ASis xi. 47. Tha^
Lord added daily
Place of Holy Scrip-
ture fuiEcient to ground that Arti-
cle, whereby we conftantly profefs
to believe The Holy Catholick Church
;
pr, as it is in the Nicene Greedy
One Catholick and Apofiolick Church.
For this Text clearly teaches us
thefe Three Things,
[a] 1. lliat

1
.
That there Is a Church.
2. That this Church is but One,
that there is not Another. And,
3. That we muft be of that
Church to be fav'd.
The Difficulty is, What this
Church is ? A Difficulty found out
by the Genius of evil Men, who
being not contented with what is
reveaPd in God's own Book, have
fought out many Inventions, and
written Cart-loads of Books, more
capable of diftraclipg Thoufands,
than of direfling One Man in the
Right Way to Heaven.
As for my Part, I think to fee
plainly (and without much to do)
this Churchy in God's Holy and In-
fallible Wordy that Word, to tphichy

that Jefus Chrifly and Jefus Chrifi
Alone, is the Way^ the Truths and.
the Life: I fee there a Society of
Men profefling to Believe in Him,
having Communion together in the
Ufe and Participation of" all and
every one of the Ordinances which
Himfelf hath Inftituted to thatPur-
pofe : And thefe Ordinances, ac-
cording to the Letter of their In-
ftitution, are adminiftred by Hands
rightly Ordained thereunto ; For
no Man taketh upon him this Of*
ficCy but he that is Called^ as Aaron
was. So that this Church is One, be-
caufe the Members thereofhave One
and the fame Faith in the Holy Je-
fus, and their Communion is in
tht Partaking of thefame Ordinances^
which are all of his Inftitution,

And above all Things, Let us be
well fatisfied, that the God with
whom we have to do, is not only
the Eternal God, without Begin-
ning or End; not only the Al-
mighty God, who doth whatfoever
pleafes him, and hath made all
Things ; not only the infinitely
wife God, who ordereth all things
rightly and juftly, and hath creat-i
ed nothing with a Capacity to op-
pofe his Will. But let us alfo con-
Jider well, and never forget, that
our God is Ens perfe ExiflmSy a
Spirit who hath his Being from,
Himfelf, and is All-fufficient to
Himfelf ; who as he hath created
All Things of Nothing, fb he can
reduce them to Nothing when he
will, and his Hand can never be
Ihortned j he can create Thdufands

out Help, or even the Concurrence

whereas we cannot but know and
acknowledge that our Sins are Pro-
vocations enough, and our felves

Judgments he thinks fit to inflift
upon us.
Another Thing is abfolutely ne-
celiary. That our God may have
bis Due, and be truly glorified by
us, tho' his unworthy Servants, and
that is, that we hold faft and perfe-
vere in the Profeffion of our holy
Chriftian Faith, and be well forti-
fied againft all ArIan and. Socinian

Chriftian Religion is, that Jeftts

Only Mediator and Redeemer promifed
by the Prophets ; which is not proved
by a ftronger Argument, than that
which is formed from the Meffage

Saviour by two of his Difciples^
and Christ's Anfwer to him,

Men do not make fufficient Reflec-
tion upon that Place, as this Book
doth ; that our Saviour takes no
Notice of his calling out Dxraons,
which St. John^s Difciples had feea
him do ; for by this it is evident,
that this Cafting-out, was the Cur-

JFurther, that all Things are of him, and

"that it is a common Opinion received of
'all Men, that all Things are of God : As
for him, he believes that there is but one
God, who perfeveth all Things-
It fhould be noted, that tho^ Plutarch
^fpeaks of two, yet it doth not appear
"that his Opinion was that thefe two
Gods were equally fupreme, forhimfelf
called one D^mon^ and finds a vaft di&
ference betwixt the great Gods and the
D^mom ; for in the fame Treatife he af-
firms, that what the Fable relates of
OJioris 2ind Typho did happen neither to the
Gods, nor to Men, but to fome great
Daemons whoproved ftronger than Men
:
and

and yet their Nature is not purely di^
vine, but compounded of a fpiritual and
corporeal Being : whereupon he declares
the Opinion of PUtOy who faith, that
the Daemons are between the Gods aad
Men ; and that Ifts and Ofiris had been
changed from good Demons into
Gods, becaufe of their Vertues. Plutarch
doth not admit of two Principles only,
but puts a third betwixt them, and fay
that they called the good one Oromazes^
the evil Arma^inSyZnd tbo third Mithres
:
He tells us farther, that this Oppofitioh
betwixt two Principles, is found only in
this lower V/orld, under the Moon ; that
thefe contrary Powers are not equal, and
the befl is the ftrongeft. : He quotes ftV
mer, who c^lh Jupiter the Mafter, the
Governor, the Lord of the whole

owns one God, that rules and governs
the whole World ; and in his Difcourfe

this Doctrine to Socrates. ' Love, faith
' Diotimus to Socrates^ is a great Dsemon,
^ and every Dasmon is betwixt God and
^
Mortal Man, and his Office is to in-
^ terpret betwixt both, and to carry
^ from Men their Prayers and their Sa-
^ crifices ; and from Gods, Commands
^
and Rewards : And by this Channel we
^
have all that concerns Prediflions, vSa-
^ crificesj Inchantments, the ArtofDivi-
f nation and Magick : for God doth not
^ communicate himfelf unto Man, bun
^ all the Communication is by the Media-
f tion of Demons, and by them the
^ Gods fpeak to Men, whether when
' they areawake, or when they areafleep.
Vlutarch fays, that to take away Daemons,
is to take away the Communication be-
tween the Gods and Men ,-
that they^
believe not that the Gods are prefent
at their Sacrifices, neither do they take
notice of them perfonally, but that Bu-
finefs is committed to the Minifters of
the Gods, i/ic. the Daemons ; that not
the Gods, but the Demons did prefide
in the Oracles^ that it is fit we fiiould
believe the Gods are wholly freed from
^
'
all
i8 ^Tk^eaTise
all Commerce with Things on the Earth :
Yea it was a Daemon named Phcebus who
fpoke in the Oracle at Delphos. Finally
he tells us, that he hath taken away the
4^rt of Divination from the Gods, to
appropriate it abfolutely to the Djsmons.
It is alfo the Opinion of Afuleius^ in the
fore-cited Place, wherein he attributes
to Dssmons all the Miracles that are
wrought, all the Prophefies of Things to
come, and all Sacrifices.
That if the People oflyjlra cryed out,
feeing a Miracle done by the Apoftles,
that the Gods become like. Men^ were come
4own to ^^^Wjthere were no reafon to think
that they (pake of the Celeftial Gods 5

higheft part of the Air, were alfo called

Oracles ceafed, ?7. 8, 16. Ifis and 0/?w^
n. 12. That every Daemon, did bear
the Name of that Celeftial God, whofe
Minifter he was. The Philofophers like-
wife attributed to Damons whatfoever
the Poets faid of the Gods, coming
xlown upon the Earth ; and Plutarch quot?

eth Pythagoras^ Xemcrates and Crijippus
for it, as holding the fame Opinion. Plato
in Timeo faith, that Saturn^ Jupiterj Jtmoj
and the reft were Dgemons, and fpeaks
of their being begotten. Trifmegijlus in
Jfclepius faith. That ther6 is an Admi-
niftrator between Heaven and Earth,
whom we fcall 'Jupiter \ and that there is
another Jupiter Plutonius^ who hath Do-
minion over the Earth, and the Sea, and
who feeds Animals and Plants, and pla-
ces both thefe Jupters under the So-
vereign God. It may be faid, that the
Apdftles Miracle feemed {6 great to the
People of hjpa^ that it rnade them raife
up their Thoughts immediately to the
Celeftial Gods, and to call for Sacrifices,
which the Prieft did not oppofe ; their
Bufmefs 5 being to keep the People in
their blind Devotion ; but from thence
no Conclufion can be drawn againft
what we read of the Doftrine com-^
monly held among the Heathen.

Generals of his Armies. Origen in his firfl:
Book againft Celfus faith, that Men
ilipuld not pray to the Sun, the Moon,
the Stars, nor yet to the Geleftial
Angels, that are more certain: But
it is Origen that fpeaks, who hath
fpoken nothing of Celfus before ; but
he only blamM the '^ews for Worfliip-

That the Demons had

THE conftant OpLaion of the Hea-
then about Daemons, was that
they had been Men, and for their ex-
cellent Virtues and eminent Qiialities,
which they fhew'd whilft they were
lapon Earth, were thought worthy to
be taken up, and be made Partakers of
fuch Portion of a Divine Thing, as in-
abled them to be Mediators, Interpre-
ters, and Tranfafltors in all manner of
BufinelTes betwixt the Gods and Men :
Tho' the PUtonicians did believe a kind
of Daemons that had never been Men,
yet they believ'd likewife, that the Souls
of great Men were glorify'd after there
Death, and became Daemons. (^) J^uleius

* were that fort of Daemons who had
* been formerly in Human Bodies. But
^ that there is another kind of Demons,
* Nobler and more Excellent, which
* were never bound with the Bonds
'
of a Body.' Take notice of this of
Plato : His Dialogue intitled Cratjlus^ was
composM to fhew the Signification of
Words, and how they agree with the
Things themfelves. Socrates a£ls the part
ofa Judge^ hQtWQQnHermoge??esy Pythagoras

that \vhich makes me believe it, is be-

^ Are honeft Men any thing elfe but

ly, they whom the ancient i?(3w^;^/
named Medioximi^ vCrhofe Quality, Power
and Habitation were below that of cele-
flial Gods, and above that of Men. But
there he makes ho Diftindion of Damons^
and all that he fays will not make us be-
lieve otherwife, but that be meant thofe
Souls of Men which (m his Opinion) be-
ing feparated from their Bodies, became
D^mons^ being rais'd up to that micfdle
Nature betwixt the Gods and Men,
which he calls properly Damonsy and to
whontl
27
of Spirits.
whom he aifo gives the Name of Gods.
It's true, he likewife allows the Name
pf DAtnon to Saturn^ Rea^ Jupiter^
Junoj and others that were accounted
celeftial Gods ; ^ we muft obferv^e,
that the moft common Opinion wast
that thofe Gods had been Men, and that
the fame was conftantly believ'd of
them ; which Vluurch faith pf Jfis and
Ofirisy of Hercules and Bacchus^ viz. that
of Damons they had been made GW/>
and that the Worfliip renderM to them
was a mixed Worfhip of that of the
Gods^ and that of Demons. Plato in
in like manner calls D^mon the Soul of
a Man^ even before it be out of the Bodj$
with refpefl: to that Excellency that
makes him capable of becoming a D^-
mo^y after his Separation from the Body-
All this perfuades me that Plato hdk^jQd
Ibut one fort of Damons^ properly fo cal»
led, and what I have not^d of him jufti-
fies that he own'd, tha| all thofe D^;%?^;;^
were the Souls of Men departed, who
had lived in the Practice qf Vertue.
This is fo niuch the more probable that
he faithj that it was above his Capacity
D X to
2.S ^Treatise
to explain well what they were, whom
ttiey called D^imns^ and that we muft
%hide by the Opinion of ancient Authors,
who beincT the Sons of the Gods, did
beft know their Parent^ Opinion. Now
the Ancients are Hejhdus^ and the other
Poets^ of the fame Opinion, and who
have faid that the D^mom were the
Souls of Men of the Golden Generation ;
Hermes Trifmegtjlus Was one of the Sons
pf the Gods. St. Aufiin declares his O-
pinion thus ; De Qivit. Dei. L 8. c. 26.
he gives to underftand that he believ'c|
that the D^mo^js were made of the Souls
ef Men departed. Ciceroy who was a-

Laws, Tb^t the Denicds were Fejlwals de^

i/emarkable, that he afcribes to the fe-
cond fort, certain Bodies formed of the
pureft Air, and of a moft fubtile Com-
poiition. It is the Sentiment of Plutarch
who tells us in The Oracles that are ceafedy
That they are Spirits cloathed with an airy
Suhfiance* Thus; Amtot hath tranflated
the 125th Verfe of Hejiodus'^s Works,
called The Works of Daysj quoted by
Plutarch : But when Hefwdus names

Golden Generation^ who had been made
D^mo?is by Jupiter : From whence
may be conjeftur'd, that thofe excellent
Daemons^ according to Amleii'is^ who had
Bodies formed of the pureft and moft
fubtile Air, were according to Hefiodus
and Plutarch that quotes him, the Souls
of dead Men. And it muft be confefs'dj
that the moft comm*on Opinion was, that
there were none other.

could belong (according to the common
Opinion, and that of FUto) only to the
Damans that had been mentionM : and
this is the Aflfertion ; for in the firft

of carrying the Prayers and Oblations
of Men to Heaven, and bringing from
thence Bleffings and Rewards, did be^
long to the Demons that had been Men^
that which Plato hath taught very clear-
ly in the Places I have cited. They
that will be more particularly informed
concerning the Diftinflion of D^monsy
may read Marcillus Ficinus upon the

let it be noted, that here I take no-
tice only of the airy Demons Mediators
betwixt the celeftial Gods and Men ;
^hich were alfo the ObjeQ: of the Peo-

If it be objefted, that the Demons
cannot well be called the Minifters of
the great God, fince they believed foixie
good and fome evil Damons. I anfwer,
that I have fpoken of the Damons Medi-
sitors, and the common Object of the
Heathen's religious Worfhip ; the Sub-

where the Heathen made no Diftinftion.
If in Plutarch fome did believe wicked
D^monsj others do condemn that Opini-
on. According to Plato all Demons were
Gods ; and that Philofopher acknow-

It is here objeQed, that the Heather!
in geneial did not believe that there
were Damons in a middle State betwixt

the Perapateticks believ'd no Spirits favd

my Defign was to fliew what was the

votion, and the vulger Opinion on which
it was grounded; I was not obliged to
take notice of all the particular Opini-
ons of Philofophers which were not
followed by the People. The Peripa-
teticks did appear but very little in the
Time of St. Paul ^ and thefe Intelligen-
ces which they join'd to each Sphere,
were none other then the Damons^ which
the PUtonicims affixed to them, as
I^Idrdnus Fieinus witneffes ; for ail this
they might believe the airy Daemons
we are difcourfing of; I read nothing
of them for that Time upon that Sub-
je£t. The Opinion of Epcurus^ who
feem'd to deny all manner of Spirits,'
^ was then better approved than that of
the Peripamuks^ and yet it put no flop to
the Devotion then in ufe among the

gives Motion to the Orb. But in the fe-

I have found in the firft Book, that
feveral Philofophers beUevM that the
Planets were Gods. Flato in his Epi-
nomisy teaches that they are animated
Bodies, which muft be ador'd as Gods :
and in Crytulus he fays, that thofe Gods

need of Reft. But if all this was taught,
and after this Manner, by the Feripm"
ticks in St. PmPs Time, thofe Philofo-
phers did not hold an Opinion contrary
to the common People, who believed
that the Damons were dead Men, which
became the ObjeS: of the Adoration of
the Living.
As for the Stokhs^ I confefs that they
acknowlidgM not the Mediation of Dae-

and Partakers of the Divinity gf the

But you know that this Opinion was not
received among the People that worihip'd
the Celeftial Gods, and Demons Me-
diators betwixt the Gods and Men ;

he had no fettled Notions of God, and
that he was put to Death merely for
doubting of, and oppofing the commoa
Opinion the others had of the GodSj
ivhich were eftablifhed by Authority.
The Fathers have fhew'd that they have

Do ye not think, thatthofe who would
have us believe the Trinity, and other
Myfteries of ourHoly Religion, and the

none other Ground than becaufe all that
was believ'd by them that went before
us, or upon the Authority of the Church,
or of other Leaders, that they have not
profited little by Cottt^s Inftruftioris.
But are you not grieved to fee the

then, that thefe, who fo plainly declare
that they ftand to Chrijlh Religion only

Refleftions upon what Flutarch fays
That their Worfhip was a mixt Worjhip of
that of the Gods^ and of that of Damons .-
which clearly difcovers that there was a
Difference, at leaft, according to the^
#hilofophers Opinion, betwixt the Wor-
!hip peculiar to the celeftial Gods, and
that which belonged to Damons "^ as
indeed Trifmegiftnsy fo often quoted by
^St. Jujiiny Mth in Jfclepio, " That
" Heaven and the celeftial Gods were
" pleasM in receiving the Admirations^

" riofity." At the latter end he falls
to Prayer, and Afclepius having whi-
fperM to him, that to his Prayers fhould
be added offering of Incenfe and other
Perfumes, he grows angry, and anfwers.
thus, " JfclepiuSy you ought to have

by this, the Difference betwixt the Wor-

which muft be this. That the Worfhip
of the Gods muft be fpiritual, and con-
fifted in holy Medications, the Affeftioa

of the Divim Nature^ and of the Matter

obferved, whereby Men do endeavour,

put off their Nature and former Af-
fecVions, were, according to PhtarcVs

to offer Sacrifices to them to pleafe
thenij to keep clofe to the Ceremonial Ob-

as appears, by the Hiliories oftheir Lives,

that all the Religion of the Heathen

but God. 2. That Chriilians fliould have
nothing to do widi any religious Wor-
Jhip, which does not direfliy and imme-
diately relate to God, and to him alone,
notwithftanding all the Reafons which
Men may pretend to the contrary, and

That tlio' there is no other God but
one, and that an Idol is nothing in

yet whatfoever Men fee up
as an Obje£t of rehgious Worfliip, is
termed God in holy Script ure^ becaufe
it is fubftituted and placed in the room
ofthe true and only God, who ought to
be the fole Objefl: ofReligion. 2. The other
is, that in this Precept God fpeaks to
Men that own him as God, and pro-
fefs to worfloip him: lie doth not
forbid they fhould deny him, that they
iliould go and ferve other Gods ; but
he forbids particularly, they fhould
ferve any other in his Prefence, or with
him ; thofe that are guilty of the for-
mer do call: God behind their Backs,

Face, to cover the dreadful Majefiy
thereof, that they may approach it with

der the Lav/ the FarCe of God was the
Ark towards v/hich they worfliip d, was
the only Symbole of God's Prefence, and
as a Means to draw near unto him: and
that as under the Law God would not that
his People [hould have any other Objeft of
their Devotion, but Hiriifelf, who fpake
to them out of the Ark, nor contrive
any other Way of drawing nigh
to him., nor fancy any other Token of

WHY IS it fayM that the Mamd

that of Devil^ feeing that Mr. Ddlle
obferves, that it is always iifed to fig-
niff an evil Thing in the Tranflatioa
of the Septuagints ;and that in the Book
of the Acts it is ufed otherwife but in
one Place, and that with refpeO: to the
wrong Judgment which the Heathen
made of it? To this will be anfwer'djf
that the Word Damon hath always form-
ed in the Mind of Chriftians the Idea
of an Evil Thing, as reprefenting to
them either the ObjeO: of abominable
I Idolatryj
6^ ^Treatise
Idolatry, or thofe Evil Spirits that are
conftantly called by this Name, as Origen
obferves, Lib. 5. ag. Celfus. It fignifies
always the oae or the other of thefe
Things in the New Teftament, even
Acts 17. 18. In the Tranflation of the
Seventy, it is ufed fix or feven times
to the fame Purpofe : we have already
feen two Places where it expounds a
Word fignifying a forbidden Worfhip,
P/I 96. 5. It ihews the Signification of
the Word Elilimj which we tranflate
Jdols^ and Ifa.^6, 11. to expound the
Word Gady which we tender the Hofl:
of Heaven ; in both which Places, men-
tion is made of falfe Divinities. Be-
fide thefe, the Seventy likewife ufed
the Word Damon^ to explain the Hebrew
Word Sehhirim, Ija. ijo 21. which we
tranflate Bugbears^ and it fignifies a kind
of Wild Beait or Night Bird, apt to^
fright Folks, and which were to flielter
themfelves in the P^^ains of Babjlo^^
after it was defl:royM ; and i/i. 54. 14.
to expound the Word Tftjmy which figni-
fies the Wild Beafi:s which were to
lepair to iliQ. Ruins of Bofra. The
moff
of spirits. 6y
moft conftant Ufe of the "Word D<emon.
hath been to reprefent thofe Animals of
a Middle Nature, betwixt God and Man, \
which we call Amls^ and were fo
named by the Heathen themfelves in
Afdepo. Chriftians have called Evil
Angels DamonSj and to the good they
have given the Name of Jngels only.
Thofe among the Heathen, who ac-
knowledged EvWD^mom^ called tliem-
felves C^codAtT/ionas^ and mifchievous An-
gels ; but with them the Name of D^-
mon was conftantly an honourable
Name, which they gave to the Noblefl
Dbjecis of their religious Worfhip
:
whenfoever the Scripture makes ufe of
it to exprefs an Oh]eci of Religion, it
always intimates a falfe ObjeQ:, and
Chriftians look upon it with Abhor-
rence; but the Heathen notv/ithftanding,
have taken this Name, in their Senfe,
for the Name of a Thing worthy of
their Veneration, fo that when in
Scripture it fignifies an Objed of A-
doration, it is taken in honum fartem^
for a Venerable Name, with refpecl
to the Judgment that the Heathen
I 2 made
<?8 Lr^ Treatise
made of it 5 but it founds ill in the
Ears of Chriftians. It is not only A"?^
17. that it is ufed to fignify a good
Thing, but alfo 1 Cor. 10. and it
cannot be taken in another, Rev. 9.
20. according to the Notion of the
rWorfliippers there fpoken of, tho' we
tranflate it by the Word Devils^ ac-
cording to our Notion. I fay therefore,
that the Word D^moj^ doth reprefent
to Chriftians none but odious Objefts ;
yet it could not, at leaft in St, PauPs
Time, infpire fo great an Horror as that
of Devils \ for,obferve in the firft Place,
that in the Greek Tongue, then fpoken
every where, and underftood by every
Body, the Word. D.emon fignifies L^^r-
ftedy whereas Devil fignifies a falfe Jc
tufer. Secondly, none ever imagined
that the Word Devil fignified any thing
that vi^as good : but the Name D^mon
was efteem'd by moft as very Venerable,
in a conftant Converfatibn among Men ;
and uring,asthey do, fome Words which
they diflike not, lelfens very much
the Averfion we might otherwife have
for them, tho' u this tim^e we do nop
; . di-
of Spiritsl 6^
diftinguifli them, and we look upon the
Names of Devils and Damons to be
Synonymous^ tho' the one comes out eafier
than the other : we obferve likewife in
reading the Holy Scripture, that the
Word Devil is always without any Ti-
tle or Adjunft, which can intimate any
difference between the Things to which
this Name is given 5 but the Name D^-
mon is fometimes ufed with Diftinflion,
which implies that this Name may be
given as well to good as to Evil Things^
diS Luke 4. J 3. The Spirit of an unclean
D^mon^ or as it is in fome Copies, Kxx
impure Damon.
Two notable Differences there are h^^
twixt thefe two, firfi: that the Holy
Scripture applies the Word Damon both
in the Singular and in the Plural Num-
ber, to the fame Things : But tho' the
Word Devih is three times ufed in the
Plural Number, to fignify fuch Perfons
as are given to flandeiing, yet never
but in the Singular to fignify the
Evil Spirit : This fbews that the Scrip-
ture \yill not confound thefe two Names
as
7b ^A TreaTis
as we do, and the Things which are
reprefented by them. The firii Place
where we meet with the Word ^ia^o7.<^^
Devil, according to the Sepuagmfs
Tranflation, is in the beginning of the
Book of '^ob^ where we find it tvv^elve
times in two Chapters, and always to
expound the 'WovdSatm^ which is the
Name of that wicked Spirit that ilander'd
"^oby and would deftroy him. The firil:
place in the New Teftament is in St.
Matthew^ when he tempted our Saviour ?
St.-^yLf^e calls the Tempter the Devd-^
and St. M^rk names him Satan \ which
clearly fhews that he who tempted
Chriji^ is the fame that accuied "^ok The
fame doubtlefs who defired to fift the
Apoftles as Wheat, who infpirM "Judas
to be a Traitor, that filled Ananias
and SapifhiraVs Heart, this is the
great Draoon, the old Serpent^ called
the Dex/z/t and Satan the Accufer of
the Brethren, the fame that fed need Eve
:
the fame Satan in Hebrew, and Devit
according to the Seventy, who with-
flood the High-Prieft Jehijhuah, and who
is reprefented contending for the Body
V of
of spirits] 71
of MofeSj Jude. 9. from whofe Power
Men are delivered by the Preaching
of the Gofpel ; in one Word, who had
the Empire of Death, and whom Chriji
hath overcome by his Death. This
Word Ssa^om is not found in the Greek
Ileafhemfh Authors to fignify a Spir^t^
or any other particular Thing : And I
do not think that the Heathen kne\%F
this great Accufer, Adverfary, and ge-
neral Enemy of Mankind, which we
call the Devil : They that believ'd wicked
DamonsJ
never gave them this Name,
neither was it given to that evil God,
the Author of all Evil, whom fome, tha'
^
but few, did affirm to ftand in oppoQ*
tion to the Almighty and good God^
but whom they never IpokM upon as aa
enviousy jealous Sfirit^ to accufe Men
before God, and endeavouring by all
manner of Ways and Means to deftroy
them. We have no Knowledge of this
Spirit called the Devil, and Satany but
by the Revelation of God's Word .-
it
fliould be obferv'd therefore, that the
Holy-Scripture fpeaking of D^^^^f?;^/, tliat
were the Objea of the Heatheniffi
Worfbip,
% ^Treatise
Worfhip, names them often in tSe
Plural Number, according to the Notions
of thofe Idolatrous Nations, but never
of the Devil, or Sata^, the true Caufe
of Man's Fall ; but as of one to whom
is attriLjted the Seduftion of the
"World, and of the Nations, the Ori-
ginal of Mens Inclinations to do Evil,
and opp:{inj God's Grace and ManV
Happinefs.
The ftcond Difference to be taken
notice of is, that the Scripture never
gives the Name o^D^mon to any living
Man, but that of Devil, and Satan td

Satan, the Name of the moft fearful and
crjelEnemy and Adverfary of Mankind
to exprefs the greatnefs of the Injury
they offered by their Oppofitions and
Contradidions. In St. John 6. 70. it
is faid of Judas^ that he was a Devily
in
of spirits. 75
in the fame Senfe that this Name is
given to H^mmonhy the Seftuagintj Hefi.
ij.. 4. and chap. ^' ver* i. where we
find the Heherv Word Ifar^ which fig-
nifies a violent Oppreffor: the Reafon
of this is, that the Devil or Sata^ is a
real and true Being, and moft wicked
of all Creatures, and the Holy Scrip-
ture will have us t,0 underftand that
ajl tfhofe are like him to whom ic gives
this Name ; whereas the Damons^ ho-
nour'd by the Heathen, have no real
Exiftence, and the Holy Ghoft would
pot give the Names of Things that have
no Being but in Imagination, to thofe
Perfons whofe real Qualities were to
be declar'd and fet forth.
I conceive, that it will be objeded
that the Damons of the Heathen were
real Things, fince what was worfhip-
ed under that Name, were the Souls
of dead Men, and that feme did alfo
underftand by the fame Name, them
th at we call Agels. To this I anfwer

they w^ere in the Imagination of f-
dclkers^ who believed that they repre-
fented fo many Divinities; that they
-were not fimple Statues, but Images
full of Sfirit^ that wrought Wonders,
and knew I'hings to come, did foretell
them by Dreams or otherwlfe, and
caufed Difeafes to fall upon Men, and.
cured them afterwards : Holy Images,

the Souls of Damons^ or Angels: in

the Power of doing Good or Evil. And
do you not find here all that is faid
now of the Images ofLauretta, and fe-
Veral other Places. With refpeQ: to
this, St. Paul faith, that the Idol is no-^
thing in the World ; becaufe that what
they would have it to be, is no moro
than the Vertue afcribed to it ; that
there is no God ; but One and what
the Gentiles did offer, they offered it
to Demons, not to God ^ and Damons
where nothing but imaginary Divi-
nities.
"We gather from both thefe DiflFerences,
that tho' the Heathenifh Opinion con-
eerning Damons^ and that which was
to be in vogue among Chriftians con-
formably thereunto, had the Devil for
their Author; yet in that Place St*

The Spirits fuppoled to have follow'd
Satan in his Revoult from the beginning of
the World, had not yet been fent of God ;
and if St. '^ui.e meant it of them, he repre-
fents them bound with Chains from that
time, fo that they could not never fmce be
either Angels or Meffengers. If you read
the Apoftle's Difcourfe without Preven-
tion, you will find that the common
Explication doth not allow him a very
exa£l Way of Reafoning ; his Defign
is to perfwade Chriftians to maintain
conftantly the Good Fight of Faith, and
not fufFer themfelves to be carried a-
way by the Examples of thofe, who
turning the Grace of God, into Wan-
tonnefs, have renounced the only Lord
Jefus Chrift our God and Saviour ; and
his Argument to this Purpofe is the
Fear of God's Judgments, whereof be
mentions here three notable Exaniples^
I. That of the Children of 7/rW, who
after their Dehverance from Egypt hc"
lievM not, and where deftroy'd 5 this
was known by the Hiftory. 2. The
Hiftory of the Rebellion that appear'd

after the Return of them that were
fent to fpy the Land of Canarf. 5. Here
is fet down for a third Example, Sodom
and Gomorrah^ whereof likewife the
Hiftory was well known, and often
fpoken of by the Prophets : for the fe-
cond is reckoned the Panifhment of
thofe Angels that rebell'd with Satan ia
the beginning of the World, and who are
refer ved under Darknefs, in Bonds, of
which no mention is made in any Part:
of the Scriptures; and that Example,
till then unknown, was no ftrong Ar-
gument, to ftir up the Spirits, neither
could it be conveniently joiaed with the
reft. Let no Body alledgehere Tradition,
or fome Book that is loft ; for befides
that, what depends upon Tradition, and
may be faid of the laft Books, is very-
uncertain ; it is unlikely that St. "Jude
would have placed betwixt two Exam-
ples, fo well known by the holy Hifto-
ry, another Example, whereof no men-
tion at all is made in the facred Oracles

For this Ihould be carefully rememberM,
that it was not the Greatnefs of the Mi-

which he did were the fame that it

cur'd him, he rebuked xht Damon which
went out, and he was healed, ver. 18.
and was not the Damon and the Sick-

and it is faid, that

Meaning is that the Lord, who is the

Demons (who are the Gods ofPeople) are
afraid of, PJ, 96. The Lord is dreadful
above all Gods of ^ the (a) Nations^ as

tranflated it D^mons^ in Ff. 6. 9 . and
Idcls^ I Chrcn, 16, 25. But v/hen he
faith that Demons do believt and tremble^
he fpeaks to the Heathen conver-
ted to the Truth of One only God ;
and yet fancied that to be favedj it
was not neceifary to renounce their
vicious Affeftions, provided they v^or-
fhipped but one only God The Apoftle
tells them. That this was not fufficient
to make them Happy, becaufe that
according to the Pagan Do£lrine, which
they had lately parted with ; and David
d-d ta»ke Notice of the Damons Wor«
fbipped by them, who believed and con-
feffed by their Oracles, that there is but
One fovereign God, which,notwithftand*
ing, doth not make them Happy, fince

that
ioz A Treat ise
that according to the fame Opinion, the
D^enions do tremble, knowing theni-
felves to be fubjefl: to the Correftion
of this Supreme God. This Place of
St. "^ames doth certainly allude to that
of Daviif who never meant that the
Pg^mons were a real Thing, but that
they were fomething in others Opinion.
This furious Man, now in quefiion, be-
ing poffefs'd with this Notion, thought
he muft not fpeak, but in the Perfons
of thofe Damons^ which he fancyM to
be in him ; and having heard th^tjefus
was the Son of God, and that he did
cait DdmG/7s out of Mens Bodies, doth
look upon him v/ith Fear, as the Son
of God come to punilli him ; w^herefore
he prays him not to punifli him before
the Tirne; that is, before the End of
the World, or before the Time appoint-
ed for the general PuniQiment of D^-
t5
mons.
Some Difficulties may be thought to
be in this : as, i. That it may be ask'd,
How thefe Dam ms knew, that Je[u$ wss
the Son of Gc^i? We may anfwer, that
they
of spirits. 10^
they knew it by the common Report^
which taught it the blind Man in the
Way, Man. 9. 27. It may be objeftedj
in the fecond Place, that the D^smoris
themfelves did cry out, that Jefus iv^s
the Chrijl the Son cf God^ and that our Sa-
viour forbad rhem to publiih. it : But I
(ay, that the Demons are named for t!i®
afflifted Perfons- for St. Mark tells us^
Chap. J.
11,12. that when the unclean.
Spirits faw him, they fell down and
cry'd ; for it was not the Spirits, but die
Men tormented with them, did fee^and
cried, and fell down, if Cfc'/^/? forbad
thofe Men to tell who he was, it is be-
caufe he would, not have "it publicklj
known as yet ; by the fame P^eafon that
he commanded the Leprous that he liad
cleanfed, the blind Man he had made
to fee, yea, his very Difciples, viz. St.
Mark hath it. Chap, 3. ver. 12. That
they fliouid not make it known.
But the great Difficulty lies in this,
that the D^momack called himklf Lezt'o^^
and pray'd, that they might enter into
the Herd of Swine, which bein^ 2;rant-
ed,
^04 A Treatise
ed, the Hogs cafl themfefves headlong into the

llie mere EfFeS: of a bodily Difeafe, or of
a diftemperM Mind. Yet whatfoever the
Difficulty may be, it cannot oblige us
to acknowledge feveral e\ril Spirits that;
come from without to torment Men^s
Bodies; or to fay wkh JofephuSy lib,

'Belli Jud'/W'i 5: That thefe 'vexatious Sfk:
tits were the Souls of wicked Men that died

find a Troop of Spiritual Guards for S^

notfeek further than the Damned SbuW^
wlio.hate God and eviery Thing that is
acceptable to him: But my Opinion is?
that the Departed Souls of wicked Men,
are all like the rebellious Meflengers fpo-
ken of by St. "Jude, referred under Darkfiefs
in Chains ; or, as St. Peter hath, it, funk
\vith Chains of Obfcurity and kept in Prifon^
iintil the Judgment of the great Day^ 2 Pet:
2. 4. and fo they can do no Harm to
any Man living ; for certain it is, time
thofe

of both by St. Feter ani
St. Judey are in no Condition to hurt any
Body whatfoever, be they mere Spirits
or departed Souls ; and fo whatfoever
is thus aferibed to Spirits or Departed
Souls, is pure Imagination. I aiitrm
therefore, that the Torments from which
our Saviour delivered Men, were the
EfFc^s of bodily Difeafes,or Diftradions
of Spirit, and wherein the Devil afts
hone otherwife than he did in thofe
grievous Difterhpers wherewith ^oh was
affliSed. This further appears hy what
our Saviour faith, Luke i}„ i6, eoncern-
ing the Woman that had the Spirit of
Infirmity, which kept her bow'd down
eighteen Years. It was doubtlefs a
bodily Diftemper^ proceeding from na-
tural Caufes ; for our Saviour in curing
her faid no more than this, Thou art
loofed from thine Infirmity ;
yet he faith
likevvife, that Satan had kept her bound
eighteen Tears : So that if any evil Spirit
had a Hand in thefe, k was but oney
^iz. Satan or the Devil i Wherefore the
Saviour Of the World tells them, That
if he did cajl out Damons by Beelzebub the
O Prime
io6 ^Treatise
Pri;7ce of Damonsj then Satan did caft
out himfelf ; fuppofing that there was
but one Satan that might be the Caufe
of all thofe Diftempers called DawonSy
which could not be cured by the Au-
thority or Power of Satan y. or elfe Sa-
tan muft caft out himfelf, or be divided
againft himfelf: And if the Devil was
the Tormenter of this pamoniack, be
might alfo ask Leave to drown the
Swine; One D^z^/7 might as well drive
one whole Herd of Swine, as one Spirit^
could be a lying Spirit in the Mouth of
four hundred of Jhab^s Prophets, i Kjngj
22. 6—22. But the Truth is, that this
poor Man was troubled with a fore Di-
ftemper ; and the Hogs, by God's Pro-
vidence, might be ftruck with the fame-^
or with fome other, more natural and
pecuhar to them : And it is no more
incredible that the Diftemper of this
Madman fhould pafs into the Hogs^
than that NaamarPs Leprofy did ftick
to Gehazf.
But this Story of the Gofpel is too^
remarkable to be difmifs'd without far*
ther

;%er Reflexion. And if any Body hath
the Curiofity of feeing lively Examples
of the fame fort of Madncfs, let him
but repair to Bethlehem^ or let him en-
quire of the Governors of that Hofpital,
'who is well fatisfyM that there is none
there poffefled with a Devil ; and, yet
many are ft rong enough 1 break Chains,
or other Bonds ; fo that if they had
not been fhut up in good Time, they
had been feen running in the Streets,
cutting themfelves, and the like, to the
Shame and Difappointment of them that
undertook the taming ofthem ; and not-
wichftanding all the Care taken, fome
•will break Prifon, and make good what
is faid of many mad and loofe Fellows,
That they . look like one broken looje out of
Bethlehem : and it is very probable, that
among the Gadarenes they had not fuch
good Orders kept, but fome were left
to themfelves, and no Pains taken there
either to flop, or (hut them up.
2. As St. Miirk is moft exaft in re-
lating this Cafe, let us take notice of
his Words concerning this Madman ;
io8 A Trea'Iise
ind our bleffed Saviour tells us^
that feeing Jefm Chriji afar off, he ra^
md Worjhipved him ; tliat in the Greek
Dialeft, ahd he fell down before him
to the Ground, ^s ^ Token of great
Humility, a thing common enough to
'tliat fort of People, when they meet
with great or learned Men, or Men in
Authority. That if ourSaviour faid imme-
diately, Thou unclean Spirit get out of this
Mans it was an A£t of his Wifdom tof.
^ive into the Madman's Sence, to com^'
ply with his Imagina.tion, viz. to cure
liini ; he complies with his Imagination!
that there was fome great Thing which
troubled him, either from within, or
frpi0 without, for fuch is the ftrong PrcM
judice of fome of them, that the more
you crofs or contradi(ft them, the worfe
they ^rie, and prove the more incuraNi
ble. It may be faid alfo, that the Lord:
proceeded in this manner, to manifeft
his Power and Authority in command-
ing the UiicleanSpirits, and making them
obedientto his Word ^ ^bhe otherwife
than if he had faid, Thou foul Difeafe

if spirits^ 10^
to depart from this Man, and afBift
him no more; or as he faid to the ficfc
of the Palfey, Stmd uf md vpdky and {o
in this Place; Be thou healed of thin#
Infirmity^ and delivei'd of thy tormwt**
Ing Pain;
3. What is there hetmxt thee and me ,
'^efu$^ thou Son of God ; Jn thou come ta
Torment us before the Tinte? This hatli
been fufficiently expl^in'd : But it (hould
be obferved that whenMen have once pet
a thing in their Heads, asweeommonly
fpeak, they fancy that all they fee or
hear agreeth thereunto. The Author
of tiiQ World BemtccVd^ tells Us of a
Woman of Fr/?;^^/&^r in the Low Goun-
tries, who believ'd herfelf to be irre-
coverably damned, and did not fpeak
at all^ becaufe file imagined that tlie
damned did fpeak. The fame muft be
faid 6f the Man's Anfwer, My Name h
Legion^ for rve are many. This Man ha-
ting di ft rafted Bra'ms, imagined that his
Head was full of Damonsy and therefore
that the Name oi .Legion was a pro-
per Name to take upon himfelf. And
this
no y^ Treatise:
this proves, that it was the Man him-
felf who fpoke, and not the Spirits with-
in him; for our Saviour did not ask.What
are your Names ; hut what is thy Name ?
in the Angular Number : and fqch was
the Anfwer, Not our Names, hut my
Name is Legion \ but it will be objefted
that it is faid, v. 15. Him that had the
Legion^ which feems to intimate that
it was not a fimple Imagination, but a
Reality : yet this is no necelTary Confe-
quence. They that relate a Story, as^
the Evangelifts do this, relate Things*
as they appear outwardly, without en-
quiring into the Caufes; we do the fame
every Day, when we meet with fuch
Hypocoftdriack Fancies, as to have fuch -a
living Thing within him as a Snake
era Wolf. When we fpeak afterwards
of him, we fay. The Man that had the
Snake or the Wolf: If we tell the Story
of him that thought he had no Guts,
wefav. The Man. that had no Guts /
y^t \ic would be thought to affirm,
tjiath? was really in fuch a Condition.
of spiritft \ III
In like manner is -what is added.
That the Damons befought the Lord
that he would not Jend them into the Ahyfs^
but permit them to go into the Herd of
Swine: Now, fuppofing that they were
the Damons themfelves that fpoke this ;
we muft then conclude that they knew
that they muft go into the Deep, when
they were put out of their Habitations up-
on the Earth,as their fettled DwelHng; a
thing indeed to be wondred at,that fo ma-
ny Thoufands of Prifoners, ffor a Legion
\vas at leaft three, or fix Thoufand,)
fiiould be left out of BeU to torment
one or two poor human Creatures ; (and
he who is the King or the Judge,
that will let out a Prifoner without a
fuiBcient Reafon ?) And can we con-
ceive, that the great God the Judge
of Men and Angels, would give Liberty,
to fuch vaft Numbers to chaftife one
Man for a Time ; feeing efpecially that
one alone was fufEcient to put up St.
VauI to itjWho doubtlefs was another fort
of a Man than this DamonUck, So that
ijt is evident that thefe were only the
bare Words of this poor Sufferer, when
he
Ife 'prayM as in the Names of feveral
Damons^ that they might not be obli-
ged to return to Hell.
Befides all this, we cannot but fay
that this Requeft of the Demons did
tend to fomething elfe, than fimply
to enter into the Hogs to efcape the
Jhyfs for that Time, yea that fhort
Spaee of Time only ; for what did
they get by that ? for the Hogs being
drowned, what became of the Damonsl^
Or did Ghrift grant them a longer
Tinie than they petitioned for? for tho*
God gave Jatoh, David and Solomof%
much more than they required, I can
hardly think that he would do the
Devil fuch Kindnefs. Fufthermore, had
tliey defirM tp go into the Swine only
to be kept out of the Abjifs for a Time ;
How is it that they fo foon fet fire to
the Place of their Refuge, and imme-
diately deftroyM their hofpitable Hogs ?
This was a Miracle of our Saviour
\o Qure this Man with one Word, as
an Evidence of his Divine Power and
Vertue
3 R I of jSpirits: v jia^
Vertue and was the Man thus cured
bf his D.tmons^ '
when they were drivea
out othis Head and brought again to his
rightSenfes? wherefore away from hence
a!] Devils which are not mentioned, no
more than they were feen; and let
C^r//? alone have the Honour of. an
A6tion which is unjuftly aferibed . to
evil Spif'its.
But let US now come to tli'^. Sprits
of Pytlion^ and take notice in .tlie- firit
place, that God commanded that they
fliould he put to Deatby L^"^' .?2p 27.
.So that they cannot be Men that were
poiTefs'd, who did unhappily fuffer Vio-
lence asiainft their Will, and without be-
ing guilty, of any apparent Crime, fince
they could not prevent, it; therefore
thefe muft beCriminals worthy of Death :
but thefe were fuch. as pretend to de-
clare Things to come, and anfvver all

probable, that thefe Machines or iFdols
Were Statues, oat of whofe Bellies came
forth, or pretended to come forth, that
Voice which returned Anfwers, when
the Mailers or MiftreiTes 'of thofe Obs
did fet them on work, and made them
fpeak ; and which fometimes did break
at the iirft trying of them, when they
^vere not made of good Metal, or when
tfeir Belly was over full of Wind. This
may be gathered from the Expreffion of
the Seftuagint^ and from that of Elihu;^
jdly, It is evident, that by the Ufe of
;he Ob they pretended to enquire of the
Pead : This I conclude from the Story
qf Smlj 1 Sam. 28. and Ifaiah 19. If
i they
ii8 A Treatise
they fay to you, enquire of the Ohy of
the Inchanters, Mountebanks, or the
like ,• for thus I render the Word which
the Seftmgint have expreffed hy thefe
that fpeak out of the Earthy that mutter
and fend forth a dark and inward Spirit
•
Shall not the People enquire of their Gody and
go to the Deadfor the Living? The Prophet
teaches in this Place, that thefe Ohes^
and thefe Juglers, who fet fuch Gins to
work, caufing others to hear, (or ima-
gine, that they, as from the Machine's,
Belly) fuch Words and Anfwers as do
fatisfy the Living that enquire of the
Dead. Lajily^ It is indubitable that
thefe Statues, made to receive Anfwers
from the Dead, were fattened in the
Ground : This is evident, not only be-
caufe the S^ptuagint have twice translated
the Word Ob^bjthofe that caufe their Voice
to be heard out of the Earth ^ T^i .V -f y^g
alfo becauie the fame Tranflators, fpeak^
ing of the Ob which AJanajfeth made, do
fay, That he confecrated pieces of Earthy
tKJngs 21,6. inftead of faying that he
made
of spirits. I ip
ttiade an Ok But this is clear, efpecially,
out of //i. 19. 4» where God faith unto
Jrielj Thou(halt he brought dorvffj thou {halt
fpeak out of the Ground 5 thy Speech jhaU
proceed foftly out of the Dufij and thy Voice
fhall be heard as out of an Ob : But the Pro*
phet had never fpoken thus, had not
the Ob been in the Ground, from whence
it was heard to fpeak.
Some would conclude from this Ex-
pofition, that as fuch Machines were
criminally invented to find out fecret and
forbidden Things, the Knowledge where-
of God hath refeived to himfelf, Deut.
29. 29. Satan the Author of all Mifchief,
doth take that Opportunity to work his
own Defighs, and by fuch Inftruments
give fometimes true Anfwers, whereby
the Owners of them obtain Credit and
Power, to divert other Men from that
Submiffion they owe to God, and that
abfolute Depend ance they fhould have
upon his Providence. But moft certain
it is, that the Devil cannot know all
Things; yea, I make bold to fay, that
he
120 A Tl^EA^ISE-
W'knows very littk,. at leaft in Com-
parifon to what. th€ World thmks that
he knows ; he cannot be m'feveral Pla-
ces at once, fince he is fuppofed to go
to and fro in the World, ^^^^i; 7. But
the^ Tinith is, that in all Ais there is
nothing of the Devil, but the Gunning
of Cheats, to amufe and deceive creda-
lous People : And the farktlmSfirit ii
a juggling, deceitful, a Hocus-focrit Spi-
rit. The confcaht Praftlfers of this Art

treat the Reader to examine ftriftly the
difficulties arifing from the common O-

terpreters do not agree about feveral
Heads. Some will have it That all the

thers that the Mmifltrs only {hall have this

Befides thiSjThere are feme things which

to me to be of no fmall diiBcuIty. St,

if we are to Judge the Angels, ho\y
much rather things pertaining to this
Life ? They fhculd explain to us, whae
relation there is between thefe two forts
of Judgment ^ and what confequence
may follow from a Judgment that con-
fifts only in Approbation, or given Evi-
dence, or a Judgement that pronounces
Sentence, and decides Matters: fuch as
the Apoftles would have the Faithful to

his Difcourfe upon thisSuppofition, That

faith he, that we {hall judge the Angels ?
Let me therefore ask thefe DoQors,
who cannot determine what Judges
fhal] pronounce this Judgment, or what
Angels (hall be judged; When, and
after what manner this Judgment fliall
be given? and how God's Children can=
know that they fhall be judged ? But
I get out of this Lybjrintb^ by follow-
ing the Sentiment of thofe St. Chryfojhme
fpeaks of upon this Place, and who be-
lieve, that the Angels meant, are the
Minifters of the Church, who are to
be judged by the Church itfelf. Thofe
Prophets, whofe Spirits or Do5:rines,
are to be fubjeft to the Prophets, who
judge of what is faid ; and confeqiiently
do judgeof Things greater and of an
higher Importance than the Things of*
this Life. Tho' Jpme Copies do put a

among Men of Learning, and aiming at
PerfeGion. And I prefume that what
follows, will juftify that it is not an
indifferent thing, whether Chriftians be
rightly informed In this Point or not.
Obferve therefore that in all things, and
in the firft Place he fhould have an Eye
to the Glory of our God, which we
cannot advance too much, nor remove

a ftumbling Block in the way of

Examples; as,

Abfurdities, that Conjurers, Witches, or
the Devil himfelf can do all that God
permits them to do. Can Men in their
Senfes conclude, that a mere PermiCfion
can enable for A£tion ? Chrift permitted
St. Peter to walk upon . the Sea, but
enabled him not to do it ;as he did to heal
the impotent Man at the beautiful Gate
of the Temple. I ask therefore, whether
k was fimpie Permiffion that made B/^.

duce Things above Nature, nor work

others would fink immediately. Thefe
are but few of innumerable Inftances
that may be produc'd, to prove that
Men do allow the Devil a Power and
Operations above Nature ; and if that
is true, then he is a God. Every Crea-
ture is confined by God himfelf to^the
Properties of it$ own Nature, and fp
are the AGtions proceeding from thefe
Properties; So that we muft fay that
when a Creature a£bs contrary to:,
or above its Nature, it is God's own

peration, as when St. Peter cured the

ordinary Abilities to the Means, beyond

my part, I will never enquire what the
Devil can do, when I fee any thing done^
that is above Nature ; for then I arri

Teceiv'd Ppinioa is a great fturnbling
Block
of spirits. 14P
Block unto Man, even in the Way of
his Salvation : For, firft of all, it fur-
nifhes the Atheift with an unanfwerable
Argument againft the Truth of our Ho-
ly Religion ; for we pretend this to be
undeniably eftablilh'd by it, that the
Writers of the Bible did thofe Things^
which were infipoflible to be done with-
out the Finger of God : This was the
Cafe of the Law, Deut. 4. 42. God hath
taken to himfelf a. People^ out of mother
Peoplejby Temptations, by Wonders^ by aJlrong
Handy and by an out-Jlretched Arm^ and by
great Terrors, It is the Cafe of the Got
pel, Heb, 2. 4. God witnefjing together with
them by Signs ^ and WonderSy and mighty
Works. But if what is conceived of th^
Devil tzkQs Place, Conjurers and Witch*
es go beyond Mofes and the Prophets,
and Chrtjl himfelf; for the Devil daily
fets forth Prophecies, and doth Won*
ders beyond Vrim and Thummim. IfGod

niaking Comparifons, which this new
receiv'd Opinion is But too apt to do,
to the great Scandal and Prejudice of
the Chriftian Religion 3 and hinders Mer|
from knowing and ferving God as they
9Ught to do. St. James tells US, That if
any lacketh Wifdom^ he mufi beg it of God^ _
who alone is able to give it. But thi$
ppinion tells us, that Satany out of his
- sr€:ai
hf Sprntl i^i
great Capacity, and long Experience^'
can reveal all Things to Men. The Prtf-
pher Jmos puts this Queftion, Is rherp
any Evil m the Citj^ and the Lord hath ndt
done it ? JBat what anfwers this Conceit,
All Evil i^ frdm the Devil. If wfe^ftfe
aflaulted with any fad or troublefom^
Thoughts, 6'r feel in our Confciences
fome Checks or Difturbances for thfe
Evil that we have done, we complain
that we are purfued by 'an evil Spirit.
And do we difcourfe of another World,
we hear of nothing oftner than the
DeviPs dragging and hauling Souls in-
to He-// : So that however we are taught
to honour and love God, we are alfo in-
ftrufled to fear the DeviI,contrary to the
Scripture, which informs us, that Godj
and he done^ is to be fear d\ and that it iS
a fearful Thing to fall into the Hand^
of the Living God ; not of a Devil itt
Chains.
And will not our pure and Holy Re-
ligion fuffer much, by thus making
God the Author of thefe Errors and
Cheats^
i^z ^Treatise
Cheats, which are fet on work to fe-
^uce Men ; for the Devil hath no Share
in Omnipotencev and God muft be the
JDoer of all thofe Things that exceed
Nature, and yet are made tJfe of to
turn away Men from God, to look up-
on Satan as the Engineer ofthefe furpri-f
'Zing Things. Let our Hearts abhor fuch
Conceits, for they will keep us from the
right Sentiments we fhouldjiave of the
Divinity, and^ by Confequence, make
us incapable of rendering to our God
that Honour, Reverence, and Service^
which are due to him. As many as
fancy that God either permits or gives
,the Devil a Power to do fuch Things,
do afcribe to Sata/^ a Power and King,
dom antecedent to, and as lafting as
that of God'i only Son; having under
his Command and DireSion Multitudes
of Spirits, Men and Witches, who ha^
ving contracted a ftri£t Alliance with
him, do aflert his Dominion in all Parts
of the World, to the great Grievance
of innumerable Creatures, and the etep-
nai Damnation of poor deluded Souls,

But to conclude, the Notions are in-
confiftent with the FraBice of P/V/j, ac-
cording as St. Paul marks their Oppofi-
tion, 1 Tim, 4. 7. But rejeB ungodly AnJL

one, and admitting the others not only

Jhe fure to have nothing to do with
,, thefe, and give thy felf wholly to the
..
other ; whereby it is fufficiently mani-
feft, that fuch Fables can never agree
with Piety. This is what St. Peter
would have us to underftand, when he
faith, 2 Pet. I. 16. We follow not after cun-
ningly devijed Fables^ but we have made
known unto you the Power and Coming of
our Lord Jt^fus Chrjjl among the Heathen -
as now in P^/^^ry Religion was grounded
upon Fables ; all their Divinations, Ma-

that Foundation. And it was thus at

the Worfliip of their Gods and Demons
with contriv'd Stories of their Extrac-

Laws required of Men their Worfhip-

That the Devil is in Chains^ and
fo is a very inlignificant Fellow,
far from that univerfal Monarchy
of this World, having at his Com-
mand Legions of what, I know
not how to call them, that he
fends up and down to tempt, tire
and torment Men upon the whok
Earth : Whereas, as to Temptation,
St. James tells us, Chap, i . Ver. 1 4*
That every Man is tempired when he
is drawn away of his own Lufi, and
enticed : Let the Courts of Judica-:
ture put out of their Indi£lments,
that the MalefaEior did kill or rob a
Man by the Injligation of the Devil -^
for the Devil was not ther€, nor
knew nothing of the Matter.
Therefore, O Chriftians, look ta
your felves, and make your Peace
with God, for He alone is to be
fear'd ! He fees and knows, and

diligently to be noted, that St^

a notable Exception, both in St.

were not to fpeak of the cafting

tion: And why was not the cafting
out of Dxmons a Miracle, for it is
named among them; or is it a
leffer Miracle than making the
