  		              		Experience Description   

    I only remember that I was lying on the bed while he was strangling me. I tried to push him away. At last, I could not fight anymore because he was pushing so hard. I remember that I was angry. But when I became lax, I was completely calm. For a long time I was unable to move.

   It was as if I was not present in my own body. After that I floated above the two of us and looked down. It was a quiet and serene feeling, but I remember that I was then pulled back again. It was difficult and unpleasant to return; the other was a better feeling.
