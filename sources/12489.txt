  		              		Experience Description   

    On 2/18/2020 and 2/19/2020 I was at the hospital for a heart operation procedure.  Three times I went code blue without a pulse and was revived. On the third time I was gifted with a sense of being that I describe as a visit to a place of life everlasting. 
  
    I have for years carried in my wallet a cloth touched to the tomb of Fr Solanus. It contains his last words. 'I give my soul to Jesus Christ’. A prayer card to Fr Solanus has been resident on my wife's dresser furniture for years.

  The passing and the receiving of the favor.

  I received three revivals and a visitation of my soul and remembrance to the afterlife that occurred during 2/19/20.  I was sitting down in the ICU and blacked out when my heart stopped. I hit the floor, face first and my nose was broken. I did not feel the pain at any time.
  
  Initially my being was of a harmonic movement. Without my body it felt like I was trapped in a pool tarp. The awareness was of being wrapped in a shroud (tightness) with senses and spinning in a clockwise direction.

  My being began to be filled with an awareness of joy, elation and filled with the holy spirit.  I can remember my form wanting to envelope and embrace much like the balloon man that is seen waving on the in the physical world. I had an awareness that I was of spirit but not of bodily form. 

  The filling of euphoria continued in the motion of an earthly ride called the tilt-a-whirl or roundabout Freed of a physical body my new form moved in and out, up and down at will and with movement to start and stop.

  There were six distinct movements of the soul. 1) Clockwise movements around a circle of 12 soft hued white energy but with an awareness of being. 2)  I then  move forward and back horizontally towards the light energy while continuing to move clockwise. 3)I then moved towards the lights upside, 4) back and then 5) towards the light downside facing the beings of light. 6) The final movement was will I shall call a levitation or an ascension above the beings of light but still in the spiritual world. I was floating and bouncing on a harmonic circle of energy with the 12 beings of light on the perimeter. 

  My being then became aware of a never ending vista with an endless horizon and light like the aurora borealis. An awareness of a world without end was evident.

  Upon this awareness came a more comforting message to my being that 'You are not alone in the universe. You will never be alone in the universe, because you are the universe'

  The favor of everlasting spirit was provided and the euphoria of spirit never left me.

  I was presented with advanced knowledge in a field Biomimetics that I was not formally trained in. The knowledge also was able to patent a clean energy device. The knowledge required a translation of spiritual symbolism to physical design.  

Background Information:       

Gender:   	Male  

  Date NDE Occurred:   	 February 19, 2020  
  
NDE Elements:       

At the time of your experience, was there an associated life-threatening event?        Yes    Surgery-related Heart attack       Clinical death (cessation of breathing or heart function)   

How do you consider the content of your experience?        Entirely pleasant  

  Did you feel separated from your body?      No.    I clearly left my body and existed outside it  
  
How did your highest level of consciousness and alertness during the experience compare to your normal everyday consciousness and alertness?        More consciousness and alertness than normal   I was presented with information from the future that involved the convergence of Biomimetics of the Blue Morpho Butterfly (as an example) and knowledge in advanced physics. My Deacon says this is a documented event just as St Paul's 2nd letter to the Corinthians. It was a journey to the 3rd heaven and a presentation of advanced learning and technology to construct.  

At what time during the experience were you at your highest level of consciousness and alertness?         Yes, I was filled with the Holy Spirit. I was always surrounded by and interacted with 12 beings of light as if they were on a Rosary but without the physical connections.  

Were your thoughts speeded up?         Incredibly fast  

Did time seem to speed up or slow down?         Everything seemed to be happening at once; or time stopped or lost all meaning     Everything seem to be happening in a dodecahedron time where I could communicate with the 12 beings of light simultaneously.    

Were your senses More vivid than usual?         Incredibly more vivid  

Please compare your vision during the experience to your everyday vision that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.       There is no vision per say. The physical body and senses are gone and replaced by all knowing.  

Please compare your hearing during the experience to your everyday hearing that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.      What is called hearing in everyday physical life was replaced by what I call cognitive resonance where information is passed in vibrations.  

Did you seem to be aware of things going on elsewhere, as if by ESP?       Yes, and the facts have been checked out  

Did you pass into or through a tunnel?         Uncertain     My passing felt like a spinning while being trapped in a pool tarp.  

Did you see any beings in your experience?         I actually saw them  

Did you encounter or become aware of any deceased (or alive) beings?         No       

Did you see, or feel surrounded by, a brilliant light?         A light clearly of mystical or other-worldly origin  

Did you see an unearthly light?         Uncertain   I saw 12 Beings of Light; Three lights in an arc; A Borealis of Light on an infinity horizon.  

Did you seem to enter some other, unearthly world?         A clearly mystical or unearthly realm     My event was clearly St Paul's 3rd Heaven.   In 2 Corinthians Paul the Apostle writes, 'I know a person in Christ who fourteen years ago was caught up to the third heaven—whether in the body or out of the body I do not know; God knows. And I know that such a person—whether in the body or out of the body I do not know; God knows—was caught up into Paradise and heard things that are not to be told, that no mortal is permitted to repeat  

What emotions did you feel during the experience?         As a Catholic I recall the moment that I was filled with the Holy Spirit and knowledge passed to me.  

Did you have a feeling of peace or pleasantness?         Incredible peace or pleasantness  

Did you feel a sense of harmony or unity with the universe?       I felt united or one with the world  

Did you suddenly seem to understand everything?         Everything about the universe     I was presented with advanced knowledge that I didn't previously have in quantum physics and biomimetics.  

Did scenes from your past come back to you?         No       

Did scenes from the future come to you?         Scenes from the world's future     The creation of a clean energy device. The presentation was clear enough and detailed enough to build and present as a patent. A patent in the field of Biomimetics and clean energy.  

Did you come to a border or point of no return?         No     

God, Spiritual and Religion:       

What was your religion prior to your experience?      Christian- Catholic   I had a blessed relic of St Solanus in my wallet at the time of my passing  

Have your religious practices changed since your experience?         No       

What is your religion now?         Christian- Catholic     

Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was entirely consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience       

Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         No       

Did you seem to encounter a mystical being or presence, or hear an unidentifiable voice?         I encountered a definite being, or a voice clearly of mystical or unearthly origin   There was not a voice but a telepathic communication.  

Did you see deceased or religious spirits?         I actually saw them  

Did you encounter or become aware of any beings who previously lived on earth who are described by name in religions (for example: Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, etc.)?         No     

During your experience, did you gain information about premortal existence?         Yes     I was presented with scientific knowledge on physics and devices that run on visible light.  

During your experience, did you gain information about universal connection or oneness?         Yes     The beings of light presented me with an affirmation. You are not alone in the Universe. You are the Universe. You will never be alone. It was presented in resonance/vibration in the language of Jesus.  

During your experience, did you gain information about the existence of God?         Yes     The 12 Beings of Light were spiritual and had an advanced knowledge of the universe.  

Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:       

During your experience, did you gain special knowledge or information about your purpose?      Yes   Being presented with knowledge and science to construct fields that may not emerge for decades to come.  

During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?         Yes     Earth is a level on the way to the 3rd Heaven. It is a place to learn that we are truly all together in the Universe.  

  During your experience, did you gain information about an afterlife?         An afterlife definitely exists.     The beings of light presented the journey in all black and white. This journey to the Catholic 3rd heaven affirmed teachings of a world without end; A group of 12 beings of light passing on future knowledge.  
  
Did you gain information about how to live our lives?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about life's difficulties, challenges and hardships?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about love?         No       

What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         No changes in my life     I am filled with the Holy Spirit which was a gift from the afterlife. I now have the ability to rapidly scan and absorb advanced science knowledge. I have a different awareness on what is real and what is myth when it comes to beings and beings off world.  

Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          No   

After the NDE:       

Was the experience difficult to express in words?        Yes   The loss of physical senses and 3d movement. The Beings of Light communicated in wave vibrations in the language of Jesus. The message was specific to me.  You are not alone in the universe. You are not alone in the universe. (We have been observing your development), You will never be alone in the universe.  

How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         Yes     I understand that the Beings of Light are our mentors and can and will be unseen to those who don't have faith. Faith is a far greater commitment than just believing something to be.  

Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          The whole experience was of a soul being able to mimic the physically of a future device. My documented six steps to the 3rd heaven are akin to what many call a modern day version of Ezekiel's Wheel in the bible. The difference is that I have decades of experience in technology to understand something even more advanced that was presented to me by the beings of light.  

Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    Immediately with the cardiologists, doctors, nurses and support staff in the ICU that brought me back. I shared the narrative of my journey with leaders of the local Catholic Church.  

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       No     

What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real     It was in alignment with Catholic beliefs of an afterlife.  

What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real     My experience was one of traveling to the 3rd Heaven of St Paul in his letter to the Corinthians.  In 2 Corinthians Paul the Apostle writes, 'I know a person in Christ who fourteen years ago was caught up to the third heaven—whether in the body or out of the body I do not know; God knows. And I know that such a person—whether in the body or out of the body I do not know; God knows—was caught up into Paradise and heard things that are not to be told, that no mortal is permitted to repeat  

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       No     

Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?         My journey is that I am evolving as a life form from a physical to a Holy Spirit filled Being of Light able to transcend time.  

Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?         This questionnaire is well thought out.
