  		              		Experience Description:   

  					  I fell asleep at the wheel driving on the freeway, car rolled off and flipped off freeway. I woke and was hovering over my body - everything was very quiet, I was not afraid just stared at myself and thought I was dead. I was not frightened but did not see a white light coming from above like I thought (or you see in movies). Then I woke up and everything was very loud (my radio was blasting and you could hear the freeway noise rushing above). I was in a lot of pain as I had a compound fracture to my right elbow. I ran to the freeway and someone stopped. The police were called and I was taken to an intensive care unit hospital where surgery was done to save my arm, which they were able to do. I have minimal scarring on my face and elbow to this day.
