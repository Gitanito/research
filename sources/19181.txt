now if if
at some point it came to be realized
that we really can&#39;t have endless war
with humans at least at the level of
thermonuclear war because there would
only be one launch
and it&#39;d all be over
guys i know at the pentagon&#39;s at every
single war game ever done
accidental or deliberate launch of a
nuclear weapon it leads to defcon it&#39;s a
full launch of all of them everywhere it
if not immediately within a matter of
days so the problem becomes
how do you keep the largest industry in
the world going
if peace breaks out the largest industry
in the world is war the
military-industrial laboratory financial
gang-bangster complex
you gotta find a bigger enemy
so you know a few
thousand misguided you know
quote terrorists
which do exist
you know we can spend a trillion dollars
a year fighting this threat but what
they&#39;re really wanting to do is keep
that system on life support until they
roll out the big one
which verner von braun
predicted and not only predicted but
knew that saw the plans for it and i&#39;ve
seen them also and that&#39;s the false flag
interplanetary
threat and as you know douglas macarthur
general macarthur in his last address to
the congress said world war iii will be
interplanetary
that was in the 50s so for longer than
i&#39;ve been alive
there has been
a an unspoken
covert agenda
to misinform and disinform the public on
this issue
and allow just enough disclosure to
happen but with the spin on it
that it&#39;s a threat
and there so we&#39;re now into three
generations 60 years a generation&#39;s
about 20 years of this kind of
brainwashing and propaganda
and so that is a huge problem it is
actually the biggest barrier to our
going forward as of civilization and it
most certainly is the biggest barrier to
you becoming an ambassador to these
civilizations because if you have been
taken in by that agenda
and absorbed into your paradigm
the fear or hatred of any of these
civilizations based on anything you have
heard or read
or even experienced because you may have
been a victim of military conducted
abductions
which are the dominant experience
we&#39;ll get into this if you want to it&#39;s
not a pretty picture how it i know the
people who actually run the operations
i&#39;ve met with them
it&#39;s not theoretical on my part then if
you have that in your mind and that fear
and hatred is operative
you&#39;re not going to be able to be out
under the stars with even a small group
of people go into quiet calm
consciousness in a state of inviting
but you don&#39;t just call them in they&#39;re
not dolphins at sea world
but inviting them and they whether they
show up or not in a way you see with
your five senses they&#39;re gonna get pick
this up just like the random number
generators are gonna pick up just before
9 11. they&#39;re scanning all of this
their technologies communication and
visual
cross over into the realm of thought
astral
and intention
so if you have the intent
to say
well i under i hear what dr grier&#39;s
saying but i really only want the ones
that look like pretty nordic babes
to show up
nothing&#39;s going to happen
nothing
nothing
in fact we&#39;ve had experiences where
there have been people who have come on
these week-long expeditions who have had
undisclosed
um
agendas related to that
paradigm of division
of the good and the bad ones and they&#39;re
really not wanting to be true
ambassadors to the universe and all
sentient beings
and every time one of those
people
goes to the bathroom
a craft shows up or if they stay home or
or no or they get altitude sickness
because we&#39;re up at 10 000 feet
somewhere in the mountains
it&#39;s it&#39;s uncanny we&#39;ve watched this
happen hundreds and hundreds and
hundreds of times so if you have that in
your paradigm i would suggest that if
you&#39;re not here you can go to bed now if
you are here you can go back home
because there&#39;s really no point in
pursuing
the question of intent is a paper i
wrote the intent
the the
purpose
has to be something deeper than the
divisiveness and the consciousness
that&#39;s gotten us to the state we&#39;re on
in right now
and as
einstein said no problem is solved by
the level of consciousness that created
it so the
consciousness of separation
hatred
the vision
us versus them that isn&#39;t going to be
the solution going forward and we cannot
trade
international conflict
and become a peaceful global global
civilization only to trade world peace
for interplanetary war
therefore
even if there are civilizations out
there that are
truly extraterrestrial and not stage
crafted by the the by the the covert
military and intelligence projects
and as i said i can&#39;t prove a negative i
can&#39;t make a blanket statement
it would still behoove us
to adopt this paradigm and behave
ourselves in this way
why
all of you may have been familiar with
the so-called maharishi effect when they
started having lots of people meditate
in a city
and the crime rates would go down
remember that study
it&#39;s real they&#39;ve been reproduced
imagine if we get thousands of people
millions of people
doing these deep meditations with the
intent of creating universal peace
might it
affect
civilizations that have a proclivity
towards conflict or harm it would
it would
and so no matter what your belief on
this is the path of wisdom and safety
is exactly
this approach
deep consciousness the oneness that we
all and
share together
universal peace
without prejudice
and if there&#39;s a point of conflict
it isn&#39;t going to be solved on the
barrel of a laser gun or a rail gun
because when you&#39;re talking about
interstellar technologies that are
transdimensional
a hydrogen bomb
looks like a
tinker toy it&#39;s not even a musket
and so any civilization that can reach
this corner of the universe
as well as the classified projects that
have weaponized reverse engineered as
well as innately developed human scalar
and longitudinal electromagnetic systems
we&#39;ll get into this
if that were to be engaged in a level of
conflict
it would last a fraction of a nanosecond
and all life on earth would terminate
therefore
that isn&#39;t an option
those of you who are addicted to war and
conflict and having someone else to hate
you know it&#39;s not politically correct to
hate someone who&#39;s black or gay or well
in some countries it is still
or or
this or that
but it&#39;s perfectly okay particularly
amongst people who would pretend to be
so new age
to hate this species or that species of
ets there is nothing new age about that
that is the worst of the old yuga that&#39;s
the worst of the old age
and so and i hate to be so blunt and if
i&#39;m offending any of you i actually
don&#39;t apologize i think you need to hear
this but
it&#39;s something that you have to begin to
contemplate
how are we going to go forward as a
civilization if we just keep replacing
one enemy with another
i mean after all
my father who was fought in world war
ii
it was hand-to-hand combat with the
japanese now we&#39;re very close friends
with the japanese
after we each killed millions of each
other&#39;s citizens
so
to what end is this kind of approach to
problem solving
of conflict and war
it isn&#39;t a solution and at one time okay
well you have armies of people with with
bows and arrows and then rifles and in
muskets and then machine guns
and then atomic weapons and new and then
a hydrogen bombs thermonuclear weapons
which are different from atomic look it
up but they&#39;re much more powerful
and now we&#39;re talking about technologies
that are infinitely more destructive
than hydrogen bombs are we really
thinking we&#39;re going to go forward
in that paradigm and survive it
so this is why i&#39;m making a call
for people of reason and vision
and true deep spirituality to become
these ambassadors representing humanity
to these civilizations free of prejudice
free of fear
and
here&#39;s a beautiful thought
as krishna said to arjuna on the
battlefield in the bhagavad-gita a
little of this
eliminates all fear that this was a
capital t
it&#39;s that state of samadhi pure
consciousness and why is that
was the same reason that most people
who&#39;ve had a near-death experience
aren&#39;t afraid of death
and don&#39;t have the fear most people have
and that is you realize there is no
death and that your true inner self
is not only infinite and omnipresent and
eternal
but there really is no death
so what are you afraid of if you have
that experience over and over and over
again in the state of quiet pure
consciousness
so if you&#39;re enlightened you&#39;re not
afraid of death
it doesn&#39;t mean you want to die but
you&#39;re not afraid of it now you may not
want to have
you know an experience of suffering
or torture that&#39;s different
all right
you know i&#39;ve had plenty of
you know anyway i won&#39;t go into
what how how i have been tortured by
classified projects to stop what i&#39;m
doing it is torture
but because they&#39;re sadists at heart
but so you don&#39;t want that
but you do want to be able to have
an understanding of that you&#39;re really
not mutable you&#39;re immutable you&#39;re
eternal and if you understand that
then you&#39;re going to be able to have any
kind of contact with any civilization
from any star system
and you won&#39;t be afraid
because you will be centered in the
place of the placeless
you&#39;ll be centered in this quiet deep
state of mind that precludes
fear and the fight-or-flight response of
the midbrain of the animal nature
now this is really important because
some years ago
those of you who have read
some of the books
when we were in england
the year that we
had an amazing amazing experience it was
the same year we put the
seasetti logo up this
and we visualized it we went on top of a
mountain a hill in in england uh
woodbury hill
and we
didn&#39;t know that we were going to
project this and and send this to the
e.t so we got up on the hill and we went
up there and we went oh let&#39;s and let&#39;s
do an equilateral triangle three circles
connected by lines
and there were maybe 12 of us
so we sat went into deep meditation
using what i&#39;m going to teach you
tonight
and then
kind of remote viewed space in the air
around us and connected to
the trans-dimensional interstellar crop
circle makers
not doug and dave
not the ones with the boards but the
real ones um
and within hours a farmer within line
side of where we were a field within
line site
found this crop circle exactly this
shape you&#39;re gonna see it this weekend
if you haven&#39;t seen already in a field
and it was a crop circle ce5 close
encounter in it and that was how and
they got it and communicate and said yes
we hear you
it was beautiful
absolutely beautiful
when i decided to move to where i live
now at this farm in virginia
i was really debating whether to move it
and get there or not
as soon as i signed the contract for the
property i was
told and then found online and then got
a physical copy of the paper that
virtually this same
crop circle appeared in a field owned by
the man who was the broker who was
selling us our property
and it was the most beautiful it was a
similar version to this
and it appeared as an affirmation from
them that that&#39;s where i should go so
this gets really strange no one in the
world knew that i was even looking in
that area of the blue ridge mountains of
virginia to move
except my wife and this
agent
so they&#39;re always wired into what we&#39;re
doing
and it becomes highly interactive and
once you understand what the nature of
your own self and your mind
the people say how how often is there
contact i said it&#39;s continuous it&#39;s it&#39;s
it&#39;s like
the operating system you&#39;re in that
state and you&#39;re going along it&#39;s not
like you&#39;re continuously seeing ufos
i&#39;m not saying that but you&#39;re
continuously locked into that level
of cosmic civilization
and all kinds of things that seem like
complete magic just happen on an ongoing
basis all the time
beautiful
and that&#39;s what i want you to understand
that this is not just something you have
to do and when you&#39;re going out under
stars with three or four other people
it&#39;s a state of being where you&#39;re an
ambassador of these civilizations and it
causes this huge field effect change so
just as something negative can be
anticipated and register on a random
number generator like 911 something
enormously positive which is actually
more powerful when a lot of people are
doing it can have an effect
on
entire civilizations ours and these
interstellar civilizations
so this is not just a
a laboratory experiment this is us
co-creating together the next chapter
in human civilization
and that&#39;s really why we&#39;re here
you didn&#39;t know that but that&#39;s really
why you&#39;re on this planet right now
you&#39;re really on this planet we are the
i
i i have a a book in the works that&#39;ll
probably not come out for a while now
because i have so many other things
going on
that&#39;s really called the the last
generation
and the first generation
we are the last
generation to be a witness
to this era of separateness
linearity division
war and global eco-describe destruction
but we&#39;re the first generation those of
us between the ages
of
puberty and senility
to
create
and bear witness to and manifest
the early beginnings of a
world and interplanetary civilization
that is running on free energy
anti-gravity
the science of consciousness
the ability to live in complete harmony
with gaia which is a conscious living
being who is female
and
to become interstellar
within
our lifetime
within our lifetime
well
maybe
and what is that dependent on that&#39;s
dependent on us doing the right thing
and choosing the path that isn&#39;t
recapitulating
thousands of years of separation and
endless war but looking into the future
with a new consciousness that is this
unitive state
and where there are no aliens
but everyone are actually
emanations of our own true inner self
that state of oneness
and so at that point there&#39;s no
foundation for war there&#39;s no foundation
for separation and there&#39;s no basis for
fear
and this is why
not only from a practical operative
point of view
we have to be in this state of
consciousness but from a philosophical
and ethical point of view
we have to understand and live that
state of consciousness because at that
point
we&#39;re going to be able to be ambassadors
to the universe but ambassadors to
ourselves
and manifest the world that has been
foretold for thousands of years i mean
this is the time
where
our civilization has been asked to
leave off
the old
ways
it&#39;s a bit like the metamorphosis of a
butterfly leave off that shell
and let the butterfly emerge
and
then take flight
and this is not something that is going
to take thousands of years this is
something actually that&#39;s been
banging at the door of our consciousness
and of our planet for a hundred years
but these civilizations aren&#39;t going to
land on the white house law like larry
king asked me
and enforce it
because force
never works
internally manifested true power
does
and if we try to force something like
this
and if they were to try to force it it
would never work
so it has to come from this point of
realization and acceptance
and these civilizations are simply
waiting and when i first founded
this project
i was shocked actually because i started
having ce5 events happening when i was
18.
so i had a near-death experience when i
was 17 three months later i learned
meditation on my 18th birthday and a few
months later i was up in the blue ridge
mountains in north carolina in a deep
state of meditation went into samadhi
and then had a contact experience with
ets and co-created the protocols i&#39;m
teaching you this weekend
but and then i didn&#39;t do anything with
it for a while but
what i realized is that
and that was 1973.
so you know i&#39;m no spring chicken i&#39;ve
got eight grandchildren and four
children now
yeah
so yeah it&#39;s beautiful really i love i
love family
um they&#39;re beautiful and and this is
but that experience which has been going
they&#39;ve really been asking and i thought
at the time i thought well this is very
strange experience i didn&#39;t know what
i&#39;d do with it until i was told to do
something with it
in 1990
17 years later
and so here we are
but
what came clear through
these experiences
when we first started going out with
people
immediately there would be massive ce5
events happen
witnessed by people and i was going wow
and only is i knew it worked but i i and
and what i was told by the et&#39;s
intuitively
was that
we&#39;re waiting for you
you guys think
you guys are sitting here waiting for us
we&#39;re waiting for you
so they&#39;re waiting for us to take the
initiative that&#39;s why i call it the
close encounters of the fifth kind
initiative
we take the initiative this we&#39;re the
children of earth this is our home
planet we need to grow up and take
responsibility for it in every way
possible but we also have to then invite
them
to interact with us openly because they
simply do not want to force the issue
and the only way they would force it is
if they had to
and that is we go into interstellar war
because our weapon systems reach parity
parity with theirs or we destroy
so much ecosystem damage that there&#39;s
sort of a a need to have a rescue
mission to the planet but those are
worst case scenarios let&#39;s not let it
get to that and then there would be a
massive intervention
that was in that paper
when i first wrote about in 1991
consciousness assisted technologies but
also technology-assisted consciousness
goes both ways your consciousness can
assist the technology but there can be
technologies that
augment your consciousness and project
it
et&#39;s have it classified projects have it
but i wrote that there were only a few
scenarios under which there would be
this kind of overt involvement
because they really wanted to be gentle
they&#39;re waiting for us to answer the
call that&#39;s been ringing this cosmic
call that&#39;s been ringing for decades
because we have really reached the point
in a as a global civilization
to have come together in peace
and created
interplanetary
relationships with these other
civilizations
we just haven&#39;t done it
and so this is what the the real
question for each of you are you ready
to become an ambassador
from earth and humanity to these other
civilizations
and if you are then let&#39;s do it together
and that&#39;s really what we want to share
tonight and this weekend and going
forward in how we live our lives
all right
so what i would like to do is let people
get up and take about a 20-minute
stretch break
and uh a
comfort break
and then after that we&#39;ll come back and
and and from 10 o&#39;clock until 11 we&#39;re
going to go through a
breathing meditation technique and then
i&#39;m going to do the sacred puja and
share with you
uh
a sanskrit mantra and take you through
the process of meditation so that
tonight tomorrow morning you can
practice it so that tomorrow afternoon
when i begin to teach you some remote
viewing techniques and approaches you&#39;ll
have a foundation in consciousness to
practice them
does that make sense all right we&#39;ll see
you in 20 minutes thank you
you
